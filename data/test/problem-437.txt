, and wasn’t that strange?—looked upset. The idea of it, of Harry’s mouth twisted in that frown that’s more disappointment than anything else, was painful.
Harry has pressed play and the story must continue, moving forward into the things that happen next when someone is dying.
Eight kilometers hadn’t blunted the anxiety thrumming under Harry’s skin. He’d scalded his skin, then let it wrinkle under his showerhead, he’d thrust furiously into his fist, he’d tried not to think about the heat of Malfoy’s mouth hovering above him. And then he’d growled
The headlines narrated the story of a world in chaos. It was almost as if, after the external threat of Voldemort was defeated, everyone forgot how to live with each other.
“I think you have an unhealthy tendency to put Potter on a pedestal,” Pansy says, and she sounds so fucking mature about it Draco wants to flick a peanut at her.
The shift hadn’t been linear. There was no slow build towards compassion. No steely decision to lock every death eater up and throw away the key. No one could agree, and so the people pushed and pulled and tore each other apart.
Draco remembers holding her hand, as they removed the stasis charm, as his mother slipped slowly back into death.
“Then what are you doing in my book shop? Did you wander in from the bustle looking for respite from the perils of our modern life?”
!” Robertson booms, white beard bristling. Even at rest, Robertson’s voice is just louder than the average person. “Or perhaps
“Hey!” Harry says, hoping that he’s not too late and that one of his best friends will still be awake.
“Mr. Draco, sir,” Minty, one of their few remaining house elves, says, startling Draco out of the memory. “Miss Pansy is here.”
It’s the giant grandfather clock that drags him back to the present, eleven loud gongs knocking him about the head.
“How can you know! How can you and saint Potter be so goddamn certain that I deserve the benefit of so much doubt?”
No one did. The mass of bodies disperses, anger sinking back into the mix of the everyday. The osmosis of trauma in a world that won’t stop hurting.
A sharp bolt of red light shoots past Draco’s right ear. “Motherfucker!” he says, dropping to the ground, pressing himself flat against the pavement as another curse whizzes past.
“Oh?” Robertson eyes him suspiciously. “Well, I’m the proprietor of this establishment, so I’m sure you’d be receptive to my suggestions?”
The chatter fades to static as Harry lolls his head back, drifts off into the memory of another world, another channel with a slightly different frequency, thinks of the way Draco had looked at him.
“You’re doing such a lovely job convincing me to live.” Feelings had always been a cloak and dagger affair. Malfoys approached their emotions like their posture—rigid, straight backed, controlled. John refused to acknowledge the Pureblood rules of emotional disclosure and Draco feels strange and scrubbed and a bit exposed.
The strings of his heart are suddenly taught. “Yes,” Draco answers, because it’s true. In every universe so far, most details varied wildly—from winter wastelands to nipple pasties. One thing, though, remained steadfast. Harry Potter, not-always-the-saviour-of-the-world, the boy who lived in every timeline, was always there.
For a moment, an image of Archway Bridge flashes across his memory. Of broad shoulders trembling and headlights disappearing into the distance. The universes mix and swirl, and Draco feels himself slip under, dragged down by the current of every possible version of himself.
“I’m sorry, but you’re trying to squeeze water out of a rock, Draco,” a woman says. Harry’s hand freezes.
“It was actually meant to reveal the true nature of my soul, Pans. Do keep up,” Draco says, congested in that weepy sort of way.
Draco thinks, and feels his rage fizzle to nothing. Of course Potter doesn’t want to be seen with him. Doesn’t want any of Draco’s shame to get on his horrible shoes. Somehow, the idea of Harry being embarrassed of him hurts more than anything else in this horrible day.
There are no weapons in his bedroom. Maybe if he can make it to the kitchen. There are knives in there. Draco slips out of bed, his bare feet cold on the hardwood, and he creeps from his room.
Powerful magic rends the air. Draco can feel the anger in it—he can taste the rage as it mingles with the blood in his mouth.
“Or is this some return to your repressed teenage stalker phrase? Figuring out what the evil Mafloy is up to?”
“Yes,” Draco whispers. When he lets himself think about it, in the hours after returning from another glimpse, another universe, Draco knows that he hadn’t stood a chance. That falling for Potter was as inevitable as breathing. He’d always been weak for Potter’s attention—he just hadn’t known that the pendulum could swing so far. “If you had to watch repeated iterations of Potter being stubborn and perfect and in love with
“It’s not decided yet,” Hermione had said. “But most people believe that Malfoy and his mother will receive lengthy prison sentences.”
Draco Malfoy had been missing for almost five years and Harry would know, because he had been looking for him.
The shelves on the walls were filled decades ago, and stacks of books have started to climb next to them on the floor. It’s the room of requirement, but in the imagination of a bibliophile. The footpath from Historical Fiction to Life and Leisure is so obscured by titles, it’s barely wide enough for a single foot. Two people walking abreast would surely result in an avalanche of verbiage.
In the days and weeks after the war had shuddered to a halt, Harry felt his insides start to decay. He didn’t want or hate, he didn’t care or breathe. He’d left a part of him behind at King’s Cross.
“Fuck, he did, didn’t he?” Harry had forgotten how many ways Malfoy had hurt them. The rest of the war had diluted the harms—made them feel like teenage problems, when they’d hurt each other with an abandon that should never really’ve been allowed.
“We were supposed to live,” he says. He’s inside out. The tender parts screaming, the pretences shoved away.
The is it, friends. The penultimate chapter. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for reading. <3
“Fuck,” he says, turning around, looking at all of these pieces of Draco that have been left behind.
Draco looks up at the tower of titles climbing the walls in front of him with grim determination. Robertson may be filled with more words than the British Library, but his organizational instincts had lost the plot—often quite literally.
“Potter, I don’t know what—” Draco’s yelling over him, but Harry’s not listening, just barrels forwards.
Harry’s stomach lurches, and he leans back, feeling more like a nineteen-year-old who can’t handle his liquor and less like a twenty-two-year-old slayer of dark lords.
Pansy glares at the boom box, as if it’s interrupting them on purpose. “Seriously Draco. Is this some kind of punishment?”
“You could tell me,” Draco says. “About what you’re doing up here.” Although Draco is starting to understand, thinks he might know.
“Yes,” Hermione says, crowding around him. “You see, the curse was actually fairly straightforward once we were able to parse the intent of the spell from the original Latin. I honestly don’t know why you didn’t reach out earlier,” Hermione says, directing the last line at Pansy. “It would have saved everyone a great deal of trouble.”
“I’ve even drafted you a summary of the potential savings for the hospital in that lovely report I placed it in your mailbox three weeks ago. Have you had a chance to review it?”
The problem was, Harry had known he was broken. But it wasn’t in a way that could be fixed—not even by someone as clever as Hermione. The parts of him that should be alive—the insides, where he was supposed to feel all of those vibrant things that had been there before he’d wandered into that forest—were dead. They were dead and they weren’t coming back.
“It’s fascinating!” Draco says, a bit dreamy eyed. “I don’t know how they trap all of your assets in a tiny piece of plastic, but they do! It works every time.”
It should be hard, Harry thinks, to tell him. “I think…” Where is he supposed to start? “I—uh—Malfoy. I think I might—”
“Don’t let them slip away,” Harry says and Draco looks for him. Potter’s across the street, far enough away that he hasn’t seen Draco yet. It’s like this, sometimes. Sometimes, he and Harry haven’t settled into anything romantic. Sometimes, Draco gets to see it happen, gets to relive Harry’s desire crumbling.
Wind filters in through white curtains, jostling the fine leaves of few baby spider plants Draco must’ve repotted. The silence in the living room tickles the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck.
“I can’t go back in there,” Draco said to the open air. He took a deep breath and realized that it hurts. The deep freeze cut into his lungs and chilled him from the inside out. “I can’t.”
“At the end, I asked for a look,” Draco says, much more quietly. “Up until that point, I think he found my naivete charming rather than manic.”
And then Harry wants to leave, wants to get out, because this isn’t his memory and Draco never said that he could look.
Pansy had wanted a piece of him almost immediately. Had fire called and owled and—in a truly tenacious act that Draco was sure she’d seen in a Muggle Rom-Com—had shown up at the manor’s gate holding a giant handwritten sign that read ANSWER ME YOU TWAT!!! in all caps.
“How long!” The look is back. That look that takes Hermione’s features and transfigures them into a shape that will change the world. “How long has this been going on?”
Those green eyes are hard and flat when Potter says, “Not like this, Malfoy. Not where people can see.”
“They’ve got fridges of it just lying around!” Ron had yelped when Harry had explained that it wouldn’t be that difficult.
It’s the most he’s said to Malfoy in over a month, and the way Malfoy’s dreamy eyes snap back into focus tells Harry that he’s noticed.
“I was at the market, and I came upon these lovely cabbages. And as I was picking them up, examining each one for that special something that will turn an average borcht into an exquisite one, I couldn’t help but to think about Hamlet’s musings once confronted with the skull of Yorick.”
“Not while I’m still living,” his mother said. “With your father in…” she’d stumbled. “Without your father, I have full control over the Malfoy estate. It has to be me.”
“Don’t wanna be, ALL BY MYSELF!” Draco belts the chorus out into his empty flat, but it’s not enough.
Had it not been for his inevitable one-way trip to Azkaban, Draco knows he would never have cast the spell. He rubs at his arms, searching for some sign that it's worked—it's only been a few minutes, but he craves confirmation.
The rage is a rash all over him, fury building and itching and Draco wants to climb out of his skin.
As if Draco doesn’t matter at all. It makes him want to lunge, grab Potter’s shoulders and shake him until he remembers that he used to care about what Draco was up to. That he used to look at Draco with something more than pity.
Harry thought about it sometimes, the way that Malfoy’s face had looked. He’s thinking about it now, as he stands in front of an office announcing the presence of a man he had never expected to find.
“Let me,” Granger says, and before Draco can do anything, there’s magic washing all over him. It’s pathetic, but Draco sighs into the spells.
“Fuck off,” Harry says, squirming. Under his tighter-than-usual fashion choices or Malfoy’s more-intense-than-usual stare, Harry can’t be sure.
“He’ll be back,” Harry says to one of the larger plants, retreating to the bedroom and crawling back under the covers.
Most of the people have stopped shuffling, most bodies have found their seats, when a gavel snaps the room to attention.
“What is he doing here?” Pansy says from her position next to Hermione. “Like, what is he contributing?”
But the blood was everywhere, pooling around her head, sprayed on stone. They’d used it as ink to write on the walls.
Fear nips at his heels, cold as the Alaskan Tundra. It had only happened once though, and Pansy was an inattentive sort when other people were paying attention to her.
Which left Harry standing in front of an enormous gate with a wand in a box, no plan, and no idea what to do next. Someone was going to have to let him in, but there wasn’t an intercom or a buzzer and Harry had no idea how wizards handled unexpected callers without the convenience of Muggle technology.
Touching Harry Potter is like trying to soothe an earthquake and yet Draco will try, every time. He lays one hand between Harry’s shoulder blades, lets it rest there, waits for Harry to shake him off, maybe hit him.
“It’s not a question.” Narcissa’s voice is as stern as Draco’s ever heard it. “I’ve instructed the house elves to stop permitting you entrance to the grounds, beginning next week.”
“I wish I could change—” Draco’s not sure why he’s talking. “I would do anything to go back and just shake myself.”
“No more philosophizing under the stars,” Harry said, grinning. His mouth was so close. Draco wanted to touch the smile with his fingers. “C’mon.”
“This is practically Pagan,” Pansy says, tongue flicking out to lick at her lips nervously. Hermione dabs the blood, determined and soft, into the shape of a star.
At first, he was sure he would wait until morning. Enough havoc had been wrought and Harry was dead on his feet. The box, though, seemed to call to him. The mystery of the vials inside whispered his name, and Harry knew that he wouldn’t wait. That he had to know.
“Fucking psycho,” Katie says, and Harry’s starting to get angry. Because can’t anyone see that Malfoy is standing right there, next to the wall of charts? His grey eyes are churning and Harry can feel a storm coming, but no one else seems to notice him, which is bizarre really. Because someone else is agreeing—
“But with a mobile unit, you’re literally just paying me and a police officer—both of whom will already be seeing the patient. Plus, it will expedite the emergency room experience because of the reduced volume of presentations.”
Apologies hang in the air. They both know that they’re there. Neither Harry nor Draco pay them any mind.
The tears are red hot under his eyelids and Draco looks up at into the horrible florescence to keep the damn from bursting. “I’m also hopelessly in love with someone who will never want me back. Although that issue is currently a close second to the whole my-poor-choices-have-come-back-and-wrecked-vicious-vengeance thing I mentioned earlier.”
At this point, Robertson pillages his shopping, shuffling through several heads of cabbage. “Ah ha! This cabbage, Draco, this one right here. Does he not look like a Yorick?”
“I don’t understand—” Harry’s seen every memory and knows, in an academic sense, that this is true but…
Draco’s rage is a rash, and the only way to scratch is to scream and scream, but he can’t because there are a thousand eyes on him and he’s supposed to be deferent. Licking the boots of the fucking Hero, come to save the day. Again.
Harry jumps from the couch, sending Bella plunging to the floor. She yowls in protest as he sprints towards the front door, but he doesn’t have time to apologize because Malfoy is about to break into his home and the wards will not respond well to an intruder.
“And an IV,” Harry says. “Try to get an IV.” He knows it’s an ask—the twitches haven’t stopped, won’t stop. Sliding a needle neatly into a vein when it’s wriggling underneath you is no easy task.
And suddenly he’s tired. He’s so tired. Their words were sandpaper on skin. Everything was edges with Draco—sharper but beautiful too—and Harry couldn’t sand him down, could only make him bleed.
When the glimpses start to flash, polaroids of single details, of blonde hair and blue lips, Harry runs until he’s too tired to think. Uses his feet to pound himself into an exhaustion so heavy that his memory is distant and blissfully numb.
Harry taps his fingers together, finger to thumb, finger to thumb, and forces the anxious magic back down.
A strong hand latches onto his calf, stubby fingernails digging into his flesh. “What the fuck—” Draco starts, but then he falls, and he’s not sure which way the scales of fate have tipped when the back of his head cracks against the pavement and the world goes black.
“Diagnostic spell,” he said, blinking too quickly. Harry flicked his wand and cast, not needing the words to channel the magic; it was keen to obey.
“I didn’t know what was wrong. I didn’t know. If I’d known, I could’ve fixed it.” Harry turns, finally, and lets himself tip into those endless grey eyes. “A diagnostic spell and I could’ve fixed it. It didn’t have to be like this.”
Draco’s emotional free fall finds something solid in Potter’s face. He knows this face as well as he knows his own. Draco has traced his fingertips along the bridge of this nose, has pushed confessions between these lips, has watched these same eyes soften from Avada Kedavra to a summer afternoon. This world is real because Draco has seen love move across this face and knows that
“After the trial,” Harry tries again. “You just…” A fern spills out of its hanging pot, dripping onto Harry’s fingers.
“You mean that you were riding Granger’s coattails while she did all the work?” Ron chokes, but Pansy’s relentless. “I think I’ve got the dynamic figured out.”
Harry’s eyes must give his ignorance away. Flo blows out a wet sigh of frustration. “It’s right next to public health. Follow the green lines on the wall.”
“Because…because I’ve done things. Horrible things. And I don’t get to just move on. The villains don’t get a happily ever after.”
Arrow after arrow crashes into Draco’s back, but he doesn’t look up. Looking at it will only make it worse. Of course Potter is here. Was there anyone Draco had hurt more than Harry Potter? It made sense that he would want to see their old rivalry finally set to rest.
have any physical attributes—fear shouldn’t weigh heavy on the soul and shame shouldn’t have the pigment to leave a stain.
Diagon is humming with energy and September is the worst month for this, Draco realizes. All of the children who are returning to Hogwarts will be shopping for their supplies.
Somewhere, a gavel is banging away, desperate to bring the room back to order. But Draco doesn’t hear any of that.
“This is wrong,” the stranger said, but his lips were still hungry, and so Draco thought it was fine. He couldn’t be messing this up too badly.
“What is this place?” Ron asks, when Harry pushes through the heavy front door and in from the December frost.
Draco thinks and hates himself just a little more than before. Hate piling on top of hate piling on top of hate. Draco hadn’t known his self-loathing could reach such great heights.
Old magic, the kind that only exists in Pure Blood libraries and the minds of men like Voldemort and Dumbledore.
“I died,” Harry whispers. Draco probably knows this—rumours of something close to the truth had made it to the biographers, who’d picked over his life story like carrion crows and published the scraps for the world to see. “Sometimes, I feel like I’m a corpse who puts a body on every day.”
“Draco?” Harry says, rolling out of the ridiculously soft sheets. Harry needs a set of these and resolves to ask Draco once he finds him. Because he can’t be far.
Draco knows that word, recognizes it as the Muggle equivalent of a mind healer—Robertson keeps suggesting he see one. “Where are your positive affirmations? Aren’t you supposed to be a purveyor of wisdom and benediction?”
The smells hit him first, bright smells—fresh basil and mint leaves and maybe parsley? Harry’s never really been on first name terms with herbs, but he would bury his face in whatever that smell is—
Harry lets himself be led. Out of the airy living room and into a bathroom down the hall. The mirror is enormous and Harry tries not to look. He knows what he’ll see there—sadness doesn’t look good on him, makes a scarecrow of his features. “Going to get you something clean,” Draco says, pressing a towel into Harry’s hands. “I’ll be in the living room when you’re done.”
“Fiction is an excellent source of escapism,” Robertson says. He looks wise in the way that Dumbledore always had—the realization makes him queasy. “But, alas, every fictional world will come to an end and we will be forced to confront the very real troubles we’d sought to leave behind.”
“But—” Harry remembers the last time he saw Draco, remembers the blood and the white-blonde hair and the words, aimed to hurt, to harm, to bleed. “I fucked up. So badly. I’m so—”
If Harry’s heart rate increases when he sees Malfoy’s office door open, it’s the brusqueness of his pace.
But then Ron and Hermione are on him. For just a little while, the weight of their bodies and the weight of the future seems to balance, and everything feels calm.
Harry visits sixty one new universes while Hermione and Pansy plot their way into oblivion. In the middle of this madness, the cheeky owner of an old bookstore teaches Harry how to properly woo the object of his affections.
Draco had struggled to process, had stared at Potter without shame. The hair was the same—a dark weed sprouting every which way. Same arms and chin and scar. The scar still carved sharp white lines across Potter’s forehead, and Draco wondered if it was the Dark Lord who put it there. “The same program?”
Her slim shoulders, straight-backed and resilient as the Wizengamot looked down from on high. The blonde hair swaddled in blood and the blue lips—and Harry loses his grip. The war was over and no one else was supposed to die. He’d saved them, he’d tried to save them, and the story still ended with bodies and hate written in blood.
“I was high as a kite and a bit emotionally compromised when a Muggle police officer found me,” says Draco, grimacing. The memory is not a pleasant one.
,” Draco had whispered when Harry crawled into his arms after a ten-year-old had died, his limp heart in Harry’s hands.
, spat with venom and fear, blood everywhere, his body taken apart in a way that felt too violent to be real. Draco sits up, nearly screams with the pain that’s cleaved his chest into pieces.
“They take their strange form of entertainment very seriously,” Pansy says, eyes glinting as Hermione settles next to her—it’s a hungry look and Harry reminds himself to warn Ron of the dangerous and effective sexual wiles of Pansy Parkinson, which he has now seen first-hand. She’s relentless.
Harry’s world erupts into colour—a flash of vibrancy in the pan. Because Draco Malfoy is five feet away from him and the memories of their shared history burst through his carefully constructed compartmentalization.
The weight is friendly as he grips it in the pocket of his robes. Ten inches, hawthorn, a unicorn hair at the centre. As he casts the tracking spell, Draco feels his magic come home.
“How am I going to do that?” Harry yelled and his words were threaded with a secret terror. The strobe lights looked a lot like curses and they were making him dizzy.
“You’re a disaster,” Harry hears himself say, and watches himself kiss Draco’s sweaty forehead. “You’re a fucking menace.”
Back when she’d called him depressed, Harry hadn’t listened, rolling away from her concern as if it was optional. Back then, he hadn’t wanted a lesson in the ways in which he was broken. In her infinite Hermione-ness—because wisdom and Hermione were synonyms—she’d changed her tactics. Diagnostic language disappeared from her vocabulary—words like depressive episodes and behavioural activation and therapy. Rather, she was bringing her friend back to life. Simple as that.
“Well,” Draco says, wishing that he could turn away, but those green eyes pin him in place. “What if I’ve made my peace with oblivion? What if I’d rather live a hundred lives where I get—”
Narcissa is standing in the doorway to the sitting room. She’s carrying a tray of biscuits and a pot of tea in her hands.
hands that are shaking. The soft brush of silk drifts across his skin as Draco folds the tie into a clean Half Windsor. Draco lets his pinky finger drift across Harry’s neck and feels him shudder.
Harry had hovered, a spectre at the back of the room, silent as his horrific magic was set to rights.
“I’m Draco’s best friend, not yours. You’re the shit who broke his heart. I’m not supposed to be helpful to
“Draco!” Harry recognizes one of the paramedics, who’s got his head in the lap of a very pretty blonde girl.
The hedges herded him up the drive, curving with the road towards large wrought-iron gates. Harry had apparated here on a whim, the box under one arm, confessions cloying against the walls of his throat. There’d been no strategy beyond giving back the wand.
The smell of sweat had hit him as they stepped in from the cold. It’d been loud; Draco could feel his eardrums vibrating.
“I mean, he might still be angry,” Harry says and has the distinct impression that his evil cat is listening. “Wouldn’t put it past Malfoy, to play the long game. To wait until he’d gotten a leg up—” His voice breaks and Harry wants to sink into the floor. There’s a pressure behind his eyes. “I mean, I did find his dead mum. And I—” Flashes of blood staining white-blonde hair. Of his magic crackling, red and hot and totally out of control. Of blue lips and then—
Harry’s not sure if she walks or glides—does ancient magic have ten toes?—or if the platform just rearranges it’s atoms to accommodate her, but he blinks and she’s in front of him. The touch, when it’s on him again, is soft.
It’s all a dizzy mess, when the Wizengamot opens the proceedings. Draco's crimes are described in that horrible kind of detail that looks too close, and everything is huge and ugly.
Draco tries to soothe Pansy with shushing noises and promises of tea biscuits, but she will not be tamed.
“You were…” Harry struggles for the words, they’re so ridiculous. “Pulled into another universe? Really Malfoy? Couldn’t come up with anything else?”
Beneath the enormous text is a photograph that Harry would frame if Draco would let him. Harry remembers the moment from two weeks ago as clearly as if it’d been preserved in his pensieve. They’d been hiking, had popped out of the trails near a tiny town—
“Harry,” Hermione says, dangerous now. The sheer volume of what must live behind Hermione’s big brown eyes terrifies Harry sometimes—that the inside of her can be so vast. “What’s wrong?”
“I thought you would kiss me the other night,” Harry says, leaning closer. There’s no space left for fear. The inches between them are crowded with other things, and so Harry barely thinks, doesn’t hesitate.
Ron scrambles up from a stiff-backed wooden chair and crosses the room in a few lanky strides. “What’re you doing here? It’s late, isn’it?”
“He did,” Draco says, sombre, their heads barely an inch apart. They’re both grinning. “So, obviously, the comparison has to be made.”
The cold twists against the windows and misery twists behind his eyelids. If he lays still enough, if he keeps his eyes clamped shut, maybe he can crawl back through the multiverse. Find the version of Harry that is standing on the edge of a bridge, thinking about dying, and suck the hopelessness out through Harry’s mouth.
“Involving your mother.” The man delivers the line without feeling and it takes a moment for Draco to realize that
It’s almost immediate. The sharp convulsions settle. The heart rate monitor drifts back into a normal range.
Five years of mystery manifests into a man who is the same but also completely different. Malfoy is a verb that has been conjugated, by time and loss.
They’re both yelling now. They always escalate. Always heat so fast. Too hot to touch, too hot to soothe. “And what about when I tried to explain!”
The posh twat had come to collect Harry at 10:01, a bottle of wine in hand, and quite literally dragged him away from his files. Harry’d been distracted by how Malfoy’s fingers had tightened around his upper arm—warm, insistent, like a brand. And then he’d looked up at Malfoy himself, and it had sent his whole body into emergency conditions.
Flo glares at him and somehow manages to make it both scathing and pitying. “Son, just wait until tomorrow. Draco’s never out sick. He’ll be in tomorrow.”
The question is genuine. Harry is struggling to remember which letter goes with which number, and the process of composing a message is painfully slow. Draco, however, answers like he has lightening in his digits.
“Let’s chase it with something tastier,” Pansy says, her eyes following the same halter-top and curly brown hair into a hundred dancing bodies.
For a moment, Harry struggles, because this is the same woman who’d stood up in the Great Hall and offered him to Voldemort. This strained, blunted woman, who looks less like a pure blood bride and more like a sketch done in charcoal. She’s barely recognizable. “Sorry, but you’re not exactly—like—you’re not my friend,” Harry says, feeling awkward.
The room is dark but for the orange glow of the streetlamp, but Harry can see. He can see Draco let his joggers slip down past his hips. Egyptian cotton is a soft caress as his shoulder blades sink into the sheets.
“It doesn’t have to make sense,” Draco says, and he looks so soft in his joggers that Harry wants to cry again.
Because Harry had tried. As he sat next to the living-corpse that had once been Narcissa Malfoy, waiting for her son to arrive at St. Mungo’s, Harry had gone over what he would say. How he would apologize. And then Malfoy had shown up and they hadn’t spoken, not really. Everything had blown up in a fit of rage and a sadness so raw that the world curdled around it. They had never used their words to treat each other kindly.
“Young people are not familiar with the bard. It’s criminal! But tell me,” Robertson says, grin violent. “How long did it take for this feud to mature into something more romantic?”
“Will this consideration include actually reading the proposals I place on your desk?” Draco says, weaving condescension and politeness together with the deft muscles of his tongue.
“Did you want to talk about it?” John asks, tilting his head to the side and meeting Draco’s eyes in a way that is so much like Potter that Draco wants to punch something.
Somewhere, Harry is sure that the rest of the patrons are moaning their disapproval, but the glint in Draco’s eye is every good thing distilled to a single moment. “You’re the one who exposed me to these spicey ladies.”
Draco breathes in the smell of the world around him and pushes the memories away. Used books and damp umbrellas. The wizarding world may not want him but “I’m here,” Draco whispers. “I’m still here.”
“Let’s all just stop yelling?” Hermione says, stepping between them. “We all want the same things. Why don’t we all just work together?”
The yowls that rend the air sound like the mouth of hell grinding open. “Bella, if you don’t stop, I’m going to feed you kale for a week.” It’s an empty threat and Bella, who’s blinking up at Harry with those enormous pupils, knows it too.
Harry is still dizzy, still sleeping, still wandering through dreams and memories, and he needs to stop. Needs to breathe. The plotting and the yelling and the chatter is filling his head with cotton balls. “I’m gonna step out. Pick up some takeaway,” Harry says into the chaos, and when Hermione dismisses him with a wave of her hand, Harry’s relief huffs out of him in a rush.
“Oh fuck off,” Draco says, rolling into the pathetic excuse for a pillow. “Why am I here? Wait.” Draco tries to scowl, but finds his face rather soggy. “A better question. Why are you here.”
“Potter! Have you been to see the kid in trauma bay 4?” Dr. Horwood says from somewhere, and Harry cranes his neck trying to find her.
The memory inside his head isn’t much better. There were flashes, of Narcissa’s hands on his face, cold against his chest.
, the sign reads. Harry can’t remember the last time he read a Muggle novel, and yet something about the store calls to him. The entire building could be under a cheering charm and the haphazard piles in the display window remind him of Hermione’s table at the library during exams. The sight makes him grin and he’s inside before he has a chance to think twice.
Slow, determined breaths to remind his lungs that they knew what to do and that he wasn’t dying. Not again. Not now. Not yet.
Harry opens his mouth to correct him, but the way that Draco looks just then, Harry swears that he could see through him if he angled his head just the right way. As if Draco is more reflection than man.
“Yes, he did,” Hermione said, all of her feelings about Malfoy collecting in the furrow between her brow. Harry watched it smooth over. “I’m going to need to locate the transcripts from the original trials, just to see if there’s any legal precedent for charging a minor with high crimes and misdemeanors…”
Draco is lost in the multiverse and Harry is going to find him—even if it costs everything he has and is and was.
They stayed until the gaming café closed, dizzy with vodka coolers and drunk on a good mood. Pansy flirted shamelessly, and Draco was sure he would die at the hands of a brutish looking man, who reminded him forcibly of Goyle.
“I will ruin you next time, weasel,” Draco had promised, wine glass sloshing as Ron snorted violent good humour. “I was going easy on you. For Potter’s sake, obviously. How callous would it be to trounce his best mate so thoroughly? No. I’ll get you next time,” Draco had promised, two spots of red glowing on his cheeks.
“F—fuck—” Draco stutters, and it doesn’t matter what universe they’re in, Harry flinches at the fear in his voice. It’s instinct. Harry rushes forwards, reaches for Draco as he collapses in a pile of pain and surprise, but Harry’s hands pass straight through him.
Like everything with them, it isn’t easy. Draco is pricklier than razer wire and more potent than undiluted bobtuber puss. He spends far too much time on his facial routine and sings Muggle pop songs loud enough to wake the neighbours. He has an unhealthy relationship with house his plants—which Bella loathes on principle and maims in protest. The screaming matches between man and feline are battles for the ages. Sometimes, on bad days, Draco insists on searching Harry’s face, holding him still and running his long fingers over skin and bone, looking for something that only he can see.
Harry spent most of the days after the Battle of Hogwarts on the couch at Grimmauld. Dark halls, moldy drapes, and one very distressed house elf kept him company. Harry hadn’t really thought much of it until Ron and Hermione came over one day, and he realized the mountain of pizza boxes was approaching human height.
are offered in a halting explanation, but Draco doesn’t really hear it. It’s almost as if the shock of it, of the words
Draco tries to shrug it off. Tries to weaponize his nonchalance. “Oh, it’s nothing really. I just…” He breathes in. Once. Twice.  “The curse I cast on myself—the effects make absolutely no sense. It wasn’t supposed to work like this—”
It hadn’t worked. Hysterical “Harry Potters!” would greet him at every door, followed by either clingy fans or bitter looks at Harry and his train of admirers.
“It’s not! You’re all so—” Pansy stands beneath the massive front door, mouthing insults into the dark. “So Gryffindor!” she says, finally. “Stop it with the needless dramatics and get the fuck inside.”
“Are you trying to torture me?!” Pansy says, looking at the device in the middle of Draco’s ballroom with open suspicion.
Draco closes up for the day without a glimpse of the Chosen One and hopes that he hasn’t forgotten to lock something important. He’s never lingered in a glimpse so long before, and for just a moment, the words of the Curse flit across his mind’s eye. “
“Right.” Malfoy’s eyes are all over his face. Harry’s cheeks go up in flames. “There’s really no need to run away from me.”
“Hermione?” he shouts again. The days have smudged together and Harry realizes he has no idea if it’s a weekday or weekend, if it’s morning, afternoon, or evening. The last time he looked at a clock is ancient history, and he paces through the entrance, the kitchen, the giant dining room table in a daze.
“That shouldn’t be allowed,” Draco said, too stunned to filter. “Human civilization should refuse to colonize spaces so hideously inhospitable.”
It’s late, and some detached part of Harry can hear the traffic humming its approval—the part that remembers to breathe.
“I should’ve known,” Draco whispers. The fury is violent, Harry’s ears are ringing with it. He’s not supposed to hear this, Harry knows, but he does. Draco mutters under his breath and Harry hears him say, “You’ll never love me in this universe.”
Pansy elbows him in the ribs. “Would you fuck off with the wallowing for two seconds? I think you just put them under your tongue, but I’ll text Angelica to confirm. She’s quite shady. Perhaps we should set her up with sketchy Greg. She’ll definitely know what to do.”
“Are you—” someone laughs behind them, and Draco flinches, bites his lip, carries on. “Are you sure? That you want this?”
There’s a bit of steamy content to open this chapter. Just a gentle reminder that there will be explicit-ish scenes in this fic ;)
Draco can do nothing but follow, swept up in a haze of instinct and pleasure. One and two and three, and he slams the last one down with a growl. “Disgusting!” he wheezes, the burn still hot on his throat.
“I’m not lying!” Draco looks so upset, his lovely hair matted with the rain and the stress of his hands in it, that Harry wants to believe him.
“He asked me,” Harry says on a heavy exhale, too tired to feel stupid for missing all of the signs, “if I could see him. Always seemed surprised.”
“Balcony,” Harry says, mind skittering over a memory of Draco’s hand on his chin, pulling his face close, and beathing hot smoke across his lips. He’d looked so calm, leaning into the night. “Let’s try the balcony.”
“I suppose being the Chosen One affords you advantages the rest of us can only dream of.” Each word is a tiny cut. “One call to Shacklebolt and I’m sure you could have had any job you wanted.”
“Right!” Harry says, grabbing the clipboards from query-Megan’s hands and flipping through the charts. The fluorescent lights are a food lamp, baking everyone alive.
“It’s a gaming café, Ronald,” Hermione says, unwrapping an enormous scarf from her neck and setting her hair loose on the softly lit interior. “It says so above the door. You know, for an auror, your observational skills—”
“In which case, I need to revisit the meaning of this entire song. As a metaphorical conceit, it may be rather brilliant. Let’s listen to it one more time—”
“You were dreaming about domestic bliss with the fucking ferret,” Ron says, but there’s no anger in it. Harry, who hadn’t expected his friends to take this so well, feels the urge to overcompensate.
Draco sniffs. His nose is running but he’s not got the energy for embarrassment just now. John hands him a small tissue box.
Grudgingly, despairing of his head strong tendencies and refusal to listen to his mother, Narcissa had relented. If they were going to take their first step back into a public space, they would do it together.
“And you’re a villain,” she says, collapsing onto the couch. Draco knows he’ll find her there, mascara smudged, the sparkles of her eyeshadow dusting her cheeks, beautiful in that fallen-angel sort of way that Pansy is so good at.
“—to discuss it, yes yes, so you’ve said. Every time I’ve raised suggestions for departmental improvements. I’m familiar with the ways in which you placate my initiatives.”
“A bit gay!” Harry blurts, and immediately wants to stuff the words back in his mouth. Malfoy’s eyes stretch with surprise.
“Oh, come on. I know you’re secretly dying to hear those Spicey Girls again. I know how you look up to the Posh one.”
When Draco had arrived at the restaurant, the idiot had looked up at him with interest. With something heated and filled with potential and Draco had thought, this might not have been a bad idea after all.
The music was softer outside, muted like the sound waves were travelling underwater. A remix of fucking Celestina Warbeck’s
“No. No he mentioned something about universes after he disappeared the night we…” Harry chokes on the memory of how each and every one of his dreams had crystalized into something so intense, so perfect. They’d gotten something so right, just that once—
A tattoo, dark on his pale forearm. Flowers lazily wrapping their leaves around a faded skull, weaving in between the snake and distorting something monstrous into something changed.
“Of course, in this universe. What the fuck are you on about?” Pansy ignores him, jumps to her feet and starts to scramble at the mess on the floor. At first, Harry thinks she’s tidying the room, and guilt forces him to his feet.
It was as his mind self-flagellated and his tear ducts refused to release that the curse came for him.
The foot on his neck presses harder, and Draco chokes. A puff of dust explodes around his mouth, into his eyes. “Hurry! It’s Malfoy. He’s here!”
On his way back to the fireplace he finds a note taped to the top of the hearth, written in a hurry.
spend a lot of time in A&E as it turned out. Malfoy, who never rolled his sleeves up far enough for Harry to make sense of the tattoo peeking out at the cuffs. Malfoy, whose eyes went so soft when he was counselling, who Harry’d watched de-escalate a three-hundred-pound monster of a man with a cigarette and a touch on the elbow. Who Harry spent quite a lot of his shift staring at and spent the rest of his shift trying to avoid.
“Draco Malfoy is probably going to spend the next five to ten years in Azkaban,” Hermione said, looking down at the article, her sharp eyes flying across the newsprint.
“Sod off,” Pansy says, dragging the brush over her big toenail. “You’re just cranky because I reminded you that you get pulled into different worlds on the regular.”
The sky is grey, so late it’s early and Harry’s sore and drunk on gratification he finally got to have. The air feels thick with what they’ve done. “I dreamt about you too. In a way,” Draco says. “I’ve never stopped.”
Harry’d thought that nothing could disturb him more than a sex dream about Draco Malfoy; he’d been wrong.
“Not where people can see,” he’d said. Malfoy had recoiled as if slapped. “Not where people can see.”
“I—” Draco says, and Harry’s entire world is cropped down to a single moment. This moment. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“We were supposed to live,” he says, closes his eyes and lifts his head to the sky. Those moments after the trial, when he’d held her and said “we’re going to live” and she’d wiped her cheeks and said that she supposed that they would. Draco feels his grief and guilt stream down his cheeks. “But that future’s gone now.”
“There’s a mental health patient waiting for assessment,” she (Megan?) (all of the nurses here seem to be named Megan) says, and Harry tries to nod, but someone
Harry turns back, a split second of a look. His eyes are hollow, cheekbones a closed door. There are no tears—not here, where people could see the display, not ever with Potter—but there is something like tragedy in the furrow between his brows.
The electronic doors open and close, open and close as Harry stands just a bit too close. He knows he should just go home, to his empty fucking house and force his evil cat to love him just a little. He knows that’s what he
“Right,” Harry says, but he’s not listening. Harry's lost control of the pace and content of his inner monologue, and so hasn't stopped thinking,
But what if there had been? What would the world have looked like if Potter had been less angry and Draco had been less scared?
“You’ve not forgotten about the musical adjustments you’re going to make, have you?” Pansy asks, dark eyes brimming.
It strikes Harry just then how difficult this all must be for Draco. Being thrust into different worlds, with no advance notice of who he’s supposed to be or what’s waiting for him. It’s a dangerous game, and Draco could refuse to play. He could let the blood flow from his veins and never raise a wand in protest, could throw Harry into the forgotten fields of snow and drive off into the northern lights, and it wouldn’t change anything. Not in their timeline.
“There used to be peacocks,” Pansy says as Hermione prepares the ritual. She leans over the railing, her feet lifting from the ground a little as she pitches forward. The wind is gentle in her hair. “There was this white one that always bit my fingers. Draco loved that stupid bird.”
Names dance behind Draco’s eyes, unzipping into letters. It’s a beautiful blur and, for a moment, Draco doesn’t think about last night. Pansy Parkinson was a menace—filled with optimism and terrible plots to improve his mood—and Draco would not wallow in self pity. He wouldn’t.
“This is beginning to feel like a bad idea,” Draco says out of the corner of his mouth. Draco did not have his wand—Potter hadn’t returned it that day at his trial. Even if he had, Draco couldn’t have used it. The terms of his probation included a strict list of spells that he could use for one full year after his sentencing—none of which were offensive. Draco had been using his mother’s wand to apparate to work every day, but was permitted little else. Narcissa was bound by the same restrictions. If either of them cast a single spell to defend themselves, they would be sent straight to Azkaban.
“It would be so simple,” Harry says, and his voice loses its focus, goes dreamy and listless. “One foot, and then another, and then you just let it all go.”
“That’s right. I have them every Friday for lunch and I will not have them pilfered by greedy little shop boys.”
Draco’s not sure how long he’s lingered here, chasing the horizon, as if the highway is the stray end of a cassette tape that needed to be rewound.
It’s never happened again—not since he’d stood on the edge of a field of yellow and Harry had come for him, but Draco’s sure that she’s been back. Sure that he’s felt the cool fingers on his forehead, the touch tender as his mother’s, sure that he’s heard the soft whisper as he drifts into sleep.
Harry had flown through the gaping wound where the entrance had been, his own wand out, his magic skittering across his skin.
“I know I know!” Harry says, searching for the source of the noise, but only because it rings again and again and again.
and it became a post war anthem. Anger was in the water and the temperature of the entire world was set blood to boil.
“Yes,” Draco says, as if he can’t believe it. “Whatever you want. Anything,” he says and then pushes into Harry. It’s slow and hot and Harry’s head falls back into the pillow. He lets out a breath he’s been holding his whole life.
The seconds measure in the drip drip onto the pavement. Harry’s eyes flit from the crime scene on the steps to the door as it flies open.
“I’d like to volunteer,” he’d finally squawked, his arms full of Marlowe and Dickens. “I’ve got some community service hours and I’d like to do them at your shop.”
“I…” Draco tries. He does. But the words don’t want to come. It’s such an enormous thing, his grief. Catastrophic in the sheer size, like he’s swallowed the entire countryside and is trying to contain it in his guts. “I’ve made a lot of mistakes. And…” Draco’s throat is closing. “And someone I loved…they got hurt. Permanently.”
“She’s gone,” Draco yells—he knows he’s yelling, but he can’t stop. Potter pulls him close, holds his arms still and lets Draco shudder into his chest.
His embarrassment is incalculable. Draco has absolutely nothing to say. No explanation. So he just stands there. Staring at her. Daring her to laugh.
Draco snaps his chin up and faces her. “If I go to Azkaban?” His words are still shrill, but the edges are sharp. Like glass in a shattered window. “If all of the wizarding world takes one look at me and what I’ve done and realizes that I
“Oh, right. Draco,” she says, pinching the bridge of her nose. The old fake leather of her office chair is peeling. “I’m sorry, who are you?”
“What? What happened? Where is she?” Draco needs to find her, needs to make sure that she’s alright.
The angst was always going to come in twos. Two chapters, one past and one present, where the story dips low. Hold on, friends <3
“I know,” Hermione says, that expression still playing across her face. This was dangerous; Hermione was dangerous.
“I’m not ashamed,” Harry says, wanting to retreat from this plunge into vulnerability, but trapped by a wall of teetering books. “It’s just—he was kind of my nemesis?”
It came for him the night after his trial. He’d lay, curled up into the smallest version of himself, wishing that he could muster a few tears. Was crying the appropriate response? Should he have clapped his hands in celebration of the shiny new future he now had access too? A single act of benevolence from Potter, something he probably barely thought about, had changed the trajectory of Draco’s entire future; the charity would probably haunt Draco for the rest of his life.
Draco cocks his head to the side, looks the man up and down. Bulging biceps flex and angry eyes narrow.
“Do you have anything meaningful to contribute?” says Pansy, but she’s too sad to be properly angry.
“A lot of things have changed,” Draco says and Harry can feel the weight of it, of the shared history. “Let’s talk about anything else. Literally anything else. Just not
“You’re a menace,” Draco says, but goes. His heart is pounding and there’s sweat dripping down his back.
“Don’t worry about it.” Pansy pats Draco on the head. “But you’ll want to drink at least two of those in preparation.”
“Depends?” Draco says, and he does not like the way not-Potter is looking at him. The glint in his eye is suspicious.
Harry peels his heavy eyes open and sees Bella, who has settled next to his face, two tiny paws resting between her enormous head. With obvious trepidation, she is leaning in, a tiny pink tongue licking the tears from his cheeks.
“He sang this,” Pansy insists, panting and flushed, as she collapses back into her chair next to them. “When he was pining after you!”
It’s fortunate, then, that closed doors can’t keep out ghostly intruders. Harry passes through the heavy wood without a second thought and finds Draco, splayed open on the floor.
Draco panics, reaches for words to hurl, to force Potter to keep his distance. “Wasn’t enough to cut me open,” Harry flinches, “and then sew me up again. Can’t resist returning to the crime scene.”
Harry’s kneeling next to an older man, the hard plastic of the clipboard pressed against his knees. He’s shirtless and Harry’s eyes drift over the loose folds of aging skin.
Harry, though, never came, leaving Draco to fuss about the Apothecary, half-aroused and very confused. At least his potion-making prowess had carried over into other worlds. Draco scanned the walls, admired the clean bottles, the diverse options he offered his customers. A large piece of parchment hung over the ancient register—Draco can’t help but think of Robertson. In an elegant flourish, the words
The moonlight is filtering through Malfoy’s fucking eyelashes and Harry can’t quite focus. “I don’t like Emma—” and there’s nothing for it, “or women, much, anymore.”
“I suppose we are,” she says, breathy. “Now, pull yourself together. It’s far too cold to be weeping in the middle of the lane.”
February is melting into March, but the night still bites at his neck, nips the tips of his fingers. The tight leather coat he’d worn because Pansy insisted it made him look “tragic and fuckable” was not at all warm.
“No,” Draco says. “Maybe when I was sixteen. But things...change.” Draco sighs and it’s forever on the exhale.
Malfoy snorts and it’s so undignified that Harry forgets to be angry and just gapes. “Then why, pray tell, are you standing in front of my office?”
There was no distance to close and Draco’s lips are on him and for the first time in his life, it’s enough. This moment, right here and now, is enough.
, and Harry can’t believe it. Not when Draco rolls his hips against his, and he goes from aching to impossibly hard. Not when he leans in, blond hair falling into his eyes, and Harry brushes it away. With two fingers. Like it’s nothing. Not when Draco holds him, just holds him still and beneath him, and pulls Harry’s bottom lip between his teeth.
“Do you remember sketchy Greg?” Draco asks, trying to keep his voice light and this conversation as far away from the grief that’s writhing at the centre of him.
“She was talking to the wall with her ass cheeks hanging out when I got here,” Megan says, nibbling at the paper rim of her coffee cup. “We get all sorts, don’t we?”
It’s been ten days. Harry is wearing a path into the hardwood and has been all day. Bella is yowling and wreaking havoc on his Quidditch paraphernalia, and Draco still hasn’t come back.
“A mobile unit will divert unnecessary patients from A&E. Which saves you huge sums of money, because in Emergency, you are paying several staff to address the patient’s needs. Reception, nursing, Lab, physicians. Mental health.”
Beside him, Harry makes a soft sound in his sleep and shuffles closer, pressing his sweaty heat to Draco’s chest.
“Hi Harry the resident,” the blonde girl says, giggling. Harry giggles too, basking in the anonymity like he’s sunbathing on a beach. It’s intoxicating.
“He’s…” Harry’s throat struggles for a moment, the words sticking like a wish bone. “He’s bloody brilliant at it. Like, really fucking good.”
“Thank you,” his mother says, breaking the silence. Narcissa’s lips are a thin line and her face looks like sour milk, but she’s not hurt.
“This is nice,” Harry says, letting his eyes move over Malfoy’s Adam’s apple, up his chin, over his closed eyelids.
“Oh for fuck’s sake. What have you done?” All of Pansy’s play has fallen away. She’s seriousness and certainty and Draco knows better than to skimp on the details.
The melancholy creeps like black mould. Draco knows he should fight it off—scrub his internal machinations with positivity or optimism—but he just can’t muster the energy.
For a split second, Pansy’s face twists in agony. Pain on his behalf. But she has always known what he needs, and he’s never needed her pity.
Understanding had roared through him, then. Eventually, this spell would kill him—peel him away until there wasn’t anything left.
“The maniac grabbed me,” says Draco, but his words fizzle on the way out. He’s too tired to be angry.
They were on the wrong side of the road and Potter had an accent and it was all building to a very large panic in Draco’s chest.
was defined under subsection e. of the list of appropriate activities for rehabilitative interventions and so Draco’s form outlining the hours and duties was approved without further scrutiny.
When Harry had come to, had managed to blink the white spots and the red from his eyelids, Narcissa lay beside him, hair still stained, lips still blue, and her mouth opening and closing in a silent scream that tore Harry’s heart out through his throat.
The mania in those lovely grey eyes stretches wide. “I didn’t want to leave,” Draco says, still in his coat, still in his shoes. “It wasn’t on purpose.”
“I got tired of waiting. Really Potter. I only gave you the memories because I thought you were a man of action.”
. This was the earliest time stamp and he picks up the vial and peers through the clear liquid. As he stares at the faded ink, Harry realizes that he knows this date. It was the day of Malfoy’s trial.
The stranger does not look fine. “My friend is trying to teach me how to be more…outgoing? I’m fucking awful at it.”
“Sorry,” Harry says, and realizes he’s whispering—that’s he’s been whispering the entire time, like he’s at a funeral and to speak loudly would disturb the grief.
For a moment, Harry can’t breathe. A small panic is brewing in his chest, but he needs to reply, because if he leaves it too long, Draco will know and that thought makes the small panic feel much bigger.
Draco apparates to St. Mungo's and comes face to face with a grief so incalculably vast that he wants to skip this universe, thank you very much. Perhaps he can slip onto another track, start anew in a world where his mother isn't dead and Harry Potter doesn't look at him like
“Here!” someone says, a stranger with sandy brown hair and an angry mouth. He’s above Draco, his boot pressing hard against Draco’s windpipe. “I’ve got one.”
Later, sweaty and sticky and utterly sated, Draco feels the world sway to the beat of Harry’s sleep-steady breaths. For years, Draco had stared up at the ceiling, much like he is now, yearning to sleep for the possibility of another universe.
“It looks to me like you’ve wandered off the beaten path,” a voice booms, and for a moment Harry thinks there’s a speaker system connected overhead. The tones reverberate in the air, fill up the corners.
Harry leaned across the cab, moved so far into his space all Draco could see were irises green as a killing curse.
Harry can feel Draco nodding, but can’t look at him. “He wasn’t even important. Not really. I didn’t know him, he wasn’t a regular patient. He wasn’t a friend. He was just a nice man who died.”
“You refuse to speak for nearly two hours,” a voice said and then Draco was looking up into those stupid green eyes that could only ever belong to one person. “And
“Didn’t really think it through and now the consequences are a touch more…enormous? than I originally anticipated.”
It’s only once Harry’s decided that no clues to Draco’s whereabouts can be found at the hospital (approximately seven days post fight) that Harry starts to apparate to the street in front of Draco’s flat. It’s not really that bad, Harry convinces himself, because it’s what an auror would do. And Draco’s essentially a missing person. Harry’s just a concerned citizen. What he’s doing is a public service, if nothing else.
“So, Malfoy really said that he’d been dragged into another universe?” Hermione says, staring quizzically into her tea.
“Pansy, I knew you had a bit of a crush in fifth year, but I’d really thought we’d moved past this—”
“And I thought…” Draco tries to push on, but vulnerability has never come easily. “I thought it may show me if…if I’m irredeemably evil?”
The night air hits Harry’s cheeks and chases away the tension. He can breathe. Malfoy releases Harry’s fingers and eases into a damp lawn chair. Deft fingers pry the cork of the wine bottle free.
“Draco?” Harry says, and it hurts to look at him. The green suit had been a terrible idea, because his love for this man is seeping from his retinas and it hurts, to love like this.
For the first time that day, Draco looks up. Sees that Harry is staring at him, green eyes wild and alive and focused. He’s always wanted those eyes on him. And now that he has them, Draco feels naked and very much not enough.
The day moves slow, a road trip to nowhere, and the combination of a serious lack of sleep and a  marathon of reality television melts the finer points into mush. Which may help explain why it takes him so long to notice the persistent thumping coming from the hall.
Two heads practically rubbing together, Hermione says, “You did say that Harry loved him. In every other universe.”
Draco’s jaw starts to quiver, but this is not the venue for vulnerability. Teeth clenched tight enough to shatter, Draco manages a quick nod.
And Harry…well, the calculus of who owes whom, of how much regret and remorse adds up to something that balanced is messing with his head. They’re dancing and Harry is dizzy with life debts and Fiendfyre. Malfoy had stomped on his face and Harry had flayed him in a bathroom. Malfoy had let Death Eaters into Hogwarts and Harry had…
“Thanks.” The world feels like a top that just won’t stop spinning. “How much has she told you?” Harry asks, pressing his palms into his eyelids and squeezing out a groan.
“You’re really not gonna believe this,” and Harry tells her. About that first day in A&E and about the way Draco moved, in and out of a crisis as if he was built for it.
Potter takes an unsteady step away from Draco, shouts something towards the door, startles the world back into its linear progression.
The night ends six hours later with a body, naked and cold on a stretcher. One of the nurses is washing him, handling his limbs gently as they move cloth over skin. “I’m lifting up your arm now, Michael. Not to worry.” Not everyone talks to the bodies as they’re cleaning them, getting them ready for transport to the morgue. It’s a kindness, to wash the bodies.
“Waiting will not improve the situation,” his mother says beside him. People have already noticed them. The news of Draco and Narcissa Malfoy is a flock of birds taking off, as the word seems to spread.
There’d been no avoiding it. To transfer the portion of the Malfoy fortune required by the Ministry and fulfill the terms of Narcissa’s sentence, she had to sign. In person. Goblins were old fashioned like that—refused to accept anything less.
A nod tells him she understands, and they march up the lane, sombre as if they’d been carrying a casket between them. Pallbearers for their happily ever after.
, Harry thinks as scrawls his mobile number onto a post it that’s crumpled from several weeks spent in a pocket.
That, more than anything else, had been the problem with Daniel. He represented possibility. The possibility that someone could look at him with affection rather than loathing, that he could be loved.
He’d only seen Malfoy a handful of times. Once, bizarrely, had been at a wizarding night club once, a couple of weeks after the trial. There had always been an air of untouchability about Malfoy; his shirts were too crisp, his demeanour too cutting to engage in something so common as dancing. Socializing with the proletariat, and Muggles to boot, had never seemed very
“Semantics?” Harry says, squinting in an effort to see her more clearly. He’s without his glasses, and the world is crystal around her, but her edges are infinite. “Seems kind of an important distinction.”
“I tried to fix it,” Draco says. “To fix whatever’s wrong with me. Whatever I’ve done to fuck up this entire universe.”
Ropson answers the question with a pitying look and nothing more. There are men in red and lime green robes standing outside one of the rooms up ahead and Draco realizes that this is their destination. The world comes to him through a hospital filter—itchy eyes and exhaustion, manic movements and sterility.
The smell of a million printed letters floats with the dust motes, light filtering through the thick scent of a story. If the display looked cramped and haphazard, the interior is disorder magnified by a factor of ten.
Potter wouldn’t. “Get back in the car,” says Draco, trying for a drawl but it comes out thready and scared.
“Me too.” Pansy’s head falls onto Draco’s shoulder and he realizes that this is what he has to lose. “Me too.”
Harry stands in the entranceway until his toes get cold. A part of him hopes that Draco will come back, that Harry will throw the door open and press that lovely blond head tight against his chest, and that everything will be forgiven.
The single white eye blinks and this world bleeds into the next and the next. Everything smudges into shaking fists pounding Harry’s body, a firm hand on his chin, smoke and the soft brush of lips.
Seeing Malfoy had to have triggered some kind of autonomic response—it was his subconscious, that’s all. It was his subconscious that was obsessed with having or being by Malfoy—Harry didn’t care which it was, not when it was with
,” and then, voice hoarse but magnified a thousand times, “POTTER!” Longing and something softer twists Harry’s intestines into knots.
In his quest for enlightenment—which included but was not limited to the nuances of what the Muggles call Pop Culture—Draco had purchased the strange box as well as a stack of circular disks.
“Draco and I have been completing our Muggle education,” Pansy said, licking the top of her hand and sprinkling it with some salt.
“Nope. You don’t get to come into my house and judge me,” Harry says, leaning against the wall in the entranceway. “Say whatever you came to say, Malfoy, and leave. You’re good at that.”
Draco looks over his shoulder, sees the white and blue bleaching the night, and slips his mobile back into his pocket. “This,” he says, “can’t be good.”
“You’ve heard the rumours,” Draco says, trying to fend off his embarrassment. “And mother confirmed it. He died Pansy. He walked into a forest knowing he was going to die.”
“Come back with me.” Harry’s creeping forward, and Draco remembers St. Mungo’s and how Harry had walked into his violence then too. “You don’t belong here.”
, Draco thought, and then decided not to ask. That there was no point in seeing how horrible the Malfoys could be in another iteration of the world.
Hermione had reached across the counter and, with the caution with which one would approach a wild animal, had taken his hand. “I know it is.”
A waifish woman stumbles into the hallway, her sharp bob streaked with premature grey. “Congratulations on an—an excellent performance review, Draco,” she says, a bit uneven on her feet.
“—that this version of me is the worst version. I am the darkest timeline.” Draco can’t look at her. Not when he’s being this pathetic.
Together, his hands clasped, his chin held high, he follows Harry through the doors and into the light. Draco faces his future with Harry Potter holding on to him, refusing to let go.
“Was he talking to a cabbage?” someone says, and Draco starts at the sound. At some point during this bizarre exchange, a customer must’ve entered the store.
His first instinct is to dial Hermione, and he has her number half-programmed into his mobile before he thinks better of it. Whatever thing had happened between him and Malfoy, Harry’s not ready to put it to words, and so he tries to drown the gaping chasm of
Harry glances at the clock on the mantle. It’s just past ten. Draco’s shifts usually ends at ten, which means he came straight here—
“In another, I keep my balance. And live. I don’t think I care one way or another,”  he says and finds he means it. He really means it. Draco’s head is buzzing, with traffic and Jäger.
For a moment, Harry hesitates. It all feels so foreign, like a virus has snuck into the normal equilibrium of his life and infected all of his healthy cells. “Hermione, I’ve fucked up,” he says, vision bleary from exhaustion, attention still wandering through other worlds. “You were right. Draco actually
Hermione’s campaign to Get Harry Out of the House had been in full swing. She and Ron were somewhere in the mess of bodies. They’d abandoned him and were probably in a corner somewhere, making out, but not before Ron had clapped him on the back and shouted, “Go find a nice looking witch!”
for anyone who wanted the excruciating details of his inadequacy. It had been years since the Yule ball, and yet here he was, doing a twisted sort of dance with Draco Malfoy.
“Go see a mindhealer?” Ron had suggested, and then Seamus had collapsed across Harry’s legs and spilled a full pint into his lap. Ron had laughed even harder and Harry had thrown his head back in despair and they hadnever spoken of it again.
The sky has started to spit, messy drops of rain turning the pavement dark, when he finally sees him. Draco would never mistake those shoulders, that shock of dark hair. There’s a bridge up ahead; Harry’s heading straight for it and Draco follows.
“I could just apparate into his flat,” Harry says to an imaginary audience. “I mean, he’s invited me before. And he could be in trouble.” Deep in his guts, Harry knows it’s wrong, understands that he’s blasting a giant selfish hole in Draco’s boundaries, recognizes that he’s reverted fully to the obsessive behaviours of sixth year, but he can’t find it within himself to care.
“Yeah,” Harry huffs, watery eyes a bit slow to process. “What the fuck, Hermione? Why are you working with—”
But Draco doesn’t feel distressed. He feels tired and wonderfully indifferent. Light. Draco wonders if this was why Potter had returned to this spot, over and over; the journey had looked well-worn.
For a moment, Harry is frozen in place, filled with a violent urge to grab hold of Draco and just hold him still. Under Harry’s hands, where he can make sense of him. But Malfoy is moving into the warmth and Harry, helpless and confused and chasing the heat of Draco’s lips, follows.
“This isn’t just mucking around with time turners, although that would be bad enough.” Pansy’s shriek is in full form.  “You’re seriously playing with…with the whole universe…”
Pansy snorts into her cocoa. “He hasn’t shut up about it. Weeks, Potter. I’ve had to listen to him moaning on about you for weeks.”
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but Potter wasn’t done. “Even if you were…” The wind rose, twisted around them, sent shivers cascading across Draco’s flesh. “Even if you’ve fucked up and carry guilt around like some cross to bear.” Harry was so close. Draco could feel the warmth of Harry’s breath on his frozen cheeks. “That doesn’t mean you can’t have nice things.”
“Hamlet is a tragic hero, Draco. Perhaps the most tragic, although I’m sure that some would disagree, citing Lear or Othello, but they would be spouting nonsense of the most questionable calibre.”
“He’s said he had to fix something,” Pansy gasps from her spot on the floor amongst all of Hermione’s papers and theories. “What if it was Potter?”
“We think that the your dreams will establish a connection. Think about this collection of universes less as a list and more as a wheel,” Hermione says, gesturing absently at an image in one of the books on the floor. “You’re at the centre, Harry.”
“Because…” Honesty was a knot; Harry had the end and he’d pulled. “Because I’ve done things. Horrible things. And I don’t get to just move on. The villains don’t get a happily ever after.”
“I—” Harry starts, but then it hits him. Blue lips, blonde hair. The sound of the dead breathing the same air. “Oh god.”
The sobs that come are dry and heaving. For a long time, Harry can’t breathe, can only gasp past the tightness, dry eyes making a mockery of his grief.
Harry comes with Draco Malfoy inside of him, green eyes meeting grey, pinned in place by desire that’s raw and desperate and
“Hermione.” Harry’s suddenly tired beyond reckoning. “You can’t be serious. Malfoy didn’t disappear into another universe. I’ve never even heard of a spell that can do that.”
“We’re still not sure how they breached the wards,” one of the aurors goes on. There’s blood, dried in a strange shape across Potter’s chest. As if he’d pressed something tight against and refused to let go.
Harry hadn’t understood how something could be too good, too much. A desire that makes Harry’s bones ache—as if flowers are about to burst from the marrow.
The photograph replays the moment of intimacy over and over. A bark of laughter throws the doors of Harry’s face wide open and there’s a smile half swallowed behind Draco’s serious mouth. Harry can’t remember what he’d been laughing at; it doesn’t matter, really.
Robertson had winked at him. “Of course you can work here!” he bellowed—with stomach and gusto and Draco had nearly fallen over. “It will add some variety to the mundanity of my every day, if nothing else.”
Potter is not at the Black House, nor is he at the ministry or the pub. The tracking magic tugs him out of Wizarding London and deeper and deeper into the Muggle world. Not for the first time, Draco is struck by how large the Muggle world is. He has lived for months with Muggles and there are still so many streets he doesn’t know, so many neighbourhoods he’s never seen and places he hasn’t heard of.
His magic—which jumped and rushed these days, tended to overflow when his emotions started to shudder—burnt through him. The shadowy din of the ballroom erupted into a white light and Harry felt his star explode.
Harry’s willpower nearly dissolves into giggles at the thought, and so he looks up and tries to focus on anything else. Draco’s desk is made of cheap particle board. The computer looks geriatric and is making strange whirring noises. There’s a small window, with several colourful cactuses on the sill.
Narcissa is sitting beside him, her posture impeccable, her lips a thin line. She doesn’t say anything, but she doesn’t need to. She’s with him, alive, and that’s what matters. The last two Malfoys, to be tried together.
“What’s your face doing?” Pansy asks from her spot on the rug. A collection of nail varnish spills around her, and she sits atop the colorful bottles like a dragon guarding her treasure. “Are you worrying about the curse?”
“Thanks for nothing,” Draco says, and he means it to be flirtatious. Potter always finds him, no matter what he does or how unlikely. Potter finds him.
The air is chilly and it makes his bones shake, but Harry pushes out into the street. The pavement stretches on and on and Harry lets the rhythm lull his thoughts into submission. Running, he’d learned in the months after the war, was the only time that his thoughts would turn down. The rhythm and exhaustion swallowed them up and so this is where he went, when the sadness came for him.
“Not safe?” Draco says, picturing his flat and all of the throw blankets he planned to wrap himself in once he stumbled through the front door.
It’s too much, seeing Potter like this. Still trying to save the world—one rotten death eater soul at a time.
The pause feels infinite, the entire universe feels contained within this single moment and Harry can’t move or think or breathe.
Pleasure swirls around them and Harry’s drunk on it as Draco moves up his body, holds himself above him, forearms bracketing Harry’s face. He traces the tip of one finger down Harry’s nose.
The confidence of his friends feels tender. If Harry can just sit Draco down and try and explain the thorny mess of feelings growing in his chest, then everything will be alright.  Buffeted by the certainties of the two best people Harry knows, the green magic of the floo roars to life and whisks him away.
The dark pavement feels like a blackboard and Draco a single white line. He knows where he’s going. His head is buzzing and his thoughts are washed out, but Draco knows where his feet are taking him.
“No.” Malfoy holds up a finger, and Harry’s assaulted with the memory of a dream, where Harry had pulled that finger into his mouth and just sucked.
It had all been so messy. The accounting of responsibility for a magical civil war exploded all over the front pages of the Profit.
getting brighter and brighter as his panic thrashed and wobbled—dying star on the end of his wand tip.
Firm hands take him by the shoulders, haul him up from the ground, steady him. “I’m sorry,” Harry says, brushing some of the dirt off of Draco’s robes. His hands are too big for it.
“A likely story,” Roberson says, but leans down, his mouth inches from the cash drawer, strokes the back of the machinery, and—much to Draco’s fury—the thing springs open.
His mother is crying. She hadn’t cried when they’d returned to the manor, not when they’d moved the bodies out of the basement, not when the Aurors had come for father. Narcissa Malfoy had steeled herself against the aftershocks of a war and
The night is a blood blister ready to burst. Harry feels the air pulse with the sheer anxious potential of it—the dark on the edge of rupture. His heart is in his throat.
“Out,” Potter says, a single word that does not offer any room for disagreement. Three professionals, bona fide adults, don’t dare question the Boy Who Lived—not when his eyes rage and all of that magic shivers in the air around him. They hurry out like chattel.
Draco thinks, and he feels all of his restraint crumble to nothing. He lets himself stare, lets all of his feelings pour out into the unflinching attention of Harry Potter.
There’s anger in the air and it’s starting to crest. The wave will crash soon. Draco looks for a way out, but there isn’t one. Gringotts is still so far away.
“Proceed with your concerns,” Draco says, folding the piece of paper and carefully and putting it in his pocket.
Slipping into the memory feels like stepping into someone else’s shoes. Harry shivers as he sees the cab of the truck, and then laughs as he sees Draco’s confused face shift to abject horror.
“Hermione!” Harry barrels through the floo, so agitated he thinks it may be bleeding through his skin. “Hermione! I need to talk to you!”
“He’s a bit eccentric, then?” not-Potter asks, and Draco mentally chides himself for sorting the world of men into Potters and not-Potters.
Fifteen minutes and several city blocks later, Draco sheds his robes and drapes them over one arm. He’s wearing grey slacks and a white button up beneath his work clothes—Draco is always pleased to discover that he has style in every universe.
Fate kisses him on the top of his head and it’s the last thing Draco feels before the lights go out.
There’s a long moment, where Robertson just looks at Harry as if he’s only just realized that he’s there. There’s a story in his eyes, folded between smile lines.
sounded dramatic and wouldn’t make sense to someone who hadn’t seen it, hadn’t followed him into the dark.
Harry is standing on the edge of the road, skin slick and dusty, with that same solitary hole in the toe of his trainers. Draco wants to shake him, because even when presented with an infinite number of clothing options, Potter still insists on scruffy disaster. His jeans are worn and his shirt is loose in the breeze and Draco barely registers any of that because his face—
“We see each other every day. I—” Potter stuttered, and his knuckles were white around the wheel. “I’ve talked in your direction.”
Draco had never let himself consider it, had never thought about what it must’ve been like, to be Harry Potter, capital ‘C’ chosen one, with the weight of the wizarding world literally on these trembling shoulders. It had never occurred to him to consider Harry’s fragility, because he’d always seen him as unbreakable. Even with the Dark Lord living in his home, Draco had always expected Potter to come through. It was just something Harry did. Overcame.
” Draco had said, when Harry’d growled about the upcoming end to his residency at Royal London Hospital.
“Where!” Hermione redirects, reading Harry’s face like it’s made of words rather than skin. “Where did you find him?” Hermione blows on her soup with a bit too much enthusiasm. Bella licks at her fingers.
The silence of their flat quickly lost its appeal and Draco and Pansy tumble out into Muggle London, hands clasped together, eyes huge. Pansy apparates them straight into a Muggle nightclub and Draco should have lectured her about apparition and recreational drug use, but all he can do is follow and touch her bare shoulders and laugh and laugh.
Draco opens his swollen eyes in time to see anger flash across Granger’s features. Whoever is arguing with her should run while they still can—even if she weren’t one of the most powerful witches of her generation, Draco has personal experience with her right hook.
The silence ripples as Malfoy scratches a few lines onto Lucy’s chart. “There. Dr. Mikhail will be in touch for a telehealth session later this evening.”
The walls were closing in, everything was loud and the bodies that should’ve been dancing were dying. Curses and cold sweat and Harry had to get out.
Eventually, Potter starts to monologue. It’s with less bluster than usual, so Draco knows he must’ve practiced. Which means that this intervention on his behalf was planned in advance.
Draco assumed that the Ministry would take issue—who in their right minds could ever view time spent in a book shop to be anything but self-serving? The Ministry, however, was not interested in vetting Draco’s choices.
The intimacy of the unedited story stuns him still and Harry’s helpless as the rest of the memory unfolds.
Harry thinks, looking at Malfoy walking purposefully a few feet in front of him.  Black denim should be illegal—god, the contrast with the white-blond hair. Malfoy’s wearing a simple t-shirt with the word NIRVANA on it. There’s a picture of a pink and blue man underneath the lettering. It’s a t-shirt and shouldn’t do things to Harry, but the way that it stretches tight across Malfoy’s shoulders—
