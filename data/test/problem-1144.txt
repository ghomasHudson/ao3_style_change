Harry just nodded and stayed close to friends and boyfriend not wanting to be near her after what she had said and tried to do to him since she was only a first year.
My aunt finally told me that my parents were killed after Hagrid told me that what they had told me in the first place, that my parents were drunks and killed themselves and that they were lumped with me because of it.
I also heard that he refused to eat anything that his loving aunt... yes Petunia is her name, she is so nice, gave him saying what she made was disgusting and he would never eat something that she made.
"Ah Harry my boy do come in, oh Severus I didn't know you would be joining us, I only asked for young Mister Potter" said Albus.
Severus was dressed in a white shirt, black trousers and highly polished shoes, his hair was drawn back into a low pony tail, he had decided that his back robe was too much as he would look like he normally did at school so decided on a dark blue robes with silver lining and buttons.
"What have you done to the door! My stuff is missing give it back!" screamed Ginny to her but she ignored it and waved her wand making Ginny enter her room but couldn't get out due to a barrier the Goblins had put in place.
"Ron, Hermione, Ginny please you don't know what has happened to me, you were invited to Professor Snape's quarters so then we could discuss this but I don't think it will happen now" said Harry as he saw his father walk in with Draco.
Malnutrition, dehydrated, burn to back, whips to back, lacerations to back and anus
"Thank you for coming Mister Flitwick, Madam Sprout, Pomfrey and McGonagall as well as Lord and Lady Malfoy and Heir Malfoy, Lord and Lady Weasely, Heir Weasely and lastly Mister Weasely I know this was all short notice but it has come to Gringotts attention that Lord Prince would like to blood adopt his son Heir Hadrian Snape".
"What in Merlin's beard, Otiz what's gotten into you of all things?!" cried out Harry as he was pushed into a wall away from whatever he had seen.
Once she placed it on Minerva's desk the rest of the lion's left narrowly missing Hermione walking into the office once she knocked.
"Well that is something I never expected to see, thank you Professor Snape, this will help but I would need young Hadrian's memories as well if we want to press the charges you are asking for.
Moments later Remus entered the room smiling slightly at Tom who was now back at his desk.
"TEV TEV me bored! Tommy no funs!" came the voice Severus was hoping he wouldn't hear for the day as Otiz was being a pain and not matter what they said he wouldn't calm down.
It had been a month since Hermione was in isolation and Hogwarts had become a peaceful place even though Tom was there aka Lord Voldemort but he was behaving so....
"Thank you Otiz, now Hadrian... get down from there!" said Severus noticing Harry was now hanging off the ceiling, some how getting his magic to work wonders yet again.
At the end of the feast Otiz was out cold and was happily snuggled on Severus, everyone made their way out of the Great Hall but Albus had other plans.
"You freak! Why did you come here this place is for normal people not people like you. Why don't you just leave this place and leave it for the normal people" she screamed at the pair of them.
He sat like for most of breakfast and only looked up when Severus tapped him on his shoulder "Hadrian, Harry come on son you need to eat something" and he smiled ever so slightly.
"Don't even think about it young lady, I'm using the same spell I used on you when you were a mare tot so" Molly didn't finish as Madam Malkin handed her four pairs of new school trousers which were going to be sent to the twins later that day.
Grandfathers:
Father- Benjamin Albert Anderson, 38 years old, black hair and deep blue eyes. He is a Shop Manager for the local supermarket. AKA Ben
He clutched the toys tightly to him, his magic still lashing around him which he didn't notice at all. He just wanted Otiz and his father but neither of them were there for him.
"So Poppy hasn't told you yet? well I was informed just recently that Mr. Potter's household currently at the residents of 4 Privet Driver is unsafe for the child. Albus he's a young boy, a second year at that, he has been abused since he was three years of age......" I replied sadly. Dumbledore could only stare back incomplete shock "Severus my boy, I'm afraid that I'm aware of this already. It is only safe that he is with fami-" Albus was soon interrupted by my uncontrolled temper, thank you father for the only thing you gave me. "Albus how dare you! He has had way to many near death experiences just in the past two years from his uncle's beatings! If you won't take him out of that damn household I will remove him myself. I am not bluffing. Good evening, Headmaster" and with that I stormed out of Dumbledore's office, only to leave behind a very shocked blue eyed man.
"Now I know why I couldn't find anything wrong with you when I always did a scan when you came to spend time within the Hospital Wing. Hadrian I'm sorry that I didn't notice about these Charms on you. I'm so so sorry" said Poppy as she burst into tears and leaned into Minerva.
"Professor the quills aren't mine honest to Merlin they aren't..." but she knew it was lying to her professor she would live with that, she didn't want them to be destroyed she had spent so much on them she couldn't afford to lose them.
With a very slight nod Harry said "I'm Hadrian Snape" how he managed to get out of Severus grip was beyond anyone and made the older girls laugh slightly and cooed at him when they noticed Harry hiding behind Severus once again.
The other two noticing a glare on them they turned round and faced him, the Grimm tried to hide from Remus' stare behind Tom but he only jestered for Remus to come up to his office after dinner that night.
"That bad then?" asked Blaise
The Oblivion was up next.
Most of them have been placed by Albus Dumbledore but I do think that all twenty seven of them were placed by him, some have broken before the cleansing.
"Leave now or I shall make sure your parents are contacted about your poor behaviour over the past year. You will do nothing to anyone and their pets or familiars. Now get out!"
Lucius tried to say something but it just came out as animal noises, Tom tried as well but he too made animal noises which didn't please anyone which made Severus scream but all that came out was quacking noises.
What do you think is office looks like? I'm think bright and airy with some colours of the houses dotted around and some plants, what about you?
Vernon turned a violent purple and Severus thought he was about to die due to blood loss as well as air but he just screamed at him instead.
"He's so cute" said Narcissa as they waited on some refreshments to come before they all headed for dinner.
"Well that was fun" said Otiz and yawned.
Mister Weasely follow me please, I would like a private word with you and what you have done to the rest of your peers. This is not how a Gryffindor should act much less than a human" and she storked off having him following, still blabbering his secrets as he went.
Both Severus and Minerva got up from the teachers table and headed over to the Gryffindor table and looked at the youngest Weasely child and she shrunk under their gaze.
"Hadrian is it ok to get some memories from your time with the Dursley's?" asked Lucius as he had gone over to wake the poor boy up.
As she came into the library Madam Pince sneered and said "you young lady I want to see you at all times, no going to the back, you are to stay here and study I don't want my books to disappear!".
The Perfects from the houses stood in front of the staff table and looked at all the teachers minus Albus really, it was Minvera that finally spoke.
Hufflepuff- Father (Lord)
"Professor Lupin is Hadrian going to be ok?" asked a third year, he only smiled back at him and said nothing more, everyone turned to see Severus come back down, Otiz still glued to him.
"No Otiz we were planning on going out for the day and hopefully pick out some stuff for you to keep that fun little mind occupied while me and dad are busy" and he rubbed their noses together.
"I bet it did you had twenty seven blocks and potions on you and now that they are gone you should be feeling a lot better if not sore due to the cleansing" and Severus rubbed his son cheek lightly.
"Ok that's all I need if you can pick out come colours for me to use I can get on this right away".
"Come on Dray get up, please" said Harry whining at the end of it all, he may be shy and withdrawn but he was stubborn as hell and everyone was finding out just how stubborn he really was.
Compulsion Charm keyed to Albus Dumbledore
Otiz picked up the cup and started drinking only to have some of it drip from his mouth, Harry catching it in time before it ruined his top, he didn't want any of his new clothes ruined.
He knew of Remus and his classes was something that he looked forward to even the big black dog that was normally found in the classroom or followed either Tom or Remus around all the time.
There sitting on the bed wrapped in his cover was one Harry James Potter, trying to make himself as small as possible, muttering 'don't hurt me' 'I'll be good' 'I'll finish my chores so please don't hurt me' over and over again only for Severus to come slowly closer to the bed and to Harry.
Filius entered and noted Otiz right away just sitting there next to Harry and his friends while glaring at the Gryffindor's namely Hermione, more so than the others.
"Hadrian are you ok?"
"That's some kind of sick joke even for you professor, my grades are perfect! I don't even know why you sent those stupid elves gave me story books and a potions book for first year students, I'm in third year!"
Mister Harrington what are your views on this matter?" asked Amelia.
"Well I would like to know why my cub is so scared of you Headmaster" said Remus almost growling.
Being a teenager he can easily snap at anyone which makes him transform, in his animal form he is as big as a tiger with the same temperament.
With that both Otiz; in animal form; and Harry left the classroom and headed off to dinner, while Filius looked very happy with his new information that he had been given.
............................
"Who the bloody hell are you?" he asked quite rudely only for the person to sigh to him "Maxwell my name is Greta Millstone, your school as well as your doctor Dr. Ashford and parents employ me to help you with your mental health problems" she said.
She went and sat down on her bed and saw a new book sitting there which was nothing but a stupid story book something called Tales of Beetle and Bard, how was she meant to pass the stupid time with nothing but a child's book?!
Happy that his master was finally happy Otiz got up on the sofa next to them and leaned slightly on Severus and fell asleep.
"Here Hadrian have the other one" said Draco handing his one over making the brunette smiled brightly as was now becoming the norm for the boy after being adopted by Severus in his second year he was now slowly healing but he still had appointments with his mind healer but they were getting less and less and it was all thanks to his new friends and his extended family.
It was a week into the summer holidays and Severus had decided to take Harry out for the day in London for some father and son time sadly Otiz would have to stay home due to what he was.
Professor Snape, Flitwick, McGonagall, Sprout, Madam Hooch as well as Lockhart all stood there, Ron still had a hold on Harry's elbow tightly, Harry still had tears streaming down his face whimpering slightly, it hurt.
"I did after a week, my parents showed me and I felt horrible at what I put him through, I really did" pouted Draco and Otiz put the phoenix on the bed.
"Well if it isn't our "dear" little nephew, Pet look who it is. Harry has come back to "us" at long last" said Vernon, making Harry stay where he was.
This made everyone look at the bird only to have Hedwig start hooting along with the other bird and then Tyki took flight just as the door to the compartment opened to reveal the Weasels and Granger.
...........
"Draco the guests are coming you know every well but the other you have only know for a year or more, I would like you to be respectful of both of them. I would hate to hear from our guests that you haven't behaved like a Malfoy should" said his father making him gulp.... who could these guest be??
"You want me to forgive you! You put that girls need to learn over the emotional turmoil she put my son through, my Hadrian has been bullied by them, money stolen, paid to be his friends.
So yet again being gentle as he could he brought Harry to Severus quarters and asked to portrait to get him for them, the portrait left only to reappear right away only to have the door open to a misheaving Severus at the door clad in dark green pyjama bottoms and a white top.
"I...um... I don't really know" stammered Harry making his way over to his father and sat down on the bed next to him.
"Otiz come back here" said Harry only to get the child to turn back into his animal form and jump from his lap over the table and into Harry's arms purring again.
Severus came towards the bed and once there he sat down and stroked Harry's hair, noticing how soft it was, yep definitely Lily's texture as well as her eyes everything else was James freakin Potter, oh well.
..........
🌸Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot
Instead of being with the Slytherin's you will be staying with me for the next week, if that's ok with you Hadrian?" she asked him who now was white as a sheet of paper.
Hermione was about to explain herself when Blaise spoke up.
It had been three hours since everyone had gone to bed but Harry was still up not liking how things were turning out.... he was in the Snakes Den now and it looked like Ron and Hermione..... they weren't his friends anymore..... he never wanted that, yes he wanted to be safe from those monsters but it looked like he had lost something yet again.... his first ever friends.
"You got that off dad and you know it Otiz" this made everyone laugh as they knew it was correct as they had many a times that he would steal Severus' coffee at breakfast in the great hall.
"Mr. Malfoy, Otiz take Mr. Snape to the infirmary right away" said Pomona as she cast a Patronus to Severus to tell him what had happened.
Hadiran's familiar Otiz is very protective of him and won't let anyone he deems untrustworthy near him, Otiz is a hybrid; Kitsune and a Bakeneko which is a a fox demon and a twin tailed cat demon.
Here are Ron's new family members
"Ron let go, please it hurts" whimpered Harry to the red head.
"Pomona can you keep an eye on Hadrian for me please, I know he has a double with you next" asked Severus to the woman further down the table who nodded and smiled at him.
"Good morning son and Merry Christmas, come into the living room once your washed and dressed and then we can open up the presents" said Severus as he finally got his robes out of Otiz's mouth.
When he was fully awake he changed back completely and Poppy went to work to see if he was ok.
"Come on Hadrian we have to get back for dinner" said Severus and they walked out and headed back home, Otiz walking next to Harry his tail wrapped around his arm, he mewed all the way there and when they opened the door Otiz made sure to lick Severus' hand who he now knew as Harry's caregiver.
"Do..."
Harry just blinked to him and then showed a very small smile towards his Potions Professor, he could perhaps get used to this but he would have to see.
Inside Minerva's office one Mister Ronald Weasely was being spoken too!
They were looking at maps and were trying to make plans on where to go as the park had many different area's to explore and rides to go on but for now until lunch it was just exploring and trying to keep Harry and Otiz off things before the could tomorrow.
He never even notice that his new mother had dropped off his new father and sisters and was taking him to his appointment.
The adults didn't get off scot free either, Lucius' shampoo was switched for dye and he was now sporting blue hair, Narcissa they left alone thankfully, Severus and Tom had been tied together with rope that was charmed to tighten if they tried to reach their wands which were just out of reach.
"Ok out the pair of you! It's eleven am and I don't want you two here drinking. Take your work with you and come back later, hopefully not drunk" and she shooed them out of the Manor and somewhere else.
Otiz noting the change in magic around Albus pointed his finger at him and said "you is meanie" then snuggled into Remus.
~relax young one I would never hurt the boy now, he is my potion master's son and I think of him as my son and with that the boy is now something along the line of grandson. I think of Draco the same as well~
I should get you arrested for that! You freaks are nothing but a disgrace and should just die if you know what's bloody well and good for you!"
Harry just nodded into his shoulder he didn't want to look at anyone, he was scared way to scared to admit it but he didn't think that they would love him now due to finding everything that had happened to him from the moment he started living with is ex relatives.
Godparents: Lucius Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy nee Black
Like a child having a tantrum he chucked everything off his desk screaming at the top of his lungs.
"Everything is what Lady Magic has decided son, nothing more nothing less".
"Miss Granger you are to head to your next lesson now but I will have to say you will be in detention with Professor Flitwick today after dinner for missing his lesson, I will inform him of it as it was me that caught you out of class" said Tom getting up and directing her to the door.
Molly nodded at her and saying nothing to her, grabbed hold of her and Floo'ed to Diagon Alley for the morning to get some new clothes and dinner for tonight.
Neville Frank Longbottom
"It can't be that bad from what I've heard he tripped and fell down the stairs and when his cousin went to help him up like a good boy that he is, Harry wanted nothing to do with him.
Animagus (hybrid of Rainbow Phoenix (very rare) and Basilisk (rare), can change into both or a mix of each 100% blocked
What should his Muggle name be? Out of curiosity?
"Hadwin!" cried the boy who ran up to him and flung himself into Harry's lap who made himself comfortable, he pulled Mooney into his arms and smiled.
Sirius and Remus stood off to the side slightly so not over whelm him like last time and they got "punished" in Harry's eyes of no chocolate and being trapped in Animagus form for a week, Harry was talking to Draco's friends Theo and Blaise jumping on the balls of his feet that was until he noticed Ginny in the background holding onto some luggage not saying anything, she was in a plain grey dress, hair in a bun she was looking at the floor.
"Dad.. Dad... Dad I can't wait, where do I begin to tell you how much I love this!" beamed the twelve year old boy to his father as he tried to help his father put away their clothes for the week they would be staying.
I took it upon myself to adopt him as I have been through what he has been through and I would never let him go back to those...monsters he calls relatives.
"...something..."
"So our own Harry Potter is no longer a lion but a slimy snake at that. What the hell happened Harry? Why have you gone over to them and not stay with us?" asked one of the sixth years by the name of Yasmin Cruise she had black hair with purple tips to it and blue eyes, while her brother Jacob had black hair with red tips to it with green eyes, just sneered at the boy in front of him from next to his sister.
Under the Whomping Willow was a room, they watched as the dog became a man making the four boys scream while Otiz growled at him.
"Move god damn it!" yelled Dudley to Severus as he tried to move the man but he couldn't be budged.
"Now that's even more creepy than Gred and Forge. Otiz please don't do that again" said Harry making everyone laugh.
He walked over and sat on a stool next to Harry almost with a bored look on his face but said nothing more, he twirled his wand in his hand making it spark here and there but nothing that would burn the whole classroom down.
Severus walked into the common room and spotted his son right away, he was next to Theo Nott and Pansy Parkinson all happily chatting away before lights out.
The jeweller smiled and went to get it for him and brought it back, "sir this one here can have any birthstone placed in it, would you like that or would you perfer to keep it like it is?" Harry looked over to Severus and he smiled back.
James Fleamont Potter, Lily Anne Potter nee Evans, Severus Tobias Snape (through adoption)
"Stop!" they both finished together making everyone that's within the common room all nod in agreement with the twins.
Date of Birth: 31st July 1980
.............
"Otiz will you stop already and tell us what's going one already" screamed Harry after another thirty minutes of him not answering him.
"I never knew..............." said Draco now feeling so guilty that he had picked and bullied the poor boy, he didn't know what to say or do to help the situation that was now on his plate.
"Everyone has said that all my work that I've done is just scribbles, everything looks like a child has written it. They said they couldn't make heads or tails out of it all! I worked so hard on my work! I don't know what they are on about!" and she screamed into the cushion again.
"...this" said the twins to the small group.
He turned round in his fathers lap and smiled slightly at Griphook and the nodded at the question, meaning that everything was fine.
"So he finally let you out of the time out corner" laughed the friends making both Harry and Otiz blush.
Otiz growled the whole time they walked back to Hogwarts no one had ever seen him like this before, besides when Dumbledore, Ron, Ginny and Hermione were around but as far as they knew Dumbledore was in Azkaban, Ron was now a Muggle, Ginny was at home being a slave to the family and Hermione was in isolation, so why was he acting like this?
"...do..."
After his outburst on the whole thing Draco was still fuming while everyone was quiet besides the sound of crying getting louder, Severus just started to rub his back gently to try to stop the tears that were in full flow.
"I, Madam Bones have nothing to say besides Albus Dumbledore threatened me to be here, as you know no I'm a squib I have no magical powers I have no magic.
"These could just be accidents that have happened over the years with his family, nothing more. Harry please go back to Gryffindor now, there's a good lad" said Albus but Harry didn't move he just looked at his father asking if he should go.
"I never thought those two would fight" said Pansy to them.
Me and Tom throught it would be a great idea to take you and your friends to somewhere that lets you experience joy and laughter...." he let it hang in the air for a bit.
Blaise had a Great Horned Owl feather quills with green ink bottles
"Ron just leave it please, I don't want to get into a fight of all things" said Harry as he tried to talk past his ex friends.
"Miss Granger you are lying to me".
We also know that Ronald Bullius Weasley has been cast out and has become a Muggle, his magic bound so tight that he would never be able to use his magic again as well as any of his children in later years, he also has a new family as well, we might be seeing them again over the course of chapter/years/books not sure yet.
"What Severus is trying to say is that he has been called to the Ministry for a trial for someone has declared that his isn't your rightful guardian and so....
She searches everywhere but she still couldn't find her wanted at all.
Hermione was screaming her head off and all Otiz wanted to do was knock her out with either a good placed punch or his wand but he kept it together for Harry always for Harry.
"...what's going..."
After a few long antagonising minutes Harry got up and looked at his father, tears streaming down his face, he launched himself at Severus only for him to almost fall off the bed as he held his son tightly.
"I don't know either" said Blaise as the others laughed or in the case of Greg and Vince they grunted.
"The Headmaster called for me when I was in Herbology, Madam Sprout told me to go and I was on my way to him when you caught me".
"Draco I can forgive you but I will never and I mean I will never forget that you where being an arse to me and I'm sure my father would like me to forget it all but I just can't, I can't. I mean all the time we could of been friends but you judged me because of the friends I made myself, ones that never had before because of my cousin bullying everyone in school to hate me.
"Hadrian, what's the matter and Otiz calm down before you bring down half the school onto the Slytherin dorms" said Severus as he got up from the floor.
"Well I never!" said Minerva as she gasped in shock watching one of her lions.
Everyone laughed seeing this and so she changed back not happy at all, Otiz ran up to her to show her his fur which now was polka dotted, purple, orange, black and white.
They carried on talking about what was going to change in the school, Remus not noticing the dog laying next to the desk as Tom ran his hands through the fur.
"I'll make sure Severus don't worry so much, he might just be coming down with something, but I will keep an eye on him".
"...that?" asked the twins going back and forth making most of the Gryffindor's sigh at them as the still couldn't tell which was which when they did that.
She stormed out of all her classes when they were finished screaming that she did all her homework and that the teachers were against her and it was infuriating to say the least!
"..as I was saying there is a meeting regarding you taking over as Headmaster, Dumbledore has stated that it is still his job, but with him being under house arrest he can not continue.
This made Harry laugh at it all, after Draco Otiz loved the twins the best and he always helped with their pranks.
APWBD- Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore
"Otiz put me down already!" said Harry as he was now being carried up towards the castle.
"..she would..."
"Hi Molly-kins, how are you doing and what has she been like?" he asked her only for Molly to look up at him and sighed.
Behind them sat Ron, Ginny and Hermione all in their school uniform as Dumbledore thought that they had to come along for no reason what so ever.
Severus and Remus where shocked, more so than Severus, the fuzz ball was now a teenager! What had happened now!
Neville- Nev
All of her children as well as everyone in the Great Hall gulped at that, the older years as well as the teachers knew what Molly Weasley could do just like her children, she was a force you DID NOT want to cross.
Right?!
He was staring at Harry of all things, who was happily taking to Draco and Blaise while Pansy was trying but failing to get his attention.
"So next is the blood adoption, all paper work will be kept here and a copy will be sent to the Ministry once everything is finished, everyone over the age of seventeen will have to sign the documents to make it official, the only one under the age who will have to sign it will be young Heir Prince" said Griphook as another Goblin bright in a different dagger and a goblet.
"Draco calm down Hadrian isn't saying anything because he gave up the name Harry James Potter the day I adopted him and so won't say anything to you until you call him by his new name" explained Severus to Draco as he placed a cup of tea in front of him, his son and then sat down himself.
Otiz looked at himself and then how Harry was sitting, he was pushed up against the stone wall in a chair away from everyone else and he was standing over him, glaring at anyone that he thought would be dangerous to the boy.
*Voice altering sweets
Albus was enraged the Weasley idiot had been cast out in front of the whole school! In the Great Hall no less! Why in Merlin's name would he do that!
Age 10:
"Dad...... that was so scary..... now I'm going to be picked on yet again!" cried Harry into his chest, tears and snot going everywhere. Yuck!
Otiz transformed into his animal form and now he was standing in front of Amelia in front of the whole Court it's fur letting off static in his anger Amelia let this happen the court need to know that he was willing to protect that he was in safe hands the safest hands that was Severus Tobias Snape.
Ron just kept quiet and when the car pulled to to them and all three got in, he knew he wasn't crazy but no one believed him, they even thought he was crazy!
Lucius looked at he time and when he saw that it was now ten at night thought it would be best for the Snake family to leave as tomorrow was the start of the new school year.
He rolled back over on his bed but when he hit the wall knowing full well that his bed in Gryffindor Tower wasn't near the wall he shot up as fast as a bullet just as his door opened up to two identical black haired girls.
It looked like a little snake with wings eating some chicken and had a bit of lettuce sticking out of its mouth.
"So I can see you have met her" said Remus as he was directed to sit down.
Harry looked at her and then hid behind Otiz dragging Draco with him.
Former Lord Voldemort
"Hadrian calm down already and help me unpack, then we can have a look round the resort and then we can go for a swin and perhaps sign you up for some surfing and kayaking lessons" laughed Severus to his son as he watched him jump up and down in excitement.
As all of them were leaving the noticed Hermione looking at them all and went onto the verbal attack once again but instead of listening to her the group just walked passed her, the shunning in fall force like it was with Ron.
You will notice what I have said has already been done, your window is also blocked so you can't see outside until we find you have learnt your lesson now march!" yelled Molly to her daughter once she handed over her wand to her mother.
Otiz got up from where he was laying and jumped up onto the arm of the chair and nuzzled the boy, trying to make sure he was ok.
Severus called for a house elf for some fire whiskey, just one mind you he did have to look after Harry as well as teach tomorrow.
As they came round the corner, Otiz squealed he saw something he could have fun with as a boy and as his normal self, a interactive toy snitch!
Parselmagic (100% blocked)
"Hello Harry my name is Remus John Lupin and I was a very close friend to your parents James and Lily, I'm so sorry about what happened to you back then, I wasn't in the country to help you at the time.
"You Tomas are a complete and utter idiot!" and Severus left the room followed by Minerva.
He so wanted to laugh but then he felt something on his head he reached up right away and screamed in shock making everyone look at him.
"As you know the Longbottom's are in St. Mungo's at this very moment and as for Black... Well that is another completely different matter that we will get to at another time" said Severus slightly adjusting himself as he now held a sleeping Harry in his arms.
"Ok then" he yawns and starts to eat when the food appeared is favourite of shepherds pie with a green salad and for pudding treacle tart and pumpkin juice, he ate the whole lot even asking for seconds on the shepherds pie, he soon settled back into sleep.
Frederick Gideon Weasely
"What are three stupid little lions doing in with the snakes, you know we are poisonous" he cackled slightly to them.
"Please Mister Snape I would prefer that you sit on the bench instead of the table" said Filius getting up on the books.
The fox was protecting his cub and his mate his beautiful loving mate was protecting something strange and stupid and he snarled at it, her, what ever it was.
"You have a dislocated elbow Mister Snape, now I would recommend that you stay as still as possible so then I can realine it, sadly it will hurt but with complete rest for the next few days it should be completely healed" Harry nodded to her about it all and held fast.
Tom was sitting in his office trying but failing to keep up with the paper work that Albus had neglected over the years, how in Merlin's sake did he manage to run the school when the paper work was ten years out of date!
"Hadrian it's alright now, I have you just breathe with me ok... in and out, in and out... That's it well done" said Severus as the pair sat on a bench in the shade of a oak tree.
When both of them looked it over they didnt see what the teachers saw, they saw was Hermione's perfect neat hand writing as well as many different types of notes and outcomes of all the subject of the homeowrk, this girl loved her work and would make sure that it was correct 100% before handing it in.
Otiz wondered up to the staff table but not before he headed to the Ravenclaw table and licked Luna Lovegood and then Hufflepuff, no one seemed interesting there lastly he headed for Neville, Fred, George and lastly Percy making sure to lick their hands and growl at Ginny, Ron and Hermione, he hated them more than anything.
Everyone looked at him but Otiz paid no mind to them and started helping himself to some pasta that was close to him, with a flick of his wand a goblet of blood appeared before him as well as Mink, he was wearing a black and silver towel with the letter 'S' on it.
"Oi Potter get the hell up!!" yelled the male voice to him making him jump sky high making the three laugh.
"Date, I know he likes chocolate, potion ingredients might work also. Not sure but if he's annoyed when oven done something I say sorry and give him a bar of his favourite chocolate and then he's fine".
I wish we could but they are keyed to his emotions. Let him calm down slightly before you try anything. Promise me that Otiz."
Both boys nodded and Severus got up and placed his son on the floor, he still had tears streaming down his face.
As they were leaving they saw Hermione walking towards them and once close enough she started screaming at them about how they could shunn Ron and then somehow making him lose his magic altogether!
When he's 14 he sees Harry as his little brother as he is also a familiar he tends to stay a year above Harry to keep him better protected.
"Dray I'm just not hungry that's all" said Harry to him as he got up and started to leave, making Otiz follow him.
They headed to Madam Puddifoot's a little cafe that was more for couples than anything and Draco had got them a private table as he knew Harry didn't want everyone looking at him all the time.
We all know the truth about what has happened we have all seen the results and everything, you will be fine" and she gave him a tight hug, claiming him more after his father had left.
She whisked him off to a hospital bed and made him sit down, "so anyone going to tell me what has happened and what has brought him to see me again?" she eyed his two friends.
Another Hufflepuff stood up and also slapped him but it was more of a punch than anything his name was Zander Wilson-Letcher and he was a seventh year and a Perfect at that!!
As it passed over to Tom or Tomas as he was calling himself at that moment was still shocked at what the thirteen year old boy had gone threw yes he tried to kill him when he was only fifteen months old but still this was over kill!
"Very good young Heir Prince, we will begin shortly after everyone has stepped up to their places we will begin right away" as Griphook said this another twelve Goblins came forward and spaced themselves evenly around the Faustian Mark and began chanting.
Harry wanted to go over to her and ask what was wrong but all she said was "thank you" and showed Lucius and right away and he took it out and place it around her neck.
Draco- a chess set from Severus and a broom cleaning kit and sweets from Harry
I find it horrible grotesque in fact that one Albus Percival wulfric Brian Dumbledore could not be asked to check on Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape I think it's in my clients best interest that stays with Severus Tobias Snape and not go back with his ex relatives" and he sat back down.
Severus was shocked at first by what he had seen but he knew that it was all because of Harry's magic, first he had magiked his two stuffed animals to somewhat life and then Otiz becoming human, just how powerful was his son?!
"You stupid girl, never move from a predator they will only kill you faster" said Otiz his voice now gruff and sounding a hell of a lot older than what he truly was, she was still screaming and he did the one thing he knew, he put his hand over her mouth to stop her, silence was golden at that moment.
"...it" said all three of them only to finished together and in turned laughed.
"Didn't you hear at the sorting at the beginning of the year when Minerva asked him to come up and be resorted. It was because of me that I asked for this after what I found during the summer.
Draco took it upon himself to grab hold of his hand, noticing the flinch right away, and pulled him towards the stairs leading down into the dorms.
Name: Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape
"All Weasely's in my office now!! Granger, Potter and Malfoy Now!" he screamed, everyone else tried not to laugh at him as the people named got up and left.
"Would you be alright with me becoming your legal guardian?" I asked a little uncertain, I'm not going to lie, I'm very nervous about Harry's answer. Harry looked over joyed that he, again, ran into my arms, I could feel Harry nodding against my chest "I take that as a yes? bring whatever you may need or want with you. I will shrink them down and put them in my robe" Severus said, Harry only nodded.
"I can get your shoes Luna" said Otiz as he transformed into a larger size of his normal form and gently picked up her shoes and handing them to her.
Harry looked up and saw silver eyes and blond hair next to him, Draco was there for him, if it wasn't his father it would always be Draco and his friends.
"Oh you know that mummy loves the idea I'm going to be Harry's wife no matter what she says now before hand she would always say I would be" and she held her nose in the air like she was the freakin' queen of Sheba!!!
As they are Severus was debating whether to forgive him or not all the while listening to what was being said to him by Tom or at least he was trying to that is.
"The Mandrake once mature can be used to unpetrify the witch or wizard that has been transfigured or cursed" said Otiz now examining his nails he was completely and utterly bored.
"Not"
"Minister what do I owe the pleasure on this fine day?" Tom asked with a smile on his face, jestering for Fudge to sit down.
One of the red heads spotted just the person they wanted to see..... "there's the traitor, in the bed, the one he always uses!" and so all three of them snuck in and went over to the bed.
"Pansy if Dray won't buy you any do you think I will, I need to get some quills and then finish my homework before my father finishes what ever he had to do today, we are meant to have some father and son time, plus I have been invited over to the Malfoy's for dinner tonight".
"So he's a double Animagus which is rare in it's own" said Poppy trying to check him over slowly but du to being a Medi witch and not knowing hat she should be looking for in an animal she wasn't much help.
🌸Voice changing
"I don't like this one bit son, as I have a free period I will join you..."
The day started out fine Harry had to admit Herbology was good Professor Spout talked about the Venomous Tentacula, good thing it was only revision, next was Charms where they learned the Shrinking Charm which was great as he was one of only a few that had managed it. Hermione wasn't one of them.
"I'll just let my friends know where I'm going in case dad... I mean Professor Snape..."
Within moments Narcissa was standing in the room, disbelief written on her face, this made then all stutter and back away slowly none of them wanted to be on the wrong side of one Narcissa Eridanus Malfoy nee Black!
Severus and Tom looked at each other knowing something was up with the boy and they knew he would come to them, mostly Severus if anything was truly the matter.
With their work done they let his new mother in and right away Ron rushed to her crying, sobbing in fact that he had lost everything that he held dear to him... He lost his family all because he wanted him friend away from the Slytherin's.
He backed down when he heard the snarl from Otiz but with Hermione screaming and blood rushing down her arm that no one seemed to want to clean up at the moment.
"I need you to set up a meeting with our esteemed Headmaster as he still isn't understanding that Harry Potter no longer exists, you have all the records on this and I would like you to make sure that he finally understands this" snarled Severus.
"Professor what about my classes today?? The new term as only just started I can't miss out on any classes" said Harry but Severus just smiled to him and informed him that all the teachers were aware that he wouldn't be attending lessons today and that a sub has been brought in to cover as well and so Severus grabbed a hold of Harry and they apparated to Gringotts
"So..."
Poppy and Severus were right by him right away to try and steam the bleeding.
Accidental magic (90% blocked)
Remus took the seat that Harry had vacated and gave the Headmaster a cold hard stare making his honey coloured eyes turn gold, Mooney right below the surface.
"So what's going to happen now?"
"Severus please this is just silly, he will and forever be known as Harry James Potter, he was born with that name, it does not matter that he was adopted, Harry my boy, isn't that right?" said Albus looking at the spot where the boy once stood.
"Yes love he yet again says his name is Ron Weasel.." she was cut off by his satin "it's Weasely, my name is Ron Weasley how did I get here anyway?"
I walk towards the edge of Hogwarts once out of the school's boundaries I apparated to 4 Privet Drive, it was late in the evening, the only light that could be seen was the street lights. I spotted the front door and went straight to it, looking around I saw no-one so I pulled out my wand and whispered "Alohomora" the door opened with a soft click, not loud enough to wake anyone.
"Ok Professor" said Harry as he slowly got up from the bed slowing his overly large pyjama top and bottoms to Severus who looked disgusted with them "when we got out we will be getting you some new clothes as well" and with that Severus left the room having Harry follow him as they headed towards the bathroom.
"Well that was unproductive" said Otiz head in hand wand still pointing at the bushy head girl.
Sirius just whined not wanting to leave the safety of the table he was under but when Tom slowly nudged him out and told him to go and see his friend Sirius went slowly to his best friend.
If there is any then we will go straight into a cleansing to rid everything and anything, then once that is done we will be able to go ahead with the blood adoption" explained Griphook to the boy who had now moved into the spare chair next to his father, everyone else was sitting behind them, waiting, wondering what was going to be found.
The group met the other two from their group and headed into Honeydukes and right away Otiz was picking up a load of blood lollies making the group sigh at what he was doing.
~You're a grown man asking Hadrian, a thirteen year old for help, that's cheating~
HE MAY NOT BE IN THE SAME HOUSE AS YOU ARE NOW BUT HE IS STILL FAMILY WHERE WE STAND FROM AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT I AS YOUR MOTHER DONT LIKE BULLYING!
"Hadrian come on son it's time to wake up, Hadrian..." he gently shook the boy until he was awake, peering at him were his emerald green eyes which so reminded him of his mother.
Someone walked up to him and placed their hand on his shoulder making him jump.
You are also under arrest for grand larceny from one Tom Marvolo Riddle, one Severus Tobias Prince- Snape and one Hadrian Jameson Severus Snape formally known as Harry James Potter, bullying, intimidation, full knowledge of abuse from the just the three mentioned and filing documentation of illegal goods. Placing charms, potions and blocks onto young witches and wizards to complete tasks which are too high with their current level of magic which has resulted in many, many sad deaths.
Ravenclaw- Mother (Lord)
~Thats cheating and you know it~
"Just keeping you innocent until you're at least sixteen or if I had my way until you're twenty one but Tom said I need you to spread your wings and let you grow" he sighs.
"My dear boy what can I do for you?"
Animal/Animagus/Patronus: hybrid- Bakeneko and a Kitsune (a cat demon and a fox demon)
That how ever had completely slipped and now she was only getting P, on her homework which didn't please her one bit think that the teachers were against her and her knowledge.
Making his way to the staff table he licked Minerva, Poppy, Pomona and Filius, growled at Albus and Remus and the lent his head on Severus' lap.
"Severus what has happened to you? Don't take your anger out on a small boy" said Tom to him but Severus growled at him.
The Dursley's looked at the two new people before them, seeing that it was a member of the reptile staff as well as a security guard they quickly held their breath.
Otiz looked at him like he was stupid but he knew he wanted an answer and so nodded his head and then got up off the chair and licked Severus' hand as well as nipped it.
He was going to carry in but he was jumped on by Otiz.
"You told her to look for me and Draco, Tom that's just mean! how could you do something like that I don't spy on yours and dad's relationship".
"What have you been up to?" was the first question Harry asked only to get a happy reply of..
"Firstly we shall do an inheritance test and to see everything that has happened, this will also include a complete health scan, mentions of vaults and then afterwards once that is done we will do a complete cleansing if there is any blocks or potions within your system. Is that ok?"
Mooney was on the casp of being let forth weeks before the next full moon, he didn't want that to happen and so took a shaky breath and glared fully at the man who said that his cub was protected by blood wards.
Lockhart was crying his fake blonde hair was now Gryffindor red
"Yes you stupid elf I'm the smartest witch around and I demand that you get me something that will test me in my knowledge!" she screamed at him, he popped away due to his nerves.
I'll be drawing new front covers for the stories as I'm trying to find one where I can put our SMOL bean on as well.
"Harry why in Merlin's name are you with the snakes of all thing! You are a Gryffindor, not a slimy snake!! Come back to where you belong, back with your true friends!" Harry sat there just looking at him saying nothing.
"Ok Hadrian" and he started back into the common room Otiz was by his side in seconds.
"Severus you have to see this, it's horrible if I had known he had gone through this I would of asked Albus to let the poor boy stay here" said Poppy to him and handed over the results that she had found hidden in an old storage cupboard within the Hospital Wing.
Cold, flu, frostbite, broken ribs, broken arm, torn ligiments in ankle, malnutrition, dehydrated
Fudge thanked them and let them be on their way, Harry shaking all the way. They had been in Fudge's office for three hours.
On the platform every student was either saying goodbye to their friends or trying to find their parents or even both and once Harry stepped off the train he heard a voice he never wanted to hear but he did.
"Well my client or should I say clients have such harsh treatment by Mr Dumbledore due to not checking up on young Mister Snape.
He was bombarded by Harry right away crying loudly into his chest "thank you Draco, you can go back to bed now I have this. We will see you in the morning" and with that the door closed and Draco headed back to bed.
Molly and Arthur looked like they were discussing her punishment, once they had decided it they looked at Fudge.
Harry was on the sofa starting into the unlit fire place, black specked emerald green eyes unfocused.
Otiz is a hyperactive young familiar who Harry calls affectionately Goof, that can transform into a young boy of six years old, later on 14, he has a lisp that makes he sound younger than he is, he loses it when he's 14.
"...brother...
The day came to an end quicker than normal, Severus and Lucius were enjoying some fire whiskey, Narcissa was stroking Otiz as now he was fast asleep, while Harry was curled up on a chair asleep book on his lap, Draco was also out for the count.
Last favourite food: any cooked meat
"Otiz calm down" said Severus to the irritated hybrid.
"I am Tomas Marvolo Sötétség" and he sat down once Amelia nodded in his direction, then she turned to Albus attorney.
Severus was excited to be here as much as Harry was.
His father came back in and announced that dinner was ready, Harry slowly got up and placed Otiz on the sofa and placed his blanket over him, and ruffled his hair again and then went into the kitchen to have his dinner, Otiz slept the whole way through.
His new family are:
He had done it he faced off against Bogert Vernon, he wasn't going to be scared of the man again.
"Very well do you have any proof of what has happened to Mister Potter here?" said Fudge but everyone looked at him, but it was Harry that said something.
Along with the Weasley's, Charlie was bringing his girlfriend Nymphadora Tonks, so there was a good mixture of people going the four close friends where going to enjoy every last minute everyone had been before besides Harry and they didn't wan to ruin anything for the boy even when he found out that they had been before and tried to get it out of them.
"Thank you Percy for that, if you hadn't I would of cursed her somehow" said Colin and he got away from her and headed up to the second year dorms and away from the nutter.
Diarrhea, conjunctivitis, flu, broken ribs, broken foot, torn ligiments in shoulder, malnutrition, dehydrated
We do not see your name or Ginerva's name any where on the Ministry's records you have never belonged in the Wizarding World after Lady Magic took your magic and bound it.
Emrys- Mother (Lord)
"This can't be you changed it all you imposter!"
After what seemed like forever which was more likely only ten minutes Tom came towards her wondering why she was there.
"What's going on here!" shouted Minvera to the class making Harry whimper slightly at the sound but Draco had it covered, he started to rub his back before he started to have a panic attack.
Remus- Wolfie it stuck, plus him being a werewolf....
They arrived at the entrance to Gringotts and went up to an open desk, Harry still being held by Severus as he was still shaken from what had happened with Vernon even though he was no where close to the.... man.
Harry sat bolt right up and sneered "well lets just say my relatives are monsters, Ron was my first ever friend in my life, I knew nothing of the Wizarding World, I didn't know I was famous!! Someone treated me as just Harry for the first time in my life. You just seemed so up your arse that I didn't want to know you, you remined me of them!"
"Otiz he will be alright, let him calm down before we go in there ok?" said Severus as he sat down in his chair, Otiz clearly trying to get into the room.
"No I thought he was here" said Arthur looking around for the blond.
Oh finally peace and quite now that all the brats have gone home for the summer, I wont have to deal with them for six freakin whole weeks, I can finally relax and work on my potions that I have to prepare for the hospital wing and make my own personal ones as well. Awe the bliss of it all.
"Ah Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Snape what brings you both here?" she asked not pleased to see the boys.
It was hissing away at being disturbed from its slumber.
"Haddy can you buy me so chocolate please, Drakey won't buy me any" said Pansy pouting like a kicked puppy trying to get her way.
"My father?!" laughed Draco
"Now lets leave my "poor" cousin alone while he rests in his room until tomorrow as I don't think he would be able to eat or drink anything until tonight or better yet tomorrow morning" said Narcissa to them as the two of the carried Sirius to his and Remus' room to rest for the night.
"I don't care what his name is I want him in this office now!" and he screamed which only made his already high pitched voice even higher making the students place their hands over their ears. Ouch!
*A potion to make them have different coloured hair to match the houses
"Are you sure he's related to the Black's as he doesn't act like it" said Lucius looking at his wife.
"Hadrian I hate to tell you this in such a way but..." her door was blasted off its hinges to reveal one giant black bat.
"The headmaster is getting stranger and stranger" said Theodore Nott to his friends, Otiz took a sniff at him and then licked him, he had promised Harry to stay in his animal form while in classes ect... but he could be human in the common room as well as the dorms.
"His magic has completely settled now, he's not making things fly around like he has all day long" said Poppy coming to look at her patient.
"Mister Snape please go along with Mister Malfoy to the Headmasters office" said Filius but Harry's eyes went bulbous at this and shook his head.
Saviour complex
"Decisions decisions brother of mine"
"Are you ok?" she crouched down beside him checking him over the best she could with her very limited knowledge of first aide, Sirius just groaned and slowly sat up.
He wanted to have his friends back but due to now being in Slytherin and that Severus is now his father it was hard, he knew he should count his lucky stars to be finally out of the Dursley's, he finally had someone who truly loved him all he wanted was his friends back.
...they felt a snap within their sibling bonds meaning that Magic know cast him out of their family for good. Everyone in the hall felt the magic besides Ron as he was still shouting profanities at Lucius and at Harry.
The parchement glowed and then a copy was made and then both disappeared one into the Prince Vault and the other to the Ministry.
"My mother was Eileen Josephine Prince, we don't know if I have any aunts and uncles or even cousins due to her being disowned by her family for marrying my father Tobias Snape, but as such I am now Lord of the Prince line an due to me adopting Hadrain he is Heir apparent.
Hadrian had came into the Great Hall for lunch and right away he noticed many different students and teachers including his father sporting different colour hair, clothes and funny enough animal appendages.
"Idiot I explained everything to you when I found out it was you in Tomas' office that day, Severus adopted Hadrian..."
Christmas day had finally arrived and Harry for once was happy, he was with his father and he had Otiz with him, which at that moment he was on Harry's chest licking his face to wake him up, thank Merlin he wasn't... Damn he was jumping on him.
"I said it would of been better if he took my hand in first year ok!" and he was about to walk out when Narcissa closed the door with her wand, "run that by us again Draco" she wasn't happy.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hadrian don't worry we are out as a family and you can never have enough clothes, plus I would like to get some nice clothes as the Malfoy's are coming over to dinner tonight and I know you don't like to wear robes and I doubt Otiz will wear them" and he laughed slightly to his son.
Tom flinched, Lucius sat stock still, Severus sighed and Otiz just smiled at the boy who walked into the lounge.
Snape- Adopted Father (Heir)
"It is Hadrian and it looks like he has started is Animagus transformations, I could smell that he was going to start them, he is a natural Animagus after all, he has three in total didn't you read his report form the Goblins?" he asked as they walked into the infirmary.
(See the end of the chapter for
"WHAT THE HELL!" screamed Draco making everyone look at him, "why is Potter here of all things? Uncle Sev please tell me you didn't adopt him??"
One Lucius Abraxas Malfoy was standing in front of the Head Table waiting for everyone to sit down so then he could tell them what had happened and why the Ministry was now getting involved with the school.
Maxwell Ronald Anderson, 13 years old, dirty blond hair and brown eyes. He has all his memories about the Magical World but no one believes him and they take him to different doctors thinking he's crazy. AKA Max
"Please just stop, all three of them know each other, Lucius and my father are old housemates and the new Headmaster has known them since they left school" explained Harry to them.
"As you know Minster, Harry Potter has been adopted by me over the summer of last and then yesterday he was finally blood adopted but as you can see from that there was many blocks and potions within his system.
Harry was dressed in a deep green shirt which matched his eyes and black trousers and again highly polished shoes, his hair was tameable thanks to the adoption many months ago, it wasn't a bird's nest, thank Merlin for that. His robes was an almost black but it was in fact a very deep forest green.
Harry pulled on his father, this bought Dudley's attention and tried to sneak over to most likely hit the smaller boy but Severus saw it and gave a small smile.
"...wouldn't..."
"But she didn't do anyting wrong!" yelled Ron to them making Severus just look at him, a look that said 'carry on and I will personally talk to your parents and you will be exspelled' Ron shut his mouth.
"Wasn't us..."
"Otiz get your furry little butt over here and stop pestering dad and his friends" came Harry's voice making everyone jump as they weren't expecting it.
Again he was yet alone!
"Draco darling please sit down we are still talking" said his mother making him sit in the spare chair.
Albus the boy, my son was beating to an inch of his life for Merlin's sake, it took everything I had to keep him alive. My potions were near depleted because of it".
I just wanted to get out of there but when I got back at the end of the school year everything got a whole at lot worse, the punishments increased and what ever I did it was wrong in their books.
.....
In the end he let her go back to her dorms but not before letting her that she will be having detention with Filch for the next week, but as she was leaving Filius had a feeling that she wasn't listening at all.
"Otiz threatened him" said Harry to the three of them.
Harry chuckled at this but made no move to wake up the small boy.
Gryffindor 5
He had tried to worm his way into Severus' life when his mother had died but he just couldn't get passed his defences at all, he was imperishable!
"Oh Harry why didn't you say anything?" this made the boy just shugg and hide behind his knees as a defence, to everything that was going around him.
By the end of the day Poppy finally came towards her, she looked so annoyed that Poppy had forgotten about her of all things, she had been knocked out!
Otiz only nodded and hugged Mooney to him and snuggled into the boy more.
Minerva was very disturbed about what she had been reading....
He wanted to make amends fully for bullying him the first year and partly of this year as well and by Merlin he was going to do that. His friend was Hadrian "Haddy" Snape, nothing more nothing less.... He was a no longer Harry Freakin Golden Boy Saviour of the Wizarding World Potter!
"I think I'm now ready" said Harry and right away the hat shouted out 'SLYTHERIN!' Harry got up off the stool and headed towards the table, Draco moved aside and let Harry sit down.
"Hi Lu-Lu how have you and Nana been? I should asked Hads to bring me with him to yours along with Dray" and he smiled again letting his fangs show more, he was definitely up to something.
The moment they set foot into Kihei, Maui Harry was in awe! He had never, ever been out of Britian for any type of holiday and so was relishing in just being allowed to go on holiday and not spend any of it at Mrs Figgs and her bloody cats.
"Is there anything I can do to help you with sir?" asked a member of staff.
"C..ca...can I ge..get him?" asked Harry only to have Severus nod to him and they walked over to the teller and all she said was "no one has been able to get close to him, he's quite rare really, its a first since I've working here that he's picked someone" and the kitten just mewed to them sleeping happily.
"Dray stays here. He said to us that he needs to go to Dervish and Banges as well as Scrivenshafts Quill shop, plus Sevvy has asked us to get him some more red ink" said Otiz making sure both Harry and Draco where behind him.
With telepathy he told everyone who had done this is screamed his name, so badly. It smelt so badly of him that it smelt like used nappies and garbage as well as rotten cabbage all mixed together.
"I have come to inform you Headmaster Sötétség that there is a meeting regarding Albus Dumbledore and his place as Headmaster. You Tomas was it can I call you that?.."
Animals: none (thank Merlin I think he might try to eat them)
Otiz growled to him but he knew he wouldn't be able to get into the room until he had calmed down.
Back at Hogwarts the group headed to Severus' quarters and noticed that the three men were now laughing animatedly about everything and anything.
"So wand snapping and basically a slave? We don't condone that but if it's with just your family then I don't see any problem with it all with it. Do you have her wand?"
Remus smirked at Tom's face knowing full well that Sirius had been wandering the hallways in his Animagus form when he wasn't meant to be, he glared to Sirius under I desk trying and failing to keep it away from Remus.
Severus went over to Lucius and said "keep him here for the time being and then once this is over we will be heading over to Gringotts to get everything sorted" and with that he left the boy with his godparents and walked over to Vernon.
Severus went back to the floo and allowed Minerva through, she was shocked to see that Draco as well as Blaise sitting quite happily with Harry studying, homework spread out on the coffee table.
Summer hols have started!!
"It's time for you to get up Hadrian we are leaving within the next hour so up, wash and dress. We will get breakfast before we leave".
He sniffed again and this time purred and brought himself as close to Remus as possible within the tiny space between them, he purred again and then in a instant he was human again.
"No Albus he will not, he is my son from the day I adopted him, he is my son! Gringotts have everything that they need, Harry Potter does not exist anymore, only Hadrian Snape exists.
The boys almost laughed at this but stopped when they were glared at.
Without thinking Harry hit Otiz on the back of his head even though he was a good inch or so taller than him.
She nodded and sat down in the only other seat available, the other one was already occupied by Severus and his fire whiskey he was nursing.
Remus just sighed and sat down, "this boys is my friend Sirius Orion Black, Lord of the Ancient House of Black, who is the cousin of Narcissa Malfoy nee Black and Hadrian's old godfather" explained Remus.
~Tom you're an idiot~ said Nagini as she came into the office with a cover that appeared to belong to one of the Slytherin's
Cut arm, burnt arm, frost bite, conjunctivitis (both eyes)
"Can you put that thing outside my office, it would make this whole conversation worth while" said Albus.
House: Slytherin
The twins and Draco were trying their best to help Harry over come his shock which took about half and hour but he was soon calm enough, he was holding onto Draco as he tried to get up but he was shaky but otherwise fine.
"You won't be able to do that Sirius, Harry is now Hadrian Severus Jameson Snape, he's been adopted by him both through the ministry as well as blood adoption he is no longer Harry James Potter" said Tom
"Well that was a very stupid idea if I say so myself" quittled Hermione to them looking up from a book she was reading.
"You know if you hadn't of started this you wouldn't be in this mess" said Luna in an airy tone.
More of the park and rides
"It's Otiz! He's really mad about something" explained Theo who was now squished between Blaise and Draco shaking.
"Me always can!" cheered the little boy, making the man stop down the hall shocked, why hadn't he transformed before?
Your stuff that you have left at the Burrow has had been burned you have been casted out of the family wholeheartedly, everything that had your picture or name on no longer exists the same with Ginerva.
I want to live my life in the Muggle world with my family and I hope Mister Hadrian Snape understands that what my client has done is the worst thing anybody could hope for all he had to do was check on him but he never did if it wasn't for his father we would have lost the Saviour of the Wizarding world.
Once at their table Draco pushed Harry in being the right gentleman he was brought up to be making Harry blush.
"...disgusting!"said the twins to themselves mainly but they knew everyone was listening to them.
"Who is that anyway?" asked Pansy coming up to Draco to make sure that her arm was wrapped around his.
Oh how they wished they could kill the bushy haired girl within their dorm/common room, they had had enough of the girl who was telling at anyone she could find about trying to get Tom removed from the position of Headmaster and reinstate Albus of all things.
"You have lost your say completely after we delay with you after trying to kill young Mister Snape, so I would kindly ask you sit down before I make good on my promise at your court case" said Amelia, making the girl sit down.
"Ok Lu-Lu we won't" snickered Severus as he started to walk out of the hall and towards the potion labs.
"...to do..."
"You worry too much Otiz really you do, I have all my friends and my family to look after me, nothing will go wrong with everyone protecting me and from what you said about Lady Hogwarts and Lady Magic I'm more protected than ever before.
"I don't care, what you did sent everything off to what almost cost me my life at the beginning of my second year! I would of died if dad didn't come and get me!
"Hadrian can you please help me with your father, you know he's made with me and I want to say I'm sorry but he won't listen to me, what do you think I should do?"
Like how James, Remus and Sirius name their Animagus forms: Prongs, Mooney and Padfoot
He didn't tell us why until we got back here, turns out Granger isn't in isolation anymore and we don't know why, Otiz has been like this since we got back" said Draco to him, only to make Severus sigh.
I think you need a lesson on how to act and how taking someone's familiar could harm both of them" said Flitwick to her.
Hadrian will be used in conversations mainly but other wise it will still be Harry
At this he stopped as tears were beginning to fall, Otiz right away started to lick his face to calm him down, taking another breath he started up again.
"Hads don't say it" said Otiz as the bubbling and hissing continued only for the goblet to explode but before it could harm anyone a shield was in place.
"Headmaster we have to discuss some things right now!"
Slytherin 6
He is in human form now but he is a hybrid familiar of the Japanese Bakeneko a cat demon and a Kitsune a fox demon.
Two hours later Harry had finally calm down enough and was peacefully snoozing on the bed after Draco was not so kindly removed from the ward.
Everyone was watching what was happening, there was a rift between the lightest family in the whole of Great Britain!
They were soon unpacking for their two weeks stay, everyone had a room to share, the Snape family (Severus, Tom, Harry and Otiz), Weasely's (Molly, Arthur, Percy, Fred, George and Ginny who would be sleeping on the floor), Malfoy's (Narcissa, Lucius, Draco, Blaise and Theo) Bill, Charlie and Dora as she liked to be called all roomed together like Sirius and Remus were.
Dinner was a quiet affair not much conversation going on around the table but between Lucius and Severus the topic went to Albus and how the ministry was going to deal with him as well as ho Harry felt about being within the family mind you it is only been just a year but he had become Severus' son.
"No it can't be, I spent all night on it, it's perfect!" she yelled at the small professor.
Severus glared at the boy and moved his hand and removed the boy from his son, then he pulled out his wand.
As they got further away somehow Sirius and Otiz managed to dump some goo over them and ran off.
Draco smiled he loved when Hadrian called him that but he wouldn't say anything about it incase he upset him and then he would have a meltdown which hadn't happed for a few months now, he was getting better.
Arthur nodded and handed over Ginny's yew wand and right there and then snapped it making the magic within crackle and then disappear.
"Finally that freak has gone" and he left with a smile on his fat face.
"Hermione Granger please to meet you and you are?"
"Wheee! Tommy Tommy we go pways nows?" he asked jumping up and down his blue hair flying about.
"Blast it!" he then looked up and saw Cornelius Fudge standing there..
The tape measure wizzed around him and Otiz had to stop himself from chasing it due to his mixed heritage. He so wanted it.
Hermione sighed and turned to face Luna "looks like someone put a charm on them so then they won't come down, you'll have to get a teacher, I must be going I have some homework that I need to do" and she walked off bumping into Harry as she went.
Harry just laughed out loud making everyone look at him again but right away turned back to their lunch.
"Is there any place you want to go to?" asked Severus to his son who by now was wiping blood off Otiz as he had yet again spilt his blood.
Harry knew what they would find and so he was now back into his fathers lap shaking as the parchement glowed once again and writing appeared.
~Stole it~
"Ok then Maxwell ok, just breath for me. Remember out breathing exercises we do when you get like this.. that's right in and out, in and out well done Max perfect keep going that's it. Well done feel better?" she asked at the end only for him to nod at her.
"The Headmaster has asked for you, me and Professor Lupin to his office, by default Otiz is coming along because he would go on a rampage if we leave him alone" and he brought Harry up to the Headmasters office.
Remus ignored him and carried on explaining "...as I was saying Severus adopted Hadrian and what you thought Sirius of being godfather was stripped from you when the adoption and blood adoption took place his name changed to Hadrian Severus Jameson Snape as of August last year from what I was told by Severus and Tomas".
Parents: Severus Tobias Snape
Werewolf Remus sniffed the air noting that it smelt like his mate, of broom wax, engine oil and leather and the fox that he had known over the year as well as his cub, his missing cub that now smelt of potions more than his honey and lavender rose he knew from when he was but a baby, the lavender was long gone now but the honey was still there just not as powerful anymore.
Otiz switched to his teenage form and smiled to him as he watched Harry head to the bathroom to wash and get ready for the day.
"Sir what has happend?" asked Rioghnach Byrnea she stood up and slowly walked over to them, Otiz growled at her, pupils going into slits, he was scared, nervous and angry he didn't want anyone near his family at the moment.
He shy but once you get to know the real him I think you three will find that Hardian is a pucker young man that needs some guidance from some older brothers".
"...next!" they finished together.
Severus stood in the doorway until he saw that Harry's breathing had died down, once Severus was sure Harry was asleep he cast a healing spell and cracked Harry's door, so he could hear in case of emergencies. Severus was just about to fire call Albus when he heard a muffled cry followed by a scream, Severus ran across the room as fast as he could. All this worry making him feel nauseous.
The gifts for the Weasely's were joint from Harry and Severus and they were a new cook book, a Muggle one, for Molly, Arthur was given a radio and was told by Harry not to touch it until he helped him with it.
It was morning afterall.
Harry shunk down and hid the best he could beside his father, he had to keep up mind you as he had started walking towards the Slytherin table.
Fudge soon left after that making Tom sigh with regret, why did he say he would become Headmaster if it meant filling in blasted forms from ten years ago and having to deal with Fudge all in the same day.. he needed a fire whiskey but it being only Wednesday he would have to wait until the weekend and hopefully get to know Hadrian more.
"When we first met at Madam Malkin's before first year, then on the train. If he had taken my bloody hand back then, none of this would of happened!"
She lead Severus to a free bed and had him lay down on it.
"Harry or should I say Hadrian now, is fine now he was rescued the summer just before his second year by Severus..."
.............
Severus then stood to leave but felt a tiny hand grasp his wrist, he looked back confused when Harry then asked "Sir, um... can I er sleep with you?" Harry stuttered. Severus only nodded and picked the boy up, Severus was surprised at how light the twelve year old was, he walked into his room and slowly laid Harry down onto his bed, covered him up, careful not to wake him, Severus placed a light kiss on the top of Harry's head. Severus slowly eased himself onto the bed and turned on his side, he dimmed the lights and looked at Harry once more before sleep overtook him.
"Ok everyone settle down for the last few minutes of class as this discussion had been going on for the past hour and a half. I would like each and everyone one of you to sit back down and open your books back up as this is going to be your homework".
Severus quite shocked by the boys action's, he could only hug Harry back and whisper soft words of reassurance, once Harry had calmed down he stepped back and looked at his professor. "I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to" Harry whispered. "Harry it's fine. The reason I'm here is to take you out of this household, but before I do I have one question" Severus stated, Harry only nodded.
Severus had managed to get into his quarters mind you it was a rather difficult task as Harry wouldn't come out of his robes no matter how much he tried to get the poor boy out.
With that I hope you all enjoy your breakfast and I hope that you all enjoy your day and I do hope that we can all get along with eachother over the course of your time within Hogwarts" and he just clapped his hands and the food appeared on the tables.
