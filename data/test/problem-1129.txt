Their fort expanded from one side of the room to the other in a rectangular shape, just high enough for them to prop themselves up on their elbows. They made it sit a few feet away from touching the couch so that they had the option to either climb on the couch, or use the pathway around the couch.
“Draco what do you say?” Blaise asked, pulling up a little bit of the blanket in front of Draco’s eyes, placing it back down when Draco grumbled our a small sure.
It was a small room, without any light except for a small glowing light Draco made float in the top of the room. The yellow light casts a warm shadow over the stone walls. In the middle was only a small green carpet, barely big enough for the two of them, and a few piles of old books randomly along the walls.
“Potter, you more than me need the fresh air. At least on my missions I was able to go outside, most of yours were spent underground.”
“Yeah... okay.” Harry waited as Draco put the bag back into the wall before they made their way to their bed as Seamus quietly made his way to the restroom.
“Look, how long have you two been dating?”
“Of course I will Potter, why do you think I spent this entire day running around Hogwarts. It was a monstrosity, but I loved it.”
“What the hell is that.”
“Good point,” Harry replied, grabbing his drink and sipping most of it down in one gulp.
“Draco,” Harry asked calmly, “why are you wearing my jacket?”
“Or, they could take the easy way, and keep following up around everywhere, waiting for something else to occur.”
It was beginning to appear like they picked the one day where reporters were nowhere to be seen, but just as their coffees arrived at the table, the usual shriek of excitement came from the waitress, practically waking up the reporters like angry bees. Almost immediately, cameras were being turned on. The usual sound of clicking began to start as the cameras took off on their own, flying through the sky, leaving their person behind to join their automatic quill in taking as many notes as they could.
Harry unfolded the crumbled up map from the glove box again, which was more destroyed then before and now held millions of red and black lines, hurriedly thrown on there from the day before. Most of the lines were bumpy or flying in the wrong direction before disappearing and reappearing to continue in the direction, but somehow they still made a little sense to the two of them.
“So where is this hotel you were talking about?”
“No, not changing the subject when we talk to the reporters won’t get us out of the news soon.”
“So what’s the plan for this date of ours?” Draco asked, brushing off a few fallen leaves from the table.
“I thought you had something in mind, after all, you dragged me here.”
“Okay calm down, I got the antidote right here.” Relieved, Draco started to turn to more of a shade of light purple, before he saw the glass bottle slip out of Harry’s hand and break into millions of pieces on the floor, making all of the color leave his face in an instant before flaring back up to a dark red.
Draco allowed sufficient time for Harry to be sound asleep before making his way to the trophy, ready to get this mission done with so he’ll never have to bear witness to Potter and his ridiculous hair again.
“Don’t change the subject!”
He attempted to calm his crazy hair with gel, but soon gave up when it looked worse than before. Realizing the time, he grabbed a plate of food that he prepared early in the morning, threw on his invisibility cloak, and ran to the stairs.
Harry ranted as Qye closed his eyes and thought about how he reached for him, thought about pulling back now.
“So are you going to tell me?” Ron asked as he leaned against one of his bedposts, already dressed in the ruby-red robes.
Harry furrowed his brow.
She allowed some sympathy to slip into her expression.  “I understand you care.  I can’t say I understand exactly what your relationship to your Carus entails.  But that’s Qye’s relationship with you, not Harry.  Harry holds no such connection towards you.  In fact, the very opposite is true with your presence presenting aversely to him, which only further affects Qye’s opinion.”
.::  He sounded slightly disturbed.  ::
:: he thought to the other boy tentatively. There was no response and upon further investigation, Qye found him to be…sleeping? He frowned further and concentrated.
Qye suddenly said in the buzzing silence of Harry’s head.
Dumbledore would…what?  Fix him?  Fix his memories?  Fix what the vampire had stolen, hidden from him?
“Do you have memories of your mother, Qye?” Wainscott asked curiously.  “Madam Pomfrey communicated that Harry had visions of her from when the dementors were on the grounds a few years ago.”
:: Qye whispered as Harry watched Professor Opacre cheerfully wave a hand at the class.  He dropped his eyes when the blonde woman began to turn towards him.
Harry was suddenly reminded vividly of Hermione, of her concern and unwavering support and missed her with a pang.  Before their final O.W.L. she had slipped a mini treacle tart into his bag along with his study guide.
’  No…he didn’t.  For some reason, it felt…right…being back here.  Being back under the cupboard.  He remembered being locked in here when he was younger, remembered it being the place he wanted to get out of.  But now that he thought about it, he didn’t hate it.
Silver eyes darkened to mercury. Opacre was not going to win again. Not now, not with this. He may lose at everything else but he wasn't about to lose this.
of you are going to
“Back to Harry?” the teenager bit out, standing from the couch, dropping his hands to his side and fisting them.
She grinned as she capped her eyeliner.  “Harry asked for clothing advice,” she sighed happily, holding the tube close as she remembered all the fun of the afternoon.  “I was so happy to be asked I…”  She ruefully looked around the messy room.  “Well, I suppose I might’ve gotten a little…enthusiastic.”  She laughed and whirled around as she continued cleaning up.  “Oh, but I haven’t done that in such a long time.”
They were walking on the snow covered grounds when Draco thought Harry bent down to tie his shoe, only he stood up with a snowball in his hand. Before he could react, a snowball hit Draco in the chest. He took off running, and sought shelter behind a tree. He made as many snowballs as he could before Harry was facing him again, his arms full of snow. The two laughed and chased each other.
Draco shook his head, “I don’t know what that means...”
Potter tilted his head to the side again, “Is there somewhere we can talk...” He gestured vaguely, “Privately?”
“I didn’t know you would like anything I made,” Draco confessed to Teddy. He then glanced at Potter who shrugged in apology. Draco gave him a conspiratorial smirk. “Well, do you have any requests?”
“Children, Draco. We were children. I don’t know if Teddy puts things in perspective for me, but I can’t imagine holding against you something you did a lifetime ago.”
“What is?” And it was Harry’s turn to be confused.
“Oh, right. Yes.” Potter fidgeted in his seat. “So the wand has changed allegiance. It thinks I’m its master. You have to take it from me.”
Harry’s shoulders shook as he laughed silently. He took a deep breath and sighed. He was still smiling, but Draco wasn’t the least bit mad. He smiled back at Harry.
Even though potter spoke on his behalf, he hadn’t spoken more than ten words to Draco since he arrived back at the Hogwarts. A “Whoops, sorry,” didn’t hold the same effect as, “Draco Malfoy belongs in Askaban only as much as I do. He saved my life, and was instrumental in the defeat of the man Tom Riddle who you all know as Voldemort.” Those words circled Draco’s head on a daily, more like hourly basis. Every time he saw Harry lounging with his friends, or huddled in the library, laughing more than he was studying, or walking next to his girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, in the hall. His words echoed so loudly in his mind.
“That’s great Luna,” Harry said hollowly.  She entered the floo and called the address of her office before disappearing into the green flames.  It was now or never, and it was too late to call in sick, so Harry grabbed some floo powder and walked into the fireplace.  After the twists and turns of the floo network, Harry stepped out into the atrium of the Ministry of Magic.  The buzz of gossip was a cacophony of noise that suddenly stopped as if someone had cast a muffliato spell on the room.  The silence was deafening.  As if the stares from the employees weren’t enough, his own face smiled from the cover the magazine in almost everyone’s hand.
“But. Why?” Harry asked, hating the way his tone sounded like a child asking why he couldn’t have dessert.
“Hey Luna!” Harry called out, his voice overly cheery.  Luna breezed up to him.
“Well,” Harry set his presents aside. “Let’s do this,” and started towards the massive pile of presents.
The moment that Ron and Malfoy began to bury the hatchet, was one of his favorite memories.  It was the third case that Draco was helping them work.  Ron and Harry were staying late, and going though potential ringleaders, anyone that had been in the business in the last few years.  Draco was there, he had recently identified the substances that were known or suspected to be attributed to each suspect.  Ron mumbled something about muggle drugs.  Draco stopped what he was doing, looked at Ron with wide eyes and yelled, “Ron! You’re a genius!” Then he dashed out of the room.  When he came back, be had a suspect file, and the case was closed in three days.  After that, Ron and Malfoy treated each other with a mutual respect, somedays it was harder for them than others, but for the most part, things were definitely much improved, especially for Harry who had to be a mediator for the two of them.
He was sitting facing Draco, but his eyes were on the pillow between them, “During the war, when I took your wand, it saved my life, it won us the war. I owe you a debt of gratitude-“ Potter was cut of by a short burst of laughter from the blonde beside him. Potter then looked up Draco was wide-eyed, with one slender hand covering his mouth.
“What’s going on Jeremiah?” Draco asked calmly. He knew his staff, and knew that Jeremiah was easily excited.
“They’re fantastic,” he said with his mouth still full.
“You wish.”
“So, I’ll meet you there?” Draco eyed the silver station wagon in the driveway.
Draco wasn’t going there. Draco had known for most of his childhood that he liked guys, but because of his father, never came out. He still hadn’t. He assumed it would have only been a matter of time before he was in a relationship and had to tell his mom.
Harry threw the green dress robes on the bed, picked his jeans off the floor, and walked into the bathroom.
On the other side of London, while Harry was sitting in the first of many meetings of that day, Draco was sitting at his kitchen table staring at Harry’s face.  At first, he wanted to toss the entire volume in the bin, but something stopped him.  So he sat here, just staring at the cover.  He knew that this was for him.  He knew deep down, as a universal truth, that Harry did this for him.  Draco, had been out since he the end of the war.  His father went to prison, he became the controller of the Malfoy Estate, he and his mother decided to sell the property, his mother moved to one of their properties in a quiet magic village in the south of France, with the permission of the Ministry’s parole board.
“Why wouldn’t we?” Draco smirked, dragging Harry into the nearest coffee shop to start setting their plans into action. Already they could spot about 3 different reporters, the reporters clearly spotting them too.
“There,” Harry said, pointing at the map, “Inverness, Scotland, that’s the place.”
“I mean I did die, give my poor head a break.”
“You ready?”
“Potter, there is nothing called that, this is just one of your horrible April Fools pranks,” he spat back, drying off his hair with his towel before throwing it onto a nearby chair. His usually straight hair now looked all fluffy before he combed it back with his hand, trying to make it look slightly better.
“Maybe just the ones that don’t require any death?”
"Charlie was going off somewhere and said she needed a little more love than the other dragons, Edes apparently hates being left alone." Harry looked up to see Draco's concerned face. "What? It's only for a month."
“Draco, my name’s Draco,” he replied with a pounce of confidence.
“So, I have another crucial thing for you to do this year..” He paused for dramatic effect, it was always fun to watch their facial expressions change before they hear what they have to do. Some were excited, some were terrified, Draco, however, tried to look as calm as possible, something that he needed to work on. “It’s about that pesky Harry Potter.”
Deciding that it would be smarter to plan out his next course of action while still near people, even if he was still fairly sure that his mind was just trying to find ways to trick him, rather than just wandering around, Draco waited behind the bush, trying to think about the next possible steps.
“Because I was planning to do the same.” And with that, they both sat there, staring at the fire, snuggled up in the wrong clothes.
The world faded to black.
“Can we bring Edes!”
“Just a flesh wound, nothing too bad,” Harry said, smirking as Draco looked away trying to hide the smile that decided to creep upon his face once again.
“As the daily prophet loves to remind you.”
“Potter, do you even know what this group is about?” Draco asked as Harry began to pour himself a cup of tea too.
“Well, it was bad okay.” Harry humphed, half leaning half falling back more into the couch.
“What do you mean you don’t like gingerbread cookies?” Harry asked, already crunching down on his 15th mini candy cane in the over 2 hours drive of the night as they entered into Birmingham.
“They could report on the… um… new school year coming up! Yea, that would be an article or two, if they really stretch it.”
“Well, I don’t think they sell dragon food so,”
“In the cold?”
“... Do you not remember any of it?”
Moonlight glistened down through the panels of glass that so was scrutinously placed. Shame their only purpose right now was to place a spotlight upon the target—a large, golden trophy that sat proudly on the prince’s dresser.
“Fine, what is this new huge fight about.”
“Right, no more distractions lets go,” Harry said, grabbing the basket before Edes took off running towards the next aisle.
“So, which one should we watch?” asked Harry, pulling their messy pile of DVD’s from the corner of the room to right in front of them to rummage around in.
“And how long since you two wanted to snog each other.”
“You know, the usual. Trying to avoid being all over the newspapers for breathing or eating.”
“The paper that you have to go out and get yourself which usually only feature one person?”
“That wasn’t the only thing,” Harry replied, turning his face, hiding the view of Draco’s face starting to hint red.
“But they’re a classic for a reason, you’ll see. Once we get to Ron’s, I’ll have him whip up the best batch that you’ll ever taste in your life.”
Harry reached out his hand, letting the woman count the money as she placed it on his hand, adding a few coins at the end and a recipe. Harry crunched them up in his hand in an attempt at making sure the coins wouldn’t slip through. He had gotten most of the money back into the pouch when a single bronze coin didn’t quite make it in and fell to the ground before rolling around for a few seconds just to make it more annoying, only stopping when Draco gently placed his foot on it, grabbing it from the ground a second later and tossing it into the bag with the rest of the coins.
“Let’s do this.” Draco took a deep breath in, savoring the few last seconds of peace before what clearly is going to be a storm, gathering up his strength to look out the window as he pushed on the break and pulled the stick into drive, slowly releasing the breaks as the car started to slide down the pavement onto the street. Placing both hands firmly on the smooth, unused steering wheel, he moved his foot over to the gas as he pressed down just in time to turn onto the road, gaining speed as he made his way across the neighborhood at an astounding 10 mph.
Sorry if some of the technical information isn’t right, but I researched all I could and for some reason I couldn’t easily find instructions on how to use the wires and stuff to cause damage, who would have known.
Giving them one last hug, he pushed them to the door like a mom urging her kids forward. Slowly, they creeped inside the dark, box filled room, it’s only smell was the dust covering every surface. Looking around for the only semi-good shelter, they settled on the least destroyed box. Running to sit behind it, they stirred up grey clouds that hovered above them the whole way- both hiding them and making them more noticable. Grimle ran in on the other side of the storage place moments later with a small tool box, barely attempting to keep the tools from bouncing too much as he made his way to a few wires hanging on the wall.
When they finally emerged from the warehouse, the moon was stationed right above them, shining a gentle light on the men gathering back into the open, ready for the final step. A short man in the middle of the crowd gave the slightest nod to a man too in the shadows to see before he turned his gaze directly to Draco and Harry, urging them over with a single glance.
“Great, I could really eat shome cookies right now.” With that, one of the house elves closest to him set off towards the back to find a few cookies they had baked earlier that day.
Harry nodded in agreement, before rubbing his hungry belly. “Sooo, wha’ are ya hungry for?” He asked, placing his elbow on the nearest counter with any space.
Carefully he rang the bell to his -Draco’s?- house, which earned a spot on the list of weird feelings. After a few seconds, he could hear a few footsteps and a little mumbling before the door was cracked open.
“Well, I’m here to get away from everyone that knows me, but clearly I did a rubbish job at that. Why are you here then?”
Harry shuffled over to the station where Draco started to prepare the espresso part. “So, how long have you been working here?”
“Do you really need all that stuff?”
“Heeey um-Harry.”
“I think you need a bit of sleep.”
“What, are you going to miss my old hair,” Draco asked with a smirk spreading across his face. He looked up to see the defeated Harry sit down next to him with a huff. “Aww, poor baby, did I foil your plans.”
“Yea no thanks to you and your charms,” Draco sneered removing one arm from his shirt so that his top hung on him like a sash, allowing the injury to be out in the open. “What, no comeback? Still mad the snatchers stole all of your attention first?”
“S-so,” Draco shivered, his body already playing the fun game of being back at its regular temperature but still believing that it was surrounded by ice. “Where t-to next?”
The bells chimed outside.
“Oh, don’t worry, we can take whatever currency you have, where is it from?”
“What all I said was I knew of a place that is usually empty at night, you were the one to first suggest it.”
“Potter,” the blond hissed, leaning against the wall.
“Don’t be.”
The sun had finally gotten halfway across the sky when Draco came to a halt as he could swear the sounds of the forest were playing a trick on him. Finding the nearest cover behind a bush, Draco waited as the sounds got closer and closer. More familiar. Way too familiar.
“Well, probably not.”
Collecting the bags, Draco began the hike to their room, pausing for a bit at the top to let Harry go before him to open up the door.
Harry nodded, following Draco as they crept out of the house, leaving the room key on the desk with a small little note with just the words thanks and sorry before racing to the car, leaving little footprints behind them carved in the snow that lightly covered the neighborhood from the small storm the night before.
Following Draco as he left the room, Harry hurriedly threw together all his items with a few swishes in his wand before hiding it away in his pocket before any muggle could see it.
“This,” replied Draco before closing the distance between them as little bits of the leftover mist started to swirl around them, twisting in the air like it was just as happy as they were.
So that definitely didn't take forever... Anyways, thanks so much for reading this! <3
Slightly slowing down all the cars behind him, Draco only had to go around the circle twice before he finally got enough courage to pull the car out of the endless cycle, further reminding him why he was not and will never be a Gryffindor, being brave is just too much work in these situations.
Potter took even more time as he strolled over to the target. Draco tensed up, worrying about his chance of success now as Harry picked up the trophy, only allowing Draco to catch his breath again when he placed it back down after removing a folded paper from the bottom.
“Why did you need to consult about giving me back the wand?”
“I’m glad, Harry.”
“Expelliarmus!” Draco shouted. The wand flew through the air and landed in Draco’s palm.
“You’re fantastic at it. I’d love to.” Harry smiled at Draco.
“You’re good with him.” Draco remarked.
“So the game plan.” Harry prompted.  “I’ll wait out there, and when Luna gets home, I’ll send her out to you.  The photographer is already staged out there to get a good shot.”
As the group filtered out to go about their day, Neville to a field in Northern Scotland to look for a rare plant and Ron and Hermione to her parent’s house.  Hermione had repaired their memories, but there were still some side effects like short term memory deficits, but more than that, Hermione was still trying to repair the relationship with them.  Luna was the last to leave, headed to her office to work on the new edition of the Quibbler.  Harry and Ginny secluded themselves to Harry’s study, where they had ended up the night before and where all of the plans were.  Harry, ever paranoid, even in a house of friends, took the wards down just long enough for Ginny and himself to enter and then put them back up, as well as a charm on the front door to warn him if anyone came home.  Ginny rolled her eyes, “Aurors,” she muttered under her breath.
For the next three days Harry and Draco spent the days together. Reading, talking, and catching up on homework. One afternoon after they had had tea, Harry interrupted Draco’s story about finding a boggart when he was seven. “Can we be friends?”
“Very serious. I would not have been able to defeat Voldemort without your wand.” Draco noted that he still flinched at the name of the menacing wizard who made his life a living hell. “I know you were upset, and I intended to give it back sooner, but there were some complications.” Potter seemed to squirm at this confession.
Lost in thought, Draco was startled when Potter turned off the car and looked at him. His eyes were a piercing green. Draco was frozen under the gaze until Teddy barked, “Let’s go!”
As the ceremony starts, Harry turned to the and scanned the crowd until he found the face he was looking for, Draco.  They had been dating for about six months now, and it was the happiest that Harry had ever been.  He smiled when he caught Draco’s eye, and then gave a wink.  Harry could see that Draco laughed and then shook his head, then tilted his head towards the brides.  Harry smiled and turned his focus back.  He was thrilled with how easily Draco had been folded into his life.  His friends all accepted him, because they had known for a while how Harry had felt, and were all happy that he was happy.  Game nights were becoming a regular occurrence with the couples teaming up.  Draco was such a regular fixture at Grimmauld Place, he and Harry were talking about expanding Harry’s room so that they could have the room that they would need if Draco were to move in, and Draco had very specific requirements about the closet, and the bathroom, and color scheme.
“Ron, I’m, er, taking a late lunch.  Let me know if you need me.”
There was a time when he couldn’t leave his flat without someone glaring at him. So, eventually, he moved out of wizarding London and into a modest muggle flat, easily afforded to him from the profits of the shop. In fact, he could probably buy an actual house in London, but the thought of an empty house brought him no joy, so he continued renting. His flat was actually his favorite part about his life. Two bedrooms, hardwood floors, and amazing kitchen to experiment on new pastries. The place was cozy and warm year round thanks to some magical enhancements.
“So did she...” Harry trailed off and began walking towards the tree. “Want to help me open these? Only about four of them are from people I actually know. The rest are from well meaning individuals of the wizarding community.”
Teddy was eager to hold the timer. Both Harry and Draco checked the time and calculated the baking time. The looked at each other
“Harry made this awful dinner yesterday.”
They nodded at each other, and took their stance. Harry had a big smile on his face. Draco felt the worry again. “What?”
It was Thursday, one of the two days Draco was going in these days. He would bake all the cakes, muffins, and croissants for the week and put a stasis charm on them. When he came in on Mondays, he did paperwork. He was working on a new recipe, cranberry and orange zest muffins, not truly original, but new to him. He set a few of the first batch out for customers to sample, to see if they would be popular. The cashier at the till was given instructions to let him know if people love them.
“We wait.” Draco set a timer with a novelty kitchen timer shaped like a cow and handed it to Teddy. “When that goes off, it will be done. Can you hold on to it for me?”
“Yes...” Draco was now confused. Potter was calm, relaxed even in his presence. Draco was conflicted between confusion and his natural inclination to fear.
Harry had seen Draco around a few months ago, and it was as if someone had woken him up from a long sleep.  He asked around and found out that Draco had recently become a Potions Master, but also had a contract with the Ministry.  Now Harry, who had his pick of cases in the auror department, decided he wanted to take down a potions ring.  To anyone that would ask, Harry swore they were coincidental.  However, Harry took the case with the hope of spending lots of long hours on the case.
Harry continued to finish his lemon bar with a smile on his face.
Their lips met, softly, just once, then the lift stopped and they stepped away.  And just once was perfect, for now.  They exited the lift and walked side by side to the floos.
He spelled the messy bowls away, and got tea for three together.
“Actually, I’ve been looking for you,” Potter’s voice was even, and to Draco, intimidating. Draco’s blood ran cold. “I’ve tried sending you owls, but they’ve all come back unopened. I thought about contacting your mother, but I didn’t want to bother her. I thought this was a conversation we should have in person.”
“Nope, not at all, there’s  a surprise waiting for you in the garden.” It was just then that Luna noticed the lights and flowers that could be clearly seen from the window.
Ginny nodded, fidgeted with her shirt, and then headed out.
“I take it back.” Harry said seriously.
“Harry always says there’s nothing wrong with the muggle way.” Teddy called as he was putting on his seat belt.
Harry glanced at his watch, the one that the Weasley’s had given him, it was 2:44. He cast a silencing charm on the timer just as it was going off.  Teddy stirred, but didn’t wake. The pair stood and Harry adjusted Teddy so he was laying down, head propped on a throw pillow.
Draco opened the door, and there stood Harry Potter. For the second time in two weeks, Draco was forced to confront the fact he found Harry Potter very attractive, in fact, combined with who he knew Potter to be, along with their tension during school, Draco couldn’t remembered a time when he found anyone more attractive in his twenty four years of life.
Harry stood up, grabbed a mountain of folders, and tilted his head towards his office.  He set the folders on his desk, while Draco leaned against the doorframe.
Is father, however had been locked safely in Azkaban. For eighteen perfect months, Harry and Draco were in a blissful relationship, Draco stopped pretending to live at his apartment after the second week and after some convincing, their friends accepted the relationship.
When they broke apart, Draco responded, “You know, I think you’re right.”
It was two years ago now, after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry and Ginny along with Ron and Hermione moved into Grimmauld Place.  Over the next year, Luna and Neville also moved in.  Their combined efforts completely overhauled the house from the grim shell, to a lively and beautiful home.  Hermione brought cleanliness and order, Luna brought light and liveliness, Ron and Ginny made the place feel like a home, and well, Neville brought plants, so many plants.  Harry had hired a construction crew, and a crew to remove dark artifacts, there was a celebration the night that the painting of Sirius’s mother finally came down.
“Well, he’s right. I own a muggle coffee shop and do things the muggle way all the time.”
When Draco woke up this morning, he did not imagine his morning going this way, and he still hasn’t brought himself to read more than the covers of the magazine.  He intended on running a few errands before going to the office early, so he was walking in Diagon Alley when his ears picked up fragments of the conversations going on around him.
Harry looked at Draco like he had two heads. “Are you serious?”
They went into Draco’s office and reclined on the sofa. Teddy was between Harry and Draco. They soon fell into a comfortable silence. Draco was lost in thought.
Ron may have been the only person in the meeting to notice the palpable tension between Harry and Draco.  While the three men usually sat together, Harry at the head of the table, Ron on his right, and Draco on the left.  Today, when Draco came in, he sat two seats away from Harry, and was unusually quiet, only speaking when prompted.  Ron could see Harry’s eyes darting to Draco when he wasn’t looking and Draco’s eyes darting to Harry when he wasn’t looking.  Honestly, it was the most interesting meeting Ron had ever been in in his years at the DMLE.
It was a warm summer day, and with Harry stood to the right of the alter and looked down the aisle to see all the heads turning and looking back towards the Burrow.  Arthur was exiting the back door with Ginny on his arm.  She was wearing a one shouldered cream-colored dress.  Her hair was braided to one side with curls lose and flowers tucked in along the long braid.  She held a small bouquet that her mother had put together with Fleur this morning.
“Why have you never baked anything for me before? Harry told me! He told me you made those muffins!”
“Mate, you’re gonna have to put your game face on.  We have meetings all morning.  We have to debrief the last three cases, including a potions case.”  Ron had been the last of his friends to come around to the idea of him and Draco, which was not surprising.  Ron had finally stopped calling Draco a ferret, small steps, Harry thought.
“He makes it easy. He’s a good kid,” Harry said with a shrug.
“Can we sit?” Potter’s eyes were large with sincerity. Draco gestured to the couch behind him and the pair walked over and sat.
With a mischievous gleam in his eye, Draco said, “Make sure she pays up, kid.”
By seven that evening, the back garden looked like a fairy wonderland and Harry was exhausted.  Ginny went to go clean up, and Harry stood guard to make sure no one went out there.  He also coordinated with Winky and Kreature, to get a celebratory meal and drinks together.  Before eight the photographer showed up, and Harry showed him where to stage for the photographs, then went back to his post.  At 7:45, Ginny came down, her hands flumbling with a black jewelry box.
to the moon? That’s impossible.”
“Oh, Ron,” Hermione let out a giggle and Ginny directed her next wink in her direction.
“You break my heart, mate,” he replied before pulling away. “No Hermione yet?”
McGonagall mid-lecture, but before she could direct another dangerous look their way, her office door burst open with a loud bang.
When he could sleep, he did, because despite the nightmares, being conscious had felt even worse, as it left him alone with his thoughts far more than he would have liked, and his mind was not a place he felt safe in anymore.
Her face lit up in a beam, and against the pale golden hair framing her face, almost made her look like she was glowing.
wants Harding to retire except
“Oh, it’s excellent. I didn’t expect it to be so engaging, nor did I expect to have as much choice in my instruction.”
“He said you can go on back,” she told him. He thanked her and walked through the curtain himself, back to where he knew Theo was brewing. Sure enough, in the back workshop, Theo was bent over a cauldron.
Finnigan snorted.
“Why not me?” said Potter, indignantly.
“No. Only the owner of the house can release us.”
“I understand,” Neville said. “The Gryffindors and Slytherins have always been terrible to each other, it’s practically a Hogwarts tradition. But it’s different this year. There aren’t as many Slytherins as usual, and everyone’s really angry at them. I get it, people lost a lot in the war. But that wasn’t the fault of any of the Slytherins that came back, you know? None of the Death Eaters’ kids came back this year. Well, except for—”
“How did you and Heidi start going out anyway?” He asked, wondering if this was perhaps too personal of a question.
it’s just that—”
“Not really,” Draco admitted, his shoulders slumping. He didn’t dare look up at Snape, but McGonagall seemed to know what he was thinking.
“That’s rubbish.”
Harry leaned back into his chair, relieved.
won though, a wand then belongs to
Potter slowly got to his feet, letting his sleeve fall down over his arm and his scar.
He said as much to Malfoy—
A slender woman emerged from the fireplace, flicking back short pin-straight black hair with long and dangerously pointed red fingernails. She looked up at Draco and smirked at the sight of his wand pointed at her.
“Does it matter? You did it.”
and here we are brewing a potion and eating dinner and going to Hogsmeade on weekends and watching Quidditch matches. And it’s hard, but that’s life, right? It just keeps going.”
“Huh? Why?” Harry asked, feeling disoriented, as he tried to refocus on the conversation at hand and dismiss the memories swirling around in his head.
“Fuck, I dunno,” Harry repeated. “Tell me how you got into modelling. Tell me why your father disowned you. Tell me about another constellation.”
“You alright?” Blaise asked, his eyebrows raised.
“Hullo, Harry,” he said, warmly. “What are you doing up so late?”
“I’m here to pick up the signed reports,” Draco said, after Potter had stood to greet him.
Draco watched Potter, standing beside Weasley and smiling at Finnigan’s antics. He wondered when, if ever, he would get tired of watching Potter.
McGonagall raised an eyebrow at him.
“Exactly,” Ginny replied, with a grin of her own now.
“Why do you always do this?” Potter continued, almost talking more to himself than to Draco. “Why do you always have to make things so
A grin started to grow on Harry’s face.
Draco felt the quail shift uncomfortably in his stomach. It had been a long time since someone had mentioned the war. If he were being honest, that was largely why the thought of Pansy had been so disconcerting.
“Did…did The Quibbler say anything about…about Malfoy?” he asked, aiming for nonchalance. He really shouldn’t have bothered, because Hermione’s eyebrow twitched upwards again, that familiar knowing look appearing in her eyes.
Potter was quick to notice the flowers as well.
“How are things going, er, at the W.A.S.?” Potter asked, awkwardly. He did this sometimes, tried to make small talk if Draco didn’t. It was endlessly endearing to Draco, because it indicated that Potter wanted to talk to him, even if it was just because he secretly hated his job.
“Hello, Lovegood,” he replied, wondering what on earth she was doing there. Without an invitation, she sat down on the windowseat beside him, drawing her legs up and crossing them. She regarded him with a dreamy sort of smile.
Hermione was the next to achieve her form, which turned out to be an extremely fluffy brown tabby cat.
Draco sighed. It always came down to Potter, didn’t it? Ever since they had first met, it had all become about Potter.  He remembered eavesdropping on his parents the summer after first year, his mother somewhat uneasily asking, “But is it
Harry saw Sophie as soon as he emerged from the Ministry Floo, sitting by the fountain in the Atrium with a book in her hands and a concentrated expression on her face. He ambled over to her, keeping his distance once he got close because he didn’t want to interrupt her focus.
“I care for her, too.” Daphne’s voice was sad, but Draco was glad to hear it was clear and not close to breaking. “I know she’s your best friend. But my family…you know, Astoria and I are the last in the Greengrass line, and my parents always expected me to marry someone in the Sacred Twenty-Eight, so of course I took the Oath.”
If he’s been less nervous, maybe he would’ve noticed how odd the corridor was, even for Hogwarts. There were no windows; the hall was lit with high-hanging torches, charmed to keep their flames burning at all times. There were also no paintings, which was unusual for Hogwarts, where most walls were covered with portraits of various figures from magical history.
Suddenly remembering that this was actually dor Draco’s apprenticeship, Harry took this as his cue to say goodbye.
Draco didn’t even try to keep his jaw from falling open.
And Merlin. The other Houses. He’d be eaten alive before even taking a seat at the Slytherin table.
“Cutting it close today, Malfoy,” said Finchley. Draco stopped in his tracks, his hands twitching at his side.
Draco had a very strange expression on his face, looking as though someone had just clubbed him in the head. What followed was a stretch of silence so long that Harry almost thought Draco had just decided to ignore him, until he spoke.
Violet and Daphne had become excellent hosts thanks to these dinners. Over the years, the food had only improved and, as the guest list expanded, even the décor had gotten classier. It terrified Draco to think about, but they were almost proper adults now, having
“Hey Harry!” Dennis greeted him. “Please don’t hug Ginny right now, the lighting is falling perfectly and I don’t want her to mess it up.”
right? Balance? Peace? Who are they trying to fool?
Of course, he very much
she asked, her eyes shining brightly. “Becoming an Animagus is such a difficult process and you don’t get to choose the form you’ll take, but Self-Transfiguration is completely up to you! I wonder why it isn’t taught more often; I suppose the downside is the spell only lasts a certain amount of time, but as long as you can reapply it, that shouldn’t be a problem. I’m so curious to see what else is more commonly taught in other wizarding schools.”
After a long moment of silence, Draco spoke again.
“Fascinating,” he said, quietly, before looking at Harry. “As I’m sure you’ve heard many times now, you are a very powerful wizard. However, we do have to make sure you have a firmer control over your magic. As an instructor, you certainly do not want your magic acting out in the classroom, and I guarantee that emotions will get high at times. I also think, though, that there is more you are capable of with such strong magic. If you’re able to fully control your magic, I think there is a potential for exploring some Ancient Magic, if you have an interest, of course.”
“The kitchen is not a
thing, Ron,” insisted Hermione.
“I’ll meet you in the common room,” he said to Hermione, giving her a reassuring smile in order to calm the worried expression on her face.
“We better start practicing then.”
Saturday had been the last real day of the shopping season, but it had already been winding down for days now. The next two weeks would still see a few last-minute students scrambling to get all their supplies, but in much smaller numbers. It hadn’t even been necessary to stay all day, but Draco had done so just in case.
“Yea, we’re starting really late tonight so we can get through 2 hours tonight, 6 hours tomorrow -there’s lots of sights to see on the way there so I can just assume that we’re gonna wanna take a lot of breaks and we’ll need lots of sleep, then we can finish the last hour on Sunday, easy.”
Harry nodded, pulling up the ottoman and laying out where the wall will actually go. Next, they put all the cushions that were a part of the couch for the wall and surrounding them in the inside were the smaller pillows that can’t hold up as much weight. On the outside there was every single possible item they could use to help hold up the pillows more, ranging from a chair to suitcase. Finally, they threw all the blankets over it, making sure they draped across any crack and the entrance.
“Here,” Harry replied, pulling out muggle currency from his bag, handing it to the lady.
Edes bounced along the grass patch, the motion causing a little fire to escape her mouth unnoticed by everyone but Draco who hurriedly tried to hide the grass she scorched. “Harry, are you sure the muggles won’t think she’s different.”
Near the front, there was a long desk with the menu spread out behind it and a small person maintaining the counter, occasionally glancing over to the two, clearly ready to do something other than stand around and wait all day.
Harry stayed silent for a second, “Did I die heroically?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hi, yes, um. Can I have a tart cream cheese?” Harry started, staring up at the words as he read them out.
“Perfect, then this will fit right in. Just, um, follow my lead.” Waiting a second before they heard the rush of cameras clicking from a few blocks away, Draco leaned closer to Harry, mumbling fumos as he pointed his wand to them, making fog begin to gather up around their face. Any chance of the cameras getting a picture of them disappeared as the smoke began to cover up every lens. Out of the corner of their eye, they could see the reporteres trying to clean their cameras before it’s too late, or frantically pulling out new, worse quality back up cameras, and becoming more and more frustrated as they fogged up almost immediately after they took off the lens cap.
Harry thought before heading back to his room to prepare for the next surprise, casting one last glance to see Draco staring at the door. Harry ran off, hoping Draco didn’t see him.
“And by a few more you mean all of them?”
“And how far is that?”
“Potter! Is this a cookie.” Draco held up a spoon, with a few deliberate holes in it.
“Draco I-“
“Yea, well, I need to be prepared,” Draco replies, tugging at his light jacket a bit to better protect himself from the light cold outside.
“The tent’s got to be around here somewhere, Ron. I'm sure it was next to the weird shaped tree.”
“Hi again Draco.”
“Nonsense, they’ll just think it was a trick of their eyes,” Harry responded, opening the nearby door, making a little bell go off, causing Edes to jump, before leaping up on the nearest clerk, trying to hug the new person.
Harry took a sip of his coffee, sticking his murdered napkin half underneath the little plate that came with it. “I’ll get him some chocolates just in case.”
Harry though,
“Cause a bit of ruckus?” Harry asked, reaching into his jacket.
“Perfect!”
“But-“
After the cookie disappeared from his mouth, he started to hear soft snoring near his ear. Smiling, he called it a night, and fell asleep on his head, messing up the blond hair even more than it was before.
“Maybe there were two weird shaped trees?”
“What the bloody hell are you doing?”
Hoping that Draco understood the reference, after all, they were underneath the stars, he put an origami note next to the plate and hid under the invisibility cloak once more.
Draco kicked at the man’s knee, making him fall to the ground, letting the door swing and hit him. Before the other man could realized that it was taking his partner a bit too long, the sounds of the police could be heard as they ran into the building.
"So!" Harry asked excitedly, "Can she stay here?"
Pansy and Blaise simply got up, never taking their eyes off of Harry as they went into the kitchen, where they will still likely overhear everything they say.
Once Hermione finally left to help Ron get food while mummering something about a pair rule of exploring did Draco finally begin to inspect his arm.
“Why are you using those?”
“Draco and I had a fight.”
“Or teleport the house.”
The front door swung open, causing a breath of fire to fly across the room in self-defense, scorching the door frame, narrowly missing the shocked man that stood outside the house. “Potter! Can you please explain to me why a dragon almost burned my hand?"
The familiar chime of bells rang as Harry pushed open the door as the sun barely rose in the distance. Coffee Cauldron is known as one of the main coffee hotspots in the city, or so Harry had heard, and he was in desperate need to put that theory to the test.
“I know,” Harry said, sitting down on the small spot left next to Draco.” But now we can do this our way, make better memories even if we use magic. Maybe we could just use it as a light source.”
“No, wait, who? Who died?”
Harry sat there a minute, watching the sunset, before remembering his mission. He pulled out his wand and a little note. With a few sparks, the note flew over to be above the lake before growing in size and folding into a swan. It fell gracefully about a few meters from the shore and swam to Draco.
“I hope so.”
They sat on the couch together for an hour, each doing their own thing, happy in each other’s arms while Eres happily jumped from getting hugged by one person to the next. Draco was reading his book, tea in hand, while Harry picked up the latest edition of the Quibbler, soon to be interrupted by a grumbling from a stomach.
They ate in quiet, taking in the amazingness of the sugar for a moment until Draco pushed the jar to Harry and leaned not-so-gracefully against the wall.
They could hear the distant sound of the register being opened along with the sound of another person roaming the room, most likely trying to prove that the place isn’t empty.
“Maybe I’ve read a few more of yours than other peoples.”
Draco grabbed Harry’s sleeve, tugging at it slightly. “C’mon, we maybe should go before she realizes that her pyramid of food isn’t quite a pyramid anymore.”
“Sure you are,” Draco smirked.
The moonlight that once focused on the trophy now turned its spotlight onto Harry, illuminating him in, unfortunately, all the right places. Not that Draco was looking at all, choosing instead to admire the sparse furniture in the room—just a dresser upon, which sat a collection of knick knacks and the trophy, along with a bed that leaves no one wondering if royalty slept in it—until the moon drifted enough again to then illuminate a random spot on the floor. By that point, the prince started to fold the paper back up, tucking it back under the trophy before bringing a hand to his eyes for a few seconds.
Draco chuckled, switching the car into drive and starting down the road far enough so he could turn around without destroying a few mailboxes, making the car jumble out a few unsettling noises as he made the turn around, before pushing it off as having something to do with the cold. They only made it a few seconds away from the house before Harry turned the radio on low so they could hear the faint sound of Jingle Bells as they chatted, staring out into the big open fields that soon surrounded them.
“Oui, come on.” Harry’s smile faded as another thought popped up in his head. “There’s one last thing that I can’t figure out… How did you end up here?”
On the menu, there were rows of unique toppings and combinations for different crepes, including dessert versions of them, which, like always, have taken root in the back of Draco’s mind that he will just have to ignore until he gets something actually fulfilling.
“Hey Harry, I guess the piccolo latte really made an impact on you.”
“Not yet, but I would adore to.”
As it swam, it left ripples in the still water, making the event more breathtaking. Once it finally reached the shore, it went towards Draco and lowered its head.
“Well, thanks. I was starting to actually worry about the chances of us all dying there.”
“We can figure out something else.”
With the sun finally setting, casting pastel pinks and purples across the lake and, from what Draco could see, onto Harry’s face. “Hey, I think there’s a little-” he reached across to Harry’s hair, using the almost non-existent light to help, grabbed a little branch with a small green leaf still attached to it out of the curls- “There.” Draco held it in the palm of his hand for a second, before tossing it on the ground.
Draco reached for the new jar, not questioning why it appeared out of thin air, and a smile formed across in face in seconds. “Potter! I found it!”
One, a tall blond wearing an all-black outfit which almost matched his grey eyes. The other was in similar clothing, with dark brown, untidy hair sticking out from under his black beanie.
After Grimle, the man that greeted them the day before at the door, went over with Harry and Draco about what they were about suppose to do, which would of worked out great if Grimle didn’t have the idea that the two of them had any previous knowledge on how to deal with wires and stuff, which they definitely did not. But, how hard can it be, right?
, he reasoned,
“Both? After all what’s a better date then constantly apparating in and out of locations, barely stopping long enough to feel dizziness.”
“Deal,” he replied, shaking on it.
The two of them sat there until the sun was about to rise, well out of snacks by then. Most of the birds in the trees barely got any sleep from them chatting loudly all night, barely stopping to write ideas down or eat.
“Well, if we want something romantic and still get the press to see us… how about some coffee?”
__________________________
Harry’s face lit up with excitement, “Then we need a disguise!”
Defeated, they decided on the plan to just sneak in quietly, sadly without a dragon.
Thanks for reading this, and I hope you enjoyed! <3 (Also, I have no clue how to write kisses so I hope it turned out okay!)
Within a second, they arrived underneath an umbrella the ice cream parlor had sitting out.
“Good,” Harry replied, nodding off to sleep, safe and cozy, just how it should be.
The voices continued to circle around the trees for a few minutes longer before disappearing without a trace.
“Potter, you do realize that they’re gonna be so messy in there,” Draco chuckled, peering into the coat pocket to see little pieces of lettuce and meat covering the wall, not to mention all the fuzz has already started to cover a few tomatoes.
As slightly more common sense was able to get into Draco's brain after the huge rush of adrenaline, Draco pointed his wand at the attacker, staring him down as realization drew on the man's face right before he apparated away.
“Ready?” Draco asked, grabbing Harry’s hand in one hand and his vanilla burst in the other.
“Of course, they’re amazing.”
Against the silence of the night, a few hours before the birds are set to be awake, Draco’s stomach made its displeasure with his situation very visible. Thanking Merlin for remembering to put up a silencing charm, Draco grabbed an apple and scoffed it down as he cleaned the leaves out of his head and packed up all his items into his bag, which didn’t take long at all- just a blanket, and an old shirt that he bunched up into a makeshift pillow. Not after long, Draco took all his charms down and set off through the forest again.
Once they regained their balance, they grabbed a small shopping basket and went off in search of something she could eat, or more like Edes pulled them along to find something to eat. They didn’t expect how fast Edes could go, and that was only on her feet. Not to mention that she easily pulled both of them along wherever she went. It took all their strength just to hold onto the leash.
He sighed before calling Draco in to see the progress of his task to get Dumbledore out of the picture, after all, the boy needs to be ready when he gets on the train tomorrow.
After a few moments of waiting for someone to return back into view, a dash of Hermione to the tent followed by a screech gave away their failure. Peaking way too much around the bush, Draco could see Ron jumping on the back of one of the guys and Hermione throwing一both magically and physically一everything she could to distract the other snatcher who happened to be carrying a still slightly awake Harry under one of his arms. As the guy became unfazed to Hermione's best efforts, he started to apparate away, leaving Draco no time to consider how idiotic his next possbile moves were.
“Only 9 hours.”
"Can you make it back?"
Both placing them on lopsided, they knocked on the large door. Not realizing that it was too soft for anyone to hear inside, they let themselves in when no one opened the door.
“Harry, are you going to fight them?”
“Ready?”
Everything was fine, that was until they reached the floor where Harry happened to figure out that his knee didn't bend very well- or at all. Draco helped pull up the bottom half of Harry's pants to reveal Harry's knee, which looked a little worse for wear. Around the knee, there was a layer of blood with little bits of the pant's fabric stuck in it. The actual knee was no better, looking like it had just had a horrible adventure in hell.
Harry could only yawn in response, trying so hard not to fall asleep on the floor. Barely able to get any more words out, he just nodded in response and headed off to bed, tiredly excited for the evening.
“Of course I am, I’ve been training for this.... but maybe keep a healing spell at the ready, just in case.”
As soon as the footsteps faded away, Draco could feel the weight of the bed tip as the empty spot was finally filled again. The man drew back his hood to show his black and ruffled hair, complete with static hairs sticking up in between all the dirt that found its (definitely not everlasting) home.
With the threat gone, Draco looked around at the miles of pure grass around him, which happened to contain not a single clue as to where they were before the apparation and now.
“Well, I would love to see that happen.” Draco prepared the cup and finished it by making three little hearts on top of each other before taking a pen and purposely trying to make the whole process as visible as possible as he wrote his number on a napkin and placed it on the plate and made sure that it wasn’t hidden by the cup as he handed it to Harry, who took it, half terrified that it would spill over and ruin the number.
Harry took his wand out of his pocket and, for the first time, muttered the charm’s antidote.
Draco sighed, “Even if it doesn’t work, I guess it could be a little fun to try.”
“Ugh, what time is it?”
“Thanks.” Harry giggled, his laughter blending in with the soft sounds of the grass ruffling from the breeze. “I didn’t even notice it.”
“I am. Truly.” Harry grabbed Draco’s hand from his good arm, “This can be your home for now, if you’d like.”
The world got fuzzy again.
“Killing a few?”
Harry reached down and opened his drawer next to his bed and pulled out a piece of paper with all his ideas for tomorrow on it. It was all over the place, but somehow Harry understood the messiness on the paper. It was already 11 pm on February 13th, so he decided to get to work.
It only took 10 minutes before Draco showed up, with his first letter in hand. He walked over to the gear laying on the floor and picked up the note. He carefully unfolded it from the little origami shape, trying to straighten it out and read it. Smiling, he jumped on his broom before racing off after he saw a little glint of gold fly around in the air a few meters above his head.
The last few months, however, seemed to drag on. Draco felt like he was swimming in muddy water. He couldn’t see or think clearly. He’d given many of the responsibilities of the shop over to the manager, so he was in the shop less. He was hoping he just needed a break. After three weeks of only working two days, it was clear a break wouldn’t fix whatever was wrong.
“No to both?”
Harry had other plans. Draco came home from the Manor after spending the day finishing the plans, and Harry was in their bedroom wearing black dress robes. The rest of his dress robes were laid out on the bed.
Harry smiled and patted his pocket, “Your first one is always the best, isn’t it?”
Harry and Draco opened the presents from Draco’s mom and Harry’s friends first. Harry teared up at a letter that was tucked into a lumpy sweater. At first Draco thought Harry was crying because of the ugly sweater.
“Yes, but I saved the world, so all is forgiven. Right?”
Draco became a potions master, and opened a private shop on his new property outside London, and then soon after became a consultant with the ministry.
Harry took the package. The wrapping fell open in his hands. Inside held socks. Not a single one matched, and they all looked handmade. Harry had tears streaming down his face. “Thank you Kreacher. Thank you.”
Harry and Ginny stayed up for several more hours that night coming up with a plan on how to fix the situation.  The problem wasn’t just Draco, but the wizarding world in general.  Outside of his group of friends and family, no one else even knew Harry and Ginny weren’t together.  The plan they came up with would take about two weeks and would turn out to be the longest two weeks Harry had ever lived.
A month later, after closing another case, Ron said “I guess he’s alright,” as Draco was leaving the office.  After that night, Harry took Draco to the pub and wound up on the floor.
“Mr. Malfoy!” An urgent voice called from the entry of the kitchen.
“I thought so,” when Potter smiled, his eyes crinkled at the sides and Draco wished he would smile more, “So, are you riding with us and The Beach Boys?”
“Baby, I’m so sorry,” he gushed. Without opening his eyes, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and pressed his face against his stomach. He was talking into Draco’s stomach, “Baby, I cant hear you.”
Ginny walked in the room at this moment and laughed, “What’s wrong with you?” She then pushed his feet off the couch and plopped down next to him.  Harry did not uncover his eyes when the slender redheaded woman took his side.  She started nudging his thigh with her elbow, “Tell me,” in a sing song voice.
Draco knew what she was implying, but rather than address the fact he would usually hide in order to pretend that the Saint Harry Potter wasn’t a part of his life, instead he spoke coolly, “Would you like me to get the door?”
“Come on in,” Draco invited.
“Just like take it out of your hands?” Draco asked suspiciously.
“I was trying to protect you. I always felt like he was going to ruin us. And look at us. Our first big fight. Over him. But he would have hated how quickly we made up.” Draco never wanted to get out of this bed ever again. He felt Harry’s warmth radiating through him and his toes were tucked under Harry’s legs so every part of him was warm.
Saturday morning, with everyone gathered around the table in the downstairs kitchen, eating the fry up that Harry cooked, Ginny asked Luna if she could hold the front and back pages of the Quibbler’s next issue.
Harry, looked into Draco’s stormy grey eyes and raised his eyebrows in question.
Draco had the Monday blues. Well, Draco had the Monday blues almost everyday it seemed like. He’s worked in the small café for last seven years. Well, that’s kind of true. He had worked there for year when the owners had to sell the shop. Draco managed to convince his mother to let him use some of the remaining Malfoy money to buy the small muggle coffee shop, tucked away in a tiny corner of London. He convinced her it would make him happy.
“Draco, I have a question,” Harry finally said.
Harry was so different in real life than Draco had made him into in his head. Draco imagined a man burning with anger and put for revenge. This was the last hold over from the war for Draco. He held on to the fact that Harry would hate him. Without that, were the wounds all gone. Harry nudged Draco then pointed at Teddy who was fast asleep.
“What are you doing here?” Draco was practically whispering. Jeremiah had the good sense to step away and pretend to clean the espresso maker. Draco stared at Potter. He noted the same dark unruly hair, same eyes, his glasses were a little wider, but still round, so that they fit his adult face better. Wearing a pair of jeans and a black plain shirt, Draco noticed the curves of muscles on the man.
Three days ago, Lucius Malfoy died. He started refusing food, and now Narcissa and Draco had to plan a small quiet funeral at Malfoy Manor.
“Harry, I don’t doubt that, but the way we fell in love, it was an impossible situation.  We were both facing near certain death, but look at the way things have been since then.  We are basically just flatmates.  We haven’t had sex in forever, you subscribe to a whole lot of quidditch magazines, and I don’t think you’re looking for a new broom, and when your eyes wander, as all eyes wander, you are not looking at other women, you’re looking at men.” She paused collecting herself. “Harry, there was so much pressure on us to be together after the war, because of my family, because we were so grateful to be alive, and I think because we were scared.  I don’t think we should stay together just because we think it’s the right thing to do.” Ginny’s face had a pleading look on it. Pleading Harry to accept the reality she had just laid out.
Harry smiled a shy smile and picked up the box on the counter. “How much?”
But now, that plan was spectacularly blowing up in Harry’s face.  Ginny and Luna had been dating for about a year now.  The group of friends had bets on how soon the Prophet would take to catch on to the relationship.  Luna’s bet was that the Prophet would never catch on, she didn’t seem to care what the world thought, but Draco did seem to care.
They slipped across from each other in a booth away from the window.  Harry handed Draco a menu, and sat one in front of him, opened it, and then shut it a second later.  Draco took his time looking over the menu, but ultimately selected his favorite green curry.  He knew that Harry would get chicken pad Thai.
Draco had a lump in his throat. He couldn’t help remember all the horrible names he had ever called his former house elf, and here Harry was crying over socks he had made.
“It’s the cassette we’re listening to. The Beach Boys, it’s an American muggle band.” Potter fiddled with the keys in his hands. “You can ride along if you want. If you don’t mind going the muggle way.”
That was over two years ago.  After slowly coming to terms with what Ginny had said, along with quite a few sessions with a mind healer.  Ginny had left for her training two weeks after that conversation, but she never officially moved out.  She used the house for her London base, it was easier and cheaper than finding her own place, plus she and Harry remained close friends, without the pressure of a relationship, they were closer than ever.
“What?” Draco asked, “The truce?”
“Call your girlfriend,” Draco sneered looking down at Harry.
“Today it does.”
“Pleeeease,” was Teddy’s response, directed at his guardian.
“It boiled down to a difference in what we wanted from a partner?”
The house elves filed out, and McGonagall gave one final look around the room, she parted with “Enjoy gentlemen,” and walked out of the room.
“Black is fine.”
“What complications?” Draco arched an eyebrow.
“After breakfast we can go to my bakery. Sound good?” Draco addressed his question mainly to Potter.
“Common Draco! It’s Beach Boy week!” Teddy implored.
Harry snorted silently.  Prepare, indeed.  Ever since he had left the Infirmary, he had to deal with having Qye inside his head around other people.  It had taken him a couple of days to control his shivers whenever the other boy had felt the sudden urge to flip through his life.  (He remembered one particular incident where he had been half-asleep at the breakfast table, sitting next to a first-year Hufflepuff, when his new companion had decided to find out more about the Houses.  After managing to find a pitiful excuse for his jerk, he had offered to buy the poor girl a new sweater.)
“I’m going to start by saying I will not be revealing the details of our conversations.  If I hope to maintain any form of rapport, this will remain an important aspect in my relationship with the two of them.  In addition, I will be honest with them about anything we discuss.  With that…”
“Physically?” She glanced at Jonas, who waved a hand at her, leaving it to her.  “They are progressing from the separation and their prognosis remains positive.  Magically, Qye continues to display no signs of it.  We believe Harry’s exhaustion to be temporary, a likely side-effect of the separation process that will most likely fade away as his magic stabilizes.  Mentally, they can each reason rationally and engage in critical thinking as necessary.”  She paused, her finger tracing the edge of her copy.  “Emotionally and socially, they require a lot of support moving forward.”
His idiot twin fortunately seemed to know what he was thinking and closed his mouth quickly, wincing.  “Sorry, cousin,” Jacob muttered, lowering his eyes to the floor, a submissive look on his face.  “I was just saying - ”
Harry’s eyes flashed up at the Slytherin and he slammed his bag closed.
“Gee, thanks,” he muttered, slouching in his chair.  Hermione grinned a bit and ruffled his hair.  His eyebrows shot up and he looked in surprise at her, along with Ron.  She blushed.
And then his world faded.
She rolled her eyes and shook her head.  “I’ll probably cast a few more counters after we finish eating,” she grumbled.  “Maybe dunk him in the Black Lake if he doesn’t come clean.”  She headed over to the Gryffindor table, still muttering under her breath about jinxes and personality switches.  Harry merely smiled faintly as he left the Great Hall, ducking past a pair of curious Ravenclaws.
She stepped uncertainly closer to Lest, trying to think of how to soothe away the look on his face.  She had to stop that look before someone – likely Draco – got hurt and dimly wondered why Lest was so upset.  Before she could do anything, Lest turned away.
Qye wasn't the only one whose tensions were leaving. When Professor Opacre entered, he felt the other students calm, Seamus going as far as muttering "Thank you" and Neville letting out a relieved sigh.
A cool hand pressed against his back.
:: Qye said quietly and Harry blinked, momentarily slowing in his steps before resuming his brisk walk.  Hermione and Ron continued to talk behind him, unaware of his reaction.
Neville staggered as he was released from the telekinetic hold and Dean snapped out of it, rushing forward to grab his friend and pull him back.
Something touched the tips of his fingers and he looked down.
,’ he decided and walked on slowly strengthening legs to the door.
she thought approvingly.
announced the arrival of the Death Eaters, some scowling as fiercely as a few of the vampires.
They had dodged out of the Three Broomsticks, leaving a pouting Seamus with Dean who promised to let Ron and Hermione know that they were out for a walk.  Zabini had just shrugged and wandered back to the Slytherins after Draco gave him a long look.
He stared up at the mahogany ceiling, whirling and scratching sounds faintly sounding while his body lay heavy in a warm bed.
The exclamation broke the class from their enchanted spell. They all turned to him and he could feel his cheeks heating up dramatically. It didn't help that Lest shot him a dirty look as he quickly hid his necklace beneath his shirt again.
he groaned silently to himself.
“Fuck. Off. Lest,” he bit out and Harry exploded a sigh and struggled against him.
Harry had a flashback to Draco telling him he had gone to the Opacre heir’s bonding when he was ten.  A sickening feeling began to grow in his stomach.
Qye raised an eyebrow but Weasley just continued to grin stupidly. ‘
for the wizarding world to realize that Fudge wasn’t the wizard for the job.  ‘
:: Qye said, shocked.  Harry felt Qye was looking through his eyes.  ::
In his enhanced vision, he saw the teachers and proctors try to sort the students as a few other adults joined Dumbledore striding behind him.  He briefly felt the fear from Harry’s friends, felt their frustration at being blocked from leaving by one of the professors, heard Marylin whisper a quick reassurance before she followed Lest’s instructions.
“Yes,” she said softly as she worked.  “A long time ago.”
’ Harry thought briefly, as he ducked out of the Great Hall in between written exams.  He flashed a sense of apology towards Qye.
"You know what?" Professor Opacre broke in irritably, crossing her arms. "I think you have more than enough information to go on." She waved a hand at them, moving off her desk. "Up you go, to the back of the room with all of you unless you wish to be the first guinea pig."
“We’ve been stuck here since we woke up - ”
“Harry?” Hermione questioned softly, looking at him when didn’t say anything.  “Harry, are you all right?”
’ she thought to herself, annoyed.  Taking a deep breath again, she opened her eyes and looked sternly at her class.
He frowned slightly, feeling a tinge of disappointment come from Qye.  ::
-------
"I can see we're going to have some resistance about this," Professor Opacre said in a dry voice, cutting off the students' protest and Qye's response before it began.
:: he thought absently.  ::
“The faster you eat, the faster you can go to the Infirmary.”
Marylin hastily closed up her office and hurried to catch her brother.  As she met his pace, she glanced at him from the corner of her eye.
The brown-haired man frowned at black-haired Saira.  “I was only saying,” Leon said in his mild voice, showing how insulted he was, “that we should not make light of the end.  As it is said, no war - ”
With a final violent shake, the beast lay still, its eyes glazed over in its bloodied face.
“And which is which, exactly?” Harry asked dryly as he jumped off the last rung of the ladder.
"What part of
He jumped slightly as he felt a hand fall on his shoulder.  Blinking, he looked at the gnarled hand on his shoulder then up at the sorrowful figure of Dumbledore.  The blue eyes looked down at him sadly and the hand squeezed his shoulder.
Qye’s fist cracked against the stone and he heard Harry’s sharp inhale as he hissed and pulled back, rubbing at his reddened knuckles.  When he turned to Harry, sitting upright and concerned, he gave him a look with all the anger still boiling under his skin.
“Harry!  Wake up!”
Remus was eyeing the Firewhiskey bottle when he heard the soft thud of glass on wood, turning in time to see Sirius’ hands coming up and clutching his head.  Remus squeezed his hands, helpless and anxious and on edge for tomorrow.
Harry’s mind was whirling with the influx of new information, barely mindful of Qye silently listening in.  A thought struck him and he frowned at Draco.  “Wait…if wizards and vampires have really had this animosity all this time, why did your father try to tie you in?”
The Gryffindor swallowed at the low murmur from above, the voice sounding like velvet.  Harry blinked rapidly, his breath coming out shallowly.  He still couldn’t manage to think…
He blinked and lifted his eyes from the floor to meet Granger and Weasley’s curious faces. He forced a smile and shook his head, shoving his hands in his pockets to hide him clenching them painfully.
:: Harry snapped, taking in deep breaths to calm himself, dropping his hands from his face.  ::
She jotted down the name of class and watched as the ink shimmered into parchment a moment before fading away.  While she waited for the attendance list to appear, she glanced quickly at the lone pair of eyes that held neither fear, nor mistrust, nor anger towards her.  Instead they looked steadily at her, calm and serene like the sea.  Yes, there was wariness in them but there was no sign that the boy had judged her already.
“…when did
:: Qye said dryly and Harry smiled inwardly.
He said nothing as he caught up with the other teenager, meeting Draco’s strides with his own.  The blond stalked the road, his body language all but screaming.
hit the woman’s hand and she screamed at the audible crack, blade falling to the floor.
“No, it was nothing,” he said quietly. Weasley and Granger exchanged looks and Qye cleared his throat, beginning to walk to the four House tables, a forced grin on his face. He didn’t know how he was going to deal with the rest of the Gryffindors but there was no way he could escape and no point in delaying it. “Come on, you guys want to get me back to the Infirmary, don’t -”
Qye said nothing for a long while.
:: Qye smirked.  ::
“I’m not afraid of you.”
Qye softly reminded him.
"You did very well, Hermione," Professor Opacre smiled kindly at Hermione, who blinked. The vampire gently edged her and Hermione walked back to them, only pausing momentarily to look back uncertainly at Lest. Lest, however, seemed to have forgotten about her as her resumed his crossed-armed pose with a bored expression.
The windows shook and the bookshelves rattled.  None of them acknowledged it, having grown used to ignoring the bursts of abrupt telekinesis Qye radiated after the end of the second day.
:: Qye trailed off.
This year, it seemed Dumbledore – it had to be Dumbledore, Harry just couldn’t see any of the other teachers arranging to do something like this – wanted to promote inter-house relations as well as inter-magical relations.  All the classes of the Gryffindors were doubled with one house or another.  But that wasn’t what had convinced Ron that their beloved Headmaster was truly senile.  Oh no, what had convinced his fiery friend was that fact that almost all their classes were paired with the Slytherins.
,” Harry said, placing special emphasis on the other boy’s last name.  Draco’s eyes darkened and Harry smiled tightly, slinging the bag over his shoulder.  “Are you going to leave me alone now?”  Without waiting for a response, he turned away to leave the classroom.
“I don’t know…” Hermione responded uneasily, her brown eyes also looking confusedly at the map. “It never has before…”
He felt Qye’s confusion and sighed.
Hermione blinked.  They stared at each other for a moment, baffled by their simultaneous questions.
Harry nodded and backed off, already hearing the whispers starting.  “Try and make sure Ron doesn’t make any more deals, yeah?” he grinned at her.
“Hang on,” Black said, his voice wavering as she shifted her gaze to him.  He stared at her, his hands gripping the report tight in his hands while Lupin held it open in his lap and read silently.  “What does…I mean, it’s good they’re not - ”  He fumbled with his words, struggled much as he had in that final observation.
“Ron, don’t be so biased,” Hermione reprimanded, but she too glanced uneasily at the vampire.  “I’m sure Dumbledore knows what he’s doing.  Don’t you think so, Harry?”
And the volume suddenly went up, just a little bit, because he heard the surprised cries from the other students, Hermione's worried voice and Ron's low curses penetrating them and he even thought he heard Professor Opacre cry out to, voice concerned one moment, scolding the next.
-------
Lest shared a look with Myn, who Qye realized had not said a word.  She sat quietly, looking at a report in her lap, smoothing her hand over it.
He winced slightly at the suspicious look growing in Granger’s eyes.
:: he asked, startled and blinking as his vision adjusted and the pain disappeared.  ::
He had seen the look in the vampire’s face when Harry had collapsed – he didn’t let himself think thrown – into his arms that night. Seen the delighted pleasure and hungry lust behind the gentleness.
“Possibly better since we’re liberating them from him,” George added as he popped up on Zabini’s other side.  The dark-skinned boy uneasily shifted between the twins and warily kept his hands to himself.
He was smiling a slightly warm smile, the ice gone from his usually hard blue eyes.
’ he thought, his green eyes looking at her.  Sighing, he turned away and jogged up to catch up to his best friends.  ‘
“I don’t know what anyone can do,” Harry said, gently breaking Hermione’s hold as he turned away from her.  “Unless you know a way to help me get these thoughts out of my head,” he mumbled.
He paused as he came to what looked like the final page and read it.
“Show us what?” Sirius snapped, clenching and unclenching his hands.  “Can someone please just give us a straight answer as to what the hell is going on?”
I hope you stay with me and I appreciate you taking your time to read, leave kudos, comment or anything.  Thank you.  See you soon!
She was left with two recommendations.
:: the voice replied quickly and he frowned.  ::
Qye was a heavy ache in his mind.
But she had no sense of warning as the premonition came.
“Here then,” Professor Opacre smiled, dropping the clothes in his arms and bustling him behind the privacy screen she erected after he tried to escape the fifth time.  “I know this is it, I would’ve gone with green but I feel like I should save that and goodness knows this will look just as well on you - ”
She stopped in front of him, still smiling, but now he saw the tension in her shoulders, the wary consideration in her bright blue eyes.
Ron and Hermione exchanged worried looks, clearly unconvinced.
The teenager didn’t respond, merely watched him with disturbingly emotionless eyes, one arm curled around his middle while his chin rested on his other hand, his fingers covering his mouth.  Jonas noted that there was no scar on this one’s forehead.
At that moment, Harry became aware of a few things.  One, he had just called Malfoy by his first name with the name just seeming to roll off his tongue with ease.  Two, Draco was looking both surprised and furious, surprised because of the use of his first name and furious because Harry wasn’t allowing him to draw his wand.  Three was that although Harry couldn’t see him, he could feel Lest’s cold glare burning into his back, making him want to shake with fear and move from his spot between the two.  Four was that Qye’s feeling of shock had just grown.
Ever since they met at King’s Cross, Hermione had been shooting him worried looks and probing at him, obviously trying to get him to talk.  He hadn’t sent many letters over the summer and she had obviously taken this as a sign that there was something
He stopped as he caught sight of an exit, leading to the grounds of Hogwarts. He pondered for a moment, then, without hesitation, walked outside.
“Lest?” she said uncertainly.
“And every year we throw it back in his face,” Hermione said calmly, letting go of Ron’s arm and walking to the Potions classroom.  “Don’t let him get to you, Ron.  Just think of how he might get humiliated this year.”
There was a moment of silence.
His cousin stood at the head of the table and sat down as silently as he came in and Jordan gave a start when he noticed the other person who had walked in behind his cousin.  He hadn’t thought his other cousin would make an appearance, as she usually wasn’t in the meetings.  His forehead furrowed as he wondered why she was here now.
:: he said grudgingly.  ::
Harry said desperately as he stumbled back, the vampire striking right where he had been and taking a chunk out of a tree next to them.
“You saw him looking at Harry too, right?” said Malfoy.  Ron watched as his hand tightened around his drink before slowly releasing it.
,’ he thought, looking down at the ground and feeling the rain splatter down on top of his hood.  ‘
As soon as he reached the doorway where Dumbledore waited, the readings on the wand wildly began flickering, jumping up and down and changing from red to green to red, and Madam Pomfrey gasped.
Qye eyed her and glanced back at Harry.  After a moment, he shrugged and she nodded before turning again to Harry.  When Harry still didn’t look at her, she nodded again as she took out a notebook similar to Smethwyck’s and a quill, making a brief note while Qye stared at it mistrustfully.  “As I hear no objections, Healer Smethwyck will stay for medical support only.  He will not make any comments at any point in this evaluation without direct request from myself, Qye or Harry.”
," he called out, flicking his wand out and he saw Lest's eyes widen and narrow as he dodged the blast of red light.
:: he said wearily, glancing over to where the vampires had been standing, ::
Harry paused as soon as he read telepathy and telekinesis.
Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes with both hands.
“Threstrals,” Hermione said enviously as they walked from Hagrid’s hut to the Great Hall.  “Oh, I bet they’re fascinating creatures.  So little is known about them, given the circumstances.  You’re so lucky, Harry.”
:: Qye muttered.  ::
“There’s still paperwork and other stuff to figure out,” Sirius mumbled into his shoulder while Remus held on, Albus seeing the way the younger man fought back tears as he made his way to his chair.  “It’s going to take a while since Kingsley’s trying to keep it quiet until all - ”
Lest had stopped in the middle of telling Black exactly where he could shove that stick he was trying to take from Dumbledore, hardly breathing as his mind shut down and abruptly restarted again as a million thoughts and hopes and fears flashed through it all at once.
,’ he reassured himself. ‘
“Well, come on, I can’t let you lot out on your own after dark,” Myn said cheerfully, clapping her hands softly together and smiling. “I’ll lead you guys up there.”
::  Qye made an affirmative sound and he had to suppress a cough.  ::
In the distance, somewhere far way, maybe the classroom, he heard people screaming and crying out.  He thought he recognized one of the screams as his own.
do it all the time since it is rather draining to be focused on your immediate and distant environment at the same time. However, if you find yourself fighting a vampire, I suggest taking the assumption that they have the ability. Launch your physical attacks quickly so that even if they see them coming, they don't have time to react." She paused. "And I suppose that brings me to him knowing about the spell before she uttered it."
Jonas thought, not a small bit hopefully as he adjusted one of the muscle stimulating charms.  ‘
In the fireplace, the embers struggled against the growing coldness.  But just before they were swallowed up, they gave one last, large burst of heat and a new flame was born to replace it.
“Stay together now!” the Herbology teacher shouted over the rising panic as she brandished her wand, frowning at the beast now entangled in growing vines.  “Come now, stay together!”
“I can’t believe all of you are being so biased,” she sniffed, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.  “That’s all a load of hogwash that Muggles come up who don’t know a single thing about magic and you’re all gobbling up their tales like candy.  And besides, what do you really know about vampires anyway?  And I mean facts, Seamus,” she added when she saw the Irish boy open his mouth.  “Not that fiction you read.  I mean things you find in textbooks and the like.”
Granger gave him a relieved smile and Weasley gave him a sympathetic look. He ignored both, seeing Myn smile at him, to which he smiled back at.
Unfortunately, his reading of Qye's Journal had been cut short.  The beginning of December had brought with it an onslaught of work.  So instead of spending his late nights in bed reading about this mysterious 'Qye', he spent it in the common room with his friends, studying and working.  It slightly frustrated him and he couldn't wait for vacation to begin so he could have some time to read more about the mystifying 'Qye.'
“You like that one, right?” smirked the vampire.  “Think he’s such a good boy, such a green thumb?”  Her eyes gleamed.  “Let’s see how deep that green goes.”
“Hmm?”
Another flick of her hand and Sprout grunted as she was forced from Neville, who struggled against an invisible force.
:: Qye said quietly, his voice coming back stronger but sounding a bit ill.  ::
"You already promised so you can just stand in the corner until I'm ready for you," Professor Opacre said airily, responding to whatever her younger brother had said. Harry stared alongside the others when Lest's eyebrow twitched and he backed away, folding his arms and leaning back on the wall, scowling at his sister. Qye just continued to snicker helplessly.
“Fine,” he bit out, stalking back to his armchair and dropping down, once more toying with something at his neck.  “Be quick about it so we can get this over with.”
A mirror to the left of the broken statue erupted into a million small fragments and he grimaced slightly.  Forcing the snarl from his face, he looked down coldly at the broken pieces of glass.  Sighing in irritation, he dropped into a nearby armchair.
-------
“You will not touch them!” snapped the Herbology professor, straightening up.
“This is giving me a lot to look forward,” Ginny commented as she looked them over.  Parvati and Lavender were sitting down next to her, both with their eyes glazed over as their hands hovered their forks over their drinks.
He opened the door to his room and stood in the doorway, looking around the place in which he lived for only a few years.  Walking in, he looked around.  Everything looked pretty much the same except for a few ruffled papers and books dropped on the floor.  Picking one up, he absently put it back on the shelf.  The attackers had been in this room.  But why?
“We understand how you must be feeling,” he heard the sister say carefully and Sirius closed his eyes again as he buried the palms of his hands into his eyes, digging them in as if to push away the image of too thin bodies that Smethwyck reassuringly said were far better than they had been days ago.  “It…it’s a lot to take in, not only what has happened with Harry but what he means to us as well.”
,’ he thought to himself and in the next moment he shook again, this time in wild fear, reaching out with his mind, reaching like before for another –
“Then - ”
“He’s a fucking vampire,” Sirius muttered into his glass, grimly looking into the fireplace as he slouched on the floor with his back to the couch.  “And he’s shown how damn capable he is with messing with people’s heads, how do we know who he’s messed with?”
-------
,’ she thought dimly and a bit bleakly.  ‘
At that moment, understanding flashed over him and he turned indignantly back to his classmates.
Saira stood up as soon as Krista sat down and said in a crisp voice, her blue-violet eyes flashing with disgust and annoyance at the girl next to her, “Saira Latvian.  Representative of the Latvian family of vampires from Europe, who are second-in-command to the Head family of the European vampires.  Wife of Sebastian Latvian - ” – Jordan saw a flash of pain in her violet eyes – “ – who was my partner as Head of the Latvian family.  Loyal to the Opacre family of vampires and on the side of the Opacres.”  She sat down quickly and Leon stood up from next to Jordan.
Then they grew darker, a darker shade of blue.  A darker blue that mocked in a friendly manner.  A darker blue that held amusement in them, amusement that annoyed him…in a good way?  Harry didn’t understand.  He just knew that these darker blue eyes captured him, held him…so familiar…so warm…
Rage unlike anything he had ever known roared up in him from an unknown source, overwhelming his serene composition and making his face twist unfamiliarly in fury.  Anger made his body quiver, made his usually bright green eyes darken, flashing dangerously.
,’ he thought firmly to himself as he surreptitiously began to relocate his bacon and sausage. Ron was gulping down at lightning speed so he doubted the redhead or brunette would notice any more food added to the Weasley boy’s plate.
"You should've just let me hit him," Lest muttered while he held an ice pouch to his cheek, leaning against the room's door post as Marylin finished cleaning up. She left the broken desks off to the side for Filch to pick up when he was doing his rounds. Her light blue eyes shot a quick glare over at her brother as she made the final adjustments to her trinkets.
“Either way, mate,” Weasley continued, drawing back Qye’s attention, “You’d better go back and calm her a bit. With all the time you spend there, I don’t think you want her mad at you for the rest of our time here.”
The exams that had seemed so distant were now here and all those hours studying didn’t seem quite enough.
Breakfast passed in relative normalcy if you could call Seamus winking at Harry every five minutes normal.  The poor Gryffindor boy had to refrain from beating his head against the table out of frustration because neither Seamus nor Dean were explaining what they were talking about.  Of course, the desire to knock himself unconscious also could have been because Qye had flipped through his memories and found a particular tune that annoyed Harry to no end.
Opening his eyes, he turned his head slightly –
The amusement faded from the gray eyes, replaced with the coolness that they had adopted since the beginning of the school year.  Malfoy dropped his wrist and Harry repressed a shiver from the sudden cold.  He barely stopped himself from reaching out and grabbing hold of the warm hand once again, firmly reminding himself who the owner of the source of heat was.
, he saw the green eyes looking absent.
There was silence for a long while and then he heard a ragged sob.  It was choked back but came softly again.
He heard the woman mumble something under her breath and his ears perked up as he caught a word of Swedish.  Often times, he heard her speaking to herself but could never place the language but that was clearly Swedish.
“Isn’t that dangerous?” Ron said doubtfully as Harry silently read the description and list of ingredients.
"Just ignore him," Hermione said, still blushing but looking slightly downcast.  Harry guessed Ron's last comment must have struck something in her but she managed to push away her sadness.  He absently made a note to have a talk with Ron about Hermione soon.  The two were driving him mad with their little dance.
Harry’s breath caught.
"I like you guys," she said, gently, and even those with looks of mistrust on their face seemed convinced by the honesty of the statement.
sighed Qye as Harry grimaced at a drawing of a vampire’s digestive system.
He shrugged.  “That’s all he said.  Mind you, the git’s got bad blood with him obviously but the way he said it…”  He shrugged again.
Harry thought grimly back as he shifted along the tree, eyes glancing around to see where to go.
He sat there and wished he could do something, had done something more, and wondering if all this had anything to do with the mysterious Qye next to Harry he had seen on the Marauder’s Map before all the students had been evacuated from Hogwarts.
Ron glanced sharply at Malfoy and the irritation faded away when he saw look in the gray eyes. He'd seen that look before.
A tension he didn’t know he carried slid from his shoulders as he sagged in his chair, shakily putting his cup on the table and raising that same hand to rub his eyes.  “I was in a rush.  And to be fair, I sent that letter on the first day.  I didn’t know them well enough then.”
“Secrets of the universe,” Qye muttered.
It was pleasant and quiet.  It made it all more jarring when Harry finally couldn’t hold it in any longer and abruptly asked, “What is this exactly?”
The beast that bit him choked again as more blood poured out, more than it had taken from its bite.
His eyes snapped back down as Lest softly pleaded, “Harry - ”
’ he thought, mesmerized, as he looked down at
Harry sighed and opened his eyes, still rubbing his temples.  ::
Qye glanced behind them to see Granger looking at him with a horrified look, Weasley goggling at him and Myn staring wide-eyed at him.
“And you let him?” Malfoy questioned.
“Oh no, it’s completely unnatural,” she assured him, patting him on the back.  “I’ll still be running those countercurses when we get back and grilling him every chance I get, don’t worry.  But,” she said brightly, straightening up, “might as well enjoy this peaceful night, right?  Who knows when we’ll get it again.”
“Was that your attempt at a subtle insult?” the Opacre male said coolly, not even turning around to look at him, leaving Qye slightly disappointed. But determination rose in him as his impulses made him speak once more.
Qye stayed quiet but anxious as Harry read.
Qye blinked as he abruptly felt cut off, all alone in his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
Not only would he have to deal with Malfoy in Potions for the entire year, now he had to deal with the arrogant git for the first quarter as well.
Draco flinched.
:: Harry snorted, picking up his robes, a shirt and pair of hand-me-down jeans.
Ron sat still, staring at the rain, thinking of Hermione’s worry, his mother’s anxious baking, the heavy silences.
Qye said as he retreated back into reading another memory.
The cupboard beneath the stairs had been cleaned.  Harry ducked in, noticing that everything was gone from the place he had been raised.  Sitting down against the wall with his knees pulled up to his chest, he wrapped his arms around them and closed his eyes.
…and he froze.
It was the day after Halloween and Harry was back for the last time at the place he never called home.  Walking up the stairs, he dully recalled the past week.
:: asked Qye in a disbelieving tone of voice as Harry looked at the two bicker, seeming to momentarily forget about Harry.
“No,” Wainscott answered calmly, putting her notebook down on her lap.  Even upside down, Qye could read ‘
Hermione’s brown eyes searched him as he floundered, slowly softening as the silence went on longer.
The other boy sighed.  ::
The class scrambled for the ingredients, looking up at the instructions on the board constantly.  As Harry chopped up his spider legs, he wondered about the potion.
“No, but I remember seeing something in one of my review guides for past N.E.W.T.s,” Hermione said thoughtfully.
“What?” Harry said, looking up, startled, as Qye blinked, clearly thrown off.  Remus started to smile slightly, a glimpse of bitter reminiscence in his eyes.
The Harry Potter that came to Hogwarts, befriended a man who others pulled back from because of his appearance, made the choice to be a Gryffindor, cherished the friendships of Ron and Hermione and the people in his House, took up his courage and went on a date with…
He whirled around and collapsed onto his knees just in time to empty the contents of his stomach in the nearest stall.
Harry’s face heated and he glared heavily at the white-haired boy.  “We weren’t - ” he stopped, realizing that train of thought would only cause him more aggravation.  Taking a deep breath, he continued in a steadier tone of voice, “Considering how un-cozy you two were with each other, what makes you think I’ll believe anything you say about him?”
“I think we should just be grateful they’ve finally gotten some sense,” Hermione interrupted.  “And Harry has the right to look however he wants.  You look very nice tonight, by the way,” she added to a Harry who flushed even more and fiddled with the bracelet he wore.
Qye said desperately.
Qye said wearily.
“Fuck the vampire, I don’t want that bastard hurting
He took a deep breath and exhaled, dropping his head.
“And if I hadn’t come back?” Draco said challenging, voice tight and angry.  “Would you have let that continue?”
“I would like a few minutes alone with Qye and Harry before I have them go back to Healer Smethwyck for their daily check in,” Wainscott said, kind yet firm.
There was a pause.  Then the voice muttered, ::
Harry coughed, held himself up by the tree and looked up as the vampire stared contemptuously at him.
“I’ll be going then,” she said calmly.  She shot Harry an apologetic glance, to which he shrugged, and then glided out of the room with her light yellow robes swirling around her.
"Hello," she smiled, finishing off attendance and standing up from her desk. "Sorry I was a little late, I had to get some extra materials for today's lesson and Professor Snape...well, since teachers are supposed to talk nice about one another, let's just he was super helpful." She smiled a smile which showed her fangs.
Smethwyck’s lips tightened and Qye tensed, waiting.
He jerked, shocked. Harry! Where was he? He snapped his eyes closed and instinctively turned inward, probing around his mind for something that might resemble…
’  He let out a long breath, reaching the bottom of the stairs.  From there he looked around the house.
Harry started as Qye’s voice came clear at him, voice flat and subdued.
“Are you asking me if I’m jealous of Harry?” he asked softly, his eyes flashing dangerously.
Ron and Hermione were once again bickering over something – Harry thought he heard the name ‘Viktor’ in the argument but he wasn’t quite sure – and Harry had to break them up as he pointed out the nervous looking first years who didn’t know where to go.
“Almost?” he asked, blinking, unsure of whether to be hopeful or suspicious.
:: Harry replied, surprised.  ::
In the midst of Hermione freezing in shock, Lest waved a hand. Her wand shot out of her hand and landed neatly in his palm before she could finish squeaking in surprise.
There was something but it wasn’t the same and Qye’s breathing quickened, a little faster and panicky as he opened his eyes again, blinking rapidly to focus.
Harry took a deep breath.
“Qye has difficulties with trust and managing his anger,” Libby noted to the room as she watched the group absorb the information, each of them looking at the report with different expressions.  She took a moment to appreciate the Headmaster thoughtfully and methodically moving through each section, stroking his beard, wishing the rest had his quietude.  “His outbursts of anger have been reflected with the erratic use of telekinesis.  Let us also not forget that even with Harry’s exhaustion, Healer Smethwyck and Madam Pomfrey have documented the increase of strength and development of his magic over the week, as I’m sure you have all felt.  If we begin to suggest placing them in a restricted environment such as the ward – if we could even manage the logistics – even temporarily, I believe assisting them on managing their issues will be more difficult and likely less successful.”
Moving behind her desk, Professor Opacre gestured to the small clear bag containing the multicolored vials. "I've taken the liberty of procuring some simple healing potions from Professor Snape - so you
“You are a terrible influence,” he informed the blond as he snagged his butterbeer.  “Absolutely horrible and if you do anything else, talk or no talk, we’ll see how you’ll like bouncing again, Ferret.”
Ever since the Dursleys' attack, his rival had become. . .well, he couldn't say polite or nice since this
An acorn fell from the tree and smacked him in the forehead.
He continued to wander, speaking absently with the uneasy teenagers, subtly making his way to
Harry paused in his stirring for a moment, startled by Qye’s sudden comment. He frowned inwardly and said as he resumed stirring, ::
:: Qye finally said after Harry spent a moment blinking at the door.  Harry blinked one last time before sighing.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes, slumping back in his chair.  The fire blazed in the Gryffindor common room and for a few minutes, he just sat in his chair, listening the crackling and popping sounds.  It was a little past midnight and he was the last person in the common room, Ron and Hermione leaving just half an hour ago.  They had both argued for him to go bed but he simply didn’t feel tired.  In the end, they had both grudgingly gone to bed after he promised to go to sleep the minute he finished his essay.  Of course, he never said
He chewed on his thoughts for a moment and quietly asked, “Do you remember what’s happened?”
,’ he thought, looking down at his plate.  ‘
Qye sighed.  ::
Lest didn’t manage to turn in time and Qye heard him grunt as they crashed into the bedpost, Qye’s eyes fixed on Lest’s throat and trembling because he
in his voice but mostly just expectant victory.
Lest watched the beast died, a vicious primal instinct in him sated as he shredded the remnants of its mind before the body expired from the blood protection.  And then he felt the cold pit in his stomach as he turned back to his enemy.
“They just want what’s normal,” Harry said, staring out the window as Qye flung a ball Smethwyck had given him for his exercises.  Harry didn’t remember throwing it at the wall as part of the Healer’s instructions but fortunately enough, it was just bouncy enough to withstand the abuse.  “It’s what they know.  It’s safe.”
His eyes followed the retreating back of his friend, silently urging the vampire to look back once at him, one look and see him, anything, but Lest never turned back, coolly walking towards his place. His heart clenched painfully and he lowered his eyes to the ground.
The phoenix sang softly and he nodded, pulling out his tin of sherbet lemons.
He looked back at the twins.
“Well?” he asked wearily as the vampire woman straightened up, twirling her pencil and looking at him contemplatively.  Merlin, he hoped that didn’t mean another outfit change.
Harry jolted, having forgotten about the other boy for a brief moment, and looked away with a blush on his cheeks.
He didn’t see the smile that blossomed onto Qye’s face.
Then the screams began, bone curdling.
“Maybe the duels helped them grow up a little, Harry,” she had snapped when he finally asked one too many times as she tried to study.  “Maybe they see that tearing each other apart is pointless and actually damaging when there are bigger and more dangerous things out there.  Now could you please go do something actually productive, like going through the study schedule I set up for you?”
“No, please,” Harry choked out.  He stilled before suddenly going limp in their grasp, the Sneakoscope falling from his hand and landing with a solid thud on the floor.  Dean hovered uncertainly a few feet from his bed as the others looked warily at the suddenly still black-haired teenager.
His fingers clawed into the bookshelf as he recalled the beatings, the black eyes, the blood-drenched old clothes.  “Yes, well.  He’s not missing out on anything.”
Harry thought to Qye, innocently shifting his eyes away from his friends and trying to think up an excuse to give them a moment alone.
’ he thought fuzzily in the darkness. Voices distant and familiar floated in the scorching obscurity.
“I’m glad we’re friends,” he said quietly.  His eyes flickered lost for a moment and he swallowed.  “Whatever happens just…keep doing that.”
Qye hastily scrambled off Lest while the vampire jerked away, his pale face flushed and a trace of embarrassment in his eyes. The dark-haired boy unsteadily stood up, dusting himself off, his eyes refusing to meet anyone’s as he mentally scolded himself.
- and Lest caught it with hand, not even looking behind him.
:: he asked confusedly as he carefully placed the chocolates and cards into his bag lying by the bed.
"Could be worse," he said quietly.
-----
“Um…Mr…Mr. Opacre,” Hermione said awkwardly and Marylin choked when she saw Lest twitch. She coughed frantically when her younger brother shot her an irritated look.
Harry lifted his head from his plate, blinking at the irritated redhead.  "What was that?" he asked, pausing in lifting a spoonful of corn to his mouth.
Black eyes looked up to meet wide ones.
Qye’s eyes widened before he could stop himself.  Harry turned away from him and back to the Mind-Healer with a hard look in his eyes.
He hesitated, looking at it, looking at Harry.  He could feel strength slowly coming into his body but uncertainty about what lay beyond the room made him think about collapsing back into bed, think about sitting next to Harry and waiting for him to wake up to talk about what to do next because Harry had been right, they hadn’t talked about what to do after, what to do if this worked out.
:: Qye asked worriedly.
Sirius broke first.
“He’s my Carus.”
“Voldemort?” Harry said quietly as he buttoned up his shirt.  Ron shivered.  “No, Ron, I haven’t had any of those dreams for a while now.”  The redhead saw Harry shiver a bit.
“True.”  Draco hesitated for a moment and then nodded at him and started walking back to the main street.  Harry watched him until he disappeared from view and then sighed deeply and dropped his head to rest against a wooden post.
“You shouldn’t have gone through all this,” Hermione threw out fiercely and Harry turned startled eyes towards the suddenly glaring girl, her eyes still oddly bright. “If you had just listened to me and come to the Infirmary before you got that fever you wouldn’t have had such a high fever.” Harry dropped his eyes.
Lest’s eyes narrowed in consideration and he took a step towards Harry.
The curtains of the other fifth-year Gryffindor's beds flew open – minus a snoring Ron’s – and Dean, Seamus, and Neville stared at the groaning Boy-Who-Lived, who was wincing as he rubbed his head.
Qye said hoarsely.
“Merlin knows what she’d do to you if she saw what I looked like now,” Harry replied dryly, smoothing his rumpled clothing.  He couldn’t help but grin briefly at Draco’s grimace.
Qye bit back a grin. “Apology accepted, sir.”
He stared unseeingly at the wall.
“They’re on the grounds,” Lest interrupted, stretching out as much as he could.  He tried to stifle his frustration that he could not see the entire castle but he knew where the trouble waited.
She smiled at him and he felt his hopes rise.  “It’s almost perfect,” she said, reaching up a hand and patting his head.  “I know the zipper looks a little strange but it really does look good on you and - ”
The doors of the train slid open and out bounded a large black dog, his nails clacking against the stone floor of the station.
he thought vaguely to himself as he picked up a few potatoes.
“Lest!” Dumbledore said sharply and Remus breathed in deeply, forcing himself to lower his wand, concentrating on the rumble of power in the Headmaster’s voice and the smell of it in the air.  “I would advise you to think on these actions.  Think of how they will affect Harry if nothing else.”
He just looked at his reflection for a few moments, taking in what he saw.  Clothes that hung limply on him covered his pale skin, slightly golden from the hours of working in his relative’s backyard.  His cousin’s hand-me-down’s just emphasized how thin and small he was, easily the smallest boy in his class.  He studied himself a bit longer, noting how his messy black hair was a bit longer than usual, curling at his neck and an inch from his shoulders.  His green eyes were dull and hidden behind his banged-up glasses and he saw how they looked a little lost.  His scar was barely visible under his fringe and he absently ran a hand through his hair, making it messier than usual.  He noted how his face seemed a bit more hollow, gaunter than it was last year.
Draco’s brain was whirring, this was a
“The Wigtown Wanderers, the Montrose Magpies, the Ballycastle Bats, and the Holyhead Harpies,” she listed off, her eyes sparkling brightly.
“Well, yeah, but she’s a great player, she wouldn’t be on the Reserves for the Harpies for long, especially since Gia Harding has been talking about retiring because she wants to start a family.”
Potter snorted and raised his eyebrows.
Potter gave him a wide, toothy grin.
—he had been tortured by his father.
“Or maybe I’m just bad at this,” growled Harry.
When Potter just blinked at him, Draco realized this was a perfect example of one of the many aspects of the magical world that those raised by Muggles didn’t necessarily know about.
When he was younger, Draco had hungrily devoured all he could possibly read about wands—and everything else, for that matter—but there was no information available on the craft itself. For good reason, too, it certainly wouldn’t be safe if just anyone could fashion a wand whenever they wanted. The craft of wandmaking was usually handed down generationally, so the secrets remained within the wandmaking families. The Ollivanders were, of course, the most famous wandmaking family in Britain, but Draco knew of other international ones as well.
“Why?” Potter asked. “Why is it dangerous?”
“Er…” Harry hesitated. Grading papers was easily his least favourite part of the job. Penelope rolled her eyes at him.
He began surveying the Slytherin table in what he believed to be a futile effort to find someone to sit with for breakfast. His eyes landed upon Theo, who was looking down at his plate rather morosely. The two hadn’t spoken much since the very embarrassing snakeweed incident on Theo’s birthday, but he was still Draco’s friend and he felt bad about just up and ignoring him simply because of an awkward moment.
“Poppies are used in a variety of potions,” Draco continued, when it was clear Potter wasn’t going to say anything. “Opium poppies are even used in Muggle medicine,” at this, Potter’s head snapped up, as though shocked Draco could possibly know anything about Muggles. Draco chose to ignore this, partly because merely a short time ago, his surprise would have been completely founded.
The weekend was quiet for Draco, no bored owls from Potter inviting him for dinner with the rest of his Gryffindor gang or else complaining about the blokes from the M.L.E.S. trip-jinxing his locker or some other nonsense he was prone to writing.
He had been in for a rude awakening later on.
“What do you mean?”
Hermione Granger worked on the fifth level of the Ministry, in the International Magical Office of Law. She was apparently very important, as she had both a receptionist and a secretary outside of her office. Potter seemed to have some sort of all-clear, as they immediately let him in as soon as they saw him.
“Deal.”
“Yes, Harry,” Granger said, somewhat shortly. She was frowning, and Draco started to worry. What if there was no way to fix this?
“I’m not certain anymore,” Draco was saying, smoothing Armstrong’s thick and growing mane back. “Although I suppose I’m rarely certain of anything these days.”
“Thank you, Draco,” she had said, softly, and reached out to put her palm against Draco’s cheek. Draco had just stared at her, disbelievingly, the same way everyone else had seemed to be staring at
anymore!”
“Ron Weasley,” Ron responded, with far less enthusiasm in his voice than was in Waya’s.
Draco sighed. He liked to think he was mysterious and hard to read, but Violet seemed to always be able to tell when something was bothering him.
He was in soft grey summer robes, linen or something similarly light, and his hair was short, but fell slightly into his eyes as he walked in and he flicked his head slightly to shake it back.
Draco, who would be doing all of the scheduling for the judges overseeing the trials of Macnair and Rowle, and filing all of the court paperwork, received no such pay raise.
Violet let out a sort of strangled groan and let her head fall onto Draco’s shoulder.
“Yeah,” he exhaled softly. “Oh.”
“And you had an extensive knowledge of Defence Against the Dark Arts, as I understand it?”
“I have to get back to work, Potter,” Draco finally said, placing his fork delicately on his empty plate.
“Or half-bloods,” shrugged Violet.
“It will be up to the two of you to conduct yourselves professionally, of course,” Ashworth was saying, “however I think the additional challenge would be good for you. Teaching isn’t easy, and you’re never going to have a classroom consisting of only well-behaving, respectful pupils.”
“They don’t much like being tampered with,” Luna continued, and Draco braced himself, ready for Luna to tell him it wasn’t possible, that he was stuck with this monstrous mark seared into his skin for the rest of his life.
“Of course, I-“ Draco was interrupted by a tea kettle, “That’s the tea, which means everything is all set. Come, have a seat.” The four walked into the dining room. Draco saw his mother’s head swivel from himself to Potter constantly through breakfast, while still giving Teddy his fair share of attention.
Feeling a spark of light, Draco responded, “Tell him I’ll have a dozen packed up in just a moment.” This felt like the thing Draco needed to feel happy in his life again. Maybe he just needed to try more new recipes. Floating like a balloon out to the front, Draco went to set the box of muffins on the counter and looked up to the man who was eager to buy so many of his baked goods. Locking grey eyes with green, Draco dropped the box of muffins into the counter and gasped.
It was Harry who answered. “Thank you for the invitation, and Happy Christmas, but if you don’t mind, I think we’ll eat up here.”
“When do we need to leave?”
“Well, we mix all the ingredients together, then we cook it. Do you want to see a cook trick?” Draco asked and Teddy’s head bounced up and down in answer.
They placed their order, then Harry posed a question that he had asked over two years ago, in a different restaurant, but this time with more hope, “So, what now?”
The pair walked out of the house, and down the stairs.  “This way,” Harry guided and headed towards the left.  They walked for a few blocks and then placed his hand on Draco’s lower back and steered him towards the entrance of a small restaurant.  Draco felt a shock of pleasure at the familiar touch.
Now though, he was sprawled on the floor of the pub with several pairs of eyes on him after Draco had shoved him away hard and fast, and Harry slipped onto the floor and was now looking up at Draco fastening his cloak over his sharp and fashionable muggle business suit.
“Well, yes?” Harry said questioningly.
“I was so sure you would hate me,” Draco finally said out loud.
“No. As in you’re not going.”
“Might be the last if you keep grinning like a goon.”
Somehow, though, their split never made it into the papers, and after a while, Harry asked Ginny if she would let it stay that way for bit, while he figured out what he wanted.  Ginny didn’t mind.  When she started dating Luna, Harry thought that the papers would run with that story ending the façade, but they never picked up on it, and neither Luna nor Ginny cared.  In the end, their trickery helped Harry.  He was able to figure out what he wanted, go to his mind healer, and even date a few guys.
His mother asked a question that made Draco’s stomach turn, “Will Harry be there?”
“…Harry Potter…”
“I don’t know. I just know I want to be your friend.” Harry was looking at the table.
“Well...” Harry stalled, “Ginny and I broke up a few days ago. I thought I would give her some space over the holiday.”
“Are you telling me you’ve never cleaned the shop with magic?” Potter asked as he opened the driver’s side door, ready to get in.
“I don’t think we can be just friends.”
“Absolutely not.” Draco replied stoically.
“Very well.” She turned and nodded. A few house elves appeared from the hall pushing carts of food. Among them was Kreacher who was holding a lumpy object wrapped in newspaper. When the food was loaded onto what was normally a study table, Kreacher walked towards Harry. “Master Harry, this is for you. I found it in some of the stuff Dobby left behind.”
When the meeting was over, the higher ups left the conference room.  Draco sat stiffly at the table, stacking his files, Ron was quick to leave the room, he patted Harry’s shoulder, “Good luck mate,” he said with a chuckle, happy that he was not needed for this particular conversation.
“Luna’s excited.  She found out before she even left for work this morning that they were printing another round of the edition,” Harry seemed happy to report.  “I’m glad to help her out when I can, but the attention is just… a lot.  You should’ve seen the atrium this morning, it’s like I walked in naked, the reaction I got.  Everyone stared.”
As the ceremony ended and the night rolled into a lively party, Harry and Draco were dancing in the middle of the floor with the rest of their friends.  Harry was happy that Pansy was here, it was Draco’s first official full scale Burrow night and he could definitely use the moral support of his best friend.  Pansy was one of the traveling journalists that frequently wrote for Luna, and after making amends for her actions in the war, including a certain declaration to give Harry over to Voldemort, gave Harry a thorough interrogation about his motives for Draco’s heart.
When he first started listening, he assumed that Harry had announced his engagement and wedding plans to Ginny Weasley, and he began a bitter diatribe silently in his head, but when he heard that one word, “gay,” he stopped.  He literally stopped in the middle of the sidewalk, an older couple murmured complaints against him as they narrowly avoided walking into him.  Draco collected himself, walked to the nearest newsstand, saw the Quibbler, purchased one without daring to read it in public for fear his face might reveal more than he wanted to be known, turned around and promptly found an apparition point and apparated home.  Once he was in his kitchen he looked at Ginny’s face first.  Then, he read the headline “Harry Potter, my Best Man.  Not My Groom.”
“And what do you think is so funny?” Harry asked, not sure he wanted to know the answer. Aunt Narcissa said you weren’t boyfriends. That means she was wrong and she owes me a galleon.”
“I think I’m gay.” Harry said this as if he was saying he thought he wanted honey in his tea instead of sugar this morning.
He made his way to his floo to travel directly to the Minstry office.
“He doesn’t deserve to have you there. End of story.”
After ten minutes of waiting, Draco opened the door to find only a pair of black dress robes, Harry having apparated out of the apartment.
“Will do,” Ron said with a smirk.  Draco rolled his eyes at the two.  Thick as thieves the two of them, they always would be.
“Or you could stay? My mother makes enough to feed half of London,” Draco pointed to the dining room table overflowing with food.
“There’s a bloke out here who loves the muffins and wants to know if he can buy a dozen!” Jeremiah was gesturing wildly with his hands as he spoke.
But the world wasn’t as welcoming to him as he had wished for. Not because he was gay, but because he was a former Death Eater. The few times he had tried to put himself out there, he was scored with glares most of the time, but sometimes with harsh words, and even the occasional violence.
Draco remembered his father’s hate for Harry, and decided he did not deserve to have the most aggressively good person he knew at his funeral.
“Thank you,” Draco’s voice came out hoarse.
“Do you want to do this here?” Potter glanced at the door.
Two hours later, the pile was gone, and so were the approximately 45 chocolate frogs that Harry received. The pair had spent the morning laughing at the different presents. Handmade cards professing from women who Harry had never met, made funnier by the truth they had both shared. Harry had three piles. One for him to keep, one to throw away and one full of things Harry had noticed Draco liked and insisted he take.
“Accidentally,” Potter smiled a wide smile. “I saw you through the window last week, but didn’t have the wand with me. I’ve been in a few times since then. You have a great place here by the way, and those muffins are great, Teddy is going to love them.”
“…the wedding is this summer…”
“Oi.” A voice startled Draco from his thoughts. “Happy Christmas.”
“That’s Ginny’s mom. She wants me to know everyone understands and they all still love me. She invited me for Easter.” Harry sniffled.
Harry chuckled, then put his arm around Draco.
“What are you doing here?” Draco was finally able to form words.
It was Christmas morning. Draco stared at the tree. There was a pile of presents so large he was baffled. He could only identify one, a large silver wrapped box, his mother’s trademark, as one belonging to him. He dared not to go closer. It was his understanding that he was the only student, much less Eighth year left on campus. This year, families were holding their children closer than ever. They were beyond grateful they still had children to hold on to.
Ginny’s headline read, “Harry Potter, my Best Man. Not my Groom an essay by Ginny Weasley.” When you flipped the paper over and upside down, Harry’s headline read, “Out and Proud an essay by Harry Potter.” Ginny had spent almost an hour trying to convince Harry to come up with something wittier, but Harry wanted something that could not be misunderstood.  Ginny owled Luna at the office to send a staff photographer to meet them at a park near the house.
“Good afternoon! How’s things?” Draco asked cheerfully. Both Lydia and Peter gave him a funny look. Draco had been in a foul mood for so long, his employees were taken aback at his greeting.
“Sure,” Potter chuckled, “Be back at the usual time and we can head over there?”
“Now, you’re just being mean.” Harry whined, but Ginny kept poking him until he sat up.  Finally, he was upright and started telling the story, “I finally worked up the nerve to try and… I don’t know make my move,” Harry cringed at the expression, “or something, and he flipped.  He shoved me away from him, onto the floor of the pub, and then said, ‘Call your girlfriend.’ Ginny, he thinks we’re still together.”
“Alright,” Harry said, “Let’s see how you clean up.” He said jokingly, and Ginny laughed and twirled.  He knew she was nervous, but also knew she had no reason to be.
“Set the alarm for nine.”
His friendship with Harry began about nine months ago, and pretty soon, Draco knew it wasn’t just a friendship for him.  He knew he had feelings for the bespectacled git, but he also knew Harry was still with Ginny, so Draco decided that finally being friends with Harry would be enough for him.  Until two weeks ago when Harry tried to kiss him, and Draco’s world was tipped sideways.
“…did anyone know…”
Draco nodded, took his mother’s present from the pile and sat on the sofa.
Harry’s answering smile was dazzling. Draco thought that a smile like that should be illegal, but he knew no one in the wizarding world would agree upon locking up their hero. Draco shook his head to rid his mind of its wayward thoughts.
“Draco, are you asking me out?”
“Would you like to... maybe... see each other again?” Harry’s face was flushed, giving away his motive.
“Well you’re certainly right about that.  I don’t love wearing a tie, but I don’t look as good as you in them.”
“It was hard. Dealing with everything. So I literally put everything in a box and refused to deal,” Potter sighed. “I was seeing a therapist, a muggle one, so I had to use a lot of metaphors, but we worked out that once a week I would take an item out and deal with it. That’s when I found your wand two years ago. I started sending owls. Then I asked the ministry to look into if you were living in a wizarding part of town, when none of that worked, I thought about going over to your mother’s on a Sunday when Teddy was there, but that seemed wrong.”
“Oh,” she laughed, “I only need one.  It’s Draco that’s bothering you.  It’s always Draco.” She then turned herself on the sofa, so she was facing Harry, crossing her legs and said, “Now spill.”
“Well? Does it work for you?” Potter leaned forward, looking at the wand.
“Of course, dear. That means we will have to push the story on acromantula mating habits though…” Luna trailed off.  Everyone was used to Luna’s scattered attention span.  “I do hope the new story is more exciting than that, but I don’t know how it could be.”
“Harry Potter, you have terrible manners.”
She looked into the garden.  It was shining with lights that were charmed to float in the air, lightly swaying in the breeze.
“Why wouldn’t you?” Draco admitted.
“Oh,” Draco smirked. “Scared, Potter?”
“I’m mad at you!” A fierce eight year old declared.
Draco woke up shivering. Sitting up in bed, he reached for his wand. He hadn’t woken up cold in almost a year and a half. For the past eighteen months he has had his own personal space heater who kept him warm. Even when Harry wasn’t in the bed, his warmth lingered. Draco was never in bed alone long. Harry only left to go to the bathroom, or to make them both tea, before getting back in bed with a warm up of black tea, perfectly made with two sugars and a splash of milk. Draco cast a warming charm around him.
“Completely.”
Harry nodded, “I now a place. It’s muggle, I can probably get us there without any reporters following us.”
“…I’m just so shocked…”
“Happy Christmas, Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy.” She regained her composure. “It seems you are the only two students here and most of the staff are with their families as well. Would you like to join us for Christmas supper or would you like food brought to your common room?”
Moments earlier, after three Firewhiskey shots, Harry had started to lean into Draco.  He suddenly found himself lost in the storm grey eyes of his childhood foe.
He then spent some time trying to think back to the last nine months of conversations and remember every time Harry mentioned Ginny.  All he could think recall were mentions of quidditch matches, birthday celebrations, and time spent at the Weasley family home, The Burrow, but nothing else came to mind.  He looked at the photos.  Ginny and Luna looked like the perfect couple.  From what he knew of Ginny, she would be a good match with Luna.
“No, not end of story. We don’t do that. That’s not how our relationship works.”
“Hello Harry,” Luna said airily, “You seem off, nargles bothering you again?”
Harry kissed Draco’s shoulder and breathed out, “I love you, Draco.” Draco and Harry both knew that, in that moment, Draco knew he could let go of the fear he had been holding on to for the longest time.  He was not unlovable.  He was not too much, and he was enough, and Harry was the one who would hold him through any moment of doubt.
Draco turned to see Harry Potter standing in the entryway of the common room. Draco tried to respond, but only opened his mouth and closed it again.
