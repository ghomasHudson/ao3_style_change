Casper was obscenely tall, having several inches on Draco. His hair was pitch black, with light grey eyes that were rimmed with blue. He had a kind look to his face, one that made everyone feel welcome in his presence. His hand was outstretched, daring Draco to greet it. He reached his hand forward, shaking his hand firmly. It became clear where he knew him from, he had seen him at Noah’s wedding, waiting for Harry after their talk. He had seemed more sulky then, although he didn’t dare get a good look at him then, in fear of seeming too interested in Harry’s life. Draco turned around, reaching for a coffee mug, uninterested in making small talk with the two aurors in the kitchen. Harry signaled to Casper, and they both started heading towards the door, shutting the door behind them, Draco was met with the deafening noise of silence.
“So which one was it? Did you fuck someone else or not?” Draco asked, wishing he hadn’t as soon as it escaped his lips. He was afraid he already knew the answer. As Harry nodded his head solemnly, Draco snatched his hand back from where Harry had been holding it, his heart racing.
“Yeah, yeah I’m fine mate, just tired is all” He was already walking away and basically running to the restaurant exit, hearing Noah continue to call his name behind him but he’d be damned if he let that fucker know that this news had affected him in any way. He pushed through the doors and apparated back to his apartment.
He rose slowly from the bed, careful to avoid sitting upright for too long. He slipped on underwear and pants and walked out into the hall. He picked up his shirt off of the floor that he had thrown off in a horny rush last night. As he walked past the washroom he heard the shower turn off, Draco knocked lightly and the door opened. Harry stepped out with a towel barely hanging onto his waist, his upper body trickling with water.
“I don’t mean to alarm you but we felt it was necessary to inform you of the occurrence.” Draco’s heart rate began to speed up ever so slightly, his throat clenching in anticipation as it always did whenever someone seemed to be about to talk about something important.
Harry was laughing at something the other man said, throwing his head back and having an effortless appearance to him. He had grown a beard and had filled up generously, his shirt fitting his arms nicely. Draco felt like he had seen a ghost, he had been staring for far too long and as he expected, Harry met his gaze soon enough. Harry’s smile had dropped almost instantly as he saw the realization come to him. Draco was not about to this right now, not tonight. He turned around quickly, walking back towards the man he left in the corridor.
Aaron nodded and they began eating their lunch silently, only the sounds of forks clunking on plates, and other restaurant ambiance.
“Last I checked, the only groceries you have at your house is a bottle of year old ketchup in the fridge - if you think you can miraculously feed us both a meal with that said ketchup, be my guest.”
Draco considered what Harry was implying, but he had been so distant to him ever since that it was difficult to believe.
It had gotten late in the evening by the time Draco had unpacked but he still felt no urge to fall asleep. He walked over into the washroom, careful to be quiet as most of the lights were off and he assumed Harry was asleep. After getting ready for bed, he laid awake for seemingly hours. Annoyed by his insomnia rising up again, at a time when it was most inconvenient. When Draco was younger, his mom would make him chamomile tea with honey to help him fall asleep, he was sure it was just a placebo at this point as it brought back comforting memories of his youth. He wrestled with the idea of going into the kitchen and brewing himself a cup of tea, he figured Harry had been asleep for long enough to not be awakened by a kettle. He rose from the bed, wearing his silk pyjamas that he had bought himself as a Christmas present, realizing how pretentious they must have looked. He tip-toed into the kitchen, startled by the light already being on. Harry was sitting at the kitchen table, looking over what seemed to be work files, dressed in plaid red pyjama bottoms with a Gryffindor crest on the pocket, and with no shirt on. Draco tried desperately not to stare.
Walking down the street, he could feel the presence of someone following him, he knew it was Matt. Guys like him could never take no for an answer, turning to force to get what they wanted. Harry was grateful that he had magic to protect himself, pitying anyone in his present situation that was burdened with being a muggle.
“Surely there's no reason that this has to take place outside, is there? I’ll bloody freeze to death before we even end the night.” Harry laughed at his dramatics, wrapping an arm around him for warmth - it didn’t do much but Draco loved when they were touching in any form so he complied.
Marie nodded along, placing a tender hand on his arm in condolence. He felt he was grieving the loss of something he never had.
“I don’t think he’s nearly as cold as you think he is, darling” she spoke softly, taking a sip of her coffee before continuing. This was definitely not the response that he had sensed coming from her, he was ready for a string of curses and disappointed remarks.
He had made plans with Aaron to go suit shopping later today as it was the weekend and although he had a plethora of suits to choose from, none felt fit to wear to the wedding of your ex fuck buddy. Draco threw on a pair of shorts and a casual shirt, knowing that the summer heat was blistering and nothing else would suffice.
The fall used to be a time of joy for Harry, the falling of the leaves meant returning to Hogwarts once again, the only closest feeling to home he had ever gotten. And although Christmas was bittersweet, he still enjoyed the comfort of the Burrow around that time, its welcoming environment providing a blanket of protection from the cold. But as he graduated the return to Hogwarts had faded in time and as he grew older, his presence at the Burrow was still welcome, but sometimes felt out of place, all of the Weasley’s coupled up with their respective partners and left Harry feeling like a tag along orphan.
“Hello Potter” Draco said as he peeked over his shoulder, his voice hoarse and face pale and drained. Harry wasn’t sure how to respond, it was obvious something was wrong. Maybe he somehow found out about his parents.
He wasn’t sure if he was more shocked at the invitation or at the soft look in Harry. He had seen it often this past week and it always left him feeling strange. Pity from Harry didn’t feel comfortable, but it showed that he cared, which also felt new.
Cadmus nodded at the instruction and apparated from the house. Romilda paced around the living room, analyzing the belongings. Her slow step made its way in our direction, cornering us into a wall. Her face was almost directly aligned with mine, her breath warm on my face. My body stood perfectly still, almost willing my heart to stop in fear of it being heard. Casper’s eyes were shut tight, his attempt to block out the situation. She moved an inch closer, almost grazing the cloak.
Harry stomped through the halls of the Ministry. How could Marvin even suggest that Harry keep this from Draco? And threaten his job? Harry wasn’t sure if it was entitlement, but he was sure that the last person to lose their job in the auror department would be him. He apparated home, shoving his keys through the lock, and slamming the door behind him as he entered. He attempted to calm himself down using deep breaths, but the effect was miniscule. He walked down the hall, messaging his temple. He peered into Draco’s room, the door was slightly ajar, the room was dark and the sheets were messy, clothes on the floor but Draco nowhere to be seen. If Harry had to deal with kicking out one of Draco’s one night stands right now he might actually lose it. He prepared his voice for more yelling while walking into the kitchen. But the only thing his eyes were greeted by was Draco hunched over a glass of scotch, a half empty bottle no further than an arm's length away. He was wearing a dark grey sweatsuit and his hair was dirty and unkept. He had never seen Draco so undone.
“How are things going with Malfoy? Quite the scene you boys caused today in the hall.” Casper said, looking to Harry for a response.
“Do you happen to have chamomile?” he asked, startling Harry who looked at him with wide eyes as his body tensed up in defence. His muscles relaxed as he processed it was just Draco.
The portkey was a rundown and old looking beer mug, its intricate designs being one you can find at nearly any tourist shop in London. It whipped Draco back to England, his body snatched and twisted as he landed on the hard concrete of a side alley. His body ached and he had a headache forming behind his eyes. He had realized now that he arrived in England, he had nowhere to go. His apartment seemed distant and cold, he was afraid of the memories that might strike him as soon as he entered through the door.
Ron cuddled up underneath the arms of his wife, wrapping his arms around her torso and kissing her stomach.
“That Harry Potter really is a hoot! I can see what all the hype is about” Marie exclaimed to Draco, her cheeks slightly pink from the alcohol. Draco nodded in agreement, unsure what his response was supposed to be.
“Hermione made me hire an interior designer, this place used to look like a bum lived in it quite honestly, I prefer it much more now, although I don’t really use the kitchen so all the new appliances were a waste of money.” Harry said, scratching the back of his head, looking awkward and strangely out of place in his own home. Draco didn’t know how he could not use a kitchen like that, if it were his, he would be cooking constantly.
“We should go to bed.” Harry said, taking a step back. He was already half hard and he amazed himself at the self control he was able to have. Draco turned back towards the balcony, continuing to look over. Harry made his way back into the apartment, opening up the screen door to step in.
Draco knew it was time to get back to the ministry as they most likely had made a decision on his housing by now, he was just hoping it wouldn’t be anywhere too aggressively Weasley like. He changed back into his suit, which Aaron had washed while he was asleep. He still didn’t know if he was able to get the clothes from his apartment, he hoped he wouldn’t have to wear exclusively this suit for the next few weeks. He walked back out of the room, and handed the clothes that he was lent back to Aaron. Giving him a tight hug and a kiss on the cheek, unsure what he would do without his help.
Draco’s stomach turned, the alcohol now threatening to make its way back up. Draco sat up straight and backed away from Harry.
They finished cleaning and went back into their respective rooms. Draco shutting the door behind him and leaning against it. He thought of what would happen if he ever did kiss Harry. How he would respond and if they would have sex. Although the idea warmed him, he knew that they were able to coexist only because they hadn’t crossed that line, he feared that if he did, nothing good would come out of it.
“Say hi to your new fucking roomie.” Potter spat in Malfoy’s face, shoving past him and storming off down the hall.
Harry had stopped what he was doing and was standing extremely still, his back facing Draco. He wished that he could see his expression right now to try and glimpse at where his mind was at.
“I’ve been good. I wanted to thank you for letting me come, I know I was a bit of a prick in school and I wanted to say I was sorry.” Draco said, feeling uncomfortable. Ron chuckled harshly and Hermione hit him across the arm, giving him a warning glance.
“What's your deal? Are you ok?” Draco asked, still giggling slightly, the alcohol had made it much easier for him to laugh, especially around friends.
“Somebody passed out for a while” Aaron joked as he added some white wine to his pan. Draco thanked him for the bed and sat at the kitchen table, asking him what he was making. It was now around 6 in the evening, and he was starting to feel his hunger.
On the ride home Draco had come to find out the man’s name was Nick. Being able to see him outside of a setting with flashing strobe lights and sweaty bodies, he was able to take in his appearance more thoroughly. Nick had dark tan skin, with gold undertones that radiated even in the dim lighting at the back of the taxi, his hair shaved closely to his head. They weren’t doing much talking, stealing hungry kisses and waiting impatiently for the car to arrive at Nick’s apartment building. Draco’s mind wandered back to Harry a few times, forcing himself to concentrate on the moment whenever it did.
“That’s not much considering you’ve been drunk nearly every time I’ve seen you the last couple months.” Harry lit his second cigarette, watching intently as Draco sucked in the smoke.
“Well. Everyone was really supportive when I came out - for the most part. Ron had a little trouble making sense of it all I suppose, but Hermione talked some sense into him as usual. The rest of the Weasley’s were fine with it, not too many questions asked. Ginny particularly was really supportive, considering I broke up with her a couple of months prior, but it was for the best looking back at it. I didn’t do much besides auror stuff, partied a lot, tried to forget the guilt I felt from the war - everyone dying and all. I haven’t really dated until - well I don’t know if we’re dating per say - but I haven’t even been on a date in years. Mostly just casual hookups. And no. I haven’t gone back to Hogwarts. I would love to eventually, it just has been too much for me, the constant reminders of the sacrifices others have made for me stirs up a lot of unwanted emotions. There you go. Anything else?
“How about shots instead?” Draco insisted, trying desperately to drunken himself up so he wouldn’t have to remember tonight. The man agreed and waved his hand to the bartender. Draco looked around the bar and admired the simplicity of it. He had chosen a muggle bar specifically for the anonymity, he wasn’t exactly famous but many people in the wizarding world knew of the Malfoy name, and the last thing he needed was a call from his father asking him why he was published in the The Daily Prophet doing some rather unspeakable things to another man.
“I became an auror. It’s not bad, pretty much what was expected of me, even though I sort of hate it.” Potter replied.
“Merlin, I thought they would hate me.” Draco sighed in relief, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Glad that the interaction didn’t get out of hand like he predicted. Harry laughed and rubbed his hair, his hand lingering a little longer at the nape of his neck.
“Go fuck yourself.” Draco exclaimed cooly, his eyes hurt but eyebrows furrowed in anger. Walking away towards the entrance of the club, leaving Harry out in the cold.
“Well. You see Draco dear, I was going to bring you a bottle to congratulate you on your move or something like that, but I drank it unfortunately. I did however stop by the liquor store and grab you one more, which I may or may not have started without you.” Harry replied, feeling his eyes heavy with the alcohol. He swung up the second bottle, hoping Draco would invite him in.
“Well, let's fix that then” Harry reached over towards Draco’s phone, Draco stared at him like he was crazy. Harry just chuckled and got him to unlock the phone, opening up the contacts app and putting his number in.
“I don’t think you understand Marvin. If this was one of your little Ministry buggers, you would have been on your way to the Renovation as we spoke. Don’t pretend that you have to choose the right fucking moment just because the hostages happen to be Malfoy's.” Draco was over listening to his bullshit. He had risen from his chair halfway through the argument and was now storming out of the door, slamming it loudly as he exited, the sound echoing through the hall.
Harry placed his hands along Draco’s back, his hands sliding his sweater up and touching his bare back. His stomach turned at this simple connection, his mouth opening to deepen the kiss further and his fingers pulling lightly at Harry’s hair. He moaned into this kiss, grinding his hips against Harry’s and arching his back from the contact, his mind both racing and empty at the same time.
“You have no idea how anal my mother is! I swear to Merlin that woman is absolutely abysmal during the holidays” Casper complained, signalling to the bartender for another round.
Harry turned his head to look up at his face, missing this proximity between them. He gazed into his cool grey eyes, which were dilated with his pupils, he glanced at the soft pink of his lips. He nodded.
Harry walked behind Draco as he was doing his hair in front of the mirror, some sort of mask underneath his eyes to seemingly get rid of the puffiness. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, watching as Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath in the mirror. Just as Harry got a glimpse of what their relationship was before that dreaded phone call, Draco pulled him off of him and left the bathroom.
“You underestimate my connections Cadmus, the Ministry had already placed that nasty traitor underneath their protection earlier in the day. Along with Draco Malfoy.”
Gentle winds glided through the air as the brisk coolness of autumn was full fledged. Draco had been sitting in the same spot for hours, his body glued down by the wildered shock of affection from Aaron. The absurdity of the situation was enough to drive his mind to race at a fast speed, flashing over any moment that he may have missed these feelings of desire from his friend.
Months have passed on this exact balcony. Months of heartache and joy, and probably hundreds of smokes.
“That being said, I think he’ll come around, with the way he looks at you, it must be hard to deny his feelings. But are you sure that that’s what you want?”
They weren’t going to be alone for the whole time either, Ron and Hermione were to make their way over for New Year’s eve, yet he was still questioning what it meant for him to invite Draco for a cross country vacation, but not be able to admit that he was his boyfriend. It was all very confusing.
Draco rolled his eyes without even looking over. The bartender slid over the glass to Draco slowly, unsure as to whether it was ethical giving a man this drunk more alcohol. Draco snatched it from his hand, gulped it all down in one go. He turned to Potter, raised his middle finger in his face, then placed the glass back on the bar before turning around to head back to his table.
“Why don’t you do me a favour and leave me the fuck alone?” He concluded, baring his eyes into Harry’s one last time. Harry stood there with his mouth slightly agape, unable to speak. At this, Draco turned on the heel of his shoe and continued walking to the portkey, tears now streaming down his face.
“Whatever you say, Potter.” Draco replied, before being quickly swept into a nearby empty alleyway by Harry’s arms.
Harry groaned in rebuttal, his shoulders slumping down like a childs. Draco giggled at his immature behaviour.
Draco regretted his decision to come to the party almost immediately, especially once he saw the faces of his fellow Hogwarts graduates scattered around the room.
“Suit yourself.” Draco slurred, taking another swig of his drink. Harry brought his own glass up to his lips, thinking about the last time they had talked with Draco this drunk. It was at Noah and Aurora’s wedding and he remembered Draco leaning in a little too close, if Harry was any drunker he probably would have made his own advances on him. He didn’t have too many people he knew at the wedding besides Casper and he had had a rough day at work the night before. Thinking about it now, Harry wasn’t in too different of a situation right now.
Draco should have known that they would have been there, they had been the initial agents to be given this case, it would only make sense for them to come to the meeting. Draco simply rolled his eyes and walked into the office. He had gotten more crude and harsh with Harry again, he could have dealt with the rejection, but the blatant avoidance had gotten under his skin. If Harry wanted for them to go back to being strangers, then that's exactly what Draco was going to do.
“One second!” Draco yelled out, washing off his body for the second time. He turned the water off, reaching for his towel and wrapping it around his waist, his hair dripping slowly down his back. Unsure if Harry had heard him, particularly towards the end when it was becoming increasingly more difficult to keep himself quiet. Turning the door knob, he was Harry waiting patiently outside the door, he looked up from his phone, his eyebrows darting up slightly. Harry’s eyes flashed quickly across Draco’s body, enough for him to notice. He stepped to the side, making way for him to walk through the door, continuing on into his room without another word.
His mind had caused quite a distraction for him at work, he was being sloppy with his potions, unable to focus on anything besides that stupid brown curled prick. His boss luckily gave him some leeway, Draco blaming it on the capture of his parents and other seemingly trivial things. Not that he didn’t care about his parents, but it was simply draining to vent over them any further, especially after last week and especially when he knew nothing that he did would make a difference.
They were seated in a quaint part of the bistro, a nook near large sun facing windows at the front of the cafe, further away from the noise and bustle of people enjoying their lunch. They had eventually come to the topic of him and Harry, as he had predicted, and after giving her the rundown of their sloppy drunken hookup, he was now waiting impatiently for any sort of advice that she could provide.
“I think you’re saying things you might regret tomorrow.”  Fuck you. Harry wanted to say. I’m trying to tell you how I feel and you’re shutting it down. Fuck. You.
The sky lit a blue haze over the city, the yellow ambiance of the street lights filling up the alleyways. He could see sparse lights on in apartment buildings, making him ponder how every person in each of those rooms lived their own lives, had their own troubles to face. He walked past a 24 hour convenience store, where he used to buy cheap liquor and get drunk with Oliver. He would tell him about his relationship with Marie and how he was sure that she was who he wanted to marry. Draco didn’t know how to empathize, he’d never met anyone he was sure he wanted to spend more than a few years with, let alone his entire life. He has had to be so painfully independent, not only through adulthood, but even as a child, that the picture of living co-dependently on someone else seemed overbearing. He walked into the store, the fluorescent lighting making his eyes squint, and a trace of a headache begin to form. He roamed through the rows, taking his time, it’s not like he had anywhere else to be. He picked out a small bottle of rum, as he felt his inebriation begin to fade off. The cashier eyed him curiously, Draco walked up to the cash register and placed down the bottle, putting money down on the counter.
“Take a break for a second, I can promise you I’ll provide you with something far more entertaining.” he teased, slowly taking the book from Draco’s grasp and placing it on the coffee table adjacent to them. Draco whined in rebuttal but made no efforts to stop Harry.
They were nearing the end of the street and they were laughing at some joke that Aaron had made, before Aaron abruptly stopped.
They waited in line for around 15 minutes, the alcohol they had taken at home already taking its effect. It’s been a while since Draco has been clubbing, so the hot air that hit his skin as he walked into the building felt familiar. The music pounding into his ears as he walked past groups of sweaty, intoxicated, bodies. He turned to make sure that Aaron was still behind him, grabbing his hand and leading him further into the dance floor. Draco’s body swayed to the music, the strobe lights illuminating his face periodically, the alcohol adding to the heat of his own skin. He remembered the days from his early twenties when he would take molly with his friends before going, their minds fuzzy and pupils dilated, urging them to be closer to each other. Although his days of MDMA filled nights were over, the experience still felt oddly comforting and freeing. After a while of dancing, they walked towards the bar, needing water and more shots before returning back to the floor. He leaned his body over the bar counter, giving his feet a break from holding up his body. Aaron ordered a round of shots for them, placing a hand on Draco’s back. The bartender slid their shots across the counter, Draco lifting his head and tilting it back as he slipped the alcohol down his throat. Suddenly remembering the warmth of Harry’s arm pressed against his from the night before. He ordered another round of shots, hoping to drink his mind into forgetting.
Initially, he looked at the building in disinterest, seeing it as an annoying part of his job, having to go and investigate the apartment of someone who had made his life at Hogwarts more difficult than it needed to be. Now, he was looking at the burgundy coloured building with awe, unable to fathom that the complex housed a man that he could not get out of his mind.
“I agree. So are you seeing anyone now?” Harry said, Draco raised an eyebrow at this. “Oh, no, not like that - I’m not trying to hit on you or anything just… curious” He stuttered.
Perhaps it was the atmosphere of the home or their exhaustion from their day long travel to get there, but they both hit the pillow in the bedroom and didn’t wake until the next morning.
“Oh shut up, I was not starstruck. It was just weird to see him after so long, I was caught off guard, besides after all of the news about him in The Daily Prophet saying he had come out and broken it off with that Weasley girl, it was still a surprise to see him at a gay muggle bar” Draco explained, picturing the image of Harry laughing effortlessly at the bar in his head.
Harry cautiously picked up the gift, “You were really making fun of my wrapping when yours is a dark green envelope?” he laughed.
Part of him wanted to give into Aaron’s pleas in order to maintain a sense of normalcy in his life, he was so desperate to cling onto the known that he was willing to put aside his own instinctual feelings.
Draco kept his jacket on, stopping by the kitchen for a glass of water to relieve his scratchy throat before heading to the store. He heard a knock on the door. There was no one that he knew that would come badgering on his door at 3 in the morning, so he was hesitant to respond, staying silent to hope that whoever it was would think he was sleeping.
By the time it was evening, and they were all getting ready to go out to a small club in the town, the silence in Harry and Draco’s room was thick and pressing, both of them feeling the tension in their chest.
Draco had been taken care of by Aaron more times than he could count, but to be met with the puffy and run down appearance of his best friend had caught him off guard. He wouldn’t say that Aaron is closed off by any means, but he was generally not very emotional. So when he was standing at his front door step, his hands pressed firmly into the pockets of his coat and shoulders hunched over like he was trying to do everything he could to make himself small, Draco didn’t know what to do.
The rest of the night was spent tossing and turning, only getting collectively an hour of sleep through the night. He had already been half awake by the time he heard the birds chirping outside, reminding him of his restless sleep. He heard clamouring outside of his door, two voices chatting amongst themselves. Draco walked out of his room, desperate for a coffee for some sort of energy boost before leaving for work. He still had over an hour before he had to leave but it’s not like he was going to get anymore sleep at this rate. He walked into the kitchen, pursing his lips into an awkward smile at Harry and his company, averting his gaze as he reached for the coffee pot.
Draco brought their faces closer together, his mouth was slightly open, simply out of the lack of effort to keep it closed. Harry put a hand on Draco’s cheek, his eyes darting across various parts of his face. Draco’s heart rate was rising as they got closer, he could almost feel Harry’s breath on his face.
They walked out of the store in unison, both sweaty and dreading to walk back out into the heat. Considering they were in a relatively crowded muggle street, they couldn’t apparate just anywhere, they made their way into an alley, excited to get home.
“Ok. My turn” Draco said, suddenly filled with nervous excitement for Harry to open his gift. He grabbed the envelope and placed it in front of Harry’s lap.
“Um… sure. How have things been with the potions project you’ve been working on?” Draco questioned, confused by the sudden hostility.
Marvin pulled Harry to the side of the office, talking to him in a hushed tone, still with a sense of urgency. Draco could only make out of a few words, none that put together a cohesive sentence or gave him any idea as to what was going on. Particularly strange that they were keeping secrets when Draco was the one that needed their help in the first place. They turned around, Harry’s face compliant.
Harry pushed the man off of his body, zipping up his pants and throwing himself off of the wall. He pushed his way through the crowd, his shoulders getting pushed by a collection of bodies every few steps. In his peripheral he saw Hermione, dancing with Ron, he tried asking them where Draco was but nothing came out, maybe the music was so loud that no one could hear him.
At this point, Aaron took Draco’s face in his hands, he gazed into his eyes as if searching for an answer. He leaned forward and connected their lips in a kiss.
“Hello Draco! Happy Christmas to you.” Hermione said, a grin on her face. He only received a slight nod from Ron.
He couldn’t believe that this was what Ron and Hermione thought of his rivalry with Malfoy, who else from Hogwarts thought this? Harry grimaced at the thought. Him and Draco? The thought itself was insane. He could admit that Draco was a technically attractive man and wasn’t far off his type, but his personality spoke for itself, squashing any smidge of attraction that may have been there.
“Did you want to talk about last night?” He could feel his voice a little rough from nerves and hoped that Harry didn’t notice, he would hate to sound like he wasn’t as careless about this as he was.
Infatuation was perhaps too light of a word. No, what Harry felt for Draco was all consuming, intoxicated by his smell and his mannerisms, desperate to want to make Draco known and mundane within his routine, to have him to wake up to in the morning, even if they had to spend their days apart.
Harry left an hour later, claiming he had some Ministry stuff to complete. Draco took this opportunity to call Aaron and invite him over, though they hadn’t been as close recently, he still wanted to update him on the big stuff.
They were deep in their makeout when loud knocking filled the air at the house, a few voices giggling outside. Harry groaned as their lips disconnected, Draco already feeling how he was half hard, pressing against his ass.
When Draco opened the door, Aaron looked awful. He had dark undereye circles and his face was pale and grey.
He finally pushed his way out of the club, the cold and harsh winter air slapping his face as he stepped out. It was here, in the harsh reality of silence that he had realized what he had done.
Harry eyed Draco for a moment, taking a pause to look down his suit. If Draco didn’t know better, he would have thought that Potter was checking him out.
“You’ll call me if you two break up, right?” Harry joked, resulting in a giggle rising from Draco’s chest.
He rested him down on the couch, taking the bottle from his hand and placing it on the coffee table.
Marvin’s exhausted face met his glance when he walked in, his under eyes dark with a lack of sleep, and his face grey and colourless. Draco was even more secure in his decision to drop the auror program whenever he saw them look so beat up and restless. He closed the door quietly behind him, greeting Marvin with a handshake and taking a seat on the padded velvet chair in front of the desk.
Harry’s hips pushed against Draco’s, making Draco groan into the kiss, feeling his own dick grow at the touch.
Draco and Ron started hitting it off the more they drank, both of them woozy and warm with the flow of alcohol in their veins, buddy hugging and singing along to the quiet songs on the radio.
Draco made his way downstairs to prepare a quick breakfast as Harry stepped into the en suite of the home, stretching his arms above his head to extend his spine from hours in bed. He found himself in awe of the life he was living, with Draco at his side.
“Draco I understand you’re upset, but you have to trust that we know what we are doing. All I ask is you stay with Harry for a month or so” His voice sounded so condescending. As if Draco was a child and didn’t know right from left. He was a bloody wizard for fucks sake, he was pretty sure he could take care of himself. He most of all didn’t need Potter at his guard for so long.
“From what I’ve seen in only the past few days I don’t doubt that she’s a wonder when angered, I prefer not to test it out for myself though so I agree.” Draco responds, beginning to untwine his legs from Harry’s.
“I think you’re saying things you might regret tomorrow.” was all that Draco could muster, it felt wrong listening to Harry’s confessions when he was this inebriated.
“Well. You see Draco dear, I was going to bring you a bottle to congratulate you on your move or something like that, but I drank it unfortunately. I did however stop by the liquor store and grab you one more, which I may or may not have started without you.” Harry slurred, swaying from side to side as his eyelids fluttered.
And that’s what brought him to be sitting on the porch, his eyes brimming with tears and his head still woozy with alcohol, waiting for Draco to come home as the clock struck twelve.
“You’re not gonna let me dance alone are you? That’s not being a very good friend.” Harry teased, grabbing him by both wrists and attempting to pull him up off of the couch. Draco groaned in response but complied, allowing Harry to lead him to the makeshift dance floor by his wrist.
“Come on now lad, now that’s not the saviour of the wizarding world that I know and love” Casper jokes, nudging his elbow against Harry’s side.
“Harry, we have been over this before, I do not have another choice other than to leave him with you, I need you to stop being difficult so we can focus on the actual problem at hand here.” Harry huffed in frustration, his anger rumbling through his body.
“Marie? Can I stay at your place tonight?” He asked, his voice breaking for the first time that night, his chest feeling the full weight of what happened.
“Fuck. I don’t know, Casper.” Harry said, unable to fully commit to the idea of telling Draco how he felt.
“I can’t say that I don’t love this view,” Draco began, “But it is a little compromising when I’m trying to focus on reading.”
They had gone back to Draco’s apartment, deciding to have this conversation there instead of a random alleyway. They sat down on the couch, the brown leather crinkling beneath them, a stiff silence in the air. Harry’s eyes were no longer red with impending tears, they were now cold and glazed over. If Draco had to pinpoint the emotion, he would probably say it was jealousy.
Draco apparated out of the ministry using a portal, and to Aarons street. He did this instead of going straight to his place so he could grab an apology coffee and bagel, but mainly because his head was pounding and he severely needed a coffee himself. He walked into a coffee shop and ordered the items to go, knowing how horrid he must look dressed in last night's clothes with tousled hair and a pungent scent extruding his body. He simply got his food and coffee and walked out, not bothering for niceties after the dirty looks he received from the barista.
“As you know, Aaron and I have been friends for years - and up until recently it had been entirely platonic, I didn’t even know he fancied lads.” Harry proceeded to not say anything.
After Draco finished his cigarette, he walked around the back of the venue, debating whether to go home or wander the streets of London for a while. He used to take mindless walks through the city when he was in his earlier twenties, riddled with insomnia and desperate to feel connected to something other than his own life. Those were more difficult times in his life, back when he was still in auror training and burdened by the mistakes he felt he made in his school years. He was never one to victimize himself, but coming to terms with the fact that what he had to do was out of his control was one of the more challenging realizations he’s had to overcome.
He sat down at his kitchen island and started nitpicking all of the mistakes he had made leading up to this night. Sleeping with him, enjoying it, continuing to do it several times when he knew that Noah didn’t feel the same way. Not to mention Aurora. How Noah could hide something like this from her, Draco couldn’t comprehend, unless it really was as meaningless to him as he had made it seem.
The elevator opened and they moved towards the door of the apartment, their lips only parting in order to open the door. Harry closed the door shut and pushed Draco up against it, grinding his hips against him. His mouth travelling down onto his neck, his teeth biting at the skin lightly, causing Draco’s head to throw back in pleasure.
“Afternoon Draco, thank you for showing up at such quick notice.” Marvin spoke, his voice raspy and quiet sounding. Draco nodded his head in response.
He took a seat next to Draco on the bed, the mattress dipping underneath his weight. The blonde’s eyes were red and swollen, his face looking sullen and hurt.
It was at this point that the couple saw Draco sitting on the couch, an anxious jitter building inside of him.
“We’ve missed you! Noah talks about you constantly!” That felt like Draco’s cue to leave. He wasn’t in the mood to lie to Aurora about how him and Noah used to shag, especially now that they were married. Curiosity crept into his mind, causing him to wonder about what Noah could have possibly been saying about him, but he brushed off the thought, said his goodbyes to Aurora before checking out and leaving the store.
So he pulled his phone out of his pocket, dialling a number he hadn’t reached for in a few months. With being preoccupied with Harry he had found himself neglecting all of the friendships that he once valued so deeply, isolating himself in a world where only his relationship mattered.
“Thank you Draco, that means a lot. Now, let's just all try and have a good time.” Hermione smiled, walking back into the kitchen to prepare some more drinks.
Draco marked his spot on the page with a bookmark and set it aside, taking a second to ponder the question.
Draco’s body had gone cold. His heart beating through his chest. That was the last thing he had expected to hear.
“I was trying to run away from a lad that got a little too handsy at the pub, and the first place I thought of when apparating was your place. Of course, I wasn’t planning on going in, but after a bottle of scotch and seeing you on your balcony, it was hard to resist the need.”
“Did you want to go out today? I mean we don’t have to if you weren’t interested like that but I just thought that - you know - we could just hang out and see where this goes? It’s really up to you though I understand if you’re not interested or-”
“I suppose this means I’m done being wrapped up with the Ministry?” Draco asked, eager to get out of this office, the air suffocating him slowly.
“I’m sorry, I just get scared sometimes.” he said. It was true, Harry did get scared of being vulnerable in any way, especially around someone like Draco. He leaned his head against Draco’s chest, wanting to feel his breath rise and fall. At this, Draco only stiffened, sending a pang to Harry’s heart.
“We shouldn’t.” Draco whispered, turning his face away from Harry, his eyes stinging with the threat of tears.
“Oh. No, thanks, I’m good. Just got back from dinner.” Harry said, turning back around and continuing on to his room. Although they held a conversation for a minute, it didn’t mean Harry was about to have dinner with the man.
His night had taken a foul turn when he was cursed out in the middle of the Ministry hallway, he couldn’t complain, most of the things that Draco had said were true, and he was painfully aware of them. The occurrence had sent Harry spiralling into a depressive state, making him feel incredibly guilty and unworthy of Draco.
He was greeted with a few dirty looks from the likes of Neville and Seamus, but he chose to ignore them. After all, he understood why they would be pissed at him.
“Ready to go?” Harry asked, turning his head to the side to hide what Draco thought was a blush. Draco simply nodded and grabbed Harry’s hand to apparate to Ron and Hermiones.
“You either cheated on me, or you didn’t Harry. There's no I think.” Harry nodded his head once again, his eyes were red and swollen, his hand wiping his tears with the back of his palm.
These worries faded away as he entered his apartment, pushing the heavy wooden door open. Marie and Oliver were already seated at the dining table, Aaron laughing among them.
He had received the call a few moments after he had gotten back to the office from his lunch with Aaron, an unspoken awkwardness lingering between them as they walked back. Draco was quite eager to get away from their empty conversation when the phone rang. It was Marvin, he sounded calm and collected, not even a hint of worry in his voice which made Draco feel secure. His boss had excused him from the rest of the work day, understanding the particular situation that he was in.
He glanced over his shoulder, seeing the familiar body frame from the bar now upright and following him from a few metres away, his jacket hood up and casting a shadow to hide his face. Harry crossed the street to make sure he was indeed being stalked, annoyed that he would have to apparate to avoid him. He had wanted to take a nice evening stroll, but the ravishing of muggle men had gotten in his way.
It was now nearly 2 in the morning, and as Harry and Hermione were quietly chatting over red wine in the living room, Ron and Draco were seeing which one of them could do the most wandless spells now that they were both significantly inebriated.
After that Draco felt defeated, however, he hadn’t been drinking as much as usual because of Harry’s distractions.
“Don’t worry I know.” Draco laughed, “Yeah, I am actually. You remember Aaron?” Harry’s jaw dropped open.
His arm reached up carelessly to the wood of his front door, his knuckles smacking against the slab. Met by silence he knocked again, he knew Draco was home and awake and he would be damned than not have his chance.
So when Draco was pressed into his mattress and had his wrists pinned over his head, he wasn’t exactly surprised to find himself there.
Marvin informed him that Harry should be back at the ministry within the next hour, and he should just “sit tight”. The last thing he wanted to do was be at the beck and call of Potter. Knowing him, he’d be late too.
Over the years, Draco had made sure that every apartment that he has lived in included an office of some sort, on the days that day drinking wasn’t socially acceptable or it was too early to go and pick up a man at a bar, he needed some other sort of distraction. For him, it had always been his work, and it was effective, except for on the days when his brain was cloudy and felt like it was filled to the brim with his own thoughts. Unfortunately for Draco, this just happened to be one of those days, he didn’t even have the energy to get dressed later in the day or make himself breakfast. He crawled back into bed, knowing that sleep wasn’t an option, but needing the comfort of a soft atmosphere. Whenever these emotional episodes hit, Draco was a mess of a person. They often lasted for days on end, but in this case, it wasn’t an option. He still had until 4pm though so he took full advantage of the staring at the ceiling slump he was in. Hoping that if he lay there long enough, his heart would release and he would feel a weight fall off his shoulders. This moment never came. It was nearly 7 hours later and Draco was still in bed, feeling emotionally drained and unprepared for whatever he had planned for tonight. He regretted accepting the invitation, thinking of any possible way he could excuse himself and stay in a slump for the rest of the day. Yet, he knew that this was something that was unavoidable, if he didn’t go to the wedding he would still have to face Noah and Aurora at some point, and it would be painful all the same.
Fuck. The last thing Draco needed was to have to live in some shitty little shack provided by the ministry, lord knows they wouldn’t provide their finest accommodations to an ex death eater. Still, he nodded curtly. It’s not like he had many other options. They left the room, leaving him alone after instructing him that he had a couple of hours before they would assign him housing. So basically, he just had to skirt off and find something to do until then. He got up from his seat, dusting off his suit from last night. He still hasn’t changed since the wedding since he had to come to the Ministry in the middle of the night. He rubbed his eyes, feeling them burn into the palms of his hands. He desperately needed sleep, and a shower. He still reeked of booze from last night. Pulling out his phone from his pocket, debating dialling Aaron’s number, but deciding against it. He would just show up to Aaron’s apartment as he knew if he called him now after ignoring him for nearly 48 hours, he would get an earful over the phone. And although it may be worse in person, at least he would have the space to leave if need be.
Harry focused back on the task at hand, his eyes wandering down the street for any sign of movement. The Ministry had given them instructions to avoid engaging if possible, they were to gather as much new information as they could without being seen. It was difficult, considering the state they left Draco’s apartment in, it was clear that they were going to be thorough in the wreckage. Casper spotted a flash inside the house, a silhouette of a body grazing the first floor. They had brought Harry’s invisibility cloak, running over to the side of the house towards a door that led into the laundry room. Harry cringed as Casper turned the knob, hearing every slight movement, the door squeaking slightly as they pushed it open. They stood in the same spot, holding their breath, anxiously waiting to see if they had been heard. The body in the house kept moving, showing no sign of being aware of their presence. Casper pushed the door the rest of the way and they slid into the house. They heard the man walking throughout the rest of the house, being quiet in anticipation. Another woman apparated into the living room, barely in Harry’s sight but enough to distinguish her appearance. She was dressed in dark black cloaks, Harry recognizing them from years ago. Her hair was silver and shoulder length, prominent cheekbones carving out her face, paired with angular eyes. Harry didn’t recognize her, and from Casper’s perplexed expression, he was guessing he didn’t either. Her hands decorated with silver rings, the cuff of her sleeve riding up to show the end of a snake tail.
“Alright, I suppose that is our cue to leave. He can only get so drunk before he starts becoming a liquified version of himself.” She stated, peeling him off of the couch and into the guest bedroom across the hall.
He leaned his head on the door frame, hearing Harry’s sobs from outside of the door. How did he find himself in this situation?
He heard the door open quietly, Harry shutting it softly like he was sneaking back into his childhood home. This irritated Draco more than he cared to admit, if what had happened was just another accidental occurrence between lads then why was the sneaking around necessary?
“I would love to go out with you. I just might need to stop by my apartment to pick up some proper clothing though?”
“Oh c’mon lad, it's been long enough. We know all about your little crush on Malfoy back at Hogwarts.” Harry’s face turned pink, what crush?
A wave of relief washed over Draco and he slumped further into his chair. He couldn’t handle being mad at Harry right now, he needed someone. Harry came and sat next to him, placing a tender arm on his back as Draco breathed heavily.
He did, however, walk over to the nearest liquor store and purchase two bottles of scotch, he had been forced into the social life of muggles for a sense of privacy for so long that he now carried muggle money with him more than he did knuts or sickles.
As he walked out of his room and headed towards the kitchen for an ice lolly before leaving to go meet Aaron, his front door swung open, making Draco feel as though his heart had jumped out of his chest. Aaron trotted in, a smile on his face.
Harry flopped back into the man's shoulder, they had only just begun and it was already being cut short. He heard the glorious laughter of Draco as he gave his head a rub, his heart fluttering from the affection.
They prepared to head home, Draco walking into another room to call a taxi while Harry and Hermione talked more.
“No offence sir, but I think Malfoy has a right to know if his family is in danger, I’m sorry but I can’t agree to keeping that from him, no matter the inconvenience it may cause the Ministry.” Harry seethed. He didn’t adore Malfoy but that didn’t mean he lacked all empathy. Marvin eyed Harry warningly.
Harry knew the feeling, Molly always got so stressed during the holiday season that it was often hardly enjoyable for her. It was hard to watch her run around with her head cut off with no one but Hermione offering a helping hand, sometimes forcing Ron to join. Although he would miss the bustling ambiance of the Burrow during Christmas time, he had a feeling he needed the time off to reflect on his own, preferring a more peaceful day in solitude instead.
As the door shut behind them and they made their way down to the taxi, the silence was comfortable in between them.
“Don’t worry darling, it’s nothing too big.” Harry ensured him, his own lips turning to a smirk as he took a sip from his mug.
Maybe it was the alcohol talking or the night of tireless dancing but Draco was far more flirtatious and bold with his actions than usual, pulling down the pants of the stranger standing in front of him as soon as the door to the apartment closed behind them. He began kissing down his chest, stopping to fixate on his nipples, sucking and biting at them gently, receiving a moan in return. He bit down at his hip, leaving slight tooth marks as he made his way further down to the now fully erect cock. Moans escaped Nick’s mouth as Draco felt the pressure of a hand at the back of his head. Biting down at his inner thighs and being teasingly slow with his movements only received more frustration from the other man, who at this point was all but shoving his cock into Draco’s mouth. Draco complied, stopping right before to look Nick into the eye, his hot breath igniting the nerves in the head of his dick.
The warm air from the ceiling vent was blowing onto Harry’s forehead, his body aching and groggy from his destructive state from the night before. The silk sheets were smooth against his skin, urging him to bury his face deeper into the bed and let sleep take him. A compelling proposition if it weren’t for his being in Draco’s apartment, not even a day after he had moved out. He groaned at his pathetic behaviour, showing up on his doorstep drunk and disorderly, in the middle of the night at that. He was lucky that Draco wasn’t one for sleep, or his grand romantic gesture (he hadn’t completely thought it through and now looking back it was more poignant than anything) would have been a failure.
Within 10 minutes the taxi was outside of the building and they were saying goodbye to Ron and Hermione. The four of them laughing at nothing, all drunk and ready to wind down for the night.
“Let’s just say it wasn’t fun watching your friend or fuck buddy - I don’t know - get married” Draco sighed, his eyes staring out at the skyline. Harry nodded, they were back to a comfortable silence. Harry tucked his hands under his arms for warmth as they leaned on the balcony railing, their arms still pressed together. The evening had actually made Harry feel better, he had almost forgotten about his work from earlier in the day, glad to have the distraction of someone to talk to when he got home. He had spent far too many nights getting drunk on his own to try and numb his pain before, this was far more effective. Draco threw the butt of the smoke into the ashtray. He turned his body towards Harry’s, leaning in so their torso’s were inches apart. Harry’s heart rate sped up. Draco was looking down at his hands, which rode up the side of Harry’s arm. Harry leaned his head back with a grunt, looking up at the sky, his throat feeling lodged. He knew hooking up with Malfoy right now would be a bad idea, for both of them, yet when he looked down at Draco, his mind seemed to fog. Draco took half a step forward, bringing their faces closer together, and looking down at Harry’s lips. Harry leaned forward, their noses touching. He turned his head slightly to the left, grazing past Draco’s face and leaning further forward to put out the rest of his cigarette.
“Fuck.” Draco murmured under his breath as he dropped his head, feelings of worry and guilt flooding his body, making it difficult for him to hear or even care about anything else Marvin was saying.
“Unfortunately, your mother and father have recently gotten captured by this group. We believe they are being held at the Renovation headquarters, as far as we know, they are alive.”
The walk was cold but not unbearable, it's hard for even the most mundane tasks to not be romanticized simply by his presence in Italy. He walked slow and leisurely, taking deep breaths of the fresh forest air, following a man-made path from what must have been years of continuous walks amongst the same ground.
In his peripheral, he caught a glimpse of a figure standing a few feet away. He broke his eye contact with Harry to see Aaron. Fuck. He thought. Out of all the possible times I could have seen him.
Maybe Draco had grown delusional and Harry was only putting up with him because he was required to for work, but at times he thought they were actually friends, the time they spent together was usually pleasant.
After Casper had left and Matt had bought him a drink, Harry was having a hard time feigning his interest, adding a mhmm every once in a while to make him seem engaged. He was cursing out Casper in his head, thinking about all the things he's gonna say once he sees him again at work.
The emptiness of Aaron’s office on Monday dawned over Draco heavily, he couldn’t help but feel guilt for his own part in his absence. He didn’t know whether to give him space or to go to his apartment and apologize. He saw the irony in his lack of feelings for Aaron while he resented Harry deeply for doing the same to him. At this thought, he decided against going to Aaron’s and instead chose to give him the space he assumed that he needed.
“I don’t know, I guess I just wanted to say I’m sorry. I know I’ve been weird about you and Harry lately and I don’t really have an excuse. I just want you to know that I’m sorry.” Aaron had been rambling for some time now. Draco hadn’t heard much of it, but accepted his apology anyway. It must have looked in-genuine because of his vacant look, but he was honestly still trying to understand what he was apologizing for in the first place.
Harry rose up from his chest and turned his face to meet Draco’s, he had been attempting to keep his distance, afraid that the propinquity would lead him to desire things that he shouldn’t. But with Harry this close, he was difficult to avoid.
“Jusss lying down, how come you’re always so grumpy? Where’s that ol’ Gryffindor spirit?” Draco slurred, his body rolling side to side along Harry’s spine as he spoke.
As he got to work, he waved his greetings to his colleagues and proceeded into his office, the events of last night still weighed heavily upon him and the last thing he wanted to do was make small talk about what everyone did this weekend or their plans for after work. He plopped down into his chair and leaned back, closing his eyes. He had always loved being at work, it gave him structure and felt like it gave him purpose. His work as an alchemist had felt like an obvious career path to follow, but had actually taken him several years to arrive at. Initially he started training as an auror, with the majority of his life forcing him to focus on battle and offence, it felt like the only path he could take. The job took its toll on him severely, causing nightmares of the war and a bad case of insomnia on most days, not to mention, nearly everyone who had been in the program with him had heard of his childhood endeavours and couldn’t trust him enough to work with him properly. He had met Oliver then, he was the only one who gave him a chance, and Draco was grateful for it. He had met Marie soon after and despite their rocky start as she had always been aggressively against the notion of blood purity, but after a few conversations explaining his childhood, they had grown to become friends as well. Then Draco made what he felt was one of the best and healthiest decisions for him in his life, he quit his job and began to pursue a career in alchemy. His friends were surprised to say the least, he had never confided in him about the troubles he had while being an auror, so for them it felt seemingly out of the blue.
The location was gorgeous, it was held at an old rustic barn, aged with vines and worn out wood. They had candles as ambient lighting and a general bohemian feel to the wedding. It was all very romantic and quite not the place to go alone. Draco felt awkward and out of place. Luckily, he spotted Marie and Oliver at a nearby table and went to greet them, glad he could have some sort of buffer at the event so he didn’t have to seem lonely for too long. He walked over to the couple with a wide grin, it had been a couple months since they got together at the restaurant and he missed their presence. Marie embraced Draco largely and gave him a tight squeeze, and Oliver followed, both of them eager to catch up with him.
It was Draco’s turn to sigh in relief, his heart still thumping from being called darling. He rarely hears Harry use terms of endearment so they are far more impactful when he does. He nods in agreement to Harry.
The slick fingers continued to pound into Draco, leaving him a mess, his nails digging into Harry’s arms. He felt the fingers slip out, and watched as Harry slipped on a condom onto his own dick, which was standing stiff. Draco marvelled at its size, already beginning to mentally prepare.
“I thought you said I didn’t know what I was doing.” Draco said, his pants growing tighter. He was desperate for Harry, no longer able to deny what they both have been avoiding.
“How in the hell did you get an autograph?” he asked with a gasp, running his fingers over the front of the book.
“Merlin, Potter. You had me scared shitless, hell are you doing pestering at my door at this hour?” He then caught a whiff of his scent, “And bloody plastered at that?” Draco said, his shoulders relaxing.
He was disappointed to find out that this year was more of the same. As he walked back, he could hear the distant hurra of a group of people shouting their excitement for the New Year, he had guessed that the clock had struck twelve.
“From time to time.” Harry said. It wasn’t entirely false, he had his fair share of mental health issues.
He ran up to the entrance of the building, his memory from the last time guiding him through the corridors and elevators to his front door. He felt the abundance of alcohol washing through him as he ran through the halls, his cheeks growing warmer and his pace growing sloppy. He wished he wasn’t drunk, he wished he had the courage to do this sober, to fight for what he wanted, needed.
Draco’s heart hadn’t dropped in months in the way it did when he found out that Harry knew about his parents. It wasn’t that he expected him to tell him outside of his bosses orders, although it was quite annoying especially when he hated the job. He just didn’t understand why he couldn’t have told him afterwards, when Draco had specifically asked him.
Draco leapt up from where he sat on the floor and wrapped Harry in his arms, inhaling his scent and squeezing tighter.
“So are you going to sleep with him then?” Aaron questioned. Now he was the one avoiding eye contact.
Once Casper had calmed down, they made their way back to the Ministry, they barely spoke, the air around them dense with emotion. They arrived at Marvin’s office, eager for the day to be over. Both of them felt so beaten up, despite not inciting any form of battle at all. Marvin could tell as soon as he laid eyes on the pair that the news was going to be nothing short of horrid. Harry explained how the event laid out in a quiet voice, he was rarely soft spoken and he could tell that it freaked Marvin out a bit.
“Because you’re not there.” Harry admitted, his cheeks getting hotter, he couldn’t tell if it was from the alcohol or his confession.
“I don’t know how many times I have to repeat myself.” Draco spoke, rolling his eyes slightly at the interrogation. He had gone to the ministry for their help thinking they would be more of use, rather than just being accusatory because of his past with death eaters.
Draco nodded, explaining how he was glad that he had decided to wander the streets like a drugged up bum instead of go home right away and continued on his story leading to this morning. He told him about the part with Harry being his auror and how they are placing him into housing. He chose to leave out the part about his conversation with Harry the night before, for some reason, it felt forbidden in a way, like he couldn’t let anyone know that he was capable of a civil conversation with Potter.
“You’re sorry? That doesn’t mean anything to me. It doesn’t change the fact that while I was trying to figure out how to fix this, you were literally fucking someone else.” Draco scoffed, “I don’t know what I expected. I don’t know how I ever thought that we could possibly make this work. I should have known that you would never be able to care about anyone other than yourself! For fucks sake, Harry, you couldn’t even say we were dating! You brought me to fucking Italy before you were able to admit you were my boyfriend.” It was all beginning to click into place for Draco, he had never been Harry’s, and Harry had never been his.
“I’ve been good! Have you seen Noah?” Draco tried to pass it off as nonchalant, he was at his wedding after all. Oliver nodded and pointed his hand over to the other corner of the venue, where the newlyweds were greeting their guests and showing off their wedding bands. The sight of Noah stung, he desperately wanted to leave. Instead, he waved over a waiter and ordered a double scotch. If he was going to have to be here he might as well take advantage of the open bar.
This still left Draco confused as to what they said about him being a target, and why he couldn’t simply go and live with Aaron for a while. He didn’t want to ask or reveal that he was eavesdropping outside of the door in the first place.
“Yeah, I suppose. We’ve always clicked as friends and we reconnected a few years ago. It makes sense, and he treats me well.” Draco said, not wanting to get into the details of his relationship. They had been together for nearly 3 years now, and although his love for Aaron wasn’t all consuming in a way that it had been with Harry, it was stable. He was happy and content, and he loved Aaron’s reliability.
As he was approaching the crust on his stale and cold pizza, the front door sprang open, Harry’s voice booming Draco’s name through the halls. Draco sighed and laid his head into his hands, hoping if he was quiet enough Harry would stop yelling.
The illusion of their mundane life had been broken when Draco had been called into the Ministry, within the hour his troubles became much bigger than whether or not he should have kissed Harry. In fact, they made those worries seem so minuscule it could have given Draco the confidence to do it, if he hadn’t been so heart wrenchingly distraught.
Harry decided to leave it at that, he figured it slightly inappropriate to ask Draco to move with him when he could hardly admit to him being his boyfriend. Still, it made Harry’s heart flutter at the possibility of it being just them two one day, perfectly serine in the countryside.
The dusk air in northern Italy was a sight to behold, the fog resting atop of the ground like a blanket. Draco was still asleep in the bedroom, a slight puddle of drool collecting beside his mouth that Harry chuckled at as he placed a kiss on his cheek before getting up. There wasn’t any snow on the ground but instead a crisp and cold breeze that swept across the county, and as Harry admired the view from the kitchen window, he was reminded of all the chilly snow-filled Christmases of his childhood. Not necessarily harnessing any fond memories since before he went to Hogwarts, but rather the ones he spent with the Weasley’s at the Burrow, enjoying the soft crackle of the fireplace as they gathered around the tree to exchange presents.
Harry dropped his keys on the shelf by the front door, the metal clattering and echoing through the hall. Maybe he thought he was home alone as a sigh of relief left his mouth when he saw all of the lights dim in the apartment. But the relaxed facade quickly faded when he walked into the living room to be greeted by Draco’s slumped over body on the couch.
Eventually, they both fell asleep on the couch. Draco wished he had kissed Harry that night. He wished he had kissed him on multiple occasions. Although he knew that even if Harry was standing right in front of him now, he still wouldn’t do anything. He was too afraid of what that would mean for them, their relationship was too fragile, a vase made of thin glass that Draco was trying desperately not to drop.
“I’ve barely opened my eyes and you’re already tugging me out of the most comfortable place on Earth. Do you know how cruel that is?” Harry said, throwing a disapproving glance towards Draco.
On the walk to the club, they were split off into the same groups. Ron was blabbing about some case that he was deeply invested in, parading around a bottle of scotch as his companion. All that was on Harry’s mind was Draco. More specifically, he was growing angrier at the situation at large, displacing whatever guilt he felt towards hurting someone important to him with growing enraged at Draco for getting mad in the first place. It was an outrageous thought, he knew, and he also knew that he had no right to tell Draco how to react, but he couldn’t help himself. He didn’t know if it was the alcohol pulsing through his veins or his fear of failure but he was growing increasingly impatient.
“Last night he couldn’t even get a cup of tea without it being excruciatingly awkward. I can’t handle another month of this.” Harry sighed, putting his head into his hands.
Maybe going to a party wouldn’t be so bad, at the very least he could get blackout drunk and pretend that his life was better than it was.
The feelings that Draco was trying so desperately to push away came flooding back as soon as he was alone. He felt broken and bruised in a way he had never felt before. He had been ignoring his parents for years, mailing back any letter his mom tried to send him, ignoring phone calls. How dare he feel any sort of pain for them when he had been the source of that pain for so many years? Draco felt guilt and hatred for his behaviours. He felt angry at the Ministry too, if they had known that they were targets for so long why didn’t they warn them? Why didn't they let Draco know what was happening? It was his own damn parents. Draco felt a hole form in his chest, swallowing up any goodness he felt he had in him.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, placing his back down in the kitchen and walking over to sit next to Draco. The proximity left him longing that he was back to 24 hours ago, when they were both drunk and careless.
Draco licked up the side of his shaft, impressed by its size. His tongue licked slowly over the tip, groans filling the air. As he was continuing his excruciatingly slow movements, the hand on his head pushed the dick further into Draco’s mouth, hitting the back of his throat, resulting in a slight choke, one that couldn’t be heard over the sound of Nick’s moans. He bobbed his head expertly up and down the length of his cock, using his hand as an extension of his mouth towards the base of the dick, eyes watering slightly from the pressure. Nick pulled his head off of his cock, muttering something like fuck, you’re gonna make me cum in between groans as he lifted Draco off his knees, grabbing his wrist and leading him into the bedroom.
“Look, Aaron. I’m sorry okay? It’s not like you’ve given me many ways to talk to you, ignoring me isn’t very mature either you know?” Draco said, his mind trying not to focus on the hurt on Harry’s face. He took his hand in his attempt of reassurance but Harry quickly pulled away.
“We need to talk.” was all he said, and it was enough for the adrenaline to rush through Draco’s body, suddenly every hair standing on end. He could smell the liquor off of Harry.
The concierge at his building eyed him suspiciously as he stumbled in through the front doors of his apartment building. Most likely reeking of alcohol and looking more than disheveled. He took the elevator up, enjoying the quiet jazz ambience music that played on his way up. As he stepped out, he turned the corner, eyes barely open and head rolling back, one placing itself lazily in front of the other. He reached his door, seeing the door slightly agape. Draco straightened up almost immediately, reaching for his wand and having it out in defence. He pushed the door slowly, it creaking slightly from the rusty hardware. He cast lumos, as he aged, his need to say easier spells out loud decreased with his strength. The light cascaded over his apartment, revealing a violent raiding. Nearly every drawer open, his belongings scattered across the area, glass broken, and furniture ripped. He walked further into the apartment, still on edge, unsure if whoever it was that did this was still there. The rest of his space was just as battered up. Draco made sure to check all the rooms and anywhere that someone could be hidden before letting the extent of the damage finally settle in.
Draco felt warm, his body tingling and disoriented in a way that felt comforting. Although by now it was nearly 2 in the morning, and as everyone was beginning to head home, Draco and Harry were left talking to Ron and Hermione on their couches.
“That’s not true!” Harry tried to reach for Draco’s arm, but it was flinched away. “I’m sorry! I didn’t know what to do, I was scared.” he cried.
There was always the fact that Harry was not even an option, he had made it so painfully clear that whatever had happened between them the night before was no more than a casual shag; Draco had slept with a string of men that he had not even given a second thought to the morning after, he shouldn’t have expected Harry to treat him any different. Despite this fact, his gut still wrenched at the words from this morning. We were both just drunk and horny. Although there was truth behind the words, Draco had allowed himself to believe it was something more, the blossoming of a new beginning into uncharted territory. To have the illusion broken down was perhaps the most painful.
Aaaah! I loved writing this chapter, this'll be the last chapter from Harry's POV for a while. Let me know your thoughts in the comments as always! :))
These patterns of unrequited affection in Draco’s life were taking a toll on him, and he didn’t have the energy to beg for proper attention from Harry Potter of all people. He would get through this just like he did with Noah. Begrudgingly and with a lot of alcohol.
“There’s no way in fucking hell that that piece of shit is staying at MY apartment!” He heard Harry booming throughout the hall, even with the door closed. If this was what the Ministry considered alternative housing, he wanted nothing to do with it. Living with Potter was not on his bucket list.
“Right. I’ll just spit it out I guess. Will you be my boyfriend? If not that’s completely fine I just feel like I’m ready for a deeper commitment with you and if you don’t feel that way-”
“Well, now that we have got your jealousy sorted out, can we please continue our date?” Draco said slyly, his lips up turning into a smirk.
“Good thing we always have today.” He responded. Pushing his face into Harry’s and colliding their lips together. He could taste the sweet aftertaste of brunch and orange juice in his mouth, his tongue exploring the other man's mouth.
“Right. Well, I should get going, Marie and Oliver are coming over for lunch today.” Draco finally stated.
“It’s a mess really. Basically we started fucking every couple of months when drunk. You know, he’s the whole “thinks he's straight but will only hook up with guys” type of person. He was dating Aurora still, but I caught feelings and then they got married and we stopped fucking. Really not that big of a deal.” He sighed as he realized how stupid he felt saying it all out loud. Noah was clearly a prick, and Draco was many things but he wasn’t the type of guy to let someone walk all over him.
That evening the four of them gathered around the boisterous kitching table, Hermione having laid out a feast and setting the table festively. Ron provided an assortment of alcohol for them to drink for which Draco was grateful. ALthough they didn’t necessarily have much in common, at least they were both heavy drinkers.
“As we all most likely know, Draco Malfoy’s apartment was recently raided.” A couple of murmurs travelled in between the aurors, quickly put to a hush as Marvin continued.
“Alright, that’s better. Now follow me.” Harry walked up down that hall and into the main square of the Ministry, walking towards the green domed portals in the entryway. He steps under the cylindrical shape, and grabs onto Malfoy’s hand. The strangeness of physical contact with Harry catches Malfoy off guard. Luckily, he had no time to process this feeling as they apparate to the front door of Harry’s apartment.
To this Harry responded by pressing his lips against Draco’s with a bit more force, still keeping the kiss tender and soft, as if afraid that movements too quick or harsh would break the spell. Draco kissed back lightly, before pulling away.
“Did you know? About my parents?” Draco finally said, wary of the response as he took another burning sip out of the bottle. Harry stayed quiet for a while, as if contemplating saying anything at all.
Harry had to explain to her what happened when she arrived, and she was furious with Harry’s lack of communication skills, cursing him out for not being more honest with the man he claimed to care so much about. She was, like always, correct. This brought up a mixture of feelings for Harry, not only the feelings of guilt but he also couldn’t help but feel that Draco was slightly over reacting.
Their hands went back to their own sides as they exited the car, Draco handing him some muggle money and closing the door behind him.
Harry loved seeing Draco so domestic, his usual perfectly fitted outfits now exchanged for casual slacks and a loose hoodie. Despite still looking presentable enough where he could go out and not be questioned, this is about as casual as Harry has ever seen him - besides when they’re in bed. His hair was unkempt and slightly frizzy, missing its usual gelled down look. His relaxed appearance mixed with the rustic beauty of their rented cottage, allowed for Harry to visualize a life together that was separate from all of the troubles of their childhood. Here there were no death eaters or Voldemort, and although he had led a life without them for nearly 10 years now, he still feels followed by his trauma. It's as if all of England is haunted by the life he led a decade ago, not allowing him to move on or forget.
“I haven’t been to one in ages! This is amazing. Thank you.” He said softly, brushing a hair that was hanging in front of his face behind his ear.
“Sure, why not. Remember that bistro outside my office? Let’s meet there at like 2 on Friday?” He said, his grey eyes waiting for a response.
“Now, you boys have been doing an excellent job at trying to track down this group, I’ve gotten word of another planned attack tomorrow in Northern London, I was hoping you two would go and investigate. Unless, of course, you wanna keep bickering about your living quarters Potter.” Harry bitterly shook his head no, and Marvin sent them off.
Harry called for him from the hall, already dressed and waiting at the front door. He had grabbed a bottle of wine to bring and was tapping his foot impatiently. Draco stepped out of his room, fixing his shirt last minute as he slipped on a pair of shoes, ignoring the feeling of Harry staring at him.
The group continued on with dinner, sharing two bottles of wine in between themselves, leaving Harry feeling warm and fuzzy. Whenever they all got together, it felt just as it did when they were younger, making Harry feel like life hadn’t changed all that much. The restaurant was starting to close, so they decided on walking Harry home before catching a train. The air was brisk and made his skin prickly, as the hair on his body extended from the abrupt change in temperature. They strolled down the streets in London, sharing stories about their times at Hogwarts, nostalgic for the few days where they felt they weren’t in impending danger. Ron and Hermione walked hand in hand, keeping each other warm, making Harry wildly aware of the emptiness of his own hand. He rarely felt like a third wheel with them, but on specific occasions when it was cold and dark, he wondered how nice it would be to have someone there.
Draco suppressed a laugh rising in his chest when looking at Harry’s current state; his hair messy and pulled apart, his lips slightly red and his shirt untucked with a few buttons undone. To say he looked unkempt would be an understatement.
“Me too. I mean - us, us too.” He mumbled awkwardly, receiving a scoff of amusement from Casper behind him.
Draco simply sat himself on the opposite side of the couch, his demeanour cold and unwelcoming yet ravishingly attractive. He was acting as if Harry was an inconvenience he couldn’t wait to be rid of.
Draco knocked on the light wood door that led to Aaron’s apartment, his ear picking up the shoeless footsteps that approached the door before it unlocked. He greeted Aaron, passing him his coffee and slipping into his couch, making himself comfortable. Aaron laughed at Draco’s ability to feel at home at his apartment, especially when he wasn’t one to be this casual when visiting another home, his parents would always scowl him for it as a child.
“Look, why don’t we talk about this tomorrow. I’m exhausted.” Draco stated, pushing his way past Harry and towards the door. He felt his elbow being snagged back.
Draco had thought about his dad, how broken he laid in the infirmary and struggling to deal with his guilt of not visiting him. Though he felt guilty, he knew that his father probably deserved whatever morbid things were done to him, yet that didn’t mean it made him sick to his stomach whenever he thought of it.
“Alright, alright, tell your old pal everything” Aaron chuckled as he pulled up a seat next to Draco and rested his hand on his shoulder. Draco nodded and began to tell him everything, the dinner with his old friends, the engagement, drinking far too much, and even down to seeing Potter at the bar. He could even admit what strange feelings it had stirred up seeing Potter after so long, especially when he had gotten significantly more attractive. It had always been so easy to talk to Aaron, he had been a great listener and always validated his emotions.
“Well open it! I can’t stand this anticipation” Harry complained, jittering in his seat like a child. Draco complied, lifting himself off of the couch and walking over towards the present, he sat down on the floor, tucking his legs underneath himself as he inspected the gift. Harry’s wrapping skills were far from perfect, the corners crumpled up in awkward angles, creating a lumpy surface over the box.
Draco rested his hand on the seat. Harry’s began inching closer to his, until their pinkies touched, the connection waking up Draco. Their fingers intertwined, despite the innocence of the act, Draco knew it meant much more between them, his eyes looking up to meet Harry’s.
“Maybe I don’t either.” Harry responded, bringing their faces closer. Their lips grazed lightly, before Draco reached his face further forward, connecting their lips. The kiss was soft at first, their lips pressing against each other lightly. Though it quickly grew deeper as Harry opened his mouth, their tongues connecting.
“I just didn’t feel that way about him and ever since - well lets just say this was the first time he’s bothered to speak to me since that morning.”
“I know, I know, I’m sorry. I’ll explain everything just please let me in.” Draco pleaded, putting on his best puppy dog face and outreaching his coffee and bagel. Aaron sighed and reluctantly opened the door, rolling his eyes and turning back into his apartment as he did.
Harry placed the head of the dick into his mouth, teasingly focusing on just the tip, making Draco groan for more. Harry looked up at Draco, his eyes mischievous. Draco moaned in anticipation, a desperate please escaping his mouth. Harry took the entirety of his length into his mouth, Draco’s cock hitting the back of his throat, making him moan loudly.
“Hail a taxi will you?” Draco instructed, drawing a cigarette out of his pocket and lighting it in his mouth. Gazing slightly back through the windows backcasted with the amber ambient light of the bar. Harry had looked better, happy. It made Draco wonder what his life was like nowadays, even Draco was able to say that he had gotten significantly more attractive since their days at Hogwarts. Although, whether he was able to admit it or not, Harry had always been his type.
“I would invite you two in, but to be honest, I don’t think I would be able to deal with the awkwardness of having all of us in a room with Malfoy.” They all laughed, knowing that it would be incredibly strange to interact in a setting outside of school.
“Don’t act all high and mighty just because this is the first time you haven’t run to a bottle of liquor after a minor inconvenience.” Harry spat, regretting the words as soon as they came out but too drunk to take them back.
“Don’t worry I’m not here stalking your highness, I simply have a meeting with Marvin.” he said, annoyed by the look of surprise on Harry’s face.
“Definitely, it's no bother at all.” Draco replied, softening his expression to exude genuineness. Harry nodded slowly, going back into his room to change into more appropriate dinner party attire.
“Alright, well, a couple of ground rules then. I usually end up leaving for work pretty early in the morning, and get back typically after dinner, so you can do whatever during the day, just clean up if you’re going to make a mess. I rarely have any groceries so if you want anything extra that’s on you to go and buy. Also, I would prefer it if there weren’t any strange women, or - uh, men, in the apartment, if you’re gonna go out, just go to their place.” Draco was slightly offended that Harry thought he was going to be bringing men home left and right, but I guess keeping in mind how their first recent encounter went, it wasn’t that surprising.
“Happy New Year to you too, Harry. I just wanted to quickly brief you on what’s been happening here at the Ministry, and I know, I know, you’re on holiday, but it should only take a moment of your time, no more than a few minutes.” Marvin stated, Harry rolled his eyes slightly, he never could properly disconnect himself from his job.
The night continued on and the questions about Draco’s love life had luckily stopped, it was nearing the closing time of the restaurant and Marie and Oliver had been eye fucking each other since their first finished bottle of wine. They made an excuse, something about Oliver having work early tomorrow morning and Marie needing to feed her fish and quickly wandered out of the restaurant, giggling amongst themselves. That just left Noah, Draco, and 4 empty wine bottles, never a good combination. They were sitting across from each other, ankles slightly grazing. Draco looked up from his glass and was met by light green eyes and a shackle of brown hair, the things that got him wrapped up in this whole mess in the first place, and after copious amounts of alcohol, made it very hard to resist his urge to invite Noah back to his apartment. He reached his arm slightly out and across the table and placed his fingers gently over Noah’s, holding his gaze and trying to search for reciprocation. They hadn’t said a word since Marie and Oliver left, and they usually didn’t need to, whatever they had was always unspoken about.
Draco trudged around the kitchen, eating pieces of leftover pizza from the night before, his dirty bathrobe swallowing his lanky body. He wished he could do something besides walk around the house like a bum, but when he tried to go to the Ministry earlier in the week and begged them to let him help, he was sent away. Draco tried to lead his own investigation, but with no intel whatsoever and not even the slightest idea as to where his parents could be, it was quickly brought to an end.
