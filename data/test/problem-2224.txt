“Potter, I” the words were soft-spoken and for the first time, it seemed the Slytherin was incapable of looking him in the eye.
“You can cum, pretty little slut” he growled out as he slammed forth one more time and held the omega against his hips as he felt his dick throb in the omegas hole as he was pumped full. A full-body shudder wracked him as his orgasm was only prolonged when the omega’s own orgasm ripped through him explosively, the sperm ejaculating all over the floor. The omega was trembling something fierce unable to stand on his own. As being speared on, Harry’s cock was the only thing keeping him from collapsing and probably hurting himself.
“You have such a spankable ass, whoever claims you will have fun. If you where my omega I would beat this ass every night just because I wanted to and then fuck you until you couldn’t walk the next morning. I bet you would love that wouldn’t you slut?” he commented as he ran his hands over the exposed buttocks kneading the flesh between his hands before he drew his hand back and a loud crack rang out through the hallway. He began spanking the omega in earnest alternating strength and position every so often so that the omega wouldn’t be able to get accustomed to his spanking. His hand danced across the reddening cheeks as he warmed the arse Infront of him. Working it over methodically making sure that every inch was kissed by his hand and the omega would remember their encounter every time he tried to sit down. Finally, after the arse had turned a nice glowing red, he stopped, rubbing his hands across the upturned bottom squeezing the cheeks roughly in his hands before pulling back.
“Merlin, your such a slut aren’t you. Making a mess all over the floor. Letting anyone who walks by use you.” He spoke his voice taking on that Alpha tone that sent shivers down any Omega’s spine as he trailed his hand over the exposed flank as if accessing him like he was cattle. “I think naughty little sluts should get punished before they get my cock. What do you think slut? Do you deserve to be punished?” he paused as if waiting for an answer and seeing as the omega wasn’t going to leave, he decided to get right down to it.
“No! You Can’t! I’m fine!” Surprisingly Malfoy seemed to respond with something besides whimpers and tears as he panicked trying to get away from Harry desperately. Why would he not want to be taken to Pomphrey?
“Such a good slut, taking your punishment so prettily. I bet you enjoyed that, my hand warming your pretty little ass cheeks. Bet you wish you could go over my knee daily don’t you, you fucking slut. Are you up for another fucking little one? My big cock splitting you open? I bet you would feel perfect as you clenched around me desperate for me to fill you up. What do you say? Think you can handle it? Scared omega?” he taunted praise mixing in naturally as he slipped his hand into the omegas. Waiting for him to consent. If he didn’t well, harry was going to need more than a cold shower that was for sure.
“But I’m not like those other alphas, I can control myself no matter how pretty you are. Don’t compare me to such pathetic specimens.” He spat cruelly before straightening his clothes and turning away from the panting omega who seemed dazed. “I apologize, Professor, please pass on my offer to Lord Malfoy as well as my apologies for overstepping. This should cover it” He said tossing a bag of coins at Severus before he turned and strode out of the room. Leaving behind a confused Alpha and a disappointed Omega.
Harry stopped to ponder the rumour that had been making the rounds the last few months. It was a poorly kept secret, that is to say, that everyone knew about it. Long ago there had been an attraction one could say near the Slytherin Dorms. Because of the placement and the omega that often frequented the site had gained the name The Slytherin Wall of Sluts. Omega suppressants, where still a new invention really only having become popular in the last three generations. Before that Omega’s would often enter their rut with no relief as they had yet to be mated off and many of these omegas were unable to handle the pain of a rut without a partner. These Omega desperate for relief would convince Alpha’s to fuck them, sometimes multiple Alpha’s as unlike when mated the Alpha didn’t stay until the Omega was satisfied. Because of this, many Alpha’s started to make bets about being able to convince certain highly sought-after Omega to go on the wall and be used repeatedly by the participating Alpha’s until the Omega became pregnant. The father of the child was considered the winner of the game as they not only would have assured the continuation of their line, but they almost always would gain the omega as their prize.
“I would have thought you would be congratulating the offenders not offering to testify against them” Severus spoke, the tone causing Harry to pause as his hand stilled for a moment as he turned his attention to Severus.
Now that was something else that had changed, with the end of the war. Severus had survived the attack by Nagini. Barely, but it counted. After the final battle when Harry had snuck away from the celebrations, he had returned to the Shrieking Shack wishing to retrieve Severus’s body to at least lay him to rest as the man deserved that at the very least. Finding the Slytherin still breathing but faintly he had rushed Severus to Pomphrey who had gone to work immediately. They had almost lost him so many times before dawn broke that when he was finally stabilized, they had all breathed a collective sigh of relief. The relationship between the two had improved greatly, well to those who knew the two well could tell that it had to but to those outside of their trusted circle; it still appeared as if the two could barely stand to be in the presence of the other.
was cute. Casting an overpowered sticking charm to ensure even if someone did stumble across them, they were not going anywhere; Harry gently scooped Malfoy into his arms where the Omega confirmed his suspicion that he had lost himself to his instincts when he turned his face into Harry’s chest and nuzzled against him letting out little enticing whines and whimpers that went straight to his already very interested cock.
“And that’s the problem! Thinking like that is only going to make it easier for the next Dark Lord! And they would be wrong.”
Shooting up in his bed, he was disgusted to see that it had happened again. Every night since the final battle, Harry would wake long before dawn, unable to sleep. Reaching up to touch his face which was aching he groaned realizing it was one of
Noting the state of Malfoy’s robes, and the fact they left very little to the imagination he shrugged out of his own robes and wrapped them around Malfoy a soft smile making an appearance as the distressed Omega snuggled into the cloth. Had Malfoy always been that cute? Cute? Malfoy? Shaking his head as he must be more tired than he thought if he was thinking that
“Sorry Professor, I came across some Alpha students attacking Malfoy, and he freaked out when I suggested going to Madam Pomphrey, but he needs someone to look over him and make sure he’s alright. We both know I am
“Such a good little slut, Spread so prettily for your Alpha” he whispered as he allowed the omega to regain his footing though his body was still wracked with shudders every few moments. “Think you could go another round slut?” he asked as he pulled out and slapped the reddened arse slightly. He swore he actually heard a whimper as the omega started to tremble. “Shh, it’s ok. Not tonight then. Maybe another night” he said as he used his cloth to once more wipe the omega down. Gently cleaning him, enjoying the shudders that wracked the omega anytime Harry would touch the oversensitized flesh. He grinned as he spread the omega’s cheeks, feeling the heat from the spanking. After cleaning the away any leakage, he pressed a kiss to the winking bud for a moment before pulling back and casting a cooling charm on his reddened arse. He felt the omega sag in relief when the cooling charm relieved the heat from his well-spanked, and well fucked arse.
“Nobody deserves to be treated like that, regardless of the fact he is an omega. There are procedures in place for approaching an unmated omega with the intent to court, just as there are procedures for an omega to request an alpha claim them. Though I would hope that Lord Malfoy would have better sense than to waste such a valuable piece on such weak alphas” Harry sneered as he went back to carding his fingers through the blonde hair when Draco whimpered. “Shh I’m right here, silly boy can you let Professor Snape finish cleaning you up and heal you for me? Can you do that?” he asked his voice which had seconds before been cold softened as he spoke to Malfoy. Severus had expected Draco to baulk but was surprised when Draco immediately stilled.
“If you would not mind, please inform Lord Malfoy if he wishes to press charges against those who damaged his omega son, I would be willing to testify.”
“You are filthy” he muttered as he struggled to remove all of the semen that was covering the beautiful little omega. The sheer amount of mess on the male would have been impossible to get through if it wasn’t for the spells placed on the cloth that kept it from getting soiled. The omega tensed upon hearing his voice something he wasn’t surprised by as everyone knew who he was. As he parted the Omega’s cheeks, he roughly scraped the semen off the omega’s entrance, slightly shoving the cloth inside his entrance scraping at his insides. As he cleared the semen away, it revealed a painful-looking red and swollen hole that seemed to quiver at every touch. Harry took sadistic pleasure at the quivering muscle as he blew on it after cleaning the mess away before he struck, the tips of his fingers striking against the Omega’s hole once, twice, three times before he allowed the Omega’s cheeks to close again. Wishing that he could have heard the whimpers that he knew would have escaped the omega at having his hole spanked.
As he wandered the halls taking in the destruction that even now months after the battle ended and school had resumed wasn’t completely fixed. Most of the classes had been relocated to the dungeons as it was the most structurally sound part of the castle. Haunted by the memories of the final battle, still fresh in his head from the nightmare caused Harry to veer off towards the Slytherin common rooms. His memories couldn’t haunt him there. As the worst memory, he really had was returning Draco’s wand to him at the entrance to the Slytherin Common Room after the battle was over. Draco had looked like he thought Harry was going to turn his wand against him. Maybe he did, after all, many of the students had been incredibly cruel to the Slytherin students after the battle. Something he couldn’t understand. Wasn’t it enough! Hadn’t they lost enough already! Bullying the Slytherins made them no better than the Death Eaters themselves. Something harry had angrily bit out shoving the wand back at Malfoy.
Thoughts of Malfoy, of course, caused Harry’s cock to harden in his trousers. The pale skin of his incredibly fuckable arse would look so good as he worked it over, painting every inch a lovely red before mounting him and riding him like the bitch in heat he knew he was. The image of a completely debauched Draco, face flushed, beautiful grey eyes clouded over with lust, his platinum blond hair plastered to his head with sweat, the little whimpers he would make as harry completely abused his prostate slamming into the bundle of nerves repeatedly and viciously. His cock purple with need but unable to cum without Harry’s permission and he would have to work for it, tears pooling in those beautiful eyes as he begged Harry to have mercy. But Harry wouldn’t. He would continue to torment the boy until he couldn’t take it anymore, calling him a slut as he begged Harry to let him cum.
What had he been thinking? Draco Malfoy regardless of what he had done in the end, they would never be able to get along. Not with the thoughts that plagued Harry’s mind of the things he would like to do to the blond ponce. A shudder had wracked his body as their fingers touched. Merlin was he fucked up. Was he any better than Voldemort with the things he wanted to do to Malfoy?
Seeing as he could pass this class with his eyes closed, he allowed his mind to drift back to last night and the Omega he had encountered. There was something about the Omega that was bothering him; he felt as if he should know the scent, granted the spells in that corridor were designed to obscure the omegas within to “protect” their identity there was just something about the Omega that wouldn’t let him rest. He wasn’t quite ready to admit it to anyone, but he was eagerly anticipating nightfall. He was unable to prevent himself from peering at the Omega in class, wondering if they were the Omega who had captured his attention so completely. The females were quickly discarded. A sigh escaped his lips as he wished desperately for the class to be over so that he could try to distract himself from the thoughts that kept spinning around his head all seeming to be centered on the mysterious Omega.
The rumours were not exaggerating. The window was positioned directly across from the only omega currently in attendance. The soft moonlight seemed to caress the pale skin of the arse that was hanging out of the wall. His hands locked in place behind him gripping the silver bar above his waist tightly, semen was painting the omega’s cheeks, dripping down the crack and pooling in the floor under him. His balls seemed to be swollen almost as if the omega had been prevented from cuming the whole time. Red Tally marks were painted on his left check showing that he had been visited by seven Alpha’s tonight alone causing Harry to chuckle darkly as he approached pulling out a handkerchief and wiping the omega down removing the rancid scent of other Alphas.
Dumbledore stared at the fireplace in disbelief, (Hogwarts isn't letting me deactivate the floo … it's not under my control.) He thought as he realized he lost the biggest ally he's had and he was now living in the enemy's very stomach. The terrifying thought made the wizard stumble back a few paces as his mind reeled. As if to mock him further, green flames shot out of the fireplace and the minister walked out.
He sat down at the small spot on the table that wasn’t covered in books and carefully ate his food so he didn’t upset his stomach by eating too much too fast. The 50 or so books were stacked in six piles with the titles facing outwards for easy viewing. In front of his meal were the charms book he was reading, the potions book where he found the potion recipes he has used so far, the bottomless bag filled with potion ingredients and his homework.
"We have a special room. Pettigrew won't escape once he's inside and the Aurors waiting there can make the arrest there." The goblin said with a dangerous sneer. Perhaps he was enjoying this situation more than he thought.
The walking stick was propped up against the chair so Cache could grab it quickly and returned to securing Lucius’s wrist to the armrest. With his left hand holding the Malfoy’s wrist in place Cache held his right hand over the glowing tracker and whispered the incantation to remove it. The Malfoy could feel a burning sensation as the boy began wandlessly tugging the cursed tracker away. It felt like needles were stabbing his skin. Granted it wasn’t anywhere near as bad as the torture curse, but he knew Draco would benefit greatly with a pain reliever.
Cornelius sighed as all the Hogwarts professors looked worried for the two boys when they didn’t need to be “would everyone just calm down! Tanzanite is Julian’s familiar”
Minerva nodded and since Hagrid wasn’t allowed to do magic because of his expulsion years ago, which shocked Cache who did see the giant use magic before, she cast a quick spell on the three felines. A piece of paper appeared and she read the results aloud “Cache’s familiars are full blooded Persian kneazles, which are very rare” she said curious as to how a young man managed to find two let alone one.
Black eyes locked onto false blue …
“yeah. Severus wanted to see what was going on with bumbles so he went straight to Hogwarts and I get his spot watching the ‘dunderheads’ as he puts it. We don’t mind, right girls?” Cache chuckled as the kneazles mewed “so lets go get a compartment … oh, did you tell your grandmother about your wand?” he asked as they boarded the train and looked for a compartment.
“huh? … oh I’m fine. Just lost in thought” (albeit some very disturbing thoughts) “thanks Neville” Harry smiled as he locked his trunk and lifted it off his bed. Neville smiled and nodded in understanding as he set his toad next to Hedwig’s cage.
” Remus asked weakly.
’ Gloria offered, soon after Brian and Harry were riding on the back of the large intimidating crocodile upstream and enjoying the very different environment Australia has compared to the UK …
“we’ll see … where does she live?” Moody asked a little calmer than before.
Julian pouted, but slowly pulled his hand back into the wards forcing the occamy to let go. He immediately felt a little guilty when the occamy cried out sadly and flew in circles before growing to it’s full size and taking to the sky. For some reason Julian felt the occamy was worried about him “Daddy we need to hurry … he’s worried”
The young wizard smirked and took the truck with the tracker on it out of the cupboard. He left the cupboard wide open with the padlock on he floor and went up the stairs to the attic. The tracked glasses and carrier soon joined the items in the trunk. The homework was torched with the clothes inside, the phoenix wand was snapped and placed in the trunk. The textbooks put safely away in the green bottomless bag and he went on the computer …
A month passed and Stephen came by and taught Julian every other day. The little boy was learning fast for he was already starting to control what he sees. The ability to see auras is apparently only the beginning. As he learned to focus his mind using some meditation exercises that made the distracting colors gradually lessen so Julian could shift to sensing them instead. Normally starting this class in school reveals powers like seeing auras, but Julian developed early, which is why Stephen insisted on teaching the boy right away.
“but you won’t be in the same house as Harry. Don’t you want that? Who knows maybe you to will get married one day, but there’s no chance if you’re a snake” he argued desperately.
Cache noticed his kneazles start to race up the stairs “slow down before you crash into something again! … barely a foot in the door and they’re wreaking havoc” Sanguini and some other vampires smiled in amusement as they heard a thump on the fourth floor. It seems things might get more interesting around here …
Brian sighed, this was not something the boy should’ve had to endure “that seems weird doesn’t it? How can something not exist, but be evil?” the little boy looked confused “your aunt and uncle have lied to you. Magic is very real, in fact, that story I told you is true” Harry stayed quiet as he listened “you are the little boy who stopped the wizard and your parents were wizards too. You and I are both magical too. Have any strange things happened around you before?”
It seemed so unlikely that Sirius just stumbled in at the exact moment Dumbledore was talking out loud about the exact details he needed to find Severus. Something seemed so wrong about it and stranger still Dumbledore wasn’t talking at all when he came after Sirius only a moment later. The timing was just too perfect, but the more he thought about that moment in the headmaster’s office he remembered there. He was too worried about Sirius to notice at first, but now he remembered a familiar scent in the office. A scent he knew very well, but couldn’t place it …
Cache shut the door and turned around to see Hedwig perching outside on the balcony rail “coming Hedwig!” he pulled out the new very tall perch that had a hook to hang a cage and five higher branch like pieces for lots of perching options from his bottomless bag. The 12 foot tall perch was set just a few feet from the sliding glass doors and he hung the cage on the hook before letting the owl in “nice huh, I got the deluxe version” he said as he watched Hedwig flutter from each perch to test it before settling happily in her cage. It took a chunk of what money he had left, but it was worth it.
A frown marred Frank’s face as he watched the duo apparate away …
Ginny took a deep breath to calm herself “Ron wanted me be resorted. I thought he just wanted me with him and my other brothers, but I told him no. He … he got so mad and said I was choosing snakes over my family. That’s when he tackled me to the ground and punched me” she said sadly. Cache got out of the way so her brothers could sit with her.
Over the years he started to realize how warped his family’s original beliefs and the current beliefs of the magical people of the UK are. Just yesterday his parents took him to a trip to Diagon Alley, which they rarely go to anymore since there’s nothing there he needs for school, it was like stepping back in time. A dark and depressing time at that. People were so close minded especially the ones taunting the poor snakes in the pet shop. For him that hurt the most because he used to be like that. He would walk through those streets as a young child with his parents and he even asked one time why they were taunting the snakes. Even though it was years ago he recalled his father saying that the evil Dark Lord was able to speak to snakes and somehow that meant snakes were evil too, but that it was only those who could speak to them. Come to think of it that was the only time his father discussed the Dark Lord who once waged war on the magical world in the UK.
The minister rolled his eyes “the punishment for such a crime is two weeks in Azkaban. He spent ten years in Azkaban for a crime he didn’t commit all because no one bothered to give him a trial. I believe he served his time don’t you?” Cornelius suppressed a smirk as the member dumb enough to make such a comment sheepishly slumped back into his seat “well since we cleared that up lets return to the questions … Sirius what do you mean by ‘we’ and what were the animal forms?”
“it’s been a very long time since I taught, but before we start you will be eating, understand?” Trocar’s tone left no room for any arguments.
“I said you’d get a candy not necessarily that you’d get to pick it. Besides how am I supposed to know what you like?” Cache asked good naturedly, which is a vastly different attitude than the professor who shot Hermione a nasty glare for her own attitude “now as for your answers you missed a few-”
Julian simply smiled and held up his little glass soul orb “I found the rest of Tom” he exclaimed happily.
Albus smiled as he saw Severus Snape enter his office at Hogwarts “Severus my boy where have you been? I have been trying to track you down all day”
Severus gritted his teeth trying to control himself “the Dark Lord split his soul into pieces so he couldn’t die. He’s still out there and we have to take this chance to destroy the soul pieces anchoring him here or he’ll return with a body and full power”
The car ride home was very quiet, awkward and seemed to take far longer than 30 minutes. Soon they parked in the driveway and Harry was roughly dragged into the house by his arm “it’s about time freak! Get cooking!” Dudley glared as Vernon shoved him towards the stove.
“Let me through! My cub is in there! He’s human! He’ll be killed so let me through or I’ll get in myself!” Remus snapped angrily.
Fourteen books and far too much time later Harry found a spell book that might help. With one hand holding the ball of light and the other flipping through the pages he made his way through the spells. Each spell was fascinating! Harry couldn’t wait to actually read the book, but right now he had to focus …
Draco pouted even as Lyra nuzzled his hand “why Father? Neither of you took one”
Brian smiled “yes I am”
Dumbledore huffed as he flounced into Gringotts “the nerve of that boy and here I was trying to help him … werewolves drinking pumpkin juice, yeah right. They drink … bone marrow” he decided as he strutted up to the goblin at the counter “I need to speak with Griphook now” ordered the old wizard.
"He needs some time." Sophia said as her husband went towards the door and glanced in the hallway most likely to make sure no one followed the Malfoy. "Everything ok?" She asked, when Severus visibly stiffened.
“well it’s the end of another year Severus” said Minerva as she strolled down with a relaxed smile on her lips.
I’m thinking)
“yes … he probably shouldn’t wake up here” Stephen shrugged as he saw the other adults look at him waiting for an explanation “this room looks vaguely like the Dursleys’ guest bedroom. At least it would to him, his eyesight isn’t great. It might scare him” Stephen commented.
“perfect timing as always Severus” said Griphook as he came over to the tall potion master.
Brian yawned as he stood up, “It’s alright. It’s only …” Brian glanced at the clock and chuckled, “Five in the morning.” He said shooting an amused smile at his son who looked rather sheepish. “Let me get dressed and we’ll go.” He said and smiled amusedly as Julian ran to the kitchen to start the coffee maker for his Dad.
The cauldron was set up, the toasted whisker grounds were taken out and he started …
After that Frank returned feeling much better and everything was less tense from there on out, but Severus was still under the impression that the werewolf suspected him of something. Not that it mattered much since Frank had to leave soon to be ready for the full moon anyway. Once Trocar appeared the werewolf was gone.
"What?" Severus gasped and turned taking little Isabell with him. He saw that Sanguini's eyes were solid dark red and the vampire seemed to be frozen in place. "Isaac, watch your sister!" Severus exclaimed giving the little girl to her brother.
Draco looked at the tattoo, "Is it moving?" He asked curiously. It wasn't strange to find a magical tattoo moving, but there was something unique about the way the door was moving that was different than normal.
Cache absentmindedly shrugged, "Fun fact, 1 in every 200 witches and wizards, regardless of any relation to the Slytherin family, actually can speak parseltongue and that's needed to get in the chamber. I helped out once before so I'm not surprised that they'd ask though I doubt I'll be allowed to go in after that basilisk incident." He said casually before pulling out a pencil and signing.
“you’re right, I’ll just try my best and not worry … too much” Neville decided albeit a bit hesitantly.
The sound of shaking in the back made David leave for a moment and return with two beautiful wands. The strong pulse of magic given off as each wand was picked up surprised everyone, but none more so than Neville …
Severus opened the heavy wooden door to the records room in Hogwarts “now I don’t know for sure, but considering the Dark Lord hates Dumbledore so much, speaks parseltongue, is supposedly the heir to Slytherin and people claim Death Eaters are Slytherin it stands to reason that he attended Hogwarts as a student. Why else would Dumbledore and Hogwarts be the center of much of the war?”
The group went up a few floors in an old cage elevator and made their way to a desk where the minister’s secretary was seated “excuse me, we have to see the Minister” Lucius said firmly making it quite clear that this was an important matter.
“yeah, that makes sense” Stephen chuckled and pointed to the blue section and tapped it making a little word appear in the lens that shifted to the blue section. The little word in the magnifying lens was ‘calm’ “blues are calm, but lots of different blues means he can be lighthearted and curious. Your Daddy is very accepting of other people’s ideas. Red means temper. If by some chance your Dad gets angry it is strong, but you said a little red so he doesn’t get mad easily or very often. Now what about your godfather here?”
Trocar rubbed circles on Harry’s back trying to calm the young wizard though the kneazles were doing a better job by laying on his feet and rolling around cutely “it’ll be over before you know it”
The potion master was now truly awake and he unknowingly released Harry’s wrist in an instinctual attempt to get away from the pain, but Armel wasn’t letting go of the wizard any time soon “let me go” Severus glared at the vampire who remained as still as a statue while holding the busted human’s limb and none of the other Dark creatures made any move to help.
“right away” the goblin said with a smirk and he left quickly, which pleased Dumbledore greatly since they usually don’t show him the respect he deserves here. He missed the goblins speaking quietly amongst themselves and glaring at him.
Neville stood up and kissed both his parents goodbye “goodbye Mom, goodbye Dad. I’ll be back next week” he left the ward, but patted both kneazles “could you take me to Cache please. I need to talk with him” Neville asked, he had to know for sure. The kneazles purred and trotted away at a pace that Neville could easily follow. They went towards the stairs and down a flight. There was the apprentice healer in the stairwell leading to the first floor. The kneazles went down to meet the blonde, but Neville stopped and … took a couple steps back up the stairs?
“I’m Cache and I could use two wands please” Cache said as he came towards the counter.
Blue eyes looked up and Cache smiled halfheartedly “I kind of stumbled on some information that lead to the discovery of the Dark Lord’s continued survival” he answered and mentally winced when he saw the family, Draco especially, smile gratefully at him.
“that’s impressive for one so young. Most kids waste away their summer, but you will be far and above your peers come summer’s end” Trocar sat down and took note of the 12 books on the table and the sad look on the blonde’s face.
Minerva frowned understanding the subtle message, but while the relief from knowing her student was safe flooded her body it was soon followed by concern, "With a name like that you may have trouble hiding. What made you think choosing a French phrase was a good idea? Yes I know. Both Poppy and Severus had to fill in some apprentice paperwork so you could work here.
The goblin manager of the Potter accounts went to another office and went in “Razorback I have an offer for your clients, the Malfoys” the other goblin looked irritated until Griphook started explaining …
"I'll handle her!" They heard Mike call out from his bedroom.
Frank chuckled, "Unless we tried biting you all." He said clearly joking, but the students stiffened slightly.
“whar’s going on?” Sophia asked worriedly.
“I could always buy something for you” Trocar offered, but Cache just shook his head and politely declined the offer. The vampire shrugged and leapt over the rail landing gracefully on the ground four stories below.
“chores …” Brian sighed, he didn’t want to give the boy chores, but this would be a good chance to start good habits “you only have to worry about recovering and taking your medicine for now, but afterwards you will have to keep your room tidy, doing your best in school and listening to the rules. Rule 1, is to tell me if you’re in pain or hungry. Rule 2, is for both of us and it’s to tell the truth. Understand?”
“it has to do who you really are, right?” Draco asked innocently wanting to know who his friend was since the hints in the letters began.
“hold it! You’re going to check on Cache aren’t you?!!” Blaise asked curiously. Everyone knew by now that Cache flooed into Severus’s living quarters. It wasn’t hard to figure out and if the Malfoy’s sudden increase in pace was anything to go by then Blaise was right “I knew it! You want to make sure he’s ok … you’re going to try asking Cache something”
Minerva gasped and looked at Brian with disapproval “you got your son an occamy for a familiar!”
“Hedwig … I think we have a solution. I just need to test it” Harry grinned as Hedwig hooted happily. The ticking of the grandfather clock caught his attention. It was late. The experiments could wait until the morning. The thought of sleeping in the cell his cousin’s rooms or his aunt and uncle’s room made him sick so he slipped under the fresh clean sheets of the bed in the guest room.
In the morning Harry started toasting some kneazle whiskers like he did before and got his quartz cauldron ready. Even though Trocar wasn’t there yet he wanted to start. The toasted grounds were sprinkled in the boiling water and the reaction started. First the potion turned pale green and it seemed to do nothing beyond that. Harry frowned wondering if he should try something, but then he jolted back a bit as the solution started bubbling violently.
A couple hours later it was time to leave and Harry spotted Neville waiting nervously at the floos in the lobby. He smiled and went into a fireplace with his kneazles and Neville. With a burst of green flames they came out of the fireplace and into Harry’s apartment. It was obvious that Trocar hasn’t arrived yet since the windows were open and sunlight was pouring in.
Both large felines glanced at him … and to his surprise slowed down their eating. The book did say that Kneazles were smart. Harry watched the cats quietly … how anyone could believe such big beautiful felines had any relation to Ms. Figg’s beloved long haired flat faced cats he just couldn’t fathom. Maybe her clients are idiots … or blind. He noticed that the larger Kneazle had a limp and wondered if there were more injuries under the fur or because they were crammed in a tiny space.
Harry turned to see if they could find a safer way out and suddenly fell to the ground making Trocar turn and see a pair of big golden eyes “Basilisk!” he screamed as he scooped up the limp wizard since as a vampire he was unaffected by those eyes …
Bill kneeled next to his brother, who looked pale, and sighed, "Speaking of Dumbledore we should discuss cutting ties before the trial. That means get the divorce pushed through now and ... there's apparently an extra account we weren't aware of." He said looking at Ron.
“ok … night Aster” said Brian as he laid on the floor.
There was no backing out of this so he wordlessly summoned the red counter potion next to his new brown colors he will use on Hedwig and removed the disguise. The kneazles and owl watched warily as red eyes met green …
“yes, Poppy wanted me to meet someone to teach me potions. Severus Snape is my potions mentor now” Cache said as he got up to let the kneazles in for dinner before they claw through the door. That was Harry’s mistake … he forgot to take the creature’s sense of smell into account.
Instead they had two magical parents who were murdered by relatives that were terribly old fashioned and a bit insane. The twins were cut out of their mother and taken away all because their parents tried to leave the families lifestyle and start fresh. When the twins finally opened their eyes their fate was sealed. The pretty orange eyes were seen as a curse and the relatives treated them as such. It wasn’t until they were ten they were saved and it was thanks to the very relatives who tormented them. Their uncle became furious at someone for not believing his insane disillusions and tried to kill the bystander in public. The uncle was taken to Australia’s magical prison where he broke down ranting those who opposed his family’s greatness like the ‘cursed trash in the cellar’ … that comment prompted an investigation that ended with the girls being found and saved …
Harry Potter was going in a straight path at really fast speeds and was headed for the Atlantic ocean!
Wolfs bane was the first to fall into the potion professor’s basket, but before Snape moved on through the shelves something caught his eye between the gaps of the shelves …
“well we better not keep your kneazles waiting” said Sanguini as he and Cache headed up the stairs.
"A basilisk? I don't know what you mean. Where would a basilisk even hide?" Dumbledore asked, desperately hoping to not have another secret exposed.
Harry looked up from the mostly mended wound of the werewolf’s formerly severed arm when he heard the babies cry, “Unless you can lactate now then you better hand the babies over, Trocar!” Harry chuckled as Trocar paused in thought as if he was actually considering if he can over just handing over the babies. Of course, the babies’ cries prompted the mother hen to hand over the babies to an exhausted Greyback who was tired from chasing the damn vampire for nearly an hour.
Silvia smiled mischievously and licked her lips “nice butt and looks potentially hung”
Harry frowned “yes, though Neville shouldn’t have to fear her constantly if at all”
“you sent Sanguini here that’s what!” Severus exclaimed trying to feel a little irritated even though it did turn out well and the cute kneazle was destroying what irritation he could muster.
Mrs. Crippens and her sons should be there. That’s how they worked they always arrive early and load everything up. When you schedule a time with them they believe they should leave by that time not arrive at that time. The Crippens were an odd, but kind family. Harry was positive they were the reason the police came to the Dursleys’ a few times, but now he realizes not much could’ve been done with Ms. Figg watching. The squib most likely had a back up plan to stop muggles from helping the wizard. Since he realized he was going for good he had Hedwig drop a letter on the pile of items waiting to be taken away.
“thank you master Griphook” Harry said as he stood up and went towards the door.
The head under the mop of black hair nodded and Harry moved to pull u his shirt to show a burn scar on his tummy “this one hurts” he mumbled softly.
"What happened? Where's Ron? Tell me, Arthur! Something happened during those ridiculous detentions, didn't it?" Molly demanded.
"That's comforting … I think. I'm glad there won't be any surprises there unlike Dumbledore." Draco grumbled as he added more marshmallows making his drink more of a hot marshmallow goo, which Harry found very funny.
This trunk was everything he owned … Hedwig fluttered downstairs with a mouse hanging from her beak … Harry froze. If someone went so far to put tracking charms on him and his stuff would they also put one on Hedwig?
“what?” Harry stiffened, but that sense of clarity was gone as quickly as it came and Alice started muttering incoherently again. The young wizard stared at the woman for a few seconds. Who was this woman to him besides a friend’s mother? Did she know the Potters? He checked the clipboard and found that they were both driven insane do to the torture curse. The wizard decided to do some research on that curse before smiling and placing a kiss on her head. Alice didn’t notice, but it didn’t matter. The disguised Potter smiled and left with his kneazles to go to the 5
He took someone’s life … didn’t that matter?
floor for lunch.
It took a couple minutes to catch up to the tall professor and he was out of breath when he finally went skidding to a stop near the potions room “Wait!” he gasped and gulped air greedily to help his lungs before looking up at the cold black eyes “please Professor Snape, I need to talk to you-”
“Bloody vampire.” Severus grumbled, dropping the potion bag and helped administer the potions.
Those words Lucius managed to utter before being dragged into Severus' living quarters echoed in his mind. There was something about insanity and mental decline. There was something else about a broken soul and that fact pointed to only one person. The very person who he wanted Harry Potter to kill. The wizard who knew too much should have a shattered, but apparently was treated and alive ...
Sophia blushed as she held Severus’s arm “so where should we stay?”
Fran hummed thoughtfully, "Papa doesn't like talking about it, but what was it like for our kinds before?"
The fake blonde shook his head “no, I only have the potion I use to change my eye color and I’m not allowed to recreate my Nerve Tonic now that I turned it into the lab at St. Mungo’s, but that’s not a problem. I can still make potions without seeing reds and greens for a while and I know what was bothering me throughout my first year”
With a few hours until dinner he sat on he couch and tried to relax in a way that wouldn’t make him fall asleep …

The second drawing made Brian pause. It was of a child bleeding on the floor under gaze of a fat red faced man who was most likely his uncle, but in the crudely drawn window was a wolf … was it a coincidence or was it meant to depict him?
At first he was horrified that this got out. It baffled him until the Daily Prophet confirmed that a first year student sent in his own memories to confirm the story. If it was a letter then the wards would’ve scanned it and he’d know, but the wards can’t scan a vial of memories so he couldn’t stop. The source of the memories was unnamed, bu he knew it was a Slytherin.
“this is much less conspicuous and I can dump them without worrying about running around completely blind … I just need to change the lenses to non prescription ones” Harry felt yet another burden lift off his shoulders. He put the groceries away and placed all his potions ingredients on the counter. Until he fixes up the attic he will leave them out … except all of the items going to Snape’s personal supplies. Those stayed in Snape’s bottomless bag …
Severus nodded as he walked towards the room, but paused when Narcissa slipped into the office (that was interesting … maybe) he let a bat tattoo sneak out of his buttoned sleeve a flutter stealthily into the office before slipping into Draco’s room and sat next to the bed with a flushed feverish child shifted to look up at him “hello Draco, how are you?” he asked. In the back of hs mind he could feel his bat trying to transmit what it’s witnessing to him, but he raised his mental shields in order to focus on the boy in front of him.
Dumledore smirked as he popped a lemon drop in his mouth and relaxed in his home “everything is going to plan … Severus almost became an issue though” the wizard frowned as he reflected back on an event from just after the train left Hogwarts …
“he means Mr. Lupin who I doubt would allow abuse. It would go against his nature as a werewolf” Severus said barely spotting the harsh glare that flashed across Dumbledore’s face for a spit second.
"Not yet. I'll first owl my parents to tell them I'm with you and about Greg and Vincent." Draco said as he let his owl out onto the perch to sit with Hedwig.
Best case scenario is that he’ll end up with blue eyes, blonde hair and something to remove the fake color. The fourth vial will is skin color, but he will need to stick his finger in for that one.
With that off his chest he left with his three pets. Hedwig flew ahead and Harry took Lyra and Libra, under the safety of the invisibility cloak, to the Leaky Cauldron. The kneazles waited under the cloak as Harry slipped into the AbFa Emporium to buy two large dog beds, two red pet bowls with paw prints and a candle. Sadly that was the last of his muggle money and he now only had 100 galleons left. That should be fine since he planned to start brewing at home after getting his own cauldron.
“CACHE!” before the disguised Potter could move he was hugged by a little girl. Her name was Maria and she was a vampire who looked only 10 years old. To most she would look like a little girl with waist length blonde hair who likes wearing this one white dress with a pink bow, but she was actually older than Trocar.
The waiting only lasted a few years when he noticed another entity enter. As he floated over to greet this one with the others something else came in. It was another like them, but there was so much anger and hate that they backed up for a moment. After a second sizing up the tiny angry entity, they rushed forward and the six entities tackled the seventh one. Despite the clear conscious attempts to pull away and assert control, the first six got around him and they were able to stick like usual, but they didn't break away like usual. In fact, they began getting more and more stuck …
Hermione gave a high and mighty look and smiled “while I admit they look similar to the kneazles that my Crookshanks is related to, but they are clearly missing the mane and therefore can’t be kneazles. You were conned Malfoy. You really should’ve gone to reputable breeder like the one I went to right after school ended” she said smugly as she picked up her
"But my son is with a Death Eater! I have to go!" Arthur pleaded. Lucius, for his part, looked calm, but being a father himself he could not only understand the feelings of worry Arthur must be feeling he was feeling them right now as well. After all, Draco was in the same place as Ron, who apparently has a cowardly rat he knew would do anything save his own tail, even kill.
"It was ruled as an unusually severe natural blowback." Slashclaw smirked, "Of course, even if you were we'd only thank them." The basic light spell was pressed against Dumbledore and the wizard screamed before gargling up his own blood. With a quick scan it was confirmed. Dumbledore was dead ...

” he hissed in parseltongue and the occamy grabbed the turban from the stunned wizard at the exact same time Julian thrut the orb forward to touch the head. Quirrell collapsed with a scream and another soul fragment …
Harry settled down to finish eating as he read the letter …
"I refuse to have him in there!" Hermione snapped.
The potion master nodded in approval “I believe there’s special on ice cream cauldron cakes coming so your friend has the right idea. I’ll still get you something”
“my name is Brian Isaac White, what’s your name?” Brain asked as laidback as ever even though he was truly dreading what the boy may say. For once Brian prayed his insanely accurate friend, Stephen, was wrong, but it wasn’t meant to be as the boy looked confused before finally saying …
” Petunia huffed as she hugged Arabella trying to sooth her … an action Harry wasn’t aware she was capable of.

Narcissa’s eyes widened “Bellatrix … she came after torturing the Longbottoms right before
Julian pouted as he tried to recall what his Daddy taught him about animals “the dragon’s tiny cousin, right? They can spit fire just like a dragon, but they swim and shrink too”
Really the skin color was important to cover his distinctive scar, but maybe he can get away with this. He eagerly picked up the vial with golds and put a little on his hands. He ran his fingers through his hair and washed his hands. To his relief his hands didn’t become gold so he knew he could wash it off before it dried. After putting caps on each vial he took them upstairs and looked in the bathroom mirror.
Several hours passed as the ministry went through the entire lockdown process. It took so long that people had to transfigure their desks into beds for a rest. To be precise, it wasn't the process of removing the potions that took so long, but actually the process of finding everyone still in the field and making them come in. Also going through each person who was potioned and figuring out what each specific potion was doing to them.
Severus studied the vampire a moment before answering “he’s doing well despite his head being split wide open. I checked on him before he flooed to King’s Cross to board the train. He was understandably thrilled to hear that the investigation revealed three other horcruxes. One from the Black manor, one from the bank vault belonging to Bellatrix and finally from the Malfoy Manor all of which were destroyed along with the one that was in Harry. Save for a minor scuffle with a house everything went well. Harry did mention trying to pay back Lucius who ended up paying for the ritual since Harry fell unconscious, but I told him there was no point trying to argue with Malfoys when they owe a debt”
So much was missed, but after coming out of his room and doing some research on other means of mind control Dumbledore did notice one thing “where’d my floo powder go?” he pondered, but shrugged it off and had a house elf get some more as he went to speak with the professors … and hopefully watch some drama unfold …
Brian chuckled, it just so happens the magical biddings were removed just over a month ago. When all that magic was freed the occamy must’ve finally been able to locate Julian “yes … lets go Julian. We’ll meet your new friend outside”
“you can’t do that! … can you?” Ron blinked a little stunned. His mother was the one in charge of everything so she wouldn’t allow this, but his father was clueless so he might. There’s no way he could talk to Hermione about finding a way to get back in the deal with the headmaster with a ghost hanging over his shoulder. Actually why wasn’t his mother here? Did his father really not tell her? It seemed unlikely since his father was a pathetic whipped dog. He has always bent over backwards to please their mother even working long hours at work to make more money though he insisted money wasn’t more important than family, but if so he had to tell her before this gets any worse so she could fix this mess. Once she knows his father won’t stand a chance …
As the two wizards left Harry kicked the bookshelf and Crookshanks went mad and started trying to claw Hermione’s face off. That was without a doubt the same cat from Ms. Figg’s and it still followed those signals. Bang on wood for a clawing fit was the squib’s favorite trick to teach. Sadly Ms. Figg never trains them to stop on command so there would be no stopping the cat until he tired himself out …
Dumbledore mentally screamed in a rage as all of the thousands of Hogwarts students, and a random jackal, raced into the Great Hall yelling about Harry Potter’s disappearance “SILENCE!” he yelled harsher than usual, but otherwise remained in control. As every student fell silent he prepared his speech “there are several things to discuss right now, but since you all are so worried we will start with the issue of Harry Potter who is safe. In fact he was on the train for a moment and you may see him throughout the year. Harry Potter was secretly adopted and his name was changed. This boy Julian River White is Harry Potter” Dumbledore said and as he saw all the stunned faces he wondered he could use Harry Potter’s fame to coax the boy into his reach. Either way he will get what he wants …
To his shock he saw an aisle filled with a huge assortment of glass objects including flasks, vials, test tubes and eyedroppers …
The dark creatures glanced at each other in silence until Greyback sighed “it still goes without saying that we keep the fact that those five fools are still alive quiet. They will understand why no one should hurt a child and their last lesson will be at the full moon”
"Slow increase in unpredictability, mental decline, drastic physical changes … His soul was broken wasn't it." Lucius snapped, tossing the book to the floor as his anger rose, "That book said there's a treatment. He's alive-"
Harry sighed as he pulled out his bottomless green bag filled with some extra healing potions that he keeps in his pocket for emergencies “clearly tackling would not have gone well”
Cache saw it. A flicker of sadness and fear going across those brown eyes. Perhaps she realized she didn't actually have a friend to stay by her side. Maybe Ron, but really they were two people hired to do tasks for the same goals not friends. "If Hermione will allow it I will stay." He said and smiled at the young witch.
“I will, I promise” Severus said firmly and hugged Julian before flooing away with the orb hidden in his pocket. In no time at all he appeared in the Malfoy Manor.
Fluttering of the tracker tickled his palm as he held the carrier close to it and pressed them together. His heart was ramming in his chest as he held the carrier against the disembodied charm praying that this will work. Finally after holding it for nearly three times longer than his test he dared to let go and got his wand …
Cache smiled and crouched to scratch them behind their fluffy ears “I always thought they were special” he said and noticed that Lockhart looked very put out at being upstaged by kneazles.
“the death of Myrtle must be when his soul shattered for the first time because the teachers noticed him turning to the dark arts after that. Perhaps he blamed himself” Severus commented and began skimming the rest of the information, but his eyes narrowed as he found some information was missing and almost too much in one area that had nothing to do with the child “how very odd … I can’t find anything on his guardians or where he was staying, but there’s a lot on the Gaunt family … no one was staying with them so why is there so much here? Even if he was related to them there’d only be enough to show he was living with them, which he wasn’t”
Blaise laughed from across the table. Draco glared at him, which Blaise ignored. He kept his voice low, though. “Less competition for you with Potter if the girl-weasel is out of the way, huh Draco?”
Pansy hopped off and they left, Blaise trailing discreetly behind them.
Draco’s voice croaked out, “It’s not a habit. I won’t let it become one. I’m working hard, I promise.”
doing here? Hiding?”
Blaise wolf whistled. “Bet you liked that.”
A loud throat clearing came from across the room.
The only thing that stopped him from worrying over the state of affairs recently was his new penpal. It turned out that Chang
This year was also the year he was up for consideration for a prefect’s badge. He grimaced at his book at the thought of what his father would say if he didn’t get it. He was worried Zabini, as the only one of the three real male candidates whose father wasn’t a death eater, might get it. He wasn’t even considering Vincent or Greg.
There was a sudden quiet, during which Vincent and Greg finally appeared from wherever they had been to stand behind Draco and crack their knuckles. Draco appreciated their timing.
Once Draco was ensconced in his bed again down in the dungeons, he could no longer put off his desire to write to Lovegood about the thestrals.
Draco swallowed hard and gently shook Pansy’s hand off. “Probably. But someone should keep an eye out.”
Draco threw his arm out to keep Pansy from finishing her scathing reply and took in Zabini’s features. They seemed too carefully constructed for someone with the upper hand.
Harry’s voice sounded pained, abruptly distracting Draco from his panic.
Even Finnigan’s voice had lost it’s bravado. “You mean…. You-Know-Who really…”
Because Potter always looked ready to fly off the handle, Draco contributed only a minimal effort to maintain their rivalry. Give a detention there, take some points here, just the usual things to be expected from his new position really. The other Slytherin prefects didn’t care much that he’d been slacking a bit when it came to watching the first years, as usually the seventh year prefects liked doing this to increase their final bit of influence; also, that first week when nobody wanted it Draco had volunteered for patrol every night. And half those patrols approached Gryffindor tower.
Draco clenched his jaw and barely kept from flinching when it aggravated the bruise on his jaw. The last thing he wanted to do was rehash his recent mistakes. “It doesn’t matter. I merely told them some hard truths and they attacked me. What happened after I passed out?”
The Ministry employed more people than any other single establishment. Getting the children of these employees on one side was no small victory. Potter would find himself outnumbered, no matter how unpopular Umbridge seemed right then.
He paced up and down the corridor outside for ages, wishing that he could hear what Potter and the others were doing. His only interruption came from Mrs. Norris, who scampered off when Draco showed her his prefect badge and told her he was on patrol. There was something weird about that cat, but Draco knew enough about magic to know better than to look into it.
“Got to make them perfect. That’ll show Potter. Can’t wait to spread them around. It will be sure to get Potter’s attention. See him ignore me now!”’
Pansy spoke up from his shoulder. “If we’re to be in the business of hurting Weasleys, we should do something about those awful twins. I heard through the other prefects that they’re advertising for people to test some new inventions of theirs. Mostly first years.”
Pansy’s voice was surprisingly gentle when she cut through Draco’s thoughts. “We can talk about that later. We need an excuse for Draco’s leaving the Great Hall earlier. Then we need to get him to bed. You’re not looking too good, darling.“
Draco gulped at the sheer scope. “So it could be anybody.”
to go behind his back and pave the way toward Umbridge being in charge of all punishments.
Pansy was a little meaner, but nothing terrible, and she shot Draco a look of apology after.
Draco cleared his throat. “Luna said that Granger made them sign a cursed parchment that would make it so everyone would know who had told Umbridge. But all the members were accounted for and blemish free after the incident. So it can’t have been a member of Potter’s group.”
Draco felt sheer emotion press against the backs of his eyes at her answer. He made himself turn away to look at Blaise. “Did you tell anyone about Potter’s group, Blaise?”
Pansy scoffed. Draco had almost forgotten she was there. “Men are cows, honestly.” She put a consoling hand on Blaise’s shoulder and Draco raised an eyebrow.
His father was actually at dinner that night.
Luna’s eyes looked liquid in the dark. She stopped walking to face him. Draco swallowed heavily. “You shouldn’t wish away parts of yourself, Draco, things get better when you embrace all parts of yourself. I love even the parts of me that miss my mom terribly. Besides, if you weren’t who you are right now, we might not be friends.”
Draco’s eyes watered against his will and he turned further away. His voice was thick when he answered her. “Not when it’s us. When it’s me.”
Draco would rather swallow his own tongue. Pansy was always the more brash of them anyways. It was her that ended up asking. “What’s the truth about your mother, Blaise?”
But sitting on his bed in his dorm that night Draco couldn’t get the sight of his dead body out of his mind. He’d never seen a dead body before.
Blaise shrugged Draco’s hand off his shoulder, but didn’t shy away when Draco started tentatively running his hand through his hair again. His voice was serious and determined, if not a bit angry, when he demanded. “Ask me then. Ask me about my mother. It’s the only thing people really wonder about me. I’ve never told anyone the proper truth about it. You’d be the only ones. Ask.”
His father was rarely even home. When he did see him his father seemed to stand taller than he ever had before. Pride in himself seemed to radiate outward from his body.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I suppose becoming my friend was an investment in case it did get out.”
Chang was the last to walk away, and even then she shot a nasty look over her shoulder. Draco sneered at her and flipped her two fingers. She scoffed but hurried to catch up with their other friends.
When he entered the Three Broomsticks that Saturday his hands had already been trembling for an hour. Pansy somehow noticed, despite his best efforts, grabbing his hand and hanging on. Blaise shot him a smile and a wink while they looked for a table.
of flaws. We just need to find this Weasel’s.”
He made sure to make eye contact with his mother when he brought up his next question. “Are we sure it wasn’t one of father’s… other, associates?”
He wanted to snap at her, but thought it might be better to ignore her, and looked out the window instead. He didn’t feel like fighting with a stranger all the way to the train.
Draco turned away to glare at the floor. “I’m just trying to make up for something that was my fault in the first place.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
him.” Potter didn’t want his help anyway.
Pansy giggled in a cutesy manner that disgusted Draco. He’d never heard Pansy do that before. It was revolting. She leaned even closer to his ear and held her hand up in front of her mouth as he had, whispering back. “First of all it's for
Dear Draco,
Severus’s lips thinned and his eyes hardened. “You must be, Draco. Or at least fast approaching there. I’ll help you any way I can, but you must be sure about everything you do now. Every action has a consequence, and in war, those consequences are extreme. Things you will have to live with.”
Blaise gave him a hard look. Draco looked at where he was rubbing his sore arm so he would have an excuse to look away.
Potter startled away from Draco, who pushed past him and through the tapestry.
If anyone has any questions or would just like to chat my tumblr is vicecaptain-atomicthirst
Luna visibly brightened. Draco felt warmed by the sight. “Because he can’t perform extraordinary feats. But he does have lots of money and thinks rather a lot of his family. Maybe they could perform feats.”
He couldn’t believe it. Potter had-
Draco read it through once. Then again. Then he stared at the sign-off his mother had given.
Thank you ever so much for your letter! I don’t mind speaking like this, but it’s a little slow and I thought maybe getting strange letters regularly might be a bit suspicious. So I’ve charmed a couple of notebooks so we can talk to each other instantly through them! I wouldn’t want our letters to be stolen by an Umgubular Slashkilter! (The Ministry is rumored to have several) But I only write my friends you see.
… Did you like my lyrics Potter?”
Pansy groaned and Draco looked up, smiling. His smile fell away when he met the eyes of Blaise Zabini just down the table from them. Zabini smirked at him and gave him a two finger salute before going back to his breakfast.
Zabini’s eyebrows lowered. When he spoke his voice was measured. “So I see. Why don’t you like her?”
Blaise…. Well. He shouldn’t trust Blaise really, he supposed. But Blaise was hard not to trust. When he’d been open to them about his affair right away, despite them hardly being friends yet. The way he sometimes gave off the impression that he just wanted to be included. The way he looked at him and Pansy like they were Salazar’s own gift to him when they paid him any attention. It was hard to fake that. Hell, Draco had traded his friendship with Nott for Blaise.
The girl smiled back brightly. “Will you tell me next year? I’d love to talk with you more.”
Draco snapped at her. “Then leave! And see that you don’t.”
Milli was pleasant enough company in any case. Once she’d seen Draco’s template, she was a crack hand, making the work go fast and not needing any real help from Draco. She didn’t talk much. Draco thought she might be nervous to be working with just him, so he persuaded her to tell him some anecdotes about Pansy and some of the other Slytherin girls.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Potter sat up and rubbed the back of his head  absentmindedly, his eyes not leaving Draco’s, his voice sounded rough. “You do care. For some reason. What the hell Malfoy?”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once again big thanks to FerchKalvaNiibi for betaing for me!
Draco wasn’t sure he’d get that choice. But he knew he could do seldom but remember now.
Umbridge didn’t look away from Draco’s eyes. Her voice was carefully pleasant when she spoke. “I’m not sure I understand your meaning.”
They practically fell onto a couch in the back of the common room under the biggest window to the lake. Blaise cast some muffling charms around the couch with a detached air. Pansy was clinging to Draco’s arm.
Draco frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco swallowed. “Things are looking up for my family aren’t they?”
Lovegood,
Potter had made things a hundred times worse for himself getting detention on the very first day by out-and-out
Draco didn’t have any inspected classes that day, but Potter obviously had. News had reached him of Potter’s new week of detentions by dinner time.
Draco watched the moment when Blaise’s expression went from concealed anxiety to determination. He didn’t even respond before he was following Pansy in dripping three drops on his own tongue.
Nott didn’t seem bothered in the slightest. He just grinned even wider. “So you know that Zabini was caught snogging a bloke over the summer? Didn’t know you were looking to be friends with poofs.”
Blaise dropped his hands. “What do you get out of your little arrangement anyway Pansy? I can see what he gets, but you’re not like us, are you?”
He heard Greg and Vincent both scramble up to follow him and had to suppress an annoyed sigh. He couldn’t wait to get home if only so he could have some space to think.
Oh if Potter wanted to fight someone, Draco was more than willing to volunteer!
Pansy just shoved his shoulder. “Get up. Come on. Your calming draught is obviously wearing off. You’re going to fall asleep as soon as it leaves your system, you know. I suppose if you want to sleep here, though, I don’t care.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
People were leaving the meeting again when Luna wrote a new message.
Pansy had been his first kiss. Outside the Slytherin common room entrance after the Yule Ball. He’d noticed the press of lips and her tacky lipstick; he’d felt a vague dislike, as if he was kissing distant family. Kind of gross. Hristo had pulled him under the stands after the second task and it was much different. His stubble had scratched at Draco’s cheeks and his tongue was hot in his mouth even as the wind around them blew cold and Draco’s anger at Potter for risking his life for a stranger warmed his core.
I just wanted to be there for him and I couldn’t. I couldn’t! And I couldn’t be there for him when I found him in a corridor bleeding! Hiding from his friends! Not trusting Dumbledore to help him!”
Greg kicked his foot against the flagstones. “Besides, we told each other we were going to do our best without your help this year. What with… stuff going on, we knew you’d be busy. And it’s O.W.L. year besides.”
Like that would ever happen.
Hagrid's back and we find out what Draco wants.
Lucius smiled so his teeth showed. “Yes, I do know her. A Dolores Umbridge. We’ve worked together quite a bit over the summer.” Lucius turned a sharp look onto Draco. “I expect you to honor that friendship and work hard in her class. If you follow her direction you should have a rewarding year. I don’t want to hear of you going against her, Draco.”
Draco swallowed nervously. “You need to tell someone about what she’s doing. I don’t care who, Dumbledore, McGonagall. Fudge. But you have to tell someone.”
He’d been
Draco practically fell over himself when a Hogwarts owl flew into the library the next morning.
That’s when Draco made a mistake. He’d never been quite that close to Potter before, he could hardly help when his eyes drifted down to Potter’s mouth. It made the whole situation feel different and Draco panicked. He was quick to look back at Potter’s eyes, but they’d widened in a kind of realization.
Still, hearing Pansy talk about how her father’s empty body had been sent home to her mother once they were done with it, how as long as Pansy remembered he’d been hooked up to magical instruments that helped keep him alive, but his eye open and blank in a back room of their manor, filled him with a horror he had trouble naming.
It seemed he’d also gained a fast friend in Blaise, who now accompanied he and Pansy almost everywhere, with Greg and Vincent sometimes trailing behind. It made something in Draco light up at the thought, he’d never really made a friend of his own volition before, and his last attempt, Potter, had gone miserably. All his other friends, Pansy, Greg, Vincent, he’d known since before Hogwarts and often shared tutors with while he was growing up. Blaise was a new element.
He glared at her with his eyes still blurry.
Draco focused on his plate to avoid Pansy’s direct eye contact. His voice came out quieter than it had been previously. “You know why Pansy. Besides it’s good to keep one’s options open in case of emergency. An escape plan, if you will.”
Draco was so distracted by Pansy that he didn’t see Blaise coming when he punched him in the upper arm. “Hey! What exactly was that for?”
Draco turned and glared at Blaise. “Where’s Pansy? She wouldn’t slander me so.” Draco paused, noticing for the first time the direction they’d been walking. “And for that matter, why are we going the long way to the Great Hall?”
Pansy let out an audible gasp, her mouth open in shock, one of her hands raising to cover it. Blaise’s butter knife hit the table with a clatter. Draco dragged his hands down his face as hard as he could, not wanting to see Blaise’s face. He shouldn’t have said that. He shouldn’t have said that. There was no way they wouldn’t ask questions.
Draco’s eyebrows flew up in surprise as he looked at Blaise. He might have expected Pansy to stay -- to help or to yell at him for scaring her -- but Blaise had startled him. Blaise didn’t meet his eye, looking over at Snape in determination. Draco smiled, a warm feeling spreading through his chest replacing the earlier cold pain.
Draco bit his lip and read it over several times. He completely rewrote it twice. He hadn’t made a new… friend he supposed, in years, and wasn’t sure how to talk to anyone he hadn’t been talking to for forever already, much less someone he had only had the one conversation with and had to break the news to that he could never talk to them in person.
Pansy huffed and crossed her arms, but turned to look at Draco impatiently.
Draco was quick to excuse himself.
Draco saw he’d been right to panic when Pansy slammed a notice down on the table in front of him as soon as he sat down at breakfast. She didn’t say anything, only giving him a grim look.
Luna shook her head side to side slowly, her eyes wide. “Mmm, that’s what Zacharias Smith said. But Hermione told us that she cursed the parchment she’d had us sign at the Three Broomsticks so that if one of us told Umbridge it would be obvious.”
Draco’s smile eased as they left the classroom and walked toward the stairs to the fifth floor. Looking down at Luna something prickled the back of his mind. “You know, now that we’re face-to-face again, I can’t help but notice that we have quite similar coloring. I don’t think I’ve seen a non-Malfoy with hair as blonde as me before.”
Draco’s voice was genuinely cracking now, tears rolling down his face. “I had no idea that my biggest regret would be giving him reason to reject my friendship. But it’s too late for a do-over. I don’t live in a world where I can walk around without a mask like he can. He has his role and I have mine, but fuck, sometimes I see him with his friends and all I can feel is this
The little boy pouted as he was handed a potion. It was the nice potion that made him calm down, but it still tasted bad. Despite the taste Julian drank each one and happily ate the little pizzas as Mickey sat on the seat next to him with a wagging tail. After the three had a nice lunch they got ready to go.
“you are a Slytherin” Severus muttered as relieved Poppy walked way to prepare the potions Severus gave her the night before.
Draco paled, "Someone seriously triggered them."
“that’s all well and good, but I intend to kidnap them if necessary … I’ll show Lucius exactly where my loyalties lie and it is most definitely not with Dumbledore. Now I won’t tell them about Tom until we have all the pieces of his soul, but when I’m sure they’re trustworthy maybe they can be told about Harry Potter. Of course that will only happen if you want it to Julian, ok?” Severus promised and when his godson nodded with that soft smile he went to the floo. This time he wasn’t going to change out of his loose fitting button down shirt and black slacks so the Malfoys will be in for a shock right away.
’ Julian hissed as he petted the soft feather like scales.
"Is there anything else you wish add to his charges? The added charges will do nothing at this point, but it will be good to get it all on record." Slashclaw said.
“it wasn’t as exciting as yours … well actually it was just not in a good way. Ron beat up his younger sister for being sorted into Slytherin. I had to heal her lip and now I need to write a quick letter to Mr. Weasley. Also now Fred, George and Ginny know who I am because of an enchanted map that shows everyone in the castle. There’s something I need to do at Gringotts too. Apparently as Ron was hurting his sister, Ginny, he mentioned her marrying me so maybe there was a transaction for that” Harry said as he grabbed some parchment to quickly write down a detailed letter. Ami, formally known as Hedwig, took the letter and fluttered away with only Mr. Weasley as the target. Harry didn’t want to send it to Mrs. Weasley given her connection to Dumbledore.
Out of habit Ron opened his mouth to say something insulting towards snakes, but stopped and thought about what that fact really meant, "So … Voldemort wasn't the heir to Slytherin? … what basilisk?!"
When Severus left Maria appeared next to him with a devious smile “that was an even more edited version than the one you told Harry the other week and that last part was a lie … you never lost control of your thirst. At least you told Harry the truth to a point … that your sister had red hair and that the father of your niece was a wizard who was killed by Daddy dearest” she smiled. Harry liked knowing the people he lived with and had asked several others how they were turned if they were open to it “he won’t just learn that the friend your sister stayed with was the Evans family, but he suspects something and that can be dangerous with a man like that”
Severus cleared his throat as if he was trying to keep from laughing “you might have an easier time talking to your son if you dropped the silencing charm” Lucius blushed in embarrassment and dropped the charm …
Draco groaned in mock exasperation, "When Severus hears that he'll get covered in tattoos." Draco said teasingly and they both laughed at the thought of seeing a Severus covered head to toe in tattoos. A peaceful silence passed for a few minutes as hey sipped on their warm chocolaty beverage, but it didn't stay that way. "Who are the Crippens? The Daily Prophet said the Crippens reported your safety to the muggle police, but why them? What are you planning?"
XXXXXXXXXX
Brian immediately kneeled next to the tiny bloodied child in rags laying motionless on the floor. The battered boy was maybe the size of a two year old and looked like a skeleton with blood caked black hair. Both of the child’s eyes were swollen shut and his right wrist was clearly broken. With great care Brian gently cradled the small child and pressed one finger against the delicate throat to check for a pulse. Much to his relief there was one, a weak pulse, but it was there. However it won’t be there for long if he didn’t hurry.
So basically another busy day …
Julian forced a smile “good thing that’s not what I meant” he said ignoring the ‘Harry Potter’ statement as he took Draco’s hand and wandlessly opened the window shocking the other students who couldn’t do wandless magic though they were each around 16-17 years old.
The minister nodded understandingly, "Yes, but there's no point in dwelling now that we can see all the pieces and do something about it without … interference." He said trying to remind Arthur that the fault was not his own, but in the potions they were slipped. "What?" Cornelius blinked at the looks he was getting from Lucius and Arthur.
Just after the professor left a tray with a vial floated into the room and Griphook handed Harry the potion after making sure it was the right one “you need to take this before the ritual. It will prevent damage to your soul as we remove it, but it takes 30 minutes for full effect so we will wait here until the ritual room is ready. A word of warning, the ritual is a safe procedure, but it is painful and you will feel groggy after”
? Really?"
With a wave of his wand and an incantation they got their answer when a gray glow was coming from Hedwig’s side just under the left wing. That snowy owl was not happy at all!
“good, sign here and initial here” the goblin watched as the wizard signed and took the completed documents a single piece of parchment appeared in his hand. Griphook laid the document out in front of them “you have completed the breaking of guardianship and adoption of one Harry James Potter for muggle world and this is the document to finish it through magical world. Simply place your finger on the spots. Mr. Dursley, if you please, point here and you will feel a pinch”
The headmaster was lead down a street lined on each side by muggle homes and made a beeline for the fourth house on Privet Drive. Startled momentarily by the presence of wards around the house he paused and slowed his approach. When the wards didn’t stop him he crept up to the window still in the form of a wolf.
Cache finished his sandwich as he pondered and swallowed before answering “I have wanted to try making counters to controlling potions such as loyalty potions and incorporating moonlight in a project- … that is something I should admit to if you are serious about teaching me” Severus nodded seriously “I wasn’t lying about being colorblind … but I am no longer that way now … it was incredibly stupid in hindsight, but I had no choice. I made a couple potions and do to a shortage of ingredients I prepared some things very differently. I needed these potions to work and I knew the risks, but I still drank one and put the other in my eyes. One nearly killed me and would’ve if I didn’t take a nutrition potion before hand, while the other added a bit of color in my rather lack luster vision. So if you don’t mind putting up with a maniac apprentice experimenting …”
Now that his hands he went to visit this new store … AbFab Emporium.
The squib opened her mouth to scream, but Armel clapped his hand over her mouth and disappeared with her …
Clearly it did …
"I'm speaking"
Blaise raised an eyebrow as he walked out of his room and saw Draco already near the door and leaving “hey hold up! Are you leaving without me?” Blaise asked and pouted as Draco looked at him with a look that clearly meant the Malfoy only just realized he was there … he did indeed forget him.
“once I managed to find the name Tom Marvolo Riddle in the Hogwarts records it was simple to track them down though … it’s really odd behavior. I think Tom understood that something was wrong and began taking measures to protect the diary, but the two horcruxes I found today weren’t protected at all. Both the Slytherin locket and the Gaunt ring were just laying on the floor of the Gaunt Shack” Severus said as he shook some dust off his sleeve that got on him when he searched the dilapidated shack “Tom’s mind must’ve been suffering from severe memory problems”
“Ok! Ok!” Harry grabbed his box of potions and ran to the floo with his kneazles, but couldn’t resist saying one last thing “if you married him would you be my landlady?” Harry yelped and just barely managed to duck a hex before flooing away ”too close for comfort” he said as he, Lyra and Libra stepped into St. Mungo’s lobby.
“how … did I get here?” Quirrell muttered to dazed to even stutter.
“She must’ve done this when I was sleeping.” Remus said completely relieved at the discovery and read the directions thoroughly before gathering everything he will need to make a healthy breakfast for Sirius. Once it was ready he put the meal for Sirius on a platter and carried it upstairs.
"It's quite alright, Arthur. I'm interviewing a new professor. You have some business to take care of, yes? Ron will have a pass for whatever classes he misses. You shouldn't wait." Minerva said subtly telling him why a vampire was present and reminding him of the reason for the visit.
“Cache you have to promise to send a letter the second … your potions master, is made aware of certain things. I want to know that you survived” Neville said.
"I remember … the orphanage I grew up in … meeting Dumbledore." Tom looked hurt and tightened his grip on Julian's hand. The blonde with the tiny occamy in his hair never left his side even when he was dressing. It was comforting. "He said I was a wizard like him, but he just left me there with the muggles …" Tom trailed off sadly.
"Thanks. I'll try to get back quickly so can Lyra and Libra stay to help?" Cache asked and smiled aas his kneazles mewed.
Poor Neville was sitting next to Ron and Hermione inside the headmistress' office waiting for Cache to return. It was worth it for sure because he can get to see his parents at St. Mungo's while they're in the trial, but it still felt odd. They weren't being mean at all. In fact, they both seemed kind withdrawn. Still this was an awkward spot to be even with the two kneazles and Hermione's cat trying to brighten the mood …
(Damn … Draco’s more observant than I thought. My stomach wasn’t used to eating so rich greasy things just make me sick and I insisted on switching because I nearly mixed up the clothes in the Quidditch locker room where I nearly walked out with a green tie and didn’t want to make that mistake again. Thank Merlin Fred and George didn’t ask questions) Harry thought as he put his hands in the pockets “wow, sounds like you like calling yourself his friend more than being one”
“cheeky brat” Severus grumbled.
With the panel put back into place he started to climb down, but paused when he saw the painted word ‘FREAK’ “oooh … it’s red not black” he rolled his eyes and went to finish packing away everything that was left, but was struck by smell coming from his aunt and uncle’s bedroom. He went in and cringed. Apparently his kneazles decided that even though he risks letting them out in the backyard for the bathroom they prefer the silk sheets of the Dursleys’ bed as a litter box. He rolled his eyes and spelled the sheets clean before going back to packing …
The potion master nodded as he turned to his meal “indeed, please call me Severus. As you have displayed an excellent talent in brewing I would like to teach you. Can you tell me a bit about yourself?”
“it seems the castle is kicking you out” Silvia said with a smirk and they watched Remus drag Sirius, rather easily by the way, to the fireplace and flooed away.
"You're both bastards! Scabbers isn't- ..." Ron paused as the door Scabbers was thrown behind swung open and he started struggling hard to get to his pet.
“got? Familiars follow the bond to the wizard. You can’t buy a familiar. Tanzanite is magically bonded to Julian and has been since birth. Of course Tanzanite couldn’t find Julian until his magic was unsealed, but they’re together now and Tanzanite would only ever hurt those who hurt Julian” Brian explained politely though Minerva opened her mouth to argue some more as Tanzanite shrank and curled around Julian’s neck. Her argument was cut short by Dumbledore who started yelling at Silva and Sophia again.
His eyes weren’t getting worse … they were getting better!
I'm thinking)
"Ok, just tell me how I can help if you need it." Cache frowned as he watched the wizard smile gratefully and quickly leave. "That seemed odd."
The headmaster laughed “excellent … you know, we should set up a spot for him in your room and perhaps a place to perch”
“yes, but that didn’t seem to matter. Technically they never verified I was a Death Eater. I was locked up for a month due to mistakes. Afterwards Dumbledore came to get me and said I had to be ready to spy again someday … he all but threatened to send me back to prison every time I tried anything, but it was always in that passive aggressive way where you’re the one feeling guilty for not being his slave” Severus said unable to stop the scowl from coming to his face.
Minerva nodded “it seems Cache here handled everything quite well. Now Ms. Weasley would you please explain what happened”
“incredible. The dull constant pain is gone … it’s not a fast acting potion, but anything that helps is greatly appreciated” Lucius said as he watched his hand flex “your apprentice is something else Severus”
“you don’t mind?. … are you going to warn the headmaster?” Fred and George asked in perfect sync.
Cache grinned “she looks like a big weight has been taken off her shoulders”
It was turning out to be a fun challenge for everyone. Cache was asked to cut or pull apart the mystery ingredients and they all examined what they could from a safe distance. However when Ron came over to see the long black thing Hermione thought was a leech he decided to open his big mouth …
The goblin glance at Brian and Julian, who both nodded in approval, and snapped his fingers making two wills appear “the wills of Lily and James Potter”
“-in case you need it and some more regular nutrition-”
XXXXXXXXXX
However, somewhere around midnight Harry began to sweat profusely and thrashed restlessly in his sleep. The sweat soaked sheets were eventually kicked away, but the young wizard some how stayed asleep … good thing too …
“yes lets” Brian said as he smiled down at his son feeling proud of the fact that Julian handled that so well on his own.
"I understand. I'll summon some Aurors to keep the children out of the way." The Minister said and watched Jasmine hiss parseltongue into a snake like mark on a faucet. After the sinks moved revealing a tunnel that the team disappeared into Cornelius did as promised and brought a team in of his own. Of course, Dumbledore stepped in playing the ever loving Headmaster, but all of those reinforcements were no match for the curiosity of the hundreds of students. All the students tried to find various places to see the massive blindfolded snake being lead across the castle.
“ok then-” Draco blinked as the information processed “WHAT?” he snapped looking surprised and happy.
Red eyes looked at him in confusion “at your age you already have permission to make potions for a hospital and your living on your own. That’s takes talent and smarts. I want to help … I also never met someone who was as accepting as you, most people flee in fear”
Harry may not have liked one particular word used in Draco’s statement, but he did like the ugly snarl that appeared on Hermione’s face “oh Ms. Granger, you strike me as the type of person who takes books seriously” a flicker of pride came to the witch’s eyes “so seriously that if you read a book that claimed hypogriffs only flew south, but you saw one fly north you’re first thought would be that the planet flipped” Hermione’s face flushed with anger and Draco laughed at Cache’s comment “so I want to warn you that the books you chose contradict each other. Don’t hurt yourself” Cache said sounding like a concerned healer already and succeeded in further infuriating the witch.
Cache nodded and rolled up his left sleeve revealing several scars missing “yes. Light that was refracted through some diamonds. I checked each time. The potion heals the nerve damage. It’s amazing, but there are limits. I tried to put it on a paper cut. The cut didn’t heal any faster, but I can’t say for sure if it did nothing. I applied it to the rest of my scars so they should be gone tomorrow … Trocar refuses to let me to try drinking it. He took my quartz cauldron captive until I find another guinea pig” the blonde sulked and settled back in his seat to work on the rune sequence on he table.
A squeak escaped Harry’s lips as Brian gently turned him and pulled the back of his shirt up reveling the horrific assortment of scars. The sight made Sophia tear up a little. Both twins have helped children heal after they were saved, but it never got easier and this was one of the worst situations they have seen. A part of them wanted to go with Brian tomorrow to see the full extent of the abuse from the scans the goblins will run or at least to make sure Harry was alright, but they were strangers to him and didn’t want to overwhelm the boy. For now they will settle for healing the scars to make Harry more comfortable.
"They're gone?" Greg and Vincent sank to their knees in relief. "Thank Merlin."
“We didn’t have much of a chance to talk.” Remus sighed in exhaustion.
“what in Merlin’s name are you doing Lucius? Get that thing out of here and focus on your sick child” Narcissa snapped as the bat moved into the shadows to avoid being seen.
In the end Harry decided to force himself to calm down and continue to shop while trying to ignore the potions professor’s presence … just listen to the music …
Brian smiled and nodded “of course you can, but there’s still time. We don’t have to be at Gringotts until after lunch so there’s no rush”
“indeed” Severus smirked. Lucius flooed into his office a couple days ago and left with a vial with a memory from Draco of what Dumbledore said. The Malfoy said he needed it to confirm the story for a reporter friend. This friend does greatly dislike Dumbledore and would love to write the story that chips away at Dumbledore’s kind mask, but he didn’t want to get the backlash if this story turned out to be wrong so confirmation was needed thus the memory. As Lockhart came into the room Cache casually slipped the newspaper into the bottomless green bag in his pocket to pretend to listen.
Neville made a mental note about that interaction for later as Cache picked up the files “where can I find a music player like that?”
Draco looked a little sad that they might not be able to keep in touch as much as he’d like, but any signs of sadness were buried under the proper pure blood mask “we can still owl each other often and meet up over the summers … what school?”
(I'm thinking)
The headmaster left his office to find the Deputy headmistress “Minerva would you see me in my office. We need to discuss something” Dumbledore said and the transfiguration professor obediently followed him …
“now what’s this about a solution other than constantly brewing potions?” Severus asked almost impatiently, but immediately froze when the vampire vanished so fast he couldn’t even see a blur and reappeared unnerving close behind him.
Dumbledore gave the potions professor a concerned grandfatherly look “Severus is what the portraits saying true? You are going to get married? That is terribly unwise-”
“I see.” The Gringotts goblin in charge of the Prince vaults, Ironclaw, said before handing Minerva a copy of today’s newspaper.
“there’s Libra … that’s Lyra and now she won’t let you go ” Cache chuckled as Severus found just the right spot that got the kneazle purring to the point where she placed her paw on his wrist so he couldn’t leave and to complicate matters Libra was laying her head in the man’s lap waiting for a pet. Both of Severus’s hands were busy
Petunia scowled “another freak like you named Dumbledore. After my freak sister and her freakish husband were murdered by a freak named Voldemort, Dumbledore dropped the ungrateful waste of space on our doorstep with instructions to watch him with Ms. Figg and to treat him horribly, but not to kill or break him. I wanted to dump the freakish spawn at an orphanage, but the money we’re paid is really good and we have no trouble treating him like the freak he is. Besides the freak Dumbledore said just keep will protect us from the freaks who killed his parents … something about blood wards”
“it might make things difficult since I technically kidnaped him” he muttered without taking his eyes away from the child’s small form.
“I know this sounds bad, but I’m happy you didn’t help me then” Harry noticed a flicker of hurt in Severus’s eye before it disappeared “I was able to get away and knowing what we know now can you say this wouldn’t have been the better course?”
I’m thinking)
Ginny frowned “professor, Cache … there’s one other thing you need to know. Ron mentioned something about me marrying Harry” she said making sure to stick to those names as if Cache and Harry were two different people.
Harry opened the sewing kit and poked around the different buttons. Mere seconds later he pulled out a solid black button without any shine. A simple tap of his wand and incantation later he saw the creepy glow on his ankle.
… ‘Making your own lab starts out with the obvious fumes from potions that are emitted from every potion. Many potions have toxic fumes. A list of which is on page 43. The fumes can have many strange effects on the mind and can cause breathing problems. Ventilation charms are the best way to combat the fumes in a lab that is in doors.’ …
With that Poppy left to complete her task of removing the love potions and Draco went back to the dorms. Harry had to race back to his apartment with Trocar to get the color changing potion for his eyes and returned to help with the potion despite Trocar’s fussing. Unfortunately he knew he couldn’t ditch the entire day. It wasn’t even lunch yet and he’s supposed to help out so he returned …
Brian carried Julian to the pedestal and set him on since the boy was too small to hop up by himself. Once Brian sat down in the chair closest to the pedestal the runes Julian was sitting on started glowing “it’s ok Julian, the runes are only scanning you. It will be over in a minute. See, Mickey isn’t worried” the headmaster said softly when the boy whimpered fearfully despite the plush wolf cuddling with him.
"Ruby Gro." The casually dressed dark skinned woman with long gray hair said with smile, "I'm Sirius' mind healer obviously, but I came to talk to you."
Isaac blushed, "Oh … so that's why my mother was so insistent on me being careful since I might have potent … fluids."
“I’m faster than you, you know?” Trocar said with an irritated twitch in his eyebrow “speed isn’t the issue here. How do we get out of here? There aren’t any stairs and I can’t scale that pipe with Cache in my arms so any ideas would be helpful … he’s bleeding!” Trocar yelped as he smelled blood. After looking Cache over they spotted little trickles of blood seep out from under both eyelids. It was hard to say how damaged his eyes were, but it was clear that they had to get out of here.
A young boy in the next aisle over, perhaps 14 or 15 going by his height, wearing baggy muggle clothes and listening to a muggle music playing device. It was rare to find young people truly interested in potions nowadays … even rarer still someone brave enough to run around Daigon Alley in muggle garb. He watched and listened to the boy muttering to himself out loud …
The minister of magical Britain nodded and looked at Julian and Draco “I know, but there may be a solution … now neither of you have to agree. You both stop at Hogwarts, not as students, but as representatives of your own school. I’m suggesting pitting Legerdemain against Hogwarts to begin revealing the truth. Would you like to do this?”
“one word about this to anyone outside this room and it’s detention for every last one of you” the four students in perfect sync and Severus shot a glare at Trocar “that includes you” he snapped as he stepped out from behind the portrait.
“just put him on the couch” Harry said as Trocar and Frank followed him out of the floo and into his apartment with an unconscious wizard between them. They did as asked, but Frank made a point of dropping Severus’s legs rougher than needed “gently” Harry muttered as the werewolf plopped in the chair. Trocar at least didn’t drop the man’s head on the couch’s arm.
Draco huffed, but after a moment of sulking he sighed “he was raised by muggles”
The werewolf nodded quickly “I understand. I’ll make sure he-”
Harry's eyes narrowed, "No. Any potion fumes could affect the baby and since the baby is half vampire that means it will need to feed on your blood after it's done getting milk from you. You can't be tainted by fumes during the 9 months before the birth, 5 months or so for the milk duration and, at least, a year when you switch the baby to your blood-"
“the founders always kept copies of blueprints in the vaults so we know it’s in the first floor bathroom … before we leave …” Cache pulled a muggle newspaper out of the bag in his pocket and showed it to the potion master. The dark eyes widened as he read the article featuring the Dursleys.
Before sleep claimed him he went through a few things to do while he had this chance.
Stephen smiled as he sat down on the floor next to the small child “hello Julian. You wouldn’t remember me, but I met you when you were first brought to Australia”
XXXXXXXXXX
Severus watched in amusement as the headmaster limped to the Great Hall. On the way into the large dining hall he spotted Poppy taking her seat at the professors’ table “this will help you wake with a clear head when worn” he whispered in her ear s he slipped the second necklace to her without anyone seeing before he took his own seat at the table “that was much appreciated” he said with real relief when his apprentice sat down next to him.
“hey Nev!”
The potion master snorted “I became irritated with the subpar brewing equipment and the dunderheads wasting my time so I found better accommodations, which are apparently sunnier as well”
“yeah, but I couldn’t bring Mickey“ Julian pouted sadly at not being able to have the plush with him.
“Sirius you idiot” Remus hissed and quickly looked around praying no one saw that and reported it. That would destroy Sirius’s chances at seeing Julian, but thankfully everyone looked too busy with rat hunting to really notice the escape so he focused on his leg. It ws a very weak binding spell. Sirius must’ve been just strong enough to cast it wandlessly, but when Remus searched for his wand he paled … it was gone …
Cache sighed “there is a downside to being home schooled. I have my mentor in healing giving me things to practice, my potions mentor keeps me constantly busy and my mentor in everything else teaches me between those lessons. Of course it doesn’t help that I learned about being a wizard two weeks before being shipped off to a school run by idiots … doesn’t really much time to explore, but it made the decision to switch to homeschooling easy”
Harry took a deep breath calm down and whispered “Lumos”
’ Julian said calming the occamy down even though what Draco said did hurt his feelings “I’m sorry, but I’m not evil. My Daddy says so and that those people were just mean” he said firmly making Draco look at him in confusion. His Daddy always says he is not a freak or any different than anyone else and he believed him. Julian also remembered that his Daddy said that if someone does say anything like that to him he should remember that he’s loved and to not take what that person says seriously because it’s not true “would you like to play with Mickey?” he offered pointing to the happy wolf plush rolling on the ground at their feet.
Before he knew it he was dragged out of his cell by a sneering Petunia “get moving freak, you have to make breakfast and start your chores” she shoved him towards the kitchen and gave him a long list of chores “bacon, eggs, waffles and French toast” she ordered snappishly.
“indeed, it’s a shame a manipulative prick is in charge” Severus muttered as they walked the halls.
“you’re welcome Julian” Severus said as the child fell fast asleep in his father’s arms “that potion would take a lot out of anyone. He will be asleep for a few hours as his body adjusts” he said as he followed Aster and Brian out of the room and down the halls. The plush toy fell silent so as not to disturb the little boy.
“Well I suppose that’s one way to get a break.” Arthur said jokingly despite the seriousness of the situation.
The healer grinned as she handed the papers over to him, "I hope it's just as successful as this one!"
Of course Sasha released them after an hour or so for bathroom needs, but she was pleased to see that they avoided her for the rest of the trip. When the train came to a halt they stayed in their seats and waited for her to pass, which she did with a smug strut. However her very good mood was ruined when she started hearing what everyone was talking about, which was the now very obvious absence of the ‘Boy Who Lived’. With one person saying the word ‘kidnapped’ everything went out of control and unfortunately everyone had their luggage, which included quills, parchment and … that’s right, owls …
The sounds of all the goblins using special spells to blind and deafen the basilisk were all Severus could hear was his heart beating rapidly. He was in a heartbroken daze and it was so bad that he was vaguely aware of the team of goblins transporting the massive serpent away and ghost away. The temptation to seal his eyes shut was so very strong. He just didn’t want to see Harry laying lifeless on the ground …
Hagrid took the last bite of his dessert and chuckled “there’s a quick spell for that” he boomed.
“lucky you! I happen to prefer being on top so go ahead and bend over” Cache said jokingly, proving he spends too much time with Poppy, and successfully making Ron gape like a fish. The red head was shocked that his comment backfired and that the other students were snickering at him save for Hermione who seemed even more disturbed than before. At this point Blaise stopped snickering when he turned to glance at Draco and raised eyebrow as he noticed a blush gracing his best mate’s pale cheeks for a brief second before disappearing. Cache chuckled cheerily and leaned down to look straight in Ron’s eyes “behind you” he whispered.
“lacewing … leeches … snake fangs … porcupine quills … wicked! Dragon blood! That would help stabilize- … hmm or would salamander blood with beetle eyes be better?” Harry held the jar of dragon blood in his right hand, tapping it thoughtfully in time with the music.
“I’m happy to help. I better go before Severus hunts me down” Cache said amusedly, but he and his kneazles quickly walked away just in case Severus really was about to pounce. However not too far away he heard Blaise teasing Draco. Apparently Blaise didn’t realize how much the halls echoed otherwise he may have whispered the ’Draco you got a kiss from your love’ comment. As he finally caught up with Severus he saw the professor talking to Poppy “hey, what’s wrong?”
In short he was stuck, but the old grandfatherly wizard looked so apologetic that he thought nothing of it beyond a caring piece of advice. Now though … was there more to everything? Who could he trust?
Lucius raised a perfectly groomed eyebrow “what are you two talking about?”
What happened during the weeks since Dumbledore discovered that Harry was gone? well the answer lies in the for sale sign the vampires and werewolves used when abducting the Dursleys … it was a very real sale …
"Very good. That is the passkey in question and you can pick it up later at Gringotts. Moody, I'm sure, apologizes for using it to cork his flask. He didn't want to lose it." Slashclaw remarked not really interested in the subject. "Now, Ms. Granger, let's begin with you. What connects you to this wizard? Nothing you say will leave this room unless you reveal it."
After buttoning up his sleeve he moved his papers aside revealing a textbook on modern potions and did some studying of his own …
“you know they can go around as long as they don’t interfere with treatments and stress or hurt the patients” Poppy smiled as the kneazles antics made several children giggle
"Is he alive?" Lucius insisted, the feeling of panic welling up in his chest. However, before he could say anything further the textbook flew at hm hitting him in the gut knocking the wind out of him.
Afterwards Severus tried to leave, but Dumbledore had to get the last word in. He ignored the threat and flooed to his own home where he saw Silvia and Sophia waiting for him. Technically the schools had different vacation start times. Legerdemain won’t be on break for another few weeks.
The headmaster of Legerdemain handed Severus a pamphlet as he took Julian into his arms “this explains the classes and main points of our school as well as the times to visit if they wish to come on their own”
"I'm speaking"
Hermione scoffed “whatever, let go Ron. We have to find Harry” she said actually sounding annoyed with the task of finding her ‘friend’ over her cat.
“What’s wrong?” Severus asked quietly when he noticed Sanguini stiffen.
’ Tanzanite hissed as he landed on Julian’s head.
"Actually?" Harry gripped his chest in mock hurt. "I have a good idea once in awhile, you know?"
"Now slow down you guys. There's more than enough time to explore." He said with a chuckle. The sound of glass clinking in the new potion room downstairs caught his attention and he went down there to check it out. That's where he found a heavily pregnant Draco carrying a heavy box of things to put on the shelves. "You shouldn't be moving things, Draco!"
Harry stopped and looked at the man sitting next to a wheel that had ten colors. It must’ve been some advertisement for the new store opening “yeah sure” he smiled as he adjusted his grip on his bags.
’ Tanzanite hissed ready to grab this guy for his human.
“ok, but be careful-oh … I wonder if Julian got his report card” Narcissa pondered. It was a puzzling question since Julian and his father were wandering around Africa right now.
In a sudden urge to argue Severus turned to the vampire mentor, but his anger died the second he spotted the bruises on Harry’s arm start to fade … the bruises he caused “I’m sorry … this entire situation is …”
“oh dear, she going to traumatize them” Lucius groaned, but seemed to be a bit pleased with the situation “these books you mentioned need permission in order to be written so I will take care of starting a lawsuit if you both want” Lucius offered.
Either way if this was all that was his then it was best to get rid of them. Make as clean a slate as possible and remove all the bad reminders. He threw the items away and disposed of them before Harry would ever know they were there …
Maria quickly became eerily serious ”just checking. We’re here to discuss Harry James Potter” suddenly several people appeared out of nowhere surrounding the now scared Dursleys “consider us social services”
Now Harry tried to apply magic to the water instead and this time a powerful whirlpool appeared. This is how he will defend his mind. Of course he had to keep meditating to make it stronger, but he got the first step down.
The fact that the boy had interrupted his fantasy about a certain Malfoy omega and carried said omega’s scent probably didn’t help his control any. Snarling in the face of the little upstart he watched as the boys ran off in fear before turning his attention to the way they had come.
nights. His hand came away covered in blood. He had been clawing at his face due to the nightmares again. Not wanting to bother Madam Pomphrey again Harry tried to clean himself up in the bathroom wincing slightly knowing he would have to go to Pomphrey before classes tomorrow. This was becoming a common occurrence.
“Put him down on the sofa; I do hope you didn’t just let them wander off. This is a serious breach of etiquette. Omega’s are off-limits unless they are participating on the wall, or the Alpha has a claim to the Omega. Seeing as I have not been informed of any change in Mister Malfoy’s status, I am led to believe this was an unsanctioned attack on Lord Malfoy’s Property.”
“He dropped hard; I don’t think he even realizes it’s me,” Harry said softly his attention returning back to Severus once Malfoy had calmed down. “Actually, I’m pretty positive he doesn’t realize it’s me or he would be more likely to bite my hand than nuzzle into it,” he said with a laugh.
“Why” the soft, timid voice caused Harry to pause as he sighed. Seriously what was with him today. He should not be wanting to turn around and comfort the brat. This was the same boy who had made his school years hell! He should be indifferent at the very least if not vindictive and reminding him of everything he deserved. But while he enjoyed degrading the omega, he had fantasized was Malfoy the previous night, the omega just looked so broken he couldn’t bring himself to insult him.
Harry couldn’t have focused on the Professor if his life depended on it. Thankfully the chances of that being the case had lowered drastically with the defeat of Voldemort and the ministry cracking down on those who had aligned themselves with the Dark Tosser. Unfortunately, even with Hermione trying to drag his attention back to the class, it just was not something that he was interested in. Seriously after the war did it really surprise anyone that he was bored out of his mind in Defense Against the Dark Arts? There wasn’t a single spell on the curriculum for this class that he hadn’t already learned and performed under much more dangerous situations than a classroom.
“There might just be hope for you yet Potter.”
“Look, I will be the first to admit I enjoy tormenting omega sexually, hell we all do. But what they did to you was wrong. They have no right to your body, your not theirs” he said a snarl slipping his control as he thought of any of those pathetic alpha’s owning the omega. The thought alone caused him to frown, something he was not going to dwell on. What did he care if Malfoy belonged to someone else? Another Alpha getting to see those tear-filled silver eyes as they worked him over until he was begging, for mercy or for his alpha to continue though neither would know. Another Alpha turning that beautiful pale skin scarlet, making it flush under his hand, his paddle, his cane. FUCK! His nostrils flared as he visibly fought down the arousal that sprung up at the thought of Draco thoroughly debauched while also countering the anger at the thought of another touching him.
“Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”
Pansy closed her eyes and rubbed at the bridge of her nose. “And why do I have to be involved in this?”
Blaise tried to get up, probably wanting to run away, but Draco clung to his shoulder until he laid back down. Blaise’s voice was tense. “Would knowing one of my secrets really make you feel better?”
It took a minute for the potion to take effect, but when it did Draco felt every muscle in his body untense. Once he could breathe again, he looked around the room. Uncle Severus's office. Pansy knelt next to him, with a hand on his back, Blaise stood across the room looking at him. Both appeared pale and worried. Draco couldn’t maintain eye contact, so he looked at Uncle Severus instead.
The girl’s smile didn’t dim. She just held out her hand. “I’m Luna Lovegood. I’m a third year Ravenclaw.”
Pansy was quick to regain his attention. “We know you’ve been avoiding us, and we have a good idea why. The question, Draco, is how in Salazar’s name you think we could have betrayed you!”
Potter practically snarled at him. “I’m not going to tell anyone, Malfoy, and if you do I’ll hex you into next week! Or better, I’ll tell everyone you
Draco and Finnigan glared at each other for what felt like ages, waiting for the other to make a move. Finally Finnigan practically growled before turning and stomping away toward the Gryffindor common room.
He liked to pretend that the three of them were operating on Slytherin’s mutual destruction code, but the truth was that he
She and her whole group stopped and turned to stare at Draco. Only Edgecombe’s face lit up with recognition, quickly followed by fear. He was surprised her voice didn’t shake. “What do you want? I need to get to Divination.”
Montague shrugged, unrepentant. “Flint didn’t want you involved in anything. We thought you’d be too easily recognizable anyway, with Potter on the team.”
“Shut up, you great idiot.” Pansy poked Draco hard just under his shoulder blade and then left her hand there. “It was a good plan. We wouldn’t have let you do it if it wasn’t. There wasn’t any other way really. Better now than later when she would know even more.”
to stay out so late on patrol. It’s all Draco’s fault! I look like someone’s boggart.”
Draco looked down his nose at them and put on his most haughty tone of voice. “Well. Thank you for checking on me, but you’d be more useful gathering some actually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. You don’t want that kind of reputation Edgecombe. You wouldn’t last five minutes with that over you.”
Draco dropped his arm and shrugged casually. “He may have. I’m not my father.”
Pansy’s voice was a bit awed. “She really is a black widow then?”
There was only one carriage left when Draco reached them. He thought it was empty when he got in, but he was quickly joined by a younger blonde girl. She got in opposite him and stared at him with huge grey eyes.
Draco smiled for the first time. “No I wasn’t! That means whether I see them or not next year will give some good insight!”
Draco met Uncle Severus’s eyes. “I am thankful, sir.”
Breakfast the next morning an owl with a note and a package managed to pierce through Draco’s angry fog. Draco was surprised but pleased to see that it was from Luna.
that close, and he’d been prepared to believe anything Potter said just seeing his face after the maze.
Now it was Blaise’s turn to roll his eyes. “I have been hanging out with you and Pansy for almost two weeks now, not to mention I
When he moved into the dorms, he’d had to find better methods. He paid an older student to cast silencing charms on his bed curtains, he’d had an elf send him a package of calming draught once a month. Then he buried himself in Occlumency lessons. He learned to brew his own calming draughts. He silenced his own curtains. Last year he’d mastered the glamours he used to hide the bruises under his eyes.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
this is only a rumor, Edgecombe. If I find out you're working against Umbridge…”
He couldn’t see Potter, who was blocked by said pillar, so Draco stepped gingerly to the side, to see without Potter becoming aware of him. He was dabbing at his left hand with his right sleeve and wincing. Draco saw a dribble of blood slide off his hand and down to the floor.
Potter didn’t seem to take his eyes off Draco once the whole class. Draco couldn’t tell what he was thinking, but it wasn’t about Umbridge for once. He thought he was going to go mad.
What he heard made Draco bite his lip and his hands shake. His father seemed to be trying to bribe half the Ministry in a strangely single-minded attempt to obtain an object from them. The longer the summer went on the more desperate he seemed to become.
Watching the trio when he could seemed to tell him that his two accomplices didn’t know what had gotten into him either. It made Draco paranoid.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco tapped the door frame twice in agitated indecision before giving it up and walking in. If Finnigan was heading back to his common room, Draco wouldn’t see anything useful, and if he swanned off now he’d miss Luna entirely.
He almost wished he could tell them about his correspondence with Luna. But every time he thought of it he remembered Pansy’s face, last year, when he’d gotten out of the carriage with Luna.
Draco did want to hurt Potter. To make his friends grow buck teeth until Potter’s eyes filled with rage and panic, to make Potter look as foolish as he really was by luring him out in the middle of the night, to put Potter in his place and show him just how much better Draco himself was. To get his hands on Potter and push him around. To make Potter do things for Draco.
Draco recognized Finnigan before Finnigan had recovered. He quickly fixed his expression into something more condescending and less alarmed. Draco was haughtily fixing his robes when Finnigan turned over and jumped to his feet.
The news washed over Draco like an icy wave. He couldn’t believe Potter could be so
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco glared coldly back at Theo. He hadn’t really noticed, being so wrapped up in Potter’s nonsense, but looking back he
Blaise startled a bit, but he held out his hand with Draco’s letter balled up in his fist. Draco raised an eyebrow at the state of it; Blaise scowled. “It was bloody hard to even keep hold of the thing with you thrashing around. Be thankful I saved it at all you barmy arsehole.”
Potter was still following him. Nott always seemed to be around, with a book in his hands like he thought he was so sneaky. His mother sent him her first letter of the year; he sensed she was worried about him. He’d had to give most of the chocolates she’d sent with it to Greg and Vincent to keep even them from questioning him.
And then Pansy was arranging them to her liking. Moving over and ordering Draco to lay down, then pushing Blaise until he’d both uncovered his face, and laid down with his head on Draco’s stomach so Draco could indeed run a hand through Blaise’s short stubble of hair while Blaise blushed hard enough that Draco could see red through his dark complexion and his lower legs hung off the side of the bed. Pansy laid her own head on Blaise’s stomach and her legs over Draco’s shins. Draco noticed that Blaise didn’t need Pansy to demand he play with her hair in turn, but had simply started doing it of his own accord.
Pansy’s voice cracked toward the end and Draco’s eyes widened in surprise. He uncrossed his arms in concern when Pansy had to look away from him to compose herself. He’d been a second away from touching her knee in comfort when she turned back around, her glare as hard as ever and her eyes sparkling with unshed tears. Draco flinched back.
Pansy snorted. “Oh, it’s going to. But we’ll have each other anyway. That’s the best we can hope for.”
Blaise smiled, before clearing his throat in an effort to stop. “I had an idea for a cover story. I figured we could spread a rumor that someone tried to dose you with Veritaserum, but it was badly made and you had a reaction.”
The one teacher Draco may have wanted to talk to was gone before he’d even come down to breakfast the day after despite this. The only person he might have trusted to talk about his feelings with, giving Draco a sour feeling. He could think of very few reasons why Professor Snape, his Uncle Severus, would leave now of all times.
Draco was finally able to get some sleep that night, his efforts towards taking down three of the Weasleys calming his anger enough that he could forget it for just a moment.
Pomfrey handed him the pajamas and closed the privacy screens. “Let me know if you need help, or if something hurts when you move around.”
Luna stepped away and beamed at him again. “‘I’ve found it’s always good manners to ask, at least the first few times. Some people don’t like hugs. I’m glad you do though. You seem like someone who needs one.”
Edgecombe took another step back, prompting Draco’s company to perk up and Vincent and Greg to take a step forward. Edgecombe stopped in her tracks. “I’m- I’m not, I swear!”
Draco bit his lip hard, but didn’t hesitate to write back.
It was indeed Potter. He looked almost as surprised as Draco felt. Draco felt an insane urge to stroke a finger down one of Potter’s raised eyebrows, maybe the one under his scar. He shoved it in the box where he kept all his other strange Potter fantasies and straightened out his robes.
Draco’s face morphed into a look of disgust, and then panic as he remembered Blaise was
with a professor!
Umbridge gave a tight-lipped smile. “Well, as the Hogwarts High Inquisitor I must not take sides in Quidditch. But I do try to give the most
He felt someone’s eyes on him and turned straight toward the Gryffindor table, only to see Potter turning away from him back toward Dumbledore. He hadn’t felt those eyes on him in over a week, and the change sent a shock through his system. He kept his eyes on Potter all through Dumbledore praising him, but it wasn’t until the toast that Potter finally looked back. And there was the fire that Draco craved, that he could feel all the way across the room; as he ignored his goblet to keep eye contact, he barely noticed that all the Slytherins around him had also kept seated for the toast in solidarity.
After a second Pansy sighed and sat on the edge of his bed. “Hooch blew Potter and Weasley off you and sent them off to McGonagall. Vince was too busy busting a lung laughing that he was no help. Hooch and Snape got you up to the hospital wing. You look better already, you had blood all over your face and a broken nose. It was awful Draco! Snape took Vince off to his office after he was sure you were okay. We haven’t seen him since.”
Pansy roughly pushed the homework he’d had scattered over his bed, a push that sent them falling over the other end with a thump that made Draco wince. Then she pushed Blaise a bit until he took the hint and crawled to the other side of Draco’s bed. Pansy pulled Draco’s curtains closed and cast hurried, but powerful feeling, silencing and locking charms. Then she planted herself right in front of Draco with her arms crossed.
Draco choked, but nodded his assent.
Draco frowned at Blaise. “What were you going to do then?”
Pansy spoke for the first time in a while. Her voice was shaky. “Ask me about my father, Blaise. That’s what Draco knows.”
Pansy and Blaise seemed to come to an agreement, and before Potter could respond, they were hauling Draco down the corridor towards Slytherin’s common room.
Before he could ruminate any more on what an idiot he was, Madam Pomfrey’s voice pierced his aching skull as she bustled over from her office with two potion bottles. “Mr. Malfoy! It’s good to see you awake. I’m afraid you’ve suffered a minor concussion.” She set the bottles down on the bedside table and gingerly helped him to sit up. “Take these. One’s a painkiller and the other will help with bruises and swelling.”
Draco sat up and glared; her hand fell away. “My ass is not fat!” Draco whipped around to face Blaise who raised an eyebrow at him. “That’s it! Blaise, you’re on hair stroking duty! Pansy is fired!”
A different voice that might have been Uncle Severus’s cut through Pansy’s breathing narration. “Draco, tilt your head back, you need to ingest this.”
But still Draco wondered, pacing the dusty classroom. Finnigan had been dragged to the Three Broomsticks by his dormmates, so he might know about Potter’s club. Draco might think that Finnigan and Potter didn’t get along, but they’d always been friendly before.
But his father was hardly around to chastise him for his lack of focus and his mother wouldn’t say anything. If anything he thought he saw her shoot him a small smile the last time he’d left. She had said he was looking a bit pale at dinner the night before.
Most of all, though, Draco was mad at himself. He couldn’t figure out how to
Sorry this one took a while. I've been a bit busy AND AND I got a new Beta reader!!! Huge thanks to FerchKalvaNiibi on AO3!! They looked over this chapter and the previous two since I last posted. You can thank them for the improved grammar.
He was stupid for trying to keep his secret from Luna. He’d never met someone more intuitive.
Draco’s smirk dropped along with the amusement he felt at his friend’s antics. “I don’t know. She doesn’t believe the Dark Lord is back, but I thought she favored Death Eater’s children anyway, from her behavior and my father’s talk. Maybe it doesn’t extend as far as I thought it did.”
All that Sunday Draco was surrounded. All the Slytherins wanted to bask in his ‘success’. Crawling all over themselves to get close to him. Whisper what other things they could do to Potter and the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
Pansy sniffed and gradually calmed down. “I don’t want to be beholden to anyone. I want to do what I want without being dependent on someone else for my happiness. I want to fall in love with someone I know and can trust to never do those things. I want to pick my own path. But I’m so scared I’ll be wrong about someone and end up like my mother anyway. I don’t want to support the Death Eaters after knowing what they can do, but I’m more afraid of not supporting them and the so-called light side finding out just what kind of monster my father was. I don’t want to be completely alone.”
His friends both merely nodded in acceptance of this and stood, Pansy subtly canceling her charm.
Draco met Finnigan’s eyes with purpose and grinned. Finnigan frowned harder, unsettled at Draco’s reaction, even taking a half-step back. “Hmm, yes, that’s what they say. But you know what I say, Finnigan?” Draco took a half-step toward Finnigan, looming over him. “Times. Are. Changing.”
On Friday the 27th Draco got a particularly interesting note from Luna. He continued to talk to her regularly, but more commonly about unusual creatures, so getting something different was always noteworthy, this one especially.
Blaise swallowed. “I don’t know. Not right now. But who knows what I’ll do if I’m pushed enough? If I marry for love, who's to say they won’t leave? Or die? Everyone else has so far. I think that’s why I don’t like getting too emotionally invested.”
you’ve placed me in.” Draco took a deep breath as that fact sunk in. He knew what he had to do now. It was a daunting prospect. He released his breath and returned to glaring. “You will
Milli looked highly affronted, but everyone else only smiled and said their goodnights. Greg made a comment about him and Vincent staying down in the common room for a while. Draco didn’t blame them.
Draco swallowed his feelings and gave a sharp nod. “Yes, sir.”
Brown and Patil came in arm-in-arm. Draco squeezed his quill at the sight. He’d never forget Patil leaving Potter at the Yule Ball to go run off with a half-rate Beauxbaton boy. Draco did a particularly cruel Tripping Jinx on her the first chance he got, she almost fell over the moving stair’s banister. Draco wasn’t sorry.
Draco had been patrolling down by Umbridge's office. Pansy had teamed up with a sixth year prefect to search the seventh floor around Gryffindor tower.
Pansy only huffed in exasperation. “Get. Up. We have a problem! Come on.”
Pansy smiled. “Good.”
Draco gave a derisive laugh. “You hardly need me to tell you, you Gryffindors have your Saint Potter for that. Why believe anything
Draco scowled down at the page, still sore over all the stress Potter was putting him through, and without even knowing it too. He’d taken the last two nights off prefect duty to catch up on sleep and homework, so he supposed it wasn’t the worst timing. He could have used another day though.
Draco scoffed before he could stop himself. Luna turned to look at him. Draco met her eye against his better judgement. “It’s just. I wish away parts of myself all the time. Wish away, push down, ignore. I can’t imagine you would be someone else with your mother around. You’d just be you, but happier. If people are going to wish away parts of themselves anyway, it may as well be the sad parts.”
and leaned forward to apprise the rest of his plan.
Pansy pursed her lips and hummed an affirmative with a look of distaste.
Draco waved her off. “No, it’s good. He was made captain of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team last year, right? So you know a fair bit about Quidditch, even though you don’t play.”
Milli raised her other eyebrow. “Really? You weren’t bored out of your mind?”
He had to blink back frustrated tears.
Draco stared at this message for so long his eyes prickled. He ran his fingers across it several times. He could not believe what he was reading was real. He had seen for himself that Potter was friends with Luna, but he’d never thought that his own friendship with Luna (if that’s what she insisted on calling it, Draco wasn’t sure) would lead to any sort of invitation to spend time with Potter. Luna had to know that they hated each other.
Draco wondered how much he’d heard.
It beat a rapid tattoo against his chest.
Draco sat back in his chair again, crossing his arms, his eyes steely. “We both know I’m not implying anything. You’d have to be incredibly dim to actually believe that the Dark Lord was dead at this point. You’ve been incredibly helpful in his plans to pretend though. My father is
Draco fiddled with his wand, staring at it, but not seeing it. He thought that if Voldemort did come back he’d be happy. His father certainly would be. It was a chance for the Malfoy family to rise in prestige.
Pansy punched him in the shoulder. “Hey! You didn’t need to put it away, I was winning!”
When tears of frustration and stress landed on his pillow he blamed his concussion for that too.
Draco stood up fast enough to knock his chair over. “Don’t!”
Draco’s voice was raw and hoarse. “I didn’t want to believe it was one of you. I wanted to trust you. I care about you. But that’s not how Slytherins work. Father told me that all friendship is based on mutually assured destruction. To never trust anyone with something unless their betrayal would hurt them too. I know… I know something about Pansy that made me doubt it was her because I don’t think she’s told anyone else. On top of that she wouldn’t want to do anything to jeopardize our deal around marriage. But Blaise. I feel like I don’t know a single personal thing about you, Blaise. Now that your affair in public knowledge I’ve got nothing. I still wanted to believe you hadn’t done it, but I had no basis. Slytherins make the best spies. Everyone knows that.”
Draco hissed into Crabbe’s face. “Don’t you think, Crabbe, that if I had wanted Umbridge to know, I would have told her myself?”
Montague was quick to chime in. “That’s brilliant! We never had any luck trying to spy on the Gryffindors before, but we always kept the attempts within the team.”
Montague scoffed. “We can’t let that happen! Those twins are going to turn them against us Slytherins! They’re demons, they are. Look what they did to me in fourth year! Shoved me in that vanishing cabinet. I thought I’d never get out. Stuck in some weird liminal space between here and Borgin and Burkes for ages until I managed to apparate or whatever it was I did.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco couldn’t help the smile he felt spread across his face at the letter as he put both the letter and the unopened package in his school bag.
Potter’s just kept staring at him. “Yes. Why would you?”
Draco tried to play it up as much as he could. Delighting his audience with a rendition of ‘Weasley Is Our King’ and flashing his badge, or pretending to be hit off an invisible broom. Meanwhile his stomach roiled with guilt and anger and worry. Occasionally the thought that he would never play against Potter again, or that Potter would never play
Draco sat for a second in a weird daze before he followed her out of the carriage door. Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy were all waiting for him. Pansy had a bewildered expression on her face. “You had to share a carriage with Loony Lovegood? Merlin, how did you survive that?”
It was hardly a second later when Luna came around the corner. She stood at his shoulder and they both looked down the corridor after Finnigan. She waited several minutes before saying anything.
Draco’s voice was hoarser than he meant it to be. “Take notes, Blaise, I expect my hair stroked regularly.”
When he looked back up he saw Pansy with a crease on her forehead and a piece of toast hanging out of her mouth.
For a second Draco wondered if now would be the time Vincent fought back, but he only gave a sharp nod and lumbered out past Draco to go find the other compartment. Draco motioned Pansy to take the window seat and Draco laid down with his head in Pansy’s lap.
Draco let out a fond sigh of exasperation and smiled down at his notebook, safe as he was from prying eyes, ensconced in his bed curtains.
Potter apparently
“Why do you hate Umbridge, Draco? She’s never done anything to you or your friends.” Luna was looking as far away from Draco as she could be, as if she knew how hard Draco would find the question.
Her mother was afraid to let him go until after Pansy was married. Worried that she’d end up destitute, that she’d lose access to his fortune. Bitter that she hadn’t had a son to whom she could be sure the fortune would go to in case the Ministry tried to challenge her own inheritance on legal fronts.
Blaise’s face showed extreme interest and he leaned forward over Pansy’s shoulder to get a better look at Draco’s reaction. “Potter, hmm. That makes sense. Pulling his pigtails. And you wouldn’t want to work for someone that wants to kill him. But you wouldn’t go against the grain for just any reason either. Guess he’s not bad looking. A little rumpled though.”
When he looked over, she hissed in his ear. “Is that Susan Bones coming in? Amelia Bones’s niece!”
Draco unfroze enough to turn his head to look at Luna. “That doesn’t mean she didn’t tell. She could just be cutting ties before she got found out.”
by taking a detention and 20 points from Gryffindor for being out after curfew.”
Pansy bit her lip. “Only about an hour. No one’s heard what Potter and Weasley’s punishments are yet.”
, his heart practically screamed. “I’ve never seen a worse Keeper… but then he was
Davies’s eyebrows furrowed. “That’s right. Far more than I want to know to be honest. He never shuts up at home.”
Draco sat back on his heels and just looked at Potter. He wanted to kiss his hand. He wanted to wrap his arms around Potter’s neck and rest his forehead on his shoulder. He grimaced. He couldn’t believe himself.
Potter’s glare faded, slowly. Draco wasn’t sure he liked that any better. The whole thing felt like defeat. Like a resignation Draco had been fighting for years. All he’d ever fought for was to have Potter’s eyes on him, in whatever way he could get. Telling him not to bother with Draco was Draco finally admitting weakness, failure. It tasted bitter.
Draco snarled. He hated himself for every word he was saying. Hated that all his jealous longing was being spoken out loud when he’d so carefully tucked it down and away from anyone else. “I torment him because I just want him to hurt like he’s hurt me! To get him to look at me with emotion and not like I’m nothing! I feel no remorse in hurting or belittling his friends because they have everything! It’s so easy for them! What’s it matter if they’re poor, or ugly, or muggleborn, or talentless, when they've impressed him the way I couldn’t! They’re all better than me, but I’ll be damned if I ever let them realize it for a minute!”
He could barely look at Pansy’s livid face, or Blaise’s carefully constructed neutral one.
Blaise’s eyes had widened a little in surprise before he hid it. His voice was rough. “Snape’s going to be mad if I’m late.”
Draco looked over at Warrington next to Montague. “Since you’re the Slytherin seventh year prefect, you’ve spent some time with our first years. Are any of them particularly promising?”
Instead he was floundering with what he really wanted worse than ever. He didn’t
Draco decided to divulge his plan of attack at breakfast the next morning. Although tired, Draco was filled with a manic energy to get this done, which he could tell Pansy did not share. She had stationed herself around Ravenclaw Tower last night, to dissuade people from hanging around when Draco brought Luna back, now she chugged coffee.
In trying to be a better person, he’d single-handedly ruined so many things. He’d lost Potter his ability to fly, he’d made his club illegal, he’d made Luna a target. He had been so careless with how he’d dealt with things that he’d allowed his
scheme?”
The blonde sipped his tea and nodded “disgustingly deep connections … it was so bad that the goblin in charge told me to get away and stay quiet. I told him what I could about the abuse and had to go through a medical exam for the goblins. There were several other scams too to gather evidence for when we take it to court for my emancipation”
Problem was how did he make the tracking charm stick to the figure?
“you are in no condition to fight a paper bag let alone an even more experience auror like myself. Now perhaps I should not have started at the beginning in this case so I will say this now. The Potter heir is currently alive, healthy and happy with the man who saved and blood adopted him at four years old. This man, Brian White, understands that you were his godfather by the Potter and is willing to let you near him only if you’re showing good progress in your recovery” the minister explained.

“Lord Prince so good of you to return. How can I assist you?” the goblin at the counter asked.
Neville pouted sadly as his grandma didn’t stay to hug him goodbye. She just dropped him off and left “bye gran” he said sadly though she was long gone.
Satisfied that the dark Knockturn Ally wasn’t so bad, minus the ‘vampires drink for free’ sign in the window of one pub … he will have to be careful, but still it wasn’t all bad he thought as he returned to the entrance of the Leaky Cauldron, but when he walked into the ally behind the pub and peered in the saw Snape sitting at the counter. He ducked back into the ally as the professor turned his gaze to the door.
As a person raised in a pureblood home Neville was gravely disappointed in the headmaster. Stealing was a terrible thing to do, but when you add in mind control and the other things it becomes clear that Albus Dumbledore is an insane greedy bastard who should be locked up. As for Ron and Hermione they were foolish to trade friendship for money. Neville was definitely under the impression Harry may have gone insane though. Not for befriending Draco. That he was happy about, but some other things were rather terrifying …
"Yeah I remember … but I think it should be discussed again. So much has changed compared to 10 years ago. Cache and Severus have a possible cure, you were hired as a teacher and Dumbledore …" Frank passed briefly and smirked as he thought back on something, "So many obstacles are gone and there's a good sign for things to only continue improving in the future."
Bones crackled …
“I’m going father. If one thing went differently when Cache helped us I would be forced to bond with the Dark Lord … please father, I want to know what’s going on and that that monster is really gone” Draco stated pleadingly.
Severus looked at the glass of Firewhiskey in his hand as he sat in his living room at Spinner’s End. He absentmindedly rocked the glass lightly, watching the liquid swish and listened to the ice clink …
“we’ll go with you” Severus said when he saw that the goblin didn’t comment when the three dark creatures followed Harry out the door. The Malfoys gave hand written permission signed in blood to Griphook and they went down the hall to join the young wizard and the creatures. Even Draco who seemed to be in a state of denial and had yet to look Cache in the eyes.
Draco raised an eyebrow, not sure if he should feel offended. “I have a lot of money and think a lot of my family.”
Draco swallowed, looking down at his hands that were tangled together. He imagined what they would look like with words carved into them and squeezed them tighter. “She’s using a Black Quill on him. Having him write over and over until the words don’t go away.”
Draco and Pansy shared a look. Then mutually took one of Blaise’s hands each. They could tell this story wouldn’t end well. It was widely known that Mrs. Zabini had just married her sixth husband.
“no I didn’t” Hermione argued absolutely positive that all her answers were right.
Excitement was thrumming through Harry. Will they leave tomorrow? In the morning?
“Hogwarts always did seem alive so I’m not surprised she’d react more to you being that you are her rightful heir … and I suppose me as well since I’m your godfather” Severus mulled over the idea.
The old wizard noticed the boy shy away “umm … no thank you sir. Thank you for the wands” Cache gently picked up both wands and carefully put them in his pocket with the holsters “ummm … do you where I could go to find out if I am a natural healer?”
“what?” Severus blinked uncomprehendingly for a second before clutching his head in pure agony.
“not yet … soon he will be … for now follow him and get a tracker on his body” Moody said taking the same turn as Dumbledore, which was surprisingly down Knockturn Alley. The alley was empty save for a werewolf who seemed interested with the two kneazles hanging out on the fourth floor balcony “what’s he doing?” Moody pondered as he and Remus stayed out of sight. When the werewolf darted into the place known as Eventide the kneazles were ushered in by a young man a moment later. Dumbledore started chanting something right after the shutters closed …
“I see his eyesight was fixed and a large number of scars were removed” Severus said with approval. The goblins noticed that some treatment began just before the adoption, but considering the severe circumstances they decided to fudge a few things and not ask questions. Severus, however, decided to ask why Julian’s bone rebreaking took place in Australia before the guardians signed over custody in a more private setting … and more importantly, he wanted the names of the people who abused Julian.
Before anyone knew it the tracker was pulsing in Cache’s hand and he was pressing it into the walking stick. After a few seconds he revealed the tracker with the incantation again and saw it glowing just under the snake’s head “your walking staff Lord Malfoy” Cache said as he twirled the staff in his fingers before handing it over to Lucius.
“my magic is flexible. That’s why I could move the tracker without my phoenix wand, but not with it and it’s why my new wands fit me so much better. My magic won’t make a rigid wall … I need to try a different method … maybe” he focused and soon the pond changed before his eyes …
Sitting at the table dangling a toy mouse in front of a playful cat was a man she never met before “my name is Frank and I’m here to get a friend some closure” he looked up revealing his classic amber eyes making her pale heavily, but as she backed away she something and turned around to see a very tall vampire “his name is Armel and we want to discuss Harry Potter”
Severus watched Harry deeply impressed at what his apprentice was doing and headed upstairs to help in what ways he could, “You’re low on some things. I’ll get some blood potions, pain relievers and postnatal potions ready.” He said as he quickly went up to use his lab at Hogwarts, but he called over his shoulder at Remus and Moody. “Try helping instead sitting there like a lump, Lupin.”
"Wait, Nerve Tonic?" Neville sniffled as he finally looked at Cache through puffy red eyes.
The werewolf winced “Sirius wasn’t re-chosen as his godfather”
(as if he’d want anything to do with suffocating fans that only care about the ‘Boy Who Lived’ crap and not who he is as a person. No wonder Julian wants to leave) Draco thought as he got fed up over all the ‘Potter’ gossip that was completely incorrect. He will have to tell his father about these books that could not have been written with Julian’s permission even though they claim to be about Harry Potter.
The headmaster smiled “I have no doubt little one, go to sleep” he gave Harry the toy wolf to cuddle and watched as the boy finally lost the battle with the Sandman and fell asleep. Brian gently ran his fingers through the black hair before getting up to call Aster and tell her about what happened …
"Lucius … I think this is what Severus wanted us to look at." Narcissa said gravely.
“Yes. I only poured out one vial so the rest of the cauldron is up there, but be careful. It is experimental.” Harry yelled after the vampires who raced up to his room. The door was still open because Lyra and Libra left it open as they got Harry’s potions so nothing could stop them. A split second later only Trocar, Sanguini, Armel, Severus, Harry, Greyback, Mike, Jenny, the wounded werewolf, two kneazles and two babies were left in the complex.
“very well” Albus huffed in a way that could almost be described as childish.
"Love potions, you say?" The goblin asked curiously.
“pretty kitty” Alice said though she didn’t seem to actually notice that Lyra nuzzled her hand.
“sound” Cache said to the baffled healer.
Normally goblins were against helping wizards and neutral, but even they are against certain things. One being abuse … another was Dumbledore. Luckily for Harry the goblins were going to take every chance to derail the old wizard’s underhanded plots that they could get … and it helps that they want to stay on good terms with the Potter heir as well.
“you are very welcome. I was happy to help. Good bye” the kneazles nuzzled each Malfoy in farewell as Cache turned to Griphook and bowed slightly, which was then mimicked by the kneazles “may your gold ever grow Master Griphook, Master Razorback”
“you were gushing blood and you expect me to believe you’re just fine now-” the sound of the compartment opening made Draco pause his rant to glare at poor Neville who came in to see what was wrong “this has nothing to do with you Longbottom. Leave. Now” he ordered only feeling a little guilty because he realized he shut the kneazles out who came flying in when Neville opened the door.
“no … it’s about his past … Julian was born Harry Potter” Severus instantly grabbed their attention and they went to sit in the living room. Everything was described from the abuse Harry went through to Brian and Dumbledore’s involvement to how he came to being Julian’s godfather. Severus waited silently as his friends processed the information.
Severus sneered “Ms. Granger you are wrong in several counts. Can anyone tell me why this method is incorrect?”
“I would love to!” Poppy exclaimed cheerfully not interested in what the patients were, but in seeing how her student has improved.
"Mama! Papa isn't moving and his eyes are weird!" Isaac yelled.
“I know who you are. Friend, headmaster or whatever relationship you have with the minister means nothing. He is to receive no one until he recovers” said the boy as his kneazles circled the headmaster.
"Only if you call Severus, Trocar, Minerva, Poppy and …" Harry's smirk widened.
"We're looking for a passage in order to capture a creature. We'll leave your space once we're done. Sorry for the intrusion." Jasmine said genuinely apologetic for disturbing the spirit especially one of a young girl. "May I ask you name and how you died?" She asked trying to make small talk to keep the spirit calm as her team investigated the room.
“it’s alright Ms. Weasley. He’s pinned down. Can I see your injuries?“ Ginny sniffled and moved her arms that covered her face protectively. There she saw the new staff member called Cache and that Ron was pinned down by one kneazles with large dots as the striped one stood over to the side guarding them “I have a pain reliever with me, but we should go to the infirmary to fix your lip” he said as he pulled out a bottomless green bag and produced a vial of the pain relieving potion from its depths for her.
Frank watched the vampire in amusement, "Calm down, Trocar. Cache and I will be there too smooth things over-"
“ummm … the ingredients may look the same as something else if it’s prepared differently s-so we have to use our other s-senses” Neville answered nervously and flinched as Hermione huffed. Cache gave Lyra a single pack cauldron cake, Neville’s favorite, and she took the delicate cake over to Neville earning a few coos for being cute. After giving Neville the cake she trotted back over to her sister who was curled up next to the front desk.
"Well I guess it can't hurt then. I finished draining the venom so let's go tell everyone to get to healing Dumbles, while we go get Alice and Frank some food. Since they're showing improvement let's get them something special … pancakes, perhaps?" The older healer suggested as they left.
"Hmmm you're asking for several jobs, I see." Cache hummed in thought, "So you want to rearrange the Room of Requirement, complete assistant jobs for any professors and map out the Chamber of Secrets?!" Cache exclaimed more than shocked that the goblins offered that last option or that Minerva signed off on it!
(so I was right. The previous minister was working for Dumbledore. Slippery bastard) Cornelius thought as he sighed and sat down “there is something you both need to know. The wills that were responsible for your released also revealed that all of Harry Potter’s guardian’s were incapacitated in some way meaning someone illegally took him and placed him in the care of unauthorized people. Actually they were the very people who were marked as not an option for caring for him. those people were the muggle family of Lily’s sister and there was a reason the late Lady Potter did not want Harry to ever go to that home. The child was hated, tortured, starved and then some”
The potions were cooled, bottled and put in his bottomless bag except for one, which Harry drank …
“no … I was going to Sev-Professor Snape’s quarters” Draco said before quickly running out the door and trying to out run the other Slytherin, but Blaise was taller and was able to catch up pretty easily.
Silvia raised an eyebrow “he was sick just last month, right?”
Draco chuckled as he poked the baby's belly earning a giggle, "Little Isaac is growing so fast."
What Ginny didn’t know is that Cache was also watching the other Weasleys reactions “I will need to watch Ron” he muttered though he didn’t like the flash of displeasure in Dumbledore’s eyes either. He filled his own plate before moving out of his seat and setting food and water bowls on the floor in front of the staff table. Several gasps of awestruck students were heard as the large beautiful kneazles walked out of their hiding place and to the bowls. As dinner started winding down many kids came up to pet Lyra and Libra who were happy to receive the attention even though Hermione clearly wasn’t …
"Let me go! I'm the victim here!" Pettigrew screamed as he tried to struggle against the team of aurors as they lead him a holding cell at the base of Azkaban.
“shit” the young wizard hissed and yanked his arm back letting the baggy sleeve fall over the scars hiding them from view. Severus felt his heart clench as the boy glanced around almost fearfully and remained tense even after looking back at the jar of dragon blood for several more seconds.
“ok” Cache conceded. He knew his eyes couldn’t take much more and needed a break so he left with his kneazles.
He’d gotten her door half open and a foot out when she spoke up after him. “I expect to see you after dinner tomorrow.”
Draco sent the list of suggestions to Luna Tuesday night. She promised that she’d bring them to the Golden Trio.
Draco followed Potter at a bit of a distance; when Potter turned into an empty corridor that was rarely used, Draco saw his chance. He was so angry he didn’t even consider casting a spell. He sped up until he was next to Potter and then shoved him as hard as he could into the stone wall.
When his curtains were ripped open on Saturday after breakfast, which he’d skipped, he knew he was caught.
Harry's back!
Draco hissed back, “Of course I’m okay, you dolt. Why wouldn’t I be?”
Draco waved them off. “Just bloody leave will you?”
Blaise sighed and ran a hand down his face. Draco had to stop himself from gaping at the show of stress. “Pansy didn’t want to come pick you up because she didn’t want to be the one to break the news.”
He was having such a good time pretending that Potter wasn’t hosting a barely legal defence club, that he hardly noticed when the weekend was over and Monday approached again.
I’m so awfully bored at home without you to amuse me. I was planning on trying my hand at seducing someone wildly inappropriate in an act of teen rebellion while I could, before shit really hit the fan, but my mother has decided that I should start accompanying her to most of her ‘ladies’ tea party’s’ now so I’m a bit hampered for time when it comes to rebelling. I suppose it wouldn’t be fair to our new arrangement anyway were I to be caught, so I guess you should be happy about my boredom. I’ve included your birthday present of the usual expensive chocolates Your Majesty, King Ponce. I better get something good this year for all I did for you last year. And you better write back!
did. He didn’t want to ever see Potter lying over the body of a dead friend, or alone and bleeding in an abandoned corridor after dark.
Draco managed to keep a good track of Potter and pals as they all got off the train. He even managed to get those green eyes turned his way. The first look after the holidays was always the sweetest.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Luna didn’t respond and Draco felt a stab of vindictive satisfaction.
He spent the evening behind his curtains, sulking, with his head on Pansy’s lap. When Pansy had asked about him not patrolling he’d had to tell her what had happened. She was more good-natured about it than he expected, stroking his hair the way he liked and only calling him an idiot once.
He sent a quick message to Luna; a half hour later she responded that everyone was there.
Yours,
He was stopped on his way to the carriages by none other than Professor Snape himself, obviously returned. He grabbed Draco’s elbow just as he was about to exit the main door in the Entrance Hall. Draco nodded at Vincent and Greg to go on and followed Severus off to the side willingly. They both stood not looking at each other, but over at the students.
Draco smiled inwardly, but only showed them a less-fond looking smirk. “If you two are done? Mother said that Umbridge is watching the castle‘s communications. And something about Christmas I don’t fully understand.”
He crinkled the parchment up until it was a ball and squeezed it in both his hands until they stopped shaking. He put his forehead against his hands on the table and tried not to be weak enough to let the tears swimming in his eyes escape.
By Friday night every phase of his plan was complete and ready for the next day with the Gryffindorks none the wiser. Draco could hardly sleep for his excitement for the next morning when he’d see all the Gryffindor faces. Weasley’s. Potter’s.
This went on for three days. Three days where Draco lived in a haze of resentment that didn’t allow him to concentrate on much else.
“That’s why you thought it was us?” Pansy’s voice was disbelieving.
He took his chance to renew his tormenting. Staring at him was apparently such an effective distraction for Potter that Draco couldn’t resist mucking up whatever Potter happened to be working on. Once when Draco spotted Potter following him by the Quidditch field, he’d put him in a body-bind and locked him in the broomshed.
But he could see how this would discredit Potter. Draco’s eyes narrowed in suspicion. Having someone so obviously sent by the Ministry and so obviously against Dumbledore, and by extension, Potter, on the staff overlooking the children made it hard to be wishy-washy about things. It set up an us-or-them sort of dichotomy that children of Ministry employees would be hard-pressed to fight against.
Pansy scowled harder. She really did look like a crup when she scrunched her nose up like that, Draco found himself thinking wildly in an effort to keep his composure.
Pansy scoffed. “Look at him, he’s clearly still loopy from the calming draught.”
Draco shut his eyes for a second to focus. He opened them and immediately met Potter’s eyes. “It’s only dittany Potter. A potion for healing wounds. It’s not going to do much with an injury like this, but it should help calm the bleeding down and maybe the swelling.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Blaise shift awkwardly. Draco suddenly wondered if Blaise ever felt left out: Left out of the relationship between him and Pansy, left out of Draco’s gang of Slytherins, left out of the core of pureblood society. As far as Draco knew, Blaise hadn’t been close to anyone else before he threw in with him and Pansy.
Pansy sniffled, but removed herself. “We thought Weasley and Potter
Umbridge had paused her writing as he’d spoken and now looked up slowly to meet his eyes once more. “What is it, exactly, that you are implying, Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco’s stomach fell through his shoes, and he would have stopped walking if Blaise wasn’t pulling him along.
There was nothing, but silence after those words …
Harry leaned back to get a good look Draco's flushed, naked, cum soaked body, "Fuck." He groaned at the sight that made his cock harden even more. When he spotted Draco's glazed eyes on him his lust went up and he began licking the cum off of Draco's body.
“is something wrong?” the concerned Lady Malfoy asked.
“only one?” Trocar blinked in mock shock earning a pout from the werewolf.
"I know … thank you." Remus smiled, so happy that he was being given a chance. He realized how foolish he was for trying to drag Harry away when the boy did whatever he could to survive. Harry made it this far and he had no clue about anything until he actually tried looking for the truth. It all clicked when he saw Dumbledore's true cowardly nature. The wizard was in hiding! The image of the strong brave trustworthy wizard was blurred when he found the muggle newspaper, but seeing that the man tried to avoid the consequences is what shattered that image. All of this revealed how weak minded he has been.
