“Pansy and I are only friends.  Good friends, but no more.  Like you and Hermione.”
“I’m sorry to keep you in the dark for so long on this subject, but the approval came just a few days ago,” she explained. “I really wasn’t certain which candidate would succeed.”
“Nothing.  We just talked.”
“No, you should stay.  You’re exhausted,” Harry said, stroking his hair.  He reached over to the bedside table for his wand.  After a quick clean up spell, he covered them both with the blanket and settled back into position.  By the time Harry’s arm draped back over Draco, the blond was lightly snoring despite the relatively early hour.
Ginny glanced at the boys. “Yes.  But only two are being tested.  That one is my brother.” She pointed to Ron, unnecessarily.  It was bad enough to have two prospective fathers.  Ginny didn’t want the witch to think there were three.
“I’ll not apologize for him, though,” said Draco, catching the look. “I didn’t marry him to hurt you.  I love him.”  He paused. “I will admit to taking some joy in your disgust, however.”
Ron’s mouth drew into a small frown.
Poppy the House Elf appeared before Harry and Draco, bowing slightly.  “Masters, the Welcome Witch at the hospital called.”
Harry thought about it.  “That’s not a bad idea,” Harry conceded.
“Is it a boy?”
“Yes,” Draco smiled.  “But you’re a terrible liar.”
Harry chuckled, then moaned as Draco’s hand found his crotch.  Without giving it a second thought, Harry ground against it, soon becoming hard.
The girl looked nervously between Draco and Casper, her perfect rosebud lips agape.
“Draco!” Harry shouted.
Draco glanced over at Harry’s table once more.
“There are all sorts of reasons,” she told him.
“Harry, are you sick?” Ginny asked as she sat next to him at breakfast.  “Your eyes look awful.”
The group finished their meal with light conversation. Harry marveled at the lack of tension among them. The other three, anyway. He was nervous about the four of them sitting together, certain that there would be nothing to talk about. Ron had dealt with Draco on a professional level several times, yet Harry was still surprised that they were able to get past the animosity that had been between them for so long. Five years of maturity went a long way.
“What about the baby? “Draco demanded.
“Remembered what?”
Hermione glanced around at the romantic scene. She didn’t know why Draco decided not to show up, but she thought he was a fool if this was the way Harry always treated him.
When they all finally sat down to dinner, he passed the bowl of whipped potatoes to Harry.
“We just picked those because they’re flower names.  Because of Lily.  Even our House Elf has a flower name for crying out loud.”  He looked down at his daughter.  “She deserves something special.  Perhaps a family name, like the other two,” Draco suggested.
“Are you giving up already?”
Their breathing gradually returned to normal from the fevered panting it had been. Draco’s eyes remained closed while Harry stared at the ceiling. This was the part he was most anxious about. So many times before, there had been little to say between him and his lovers after sex. It had become his habit to leave shortly after and sleep alone. On the odd occasion that he invited a lover to his flat, he neglected to extend the invitation to sleep over.
He reached up to feel Draco’s pulse, panicking when he couldn’t find one.
Draco shook his head. “No, I don’t want there to be secrets.  He just explained that he looked into Dark objects as a way to cure my mother.  He’d also been searching for something called a resurrection stone, in hopes of bringing my— Druella, back to life.  He was in a desperate state.  It was simply a myth some Death Eater used to suck him back in. What?”
“You were just goading me?”
“Wait!  Wait!” The man opened the door fully.  “I may have been wrong.  Let me check if they’re here.  Please come in Mr. Potter.”  The man gave Harry a smile so creepy, it rivaled Filch’s.
“You’re still in one piece,” she snickered.  “Are the other two?”
“You can’t refuse me, I’m Harry Potter,” the brunette smirked.
They both laughed, but neither one actually answered the question.
Draco crossed his arms over his chest.  “So, now I’m not allowed to even talk to you in public?  Isn’t that sort of going backwards?  I thought we were working toward being out in the open.”
Feeling the need to explain, so Draco wasn’t embarrassed, Molly said, “Draco helped us peel and cut the potatoes.  He asked why we didn’t use magic to do it. I told him they taste better when you do things by hand.”
“What about your future with Miss Ginevra Weasley?”
“Forgive Poppy, Master Draco,” Poppy bowed.
Smiling, Blaise said. “Nice, huh?  It sounds like it worked.  Now you’re all ready for him.”
“Mistress Narcissa be waiting in the gardens,” Clara answered.  The elf kept glancing up at Harry with large grey eyes.  “Clara be taking Master Draco and . . . Mister Harry Potter to her.”
“I actually went to the party hoping to get your wand again.” She bit her lip and waited for his response.
Draco looked up at Harry, who maintained the illusion of copying his work.  Deciding it was nothing, Draco set back to his task.  He wanted to finish their essay that night, so they could begin making their potion on Tuesday.
“Loved?” Draco suggested.
“Not now Zabini.”
“So he was hedging his bets against Voldemort?” Ron questioned.
“Yes, I’d like to see that too,” Draco said. “We should take advantage of our summers off and travel somewhere different every year.”
Harry was normally a take charge sort of bloke.  He went to muggle pubs and had his pick of attractive young men. They’d find somewhere to go--a hotel, or possibly the other fellow’s home-- and shag.  Occasionally, he’d find one of them compatible enough to see again.  Perhaps even several times.  Whatever happened, Harry was always in control.
He shrugged.  “There are lots of suspects out there.  And probably even more that we don’t know about.”
“I’m afraid I’ll get
Ginny and Blaise glanced at one another. They didn’t have much choice.  Blaise nodded at Ginny as a sign of approval. She nodded back.
A smile came to Draco’s face.
“It’s due Wednesday,” Harry reminded him.
“Yes.  Of course I trust you.  It’s him I don’t trust.”  Draco didn’t have to specify which him he was talking about.
“The scandal was my fault, not Draco’s.  And he’s not been caught doing anything,” Harry defended.
“Olivia knows about us,” Draco said out of the blue.
“Sort of like those muggle necklaces that are heart shaped, and each person wears half of the heart?” Harry guessed.
“It was nothing, I swear. And besides, what about you and Casper Montague?”
“But still, in just a few months. I don’t think I would have been able to do that.  Well done.”
Anxiously, Harry walked inside and sat in the chair across from the desk.  He looked around the office.  Things were a little different from when it had been Dumbledore’s office, but generally, it was familiar and comfortable.
Harry laughed. “Nothing was going to be able to stop me.” He reached out for Draco’s shoulder. “But I would have been more careful. I didn’t mean to make you cry.”
He leaned a bit closer.  “I asked if you could hand me a cup,” he said, louder.
Pansy rolled her eyes, along with several others.  “Because everyone will be paired up by the time half the wands are chosen.  There won’t be any need.  For example, if you choose my wand, I’m yours for the night.  You then Accio your own wand.  Two wands are then spoken for.  Understand?”
Tracey laughed, “All right.” Once again, she passed through the passageway.
“You’ve been practicing,” Harry noted.
Harry grabbed a cup of punch and went in the opposite direction.  He wandered around watching students dance, speaking with a few of them.  At times, he forgot how he was dressed, until he noticed one or two of the Seventh Year girls staring at his legs.  He quickly fled the area in search of a darker place to hide.
Closing his eyes, like a child does, thinking they can’t be seen, Harry waited for Malfoy to finish his thought.  Mercifully, he didn’t bring up Harry’s huge faux pas.  Instead, he asked Harry the question he had been asking himself for the past week.
“Yes.  Otherwise you won’t get your Christmas present,” Harry smirked.
Arriving a bit earlier than usual for their Friday night rendezvous, Harry conjured the usual items–the soft mattress, pillows and candles.  Harry especially liked the way Draco looked by candlelight.  Not to mention, he figured it hid many of his own flaws.
Draco stood dumbstruck.
“Just bloody perfect,” he answered sarcastically.
They kissed and said one more goodbye, then Draco was gone.
Harry looked past her to the other Gryffindors, who were attentively listening in.
Biting his lip, Harry replied.  “You looked like you enjoyed it.  Do you think I will?”
He leaned back against the window frame and fully unzipped his trousers.  Taking his hardened cock all the way out, he groaned loudly, now that he didn’t care.  He swiftly massaged himself, closing his eyes and panting in short breaths.
“It’s all right, luv.  Eventually.”
She glanced at Daphne, who was sandwiched between two boys as they all danced.
He took the baby and sat in a rocker, while the others sat down on the sofa to have tea.
Turning to Harry, Draco nodded.  Harry smiled at the way his nose and cheeks had become pink form the cold.  He kissed each cheek and the tip of his nose to warm them slightly, then kissed his lips.  They were cold as well, and Harry had more fun warming them up.
“Sorry,” Harry said shyly.
“Night cap?” Draco questioned.
“Blimey, Dra. Don’t tell me you haven’t fucked anyone before.”
“Then let’s go.”
“Damned staircases,” Draco cursed.
“Perhaps we ought to find someplace more private,” Draco suggested.
“Because, I don’t know if he’d even consider you, but if you do get the chance, don’t fuck it up.”
A high pitched squeak escaped Harry’s throat.  His fantasy scenario had never gotten past that first kiss, and the thought of moving further, perhaps even all the way, caused an obvious physical reaction.
Harry laughed.  “Do you think I dare come here if I didn’t? But it may not be the neatest.”
Narcissa sat to Lucius’ left. Draco sighed and assumed it would be best for him to sit next to his father to spare anyone else the unpleasant task. The Weasleys filled in the other spots from the opposite end of the table, leaving a place for Harry beside Draco.
“Why did you bring that up?” Harry asked.  “You know I don’t like to talk about that.”
Nodding, Harry continued to follow Hermione to the bar. Draco side-stepped Harry and caught up to Hermione, speaking close into her ear.
“I don’t–” Harry called out.
hdhdhd
“Oi, Harry.  Where’ve you been?” Ron asked, in an obvious cheerful mood.
Standing awkwardly off to the side, Draco was regretting that he and his parents agreed to such a ridiculous invitation.  The families were able to pull together enough for the wedding, but it was too much to ask in such a small, intimate setting. And so out of the Malfoy element.
“But what about me and Harry?”
“When?”
“No, that’s not what I meant.”
“Harry already gave me a lecture, Pans.” He rolled his eyes.  “Do you have my supper?”
“I understand,” the man in question answered.  “But I am.  I don’t know how I can prove to you--”
Harry nodded.  He felt the same thing.  A slow grin crossed Harry’s face. “You love me.”
“Now?” Harry asked.
The pair strolled through the gate, reset the wards and made their way into the castle.  It was a bit chilly outside, but Harry felt oddly warm.  The evening was perfectly lovely.  The Quidditch match was brilliant, conversation flowed smoothly, the food was enjoyable and the company was charming.  It was the best date Harry had ever been on.
Casper looked up and blinked.
“Those sofas are horridly uncomfortable,” Draco complained.
Casper grinned and left with several other students from his House.
“She kissed me,” he said slowly.  “Penelope Pipshaw kissed me.”
“All right. If you’re sure they want around me, too.”
“Aren’t you?”  Harry questioned before he could stop himself.
Continuing his self-imposed research project at supper, Harry was quietly observing all of the other students, including his closest mates.  There was a time when he would look at Ginny and get a feeling of butterflies, but it was gone now.  And when he gazed over at Pansy, he had to admit to experiencing a warm sensation in his nether regions.  But that was only a physical reaction to his memory of a couple of nights ago.
“You won’t need to,” Harry assured him.  “I love you.  Nobody is going to take me away from you.”
Harry opened his mouth, most likely to put his foot in it.  But he looked into Draco’s eyes.  Those beautiful grey eyes that seemed to have new life in them.
The Tower was empty when Harry arrived.  Disheartened and a bit winded from the brisk walk up many flights of stairs, Harry paused to lean against the railing and look out at the view.
“We’re not–oh, never mind,” Pansy began to explain. “It’s not like I need to protect my reputation,” she laughed.
“But I’m the one who’s not teaching right now.  McGonagall gave me leave so I could take care of the babies.”
“I thought perhaps you’d like to put your bags in your quarters before going down to see the Potions room.”
“Yes, I seem to have a few Hermiones on my hands.”
“Unfortunately, the harm may have already been done.”
“Was it like that the whole time?” Harry questioned. A look of worry crossed his face.
“Perhaps I should let the three of you talk,” Draco offered and made a move to leave.
“Why did you do that?” Draco asked, incredulous.
Harry glanced at the clock on the mantle. “Shit. Is that the correct time? I should go. I have some paperwork to do.”
“Someday, Hermione, you’re going to make an excellent mother,” Harry muttered sarcastically.
“Great, me too. Where do you want to go?”
Harry inwardly groaned.  He didn’t want to have to repeat himself and explain more than necessary.
He continued to thrust in and out while Draco held on for dear life. The former Slytherin willed himself to relax and enjoy the feel of the soft kisses being bestowed upon him. The pain, though bearable, was distracting. But Draco thought he heard Harry whisper I love you as he suckled on his ear.
“It’s gold and platinum,” the blonde explained.  “Of course I’d give you a discount, but I don’t suppose either of you are interested.”
“What’s wrong, luv?”
Making it through the second week had been difficult for Harry.  Besides missing Draco terribly, Professor Knox always seemed to have something he needed to discuss with him.  If he wasn’t complaining about Casper Montague, he was asking Harry for advice on books to read, or gossiping about the other professors.  Harry tried to tune him out most of the time, but he wished he’d paid more attention when he talked about Flitwick.  If he had, he wouldn’t have been completely taken by surprise when McGonagall made her announcement.
Harry pulled off and back just far enough in order to watch as long streams of white, hot cum shot out of Draco’s rosy cock. He kept his mouth open, hoping to catch anything that came close enough. As it happened, Draco shot for distance and Harry was rewarded with the sweet and salty mixture.
“I’m sorry I kept it from you,” Harry said.  “I should have trusted you.”
“I never blamed you.”
“He’s a good man.  Fair and honest.  He’ll give your parents a fair trial,” Harry assured him.  “What about the defense?”
Draco lowered to his knees and took Harry into his mouth.  It took little time before Draco was happily swallowing Harry’s load.
Laughing, Harry picked up his drink and raised it toward his friends. “I hope so, too.”
Harry rolled his eyes.
Thursday following his night out with Ron and Hermione, Harry was beginning to regret his decision to let Hermione set him up on a date.  It had been a long week and the students, particularly the higher years, were getting distracted by a Halloween dance planned at the end of the month.  Halloween had always been one of Harry’s favorite holidays at Hogwarts, so he understood.  But it didn’t make his job any easier.  Worse, the faculty had to chaperone the dance.  Harry always felt awkward at dances, the worst having been the Yule Ball Fourth Year.  He supposed it must have had something to do with being uncomfortable around girls.  And dancing with them was somewhat objectionable.
Against his better judgement, Harry agreed.  “I’ll give you another chance.  But I’m telling you, we’re friends and nothing more.”
Harry had been asking himself the same question.  Answering yes meant opening himself up, making himself vulnerable.  Not only to Hermione, but to his own fears.
Pouting, Draco relented. “Oh, all right.  I’ll go.  But only if they all know I’m coming.  The last thing I need is one of them to hex me to Hell because they don’t know I’m with you.”
Terry turned around, puffing his chest out.  “Defending your little bum chum?” Boot teased.
“I think that was her way of letting me know I could, without actually telling me.  Come on.” Ron took Harry by the sleeve and dragged him until they caught up with Hermione.
“Yeah, sure, mate. Get some rest. I’ll see you in the morning,” Ron stood and clapped him on the back. “Oh, wait. I’ve got something for you.” He walked to the cupboard and brought out Harry’s wand to hand to him.
Shrugging, Harry replied, “I don’t know.  What do you want to do?”
Fishing around in his pocket, Ron got down on one knee.  He took Hermione’s left hand and began to slip a simple gold diamond solitaire ring on her ring finger.
“Yeah, but it’s Malfoy.  Why would you go out of your way to be nice?”
“You mean, you would actually want to move in with me?”
Draco mumbled a spell and the tight leather cuff surrounding Harry’s cock and bollocks dropped off.  Blaise certainly did know a number of handy spells.
Harry smiled down at him.  “Reminds me of our first encounter.  Except that time, it was me that couldn’t hold out.”  He snickered.  “As I recall, you said I gave you one of the best blow jobs you’d received.”
Now that it was over, Harry was a bit ashamed of his behavior.  It didn’t matter that she initiated it.  He didn’t even have any real feelings for her.
“I wouldn’t mind if you borrow my idea,” Draco smirked.  He personally thought vampires were very sensual and he wouldn’t mind seeing Harry dressed that way.  “If you promise not to bite.”  He chanced a not-so-subtle innuendo.
“Stop it, Harry.  Someone will hear you.”
He put the quill down and re-read what he wrote. So far, the journal had accepted Harry’s words at face value.  It was true, he was confident he would make a decent Auror before. That’s what everybody told him.  He was tired of chasing and vanquishing evil.  And now that all that had ended, he wasn’t certain he wanted to go back to it.  But things were different now.  Instead of simply killing or incarcerating Death Eaters, there was a chance he could turn them away from dark magic, get rid of the dark magic in them.  So, perhaps being an Auror would make sense. The difference would be a conscious decision on his part, not a blind following of advice.  Satisfied that he was being honest with himself in regard to his career path, Harry moved on to more difficult subjects.
“You said whatever we planned would be fine.  You said you didn’t care.”
“Because you don’t really like girls.  You only like me,” Draco teased.
“So, you’ll talk about the war?  Your friends?  Your family?”
The Potions professor leaned down to speak in Penelope’s ear.  “Let him down gently, yeah?  You have no idea how long it’s taken him to gather the nerve.”
Though he would never admit it, Lucius was moved by Harry’s words.  Like Draco, pride prevented him from acting.  He wanted nothing more than to have his family back by his side.
Sitting up straighter, Harry answered, “Yes, of course.  It’s not a matter of being good enough, anyway.”
Harry showered and dressed for the day, joining Hermione and Ron in the common room before heading down to breakfast. He pulled Ron aside.
“My mother’s parents were actually rather excited about it,” she told them.  “They had so many questions and wanted to know what sorts of things I could do. My grandmother still expects me to display my talents as a witch whenever I visit.”
“I would be happy,” she smiled.  “I had trouble with this one.  I guess I’m a little distracted.”
Knox reached up and tentatively took Harry’s chin between his fingers, forcing him to look at him.
. Draco knew it was wrong to keep the spells on the cauldron.  That wasn’t even the question. The question was whether or not he could live with that decision for the rest of his life.  And what if, eventually, the magic faded.  He, Pansy and Blaise didn’t really study the magic enough to know if it was permanent.  But more than that, Draco didn’t think he’d be able to live with a huge lie hanging over their happiness like a dark cloud threatening to burst at any moment.
Reaching under his bed, Harry took out the journal and quill.  Draco had gone with Blaise to get some Quidditch practice in, leaving Harry with some time to himself.  He smiled to himself as he read the one and only entry.  Then added the second.
“Oi, what’s going on in here?” Ron asked as he and Harry stepped through the back door into the kitchen.  Molly, Ginny, Hermione and Fleur were all standing in the archway between the kitchen and the sitting room.  “Spying on someone, are we?”
They stayed in position for a moment, until Draco’s waning cock slipped out of Harry, along with a generous amount of Draco’s cum.
December 31 1998
“Well, I think it’s important,” Harry said.  “If you don’t want me to write about your personal lives, I won’t.” He paused. “But you have to admit, you two do have a cute little love story.”
“For the record.  My answer
Harry was quick to answer, “All right.”  He didn’t want the evening to end, even if it was all in his head. They continued up to the sixth floor.
“That was different. That was before I knew what it was like to be here with you.”
“Thank you professor.”
“We had some good times,” Ginny smiled.  “It wasn’t all fighting.”
“Tomorrow?”
Rolling up his sleeves, Harry prepared himself for the painstaking task of excavating the pile of rubble for Greyback’s wand.
hdhdhd
No one else was in a mood to eat, as they were anxious to see that Arthur was all right for themselves.  Hermione and Harry took the lift down to the cafeteria by themselves.
“Not underneath this shirt.”
“These things take time, dear,” Arthur said, sipping his tea.
“I don’t want to keep you from doing things you want to do.”
“You’re going to get caught.”
“I don’t have any intentions toward him.”  He squirmed half-heartedly to get away.
“She printed a story anyway?  That bitch.”
When they apparated back home, Harry wondered if Draco didn’t want him to go back in the house because he didn’t want anyone to tell him about Draco reading to the children.  The more he thought about it, the more certain he became that was the case. He chose not to let on that he saw but would treasure the memory for himself.
“A legacy that will be impossible to live up to,” Harry said. “That’s a burden I wouldn’t want to put on anyone.”
“Mm, so what shall we do for the rest of the weekend?”  Draco stroked Harry’s sweat soaked hair as they lay together.
“Do you want the one dressed in robes or the cat-thing?” Romilda asked Padma.
“He has to figure it out for himself.  We can’t force him to do something he’s not ready for.”  Draco looked back at Harper.  “I just hope it’s not too late when he is ready.”
She leaned over to hug her friend.  He half-heartedly returned it, still a tiny bit annoyed at her playing of devil’s advocate.
“You, waving to Longbottom,” Tracey clarified.
“I guess I didn’t forgive him fast enough.  I was just being jealous again.  Don’t worry about it.”  Draco turned away to end the call.
“Don’t congratulate me yet.  She hasn’t said yes,” Ron laughed.
Chuckling lightly at the events, now that they were past, Harry told him, “Well, everyone expected me to punch you or curse you, or something.  When I didn’t, the gossip started.  I was able to ignore most of it at first.  Ron and Hermione cleaned up for me so I could look for you.”
“You all right?” Harry asked. He had taken off the robe, climbed between the sheets and propped up the pillows behind him. The duvet was pulled down low, leaving his upper body exposed.
“San Remo,” Draco said.  “I’ve been there, but I was too young to gamble at the time.  Actually, that might a nice diversion. We can dress in our finest tonight and I can make everyone jealous with you on my arm.”
“I wasn’t holding my wand when I made my request.  I wonder if Pansy knew that you have to be holding your wand for it to be binding?”
Harry grinned. “I feel fantastic too.  It wasn’t until the end that it got . . . weird.  What do you think happened?”
“Harry,” Knox turned to him. “I . . . just wanted to say that I’m sorry. I never meant to cause you any . . .” he trailed off.
“Yes.  We can go now,” Harry replied.
“Harry, come to bed.  It’s our first night living together.  You don’t want to spend it in the hallway, do you?”
He took Ginny’s hand in his.  “If you do, I’ll make sure you don’t regret it.  I promise to do better this time.”  He had been a bit of the jealous type and they argued every time she simply had a conversation with another boy.  “I won’t be a possessive prat like before.  Ginny, I still really like you.”
hdhdhd
“The only thing I regret when it comes to you, is how much time I wasted.”
“I can’t really feel them anymore. So, I guess they’re okay.”
They waited another ten minutes before deciding they were what remained of the Slytherin House wand parties.
“Oh.  Do you want me to go with you?”
“They’re finished.  Can’t we be finished too?” he whinged.
“It’s gorgeous.”
“Oh, come on, I’m only taking the piss. Besides, it’s not like everyone doesn’t know why Harry always took Malfoy out. You pointed it out to me yourself. And look, it’s all worked out for the best.”
“I’m more than happy to help.  Let me know if there’s anything else I can do. I should be going now.  Molly is at our place watching Rose, and I said I would bring lunch back with me.”
Draco relaxed slightly.  “See, I told you.”
“I have to go,” Draco said, and walked toward the staircase.
And in Harry’s mind, he was officially out.
“And are you wearing make-up?” Draco questioned, now that he was closely looking at Harper’s face.
“She only fell asleep because all she had to stare at was my boring face,” laughed Harry.
“Uh, white gold,” Ron replied.
“I don’t understand,” Parvati said.  “Anthony told Padma that he insisted that Ernie give him a hand job, which Ernie declined.  But nothing happened to him.”
adjusted the wards for him.  Perhaps because he was expected at the wedding.  Slowly, Draco stepped softly up to the door and turned the handle.  He listened for voices but heard none in close proximity.  Ron’s voice carried from the kitchen, along with another, but Draco couldn’t make out what either was saying.
“I don’t know.  Maybe with all the drama of the war gone, it just sort of, fizzled out.  It was like, I started thinking of her as more of a sister, and it didn’t feel right to--”
“Thanks Hermione,” Harry kissed her cheek.
“Yes. Touch me, Draco,” Harry whispered.
“You’re not fat.”
“Draco and I decided, well, actually, we decided before we left . . . but we talked about it a lot while we were away.”
Students arrived at last, keeping all of the professors busy.  Harry and Draco had little time for socializing, and just when Harry thought they were finally making progress towards real friendship.  They had bonded over Snape’s memory, each sharing their thoughts and feelings about the man.  Though Harry had not looked forward to doing the work necessary to clean up Snape’s office, he was glad for the opportunity it provided to get to know the new Head of Slytherin House.
Harry made a face.  “That’s horrid.  And what makes you think she’ll look like me?”
“I thought Draco would be too.  But he seemed quite content reading to her.  He’s very good at reading aloud.”
“Of course.”
“Sometimes people aren’t always certain what the truth is.  People lie to themselves all the time,” Draco explained.  “This journal is not for the faint of heart.  It will be brutally honest with you.  You may learn things about yourself you don’t want to admit, so take care in what you write.”
The Gryffindors looked at Harry wide-eyed.
As the last of the potions were finished, the very last being Blaise and Mandy’s, students began walking around the room to sniff the others.  Michael hurried quickly out of the room.
“She’s a young Auror.  Nice girl, but I never thought anything of her.  She flirted a bit,” Ron shrugged.  “I don’t even notice anymore.  It’s funny, back in school I couldn’t get any girl to look at me, ‘cept Lav.  And Hermione.  Not that I knew at the time--”
“Nature will always choose for Harry and I to remain childless,” Draco said.
“Good,” Draco smiled.  He opened his eyes.  “It feels even better if you move.”
hdhdhd
“You don’t need to lock me away.  The only thing that would drive me away is if you tell me you don’t love me anymore.  If that ever happens, I’ll let you go.  Because no matter what, I want you to be happy.  But it won’t be because I don’t love you.”
Harry laughed.  “I suppose I was never one to care much about material things.  Besides, if my aunt and uncle caught wind of my account at Gringott’s, they’d have found a way to take it.  I kept it a secret from them.”
Harry followed Draco’s lead in pace, and when Draco realized it, he used Harry as a model for what he wanted. He teased Harry’s cock with the tip of his tongue, licking up and down the length.  He sucked the leaking head, moaning as Harry mimicked his ministrations.  Taking the entirety of Harry’s cock into his mouth, Draco bobbed up and down, reveling in the feeling of Harry’s mouth on his own cock.
“Oh.  How is it different from any other journal?” Harry wondered why anyone would not write the truth down in their own diary.  Weren’t all diaries essentially the truth?  Or the writer’s version of it.
Harry tilted his head and firmly pressed his mouth to hers. Their lips worked together, opening and closing smoothly and slowly.  Harry reached up and ran his fingers through her hair, tangling them in the process.
Unable to lie and stare at the ceiling any longer, Harry quietly got up, showered and dressed for the day.  Instead of regular clothing, Harry dressed in a fresh pair of flannel plaid pajamas. Christmas was definitely a day to lounge around.  He went to the common room and started a fire. By then, his stomach began to growl, and he wanted Draco to wake up so they could get to breakfast.  Only a handful of other students were in the castle, along with a few professors, and breakfast wouldn’t linger.
“Oh, yeah.  Oh yeah,” Harry panted.  “Touch me, Draco.”
He chuckled.  “I can only imagine what you thought of me.”
“Oh, Professor Malfoy,” Madam Pince called.  “I’ll just leave these--”
“No, I want to keep the ceremony quiet and small,” Harry said.  “In fact, if we could keep this within Hogwarts walls until we can make an announcement in the papers, that would be ideal.”
“Hello Harry.  Malfoy,” Knox said, standing his ground after all, yet looking a bit beaten down.  His physical wounds were long healed.  But his emotional ones were still very much fresh.  Losing Harry, or rather not being able to win him over in the first place, was bad enough.  Finding out his parents were not the people he thought they were, had left him shellshocked.
“You know we all love having you here.”  He kissed his mother again.
He cocked his head and gave his mother a look as if to say ‘seriously?’.
“I do.  I think I do,” Harry replied.
“Then we’re doing this a bit arse about face, aren’t we?  Unless you’re planning another go ‘round.”
“Did Harry take other snitches out to lunch?”
“Not at all. I’m enjoying it.  Even with the shocking lack of sex scenes,” Draco joked.
“He sneered at first, which I did expect.  But I suppose that was directed more at me personally, for not being a pure blood.  His objections to our marriage were mostly his concerns about my sincerity.”
Blaise rolled his eyes.  “You all right, mate?” he asked Draco. “I mean about your mum giving you the boot on Christmas Eve.”
“We shouldn’t have kept it from you.”
“Well, everything is just lovely.  And the goat cheese puffs-- delicious.”
“So, Althea, Hermione tells me you work with muggle artifacts.  How do you like it?”
Draco rolled his eyes and turned to Harry. “Been saving that one, have you?” he laughed.
Blaise chuckled.  “Let the games begin.”
“Hello sweetheart,” he cooed, bouncing her slightly. She tugged at his hair and pulled his nose into her drool filled mouth.
During the last couple of weeks leading up to Christmas, Harry received his last two rejection letters.
“It’s Arthur.  There was an accident at the Ministry today and he was injured.  I know Harry would want to know.”
“It’s called a jumper, Father.”
“Oh, that’s pretty simple,” Harry frowned.  “I’ll have to come up with something simple like that.”
“I should think that, if anything, you would have clung tighter to what you had left,” Draco said. “But you left the house elves to deal with me.  And I never even understood why.”
After the meal, they rushed back to the common room to search for a book with hand-written details entitled Wand Game, on the last few pages.  Little did they know it would take them two and a half weeks to find it.  And another three to perfect the charms on the cauldron they would use to hold the wands.
Frowning, Draco answered, “I don’t know anything about a project.  I was trying to make you a calming draught.  You told me you’d been having trouble sleeping.  I wanted to get it finished so I could bring it to you last night.”
Harry reached around his back for Draco’s cock, but the angle was odd and he groped air instead.  Draco had purposely moved back and out of the way.
“I fuck men, Father.  What’s feminine about that?  I’m strong enough to handle a male lover, a male companion.  You need a soft, pliable woman to control.  I’d say you sound more like a sissy than me.”
“May I?” Harry held out his hand.
“Huh?”  Draco had no idea what cosmetology was.  “Is that some sort of space science?”
“I know.”
“Ah, willing to let fate choose for you.  You’re somewhat of a cynic aren’t you Harry?”
“Forget about it.  Just keep going,” Draco urged.
“How’s that?”
“You don’t want to do that,” Draco said before Harry let go of the piece.
Pursing his lips, Ron tried not to smile.  “Mione loves ‘em. I guess being a husband and father had changed me a bit.  Which is why I need time with my mates.  There are some things I can only talk about with you.”
“Everything is great,” Harry answered.
Greyback was a man with his back against the wall, fighting for his very life. Harry would have preferred to take him alive, to stand trial.  But he would kill him if he had to.  Harry’s own conscience and concern for Malfoy’s safety were hindrances the werewolf didn’t share.  Greyback was out for blood from the start and it only incensed him more that Draco, a Death Eater himself, was cooperating with the Dark Lord’s murderer.
“A word that sets you off.  And you won’t know what the word is until it happens. It would be something like wand, potion or spell, for example,” Pansy grinned.  “I came up with that one.”
He frowned.  “Last weekend, he told me he thought I was handsome during the game.  And he . . . well, you saw the position we were in the next morning.  Sure, he was totally pissed and under a spell.  But today, I swear, he was . . . flirting.   When did you–you know what, nevermind.  I don’t want to know.”
Harry politely asked her some well rehearsed questions about her job, hobbies and family life.  He found that in her spare time, she enjoyed the theater and read voraciously. She had two brothers, one of whom was also a wizard.  But he lived mostly in the muggle world as he was very close to the other brother.
Harry knew that wasn’t quite what Draco had in mind, but he seemed to understand that Harry needed to take things at his own pace.
Fleur kissed each of Draco’s cheeks as she greeted him. “Lovely to see you,” she said.
He kissed each one he found, and when he kissed them all, he moved to Draco’s light pink nipple.
Harry laughed, then realized he and Draco had just taken a big step in their relationship. Bigger than either of them had ever taken. His stomach fluttered.  He wondered, if he was this nervous about a few personal items, how Ron must have felt proposing marriage to Hermione.
“Mother, are you all right?”
Harry hadn’t thought about it before, but now that Draco mentioned it, he realized that he was going to miss their ‘date night’ as well.  At least Draco would have an opportunity to be alone in his dormitory.  And having that thought in his head, Harry had a feeling he was going to feel randy all weekend long with no relief in sight.
“We asked each other questions.  He sort of made it part of the game.  My requirement was to answer honestly.  I got to ask him a question for every one he asked me.”
Draco blushed.  He had momentarily forgotten Ron and Hermione were in the room when he teased Harry with his noodle eating skills.  He thought perhaps he had taken it a little too far.
Hermione pursed her lips and brushed a stray hair from Rose’s forehead. “Well, it isn’t as if Ron has never done that.”
The alcohol was beginning to hit Harry and he was getting fatigued.  “I want to go to sleep.”
“Really?” Draco blinked back tears.  “I thought . . . you were going to break up with me.  You were gone all weekend.  I thought you were looking for a new place to live.”
“Thank you,” Draco said to Ron.  “What about my father?”
“No, I’ve been considering it for some time,” he said.  “I think it’s best.”
Draco closed his eyes and allowed himself to get carried away.  As his own orgasm neared, he opened his eyes to watch Harry.
“Do you like it?” Parvati asked, spinning around and running her hands through her now, much shorter hair.
Cummins gazed into the expectant faces of the four Hogwarts students. Deciding not to add to their anxiety any further, he answered Ron’s question curtly.
“Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten about the Quidditch match.  I’ll be heartbroken,” Draco said dramatically.  It was saying things like that which kept Harry hoping, despite knowing what a flirt the man was.
Though he did want to say goodbye himself, especially to Molly and Arthur for hosting, Harry nodded. Draco’s demeanor told him that his husband may have been upset by the exchange with Ginny.
As if it were a race, and perhaps it was, Harry followed suit.  The pair watched one another as they stripped.
“Strawberries, lavender and cedar,” he answered. Glancing quickly at Hermione, Draco added, “We’d better make the rounds like everyone else.”
The conversation during the meal was dominated by babies, pregnancy and birth -- a subject which made more than one man at the table uncomfortable. After most of the food had been eaten, Molly began packing up some things for each of her children to take with them.  She handed Harry a small package of eggy bread for him and Draco to take back to Hogwarts.  While the women mostly stayed in the kitchen helping Molly or chatting, the men retired to the sitting room.
“Mione, remember the dream I told you about?  The one with Blaise and Draco talking like they were setting me up?”
“But I don’t have anything for you,” Harry said.  “I mean, I do, but not here.”
“Well, I don’t trust him either.” He jerked his head toward Malfoy.
Draco seemed more relaxed getting on the second ride and even kept his eyes open the whole time.  He wore a grin as he stepped out of his seat.
Draco said nothing, prompting Blaise to make another observation.
Hermione blushed. “Of course you can write about us.  We’re part of your story.  But what about . . .” She glanced at Draco, “the less flattering details of your relationships?”
“Fuck.  I don’t like this Harry,” Draco shouted, closing his eyes shut.
No one stepped forward at first.
“Knox, this is my friend Ron.”
“Okay, that
“There’s plenty of time to get two more shags in.”  Harry glanced at the clock.  “It’s only half-seven.”
“I’ll find some water.  Where’s the kitchen?”
“You told me to what?”
“I’m sorry I’m so late.  I had trouble with the hair color.  It kept coming out too purple.”
“Then maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing for the two of you to live apart while you sort things out.  Eventually, find a new place to start fresh, one that doesn’t harbor bad memories for either of you.”
“It’s been a while since you and I spent any time alone together,” Hermione commented as she and Harry strolled down Diagon Alley.  Small flurries fell from the cloudy grey sky dusting their hair lightly. The pair turned into Quality Quidditch Supplies and shook the snow from their hair.  A man, dressed in robes, quickly waved a wand at them.
“It doesn’t matter.” Blaise tried to walk into the castle.  Draco blocked his way.
Draco’s eyes sprung open and he watched as Harry touched the icy appendages to his warm full lips. Harry’s hot breath not only warmed up his hands, but the sensual manner in which he did it caused Draco’s heart rate to speed up a bit. Unfortunately, that wasn’t helping the situation. He closed his eyes again. He was so tired.
“Still following Quidditch?” Harry asked.
“Well, I do love Gin.  But, not that way.  I never felt about her the way I feel about you.”
“So, what do you want to talk about?” Harry smiled.
“Did it hurt to get your Dark Mark?”
“He’s too good for anyone.  But he’s chosen me,” Draco smirked.
Harry saw Ginny follow Blaise into the boy’s dormitory as the last few couples left the common room.
Blaise stared at Draco a moment.  “I don’t know how.   Not without hurting him anyway.  This way, he can be brassed for a while, then get over it.”
“He didn’t say,” Harry frowned.  That thought hadn’t occurred to him.  But surely the Healer would have mentioned it.  “Of course, we’d only do it if it were safe.”
“You’re not taking over my life.  I’m choosing to spend it with you,” Draco responded.  “If you’d rather not spend so much time with me--”
“No.”
Penelope shrugged.  “I’ve been told by boys that I’m . . . unfriendly.  But really, I’m just a little shy.”
Harry chuckled.  “I’m sure I would have done the same.  If Molly didn’t keep Ginny glued to her side after that.”
“Okay.” Harry leaned up to kiss him.  “I just want to tell everyone.  But I want to tell them first.”
Draco and Harry looked at each other. Apparently, no one took them seriously when they said they were planning to hyphenate their names.
“Not necessarily,” Draco corrected him.  “Though to some, price is all that matters.  Mother taught me that jewelry should suit the person wearing it, regardless of worth.”
“What does that mean?” Draco questioned.
Narcissa put on her best ‘Lucius face’ and imitated him, “Boy, you can’t have a pink room.  People would think you’re queer or something.”
“Only Astoria and Romilda made the cut,” Pansy told him.
“Yes.”
Harry quickly got up and stood, weak from hunger and thirst.  He had remembered to give Draco water, but hadn’t taken any for himself.
“I see what you’re saying,” Hermione nodded.  “Have you had any other recurring dreams?”
“We dozed off a bit while the babies were in their cots.  But once they were up for a feeding, we couldn’t put them down,” Harry said sheepishly.
Feeling more than a bit ashamed, Harry wanted to leave, but he was afraid Luna and Neville would hear their footsteps.  And admittedly, he was getting turned on.
He dimmed the lighting, stepped into the tub and held his hand out for Harry.  They settled into a corner as the water rose around them.
Ron shrugged.  “Maybe he had somewhere else to go.  I wasn’t really paying much attention.” He stood tall.  “I came in third.  Did you see?”
Ron and Anthony craned their necks to try and see around Pansy.

“Why, Harry, how lovely to see you.  Come in.”  Professor McGonagall stepped aside to allow Harry entrance.  “Is there something I can do for you?”
“What about a gun?  An outlaw has to have a gun,” Harry grinned.
“Ginny is pregnant.”
“Well, I think you should take him out.  I really like the story up until the drama with the cousin,” Draco said.
Mel pursed her lips.  “I don’t like wearing glamours.”  She shrugged, “But I enjoy being a girl.”  She retied her scarf.
She walked past him. “We won’t need it.”
“Well, no.  But he’ll do it for his best friend’s boyfriend,” Harry grinned.  “Please.  It’s worth a look.  If it wasn’t an accident . . .”
Harry cleared his throat.  “I, um, told Pansy to pack you up some food.  You must be hungry.”
“But?”
“Oh, I was just going to lock it magically,” Draco frowned.
“It’s after eight, Lav.  I’m not yours anymore.”  He wrestled his hand away and took a step toward Hermione.  “You look beautiful.”
“I had no idea how much I would enjoy that. You could almost make me cum just by doing that alone.”
“A Healer didn’t do it.  I did,” Harry grinned.
“Well, Anthony and I are still friendly,” Tracey said.  “Our relationship just fizzled.  Most teenage ones do, you know.”
Draco leaned closer to the mortified Fourth Year. “It’s all right.  I couldn’t help looking either. It was rather on display, wasn’t it?”
“I suppose I am the closest thing he had to a son.  And seeing as he had no remaining blood relations, I could be considered his next of kin,” Draco explained.  “Yes, I think Severus would have been proud to be included in your book.  Excuse me.”  Draco walked from the pair to look for Harry.  He found him speaking with Glenda Chittock, host of the WWN program, The Witching Hour.  Or rather, he was listening to her.  As she spoke for a living, it was what she did best.  And quite a lot of it.
“The Manor is yours to do with what you please.  Even ask me to leave.  I have no claim over this house,” Narcissa said.
“Very distant,” Draco corrected.  “Now he’s back here, teaching Charms.”
“I only want you to be happy, Harry.  Perhaps, you and Draco can make new memories there.  Don’t turn it down on my account.”
“My side?  There is only one side,” Lucius said. “What happened, happened.  They are facts, not my view or opinion.”
“Well, clearly you’ve interrupted.  And we need to bathe now.”  He leaned and kissed the side of Harry’s neck, never taking his eyes off Knox’s.  He wanted to make it quite clear that Harry was his, and his alone.
“Hmph!” One of the prickly old men at the card table scoffed.  “He should be so lucky.”
“Your mother must have been quite extraordinary.”  He held out the tome for Harry to take.  “You should keep it.”
“Yes, I must be,” Draco said.  The look in his eye made Harry think he wasn’t talking about food.
“Yeah, thanks Hermione,” Ron said sarcastically under his breath.
“I know,” Ron agreed.  “But maybe this will tell us if we really want to be together or not.”
“So, is Harper . . . a willing participant?”
“Forgive me for being so bold, Harry, but I need to know what your intentions are.”
“How is everything going?” Harry asked. He didn’t want to say it, but Ron looked like shite.
Draco, on the other hand seemed to revel in his disarray.  He grinned widely at Hermione as he picked up his chair and sat down.  “Perhaps we ought to call it a night, Potter.”  He began to gather up the parchments and put them in his black bag.  “I’ll copy this onto our essay before Wednesday.”
don’t.”
“No, we wouldn’t,” Draco said, turning serious.  “Even if we found each other attractive enough to shag, it wouldn’t have lasted.  I changed because of the things that happened during and after the war, mostly the bad things.  I know it sounds terrible not to wish them away, but I don’t.”
Draco scratched his head, unsure whether or not she was serious. After a moment, he shrugged and sat down in the chair vacated by Hermione.
Draco grinned widely.  “We won!” he said to Harry as if Harry hadn’t figured it out.  On impulse, Draco grabbed either side of Harry’s face and kissed him squarely on the lips.  “You’re brilliant,” he proclaimed.
“Oh, muggle costumes.”
Shaking her head, Olivia reported nothing.  “Most of the time, the things that appear in the leaves are the things we are most concerned with.  Perhaps, right now, you are more anxious about a career than a family.  You’re just a boy, after all.”
“Oh.  I didn’t know anyone was here,” Draco turned to look at Harry.  “Wait, you didn’t go to the party?”
hdhdhd
Draco relaxed and let a smile cross his face.  Harry always knew exactly what to say.  He leaned back and turned so he could face Harry.
The following week brought a bit of peace for Harry.  The inspired favor he had asked Draco on Sunday had proved useful, as the more Harry thought about it, the more he thought it was actually a good idea.  The two planned a day for Draco to come to Harry’s DADA class and talk about the dark times when the Death Eaters took over his family’s manor.  They both seemed to forget about the uncomfortable encounter at Draco’s door, and things had gone back to the way the were before Harry’s date with Althea.  Harry decided to settle for Draco’s company in any form it came.  If they were to remain friends, Harry would just have to learn to get over his crush.
“I told her that you had everything under control, Draco,” Harry said, trying to smooth things over.
“No.  You can’t wish away the bad without wishing away the good,” Harry said. “Everything that happened to us, lead us here, to right now.”
Draco chuckled. “Who would have thought I’d grow a conscience?  She also reminded me that the right thing wasn’t always easy.”
Harry kissed him gently.  “You are worthy.”
It was then that Harry noticed the two items in Draco’s hands.  A book and the one-third full bottle of firewhiskey.
“Pansy,” he said quietly.
“I assumed I was getting Snape’s office,” Malfoy snapped.
“What?  You’re not seriously thinking of going,” Hermione said, crossing her arms.
“I don’t deserve your trust anymore.  Probably not your forgiveness either.  But I’m going to do everything I can to earn it.  I need to prove to you that I’m committed, to only you.”
“Merlin, was that your first . . . Draco, why didn’t you tell me?”
“And even if you did have ugly scars, it wouldn’t matter to me.  I’m hardly one to judge someone else’s looks,” Harry smirked.
Even Christmas break had been uneventful, save for one small incident involving mistletoe.  One of the students conjured it in hopes of catching the girl of his fancy underneath it.  However, when Harry found himself standing under the kissing plant, he awkwardly laughed it off before Knox could get any ideas. And the rest of the holiday passed without incident.
“It doesn’t.  Of course, you won’t be any worse for wear, I’m sure.”
“My intentions for what?” he asked.
Opening one eye and smirking, Draco replied, “Purple.  I hope to show you the exact shade next time we’re at the manor.”
Draco remained quiet, biting his bottom lip.
“Should I go with you?”
“Really? Are you still going to pretend not to know? Especially under these circumstances.”
me Potter,” Draco was pushing him down until Harry finally fell off the couch and onto his bottom.
Draco unbuttoned his own trousers, revealing a bit of lacy pink fabric.  “I sort of took the liberty.”
“Why wouldn’t I?”
“Draco, what are you doing here?  Did McGonagall change her mind?” Harry took his hand.  “Not that I’m not glad you’re here.”
“Mmm, what were you thinking about all day” Draco asked into Harry’s open mouth.
*****
“So, you’ve never been in Gryffindor?” Ginny awkwardly asked the Slytherins.  The entire group, sitting scattered around the room, sipped butter beer or firewhiskey or pumpkin juice quietly.  Every so often, someone would make some mundane observation or ask an impersonal question.  But for the most part, they simply glanced around at one another.
“Leave us alone, Boot,” Draco hissed.  “I’ll remove the charm, but if you ever do anything like that to Harry again, I’ll do a lot worse.”
“Yes, but that was before the twins,” Draco pointed out.
“We’re going to test it for Dark Magic.”
“So, you think your dreams are prophetic, but only to a point.”
Harry looked between the two.  “I take it, you didn’t care much for each other.”
“Thank you for bringing this to my attention Professor Knox.  I will.”
Harry leaned over. “They’re not making fun. It’s just that Molly has a reputation for going a bit over the top.”
Hermione also ended up purchasing Liquorice Wands along with some Pumpkin Pasties.
“It makes perfect sense,” Harry smiled. “Somehow, the pair of you make perfect sense.”
“Only because you wanted to make me happy,” Draco pointed out. “However, in the long run, you probably would have become resentful.”  He held up his hand to keep Harry from interrupting. “I know you don’t think so now. But, my love, how can we make each other happy if we’re unhappy ourselves?”
“Dra, don’t ever run away again.”
Harry took Draco’s hand and pulled him out of the path of other patrons after getting bumped into again.
He closed his eyes and sighed contentedly, falling back asleep shortly after.
“What?  If you can’t tell me, who can ya tell?  I’m picking wildflowers for Merlin’s sake. How can I judge?”
“Um, I suppose we could go to the Gryffindor common room,” Ginny replied.
“Would you . . . will you . . . um.”
“Draco, I’m so fucking close.” Harry began to lean back and pull out.
“Not to Ron and Mione.  Not to the Weasleys,” Harry told him.
hdhdhd
Harry froze for a minute.  Things were moving a little faster than he expected.
Just as they were ready to leave, a knock came on the door. Harry answered it, curious as to who would be calling on him.
“I mean, it’s yours.”
“Dra?  Is it okay if I come in?”
“I will.”
When he returned, Harry was biting his lip, sitting on the sofa.
Hesitantly, Draco sat back down, and the six friends began to eat.  Harry told the rest of them what happened with the Ravenclaws outside the hall.
Draco stepped to his left just enough to reveal himself to Ron, and the ginger dropped to the floor. At the same instance, Draco cast the killing curse at the Death Eater in front of him.  Before the curse could reach its target, the man disapparated, along with the other that Hermione had Stupified. Draco’s curse shattered the cabinet in front of the sink.
Ron snorted, “I don’t need to buy Hermione second-hand jewelry.  I worked at George’s shop over the summer.  I have money.”
hdhdhd
“Um, he’s really quite open about his experiences with the Dark Lord,” he replied.  “I had him come to a couple of classes to speak about it with the older students.”
Draco’s nose wrinkled at Harper’s nickname for Blaise.  He never thought it suited Zabini.  “Well, maybe he’s right.  I mean, Blaise is planning to move to Romania to work with dragons, and you’re . . . what
Harry quickly came up with an excuse.  “Draco here was helping me with another lesson.”
“Well, I was supposed to help with your essay.  He said he couldn’t find enough information about sopophorous.”
“No, it’s fine.”
“There are those that would disagree. I’ve heard that squibs are nature’s way of telling a wizard couple they shouldn’t procreate.”
“What?” Harry exclaimed.  “What do you mean, you’ve suspected for a while?  I’ve only
“Nearly a year.”
He was secretly disappointed that Molly refused to give her up and instead took Rose into the kitchen to feed her.  By then, Narcissa and Lucius had gone, and Harry was still off somewhere with Ron.  Babette was fast asleep in the corner of the room, completely knackered from chasing sticks and balls.  Dominique was in a similar state.
“What?  Oh, yeah.”  Harry recalled humoring the witch before the beginning of the year with a reading of his tea leaves.  She told him he would never find true love until he removed the mask he wore to protect his heart, and fully accepted himself as he was.  Only then would he find the love of his life.  It sounded a bit generic to Harry, although he understood the personal meaning for himself.  He thought the advice could apply to just about anyone, and dismissed it.
Ron stood, looming over the reporter.  “Since when is being gay a scandal?  You print one word harming Harry in any way, the Ministry will come down on you so hard, you’ll never crawl back out.”
The blond stood a moment longer, staring at Harry.
“That was cruel,” Draco breathed.
Ron had made plans to help Anthony Goldstein work on their Defense Against the Dark Arts project. And the pair headed for the library earlier that evening.  Hermione, unable to concentrate on her own studies, decided to steal Ron away from Anthony for some much needed one on one time.
Harry shook his head.  “Eventually?  After I’d missed all the important stuff?  I understand what you’re thinking.  I understand that you even think you were doing the right thing for me.  But it isn’t.  I was raised by people other than my parents.  I’m not about to let my own children go through that.  It’s not a reflection on you, but I can’t do it.”
Draco turned to get more punch after the way cleared a bit.
“No offense,” Ron said.
“It was really very kind of your parents to let us stay here tonight,” Hermione said to Draco.
“Well, don’t do it here.  I’ll take you back to the castle.”
Draco’s brow furrowed.  “But you always wore hand me downs that were too big for you.  And you never seemed to have any nicer things.  The pocket watch you carry is dented.”
Clicking his heels on the stone floor, Harry swiftly made his way up the stairs from the dungeons to the sixth floor to drop off Draco’s bags. Thinking on how Draco thanked him sincerely, Harry figured he was speaking specifically about welcoming him into the castle and offering to help him get settled in.  His former rival’s face said it went much deeper than that.
“What’s so funny?”  Draco asked.
“Sorry?” Harry was a bit indignant.
“I suppose you’ll be wanting to work with Ginger, then.”
“Draco,” Harry finally broke the silence. “I need to know.” He paused, knowing that Draco’s answer could completely change the nature of their relationship one way or another. But he didn’t think they could go back to the pretense of obliviousness they once had. The innocence of cautious flirtation was now behind them. “Did you really mean what you said in the Manor? I need to know, one way or the other.”
Wiping his brow, Harry took a moment to gather himself.  “Yeah, yeah.  I just had a bad dream is all.”
He sighed. “I guess I’m feeling left out.”
He took his time, worshipping her body, massaging and caressing every part of her.  In time, she was soothed enough for him to enter her again.  Taking it very slowly, he inched further and further, distracting her with gentle touches elsewhere.
“Dean,” Dean reminded him.
“You swallowed?”
“No.  Well, actually, since you’re here, you can help.  But that’s not what I wanted to ask you.”
“What’s a wand party?” Blaise asked.
“All right,” Harry growled.
Smiling, Draco rolled to his side and hovered over his lover.
He hadn’t intended to fall asleep.  It wasn’t that Harry’s story wasn’t interesting.  It was habit to fall asleep while reading on the sofa with Harry, and it seemed that habit was fairly ingrained at this point.
“You may call me Draco. And I was looking for a please.”
When Harry walked into the sitting room, George and Charlie were having a quiet discussion about the new dragons that were born only two months ago. Arthur was listening, munching away on pumpkin bread. Ron was doing the same, resembling his father more than ever before.
They continued, until breathing through his nose no longer provided enough oxygen for Draco. Concerned he may pass out, he broke off the kiss and touched his forehead to Harry’s, panting.
“Lying?  About what?”
“Yeah, but then I have a date to screw the hell out of my boyfriend.  And he’ll be oh-so-grateful that I’m making an effort with his friends.”  He grinned and winked.  Blaise mimed sticking his finger down his throat.
“Fuck.  I’m sorry.”
“Of course you could. You kept bugging me about the books,” Ron announced. “That’s all you talked about. How many books, what kinds, were they being cared for properly.”
Bit by bit, Harry rolled in his spot until he came face to face with Draco.  The small amount of friction was enough to bring his cock to life.  He planted a kiss on Draco’s neck.  When that didn’t wake the blond, he sucked on the skin, nipping just slightly.
“His arrogance is unwarranted. He’s just a Beater. But you have every right to be conceited.” He whispered, “You’re practically perfect.”
“No, I’m not ashamed.  I try to keep my private life private.  You of all people know that.  I simply saw no reason to announce it.  Did you have to announce that you are heterosexual to the world?”
“No.  I can handle it.”  Draco paused.  “In a way, he reminds of myself when I was young.”
Though Draco didn’t consider being gay a choice, he decided to let the comment pass, for the time being.  That was an entirely different conversation. And he and his father had finally found some common ground beyond polite tolerance.
Hermione’s eyes widened, but she swiftly composed herself.  “Really?  But you’ve been seeing each other for two months now.”
“It was some sort of cutting spell.  The others weren’t injured too badly.  But it hit Arthur’s leg in a bad spot.  He’s lost a lot of blood.”
Hermione rolled her eyes at Ron. “So, what change of plans do you need?”
He paired Casper with a boy he knew to be meticulous, hoping it would rub off on the boy.
“What’s your hurry?” Draco whispered.  “I want to fuck for as long as we can.”
“I didn’t hide my money there, if that’s what you’re insinuating.”
“He’s not your replacement.  He’s a temporary substitute.  But he’s okay I guess. The students haven’t complained.”
Draco turned away as he zipped up his trousers. “I . . . you took it from me,” he said quietly. “I feel . . .”
“You’ll be bunking with some of yer seventh years, I reckon,” Hagrid told her.  “You know, we never had a class of Eighth Years.  But I suppose yer not really Eighth Years, since they didn’t teach nothin’ worth learnin’ last year anyway.”  Hagrid scratched his head.  He was confusing himself even.  “Well, I’m off to see to the first years.”
“Professor Malfoy is doing a splendid job with a student who would otherwise fall through the cracks,” Harry defended.
“Yes,” the girl said.  “Occasionally we’ll get muggle items in here. I’ve seen one of those that you’re talking about.  But this one is magical, of course.  The story goes that when he gave the pin as a gift, it wouldn’t open.  It meant that his love wasn’t truly returned.”
“I remember you spending a lot of time in a sitting room,” Draco said absently.  “I was always told not to disturb you.  I was only allowed in if I was quiet, so I made sure to find something to do.  Usually reading.  Father was always asking if you needed anything, covering you with a blanket, or stroking your hair.  Things I wished he’d done for me. All he ever did was make me practice potions.”
know.  And why do you keep changing it from mother to other.  Other what?”
“Shush,” Molly scolded. “We’re trying to listen,” she whispered.
Actually, it was quite hot.
“And you seem determined to hate it.”
“No, I like the glasses.”
“I didn’t know it was a race,” Harry said.
“Okay.”  To the student, Draco said, “Come on, Rhonwen, show me which painting the berk is in.”
Harry politely declined at the look of panic on Ron’s face.
“Good night, then,” Draco nodded.
“And you’ve done this before?”
Harry smiled at his adopted family. He felt as much a Weasley as any of them, even without the ginger hair. Taking a step toward Draco with his plate, he stopped for a moment. Draco hadn’t noticed him, and was tenderly smoothing the hair away from Dominique’s face.  Their positions had changed slightly from when Harry left the room, and the toddler was now siting fully on Draco’s lap with her head cradled in the crook of his arm.
“Then it’s settled,” Draco smiled.  “Going in to supper?”
to study,” he offered nervously.
happened to you at Ginny and Dean’s wedding.”
“Absolutely,” Harry said.  “You’ll not only apologize for this latest slander, but you’ll also apologize for those series of articles you wrote about Draco a few years back.”
“I don’t.”
October 21 1998
He appeared surprised.  “You didn’t? Why not?”
“I was in Slytherin for two years.  Hardly worthy of my loyalty.  I’m merely rooting for the team I think is better.  There’s nothing wrong with recognizing good talent.”
Tentatively, Hermione and Ron walked through the door.  Having a child themselves, they knew to enter a room quietly.  Harry walked over to them, a blanket-swaddled infant in his arms.
Pansy rolled her eyes.  “Yeah, walk in on us talking,” she chuckled.  “Although that would be shocking, to find you actually talking to a girl.”
A soft knock came at his door.  Harry opened his eyes, seeing nothing but the darkness of his desk. Whoever it was would surely go away if Harry didn’t respond.  He closed his eyes again.
Feeling a bit of empathy for Harper, Draco brought his arms around the younger boy’s shoulders.
Harry pushed his hood off his head and cast a Lumos charm so the man could get a good look at his scar.
“You what?”
As fate would have it, Professor Slughorn was rounding the corner, whistling a happy tune.
She burst out laughing, thinking that he was going to ask her something a bit more personal.
“You know how muggles can be,” Molly smiled.  “Oh, look,” she said, peering over Dean’s shoulder.  “There they are.”
*****
Harry stood, or tried to.  He then crawled his way to the couch, Draco following behind him for fear of spewing half a bottle of firewhiskey all over the common room floor.  They both had barely made it to the couch before passing out.
“What took you so long?” Draco murmured.
“Oh, all right,” Harry said. “You didn’t really need to say goodbye yet.  We’ll see you in the morning, yeah?”
“You gave the interview, didn’t you?  You told me you wouldn’t.”
“Conjure some rope.  Tie my hands to the head board.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth raised, just a bit.  “All right,” he called after Harry.  “I suppose we should work on that paper.  Sorry Pans.”
“No, I can’t witness that train wreck.”
“You know, if Harry’s book is successful, neither one of you may need to go back to teaching,” Hermione said. “And muggle movies are big business.  You could become quite wealthy.”
“Sorry.  Weasley tradition.  You’re one of us now, and you have to celebrate your birthday with the family,” Harry told him.  “Besides, Molly was horrified that she missed it last year and she wants to make up for it.”
What have I done? he thought.
“I didn’t know who you were for sure, at first,” Parvati admitted.  “But when we danced close together, I could smell your cologne.”
Draco threw his arms around him.  “Oh, thank you, Harry.  It will be perfect.  But we must send out owls this afternoon.  I brought the invitations Mother had made.  She’s sent them out to my family and their circle of friends.  I have a list of friends, which is very short, actually.  So, you just need to decide who you’d like to invite.  I’ll help you.”
Harry nodded.  “As I’ll ever be.  Are you certain you can get me through the wards?” 	“Let’s find out,” Draco smiled.
Ron shrugged.  “How bad could that be?”
The broad smile on Knox’s face faded as he took in Harry’s expression.  At first, he thought perhaps Draco and Harry had fought, and the object of his crush was coming to him for comfort.  But the thin-lipped frown on Harry’s face told him that was not the case.
“What exactly?” the Healer wanted to know.
“Let me kiss it then, and make it all better.”  Harry sank to his knees to unzip Draco’s trousers. He kissed the hard cock through the pants.
“Yes.  Granger as well. I feel a bit more confident on that front,” Draco told him.  “I think maybe I scared Weasley–Ron, off at that impromptu get together a couple of weeks ago.  I vaguely remember putting my arm around him,” Draco laughed.
Draco was able to coax Harry out of his melancholy with a few well-placed kisses as he pulled him into their bed chamber . . .
“We’re going to meet in the library at half-seven.”
“Fuck.  I’m sorry,” Draco said, embarrassed for spitting in Harry’s hair.  “Maybe we should take turns in the bath.”
“You really take good care of me.” Harry kissed his cheek.  “Do I do enough for you?”
“Me too.  It’ll get better.”
“Really Ron,” Hermione sighed.  “She’s notorious for fudging facts and even outright lying.”
“What is it?” Lucius wrinkled his nose.
The rest of the day, Harry insisted that nothing was wrong.  No matter how much his friends asked, he told them he was fine.  Ron was perfectly happy to accept it and went about his day as usual. Hermione, of course, wasn’t buying it for a minute.
Rita turned to Duchess.  “Don’t write that.”  To Harry she implored, “Can’t we at least be civil?”
Harry watched Draco’s face as he came and simultaneously felt the warm stickiness on his hand. The expression on the blond’s face could only be described as bliss. And Harry put it there. The Auror tenderly kissed the rosebud lips, extricated himself and lay down next to Draco on the bed.
“No clever comeback?  I’m who I always was. I never pretended to be more.  I thought you accepted that.  Ever since Knox came into the picture, you’ve acted like I was being unreasonable, like I was a paranoid, insecure prat.   And after all your protests, you were unfaithful.  Some hero.”
“She actually went out with me.  The date was just as awkward, though.  I was always so awkward with the girls.”
Before Harry reached the door, Draco’s voice called weakly, “Hello? Miss Gwilt?”
“Well, Harry, I’m not getting any younger,” Flitwick answered.  “I’d like to do some traveling.  Maybe even to America.  It just seemed like a good time.”
“Come on Harry.  I know you’ve always tried to downplay it to spare my feelings, but James and Lily are yours. They’re the children in your dreams.”
“Really mate?” Ron raised his eyebrows at Harry’s ridiculous suggestion.  “You’re the fucking Chosen One.  What bird in her right mind wouldn’t want to go out with you?” He shook his head in disbelief. “You’re too modest for your own good. You could get anyone you wanted.”
someone asks.  That would be the question on everyone’s lips.  He didn’t know if he should admit to the relationship or act as though Draco simply got caught up in the moment.  He needed desperately to talk to the Slytherin before someone cornered him.  Unfortunately for Harry, having to clean up by himself kept him in the classroom much longer than usual.  But he was nearly finished.
Draco didn’t get a chance to finish that thought as his climax washed over him.  His body stiffened and he clutched Harry’s hair tightly.
“It’s called Colossus.”
“Mione, wait.”
“Hello,” a short, fair-haired witch smiled as she walked in. “I’m Ms. Singleton.”
“A little, I think.” Draco’s voice was back to its weakened state.
Harry sighed.  “I know Mione means well, but I think I can choose my own company.  I wish she’d just leave it.”
Draco plopped Harry’s manuscript on the desk.
Stepping out onto the paved patio, Harry could see why Draco didn’t bother conjuring flowers.  Surrounding the terrace were rose bushes of every color imaginable, delphiniums and petunias and lavender orchids.  He gazed around in awe.
“Pudding!” she called out.
Harry sat up.  “Why can’t you let this go?  It’s probably far in the future.”
When they stopped, Draco quickly unzipped the fly of Harry jeans and popped the button.  He slipped his hand inside. Harry groaned when Draco’s fingers wrapped around his half hard cock.
, a smut magazine featuring large breasted witches in compromising positions. He paused briefly to acknowledge the pair.
“Hm, who was it that timed the flobberworm mucus perfectly?”
“I was just asking if--”
“A gift?”
“That’s not what I was going to say,” Harry protested.
I hope this letter finds you well.  I have appreciated your correspondence over the years and regret that I have not returned a letter in quite some time.  I have been spending the past four months at Beauxbatons, student teaching Potions classes with Professor Olivier.  This brings me to the reason for my letter.  I have heard that Professor Slughorn has announced his retirement and I would like to be considered for the position.  I realize that, as a former Death Eater, I am not going to be anyone’s first choice.  However, I have worked very hard to turn my life around, as you know.  All I am asking is for a chance to pay forward the debt I incurred during and after the war.  I will not let you down if I am given this opportunity.
Growing ever more anxious about going to Malfoy Manor, Harry hadn’t heard when Ron continuously called his name. A gentle hand on his cheek brought him out of his trance.
Dean drew his brows together.  “She didn’t invite me.”
“As long as she realizes it’s also your baby.”
“I’ll need to go to the business offices at the Ministry,” she said to no one in particular. “They’ll have a listing of agencies that deal in adoption and surrogacy.  Then I’ll try St. Mungo’s. They may also be able to help.  If we have to, we could always explore the muggle world.”
January 2 1999
“Can I get either of you a butter beer?” Ron offered.
“Hardly seems even,” Draco said, still looking at the gloves.
“Why don’t we just sit on the floor around the coffee table?” She suggested.
“I did?  Are you sure?”
“Inside, the Manor looks quite different from when the Dark Lord took over.  Mother has done some renovations.  I still wouldn’t call it cheery.  But it’s not nearly as creepy as it was.”
a mask.  Are you wearing dress robes or a costume?”
“Oh, there are worse things as punishments,” Harry chuckled.  “But, why don’t you simply have them write essays? It’ll be easier on you.  You can even take them to your office and get some work done.”
“I agree,” Draco gazed into green eyes that seemed to be brighter than they were a moment ago.  “And I know just how I want to spend that energy,” he leered.  “But I need your permission.”
“Out in the courtyard.  It’s getting quite cold outside.”
“I won’t tell anyone, Harry.  I’ll even cover for you with Ron.  You’re meeting someone, aren’t you?”
“Perfect,” Professor Slughorn announced.  “Well done Mr. Malfoy.  You have won the first prize of the year–a box of assorted candies from Honeydukes.”
“You only think it’s horrible because you used it on
“The mum is ginger.  She’d been coloring her hair blonde though,” Harry explained.  “We thought it was a strong possibility that one or both of them would be a head red.  He’ll fit right in at family gatherings.”
Ron pursed his lips in disappointment.
“No, I heard you,” Harry interrupted.  “I, I thought you wanted me to be the one . . . you know, who takes it,” he said in all sincerity, looking down embarrassedly at his hands.
“So what are you going to do?” Ron asked.
Not liking the look on Harry’s face, Draco looked instead at his own fingernails.  His heart started to beat a bit faster as if he knew what Harry was going to say, but he couldn’t acknowledge it.
“I’m sure I mentioned their visit,” Harry said.  “I’m planning on telling them today.”
“Of course they can.” Draco was indignant.
“Me too,” Harry said.
“Wait, you know each other?”
He gently ran his fingers over the spot. The blond’s pale skin was ice cold, even under a shirt and jumper. Harry then suddenly remembered something else from his basic healer training using muggle methods.
“I want to make everyone jealous,” Harry said.  “Except Ron and Hermione.  I feel badly that they can’t take a holiday this year.  But with Rose still so little, it would be more work than a holiday.  At least we won’t have to worry about that.”
Draco nodded. “Mmmm.”
Breaking the kiss, Draco leaned back.  “You did finish, didn’t you?”
He didn’t wait for a reply and took Harry by the elbow to lead him away.
“Harry,” Ginny shook him awake.  “You fell asleep again.”
Draco glanced down.  “Oh, I will get to all of it.”
Narcissa looked around the room.  She was a little disappointed to see that the guests had formed smaller cliques throughout, rather than branching out and mingling.  She supposed she couldn’t expect people such as the Parkinsons to interact with Hermione’s muggle relatives. She sighed and weaved through the guests looking for her son.
“Thanks Jenkins,” Harry smiled and waved, then continued to walk hand in hand with Draco to the front door of the Manor.
“I’m getting some lube,” Draco whispered behind him.  He tugged at Harry with renewed fervor.  With all the attention Harry had gotten to arouse him, it didn’t take long for him to spill out onto the bed and Draco’s hand.  Draco scooped up as much of the jit as he could and rubbed it on his erection.
“That’s the spirit,” Harry said.  “You and your father seem to have made great strides.”
Draco grinned.  “You really don’t remember?”  Harry shook his head.  “You, um, got me in a bit of a state, and then passed out on me.  You left me more than just a bit frustrated,” Draco snickered.
“The sign a little way back said it was an hour from that point. So, I’d guess from here it’s about forty minutes.”
Harry raised his eyebrows.
As they walked, something had been nagging Harry, and he finally decided to bring it up.
“It’s an old muggle saying. And it means that, instead of retaliating against those injustices you feel, live your life to the fullest.  Don’t let them bring you down.  You have come a long way in the past year, Draco. Keep moving forward. Don’t let people such as Terry Boot bring you down.”
“But I’m not gay.  I don’t want to be Anthony’s partner.”
Alastair, the student next to Casper, nudged him when Draco walked away.  “Oi, when did you suddenly become a swot?”
Harry’s demeanor softened. “Do you know where he is?”
“Oh, are we trying again for that record?”
“We are,” Harry answered.
“Go ahead then, get stuck with some rich bint you don’t love or even like.  You’ll be led by the nose for the rest of your life, for money.  You’ll sacrifice your happiness.  For money.”
“I saw Malfoy kiss you in class.  What I
“Yeah.  Or something,” he said noncommittally.
Draco laughed.  “Is that the best you can come up with? I all but called you a coward.”
The girls left Harry and Draco for the other end of the common room.  The boys didn’t have the privacy Harry wished they did, but no one appeared to be paying too much attention to them.  Draco sat down in Pansy’s previous spot.
Harry blinked as if it were an absurd question. Why on earth would he not be happy with Draco?
Harry smiled sadly. “Thanks.  But I’ve heard from nearly every agent I queried.  Maybe it’s just no good.”
Draco, in turn, gave Harry the once over.  His hair was disheveled a bit, but it normally looked that way.  He shrugged.  “Your hair is a little messy.”
“There were seven.  But Fred . . . died in the last battle,” Harry answered.
“What the devil?” Draco muttered.
“It was special fucking cake.  She got mad at me because . . . never mind.”
“And thank you for trying to get rid of Rita Skeeter.”
“Who are you?” she furrowed her brow.
“Oh.  Did you see anything else?”  Harry asked.
“No, I have not.”
“You’re educating me.  What about last night?  You don’t seem to have any boils today.”
“Thank you.  But it really wasn’t necessary,” Harry smiled nervously.
“This is becoming a habit,” Draco smirked as he walked into his dormitory to find Pansy siting on his bed.
Ron led Knox away, leaving Harry to wonder what the man had done, or knew about. With no other recourse, he went down the staircase and proceeded to the Great Hall for lunch once more.
Harry sighed.  “No.  And it’s coming up on ten o’clock.  Maybe he decided not to come.”
“Ah!  There he is!” A voice called from the front of the pub.
Draco bolted up.  “Way past curfew.”  He pulled his wand from the side pocket on his jeans and performed a Scourgify on both of them, then proceeded to pull up his trousers.  Harry stole a glance at Draco’s package as it disappeared behind the denim. He dressed, then Vanished the pillows and pad, while Draco removed the silencing and locking charms.  The pair gathered their belongings and peered into the corridor.  Finding it empty, they stepped out of the Potions classroom.
“You’re thanking me?”
“I can’t.  Not in front of everyone,” he sighed.
“Draco?  Are you okay?”
Running a hand across Harry’s chest, Draco breathed, “You’re so hot when you’re all sweaty.”
hdhdhd
“I suppose,” she grumbled. “I don’t know how I’m going to last another seven weeks like this.”
“You all right?” Draco asked.
At last he found himself standing in front of Draco’s door.  Doubt crept its way into his mind and he faltered for a moment.  Then he knocked and waited.
Obliging, the brunet gripped the back of his own legs and held them open.  He couldn’t help the sound that escaped his lips as he felt something wet and firm, yet not stiff, poking at his entrance. When Draco wiggled his tongue, Harry gasped.
“Ron, come here. They want pictures of the pair of us,” Hermione called.
Draco resumed sliding up and down, while Harry stroked him in the same rhythm.  Gazing at one another, they each sped up their actions, reading the unspoken need of the other.
“Yeah, I guess it’s coming a little sooner than I thought.  But Hermione and I have been together for six years.  We’re ready.”
Harry frowned.  “Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea.  It’s equally irresistible as Veritaserum.”
“Are you all right?  Just relax baby.”
Before getting up, Ginny leaned toward Harry.  “Can I talk to you?”
Knox needed something else to keep Harry’s attention.
She reached out for the book to examine, turning it over in her hands, running her fingers over the binding.
“Yeah. You said she fell at the last Quidditch Match?”
want?”
She downed the last of her tea and put her cup down.  Clara was immediately by her side, refilling it.
“Ron, isn’t it worth it if Draco and his mother are safe and another Death Eater is behind bars?”  Hermione asked.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “Congratulations.  You two must be so happy.”
“There, that’s better,” Harry smiled.
Hermione continued.  “Just remember that the most costly method isn’t necessarily the best for you.”
“You’re going to have to drag me.  I’m afraid I won’t be much help,” Draco told Harry. He clutched his stomach and groaned.
hdhdhd
“No, I’m all right.  I just need ice or something,” Harry insisted.
“Bollocks.  I don’t know much about binding, but I know that you can’t do it by accident.”  Ron crossed his arms over his chest, thinking Harry was lying to him.
“It’s very colorful,” Harry noted.  He glanced at a black and white photograph hanging over the toilet.  “Who is that?”
“Wait, not that piece,” Ron said as Harry pierced the cake.
“Meaning?” asked Lucius.
“I came here three times tonight looking for you.”  Draco crossed his arms over his chest.  “And no one I asked had seen you.”
“So, you’re the new bloke,” Draco said.
“As reported by me in yesterday’s Prophet, you have been seen in the company of Draco Malfoy, a Death Eater, in a compromising position.  Would you care to comment on that?”
Harry took Draco’s hands in his and drew a deep breath.  “I’m asking you to marry me.”
“No, the children were more or less the same age in all the dreams.  Why?”
Harper watched Draco leave, hopeful that Blaise’s best friend would somehow get through to him.
“Then you should feel fabulous right now,” joked Harry.  He moaned, and moved his hips to meet Draco’s stroking.
When he got down to the Great Hall, most of the other staff were already there, and the food had appeared only moments earlier.
“A loveless life,” Pansy added.
On impulse, he leaned forward and kissed her.  It wasn’t anything special or particularly long. It was really sort of stiff. When he pulled back, she was clearly stunned.
Harry grinned.  “He’s right Mione.  You should.  Zabini as well.  We all ought to make an effort.”
“I thought that once you had a taste, you would have gotten him out of your system,” Blaise said.  “All these years, I figured it was just lust after something you couldn’t have.  But you really love him, don’t you?”
“Stop.  I’m ready to cum.  But I want to wait for you.”
“I mean, if a person
“Is there a problem?” Harry asked, concerned.
“Not implying, saying. Draco was caught up in his family’s involvement but his loyalty did not lie with Voldemort.  I have gotten to know Draco on a personal level, far removed from the duress of war.  The kindness, friendship and affection he has shown me has touched me deeply.  And I love him for it.”
“The English wizarding world isn’t that big. I saw a lot of the same faces often.”
Lifting his head up, Harry captured Draco’s lips as the pair rubbed against one another until Draco was as hard as Harry. Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, pulling him even harder against him. They snogged and ground in a frenzy, oblivious to a peculiar soft clicking sound and muffled voices.
“The best time would be as soon as possible,” Draco answered.
“There are other students staying.  I won’t be alone.  And you’re still meeting me for supper at the Weasley’s house, right?”
Draco simply stared.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said.  “I shouldn’t have said that.”
Desperate to make a break for the front door, where the wards were most forgiving, Greyback blasted the wall near Harry, effectively shutting him off from himself and Malfoy.  Draco took advantage of the distraction and came out of his place of relative safety to cast a disarming spell. He wasn’t quick enough.
Clearly, Harry’s efforts to keep their marriage and private life private had proven successful.  Of course, rumors were always circling about.  But Rita Skeeter did not get an exclusive interview about the wedding and all she had was speculation.  Neither Harry nor Draco’s names had appeared in print in months.  Draco suspected that the higher-ups in the Ministry didn’t pay much attention to the gossip columns anyway.
That was gone now.  Harry leaned forward on the desk and rested his forehead on his arms. He couldn’t keep his eyes open.
Hermione blushed and Ron gave out a small, shameful giggle.
Harry was pleased by the vague question. “Sort of.  I’m still getting used to it. But I do like it.”
“Yes.  As long as Harry and Dean’s magical frequencies are different enough, we should be able to rule one of them out.”
Draco kissed the side of Harry’s head.  “The important thing is that we’re together.”
Ron laughed. “Only if he makes me less of a dolt sometimes.”
Harry leaned his head back against the cold, stone wall and closed his eyes.
Not giving Harry a choice, he took him by the hand and led him into the crowd just as the music slowed down.  Harry glanced around uncomfortably.
Hermione narrowed her eyes.  “Wouldn’t I?”
“Oh, yes. Harder.”
“Let me show you.  Let me make love to you, Harry.”
“Oh, well, then I guess that is romantic,” Ron conceded.  “But why is the bracelet here?  Why didn’t she take it with her?”
“You never know.  I’ve seen it all.  Good luck,” Cyril nodded, then opened the door.
Draco turned to Harry and smirked smugly.
Still gulping for air, Neville waved his hand. “She’s fine.  It’s the baby.  It’s coming.”
“Come on boys, this is our last feast ever at Hogwarts.  Don’t ruin it,” Pansy whinged.
Harry shrugged.  “Who knows?
Draco quickly scanned his memory for incidents of swearing in front of the Headmistress.  He knew he swore under his breath around her, at the very least.
not ruining it,” Blaise said.  “He’s the one who keeps harping on it.” He pointed at Draco.  “No pun intended.”
Tugging on Draco’s arm so he could face him, Harry smiled.  “It’s flattering.  A little sudden, but flattering.”
Draco nodded. “Yes, Mother had to settle for a public officiant for the ceremony.”
have to say?”  Draco laughed at what he imagined Ron’s reaction to be.
“We’re just going to study.  It’s not really even a date.  I want to get to know her a bit.”
“Maybe we knew each other too well before we got together.  I’d had a crush on him for so long and he was practically part of my family.  He probably thought of me more like his little sister.”
They continued to walk toward the Great Hall for the Valentine dance.  As they approached, Knox walked into the large foyer.  He stopped and appeared to vacillate between running away and crying.
With that, Draco tossed his paper on the table and left, humiliated as he was before. While the Prophet article was embarrassing for Harry, it was totally emasculating to Draco.  He couldn’t stand the scrutiny of the entire staff and student body a second longer.
“And a Death Eater,” Ron quickly added.
Again, Harry blushed, averting his gaze.
“Get up, please,” Harry urged her. “I’m no different than any other wizard.”
“When was this?” Hermione asked.
“Oh.”  Harry was surprised.  With Draco’s good looks, he didn’t think he ever had trouble finding companionship.  “Hermione’s like her own one-woman dating service.”
The word
“Forgot to leave a light on,” Draco mumbled as he took out his wand to cast a few Incendios on the candle sconces about the room.
“I thought I wanted to be an Auror.  But now I’m not so sure,” Harry told him.
“Oh, that reminds me,” Narcissa said, casually taking a sip of tea.  “Draco, dear, would you mind terribly putting up a silencing spell tonight?”
“Of course not, mate,” Ron clapped him on the back.  “You’re the most eligible bachelor at Hogwarts.  Now that you’ve broken up with Ginny.”  He frowned.
“Good morning Knox,” Minerva smiled.  “Ready to begin your second full week of classes?”
Disoriented momentarily, they looked up at her.  They looked at each other and began to laugh.
“Mother,” he whispered.  “Please don’t cry.  I didn’t come here to make you feel guilty.  I only wanted to understand . . .”
“Things should have been so different.  We love you very much.  You should have felt that every day.”
Ron nodded.  “I want everyone to know she was the brightest witch of her age.  Still is.”
“Yes, things are great.  Really, Gin.  Draco and I are very happy together.”
“I’m asking Penelope to the Valentine Dance.”
Harry picked up Lily and rocked her while putting a dummy in her mouth.
“No, Ginny, I want to marry you.”
Too tired to even make it up to the loft, Harry collapsed on the sofa in his flat. He fell asleep almost instantly, snoring heavily. Dreams plagued his sleep. They were more like memories. Falling debris, cursing Greyback, watching Draco die.
Malfoy considered Hermione’s words.  Draco certainly wouldn’t have helped out of the goodness of his heart.  But to secure a position in the Ministry, he might.
Looking at a parchment in front of him, the man pursed his lips. “I have information here indicating a Mr. Malfoy traveling in Venice, Italy. There are hotel records as well as restaurant receipts.  Also, the same for Triora, Italy during a consecutive time period.”
“What?”
Draco had to force himself to stop what he was doing and disengage himself.  He lay down next to Harry and let him climb on. As Harry’s bum came in contact with his bollocks, the pair moaned in pleasure.
“Mr. Malfoy!” McGonagall screamed.  “You will desist this instant.  Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Entwistle, please take Mr. Boot to the hospital wing.  As for you, Mr. Malfoy–”
“Sounds like you’re trying to talk yourself out of it,” Hermione said.  “Is that really how you feel?”
“I look forward to it,” Draco said and walked down the stairs toward the dungeons.  He smirked to himself.  He’d go easy on the ginger, so as not to embarrass him in front of his friends too much.  How good could Weasley possibly be?
Ginny picked at her nails, avoiding eye contact with Harry.  “If you don’t want me anymore . . .” she swallowed, trying to wet her suddenly dry throat.  “Maybe, we should . . .”
“Good morning,” Harry said awkwardly.
“There’s more.”
“You’re not unkempt.  You’re . . . carefree.” Draco bit his lip. “I like that about you.  Most people consider me too fussy.”
“Oh, they’re quite nice.  And roomy.  Roomier than mine at any rate.  Perfect for entertaining . . . er, that is if you have someone, I mean . . .”  Harry rolled his eyes at his own inappropriateness, probing in to Malfoy’s personal life.
“Birthdays never meant that much to me, Mione.  And it’s only been since June.”
“What do you mean by time off?”
“At first, I thought they were Ron and Hermione as children.  But then I thought maybe they were Ron and Hermione’s future children.  That’s who they are, right?”
“I’ve gotten a position at my alma mater, Alse Young. I’ll be moving to America in a few weeks.”
The blond gave him a small kiss.  “Let’s not get distracted already.  I haven’t even shown you what I’ve brought.”  He proudly held up the book he borrowed from Blaise.
The blond forced himself to look as they crested a hill.  He gasped at the sight.  Taller than any of the trees, the ride briefly offered a wide view of the park.
“Yes, I probably am delirious. But that doesn’t mean I don’t know what I’m saying. I am in love with you. And I’m sorry I didn’t do anything about it when I had the chance.”
“The usual then?” Draco grinned.  He held Harry from getting up.  “This is how it all started you know.”
Harry frowned.  He didn’t like the idea of Draco hiding in his room, but he understood.
“Yeah,” Ron agreed. “Besides, there have already been several books written about you.”
Ron shrugged.  “Dunno.  Maybe all the Quidditch practice.”  He slipped his arm around Hermione’s waist.  “Or other activities.”
Harry let out a Sherry sweetened breath that Draco was close enough to feel on his face.  He felt pinned in place by Draco’s gaze and remained statue-like.
Footsteps up ahead made Harry freeze in his tracks.  He backed up against the wall then inched his way to the windowsill. Pressing himself as tightly against the window frame as he could, Harry listened as the sound drew nearer.  The footfalls stopped just past the small niche in which Harry was hiding.
Looking just slightly guilty, Ron asked, “Did it work?”
“Huh?”
“I suppose anything’s possible,” Harry replied.  “There was a girl in Little Whinging, right before Sixth Year.  But, I wasn’t careless.”
Ron snickered.  “That shouldn’t be hard for me to avoid. I don’t know how to cook.”
“Well, I won’t ask you to glamorize me, Harry,” Hermione said.  “You can keep in all of my imperfections.”
“What about you?  Do you have someone right now?”
Harry got up and went to the windowsill.  The same one at which he’d spent so much time in his years at Hogwarts.  It was a good thinking place.  He was thinking about the dream.  The dream he had three times prior.  Or variations of it.  It was slightly different each time.
In that moment, Harry was very glad for Ron’s intervention earlier.  His friend was right.  Harry needed to stop leading Knox on, however unintentional it may have been.  His heart beat a little faster as Draco kissed his lips.  This was all he wanted.
“May I use your floo?  I’ll contact Professor McGonagall and let her know we’re coming back tonight,” Draco informed Arthur.
“Because I tried it, and it hasn’t panned out,” Harry explained. “I don’t want to advertise that I’m a failure.”
One more step.  “Just probably?”
“I thought you were angry with me,” said Harry, pulling his jumper over his head.
“No.  Boot!  I’m talking to you.” Ron stood.
“Oh.  Are you
“We know where the nursery is,” Harry interrupted.
Giving it some thought, Draco paused.  “I have been acting like a clingy girl,” he admitted.  “Should I apologize?”
“No, thanks.”
To prove his point, he wrote again.
Harry reached out to shake it, but Virgil laughed and shook his head.
“No.  She is very pretty, though.”  Harry lowered his voice. “And she sure knows how to wank.”
A quick glance over at Ron and Hermione told Draco they had been watching him as well.  While Hermione seemed to actually enjoy the show, Ron looked a bit ill.
“You receive a failure for the potion. And if your essay is late, points will be taken off for each day it is overdue.  Every essay will be handed in, regardless of how late.  More than a week and you will receive no points.  Don’t hand it in, and you will fail the class.”
Though they walked in the same way they always did, no closer, no further apart, the entire Hall silenced and watched them.
Quietly enjoying his food Harry noticed that Hermione looked like she wanted to make a comment or ask a question.  She kept pausing as she brought her spoon to her mouth, as if to speak, but then continued to eat.
They stripped, and Draco uncharacteristically left his clothing in a pile on the bathroom floor, along with Harry’s.
“Good to hear it.”
“But . . . “ Harry said, stopping Knox in his tracks.  “I love Draco.  I intend to be with him for a very long time.  I like you, as a friend.  But I can’t be your friend if you persist with your flirting.  And more importantly, you need to stop undermining Draco.  Don’t you dare ever tell him again that he’s not good enough for me.”
Jabbing him in the ribs, Hermione said, “Shhh.”
Althea was a pretty girl.  Ron was right about that.  She looked to be a couple of years younger than he.  She worked at the Ministry in the Muggle Artifact department, as she was muggle born herself.  The witch wore modern muggle clothing and appeared very comfortable in this particular restaurant.  In many ways, she reminded Harry of Hermione.
When Harry was out of earshot, Knox said to McGonagall, “I spoke out of turn.  I’m not the substitute Potions professor anymore.”
“That would be pretty funny actually.”  Draco cleared his throat and attempted to imitate Harry’s voice.  “Excuse me everyone, I know you all think I’m a manly hero that saved all of your sorry arses, but really I’m just a queen that likes to wear pink and pick wildflowers.  Sorry to have disappointed.”
Lifting up on his elbow, the blond questioned Harry.  “You want to keep it a secret, don’t you?”
“Got it, mate,” Ron bounded out of the room to retrieve his stash.
“No, he didn’t.”
“Chips?”
Harry looked up to see Draco walking in.  Their eyes met briefly before a very tall man with shoulder length brown hair approached Draco and held his hand out to shake. Tearing his gaze from Harry, Draco directed his attention toward the other man, smiling politely.  He took the offered hand and was gently pulled forward as the tall brunette kissed his cheek.
have the most beautiful hair in the world,” she giggled.
Draco frowned at her cryptic answer.
“And now?”
“Poppy didn’t ask, Master Draco.”  Poppy continued to wring her hands.  “Has Poppy done wrong?”
“Most of what you’re talking about happened because of the war.  He was merely trying to survive.  Even McGonagall believes he is remorseful.  That’s why she hired him.”
“You’re a hero.  Of course you can find a girl.  Just don’t be shy,” Harry told him.  Neville still appeared to be in shock as he walked to their dormitory.  To Ron, Harry asked, “Are you going down to breakfast?”
Harry smiled.  “Spectacular.  Good word.”  He rolled over half on top of Draco and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Maybe a few more minutes before we get up.”
“Stand down, Malfoy,” one of them ordered.
Draco made two attempts to get up before staggering to his feet.  Harry wondered if Draco had started drinking before he got to the Tower.  Harry turned to leave.
After closing the door behind Ron and Hermione, he tried to casually pick up a few stray items on the floor, including Harry’s book of parchment.  He felt at a disadvantage, but it was his own fault.  He knew that.
“But if it’s just gossip, how are you out?”
“No, you have to help me,” Harry pleaded. “What if I get too nervous or something and I can’t . . .”
She looked down at the books in his hand. “You mean, you really came here to study?”
“Sir?” She cocked her head.
“Yes.” The professor stood and walked around her desk to look up at Draco. “You are on your way to becoming a fine man. Don’t get distracted by pettiness.  Be true to your heart and do what you think is right.”
Hermione waited for more.  When Harry was not forthcoming, she spoke.  “And?  Are you worried it’s true?”
“Was I not supposed to?” Draco asked.
Throwing his head back, Draco moaned loudly.
“I know you Slytherins have a reputation for being snobbish and mean.  But I think it’s a front.  You weren’t like that at all at the dance.  You were nice and charming and funny.  I think that was the real you.  And I liked it.”
“Hi Mione.  Did you have a good time?”
“No, that wasn’t what I was getting at,” Narcissa said slowly.  “But since you brought it up . . .” She turned to Harry.  “Do you think Draco is good enough for you?”
“Why are you acting so strangely?” Hermione pouted.  “Any other time, you’re begging me for some excitement.  And tonight you’re acting like virgin on his first date.”
November 17 1998
Harry bit his lip.
“I’ll think of something later. I actually wanted to show you a brochure for one of the places I’d want to take you this summer.” He handed Harry the pamphlet.
“Should we give it a few more minutes?” Theo questioned.
He repeated the order when Draco hesitated.  Harry held his arms out in front of him, high enough for Draco to easily capture.
“No, I mean, what if they already exist?”
“Now’s as good a time as any.”
The boys looked at each other.  They looked back at Romilda and nodded eagerly.  She recognized one of them as Jack Sloper, who was in her year.  She decided not to tell Padma that both boys were more than likely two years younger than her.
“That’s not your wand,” a weary voice said quietly.
“I don’t care about that.  My father is nothing more than a snitch looking for personal gain.”
“Sounds not so bad,” Parvati commented.
Once again, Ginny and Dean walked in on the pair snogging on the couch.

“But I’d rather listen to you read.  You’re so much better at it than me.”
“I’ve got to go,” said Draco.  “I’d like to get to class before the students.  See you later.”  He gave a genuine smile before he left.
He leaned in, more slowly this time.  She parted her lips slightly and kissed him back.  They stood on the dance floor kissing, like several other couples, but more demurely.  Justin still didn’t know who she was, and he didn’t want to come across as overbearing.
By the time they were ready to leave, Harry had the feeling that the four of them could actually get along quite nicely. None of Harry’s other lovers seemed to fit in with their group. He supposed that was part of the reason his relationships didn’t last. His friendship with Ron and Hermione would never be compromised for anyone else. That was something he was unwilling to sacrifice. Even for love.
“I’d like to think so.  Can I ask you a question?”
.  Other what?”
“Journal,” Harry whispered to himself.  He had forgotten all about the journal Draco gave him.  He had planned to write in it his plans for the future, curious as to whether the journal would correct him.
“Oh, she’s beautiful.  Just beautiful,” Molly exclaimed.
“Use the body oil,” Harry suggested.
“Here,” Harry said holding a noodle between a pair of chopsticks.  “Try it.”  He dangled it in front of Draco’s mouth.
“I’m sorry.”  She put her arms around him for a hug.
With a smile, Harry answered, “I don’t think there’s anything suspicious about two professors walking their students back from Hogsmeade together.”
Not realizing just how much work there was to do, Harry felt it was more of a token gesture, just to be friendly. Little did he know, he would end up spending the better part of the following few days in the blond’s company.
“But I did.”
“What’s wrong with Luna?  She’s very nice.”
Draco’s brow furrowed.  “No.  I was helping Montague.”
“Okay.  I just thought I’d check on my way up to my chambers.”
Harry smiled.  “You seem to be a little more relaxed.”
The Slytherin Head looked him up and down.
“Pas de problem,” Narcissa smirked, and winked at Fleur.
“He’s probably right,” Blaise agreed.  He looked at Harry and mouthed something Harry couldn’t make out.  Harry shrugged slightly.  He mouthed back
Draco leaned forward and captured Harry’s lips in a sensuous kiss. Harry’s fingers wound through Draco’s blue hair while pressing his body further into Draco’s.
“I don’t think I like the sound of that.”
“Yeah.”  He paused, expecting her to excitedly show him her new piece of jewelry.  “Well, let’s see then,” he finally said and held out his hand to take hers.
“I knew there had to be some other explanation,” Harry told Draco.  “There was no point in telling you.”
After a while, Ron spoke slowly.  “And, um, Malfoy, um, likes you now?”  He was clearly uneasy.  “Harry, do you really think you can trust him?”
“You expect me to believe you only kissed him?”
“Yes.  That’s right.”  She touched her index finger to her chin.  “Hmmm.  I wonder now if there was something brewing between the two of you back then.”
Draco gave Harry’s hand a squeeze and disapparated them away.
Slipping back inside, Harry hugged Draco to his chest.
Draco reached down and gave them a squeeze.  “They look just fine to me.  But if you must cum . . .”
“Chopsticks,” Hermione smiled.  She clicked them together in her hand.
Draco cocked his head to one side slightly and furrowed his brow. “I don’t think I need one. The pain really isn’t bad.”
Malfoy stood and trained Ron’s wand on him.  Harry made no move to protect himself.  His guilt prevented it.  Hermione, however, poised to take the elder Malfoy out if necessary.
“Come on,” he begged.  “I’m not asking for much.  Have a few more drinks and pretend I’m someone else.”
Harry groaned again, and Hermione hit Ron rather hard on the back of his head.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, out of breath.  “That was so fucking fast.  I couldn’t help myself.”
“Sorry. Habit,” Harry apologized. “But can I get a look at your side. Just to see if there’s a wound I need to cover.”
Hermione tapped Ron on the shoulder. “We should let them be alone.”
Harry took a deep breath. “On the count of three, all right? But don’t hold your breath,” Harry warned. “Try to breathe through the pain and focus on something.”
Harry wished he had the nerve to go and speak to him as he would anybody else.  The wand game provided the perfect excuse for conversation, but without it, Harry felt awkward. Over the course of the day, Harry had been slowly subconsciously allowing his feelings to reveal themselves.  By the time their potion was made, Harry was convinced he was crushing on Draco Malfoy.
“Come on, just one more?”
Harry said nothing, feeling like a berk for having behaved like a possessive girlfriend.
But Draco could see the red marks of his fingertips on Harry’s skin.  He tenderly rubbed the spots.
The men looked at each other.  Harry felt as though his attraction to Draco was written across his face.
“It wasn’t a date, any more than Hermione had with Daphne.  We played
Ron shrugged his shoulders.  “It wasn’t that difficult.  I got the food from the Three Broomsticks.  Ordering up the starry night was a bit tricky, though,” he joked.
Narcissa had to hold back the laugh, as she considered what Lucius’ reaction to that would be.

“Open your eyes Draco.  You’re missing it.”
“Actually, I just haven’t been shopping in a while.  Don’t I look good in black?”
“Cum, love.  Cum.”
“Too bad you’re seeing Hermione,” Harry grinned.
Michael nodded. “It sounded like it was coming from up there.” He pointed toward the stairs leading to the boy’s dormitory.
In the meantime, George and Charlie were having a lively debate about Quidditch.  George was a Puddlemere United fan, like Harry, while Charlie rooted for the Chudley Cannons. Harry mentioned that he and Draco had seen Ginny play the Ballycastle Bats in autumn-- the game in which she had been injured slightly. It started a lively debate as to whether Finbar Quigley was one of the best Beaters ever to play the game. Harry enthusiastically agreed that he was.
Harry licked his lips. “All right,” he murmured.
Draco couldn’t help but join him.  “Is that why you didn’t go?”
Harry drew gentle circles over Draco’s back as they lay together.  He knew he missed his lover, but he hadn’t realized exactly how much until he was back.  Grateful it was only Friday, Harry planned on not letting Draco out of his sight the entire weekend.  Or possibly the rest of his life.
“Harry, I would never judge you.”
“Of course.”  Ron paused.  “So, how’s that going, by the way?  You and Mal--Draco.”
Draco nodded. He kept his eyes on Harry’s face as Harry focused his attention on Draco’s legs and feet. He looked more nervous than Draco felt.
“Excuse me?”
“Why not?” Draco questioned.
“Well of course he is,” Filius groused.  “He’s very popular with the pupils.  Being tall and handsome has its advantages.  Not to mention the curiosity about his Death Eater past.  It makes him an irresistible mystery to them.”
Harper shook his head. “No. I . . . we were talking about the summer.  I was chatting up the job at the vineyard, trying to convince him to come with me.  He was still deciding what to do.  His heart just wasn’t in dragon keeping.”  Harper fidgeted with his fingers.  “I sort of blurted it out.”
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but Draco interrupted.
“With what?  Wait, I don’t want to know,” Draco said.
But his scent, when he stood close, was what really caught Draco’s attention.  He could feel himself becoming aroused the closer they got to Harry’s quarters.  In need of adjusting himself beneath his own robes, Draco refused to give Harry the satisfaction.  Though, the smirk on Harry’s face told him that Harry already knew the affect he was having on Draco.  Harry didn’t even try to hide the fact that he was feeling the same way, and tugged at his trousers.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. “I was a prat, wasn’t I?”
“Of course you don’t,” she joked.  “But . . . I hate to bring it up, what about your bond?”
“So, what happened?”
Once they reached the tallest tower in Hogwarts, Draco insisted they return to their usual appearances.
“That’s my girl,” Draco smiled.  Then his smile faded. “Did you tell anyone else about this?  Blaise?”
“But nobody can prove it. And besides, if and when I do tell my family, how can I bring home such a flamer?”
“There’s more. Hornbeam is complex, for it also represents discipline and conscientiousness. Not to mention an emotional partner in the matters of love.” Ollivander winked.
“Sh,” Olivia chided.  “Now, Harry, think about your future.  Ask a question in your mind.  Concentrate.”
Harry and Ron ended up in the same room they had before, which, again they shared with Neville, Seamus and Dean Thomas.  Though Hermione was happy for Ginny to make Head Girl, she was disappointed that they would not get to share a room, as the girls had gotten especially close recently.  Consequently, she wound up in a room with Parvati, Lavender and two seventh year girls.  Inwardly groaning, Hermione began to unpack her things.  Sharing a room with a girl who had been hell bent on going after her man and one that still held a grudge about the Yule Ball was going to be trying to say the least. She could only hold out hope that they all had matured.
“I figured I could use your toothbrush,” she grinned. “I don’t need pajamas.”
Casper nodded and sighed.  “All right professor.  I’ll try not to be so distracted from now on.  I don’t want you to get into trouble because of me.”
“What’s that?”
“What?”
“Thanks, mate.”
Without warning, Harry buried his face in his hands and began sobbing.  He could no longer hold back the flood of emotions he had been keeping in check all day.
“Fuck.  Yes.  I think that’s going to make me cum.” Harry submissively left his hand up over his head where Draco had put it.
Parvati smiled as her dance partner’s mask vanished.  She had a feeling it had been Michael dressed as a vampire, but they had barely spoken.  Instead, they communicated through dance.
“It’s all right, Harry.  I don’t mind going back to Hogwarts,” Draco smiled sympathetically.
“I tell you, baby look like my two sister.  I am only daughter with dark hair.  I have dark like Papa. My mother have light hair.  So baby have light hair, like you.”  She smiled at Draco.
“Um.”  Harry decided to come out with it and be honest. He glanced around to see if anyone was listening. “It’s a note from Draco,” he said quietly.  “He wants me to switch partners with Blaise for Potions.
“Yes.  What about you?”
Harry shot her a questioning look, then frowned.  “I have to check in with Shacklebolt, then write my report.”
know,” Draco nodded.  “I sit at the Gryffindor table for Merlin’s sake.”
“Really?  There’s something relaxing about holding a baby.  Are you certain you don’t want to?  It’ll be good practice.”
“Well, that’s a depressing thought.  Are you sure you want to remove the spells?”
Harry gave a questioning look.
“They look like slash marks.”  Harry ran his fingers over a few of them. “But I can’t imagine you would have just stood there while someone stabbed you over and over.  Did you get them all at once?”  Harry suddenly gasped.  “I did this to you, didn’t I?  Shit.  No wonder you didn’t want me to see.”
“It may be none of my business, but you’re talking like you’re planning to fuck him.”  Blaise paused, thinking carefully before he spoke what was on his mind.  “Potter doesn’t seem like the bottom type.  Actually, neither of you do. Another way the pair of you are alike.”
Harry turned onto his back and rubbed his wrists.
Ron grumbled.  He knew Hermione was right.  He liked it so much better when Harry was dating Ginny.  The four of them got on so well, it was easy.  Adding Malfoy to their group was going to be difficult.
Draco tried to remember who had gotten together as a result of the game.  The game certainly seemed to want him and Harry together.  He recalled the time he and Harry heard Luna and Longbottom in one of the alcoves.  He’d seen the two of them walking about the castle hand in hand since.
“But I already told you, I’m not–”
Draco shrugged.  “It’s somewhat common.  Especially among the purebloods.”
“Do you regret it?”
“It’s all right, Harry.  Have you spoken to Ron yet?”
Professor McGonagall,
Poring over parchments, Harry asked, “What do you think?”
“Not really.  I’ve heard of binding magic, but I don’t think one person’s magic takes over.  It’s more like joining.  It’s been done at marriage ceremonies.”
Harry playfully rolled his eyes.
“I’ll miss you,” a mocking voice said from around the corner.
“Knox.  How are you?”
Hermione and the two gingers picked up on the commotion, their curiosity piqued.
“She was always on about how Ron and I should have been studying harder,” Harry said.  He paused.  “Speaking of them . . . I’ve offered to babysit Rose so they can go out.  They haven’t had much opportunity since she was born.”
Knox nodded.
“Fuck.  I’m cumming,” Draco announced.  Harry squeezed his muscles and Draco cried out again in pleasure.
“Yes, professor,” the student replied, his head hung in embarrassment. He left and headed for the Ravenclaw dormitories.
“You’re right, I’m sorry.  From now on, I’ll tell you everything.”  Harry held Draco close, then stepped back.  “But wait, why are you here?”
A few days after Ron and Hermione’s visit, Draco was feeling pretty good about the way things were going.  He felt he made real progress toward friendship with the pair.  Plus, he was able to relax knowing that the Ministry was taking the threats against his mother seriously.  He’d slept better in the past couple nights than he had since Knox became the Charms professor.
They had taken to lying on the couch together, one cradled in the other’s arms as they read. Normally, whoever took the lower position held the book up for both to see and read aloud.
They showered together, though only washing themselves. Neither one trusted himself with touching the other’s body.  Breakfast would be over before they got to the Great Hall if they had another shag.
“I was just being friendly.  He was staring over here again, so I waved.”  She smiled to herself as she picked up a spoonful of peas.
“But you like Potter enough?”
The commotion subsided, and the thumping ceased.  Parvati and Michael both blushed furiously, but neither saw, as they were both too embarrassed to look at the other.  Michael was fervently praying Parvati wouldn’t notice the rather obvious bulge in his trousers.  He needn’t have worried, she was too busy trying to cross her arms over her overly excited nipples.  After several minutes of quiet, Parvati finally spoke.
“We know it’s going to be a lot of work,” Harry said.
“No, it’s not your fault,” Draco sighed.  “If I had protested more about those articles Skeeter wrote years ago about me, this wouldn’t have been such a big deal now.  At the time, I figured it would all blow over and be forgotten.  And, you know, too much denial only makes a person look more guilty.”
Expertly sucking and rolling his tongue, Draco delivered on his earlier promise to make Harry feel good.  Though Harry had received oral sex before, Ginny hadn’t known so precisely what would bring him the most pleasure.  He supposed it was knowing first-hand what felt good that made Draco so good at it.
Daphne’s sister, another coveted female, was spoken for when a known homosexual boy, Harper, pulled her wand.  More grumbles from the boys.
“Well, I seem to have won over the youngest member of the clan, at any rate.”
“How dare you--”  Lucius got up out of his chair.
“By yourself?”
“Um . . . Harry?” Draco called, at a loss.  “What do I do?”
“I don’t.  We’d better get this off to the lab straightaway,” Harry said.
“Yes, I just needed to figure some things out,” Draco said. “Which, I think I have,” he smiled.
Narcissa accepted the cup and cocked her head. “I must say, though you look more and more like your father with every passing year, you are far different.”
Leaning back, Harry angled himself to get Draco’s cock to hit him just where he liked.
“What’s got you grinning?” Harry asked.
“I’d prefer to stay right here in bed, but if you really want to go out, there are natural pools with falls and lush greenery.  Very romantic.”
Ron raised an eyebrow.  “Really?  What about it?” He scratched his head.
“Not sure,” Ron answered. “At first glance, no. But they have to make sure before any of the stuff can be released to you.”
“Well, if it’s okay with Grandmama, we’re going to name her Narcissa.  But we’ll call her Cissy for short.”  Draco looked to his mother.
“You still haven’t told me I’m wrong.”
After supper, she and Harry went to the library to get books for History of Magic research paper due the following week. As they walked by the alcove next to the entrance, Harry blushed, remembering his tryst with Daphne.
Draco laughed aloud.  “No fucking way is Knox a top.”
“It was just a thought,” Draco said.  “I didn’t mean to upset you.”  He rested his hand on Harry’s knee.
“I’m not going to press charges or anything, if you were going to ask.”
“The wards were strengthened,” The Auror told him.  “Only a Malfoy or a select few Aurors can get through.”
Harry smiled.  “Not everyone takes seven years to fall in love.  And I can’t explain it.  Maybe Draco and I were destined to be together.  We just went about it the wrong way at first.”
“What?” Blaise laughed.  “If you can’t even
“And you’re just going to let him get away with it?”
Knox smirked.  “Oh, yes, that’s right, Harry was your rival.”
coming in?”
Reluctant to elaborate, Ron hesitated.  “I didn’t really want tell you this, but as it affects you too . . . the letters weren’t just vague threats against Lucius or the Malfoy family.  The last letter specifically mentioned you and Draco.  I didn’t say anything before because Hogwarts is the safest place for the two of you to be,” Ron explained.  “And the Aurors have been checking in here every so often.”
Suddenly, the crowd invaded Draco’s ears.  He hadn’t realized that they were muffled while the glamour was in effect.  He glanced around at the people nearby. None were giving him or Harry suspicious looks, and he finally began to relax.
“How about if I make some tea?” Draco offered, and headed for the kitchen.
“Because, I . . . I’m in love with you.”
Suddenly, and unexpectedly, a figure apparated between Draco and Ron, blocking the blond’s view.
Ron frowned. “I don’t know. I don’t keep track.”
“Sorry,” Draco mumbled.  “I fell asleep.  Come on in.”
“I’m not in it for the money,” Draco defended.
Only having bottomed a handful of times, Draco tentatively climbed onto Harry and positioned himself over the weeping hard on waiting for him.
He opened the book, a fairy tale, about unicorns and a princess.  He snorted when he realized it was a muggle book, but began to read anyway.
“Not really.  You seem a little preoccupied sometimes.  Not unhappy, just . . . preoccupied.”
“It’s how you usually dress,” Harry shrugged.  “Of course these clothes didn’t come from Twilfitt and Tattings,” he chortled.
“And I thought maybe we could spend some time together before the trip back home.”
“I think I have been for some time now. I thought surely you must have noticed. Every time the Ministry called me in for information in some case or another, I would request to speak with you.” Draco chuckled a bit, causing a coughing fit. He tried not to cough in Harry’s face. Manners to the end, Harry thought. Draco was dying and yet he still was trying to maintain some level of etiquette.
“Hermione doesn’t
“Speak of the devil, literally,” Ron sneered and nudged Harry.  Hermione turned around .
Ron leaned toward Hermione. “Do you think he’s bullshitting us?”
“She told me to be true to my heart and to do what I think is right.”
“I see you took my advice, Harry,” Flitwick said.
“I stopped by her room to get her, but she said she wasn’t feeling well.”
“And take that stupid mask off.”
“You know the stories I wrote?  The ones about the boy called Liam? Well, I was thinking about cleaning them up a bit and trying to get them published.  What do you think? Would you want to help me?”
“Lightweight.”
No, working together would not be the problem, Harry decided.  Keeping from ogling the junior Malfoy would be.  Harry found himself turning away several times from Malfoy’s gaze. His grey eyes seemed clear enough for Harry to see right into the man’s soul.  Or perhaps he was afraid that Malfoy would be able to see into his.  The Slytherin always had a certain degree of intensity in his stare, but it was a different sort now.  It wasn’t cold any more.
“Yeah, of course.”
“Don’t worry, Hermione, we’ll figure something out.”  Harry tried to sound positive.
“My, this is becoming quite the exclusive,” Glenda grinned, pleased at the turn of events.  “Will you tell us who the object of your affection is?”
“All right,” Draco chuckled.  “We’ll go tomorrow and sign the lease.”
Harry exhaled sharply.  “Yes, mum,” he answered sarcastically.  “Draco and I did some serious damage to his bottle of firewhiskey.   I slept right through the wands sparking this morning. I need some hangover potion.”
Harry read the words again.
He stayed to watch the train depart, then walked to catch a carriage. He stroked the neck of the thestral before getting in alone. During the ride back, Harry became more excited about the prospect of spending a lot of quality time with his husband, without the pressures of Hogwarts life.
“Why didn’t you just tell me the truth?  You could have taken me to see her.  I would have understood that she was ill.”
Slipping his hand into his secret pocket, Harry mumbled a rather complicated spell, closing his eyes for a moment. Draco stared at his lover intently until he felt the shimmer of the glamour take effect. He’d done simple glamours on himself, but he’d never felt the buzz of power he did at the moment.

“Oh?”
“Draco is with her.  He insisted.”
“So I make a decent top after all?”
“Nobody could help me,” Draco told him.  “Nobody except Snape.  He didn’t want to kill Dumbledore any more than I did. He was braver than me.  And he saved my life.  I deserved what you did to me.”
He found himself standing off in a corner with Professors Trelawney and Flitwick.  Trelawney had grown butterfly wings, but otherwise didn’t appear much different.  Although, Harry thought her large glasses gave her appropriate bug eyes. Flitwick was dressed as some sort of animal-- a dog or possibly a wolf.
“I guess that means she likes you,” Harry said.
“It was mutual, Ron.”
Draco took a deep breath, then cleared his throat.
“Am I going to have to guess what it smells like to you, or are you going to tell me?”  He lowered his voice almost to a whisper.  “I’ll get it out of you one way or another, Potter,” he said suggestively, which only made Harry blush once more.
“Hmm.  Then you’re the first Malfoy to be so,” Harry smiled back.
Her face took a slightly serious turn that made Harry a bit uneasy.
“And you and Mione have proven that opposites attract.”  Harry raised his as well.  “To love.”
Just then, Michael walked into the common room after having spent the night with Pansy.  His mouth gaped and his eyes widened at the sight of Parvati.
“I don’t hate you,” Draco barely whispered.
“Thank you!”
“But you look so . . . dressed up.”
Ron hesitated to speak his mind.  “It’s stupid.” Harry said nothing, waiting.  “I’ve been in love with Hermione forever.  And I know we’ve only been officially together for the past six months.  But every time I turn around, there’s somebody else hooking up.  Ginny’s having some sort of shot gun wedding and apparently even you and Malfoy are all but married.”
“Are you serious Potter?” The Slytherin sighed.  “I’m a marked man.”  He held out his left arm and pushed the sleeve up.  “Or have you forgotten?  Nobody else has.”
“No, I have actually changed in many ways.”  He laughed.  “But Harry can tell you, in some ways I am exactly the same. I’m still the jealous sort.”
“But you didn’t turn your back on him,” Harry retorted.
She giggled at their reaction.  “You’re lucky it was me and not anybody else.”
“Ron . . .”  Harry didn’t know how to tell Ron that his feelings for Ginny were gone, beyond the friendship.
Draco blushed a bit more.  Fortunately for him, the Healer came in to check on Margherita and the baby, disrupting the conversation.
“Harry did give himself up.”
Draco went back to his quarters, disappointed that Harry wouldn’t be there.  But he and his friends would be arriving later with food.  When Draco got back, he picked up a green apple from his fruit bowl to tide him over until supper.  It was then that he noticed the book of parchment on the side table next to the novel Harry brought.
“Pansy told me some old witch’s tale about powerful wizards giving off magic during sex.  Well, I thought it was an old witch’s tale.”  He finally tore his gaze from his arm and settled it on Harry. “I think you made the Mark go away.”
“I can’t.”
The whoosh of his fireplace cut short his pity party.
“Well, what the hell did you think was going to happen?” he asked Millicent.
“Who?  Are they students?” he asked.
He stood awkwardly, not knowing if he should put the envelope in his pocket or open it.  In his younger days, he would have eagerly torn into it to see his gift.
“It’s been far too long, Harry,” Hermione said as she sat down at a table across from him and Ron. “We didn’t even go out for your birthday.”
Harry joined in laughing.  Deep down, though, he was worried for both his friend and his lover.
“It’s all right, Poppy.  I can be quite clumsy myself.”
Harry cut her off, “He knew why I said it. He knew it was just a guilty conscience. And besides, Draco . . . Malfoy didn’t mean it. He was a desperate man grasping at something–absolution? I don’t know what. It’s done.”
They lay in each other’s arms talking, farther into the night than either of them planned.
“Mr. Malfoy, if you’re going to use me as a bargaining chip, then I think I have the right to speak my mind,” Harry returned.
“Are Granger and Weasley coming?”  Draco caught himself too late.  “I meant Hermione and Ron.”
When Harry and Knox parted ways, Harry suggested that Knox could write up the proposal for the new curriculum on his own.  Disappointed, Knox agreed.  But he’d find a reason to get together with Harry alone somehow.
“A butter beer for me,” Hermione answered.
Ron only huffed.  It was one thing for the boys to see one another in their pants. It was far different seeing Harry’s lover removing his clothing.
Harry took off the wrappings and found a journal inside a box with a simple, but elegant quill.
“We are?” Ron asked.
Harry waited for most of his House to leave before he began to get ready for the Halloween dance.  Earlier in the evening, Hermione helped him with his clothing and glasses.  It had been difficult for him to spend the past hour without them, but he didn’t want to wear his mask in front of anyone.
“We finally get to fuck?”
A puzzled look crossed Harry’s face. Nobody
Harry smiled at Draco.  “Who wants good enough when you can have perfect?”
“I trust him,” Harry said.
“I’d better be off,” Draco said.  “Good night.” Which is what he came to say in the first place.
“Dean, a baby is a huge responsibility.  One that I’m not certain we’re ready for.  And Harry has a right to know.”
Draco shook his head.  “No.”
“Draco, just let him go fishing,” Narcissa said after she hugged James.  “Little boys don’t want to hang out with the old folks.  They want to go off with their friends.”
“Best to just go with it,” Ron shrugged.
“I’m not going to hex you, if that’s what you’re worried about,” Harry said with a smirk.  “While that would give me personal satisfaction, it won’t solve my problem.”
Harry sighed and pushed his chair back, ready to admit defeat.
“That’s kind of obvious, isn’t it?” Hermione questioned.
“You’re right.  Harry does deserve some fun.  I really shouldn’t be upset.  I agreed to break up.  And, well, Dean and I have sort of been seeing each other again since that last wand party.”
hdhdhd
But Draco continued.  “It was one of Professor Snape’s spells.”
Harry cried out loudly, gripping the headboard.  He leaned his head back into Draco.  “Merlin, that was . . .  I can’t think of a good word.”
“Why would Ron need to go with you to talk to Ginny?” Hermione questioned.
“Yeah, we waited for you a little while, then we went down to breakfast.  You missed it.”
Somehow, they managed to move their place in line again, while stroking one another off. Harry was the first to pop, shooting his load onto Draco’s trouser leg.
Thankfully, Draco changed the subject.
Cummins snorted.  “Anything else you
“Hm.”
“Ta,” Blaise called out disappeared.
House for a party?” Ron asked suspiciously.
Now that he was there, after two in the morning, Harry was second guessing his plan. He silently pushed open the door. The small night light over the bed was enough for Harry to confirm that it was Draco in the bed. His right leg hung in a sling attached to the ceiling, the ankle bandaged to a splint. Though the blond appeared to be sleeping, his face showed signs of distress.
“Shit.”
“Yours.  What am I missing?  Hasn’t it always been yours?”
“Harry, when was the last time you saw Draco?”
Draco looked down at himself. “Potter, it’s fine.  I--”
“Shite, you must really have it bad for Potter.  You don’t apologize for anything,” Blaise chuckled.
“Right you are.  Pasta goes straight to my waist,” Draco said rubbing his belly. “We’ll have to do something to work it off.”
Harry shook his head.  “I considered it.  But I’ve applied for an apprenticeship at St. Mungo’s instead.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said quietly.  “I should have warned you.”
“I’ve never actually seen someone do that,” Harry commented.  “I’ve read about it in stories . . . he’s twice as big as her.”
When Dean caught Harry staring, he waved his hand in Harry’s face and laughed.  Harry made up some excuse about not sleeping well the night before, which was true, and joked that he was trying to sleep in class with his eyes open.  No one questioned Harry’s sincerity.
After knocking on Draco’s door, Harry frowned and began to walk away.  He spotted Draco on another staircase coming up.
“Oh, uh, I guess I hadn’t thought of that.”
“That would be you,” Draco retorted. He took a sip of champagne. “I think we need to continue celebrating in the bedroom.  We’ll have to get in all the fucking we can before the baby is born.”
“Pain?” the Healer looked through the notes again, then looked at Draco. “Yes, you said you felt terrible pain, then later realized the Mark was gone.”
“Yes.”  He could see her blush, even in the low light.  “But only, you know, by myself.”
“Uh, no problem. We’ll just go in my room.”  Ginny took Dean’s hand and pulled him into her bedroom.
“Do I get a say?” Dean broke in.
Harry told himself it was only his imagination.  Too much booze, not enough sleep.  Those things, coupled with the spell, could have easily made Harry misinterpret what happened.  Or almost happened.  No, it definitely was not going to happen.  At least, that’s what Harry told himself.
“What?  Is that why Ron took Knox away for questioning?  Is he suspected as well?”
“Tell me.”
“Disgusting, innit?” Ron said in Hermione’s ear as he jerked his head in Harry and Draco’s direction.
“I want to take you everywhere. But we have to start somewhere. Do you not like it?”
Draco stiffened, but answered Harry.  “You’re right Potter.  My handwriting is much better than yours,” he smirked.  “But then you’ve got to give me a hand elsewhere.”
Harry blushed at Draco’s innuendo.  “We must be going.  We don’t have much time before we leave Hogwarts for good.”
The groups became separated as they all made their way to the shops.  Harry took his students inside Dervish and Banges first, while Draco directed his students into Scrivenshaft’s Quill Shop.  The men caught sight of each other once in a while as people wandered through the old hamlet.  Around half-eleven, both Harry and Draco’s groups found themselves at The Three Broomsticks.
“He won’t be happy about it, but I’m sure Harry would be willing to take time out of his busy schedule to come in and corroborate my claim.”
They sat on a large windowsill facing one another. The pair removed their facial disguises and regarded one another.
“I wasn’t trying to ruin it, Hermione.  I was behind and it got messed up when I tried to put it together too quickly.”
“Congratulations, boys,” she called after them.
Trying his hardest to keep his temper in check, Harry explained.  “He did tell me he wants me.  And he kissed me.  But apparently you didn’t stick around long enough to see me punch him for it.”
Lucius glanced at Narcissa, who shot him a look of warning.  She had spoken to him earlier about being on his best behavior. He bowed his head respectfully. “Thank you.” He sat down in the seat Arthur had pulled out.
Sitting in the Gryffindor common room, Harry watched the fire.  Suddenly, he had an idea. If his and Draco’s magic were connected, perhaps he could feel where Draco was.  He closed his eyes and sat very still, concentrating on his lover.  After a while, he opened his eyes.  He knew Draco was out in the courtyard again.  He didn’t see him in his mind or hear anything in particular.  He could simply feel it.
“Actually, I shrunk them onto myself,” Draco admitted.  “Don’t ask me to bend over.  I’m sure they’ll rip to shreds if I do,” he laughed.
“Well, I did win the Potions contest,” Harry countered.
“Would you tell me, should you . . . become unhappy?”
“How?”
“Well, I wouldn’t have been sitting there if--”
Harry nodded and watched Draco’s face as he slowly inched his well lubricated cock inside. Groaning with each small push, Harry gasped when Draco finally hit home.  He thought he had been prepared for the feeling, but compared to Draco’s relatively small fingers, his cock filled Harry completely.  It felt strange and wonderful all at once.  Then Draco began to move, and Harry understood why Draco came so quickly the first time.  He had the urge to pull on his own erection, but Draco beat him to it, stroking in time with his thrusts.  The sounds coming from Harry’s mouth disconcerted him.  He felt as though he should have been embarrassed by how loudly he was moaning, but he wasn’t.  And Draco seemed to be enjoying it.
“If it were just his potion making skills, I would pass him.  But he plagiarized one essay and handed in total crap on another.  I don’t think he’s stupid.  Just lazy.  But then he acts so frightened of his father that I feel compelled to help him.”
The pair stopped dancing but held their position.
“I’m thinking we have a predicament, and this is the best way to solve it.”
Finally getting the box open, Harry removed some tissue to find a metal ring.  He held it up with a puzzled look on his face.
“But I told you, it’s not true,” Harry protested.
“Maybe next time we’ll make it to the bed,” Harry whispered.
“Did I do all right?” Neville asked shyly.
“Then let yourself,” Hermione smiled.  “Love is never wasted.  And it might be returned. But even if this doesn’t work out.  Even if he doesn’t love you back.” She muttered, “He’d be a fool,” under her breath.  “You’ve learned something about yourself.”
Leaning forward, Harry resumed licking Draco’s neck while caressing his chest.  He sighed.
“It was different than the others.  A little anyway.  It still started with you telling Blaise I was falling for you. And then he told you it sounded like I wasn’t the only one in danger of falling.”
A server appeared as Ron sat down to join Harry at the Hog’s Head tavern.
“I’m not sure I understand how it works,” Ginny said.  “What exactly are you looking for?”
Draco kissed Harry. “I’m so proud of you.”
“I’m curious what sorts of characteristics the Chosen One would require in a partner,” Draco smirked.
“I gave a false address to the post office.  Someone from the Ministry owlery picks up mail and sends it out to wizards’ real addresses.”
“Supporting Harry,” he answered.  “Well, come on,” he addressed his House.  “Stand up for him.”  He motioned for the Gryffindors to join him.
“You’re right. No one knows where any new relationship is going to go. But I don’t think anyone has ever told me I made them weak in the knees.”
Harry chuckled, which didn’t ease Lucius’ tension at all.
Draco continued to loop the tie through itself.  “No.  You were right to do that.  Otherwise the whole evening would be all about us.  This way, it’ll only be all about
“We shouldn’t be chased from our home,” Harry said.
“Draco is so naturally thin, I’ve gotten into the habit of eating less so I’m not a big blob next to him.”
“Of course I’m sure.  Besides, Blaise isn’t much of a fan.  I thought maybe we could have a friendly wager.  I assume you’ll be rooting for the Harpies.”
“When can we see him?” Ginny asked for the group.
“And of course, yours as well, Draco,” she added when she saw that he noticed the lack of attention directed at him.
“I hope I take good care of–”
“Cutting right to the chase,” Lucius commented.  He leaned forward in his seat. “Because I can do better.”
“All right.  I didn’t really think she would, but . . .” Justin shrugged.  Tracey turned to walk away.  “Wait.  Could you tell her, Merlin is here to see her?”
“I guess we ought to call it a night,” Harry finally said.
been, forever, it seems.”
“You probably spent special Christmases with Pansy.”
Harry’s heart sank.  Through his Auror training, he knew that Draco was going into shock.
“And swallow?”
Boot turned toward the voice and was met with a fist to the jaw.  Which was quickly followed by a punch in the gut.  When Boot doubled over, the Slytherin kicked him in the face, breaking his nose.  He leaned over the battered and bloodied bully.
“Yeah,” Harry answered.  “Butter beer?”
“Harry and Draco have decided to recite their own vows at this time.  Draco, you first.”
As usual, Skeeter took what very few pieces of factual information she had and embellished greatly. There was an older photo of Harry and Draco, from Draco’s trial, where they briefly acknowledged one another.  The headline under it read Potter Gets Malfoy Off Again. She reported that Harry had been in the Leaky Cauldron with Draco, and that witnesses said they kissed.  However, the truth ended there.  Skeeter had the pair not only snogging furiously, but groping one another in the company of Harry’s friends and nearly shagging right there on the table for all to see.  She also exaggerated Draco’s lack of chivalry in standing up for the Chosen One when she confronted him.  She painted Draco as a submissive partner, going even so far as to insinuate that he was acting as a slave to Harry, alluding to her previous articles chronicling Draco’s love life.  The article went on to drag Ron into a love triangle, considering the way he defended Harry.
She picked up a handful of floo powder and threw it in the fireplace.  “Professor McGonagall’s office.”
October 15 1998
Draco glared at Blaise.  “He looks fine.”
*****
Draco smirked. “Hairless Harry?”
“Does he have anything to be jealous about?” Ron asked pointedly.
“Well, you were undressed and drinking wine . . .”
Draco nearly lost his footing, his orgasm hit him so hard. “Oh, Harry.” He lurched forward, pushing Harry against the wall. “Damn,” he cursed himself.
to make me hurt you?  Because I’ll be happy to,” Blaise said as he grabbed a fistful of Draco’s shirt.
“Who?”
“Well . . . I could think of a thing or two to do,” Harry grinned.
“Harry tells me you’re not interested in having children.  But you’re wonderful with them.  Mary Poppins herself wouldn’t make a better babysitter.”
“What was that all about?” Harry asked.
“What happened?” Draco asked.
Putting a reassuring hand on Draco’s shoulder, McGonagall told him, “I’ve arranged to have your classes covered for the next week so you may tend to your mother.  Draco, she’s expected to make a full recovery in time.”
They ended the call with Harry feeling excited about seeing his friends.  It would take his mind off Draco and his date the following evening.
Shaking his head, Ron whispered, “It’s none of your business.”
She laughed until she realized it was a serious question.
She nodded. “Was.”
“Let it go, Ron,” Harry pleaded.
“I was tired of people telling me how much I look like my father.”
Hurrying to clean up, Hermione wanted to catch up to Harry.  Ron’s potion went well for a change and he took third place.  He was humming to himself as he straightened up his station, quite proud.
“Oh, don’t forget that I’ve got duty this weekend,” Harry reminded him.
At the same time, a similar party was going on in Ravenclaw.  Except there would be no bedazzled boys wearing tiaras.  Boot, Cornfoot and several other less tolerant Hogwarts students gathered.  Instead of wine, they downed firewhiskey and bitched about Harry Poufter and the other pansies.
Reluctantly, Draco opened the package and found that it was indeed a scarf and glove set, but in a soft grey colour.  Harry reached over and wrapped the scarf around Draco’s neck.
“You did ask, didn’t you?” George laughed.
Until McGonagall told him that he would be working with Draco Malfoy.
Harry picked up the folder with the blonde woman’s profile and application in it, and he and Draco walked down the hall to Ms. Singleton’s office.
“I don’t want you to resent me because you’re working and taking care of the twins.”
“A werewolf, of course,” he frowned.  He knew his costume was poorly put together, but he thought it was at least recognizable.
“Did we miss breakfast?”
Seamus wisely took Harry’s advice and walked away.
“Oh,” Harry smirked.  “I see.  All right, then.  Two months from today?  Does that work for you?”
“The baby isn’t due for almost two weeks.  You didn’t need to drop everything to come back.”  He smiled softly.  “So, how was your trip, anyway?”
Blaise’s mouth dropped open and his eyebrows raised. “What?”
Ginny turned to see Harry and Draco sitting together.
Draco’s fingernails dug into Harry’s shoulders as they slowly began to move. Holding his breath through most of it, Draco whimpered with every thrust. He had to consciously remind himself to breathe.
Draco indicated the slight protrusion of his half hard cock.
“McGonagall made it very clear that we are not to be found in one another’s quarters after hours when we’re on duty.”
“A lot of boys were mad that you got Daphne, Hermione.  What did you two do?”  Harry asked.
“What?”
Harry nodded.
Blaise continued. “Look, I’m not one to judge.  And I’m certainly no Potter groupie.  But I haven’t seen you this content in . . .
Covering her mouth, Hermione tried to stifle a giggle. “Oh, I’m so sorry.  She does that sometimes.  I’ll take her now and put her down.  We really appreciate you looking after her for us.”
I can trust around you.”
Miss Gwilt came into the room, as she normally did a patient’s room–loudly. She had no regard for the need for sleep. When a patient was due his potion, he was due his potion. She nearly dropped it, however, when she saw an extra body in Draco Malfoy’s bed.
“Shouldn’t be too hard to find some witnesses.  Should I talk to Malfoy’s, er, Draco’s mum?”
They stood still a moment, then shrugged it off.  It wasn’t a big deal for them, they were only asking questions.  However, Harry had a few that were of a more personal nature this go round.
“Poor thing. She’ll probably make a pet project out of him,” Hermione laughed. The pair went into the kitchen to take their seats.
With no time to waste, Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him to face her.
The moment Harry and Draco, carrying the child, stepped through the fireplace, they were bombarded with questions, congratulations and requests to hold the child.
“I see.  Then where was your first date?”
“Give him a few more minutes,” Hermione urged.
He leaned close to Harry. “Aren’t you going to dance?”
hdhdhd
“Oh, then I guessed you fucked in your room, then.  Too many thens,” Draco said absently.
Pansy frowned.  “Do you think it’s coincidence?”
“Can I be there?” Draco asked.
“I’m sure the house elves would happy to serve you,” Minerva said.  Harry got the impression that the Headmistress was displeased.
Hermione giggled. “It’s time to make our entrance.”
Draco nodded and squeezed his eyes shut against the pain. Gingerly, Harry reached out and felt Draco’s head.
“It was okay,” Harry had to raise his voice a little over the crowd.
Getting caught up in the moment, she answered, “I want you to make love to me.  Make me cum.  Make me feel special.”
Trying to reassure him, she said, “I’ve noticed the way Harry looks at you, and the way he speaks about you.  He’s happy, truly happy.  I believe it’s because of you.”
“Surely, people are tired of the “boy fights the Dark Lord” bit by now,” Harry grumbled.
Harry grabbed hold of Draco’s hand, while Hermione grabbed hold of Ron’s and the foursome entered the Hall.
“I did?  That first day?”
“Tell me about it,” Harry agreed.  “I didn’t enjoy them all that much when I was a student.  What about you, Sibyll?”
“Thank you.”  Harry turned to Draco.  “I guess we have a wedding to plan.”
“So, in other words, you’re open to possibilities.  Good. I’ll do some research on the pros and cons of adoption versus surrogacy and we can go from there.  Oh, this is so exciting.”
“Close to it,” Harry shrugged.  “Why?”
Harry blushed, much to his horror, and tried evading the question.  Draco, however, didn’t let up.
After gathering what he needed and writing a list for Pince, he wandered into the Restricted Section to find some recreational reading for himself.  He paused when he heard Harry’s voice quietly speaking to someone else.  Turning toward it, he peeked through the shelves to see Harry sitting with Knox.
Draco nodded. “I’d better go today then.”
“I just want to help,” Draco pouted.
“If you two are finished, can Harry borrow your houndstooth jacket?” Draco interrupted.  He was glad that Harry and Blaise got on all right, but sometimes their banter made him a tad jealous.
“There.”
“Let ‘em waste, I say. I don’t think they’re worth your effort,” Ron said.  “But,” he continued.  “It could be useful for driving the dark magic out of objects.  Stuff that’s locked away because it’s dangerous.  Stuff that could be worth more than some  shriveled up old Death Eaters.”
“He’s risen above that.  Skeeter is notorious for stretching the truth, even outright lying.  You’re a fool to give her any credibility.”  Harry sighed.  “Look, we both want the same thing-- for Draco to be safe and happy.”
“I’m glad,” Harry smiled.  “I hated seeing you at odds with your father.”
“Pansy, you’re scaring me.  You’re never this serious.”
“Yes, it seems I do. But you’re the one who dropped his trousers first.  Not to mention the ropes . . .”
“Really?” Harry could hardly believe they’d been there nearly three hours.  The time passed as quickly as it did when he was with Hermione and Ron.  Of course, he had no desire to kiss either of them as their evenings drew to a close.
“Were you awake the whole time?”
Ron’s face flushed.  He knew he wouldn’t get away with lying.  Everyone knew that Lavender still had a thing for him and with her being the Chooser, she would have had him do as much to her as the game would allow.
“What happens if it turns out my father is wrong?” Draco asked.
“She saw me with Lav.” Ron bit his lip.  “Harry, I made a huge mistake going to that party.  Now Hermione won’t even look at me.  And I’ve done things with Lavender that I should never have done with another girl.”  He plopped himself down on the couch.  “What am I gonna do?”
The first chance Harry got, or rather, took, didn’t come until Thursday of that same week.  After Potions class, he finally gathered up the courage to talk to her.
“Mione, Harry and I broke up over three weeks ago.  I’m with Dean now.  If there was ever a person who deserved to be happy, it’s Harry. I just hope this girl is better than Daphne or Pansy.”
Suddenly, Draco reached out to where he was still certain Harry was standing and disapparated them both.
“You conveniently left out the part about you being offered a job in Wales.”
Draco nodded.  “I’m afraid I’ve . . . is Harry there with you?”
“Harry?” Not finished soon enough.
“Forget I said that,” Draco said when he saw the look on Harry’s face.
Interrupting Harry’s thoughts, Draco continued talking. “You won’t be able to let it go, will you?”
