“Remus, looking lovely as always. Severus, I see that your scowl has yet to get stuck permanently,” I stood in the doorway, my left hand gripping the frame, as I smiled widely towards both men. Remus spun around, a look of surprise flitted quickly across his face before a look of warmth and affection graced his features. Severus shot me a look of playful disdain, a hint of a smile peeking out.
“I do what I can to appeal to the masses,” Harry said with a cocky smile and attitude. “So have you any plans to show me how much more fun blondes have, or should we go out and play some quidditch, peaches?” Instantly my face is back to being red.
“Yes, Ron. If you ever wish to make it as Head Boy, you’d better watch your actions or else Finnigan might steal your spot. And that’d be a shame really,” I mocked sympathy and sadness at the prospect.
“As always it is an absolute pleasure to see you as well Narcissa,” Harry voiced with charm. A soft smile was on his face as he spoke with her. “I will indeed be joining you all for dinner if that’s not too much?” Mother gave him an affronted look.
“It’s, or I suppose, she is a Mexican Black Kingsnake.” I was filled with pride knowing that Harry liked both of my presents and couldn’t wait to hear Harry speak more parseltongue as I’ve always been fascinated by Harry’s ability.
“Harry, I'm gay and I told my father we're dating because I refuse to marry a girl, let alone a stranger, come to the end of our seventh year.” Silence.
“It's a pleasure meeting you, Laima. I hate to cut this meeting short but I really should be going. Mother? I was just letting you know that I'd be going to Harry’s. He might be coming over tonight for dinner as well.”
“So I’m guessing you want to talk about our little predicament?” Would that predicament be my secretly raging boner? Because I’d say this is currently the most
“Well, unless you’d like to make me a cuppa and talk gossip with me, I’m afraid you lucked out on having me absolutely thrill you with my ramblings,” I said with a smirk. Severus rolled his eyes and took a sip of his tea. Remus’s warm voice cut in and my eyes drifted back to him.
“Right, well, uh,” I try to take a deep breath, but it's as though my lungs have shrunk and suddenly I feel like a fool. My body feels clammy and shaky, doused in a cold flush, yet my face feels as if I ate a
My heart ached for their family because they had seen true heartbreak and hardship. My parents said that they were lucky to be accepted amongst the light side considering that both the Malfoys and Blacks were dark families who endorsed Grindelwald and would by logic follow Voldemort.
“How kinky Draco, I didn’t know you had it in you, you posh prude!” Harry exclaimed, patting me on the back with a little more force than I think he knew he was putting in. I winced but not from his comment, though his comment did twinge my face pink.
“Alright then, discuss.” Harry puts his arms behind his head as he slouches a little further into the chair and rests his right ankle upon his left knee. His eyes are resting shut and he looks like the picture of serenity. How can he be calm after all of this? Fucking prat.
“Draco,” Harry started softly, “whatever it is, you can trust me with it, okay? You're my best friend. You know that.” I couldn't help but think that Harry just might not feel the same after learning about what I had to tell him. That not only was I gay but that I told my father of all people that we were dating as well?
“Merlin, Draco!” Harry said with a jump, his jade-green eyes wide and mouth hung open. With a flick of his wand the music turned down, now sounding low and slightly muffled. He tossed his drum sticks off to the side and turned his body around so that he was facing me.
“That’s sort of what I’m unnerved about. Especially my father. And the whole fairy thing was weird, no?”
“How is Fred and George’s shop going?” I was genuinely curious to know as they really had blown up and made a name for themselves in such a short time. Their genius was to thank for that, and Harry’s little push certainly helped as well. Many of the lower years frequent their shop despite many of the products being banned from Hogwarts. It was nice to see them become so successful, especially when I personally knew how hard they worked and how much they truly deserved this.
“And deprive all those young witches of their wank material? I think not.” Draco watched as Harry buried his head into a pillow, and feeling sorry for him, changed the subject. “DILFs aside, it’s great that you finally have an explanation for some of his rage, and perhaps we can do something about it now.”
Games master Ginny squealed, “One sickle for that dreadful potty mouth darling,” before planting a kiss on her fiancé’s lips. Harry held his hand out for Pansy to deposit a sickle in before he started the first of many stacks of coins in front of him.
“Don’t be rude Jamie.” Ginny nudged her son, as Lavender huffed and continued with her gossiping. Several more minutes passed as she continued her one-sided monologue, interspersed with mumbles of fake listening sounds from assorted family members.
“Owls deliver your post?” Ginny continued, wavering between Welsh and Scottish as she got a case of the giggles.
When he returned Draco was perusing one of Harry’s favourite possessions - the vinyl collection he inherited from Sirius. Draco selected a record and put it on the turntable before sitting back down. Harry smiled as the opening bars of a favourite song played out. Glancing at Draco he saw he had relaxed into the couch, a soft smile on his face as he quietly sang along.
When his son nodded his agreement, Harry quietly spoke. “I see where you were coming from with your anger towards Aunty Lavender, however you need to understand that none of what she writes about is done with malice. Not when it comes to us lot, and I’m including Ted here. Lavender fought in the battle when she was only your age. She picked up those scars from the most despicable werewolf in existence. We thought she was dead after he’d finished with her, but she thankfully made a recovery. She has been dogged with accusations about being a werewolf ever since; that’s the thanks she gets for being a child fighter. She isn’t a wolf you know, she’s just like Uncle Bill. You know he gets more than his fair share of abuse for his scars too. She may be shrill and may be a gossip but she is also fiercely brave and she stands up for what she believes in. I can assure you, what she wrote about the Lupins was from a place of respect, and she would never want Ted to suffer because of it. I can also tell you now that magazines and papers always want to write about me, and the only interviews I grant are with either Luna or Lavender, so I can control the narrative. If it wasn’t her it would just be someone else with no care for our family or privacy, and little interest in the facts. Lavender truly doesn’t publish anything about us without checking it with me first. She deserves our respect and our trust. I would really appreciate it if you would apologise to Lavender for the way you spoke to her today. Do you think you can do that?”
“Please stop talking,” begged James, trying a more polite tactic. Lavender ignored him, and continued rambling on about the latest sex scandal the Minister for Transport was embroiled in.
“I think that’s a nice idea Jamie. I hope you understand you can come to me with anything. It might be hard for you to believe but I would do anything for you. I promise you can always trust me with your secrets, and I won’t judge you for anything you’ve done. All I ever want is the best for you. You’re my chip off the ol’ block. I love you so much Jamie, I always will.”
Shaking that particular thought train out of his head, Harry took one last look at his reflection, deciding he couldn’t go wrong with plain blue jeans and dark green t-shirt, before reassuring himself that his appearance didn’t matter anyway. Draco knew what he looked like, and that didn’t stop him being his friend. Knocking back a shot of Ogden’s for the nerves, Harry grabbed his sunnies and a bubble wrapped parcel off the worktop, slipped his feet into his tidiest blue Gazelles, and headed out.
“Can you imagine how the conversation would go?” Draco made a terrible attempt at a New York accent as he said “You want to show me your magic wand? Is that a euphemism?”
“Just because you’re not interested in corruption and deceit at the ministry, doesn’t mean that everyone else isn’t.” Lavender replied in an icy tone.
They all groaned at that one, Ginny giggling and clutching her stomach as Pansy grabbed onto her shoulder and cackled.
Thank you to everyone who has left comments and kudos, and to those who have subscribed. All the feedback is very much appreciated. This is my first attempt at writing and it's so lovely for me that people are enjoying it.
jeans. Ginny got four glasses out, while Draco grabbed a bottle of Rioja. He sidled up to Harry and asked, “Got a corkscrew?”
Harry sighed, desperately trying to get a handle on himself. He knew there was no way Draco would ever want to be with him. He knew it. Draco was a six foot tall blonde Adonis. Harry was scarred and broken and lived a million miles away. That did not make it any easier to imagine Draco being with someone else. He understood Draco was joking about Charlie, just as Harry had been, but that did not stop that tight ball of jealousy forming in the pit of his stomach. He tried to brush those thoughts aside and enjoy being in the same time zone as Draco for once.
“Well that explains the shrieking.” Draco raised an eyebrow as Ginny huffed out a sheepish laugh. “I would love to imbibe with you, but have I time for a shower first?”
Ron gave her the two fingered salute then continued, “But let's do our best to keep the celebrations going eh? There’s not many single ones still standing, so who knows how many weddings we have left to be completely immature at. So, next on the agenda - Wednesday night we will be down the Leaky for the quiz. I hope you can all make it. For now, it’s Gin’s night, so Gin is games master. First though, two fingers for the birthday girl!”
The pair exited the portkey terminal, where multiple muggle photographers were waiting on the concourse. They shouted Draco’s name and bellowed intensely personal questions, before Pansy grabbed his hand and rushed him and his bags into a waiting black cab. Pansy parroted her address to the driver before relaxing back into her seat, sighing as she leaned her head against Draco’s shoulder.
“Bar is manic,” stated Harry, “I’ll see if I can flag down a waitress.” He waved over a waitress, who smiled at him flirtatiously. “Can I get a bottle of tequila please, with…” he did a quick head count “eighteen shot glasses. Can you give them a salty rim please?” The waitress blushed and nodded. “Oh, and some lime wedges.”
Ron cleared his throat loudly and the chatter died down, all eyes turning to him. “Right then you ‘orrible lot. It’s been too long since we last managed to get together like this, and now we have two blissful weeks ahead of us. I know some of us have real jobs, and we can’t always palm our revolting kids off on those too stupid to say no…”
Draco let loose a contented sigh as he grudgingly said, “I suppose I had better be off, seeing as they have me fully itinerised for tomorrow.”
Harry found himself once again talking through the problems with James. It was good to have had an insight into his son’s mind during their heart to heart the other day, and for once Harry felt he might be getting through to the boy. He told Draco about everything they’d discussed, while Draco patiently listened, and as always, provided a solid shoulder to cry on.
When the song came to an end and the needle lifted from the record, the friends sat in comfortable silence finishing their drinks. With knees still pressed together, both reflected that the night had been one of the best they’d had in a long time.
Kicking his shoes off in the hallway, Harry knocked gently on James’ bedroom door. When there was no answer, he told James he was coming in, before opening the door. He found James curled up on his bed, facing the wall. This was not an unusual position for Harry to find his son in, whose angry outbursts were usually followed by shame and bitterness. Harry sat down on the bed next to James and started rubbing his back, like he had done a thousand times since the boy was small. He continued this for long minutes, knowing the key to his child was to wait in silence until he was ready to talk. After a while James rolled over on his bed, facing towards his father but refusing to meet his eye. Harry moved his hand to James’ head, running his fingers through his son’s messy curls.
I checked on Harry’s presents, satisfied with finding that they were still intact and undisturbed. I called for Dobby and once he popped in I asked him to deliver them to the reception room then to have Dipsy acquire the treacle tart and meet me in there. I made my way to the reception room myself and upon entering the room I saw that my parents were already waiting for me as was Dipsy.
“Draco! What a pleasant surprise,” Remus said with a warm smile as he wiped his hands off on a tea towel and made his way to pull me into a hug. I met him halfway, and he embraced me tightly in his arms. Remus was probably my favorite of Harry’s family because he just
“Just practicing, love.” Practicing huh? I don’t mind that. “I’ll be done in a bit if you’d like to head out and wait for me?” He was already turned around finishing the icing on the cupcakes.
"First off, you're a posh prat. Secondly, you really had me on there mate. That's a good one." Harry was chuckling with a slight shake of his head as he pointed at me with his index finger in a playful motion.
“Would you two care to join me? I can have Mipsy bring more lemonade? Speaking of which Mipsy is making Lemon Pudding Cake with Cherry Coulis for dessert and I am most excited.” One thing Harry learned quickly after being over here for so many years was that mother was quite infatuated with lemon. Between having several lemon trees in our gardens and consistently indulging in lemon centered or incorporated dishes, father and I have had more than our fair share of the sour fruit. Harry’s eyes light up at the mention of dessert.
“From the Weasleys.” It was a decently sized box and when Harry opened it up a smile light up his face.
and grabbed his hand before he pulled us over to the table before he waved his hand, shrinking and collecting the remaining presents and putting them all in one box. He switched the snake over to curl around our conjoined hands before picking the box up and pulling me along towards the house. “Your presents were very thoughtful and lovely.”
“Oh, come off it. It won’t be that difficult, you berk. It’s just us but on steroids. And gay. Or rather, us on gay steroids. Or would it be me on gay steroids and you just on regular gay?” Merlin this git will be the death of me.
Screw when you accidentally set the white peacocks loose in the house and mother threw the biggest fit because her “precious antique vases and dishes that were old enough to be her great-great-great-great (and many more greats because honestly, mother was a bit over-dramatic) grandmother” could’ve been broken, and it was partially “all Lucius’ fault because he’s the one who wanted those god awful flightless birds in the first place”.
“Draco,” Lucius started, “why are you so against this? I don't see what is so wrong with marrying a beautiful girl, producing an heir, and becoming the head of the Malfoy family. I did it, your grandfather did it, we all did; it’s what is expected of us as a Malfoy, Draco. Think of the even greater wealth and prosperity it will bring to the Malfoy name and family!” And that's just the thing. I wouldn't mind settling down and starting a family. I just don't want to be married off to a stranger, or well a girl, for social and wealth status and an heir.
“Draco, there is much that you do not know of us,” he began, “do not assume there to not be more past these faces. There is always more to someone.” And with that, he proceeded to stand up and begin to walk to the closed doorway.
“Draco,” he started with a laugh, “pot is a muggle drug. More commonly known as weed or marijuana. I’ve heard it can be a relaxant of a type, sometimes a little hallucinatory. But mostly a feel-good buzz.”
"Go ahead," he drawled, "I suppose it would be a good time to catch up on some reading. I feel as though even through the silencing charms I can hear those blasted drums." Severus gave Harry a little glare as Harry looked sheepish.
“Yeah, I just didn’t expect that answer, but yeah it’s fine. And yeah I am, but can I have some sleeping clothes? We left before I could grab some.”
After finishing up eating, I walked up to my room and started to get ready. After taking a shower, I looked at my spread of clothing and thought that for Harry, I’d wear some of the muggle clothing he’d bought me a while back. Once I was dressed in slim-fit black jeans and a mossy green short sleeve shirt, I found a pair of stacked heel Chelsea boots to go with the outfit and observed myself in the mirror. It felt odd wearing the muggle clothing and I can only imagine how my parents would react to the outfit. I was originally skeptical and uneasy about wearing muggle clothing, but after discussing moving to muggle London, Harry convinced me that I’d have to get used to wearing something other than robes. It also helped that I looked
This morning was just like every other morning, but with an underlying twinge of excitement and anxiousness. I sped through my slight breakfast of toast with orange marmalade and a cup of tea, my mother sending little knowing looks towards my father as though I wouldn’t notice them.
When I walked into Harry’s room, he looked to be already passed out, glasses off with his eyes closed and his mouth slightly agape as soft breaths puffed out and in. I climbed into the bed on the left side, snuggling deep into the covers, taking a deep breath and sighing out once I was situated and comfortable.
“Yes, happy birthday.” Father’s voice wasn’t as enthusiastic, but there was a soft smile on his face.
"Besides, I'm pretty sure everyone and their mum knows that you're gay Draco. I've honestly just been waiting for the day you told me." I blanched at Harry's statement. Was it that obvious? “But Draco, I gotta ask, why me?” And there's the million-dollar question; why Harry? It surprised even me, how am I to know why I chose Harry? There are reasonable explanations as to why Harry was the right choice, but I wasn't thinking of those reasons at the time. In fact, I wasn't thinking at all. But Harry didn't need to know that.
“It’s the principle of it. You’re all posh and proper, simple and basic. It fits right in with being vanilla. Which of course is fine for a prim prince such as yourself,” by then Harry’s words had me red. Because honestly, I had never thought too much about sex. Of course, I wanked and had little fantasies, but well… they were simple like Harry said. And from the Harry way talks, it sounds as though he imagines far more than what I do and now all I can think about is what exactly is it that the fantasizes about. I glanced at Harry and he sat across from me with a smug look plastered on his face, and suddenly my mouth moved faster than my brain could keep up.
Lavender refused to say a word as she left with Ron and their children, and once they had vacated, the group seemed to sigh in relief.
So, while I do have horrible scars, pain in my joints, and the occasional day I can barely walk, what I have gained far exceeds what I lost.” Harry looked at Draco self-consciously. He hadn’t meant to ramble on for so long.
Draco excused himself to the guest room, loosed his hair from on top his head, shaking it out and running his fingers roughly over his scalp. He showered quickly and selected a tight black t-shirt and closely tailored trousers to wear with his trademark ankle boots. He slipped on a thin blazer and rolled up the sleeves to show some of his tattoos. His obsession with collecting tattoos started after wanting a cover up for the dark mark. The faded snake did nothing for his image of a French-educated fashion designer, and once he got the dragon covering it, he became addicted. His favourite was the field of daffodils on his bicep, which he chose for his mother. Draco added a light grey Alexander McQueen scarf to finish his look, then joined the girls in the kitchen.
Harry grinned down at her and took something out of his pocket with his spare hand. He gestured at it and it slowly grew in size. He passed Ginny the bubble wrapped parcel with a peck on the cheek, wishing her a happy birthday. He took the seat opposite Draco as she unwrapped the present, nodding his greetings at the rest of the guests. She gasped as a glass sculpture of two naked women, face to face in an embrace, and pulsing with an ethereal light was revealed.
“Read the room, no one cares about your shitty gossip! What you write about dad is bad enough, in fact it’s fucking embarrassing. Did you just marry Uncle Ron to get the inside scoop? I’ve had enough of it!”
. Harry internally rolled his eyes at his thoughts, ruffling some salt spray through his wild hair and spraying his neck and chest with Gaultier Le Male.
The group all cheered and whooped, downing two fingers of their drinks before resuming the cheering and calls of “Happy birthday Gin”.
“Well that was awkward.” chimed in George, “Personally I have always enjoyed Lavender’s unique brand of reporting. That last one on you was inspired Harry, even if you are a sad middle-aged pouf. What was it she called you?”
“What do you mean then?” Draco asked. The pair were barely more than passing acquaintances around the time of Harry’s injury, and although they had spoken briefly about it, he had never been so candid. Most of what Draco knew about that time was second-hand information.
“I hate that it happened,” said Draco quietly. “The last thing you deserved was to get injured so severely, after everything.”
Draco’s eyes followed Harry’s movements across the kitchen before he turned his attention back to Pansy. “Yes, shall we rein it in Pans? If you want the truth, I have been focused on work, so I haven’t the time for dalliances with men.”
“Pretty cool, huh,” replied Harry with a grin. “There’s nothing like working with molten glass. Sorry I couldn’t be there when you got here, I was at a crucial stage and couldn’t risk losing the whole thing. It just takes a bit too much cooling for the piece to crack and become useless. We’ve had a challenging few days trying to get that one in the kiln.”
Draco was drawn into conversation with Hermione’s husband Rex, a muggle psychology professor from Yorkshire. He felt on edge, as everyone had arrived with one notable exception, and found he wasn’t really following the conversation. He usually enjoyed catching up with Rex, however he knew there was only one person he was desperate to see. Trust Potter to be late as usual. He went through the motions with Rex, mumbling, “Yes”, “I see”, “Mm hmm” in appropriate places, as he sipped his way through his drink far too quickly. He was about to offer to go to the bar, when a deep voice muttered “Boo!” in his ear, making his stomach jump into his throat.
Harry stepped in at this point, employing his most dangerous dad voice. “James Sirius Potter how dare you talk to your aunt like that. Apologise right now.”
“That’s cheating!” Draco practically shouted, also a little on the drunk side. “I won’t tell if you let me have some,” he continued with a lazy grin, as Harry tried to shush him. Harry passed him the bottle and enjoyed watching him swallow a little too much.
When the girls said goodnight to Harry, Draco decided he would stay for a while longer. They had been keeping him so busy that he had less time to text Harry on an evening than when he was working. And wasn’t
“Have any of you ever thought about how fun it would be to tell a muggle about our world?” he asked.
They usually saved the takings from a night of drinking games to fund the shot penalties for the next one. As they got older these nights became few and far between, but this just made it all the more fun when they did get together, and much sillier.
“Course darling.” Pansy joined them, after slipping out of her tan wedges and chucking her sunglasses on the sideboard.
Harry paused, eyes wet, then quietly continued, “I know it was awful for them, that’s why I can’t be honest about my feelings surrounding it.”
Draco was nervous as he made his way from The Leaky Cauldron floo to Harry’s gallery. He hated being out of control and was filled with dread about what could happen to him here. He was still absolutely recognisable as a Malfoy; like Harry he was an almost perfect copy of his father. He may have changed his name and moved to another country, but he knew the wizarding world was damaged irreparably by the war, and that those memories were not easily forgotten. His thoughts were tumbling over the countless accusations and curses thrown his way by shoppers on Diagon Alley before he fled to Paris all those years ago, and his hand was gripping the wand in his pocket with vice-like force. He needn’t have been so worried however, as nothing untoward happened on his way to the gallery, just as Pansy and Harry had assured him they wouldn’t. He safely arrived at the gallery and ducked inside with no issues. Draco couldn’t help but be impressed by what he saw. He knew how talented a sculptor Harry was, owning some of his work himself, and having attended several exhibitions of Harry’s over the years. Seeing pieces displayed in his own space was a different experience though, and Draco found himself overwhelmed by the talent. He knew Harry focused his work on the human body, using both the male and female form as inspiration, but seeing so much of his work all in one place left Draco breathless at the pure erotic nature of it. He had always assumed that Harry would be nice in bed, being such a lovely normal man. But when confronted with his body of work, Draco felt he may be completely wrong about just how filthy his friend could be. These thoughts in mind, Draco realised he was going into this rendezvous completely on the back foot. Spending more time around the beautifully sexual sculptures made by Harry’s own hands wasn’t likely to ease his tension.
Draco checked the calendar on his Mac one last time, making sure all tasks were scheduled for his assistant, leaving him free for his two week trip back to England. His assistant had recently graduated from Parsons and had made himself indispensable worryingly quickly. Draco’s eyes travelled around his apartment, searching out stray belongings he forgot to pack. He straightened up the items on his desk and bookshelf, smiling at his recently acquired CFDA award. Satisfied that everything was in order, he picked up his phone, eyeing his reflection in the wall mirror beside him as his call connected with his assistant.
“And to a Weasley of all things.” Draco schooled his face into a mask of horror before it slipped back into his delighted smile. He slipped his arm around Pansy’s shoulders as they headed for the exit.
Harry continued stroking his son’s hair, and minutes later James continued quietly. “She did that memorial thing, you know, the spotlight on war heroes rubbish. She put all about Ted’s parents in there. No one at school really knew his dad was a werewolf. Then that stupid article comes out and there’s copies of it going round school. People bullying Teddy about it constantly. Asking if he’s gonna bite them, refusing to sit by him, leaving a gap around him at the dinner table. Beating him up about it, calling him a freak and a pup and a were-baby. He wouldn’t tell anyone what was happening, and no one got caught in the act except me for fighting against them. He’s too much of a Hufflepuff to do anything about it, they just walked all over him. Dad, they made his last year at Hogwarts hell. That’s why he didn’t end up with an apprenticeship or job, he could barely get through his exams as it was. He made me promise not to tell though. I can’t forgive her for it. I can’t move past it. She causes so much shit for us all and is completely unapologetic about it. Ted might not be a Potter or a Weasley but he’s my brother and he doesn’t deserve to be treated like shit. He might not even manage to get a job now. I know he’s got one with you, but he wants to work with animals. Who is going to take him if they think he’s a rabid wolf?” James let out a shaky sigh, angry tears in his eyes.
: his thoughts were treacherous. Everything about this interaction was doing something to Draco, who saw himself getting hard before this call was over.
“As awkward as being the object of your son’s teenage girlfriend’s affections might be, I can’t say I’m surprised. You’re probably a decade younger than the rest of their parents, and you are a DILF.”
“There’s white in the fridge or red on the sideboard; help yourselves,” Harry said over his shoulder, giving Draco and Pansy a smile.
find a lovely muggle to settle down with. Walks in central park, morning papers in bed and sex in the kitchen. The whole shebang. But as I am sure Potter can attest, it’s not that simple. You can never tell them the truth of yourself, and that always leaves a wall between you.”
Harry let Draco’s words wash over him as he tried to calm the fuck down. There was something to be said for normal phone calls, where he wouldn’t find himself face to face with the most beautiful man he had ever seen. He found it slightly easier to look over towards the window instead of directly at Draco, allowing him to follow some of the conversation and respond appropriately. This had the distinct disadvantage of him not looking at Draco, which in Harry’s book, was unacceptable. Harry breathed through his arousal, joining in the chatter, and inserted horrifying images of Umbridge in lacey pants into his lust-addled brain when he found himself getting carried away. It was quite the erection killer. He considered how much he would enjoy telling Draco about this tactic if they ever ended up together.
After being flirted with by the enthusiastic young twink manning the gallery, Draco was led out through the back, where there was a small kitchenette and toilet. The gallery manager (was his name Eddie or something?) told him to wait there, so Draco loitered, feeling a little flushed and awkward. Teddy appeared a few moments later, through a seemingly solid wall at the opposite end of the kitchen. He told Draco that only he and Harry could go through the wards to the hot shop, so he would have to grab onto Teddy to travel through the wall. He explained that Harry was in the middle of something he couldn’t put down, and they’d better hurry. Draco grabbed hold of Ted’s hand and together they squeezed through the wall, the sensation reminiscent of apparition.
“Half giant? How the hell did a normal sized man manage to impregnate a sixteen foot tall woman?” Harry finished, heavily interrupted by his snorting with laughter every few words.
Harry was poised to write and looked to Ginny for instruction. “Right then, one sickle for each, no laughing or giving the game away or you will have to have a shot penalty. Tequila I think.”
Draco was a self-confessed workaholic, partly to fill his hours and avoid leaving him time to think, and partly because denying himself indulgences in life had become habit by now. After the war Draco was filled with guilt and self-loathing, choosing to make amends by throwing himself into work and leaving little time for pleasurable pursuits. In the early days when Draco found himself smiling or feeling joy, he would admonish himself for it, the voice in his head reminding him that he didn’t deserve happiness after everything he’d done. He spent those early years drinking too much and too often, bringing nameless muggles to his bed when he needed a connection, and building a reputation as an aloof, unapproachable snob. His therapist had spent years talking him around to letting go of some of the guilt, which he had for the most part, however, old habits die hard. His demeanour had thawed in recent years, earning him a few close friends in New York, and he had cut back on the booze when he saw it could become a problem. Still his romantic entanglements lasted no longer than a few months, and he denied himself the happiness of a true relationship of equals that most of his friends had so fortunately found.
“Well Ted made me promise. Plus that’s not the only thing that I was a shit about last year, I’m still a fuck up, dad.” James glumly stated.
“Stop changing the subject you menace. I haven’t seen you in a over a year, I’ve barely heard from you in months, I have to get my intel from bottom feeders like Perez Bastarding Hilton, and you come here and still evade my questions!” Pansy’s voice seemed to raise in volume with each word.
“Oh God, Sam!” exclaimed Ginny, with a mixture of groans and giggles from the others. Harry felt a blush rising up his cheeks.
“No wonder he’s a little shit all the time when his own dad won’t stick up for him,” Ginny muttered under her breath.
When Draco arrived into Harry’s workshop he was gobsmacked. Harry was there with a long metal pole twisting through his hands, sweat drenching through his t-shirt and slicking his hair. His skin was glistening, muscles on his arms, shoulders, and back rippling with exertion. On the end of the pole was a large blob of glass, beginning to take the shape of a toned male torso, arching its back. Ted murmured to Draco to stay within a rectangle taped onto the floor, before heading over towards Harry. Throughout the process Teddy and Harry shared instructions with each other, but none of the words made sense. Draco allowed himself to be captivated by the process, watching as the two men passed the pole between them, heating the glass in a large furnace, sitting down to work it with tools and moving it onto another pole. When the form of the man was looking clear and detailed enough to be finished, Harry took the pole, rolling it along the arms of the wooden chair he worked at, and started waving his hand over the piece while quietly murmuring a spell. The clear glass started to glow from the inside with the same ethereal, enchanting light the piece Ginny received for her birthday had. Once Harry finished his spell weaving, he shouted for Ted, who approached the bench wearing a large pair of dragonhide gloves, like giant oven mitts. Teddy held his hands under the glass which was still attached to the pole. Harry dripped water on the glass at the pole end, tapped the pole with a pair of what looked like giant tweezers, and the glass fell off into Teddy’s waiting hands. Ted hastily took the piece to a large metal kiln, with Harry opening the door allowing him to put it on a shelf inside, before closing the kiln quickly.
Ginny gave Harry the side eye as his jaw clenched at the topic of conversation. He frowned at her in return, before taking a large swig of his beer.
“Salazar Potter, you sound like a drunk farmer. Or a pirate,” teased Draco, unable to keep the laughter from his voice. His eyes softened as he smiled fondly at his friend.
Harry pulled his son into his arms, giving him the sort of hug he’d missed since James had decided he was too big for cuddles with his old man. “I’m so proud of you Jamie.” Harry murmured. James pulled back from the hug and looked at his dad with a bit of confusion and a lot of appreciation. He’d always been able to count on his dad for understanding his side of things, and for giving him a proper chance to explain rather than just flying off the handle like his mother tended to do. “I wish you’d told me this sooner mind,” continued Harry. “It would have been easier to help you over the last year if you had told me what was causing all the trouble.”
“I cannot even bear thinking about it Pans. You look amazing by the way; domestic bliss obviously suits you.” Draco raised his eyebrows as he appraised Pansy’s sleek black bob, dark sunglasses, and green jumpsuit.
Draco blushed deeply and groaned. He took a deep drink of the pink concoction to cover the embarrassment he felt at Harry seeing him posing topless like a top notch twink. “Can you please just drop it and stop interfering, you old bints. Our friendship is important to me and I don’t want you two wrecking it.”
“Yeah, just had a busy day, think I’ll have a paperwork day tomorrow to give it some rest.” Harry made a horrified face at that; avoiding paperwork had become his special skill.
“Don’t be silly, I was perusing your gallery and got chatting to your manager… though I can’t for the life of me remember his name.”
“No buts, you apologise this minute, or you can go home. You’re ruining this lovely meal your nan has made. Stop being so selfish.”
“Shut it you, we’ve had to rely on each other since you and Ginny shacked up. He’s the only one not too busy for me.” Draco pouted at Pansy, who stuck her tongue out in response. He continued, “Of course I want to stay with you, it’ll be wedding central and you know I have the best taste out of all your friends,” He smirked.
“That’s all for now. Are you sure you can handle things while I’m away?” Draco always worried when he wasn’t there to control everything, so didn’t often take time off. However, he knew Joshua was perfectly capable of handling business for two weeks.
The kitchen was quiet as the curry was consumed, aside from Radio Two playing quietly in the background and compliments being made to the chef. Pansy was right, Draco felt at peace - more so than he had in a long time. He had a wonderful group of muggle friends back home, who also cooked for each other regularly. He had thought they were giving him all he needed, but in comparison he was noticing how much of himself he held back in his interactions with those he referred to as his chosen family. He often felt like a fraud around them; he knew they could not truly love him without knowing all that he was - the darkness as well as the light. He reflected that no one could ever be as close to him as those that had lived through the worst of him and loved him despite that.
“It’ll be fine Draco, we are all one big happy family nowadays. I promise there will be no trouble or war talk. You’ve seen us all since then any way. It’ll be lovely, honestly. Plus they’re all on their best behaviour for the duration. The only one more terrifying in their rage than me is Ginny fucking Weasley. No one is going to wreck our wedding.”
“Ugh, you’ll put me off my food. Speaking of which, where’s this curry we were promised?” Ginny asked as she polished off the last of the starter.
“Joshua, is the car service en route?” Draco put the phone on speaker so he could sweep his long silver blonde hair into a knot on top of his head. There was no danger of Americanisms affecting the perfect poshness of his upper class diction.
One of Harry’s pleasures in life was to cook for his friends, and his food was good enough that they often badgered him into doing so. Having Draco for dinner as well as the regulars encouraged him to make an extra effort. He finished work early to get groceries from Sainsbury’s on his way home, and ensured he stocked up on good wine and beer to enjoy alongside the Thai green curry he had planned. Slipping into a side alley, Harry apparated back to his flat, put the shopping away, and went for a shower. The heatwave was intensifying, with talk of hose pipes bans on the radio in his hot shop that afternoon. Harry was keen to wash the day away before his guests arrived. He dressed in the dark blue jeans Pansy had told him made his arse look “fucking delicious,” and chose a reasonably tight white t-shirt. After ruffling his hopeless hair and making sure he was looking and smelling his best, Harry headed into his kitchen to start dinner.
Surviving dinner with my parents seemed to have been easier than anticipated. Which I’m certainly not complaining about, it just seemed… suspicious. At least on the account of my father. My mother was surprisingly very encouraging and welcoming to my announcement. I thought she might react better than father, which was certainly true, but I didn’t take into account how much better.
Mother wore a pained expression that consisted of sorrow, sympathy, and ultimately, love. She sat upright and held out her hands across the table to Harry, clasping his when he sat his hands in hers. “Harry,” her voice was soft, eyes sincere, “you of all people have every right to not have a distinguished plan. For the first time since you were eleven your life is yours, my dear. There is no shame in taking back the time that that sickening excuse of an entity took from you in such formative years.” Mother’s eyes were misty and her voice spoke slowly as though she was trying to not cry or as though she wanted to stress her point. I felt it safe to say it might be both. “And if anyone has anything to say I’m sure Severus and I can sway them,” Mother spoke lightly, trying to make the situation lighter and more lively. She gave a playfully disdained sniff and squeezed Harry’s hands before letting them go.
I figure I can start with the items concerning things I can do at the manor, so I send a few freshening charms to myself and set out to complete the first two things I can do on my list:
“I don’t know about all that Draco, I honestly don’t even know where I’d find any. Though I suppose Seamus would know,” Harry said pondering over the situation. “I’ll think about it, yeah? If you’re serious?” I started to laugh.
“Because dear Harold,” I said crossing my arms behind my head and leaning back into the plush bed, my eyes sliding closed, “if they don't, I'll twist it to look like you were fooling me all along and you broke my heart.”
“Oh yes, Draco. You do know Mr. Lupin yes?” No. No, no, no. Please don't say what I think you're about to say! “Remus and I had a nice fling once or twice,”
I don't know if any of you follow closely enough but I apologize for not getting this chapter out last night. I had a long day and my internet was being wonky so I decided today would be better. I really hope you enjoyed this chapter and the added spice ;) Are you guys interested in scenes like that or would you rather I kept it more PG?
“Hey! I’m not that bad!” I huffed out. Harry wrapped his arm around my waist, hugging me into his side before loosening his hold.
And so I continuously try to remind myself of what Harry told me a couple of nights ago when I was stressing to him my worries: “Stop trying to constantly sabotage yourself. The more you fixate on what you think is wrong or will go wrong will just lead you to disaster. Stop. Breathe. And move on.” All in all, it was solid advice but it’s definitely easier said than done. That leads me to where I am tonight. I’ve taken up muggle yoga, a practice Harry introduced to me. He gave me books he found at a muggle book shop in muggle London with Remus and he said that he thought I would enjoy it. And as much as I hate to say Harry’s right, I do enjoy it. It reminds me of occlumency mixed with stretching and they work quite well together from what I’ve seen so far. There’s a lot of different positions you can hold and some seem silly but they get to be rather fun when you’re not so focused on whether or not you look like a fool.
"Might come here for the night if that's okay Sev?" I asked thinking about what kind of chaos might ensue at home.
“Oh come on now, Malfoy! Even as a joke you know Finnigan is the least likely choice! It’s almost as if you wish I would become Head Boy.” His voice was jesting, yet still Hermione let out a protesting
He moved onto the next box, and when he opened it his mouth dropped. Suddenly he was hissing and I felt relief flood through me as a smile blossomed over his face through his conversing with the snake. He slowly brought out the small black snake and there were “oohs” and “ahhs” from the crowd. “She’s absolutely gorgeous Draco,” Harry said with excitement. I only smiled in response.
“Harry James Potter-Snape, of course, you are welcome to join us. Why would you even think differently? Silly boy; that must be what you are,” she said, muttering toward the end with a slightly disappointed shake of her head at Harry. I prayed to Merlin Harry wouldn’t mention us “dating” but it was tempting to let him because it would mean that I wouldn’t have to. “You’ve been coming to the manor since you and Draco were in nappies; I hardly think we’re anything less than family now Harry.” There was love in her voice and a glint in her eyes that always came when she got even slightly mawkish. I could see Harry’s blush under his bronze skin and the way his fingers began twisting around each other like he usually did when he was being shy. I thought about the way she said we were family and gave an inward shudder because the way I have begun to think of Harry was not in an innocent brotherly way. It was an ‘
Thinking of a gift for Harry is only somewhat difficult. I have an idea for what to get him for part of his gift, but the other is still a mystery to me. I could try to find more medical texts, or maybe I could find some rare potions ingredients for some of his healing potions. Maybe while I go to purchase Harry’s first gift I can look around Diagon Alley to get some ideas for his second gift.
“Well, I mean,” Harry starts, “as long as it's nothing crazy. But looking at how worked up you are I'm a bit nervous myself to know exactly what it is you want. Sit down, mate.” Harry grabs at my wrist and gives it a small tug while patting the bed. I breathe in deep and sit down across from Harry. My eyes dart around Harry, taking in his appearance and body language. His hair sits messily on his head, curly hair falling around his eyes. His emerald eyes shine bright behind his black-framed glasses.
“Discover what secret?” At the sound of Harry’s voice, I jolted slightly, his sudden appearance surprising me.
It sounds like a relatively complete list and I don’t think I’ve forgotten a single thing, which makes me content. One thing I’ve always loved to do is write lists. Harry hates it sometimes but it’s something that keeps me organized and keeps me from losing my head.
Harry’s eyes were certainly wet at this point and he tried playing it off by laughing at mother’s attempt at a joke (but it was honestly not really a joke if you truly knew mother and Severus, and I wonder if Harry knew that.) Harry turned to me gave an amused laugh. “I guess when I said that this day has gone quire opposite of how I thought it would it gave fate an open invitation to try and fit as much weird shi-” Harry’s eyes widened as he remembered that my mother still sat with us and he quickly redirected what he was about it say, “things, as much weird things as possible in one day.” I wore a large grin filled with mirth all the while mother wore a confused expression but I ignored it, certainly not wanting to get into anything that’s occurred today. At least until I can no longer put it off. Mother stood and shook out her hands, before turning to us.
“I’ll have you know that I can be all sorts of kinky! I’m not a prude!” I declared and stuck my tongue out at him. Harry let out a hum of false belief with a matching smile.
After traveling through the floo once more, this time with Harry in tow, my nerves almost seem to be doubled what they once were. Now that I’ve gotten one hard part out of the way, it seems I have been dealt with another hard hand to play. Literally. And honestly, I really am a silly dunderhead for even thinking Harry would reject me being gay. For Merlin’s sake, Remus and Sirius have been together since, well since Sirius finally used his Gryffindor senses and swept Remus away from my father apparently. And besides, I’ve seen Harry stare at Diggory more than what is deemed hetero-ly normal.
“No father, Prince Harry,” I stated sarcastically. “I've taken up a thing for redheads you see. I think Ronald Weasley is next on the list.” Father stood staring at me for a moment before turning away and walking to a cabinet of sorts and pulling out an expensive bottle that looked to be Ogden’s Finest. He poured a generous amount before taking a large swig out of the bottle and grimacing from the burn.
“So what…” Harry starts, “you want me to grab you some when they're ready? It's not that far of a walk, Draco, but I'll do it I guess.” Oh, Merlin, I wish it was that simple. A nervous laugh makes it's way past my lips, a ball of hot nerves bouncing up into my throat and down into the depths of my stomach.
. And so Harry, who we all thought would go to Sirius, which he did, mother said, but only for a night, instead was transferred to Severus Snape’s care. She said it was quite unexpected but after Severus joined them for dinner, tiny Harry in tow, he explained it all. He and Lilly apparently had a one-off sometime when James and her and been broken up, and they didn’t think too much of it until it had been a while after she and James had gotten back together and she realized she was pregnant.
"I'm being serious Potter! Father himself told me after I outed myself to him like a fool." Harry opened his mouth to speak. "And no why would he lie about something like this? Don't be ridiculous." Harry's mouth shut. "There isn't anything for him to gain by telling me that. And it truly does make sense when you think about it." Harry sat in silence for a moment before speaking.
“Actually I wasn’t on pot to start with so I can’t really be off it,” Harry voiced through a smile and ended with a laugh.
And everyone expects Harry to go into the Aurors but I expect he’ll go into mediwizardry. It’s always been a quiet fascination of his that was especially fuelled when he was prompted by Severus and Dumbledore to learn first aid through Madame Pomfrey during fourth year because of the Triwizard Tournament, up until the time in sixth year where the war was on the brink of ending or catastrophically pursuing. During those years he learned as much healing through potions from Severus as he could and as many spells as he could from anybody who had knowledge on it. He went through countless books and was always passionate about learning more on the subject.
I don't exactly know how I want to refer to Harry in reference to his last name because in this storyline, in my mind at least, Harry would take Snape on as his last name but keep Potter as an homage to James and Lilly, but I feel that he would want to use Snape as it connects with who he is present-day, not who he could have been with Potter had Lilly and James survived if that makes any sense? But also every time I use Snape it feels out of place and feels like I'm referencing Severus. Any particular thoughts?
“A broom servicing kit, thank you all so much. I had been in need of a new one for ages now!” A snort could be heard from Ron who was sat near me.
“I have a favor to ask of you. Now I understand if you do not wish to go along with it, but please hear me out at least?” I ask pleadingly. Feelings of overwhelming nausea and dizziness are at large now and suddenly I feel regretful of ever even being born.
One thing I had not anticipated was celebrating Harry’s birthday as his fake boyfriend and not as his best friend. I suddenly felt remorse, not for the first time since dragging Harry into my charade. As much as he says that it doesn’t bother him and that it’s a small favor compared to what I’ve done for him I still can’t help but feel regretful and awful for putting him in this position. My developing feelings for Harry make me feel guilty as well, and as much as I hate to admit it, satisfied and pleased that Harry is going along with this charade because it gives me just a taste as to what could have been in a different universe.
“Tomato bisque with grilled cheese, and a pumpkin juice, please Dipsy?” The little elf nods her head fast and squeaks out a
“Master Draco, whats will you be eating for lunch, sir?” I contemplate for a moment before settling on something simple
Curled up into bed for the night I think about owling Harry tomorrow and seeing if he’d like to come over for a while, even if it is to discuss what needs to be determined. I decide that I’ll do it after lunch tomorrow that way it ensures Harry will be awake before I send the owl
"Hey dad, hey moony," Harry greeted as he nudged past me to get to the muffins. He grabbed two before coming back to me and handing me the other one. "Thanks for the muffins Remus," Harry took a large bite of his before muffling out, "they taste delicious." I smacked his shoulder with a look of distaste.
“Y-yes?” I cleared my throat trying to boost up my confidence and ground myself. “Yes, I would. I know you didn’t really feel it important to discuss, but I feel that it is.” I still can’t bring myself to make eye contact with him but I won’t let myself falter in my words.
“Of course, love. We’ll meet you there then,” Mother replied as she grabbed onto father’s forearm and looked up at him expectantly. “Off we go then, Lucius,” her smile sweet. They left with a pop and I turned to Dipsy.
She looked up with a wide smile and began to speak excitedly, “Draco! I found this little fairy as I was watering the other flowers. She was just floating around the flowers admiring them. Isn’t she gorgeous?”
"I solemnly swear I know of nothing between them," I said with an air of fake seriousness, my right hand raised. Harry shook his head at me and snorted. I let the mock seriousness fade and a smile returned to my face. I then remembered why I was really here and I was once again blanketed with worry. It was moments like this that I am afraid to lose if things somehow go wrong. What if Harry begins to resent me? How long do I expect him to carry out this charade? I decided that these were worries I'd later tend to. For now, I had things that needed more prompt action. "We should probably head on over to the manor now if you're ready," I said as I started to stand from Harry's bed.
“We’re going to Spinner’s End, alright Dipsy?” She nodded and with a pop of her own disappeared. I blew out a long breath and put on a smile.
I've noticed that my writing is very dialogue focused and I'm trying to add more substance to it. What do you guys think?
“Oh I’ve been spending most of it with Ron,” she glanced at Ron with a smile as she swung their arms.
“Aw, thank you, love,” I say a wide smile framing my face, “never pegged you as the pet-name type, but it’s quite cute, I must admit.” An iced-over glare is shot my way before Harry drops back on the bed with a deep sigh. ‘This ought to be a bit fun’ I thought as a small smile overtook my face. It was silent for a moment before I remembered my great discovery. "Harry, do you happen to know who Remus once engaged in a relationship with?" Harry sat up with a confused "Uhm" trailing out of his lips.
“Are you sure?” I squeaked out, too shocked to feel embarrassed. “Aren’t you straight and all that?”
"As ready as I'll ever be," Harry said with bravado, though if it was fake I wouldn't doubt it. "We can grab a muffin before we go though right?" Harry was following my lead and standing up from the bed, stretching his arms above his head, his eyes closed as my own eyes trailed down to where his shirt had lifted and golden brown skin was teasingly on display.
“Wha–! Harry! This is what you're worried about?” Harry let out a boisterous laugh. “How are you not worried? Or scared? Or mad even? I told my father, MY FATHER, that we are a couple!” Harry's laughing only increases and he pulls his hands away to clap them together, body bending from his laughter. His laughter dies down and Harry moves to sit up, a faint smile settling on his flushed face.
“Alright,” I started, “I’ll accept and move on. Be happy and celebrate. Should we talk about the whole fake dating thing?” I was nervous to confront it again but I felt it needed to be addressed for Harry’s sake.
“I’ll just put this down over on the table and head in then,” I gave a smile and nod of my head before I left to place the present down, Dipsy still trailing after me. Once I was free of the present I took the treacle from Dipsy and sent her home, and started my walk to the house and into the kitchen. Harry was wearing an apron over a light blue t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans. His shoes were nowhere to be seen, instead, a pair of socks were on his feet. “Happy birthday, Harry,” I walked further into the room smiling. Harry whirled around and gave me a huge smile that lit up his eyes.
“It’s great seeing you again too Dobby,” Harry said with a fond smile. Harry had made friendly with Dobby years ago when Harry would stay the night and mother and father thought we needed to be monitored to ensure we didn’t get
“Apparating, love.” Mother said moving to take one of the smaller presents of mine along with holding their own present for Harry in her hands. “All ready?” I nodded as I replied.
“Oh, Weasley! You’ve found me out! I have been secretly hoping all along we would both one day become Head Boy of our houses and that we would rule over Hogwarts; how ever did you discover my secret?” The sarcasm from my voice dripped off each word I said.
And so I’m glad I’ve been able to form my own ideas and values, and I’m glad my parents have given me the space to become my own individual person, even if they’ve made me “overly posh” as Harry would,
"Y-yeah," I cleared my throat, "Of course we can. Besides, I'd hate to leave Sev and Remus without a proper goodbye." I heard Harry's footsteps fall into step behind me as I made my way back down towards the kitchen where Severus and Remus were still at. This time when I arrived, they were both sitting at the table drinking tea while chatting together. There was a
one of the Weasley twins candies designed to swell your tongue and cause you to sweat while your face turned an incredibly bright shade of red as your temperature safely (though it's debatable just how
Luna and Hermione were the ones most interested in the snake and came up to chat with Harry more and to pet the snake as people once again started to mingle about with each other. Once they seemed to have had their fill, Harry walked over to me and held out the hand the snake had not occupied.
“Oh shit, yeah, sorry about that by the way,” Harry apologized as he rummaged through his drawers and pulling out some bottoms and shifted through his closet for a shirt. Once he acquired an outfit he handed it to me and I made my way to the bathroom. I looked over the items he handed me, a pair of blue and white plaid fleece pajama pants and an old Appleby Arrows Quidditch t-shirt. Pulling on the pants I noticed that they fit me loosely but were at least the right length. Harry was a little shorter than me so I can only imagine the way the pants must bundle up at his feet, and I wondered, not for the first time why he doesn’t send a sizing charm to some of his clothing and make them actually fit him. He’s told me multiple times that it’s for
“Ah, yes. We perhaps should do that rather soon, shouldn’t we? I’ll gather people around, you go stand near the presents.” Harry mock saluted and began to turn us around and tread us towards the covered table. I detached from Harry’s arm and sat off to the side of the presents table enough to where I could still see Harry perfectly, but wouldn’t be directly in his line of sight. Soon enough people were gathered around to watch Harry receive his first present from Severus.
“As both, you and my mother, have deigned to remind me, yes. It is almost time. Are you ready to put on the best act of your life?”
“See you around, Harry.” Hermione started to tug Ron off to where I could see Luna and Ginny sitting together with Neville. What an interesting couple Luna and Ginny were. Both had once liked Harry, and instead found they liked girls. Do you think I should expect the same then?
There should be more to a marriage than just benefits. And that's what I should have all said to my father. But instead, I panicked because my father wouldn't understand. He was raised, and raised me, to not think that there was nothing more important than wealth, status, and carrying on the Malfoy legacy. Too bad I defected. So instead of saying the truth, I blurted out something that even surprised me.
“I called you peaches because you’re sweet, soft, and innocent. Just like a peach,” Harry said smugly. “Now, come along peaches. I want to whip your arse at finding the snitch, and I promise not to use an actual whip… just yet.” Harry started laughing hard as he stood up, making his way towards the door. My face was again in flames and I felt them to my core. Harry Snape-Potter will be the death of me and he doesn’t even know it. And if he does, he surely doesn’t care.
“I’m quite sure. And I thought so too, but after wanking to a bloke you start to see things a little less straight.” I couldn’t help but let out a guffaw at his response and had an inkling that my anxiety aided in that laughter. “But seriously, I think I’m bisexual. I hope that isn’t an issue?” His voice trailed off in uncertainty and I quickly made it known that his worries were unfounded.
“Yeah, we ought to,” I said with a slight frown remembering the events that transpired earlier. Harry mumbled a soft okay before he flicked his hands and the lights dimmed, a warm glow falling upon us. That was another thing that was so mesmerizing about Harry. He performed wandless magic with casual ease and with it came his warmth of magic settling around the room with a force that was undeniable but wasn’t stifling.
“Do you plan on hanging out here for a formal invite in your own house or might we be able to venture further in?”
) look on his face, “I must admit that I, myself, have had my fair share of boys at Hogwarts,” he said with a wink. I tried my best, I promise I did, but I couldn’t help the mock gagging from happening.
“You're father's going to kill me, right? You've come here to warn me I've only got a few hours left?”
“So, what does bring the birthday boy to us?” Severus asked as he looked at Harry, his own soft smile on his face. Harry’s cheeks were a warm pink.
My morning is another quiet affair. Breakfast with my parents as usual, with light conversation. Father leaving for the ministry after saying his goodbyes to us both. Mother and I then take a walk through the gardens, until she leaves for tea with Aunt Andromeda and Mrs. Weasley. Then it’s just me. This is the same routine we’ve lived for years now so it’s no surprise how my morning plays out. Simple. Kind of lonely some days, though I will admit. It’s nearly lunch when Dipsy pops in the conservatory where I’ve been settled since mother left.
"You two are just bullies," Harry grumbled out as he grabbed his second muffin. "Hey dad, is it fine if I go over to the manor to have dinner with Draco?" Snape nodded.
I did take notice that I never saw Harry’s mother around when we were little and thank Merlin I was instilled with enough decorum to not blatantly ask Harry in my little child stupidity why he didn’t have one, but it also helped that I had my simple-minded child brain and didn’t care enough to focus on more than playing with Harry. I eventually asked my own mother when I was older and had enough sense in me to understand things with more clarity and comprehension. She was honest with me and explained who Voldemort was and how he killed Harry’s mum and dad, and even tried to hurt Harry but he miraculously survived and even somehow killed Voldemort.
“Your mother has always liked me more so I’d have to agree,” Harry started. “I don’t think I’m exactly ready to face Lucius Malfoy yet. Also, mate you might want to get that hand sweating checked out.” Harry said seriously before cracking a large grin and laughing. I shoved his shoulder away and rolled my eyes.
“That was horrible and I hated it.” Harry let out a laugh that fluttered the walls of my heart. Truthfully it was a sickeningly cute comment but no one has to know that. He grabbed the container from e and gave me a brief kiss on the cheek, shocking me still, my face turning a deep pink fast. I scrambled to catch a grip before I lost my mind. “O-oh?”
It has been almost a week since Harry and I have started fake dating and not much has changed other than the fact that my mother has taken to consistently reassuring me that it’s okay for Harry to come over more or vice versa and while he’s over we shouldn’t shy away from each other now that they know. And while the thought and encouragement is greatly appreciated it’s only stressed me out. I’ve been sort of worried that the reason she’s so persistent is that she and my father don’t believe me. Harry of course disagrees. He just thinks that she’s trying to push me to be happier and make sure that I’m aware of her support. And his reasoning isn’t far fetched or crazy, I’m just a paranoid bastard.
Harry and I walked towards a gathering of tables sat by the food that was laid out for the guests when we noticed my parents and assumed Severus was going to be there. Walking up to the table our parents noticed us and their conversation died down.
“Yes, masters Draco? Oh, mister Harry Potter, it is so good to be seeing you again!” Dobby exclaimed with excitement at seeing his long time, favored friend.
“Ready as I’ll ever be Harold.” And with that, I grabbed Harry’s hand gripping it perhaps tighter than necessary and begun to pull him out of the reception room and into the foyer where I called for Dobby.
“That was not funny. I can’t believe you genuinely just said that. Are you sure you’re not high now?” I was still laughing, his comments fueling me to continue.
Since I’ve been young my father tried instilling a sense of family pride that was rooted in wealth, prestige, and diluted pure-blood beliefs. Father, nor mother for that matter, never used the ‘m’ word I’ve heard some students at Hogwarts and portraits around the manor use. He’s never expressed explicit hate towards muggle-borns and half-bloods, but he’s always talked about pure-bloods having a greater responsibility to keeping “our population” plentiful considering “we’re a dying breed”. And because father was ever so insistent on “replenishing the dying breed”, I felt that perhaps he would be homophobic. Because even though it seems that both my mother and father have broken away from their parents’ ideas and views, some of them still lingered, even if they were thought and taught with good intentions.
As I approached my mother’s hunched figure, hair tied up, and dirt was smeared randomly among her body, I could hear her talking to someone, yet no one was around.
Harry said ‘darling’ in a way that felt as though it was dripping saccharinely. Merlin, I can’t believe I got myself in this and then proceeded to bring the most Gryffindor Slytherin into this.
“Quidditch,” I shoot out immediately before registering that he said peaches. “Peaches? What do you mean?” I eyed Harry with distrust, my face still flushed.
Already upon arriving I could see people bustling around the selected part of the grounds where the gathering was being held. I could see my parents talking to Severus, the presents now in the hands of Severus. I made my way over to them Dipsy following. After reaching them Severus greeted me.
Thinking of Harry’s gift to me lead me to remember his birthday that is fastly approaching. In nine days Harry will be 17, an adult in the eyes of the wizarding world. He wanted something big enough that all his friends and family could be there, celebrating more than just a birthday, but a start to a new year not poisoned by Voldemort’s presence. A year that Harry can finally take back as his own without fear. It’s a birthday to Harry that symbolizes freedom and peace. I want to make this birthday special for Harry, I want him to embrace who he has become and start to finally love and care for himself like he’s always pushing others to do.
“Pleasant? I may just beg to differ,” Severus said with a snort. “Harry is in his room assuming that is who you’re here for.”
“I think I might regret introducing you to muggle television.” Harry’s smile said differently. “So, ready to brave the wolves?”
“B-but,” I started, stammering my way through what I was trying to say, “what about mother?” Father looked ready to laugh, “what about her?” I looked at him incredulously, “w-what about her!? Does she know? And- and you still flirt with him!” At this point, father was laughing.
“Hello, Severus. Thank you. Where’s Harry?” I looked around trying to catch a glimpse of his hair but I didn’t see a flash of black hair anywhere.
I let out a laugh reading his letter to me, reveling in the sass Harry sent back my way. I was confused by his use of muggle phrasing as usual, but I didn’t focus too much on it. With a little under 20 minutes till Harry was to arrive, I set off to the library to catch up on some reading.
"No? I never really thought to ask him much past his relationship with Sirius. As I should. That's a weird question Draco" Harry had begun to mumble and gave his hair a tousle as his face contorted in confusion. Okay, yes it was a little weird in how I brought it up, but how else do you tell your best friend that one of his godfathers once dated his best friend's dad?
“What sort of snake is it Draco?” Hermione, of course, was the first person to say anything let alone a question.
“Yes, I am. I think I’ll apparate there myself, it’ll be a bit easier than trying to hold onto one of you and the box.”
“I was actually going to see when dad wanted to do everything. I think we might do it soon though. Come with?” Harry held his arm out to me and I nodded a confirmation linking my arm with his. “We’ll talk to you guys later, yeah?”
Chapter one was quite short and I thought about adding this chapter to it, but this chapter itself is almost 2000 words and I don't want the chapters too uneven in length considering I've already begun working on the next chapters. So sorry for that jump in length even though it wasn't too tremendous. I hope to keep a more consistent length in the future, if not a little longer.
I let out a groan of annoyance, before speaking up, “What room do you even have to talk Snotter? You barely kissed Chang and Luna turned out to be a lesbian so unless she found out in the middle of you both getting it on, I don’t suppose you have much experience either.” Harry snorted.
“No,” he began as he sat down on a chair that sat across from me, “but it will help me from having a psychotic breakdown, Draco.” He took another drink before leaning his head back and closing his eyes, “no thanks to you, might I add.”
“Well, for the record, I don't have a problem with you being gay, you should know that you silly dunderhead,”
“Honestly, I haven’t got much planned further than tomorrow these days, and it’s the most relieving thing to know. After spending so many summers preparing to finally take Voldemort down and spending my school years fighting him, it feels odd to have free time, well, all the time.” Harry’s voice bled with a relieved and incredulous tone, but his face held a thoughtful expression. “This past Easter holiday break was a turning point in my life and truthfully, I doubted that I would survive Voldemort. I never saw a future past the war with Voldemort.” His voice was somber and his gaze no longer lingered on my mother but off in the distance. His eyes were glazed over and his face was devoid of any apparent emotion. The once lighthearted conversation had now taken a drastic turn that I hadn’t expected. “Dad and Draco have been instrumental in my so-called “rehabilitation” into a normal teen boy as dad calls it though,” Harry shoots me a smile, his eyes soft. I melt at the look Harry sends me and at his compliment, sending him a soft look back. It was true though, as foolish as Harry may make it sound. Harry’s fight with Voldemort was not simple nor painless, and so coming out of the war he was left with ragged edges and a bruised mind and soul. He suffers from a slight case of PTSD now and wakes fretfully from nightmares most nights, though he promises that they’ve gotten better lately. Harry has yet to tell me the entire truth of what transpired the night of the final battle, but from watching the arrival of Harry being apparated by Severus from Parkinson Manor after being missing for 3 days to the grounds of Hogwarts a mess of bruises, bloody cuts and gashes, torn clothing, and dirt I knew it was nothing anyone could walk away from without deeper, mental infliction.
in that comment, appreciating how much Draco was there for him through all the strife. He apologised for James’ behaviour at the burrow.
“I can’t believe you’re here.” Harry could not take his eyes off Draco as they waited at the packed bar.
Harry groaned, begging Draco to drop that topic. He sent Ted to lunch, with instructions to be back in an hour to cover Eric’s lunch break. With two hours free before his assistant was back in the hot shop, Harry offered to take Draco out for lunch, which of course he agreed to. Although apprehensive, Draco agreed to trust Harry to take him for a meal on Diagon Alley. There was a popular new Vietnamese place that Harry Potter could get them into with no notice. Harry took Draco upstairs to the mezzanine where he had a quick shower, changing out of his sweaty glassblowing clothes and into something slightly smarter. He apologised for his attire, explaining that he only kept a few items of clothing at work in case of last-minute plans. Draco kept the fact that he looked completely delectable in his loose t-shirt, scruffy blue jeans and Vans to himself.
Well, Jamie came along, and I was besotted from the moment I laid eyes on him. Ginny had been back and forth over whether to be involved with bringing him up all through her pregnancy, but once she saw him, she realised she wanted to be his mum. Those first few years were non-stop. Gin was away most of the time with the team, so she was only really helping for a couple of months in the summer. The rest of the time there was just me, raising my boy, and working full time as an auror. I was lucky to have Molly and Andromeda to look after him while I worked, and my days passed in a blur of crack of dawn wake ups and ferrying him back and forth around my shifts. On my days off I had Ted as well as Jamie; I was adamant Ted would be part of our family and not grow up as alone as I did. This worked well for me, or so I thought at the time, as my days were so full, I could fall into bed and be asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. There was no time to think about the war, or to mourn, to consider the consequences of my sexuality, or to sort through my feelings about my horrific childhood. That was the way I liked it. I was barely managing to get us washed, dressed, and fed each day, and lived in a constant state of adrenaline highs and lows.
Draco bombarded Harry with questions about the glassblowing demonstration he had witnessed while they waited for their starters of green mango salad and fresh spring rolls. The food was exquisite, and so was the company, the back and forth demonstrative of their ease in each other’s company. True to Harry's word, Draco was completely safe from confrontation during their outing, with Harry such a regular face on Diagon Alley that the shoppers barely spared him a second glance. Draco relaxed as their meal progressed, revelling in the company of the man who knew him so well, and could match him both in intellect and friendly verbal sparring.
“Language James!” Admonished Molly, seemingly unable to find anything else to criticise in his outburst. Molly had never taken to Lavender, still unable to get over Ron leaving Hermione, and that was over ten years ago.
“I cannot believe you have a kid who is of age. Honestly, I can’t believe any of us are old enough.” Draco took a sip of the drink and gave Ginny a thumbs up.
“Oh yeah,” said Harry, before making his way over to Draco. He caught the water bottle Ted threw to him, and took a long, refreshing drink.
Returning to his cooking, Harry continued to dance along to the radio as he added garlic, spices, and vegetables. He poured coconut milk into the pan, adding the chicken, and setting it to simmer before taking a seat at the table with his friends.
“Yeah it looks good Uncle Harry,” replied Ted, wiping his forehead with the back of his hand. “You want some water?”
"I might've forgotten a few times, but at least I remember most times." Severus let out a pained sigh and waved his hand in a dismissive motion.
And so I pull on the shirt, feeling it hang a little loose on me too, but this one at least fit right lengthwise. It felt odd wearing Harry’s clothes that smelled like him and were just so
I was about ready to move onto my next ramble of thought processes before Harry’s warm voice interrupted me.
“Hardy har har, Draco. You're sure they'll believe this right?” Harry asked with a sense of uncertainty.
“Draco, do please try and at least seem interested,” father said with a sigh. His left hand came up to rub at the bridge of his nose.
“Well, it was actually more than that if I'm honest. We definitely have dated.” I can't believe this. Remus Lupin, one of Harry’s godfathers, Sirius Black’s- oh my Merlin!
The dinner scene isn't my favorite and if I'm honest I struggled to write it which is why it took so long for this chapter to be posted. So I do apologize for that. Hopefully, so far the story is interesting enough and you enjoy reading it though :)
“More than,” I breathed out, and before I know it Harry was pulling his hands up to cup my face and his soft lips molded with my own. I could feel the slight wetness of his mouth until a slide of tongue brushed against my lips and I opened them graciously. Bringing my own hands up to nestle in and grip Harry’s hair I could feel his tongue slide against my own before it left to discover other parts of my mouth and I followed suit. The slick wetness burned a fire deep within me and I felt shy to realize I was growing hard. I went to pull away to gather some air and some sense and as I did so Harry caught my bottom lip with his teeth in a slight grip and pulled. I let out a moan faster than I could have stopped it and feel myself glow with the heat that coursed through me.
“How dramatic, Potter. He simply wants you over for dinner tonight, which should be fun don't you think?” My head tilts to the side as I study Harry's face, trying to gauge his reaction. There's a weight that feels to have been lifted from my shoulders because of Harry's seeming acceptance of this all.
I almost couldn't help the gigantic smile from blossoming on my face; instead, I settled for a small amused grin, “father, whatever do you mean?” He looked up and gave me a look that blatantly said
“Well father,” I began, “it's been how long since yule?” Lucius stared at me for a second before knocking back a gulp of the rest of the scotch and sighing to himself. We sat in silence forever and my nerves were starting to fray. I wanted to know what he was thinking. I wanted to know if he was disappointed in me, or furious. If he planned to disown me or embrace me in a hug of- well maybe not a hug- but give me a firm handshake, while one hand rested on my shoulder with a smile on his face as he told me he’d be happy with whatever I wanted because- my internal monologue was quickly cut off by my father's voice.
“Are you ready to talk about it all now?” I sighed and rolled out onto my back from where I was on the floor.
I am now left with the task of making Harry’s treacle tart for tomorrow. I leave for the kitchen with a pep in my step, feeling good about how things have been going so far. Though Harry had taken to showing me a side of himself that is completely foreign I was all too happy to follow along in his footsteps even if my own actions were slightly toned down in comparison to Harry’s. His blatant, what seemed to be, flirting was never something I had expected to encounter when this all started and it typically left me in a flushed mess. Harry’s teasing from a few days ago truly set me alight and it didn’t help that I forwardly encouraged it. That night I had possibly the best orgasm of my life thinking of Harry as I touched myself to completion. The shame I felt afterward was minimal in comparison to the pleasant feeling of euphoria.
“I'm dating Harry, father. I can't very well marry a woman while committed to a man, now can I?” I could hardly hold back the choke of surprise that overtook me. Wonderful. Way to go Draco. You’ve really outdone yourself this time.
With the final product of one treacle tart made, it is set in a special dish that preserves whatever food is placed inside and set aside for tomorrow.
“What does that even mean? Harry no, I meant you’re loony. Like crazy?” He really does concern me sometimes.
“Goodnight, Harry,” I whispered in reply, as I let the sounds of his breathing lull me deeper into relaxation and deeper into slumber. My last conscious thought being
“Thank you, Narcissa. You know how much that means to me.” And she does. Harry and mother have always had a bond that neither me or father or hell even Harry’s family even understood. But its always sweet to watch them together and Harry has even mentioned to me that he thinks Lilly would be content to know that Narcissa Malfoy of all people takes such good care of him. Mother held a fond smile and gestured towards the other chairs surrounding the table.
“Well, I mean… It's not like I want to think about you and mother dating people!” I was strangely intrigued by the idea of this pairing. And more importantly, when has my father ever liked guys? One too many events have happened in the last hour, and I am suddenly well worn out. I glance longingly at the liquor cabinet and my father’s empty short tumbler. Just as I finished my inwards battle on whether or not I should just get up and get some, my father spoke.
Gods, what did I just imply?! What does Harry think I’ve just implied? This is loony. I’m loony. I need to be checked into the Janus Thickey ward.
Severus desperately wanted to cease his part-time career spying for Harry’s sake, but Harry insisted to him that only harm would ensue from that decision. Harry said they would fight constantly about it until one day he told Severus that he didn’t have to worry about losing him as his son because no matter what Harry would love him and accept him. Harry told me that that was one of the few times he’d ever seen his dad cry and hold him.
As I neared his room I could hear the soft rumble of a rock song and the added sound of drumsticks tapping to the beat. I opened his door quietly and saw Harry sitting with his back towards the door; wild black hair flopping with every flail of his arms. I shut the door with a soft click and leaned against the door for a moment. Suddenly I felt nervous. What if Harry truly doesn't want to go through with my plans? What will I do then? Well, there's no way to know except to ask.
“Well, I was going to spend my morning trailing the gardens for the 7,000th time but I thought I’d rather come and spend this special day with a special person.” My hands gripped the case that held the treacle tart and I felt brazen to have flirted so shamelessly but remembered that I had an excuse to do so. Harry’s eyes were soft and his smile was still wide.
“You make a compelling argument. Merlin, how did everyone not already ask if we've been dating?" Harry said in a bewildered tone, his face matching his sentiment. "Well, you'd have a bigger selection of fake boyfriends if you'd make friends with more people besides the Weasley’s and me. Which brings me to ask; redheads not your type, Malfoy? This all sounds a bit discriminatory,” Harry said with a straight face, hands still holding both of mine and eyes staring straight into my own.
“I’ll see you both, in a bit, yes? Dinner should be in ten minutes roughly and I expect to see you both on time,” she spoke sternly, but we knew it wasn’t in bad nature. And with that she took her leave. Once the doors softly shut behind her, I resumed our conversation, turning my eyes back to Harry’s own.
"Don't act too put off, dad. I know it must break your heart each time I leave. Your precious, loving, darling son. Don't worry I'll be back within due time." Harry wore a shit-eating grin and held his hands up in a swooning position. I rolled my eyes and tugged at one of his forearms.
“Yes, well. What kind of luck should boy wonder really expect, hmm?” I let out my own laugh as Harry groaned and rolled his eyes.
“They is being in different places sirs. Mrs. Malfoy is still in the gardens and Mr. Malfoy is in his study.”
So as we lay about eating the cookies we made, which was another thing that rubbed off on me: Harry’s love for cooking, I’ve pondered my life and I think about Harry’s and how they’ve merged into something so effortless. I certainly don’t remember the first time meeting Harry but I also can’t tell you a time when he wasn’t around.
“Remus said he’s making muffins and they’ll be done soon,” I blurt out. We sit in silence and I feel my body go aflame. I am a bloody fucking idiot, sweet Merlin.
“So we won’t run the montage of every dumb thing you’ve gotten yourself into thus far?” I asked slyly with a slight smile. Harry let out a sigh that had traces of a hidden laugh.
“Harry,” she began, “it’s so lovely to see you. I assume you will be joining us for dinner, yes?” Harry’s curly and unruly hair bobbed with the shake of his head. His dark skin and bright eyes were glowing from the sun in a way that almost made me wish that we truly were dating. Which was absolutely preposterous because Harry is straight and Harry is my best friend and Harry is bloody gorgeous,
We’ll have to discuss if anyone should know the truth of our “dating” and even though he said we should see how it goes, I seriously think we should decide just when and how we will end things. The sooner Harry is free from this the better. I’d hate to be the reason he can’t get a girlfriend, especially if this goes into our seventh year and girls see that we’re “together”, they’re going to think he’s gay and that doesn’t help a straight male pull in any ladies.
before popping out of the room, leaving me alone once again. I decided to write my letter to Harry now, that way it’s prepared for when I’m ready to send it off and call for Dobby to bring me my supplies. Once I am equipped with a quill and parchment I start my brief letter to him.
Harry stumbled over his words before speaking with a look of disbelief on his face, “what? I mean honestly, what? You’re evil, Draco. An evil git.”
be proud of our heritage, but not for those reasons. We all in the wizarding world should hold pride in being wizards who’ve been blessed with the abilities we have. But we shouldn’t lord them over those without our capabilities, like squibs or muggles. We should use the abilities we have for good, not abuse the power we have like Grindelwald or Voldemort once did.
“Yes, sir.” I made my way to head out through the doorway but just as I was about to step clear of the kitchen I paused. “Oh! Remus, I never would have pegged you as the type to have a thing for blonde Slytherins, but we're all full of surprises I guess, no?” A smirk found its way on my lips and Remus looked shocked and red. Behind me, I heard Severus erupt in laughter as I continued my trek to Harry's room upstairs.
Seconds after I finish conducting my letter and calling for Dobby to take care of the supplies and to mail off the letter, Dipsy comes in with my lunch. I thank her before she pops out of the room and I start in on my lunch. Half an hour later I am finished with my meal and awaiting Harry’s reply until in comes an owl from one of the open windows in the conservatory. Harry’s response is brief and written on the back of my own letter.
It’s the day before Harry’s birthday and I can now successfully say that I’ve completed six of the seven items on my
“Good, because I think I’d really like to kiss you right now if that’s okay?” My breath caught in my throat.
“Draco, hello.” He sent Dipsy a glance, “She may put that in the kitchen, and the present are to be put upon that table over there.” He gestured with his head to a table with a small gathering of presents.
say. He’s been talking forever about loosening me out of my overly formal way of being, and he has made slight progress considering you don’t hang around someone for Merlin knows how many years and not pick something up from them. But I suppose that when you’re taught at an early age how to speak and behave in a certain way it doesn’t wear off easily.
He closed his eyes and let out a deep, long sigh before speaking, “how long have you been dating the Potter boy?” I had to think quickly of a date that was believable. Memories with dates rushed through my mind when suddenly the perfect one came barreling through to the front of my mind.
“Really Ron? It’s Headmistress McGonagall; have some respect. And you know you shouldn’t be encouraging bad behavior in the lower years!” Hermione exclaimed. Seeing Hermione scold Ron seemed like the perfect opportunity to do the same.
“Draco, I want Harry here for dinner tonight if he is able to make it,” he opened the door to the room and walked out shutting it quietly behind him, leaving me alone in the room. I immediately let out a large sigh and stood up, planning to make my way to the garden to let mother know that I’d be out for a while, and possibly back with Harry in tow.
“Father,” I began, feeling scandalized, “what do you mean by your “fair share” of boys?” Lucius sat with a smirk on his face and nostalgia-filled eyes.
“How long?” He asked as he went back into his previous position. I was a bit caught off guard at his question. How long what? How long have I been gay? I'd say about my whole life. How long have Harry and I been in this so-called relationship? I'd say about 2 minutes give or take.
“Simple, We tell no one the truth that way it eliminates any way your parents find out that we’ve been lying. And we break up mid to late August and say that it just wasn’t working out and we’re better off friends.” Well… that is rather simple and not at all complex like I’ve been imagining.
“Please father,” I began, “be more specific in your inquiry. It is quite unbecoming of a Malfoy to have imprecision of their language.” I might’ve been dead if looks could kill.
Lucius looked quite surprised. Hell, even I was trying my best not to look surprised. He mouthed like a goldfish for several seconds before actually saying anything.
“Well, you're the only one it made sense to say really, we're always together, we hug and cuddle, we're moving in together after this school year finishes.” Harry winces. “I mean we might as well be together at this point. Who else do I bring around my parents and do all of that with?”
Remus, the man who regularly bakes with Harry and me, the man who loves laying outside in the sun in the grass and reading a book, the man who would shy away from a single compliment given to him, the man who constantly yells at Sirius and Harry for roughhousing in the house, dated my father. A man who believed in precision and cold masks. He detested clumsiness. That’s all Remus is! How can an uptight stickler, have once dated my best friend’s calm, giggly, awkward uncle?
