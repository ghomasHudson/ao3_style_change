He realized as he was about to leave through the front doors, he was still in pyjamas, and his one pair of clothes was without a sleeve. He quickly scanned the room, looking for a change of clothes, and to his absolute amazement, he noticed Pomfrey had left him a new set of robes that weren’t bloodstained or ripped. They were laying on a chair opposite Draco’s bed, and he wondered how he didn’t spot them before.
Draco was taken aback at Potter’s compliment. “Thanks.”
He still couldn’t quite wrap his head around the whole situation that was unraveling before him. Why did all of this stuff have to happen to him? Hadn’t he already suffered enough? Was this the universe’s way of getting revenge for all of the horrible stuff he had done? But if that were true, why was Potter also here? Potter had done absolutely nothing wrong. It all didn’t make sense. There were so many questions he had, it felt like it was impossible for them all ever to be answered.
The sad part was, as he told this exactly to Harry, the Wizarding World would probably let it happen, once Drys had ignited the flame.
He hoped that after facing death, literally right in the face, he could someday be ready to admit that to Harry. He couldn’t bear the thought of actually dying, without saying those three words to him.
“During our seventh year, three years after we had become friends, we wanted to leave a mark on the school in some form. A mark that would exist for eternities, and one that only a few would be able to find.”
He made a half-hearted attempt at getting up from his comfortable position next to Harry, and wasn’t surprised to find he had moved literally nowhere. His body and brain were exhausted, he didn’t have enough willpower to move back to his bed. He’d wake up before Harry and switch beds, so Harry wouldn’t ever find out Draco had fucking laid next to him and stroked his hair like a total creep. Yeah, he’d wake up earlier than Harry, it would all work out fine.
already,” Draco snapped. He could feel his temper rising in him, and it was all he could do to stop himself from breaking his probation restrictions and cursing Potter senseless.
Harry was right. He wouldn’t have cared about Harry’s feelings or his thoughts about the situation a week ago, but now, Harry’s own feelings truly mattered to him. “Salazar, Harry, you might actually be right for once,” Draco smirked.
The bare minimum of that list consisted of:
A Slytherin tie.
All possibilities of
The wind and snow whipped past them, Harry’s hair stark black with white flakes clinging, and Draco’s hair surely looking even more white than usual.
“Hi,” Draco said.
, and that he’d deal with it, since Harry was obviously ill. “Alec kidnapped me, that’s what.” Draco couldn’t see Harry’s face, but Harry was clearly shooting looks at Alec that could kill. “He played all innocent and lost, and I said I’d explain what was going on. Then, the moment I turned my back, he cast a stinging jinx at me. I threw a spell at him, and then we were practically dueling-” he started coughing once again.
“I’m sorry, I know this is uncomfortable for you, but it needs to be changed. Now why don’t you just-”
“I- I invaded your privacy, Draco! I was just worried about you, though. I thought something was wrong. I thought you were hurting yourself.”
The owl perched on the window sill, and in its beak was a small letter that was horrifically torn and discolored, of course, courtesy of Azkaban. He stood motionless, staring at the letter with thoughts of disbelief and incredulousness flowing through him. Someone had written back.
“Not enjoying your party?”
too much. It’s a bad habit- makes people feel they can walk all over you.”
Draco had to close his eyes as the impact of what Drys was saying hit him. He did remember that day, now that he was reminded of it. It had been late June, right after Dumbledore’s death, when all the raids and killings of Muggle-borns and Muggles started. The media hadn’t gotten a hold on what exactly the Death Eaters and the Dark Lord had been doing then. There had been surprise attacks at homes of known Muggle-borns; the Kaspians being a part of one of those first attacks.
Working up a bit of courage he had somewhere deep down inside of him, Draco finally said, after finishing chewing his bite of roast beef; “How have your classes been? You know-- since you got back.”
“How? How did you know that spell? It’s extraordinary!”
“Harry never did anything to hurt me, Pansy,” he finally responded, astonished.
“Alright, Harry, I’ll play your little game. But first, you have to tell me what
He was kissing Harry Potter.
“Thanks for your false words of encouragement, Malfoy.”
“You look confused.”
So what they had to reveal some sort of secret. How was the book supposed to know what was inside their brain? How did Snape
“Oh.” Draco’s heart did a flip. “That’s good.”
Narcissa was suddenly standing in front of Draco, her face still one of complete and utter shock.
Draco dramatically rolled his eyes, making sure Pansy would see. “There is nothing to tell. Nothing.”
“Ugh! I
A creaking noise sounded from Davis’ bed, indicating that someone was standing up, and sure enough Blaise was carefully removing himself from Davis’ side.
Whoever praised optimism was a right foul tosser, for the sole fact that the idea ‘if you think things are going to go precisely how you want them to go, then they will’, was right. Which was so far from right Draco didn’t even know where to start.
“I guess I’m ready to walk.” Draco said, even though he very much wasn’t ready.
“Hating me? Wanting me dead?” Draco offered. “Yes. I knew they would. The looks everyone gave my family and I when we were escorted through the Ministry was nauseating, and they were all people I’d never met in my life. So, of course, the students I had personally bullied and made fun of back at Hogwarts would be even more upset with me. It only made sense. But the three reasons I had
Draco hoped it was the former, but he had an inkling it was the latter.
Through all the movement and voices, Draco could just make out Harry on the other side of the hall. He was accompanied by Granger and Weasley. All three of them were looking at him, and Hermione gave him a smile and a thumbs up, which he appreciated.
A group of four Third Years were huddled together at a table and slouched over piles of books. They were all dozing peacefully, shoulders rising up and down. But the positions they were in were
Draco noticed he was the only one left. All the chairs were still arranged in a circle, and he observed that someone had accidentally left a quill on the ground. He started to walk towards it, and was about to pick it up and stuff it in his bag, because he could use an extra quill, when he heard a noise coming from directly outside the door. His head immediately shot up, and his arm was still extended towards the quill, when the noise came again. He recognized it as a faint drum of laughter. Without hesitation, his hand came to grasp his wand, which was in his trouser pocket, and he pulled it out, brandishing it in front of him.
“Sure. Now spill.”
“I just don’t understand how it didn’t work. It should have worked. Something must be wrong with the book. Give it-” Draco reached out for the book, attempting to snatch it from Potter’s tight grip, but he wasn’t fast enough, and Potter pulled the book away and out of Draco’s reach.
“Seriously?”
“Harry,” he stated before he could stop himself. After that surprise, he was surprised once more, realizing he was on the seventh floor corridor, right by the Room of Requirement.
She rushed over to hug him and although he was grateful, he was a bit confused.
“You’ve been trying to deal with this yourself?” Harry whispered. “Oh, Draco…”
“There are not enough words in any language to describe how sorry I am for lying to you, Harry, and snogging you last night with the weight of all my lies was wrong! I know now! I’m so, so sorry. Just- please don’t wander the castle alone. It’s truly not safe. Please.”
Draco was about to silently slip out from under the covers and go back to his bed when Harry opened his eyes, staring directly at Draco.
“Wait! WAIT! Please, just take me!” Drys cried out.
“I know it’s weird to say this now,” Harry cut in for the first time since Draco started talking. “But I’m glad you didn’t choose the first option. It’s terribly selfish for me to say that, but I felt relieved at that moment. I thought that since you refused, my blood would be kept out of Drys’ plan. He clearly couldn’t use the blade on me himself, and I truly thought I was safe when you refused. Even though it was hard to make sense of everything at that time, your decision then was what stuck with me.” Harry sheepishly smiled at Draco. “So, thank you for that.”
and he was pretty sure he screamed, and then there were reassuring hands and breaths right by his side. Those breaths were there when he needed them most. Although, he couldn’t even begin to guess who it belonged to.
Potter had it easy. Sure, maybe he was plagued with all the deaths that happened in the war, and maybe he felt everything that had happened over the past couple of years was his fault, but at least he didn’t have to deal with a reminder of all his past mistakes etched onto his skin. Potter’s scar was a trophy of his heroism and bravery. Even if he did receive the damn thing when he was a baby.
Draco didn’t use the blade on Harry was an even worse outcome.
“Harry?” Draco called out. He turned in his spot, his wand shining light throughout the corridor. “Harry, if you’re there, please come out. You don’t even have to talk to me, and I don’t have to talk to you if you’d rather me be silent, but I don’t want to be alone, and I’m sure you don’t either and-” he was making matters worse, he knew it. But he was scared. He was scared out of his mind. He hated being alone, it really was the truth.
. Why couldn’t she see that?
“We don’t know why it’s up. But, I feel like that’s honestly a pretty good guess. It’s strange that this happened on the same day we find out everyone in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade is under some sort of spell.”
He sat up in bed and ran a hand through his hair. He wondered why Potter hadn’t woken him from his vision. Perhaps he hadn’t been restless, and had slept peacefully on the outside. He knew that on the inside however he
. It seemed they were back to Potter and Malfoy now.
As they made their way to Slughorn’s classroom, Draco noticed something different about Potter. He hoped it wasn’t related to the secret he’d told Draco, because it really did not bother him; Potter’s confession hit close to home for him and he would never judge Potter for crying in front of him. He would be a hypocrite if he did. But no, he seemed timid, almost. He was obviously lost in thought as they walked the empty halls, and Draco was immensely curious as to what he was thinking about.
“That’s great. But what does it mean? And how does this book hold anything useful to us?”
But why did it feel like he couldn’t make the decision?
Harry leaned in to give Draco a quick, soft kiss on the lips. “When did you become so modest?”
to look at the wretched thing. He was only ever tempted when it started writhing; it made him want the damned thing gone more than ever.
Draco closed his eyes, taking in how Harry’s bed was much more comfortable than his own; or maybe it wasn’t the bed that made him feel like that. “No problem.”
“I know. I
In the end, it did turn out that Draco had wasted their precious, limited time. Was he surprised that had happened? Honestly, not really.
Harry didn’t seem to get the memo, and was attempting to pull Draco back into his arms when Draco had to push at Harry’s chest, his eyes pleading for Harry to leave him alone.
Draco supposed he should tell Potter about the ‘two weeks’ warning he had in his dream. He felt like it was somehow connected, and it wouldn’t hurt to get Potter’s opinion on the subject at hand.
eat at the same time.
Eventually Draco lifted his head off of Harry’s shoulders and looked him straight in the eye. “Why are you doing this?” He asked hoarsely.
As if sensing that Draco was already starting to sweat, Harry squeezed his hand tighter. Draco squeezed back.
The kitchen started to clear, softly and slowly, but the kitchen wasn’t his focus.
Harry how he was so experienced, to which he had responded, “Ginny,” which only made Draco kiss him more.
But, a little part of him was trying to make excuses for what had happened with Drys.
This birthday had turned out to be one of his best, all because of a dorky Gryffindor in glasses. He guessed he had Pansy to thank, since her party did lead to all of this.
“About yourself?”
“Very funny. But seriously, go back to casting. I’ll find out what’s making the noise and be back in a minute. You could be practicing very useful spells right now.”
“Mrs. Parkinson,” Professor McGonagall stated from beside Pansy. Her lips were set in a firm line, and Pansy finally realized who was standing there. She visibly blanched at the actuality that she had just pushed the Headmistress to the side.
Finally separating at last, Draco and Harry both looked at their surrounding onlookers, a red blush tinting their cheeks.
Continuing to look at Harry, Harry who was filled with goodness and strength, was not an option. Draco needed to get away from everything, and that included Harry, too.
terrible. He was probably just wandering the halls, confused out of his mind as to why the entire castle was empty, and why his roommates and House-mates were all dead asleep. It was around one in the afternoon, and even though it was a Sunday and classes wouldn’t be going on, a whole House wouldn’t just be sleeping in the middle of the day.
“I keep on thinking I’m going to wake up any moment now, and It’ll all be a dream,” Draco mumbled. “A really, really good dream.”
They’d been out shopping all day and now it was about eight o’clock pm. Draco was exhausted and did not want to return home to a party-filled-house. He wanted to blow out the candle on the little cupcake his mother had bought him, eat it, and fall asleep.
They now had eleven days until the two weeks were up, and Draco could tell Potter was getting extremely restless and irritated that nothing had gone right so far. But that seemed to motivate Potter to work extra hard on spell casting. Draco admired Potter’s work ethic, and decided to marvel at it from afar, reading a book on dragons. Because really, he and Potter both knew Draco was absolutely no help since he couldn’t actually cast the spell alongside Potter. Throwing out random suggestions could only go so far.
“It just popped up in my mind. You gave me back my wand, so I was just curious.” Draco waved his free hand around while he spoke. “Which reminds me, did you get your map back, too?”
“Right.” Potter leaned over the blank page. “Book, please reveal to us a spell that will break magical wards.”
He hastily locked the bathroom and yanked up his sleeve, and not to his surprise, the skull and snake was jutting profusely out of his arm and moving angrily.
“Holy shit,” Potter said under his breath.
He took a couple deep breaths and nodded at Potter. Potter removed his hand.
His face visibly tightened. “Betrayed. Utterly, fucking, betrayed. Though I did have a lot of time to grieve the past weeks while you were in the hospital.”
“I know, but I can’t really fall asleep. I doubt you can either.”
“My mother, Lily, sacrificed her life to save me,” Harry whispered, “and because of her sacrifice, when Voldemort cast the Killing Curse on me, it backfired, and left me unharmed except for my scar.” Harry’s eyes went up as if he was trying to look at the lightning bolt scar on his forehead.
Surprisingly, he didn’t see the back of his eyelids, but he did feel the whirring darkness all around him, and Dry’s shouts of surprise and anger.
Alec rolled his eyes. “I’ll finish the story, if you don’t mind.”
The next thing he knew, he saw his mum and dad. His mum was holding him tight inside a room at the Manor. In his gut, he felt the uneasiness of stepping foot inside his house once again, but he also felt happy. It was a real, genuine happiness that he hadn’t felt while hugging his mother, for the longest time.
talking to Elizabeth one on one might benefit him.
owl,” He said, and bit back on a bout of laughter he felt coming as he heard the words that had come out of his mouth.
Draco nodded solemnly, he’d guessed Harry wouldn’t have been able to run given the state he was currently in, but it was worth a try suggesting it. “Okay, just- just be careful. Don’t do anything too rash.”
He put his ear to the door, hoping he would maybe hear someone.
“Are you alright, Draco?” Blaise asked from across the table.
Draco watched as it flew outside the range of the ward encasing Hogwarts. The spell had worked.
“I- we- we thought you were
“Hmmm, what even
“I just care about my education, Potter. Nothing wrong with that.”
He might be wrong, he could totally be misinterpreting Potter’s expressions, but something in the back of his mind told him he was right, that Potter was suffering.
An Auror who Draco had never seen before started walking towards Draco, joining Pomfrey on the left side of the bed. Pomfrey gave the man a stern look while Draco calmed his breathing.
Potter smiled at him. Like it was the simplest thing in the world.
Draco found he just wanted to go home. He couldn’t let Harry see him cry.
Draco reluctantly took out his wand, not wanting to see what time it was, but cast a
The look Potter gave him when Draco said he’d do it, made him realize he’d made the right choice. Seeing Potter full of glee again made his insides all fuzzy, for reasons he didn’t care to think about.
We had a fake, placed by Alec. Though, in an attempt to make the fake as similar to the real one, some of the spells worked. That’s how I got the letter past the barriers and to my father.”
After about two minutes of collecting his breath and telling himself that he would be just fine, he knocked.
-” Potter gestured vaguely at the space between him and Draco- “friends. I helped you escape from a broom closet yesterday and now apparently everyone and their mum thinks we’re best mates. Not including yesterday, we haven’t even talked to each other since your trial this summer!”
That dream would never be fulfilled, since today he was forced, by Pansy, to go shopping with his mother. It wasn’t horrible having to spend time with Narcissa, it was just they always went shopping together. He wanted to do something different, with someone different.
... I hoped you enjoyed this chapter :) I'm actually really proud of this chapter, it's probably my favorite yet, even if did take me almost a month to write it.
“No, the Harry constellation.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Of course I mean the Draco constellation. It’s right there next to Ursa Minor.” Draco pointed at the sky, tracing his constellation with the tip of his finger, his back numbing and the heating charm wearing off.
“I have nobody. Nobody cares about me,” He whispered into the side of his hand.
“Whatever.”
Pansy picked up the copy of the
He was engulfed in darkness once again, and then he was standing at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, facing the real life Drys.
Before Draco even knew what he was doing, he rushed over to Potter and swatted his hand away. Potter looked startled, and his green eyes were huge, staring right into Draco’s grey ones. “Don’t touch them, Potter. Leave them be. They’re rare flowers.”
called him Harry, and he knew he now mirrored Potter’s bashful composure as the realization struck. “No,” Draco said.
For what seemed like the hundredth time that week, he and Potter were back to sitting at their usual table in their usual seats, with Snape’s book out and open between them, on a blank page.
Olive dead. Alec and Drys traumatized. Draco, a Death Eater who had attended that raid, and in the end, had burned down the Kaspian’s home.
“I’m perfectly fine, let’s do this.” Draco walked over to the edge of where the slide started, and sat down, willing the slide not to move. Harry followed his lead and sat down next to him. The slide was surely wide enough for the both of them.
Potter blinked. “What?”
Oddly enough, no one seemed to bother him as he bent down over the trunk at the foot of his bed and carefully placed all of his objects Harry had handed to him in there while grabbing some school books. After he was finished, he recast plenty of concealing and locking charms on the trunk to keep anyone else out.
He was too focused on the fact that he might be going to Azkaban. Sure, they would learn all about Drys’ evil plan and how Draco was trying to stop what Drys had been planning, but in the end, just like the Aurors had told him, he had killed someone. He had killed Drys. He was officially a murderer.
Draco knew he really shouldn’t say anything, but he wanted to know Potter’s answer.
at a quill on the nearest table, and a pile of ash appeared in the quill’s place.
He dropped his arm and straightened his posture, turning back around to see that Potter was now standing up.
written at the top. It was written in his handwriting, for sure, which made Draco even more confused. He couldn’t even remember the last time a written assignment was assigned for Potions. Well, there was work they had to do outside of class, but the parchment that he was currently observing had a very official sort of look to it.
I recently created an instagram account: @mlfoyskhione, where I'll be posting book reviews, drarry fanfic recs, and text posts about Harry Potter, The Shadowhunter Chronicles, and Carry On. Please go and check it out and say hi to me over there! I'll also update on it when I'll be posting new chapters of this fanfic
He briskly threw off his pyjamas, and changed into his new dress shirt and robes. He stuffed his wand into his trouser pocket, and left the Infirmary to go and get McGonagall or the first professor he ran into.
“Huh,” Is all Potter said as they both stared dumbly at the still sparkling ward.
“Well, after I had Snape’s book, and created all of the spells I needed with help from his book, I had
“I’m-” Draco was starting to get aggravated. The room was starting to fill with hot air. Everything was spinning and there was nothing he could do to stop it. He closed his eyes, willing himself to calm down.
The atmosphere of the school made his own atmosphere light and approachable--most of the time--but the inside of him was boiling. All the attention did take its toll on him, and sometimes Pansy would find him isolated in the restrooms. It didn’t help that because all of this attention was related to the Sleeping Curse and Drys, he constantly thought about how he was a murderer.
At first he felt disgusted with himself. He wanted to cover himself up and not let anyone see him the way he was. But he also felt content. Somehow, someway, deep down inside of him, he felt
“Uh. Give me a minute.” Draco bit down on his lip and thought long and hard on what he wanted to reveal. Talking about his Mark was obviously out of the picture. Talking about how he felt sort of the same way Potter felt about living through a war wasn’t going to happen either, mostly because he thought the book wouldn’t accept the same answer twice, but also because he didn’t want Potter to know he felt similar. Not yet at least.
Theo never got to tell Draco what that ‘something’ was.
It reminded him of the time during the Sleeping Curse. It was extremely odd--he longed for that kind of peace again, the peace that was brought by only two people living inside a giant castle, no one else around except for the one person he loved more than anyone. This thought also sickened him, because why would he be fantasizing about a time where he was literally manipulated and made oh-so-many wrong decisions?
Draco caught up with Potter, and he realized he was still slightly out of breath. He tried to breathe normally, but that somehow made everything worse. He stumbled a little and then doubled over, knees hitting the ground, one hand clutching the grass under the snow and the other clutching his chest.
Draco fled the Potions room, continuing his search for Harry, casting
“To answer your question, about Ron and Hermione, they’re okay. Ron is still shaken up about Fred’s death and all, but he’s doing a lot better than he was this summer. Hermione has a lot of nightmares and she rarely ever sleeps, but she’s also doing better.”
“Pansy, it’s now or never. I really don’t want to, but I sort of have to.”
Draco was stuck on the fact that out of everything that just conversed between Potter and Kaspian, Potter was apparently thinking about how Kaspian said he and Potter were, ‘pretty close nowadays.’ Draco didn’t respond back with anything related to what Potter had just said. Now was probably the only chance he would get to ask the question he always wanted to ask.
“Pardon?” Potter turned to face Draco directly. His face was lit up by his wand, and Draco could see that his nose and cheeks had started to turn pink, and he was shivering. Draco guessed he looked the same to Potter.
He wished that he was in possession of Snape’s actual book, so that he could ask for a spell that would allow him to find people.
He then slowly turned away from the mirror, and started to take off his robes and shirt. He tried his hardest not to look at his left forearm, but it was like his eyes were automatically drawn to it. The Dark Mark was still distinctly apparent on his arm. It had faded slightly, but it was still there.
. I tried every opening spell I could think of and none worked. I guess somehow someone put a spell on the room to ensure that the person trapped inside couldn’t use magic to get out.”
After the large group of Death Eaters had Apparated away, Draco had been about to join them, when Rookwood said they had to burn the house down, leaving no evidence behind. It was to look like a simple house fire, killing the residents with no trace of dark magic.
“Alright everyone, I hope you have a fantastic week! See you next Friday, same time, same place,” Elizabeth announced at the end of their hour.
. He was often referred to as the “Last Death Eater” which really didn’t help with the thoughts. He felt alone in that way, in a twisted, sickening manner.
slicing Harry’s skin. Although, Harry dying
desperate.
Potter shoved his hands in his pockets and made a noise Draco could only associate with deep thinking. “Do you think he was trying to say we have thirteen days to save everyone from the sleeping curse?”
“Yeah, I remember. Hermione was the one who brought you in.”
Then he was alone. Standing in the middle of his party, probably looking like a complete loser. He could go find Pansy or Blaise and Greg again, but he found he didn’t have the energy to hold a conversation with anyone. Except Harry.
The walk to the Headmistress’s office was not far and as he reached the gargoyle, he spoke the password- which was still crumpets- and stomped up the stairs, throwing the door open and revealing himself to a startled looking Dumbledore and Snape.
“Why do you still hang out with him? I notice that you don’t enjoy his company nearly as much as he enjoys yours.”
Well, it had been a long time ago. Precisely four weeks.
“You can’t just hibernate in the castle for the rest of your life, Draco,” Pansy said, clinging to Blaise’s arm. “We’ll be graduating soon. And then what? You need social interaction.”
“Let me try,” Potter said as he stepped up to the gargoyle. “Crumpets.”
Also, he didn’t think he
Harry sighed, and then sat down next to Draco, facing the brutal wind and snow. “I had to find you, of course. Though, it was a bit hard to do since I didn’t have my map to track you down.”
They knew their friends were waiting for the two of them outside near the lake, so they hastily left the library, for what might be the last time, Draco clearing his head and trying to focus on the comfort walking right next to him.
Gathering up any leftover courage, he made his way slowly to his dorm. Once standing outside the door, he could hear the muffled voices of his dormmates, and Draco had to control his breathing for a couple of seconds. He knew Theo would have a shit ton to say, like always. It was also going to be
He scrubbed his cold hands across his face. He’d been so fucking stupid the past two weeks. He’d had so many opportunities to seek help, and he blew them all. His time was up. Tomorrow was Sunday.
important that he had to focus his full attention on it. If someone was trying to reach him to send some sort of message, they should’ve known he was the worst representative to choose. They quite literally could have chosen anyone else in the Wizarding World. That was on them if someone was hurt or dying, they definitely should’ve known better.
Harry shouted, “
“The stars are bright tonight,” Draco said, looking up at the sky.
Draco started to close his own eyes as his heart started to beat in an inhuman rhythm. Salazar, Harry’s breath on his lips did something to his insides. He needed to fill the minuscule gap between them
“I know. I see it every time in the mirror. I’ve honestly gotten used to it by now.”
he would try to tell himself. Or,
He sipped on his tea and shook his head at Pansy, hoping she would drop the subject.
“So, we’ve checked every place now. I think it’s safe to say we are the only ones awake.” Potter said as the two of them started walking back towards the entrance of Hogsmeade.
“Are you even hearing yourself speak right now? That doesn’t make any sense. I didn’t even know we were going to be working in pairs today.”
rather than mope around in their makeshift bedroom. He didn’t know what that something would be, but he’d find it out.
They sat like that, leaning against each other, hands together, for what seemed like hours.
Potter apparently cared that he was being abandoned, though. “We aren’t supposed to split up, remember?” Potter said as Draco pushed aside a pile of snow from the bench, sitting down and scrunching up his nose at the agonizing feeling of water seeping through his pants. Honestly, he didn’t know why he had avoided sitting in the snow when sitting on a wet bench was basically the same exact thing.
Draco was delighted to know for a fact, it was so far from fake.
Eventually, Robins rushed over to Theo and helped his friend into a sitting position, while the rest of them were still trying to process everything.
“I do have to ask you, though, Mr. Malfoy, the cut on your arm, did you cause that yourself?”
from the movement.
“Wow. Draco Malfoy being selfless. Maybe I am imagining things.”
“Draco, may I remind you I was a teenager when creating that book. Yes, I was talented at creating spells and what not, but I did not know all the secrets of the universe. I still do not. And I’m sure you don’t need more than three spells.”
In truth, Draco had been scared. However, he’d learned over the past however many days that being scared and accepting it was okay- human even. He didn't know the exact reason why he’d always been scared of his mother since the war, but deep down that feeling had always been there. And it was less that Draco was scared
Everyday since Draco had been staying in the Hospital Wing, she’d had to do the same thing to his forearm. Apparently, the Dark Mark was constantly bleeding and burning up; not that Draco could feel it. Well, it stung, but it was nothing compared to the pain the Mark had produced under the rule of the Dark Lord and then Drys.
Draco sighed to himself, and got off the floor.
“Alright, let’s see if it worked,” Potter said as their eyes traveled down to the pages of the book. “Book, please reveal to us some sort of counter-curse that will safely return people who are in a cursed state, back to their normal non-cursed selves.”
“It’s nothing that would concern you, I promise.”
“But something was missing.”
He blinked away the tears that were starting to form in his eyes, and pulled back down his sleeve. He was not going to spend the next however many days wallowing in self-pity over his moving Mark with Potter present. He would ignore the burning as much as he could, and not let Potter see his pain. He wouldn’t look at it at all, because that just brought horrible thoughts about harming himself back to the front of his mind, and he wasn’t going down that dark road again.
In all honesty, Draco had stopped thinking about life
“What do you think, Potter? I was trapped. That’s why I yelled, ‘Help! I'm stuck in this broom closet!’ Do you ever think before you speak?”
Pomfrey’s office door was shut, and so was the door leading to her bedroom. She was probably sitting in either one at the moment, because where else would she be? Draco could probably call for her to bring him a light breakfast, but he knew that was extremely rude. So, he continued to sit in his bed, and thought about Quidditch and different types of defensive spells he would definitely use once his probation was up.
Madame Pomfrey’s expression turned from stern to troubled as she noticed how upset Draco had become from her question, and she conjured a glass of water with her wand. He kindly accepted it from her and took a sip, then carefully set it down on the small side table next to the bed.
“What about Goyle? Do you two still talk?”
The next thing Draco knew, a slow hum of a song was starting to play out of the radio. As the song started to progress, Draco noticed that it was quite different from songs made in the Wizarding World, but he also noticed he was enjoying the song. His foot was tapping along to the beat, and he scowled at his foot for betraying him. Harry caught Draco’s scowl, and smiled, while starting to dance on his own.
Draco shrugged, for the lack of anything else to say to Potter.
Draco had been in the library for hours, searching through every shelf and pulling out books that looked important. He was determined to be the one to solve whatever curse or spell had made all of Hogwarts take what appeared to be a very long nap. He was going to find the answer before Potter. Books were a very reliable source, he was sure at least one of them held the answer.
As the two of them pulled apart, Draco spoke. “Mother, there’s something I wanted to tell you.”
It was like Déjà vu. His mother’s warm arms wrapped around him, her grip strong and firm, but the gesture full of so much emotion. This exact hug had been repeated so many times today and throughout the past week; but it never got old. The only difference this time was that the hug was filled with indescribable, pure happiness--no ounce of sadness or grief to be found.
Harry started to take a couple steps towards Draco, but Draco backed away. He wasn’t done telling Harry everything he needed to say, yet. Certainly, when the full truth came out, Harry would stop looking at him with caring eyes.
“Uh, no. This is addressed to me, not you.”
Harry never jumped up and yelled anything.
He remembered that day fairly well. He’d been angry that Harry of all people had rescued him; had been the one to see him in such a humiliating situation. Then, Harry had covered for him when they had arrived late to Transfigurations, telling the teacher outwardly that Draco had been trapped in a fucking closet. That had only made Draco more angry, because why the fuck did Harry have to go and tell the whole class about his unfortunate predicament?
“You know, I would love to reminisce in our past, Harry, but not right now while I’m in pain and my nose is bleeding.”
“You look severely shaken up. What happened? Who do I have to kill?” She sounded like she wasn’t kidding.
There were times during the Curse when he thought he had a chance with Harry. It was easy to believe anything during that time, though. The Curse had thoroughly fucked with his brain, that was all.
Yes, he bloody well was still injured, and his chest was throbbing painfully from all the walking around.
“Congrats on being a hero, by the way,” Harry spoke. The words sounded mocking, but Draco knew Harry was being sincere.
The noise he heard the first time, the small noise that had obviously came from the dungeon, came again. It really did sound like another person was with him.
“That’s perfectly human.”
To make matters more complicated, the person he had feelings
He wouldn’t change a thing about their past.
All in all, an eventful day.
Harry laughed and pocketed the photo. “Muggle photos don’t move. The spell I cast basically replicated whatever Muggles do to get a still picture.”
He nodded to himself in approval, and sealed the letter in an envelope using a quick
They both headed inside the Room of Requirement, not looking at each other, the air tense and heavy between them.
”The Death Eaters do whatever I tell them to do, and after I’m finished with you and Potter, we’ll infiltrate Hogwarts and kill all of the Purebloods. So simple. So easy and quick.
Pansy took a huge breath, opening her mouth to speak, when she was interrupted by the sounds of people coming into the room. She finally stepped aside, and Draco had a clear vision of everyone who had just entered.
He’d always wanted to clue Harry in on the reality of being an Auror, for the sole purpose of ruining the Savior’s dreams. But now, the only reason he would even think about cluing Harry in on reality, was to save him from being condemned to a horrible profession for the rest of his life.
Draco was about to get up and grab his ingredients when the door to the room slammed open, revealing Potter. Draco was surprised he hadn’t noticed Potter's absence sooner.
“You know how dreams have meanings?” She stated. “What you experienced was a sort-of-dream. Your mind created those visions when you were directly faced with death, and the images you saw had utmost importance to you. For example, it’s pretty clear that hugging your loved ones holds the meaning that anyone would guess: you love them and wanted to embrace that before you ‘died’. The mirror is a bit more tricky. It holds self reflection, beauty, ugliness, so on and so forth. It stands for a lot of different things. You just have to work out for yourself what it meant in your situation.”
“See!” Harry said, shoving the book into Draco’s hands and almost knocking his wand onto the floor.
He took a deep breath. “Headmistress. I need to say something to you. Something I should’ve said a long time ago. And, that is, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for being a terrible student in my youth, and causing so much trouble and being so bloody prejudiced. I’m sorry that I didn’t fight on your side during the battle. I’m sorry, and I know it means nothing, but I truly am.”
Draco sighed again, clenching his stomach, and taking the steps slowly.
“I would believe so. Let’s try it,” Draco said. “And remember, word the question carefully.”
He rested his hand on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry looked at him with concerned eyes. Concerned eyes for
“Is being famous always so… exhausting?”
The Nott’s certainly both had a motive to make Draco’s life hell. Theo was angry that Draco hadn’t gone to Azkaban, when his father had. He thought Draco deserved it more than Theo’s father. Draco always thought Theo was right.
Pansy ran over to Draco’s bedside, and immediately leaned down to give him a hug, pushing McGonagall out of the way like she wasn’t even standing there. Draco almost laughed. It was sort of an awkward hug, since he was lying down, but it made him happy. He rarely ever got hugs.
. That never left. Theo hated Draco too. At least the feeling was mutual.
He laid there that night for a long time, trying to fall asleep, but sleep never came.
Potter opened the book to one of its many blank pages and placed it in between them.
He tried not to think about the dream and Mark, but it seemed like those were the only two things he could think about. He really needed something to occupy his mind.
“I’m sure there’s someone else who still needs a partner,” Slughorn sympathized.
curse had left. It was marred with criss-crossing pink scars, that would always be there, just like the Dark Mark. These scars made him absolutely hate his own body.
The seats gradually filled in, and Draco got stuck sitting next to a girl named Caitlin who was in Hufflepuff, and was extremely perky. He scooted closer to Pansy.
him to wake her.
Madame Pomfrey hastily stepped out of her office at the sound of the door opening, and her expression showed that she was most certainly not happy to see visitors at this hour.
Slughorn’s voice drifted through his head saying,
Draco sputtered, and thought long and hard about what he had said to Potter while he was in the middle of yelling at the bloke. He realized he
“I promise I’ll keep whatever dirty little secret that comes out of your mouth to myself.”
His thoughts were basically the same as when he’d deduced he fancied Harry: Harry’s the savior of the Wizarding World. Harry had been his sworn enemy for years. Harry could never forgive him. How could Draco constantly look into Harry’s eyes, eyes that reflected back to him all the mistakes he’d made? So yeah, all the same, except on a larger scale.
Harry laughed slightly. “We could go on and on with this all day.” He paused. “Your nose is bleeding.”
“Okay, I’ll tell you just because you asked so politely,” Draco deadpanned, which made Harry laugh, which made Draco smile. Damned chain reactions. “I heard about eighth year the day of my trial. My first thought was that it would be way better than just sitting at home doing nothing but sulk. My second thought was that I would never be able to get a job at all without my NEWTs. My third thought was that I absolutely despised the manor and didn’t want to stay in it any longer.”
On the ground, curled up in a limp form, was Harry.
Something must have shifted on his face, indicating he was about to perform some sort of spell, because at that moment Smith and Theo simultaneously shouted
His own protective ward went up, and he saw Drys smirk before he casted a spell that immediately bounced off his personal ward.
Draco had left with it clutched in his hand, and it was still clutched in his hand to that moment. So Harry really wouldn’t be able to find Draco. It was an upsetting thought. He oddly wanted Harry’s company, even if he did run away in the first place to get away from Harry.
Draco almost laughed as he kept looking at the Figure. Sure, he looked intimidating, but he was nothing even comparable to the Dark Lord. Not even close.
Together, together, together.
“Did I do something wrong?”
The Figure laughed. “I’m telling the truth, boy.
“Your blood, Draco, also allowed me to contact you in your sleep. I had originally planned on telling you my offer on day one, but contacting you proved to be difficult. It hadn’t fully worked until about a week in, unfortunately.” Drys cocked his head to the side. “Maybe if you had had the full two weeks, you’d have made the correct decision. Not that that matters any more.”
. His arm was numb, so he couldn’t really feel the cut that was left there, but the blurry sight of all the blood and the Mark on full display made him want to vomit.
Draco focused back on Harry as he heard his name. “Hm?”
“Shut UP!” Draco finally snapped, and for a second he was sure he was about to pull the sink right out of the ground. “Stop being incredibly nosey and mind your own business for once, Potter!”
“Potter, I think I’m going to go find a new book to read or whatever. Keep casting,” Draco said as he got up from his seat and headed to a section hidden from Potter’s view.
“Well, I could tell you're stressed-” Harry ignored Draco’s noises of protests- “And I wanted to do something nice for you. So, I packed a basket full of snacks and a large blanket; we’re going to have a picnic in the Garden of Mystics.”
“Really?”
As the night slowly moved on, Draco’s worries started to crawl back. He started analyzing the night they had shared, and started stressing over the thought that, yes, he and Harry were friends for now, but what would happen after the curse was broken? If he and Harry randomly became mates, strutting around Hogwarts together, people would think Harry was under the Imperius curse or something else horrible. Not to mention Harry’s reputation if he was seen hanging around Draco. Draco couldn’t be the reason Harry’s life was ruined, now that it was starting to finally piece itself back together.
Draco’s fingers brushed over a book with an extremely bumpy spine, and he was instantly enthralled, pulling out the book to see if it was something worth reading to pass the time and get his mind off the offer.
No, he wouldn’t use up the last question they had, that would have been way too evil even for him. He and Potter were saving the last question for anything extremely terrible that came up. They’d decided not to try another question regarding a new counter-spell for the ward, one that was possibly more powerful. They weren’t positive such a spell existed, and they wouldn’t chance giving up their last question to find out. It was agreed upon that they would first wake everyone up in Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, and then figure out their ward problem.
Harry seemed not too keen on talking about that morning either, so he just responded with a
Slughorn was droning on and on about the potion they were going to be creating today. It was called the Bloodroot Potion, and was apparently very poisonous. Draco didn’t know why they were brewing something so dangerous, let alone brewing it for their NEWTs.
“The heating charm you cast is
Nothing could have been more perfect than in that moment.
“What the fuck?”
He had been in a holding cell, in Azkaban for most of the summer. It had probably been one of the worst experiences of his life, and that said a lot. It was dark, cold, windy, and terrifying there. Although, the dementors no longer guarded the place, which was one upside. Azkaban had felt like one long, endless night. His father had been in the cell next to him, and they had never spoken once to each other. His mother had been stuck at the manor, under the observant eye of the Aurors. Only Marked Death Eater’s had been placed in holding cells, awaiting their trials. Draco’s trial, along with Lucius and Narcissa’s had been around the middle of August, all on the same day. First came Lucius’, who got sentenced to eight years in Azkaban. Draco had expected that outcome, he hadn’t been surprised in the slightest, and yet the sight of his father being pulled out of the room by the Aurors, face set in an unreadable expression, and his mother silently crying, made him almost start weeping. He didn’t, though.
Drys went on: “So after I was set free, I knew that I would have a chance to use my gift for the greater good of the people in the Wizarding World, and even the Muggle world. I set out looking for all kinds of books- anything that would help me accomplish my end goal.”
“Well, I couldn’t have just let you wander the castle alone, especially when I knew something was upsetting you.”
Fridays, huh?
Draco was about to comply and tell Potter that yes, he was ready to make the walk back to Hogwarts, when Potter gasped and turned his head sharply to the side, an expression on his face that said, ‘I just saw a fucking ghost.’ (And not the Hogwarts kind).
Then they took a break, a break which Draco had suggested since he noticed Potter had been getting uncomfortably angry. They took an hour long walk to where the ward met the ground, just to check that the ward was still up. Once again, Potter threw a rock at the ward, and it disintegrated. They had both sighed and glanced miserably at each other before making the walk back to the library.
"May I have this dance?"
As Drys walked away, Draco felt like he was waking up or coming out of one of his visions. Things became
Harry stiffened, and Draco had to take a deep breath. “No, I didn’t even have to think about it. I would never
“Mr. Malfoy,” the Auror said, “you are under arrest until further notice.”
charm around them.
Pansy leapt up from the chair she was sitting at and was about to start hexing the man, or maybe even start a fight without wands. Narcissa pulled her back, but she was clearly thinking the same thing as Pansy. Madame Pomfrey was the one to start yelling at the Auror, saying things like, “We already talked about this!” and “NO.” The side of her that was all affection and protectiveness for her own students clearly breaking through.
Draco spotted a bench when the two of them entered the village, and strode over to it, not caring that he was leaving Potter standing in the entrance.
“Wait it looks like there's something over there. Do you see that shimmer of light?” Draco asked as he walked over to the explosion. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Potter following him.
“I think I’m smart enough to realize when someone has entered my mind, Potter. Thank you.” Even though he hadn’t been and still wasn’t completely sure if it was a message or a dream. He really was good at identifying Legilimency, but this time it was much more trickier to figure it out.
to say to Potter was something along the lines of, “Why were you ignoring me all afternoon? Had I done something to offend you? Please don’t go back to not speaking to me, it’s incredibly lonely as it is.” Instead he just turned on his other side, facing away from Potter, and pulled his blankets tighter around himself.
It was all a breath of much needed fresh air.
Potter looked up at Draco and contemplated his answer. “I’m not sure what to think. I would hope it was just an honest mistake made by a kid, but what if it’s not? We don’t know anything about what’s happened, besides the fact that we’re pretty sure they’re sleeping and not dead.”
His eyes immediately fell on two large portraits hanging high above the chair that McGonagall would surely have been sitting in if she were awake. He immediately locked eyes with Severus Snape, forcing himself not to look at the portrait next to Snape's that contained Albus Dumbledore, who was surely gazing down at him with contempt.
Then, Harry looked up at Draco, caught him staring, open-mouthed and vulnerable. Harry smiled at him, and only him, from across the Great Hall; he was pulled from wherever universe his mind took him to.
He’d gotten a new scar, too. Where the killing curse had hit him. Right over his heart. A lightning bolt just like Harry’s.
Draco shifted so that he wasn’t lying flat on his back while he craned his head awkwardly to meet Harry’s. He laid on his side and let his palm find the back of Harry’s neck, and held him there like he was delicate glass, letting his fingers touch the soft hairs curling there.
“Thank you, Potter,” Draco said as his cheeks started to feel a bit too warm for his liking.
Draco immediately perked up at the loud
this book?” Harry asked.
Somehow it always led back to the war with the two of them. It was like they were destined to talk about what had transpired over the last two years with each other. But Draco was not going to talk about the war with Potter.
He felt like the two of them had now claimed the word ‘together,’ and he most certainly didn’t mind.
Once back inside the library, Potter started back up his practice with defensive spells. He had not wanted to try and learn the Deletrius charm, but Draco convinced him he should practice casting it a little while longer, since he had already worked on it for a good amount of time.
“So…” Harry started. “Is he- you know-”
He kept feeling around for his wand on the floor, but couldn’t seem to find it. He planned on healing a lot of the injuries himself, he probably could do it, he’d always been really talented at healing spells, but he couldn’t heal anything if he didn’t find his wand, and fast.
McGonagall smiled back. “You are more than welcome here at Hogwarts.”
It was a simple spell, like Draco had said before; it was in a children’s book. However, that fact didn’t make the prospect of casting a spell in front of Harry any less terrifying. He was afraid he’d slip up, and make a fool of himself. It wasn’t exactly likely that scenario would happen- he was a very talented wizard. But the feeling in his stomach he’d felt earlier when Harry was on top of him, resurfaced, along with some self-doubt, and he couldn’t figure out where it was coming from.
There were two people sitting on the sofa near a contraption that flashed moving pictures and contained people talking. The two people, man and women, about maybe thirty, were leaning against each other, under a blanket. The moment felt so intimate, Draco had to look away. He stared at the giant windows letting in the night sky instead.
Potter was standing beside Draco’s bed. His hair was wet and a few drops of water clung to his eyebrows. He definitely just got out of the shower. He was wearing Muggle jeans and a plain red t-shirt. He was also wearing some sort of necklace, however Draco couldn’t see exactly what was on the end of the necklace, since the chain was under his shirt.
Harry was. “If you truly believe that we’re blessed with luck, why are we in this situation in the first place, hmm?”
at him. Ropes automatically began tying themselves around Draco’s body, and he winced in pain and the ropes cut into his skin, even through his clothes. However, he stood strong against the wall of the classroom. He wasn’t going to fall. He could handle this. He had been through far, far worse at the hands of the Dark Lord.
“No problem, I guess. I was the one who suggested it in the first place. You didn’t have to go along with it.”
“That sounds good, yeah.” He still rubbed his elbow in irritation.
, if that special ‘connection’ I’ve always had with Harry wasn’t strong enough, it would surely be strong enough after spending two weeks with him. That would go for Alec too, right?”
It seemed like a lot of time had passed, and Draco knew Pomfrey definitely should have come out of one of her rooms by now. She was always so organized and her eyes were on the clock constantly. Had she overslept? Was she running some kind of errand? He was certain Pomfrey would never do the first, and if she had left her seclusion in the Hospital Wing, she undoubtedly would have told Draco and got someone else to watch over him.
“So you trusted me more than your own son?”
And he didn’t even recognize the girl, nor her friends.
The next difference was that Potter hadn’t had to wake Draco up from a nightmare-induced-fit, since Draco had had no such visions when he slept.
Once they arrived at Slughorn’s classroom for the night, and they both took their usual positions- Draco stirring intently and Harry sitting on a table- Draco noticed the atmosphere seemed off. That was, the atmosphere between him and Harry.
Harry walked closer to Draco, peering down at him with his glasses off. He’d always wanted to see Harry with his glasses off. During the day, that was. He’d obviously seen them off while Harry had been sleeping, but the light of day was a completely different story. However, sadly, Draco could hardly see- everything was blurry.
It was a little past five o’clock when Harry Potter came barging into the library. He was dressed in a really thick coat, and had discarded his Hogwarts robes. There was a Gryffindor scarf draped around his neck, along with a matching hat covering his messy hair, and gloves already on his hands.
Draco was speechless. His hands began to feel sweaty again, and the room felt extremely hot. How could it be
“Fuck. I’m sorry. I didn’t sleep well last night.” Potter rubbed his palms across his face, lifting up his glasses in the process.
Harry’s face flashed between pure rage and disbelief. “Bastard. Absolute fucking bastard. The whole lot of them. You’ll tell me who else attacked you, right?”
He could now see, and Harry was grinning like an idiot. A mixture of pride, having casted a difficult spell correctly, and pleasure of annoying Draco.
Draco was about to start seeking for a new book on the shelves of the library, and maybe try to break into the restricted section, when Potter spoke once again.
The Auror who had said he was arrested came up behind McGonagall. “Mr. Malfoy, I-” he glanced at McGonagall, and she glared at him. “I would like to ask if you would be willing to be subjected to either Veritaserum, or place your memories in a Pensieve.”
There was a hatch in the ground. An outline of a square shown in the wood, and a shimmery handle was smack in the middle of it.
“I just-” he tried to calm his breathing, and focused on Harry in front of him. It was difficult to do at first, but he knew he had to be in the right space of mind to tell Harry his secrets. “This is just a hard subject for me to talk about,” he admitted.
His head felt better too, and he now had the capability to sit up properly, looking around on the floor next to him for the book he’d dropped.
Subconsciously, Draco reached into his robe pocket, feeling for his wand, but it wasn’t there. What he did feel, though, was the small vial of Bloodroot Potion he still had stashed away, and had yet to return.
Draco was also surprised Potter didn’t bring up any of his own theories of what had really happened to him the night Granger had found him. Granger most certainly would have told Potter what she had seen, though as far as Draco knew, Granger didn’t know he had been attacked. He supposed it was pretty obvious though, unless she thought he had tried to off himself. “Yes, I am. And I know this might shock you, but I thought getting Pomfrey some help was more important than my healing injuries,” He said with as much vigor he could add to his voice.
“Oh for- bloody hell, I’ll just grab it myself.” Draco reached across their workspace and grabbed the knotgrass, along with a couple of lacewing flies.
He then saw Harry’s gaze move to the skin right above Draco’s heart, where a new scar lay. A lightning bolt to perfectly match Harry’s, right where the Killing Curse had struck him.
“No, I just went inside the classroom to find my quill I had left behind, and he was laying on the floor in the back.” The person talking sounded pretty shaken up.
McGonagall had taken it upon herself to check in on him, make sure he wasn’t too overwhelmed with the attention. His response to that had been a lie. In reality, he was both overwhelmed and happy, however that might work.
“Yes.”
They both went back to staring up at the stars. It was a truly beautiful sight. Draco was lucky to have experienced so many wonderful moments with Harry over the past two weeks. He had thought running through the halls was all the fun he’d get to have with no one else around. But then they both danced in the Garden with each other. And now, they were stargazing, and lying in the freezing snow next to each other. He wondered if he would have another memorable experience sometime in the near future. He really, really hoped so.
“Nothing. Just uh- leaving,” Draco tried as he headed towards the bathroom.
They kept on kissing and kissing, stopping to breath every once in a while, but then resuming again. Harry brought Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth and Draco
The next week after he had officially woken up and healed had been an optional stay, but a much needed one at that. Madame Pomfrey was more than happy to have him stay a week or so longer, but she was also quite concerned. Pansy and his mother were, too.
“It’s not going to kill you, young man. Quite the opposite. You will feel much better after you take it. Now drink up.”
Potter, sitting on the other side of the room from where Draco sat at the Slytherin table, looking lost in thought. His messy black hair falling into his eyes. Completely not listening to what Weasley and Granger were saying to him at the moment.
Of course he had been scared. The only other person awake in the castle hadn’t been there when expected. It was a terrible and uneasy feeling thinking that you were left alone because something awful had happened. An even worse feeling when you realize the person hadn’t been taken by some dark force, but willingly chose to leave your side.
Granger didn’t say anything else, she just continued to stand at the foot of the bed, and after a while of awkwardly staring at Draco, she whispered into Potter’s ear something inaudible.
“We’re both hypocrites,” Harry conceded.
He honestly couldn’t wrap his head around the truth that Granger was worried about his well-being. He had called her a mudblood. That was unforgivable. And now here they were, alone in a dark classroom together, acting like nothing had happened between them in their youth.
Roaming the halls and searching for whatever he was searching for, had proved useless and horrible for his mental health. Being left alone with his thoughts never got him anywhere. He realized that when Harry was with him, though, he became distracted and hadn’t felt so alone in the world. Sure, thoughts of anxiety still got to him, he figured even love couldn’t exactly cure trauma, but Harry always said the right thing to him, and made everything a bit clearer.
He had to lift himself out of Harry’s grasp to see what Harry was looking at, and he immediately felt the warmth travel out of him. Though, when he saw what had grabbed Harry’s attention, he smiled, and began to stand up.
“Me too, Potter,” Draco sighed as he came to a stop with stirring. “Me too.”
Harry set the objects down on the ground as he regarded Draco. “What do you mean?”
he had thought. He had hoped his whole,
Draco told the Aurors he would
“Wait, so this means all the other… the other…” Harry trailed off.
The stars never failed to stop twinkling, and the constellations they made never failed to be less mesmerizing. Harry was like the night sky. Twinkly and bright, mesmerizing in every aspect; the good and the bad, his perfections and his imperfections.
His wand was out of reach, and out of sight, and he quickly felt around on the ground beside him, hoping his wand was somewhere close, and dreading what would happen to him if he didn’t have a protection up and around him soon.
The journal was completely battered, the outside torn, filled with stains, and scribbled on in quill. What caught his eye the most was the signature at the bottom; the letters ‘DK’ in cursive, and next to it ‘OB’. Just the two they were looking for.
“No. I’m good,” He blurted out.
Yayy Drarry is finally sort of kind of happening! Though they still have a longgg way to go.
“I think I’m feeling well enough to do it now,” Draco responded, which was the truth. What was also the truth, was that he just wanted to get it over with. He didn’t want to have to sleep again and wake up with dread, knowing he’d have to subject his memories to a Pensieve.
“Get up. We’re going out.”
He gave in, in the end, wrapping his own arms around Harry’s waist. In response, Harry hugged him tighter.
That got him kicked out of the Hospital Wing for good. And that’s when, along with Draco being an alleged killer, they placed Aurors outside and inside the Hospital Wing.
Draco gave a little shrug that he hoped she didn’t pick up on. “It’s all fine. Nothing really to heal, though.”
He felt rough, hard stone at his back and under his hands, and all of a sudden knew he was lying in the pavilion, the place he and Harry had ended up after their snowy rendezvous. The back of his eyelids were suddenly filled with flashes of the previous night: Draco crying, Harry talking, Harry sharing gifts, and their blissful snogging session in the freezing snow.
He’d told himself he was going to be productive. He was going to look out after Hogwarts, defending the school from a hooded figure. And, possibly, if he came across Harry, he would try to apologize to him for the hundredth time.
Harry’s words always hit so close to home, it was almost insufferable to listen too. But it also gave Draco hope. Hope that he could somehow fix all the mistakes he had made in the past weeks. Whatever happened tomorrow, somehow, he could do the right thing for once. Like all things, it was easier to think about in your head than to actually go forth and take action in real life. But if Harry was by his side, he knew he could accomplish anything he set his mind to.
hurting. Potter really was as thick as it got.
Where was ‘here’? Where was he? What exactly had happened to him, and who was talking?
Draco laughed at the memory now. He did deserve to be attacked. Maybe McGonagall disagreed for some reason, but the amount of people who assaulted him clearly showed he was hated and that he deserved every inch of hate.
“No,” Potter said with an embarrassed grin. “Did you call me Harry?”
And he did. He took back the necklace for a minute, moving behind Draco to clasp the necklace around his neck. When he was finished, Draco turned to face Harry, and grinned, feeling blessed to have been given something so personal and meaningful.
“You know, Death Eaters. You’re people.”
Draco thought bitterly,
Draco cleared his throat. “Right.”
Draco was shaking, in fear and anger and whatever other emotions were coursing through him, tangling up his insides and making it hard to breathe. “
Potter walked back and forth three times in front of the wall, and a door appeared. He pushed the door open and stood facing the inside of the room. Draco backed up a little, his breathing intensified. Potter turned to face Draco, and noticed how scared his composure must be. His brows creased and he took a deep breath, which made Draco do the same.
He brought his hand up to the right side of his face, on his cheek, and brushed his hand gently over the scar that was there. It traveled from the center of his cheek, all the way down to the middle of his chest. It was from the
. He had not foreseen the terrible tragedy that he would have to save the no-good-somebodies who were constantly trying to make his life hell. But he had doomed himself to that fate, hadn’t he? He had joined the side of the darkest and evilest of wizards, and that was his punishment.
the lowest point at Hogwarts.
Draco shook his head, and another round of sobs overtook him. “I don’t deserve you.”
He shook his head and focused back on the matter at hand.
He realized, what Harry had been talking about- Draco forgiving himself- basically meant… he had to find sophrosyne. Was Harry his sophrosyne?
Harry handed over the photo where Draco was staring at the placement of the wand out in front of them, while Harry gazed at Draco. He loved both photos, but the first one they took together contained something special, something that made Draco’s stomach do a million flips when he studied the way Harry had been looking at him.
Oh how the mighty have fallen; fallen for love.
Draco’s second thought was how awful it was that he’d never even known of someone with the last name Kaspian ever being kept in the Manor’s dungeons. There had been so many people, and Draco had never been good with names and faces. He was sickened to think about how he had forgotten the names of people who his family had held as captives, thinking that they deserved so much better than that.
He watched as a green flash of light filled the air, and then Harry was gone. A sob ripped through Draco, and he felt like his own skin was being torn off of him. Out of everything he’d experienced with the war, he’d never felt so sick and so lost as he had when he watched Harry’s lifeless body fall.
The Auror went right to the point.
He crept over to the side of her bed, thinking how it was foolish trying to be silent when he was going to wake her up anyway.
You’re kidding right?”
He cocked one of his eyebrows up, indicating he was listening, but continued to look down at the book in front of him.
In the back of his mind, he had a terrible thought that somehow Theo was involved in all of this- working directly with the Figure. It was a bit much even for him, seeing as Theo mostly stuck to childish pranks such as locking someone (Draco) in a closet or beating the living hell out of someone (Draco), but that was exactly what Draco would've found funny only a couple of years ago, and look where childish jokes got him.
Harry paused to mumble almost inaudible words against Draco’s lips. “Happy birthday, Draco.”
Oh. Well that was pretty fucking convenient.
you. I should be apologizing to you.”
“You don’t know what’s going to happen today! A dark wizard really could be coming, and you don’t want to be left alone!” Draco tried to reason with Harry.
Draco opened the door to the classroom, shaking his head. “It’s not that. It’s complicated. I don’t think you’d understand.”
“Yep,” She popped the ‘p’, and dragged him through the crowd, handing him over to Blaise and Greg who were talking to each other in a corner. “Go and mingle,” She said as she unhooked her arm from his and vanished into the mass of people.
“Not really, no.”
Draco thought that much was obvious. Of course they had to be careful, and make sure that they spoke the right words, not making the book confused as to what they were asking it.
Draco would probably die here, in the therapy classroom. He knew his injuries were definitely horrible, due to the fact that he’d never felt this bad of pain before, other than when the Dark Lord cast the Cruciatus curse on him. Also, the incident with Potter in the bathroom in Sixth Year was pretty painful.
Draco took a long look at Harry and let out a humorless laugh. “I’m not exactly confused… it’s just a lot to process. You’re the first to mention all of this stuff, too. No one told me anything regarding Alec or Drys in the Hospital Wing. And Pansy had to catch me up on basically every other aspect earlier today.”
“I know. But I can defend myself.”
He realized that he had just been put under the Imperius curse.
“Possible? Pfft. I have no idea. I was going to ask you that. One out of the millions of questions I have.”
“Do you think
“I’m not

hadn’t come out yet specifically about him and his Pensieve memory. But, that consequently meant it would come out soon. That article would probably determine if he was looked at in the public’s eye as even more of a criminal, or a hero.
Harry was wandering somewhere around Hogwarts, and every minute that passed by, Draco became more worried that Harry was in danger. Danger because of Draco’s poor choices.
The Figure didn’t need to tell Draco twice. He didn’t need to tell Draco when he should arrive, because as soon as his vision became normal again, and he was staring at the set of stairs in front of him, Draco ran throughout the castle, moving as fast as possible, trying to get to the front entrance.
Potter laughed again, and Draco became aware of how much he absolutely adored listening to him laugh.
He headed back over to the area where Harry was located, and sat down at their usual table, opening the book and reading the table of contents, finding a section on simple spells he should be able to cast without breaking any part of his probation.
Pansy was smirking.
“Okay, then,” Draco swallowed. He mustered up all the courage he could find in himself, and stepped onto the spiral staircase.
“I’m just showing my Slytherin spirit, Potter. Nothing wrong with that, is there?”
When he opened the door, the lights had been dimmed in the room, and the fire was put out. There was a Potter sized lump on the bed that was adorned with red sheets and blankets. Draco could see that Potter had left his glasses next to his wand on the small table beside his bed, and Draco briefly wondered what Potter would look like without his glasses covering up his face. Probably even more git-like than usual.
Theo toppled over instantly, falling to ground and clutching the side of his head like his life depended on it. Tears were falling silently down his cheeks and the boy looked to be in serious pain. Although, from what Draco could see, there was no hint of blood.
“Ad astra per aspera,” Harry said suddenly.
Harry.
Yes, Draco still felt sore in many places, but his vision was back to normal and nothing hurt terribly. Running into a wall was much more preferred to Draco than getting almost hexed to death by fellow Eighth Years.
Pansy looked annoyed, but also pitiful.
This was not his first confrontation with people who wanted to cause him pain. Nowhere near it. He had been attacked too many times to keep track of since the beginning of the school year. But, he always came out fine in the end. Well, he came out fine enough for him or Pansy to cast simple healing spells on.
, Draco,” Harry whispered.
Draco winced at the mention of
“It’s like you’ve all of a sudden turned into Potter,” Blaise commented.
“Yes, Potter, that’s what people do: sleep. Brilliant observation.”
to warn Draco not to send another letter.  Also, Draco already explained that overall he’d been too fucking scared, and telling Harry about his Mark was not something he’d wanted to do.
Instinctually, he felt for the rim of his sleeve under his Slytherin robes, and inwardly winced at the fact that
He kept closing and reopening his eyes,
Draco backed away a little, giving Harry the space he so obviously wanted. He could see the hickey on Harry’s neck, and Draco presumed his own neck sported several bruises too.
About three minutes passed, the two Death Eater’s patted Drys down to check for his wand, which they found right away, and Drys screamed for help in heart wrenching volumes.
Harry’s eyelids fluttered. “Draco?” he said, his voice almost not even there.
rather on the cold side, and slipped it on over his black jumper.
wrist. Draco felt a chill travel up his spine, and then he stopped in his tracks, hoping he wasn’t going to look into the eyes of the person he wanted to see least of all right now.
The rain seemed to intensify as the silence between them grew. Harry was starting to lose his tender look, something like hurtful realization replacing his soft eyes. Thunder made a sickening sound in the background.
“Yes, isn’t that why we’re going back to Hogwarts? To get food and shelter?”
They pocketed their respective photos, taking extra care as to not crumple them, and went back to sitting in the snow, watching the stars.
He didn’t stay around long enough to hear Potter’s response, and he had a feeling he hadn’t even been heard, since Potter was so focused on getting the charm correct. It was a good thing that Potter’s center of attention wasn’t on Draco, though. Draco was going to do something utterly horrible.
Drys gave him another withering smile. “Shameful. I really did offer you such a good deal. I gave you a week to think about it, too.” He took out his wand. “Now, come here.”
So, that was his prediction. He guessed he’d never find out the truth now that Drys was… but he found it to be a pretty good guess on his part. The Mark’s reaction to all the strain it had been under had led to it bleeding and stinging, most likely fighting off the remnants of Drys’s control.
His mother was talking to Madame Pomfrey, and the pair of them were surrounded by five Aurors.
Draco joined Harry and laid out the patterned blanket, smoothing out the fabric so that there weren’t any bumps. Harry picked up the food basket and placed it in between the two of them as they sat down, and placed the radish on the closest bench.
“Malfoy-” Potter started, and Draco looked away; he couldn’t focus on Potter’s sympathizing face, it hurt too much. “What if we go in together?”
He was definitely moving at a more bearable pace now, so why hadn’t Harry shown up yet? Harry had his stupid map he could use to track Draco down with, and-
“If I’m being honest with you, no. I did not.”
Draco shifted around to look at Harry, making sure nothing had happened to him yet; nothing had, Draco presumed. Harry was currently wide-eyed and exhausted, silently coughing.
It was like all the world's problems could be solved by two teenage boys laughing and running through a vacant castle.
He avoided death somehow, too, even though he was supposed to die right alongside the other Death Eaters.
Draco was glad that Potter was back to his normal self.
All the Slytherins in the class sat closest to Slughorn's desk, it wasn’t like Draco chose the spot, but he supposed it was better than sitting with any of the other houses. He didn’t have any friends in the class. That meant Pansy wasn’t in NEWT Potions.
Draco made a noncommittal grunt from across Potter as he eyed the pile of books Potter had set out on the table.
“Look,
There was a shuffle of feet, and he thought he heard the door to the classroom open and close.
“Make a decision?” Drys asked, his face deepening with impatience and restlessness.
However, some part of him always thought,
Draco’s answer was complicated. Yes, of course he would tell Potter if he had another vision while he slept. Yes, he would tell Potter if he randomly found some secret room. No, he would not, and would never tell Potter about his Mark. “Yes, Potter. I won’t hold anything back,” Draco lied. To some extent.
She was standing in place, tears falling and her mouth wide open. It was like she was almost afraid to go over to Draco- like he might bite her.
“I said that because Alec didn’t want people knowing about his mum. In reality their family isn’t fine, and his dad is
“Oh, he’ll wake up. He’s fine,” said a voice. A hauntingly familiar voice.
“How do you know?”
Harry could have changed the song easily by using his mysterious song charm, but he didn’t. He stood in front of Draco, and held out his hand. “May I have this dance?”
“Yeah, but that was for all the horrible stuff I have personally done to you, or done indirectly to you, or whatever. Over the past two weeks you’ve apologized to me for things you literally had no control over, which is noble of you, I guess, but still.” Draco shrugged.
” Draco cast as he slightly lifted his palm from the cut. The blood surrounding the cut, but not coming from the cut, disappeared, and so did the blood that had ended up on Draco’s hands. It was a stupid spell to cast, though, since a new wave of blood came pouring out.
“I’ve actually figured out, though, because of you, that if I want people to actually see I’ve changed and don’t support all that Pureblood prejudice shit, I have to
Thinking of both the real Snape and Dumbledore made him wonder what the portraits of them both were up too. Certainly nothing interesting. He chided himself for not remembering they were in the fucking castle with him and Harry, with the option of asking them questions if need be.
So here Draco was, sulking over the fact that he had to go to group therapy today with Kaspian. He also had Potions and D.A.D.A. today with the bloke.
Pansy was going to throw the most grand party London had ever seen. The venue was at the Claridge hotel, which was both exquisitely fancy, and the perfect place to get pissed and dance, all at the same time.
“I just-- I just truly thought it would be better for us to not be friends, to not hang out at all,” he continued. “That decision was selfish on my part. But I will admit it gave me some time to think things over for myself, and to grow with all the new changes happening around me.
Harry saw him coming and his face lit up. Draco’s face mirrored Harry’s and he was about to embrace him in a hug when Hermione blocked his way, shoving a glass of champagne into his hand.
Draco was in a position of so much power. Power, where either way he chose to use it, would end up with people getting hurt.
Draco flipped the book so he could stare at the cover. It did indeed, have no sign of another color other than the dark brown of the leather.
“I had of course heard of Severus Snape during my school days,” Drys said, “and I know he had the same natural fondness for creating spells, but I’d never known he had created a book that held all of the Wizarding World's known secrets! It was certainly better than
“I’m thinking about you too,” Harry murmured.
Harry continued, “I went to Hogwarts looking for something. Anything. Anything that would fill the emptiness inside of me and all around me. I-”
The book he’d pulled out
Potter was taken aback. “I’m not

the one who’s been defeated.”
“Just trying to keep you enlightened of your mistakes.”
“You told me this book would provide me with any spell, potion, or any wizarding knowledge I planned to seek! I trusted it to help Harry and I with solving this
“That’s me,” Drys responded.
The two of them entered the Slytherin common room, Draco leading the way towards his dormitory, only stopping briefly to take a quick look at Pansy, to make sure she was alright. Of course, she was, she hadn’t changed positions since the last time Draco saw her.
“Why aren’t you in class, Potter?”
“Please?”
His stamina and endurance were the best they’ve been since fifth year. This week he’d eaten properly and had multiple walks around and outside of Hogwarts; his body was stronger than ever. Even if his body wasn’t back to full health completely, he was making progress. He only hoped that when this sleeping curse was all over, he’d maintain healthy eating and exercise habits.
Potter didn’t look amused.
really is a sleeping curse?” Potter asked as he slightly lifted his head from his book.
Once she crossed the short distance to reach him, she flung her arms around him, burying her face in the crook of his neck. He was at first extremely startled, having thought that Aurors would be barging in any second to take him away, but then he quickly realized that there really had been no Aurors barging in; it was just Pansy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ll be fine. And if he’s not awake just come back down and we’ll figure something else out,” Potter said calmly. Like he hadn’t just had a bout of unprecedented anger.
“Draco!” Harry definitely spoke. Okay, maybe there
“Okay thanks,” He said vaguely as he walked over to Harry.
The background of the photograph was stunning; the wand had caught the night sky with all the glittering stars. The photo honestly looked fake. If anyone else was around to take a look at the photo, they’d definitely think Draco used some dark magic to get the sky to look so perfect, and to get the Savior to look at the Death Eater that way.
“I will not! I won’t do anything you say until you tell me if you’ve done anything to hurt Harry!” Draco practically screamed.
Everything was, to say the least, different… between him and Harry, after their night spent dancing.
“Ha ha.”
“Sure you do!” Harry danced his way towards Draco, and grabbed his hand, pulling Draco farther away from where their picnic set up was.
Potter in any aspect. He was still a git. He was still annoying and stupid. The fact that Potter got everything he wanted made Draco want to rip his eyeballs out. He was the beloved hero, catching everyone’s attention, making everyone fall in love with him. If Draco had to be honest with himself, he knew he was envious of Potter now, just like he always had been in their youth. That was the life
“Of course, Draco. And let me reiterate that I’m not one hundred percent certain that that is what actually happened. I’m fairly certain, yes, but you can never be so sure.”
“Mhm?” Draco mumbled.
Everyone agreed with Drys that it was time to take a stand against the Purebloods, and Drys didn’t even have to
Draco took a few deep breaths, and closed his eyes once again. “The Mark has been moving since that Saturday I saw you in the Hospital Wing. I don’t know why or how, it just… started randomly. I thought at first the Dark Lord had returned, but you said that wouldn’t be possible, and if there’s anyone I should take advice on
He turned to the mirror in the bathroom, looking at his reflection, and immediately frowning. He really hated looking at himself in the mirror.
Draco instantly suppressed his urge to dramatically roll his eyes. They started every Friday off like this, and it was honestly getting very annoying. Granger volunteered to go first, and she talked about how she was getting farther in her plans for making S.P.E.W. seen and sponsored by the ministry. Her not so great thing from the week was that she got stuck completing her boyfriend's homework every night.
Besides, he did eat. He ate dinner. He also occasionally slipped into the kitchen to grab a snack when he was hungry. He did take care of himself,

He came to his senses and punched Potter in the shoulder. “What the
Draco didn't even really know why he was still having a conversation with Potter. Let alone a civil conversation. He should be running down the corridors, trying to get to class.
It was humiliating. Draco had made sure he would never cry ever again once Harry had seen him weeping in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. But here he was, almost two years later, crying in front of Harry Potter once again.
In Draco’s mind, he had categorized all those moments, those experiences he’d shared with Harry as the best moments of his life. Were they the best moments of his life, because he’d felt complete for the first times of his life? Complete, and whole, with Harry Potter.
Harry was practically lying across the table to reach Draco, and his eyes were mere inches from his own, concern written all across them. His lips sending out soft breaths across his own. Harry’s cheeks a bright pink, probably mirroring his own.
Drys sneered. “You got that right.”
“That sounds okay,” Draco said. “I’ll give it a go.”
“It’s an Anemonlea flower. You remembered,” Draco said. It was so very important to him that Harry had remembered the flower they had seen when coming back from Hogsmeade the first day of the curse. He knew why. Remembering a tiny little detail, that brought back memories of the two of them, meant that Harry hopefully had feelings for him? Or, it wasn’t like that to Harry at all. To him, it could be a flower that looked pretty and different from all the others, with absolutely no meaning to Harry.
Why was he so… worried? About Theo being awake? It wasn’t like Theo had the guts to do anything
Potter had been telling the truth, he’d been absolutely pissed with Draco. He had shouted obscenities at Draco, at the ceiling, at quills, at the books, and literally everything he could find.
Harry made no sense. If they had done that, who knew if the Figure would’ve just killed people anyways, without warning Draco first. He hadn’t
“Did I miss the exam?” he whispered to her. Even though he knew he hadn’t, there were no exam sheets out on the tables, and it wasn’t like he’d been super late after all. But, it seemed like the appropriate thing to ask at the moment.
“What if I challenged you to a duel?” Draco blurted out.
But, even though Draco hated to admit it, he
After a minute or so, Draco knew he was going to become unaware of everything once again, and sometime again everything would repeat itself for the tenth time: swarming thoughts, Voldemort, screaming, comforting voice, noises, cold substance, darkness.
Harry coughed, not in the
Potter had cast
Draco stood back up again, mentally preparing himself for what was about to come. He didn’t even feel like looking down at Harry one last time, but Harry grabbed his hand, forcing Draco to look down into his green eyes.
To his luck, an eagle owl came flying from around a spire and landed on the ledge in front of him. It looked like the owl he had when he was younger, and for a second he allowed himself to reminisce in the good old memories of his youth.

join his side. To accept the pull of the Mark and rule beside him as the Purebloods were no more. Drys, who thought so strongly that the Ministry and Wizarding World would back him up on his evil plan; who would see the good in the death of Purebloods once the ones in Hogwarts were dead.
“NO!” Olive yelled, a fresh wave of tears falling.
Draco asked himself when it had become easier to talk about the war, and his trial, with Harry. Sure, he still felt uncomfortable and had a desire to flee from the conversation, but the way Harry was looking at him made him feel safe. It made him feel like Harry understood everything he said and related to it, even though he didn’t.
Draco wanted to break something. He’d never felt more furious in his entire life. They had wasted a whole entire week brewing the Restorative Potion based off of the instructions out of a
Harry was awkwardly lying half across Draco’s torso, his feet near Draco’s shoulder’s and his head near Draco’s feet.
He witnessed another possibility too; Harry dying, green light making its way through the rain, and Draco stood there watching without a care in the world.
“Fine,” Harry said, tugging Drys’ journal into his bag. He took Draco’s hand in his, and not for the first time, Draco marveled at how they fit together perfectly. “Soon enough, we’ll have our own Garden of Mystics.”
“Um, that isn’t fair. Malfoy has to answer the question just like the rest of us,” Kaspian said, sitting opposite from Draco and looking severely ticked off.
“Good observation skills.”
No it was not. “Uh,” Is all Draco said.
Draco backed away in a hurry as Potter turned around, noticing that Draco had run into him and lingered a second too long.
“You and whoever else is present when you want to open the book must each reveal a secret. The secret must be meaningful, and must be something you would not wish to ever say to anyone. Once everyone says their secrets aloud to the book, the book will provide you with whatever you seek.”
After he finished dry heaving, he sat against the wall, and his eyes moved to stare at his Mark once again. The cut that had been there was now almost completely healed, save for the faintest sight of a scar, that was hardly recognizable due to all the other scars around the same area.
He hoped Harry never left his side, ever again.
goodness, always thinking about others, and constantly wanting to fight; to do the right thing.
“So for the longest time, I kind of thought it had to be related to the sleeping curse, right? Because it was just too much of a coincidence that the Mark, and the curse, and the protective ward happened around the same day. I hadn’t been sure, obviously, and I’m still not one hundred percent sure, but…” Draco pulled out the crumpled letter in his pocket, slightly feeling the edges of the photograph he and Harry took last night.
His fellow students barely acknowledged him as he wove his way through the crowd of standing and sitting bodies. The ones who did, unsurprisingly, stepped far out of his way. He didn’t even try to hide his eye roll.
“You’re crushing me,” Draco reluctantly said.
“Whoops indeed, Harry.” Draco sighed, and strode across the room to pick up Harry’s wand that had now rolled under Slughorn’s desk. Draco placed the vial of the Restorative Potion he had brought over unconsciously, setting it on the desktop, while bending down to grab Harry’s wand. As his knees hit the floor, he realized he could have just
Draco was pretty sure Pansy was down right mad in love with Blaise. Though she would never admit that to Draco. They weren’t in that stage of friendship yet, where they talked about their crushes or feelings.
“Really? I thought you’d be happy your name was in the Hogwarts motto.”
“Draco.” Harry’s voice cut through it all.
Draco felt like Harry was lying. But, he felt comforted by Harry's acclamation. At least for a couple minutes, until he finally fell asleep.
hated him that much, that he didn’t want to give Draco an Outstanding on one exam? He’d never gotten an O on other assignments in that class, now that Draco came to think of it.
“I’m a hero. I’m
Elizabeth then voiced Draco’s thoughts, and for a moment he believed she used Legilimency on him. “I know it’s a silly question. Of course everyone has felt guilt. Especially after the events you all have experienced in the war. I’m here to tell you, it’s okay. It’s normal to feel guilt, like the weight of the world is on your shoulders.”
“Of course. Wouldn’t want you dying on me now, I wouldn’t know how to stir the potion properly without you here,” Harry laughed.
Draco still found it weird that Harry was the one constantly apologizing. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he apologized to Harry, and he, without a doubt, had way more shit he needed to apologize for than the Gryffindor did. Draco wanted to apologize for everything, but he could never find the right moment, or the right words to start the conversation.
Potter went straight to the counter that would have been selling Butterbeer and other alcoholic drinks, under normal circumstances.
He wanted to spill everything to Harry, to talk about his burning Mark and the letter he sent his father, but he couldn’t yet. When everything was figured out, maybe, just maybe, he would. For now he had to make sure their Restorative Potion was perfectly brewed, so he could prove the figure wrong, and wake everyone up. If everyone was awake, the figure would have no leverage over Draco, and everything would be solved.
evil. I woke you up because you really would have been covered in blood if I’d just left you here. Theo and a couple other Eighth Years are coming back any second now. I thought you might have wanted to leave.”
Once they left the room, and it was just Madame Pomfrey and himself, Pomfrey began to unwrap the old bandage wrap, and dab it with some healing salve. Draco never looked at what she did, but he could feel it and guess.
” Draco said again.
“Usually I never pay attention either, but something she said really stuck with me. She said you have to let go of the past, or whatever, and that just never sat right with me. It’s sort of impossible to let go of the past, you know?”
There were too many things he wanted to say to Harry before they both died. He was the one person he physically could talk to at the moment, but he had a feeling Drys wouldn’t let that happen.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco and Harry go to Hogsmeade.
He let out a small sigh. “To be honest, no, I don’t want to eat in the Great Hall. But, doing so will hopefully make things return back to normal in a quick manner.”
“It’s just, I didn’t even know-”
The Figure kicked something at his feet, which made Draco look down at the motion. There was something- or someone- lying completely still where the muddy ground of the forest and the wet grass of the lawn came to meet. It was still raining outside rather viciously, and it partly obscured Draco’s vision, but he knew, he knew from the bottom of his heart that that someone who was lying in a curled up position next to where the Figure’s cloak touched the ground, was Harry.
“You have it in you, Potter.” Draco lied. Well, Potter might have it in him somewhere. Somewhere very deep that could never be unlocked, that was.
Draco instantly blushed. Pomfrey levitated the item she had dropped and went into her office.
It was a frightening scene. The Kaspian’s once homey and welcoming house was filled with a dozen people dressed up in terrifying masks and filled to the brim with dark magic and energy.
“I don’t know.” It was the truth.
dance. He liked watching Harry dance, and that was enough for him.
In the back of Draco’s mind, he remembered the temperature in the Garden switching from freezing to scolding hot. Now, the temperature was perfect. Everything was perfect. Harry was perfect. Harry was beautiful. Harry was leaning against him and breathing soft, reassuring breaths onto Draco’s neck.
They sat close together, and Draco was blissfully aware of how close they were, and how their hands were still linked together. His free hand fiddled with the gem hidden under his shirt, and he gazed up at the night sky once again, breathing in the freezing air.
Before Draco could even register he was heading in the wrong direction, he ran into someone. Or, rather, someone ran into
7) Theodore Nott.
“Ready.” Draco smiled, and leaned into Harry as they went.
The sound made Potter’s head snap up, and he frowned at the book, knowing that Draco had found
take it yourself.” Harry made a choking sound. “I mean! Don’t do it at all!” Draco hastily added on.
Drys went on. “I hope you boys understand, but I’m now going to have to kill you, Potter. You’re of no use to me now.”
Waking up in the morning was a bizarre experience. He’d woken up next to Harry plenty of times during the Curse, and yet, this time it was entirely different.
He hadn’t exactly meant to tell Potter he was gay, it sort of came out of his mouth without thinking. He never thought straight when he was in the middle of an anxiety attack, so he wasn’t
McGonagall’s office appeared after a bit, and Draco told Pansy that he would meet her down in the common room after.
What appeared as a simple spell used to revive people badly wounded, could be turned into a spell to
Every inch of his body was starting to burn with pain. He was also losing consciousness quickly, he knew it. He just hoped it would engulf him soon, the pain was beginning to become too much.
He tried to sound nonchalant as he accepted Harry’s offer. “Fine.” He shrugged.
“Oh,” Greg said as he took a sip from his drink, “He’s over there, with Granger and Weasley.” He pointed to the middle of the room.
He quickly made himself secure and snug in Harry’s bed, and he wished Harry was asleep so that he could touch his overly soft hair. Draco knew the thought was creepy, but no one ever had to know what he was thinking except himself.
Potter sniffed. “You think?”
“That leads me to another question. How were you able to watch what I was doing? How did you know I had sent a letter? You specifically told me in a vision not to send out another letter, but you couldn’t have possibly known.”
Everything shifted once more, and he was in a blank room. No one else was around. It was just him.
He thought of moments from his childhood to calm himself down. Before Hogwarts. Practicing on a broom for the first time and flying around the grounds, planting flowers and herbs in the gardens with his mum, sorting through papers with his dad whilst they ate biscuits. A much simpler time.
He was sure that in the morning, everything would be okay. But for now, he really wished the world would stop.

Drys scowled in the direction of Alec, then looked back at Draco. “If you pick the right option, Harry will live. If you choose

curse at Potter, and Potter was only defending himself.
And so Harry touched the Mark, with all the gentleness in the world at his fingertips. Draco’s blood was on fire, and his heart was about to escape his chest, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop Harry; he didn’t want Harry to stop.
Harry gave him an incredulous look. “You know latin, now?”
Drys, hell bent on taking revenge for the death of his wife. Forcing the Death Eaters, who he ever so despised, to do his bidding; forced to understand everything that was going on, and yet powerless to act on their own will.
“Fine.” Harry stood next to Draco, also looking out at the beautiful garden. “But, we should definitely come back here again. This can be like our little hang out spot; a reward after a long day of practicing defensive spells.”
“If we can accomplish it,” Draco pointed out.
“It’s just something- I- well, I’ve had for a while. Probably had it since last June. And-” Harry stopped talking, grasping something from behind his neck. Draco had no clue what Harry was doing, but once he was done fiddling with whatever was hidden behind his neck, Draco saw plain and clear Harry was holding a necklace.
“Kaspian,” He and Harry both said at the same time. Draco with intense dislike, and Harry with no emotion at all- maybe a tiny hint of surprise.
“We’re talking about mistakes now, huh?” Potter said as he started trudging back towards Hogsmeade village. Draco stayed quiet. He admitted to himself, he had walked right into that one.
“So, either no one is in the mood for some shopping, or Hogsmeade also got hit with whatever sleeping spell Hogwarts is under.” Potter inquired. “Are you done resting? We should check out all the shops and see if there actually is anyone else awake.”
“Harry, what is all this?” Draco walked closer to the center of the room, eyeing all the stuff around Harry.
