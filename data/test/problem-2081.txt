“Beautiful execution of the amortentia potion, Mr. Potter.” The professor applauded, patting Harry’s shoulder. “Ten points to Gryffindor. Pour a vial and place it on my desk, then go ahead and clean up your cauldron.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Ron reaching for his wand as well, his ears turning scarlet as he glared at Malfoy.
When Slughorn entered the room, Harry’s gaze snapped to him, watching him walk the perimeter of the classroom and sit at his desk. “Alright.” He started, straightening a stack of parchment and digging a quill and red ink from his bag. “I’m going to grade papers.”
“What question?” Harry frowned, pushing a jar of snake hearts out from behind a vial of ground unicorn horn. As much as he had tried to snap, the question had come out just as soft and curious as it felt.
A few more moments of silence passed before Malfoy opened his mouth again, “You never did answer my question.” He said softly, voice lacking it’s usual haughty aire.
They started to turn, resigning themselves to the task of standing together in the tight closet and sorting jars of various potions ingredients. Slughorn caught them before they could take a step toward the stores, “And try your hand at getting along for a minute while you’re in there.” He waved his hand dismissively and Harry and Malfoy made their way to the closet.
Harry thought about this all the way to his dormitory, while he changed out of his soaked clothes and into clean robes, while walking to his next class, while eating lunch, he thought about it straight through to the end of the day, and it wouldn’t be the first time.
When he turned to come back to his cauldron however, his eyes caught Malfoy’s, who was leaning ever so casually against the table where Harry potion sat, still waiting to be cleaned. His heart jumped up to his throat, fingers tingling with nerves as he bit down on the inside of his cheek. Strands of Malfoy’s hair fell into his eyes as he met Harry’s gaze unwaveringly. Harry expected to see a familiar smirk pulling at Malfoy’s thin lips, but his face was locked in an expression Harry couldn’t identify. He would’ve said it was indifference, but Malfoy’s eyes looked so determined, focused, even conflicted.
Harry huffed in frustration, not able to tear his gaze away from Malfoy. Silvery eyes bore into his own, still full of emotion Harry couldn’t put together. Conflicted and mischievous, innocent and decisive all at once. “And detention!” Slughorn added.
Harry’s temples were shining with sweat. His sleeves haphazardly rolled up, red and gold striped tie loosened. He leaned over his potion, stirring carefully as purplish steam swirled from its pearlescent surface. The fumes of treacle tart, and the polished ebony and hazel of his Firebolt filled his nose. He tried to ignore it, but the third fragrance dug its heels into his senses the strongest, cedar wood hair gel and the familiar metallic scent of galleons.
“Am I in your bubble, Potter?” Malfoy shot back sarcastically. Still, they didn’t turn to look at one another, Malfoy avoiding Harry’s eyes just as much as Harry avoided his.
Let’s just walk through from the beginning and see how far we get? I just feel like we’ve forgotten something.
“So your phone. It really does still work, but only if it’s an emergency. Our dads can contact us if it has something to do with Aspen. That’s not Zebb, that’s me. . . . . .okay. . . . . .through here. . . . . . . .”
What are your thoughts on Calla Lilies? Muggle superstition thinks of them as a funeral flower but I think they’re exquisite and personable. Nevertheless, we’ve compromised with calla for the main table and a combination with peony with orange tree twigs on the rest for the reception. There will be Dogwood blossoms and Olive branches for the ceremony. Relatives in Greece are providing the olive from the grove. Mr. Potter’s is sending the dogwood blossoms with a portkey floral service from across the pond. It will be lovely.
It will say something on the front about the size of a pocket and then something larger on the back.
We tied with Louis in the blanket fort competition. Trying to relax today. So what have you done so far?
“I like the penthouse just fine. I just like being able to look over the railing and see the street!”
Yes. Consolidated into one area. Your Firebolt floats above this section. These are the things you need to decide on. We can change things around and add or take things out, but there are main things that should remain constant. We’ll need to see what you have and are willing to show.
Out of respect for Jay and Agruella. I’m going in deep grey and green accessories. Draco in black and white with yellow trim. And we know the press will be watching.
He goes there more often lately. Had Jay organize it. After we moved to Grimmauld he had incentive to clean it up.
“Louis didn’t ask for much help. Just some suggestions for display case vendors and how to lay it out in sections. I’ve tried to stay out of it because this was your project together but . . . . Jeezuz Harry.”
“This section is more like the first. Soft and rounded sculptural paintings instead and more solid colours. Then through to the last one I just threw in for fun to end it.”
OMFG. You two. She’s just being honest. Harry, this is your own fault for bringing your private discussions with Draco into the main chat. DIMWIT. What did you expect?
Al and Scorp won’t want everyone to get crocked. Al needs to teach us Nevilles Alcohol deplete charm. I still think we need a Family Charm Bank! Someone help me out here. I think I saw a mouse the other day. I need that Uncle Charlie critter ward.
“This is what it looked like in 1940. She who shall not be named didn’t inherit the place until ’46, so this is before she did her “alterations”.”
Hurling tickets! Can I get four tickets for the Kilkenny match? Bats and Hornets. Draco and I want to bring the Minister and her husband.
Louis has things under control. That’s ready to go. We are staying simple. We have a beautiful line of hand painted scarves, hair brushes, combs and some very nice pearl hair clips. A few other accessories. All very lovely. The scent diffusers also have turned out very well. I’ve got your originals to return. He also found some wonderful containers for gifts.
“I can imagine they will. Mother I think it’s time for a break. Do you think there’s anything in the wine cellar that’s drinkable?”
“Just a formality really, but just to be sure I’d like to perform the test on Mr. Evans. Would you allow it?”
“I’m trying out the new machine. I’ll make you my special latte. You got me the almond syrup. Draco made biscotti!”
I like them both. The one you kept would be good in the den. Maybe the nursery? In a light wood frame to go with the pine. White matte. I like the deep blue.
So the credit cards delivered to Grayson? Is the code the same as mine? Any reason why the Goblin didn’t give him the code?
“I know. . . . . . I asked Louis to try to concentrate most of it into this one section. I figure this is the stuff most people are originally going to come to see.”
“Draco and Dad are being all mushy. Jerry is pumped. I think he’s finally getting used to being thrown into the Grandparent mix.”
“First of all because you’re just a fucking painting. Maybe also because you were a dreadful pathological MONSTER who deserves much worse than what’s coming TODAY.
So that’s pretty much it for the Prophet. Draco and I have set up a separate publishing arm of the enterprises for it. We’ve agreed that we don’t have any interest in content so that’s all the new editor. We'll just stay hands-off for the most part.
Hugo and Grayson are hot. And it was Uncle Harry, Uncle Ron and the freaking Minister of Magic. All at that cafe.
“That’s nice too. So now behind the screen is our second look with the green mulberry silk you’ve chosen. I think you’ll like the black piping. Go change into that with these cordovan loafers. . . . . .”
Behind a glass wall. Mr. Liogell says the entire lab could be transported intact without disturbing it and kept under its stasis. Returned to the vault when we’re done.
I don’t know. I’ll read you a comic book or SOMETHING. I can be very creative when I put my mind to it. And don’t forget about my magic fingers.
Yes its still there. I’m up for it. You’re right it’s not much to look at but the food is worth the eyesore. They’ll have the steak au poivre that you like.
“But I’ve realized my biggest mistake. . . .When your mum and I decided to do it we went straight to Mungo’s. Never considered Poppy. Never even consulted with her.”
“Yes, it looks like I did quite a nice job. My kisses have left a constellation on your flawless skin. It’s some of my best work!”
You will be able to apparate directly to the front porch! You all have floo access to the receiving parlour but Decram will be disappointed if you don’t come through the front door! Just ring the bell and come in. Door will be unlocked. Say hello to Decram and then head up the stairs to the second floor or take the elevator.
How dare YOU to assume that you would just pick and choose an heir to the Black heritage based on your own contemptible opinion?
No there’s a huge food fair before the match. You guys want Yellow or Purple? Hornets are yellow bats are purple.
“That’s what this garden is all about. You come here in solitude and just do nothing. Stare at the rocks and moss and imagine a far away place from all the stress. That little beach on the mossy rock. . . . Think of you and I just sitting on an island with our feet in the water.”
“I know it’s Ed Sheeran you play that song every ten freaking minutes. It’s practically the Ed Sheeran radio channel these days.”
“I am. But I’ve been waiting for this marriage for longer than you can imagine. This cake is going to be beautiful and taste wonderful. I’ll help you along as you need it while I do the other things.”
Like I said. I know! But I understand. She’s taking the opposite fork in the road from when Scorp was coming. That was a nightmare. She insisted on EVERY detail of the pregnancy. Astoria was about ready to slap her in the face with a dead trout.
Oh Wait! Blaise Zabini is coming, wait for him. And Narcissa is setting up some drinks, but all we have is wines and champagne. If you want something else you need to bring it. And snacks? We’ve got nothing and have been ordering delivery.
I had inheritances that I didn’t accept when I came of age. The Goblins at Gringotts tried over the years to convince me to accept but I didn’t want to.
LLL: Okay boys, thanks for speaking with me today. I think we’ll stop here. I look forward to catching up with you at the wedding!
Nope. I wasn’t really mad to begin with. I got over that a long time ago. Now that we have a plan and I'm comfortable with where it's headed I'm excited. I just wish there was more time.
Replace hardware throughout the house with brushed nickel. Draco will choose. This includes faucets, cabinet hardware, door and window hardware etc. Some of this could maybe be done with Dean’s transfiguration/charm work.
going to desecrate it or go anywhere near those faded and moth-eaten robes. They don’t look like they’ve seen a cleaning spell in a hundred years.
You’re last because you have the best hair? Not really its just random and that’s how it came up. We can change the order if you want.
That’s what we need to talk about. I think we could do brooms there because there are no unregulated ingredients like potions. Just Jamie’s charms. We can bring in the metalwork from my guy in France. As long as Jamie comes in once a week to perform his magic it would be perfect.
You are all asked to gather in my offices at 17:30 just to be safe. I’m not sorry to inform you that we are pulling a fast one on the Wizengamot as it currently exists. As you may or may not know, I’ve been waiting for this opportunity all of my adult life. HUMOUR ME.
“Scorp. This is a portkey. Simple, but efficient. I didn’t have a lot of time. It’s only two buttons on this one. First one takes you to the steps in front of your flat. Second one puts you on the back porch here. Run home and grab some essentials for an overnight. You boys need to try out these new sheets.”
“Actually we ALL get pampered all weekend at the poolside and have a campfire and a sauna and a lava heated soaking tub thing. Then we can all go for the fishing on Sunday morning and have breakfast on the beach.”
“I don’t know! He made a joke about not dating married men in the chat room last night and it just sent my head spinning. Then everything just made sense.”
“Well, we’d better just keep driving around for a while, otherwise they won’t believe I’ve properly instructed you.”
“He likes termites and mice mostly. Uncle Nev’s frog terrariums are outstanding. You should see the charms on these things there’s a whole pond in there for him.”
“I promised we’d do karaoke in the cellar on Wednesday. I’ve invited Gin and Jerry, but he get’s to choose the songs.”
“Let’s look at the others. This is an earlier work of Teddy’s. It also hangs near the entrance at Draco’s.”
“UGH. I know. But she’ll still be around. And this got the bakery off to a great start. That space is beautiful. I love the last minute name change. “Groy’s Bakery in Knockturn”.”
“There’s going to be a lot of food as you might expect. Al and Zebb will be here in a little while to set that up.”
“I don’t care for the carpets or the floors so yes. Whatever you like. Polished stone would be pretty up here. I’m not sure about all of those bedrooms.”
“So now, it’s my turn to ask you an embarrassing question while we gaze upon our hard working husbands.”
He’s totally FINE. Peeling potatoes and boiling something. Says he’s going to leave it to simmer while he checks on the work outside. I brought up my food processor from downstairs for him.
“This is a special bag from Hermione and Rose. All of your things will fit in here. You could fit a house in it and still carry it around. It won't change weight.”
“And now I feel bad because Harry and Draco cancelled their weekend plans and are staying here because I was too nervous to handle this on my own and all of the others are coming to go over things in three hours and. . . . .”
Not in so many words, but Tory knew how I felt about you even if I didn’t? That’s difficult to explain.
Those with magical abilities are free to enjoy themselves without fear of outside interference. This includes Mr. Potter’s family and staff members who will also have access to the park. Glamours will not be required.
“Oh MERLIN. Okay. . . . . come on . . . . over here for a minute . . . . . . . . . . Lucy. Have a seat on this bench right here. We’re going to have a quick talk. Cousin to Cousin.”
“So then you would need to walk from here through those doors and into the centre of the atrium. The main ceremony will take place in there.”
“I do the same thing. Not the socks thing but the shoes. I’ve always done it. It’s the rule at my Mum’s.”
Well I can’t see myself needing a bus! I’d be interested in seeing if there’s something that could be used for a short trip or errands? Maybe even a longer trip sometime. Grayson has a driving license for the Isle of Man. We’re going to see if we can get him one for here. Maybe he can take us.
“I’m talking about the fish. The last thing that Harry said he needs to finish the conservatory. That’s the last element of your marriage goal. A million Muggle pounds well spent I think.”
“Mione bought you the TWIZY! Do you like the colour? Jay and Dean have it all fixed and ready to go. Same protections as mine. PLUS it’s got the Wheezes logo on the door. There’s plenty of leg room for you and it even has a really cool sound system and everything! . . . . . . ”
Just to tame your rat’s nest and make sure the robes are pressed. We’re all coming over to supervise. Grayson is helping Trandy with lunch. You two are just going to let us dress you up and be props.
That’s a good law Harry. The ministry is already messed up and antiquated. We’ll be able to accelerate reform I hope, but the Minister (myself or whoever comes after me) doesn’t need undue influence.
“So this whole section was Louis’ idea of a time capsule of sorts. If we walk to the end here’s the cloak and my trunk. Minnie did a temporary fix on the map so we can show it. Blurs out the names of any student but shows teachers and administrators."
Today I give you “headlines”. I cannot speculate on these subjects with substance, so I will summarize in headline form:
Eric did. I just did the transfig. They’re going to go on display for the new show opening at the gallery. Eric is now officially a showing artist.
“We can take them for coffee? That third button is Gringotts. Front steps. Walk to Fortescue's maybe?”
“The elusive elf of Prince Manor. . . . yes let’s do that. We should ask Sev for some more pointers. . . . . ”
“Not really, that’s Bartók. The sound board is really fantastic. Bosendorfer. This thing was manufactured in Vienna.”
“If we take a step back can you explain? I understand educator, spy and what you call death eater, but not protector.”
5. Final request. If at all possible please don’t write all of that disclaimer nonsense at the beginning of my correspondence any more? I understand how it works. Just give me the charm code please? Doesn’t your hand hurt having to write the same thing over every time?
Wanted to also say thanks for not pushing too much on the baby. We know that you knew so thanks for keeping mum on it. When we did the interview we hadn’t told anyone yet. Even now, just immediate family.
“When we’re ready to start you get that wok HOT, hold your wok spatula, stand back and throw that brandy into it. And I mean stand back there will be flames.”
Big news comes out of Knockturn Alley as a flurry of activity over the past days has caused much excitement for shoppers in Magical London.
Okay I’ll give you people another chance, but I’m sitting here with my arms folded in Malfoy Scold Mode.
It’s huge. He’s got a whole sitting area and a fireplace. He did say that if you’re curious he’d bring any of you down there.
Amphibians: Toad, Frog, Newt or Fire Dwelling Salamander with approval. If you would like a complimentary amphibian please contact Deputy Headmaster, Professor Lovegood-Longbottom. He has many beautiful specimens available. Free to adopt. You must attend his care for your slippery beast seminar prior to accepting the responsibility. Adoption includes complimentary aquarium, plants and additional accessories.
YES! but the location has to be kept confidential? Sorry. More secrets. And it’s warded. OH SO WARDED, hard to explain . . . Help me out here Draco, how do we do this part???
“We wanted time to put things back together. Take a look. Grayson remembered where everything had been so its all back where it should be.”
In order to accomplish this major work we know that this will be an inconvenience. We are asking all of our Muggle tenants to temporarily vacate their basement spaces. Non-exempt Muggle tenants will not have access to their basements for the duration. We ask you to please move ALL items from the back wall facing the park at least 2.5 meters. A combination of Linder and Goblin workers will be performing a ritual to restore the basements. You will be contacted by our scheduler at least one day in advance and the first process will take approximately 2 hours.
Harry’s conditioner would not be good for general use. It would make normal hair go all limp. Too heavy.
“What do you mean intact? The bedroom or the house? I thought the whole place would have been trashed.”
You’re at least going to come out as more than business partners after the wedding. That’s going to take off a lot of pressure. And you’re moving out of the cottage to Grimmauld. Think about that.
“You’re not the housekeeper here. We share okay? I’m just as responsible for the upkeep as you are.”
Alright then . . . . . Everyone in favour of the Legislation on the table raise your hand. . . . . . . .I see. . . . . . .and those opposed? . . . . . . . . Alright that is very interesting . . . . . .
It’s confirmed. I’ve asked and explained the situation. We now have six first year students coming back for the summer session. They’re excited and happy to help!
“Did you know the kids all want Hogwarts gear now? She’s scrambling to make vintage style robes and scarves. Freaking neck ties too. Even for six year olds.”
Hold on. They WILL get the information about the seats and the titles that’s public records. We can ask the Goblins and Hermione how long that can be delayed. You can keep everything about the properties and vaults private.
“That’s all Jamie and Teddy. They let the boys take the lead from day one. The woman at the Children’s, she really is something. The boys came as a team not knowing what or where they were getting thrown into next. Jon is finally able to just be the brother and have some fun as a kid. Again, that’s all Jamie and Teddy. . . . They were ready. The boys were ready. We were all ready. And don’t discount the fact that they’ve got a support system that most people don’t.”
Well since the Profit isn’t going to write up some trash that you must reply to, can we make Quib articles an excuse to meet at the leaky?
“If you’re worried about it I’ll explain. You tell us what you think. We’d like to do something to generate some traffic down here.”
8 paintings ʛ150,000.00 galleons. Converted to Muggle currency at the current rate: £750,000.00 pounds.
“That’s how it works. That’s what makes you tick. Harry comes up with the crazy idea and you execute it together. Knockturn needs a crazy idea. You can clean the cobblestone every day but if there’s nobody to see it in daylight what’s the point?”
I fear it’s not going to be nice in the news when it does happen. I’m pleading with you to just ignore them. They’ll have plenty to write about once we take our Wizengamot seats and I guarantee it won’t just be gossip about us.
I’ve been there before. So I offered to take her. Al might come down to see the shop. I told him to take some time for himself.
The Department of Portkey Transport (DPT) is a monopolistic RACKET that we should break into. I at least need a license.
“Merlin, here we go again!. . . . . No. Did you look at the time? You’re staying here with me for at least the next three hours. I’d like tea though?”
National Gallery has several important Rubens’. We could go see those sometime, but really you should go through the manor galleries first. I only had a short glimpse and as you say it’s “A Lot”.
“Yes. Ever since they followed me and found out where it is I’m sure they have someone posted there. They are desperate for a photo of us in a compromising position, like coming home late at night and then reporting about you not leaving.”
“No. This is the best gift. I wasn’t ready for it before now. Before the kids I probably would have stored the wands with my paint brushes if I’m honest.”
“You’re getting ahead of yourself again. Yes Blaise would be ecstatic, but why couldn’t you pick one of the simpler ones like the street preservation thing?”
Wow. Okay so that’s cool. I was thinking of enclosing the little front courtyard and using that as an apparition point for visitors? I would want that built before removing the Fidelius though.
I was going to post this one on Saturday, but I kept going back to it and needed to stop so I could move on to the others. Enjoy!
“You use this ring to hold it together you don’t even have to tie it! It will go nice with your magenta hair. . . . . I’ve thought this out, Draco!”
The exterior should open up for you. Come up on the porch and ring the bell. I think there’s still a bell? If not, knock really loud!
UGH. That’s the problem THERE ISN’T ONE. It’s all fucking PERFECT. Right down to the god damned yellow cushions on the patio. It’s like he read our minds! DID HE???
Look what I found over here it’s a VAULT with another billion galleons!! How about a castle? It's a ruin, but it's all yours now! It just didn’t stop!
“NO! Don’t you dare. That’s not what I meant. I just don’t believe I didn’t think of a fucking playground. . . there’s parent’s and kids living in the townhouses and I never fucking thought of it. I’ll admit I’ve been a little distracted with everything else going on, but this. . . this is magnificent.”
There are no other details and no date set but we’ll give an update if and when more information becomes available.
I’m excited about it too. I think it’s going to turn out looking excellent. Okay Lily, that’s all for now then. Give Eric my number so we can contact each other later if needed.
You certainly weren’t wrong when you said they were fast and efficient. I may just have to consider talking to Jay about making it permanent if they’re interested. They’ve already made enough of the first batches to cover and replenish the backorders. Enough to stock the store too.
Dean and Seamus can’t do it. Mr. Liogel either. They’re heading out right after they finish for Goblin Hurling. I’ll put it on the schedule. Want me to ask anyone else?
I’ll ask Minnie what she thinks on the map. I think there’s a solution. I’ve got a lot of other things that I couldn’t justify getting rid of. You know me well enough to know that I kept it all. Needs to be sorted through. I don’t think you want my old sweets cards. A lot of old school books. Molly’s Christmas jumpers? What else?
“This is more like Muggle psychology. You were only six. You don’t want to remember it. I have two ways to do it. First I have to find it. Let me in again?”
“HEY EVERYBODY DID YOU KNOW THAT AL’S A PARSELMOUTH JUST LIKE HIS DAD? WELL NOW YOU DO! . . . .There. Now you don’t have to worry about that anymore.”
“That’s my fault. I kept you too sheltered. I will tell you that I was completely gutted leaving you there, even with Luna. It got easier, but Merlin that was a tough day.”
“Oh . . . . we could, but that might be too much and not very tasty. The stemware here is acceptable!”
Okay let’s do that. And I want to name Hugo Granger-Weasley as a legal advisor to oversee the foundation account and others that are to come. He will be a signer for grants as well.
“Then we just threw rocks into the lake for a while. Went back to his old hut. Made a fire and some tea. Had cake . . . . . . . cleaned the place up a bit, but Lily and Eric have been taking care of it a lot. Even helping with the pumpkins. They’re getting super big.”
Tonight at 16:00 the locking charms preventing access to the park as well as “the tent” will be removed. All tenants will have full access from your basement level.
Or, you could explore the Prince Overview Point property. It's a nice juxtaposition to the others. Draco would take you there.
I’m writing today because I am aged and weakened. I’ve decided to return to the Lodge today just briefly to put things in place for when I’m gone and see it one last time.
“Something is NOT RIGHT. Melody drove right over and said nothing is out of the ordinary, but your door buzzer downstairs is out of order and my key doesn’t work.”
“Very pretty. Classic. I really like the pale yellow on the exterior. The brickwork cleaned up nicely. I’m glad you didn’t try to make it look new. . . .What kind of signage do you want?”
Please take care of that right away. I thought Draco was going to cry at the sight of the jewels and accessories. Oh, also we might actually borrow a brooch for Louis? The onyx and diamond snake brooch? It really looked good on him instead of a neck tie. And if it’s not too much perhaps the ring that matches?
I would recommend it. You might even prefer to target the date a few years prior to insure that Walburga did not have influence over the decor. After we do this step then you can see what the original footprint looked like and decide what to do with the furnishings. They will be restored to that date and may be in a condition to either be used or sold/donated. You can then decide if you want to move on to phase 2. You may not want to?
“Actually the fixtures aren’t bad. The cabinetry though. Pretty lackluster and I don’t care for the tile countertop.”
Then I figured we’d just have every room painted bright white. Throughout the whole house. Wallpaper gone. Oh, Except for the Nursery. Al doesn’t want the nursery touched. I may be able to convince him to let us replace the flooring in there, but I wouldn’t touch it otherwise. Also not touching fireplaces, just a good cleaning. Or the maple paneling and red brick in Harry’s offices The other trims and woodwork are good. Doors and trim just cleaned and polished.
Seriously you guys have to see the kitchen. Dad and I didn’t have a clue and these guys really went out of their way to get it done. Hugo even hooked up dad’s music to a thing on the fridge! Made dad cry. And they got all of his equipment out of storage and all cleaned up and put away.
“Okay. . . . . thanks for saving my ugly fucking dinner. I’ll try a garnish of some sort to at least make it look edible.”
Harry, I apologize for using text but it’s the easiest way to reach you at the moment. I know you’re busy but I’m going to leave this for you to review when you’re free.
“But even if it were remotely possible to pass that down, Remus was cured so that would NOT have even been feasible. Fuck her again!”
The only things I’m really concerned about are the bedrooms of Sirius and Regulus. I’d like them moved to a vault like what you did with Lily’s room at the cottage.
He’s sexy as all hell. He’s a gentleman. He has a great business brain. He likes dumb things like abandoned amusement parks. He doesn’t mind my crazy shoe fetish, likes it actually. He doesn’t mind if I grab him and apparate to Berlin for dinner and doesn’t complain about “being the man” when I pick up the tab. We both appreciate beauty in people of all genders and not just in what most people consider beautiful. And He’s sexy as all hell but I told you that already. And you people all have to just STOP using the term pretty boys for attractive men who are always coming on to him. That’s frustrating. He’s got a quirky side that’s refreshing. IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?
“Oh Merlin, Hugo. We’re all over the moon about that. And if you want to reevaluate your stance on soul mates we can start that conversation with those two.”
OMG. THATS AWFUL! Why didn't they just build a fucking fence! They could have just roasted the fucking goat! Or even maybe made chèvre? WTF???
“He’s just happy and tired I think. Jon’s a hugger like you were Lils. They love coming over after school. We get them two afternoons a week.”
Of course it’s okay. You’ve already been keyed into the wards so that’s not a problem. Grayson lives in the townhouse you’re enclosing #14.
“Yes. She’s both. Healer, mind healer and psychologist. She’s retired, but she’d do it for you. Psychologist might be a better fit for what you’re going through. A Muggle psychiatrist wants to treat you with medications mostly.”
“Harry, I have so many paintings in storage it’s embarrassing. And sculptures. We can fill the gallery so some of it can be seen. Rotate some favourites from here to Grimmauld. We can pick together some things to go out in the main rooms?”
“She wants us to use the Black wedding platform. The one from Al and Scorp’s wedding. She’s got it shrunk in her bag.”
“I know this is a little out of the blue. . . Okay that’s an understatement this is WAY off the quidditch pitch. . . .”
That was what disturbed me even more than the purple ostrich. I couldn’t say anything in front of the kids but yes, it unsettled me.
Ask him to take you, it's really cool. And not just trinkets though. He's got another room full of war stuff I think.
“ . . . . . . . . It’s NOT too much. It’s all done and ready to go. I just need to get the stupid owls done and then I’m back on schedule.”
Sunflower garden . . . . . . toothpaste factory, but that would go with the U.S. cosmetic stuff . . . . . . coffee shop for Bee to manage? . . . . . Travel agency we could coordinate with your portkeys for long range vacations . . . . . . Wisteria for along the walls of the townhouses in the park. . . . . music concerts in the gardens at Decram’s manor. . . that would have to be in midsummer . . . . . I was going to ask Maeda to look over the waterworks to see if he had some suggestions. . . . . Expansion of the counseling centre . . . . . Do you remember my hollyhock garden? I was thinking I’d help Al revive that at the old cottage. . . . . Do you fancy the idea of aquatics attached to the rec centre at Hogwarts? Jamie could help with that and I think the kids would like it . . . . . . Here’s a cooking school . . . . Knockturn could use a wine shop don’t you think? That could be the shop on the street and the cooking school above . . . I don’t know. . . wine and cheeses and cooking instruction. . . could work. . . . . . I was thinking the Children’s Society could have an offshoot for young adults with a residence and employment services. . . .family planning maybe. . . . . . . . . Hogsmeade needs a technology centre. . . . and street preservation, those cobblestones need cleaning and one of these days some poor old guy is going to trip on a missing one, It’s just a matter of time and it would be a shame for them to pave over the original street just to stave off a lawsuit. . . . .I still want to have those instruments in the music classroom downstairs looked at and either donated or sold or something. I don’t know anything about those instruments, but you and your Mother are right it’s a shame they’re not being used. . . . and I want to buy a piano for Groy to put in front of her bakery so she can play her compositions . . . . .”
“Zebb, I swear I’m better now. Let’s take next week to get things started. Draco and I are going to be spending most of this weekend with Ginny and Jerry. But I want Grayson out of the Leaky. Zippy and Patt out of the freaking hostel. Are the townhouses furnished and ready for living in or is that all just cosmetic? I know they look nice.”
Yes, I believe so. Teaching a new potion to the France crew. Simple one. Shouldn’t take much longer. Good thing about the Goblins.
“Yeah, my poor text fingers have been burning up the phone since before you went on your service call.”
Why don’t you get yourself together, pick up Lucy from school and bring her over here? I’ve got news and I can help explain things to Lucy. I’m waiting for some more information, but it’s all good news. Bring her Hogwarts letter with you.
“I always forget about your business acumen because you’re my Mother. And then I remember who taught me everything.”
Do you think maybe you could get your parents to meet with him? They might have a better perspective.
Just one thing. Thanks for all of your work lately. I know I’ve been a pain with all the last minute requests.
“Yeah. We have plant delivery tomorrow too. You’ll be able to check out the planters end of day. The fountain installation will be finished on Saturday. Liogell was over this morning and we’ve tentatively set to remove the charm on Monday then.”
“This is Dean. We have a small work order from your building owner. I will need access to your top floor if that’s alright with you.”
"The Trandy thing isn’t a big deal. I was just wondering how he felt about Zebb taking the family name.”
“I think so? Who better to explain this to Muggles than an actual Muggle? They’re exempted because they live in the complex.”
“I see. Well after you “crush” me I’m going to crush you under the quidditch stands! Then there’s a picnic on the pitch.”
“He’s a sixteenth century floppy headed homosexual who built one of the most outrageous manors ever to be seen. Clam shells and cherubs with rubies and diamonds . . . . . to be sure. . . . He also commissioned what is probably the finest collection of baroque and renaissance art on the planet. Don’t get me started on the family collection of jewels. . . . . and yet, he values his connection to Harry more than anything. . . . . He can rattle off the names of every single family visitor and takes great pride in answering the fucking door. We love him and the family loves him and we’re all afraid that you WILL insult him. He’s not like other portraits.”
“Well, it was after Lucius offed himself in Azkaban. Mother seemed to turn a page. It was subtle at first, then when Scorpius was born she came to me for a long conversation. That’s a story for another day. Considering where we all started and how far we’ve come I think we’ve done pretty damned good. Our kids are all level headed, grounded and despite the obvious, they know the actual value of things and not just in a superficial way. They do understand that it’s unusual, and that they have been given a life that others don’t receive. Shift your knee.”
“Would you like to go to Diagon Alley for dinner? I thought we’d go there. . . Call it a birthday dinner even though we’re coming to your party on Friday?”
“. . . .so . . . . I think you have everything you need in her travel bag here. . . just follow the Poppy feeding chart?”
“How about a compromise? I’ll just shrink them and you can think about it later? Either way you’re not going to want to leave these sitting out.”
“Teddy’s art is very different from what you are used to. Draco and I really prefer more modern works. I’m going to commission several paintings from Teddy for here at Grimmauld, he could use the special process for those paintings and you could visit those too!”
I’m taking them to shop for the school things on Saturday, Hogwarts on Sunday to meet with Minnie. Took them to Diagon tonight for dinner. They’re a little overwhelmed.
Merlin. Miss Anna has set up what looks like a whole coffee shop in the dining hall. I think Al is going to want to come back here just for Miss Anna’s hot chocolate.
“Okay, since you wouldn’t let us tell anyone about your shenanigans tomorrow, we couldn’t arrange for a stag party. Consider this your stag dinner. You’re also not as subtle as you think you are. . . Grayson and Hugo figured you out. They’re here too.”
Over the years, the Wizarding media and public have been spent countless hours speculating on the personal lives of these families. Unfortunately most if not all of the coverage has been (if I can say politely) inaccurate, contrived out of spite or wholly fabricated on speculation.
Louis. Do you accept three of my, oh hell I’ve lost count. . . . . seats on the Wizengamot of your own free will?
“A magical house of this era will most likely tune into your magic. Anticipate your needs. You may think one day "it would be nice if there was an extra closet" and a few days later it might just be there.”
“Well then you tell them they have free passes to the foam party instead, and pay them to keep an eye out for anything unusual like actual alcohol behind the bar that isn’t watered down to worthless.”
I agree. This one should have been taken care of years ago. Our community is far behind the times on this.
“That’s your car! We’ll take out the Ghost just for fun. Well, we’ll take them all out just for fun, but this one can be your favourite. . . . LOOK! It’s Grayson’s speedster! Hey it didn’t have those whitewall tires in the photo!”
“Nothing. The wand, although unusual in form will be more than adequate for the boy’s lifetime. If he chooses later that the wand needs a different aesthetic we can address that issue, but I would be very wary to alter it.”
He likes the owlery. He’s got friends up there. He can snuggle with the one Harry named Elaine. Trust me on this.
Quite the opposite. It is just a very unexpected request from a wizard. I will owl you the lyrics but the pronunciation in the native language may be very difficult. It would be my honor to teach it to you.
. . .OH. . .Excalibur, the weird war! That’s hilarious. We have reading material, Scarhead! You are going to absolutely love Hellboy.”
I had an idea about this the other day. We need a Family “Charm Bank”. Where we can all share our custom spells and charms. Also, did you happen to notice that the lovebirds seem to have gone silent?
“Most capable. Genius level capable. You’ll have to take my word for it at this point, but please give him the benefit of the doubt. Hear out his suggestions.”
With that stated, a student’s personal identity is just that. Hogwarts students come in all shapes, sizes, genders, sexualities and nationalities. Part of the Hogwarts experience is embracing our differences and learning from them. That is Hogwarts policy.
Someday I’m going to find out what the obsession was with these people and all the fucking jewelry. I really don’t get that at all.
“The wedding is going to be VERY complicated and it’s time for you to understand the process. Time is running short!”
“You’re right, that’s perfect! That could work. But I’m going to have to hire a whole fucking staff to maintain this place.”
Any written information about the Manor would be appreciated (something similar to what we received in Iceland perhaps).
“Your turn is coming up too. Hold on. . . . So let’s go around the table and you tell us how you’d like to be addressed. . . .Left to right. . . .
My penmanship tutor, Amanda O’Byrne, taught all of the Black children going back to the 1940’s. She was long in the tooth when she taught me. Related to Finnigan I believe. Yes, she would have been tutor to Sirius and Regulus as well.
“Jay. I want a review of all staff salaries and compensation. I want a review done at the accountants office for the employees at the centre. I want the equivalent of these fucking taxes wiped out with a salary increase and end of year bonus. I want this done now with the staff we’re hiring today. 20 percent increase across the board. I’ll have Draco contact the accountants. I’ll take a meeting with your boss to make sure YOU are being fairly compensated for your time and efforts as well.”
Alright back to the wedding. We’ve already decided on flowers. Decided on location. Menu is decided. I think the atrium will be beautiful. That view! You’ve chosen linens, flatware and china for the reception.
“No! That’s not it . . . . . it’s just . . . . . Dad. That was the first day I met Scorp. We were sitting right there just like it was yesterday!”
I’ll have to admit that it was a little disconcerting to have the Minister come into my study and crawl under my desk to set this up.
Maybe we could enclose that front courtyard with a wrought iron fence and gate? Turn the little courtyard into an apparition point for guests. That way also we don’t have people flooing directly into the first living room. They can come to the door like real guests!
I was going to stay back because it’s quite a hike. Mister Thom showed up with a freaking golf cart to take me!
I have confirmed with Narcissa that she will attend. She actually liked the idea of sitting with Kreacher. We will be there at noon.
The exhibition is free to the public with donations accepted. All proceeds go to the Diagon Children’s Society.
“I hope not. But it will take you some time to settle in and move things around where you want them.”
Same glass, yes. It’s what is in Harry’s kitchen and the master bath upstairs. It’s the rolled textured glass with metal mesh. Glass will be fine for the garage we might just want to make it a bit more obscure. We’ll light it from inside at night. There are exterior carriage lights already.
Why would you want to do that? Hogwarts belongs to everybody! Malkin’s already has permission from the ministry to produce those things.
“Okay, I’m going to quote my employer right now. . . ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! . . . .I don’t need to forget this.”
So now what? They’ve got our photo. Do you think they’ll say we’re having an affair? That would be fun. Nev could use a good laugh and the boys would be in stitches.
“No, Cib say’s she want’s to put that in. I’ll go up and give her a hand on occasion, but this is going to be my primary responsibility. And helping you out at the cottage garden."
“Go through that set of doors, I’ll venture that there are plates and linens. Don't bring out the good china.”
“I’d like you to just be yourself and say hello. Have a conversation if you’d like. Maybe we come up with something for when we have a fundraiser or party.”
Dean, Seamus, Iris (Dean will fetch her). Their two guys (if they want). Al, Scorp, Draco, You, Hugo, Jay, Sean, Rose, Jerry, and Ginny if she can make it.
“And, well. . . . .Look at the clock! It’s quitting time! I’ve just decided we’re both finished for the day and I’m not your boss anymore! ”
“I actually am. Maybe I’m not over the shock yet? But really . . . I think I’m good. Talked to my Mum for quite a while this morning.”
Keepler Elfs are in the United States. They are forced to hollow out trees for shelter and work in laborious positions in hidden magical biscuit factories. The Muggles even put their poor grimacing pictures on the boxes of biscuits! Sometimes they stamp their little faces right onto the biscuit! Horrible labour conditions. It is my belief that if they are found and immigrate to the UK they should be covered by this legislation. Some people do not believe of their existence. But if they do exist they should be covered.
Who HASN’T been down there is a better question? But we’re looking forward to the get together tomorrow!
Okay this is a copy and paste. . . .give it a minute to read over and we’ll go from there. Part one is coming:
“Okay, you sit right here. Both Davey and Jon. . . . . . .Lily, I need you to come and help me out.”
Oh come on. That lion is an idiot. Just comes out of a forest to eat and finds a bag of straw and a glorified fucking watering can. Like those would be tasty. . . . .And THEN he doesn’t just eat the girl. WHY? She’s pretty and all, but not THAT pretty.
Harry, I am pleased to inform you that your first piece of legislation has passed and that the vote of the Wizengamot is unanimous in favour.
“And the rest we’ll clean up and restore back. Put those long planters back in place. We’ll need a separate crew to restore those. . . . But no crews for the conservatory, we’re doing that all by hand and I’ve got Cibly. . . . Maybe two or three Italian cypress in each planter to create some privacy for the units but not make it too enclosed. But those get awfully tall. . . .”
Okay, If you’re both good I’ll draw up my plan. Get some samples together. We can invite the boys to go over our ideas and see what they think? Maybe tomorrow? Ginny could you do that?
“And now if you will take my arm . . .this other one. . . I will escort you to the dining room kitchens.”
“Al and I have some vegetables at the cottage garden. We like to share them with the family. We grow pumpkins for the family halloween carvings and pies of course. Last year was a lot of lettuces. We tried artichokes and aubergines once, but that was a disaster. The asparagus is still good though. . . . We could have the pumpkin carving here next year. We can share all of the vegetables with the staff too. Would they like that? We could do beets here and put in a lattice for snap peas on the end there. Long beans on the other side. Put in some peppers in the center area where the sun hits nice. . . . That whole area could be tomatoes. Maybe there’s some heritage seeds for those in the herbology cabinets? . . . . Do you like radishes? I think potatoes are a waste of time but I like growing onions and garlic. . . .leeks! Leeks have the best flowers if you let them go to seed . . . . we could dry the flowers and put them in that vase on the guest level foyer. . . .I do use chives quite a lot but they need their own space so over there. Cabbage is always good, and arugula. I could make that salad Draco likes. . . kale? just NO. Nobody really want’s to eat kale. . . . If we had a rhubarb in that corner I could make the reduction sauce for ice cream. We could put in some neeps they’re good in a stew but not much else. I’m not fond of them mashed. What do you say?”
His Mum owns the school. You met Luna? I’d trust him with anyone, including my own grandkids. What makes you wary?
“Honey, I just didn’t know. It’s a really long story. When your Grandmother was still alive it was more of an issue. I still really don’t understand it myself. We’re going to have to learn about this together.”
“These pants. . . . . . .socks. . . . . . . . . .turn around and don’t look. . . . . . .okay turn back around and put on these trousers.”
Yes, that can be done. Depending what the item is it could be a little overwhelming. The vaults are vast. Particularly the Peverell consolidated.
They brought us coffee and pastries to the lake. There’s even tables down there. They’ve outdone themselves. Mr. Gunnar is a total crackup. He’s got a magic fish smoker. Danika is fascinated with it. He’s helping out. We’re all now headed to the dining hall for breakfast.
You hate it? It’s platinum with a muggle carbon fibre inset. I know it’s simple and not horribly expensive or anything, but I liked it.
“No, Draco. I’m just the caretaker. What the hell am I going to do with another 18 cabinets full of fucking jewelry?”
“And with that . . . . as Wizengamot Chief Warlock I bring this session to a close! Let’s get back to the party!”
All files and documents have been updated to reflect the change. The historical documents have also been amended. We have informed Mr. Lupin-Potter to use the term for his access as well.
“I understand that, but they really are just doing their jobs. I don’t think they were being intentionally illusive. They were just excited that you were finally doing it. You did hear Liogell say that he’s worked on the accounts for some 50 odd years. You know that this has been his entire career. Just your accounts.”
“There’s three of those. Different years. Draco likes the Ghost one, but I think when he sees the continental he’ll change his mind. You can take us out in that one.”
This will be a joint venture for the Malfoy-Potter-Weasley partnership. We’re going to have to bring your Uncles George and Ron into the mix .
I Love and miss you too. I will see you in my dream tonight I’m sure. You’ll be sitting by a fire and reading your book with Snabb dozing on your shoulder.
“I’ve done some research overnight. We can go over the details later, but, it’s the shampoo scents that are interesting. Of course they all want to smell like Harry or oddly enough, you . . . . and Hugo for some reason.”
“This is the only area where I’ve magicked the lawn. Just in this enclosed area, the lawn never needs cutting and won’t show any wear. It’s also permanently cushioned so kids can’t hurt themselves with a fall, but not so much that you notice it. It only really activates when a kid falls off the swing or something.”
“Oh dear. One moment . . . . . very good you’re all fitted. Come back any time after 16:00 today and they will be ready.”
How about tomorrow. Harpies pitch. 11:AM. I’ll consider it a test run. Actually you can put it through the paces and tell me what you think. I’ll call it an official assessment and evaluation. Go ahead do your acrobatics.
“Let’s do a hot cider stand in the park on Sundays in October. . . .hot chocolate in the winter. Mr. Trandy and Hannah will help I’m sure.”
“Hi. . . . . .Cartavio Black for Him and a Nikka straight up for me please. . . . . Did you want something different or do you want the duck? Please say you want the duck.”
Oh, everyone thinks they looked fantastic! I just wonder if he’d do it again or if it was a one time thing.
SM: Auntie Luna, you know all this but for the purpose of your interview we’ll talk about it. Al is a bearer.
I’ll take Hugo on the boat sometime soon enough . . . . Third. . . There’s a park opening tomorrow and I want to see it. Hugo has fireworks and we’re going to set them off from the centre fountain tomorrow night. . . . Fourth. . . There’s a conservatory FULL of plants. I mean there’s a LOT of plants, Harry go out there and take a look. They’re beautiful. . . . Fifth. Thank you Andi. You’ll never know how thankful I am for this day. . . . Thank you Minister for taking care of HIM . . . . I don’t have any desire to revisit this after today, but I don’t want my memory messed with either. . . . Finally. I am TIRED. Exhausted really. I want Hugo to take me to bed and I want to wake up in the morning and make blueberry pancakes with Mrs. Brick.”
“Now we’ll bring that theme through the living room. The window coverings will go away. We’ll have a privacy charm put on all of the windows throughout the house. You don’t like these curtains do you?”
Dud and Lucy should be here any minute. Dinner in Diagon? Cardamom? We can take them there. I’m officially allowed now.
Tomorrow we switch. You’re making sandwiches and help prep, I’m doing the fish and chips. Ruby and Zebb will back up with the rest?
And by supervise, you mean you’ll sit on the porch with Scorp and watch the landscaping team mow the lawn. Then Mr. Trandy will arrive with lunch?
Please do not allow staff to make any alterations other than necessary cleaning until we have been to the lodge. Also please advise if the lodge is habitable. If not, the request for staffing would be moot.
I’ll sit down with Zebb and come up with a list of positions. I hope that will be helpful. She will choose the manager for Grimmauld and will have final say.
Woah. They’re pulling out all the stops here. Who knew you could cook a seafood paella on a freaking campfire! This is incredible.
“I’m okay with that! This place takes on a whole different life when there are people in it like this. Let them have fun. I’m just glad to see everyone with a smile on. I was so afraid this was going to be a total disaster.”
AND IT’S A TIE BETWEEN TEAM COTTAGE AND THE SURFER BOYS! THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE EPIC BATTLE OF THE BLANKET FORTS!
Yes. He also says he’ll allow for a short interview. We may as well have some fun with this, Scarhead. Let Ginny have her pound of flesh.
No it’s actually pretty cool. The outside is just darker than the rest of our places. It almost looks like a vintage hotel or something. Doesn’t look out of place actually if you look at it as the anchor or core to the complex. Looks like it belongs, still a bit of a shock though!
“Yes do that. We’ll call you back after we’ve moved it and done the charms. If this works we’ll take your portrait back to the manor.”
“They breed them at the manor. Eurasian Eagle owls. They’re big. They look mean but they’re actually really gentle. Not friendly like Mr. Jordan, but still really nice. They really love delivering packages. I mean they really love doing it.”
So here’s a link to their trip with the dates of where they are and when. You can put a comment on the wizgram photos but Jerry set it up so they cannot respond. They can only put up the photos.
Don’t take up all of his time he’s my official date for the party and he’s helping Uncle Harry and Al in the kitchen.
“There’s plenty of that too unfortunately, but I’ve had Sean send out notice that there will be no press conference or comments today.”
“You are correct, they will find it humorous. You have no previous driving violations. It is doubtful that you will be sent to prison for a questionable quaff.”
Yeah, I’m kidding about the lime green. But they are repainting the whole place and Jerry is doing the front. Even Zebbs’ cottage is getting a makeover.
Have Mr. Maeda unload the tanks from the truck and place them just inside the courtyard. I’ll act as lookout. When he goes back to the truck you float the tank to the conservatory. We do that in tandem until the truck is empty. Then I can bring him through the back door and around. What about the tanks when they’re empty?
Yes, I’ve got the papers already. You guys, that whole floor is again mostly charms and wand work. There’s no actual construction going on there. It’s all warpaint and makeup. I just need to do a walkthrough with you guys. I swear there’s nothing much to do there. Dean and I will team up and we can knock that whole floor out in a day. It’s just paint, paper and woodwork cleanup. You want the wood lightened and cleaned right? Including the floors?
A party to celebrate the upcoming marriage of his brother would also be called a “Stag Do” here and usually quite unruly. Not the same there? We understand and will accommodate. Should we bring in more staff?
Draco ground his hips, a heavy, delicious weight on Harry’s lap. ‘Do you like this, husband?’ Draco asked, a sly smile on his face as he tortured Harry with hypnotically slow rolls. ‘I wanked so much last night thinking of this.’ He leaned close to Harry’s ear, still keeping the maddening pace. ‘I wanked myself
‘Your kind’s always so impatient,’ Draco said, which Harry’s fogged brain dismissed until days later.
Hello, friends. After a busy start to the year and after quarantine ruined my concentration, I finally managed to get my writing mojo back and make some progress. I owe a thousand thanks to
A crack echoed in the room and the man’s left arm bent at an unnatural angle. He shoved to his feet, eyes wild around the room, when his other arm broke with a snap. Harry, his heart thumping so loud that it was all he could hear, aimed the wand at the man’s left leg.
Esther was twenty-two when she was sent to the death camps. She’d been dragged from her home in Thessaloniki, forced to board a train with thousands of others and taken to the cold north. She was strong and knew how to sew well, and perhaps those facts saved her. Perhaps it was simply luck. ‘Death rolls dice with people’s lives,’ she said. Her brothers, her father, and her fiancé died. ‘The males of my family never live long.’ Halfway through the story, describing the gas chambers and the starvation, tears glistened in her eyes.
He probably doesn’t know what that promise does to Harry, or maybe he does, because Harry’s cock twitches and the movement draws Malfoy’s eyes, his face taking on a ravenous expression. He sinks down and takes all of Harry in his mouth. Harry gasps and arches his back. Malfoy’s tongue swipes around the head, laps at the slit and licks the underside of Harry’s cock. For good measure Malfoy looks up at Harry with a wicked smile and runs his teeth gently along Harry’s cock before he sucks him once more.
. I grow weary, Anton. I grow impatient at your delays. Rookwood doesn’t heed any Summons, and you return to me with empty hands but for these Muggle toys. You’re as much a disgrace as Lucius.’
Returning with the tea, he tells Nariyoshi to go back to bed. ‘We don’t need to call a taxi for another hour.’
The wooden structure had escaped the menace that had consumed the main house. It sat in the midst of a sea of knee-high grass dotted with poppies and wild violets, and smelled, reassuringly and defiantly, of life: warm-blooded animals, a faint trace of manure, pollen. A wood of silver birches and ash trees lay behind the barn, alive with birdsong.
Draco laughed with delight. He hovered over Harry and nibbled at his neck and his chest, his tongue swirling around a peaked nipple. His nibbling turned sharper, a shade under painful, but Harry didn’t mind, delirious in his need and helplessly drowning in lust.
He wasn’t the first to wonder. Students of all years came up to Draco to ask him about the Mirror world. That Gryffindor boy—Creepey or Creevey or something—had burst into tears at Draco’s assurance that his brother still annoyed people with his camera in the Mirror world.
Cam sighed. He sat heavily on the steps and pulled the little girl to him. ‘Aye, I know. Can’t be too careful, though, can you?’
‘We don’t get on,’ Draco says, pulling his mouth from Potter’s and kissing his jaw. He grabs Potter’s glasses and throws them behind him on the table before he resumes kissing him, so deep it feels like he’s devouring Potter’s face. ‘We’ll fuck this up.’
Draco cast a few simple spells at inanimate objects. Stones rose high in the air, soared out of the open doors and returned. They hesitated to turn the wand on themselves in case it malfunctioned and they lost or gained a limb, but it performed every single task wonderfully. The crack on its side had disappeared; the wand was indeed mending itself. Neither could explain it, but Harry shrugged and accepted it. If nothing else, it was a gift.
Draco feels as if he’s back at the round table, holding a hand of cards, certain he’ll win the game, only for Mrs Li to throw down an ace.
He wouldn’t be the first man to marry a woman he doesn’t love, and Harry wouldn’t mind if it weren’t for the certainty they no longer wished for the same things. They’d both been ambitious before the war, wanting to go to the city and make a name for themselves. Ginny’s training to be a professional golfer. She downplays her achievements in her letters, not out of false modesty, but probably to avoid sounding conceited when he’s been stuck in a hospital for six months.
That night, Harry can’t sleep. He gives up the attempt and limps to the common room, silent and dark in the night. Discarded packets of cards lie on tables along with folded newspapers and someone’s unfinished chess game. Harry sees a figure in an armchair, lit by the pale moonlight streaming through the bay windows.
‘That they’d wish for Voldemort to come to power? Your parents took risks in trying to ensure your safety in the Battle, disregarding Voldemort’s orders and desires. Now, if Bellatrix were alive—’
‘I wouldn’t have to come in here if you had any idea how to dress like a Muggle,’ Harry whispered back. He grabbed Malfoy’s selection from his hands and rummaged through it. A pair of pale jeans and a white T-shirt presented the only possibilities, so he shoved them in Malfoy’s hands.
The families ate, conversed or bustled around the camp — but underneath the easy conversations and the jokes and the children’s laughter, the sour tang of anxiety poisoned the air. The smiles vanished a second too fast, replaced by worry; glances darted towards the woods; heads snapped round when any noise came from outside. Two women with wands patrolled the camp, checking the wards as they went. A group of young men chatted with Cam, heads close together, shooting glances towards the direction of the village.
They rode in silence amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. ‘I had no idea you had an interest in pottery,’ Harry said.
Draco pulled Harry close. ‘There are some creatures we don’t learn about at school, but all wizards know about them. If you’d asked your friend Weasley, he’d tell you. There’s another type of faeries, older and more dangerous, usually found in the woods of Devon and Cornwall and Ireland.’ He lowered his voice so much that to be heard he had to talk in Harry’s ear. His breath tickled Harry and a shiver ran up Harry's spine. Draco's lips almost brushed his skin as he spoke. ‘Very few of them are left now. If they like you, they will shower riches upon you. They are fond of children, the elderly, and musicians. But they also delight in luring people away from their loved ones, or making them insane, just for their amusement. This is such a forest. That’s why Dawn leaves milk and honey on the fence. To appease them.’ He drew back and levelled a flat stare at Harry. ‘I know you’ll hate me for saying this but: this is part of pureblood culture. We all know these things.’
, Lucius. You’re mistaken if you think I’ll allow you to leave this residence again. I’ll let you keep your lives, which is more than you deserve.’
When he realises that, light seeps in, as if through cracks on the walls, and he can see. With light comes memory: he remembers Uncle Vernon locking him in. Harry hears himself say, ‘I didn’t mean to change the colour of my teacher’s wig!’
Their train arrived, and they grabbed a table seat, facing each other. Draco dropped the rucksack next to him and leaned back as the conductor slammed the doors shut and whistled. Harry observed Draco as he settled and took in their surroundings, the blue threadbare fabric, the few passengers, the notices about not putting one’s feet on the seat. The affection Harry had felt earlier lingered; a secret nestling under his skin, blooming with warmth each time he gazed at Draco. They might have to part ways soon, and Harry didn’t know if he could bear knowing Draco was out there, where anything could happen to him. Where Harry couldn’t see him or touch him.
Dawn saw them off. She pointed at a new direction through the woods. ‘Got any iron with you? Good. Now, go straight through here and in a mile or two you’ll see a road. There’ll be a sign for St Cleer. It’s the nearest village. By the time you get there, the first trains will be running. You’ll need to change in Falmouth and take a bus to Cadgwith. Got all that?’
‘That’s true,’ Harry said, placatingly, while Justin and Ron made noises of agreement with Dean, ‘but… ’
The next morning, Draco kept his eyes shut, trying to hold on to what had been the best dream he’d ever had. He wasn’t ready for the disappointment of waking up to his real life.
‘Draco!’ Nariyoshi says. ‘Look who’s here!’ He beams, assuming the surprise is a pleasant one to Draco, who freezes on the doorway.
As if Draco had heard him, he spread his legs under the table, resting them against Harry’s. He seemed unaware of it; this absent-minded desire to stay connected to Harry in some small way. Harry’s heart fluttered, a small trilling bird.
‘Look,’ Sue says, ‘if you really don’t want to have sex with him, then don’t. But find a way to make him trust you enough to let you have access to the figurine.’
Draco nudged him back, Harry retaliated and soon he found himself holding Draco’s arm, his face close to his husband’s. Draco’s breath fell on Harry’s cheek and Harry, heart beating, leaned in to kiss him. To his surprise, Draco kissed back. The kiss was lovely, making Harry’s veins tingle with gentle anticipation, but the taste of cheese and wine on Draco’s lips reminded Harry of Salazar. They broke away and sat back, the ice between them having thawed. Perhaps there was hope for them still.
Harry had almost finished fixing a pipe in the downstairs loo late that afternoon (gaining a newfound respect for plumbers in the process) when Draco called him. Music drifted from the radio in the kitchen where Esther and Dawn were cooking a particularly fragrant roast; homely, comforting sounds and smells. Harry debated ignoring him, but Draco called him again, more urgently.
Somewhere Voldemort was looking for wandmakers to threaten for information about his wand. Somewhere Narcissa Malfoy stared at the sky, waiting for the owl to return, fearful for her life over this betrayal. Somewhere in Hogwarts Harry’s friends were fighting a cruel system. Somewhere Ron and Hermione waited for a scrap of news about him. And in Tinworth Dolohov waited for a sign of them. Heart beating fast with anticipation, Harry marched down the path with Draco by his side, heading straight to give it to him.
‘Because that’s what you do. You’re the Saviour.’ Instead of taunting, his voice came out in a whisper.
,’ he spat, a flash of fury in his voice, quickly suppressed. ‘The Dark Lord shattered the impression I’d always had of my “majestic” father.’ He glanced at Harry. ‘I don’t admire the Dark Lord, but when you’re in his presence, you can feel it, can’t you? The power? Like a magnet sucking you in?’
Watching Pansy and Weasley greet each other so effusively stretched Draco’s suspension of disbelief to breaking point. Their camaraderie was hard to swallow for no other reason than he’d always assumed it was impossible. Too much bad blood separated the two factions.
Harry feels as if he stands on a cliff, about to jump. He knows what Draco’s asking. He knows what the dangers are, knows he’ll possibly hurt Ginny, but not even an army could stop him from getting in the car.
Harry gasped, his back arching clear off the floor with rapture, and came blindly, thick ropes of come landing on his stomach and his chest; an orgasm that stole his breath from him, leaving him gasping. Draco had resumed his fucking with his mouth still clasped on Harry’s neck, his hips erratic and unsteady. Bliss coursed inside Harry’s veins spreading from the bite to his very core as if his blood was being replaced with honey and golden euphoria. Finally, Draco unlatched his lips, red with blood, and grunted, and came, flooding Harry’s arse with his come. He flopped on Harry, and Harry wrapped his arms around him, laid his head down, and promptly lost consciousness.
The man in the trilby gazed at Harry. ‘Undesirable number one,’ he murmured. ‘The Ministry,’ he called to everyone, ‘will fall over themselves to lay hands on him. The reward could set us up for
He turns left on the twisting side road, under an arch, and then right. The casino’s wards flash neon-bright as he steps through and knocks on the door. He now knows how useless his glamour was. These wards can see through glamours and Polyjuice, Disillusionment and Invisibility Cloaks. No one can hide from the Lis, while they remain hidden from the sight of everyone, except from their clients and those invited by them.
Not that Harry cared. The whole kingdom watching wouldn’t stop him. Draco was removing his breeches, and that was the only thing worthy of Harry’s attention at that moment: Draco’s long, pink cock, rising hard and beautiful from a nest of golden curls. Harry positively drooled. In a hurry, he kicked off his own garments and fell on Draco, pushing him on the grass.
He chided himself. Draco didn’t belong on a pirate ship. He was a man born for fancy clothes and ornate rooms. A man for state dinners and a stack of official documents to sign.
The man chuckled, eyes fixed on Draco’s. ‘You seem so sure of yourself. No one will find you here. You’ll be here for days,
Draco offered to buy tea from the little shop on the platform. Harry handed him a handful of change, which Draco rifled through, picking each coin up and examining it. ‘Is this the most precious one?’ He held a fifty-pence.
felt, and he loathed himself for it, because it was nothing less than selfish to think this way. Harry wasn’t supposed to be anything other than a weapon of destruction; a soldier on a mission.
‘Like a black hole,’ Harry murmured. Draco frowned, but he didn’t ask for clarification, which was fortunate because Harry wasn’t up to discussing deep space. The reminder of his visions brought goosebumps to Harry’s arms. ‘Let’s talk about something else.’
Harry let out a silent, long exhale. Draco’s fingers found his; they held tight. He trembled and Harry clutched his hand harder, but it wasn’t only Draco who shook. A wave of dizziness came over Harry, the ebb of adrenaline mixing with the rush of relief; he wasn’t sure his legs would hold him when he clambered down. He leaned his forehead on a branch, a leaf tickling his nose, and waited.
Changing the subject helped distract him. ‘When in doubt, blame the French,’ Draco quipped and Pansy laughed. They spent a pleasant half an hour, discussing Blaise and any acting talent he might have concealed from them. Pansy took care to avoid mentioning any names that might upset Draco. Until the end.
Harry’s pulse spiked. He fumbled, fingers clumsy again, and the man huffed a soft laugh against his skin and moved to the front. ‘Let me,’ he said again, and Harry could do nothing but nod.
Harry should leave and go to bed and get his heartbeat under control. ‘Do you want me to do your palm?’ he said instead.
Malfoy cupped his hand and stretched it outside, gathering rain water. He washed the wound on his shoulder, then he started on his face. He tried to extract what must have been tiny pieces of glass from the shattered chandelier, but without a mirror his job was hard. Harry could have helped him. He didn’t want to. The sight of the unconscious, tormented Hermione, too fresh in his memory, caused only uncharitable resentment. So he watched him instead, what little he could discern in the dark. Draco’s movements were careful and delicate. Neither of them spoke; not Malfoy cleaning his wounds, nor Harry watching him.
He’s not sure how this is happening, this easy-going chattiness with someone he hasn’t seen in years, someone who stood on the opposite side of a battlefield not that long ago. Or perhaps five years
‘No,’ Draco said, keeping his voice icy and his pride intact, ‘I want to write horoscopes. It’s my dream come true.’
He speaks lightly, making a joke of a frustrating time of his life, and Malfoy chuckles. ‘Who knew vanquishing Dark Lords isn’t an employable skill?’
the curly-haired boy yelled, but the short one threw the comic to one of his friends, who grabbed it, laughing, then tossed it to another of their group.
you’ve offered to me.’ He bows low to Draco — the highest honour a master can bestow to their apprentice — which leaves Draco stunned.
Draco hasn’t realised he’s spoken until they stop and stare at him, shocked at the vitriol in his tone. He clears his throat, feeling Potter’s eyes on him. ‘I was merely suggesting, dear Longbottom, that it’s species-ist to attribute such negative characteristics to a Creature without proper knowledge of what they are actually like. Am I wrong, Granger?’
‘Well, then.’ Draco stands. ‘Get dressed, chop chop. We’re going.’ Cancelling the night light spell, he leaves Harry to help Nariyoshi get ready, while he goes to argue with the doctors about an early discharge.
Blind with increasing pain, he took a step back and another, and his legs knocked on the bed just as Voldemort’s rage sucked him in.
They caught their breaths lying on their backs, Harry’s hand on Draco’s. He took off his T-shirt and wiped the come off his skin. He turned to Draco, who gazed at him with dark eyes, and cleaned him too.
A few minutes later, a slender woman with spiky hair leads him to the office he visited last time. Mrs Li sits at the desk, Sue standing beside her. The spiked-haired woman shuts the door behind him. Draco steps into the room. The game has started.
She turned to him, surprised at the urgency in his voice. ‘Nothing. I see only me. Draco, what is it? You’re scaring me.’
Taking advantage of Draco’s distraction, Harry rolls them on bed and pushes Draco on the sheets. He pins him down and leans over his startled face. ‘Well, I have a lot to give.’
Draco stared at his reflection and thought of everyone he was leaving behind and his heart broke into a thousand, piercing shards. The idea he’d leave behind the life he’d had here caused him acute physical pain, and his stomach rolled, nausea filling him and cold sweat running down his back.
By the time Draco’s done, mid-morning has come and gone. The lift takes him to Level Nine and the gleaming door that hides the world’s mysteries — including that notorious figurine.
Draco tilted his head, gazing at Harry with hooded eyes, his expression shifting. He let a moment pass before he muttered, voice pitched low: ‘Wanted to be you, now they want to
Perhaps he’s getting immune. Draco hopes that’s the case. There’s so little lore about his kind. His mind strays to Aveline, his ancestor. The possible Succubus. She remained married to her husband for years; gave him nine children. She must have been able to live with him and not harm him.
. He hasn’t even touched himself, but he’s leaking pre-come, his balls aching. He rubs himself, shutting his eyes as his orgasm crests.
But tonight, before he jerks awake, drenched in sweat like always, the dream changes. It’s as if a window has opened in a stuffy room, letting in a breeze that dispels the forest like mist.
Draco gave him an unfathomable look and shut the door behind him. Harry opened the window, letting the wind cool his clammy face. He didn’t need sleep after his visions — in fact he dreaded it, because it’d be easier to slip into another one. What he needed were strong sensations to ground him to his body. Harry leaned outside the window, the wind lashing at his hair, whipping it back from his face. The rustling of the trees sounded like sea waves if he closed his eyes. He filled his lungs with the smell of spring, buds and grass and pollen, and he mulled over the news.
‘I love it,’ Draco said, realising he wasn’t exactly lying. Sure, his vanity would prefer it if he wrote the kind of incisive articles that Granger, Padma Patil and Goldstein wrote, articles about how the Dark Lord’s coup had split their society in two and suggestions as to how to mend it, but the horoscopes turned out to be creative and fun. Besides, he was still tickled by how many people—Libras presumably—sported flower crowns last month.
and Harry pumps his fingers in faster, harder, deeper. He crawls over Draco, keeping his fingers inside his luscious arse, and stares at the wild, pained expression on Draco’s face as he’s about to come.
‘They’re also said to banish evil spirits when planted in the perimeter of a house.’ An edge of anger peeked under Draco’s words, the tip of a blade that was barely held back. ‘Planting needs to take place late at night during the waning of the moon — we’re lucky there. That’s what
Dolohov swept imperious eyes over the man and replied with cold contempt, but Harry stopped paying attention. The witch had wandered over to the swings and slipped among the trees. If she looked up, she’d see them. Draco’s face had turned the colour of ash; he’d stopped breathing, his body rigid with tension. Harry held his breath, his mind whirring with defense ideas, all useless against a wand.
‘I had the sun in my eyes, as you well know,’ Potter objected, but paused and worried his lip. ‘Can you not remember?’
They leaned close, their knees knocking together and their heads bumping. Draco held the wand between them, and Harry turned it gently to the side. ‘I was sure I saw it.’ They rolled the wand a few times and peered carefully, but no flash of white peeked from inside. ‘This is strange,’ Harry said. ‘I’d have sworn—’
. His hands roved down Draco’s slick back and cupped his arse, which flexed with the effort of grinding against Harry. The bliss swelling inside Harry was an intoxicating potion, as heady and irresistible as the most potent drug. The room filled with their moans and grunts, and finally riding the crest of his climax, Harry came all over their stomachs, his body quivering from the force of it. Draco rose and fisted his cock, and Harry watched avidly, as long pearly ropes of Draco’s spunk rained on him.
‘This’ll do.’ Harry set the rucksack down by the entrance. The space must have been abandoned for some time. Cobwebs hung thick in the corners, and dust covered the ground. A rickety wooden ladder led to a small loft on their left.
‘I was advised early on by one of my tutors to never allow my parents to catch me at it. Right, where was I?’
Hermione gave him a peck on the cheek. ‘Take it easy, okay? I’m going to find where my boyfriend has gone to. See you later.’
Harry stopped and indicated he should go first. ‘Arse,’ Malfoy muttered as he passed in front of him. Harry resisted the urge to punch him.
‘I came into the Lestrange inheritance,’ Draco said quietly. ‘Besides, it was cheap as dirt to buy it. Fixing it is another matter, though.’ It’d seemed appropriate to Draco to spend his aunt’s money on creating a magical sanctuary. A haven for the lost and the broken. Reading up on the magic required for such an endeavour provided a welcome distraction to his heartache, which had failed to be diminished these last couple of weeks.
Draco said, ‘I do. I just— it’s selfish maybe, but I can’t help thinking that I might be next. In four days even. We won’t be here forever.’
She gave him a small smile. ‘Well, it was a dream world, wasn’t it? Blaise with the Muggles, I ask you! He can't stand them.’
The short wizard flushed. ‘Might be a sight more useful than your Anti-Apparition. Are you sure you covered the whole village? I remember you mumbling when you cast it.’
, a ridiculous name for such a priceless, ancient object; and yet that’s the only way Draco can think of her now. ‘Why Harry?’ he murmurs.
‘Not at all. Commandeer anything you want.’ Harry’s voice comes out flirtatious and he coughs to clear it. ‘So, er, do you like art?’
‘Well, they were following my scent, but I was wearing a bunch of clothes from different people. Even if the clothes had been washed, some scent of the human remained; also maybe people handled them at the shop. All the different human scents confuse the hounds.’ Draco threw a pebble in the gurgling stream. ‘If I’d been wearing my robes, they’d have managed to find me more easily, I believe. Those second hand clothes saved us.’
‘I’m glad he only has four limbs,’ Draco quipped after the final snap echoed in the room, and Harry, his heart roaring in black fury, Stunned the kidnapper, tied him, gagged him, and finally turned to Draco, gulping deep breaths.
The next time Draco’s hand travelled over the waistband of his bottoms, Harry let his legs fall open. As imperceptibly as possible — but Draco inhaled sharply and Harry knew he’d noticed. Harry squirmed “sleepily”, his head settling against Draco’s shoulder, his pelvis flat on the bed, an open invitation. He remained there, hoping Draco would understand what he’d meant:
Malfoy looked sick, but not particularly surprised. Harry rose to his feet. ‘He Crucioed your parents. You can imagine what that was like.’
‘Excuse me.’ The woman’s head lifted slowly and stared at Malfoy, who drawled more imperiously than ever. ‘I was wondering if you could be of assistance.’
The derelict stone farmhouse smelled of animals and dust, and half of the front wall had collapsed, but it had a roof and the floor was dry. It’d have to do. He sat heavily in a corner as far from Malfoy as he could.
And then it’s quiet. Peering through the cracks, he sees the house empty. Dust carpets the floor, sheets cover the furniture, and the windows are grimy. They’ve left and abandoned him there. They’ve forgotten him. Now, there’s no one to let him out and he’ll be stuck there, forever. He bangs frantically on the door, shouts until his voice is hoarse. ‘OPEN UP!’ He doesn’t want to die in the cupboard all alone, he doesn’t want to spend the rest of his time in darkness, but they’ve
It’s not an insult. The way Draco says it, the quiet ache in his voice, his pinched expression… it sounds almost like he’s hurting.
They didn’t speak much after that. Harry started feeling drowsy, the soft patter of the rain calming his heartbeats, soothing his burning mind; sleep started creeping in. Harry would have to think of a plan, how to get himself out of this situation. But first, with a last look at Malfoy’s curled, silent figure, he lay on the hard floor and let sleep take him.
‘I need to find Ron and Hermione.’ Saying their names aloud brought to the surface all the worry Harry’d been suppressing. He’d dearly hoped they were safe. ‘We have… somewhere to go.’ Draco nodded. He looked a lot more miserable than a moment ago, and it pained Harry to see him like this. He took a step closer, stretched his hand. ‘Which is why I think you—’
Draco leaned over the device. ‘We’re off to France now, but we wanted to stop and say hi.’ To Harry’s questioning frown, he whispered, ‘Throw him off the scent. Make him go look for us in France.’
! Chilly fingers wrapped around his heart at the thought that Draco might be fishing for information, but he shook the thought off. There was constant vigilance, and there was paranoia.
Harry’s skin tingled with how weird this was, and his temper evaporated, leaving behind an intense awkwardness.
At Harry’s insistence, they went over the plan a few times. ‘Can we trust the wand to work?’ he asked.
Longbottom turns redder than Weasley, a true beetroot red, and Draco laughs. ‘I was kidding, I’m sorry.’ He shrugs. ‘My mind’s all Potter, I’m afraid.’
Harry had frozen when the light illuminated the man’s face: fair as the dawn and cruel as the sea. Sudden, lightning-fast attraction to men he kidnapped was the worst of bad ideas. He faked a chuckle to give himself a minute to recover; then slowly clapped, his eyes never leaving the man’s face. ‘Well done, Draco Malfoy. You got me. Which means you know what happens to my prizes when the ransom isn’t paid. You’re right; I don’t kill my hostages nor sell them for slaves.’
Malfoy’s eyes widened as the couple on the screen started necking pretty heavily. ‘Are these real people going about their business and we can see what they’re doing? Is it the same way you can see the Dark Lord’s mind?’
. Super helpful, wouldn’t have thought of it myself.’ Draco flicks his wand, murmuring a spell his mother used to cast for him before bedtime. The spell tints the air with shades of blue that change from violet to turquoise depending on the temperature of the air currents. In high-ceilinged rooms, like his bedroom at the Manor, there were a dozen hues, shimmering and shifting from the slightest draught from the windows or the heat from the fire. Here the effect isn’t as impressive, but it’s pretty. It’s like they’re floating in an iridescent violet sky with veins of blue running into it. Harry adds a
, Harry fumbled with the fiddly laces of Draco’s tunic and almost tore it as he dragged it off him. From the corner of his eye he could see their guards hovering nearby. At least they’d had the presence of mind to turn their backs to the royal couple and form a screen to shield them from view of anyone passing from the road nearby.
Harry’s never had a conversation like this before — with Anthony they’d politely chatted about work and the Quidditch league before exchanging a sweet goodnight kiss. With Malfoy, every word, every glance, every gesture is charged with electricity.
Harry didn’t pursue the subject any more; an argument required more energy than he had to spare at the moment. Still, he marvelled at Malfoy’s insistence on distancing himself from the Master he so eagerly agreed to serve two years ago. They stayed silent for a while, both glaring at the sky as if it was its fault they were helpless.
But that wasn’t what happened. Harry rose on an elbow and, with a finger, turned Draco’s face towards him. ‘The fact that you regret it so much that it’s your
Perhaps there wasn’t one Malfoy, but many: the arrogant twat, the bigot, the coddled toff, but also the old lady befriender, the doubter of blood purism, the bizarre bouquet maker.
Malfoy’s uncomprehending look reminds Harry that he doesn’t know about his Muggle upbringing, so he explains, while Malfoy’s face clouds over. Harry’s voice is casual. It’s easy for him to talk about it in the light of day.
‘Is it true? Did the Nazi,’ Draco pronounced the word carefully, ‘kill all those people and hold her prisoner?’
Draco’s hair is fanned on the pillow, his eyes cautious. Harry’s heart clenches with the desire to say everything he’s wanted to all this time. He wants everything out in the open, he wants to make Draco
Magic alone, of course, wouldn’t suffice. While the Slytherdom’s navy was a force to be reckoned with, they didn’t have the numbers to resist Riddle. They needed Gryffenland just as much as Gryffenland needed them.
Draco dug under his jumper, pulled his wand from the waistband of his jeans, and twirled it into his fingers. He favoured his right hand, keeping his left side stiff. ‘Shame. This was a good wand. I liked it.’
Esther’s hand clutched her cane hard, her eyes shining. Her voice, when she eventually replied, carried infinite sorrow. ‘That’s what they did, the Nazis. They didn’t give you a good choice. Either way someone had to die.’
‘Well, you’ll pardon me if I don’t think you’re sexy,’ Longbottom says, and Weasley pipes in, ‘Give it another pint, mate.’
‘Take off your clothes,’ was the first thing Harry said that night. His voice sounded gruff, as if he hadn’t used it in years.
Harry laughs again. Draco leans in, wanting to catch the laugh with his mouth, and Harry responds, his lips sweet on Draco’s. Draco has no idea how things came to be what they are — he suspects he has to thank Mrs Li for it — but he knows that the man he holds in his arms has saved him, again. And perhaps Draco has saved him back, a little. Perhaps they both found a way to mend each other’s broken pieces.
A faint blush spread on Draco’s face, a hint of a smile. He moved to the door. ‘Let’s see what the schedule is for today.’
‘You’re awfully quiet,’ Draco said. He sat up and touched Harry’s face. ‘I’ll miss being on the ship, too,’ he said, as if he’d read Harry’s thoughts.
‘All right then.’ She stalks to a concealed window, flinging it open, and whistles. An owl lands on the sill, blinking slowly. ‘You can use her to send it to the hospital now. It works immediately. Write a note to the Healers to confirm the recovery. Bao will fly back with the note, you can give us the figurine, and this whole sorry affair will be over.’
The selfish part of Harry rejoiced the fact he wouldn’t carry on alone just yet. That he’d have Draco at his side, like now. They were both leaning against the stone fence, looking at each other.
For all their poise and arrogance, for all their vanity and talk of great deeds, the Malfoys scurried out of the room in an undignified haste, and Voldemort would laugh at their blatant cowardice if he hadn’t been simmering with rage and frustration. He paced past the shattered chandelier until Rookwood and Dolohov came and kneeled at his feet.
But it was becoming one, especially at moments like this. Sharing a bed brought forth a whole new set of reactions in Harry’s body that he wasn’t sure he wanted to deal with. Recalling their past enmity didn’t help, because Draco in sleep wasn’t Draco Malfoy: he was just a boy. He looked almost like a new person as if sleep erased his identity, leaving behind only a young man, long-limbed and slender; a man who breathed steadily and occasionally snored; a man who curled into himself at night. Everything that made him
Harry laughs. It’s a sound that Draco has come to love with an intensity that scares him. He’ll do anything to hear the laugh again, to see Harry’s face in a grin, his eyes bright with joy. ‘Did I tell you Nariyoshi’s planning to write a novel featuring “real elves”? He wants to interview your house-elf.’
Draco mulled it over. ‘Their technology, I suppose. They’re very inventive, aren’t they? The Muggles. I mean, they have to be. To make do without magic.’
In the hospital, they meet coming in and out of the bathroom, in the dining room, in the common room. The man always stays by himself. He’s almost invisible to the others, unnoticed even by Harry, until he’d spoken to him by the lake. Harry doesn’t approach him in the hospital. He likes the afternoons by the water when it’s just the two of them. He wants to have something to look forward to.
‘What a coincidence. I’m heading there myself. We have a residence in Devon, right by the sea. A cottage really.’ His eyes bore on Harry’s, intent and serious. ‘Want to come with me?’
Hermione looked at their clasped hands and dropped his hand as if it burned. In a strained voice, she talked to her shoulder, or rather to the round, black earring she had on one ear: ‘Harry, I found him. Meet you at the entrance.’ She jogged down the steps, gesturing to him to follow her.
Taking off his shirt and pushing down his breeches, Draco offered Harry a smirk, one of those tantalising things that Harry would miss quite terribly. ‘Care to fuck the governor, Captain?’
Sue’s expression loses her mirth. ‘Let’s cut the dragonshit, shall we? We know everything, Draco — including the illness of your Muggle employer, which drove you to seek quick funds. We know you have no way in hell of raising the money you owe us, which means in a week’s time we’ll have to make an
‘What a shame,’ Esther exclaimed, clasping her hands. ‘You missed Ben, my grandson, by a couple of hours. He lives in Falmouth, only a short drive from Cadgwith, and could have given you a lift.’
Harry stood still, unsure how to respond, knowing it’d be suspicious if they declined, but Draco spoke first, his voice flat.
Draco stumbles into the nearest chair, naked and sweaty and reeking of sex, his mind a storm of emotions, his veins full of power, his cock slick. Potter’s lying on the table, legs akimbo, taking shallow breaths.
Voldemort made the world a darker place. Harry hated the visions, because being in Voldemort’s head, he sensed the void inside him: a black hole that swallowed everything that was light and sweet and kind. Sharing Voldemort’s mind terrified Harry for he feared one day the black hole would devour him, too; gobble him up and spit out a hollow shell.
once.’ He didn’t know what made him say it, and regretted it when Draco lifted his head, looking frightened.
Draco sits, removing his apparently useless glamour with a word. Sue’s chatty, friendly, and prattles on about the classes they’d shared and the friends they had in common. Draco doesn’t let his guard down one inch.
Draco also experienced the unfamiliar but rather delightful sensation of being loved, not just by Harry, but by the whole school. Sure, he’d been popular in Slytherin, but the levels of adoration he enjoyed now reached soaring heights. Deep down, he knew he didn’t deserve any praise; but as the days passed, the real world became distant.
Romania was a wild place, exuberant with secrets and magic. Harry’s team, tasked to find a stolen heirloom, had come up against obstacles they hadn’t anticipated. The darkness in the Romanian forests was a living thing, swallowing them whole. His team disappeared, one by one—missing or taken, Harry couldn’t now. Their equipment didn’t work; the compass failed. Even the stars couldn’t help him, shrouded as they were in thick clouds. Exhausted and starved, reeling with his failure, lost in the wilderness, Harry trudged on amidst trees grown feral. The skies had unleashed a storm an hour ago, which hadn’t abated.
Malfoy had already gobbled his own. He bit his bottom lip, glanced at Harry’s plate, then at Harry. ‘It’s fine. You should eat them.’
.’ He accompanies his words with a sinuous roll of his hips, setting Harry’s nerves alight. ‘I can make you writhe, and whimper, and come five times in a row while I suck the life out of you. Is that what you want, sweetheart?’
When the conversation seemed to be done, Harry retreated to the kitchen as if he’d been there the whole time, ignoring Dawn’s raised eyebrow, his chest constricted. At the sound of Draco’s steps, he walked to the hallway, trying to look casual. Draco’s face was blotched, eyes red-rimmed and puffy. He breathed heavily. He paused when he saw Harry, his face rippling with some emotion Harry could only guess at, and then Draco flung open the door of the mothball-smelling coat cupboard and dragged him inside.
‘They’re around here somewhere,’ said a gruff voice, when the vicious barks and the footsteps reached the edge of the water.
‘We saved you some breakfast, Draco.’ Esther interrupted their effort to have the last word. Malfoy took the mug that Dawn offered and poured some tea before sitting opposite Harry.
A hunched figure at the corner flinched. Harry hadn’t noticed Malfoy Senior in the shadows, and he was startled at his haggard appearance, the deep lines in his face.
The door clicks behind Harry and creaks open. He stares at the dim corridor. ‘I don’t want to be in this house.’ He hates that he sounds like a baby — why does Malfoy have to see him at his weak moments? — and he hates the tears that fall hot on his cheeks.
A caress on his face drew Harry out of his thoughts. A brush of a feather or a leaf, he wasn’t sure. He glanced around him and froze. ‘Draco.’ He elbowed him, his blood icy. Foxes had gathered around them, still and staring, eyes bright in the deep night. The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck rose. ‘Something’s not right,’ he whispered. ‘Let’s go.’
He turned to look at Potter and the intensity in his eyes warmed Draco to the bone. He felt his cheeks heating up.
Potter’s explained how to alert him, and he lets Draco in a circular space with doors on all sides. ‘Break room,’ he calls, and a door on their right flings open, allowing a glimpse into a large, shabby room.
Harry pulled Draco’s cloak off and threw it on the armchair, too. ‘I thought this was your present. Coming back here—’
‘In school he did. I remember you glaring at each other from across the Hall. But we’re grown-ups now, Draco. Harry Potter’s a forgiving man. He also bats for both teams. He’ll definitely be open to your… talents.’
‘… but Draco refused! Whatever he was like at school, whatever we thought of him, he still had enough sense to say no.’ Dean’s voice heated up. ‘If you ask me, everyone who took the Dark Mark was an utter
Harry briefly entertained the idea of Voldemort TV, and it might have been funny if his visions didn’t disturb him so much. ‘No,’ he said quietly. He grabbed a cushion with three embroidered poppies and held it to his chest. ‘I’m much more close to — to him. I can't explain it well. I just feel what he's feeling when he’s particularly angry — or happy. These people are just actors. It’s all made up.’
, Harry concentrated on the feeling of another person’s fingers, warm and rough, against the sensitive foreskin. He breathed heavily, his eyes fluttering as wave after wave of pleasure surged through his veins. He’d no idea it was like this, no fucking clue. He buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, sniffing greedily at his scent, familiar and thrilling at the same time: wood and wet grass and lightning; like playing Quidditch during a summer storm.
he told himself. Draco is a colleague. Not his partner, but a colleague, nonetheless. This is what people do when their colleagues get abducted.
The man was sitting in the shadows, a lone lamp lighting his cheekbones and the expensive cut of his clothes. Harry knew he’d been stripped of jewels and weapons upon his capture. He took in the man’s long legs and his insolent posture and continued, ‘Your father will indeed hear about this—and then he’ll pay us the ransom, like they all do, worried we’ll hurt their precious little heirs.’
Harry took in the sight of him sprawled on the bed, naked and fair, his shoulders and face lightly tanned from the times he’d been allowed on deck, and struggled to remember what they were talking about. He straddled Draco and wrapped his hand around his cock. ‘Pirates vote,’ he said, feeling Draco’s prick grow in his hand. ‘Every important decision we have to make is put on a vote, including who the captain is. I have absolute authority during battles only.’
‘You do realise,’ Harry couldn’t stop himself from adding, ‘that bullying the friends I made wasn’t going to ingratiate you to me?’
Draco stepped out of the Manor’s drawing room fireplace, not knowing what to expect. He needn’t have worried. His parents were alive and well and, surprisingly, not dissimilar to the real world. His father bore the Dark Mark; but then again, he probably hadn’t regretted taking it as much as Draco did.
‘No,’ Malfoy says. He takes advantage of Harry’s momentary surprise and grabs his wrists. With one fluid movement, he swivels them around and pinions Harry against the bricks. ‘This is more what I had in mind,’ he says, his breath hot on Harry’s skin.
Please note that it's unbetaed and there'll be some errors as I'm a non-native speaker of English. Other than that: enjoy!
Salazar shifted. ‘Was born and raised far from the capital. But this is my home now.’ The resentment tainting Salazar’s last words would’ve baffled Harry if he hadn’t been distracted by the glimpse of his collarbone through his open shirt. Although the man’s face was nothing to write home about, he made up for it with his broad swimmer’s shoulders and his long legs.
Draco chuckles. ‘You fucking greedy boy.’ He pushes himself to the hilt, the tight fit making him gasp. ‘Enough for you or do you want it harder?’
The whole thing had lasted less than two minutes. The conductor whistled; the doors shut and locked. The train left, a young man with a briefcase standing where the schoolchildren had been.
They found several others in the pitch and the game turned into an impromptu Eighth Year four-a-side match where players disregarded House loyalty, and different Houses played side by side. This was similar to the real life’s Eighth Year games, except that this time Draco was a part of them, teaming up with Dean Thomas, Justin Finch-Fletchley and Padma Patil. Draco failed to catch the Snitch this time, which was to be expected as he spent most of the game time ogling Harry on his broom (not unlike what he used to do in real life if he was honest with himself).
. Not an auspicious name as far as Harry was concerned. The pub stood opposite the church of St Gudwal in the midst of a handful of quiet cottages. In front of the church lay a tiny square with a dry fountain, a stone bench and an ancient oak.
‘Well, there is one other interested party keen to speak with you. I daresay you have questions for them, too. It was he who realised the cause of your coma.’
Draco and Harry had been seeing each other for two weeks now in the real world. It was simultaneously far better and much harder than the Mirror-relationship, which had unfolded so smoothly and trouble-free that Draco hadn’t recognised it as unrealistic until he’d returned here.
Malfoy talks over him. ‘Not a hero? Perhaps you fancied me even then. Perhaps you wanted me to drag you into an empty classroom and have my way with you.’
They walked back to the cottage in silence, having forgotten to gather any wood, Harry’s mind whirring after this intrusion of the wizarding world into their safe bubble. Draco had assured him that if the bird returned — if it turned out they could safely use it — Harry could send a message to his friends. Harry longed for it, he desperately wanted to confirm his friends were safe, and to assure them that he’d soon find them. But he also felt torn about leaving this place — and Draco. So selfish of him; and yet he couldn’t help desperately wanting more of the home comforts, the peace of a simple life and the pleasure of touching Draco, who laughed more and more as days went by.
. Draco had nightmares about seeing the Dark Lord again. He shook his head to get rid of the unwelcome images and tried to recall the most puzzling aspects of the Mirror world.
Potter was waiting for him at the school’s entrance after lunch. He’d been walking to the greenhouses with Draco these past few weeks and they’d paired up during the lesson, most of the time with minimal bickering.
Harry fell back on his pillows, ignoring the shuddering breaths next to him. A moment later, the side of the bed dipped. Soft footsteps and a creak at the door told him that Draco had left the room. Harry wanted to go after him, he wasn’t sure why, but experience told him he should perhaps leave him well alone. He knew Draco simply parroted his parents’ beliefs, and he could see the effort he’d been making to readjust his thinking, but still, hearing those arguments made Harry’s temper — always a hard beast to tame — rise to the surface.
, Draco wanted to say, but knew it’d come out as petulant. Potter walked across the floor to stand in front of him.
. Everything he said that he’d loved—his smile, the way Harry clung to him at night, the taste of his lips, the timbre of his voice—soft and low—when he spoke to Draco, the fact he was willing to laugh at Weasley’s inane jokes—this was all Harry. This Harry.
Harry had to hand it to him; it was a brilliant idea. A pureblood like Dolohov wouldn’t know what to make of anything Muggle. However, Muggle resources required Muggle money: they had barely any left. Luckily, after considerable search, they’d found a second-hand electronics shop — where Draco possibly Confounded the owner while haggling and Harry pretended he didn’t hear it — and a Boots to visit a photo booth, which delighted Draco in an endearing way.
‘Are you wearing nail varnish!?’ Draco asked when he saw Potter’s hand on his schoolbag, his nails painted black.
The possibility this was a dream remained a strong contender. Perhaps Draco had hit his head on the bed post harder than he’d thought and was unconscious. However, it didn’t explain why he’d seen Harry Potter in his bed
Harry’s fate had been tied so tightly with Draco’s these days that he hadn’t considered that. For the public,
Mrs Li ignores him. Her hair is elegantly tied back and she wears a dark blue dress that probably cost more than their sofa. Draco’s certain the sapphires on her ears are genuine; spoils of her victories at poker. She’s the picture of understated wealth and power; incongruous next to Nariyoshi in his suede fringed waistcoat and peace-symbol necklace.
When Draco thought about what he’d left behind, he couldn’t breathe. It was of no use knowing Mirror Harry was probably shagging Mirror Draco right now, whispering
‘We’ll stay if we can get a lift with your grandson.’ He glanced at Draco to check he agreed, and Draco exhaled and nodded. Harry turned to the two ladies. ‘Thank you. We’ll be very happy to help you with any chores while we’re here.’
Draco fumbles on the table for his wand and locks the door. He threads his fingers through Potter’s hair and tugs. No matter how delectable Potter looks on his knees, it’s not enough. ‘I want to fuck you. Would you want that?’
‘I’m perfectly capable—’ Draco spluttered, but she shushed him and scrubbed his hands. Bemused, Draco glanced at Harry, who shrugged back. Perhaps this was the way they did things. Best not offend their hosts.
It’s still dark when Harry opens his eyes. Exhaustion pulls at his limbs; he feels he ran a marathon in his sleep. His pulse starts rising at the memory of the dream; he takes deep breaths.
.’ Perhaps Malfoy likes lovers who collapse after sex, because he’s smiling in a wicked, promising way, which thrills Harry to the core. ‘In fact, I’d love to have you again, if you’re up for it.’
rolled under her arm; they hid behind a lilac bush before she saw them. Shortly, they crested the uphill lane and stared down at a small, pretty village. Whitewashed cottages with thatched roofs squeezed next to each other along narrow lanes, coloured smoke puffing out of chimneys. In the distance, past fields green with young barley, the ocean gleamed innocently in the spring light.
Harry brushed Draco’s hair off his face, tucked it behind his ear. ‘Now,’ he said, ‘you’re coming with me.’
Pleasantly content after the delicious meal, Harry perched on the edge of a vardo. The children ran around, daring each other to come close to the newcomers. They called them
Harry had no idea why he’d suggested it, or why he felt nervous as he set a carafe of sweet red wine and two glasses on a marble table and waited for his husband. Draco arrived a few moments later, holding a platter of cheese. ‘I took the liberty of ordering some food from the kitchens. You have a lovely mature cheddar that I’m quite partial to.’
Draco finds it increasingly hard to deny he’s enjoying spending time with Potter. The thrill of seeing the Boy Who Lived on his knees, getting rammed by Draco’s cock, hasn’t faded yet. The memory brings a flush to his face, he can feel it, and he does his best to take his mind off sex and deal with what Potter thinks is an appropriate milestone in their relationship: meeting up with his friends.
this man touch— How dare? The dark rage that consumed him overflowed, spilled out of him. He wanted to harm this vermin, frantically scrambling towards the corner as if he’d escape Harry’s vengeance. He wanted to make him
Malfoy spread open the map on the ground and they both leaned over it. He traced his finger across the routes available to them.
Harry flips him two fingers. ‘You buy my cider then, since you’re a toff. I’m going to grab a table.’
But now Potter’s his only solution. Once Nariyoshi becomes stable around dawn, Draco heads into London and the visitor’s entrance to the Ministry.
It felt nostalgic, they way they traded anemic insults as if a schoolboy rivalry was all they had to worry about. ‘I guess I had the help of someone whose grades were better than yours.’
‘Come with me,’ Draco said. He held Harry's hand and led him upstairs to the bedroom at the back of the building.
Harry opened his eyes and looked at the slanting ceiling above him. He scratched at the cotton duvet, but struggled to find something strong enough to pull him out of his head. His eyes fluttered and once more he fell into the dark—
‘Do it,’ Harry says, vibrating with desire. There’s a kernel of fear in his arousal. Harry has no idea why, but it makes it all the more thrilling.
‘You don’t know whose ship you’re on? That wasn’t very smart of you, mouthing off like that to a pirate captain without knowing who they are. Mad-Eye Moody takes the tongues of people that annoy him. Half of his crew is mute.’
Eventually, Draco sat up, looking as dazed and happy as Harry felt. He glanced at the sky. ‘It’s almost noon. We should have been to the coast an hour ago. I wanted to teach you sailing.’
Draco tucks him in and surrenders to an unwelcome but insistent desire; he kisses Potter softly on the lips. ‘Sleep now.’
Harry stretched his hand, wordlessly asking for it, and Draco, reluctant, handed it over. Examining it closely, Harry whistled in awe. The crack in the side was almost gone. The wand was knitting itself together; extraordinary.
‘Alright, you still do—but it’s mostly my arse you’re obsessed with now.’ Harry sighed dramatically, and added, ‘You’d think a person would have enough of rimming, but nope. Not you.’ He smiled at Draco again—all those smiles given so easily—without realising that Draco had stopped breathing. Rimming? He spent his nights
She seems to read his thoughts. ‘It’s all over Knockturn Alley. At the creature clubs and the potion dens; at the brothels and the betting rooms; at the dark corners of clubs, people whisper that an Incubus walks among us, promising pure pleasure in exchange for a little… sustenance. He looks different every time, but they all agree he’s the same man.’
Harry made a mental note never to piss off Dawn. They finished their meal in silence in the darkening kitchen. Draco returned the tray and bid them goodnight. With Esther not around, everyone decided on an early night. Harry helped Dawn with her dishes and stopped by Esther’s room to chat with her a bit.
‘Get out of my face,’ he hissed at the Ravenclaw. His memory provided the name: Terry Boot. Another one of Potter’s friends.
Leaving them staring at it in bafflement, Harry and Draco bolted away from them. Their steps echoed in the stillness; by the time Harry considered casting a Silencio, it was too late.
Every afternoon the same patient sits on the bench by the pond, gazing at the willows. Harry sits beside him.
‘My daughters think I’m crazy. But I want to remember. I want to remember how cruel people can be. And how, occasionally, you can find compassion in the most surprising of places.’ She looked at them both and added, ‘Sometimes it takes one person to make a difference.’
After lunch, he met Granger in the library for a brutal study session. They both took Arithmancy. The way Granger responded to the numbers and figured out the connections between them was a kind of magic all of its own. Draco had never loved Arithmancy but, as one of the most prestigious subjects, Father had highlighted the need to achieve at least an E in the N.E.W.T.s.
Spell after spell rained behind them as they zigzagged through the forest, crashing through the undergrowth, stumbling on gnarled roots, trampling through the stream. Draco turned to cast a Stupefy; he aimed well, and it shot true, but Rookwood waved it away with an almost careless gesture, a gnat not worthy of exertion.
A drowsy murmur: ‘We get on. I knew we would.’ Potter clasps Draco’s hand with his, a gesture that tugs at Draco’s chest in its simplicity and trust.
That night Draco’s in high spirits. The exhilaration and relief he’d felt that day, after Nariyoshi was taken to St Mungo’s and received a few vials that made an immediate improvement, still courses through his veins. He’s dancing with joy inside. This is a victory; a change in his fortunes, like picking up a card when the game’s almost lost, and seeing it’s a King.
‘I’m not trying to drown you. Put your head under water so they won’t smell you. Hurry. I’ll hold your glasses.’ When Harry hesitated, he whispered, ‘I haven’t given you any reason to distrust me this last day, Potter.’
him, or harm him in any way,’ she says, glossing over the part where Draco’s “talents” can harm people, even in small, unseen ways. ‘He’ll
continued its tirade against all former Death Eaters, mentioning his father almost daily. The Dark Mark haunted his dreams without respite. Draco longed for nothing more than to go back to the Mirror world, but he knew that to wish for it meant wanting death.
‘I knew it was a matter of minutes. I managed to activate my wand locator before he grabbed me,’ Draco said, stretching one arm in relief. ‘Where are the others?’
knows something’s not right. Not Apparating — that’s made him suspicious. But he thinks it’s because we were looking for something in the moor. Rookwood is going to be searching the area to discover what it might be.’
The guttering light deepens the wrinkles around her eyes when she laughs. ‘You won’t win it. But you will pay it back. In a week.’
‘We have no time.’ Potter pulled him gently in front of the Mirror. ‘I can’t do this without you. You have to want to go through.’
‘You can have as many bedrooms as you want. The house has about two dozen.’ Harry pulls back to gaze at Draco, his hand on Draco’s hair. ‘I know moving in is a big step. Definitely too soon. But you don’t have to see me as your live-in boyfriend; more like… a housemate.’
‘She’s Mirror Hermione now,’ Draco explained to Harry when he saw how unnerved he looked. ‘When we cross over, we replace the Mirror people. Our mind—or consciousness, whatever—takes over their body.’ Having realised that this wasn’t
Malfoy stared at him, eyes growing cold. ‘Maybe he’ll reward me if I give you to him. Maybe you’re lying.’
When Draco’s explained the situation, she asks, ‘So you want to waive the Statute in the case of your— boss? Flatmate?’
He could picture the scene: holding hands in the middle of a quiet lane, snow falling soft around them, Potter’s cheeks pink with cold, their breaths fogging in front of them… He’d dreamed of this fantasy more times than he cared to admit.
When the Patronus came, Harry stopped mid-shave and Apparated to the Ministry. He barged inside the Auror office, looking thunderous. ‘Who has him?’
. ‘Er, sure.’ Harry accepts the proffered glass and takes a sip. The vodka is sweet and fragrant, delicate like a starlit night. ‘Er, I’m not sure what mine is — something metallic almost — want to try?’
Draco kept track of the time he spent in the Mirror world, ticking each day off in his diary. He’d been there just over two weeks. Fifteen days filled with a staggering amount of sex, a lot of Quidditch practice, considerable progress in Arithmancy under Hermione’s tutelage, and very little sleep. He’d just left the library when he saw her, climbing the stairs.
To cover his momentary display of vulnerability, Malfoy put the bomber jacket aside and stood with open arms, imperial and haughty, an invitation for Harry to dress him. Pauline beamed at the sight of a ritual she would never herself experience. Harry stepped closer and put the parka on Malfoy. It was large in the shoulders and perhaps a little too long, but the olive colour suited him. His eyes met Malfoy’s in the mirror, and Malfoy looked away.
‘Here.’ Malfoy stretched out his hand, half a chocolate frog in it. ‘I had it in my pocket. Take it.’
Harry abandons the food. ‘I don’t think I can look Kreacher in the eye,’ he says, his eyes wrinkled in a smile.
‘Oh, you can, sweetheart, can’t you?’ Draco murmurs, finding an easy rhythm. In and out, he watches his cock disappear in Potter’s arse. He’d fantasised about this when he was in school, but the reality exceeds even his wildest teen dreams — the dream sex he had with Potter not ten days ago pales in significance.
‘You know what. You won’t say a word to me. Is it because I touched your precious hair in the morning?’ Draco seemed furious and maybe even a little hurt.
The men bowed, foreheads on a floor still covered in broken glass and blood, and Harry came to, his scar pulsing with pain.
Trust the devil to choose his words well. Harry hadn’t felt so aroused so fast in his life, and he’d been a fifteen-year-old boy. The image Draco conjured had his pulse spiking. He flipped them around, pushing Draco against the tree and his thigh between Draco’s legs. Draco moaned, a tantalising smile on his face.
Draco smiled fondly. ‘I’ll show you.’ He picked his wand up from from where it'd fallen by the bed and Accio’ed the lube he carried in his robes out of habit rather than hope.
Draco didn’t notice. ‘That’s why I make sure I never leave a single drop around at the Manor, not with all those… thugs coming and going.’
‘Yes, it was them, Anton,’ the short wizard was saying, irritated. ‘I know what Potter and Malfoy look like.’
Draco took it as a yes. He lowered himself on Harry’s slicked cock. Below him Harry shuddered when the head entered Draco's arse. ‘Oh fuck,
The pub is the Leaky and it’s Draco’s sixth date with Potter. Two weeks have passed since the incident in his studio. They’ve been out for drinks (and shagged in the gents’ — Draco likes to pretend his confession about his nightmares never happened), for dinner (played footsie under the table), at the cinema (necked like teenagers), at the
? Draco had seen the hairnet before, sure, but that’s where the similarities ended. This woman was easily in her twenties, with lustrous brown hair and flawless skin. Her voice did sound like Madam Pomfrey’s, though. And the brisk way she ran tests on Draco, casting spell after spell over him, reminded him of her. And the frown when she examined the results of the spells…
They argued for a few moments about the prudency of sending back a reply. In the end, they reached a compromise: the bird flew away with a bluebell in its beak. Watching him fly off, Draco said wistfully, ‘My mother was named after a flower.’
The next day ambled by in a haze of bliss. Harry definitely walked with a spring in his step now. He peeled potatoes for lunch and helped Dawn with the laundry, and all the while his mind replayed the memories of the night before, causing his cheeks to warm up. He kept stealing glances at Draco, who glanced at him as often as Harry did. The heat and longing in Draco’s eyes suggested they shared the same thought: they had only a few more nights sharing a bed. A few more nights to touch each other.
‘No, I—’ Draco shook his head. ‘Nothing.’ He poured some water onto a ficus and moved to the next plant, but not before casting another look outside. Harry wondered if he was hoping for Melor to appear through the trees — or terrified that Death Eaters would.
He wished for so many things under that vast, dark sky: he wished he knew what Dumbledore had really wanted him to do; he wished he hadn’t failed him; he wished the next Horcrux wasn’t where he suspected it was; but most of all he wished this whole mission didn’t feel increasingly like a march to his death. He wished he was wrong about this.
Potter meets his eyes. ‘I hate the fact you were sentenced to Azkaban despite—’ He wisely doesn’t mention how altruistic he’d been, Draco’s not sure he’d be able to restrain himself from decking him.
,’ he told him, his voice soft, courtesy of the sip of Calming Draught probably, since Draco tended to be a lot more strung-out near Potter. He itched with the desire to bury his hands in Potter’s hair. Apart from caressing his cheek before, he hadn’t dared to touch him again. ‘But fill me in the last few days, Potter.’
He wakes up in his bed, in Draco’s arms, his cheeks wet. Draco holds him tight, his familiar smell reassuring Harry that he’s alive; that he’s there and he’s real.
For a second, everything stilled: the crackling fire, the wind rattling the windows, Draco’s heart. And then sensation flooded in, heating every part of Draco, and everything became too bright, too loud, too vivid. His heart thrummed as he stared at Harry’s green eyes. ‘I love you, too.’
The first thing that came back to him were sounds: his mother sniffling, a gasp, his father’s voice. Hermione’s voice explaining something, Madam Pomfrey issuing commands.
Harry didn’t reply to his taunt — if that’s what it was — and glanced at Draco’s shoulder. He winced at the sight of the angry red skin and the swelling surrounding the deep cut.
‘I don’t think it ever goes away. This feeling.’ Harry still held on Draco’s waist, his skin warm and soft, the touch an anchor binding them together in this new grief.
Draco swallowed hard, his thoughts briefly flicking to his mother. ‘I’ll stay alive here,’ he whispered. He’d continue living in the Mirror world; another one of the formerly dead, who breathed and laughed and fell in love and had a perfectly wonderful life.
Harry stiffened as the edges of his vision darkened; a wave of fury pulsed through him. His knees hit the ground with a thud.
‘I hate not having a wand,’ Harry said. ‘There’s loads of protective spells we could use at the cottage.’
Draco knew what Harry liked. He licked his ear and cupped his cock and trailed fingers on his thigh the way Mirror Harry liked, and was pleased to discover that real Harry responded as beautifully as his other self to Draco’s ministrations. Before long, they were both panting, trousers unbuttoned and hands everywhere.
Harry’s mind warned him about everything that could go wrong — about the madness of trusting a Malfoy. But he didn’t like the alternative and he had to admit Malfoy’s suggestion made sense. Besides, Harry needn't mention Shell Cottage. As soon as they reached Tinworth, he’d clear off and leave Malfoy to his own schemes.
‘Women don’t interest me and I have never lacked for wealth or booze. No need to sentence myself to a stinking ship alongside stinking men.’
. Nothing matters more than the pleasure building under his feverish skin. Malfoy’s cock is hard and slick, and he’s pumping, again and again, deeper and deeper until he lifts Harry, sets him on all fours and thrusts inside him so deep that Harry shuts his eyes and comes.
Harry barely held back a gasp. Draco kept looking at the duvet and acted as if he hadn’t said anything shocking. Harry had no idea how to respond. He stared at Draco’s bent head, the hair falling in his eyes. ‘I saw
‘We should stay off the road.’ Malfoy's finger moved southeast and tapped a name: Bodmin Moor. ‘If we cross the Moor, we’ll get to the south coast by tonight. Or maybe tomorrow morning. And then it’s just straight down along the coast.’
Harry stared at the blood spilling from the cut, his mind frantic and conflicted. He couldn’t — he just couldn’t trust Malfoy with his blood. What if he was going to sell him out? What if this had all been a ruse? Truce or no truce, Malfoy was his enemy.
‘Good.’ Draco gave him a half smile before lying back down. ‘Now you know. Well, good night.’ He turned his back to Harry.
Harry blinked, gasping for air. Dread flooded him as he struggled, as always, to come to. The vision pulled him under, but Draco’s breath fell hot on his face. ‘Harry!’
‘That was what? You hate Hermione because she’s Muggleborn. You called her slurs. She kicks your arse in magic — yet now you’re telling me that Muggleborns like her
The men scurried out of the room in a hurry, making their useless promises, and Nagini slithered in and curled at his feet, sensing his agitation. Voldemort reached down to her and stroked her head. ‘Potter’s mine, Nagini, but you can have Malfoy.’ The snake flicked its tongue.
Draco rose to his feet, exchanging a glance with him. Harry would bet faeries didn’t hold conversations about laundry. He trod as silently as he could towards the noise, parting branches before his face, stepping over exposed roots, Draco on his side, his hand on his wand. They reached a clearing and crouched behind a thorn bush.
’ Malfoy's voice was grim, barely audible among the murmuring river and the birdsong. ‘His parents controlled every aspect of his life. No wonder he went full dark this year.’
She rolled her eyes. ‘You and Hermione? How can you not be? You worked together in the resistance for over a year and you’re seeing her best friend.’
Casting a non-verbal cleaning spell, Harry spreads Draco wider and licks his quivering hole, blowing some air on it and watching it flutter. It tastes sweet, in a rich, earthy way, and Harry burrows closer and starts licking him in earnest. Saliva drips down his chin as he laps at Draco’s rim before he jabs his tongue inside Draco’s arse, fast and sharp, then in circles. Draco lets out a litany of gasps and moans, his thighs vibrating with tension over Harry’s head. It’s not enough for Harry; he wants Draco out of his mind, he wants him
The memories choke him and he points to the other men. ‘Longbottom; the man knew his way around a garden, I can tell you that. McMillan. Thomas. Goyle, that big lad with the cigarette.’ All are dead or wounded, scattered in military hospitals or unnamed graves. Half his peers gone once the dust had settled.
different and safer spells for secret communication — if you have access to a wand. This is what kids do.’ He glanced at the words and blanched.
He stalks to the back of the room and places the statue on her feet, pressing the little bump. He’d added that one last night, knowing they couldn’t come close enough to check. A tiny signal flashes to the Aurors hidden outside.
much cooler than me. A hero, not a villain. Do you think I don’t know what it’s like to have mirror-envy?’
. But back then—’ A very early memory: being very young and wanting to decorate his cupboard for Christmas. His aunt had grudgingly let him have one bauble, a bright red one with sparkly bits, and he placed it on the shelf next to a Rubik’s Cube he could never solve. He’d spent the rest of the holidays admiring the way the ornament caught the meagre light and shone, casting sparks on the dim walls like distant stars. The stupid bauble had made him so happy.
The room was the pride and joy of Uncle Orion, who’d loved books as much as he’d loved decapitating house-elves. It boasts wood-panelled walls, shelves inlaid with spells for book preservation, a glass cabinet with curios beside the leather sofa, and a standing globe with the map of the world as it was in the 1800s.
The door shut behind Harry with a thud that echoed around the stone walls. It was warm and dry, and he was thankful. The young man—Draco, he said—waved away his thanks. ‘It’s nothing. I’m always up late at night anyway.’
It was farther than Harry had assumed. He let his thoughts drift back to the Manor, back to the things he’d heard there, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. His thoughts beat with the rhythm of his footsteps on the ground. Hallows… Horcruxes… Hallows… Horcruxes… The obsessive longing for the Hallows burned in him, but his worry about his friends and the predicament he found himself in had dimmed the fire. No matter how much it’d cost him to lose the holly and phoenix wand, he hadn’t had to do without one completely. Despair filled him. He felt impotent. The loss of his wand crushed him more than before, because he was beginning to understand, and he knew — he could feel — Voldemort beginning to understand as well. He knew where the Elder Wand had been all this time and Harry, unable to stop what was about to happen, knew that he’d lost. He’d lost one of the Hallows.
‘Again.’ Draco lowers his head and takes him soft in his mouth. He savours the taste of Harry’s heavy prick, sucking at the glans until he’s fully hard, and swallows him deep.
Draco stared resolutely out of the window, his mouth a thin line. The reminders of their history sneaked in like weeds in a garden bed, wrapping themselves around the tender stalk of whatever was growing between them. Harry liked Draco; he really did. Draco made him laugh, and shiver with pleasure; this past week he had shown kindness and generosity, compassion and courage. He sat opposite Harry now, on the way to Tinworth and danger, when he could’ve stayed at a warm, probably safe, loving cottage. Reconciling this Draco and the old one took some doing, though.
‘You really should take it easy with each other, man. Harry could barely climb the stairs this morning.’ He laughed heartily and greeted Pansy with a kiss on her cheek.
Truce or no truce, Draco rubbing his pureblood superiority on Harry grated him. ‘What does that even have to do with the Muggles?’
So their relationship wasn’t a secret. Draco couldn’t resist to gloat. ‘More like I kept him up, Pans.’ He served himself some tea and a healthy amount of eggs and bacon. He was famished. Possibly because of all the sex he had. He smiled to himself. He couldn’t stop smiling.
Draco could tell she did it for him; her capacity for hours of uninterrupted study amazed him. He gazed at her for a few moments. ‘Hermione,’ her name rolled with difficulty off his tongue, ‘don’t tell Harry I asked you this, but how did we become friends?’
I’m sure he would, but I’m not sure I want to go on shopping trips in something like that! Well, maybe for fun.
“Agreed, we’ll be a distraction and it’s probably going to be quite loud. . . . . The Ravenclaws love a party.”
I have a better idea. How about you just tell all the old people to fuck off and that it’s a kids only thing. Or just not tell them at all! There’s already going to be a dinner the night before the wedding and a reception after for everyone. Plus . . . my Mother is involved. Trust me there are going to be more than enough family functions. We don’t need to start adding to that.
“Second in the line I thought would be horizontal over the fireplace here in the receiving. You can put them anywhere you want though. Maybe Draco should decide.”
“Harry look at this place. It’s perfect for it. Summertime barbecues up on the roof or in the back garden? Parties in your conservatory?”
“Isn’t it cool? It’s the quidditch display! Mine and yours. Oh shite. Your Mother loaned me that. Jamie cleaned it up. I forgot to ask if it was okay.”
AP: Some people don’t get that though. We don’t dance around issues like jealousy anymore like when we were younger. I don’t feel threatened by people seeing Scorp as desirable.
“Exactly what I was expecting. Each unit has a courtyard with privacy, but the grass lets light and air through. What’s that?”
Doesn’t hurt to ask. I really wouldn’t doubt that the Goblins can do it. I’ll ask Draco to get the the trademark registered.
I’ll agree to that. I can’t do something like that right now anyway, but in the not too distant future.
But we just thought he’d like to go? He sent us a nice note saying you were both coming and everything! I didn’t know there was a monster? How bad is it?
“That playground is, well, wonderful. And you know, I can’t wait for the day when our granddaughter is old enough to play out there.”
“Okay that’s just weird. I don’t think anyone’s called him an angel or anything like that before. His hair isn’t silver, it’s just really light blonde. Oh Merlin, please don’t say it’s silver or grey in front of him . . . . It’s okay to say he’s pretty, because he is. His boy is Scorpius this is him here with the new baby.”
Ginny was up there going barmy over Jerry’s protection spells. Up there with her broom and trying to throw herself off the roof testing them.
No, I was testing, not trolling. If I was trolling other people would have been involved. Your analysis of my inadequate potion is perfect. And I’ve named the ingredient scorpstone. That’s going to be in the potion journals.
“You can still play with it. And maybe someday you’ll go to the shop where they have wands that are meant just for you.”
“You know I can’t, Potter. I need to make sure the Creepy is adequate. I’ve got an appointment with Crystal that I’ve already rescheduled once today.”
So here’s what you’re going to do. I need you to do your “Harry Potter” thing and get this done. Get them out today somehow. The sooner the better. Judy threatened them. She put a lot of cards on the table that she didn’t mean to I’m sure.
I told Ted earlier that I thought I remembered it being pretty bad. But nothing like this. DEFINITELY NOT birthday party material.
The conversation was recorded weeks prior to publication and this is a transcript of the conversation.
Two are what would be considered “novelty” automobiles but most are functional for daily use. All have been heavily converted for magical maintenance. They do not run on Muggle petrol. The vehicles respond exactly as they should. Manual transmission response, acceleration, engine and reverberation timbre. The last purchase in the collection was what Pollux Black used to transport musicians and instruments to Number Twelve. Commonly known as “the bus” that one is not useable.
Turn to page 46. Pages 47 through 1295 are detailed accountings, just ignore that part for now. We’ll wait.
“Yeah, I guess. But Junior would be really good for her in my opinion. I was more concerned about the age difference to tell you the truth.”
“The ingredients are potent, but you brewed it yourself, Andi. I should be completely fine. I definitely trust you.”
“Well no, you need to grind the coffee and put it in the portafilter. Use this tool to tamp it down. . . . .insert into the group head and THEN push the Draco button.”
Sleakeasy. Pepperup. and a couple of the others. They're re-branded and produced for Muggles through hold on. I’m looking it up. Cosmetic and pharmaceutical corporations in the U.S., U.K. and distributed internationally.
And the Goblins will definitely help with that. Let’s make a plan. . . For now just tell the Kids about the plans for the Cottage. Take it a little bit at a time. For now, don’t tell them about the vaults or properties unless absolutely necessary. Call a family meeting later. Tell them a little at a time. Over years if you need to.
“Pans, don’t give me a bad time about this. I promise I’ll get there and you can dress me up like a doll. We’re just really busy right now.”
I will send you the details by Gringotts post. Match begins at 16:00, however the “rabble” as they call themselves usually gather at around 12:00 outside the stadium for refreshments.
“Roughly 30 percent. They’re looking to be a little more than half done by tomorrow. Sure is a lot easier without the restrictions.”
“Grayson’s idea. We get it cleaned up, and I mean really cleaned up. Bring in Bill to sweep the place first. Cleaning, painting, polishing it all up. Leave it the dark colours outside but make it look like it was once meant to be. A nice definitive curiosity shop. Then gut the interior. I’m sure there are still some cool old display shelves and cases that can be redone. Keep the old wrought iron staircases and railings, but otherwise just open it up into a big open space.”
“Tap into my playlist and put on the new Joy Crookes album. Just came out, it’s pretty good . . . . . Let’s get these owls to work.”
“That’s not what I meant! All of that noise? The whole place was shaking! There are Muggles living in those townhouses!”
Nothing else about me is straight why should my head be? Also, Draco has taken time off until at least through the wedding.
“I thought I would get a head start. I’ve done the entry, this reception parlour, that little reading room and the study.”
when Lucy came home last night she couldn’t stop talking about how much she loved those kids. How much fun they had. She’s been so fucking sheltered her whole life and I’ve tried my best to fight that, but this is different. I’m horrified at the thought that she’ll get attached to all of this and it will disappear. ”
“Want to see the snitches? They’re down this way . . . . . oh, and the craft cubbies. That's like it's own little art gallery by itself . . . . . . . . . ”
Excellent idea. You can conduct the interviews here at Gringotts to protect your privacy. I’ll arrange a meeting room. Just tell me when, but give me a couple of days to review prospects for you.
I can confirm that Brunhilde Aspreng is that prune who's always in the paper. She's the Chief Warlock.
“Isn’t she beautiful! She says she moved here just after the park opened. She was checking out the worm bin out behind the conservatory. They like to lay eggs in a compost bin. I might make one for her in the spring?
“Okay. . . . .well once when you were about 8 years old you decided we would have a competition. . . . .who could grow the biggest pumpkin in the vegetable garden. . . .So we went to the Muggle garden store for seeds. . . .you chose the “Super Giant” seeds. . . .we both planted one to start in a pot, but I went to Hagrid and got his SUPER GIANT pumpkin seeds and switched yours out. . . .That fucking pumpkin was as tall as me. We had to levitate it to move it. . . . .Obviously you won the competition and we had a blast carving it for halloween. . . .I’ve got a photo of you kids all standing in it and poking your head out of it. You and Scorp in the eyes, Jamie in the nose and Lily down in it’s mouth grinning like a fool . . .
Might be easier to do your meeting virtually instead of making everyone travel. Especially if everyone is going to be busy late into the night on Tuesday.
“The cellar isn’t massive but it’s manageable. Was meant to be used and not just for storage. There’s whole lounge back here that looks like a freaking trendy wine bar!”
“Why do these always have to be in fucking old crap latin! Don’t wizards accept any other language????”
I think I’m going to have to set up a small lab at the studio. It think I’ll be using this quite a bit.
“Scorpius, I need you to put your things away for the day and come to the roof with me. Al’s waiting.”
“I’ve got a Bordeaux! Chateau Latour. Medoc. Cabernet. I’ve tested it. It’s perfectly lovely. Look!”
It’s a variation of a calming draught. If it’s successful it doesn’t carry the side-effects or leave the user feeling intoxicated.
Mum and Dad just sat the whole time smiling and egging him on while Jerry was out front sketching and measuring. Oh and now Jerry is doing the front yard and they’re painting the outside LIME GREEN even the wrought iron gate and fences.
Lima 2.0 is owned still by wizards but it’s in it’s old location in Muggle London and yes I pulled the “savior card” to get us a reservation (and perhaps a couple perks).
Hermione may as well be royalty in this household. Harry is around enough that the staff just play silly jokes on he and Draco. Ongoing and reciprocal joke war between staff and those two.
“So just leave it. There’s nothing in this house that I would want except maybe an heirloom tea set and that will still be here after the ritual.”
Draco is itching to come over there. He is literally rocking on his feet and wringing his hands. This will not end well. And dad put him in a pink wide necked crew and black jeans. This is weird! He’s wearing camouflage high top trainers for fucks sake!
LLL: Okay, let’s get back on track . . .This article is supposed to be about your upcoming marriage! So are you excited about the wedding? The grapevine is hinting that it’s going to be fabulous.
“And was he as smitten with you or did he just take you for all of your galleons building this thing? And what’s up with the cherubs?”
Mr. Draco L. Malfoy, Ms. Narcissa Black-Malfoy, Mr. Harry J. Potter and The Euphemia Potter Arts Foundation.
I absolutely trust you, but I refuse to just take your money to do this. Those manufacturers will take a cut, yes, but what are we talking about?
“Never thought I’d see the day that Blaise Zabini would be a good fit for Narcissa Malfoy, but here we are.”
Perhaps I should consider opening the front shop over the weekend if there’s ample product for the shelves. The display units should be arriving tomorrow. It’s just a matter of placing the units and filling them.
I can write this up if you want when we’re done. Hannah is going to need help at the Leaky. I owe her a big thanks for taking care of me. I’ll be there for whatever she needs.
“I’m doing it. Draco, I think it’s time to get Gloria and Cel here. I’m in no shape to do it. Can you do it?”
Obviously Draco knows everything. His Mum knows most of it. I’m eventually telling the Kids about the titles. They already know about opening Grimmauld. Not about the other properties at least not yet and most certainly not about the vaults. OH. Hemoine the libraries. I’m so sorry.
The remaining contents would be sent to a single vault and inventoried/catalogued/shelved. With this method, the contents can be easily found at a later date if needed. If you are being a frugal gentleman, in my opinion this is the best option.
“Yeah, we both do love it here. The house was a lot of stress until recently, but we feel like we've gotten over the top of the biggest hurdles. Obviously my wall art is lacking. I don’t have the taste for it like you do.”
“I need you to slice this sirloin while I prepare the vegetables and sauces. Thinly. Do you remember?”
Scorp helped me with the potion powder. This is just a wash of colour for now, but I got Decram into it by putting it between the main portrait and the one of that crazy woman from the “ladies lounge” upstairs.
Zebb and Trandy are going to participate. We left them out, they didn’t even have anything to do involving the wedding. Zebb wanted a freaking JOB so she could be there. So NO. Zebb will take you and Trandy will take Scorp from the bonding ceremony to the main ceremony. Draco and I will still do bonding ceremony, then we’ll follow you as a group from the gardens to the atrium.
So we can have people show up to those spots and let them tour Grimmauld from there in shifts so it’s not a nightmare. I’ll just have the rooms furnished and have some food and drinks set up. People can socialize then.
“So we move on to the studies. This one will be Harry’s. He likes this one the way it is and I agree. Just a good clean up.”
Right now it’s just sitting in the carriage house. It’s a fair weather ride. I don’t know why not. I’ll pull out the photos and ask the kids if it’s okay with them first. Some of them are pretty funny. I’d rather go with that.
“That’s just a technicality. Nobody that’s NOT Mr. Trandy is touching his wine bar and it’s a party, there’s no way he’s not going to open it up . . . Mr. and Mrs Brick are hanging out with my Mum and Pop and your Mum and Dad. . . .The rest of them are all in pairs and at least one of them is a Ravenclaw.”
We’ll go out tomorrow and stock the pantry. I’ll buy whatever kitchen tools you want. We can owl order those. I still have the catalogues from the cottage project.
“That’s just not the case. He now has years of experience. . . . it’s just become second nature to him. Sometimes an artist not only thrives under the pressure of a deadline, but also it can free up a person to create unexpected processes. This one rivals my Pollack’s”
Mr. Judd who resides in number 67 next door to Rose and Hugo. His unit hasn’t been touched in over 40 years. I would like to propose that we move Mr. Judd into number 44. We could then refurbish number 67 for Lily and they could reside adjacent to each other. Would that sound acceptable?
The general public don’t see you as a person. They see you as an Icon or that statue on the grounds at Hogwarts.
“I’ll make an emergency Portkey out of something, do you have the exact coordinates to your office?”
Below is the draft of the letter explaining the Non-Disclosure agreement. Let me know, I’ll be happy to make changes.
Scorp is not just a potions master. He brewed you this custom perfume. I found the diffuser in Muggle London. Scorp says it contains lavender, lilac and dandelion oils. I think it smells good.
THAT is the suit of leisure. The outfit Harry has chosen for me to wear to Kings Cross station tomorrow to send Lucy off to school but with magenta hair and a neck thing and shoes with a three inch heel.
No I was waiting to have the patent approved before approaching them about it. And I understand the importance of it. I want Ron and George to be in on the ground floor of this one.
“What do you think Draco? Evanesco all of it? We’ll start all fresh? I can get rid of the furniture and junk.”
“I don’t know. Someplace interesting that’s not connected to any of the inheritances. Maybe someplace you can look for some potions ingredients or find some new art?”
OK, I can’t guarantee anything, but I’ll see if I can get someone to cover for me and arrange travel. These dragons do not clean up after themselves.
We sure did! Nobody got Teddy’s baby pic though. That was funny. They all guessed it was me. And we all mixed up on every single Weasley. Even the Weasley’s.
If these muggles got through the wards they must live in the complex. That’s the only way they could even get into the front courtyard let alone into the house. You’ve invited residents to stop by and say hello. Remember? Are you sure they’re Muggles?
It’s going okay. We’ve restocked AGAIN. I’ve got an extra shift running in production for a few days. Mother has plenty of help here, so I think I’ll go around and check on some of the others? See if they need anything? I’ve popped into the junk shop a couple times to give Gareth a break and some pointers too.
“Right . . . . . . .here . . . . . . .and here . . . . . . . .and just for good measure here. . . . . . . .So did you have plans?”
Could we meet sometime over the weekend? Can you break away and Portkey from Wales for just a bit? Lunch at Lima? Saturday. Let me know.
Joking. So, the centre is really something else. I mean look at it. Harry and Draco really turned this place around. I was really more than a little apprehensive when they first bought the team, but this couldn’t be a better situation. They actually listened to the team and the fans about what they wanted here. I was flabbergasted when the asked me to help coordinate. It started with one of Harry’s harebrained ideas, and well Draco does not do things by half. And here we are. It’s wonderful. And NO, despite what that “other publication” says there is no conflict with my ex. He doesn’t act like any boss you would expect and Draco is all about details. And they're both friends and family. I’m the regular coach, but I’m also the team manager. Anything that goes on down at the field or in the training centre is my doing, including staff decisions. I couldn’t be happier here. So, as far as the future goes I just plan to keep doing what I’ve been doing. I am considering not writing for Witch Weekly.
This Grimmauld project is intricate. It’s not like at the Centre elaborate but it’s still a big undertaking. And we’re doing it with a super small crew because we want to keep the disruption to a minimum. But that means we don’t have someone on hand to answer a THOUSAND QUESTIONS!
Let’s just do the party here at the cottage. We can do in out on the big front lawn and he can ride his broom all over. Jon’s going to want to bring his too.
“We are definitely getting older. But you know, Harry works out. Me? I do my own routine of excercising. I still run a bit. You know that. You and I don’t have bodies that can retain that kind of bulk.”
“Well, we definitely start with the potions lab. . . . .we should look at the library and personal spaces. . . . . ”
“It’s very pleasurable for your Mother and I. You should answer Mister Granger-Weasley’s question about your intentions.”
“Give it to them. Whatever they want! Healthy snacks???? That’s just not right! These children need to get hopped up on sugar and foul tasting beans!”
No, I probably shouldn’t have said anything. NEVER MIND. I didn’t say a thing. Now I’m a fucking gossip just as bad as Uncle Ron.
“Definitely not meant for much more than snacks and tea. I’ll bet this is connected to the dumbwaiter system.”
“I’m also going to remind you that you’re going to exercise at the Centre today while I finish the kitchen clean out.”
The portrait of Decram Potter or whatever tells us that the excess happened because he was “smitten with the architect” so he just let him go crazy or something. You would think that a baroque queer would have had better taste. But no. Deckie seems a little halfwitted. At least his portrait is. And it talks back. Draco say’s he’s just “sassy”. I’ll repeat that. DRACO say’s he’s just sassy.
“That’s a good idea. It looks nice. . . . . I remember being panicked that you took the kids out on that bike.”
Just to be clear. You’re questioning the most senior account manager of Gringotts and accusing him of presenting a document to the Wizengamot containing errors? And his name is Mr. Liogell. Mr. Jaydne Liogell to be exact.
Do I have to present it to you on bended knee? Do I have to go to Paris or something? Who’s the jeweler that made the brooch for Luna?
“Snape named this his reflection ward. It’s registered as the Voscantvidere ward with the ministry but the ritual and incantation are unknown. It’s a very strong ward that cannot be broken.”
“Jay? What’s going on? I was out here a while ago and it was pretty empty. Where did everyone come from?”
See? It would be good. Make the inside all bright and airy like the penthouse. Have Dean do that skylight charm of his on the whole ceiling.”
That’s pretty much it. You can spring the legislation you have prepared on them any time after that.
I suppose it’s actual news to report on, and this whole venture was originally Luna’s suggestion after all.
Care to explain? And this had better not include the two of you traveling to a far away place and getting married in secret.
That’s a family secret Luna! Just kidding, but Scorp does make perfumes, also colognes and bath products. Has a real knack for it.
“So then you have a ballroom, another dining room, another kitchen . . .that one up there is fine just leave it alone. Do you hear me? Leave it. Clean it up. It’s perfectly fine. That big reception room is going to need dusted, swept and cleaned with a muggle vacuum once a week whether it’s been used or not. That ballroom and the dining room are art. It needs to be treated that way. The floors don’t need much, just polished up every couple of years and touched up after an event.”
