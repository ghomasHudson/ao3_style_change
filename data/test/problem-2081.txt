“I will let you sleep,” he finally said after letting everything sink in for the two of them. “Don’t beat yourself up, kid. I will talk with you Friday night after the shopping outing. Behave yourself like I know you can.”
“If you wanted to look at some of the products,” continued George as he too now looked at Harry.
“Not in the slightest,” he smiled back, wiping his face with his free hand.
"Molly," he said with a sigh, standing up and making his way around to the front of his desk. "Any sighting is good news, whether it is true or not. It gives us the hope he is still out there."
“I-I-I’m sorry, Uncle Vernon,” he whimpered after the cover of the book hit his cheek once more.
Draco turned his head, looking around the room. Harry held his breath and stilled all movement, hoping this moment would pass by smoothly. Draco scanned every inch of the room he was in before briefly looking out in to the hallway.
“What?” Harry asked in a whisper as adrenaline started to pump through his system again, ready for a fight with danger.
Harry took a second to process what the other had just said, before he burst out laughing. Drew chuckled before opening up the door to their home. A wave of nostalgia hitting him as he stepped in, thinking back on the very first time he brought Harry in to this room as an almost five year old child. The way the child’s eyes lit up at the new environment. The way he would gasp at the sight of any magic. The way he would flinch if a hand or voice was raised around him. Looking over his shoulder, Drew smiled proudly at the strong, resilient, confident young man Harry had developed in to. He wouldn’t have traded anything in the world for the past eleven years.
Harry took three long strides to reach the other window. Again, he hugged his body to the wall in case his target was suddenly to appear. He turned his head slightly and gazed upon a quiet living room. Mismatched furniture was spread out along the walls, dimly lit lighting created soft shadows, an ominous bookcase looming tall, hiding a very dark secret inside. The hairs on Harry's arms stand straight just looking at where the hidden photos were. This was one of the sickest cases he had dealt with in quite a while. No doubt this will give him much pleasure to end this sicko's life.
Eyes locked on the desk in the room, Harry walked over to it and pulled out the heavy chair. He lowered himself in the wooden desk chair. He felt the power course through him from the centuries of powerful wizards and witches that had all sat in this very seat. Running his fingers over the smooth wood before him, he couldn’t help but notice the piles of unattended paperwork and letters to the side. Smirking at the thought of the stressed headmaster spending majority of his time lately trying to locate him; very unsuccessfully at that.
"And how do you even know tha-" Fred started to ask before being cut off.
Scanning the windows as well as the grounds, Harry felt it was safe enough to go back inside. He ran while staying as low to the ground as possible. Nodding in satisfaction when he reached the door within seconds, knowing it will be an easy run to Parker on his way out. He paused briefly to control his breathing before he opened the door once more. Sticking to the right side of the hallway, Harry made his way along it towards the staircase.
“Long story,” he simply responded, staring right back at her.
“Best way to leave would be to go through the front door,” Harry whispered. “It’s the closet exit without apparating.”
The door was opened finally and the man stumbled blindly inside the completely dark house until he reached the light switch. Harry immediately stood up from his spot, walking across the street with his head down. He briefly paused as he saw Steven walk towards the open front door to close it. Shaking his head slightly, he watched the man yawn before lazily shutting it. Continuing to walk, he quickly makes his way to the closest window. Hugging his body to the wall, he peered in to the still dining room. Seeing no sign of Steven, Harry quickly scoped out the rest of the place from where he could see. A brightly lit kitchen was in the far back and the entrance hall to the left of the room showed the bottom of the stair case.
Nodding in satisfaction with his new plan, Harry leant down to roughly grabbed Steven's right arm. He barely managed to rotate it enough in the tight grasp of the ropes. He placed the tip of the blade halfway up the forearm before digging it in and easily slicing a deep cut into the skin. Massive amounts of blood immediately poured out from the cut, seeping on to the floor and staining it a deep crimson colour. Knowing he was almost done, Harry swiftly repeated the same action on the left forearm. He stood up and wiped the slight sweat away from his forehead.
followed by a
“What took you so long to turn off the alarm?” Fred suddenly asked, causing the others to nod as they wanted to know.
“You can ask,” he nodded with a blank face. “But that does not mean I will answer.”
“Did you have any idea the entire wizarding world was looking for you?” she asked, tilting her head, placing her fork down.
All three boys chuckled at the sight of a red cheeked Ginny. She quickly looked up the stairs before angrily turning around and leaning in closer to her brothers. Her face getting close to the same shade as her fiery, red hair.
“Now that everyone is awake, I shall begin,” Harry smirked. “Vernon. I’m going to hurt you.”
Shaking his head with a dark chuckle, Harry threw himself backwards. He placed his arms under his head as his eyes focused back on the stars. Drew made no sign to move, instead turning his head to stare ahead at the empty field.
"Thank you Sir," Harry smiled as he grabbed the small bag and pocketed it.
“I’ll be taking my leave now,” Severus spoke in to the mostly silent room, soft voices floating down from upstairs.
“You are pathetic,” she snarled, glaring down her nose at her nephew with disgust. “How hard is it to declutter the overgrown garden, huh, boy?”
“I am,” he sighed, rolling over and grabbing the mirror from his bedside table.
“Little brat,” he laughed as he ruffled the messy mop of hair. “I’ll have my mirror with me for the next few days. Just call me through that if you need anything at all.”
"Steven Riggs," Harry murmured out loud. "Let's see what you've done to seal your fate."
"Now, I'll tell you what will happen next," Harry spoke up as he was pacing backwards and forwards at Steven's feet. "I don't normally tell my victims this, but considering it'll be my last mission for a while, why not tell you your fate."
Harry leaned back in his chair, awaiting to hear the plan. He hoped that deep down it would include some type of revenge on some of the people that abandoned or hurt him. Mainly the Dursley’s. But that was not limited to just them. Dumbledore and some of the others tasked to ‘
Staying on the top step, Harry leaned forwards and placed his ear against the door. He stilled his breathing as he listened for any signs of life on the other side. After half a minute, he felt it was safe enough to open the door and begin their slow escape. Within a nod to Parker, Harry slowly turned the door knob, pushed it ajar slightly and peaked his head out to scout the surrounding areas.
Once again, the pocket knife vibrated in his hand for a second before lifting in to the air. Harry watched as it travelled across the hallway and to the left, heading towards the second nearest door on that side. He was grateful to notice how close the door seemed to be the front door. Looking around the hallway, he followed the pocket knife carefully, a little nervous to have his back to the room where the small group currently were.
“I am sure you’ll do great,” she smiled. “And how are you feeling about starting Hogwarts?”
say my name in that filthy mouth of yours,” Petunia spat as she roughly pushed Harry into the wall, smirking as he fell to his hands and knees.
Landing back on the ground near his abandoned weaponry, Harry put his broomstick away for the second time as he breathed in the calming fresh air. Looking down at his neatly laid out armoury, he decided on changing up his practice to let out the frustration quicker. He squatted down and traced his finger along the sharp hell, along the edge, all the way to the tip and then to the point. He applied pressure, smirking as the Push Dagger’s point pierced the skin of his pointer finger.
Silence. Silence is what he asked for, and silence is what he got. Everyone had felt the wave of magic wash through them as the eldest member in the room yelled. It was full of rage, full of hate, full of anger. Never had they felt that from the Headmaster before. No one dared to speak another word, nor look at one another in fear of feeling that raw magic again.
“No, I’m really not,” shakily whispered Harry. “I just want to die. I’m a disgrace to everyone I know and a failure to everyone I try to impress. I just want to be left alone, to grieve for the loss of the people I loved most, yet I can’t even do that simple thing without being scolded or interrupted or, just, leave me alone. Alright?”
“Hmm?” soft green eyes turned to look at the small woman beside him. “What?”
Harry didn't say anything, instead letting the silence to linger between them. He was hoping that it would just drive Ron out of the room if he stayed quiet for long enough. Why could he not read the signs? It was pretty obvious that he didn't want to talk with him. So why was he still sitting there, thinking of something to talk about? Maybe he was encouraged to by his parents or one of his siblings.
“Well, yeah I guess,” he shrugged. “I guess if I need to keep up some type of a façade then I need to show some type of social skills with the other students. Or am I wrong.”
A soft sigh escaped Harry’s lips as he slowly closed his journal and placed it in his bed side table along with the quill and ink he was using. Looking around the silent room and sighing once again as he stood up and collected his towel, a fresh pair of underwear and pajama pants before shuffling his exhausted feet to the bathroom.
And just like that, Drew was left alone on the roof top. He looked around the surrounding area illuminated softly by the moonlight, a scene of serenity filled his eyes and ears. He felt a sense of relief at how well the night had just gone. He looked at number 4 Privet Drive one last time to find all of the lights had been turned off. Not needing to be there anymore, he apparated from the spot and headed straight to the property.
“I want to help,” said a shaky voice from the back. “It’s the least I can do.”
With a resigned shake of his head, he walked back over to his desk. Grabbing his mokeskin pouch, he tied the drawstrings through a loop on his pants where belts normally sit. He hung it off a loop to the right side, so it was out of the way of most of his movements. Harry sighed heavily as he grabbed his first small knife, attaching it to his bicep with the aid of magic. Repeating the same with his other small knife, before grabbing the first set of six throwing knives. He squatted down, pulled up the pants to reveal his tanned skin and attached the holster tightly around his ankle. Covering them with the pants, he reached up and blindly fumbling around until he found the second set of six throwing knives. Quickly switching legs, he attached the holster on top of the pants instead, but just as tightly wrapped as the other one was.
Harry couldn’t help but be intrigued by the lone man. Of course he had done a lot of research on every Order member, but there was limited information when it came to Severus Snape. He would love to know what dark spells the other had created, only releasing a few deemed acceptable for society. Harry weighed up his options in that moment. He knew he wanted to learn more about the man, and he could do that by slightly gracing the surface through Legilimency. But could he risk being caught if the man was more advanced in Occlumency than the reports showed. Deciding that he only lived once and also had the option of escaping quickly if need be, he prepared to use some Legilimency.
“Nothing Uncle,” his body drawing in on itself, eyes darting everywhere trying to find an escape route.
Moving the tip of the knife, he dragged it up along Steven's left leg, running over the thin ropes holding him in place. He came to a stop right next to his pelvis, sweat pouring down his victim's face as he saw where the knife was. Harry smirked before retracting the knife and watching the wide brown eyes.
“We’ll agree to disagree,” he shook his head as he stared back down at his gift in amazement.
', using his shoe to close the door behind him. Not looking back, he continued walking away from the house, heading directly to the bench he had previously been sitting on. He sat down and in the quiet of the night, begun removing all traces that he had even been in or near that house. He removed his DNA that had been spread everywhere, off of items as well as Steven's body. He concentrated on erasing any footprints that may have been ingrained into the carpet or anywhere near the crime scene. Lastly, he recalled his magical residue. The process taking a little longer since he had performed more magic here.
Standing still in shock, Remus played over the entire interaction he had just had with Harry. The younger male had left such an interesting first impression on him around the first time and he did not disappoint this time around either. The way he had conducted himself the whole conversation was breathtakingly spectacular. He had never seen a young person so in control of things in his entire life. Harry was in control of the conversation, the topics, the mood, his emotions, his reactions; it was truly incredible.
“I’m not here to make friends. I am here to defeat Voldemort,” Harry sighed.
“Little bastard!” yelled Lucius in a fit of rage. “Where are you? Show yourself you little coward!”
The disturbing kitchen scene faded and the three found themselves, unbeknownst to them, in the last memory Harry was willing to offer. Small, little Harry sat in a bare bedroom that was obviously used as a storage space. He sat in the far corner with a book clutched in his hands, eyes lit with wonder as he scanned the pages as fast as he could. The boy looked so different then in all the other memories. There was a carefree aura around Harry as he relaxed in the corner. Expressions lit his face as he audibly reacted out loud while he read.
Looking around while perched on the side of the building, Harry located the small group over to the right. His eyes widen as he saw all of the lift in to the air on their broomsticks and speedily start to head towards the building, weaving and ducking around each other. Keeping his cool, yet knowing he needed to act fast, Harry pushed off the wall and swung his whole body to the left. He watched as the window got further away before it rapidly came back towards him. Pointing his feet and inclining his body slightly to be more vertical, Harry let go of the rope while at the same time jerking his body forwards.
. Now with the two of them out cold, Drew could manoeuvre them to a position that would set the scene and not give away his devious presence to the stupid Order members. He levitated Vernon a few inches off the bed before rotating him to face his wife. With the heavy lump back down, Drew approached Petunia. He placed the butchers knife and his wand on the bedside table before he manually turned her over in bed to lay flat on her back. He chuckled to himself as he thought about how even a man his size would have broken his back trying to move Vernon.
"No Sir," whispered Fletcher, eyes cast down. "There is no evidence, no magical trace, nothing. My best guess is that we are dealing with extremely powerful wizards or assassins."
Soon enough more members begun appearing via different methods. Some apparating, some flooing and some even simply walking up to the office if they were already at Hogwarts. The large, spacious room suddenly became cramped with each new arrival. They stood almost shoulder to shoulder in quiet, although a certain red headed family couldn’t grasp the understanding of quietness. All eyes were eagerly looking at Headmaster Dumbledore, the leader of the Order of the Phoenix, the only current person to defend them all from the Dark Lord.
Harry stepped back and started closing the door before a hand stopped it for the second time that day. Restraining himself from the rage building up inside, he swore he wouldn’t be able to contain it if Hermione had yet again blocked his door from closing. Slowly opening it back up again, he glared daggers at Bill Weasley who had been the culprit.
With his hood hanging low over his face, Harry continued to stay alert on the bench as he waited for Steven Riggs to come home from his shift at work. The minutes ticked by slowly, yet the young man never twitched a muscle. He trained himself to stay perfectly still to avoid drawing attention his way from any possible onlookers. His eyes moved to the left side as a car turned in to the end of the street. He watched as it slowly manoeuvred through the heavily parked traffic, before pulling up in to a spare spot not far from the target's house.
“How did you not know?” interrupted Minerva, collecting her breath momentarily to speak. “Why did you let that happen to him?”
call me little,” Draco snarled, taking a threatening step forwards and looming ominously above the shaking elf.
“Safe,” Harry whispered, looking at Parker with a soft smile.
Earnt it his arse. The fat pig had never done a productive thing in his life, let alone be a good student. Harry had done his research on them all. He had seen the school report cards, the complaints from neighbours, the police reports on Dudley, the client claims of disrespect or mishandling from Vernon’s business. This family was probably the most hated one in town. Which made Harry very happy indeed.
“Severus?” Dumbledore moved on before anyone else could say anything else on the matter. “Which days can you do?”
“What is what like?” asked Ron in return, dumbfounded by the sudden interest.
“Your friend, Ronald,” Malfoy started, which made Harry stop sobbing and snap his head around to try and detect the lie Malfoy was speaking, “he gave me a journal and said that whenever you would write in your own journal, I would have my own copy of it. He wanted me to find something to embarrass you with so he could stop being your friend. I’m so sorry, Harry. I want to punch everyone and take you away to a safe place; a place where no one will ever hurt your feelings or ever make fun of who you are again. Please let me do that,” Malfoy looked deep into the emerald eyes and allowed a small smile grace his pale face as Harry gave a small nod of his own.
“It was my first time conducting it,” Harry rolled his eyes. “Give me a break.”
“Unknown,” he sighed. “I sent him on a mission to find the diary. I believe the last known location was Wiltshire, England. And as we know, a known follower of the Dark Lord Voldemort, Lucius Malfoy, has a property there. Begin your investigation there and work your way around any possible locations until he is found. I want a report by midnight otherwise I will come hunting for you.”
With eyes closed, he focused on the location in his mind before apparating the next second. He opened his eyes to find he successfully travelled to the outskirts of Hogwarts. Towering over him was the Main Entrance Gates of Hogwarts herself, the wrought iron shining in the moonlight. At either side of the gates sat two winged boards, looking over the entrance, ready to protect when the time arose. Harry looked around from where he stood, a plan formulating in his head without any effort. Not far from the gates were a small group of bushes, perfect for hiding behind.
“Thank you very much, I appreciate it,” Harry smiled at her. “Good night, Mrs. Weasley.”
“I know what you’ve been doing to yourself, Harry,” Malfoy said as he slowly stood from the bed he had been sitting on. “I know what your relatives do to you. I know how you are feeling right now and I know what you are thinking right now.”
The room looked towards the family with confusion, while Harry turned his head and smirked at the panic he had created by leaving by himself. Dumbledore stood up slowly with a frown upon his face. While the confused silence continued as the Weasley’s stepped further into the room, Harry noticed both of the twins suddenly look over his way. An impressed look briefly passed both of their faces before they simply shook their heads and turned to the conversation that was happening.
“I have come to tell you the rumours and talk that’s been going around the Ministry lately,” Kingsley cleared his throat nervously. “There are rumours suggesting You-Know-Who is back.”
The twins eyes lit up as they immediately stood up and made their way upstairs to retrieve the other three. As Molly was dishing the last serve of the eggs and quickly tiding up the kitchen with a spell, Ron was looking at her with sad puppy dog eyes. Any time there had been an Order meeting lately, he did the same routine hoping his parents would give in.
Only a few people had arrived so far, the office swamped in a tense silence as he stepped in. All eyes turned towards him as he stood off to the left, back against the wall so he could see everyone. Those that had come back to Hogwarts last night recognised him by the same clothing. Those that had not been there stared him up and down, looking for answers to the stranger in the room. Harry propped his foot on the wall behind him and crossed his arms across his chest. He stared at each person silently, carefully observing everything going on around him.
"Of course," he politely said as he sat tall in his chair. Rage bubbling under the surface.
“Lucius!” a high-pitched, piercing yell from nearby.
“I used a stupefy on Petunia and gave her a deep cut on the arm. No wards changed,” he continued on. “It is safe to say you can cause as much harm to them as you would like while they’re unconscious.”
"Are you meaning to tell us this has happened before?" Arthur said with a frown on his face.
Vernon Dursley gasped awake, wiggling under the weight of someone who sat upon him. Terror filled his eyes as tears mixed in with the blood running down his cheeks. An agonising pain was shooting all throughout his upper body. He looked up at the stranger that had bound him, trying to make out any details through his blurry vision. He managed to catch sight of the weapon that had obviously done so much damage, it was safely nowhere near his precious face anymore.
The group gradually made their way to the staircase that led to the main entrance. Dumbledore once again flicked the doors open as he approached without a word, a little harsher than he normally would as they slammed against the walls with a loud thud. Finding the opportunity, Harry stilled on the spot and watched carefully as they made their way inside the ginormous castle. As soon as the doors had fully closed, he pulled out the box from the inside of his coat once more. Grabbing out the broom and watching it expand before his eyes, he tried to calm the racing thoughts in his mind. Breathing out slowly as he pocketed the box, Harry reminded himself to treat this like any other usual mission.
“No, I don’t think that will be a good idea,” frowned Kingsley, thinking over all of the possible options.
“That won’t be a problem, dear,” nodded Molly before turning to look at Kinglsey and Alastor. “Can I make you some tea or something to eat before you leave as a thank you? You two have worked so hard this morning.”
The day had gone by without many more disturbances. Harry was left to himself for the most part, only being told food had been prepared downstairs if he wished to eat. He didn’t stay for long, only eating what would satisfy him for the time being. He took a book with him in hopes the others wouldn’t try to engage in conversation with him. Unfortunately it did not deter Molly or Ron enough, as he was forced to talk with them. Perhaps tomorrow he could take the food back up to his room to continue studying, his time was precious after all.
Kevin drew another long draw from his cigarette. As he exhaled it slowly up towards the moon, the young man quickly stabbed into the right side of his throat where the right carotid artery lay beneath the skin and covered his mouth firmly. Blood splattered over the grass as gurgling sounds came from the distressed man. The young man held Kevin firmly in place as he quickly pushed the knife further into the neck, cutting the vocal cords. The young man brought the blood ridden knife out with a grunt before he plunged it into the left side to get to the left carotid artery. Satisfied that both major blood vessels and vocal cords had been severed, the young man pinched Kevin's nose with the hand covering his mouth and begun to count the seconds that passed that Kevin was not able to breathe. Slowly Kevin begun to stop struggling in the hold and slipped into unconsciousness.
“Good night Drew,” he allowed himself to smile, knowing the other wasn’t raging mad at him. “I miss you too. Take care of Grayson for me.”
"Of course it won't," Drew reassured him. "You'll be able to come back on the team once this is all over."
Glass shattered in to the room as a fist sized hole appeared in the corner. After a few more hits above the hole, a crack shot out horizontally into the middle of the window from the corner. A sadistic smile crossed his face for a spilt second as he brought the hammer back and threw it with full force at the new weak point. Shards of glass poured down in all direction, covering not only the room but him as majority of the window broke. Thankfully his hoodie was covering his face, protecting his face from the sharp piece. He switched ends and used the leather handle to clear the bottom half of the window from the remaining shards still in place.
“Thank you, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry smiled back before closing the door softly.
Remus Lupin had his hand raised and looked around nervously as the room’s attention was drawn to him. The man looked eerily thin in his over-sized, brown trench coat. His light brown hair had flecks of grey throughout it, a sign that all of his stressful transformations had a toll on him. He looked older from all of the premature lines and scars that littered his face. Remus’s green eyes sheepishly looked over at Harry Potter, green staring at green. The older man shocked at how similar the boy’s eyes were to his mothers.
As for exits in the case of an emergency, on the ground floor he could flee through the back door or the window above the kitchen sink. Upstairs there were a few windows he could jump out of. Dudley’s bedroom as well as the spare bedroom both faced the backyard, meaning the windows were above the flower gardens and small bushes that Petunia so desperately tried to maintain for appearances only. He of course wouldn’t be attempting to run on foot tomorrow night. No. He would be apparating safely away to this spot. It wasn’t far enough away to drain his magical core while cleansing the area of his traces, and it had a excellent view advantage of the whole street.
“Now, I am very happy to stay on the couch, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry said as he turned back to the woman considering Dumbledore was currently stunned for words.
“Someone overheard the introduction, and in turn, a crowd begun trying to get to Harry,” Alastor continued the story. “He was immediately evacuated, not before a photo was taken of him however.”
The entire world quietened as Harry heightened all of his senses to be fully alert. Eyes were darting in every direction for any signs of danger or Drew. Something caught his attention from the corner of his left eye, a shimmer of a Disillusionment charm. He stayed still for a few seconds to see if there was any movement from the other, before he shot a nonverbal
"Disgusting," Harry pretend to gag, instantly smirking as Steven looked devastated and embarrassed.
“Let alone if anyone saw him leave with you, Ron and Ginny,” said Remus, pointing that out as well. “I think the Order really needs to talk about increased security here or a backup property if you are put in danger.”
The spell didn't take as much energy as beforehand since he said it verbally, taking some strain off of his magical core. Harry watched as Steven tried to talk once more before stray tears slipped down his blemished face. An understanding dawned upon the victim that he was going to soon slip away to never breathe again. Resignation filled his eyes as he turned his head away from his torturer, not wanting him to be the last thing he saw. Instead choosing to look at one of the many polaroid picture sprawled out beside him.
“Rennervate,” Harry whispered, the spell shooting out from the middle of his palm.
Finally Drew and Charlie reached their destination; Privet Drive, Little Whinging in Surrey. The two stood at the entrance of the street and stood there for a few seconds just observing the area. Drew was scoping out a safe spot to retreat to once the wards were activated, while Charlie was searching for any out of the ordinary things such as wards, charms or glamours. Drew pointed towards the house directly opposite from the Dursley’s house as he begun to walk.
“I will need a few Order members to head back to Diagon Alley and continue collecting the remaining school supplies for Harry,” Kingsley said loudly, gaining the attention from the large group.
"Now the business is over with, drop the formalities Harry," he chuckled, leaning forwards in his chair. "How are you going?"
“You do,” he said with a frown.
“Yes Mum,” Fred feigned apologetically, immediately turning his head away and smirked at Ginny vindictively.
Harry was genuinely interested in hearing what the twins had to say. Remaining his usual mysterious self, he nodded before turning around and opening the door to his room. He stood with the door open, watching the pair walk in with slight hesitance in their step. Once they were in, he shut the door ominously and immediately closed his eyes to concentrate erecting the wards around the room. What Harry missed with his eyes closed was the twins shivering at the immense power that coursed through the room.
Harry simply stood there as he watched the old man turn on his heels and make his own way out of the house. Once Molly had closed the door behind him, she motioned for Harry to follow her. She made her way into the living room where a bunch of mismatched furniture were occupied by a number of redheads. They had obviously dispersed from the doorway upon seeing their mother come there way, not wanting to get on her bad side at this time of night.
Harry sighed tiredly as he begun to peruse the rest of the documents. Like the Requester had said, there was indeed all that information for him to read through. This was more detail than most people ever went in to. He was thoroughly impressed. Half of his mind wondered who the hell this person was while the other half wondered why they just didn't kill this guy themselves. Obviously they weren't confident they would get away with it. Hence why Harry, Drew and the rest of the group were there for. To kill the bad people that tormented the world, to reap the rewards, and to get that sweet revenge for the victims. This case didn't seem that hard. For the most part, half of his work had already been done. Now all he had to do was study the man's schedule and kill him.
“They just want to be left alone,” Arthur said with a massive sigh. “I’ve cleaned her cut up as much as I could and made sure they all drunk a decent amount of the calming draught.”
Dumbledore started to lead the silent, gloomy group up the path towards the magnificent castle. Seeing his opportunity, Harry slowly stood up. He instantly stilled as black eyes roamed the area for which he stood in. Senses on high alert and his wand at the ready to slid into his hand in a millisecond, as the one and only Severus Snape combed the bushes and the nearby area for the source of the sound he had heard. The tense few seconds finally passed as the Potion Professor turned on his heel and caught up with the back of the group with his long, quick strides. A heavy sigh left his lips once the immediate danger had passed, making his way out of the bush as stealthily as he could.
“Of course we did,” Drew smiled back, happy to see the other happy. “Did you expect much else from us?”
“Fred, George, go get your older brothers and your father,” Molly spun around, wiping her sweaty hands on her apron. “Ron make sure you are looking after Ginny. You two are not allowed to leave until we come back.”
“Somewhere,” he shrugged nonchalantly.
“Percy is the only one of my son’s that is not here. But this is Bill and Charlie,” Molly pointed to her two eldest children across the room. “Ron, who is your age. And my only sweet, little daughter Ginny.”
“Honestly,” sighed Harry as he focused back to the present, “It’s not going great. I can’t be left alone at all with at least three people intruding my space each day. From sunrise to long after sunset, there is noise throughout the entire house. The children of the family are trying to get to know me, and some of the prejudice is seeping in already with their Gryffindor background. I reckon they’ll try and convince me to believe certain things before I go to Hogwarts.”
“All upstairs,” Drew whispered extremely quietly. “Kitchen first then we’ll go find the adults.”
"You knew my name before I was introduced to you," George finished, the both of them carefully watching the other boy’s reaction.
"Do we have a deal or not?" asked Fred with an irritated huff.
All three watched on in confusion as the lady passed through them and headed back into the hallway, instead of going into the kitchen and making the annoying child breakfast. Petunia stopped next to the cupboard under the stairs and banged her fist on the door three times. Dumbledore gulped, knowing exactly what was about to happen. He avoided eye contact with the confused looks Minerva and Severus were shooting at him. The door was swung open and Petunia reached in, as she pulled out the frail child by the scruff of his hair, one loud gasp and one barely audible inhale came from beside him. Dumbledore dared not look at his colleagues, fearing they see how unsurprised this scene was to him.
The further he continued to read, the angrier he was getting by the second. That Weasley boy had managed to undo all of his hard work with a few words. By this time tomorrow, the entire wizarding world will know Harry Potter is alive and back. Everything was out of his control thanks to that blasted Weasley brat. There was nothing he could do to prevent what was about to happen.
I am very nervous for you all to read this chapter. Please give your honest thoughts on it. Ahhh /hides in shyness/. Thanks for your patience and please leave a comment so I know I'm doing okay.
“Are you nervous about what the Daily Prophet will show this morning?” Molly broke the silence, sparing a quick glance at him.
“And this is my husband, Arthur,” she finished pointing out her last family member in the room.
on the front of the wrapping paper. Smiling he opened the gift cautiously, finding inside an array of books on different subjects. He could tell just by looking at them how old they were, no doubt costing the youngster a lot.
“Alright, let’s get you inside. I’m sure Draco is worried about you,” Severus said as he stood up and helped the young man to his feet.
“Sure. Now can I go back to what I was doing? Fred, George, I promise I will seek you out when I am ready to see the products. And for merlin’s sake, don’t try and come in my room ever again or I’ll add hexes,” he said in a no nonsense tone before shutting the door in all five faces.
“Ah Drew?” Harry tentatively asked.
"Yes, well you see," Dumbledore stumbled over his words a little before clearing his throat. "I have put in place wards to alert us if they are in danger. Wards that generally are meant for alerting if it is a foreign person they do not know of that is causing them harm. However, sometimes the fear is so great that the wards are triggered by a case of domestic dispute within the household."
"Yes Sir," Harry immediately responded and sat on the chair to his right.
Landing on the roof with nothing more than a mere soft thud, Drew crouched down beside Charlie. They hid on the other side of the roof, behind the crest so they were almost completely out of view from the street below. He closed his eyes and begun to draw back any of his DNA, magical energy or magical signature that had been left behind. A tingling sensation filled his chest to let him know the process was complete and the Dursley house was clean of any evidence he had been there.
“Oh, thank you dear!” Molly turned around and walked over to give her a hug. “I’ll make you some lunch or dinner when you return, for all of your troubles.”
Dumbledore’s cheeks flushed red in anger, not believing the fool before him that was obviously trying to trick them all. There was no way that this was the missing boy they had desperately been searching for. There was no way he would just appear out of thin air, randomly, without a trace all these years. He wouldn’t be allowing such disrespect in his office, let alone the fact the stranger had been sitting at his desk of all places; no one sat at his desk.
Harry landed with his right hand out, aiding to stop his body overshooting his land. His left foot and right knee on the ground and the leather cloak wrapping around his body from the sudden halt. He looked back quickly knowing he didn’t have long to get out of the way. Running to the nearest corner to the window, Harry had just enough time to control his slightly elevated breathing before five people flew through the opened window. Stilling his body and calming his breath to nothing, his eyes observed every single inch of movement from the group.
Harry shook his head in amusement, a fond and rare smile settled on his face. He too sat down on his bed. However he sat with his back to Drew, hunched over with his hands in his hair. He was still half asleep despite the sudden surprise attack. Ever since he had started training with Drew, he would plan these surprise attacks randomly to prepare him for anything. It was a fun way to keep Harry on his toes. Alert and ready always.
"Nothing more than where we were three years ago," the tall man said immediately.
A hand stopped the door from closing completely. He rolled his eyes before opening the door back up. Harry stared at Hermione in boredom, wondering why some people couldn’t understand no meaning no. And apparently this girl also didn’t know how to respect a thing called personal space either like the rest of this household.
“And how do you know that I have a pensive?” Dumbledore finally spoke.
Harry walked over to the window and opened it up, feeling the cold afternoon air hit his face. A small smile appeared on his face as he climbed onto the windowsill. Throwing a Disillusionment Charm over himself, he jumped out of the open window. Placing the broom between his legs as he free-fell. No longer hurtling towards the ground, he guided himself forwards towards the tree line.
"You tell us and we will owe you one favour," said George as they turned their attention back to Harry.
“No need to stress. He is safe where he is, and if anything happens, we will be there quickly,” she tried to reassure him, placing a soft hand on his bicep.
“Ah, which room is he staying in?” he asked nervously.
“That entry was very innovative of you,” Drew broke the silence after a few minutes. “Ten points for creativity. However minus five for tardiness.”
Harry shrugged and asked in a quiet voice for a cup of tea. He sat down in the middle of the couch and leaned back, relaxing and letting the sound of the fire crackling and popping in the background. Malfoy sat down next to him and order a cup of tea and a cup of coffee from a house elf. Once the tea’s appeared, the boy’s sipped on their beverages in silence.
"I did not call this meeting for meaningless chitter chatter," he growled out with barely contained anger. "I called this meeting in hopes of hearing some news on our current situation. Time is of the essence. You all know as well as I how important it is to find the boy."
Once again, Vernon gasped as he was forcefully awoken for the second time. He weakly lifted his head to try and find the damage done to him. Although his giant belly prevented him from seeing his hand that was tied to his side. He frantically looked up at the callous smile that was firm on his nephew’s face. He didn’t need to be told what had happened since he passed out, he knew he was missing a finger. He could feel the warm liquid gushing against the rest of his remaining fingers.
“Did you leave somewhere? Is that why the window is open?” George continued the interrogation.
His room seemed so empty with the missing items he was taking with him. Seeing the gaps on his bookshelf and half of his wardrobe missing, pained him. His heart sunk as he walked over to his wardrobe. He stared blankly at his only remaining black, leather clock, not wanting to put it on as it would mean one step closer to departing. Yet Harry had to push his nerves and sentiment aside for the time being, he needed to be focused. He could always grieve once he was successfully in the wizarding world, surrounded by the blundering idiots. Already dressed in his black shirt, long black pants, and thick black boots, he completed his look with the signature cloak. Reluctantly he walked over to his wardrobe before he draped the clock around his shoulders, fastening the clasp around his neck.
“Reveal yourself. Now,” Severus said louder and more aggressively, irritated his demand was rudely ignored the first time.
Everything paused as Harry looked at Drew with unwavering concentrated eyes, looking out for any movements that could result in a threat towards him. The seconds passed by slowly until the silent air was filled by a roaring laughter from the Scottish male. Drew looked down at the knife with an unfazed expression, moving his right hand over to pull out the offending weapon without a grimace. He stood up from where he knelt, walked over to Harry and held out the handle of the weapon for him to take.
“You boys are overreacting,” Pansy laughed as she walked out of the room and headed upstairs. “This is an old house. Old houses generally making a lot of noise.”
', much to the dismay and shock of Steven. Harry pulled off the lock and discarded it to the side, smirking the whole time at the stunned expression stuck firmly on his victim's face.
It was the next moments that would forever define his life, his existence, his fate. Voldemort turned his wand on Harry, no remorse in the cold eyes. The green curse leaving the wand for it to only engulf the entire room as it rebounded. In that moment, a part of Voldemort’s already utterly fractured soul, once more split and attached itself to him. Those actions leading him to be the first known ‘Human Horcrux’ in history. From that moment on, Harry lived with a piece of Voldemort within him. Harbouring it for years to come until the fatefully encounter with Drew. The older making it a priority to purge the dark, foreign soul from the scared, young boy he took in. He openly made it his mission to shelter the younger from the impending war until he was properly healed and properly trained.
Charlie nodded as he walked back to the doorway, keeping a look out for his boss. He didn’t just keep a look out on those two things, he also kept checking back on him to ensure he was okay and didn’t need assistance. He was nervous to immediately leave once the wards changed, leaving him behind. But he knew that if anyone could handle a situation like this and get out scot free that it was Drew McIntyre.
"Some of us have problems with the way things are being handled," Minerva spoke up as she stepped forward in front of the group. "We would like to talk about a few things."
Taking one last look beneath him, Harry slowly lowered the top half of his body until he was completely horizontal to the side of the building. Each step he took down was lost entirely in the surrounding noises of the nocturnal animals and the soft noise of the leaves being brushed together. He tried to descend quickly but caution took the best of him, afraid of being caught in a such an exposed position. Relief washed through him momentarily as his right foot touched the grass. With both feet firmly and safely on the ground, he crouched down as the rope disappeared. His wand fell in to his opened palm, his fingers wrapping around it securely.
Harry grabbed the Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide Disinfectant spray bottle from under the sink as well as some paper towel. He turned off the tap and quickly wiped down the wet blade with a sheet of paper towel. Harry then sprayed a decent amount of the disinfectant on the knife to kill any bacteria, viruses, blood-borne pathogens or any other nasty cells that could cause harm if he was to accidentally cut himself or someone other than his target. Not that it had ever happened before. But he was taught to always prepare for the absolute worst case scenario.
What he saw almost made him jump if he had not been so in control of his body reactions. Floating in mid-air, less than an inch from his eyeball, was his Blackhawk Tatang knife. It was dangerously close to his iris that if he had moved, it would have indeed pierced the surface. Leaning back, he shook his head before snatching the offending weapon from thin air. Hearing the dark chuckle from above him, Harry looked up at Drew with anger. He stood up from the ground and placed his knife carefully in his leg holster.
Draco smirked as he puffed his chest proudly, looking down at the elf with revulsion burning in his eyes. Throwing his broom carelessly on his massive bed and gesturing his head to the side, his friends followed his actions. While none of them could see him, they sure could sense him. The hairs on their arms and back of necks all stood up as a powerful, yet subtle wave of magic washed over them. Harry was shaking in anger at the mistreatment he had just witnessed.
The room only got louder and louder. Everyone was eager to put their own two cents into the situation. Dumbledore felt like his head was about to explode from the sudden increase in volume. He could no longer concentrate on one person’s voice, instead it all just blended into a sound like the stamping of Hippogriffs.
“So what were you thinking back there, Ron?” Hermione broke the awkward silence, turning to look at the shy male that hadn’t spoken since Harry had left the room.
His stomach begun to churn as he reached forward, blindly feeling behind the books for the metal box. His fingers graced over a cold surface, signifying he had in fact found what he was looking for. Carefully pulling out the item, his eyes laid upon a dull grey box with a small, metal lock on it. He inspected the outside of the box to find nothing giving away the horror that laid within. Not wasting anymore time, Harry walked back over to the semi-unconscious male sprawled out on the ground.
“Albus,” Kingsley paused as he tried to look at anything but the other man. “It’s been almost five years since that duel and since you got rid of him. He’s come back once, what makes you think he would not have found another way back sooner than you thought?”
“I never said that, did I?” chuckled Drew, seeing the frustration on the younger’s face.
"Yes," Severus said without any hesitation.
The person that sat in front of Ron was not the person he thought The-Boy-Who-Lived would be. He thought that the Harry Potter he would eventually meet would be unsure of the world around him, perhaps even anxious and needing a new friend to rely on. He had always been prepared to take the boy under his wing to help him adjust to the wizarding world and help guide him through their years at Hogwarts. After all The-Boy-Who-Lived was always being brought up in conversation between all of the Gryffindor boys.
"We must have hope, Molly," Dumbledore said softly. "If we lose the only hope we have, we will never find him in time."
“I know that I’ll probably be an outcast. That I won’t fit in with the students,” Harry spoke up before the other could continue.
Harry was smirking up at his target, soaking in the face of a scared man. Without saying anything, he released his wand from its holster and caught it smoothly with his hand. Feeling the adrenaline start to kick in, he focused his mind on the mission. His dark, green electric eyes stared unwavering into Steven's worried brown eyes. The two men stood still, waiting for the best moment to make the first move. Steven briefly glanced down at the protruding wand, a look of confusion flashing across his face for only the briefest of moments. And in the next second he begun to rush down the stairs, straight towards Harry.
"Can we speak to you?" George was the first to snap out of the small daze they were in.
“Is something wrong Draco?” a female voice asked, presumably Pansy.
“Sneaky bastard, he is,” shaking his head in amusement, Fred looked at his twin with a shimmer in his eyes. “We still haven’t worked out how he got there.”
Nodding, Harry quietly begun cooking the bacon in one of the free pans on the stove top. He was grateful to be doing something productive instead of just sitting and watching her cook. All he had been doing since arriving at the Burrow was reading, studying and fending off annoying questions. It felt good to be contributing to the household he was staying at as well as keeping his mind off the future.
"I agree," his brother George nodded as he shifted on his bed to lie down. "For someone that went missing for eleven years, he is very cool, calm and collected. I expected him to be timid if he was ever found."
“There was this one witch saying she had photographic evidence that he is alive,” continued Nymphadora with ease. “She was yelling for everyone to look out for the article in the Daily Prophet tomorrow.”
“Muggle world?” he asked once more.
"Are you sure?" Drew asked, already knowing Harry was set in his way.
Drew leaned back in his chair, contemplating everything. He shrugged his shoulders as he tiredly ran a hand down his face. Harry picked up the diary and started to examine it. Suddenly a vital piece of information resurfaced to the front of his mind.
“May I ask something first?” Nymphadora said from her seat.
The room started to blur slightly and morphed until the three of them were standing in the lounge room where not only hours before had Vernon Dursley been tied up and dead in the middle of the floor. Now the fat walrus of a man was lounging back in a chair with his bunioned feet resting in the air, watching whatever braindead show was on the television. Petunia sat on the couch with a straight back, quietly knitting away to herself, occasionally looking up at the boxy television. The quiet of the evening was soon interrupted as their son waddled into the living room with a loud, obnoxious cry followed closely by a terrified looking Harry.
“There is no need to worry,” Dumbledore told them in an assuring tone. “He is here.”
“Stay close,” Malfoy whispered over his shoulder. “Especially when we get to the dungeons, who knows who’s lurking around down there right now.”
“Why not?” George asked.
The sun was setting slowly behind the tree line, light still illuminating the fields of tall grass surrounding him. A deep calm overcame him as he caught his breath. Harry wondered to himself how long he had been out flying for as he looked around the quiet grounds. He had decided to burn off some nervous energy after sorting everything in to piles ready for tomorrow. It would have to be well and truly over two hours that he had been out here, just flying. The tranquillity of being outside by himself helped him relax his previously racing mind. Being able to just do the movements without needing to think, without needing to focus, was a skill he had required over time.
Walking out of the strong smelling Apothecary store, Remus and Nymphadora checked this list of shops they needed to visit. Rereading the list, they both sighed knowing they had finally finished the exhausting task. Neither of them remembering the process for their own school days being this tiring. Although, it may have something to do with the fact they were shopping for three people and not just themselves. Some supplies would be shipped closer to the time, but many supplies they had to carry around with them. Both grateful for the charms that make the task easier.
"Of course," the young man replied, taking his cloak off. "Would you expect anything else from me?"
Harry didn’t want to linger on what could have been, so he turned his attention back to the present, turning around and hopping in to the steamy shower. Warm water flowed down his body, instantly relaxing him. Breathing in and out through his mouth as he just stood there in silence, not even a thought floating through his mind. Goosebumps rose on his arms at the calming sensation. Seconds turning into minutes, slowly waking his sleepy mind.
“Surprised to see I am still here?” Hermione tilted her head slightly at the stare she received.
“Thank you Drew,” he said, looking up with a massive smile on his face. “I can’t believe you did this.”
“Lived with it? Meaning you no longer have it in you?” Minerva asked, picking up on the hint.
“None of this information leaves this room. And you three,” Dumbledore was addressing the Aurors, “keep all of this under the table until we decide how to move forwards during another meeting,” his icy blue eyes scanned the room dangerously.
With a knowing smile on her face, Molly turned around to replenish the egg pile that her children had eagerly dug into. She had to make sure the rest of the household had food to eat upon waking up. Especially her new guest that was still upstairs. Molly allowed her mind to wander on last night’s events. Her stomach churning at the sight of the young man’s uncle brutalised and deceased in the family’s living room. The news would have to be broken to the young man sooner rather than later. Part of her wondered how much Harry remembered of his time with the Dursley’s.
As he reached the first floor, he was pulled out of the memories by a disapproving click of a tongue. His eyes laid upon Charlie Poole lazily lounging on one of the couches. The young lad was shaking his head with a cheeky, yet stern look on his face. Drew couldn’t help but chuckle at the antics of the other.
“This may not be convincing enough for some of you,” he continued, pushing off the wall and walking up beside Dumbledore’s desk. “Perhaps this will help clear the air. Perhaps we should ask someone who knows more than any of us do.”
“And,” drawled out Kingsley in barely restrained frustration, “we need to make sure you have no issue with adding Hermione to the list of people helping him. She is one of the brightest witches of her age. Molly has already offered for her to stay with them for the remainder of the summer.”
"Report?" the other said after finally putting down his pen, clasping his hands together and looking up at Harry with a serious expression.
"I am fine Drew," Harry sighed as he rolled his eyes.
"How do we know he is even alive?" a small voice asked from the back of the room.
If there was only one thing he wanted to get out of this meeting tonight, then it would be that Voldemort is back and the search for Harry Potter needed to resume with more intensity than ever before. If any of these baffling baboons wanted to live a happy and long life, they needed to get through their thick skulls that the boy wasn’t dead and is the only hope for the wizarding world. He knew that time was of the essence, it was quickly starting to run out. Yet no one seemed to give a damn except himself.
“We can try and help fill in any gaps since Harry will be living with us,” Arthur said after no one else indicated they wanted to help.
Easily sliding his wand down in to his right hand, Harry inspected the shiny surface of the sword. He concentrating hard on how he needed to morph the metal into a hammer. Once he envisioned exactly what the objected needed to transform into, he raised his wand and carefully moved it in the air. He waved it in the precise motion he had been taught and finishing smoothly with the tip facing the hammer. A beam of red light engulfed the Cinquedea sword until it could no longer be seen. Harry could feel the girth of the leather handle thicken in his hand slowly. Within seconds the red light evaporated and before him, in his very own hands, was a hammer.
"You did, yes," said George as they both looked expectantly at the other. "How did you know?"
Picking up the book, he opened it up to the handwritten note. A smile appeared on his face as Harry ran his fingers over the words on the page. He tried to compose himself as he read and re-read the words before him. ‘To My Big Brother, Save The World, Love Gray.’ was written in elegant and familiar writing. His heart clenched, his breath hitched, his eyes watered. Everything he was thinking before was reinforced from those nine words. Harry needed to think back on these words whenever it all got too much.
“We were going to see,” said Fred, turning from his twin to Harry.
Drew turned to Harry slowly, his dark brown eyes holding all of the emotions the quiet man was experiencing. The older wizard conjured two chairs from books that lay nearby. He gestured for Harry to sit as he, himself lowered his tired looking body down.
“Fumos,” Harry whispered under his breath, dodging out of the way of a white coloured spell.
“Finding someone that has the free time will be a challenge, will it not?” he asked as he looked up to the taller.
“Anything else you wish to discuss?” Dumbledore said with a strained smile.
“How can I say no to that face,” Molly sighed in defeat before summoning her spare apron for the boy to wear. “Here you go dear.”
Satisfied that the memories he added would shock them all enough into believing he was the one and only Harry Potter, he stepped back and gestured for the three to come forwards. Harry watched Dumbledore, Severus and Minerva all enter the pensive, the latter with a reluctant last look towards him. Twirling his wand in his hand, he looked around the circular office, intrigued by the many gadgets that littered the spindly tables. He knew they would be a while, so why not explore the office whilst he waited? His eyes caught sight of an old and battered hat sitting on the shelves behind the Headmaster’s desk. Its exterior frayed and extremely dirt, with parts of its brown material patched together.
No one dared to mutter a word, instead they nodded their heads wordlessly. Dumbledore waved his hand and chairs appeared for them all to sit on. It was in fact going to be a long meeting with a lot to discuss and a lot of plans to put in place. Satisfied that no one was going to speak out of turn, Dumbledore walked back over to his desk and sat down in his chair. He looked at the members and internally chuckled at the visible fear shown from most of them.
“Can you remember if there were any sewers nearby?” he asked, knowing the answer already.
Chills were sent down majority of the member’s spines at the darkness seeping from their leader. They shuddered at yet another wave of relentless raw magic lashing out at them. The group stayed silent and avoided eye contact with Albus Dumbledore, waiting for him to tell them what to do instead of working as a unanimous team to reach the same end goal; Getting rid of Voldemort.
“We need to find Harry Potter,” Dumbledore continued loudly, trying to be heard over the noise. “I have a proposed plan for our searches.”
The second the door was closed, Harry let his guard down slightly. He let the smile drop to be replaced by a tired look. Rolling his head in a circular motion, he wandlessly erected a silencing charm upon the room as well as locking the door for the night. He felt he could at least relax a little easier knowing his charms would hold. Well, except for if Bill Weasley tried to enter. Having no doubt the eldest child would easily get in with his extensive knowledge as a Curse-Breaker.
“Seems sketchy to attempt for my second time,” Harry laughed.
“I fear we may need to investigate the 12 Grimmauld Place option sooner than anticipated, Headmaster,” Alastor spoke up when the silence dragged on.
“Where are you thinking, my dear boy?” asked Dumbledore with caution.
“The fat whale is peeing,” Drew leaned over to whisper in Charlie’s ear.
“There’s not much you can do except let him do that at this point in time,” said Drew. “He needs to learn to trust you and know you are the real deal.”
“That’s impossible,” gasped Molly, the first one to find a voice after the shock revelation.
With his thin, black shirt and long, black pants on that hugged his body in all the right places, Harry shrugged on his leather cloak. Wrapping it around his shoulders and clasping it in place around his neck. Opening his holster drawer, he picked up the first one which was his wand holster. He flicked aside his cloak as he held out his right arm. As soon as the holster was adjusted in to place, Harry used his magic to nonverbally attach it to his forearm. He repeated the process for his two bicep holsters before manually attaching the calf holster to his right leg.
With that, the other pulled out a small bag of cash and placed it on the desk.
The detestably loud rumbling brought Harry out of his thoughts while it also filled the previously peaceful surrounding streets. Harry chuckled darkly as he watched multiple neighbours angrily storm up to their open windows, glaring in the direction of the offending car before almost simultaneously closing them. Never before had he witnessed such a collective dislike for one family in his life as right now in this small town of Little Wellington.
Holding up his hand, he beckoned for the boy to come up. Looking towards him with a false smile, he quickly glanced around the room to find many were watching with confused expressions. The boy made his way up to the front of the room, moving cautiously through the crowd. Dumbledore had an annoyed twinkle in his eyes as the stubborn child refused to stand close to him. He once again gestured for the boy to come closer, to stand right beside him. He noticed Harry did so with great reluctance.
A few tense minutes went by before he could safely access the contents in the desk. He opened his eyes and reached his hand tentatively forwards to the bottom left drawer. With a shaky breath, his hand touched the smooth wooden handle. A second later, he slowly pulled open the drawer. Harry’s eyes laid upon an old, black diary on top of layers of unused parchment. Success. Harry reached in the drawer and stroked a finger down the smooth yet slightly rough cover.
“It is a gift card so you can buy new attire when you leave here,” Drew spoke up, smiling as a confused Harry looked at him. “Each and every one of us pitched in some money so you can buy whatever you desire. We thought it would be nice if you didn’t have to spend your money on that when you have so much else to purchase.”
Completing ignoring the man, Harry carefully opened the grey lid, his eyes laying upon dozens of polaroid pictures that made him sick to the bottom of his gut. He flicked his eyes over to Steven as the man groaned in embarrassment, gulping hard in an effort to fight back the fowl words wanting to spill out.
“How did he get up there?” an equally large kid asked next to Dudley, fear and awe evident in his voice.
“Oh my!” suddenly exclaimed Molly as she turned around to find Harry sitting at the table.
Grayson wasted no time, immediately rushing forwards and tightly wrapping his smaller arms around Harry’s back and stomach. His head resting on Harry’s steadily beating heart, find it comforting to listen to. Wrapping his own arms around the younger, Harry felt his heart break. He and Grayson had never been away from each other since Grayson had been taken in. Harry knowing what the younger had been through only made their bond stronger. He didn’t know how the other would cope without him here to turn to, to be there in the dark moments, to talk to late at night when everyone else was asleep.
“Perfect, it’s agreed upon that this Friday, we shall go to Diagon Alley to get Harry ready for the school year,” Dumbledore gave a fake smile to the members. “We will need to go to several stores, so the positioning of everyone shall be very important. Perhaps I will leave that task to you, Kingsley since I shall not be going. If I go, it will raise suspicion of walking the streets with a strange young man.”
“If you could start on the bacon, that’d be great,” she smiled as she continued cutting the fresh fruit.
A soft chuckle filled the air as Drew continued walking which made him smile even more. He heard the creak of a door being opened before it got closed a second later. It was so typical of Harry to be out of bed and wanting to sneak around when there was something going on. Drew thought back on all of the memories fondly, ever since he had first arrived here. The young inquisitive mind had always been curious about everything from the mundane household chores to high profile missions. Drew and his team found it hard to keep anything secret from Harry.
“A surprise I would have seen coming, young man,” the hat laughed inside his mind. “I would have offered the same house to you if you had attended in your first year. You always had these qualities instilled in you from a young age. No thanks to your upbringing.”
Harry nodded his head, worry slowly easing from him… Just not completely.
Although Dumbledore remembered something Kinglsey had said earlier in the conversation. Ronald had been talking too loudly about Harry to the girl. Maybe that meant that the two were both in Gryffindor and that’s how Ron knew her. It was the only feasible reasoning why the idiotic boy thought he could trust the girl enough to blow Harry’s identity in public. If it was true that she was indeed in Gryffindor, that could help his plans even more. Dumbledore would need to look into her student files more. But his mind was mostly made up for now.
“Split up and get him!” Dudley yelled suddenly and smiled with glee.
The group of five seemed to be in their own world and oblivious to the current intruder on their land. Satisfied the threat was nearly non-existent, Harry continued along the path once more at a rather restrained pace. He would rather take forever to get to Parker than rush in and be caught. Merlin would only know how a duel would go down in this household.
“What do you mean?” he asked in confusion.
“Hush and do your finally checks,” quietly laughed Drew in response.
Ducking, twisting, weaving and turning, all the while occasionally punching out at an invisible target. Harry imagined the sharp point of the knife entering different parts of the body, immobilising the imaginary attacker. The longer he continued practicing, the more sweat that begun to form around his body. He hadn’t been able to do anything like this in five days. His body craved it like a car needing oil. He could feel all of the day’s tension and frustrations fading with each imaginary blow.
“Does it matter anymore? It’s done. I can’t change the past,” he replied quietly, annoyed this was being brought up yet again.
"Don't bother giving me a report until you've had dinner," Drew said loudly, causing everyone in the room to chuckle.
"Get out of here before I change my mind you little mutt," laughed Drew as he picked his pen back up and got back to the paperwork in front of him.
“As you know, I sent Parker out on a mission to track down the diary a few days ago,” Drew begun slowly, pinching the bridge of his nose. “He has yet to return. I may need to send you out for a rescue.”
2am flashed in blue lights on Albus Dumbledore’s opened palm. He sighed tiredly as he closed his hand and softly lent back in his chair. Relaxing into the soft cushioning his trusty, old chair provided and looking around the dark, unlit room. He remembered all of the faces that were there not more than half an hour ago. All of his energy, both mentally and physically, were gone. Drained away by the unrelenting questions and ruthless stupidity the group held. It took five and a half hours for him to work through his plans and get it through their thick skulls. At least now he had a little more faith that this group were actually going to try and find Harry Potter.
“No worries at all. Have a good sleep Harry,” she smiled back and closed the door shut behind her.
Just as Drew took one more step closer, he saw Petunia’s eyes begin to slowly open. Not taking a chance since they only just arrived, he quickly shot a nonverbal
Moments of that fateful night flashed in front of his eyes. For a second he was transported back in time as the shouts of his father trying to fend off Voldemort for as long as possible. The hurried scrabbling of his mother as she prepared for the inevitable. Soft whispers of reassurance from his mother filled his ears. Telling him his is loved, to be strong, to be safe. The loud explosion rang piercingly throughout the room, protected from shrapnel by his mother’s body as the door was blasted to smithereens. Numb words fell upon his ears as he watched Voldemort face his mother. The scene slowed down in front of his eyes as the green curse flew towards his mother, her life instantly draining from her body.
“I am free on Mondays and Wednesdays,” Minerva said first after she contemplated her schedule before the school year was to begin.
“Oh, of course,” he said while awkwardly standing up. “I-I’ll leave you to it.”
"I would love to see what you've come up with one day soon," he said as he stood up.
The small group's attention was drawn to the front door as Molly, Bill, Kingsley and Alaster walked back inside. A gentle smile immediately graced Molly’s face as soon as her eyes landed on Hermione staring at Ron with a sparkle in her eyes. The four adults came over and looked upon the children that were eagerly waiting.
“Could be that house elf of yourself playing tricks,” a deep voice said, Harry didn’t know who it belonged to.
“You can’t seriously be expecting us to drop our spare time like that, now do you Albus?” Molly tutted at him in disapproval.
“Does it truly matter if you are an outcast?” he asked with a frown.
Harry turned his head as Drew descended the stairs, watching as the older looked him up and down in amusement. Drew came down to stand directly in front of the shorter, inspecting him for any signs of injury. Thus finding nothing and deducting it was all simply the target's blood.
A soft tapping noise brought Dumbledore out of his thoughts. Turning his eyes, he saw an owl flapping outside the window, patiently waiting to be let in. He flicked his wrist to open the window, intrigued by what the letter meant for him contained. The barn owl landed on the table and held its leg out. As soon as Dumbledore had untied the letter, the creature immediately took off without a blink, straight out the window it had been let in through. With curious eyes, he opened the letter hoping to find some good news after the visit he had had with Kingsley Shacklebolt and Alastor Moody an hour ago.
“You’re punctuality is getting later and later,” Charlie chuckled as he stood up and walked closer. “We don’t want you becoming too sloppy, now do we Drew?”
Harry turned on the taps so they could warm up; he placed all of his belongings on the bench and slowly removed the clothing he had on. The mirror caught his eye and regretfully, he looked upon his scarred and marked body. He had bruises and cuts on almost every area of skin and if it wasn’t fresh, it was old and faint.
Drew stood up and left the room without another word. After the door was softly closed, Harry immediately walked over to his wardrobe and started to get changed in to his training gear. Although his dark, warm clothes were very appealing in the cold weather, he knew that he needed to train in his usual fighting outfit. He needed to know all the physical limitations of his leather cloak, where every weapon was situated on his body without thinking, what movements make sounds that could give him away.
“I very much doubt that, Headmaster Dumbledore,” he smirked and lightly shook his head, shrugging off the hand. “If you did have my best interests in mind, you would firstly ensure I was comfortable during my transitional period. Secondly, you wouldn’t be forcing me into a situation that is unreasonable to any rational person. And thirdly, understand that I am a stranger to you and your Order members. Therefore, a mutual respect, trust and understanding needs to be built with each person. Am I understood Headmaster?”
With a defiant stare, Harry passively sat in his chair with his feet still up on the desk. He didn’t dare speak again. Instead letting the tense silence draw on until the stubborn Headmaster gave in. Hopefully the Headmaster would soon realise two things from this encounter; Harry was more stubborn than he was and that getting personal information about Harry would remain to be incredibly difficult. Oh how fun this was going to be for Harry.
“Boys, no more of this nonsense. Last warning,” said Molly as she pointed the spatula at them threateningly.
“Indeed,” he nodded his head. “A surprise in which many will not expect.”
Harry paused for a second as a wave of tiredness washed over him. He fought off the sleepiness as he started to equip the weapons to their rightful place. Before putting on his shiny and slightly heavy black boots, Harry begun to jump on the spot and shaking his arms to loosen them from the fatigue. The sounds of the equipment clanging and his socks softly pounding against the floor filled the silent room. He stretched his upper body by twisting it from left to right then backwards and fowards, waking up his muscles. After rolling his shoulders and letting out one last yawn, he grabbed his boots from the ground beside the wardrobe and hastily put them on, tying them up nice and tightly.
“Harry,” Parker breathed out, in pain. “As much as I appreciate being rescued, I don’t swing your way mate.”
“That will all be explained in due time,” Harry smirked, not backing down.
“It’s nothing to worry about, Mrs. Weasley,” he tried to reassure her as he stood rigidly next to one of the beds. “If they need to retrieve anything, just let them know they can knock and I’ll let them in.”
<3 UwU <3
“Yeah, I’ll probably just head home,” he nodded as he too stood up. “Well thank you for inviting me along.”
The room was silent, not a sound was made as the words sunk in. Shock coursed through each person, specifically the people who knew about the spy Harry was talking about. Subtle glances were shot towards Severus who’s body language had changed drastically. The Potions Master body had stiffened, he was sitting straight in his chair, not a muscle twitched. His eyes were darting frantically between the boy and the Headmaster, his mind obviously racing at the revelation of information.
“When you opened the door,” smiled Remus, “you didn’t use your wand.”
"And the way he keeps changing the subject to avoid answers," said Fred in an almost whisper. "It's frustrating but so impressive at the same time."
“That’s okay, Headmaster,” he said, shrugging the hand off his shoulder and taking a step to the side.
“Kingsley will push the agenda for you to help Harry, Hermione dear,” said Molly. “And if he can’t get the approval, I’ll go visit Headmaster Dumbledore myself.”
“Already done. I am not an idiot,” he growled out quietly, stepping towards the cell in which his co-worker and friend was being held in.
"There has been an increased activity of crime in both the muggle and wizarding world," the short and unshaven man said, stepping forward slightly. "I have been sighting a lot of murder cases where the cause of death is known, however the perpetrator is unknown. When Aurors have investigated, no magical trace can be found anywhere in the immediate area. That also includes some of the muggle cases they look into."
“Last night, after investigating yet another incident at the Dursley residents, we found Harry Potter,” he continued finally after allowing the shock to subside slightly.
“I’d rather that than think I’d done that to you,” Harry sighed and wiped the slight sweat away from his forehead.
“Voldemort,” he winced. “I overheard a conversation that he is back.”
A white light shot out of his wand and engulfed the hammer. Harry once again felt the item begin to slowly shift in his grasp, reverting back to the thinner handle of the Cinquedea. After a few short seconds, the light disappeared and he was once again holding the weapon in its full form. While he was rather grateful it had successfully transfigured twice, he had more pressing issues on his hands. Blindly stuffing the weapon into his mokeskin pouch, he raised his wand towards the broken window.
Deflecting the cutting charm and sending another
The twins were stunned for a few seconds before wordlessly retreating back to their seats, the exact same question on their minds; how did Harry know George’s name without being introduced? With a knowing look passed between them, the twins knew they would have to ask him while no one else was around.
“Yeah, Nymphadora and I will be staying for lunch,” a soft chuckle left him as he scratched the back of his neck.
And with a blink of his eyes he was no longer standing in the middle of the room, but outside the gates of Hogwarts. Harry placed the hood of his cloak up, hiding his face as he begun the long walk up to the Headmaster’s office. He spent the entire walk calming himself, trying to maintain control over his already volatile emotions. Easily manoeuvring within the castle, he arrived within no time, finding the gargoyle already stepped aside the closer he got. Stepping up the revolving stone staircase, Harry took one more deep, calming breath before he arrived inside the office.
A sombre silence fell upon the group of men. The sense of urgency long gone at no sign of the missing young man. Any hope that four of them had, washed away with each second. While Severus had remained the only one of them that never had hope of finding Harry Potter. He knew that the boy would have already been found by now if he was still in this country. But there was a small part of him, deep, deep down, that didn’t want to entirely give up the last living connection to Lily.
“Me? Leave you here?” he chuckled. “Very likely but today is your lucky day.”
“And?” Snape asked, wondering if he was going to elaborate on why he had just said that. “What about it?”
Harry nodded his head as he took a step back. He smiled at each and every person standing there before him. His heart full of love and contentment. Before he psyched himself out of leaving, he silently opened the door and exited the house. The group followed him out and watched as he took out the broom from its box. With his stomach in his throat, Harry swung his leg over the broom handle and took a deep breath. He longingly looked over his shoulders at his family and friends before kicking off the ground. He waved as he started rising up and soon enough, they were nothing but tiny little dots on the ground. Clearing his mind of all thoughts, he quickly checked over his attire and weaponry before placing a Disillusionment charm over himself. Harry flew over the quite towns and cities of England, knowing he was merely minutes away from his destination.
“Just put it all over there,” she nodded with her head, hands preoccupied. “Thank you both so much for getting my Ron and Ginny their supplies.”
“Because Sirius Black is in Azkaban,” nodded Harry, his tired body becoming alert with tension.
“We have a lot to discuss after last night,” Drew said after a few seconds of silence. “Let’s go to the training grounds. I’ll be waiting for you outside. Five minutes.”
“I don’t want to,” Harry pouted, feeling all of his energy leaving. “Please don’t make me.”
“If any of this is true, the Ministry Of Magic is potentially going to face legal repercussion over this,” said Kingsley, getting nods of agreement from the other two Auror’s beside him. “This could also affect you too, Albus, for knowing such information and not reporting an injustice.”
With mouth wide open in disbelief, Dumbledore stared at his least most trusted member of staff. The bustling room quickly diminished into a shocked silenced. With cheeks turning rosy red and the twinkle leaving icy blue eyes, the Headmaster stood up slowly from his chair. The room looked on in fear as the old man walked towards them, eyes locked on Severus Snape.
“Take care, Harry Potter. And try to not have too much fun,” the Sorting Hat’s voice slowly faded away as he picked up the hat and placed it back on the shelf.
Dumbledore held his breath as he opened the door and stepped inside the house. The first thing he noticed was how noisy it was upstairs. He could he a somewhat infuriating wailing sound as well as hurried footsteps. Looking over his shoulder, he found all four men had followed and were equally as intrigued to the sounds as he, himself, were.
Knocking quickly three times on the door, Harry waited for the grunt of acknowledgement before he entered Drew’s office. He opened the door to find a rare sight inside. Papers were scattered haphazardly on his desk as well as piling up on the two chairs meant for guests. Harry frowned as he saw Drew pacing back and forwards, hair messy, clothes untidy. The man looked like a mess.
Harry said all of that to Malfoy, not once moving his gaze away. Snape glanced back at Malfoy and saw tears start to form, knowing that this situation was just getting worse every second, Snape used his magic to close and lock Malfoy inside of his chamber while leaving him and Harry out to talk things through.
His thoughts were interrupted as he heard two sets of footsteps coming down the stairs. Harry turned to surprisingly find Ginny and Hermione walking down together. He would have thought the bushy haired girl would have left by now, wondering why she was still here. Perhaps she was offered a bed after the eventful day yesterday. He stared blankly at the two as they walked into the kitchen happily, sitting at the table full of food.
Harry turned around to face the two of them, raising an eyebrow in surprise. He honestly didn't think this was what they wanted to talk about. He could sense some hesitation hanging in the air. Looking between them, they seemed to be tense and not their usual relaxed self. While the question was genuine, he could just tell this wasn't the topic they wanted to start with. Perhaps they were gaging him in some way, testing out what he would and wouldn't discuss.
With the big piles of items now put away, there was only three things left to pack; the two way mirror, his candy and money pouch. It took him less than thirty seconds and then he was all done. He had officially finished packing up his life and was now ready to leave this life behind. The daunting meaning behind being finished weighed on him. To know soon he would have to go down stairs for the last time and face his chosen family, terrified him. Harry turned his head to look out the window, sighing as he saw the sun once again setting over the land he would miss. A sign time was ticking closer and closer, unrelenting and cruel.
“So you were abroad this whole time?” her mouth hung open in surprise.
Harry didn’t have the time to react as a red spell whizzed over his head. Running lower to the ground, he dived towards Parker, crashing in to him roughly. But before either hit the ground, Harry apparated the two of them out of there, not wanting to chance getting hit by anything else. Harry had apparated them to the outside boundary of the house, out of sight from the occupants of the house.
“From Parker no. But from you, I expected more,” he lightly tutted in feign disappointment.
“Parker, shut up,” he yelled and sent a wave of his raw magic down to the group.
“How did you know about the Order,“ Dumbledore was flabbergasted by the cocky young man.
Harry stayed silent as he too sat down. He continued to watch the beautiful night sky while he processed the information. Was he ready? Sure, he was more than capable to duel Voldemort and finish collecting all of the Horcruxes. The real question he had was if he was ready to go to Hogwarts. Was he ready? Not really. He didn’t know what to expect while attending the school. He wasn’t used to mainstream teaching or how school kids acted. He had never had friends before. Only family. The family he was brought in to by Drew that kept changing and evolving over the years.
“My magical caregiver was in fact you, Headmaster Dumbledore,” he ignored the comment once again with a vicious glare. “Was, is the key word. You are no longer my magical caregiver. And before you dropped me off at the Dursley’s all those years ago, you discovered I had a piece of Lord Voldemort’s soul within me.”
“So you are suggesting he is still alive to this day?” Minerva asked after a few seconds of silence.
“The honour is all mine, my dear boy,” tears welling up in her eyes once more as she took in the beautiful face before her.
“A soul fragment, Professor McGonagall,” Harry turned to look at her, speaking calmly compared to the way he had addressed the Headmaster moments ago. “For years before the attack, Voldemort had been creating Horcruxes. He would place them inside items so he could scatter them around the place to become immortal. That night he killed my parents, my mother unknowingly preformed a sacrificial protection on me, resulting in the killing curse rebounding back on to Voldemort when he tried to kill me. At the same time a piece of his soul had detached from him and attached itself to me. I lived with it in me for years.”
“Oh thank you,” he closed the book in his hands, smiling towards the other man. “You didn’t have to.”
The two stilled, not talking as the footsteps got quieter. Drew watched the marker travel up the hallway and back to the original spot it had been in beforehand. He waited another minute before he dared move once more. With the coast clear, he lit up the tip of his wand as he started to ascend the stairs one at a time. His body, his mind, his eyes, his senses, everything was on high alert after that close call. Pausing at any little sound, cautious beyond reason.
"Last night, when you first got here," said Fred as he shook away the shock from all the weapons.
“It was the twins, we are so sorry Harry dear,” Molly said in a rush, checking him over before quickly going downstairs now the crisis had been averted.
your boy. And obviously you have not been looking hard enough, Headmaster,” Harry smirked, absentmindedly spinning his knife on the tip of his finger.
After collapsing on his bed with a sigh, Harry allowed the sound of the rain to soothe his tense body. He hated being reminded of his birthday or his past. Before Drew had found him that faithful night almost eleven years ago, he had lived with a despicable family, the Dursley's. Just thinking about them made him tense back up and a snarl to rise from deep within him. Harry closed his eyes and listened to the rain again. He started to think back on the night he was found.
“You know how Harry is going through a tough time and I wouldn’t explain why?” Malfoy questioned, removing his hand and straightening his back up, Snape nodded and gestured again for him to go on. “Well, I’m afraid he won’t be alive for much longer if he doesn’t get the help he needs.
Harry turned his attention back to the silent Headmaster of Hogwarts, finding the old coot deep in thought. He waited patiently for the other to say something. But the seconds turned agonisingly into minutes, and still nothing was said. The prehistoric man processing all of the information that had been presented to him. Harry couldn’t help but smirk. this was the exact scenario he had hoped to cause when he had arrived. Maybe he should stir the pot even more, confuse the Headmaster even more with the knowledge he had all thanks to the detailed research he had done over the many, many years.
“Of course,” Remus nodded with a wide smile before looking at Harry. “Anything for James and Lily.”
"How about that 12 piece set of Black Kunai Throwing Knives you've had your eyes on?" mused Drew. "They are 6 inches long, comes with a two small and compact leg sheaths, and I'm sure if I mention my name then I can get a new bullseye target."
“Well I think it’s really sweet how much you care for Harry,” Nymphadora’s voice broke through his thoughts again, bringing him to the present. “The fact you are willing to spend the next month teaching him. And helping me shop for him. As well as grabbing some candy for him, it’s all very sweet Remus.”
“Of course, dear,” Molly turned her head, looking slightly concerned. “Everything okay?”
Everyone turned their eyes to find a sheepish Remus looking at the ground. The older members knew how much Harry meant to the man, being the last part he could hold onto of his childhood best friends except for memories. He was willing to do anything to help the boy. From teaching him, to buying the missing school supplies, to protecting him from any harm. Nymphadora smiled as she walked over to the front door, gesturing for the quiet man to follow her, endeared at the gesture.
Shock flew through Harry’s system as he processed the information. Concentrating on the task at hand by pushing that information to the back of his mind, he finally stood near the mark and looked around at all of the possible doors that could lead underground to the cellar. Deciding to not risk opening each of the five nearest doors, Harry pulled out his wand and the pocket knife again.
“So has Harry been here long?” Hermione asked, not able to stay quiet any longer.
Finally after an agonisingly long five minutes, the two stood in front of the closed door to the room where Mr. and Mrs. Dursley hopefully soundly slept. Drew looked over at Charlie before waving his wand over him. The other’s blue eyes turned to brown, his short, blonde hair turned to long, wavy brown hair, his facial structure turned slightly from sharp and angular to soft and round. Nodding, he watched as Charlie held his own wand up and waved it over him. He felt a warm flow of magic rush down his head that indicated the successful casting. Now with their glamours in place, Drew and Charlie entered the bedroom.
"Silence," Headmaster Dumbledore said quietly, no one hearing the word leave his mouth.
“Yes, he is back at the Burrow with all of the Weasleys,” nodded Kingsley, hesitant to continue.
while simultaneously pushing himself back, sliding back a little as his legs gave way from their current position to help his body be flat against the ground.
“Come in, Harry,” the thick, Scottish accent calmed Harry instantly. “Report?”
“No,” Harry said simply.
“Dad? Mum?” the sound of her son’s voice brought her back to the present moment.
Slowly, Harry pushed his presence into Severus Snape’s mind. He tried to break down the barriers within at a snail’s pace as to not alert the other. He found a little push here and there, but so far he had yet to be detected. Harry could contribute the slightly relaxed barriers due to the distractions of the ongoing events around the man. He was utterly impressed at the sheer amount of layers he had protecting his mind. It was unlike any he had seen before. The impressive barriers would have definitely come in handy when it came to being a double spy agent for both side, preventing either mad man from perusing his memories and thoughts without permission. There was no doubt the other had probably perfected the art of sharing specific memories while not letting his guard down at the same time.
“Do not call me your boy. I don’t know you. You don’t know me. Let’s keep this civil and formal. As for these circumstances you have been through, it does not give you the right to access my mind without consent. Am I not correct?” he spat out furiously, making the others in the room shiver under his enormous power and dark demeaner.
“If that is the case, I’m sure we’d be able to leave before anything was to happen,” a nervous smile passed upon her face.
“It was no problem, Mrs. Weasley,” Remus smiled as he placed all of the bags except one on the ground.
"Well this is unexpected. What can I do for you all?" Dumbledore tried to cover his true emotions by smiling and forcing a kind twinkle in his eyes.
“Mrs. Weasley, I am rather good at cooking. I learnt at a young age. You do so much, let me help take some pressure off you by helping out with just this one meal,” he said while making his way around the table and standing next to her with a kind smile.
The child with big, black bags under his eyes begun sombrely walking into the kitchen. He grabbed out a small stepping stool which he used to help his tiny frame reach for ingredients and utensils that were well and truly out of his reach. Dumbledore watched the woman sit back and relax at the table, happily interacting with her own child as her nephew slaved away in the kitchen. His face became white as if he had seen as ghost as he continued to watch the scene unfold. Beside him, Minerva couldn’t keep her jaw off the ground and Severus could only stare angrily at the nasty woman that had always tormented her own sister, and now nephew, out of jealousy.
“N-No,” he stuttered with wide eyes.
When she looked down at her arm, Petunia saw a rather large and deep cut which was actively bleeding. Panic filled her even more so when her eyes laid upon the blood ridden knife her husband, Vernon, was holding on to. She felt her breath disappear and tears pool as her body shut down from the shock. Petunia managed to turn her head slightly to be staring in to the malicious dark green eyes that had been changed, unbeknownst to her, from a dark brown colour.
“12 Grimmauld Place,” answered Harry, smirking when a few gasps rung out at the familiar address.
“This is a Mokeskin pouch. I got it for you to take to Hogwarts with you,” he said, holding it out for him to take.
“Why were you two trying to get into my room when it was already locked?” his unimpressed eyes turned towards the pair, satisfied when they both shivered under his gaze.
This was obviously Lucius Malfoy, no doubt in his mind. The older man had long silvery-blonde hair that reached passed his waist. He carried a cane with him, not that he needed the assistance, but rather needed to intimidate others. He dressed in a fancy silver and green robe that swished out behind him as he walked.
“I only know what has been made public information,” answered Harry, in a smooth lie. “But I don’t know much about them as people, no.”
Before Dumbledore could say anything else, all attention turned to the door being opened. Severus Snape froze for a millisecond at the sheer amount of people in the cramped room. With a disgusted look on his face, he closed the door and practically hugged the wall. If anyone got to close to him then he would give them his famous, deadly stare. Dumbledore’s magic unintentionally lashed out to the nearest people at the utter disrespect the late member showed.
Without saying a word, Dumbledore nodded his head and stood up dejectedly. He silently begun to lead the boy out of his office and towards the Entrance Gates, not being able to side along apparate anyone else from within the boundaries of Hogwarts. Even he, as Headmaster, had limits and safety protocols he needed to follow. The two made the awkward journey in utter silence. Not a word or sound was made. Dumbledore expected that he would have looked around in amazement, eyes lit with wonder at seeing the majestic castle for the first time. Instead, Harry walked a step behind him at all times, eyes straight ahead and face void of all emotions.
Harry stood up from where he sat on the ground. He gave both his knife and himself a quick cleanse from the small amount of the debris and blood. Drew started walking away from him without a word, heading up the untamed but walkable path that lead towards the back of the property. With quick strides, Harry quickly caught up with the other. The two walked alongside each other in a content silence for a while, just taking in the peaceful environment.
The two Auror’s looked at each other, daring the other to raise the topic. Alastor turned his head away in defiant silence. He had already brought up the issue of 12 Grimmauld Place, so he was going to let Kingsley handle this one. His magical eye twisted and turned in his head until he could see Kingsley out the side of his head, still staring expectantly at him. Alastor tried not to show any sign of his victory as the other sighed before looking at the Headmaster of Hogwarts.
“I may or may not have mentioned that Sirius Black was wrongfully convicted and he should be released,” Harry said sheepishly with a low voice as he turned his eyes away from the mirror.
"I wonder how he knows so much about us and the magical world. Where was he all this time?" George turned his head to look at his brother.
“As should we,” Arthur gestured to his two boys, waving a goodbye before walking out the room.
Everyone turned their heads to see Molly Weasley with tears in her eyes, clutching her husband’s arm. While no one ever voiced this opinion in front of the Headmaster, they were all thinking it every time their searches turned out fruitless.
Carefully and taking his time, Harry begun his decent. His eyes flickering everywhere to observe all of the surroundings. His ears on high alert, taking in all of the new sounds and processing them quickly. His body moving purposefully in a way that would ensure his presence would be kept a secret.
“So you are saying we got called here for nothing?” Nymphadora asked while crossing her arms over chest, her hair subconsciously turning a fiery red.
Wiping his mouth and using a non-verbal and wandless charm to wash the putrid taste out of his mouth, he leaned back against the wall and slid down it, careful not to sit in the puke on the floor. Snape banished said puke and crouched down in front of the young, shaking, tear-faced man.
“You must try and understand he has grown up in a household with six other siblings, so privacy and personal space isn’t a thing he is used to,” sympathetically smiled Remus as he walked towards the door. “I guess he might be excited about trying to be your friend. And that is all.”
Continuing to ignore the other in his room, he started cleaning up the items on the desk. Making sure the letter from Grayson was packed away safely, he sat down once more. Harry picked up the book from the desk and opened it up to the first page; he would read the hand written note later when he was alone. As he begun to read absentmindedly, he wondered how long until Ron would say something. From what little he had observed and already read on the boy, he was very full of himself. And it turned out he didn't have to wait long indeed.
“You’re welcome,” Drew chuckled, reaching forward and brining the younger into a firm hug. “You deserve it.”
Harry opened the letter up to find the familiar handwriting from Grayson. He chuckled at the timing of it all, with summoning a book signed by Grayson as well as receiving a letter from him. Sitting down, he begun to read through the letter, trying to hold back the tears the further he read.
It was in this moment that the Order got the clear confirmation they needed. Understanding the severity and seriousness, they reluctantly begun to leave. Some were glad to finally go home after the terrible event that had appeared before their eyes tonight. Dumbledore motioned for Severus to stay where he stood, he also knew there was also no point asking Minerva to leave as her body was in shock from the revelations. With less people in the room, Harry felt it safe enough to turn his body towards the Headmaster to give him his full attention.
“What are you doing here, Draco?” Salazar inquired sleepily, he had not seen students since the last day of the school year and he had enjoyed the quiet. “Also who is that with you?”
His hands ran over every inch of his body, the liquid being rubbed in to make sure he was completely rid of any dirty. Hands ran over smooth skin as strong muscles flexed and contracted under his touch. For a moment, Harry allowed himself to close his eyes and imagined it was someone else he was touching, yearning for someone to be there when he opened his eyes. Sighing to himself, he quickly finished lathering himself up before turning the water back on and ridding himself of that unfathomable desire. He knew full well that he would probably never find someone, someone to share his life with, share his aspirations with, share his worries with.
The man instantly froze, becoming unconscious in mid-step. His limp body falling forwards and tumbled down the remaining steps. Harry would have winced if he cared for the man when he heard a loud cracking sound as Steven's face went directly into one of the steps with full force. Steven came to land awkwardly with the half of his body folded over, legs spread out in mid-air, his own crotch smashed against his unconscious, bloodied face.
Very interesting insight. Not too much prejudice shining through his comments. He could hear a different tone when he spoke about Hermione though. Harry had to wonder what was happening between the two. Yes, he may have said she is the worst and pointing out her flaws, but he said it in an almost affectionate way. He talked about the other two girls differently than he did about her. He would file this information away for now and perhaps use it one day if the occasion arose.
“I thank you in advance for your time, Professor Snape,” Harry turned slightly in his seat to nod respectfully towards the standing man; no smile, no emotions on his face as he spoke.
“Really?” Harry’s eyes lit up in excitement. “When shall you be destroying it?”
Before he could place the weapons away, he needed to cover them so that when he summoned them back up, he wouldn’t get cut. He sorted through all of the sheaths and holsters that matched their rightful weapons, making quick work of covering the sharp objects. A heavy sigh left his pinkish lips as he started packing his collections of combat and fighting weapons. At least he could easily summon them tonight if he needed them, since he would be carrying the pouch with him. He moved on to packing his books, luckily there weren’t too many he was taking with him. Anyway, he knew he could always go to the library at Hogwarts if he needed to study up on anything.
Snapping out of the shocked daze he was in, Dumbledore entered the room fully followed by the red headed family. He walked up to the ghostly white woman pacing around the room and gently guided her to sit on the other side of the bed away from her husband. Nothing was adding up in his mind. The alarm should not have gone off if it had just been an altercation within themselves. Something seemed off and there was only one way to determine what caused the alarm to trigger.
Malfoy turned to look at Harry and rolled his eyes, explaining how fond of Salazar he was and that they had such a good relationship that they shared many inside jokes. But before Malfoy could explain much else, Salazar had returned and nodded just as his portrait popped open, granting them entrance into the private chambers.
“Go find Charlie and deliver this message for me please,” Drew’s thick Scottish accent filled the quiet room. “It’s time. Meet in the foyer when you get this.”
Unbelieving of what he had just heard, Harry pushed away from Malfoy and started throwing all of his stuff he had in his draws - which he had placed in there just before writing his latest journal entry - into his trunk.
"This old thing?" Harry darkly laughed as he gracefully squatted down next to the other's head. "Why I was told to come and get it."
The small child flinched away as much as he could from the hand that grasped his shirt. The three adults watched on, two in disgust and one void of all emotion. Petunia dragged Harry through the invisible people to come to a stop outside of the cupboard under the stairs, the three now knew this was the permanent room the young child stayed in. Ominously, the small door was open, the darkness seen within caused Minerva and Severus to feel claustrophobic from where they stood in the hallway.
Malfoy chuckled as he seemed to soak in the confused look on Harry’s face. Harry suddenly felt very self-conscious of the fact that he had no t-shirt on and scrambled to his trunk to throw on a tank top. Once his chest was covered and the towel was hung back around his neck, Harry crossed his arms tiredly and leaned against his bedpost.
Since the early hours of the morning, there had been nothing but noise all over the house. People walking around on the floors above him. People going up and down the stairs. Loud chatter, laughter, and banter floating up the stairs. Harry needed to collect his thoughts and himself from all of the disturbance. There was no way he would be able to live here for an entire month. This family would drive him insane in just a couple of days.
“While we were finishing up our shopping, we heard whispers that included Harry’s name,” sighed Remus. “As we were about to leave, there was a commotion down the street. Turns out the people that had been in the store at the same time as Harry were shouting about what they had seen.”
A loud bang rung throughout the streets outside. Harry looked towards the window, knowing his time was limited. He slid his wand down into his hand before casting a nonverbal ‘
“Try again,” Harry chuckled before nonverbally casted a nox charm with his finger.
“I am,” he chuckled. “Next time you should try going face first down that way your eyes are always on the target.”
“Good luck,” chuckled Bill as he sat down on a spare seat, shaking his head in sympathy.
“Drew, they’ve shifted,” Charlie suddenly said before a loud bang was heard.
Harry hummed in agreement as he too sat up, the whole mood from their current conversation turning serious. He needed to be paying full attention to everything being said. No distractions. Not even from the beautiful sky.
As Molly begun to climb the stairs, Bill and Charlie hastily made their way down passed her and into the kitchen. She shook her head as she momentarily paused, watching her two eldest dig into the food. Reaching the third level of the house where Harry was staying, she headed towards the closed door. Out of the corner of her eyes she saw the twins head down from the level above. Turning back, Molly leaned in to see if any noises were emitting from within, her hand hanging in the air next to the door. Nothing could be heard, so she assumed the young man was fast asleep.
I know y'all have been waiting for a new chapter. So I tried to do this as quickly as I could with everything going on. I love you all so much! Thank you for being so amazing and so supportive <3 Your comments make me want to cry each and every time. Enjoy <3
“Preposterous,” Severus dismissed immediately. “The alarm would never trigger if it was caused by themselves.”
When Drew opened the door, his eyes were drawn to the crackling fire in the living room. Rolling his eyes and closing the door softly behind him, he walked further in to find Harry laying on the couch closest to the fire, fast asleep. Taking off his coat and laying it on the younger, he shook his head before walking over to the opposite couch. He sat down just as Harry begun to stir from his sleep.
He lowered the knife and dug the cold metal in to her skin before quickly pulling it in a straight line. A red streak appeared in the tracks of the combat knife, and soon small dots of blood appeared along the line. Petunia flinched in her sleep, moving her face away from the knife subconsciously. The cheek soon had a small stream of blood running down it, threatening to spill on to the pillow below. Now was the moment of truth; would be unconscious and being attacked still trigger the alarms?
“I’ve got one more surprise for you,” Drew said, bringing Harry out of his thoughts.
“You are correct,” Dumbledore nodded his head in a show of submission, even though he strongly believed the boy was wrong. “How about you take a seat over here so we may sort this out, yes?”
“Practice,” he simply answered, smirk never wavering.
“What, w-who are you?” Petunia’s groggy voice filled the room as she turned her face to the right away from the intruder.
“I have my sources,” he looked blankly at Severus for a few seconds before turning his back on the man once more.
With a fond smile on his face, Harry placed the two-way mirror back inside the mokeskin pouch. He looked around tiredly for a spot to safely put it for the night. Deciding that it could stay beside his pillow, against the wall, he threw it over there. His eyes were growing tired the more he laid there, so he decided to get ready for bed. He removed the 12 set Black Kunai Throwing knives strapped around his ankles and his two small knives that were strapped on his biceps. Placing them neatly on the small bedside table next to the bed, he then turned the light off and got under the covers.
“What are you doing in here, freak?” Vernon spat angrily, voice raised in anger.
“Enjoy breakfast, you earned it after all of the help,” Molly smiled as she sent the spare apron back to its place and continued cooking.
“Have you heard much about your parents?” he asked, green eyes shining brightly.
He had been studying this man's routine for two weeks straight. He knew every move. Every detail about his life. This man's name was Kevin Owens, he was single, lived alone, worked from 9am to 6pm every day a part from Sundays, and every night he would have a cigarette before popping in a microwave meal.
Instead of responding, Harry merely stood up and allowed his wand to slip down into his hand once more. He pointed his wand down at Steven, watching the intense fear ignite in his eyes. Harry took a deep breath before moving his wand smoothly in the correct motion. He focused on casting the very difficult spell '
Everyone made their way inside the house to find Ginny and Ron still seated at the table. The pair were anxiously waiting for their return, having no idea if Harry would be found again. The pair got up as soon as the door opened and sighed in relief once Harry entered in last. Harry simply ignored the pair as he begun to climb up the stairs to head to his room. But he noticed he wasn't alone as he left the Weasley family to decompress from the eventful meeting. He was being followed upstairs by the twins.
Taking a silent, deep breath in, Harry tried to calm himself internally while figuring out a delicate way to say his next words. Obviously both Dumbledore and Molly would try to force him to room with one of the red headed kids. But he was not going to take no for an answer. He would not be sleeping in the same room as a complete stranger. Not only would he not have his privacy, but there was no way he could let his guard down enough to even sleep.
“How did the mission go?” he asked while flipping open the cover to reveal blank parchment.
“I knew about it,” he hummed with a small nod.
But the Harry Potter he was getting to know was distant, secretive and cold. Ron didn’t want to overwhelm him, but at the same time, this was the moment he had imagined for many years. And this wasn’t how he imagined it going. He was hoping to have a bit more enthusiasm from the other, especially considering he was graciously staying here in his home and practically demanded to stay in a room by himself. Thanks to him, he now had to share with his two oldest brothers, he would have much preferred to be roomed with Harry. Maybe that would have solved the coldness he was currently receiving.
Grabbing the towel from around his shoulders, he dried the last of the damp tips of his hair. Throwing the towel towards the bathroom without a glance, he closed the doors to his wardrobe and walked over to his bed. He knew he had delayed going down for as long as he could. If he took any longer, he might be rudely dragged downstairs by the ear like had happened in the past. Harry hastily got dressed into his clean clothes, the material sticking to his still slightly wet body. Reattaching the weapons to their rightful place, feeling better when he knew they were never leaving his side. He turned around and looked in the mirror, checking his appearance was suitable enough before he prepared to head down stairs. His messy, dark brown hair sat with slight curls on his head. The clothes he wore snugged his body in all of the right places.
The young man quickly placed his knife back into its sheath before slowly dropping Kevin, face first, to the ground. The young man sighed before stepping away from the corpse. Another night, another death, another job done. The young man apparated from the spot, to arrive on the top of the roof. Crouching down to be hidden from view, the young man held his hands up towards the yard and corpse below him. He concentrated on summoning his magic up. After a second of silence, the young man cleaned any of his DNA from Kevin, as well as the surrounding area, so there was to be no trace of him every being there. The young man removed all footprints of his from the grass so they could not track a shoes size and make. The young man finally removed his magical residual from the immediate area. He didn't want anything left behind that could possibly lead anyone to him, not even the best trackers or hunters would be able to find him.
Harry didn’t say anything, instead standing still waiting for her to step out of his personal space. Her show of affection and concern was odd for someone he had only met not even 24 hours ago. There seemed to be an attachment already there for the woman, perhaps all the time her family and herself had spent trying to find him. All the false promises Dumbledore had made throughout the years.
“Yes,” sighed Nymphadora. “So my main concern is if Ron or Hermione are seen in the photo, then they could be identified and that could give away Harry’s location perhaps.”
With that in mind, Harry moved towards the door, ready to execute his plan. He held his hand up and nonverbally unlocked the door. He pushed it open slowly, revealing the neatly kept entrance hall. He spotted the briefcase next to the hallstand while the coat hung on a rack not far away. Nudging the door closed with his foot, Harry intently stared upstairs where he could see a bedroom light on. He could hear Steven softly humming to himself as he changed out of his uniform. A dark smirk overcoming his facial features just anticipating the startled look he would have once noticing an intruder.
“I was here the whole time,” he said while tilting his head and frowning. “I was merely feeling claustrophobic so I opened up the window.”
"Have you guys got any new potions or items that you've worked on since you left Hogwarts?" Harry asked, changing the subject that would also create more questions than answers.
"I agree," George smiled as well as he thought of the intriguing young man.
The only two occupants in the Headmaster’s office at Hogwarts stood in a tense silence. Kingsley Shacklebolt would have flinched at the immense power emitting from the other if he was not already used to the common power show-offs at the Ministry of Magic. It was unfortunate that he could not just deliver the news and take his immediate leave. He knew that once Albus Dumbledore heard the rumours he came to deliver, than an order meeting would be called.
Snape lifted an eyebrow and gestured for one of them to explain what was going on. He noticed the hand placed on the Potters’ spawns leg and decided to save that for another time.
“Yeah,” he was slightly taken aback by the change in attitude. “My whole family, for generations, has been sorted into Gryffindor. In my opinion it’s the best house out of them all.”
“Well then why are you worried?” Drew asked with a frown, placing the book down and gesturing for Harry to sit.”
“Dear Merlin,” Arthur whispered from behind Dumbledore.
“I do, Molly,” Dumbledore sat up straighter in his chair, taking offence. “And I’ll tell you all why. This boy is the missing piece to our puzzle. He is the only chance we have at finally vanquishing the Dark Lord Voldemort for once and for all. Time is of the essence, Harry Potter must be found.”
"Your life," he whispered lowly before immediately pushing away from his victim.
“Yes, of course you can,” hesitantly said Dumbledore with a fake smile upon his face, hating when the Order members wanted to ask or question anything from him.
Scoffing and rolling his eyes, Harry watched as his uncle handed the keys to his cousin. After all this time, that kid was still being spoilt as if he was the prophet boy that was destined to save the entirety of the planet. Not only last week had the whale of a boy spat a tantrum in the middle of Privet Drive when his father had not allowed him to drive. Harry smirked as he thought back to a red faced Petunia Dursley rushing out to resolve the conflict.
“It’s no problem Harry. Anything for my big brother,” whispered Grayson shyly, but loud enough for everyone in attendance to hear.
Quietly thinking over the proposed plan, Dumbledore could see the benefits in it. However, what he needed time to think about was if the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. If he was to help Sirius Black be released from a wrongful conviction, it could do well for his plans to help control the brat that kept messing things up. Perhaps if he gave Harry a choice of where to live, it would maybe get the boy to relax into the environment more. Meaning he would be easier to control. Dumbledore looked between both Kingsley and Alastor, considering listening to their advice for once.
The two women didn’t need to be told twice as they disappeared out of the house within seconds. Severus and Dumbledore stayed in the kitchen in silence, both consumed by their own thoughts. The remained there like that until the three red heads walked in. Arthur came to stand next to Dumbledore, while the twins awkwardly stood near the door way.
he was found… Merlin help him not to kill the child out of rage.
Harry nodded his head. Drew and him had previously talked about what would need to happen if Voldemort came back. He dreaded the plan they were about to put in place. But he understood that he had an important role to play in this war.
“How?” choked out Harry through his sobs.
Harry managed to pry Grayson off of him just long enough for him to kneel down in front off him. The other immediately attaching himself to him again, arms wrapped around his neck and shoulders. Harry continued rubbing his back softly, noticing the calming effect it had on the younger. He looked over the group and saw the many tears welled up in the eyes of these adults. Their hearts breaking at the sight before them. His eyes catching Drew’s brown ones, an intense sadness deep within, the only sign of emotion on the man’s face currently. Harry couldn’t maintain eye contact with his mentor, or he too might start crying. Closing his eyes, he hugged Grayson tightly as he rested his chin on the other’s shoulder.
“How can we trust you are Harry Potter?” Dumbledore said to break up the rebellious silence.
“Excuse the mess,” breathlessly said Molly as she continued to place items in the suitcase that her sons may need for the night.
“I suggest you execute your plan to go to Hogwarts the night after your Birthday,” Drew sighed as he sat down on the ground with both of his legs crossed. “I know it is only less than a week to prepare, however, you are ready.”
Malfoy got up and stood at the door, knowing that Harry would follow him to a safe place. Harry shrunk his trunk and placed it in his pyjama pocket before reaching under his bed and grabbing his invisibility cloak, throwing it over his body, walk over to Malfoy and touch his shoulder to let him know that he was ready to go.
"Shacklebolt," he almost barked. "Any progress?"
“I’m going to take you to my Godfather’s room so we can decide what will happen. Be prepared to stay there tonight or for a few nights,” whispered Malfoy, taking the cloak off of Harry and passing it to him before he turned and, Harry’s hand still in his hold, started his way down the stairs again before reaching a corridor. He led Harry through the many corridors of the dungeon and made sure that the whole time Harry was okay and keeping up.
The room became quiet once more after the two had left, many stewing over the past and the future. Kingsley had made the right call by not allowing the twins or any of the other Weasley out of the house again. Word would get around quickly in the crowded street that the missing boy had been found alive and well. And word would get around that many people had witnessed the supposed Boy-Who-Lived with a particularly easily identifiable red-headed family. The next month now posed more troubles if it got out who Harry was staying with.
Dumbledore feigned a heavy sigh, forcing a sad twinkle in his eyes as he tried to hide his irritation as much as he could. This boy is already causing so much trouble, causing his loyal followers to question his leadership. He just hoped that no more questions would arise from the rest of the Order of the Phoenix. Not wanting to answer anything right now in fear of betraying his true motives, he decided to remain silence. Hoping the false facial and body expressions would be enough to throw both of his professors off the scent for now.
“Ah,” he said, knowing why he felt uneasy now. “Is the house warded against people with Animagus skills from entering without permission?”
“Look, Harry,” Snape started carefully. “I know this will probably help you. Draco, he does like you, he likes you the same way you like him. He knows what it’s like, what you went through at home. Hell, when that happened to him, I took him away and he never, ever went back to his parent’s. Give him a chance, embrace it because I don’t know if you can ever replace someone as caring as him.”
Once more, not a word was spoken. No protest was given even though there was much going on internally from the group.
Not only was the confused group of kids looking around for their target, but all three adults tried to figure out where the small child had disappeared to. No one present could explain how Harry could have escaped. With all those hands and bodies tackling the small framed child, there was no way he could have slipped passed. And Dumbledore, Minerva or Severus would have seen it having the height advantage. Gasps came from the group of children as the tall kid was pointing his lanky finger up towards the roof.
“Preposterous,” scoffed Dumbledore. “I took the extra measures to ensure he could not come back until Harry Potter was found.”
Harry smiled as he opened his eyes and looked around the room. Nothing much had changed except for a few new pieces of furniture and a personal item here and there. The bedroom was very much as dull as the day he first saw it, which Harry didn't mind as it was more than he ever owned at the Dursley's nearly for the first five years of his life. Harry settled in for the night, blissfully unaware of the panic happening miles away from him in the Headmasters office at Hogwarts.
The only sound he could hear in this present moment was the tearing of the skin, the gushing of the blood rushing from the cut, and the heavy, pained breathing from Petunia. She didn’t seem to be waking from the spell, nor consciously aware of the danger and harm that was being subject to her. He looked back over his shoulder to Charlie to see him staring blankly at the wound. After whistling at him, Charlie’s brown eyes focused on Drew’s face. He waited patiently with an expecting look, as the other closed his eyes and analysed the wards.
After Molly had left with Ginny following closely behind her, Harry looked upon the remaining five with intense eyes. Fred, George, Ron, Hermione and Bill all stood before him in an awkwardly tense silence. As the seconds passed, he had to subtly remind himself to breathe calmly as he felt the rage build.
The gates started to close the further the group walked. Harry only just squeezing in passed them as they fully closed, ensuring no one else could enter for the night. With each carefully step, he followed the Order at a safe distance, stalking them until the perfect moment to break away. There were moments that had Harry pausing periodically due to the double agent turning around and looking around with wary eyes. Credit must be given where it is due, and he must admit he was exceedingly impressed with how in tune the professor was with his senses. He also could not help but think how great of an assassin the dark auraed man would make, sadden great talent was lost to a game of power between two madmen.
Dudley stood up from the couch and walked directly to his father and cousin, ready to save him from the torture. Yet he didn’t get very far as a white light hurdled towards him and hit him square in the chest. His body seized up, everything becoming stiff. Then the next thing Dudley knew, he was on the floor, frozen in position. All he was able to do was stare helplessly at his father as Harry continued with the onslaught of torture. All he was able to do was let a few small tears fall from his eyes. That was all he could do in this very moment.
Taken aback, Harry looked the man up and down slowly. He had not been expecting that motive behind being asked that question. Part of him was curious why the other seemed to be so invested in him. Was this the work of the manipulative Headmaster of Hogwarts? Or was this the genuine, caring nature of the other? Harry guessed he would come to find out over the course of the next month considering how much time they would be spending with one another.
“Good night Harry,” Drew said with affection, a kind smile that reached his eyes appearing upon his face. “Miss you, brat.”
“Well thank you,” she smiled as she too started filling her plate. “And thank you too, Mrs. Weasley for breakfast. As well as for letting me stay.”
“Of course, thank you for your help,” he smiled as he reached out to shake hands. “I’ll be in touch soon for your next mission.”
Dumbledore was left on his own in the tiny muggle kitchen. He listened to the soft talking from the family that had caused him so much distress and anger over the years. Here he was helping them when they had failed in the one task he asked them to do; ensure the boy lived until he could go to Hogwarts. It was not a hard task. It was not an inconvenience. It was not a burden on them. It was why he offered to compensate them generously with the boy’s money. He despised being in this house or anywhere near them.
“Thank you Molly, but I’ll have to decline. We must get going and tackle this headache with Dumbledore,” said Kingsley with a strained smile.
Looking beside the now quiet, bushy-haired girl, Harry saw Ginny turn her staring eyes away as a mad, bright blush took over her whole face. He tried to control his eyes as they begged to roll at the obsessed teenage girl. It felt weird to him the way she would hang on to every word he said, as well as the way the younger female would look at him and turn in to a blushing mess anytime he gave her any sort of attention.
Loud cheers deafened him as the song came to an end. Shaking his head, he pushed aside the intruding emotions and focused on the present. He walked forward into the crowd of people, handing out hugs, handshakes, and high fives with his friends and family as he made his way towards the kitchen. His eyes bugged out of his head as he saw the small pile of presents laying at the head of the table, next to plates upon plates of delicious, mouth-watering food. The group had made his favourite chocolate chip pancakes, an occurrence that didn’t happen often. There was also a selection of other breakfast foods such as bacon, eggs, sausages, fresh fruit, and pastries. Harry looked around with a shimmer in his eyes, glad to have them all in his life.
“May I help you?” he asked in a cold tone, surprising the five still standing there.
"W-Well, yes you're right," stuttered Fred.
Dumbledore, Minerva and Severus all flinched as the onslaught of book meeting flesh begun. They watched as the young child fell to the ground and withered in pain from the assault. Harry turned away from his uncle to hide his emotions, staring at the corner where three invisible adults stood. Tears streamed in rivers down his face, his green eyes expressing all the torment he had suffered while in this very household. Thankfully all three begun to rise out of the pensive, finding themselves back in the room they had left from.
“So far, so good,” he answered with a pensive look. “I think slowly introducing him to mission’s will be the best route considering he has never done one before him. All his training the last few years has led him to this point.”
“So is he back?” a voice asked.
“You sure you don’t want to go through your window?” Drew asked with concern.
“I have to,” his voice broke as he tried to speak. “I have to be there and I have to care. Who else is there to do that? I am the closest thing to family he has right now. His parents are gone. His Godfather is supposedly rotting in Azkaban for a crime he didn’t do. I am the last thing he has to a connection with his parents. I’m doing this as much for James and Lily as I am for Sirius and also myself.”
“We will have to wait and see now,” sighed Dumbledore tiredly.
“So on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, you can help Harry after his lessons with Severus and Minerva. On Tuesdays you can have the full day with him. I feel like that should be efficient to reach our end goal,” Dumbledore said as he jotted everything down upon the parchment. “From Saturday morning to late afternoon, Harry will train with Kingsley, Moody, and Nymphadora depending on who is available. That way there he can have a break before his lessons with Severus and have all of Sunday off. Is this understood and agreed upon?”
The moment the door was closed and the tall, lanky redhead had left, Remus looked upon Harry with amusement written all over his face. The interaction between the two teens had been interesting, however short it was. Harry’s entire attitude shifted the moment Ron had entered. He was closed off while he had been talking to Remus, but he had a more light-hearted attitude. Towards Ron his attitude seemed to show he was irritated and annoyed by the other. Although Remus didn’t know if he acted that way due to this morning's events or if he had just a general dislike for the other.
“But that would be a suicide mission,” he stopped walking, looking at Harry as if he had lost his mind. “Look where it got me.”
Harry’s eyes widened dramatically as Malfoy raised his wand and swished it in a small circle. Flinching and closing his eyes, Harry felt the tingles wash over his skin and he knew, from doing it to himself so many times, that Malfoy had just taken away his glamour. That meant that he was now standing in front of his mortal enemy, exposing all of his scars, bruises and cuts.
“Thought I felt something,” Draco shrugged as he turned his head away from the hallway. “I’m sure it was nothing.”
“Nice to meet you Fred and George,” Harry extended his hand to the eldest twin first, staring them both in the eyes as he firmly shook their hands.
Satisfied that his favourite knife had been thoroughly cleaned, Harry placed it back in its rightful place in his calf holster. He had also been taught to always have a weapon other than his wand on his body. Harry walked out of his bathroom and sat on his small bed. He took a few seconds to decompress from the mission before he needed to report. He stared in to the free-standing, full length mirror. He noticed there was a splash of crimson blood droplets on his cheek. He wiped it away with a smile before standing. He stared in to his dark green jaded eyes before walking out.
The room erupted in to shocked chaos. Dumbledore watched their reactions intently, taking note of each person. He noticed majority of the members that worked within the Ministry of Magic were not shocked. Obviously Shacklebolt had not been lying when he said the talk was not being hidden. The rest of the group shook in their shoes, fear and hysteria rapidly setting in. This was the news they had all feared; that one day Voldemort would return. The family of red heads huddled together, Molly squeezing all of her children that were present.
"You wanted to talk to me in private," Harry interrupted as he put his right foot up on the bed, leaning forwards and pulling up his pants to reveal more weapons. "And I don't think that is what you really wanted to talk about."
“He’s a freak,” Dudley stammered out in shock. “Freaks do freakish things.”
“And?” Dumbledore probed, not understanding the reason for this conversation.
Smiling, Harry shook his head at how easily distracted he had just became over a silly old scar. He held out his hand and a second later a pair of clean jocks flew into the bathroom. After he put them on, he grabbed his wand and knife plus their holsters before he walked out into his bedroom and discarded the items on his bed. He turned around with a heavy sigh and headed to his wardrobe. Shuffling through the many dark coloured tops hanging next to his leather coats, he selected a long sleeved, black shirt. Sending it floating over to his bed with a mere wave of his hand, he turned his attention to the bottom drawer in his wardrobe. He opened the drawer to reveal an array of neatly folded pants, shorts, socks and underwear. Wasting no time, he grabbed out his most comfortable tracksuit pants he had and sent them over to his bed.
birthday, a day he never really enjoyed much thanks to his childhood. He knew that downstairs were a small pile of presents from the people that dared give him a gift as well as a pre-made birthday breakfast fir the household. In all honesty, Harry wanted to delay going down there for as long as possible. The attention he received always felt weird despite the many years he had been through it.
"Last night," she said after a few seconds, "an alarm went off indicating we needed to be called to the Dursley's residence under the impression they were in harm's way by intruders. But after arriving, we found they were not."
“You can just head straight home instead of back to base if you would prefer,” said Drew, standing up and stretching.
“Mmm,” disapprovingly shaking his head, Drew started walking inside. “Go to your room and start getting ready, little brat.”
The room was silent. Although the same could not be said for the rest of the house. The other occupants carelessly stomping around and shouting at one another. Harry tried his best not to allow the Weasley family to disturb his peaceful meditation session. He had a very busy day ahead and he would need a clear mind to keep his emotions in check; especially when dealing with Dumbledore. Sitting crossed legged on his bed, Harry allowed the warm rays of sunlight to stream on his closed eyes, breathing in and out slowly.
Entering their own room, Fred and George separated to sit on their own beds. They both felt drained after not only that strange interaction with Harry, but the Order meeting that morning. It had already been such a huge morning for the pair. Their minds struggled to process all of the information they had learnt. The silence continued as they dwelled on the events over the past day, trying to find the words for it all.
“Yes,” Pansy and Draco said at the same time.
Minerva and Severus watched on with disgust as the young child turned around and started furiously hitting the small framed Harry over and over again. Harry whimpered as he fell to the floor, holding his hands to his face to try and protect it as much as he could. It was painstakingly clear to everyone present in this moment that this wasn’t the first time the young child had to protect himself from an onslaught of physical abuse. The way he almost relaxed his body to go with the hits to lessen the pain, the way he refused to yell or beg to let it be over quicker, the way he knew the most vital areas to protect from the blows.
If he was being honest with himself, Harry had an inkling that after Hermione had been brought back to the Burrow that she would try to weasel her way into helping out. Either that or someone else had the bright idea of suggesting it. At the end of the day, it didn’t matter to him because he didn’t need nor want the extra help. He was sure the people tutoring him would realise this rather quickly.
Rolling his eyes, Harry flicked the newspaper back in half. Walking over to Molly, he handed her the newspaper before turning his attention back to the half poured juice. He heard her verbal reaction, gasping, tsking, sighing. It was rather amusing, but part of him knew this was not good for everyone involved. His mind wandered as he placed the two pitches on the table. Something was just not sitting right with him.
“Is that envelope for me?” Drew asked after spotting an unopened, yellow envelope on the coffee table.
“Have you been in the magical world?” Dumbledore’s red face giving away how much Harry was getting on his nerves.
“I am my own individual,” he replied while shrugging his shoulders. “Whatever house I get sorted into will be no issue for me. I don’t care for Hogwarts Houses. It means nothing to me. But would it be an issue for you if I don’t get sorted into Gryffindor?”
A set of headlights from an annoyingly loud car turned in to the top of the street, illuminating the dark shadows as it rumbled along slowly. Harry instantly knew it without looking that was the sports car Vernon owned that was slowly approaching, extremely familiar with the sound of the irritating vehicle. However, he was not the only one familiar with the low rumbling. Petunia shot up from where she was laying comfortable, scrambling to turn the television off and hastily make her way into the kitchen. Harry knew that she feared being on the end of either of Vernon’s or Dudley’s wrath, he knew what it was like first hand.
“Remus, Peter’s Animagus form was a rat, was it not?” he asked with a slight smirk.
“Harry, I’d like you to meet my family,” she nervously said, wringing her hands together. “If you need anything, anything at all, they will help you while you are staying here. You are part of the family while you’re here.”
Not wanting to touch the horrendous piece of flesh more than he had to, he lifted up the limp penis with the blade of his knife. He tucked the grey sweatpants underneath the penis to keep them out of the way, giving him full access to the member without disruption. Staring at it for one more moment, Harry chuckled out loud as he thought of how this was the ugliest penis he had ever seen in his life. He studied it, tilting his head, deciding which direction he would start cutting from. He needed to ensure that Steven had an amazing view of the show. Mind made up, Harry harshly gripped on to the penis, tugging it upwards. Harry made sure his victim was looking before he started.
Confusion and anxiousness flooded through the room. Never before had their leader demanded they start an emergency meeting without all current members being in attendance. They looked around the room at each other, the tense silence filling with talk as they tried to sus out the situation. Dumbledore however, ignored everything around him as his mind once again became consumed with plans.
“Okay daddy!” Dudley smiled with glee.
Harry couldn't help the genuine laugh that bubbled up. He shook his head in disbelief. This man always knew what he wanted without him even needing to say a word. Harry didn't know how he did it.
Harry stood up from where he knelt, slightly stretching his aching muscles. He looked down from where he stood and admired the work he had done thus far. There was not much more work he needed to do before he could clean up and leave. Majority of his plan had gone accordingly, very satisfied with the results, but he was still looking forward to the next part the most. What's one thing a male predator wants/needs to abuse others? A full functioning penis. Frankly Harry thought this man didn't deserve to have one. He was going to correct that, and painfully so, unfortunately for Steven and fortunately for the rest of mankind.
The food arrived and Malfoy dug in while Harry hesitated to put food on his plate. But knowing that Malfoy and Snape would snap at him to eat more, Harry piled on as much as he thought he could handle right then and there.
“Hello Auntie,” Harry drawled out with a deep voice, only smirking even more viciously when recognition dawned in her eyes. “Have you missed me?”
The rest of the scene sped by as Dumbledore watched how the three family members spent the next few minutes. Nothing was out of the ordinary a part from the fact this incident seemed to be self-inflicted. No sign of magic. No sign of foul play. No sign of anything. Dumbledore watched the son break down in tears and the husband walk around the room in a daze. He watched as Petunia was the only one to start cleaning up the mess Vernon had made, looking after the cut as much as she could.
The bright moonlight that streamed through the window bounced off the knife to create a silver glow along the wall. Drew watched it in fascination as he brought it closer down to the still body beneath him. The reflection moved down with it, slowly coming to shine brightly on the closed eyes. He watched as Petunia frowned subconsciously in her sleep and twitched, almost as if she knew what was coming next. Before creating any new lacerations, he decided to toy with her and see if it provoked any reaction to the wards. Dragging the knife along her delicate skin, digging in to sensitive spots, leaving red marks from the sharp edge, smearing the already drawn blood around on her cheek.
Just as Harry had reached the last step on the staircase, he detected small movement out of his peripheral vision as well as hearing approaching footsteps. Stilling in place, not even moving his head, he watched as a tall, lanky man walked briskly out of the hallway beside the staircase.
"Yes. I've got a lot of prep for the next day with you know, getting revenge on the Dursley's and getting ready to leave for Hogwarts and all that," he mused with a dark, playful smile on his face.
“We will come down shortly once we finish up,” he nodded simply, face expressionless except for a slight clench of his jaw.
"Oh," he said, taken aback by the reply. "Um, so what are you reading?" asked Ron, the silence getting under his skin.
“I have photographic evidence!” a witch yelled that stood behind the two main men. “Make sure to read the Daily Prophet tomorrow to see it!”
Dumbledore had been so zoned out that he did not notice the arrival of majority of the Order members. He looked up and scanned the room with his icy blue eyes. He mentally checked off his members, noticing only two people were yet to arrive; Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall. One was down in his dungeon, the other away in Scotland. Mentally shaking his head in disapproval, he stood up and walked towards the window, his back facing the members.
The pocket knife bounced off of the door, creating a small bang. Harry winced as he snatched it out of the air, cancelling the spell silently, wrapping it up again and pocketing it. He quickly turned his back against the wall and looked down the hallway just in time to see Draco and one of the others poke their head out of the room. Staying one hundred percent still, Harry’s eyes watched the two look around.
“Of course,” said Nymphadora before leading the quiet man through the now packed out street.
“I did,” he nodded in return, picking up some bacon and eggs and adding it to his plate, completely ignoring the splattering sounds coming from the young female Weasley.
The room was in completely and utter shock. While they were all acutely aware of Severus's past and how he has tried everything to right his wrongs, they didn't once imagine the Headmaster would try and turn that against the man. Severus averted his eyes to look out the window. Shame was looming over him like a heavy cloud. If he didn't have such complete control over his emotions, he would have stormed off angrily. Instead he was going to passively stay for the rest of the meeting, not contributing anything more, but not let the old coot win.
“I’m sorry Drew,” Harry looked at the man with genuine sorrow. “It’s just that it’s been hard hearing Dumbledore take control as if he is some type of God to be worshipped. And I just wanted to cause a little bump in his road, hopefully derailing him in the process.”
“As good as one can in a house full of complete strangers,” he answered after contemplating his answer.
The kitchen window blew open slightly from an invisible force, catching Molly’s attention. In came a silvery Phoenix in all of its glory. She temporarily placed the cooking eggs under a charm to keep them from overcooking or burning. Placing her spatula down, she turned towards the silvery-white bird knowing what it was there for. The other occupants of the room turned their attention to the corporeal patronus, tension filled the room as they waited for the inevitable message that was to come.
“What can Dobby do for little master Draco Malfoy?” the elf squeaked out, not chancing to lift up out of the bow or to look at his master.
“Oh, no thank you, Mrs. Weasley. I would much prefer to stay in a room by myself,” Harry gave her a small smile. “No offense, however I do not know you or your family. So I would rather not sleep in a room with a stranger.”
Harry adjusted his long, leather cloak before swiftly walking to the left side of the path. He crouched down behind the very first bush, peaking around it to look for any signs of movement. This mission was going to take time and patience, one wrong move and the game is up. Perhaps that was why Drew choose him. A bubble of proudness engulfed him for a mere second before he squashed it down. He couldn’t let emotions interfere with the task at hand, it was too dangerous.
“Enough soppy emotions, let’s eat!” Parker exclaimed only to be hit on the back of his head by Charlie who was standing next to him. “What? I’m hungry.”
“How are things going, Harry?” Drew asked straight away, wanting to get to the bottom of things.
Everyone in the room turned to him, all eyes trained on him and his reactions. Soon enough, the group broke out in to the birthday song. Some singing dramatically, while others sung normally. He couldn’t help the smile that managed to surface, a slight blush on his face at all of the attention. This was by far the biggest turnout he had ever had in all the years he lived here. A feeling of sadness overcame him, seeing the faces of many he came to enjoy the company of. He knew deep down that he wouldn’t be seeing many of them for a while, it could even be a year depending on how his mission went.
Harry abruptly came to a stop as his eyes comically widen with fear. The three adults turned their heads to find yet another three children running directly towards the terrified child. They turned their attention back to Harry just in time to see the young boy turn on his heel and run into the open backyard of a house. His fat cousin leading the other two he was with to meet up in the middle with the first two boys. The group of five slowly catching their breath as wolfish grins and lit up eyes stared towards the backyard.
“Good,” smirked Harry before turning around and walking towards the kitchen.
Time seemed to slow down for the two of them as they waited in anticipation for the other Order members to arrive. The first few people landed within five minutes, looking around at each other and towards the leader of the group for some indication as to why they had been called so suddenly. They remained silent out of respect and a bit of fear of Dumbledore, waiting for him to engage first so they would not face his wrath. The room was practically sizzling with his anger, magic lashing out without the man’s knowledge. This rarely happened and they all knew that when it did, it was bad news.
“I’m afraid of my feelings towards Malfoy. He obviously seems to care for me and I’ve noticed the way he looks at me. Now I’m not sure if that’s because he knows about all of the abuse and what I do to myself or if it’s because he actually has the same type of feelings for me,” Harry sobbed into his hands.
Finally the chance for him to enter the house arose as Vernon barked an order at his obedient wife. She rushed out of the room and seemed to disappear into the back towards the kitchen. No doubt to whip up some dessert for the hungry obese men. Closing his eyes, he checked the status of all of the wards and protective charms over the house. Only to find nothing had changed since he was there last night. Harry smirked as he placed his knife away and stood up to stretch his limbs quickly. He made his way carefully, yet swiftly, over to the edge of the roof. Grabbing on to the thick branch of the tree that overshot the roof, he made quick work of descending safely down to the ground.
An update on my back: I have my 6 month review appointment end of this month so I'll see how the surgy went. I am still in pain and sitting to write is so hard >_<
“Where have you been, my dear boy?” asked Dumbledore after a tense silence. “We have been looking everywhere for you.”
“He talks about you a lot,” Drew said with a quiet, solemn voice.
Wiping a lone tear from the inner corner of his eye, Harry took a second to collect his thoughts. His heart broke at the words he saw on the paper. This special letter from Grayson just reminded him of the importance of doing everything the right way, but as quickly as he could. He couldn't allow the younger to grow up in a world, magical or not, that was tormented by evil men like Voldemort or Dumbledore. He just needed to end this war, fulfil his destiny, and get back home to his family.
Once more, the scene changed before their eyes. How desperately Minerva and Severus wished this torture would end. Neither could imagine spending a full four and a bit years like this. They shudder in unison as their brains were thinking the same thing; what if he had never gone missing and stayed there until his first year? Would there even be a chance the kid would have survived that long? Their thoughts going down a scary path, making them sick to their stomachs.
Merry Christmas! I hope you enjoy this surprise! Please give me some comments and love. Have a happy holiday or break and I'll probably see you all in the new year! Much love to you all, stay safe!
“Obliviate,” Drew whispered, erasing this encounter for safety. Not like he needed to since he and Charlie did have glamours on. But it was better to be safer than sorry.
***IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT:***
After a quick 15 minute journey, the young man landed on the ground. He looked up at the only house in sight, a massive old barn styled house with fields of green grass surrounding it. A track had been engraved into the grass from the many cars that had driven towards the house. The track lead off into the distance of the tree line. The house was in the middle of a very large clearing, secluded from any human life. The young man placed the Nimbus back into his box as he walked up to the house. Opening the door quietly, the young man quickly observed the amount of people within the living room and walked in. The door automatically closing as soon as his hand left the door handle.
“Yes Ron?” eventually asked Harry with a heavy sigh of irritation.
A slight frown appeared on both Severus and Dumbledore’s faces at the comment. Neither of them had expected that kind of reaction from the boy. Dumbledore immediately thought of ways he could get the boy to lose all respect for the Potions Master. Perhaps another time he should share some details from the man’s past that was linked back to his father and mother. Surely the boy would become angry at the treatment of his deceased parents. While it was strange how much the boy already seemed to know, certainly he could not know about his past or family history.
Anyway, I love each and every one of you. Your comments make my day and I always re-read them when I am feeling down. So thank you for that. Love you all! ENJOY!
“One day I might be able to tell you. But today, or anytime in the near future, will not be that day,” softly smiled Harry. “I won’t tell anyone, so you don’t need to worry.”
“You’re so sweet. But there should be nothing to worry about,” she smiled, taking a bowl of freshly cut fruit to the table before turning around and starting on the eggs. “Bill, Kingsley and Mad Eye Moody strengthened the wards around the house yesterday.”
“Really, Harry,” she smiled sadly. “It’s okay.”
“Sorry, but I’d rather not see you caught up in whatever jinx or ward he has in place,” he sighed, shuffling around in the dark.
“I am sorry, my boy. I’m sure you can understand the circumstances I’ve been throu-“ he said before being cut off, his red cheeks only reddening from the embarrassment of being called out in front of many Order members.
“Charlie?” he asked in to the quietness. “Any change?”
“Remus,” he turned his head, ignoring the Headmaster. “You knew Sirius Black the most here out of any of us, did you not?”
Harry's deep laughed reverberated around the rather empty entrance hallway. He shook his head in amusement as his ears were filled with the sweet sounds of continuous begs of salvation. Wanting to toy with the man some more, he grabbed his Blackhawk Tatang knife out of its sheath, resting the tip of the knife on his pointer finger and swirling it around. Steven groaned once more, wiggling desperately around to attempt to free himself from the ropes.
“That could be arranged, but we would need someone to take you to and from each location to ensure your safety,” Dumbledore said after thinking for a few seconds.
“Silence!” he yelled, holding up a hand. “I did not bring you here to waste my time. We must make a solid plan and act on it now!”
The room expected the young man to react to those names, but Harry didn’t even bat an eye as he continued to stare impassively at Remus as he spoke. Perhaps the young man didn’t know of his past, or his heritage. Some tried to reason that the reason there was no reaction was because Harry didn’t know much about the wizarding world and its history. Remus felt a wave of sympathy pass through him at seeing no reaction. He could not wait to help Harry learn about his parents.
“Hopefully nothing spectacular so we, or more so you, are able to focus on the main mission,” he sighed. “Expect to be pampered and swooned over. They’ll smoother you with kindness, friendship, and caring gestures to persuade you over to their side.”
The Headmaster of Hogwarts was too stunned for words, his mind racing at the words that had come out of Harry’s mouth. Of course he could sense something was going to come out that he needed to do damage control for. But he did not think, not in a million years, the boy would have known about his spy. How did he even get a hold of this information in the first place? As far as he could tell, no one expect for select Order members even knew that he had a spy. But he didn’t think that any of the people that knew would have told the boy in such short time.
Unlike coming in, Harry wanted to stay on the grass side of the bushes as it will give more cover from the windows. As they walked to the first one, he kept looking over his shoulder and scanning the windows for any movement. He crouched down, forcing Parker to do the same, just after they got to the first hedge.
Looking down at the hand, Remus’s face grew hot at the touch. Electric coursed from where the soft fingertips met his skin and all through his arm. He looked up slowly into her eyes that were currently a bright green colour, much like his own. Forcing an awkward smile on his face, Remus turned away and continued looking through the array of candy. His thoughts were quickly consumed by Harry once more.
Harry stood up and slowly looked around his room. He studied each piece of furniture, each sentimental present he had received, each fond memory that was etched in to his mind. A soft smile couldn’t help but grace his lips. As much as he was dreading leaving, he couldn’t help but be so grateful for being able to grow up here. He was so grateful to be loved, to be cared for, to be wanted. A shiver travelling down his spine as he imagined what his life would have been like growing up with the Dursley’s. No doubt it would have been a terrible, painful childhood. Considering what he went through in that short time as a young boy with them.
“You don’t like him?” Remus asked with an amused smile.
"That's what I thought," Dumbledore said quietly with a smirk, before looking around at the others. "Now, is there any other issues so I may get back to work. There are many Hogwarts letters still to be sent."
“I’ll have to interject there, Headmaster Dumbledore,” Harry spoke for the first time, not letting the anger slip into his voice. “You did not find me, you did not rescue me. I simply made my presence known.”
"Can I come in?" asked a red cheeked Ron, awkwardly standing near the door.
The two chuckled at the joke before settling in to silence once again. Harry closed his eyes and tipped his head back slightly. He took a deep breath in, held it for a second, and then exhaled deeply. The soft early morning breeze doubled up with his cooling sweat sent small chills down his body, raising goosebumps on his arms. He opened his eyes to stare at the sky once more. There was something so calming about a clear night sky when all of the stars were out in full force. He couldn’t explain it, but it was one of few things to help him find peace in stressful times.
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” scoffed Harry with a smirk.
Snape nodded and agreed to what he was being asked to do. He would let the boy stay here for now and in the morning would take this issue up with Headmaster Dumbledore, even though he was still weak from almost dying before the war ended. It’s a long story and would have to be explained another time, just like the fact why he is still alive.
“No. Sirius has never, to my spy’s knowledge, interacted with The Dark Lord,” sighed Dumbledore resigning to the fact he could no longer withhold this information, especially since there was three Auror’s in attendance.
Placing the broom back into its box and into the safety of his pocket, he opened his mokeskin pouch and summoned up the items he would use to run off some energy. A hard wood flew up to land in the palm of his hand. He pulled out a new bullseye target that hadn’t been used for practice yet. Discarding it to the ground, he continued pulling out weapon after weapon until he was satisfied he would have enough practice with them all.
“Wait, how do you know I am a werewolf?” he asked with shock. “I have hardly told anyone that information.”
“It’s plausible,” hummed Drew. “Although I reckon if anyone were too, it would be your maternal Aunt.”
“How is Grayson going? I just sent him a response to his letter today,” Harry spoke up.
Molly was certain that if a large group of wizards and witches arrived to break the wards down, the whole family plus their two guests would be able to leave before they got through. Bill assured her last night that the three of them added some of the strongest wards they could perform. Although she didn’t comment on the fact that Harry could feel wards, it definitely did intrigue her. She just let it slide by for the moment and stored the information in the back of her mind.
“Where did you learn to ward like that?” the older asked, slightly nervous, but he was curious as to where he had learnt such powerful warding techniques.
"Harry Potter is not who I expected him to be," said Fred finally.
say my name, you little fuck!” yelled Vernon, eyes alight with rage.
Of course Harry noticed all the looks thrown at him. Yet he did not react, did not look back, did not give the Headmaster the satisfaction of an one-on-one interaction with him. He would not allow the man to use this time to try and get more information from him. Instead he would fortify the idea for the man that he was not here to be any other follower, doing the dirty work he himself dared not to do. Harry would make sure he would not be another pawn in the crazed man’s game of chess.
“Yes,” Parker sighed, knowing it would be a losing battle if he withheld the information from this determined guy. “Downstairs office, first door nearest to the staircase. Bottom drawer on the left side of the desk. It is under a lot of protection, you’ll need to be fast before you make an escape. Be prepared for every charm and jinx in the history of Dark Arts to be thrown at you if you are caught.”
“It was self-inflicted,” he said finally after musing on different thoughts.
"Excited are we?" Harry teased, tapping the other nipple brutally as to not leave it out of the fun.
A second popping sound indicated a new arrival which was closely followed by two more. Distant voices floated to their ears from the left, drawing their attention to the very start of the street. Four silhouetted outlines stood under a street lamp, talking and pointing to the Dursley’s house. Drew looked down at his watch to find it had taken them eight minutes to arrive since the alarm first started. Typical. Drew was glad there was no actual sense of urgency from the Order, it just confirmed his suspicions of the man in charge.
“Professor Snape will be your tutor in a few things,” he continued on with a strained calm voice. “He will help you in Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Occlumency, and training for the inevitable fight against Voldemort.”
“Yeah,” he nodded and rubbed his eyes. “Came not long after you two left. So I left it there for you.”
“Is Harry safe?” immediately asked Dumbledore, his fears could be true.
“No, it’s fine dear,” she smiled. “I don’t need any help.”
Quickly putting his wand away, Harry switched the newly transfigured hammer into his right hand. He grabbed onto the rope with his left hand, wrapped it a few times loosely around his wrist, before swiftly untying the rope from around his waist so he could move but still had a safety buffer in case he were to slip. Carefully he started to shuffle down the rope until his feet were on the brick below the windowsill and his torso was lined up with the bottom of the window. Knowing time was against him, he commenced wildly, yet with extreme control, hitting the bottom right corner of the window with the hammer. Within five strikes, he found it was beginning to shatter, spurring him on until he made the breakthrough he desperately needed.
“Narcissa!” Lucius’s voice yelled upon seeing his wife’s body lying on the floor.
"Hopefully it won't be my last one forever," he sighed.
“That’s superb,” he looked down at the flushed face with knowing eyes. “How about you come have some late lunch. You have been out here for hours.”
“He has already sent you a letter? I owe Parker double his pay on the next mission now, damn,” the man chuckled as he wiped a hand over his tired looking face.
"No, I'm reading this because I have to save you all from Voldemort," he said with a bit of bite behind his words, turning around to stare coldly at the other.
“Very much, Harry,” Dumbledore reluctantly said as he sat down in his chair, glaring at the shoes on his desk.
The young man observed the house. Eyeing the backyard, he made a decision to climb the tree that would give him a good view of inside the house. He swiftly made his way up as if he weighed nothing. Crouching in the branch, concealed by the leaves and his black attire, the young man scoured the house for any sign of life.
"Is it true? Do you really think he is alive and committed the crime instead?" ended George.
Finally, the door was opened by a flustered looking Molly. Seeing who was on the other side of the door, she stepped aside and smiled as she gestured for them to come inside. Closing the door, she led the two quiet Order members into the kitchen and continued cooking the lunch she had promised.
for when he was standing straight. He was feeling very fortunate that Drew got him these small throwing knives, it was an excellent addition to his artillery.
“Kingsley, Moody, I wasn’t expecting you back this early,” Dumbledore smiled kindly at the pair as he looked upon them through his half-mooned spectacles. “How did it all go?”
Drew stood back up once he was satisfied the two were in a suitable position. He reached down and grabbed his SP1 Marine combat knife, the perfect one to do his little experiment with. The dark grey metal didn’t reflect the light, instead engulfing it to be extra discrete. The curved, sharp edges begged to be used, to be slid across the blemished skin of its next victim. Drew did not deny the knife its wish as he sat down on the bed and brought it down to the right side of Petunia’s face, hovering it inches above the skin. Specifically choosing her right side as it was the side closest to her husband who will be playing the part of the culprit later in the play he had written for them.
“Sev? Are you here yet?” Malfoy called out as he shut the portrait behind Harry. After getting no response, Malfoy shrugged and pulled Harry over to the couch by his hand. “Would you like anything to eat or drink?”
Before Harry could continue, Dumbledore stood up furiously. He looked upon the young boy with anger for spilling a fact only a few people in the world knew. Turning his eyes to the rest of the Order, he thought quickly about how to handle this from veering into an incredibly difficult situation.
“Of course dear. I’ll let you settle in. Now if you need anything, you can find me in the living room or kitchen for the next hour. I’ll only be one floor up if you need anything throughout the night. Okay dear?” Molly asked as she levitated the suitcase out of the bedroom.
"Good boy, off you go," he shooed the owl as he stood up, stretching his back.
“Have a good night,” Charlie smiled, shaking the offered hand.
"Are you doubting my judgement, Severus?" Dumbledore asked, staring daggers at the other.
"Have you heard of Quidditch before?" Ron asked, eyes shining with excitement.
“Like Dumbledore,” nodded Drew, understanding the message behind the left out words.
“Sorry,” Hermione looked at Harry with a shy look.
“Any help Harry can get during the next month would be amazing. It’ll be up to the Headmaster in the end though,” she smiled back at the young female.
