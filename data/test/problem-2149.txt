“My name is Draco.”
“Wait a minute. Where’s my hat?”
Scorpius piped up at that with “Moony of the Padfoots, Solemnly up to Mischief…” Draco sighed and tried to stop his well meaning child from confusing their only helper.
"Damn it Potter. Why are you here?"
Harry was back at the window in the roof, watching the domestic scene with a look of love and adoration on his face. This little family had really purred their way into his heart and he wasn’t sure how to feel about helping them go home now. Harry wished desperately that he could go with them. The kittens took a minute to settle in while Draco looked on lovingly and James whispered, “Everybody wants to be a cat…”
“Oh boy! We’re gonna fly after all.” James exclaimed, dancing in place.
Harry gasped as his backside touched the sand, but that gasp soon became a moan as Draco’s hand found Harry’s cock and started to work it with quick, short strokes. Harry broke their kiss, gasping for air as his hand started to work Draco in return. Draco moaned loudly at the contact and both men started to thrust in time with each other, as if they were made to make love together. Harry moaned Draco’s name longingly and Draco kissed and nipped at Harry’s neck in response. Before long, Draco had summoned a tube to him and managed to lube up Harry, and was waiting, rather impatiently, for Harry to take him. Harry was enjoying Draco’s kisses though and loved teasing the blond, so he planned to take his time. Harry’s hand slowed its pace, wanting to prolong his teasing of Draco, and get his lover primed and ready to go. Draco’s breaths came in short bursts as Harry worked him and eventually he could no longer think well enough to kiss Harry’s neck, Draco could only feel his intense pleasure and worry about coming too early.
“Oh, he takes to water like a fish, doesn’t he?” George asked his twin. “A very enthusiastic pupil!”
The next morning, they went around packing up all of their belongings, double and triple checking that they had everything that they had brought with them. Harry wrote a note to the owner, asking to reserve this island for their next week off and thanking him for renting to them. Harry left a tip and some money for cleaning as well. The two men took a final walk down the beach before apparating back to their home, both happy to be home and a little sad that they were no longer at the beach. Draco and Harry received a confirmation owl later that night, saying they would have the BnB for the week they requested. Both men fell asleep dreaming of new things to do or try during their next stay on the island.
“Nooo. I thought you were swans.” Harry snapped back sarcastically.
Lucius mouthed “Oh, no” to himself as he tried to think of a way to get his hat back. Sirius fell asleep quickly this time around, and Lucius decided to try a diversion tactic. As Sirius slept, Lucius pushed his arm through the hay and started to scratch the dog’s belly.
“Oh, no more, please. I am really in a great deal of trouble,” Draco sighed, shaking his head.
“Ah good day Madame Luna, come in my friend. You are looking lovely as always today. With your special spectacles on as well. Do remind me, I have forgotten what they are called.”
“Moony of the Padfoots,
“Oh! Whoo-hoo! Now, now, now, boys. Boys, don’t shush your old Uncle Hagrid. Why, you’ll wake up the whole neighborhood.” Hagrid continued to talk loudly.
“That was just a lucky break for me, baby.”
“Blow it, small fry,” she encouraged him. “Blow it.” Pans Cat gently set her fedora atop his head and little Albus blew into the trumpet with all his might.
Scorpius picked up the chorus next, “because a cat’s the only cat, who knows where it’s at.” Scorpius yawned the final note, eyes shutting.
Draco let out a heartbroken sigh. “Oh, poor Madame. She will be so worried when she finds us gone.”
“And wham, when we needed you, you were right there,” Draco added leaning closer to Harry.
“Yes, he’s our uncle,” came Fred’s reply.
Draco, ever observant, looked at Harry curiously and asked, “What are you thinking about?”
“Well as you know, apart from Lucius, I have no living relatives. And with our divorce on the horizon it’s safe to say I have no living relatives at all. Naturally I want my beloved cats to always be well cared for.”
Lucius had just breathed out a sigh of relief at having avoided the police building when his sigh turned into a yelp. He hadn’t been watching where he was going and suddenly he found himself driving down a stairway, heading into the metro station. Face contorted in fear, Lucius allowed himself to go down the stairs until he found a safe place to turn and head back up. A train’s whistle filled his ears as he did so, adding to his terror because he narrowly avoided being hit by a train. He calmed down as he managed to leave the metro station behind and continued chugging along the street and over the bridge that led him out of the city –  it wouldn’t do to just drop the cats off in the city, they would be found far too easily. No, he had to ensure they were never found, or at least never returned, so into the countryside he drove.
“Goody. Father’s going to work for Mr. Potter,” Scorpius told a curious yet sleepy James.
Harry kissed Draco back longingly, deepening the kiss as he did so. Draco moaned into their kiss and Harry swallowed the sound greedily. But after just a few minutes, Draco pulled away, he wouldn’t be distracted, Harry was getting in this speedo and Draco was going to enjoy ogling his sexy dark-haired lover all night. As they broke apart, panting, Harry smiled and grabbed the speedo out of Draco’s hands and started to get changed. Draco giggled excitedly as Harry started to strip and began to change into his own speedo as well.
"Always a drama king, Malfoy. But again if you shut up, I will shut up."
“When we get to Paris, you must meet Uncle Hagrid.” Fred remarked happily.
I’m Moony of the Padfoots,
“Oh! Oh, no!” Harry looked embarrassed at this turn of events and Draco gave him a confused look, barely able to mask his exhaustion. Draco stopped looking confused as the music continued, giving the house a weary look of concern instead.
Scorpius and James joined in and yelled out Albus’s name loudly as well. All of the commotion finally woke up Albus and he poked his head out of their travel basket, yawning.
Harry felt himself blushing so he changed the subject. “What should we do today?”
Neville’s head hung down from the top of the barrel Ron was walking through, a hungry grin on his face. Ron looked up in time to see him, startled, and ran back the way he came, fearing for his life. However, a paw reached out and caught him by the tail. Ron kept trying to run for a minute before he realized it was futile, and that was when he was pulled up in the air by his tail.
“Yeah, Moony of the Padfoots,
Magnificent you are.”
“Papa, he’s been here all the time,” Scorpius called out in annoyance.
“George, George.” Fred whispered to his twin.
"You don't own this room, Potter, get out. And leave my friends out of this, besides they are fine without me. Just like everyone else."
Draco groaned at the reminder, still a little embarrassed by the whole incident before giving Harry a quick peck on the cheek and starting the search for plates. Harry made a kissy noise back at Draco since he couldn’t reach the blond and didn’t want to stop watching breakfast, he was making omelets after all. Draco smiled at the sound of Harry’s air-kiss and started setting the table. Draco then grabbed silverware and filled two mugs full of steaming coffee, adding in syrups and such to their desired tastes. As Draco sat down at the table, Harry put an omelet on his plate before starting to make his own. The rest of the breakfast foods finished before Harry’s omelet so he divided the sausage and bacon amongst their plates as he waited. Once his omelet finished, Harry sat down with a happy sigh and smiled at Draco.
“That’s exactly what they are, Luna. They’re the start of my new foundation.”
“Hey there. You’re coming on. I bet you’re a real tiger in your neighborhood,” Harry said kindly.
“Tell me, everybody’s picking up on that wizard beat,
"Oh that's rich coming from the "Chosen One" who literally did a tell all story in the Quibbler a few years ago. You sure you know how to be quiet?"
“But he was close,” Neville comforted.
“Why didn’t you answer?” countered James.
Draco blushed at the reminder, he loved seeing Harry in a thigh holster, add the speedo to that and Draco was in for an amazing and sexier than normal view today. He couldn’t wait to get started, but he didn’t want to rush his meal either. They ate the rest of their breakfast a little faster than usual, both wanting to get out to the cavern and have their way with each other. Plus sharks sounded like a fun new adventure for them to share together. Draco finished eating first, gave Harry a kiss, put his plate in the sink and ran to pack a bag for their adventure. Harry shook his head as he finished his own food and cleaned the dishes. He took his time doing this chore and cleaning up the kitchen table because he knew Draco loved packing especially for fun trips. Even small hikes required some sort of a pack for each of them. When the cleaning was done, Harry went to their room to get changed. Draco was already in his speedo, and the blond greeted Harry with a smile.
“Come on, cats, we gotta split.” Pansy called to her gang as they ran out of the alley and onto the sidewalk.
Meanwhile the kittens were watching the geese curiously. James had taken to staring at their feet, thoroughly confused by them.
“Now let’s leave Albus to his painting.” Draco said to his other two kittens once James had recovered from his laughing fit. “Now dear you go to the piano, run along.” Draco said as he booped Scorpius lovingly.
“Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this music into rum.” One of the wands started to smoke but otherwise nothing of note happened. Seamus chuckled and whispered to James, “That’s a hot one.” James giggled while still playing the piano in time with the upbeat jazz tempo. Pansy was back up dancing and swinging with her trumpet, lost in the music.
“Oh, messieurs, thank you so much for helping Mr. Potter.” Draco thanked the geese profusely.
“Where did you find this again? I know I was skeptical at first but it truly is beautiful here,” Draco mused as he stared at their rather lush master bedroom.
When the sandwich was gone, Harry cast a bubble-head charm on himself and jumped back into the water, splashing Draco who squealed in mock indignation before collapsing into a fit of giggles. Harry was laughing as he came back to the surface, he loved splashing Draco, especially when the blond wasn’t expecting it. Draco cast a charm on himself before jumping into the water, landing rather expertly, on Harry. Both men started to sink but as they didn’t need to worry about oxygen, they just let themselves fall. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling the blond in close, their charms merging to create a bigger bubble of air as their lips met in a passionate kiss. The rocky surface touching their feet startled the men apart, and they chuckled at their surprise, realizing that they had been far too lost in each other to be paying attention. They walked around the bottom of the pool for a few minutes, collecting some beautiful seashells from the floor before returning to the surface to deposit their treasures.
“Keep your head up, Scorpius! Here I come!” Harry yelled, diving off the bridge and into the river below.
“Hagrid?” Harry asked, curious at the name.
Harry made an incredulous face at the two twins, still rather annoyed at them. He didn’t quite understand their sense of humor. And on top of that…he didn’t like the fact that they had nearly gotten him killed.
“Sounds like Pans Cat and her gang have dropped by,” Harry explained with a small chuckle.
They walked together hand in hand to the cavern, it was a warm day but walking was far more comfortable than apparating. The heat didn’t bother them as much as they were barely wearing any clothes and as the sun beat down on them, a nice breeze whipped around their bodies. Harry’s hair was a mess once more and Draco’s had even started to falter somewhat. They set their packs within a natural divot in the rock outside the cavern before disrobing and adding their robes to the pile. Harry led Draco to the entryway of the cavern and smiled as he heard a gasp come from the blond.
“I love you too Harry.” Draco practically moaned his response.
Harry had jumped on top of the truck’s hood by then and was hanging upside down, front paws on the windshield, still yowling loudly. He shook his head back and forth, trying to mess up the driver’s ability to see. Rosmerta swerved violently for a few minutes until her brakes finally stopped her runaway truck. The truck came to a screeching halt, causing all of the cats to flinch at the sound. Rosmerta hopped out of her truck livid.
“We’d best get Uncle Hagrid to bed.” Fred managed to reply before Uncle Hagrid crashed into them.
All three kittens jumped for the door at the same time, but instead of being stuck like usual, they all fell on their bottoms because the door didn’t open! Rubbing their noses and sitting up, the kittens looked at each other confused.
“I got him! I got him!” Remus yelled victoriously.
Lucius deflated at Luna’s words but did his best to remain cordial regardless. “She is upstairs and she is expecting you,” was his reply. A moment later, Luna’s hat ended up on his head, as she had tossed it at him while heading towards the giant staircase.
“Ha-ha, groove it cats!” Blaise added excitedly.
“Hi Ron!” The kittens waved.
Back at the mansion, Ron had an idea, and so he waited with Hermione to try and follow Lucius. Both animals were avidly looking out of the stable window, waiting for the perfect time to put Ron’s plan into action. Ron saw the blond coming out of the mansion and turned to face the horse.
“Sh! No!” George said catching his crazy uncle before he could crash into the pavement.
“I love you Draco.”
Ron ran down from the window and his hiding spot, yelling at the cats and trying to warn them as he ran. “Look out for the-- Ron called, tripping before he could finish his warning in time.
James was the first kitten to follow. Scorpius gave Potter a longing look as he sighed and followed behind his father. Albus followed but stopped to show off his alley cat skills to Potter first.
“Uncle Hagrid,” Fred chided his uncle jokingly, “I do believe you’ve been drinking.”
Draco started to work on his own erection because he wanted to finish at the same time as Harry. Draco’s pleasure was already pushing him to the verge of coming but he had a feeling that Harry would finish inside him soon. A tell tale sign of that came as Harry started to slow down just a little bit and kiss and nip his way down Draco’s back. Harry loved to add more sensations as he got closer to finishing, wanting them to both finish at the same time, or as close together as possible. Draco moaned at the kisses and gasped in pleasure at the nips, still working his own cock, trying to match speed with Harry. That proved impossible however as the man started to pummel him hard and fast once more, so Draco did his best to stroke himself while thrusting back against Harry. It was such a wonderful sensation to be so in sync and in love with another person, that Draco didn’t think it would ever get old. Harry thrust a few more times before roaring out Draco’s name and filling the blond up with his white hot seed. Draco yelled out Harry’s name as he felt his lover fill him to the brim and as he was filled, he felt his own cum leave him forcefully, ripping through his entire body as he orgasmed. Harry stayed inside Draco for a few minutes, catching his breath before gently pulling out of his lover.
Harry returned in his boxers, wanting to be comfortable and not really feeling the need to have a shirt on. They sat down to eat lunch, digging in happily while they discussed ideas for how to spend the rest of their day. Harry and Draco were both rather tired so they decided to stay inside and play some games for the rest of the night. They started off playing Clue, which is rather hard with just two people, but both men loved the challenge. Draco had recently found an old muggle game and had bought it immediately, so when they were done with Clue, Draco ran to his suitcase to grab his surprise. Harry watched curiously, slightly worried about what Draco had found because Draco had a mischievous look on his face. Sure enough, Harry groaned when he saw the game in Draco’s hand, he had found Twister!
Draco heard his son’s yelling and walked briskly into the living room from the foyer where he had been bird watching out of one of the large windows. As he entered the living room he slowed his pace and calmed himself to speak kindly.
“Well, darlings, I just don’t know,” Draco answered sadly. “It does look hopeless, doesn’t it?”
“No poetry to cover the situation, Monsieur Potter?” Draco asked.
“Good riddance!” He added as he threw a hat at the bird before slamming the door.
“Well, they’re kinda rough, you know, around the edges, but if you’re ever in a jam, wham, they’re right there.”
“I like the tree-trea-treacle tart like they make back home,” came the first line of a song from a lovely male voice. Draco’s head popped up, instantly curious. His silver eyes were wide and his ears perked as he listened attentively.
“Oh, Harry. Thank goodness you’re safe.” Draco exclaimed, sighing in relief. His grey eyes silver with happiness once more.
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” Harry asked quietly.
Harry made a grumpy face at the words, and just glared at the geese while they finished their instructions.
“Strictly high button shoes,” Pansy said to Draco.
Cuz everything else is obsolete.”
“Papa? Do we have to waddle like they do?” James asked after a minute of attempting to copy the geese’s walking patterns.
“Oof. Oof. Well I’m right here!” Remus answered as he tried to free his ear.
When they got to the end of the slide, Harry whispered “Hold your breath Draco darling.”
“That’s my hat. I’m the leader.”
“Oh Luna.” Narcissa cries out amid her laughter as the other woman dips her. Draco’s silver eyes watch the two women expectantly, but Luna merely wiggles her eyebrows at Narcissa once more before helping her right herself and waltzing across the floor in time to the music. Scorpius and Albus dance around the women’s feet, enjoying the music and the joviality of the moment. Unnoticed by everyone, James has gone from holding the crank of the gramophone to sitting atop the spinning record and jumping over the needle. As the women start on their fourth lap of the room, James can no longer keep up with the pace of the record and trips over the needle. He flops face first into the record, with his little kitten legs and tail up in the air. He then gets underneath the needle as the record attempts to spin one more time, but the music slows and starts to sound off before stopping.
“Oh, Lucius, they’re back.” Narcissa called as she neared the bottom of the stairs. “I heard them. Hurry, hurry, let them in.”
“What foundation?” Luna countered, confusion written on her face.
“Oh. Oh, what a horrible, horrible human.” Draco said disgusted, while they watched Rosmerta from a safe distance.
Draco stood up gracefully before turning to open his suitcase. It took him a few minutes of digging but sure enough, Draco found what he was looking for. Harry had been watching the blond apprehensively, wondering what Draco could have bought him for the beach. Harry had a guess… and if he was right, let’s just say Harry was glad they had the whole island to themselves. Sure enough, Draco pulled out a speedo…two of them actually. They were a matching set, both made of a sparkly fabric, and rainbow striped. Harry could feel his face getting warm and knew he was bright red. Draco’s silver eyes shone bright with excitement, and yet the hint of mischievousness remained, written all over the blond’s face.
Harry chortled, “Don’t make promises you can’t keep. But maybe I should invest in a mattress for this office…” Harry mused, still laughing as they got dressed.
“So long as you like having me around that’s all that counts, I guess,” Harry said with a joking glare at Draco.
“Quite. We must correct him.” The two brothers got into the water and floated over to the black cat.
Then all three of the kittens had climbed to the rim of the cream canister and were lapping it up hungrily. Draco looked over at Harry, smitten with this black cat who was somehow worldly, rough around the edges, and sweet with kids all at the same time.
“I will be there in about ten minutes IF you stop messaging and distracting me.” Harry typed the message quickly, wanting to get out of here and drop this stupid argument they were having.
“Now, Scorpius, darling, don’t be frightened…” Draco started to say but he was cut off by the sound of James calling out for him.
“I know. And poor Madame didn’t sleep a wink, either.”
Harry was dancing side to side with a flourish now, moving closer to Draco and then moving away. Albus had gotten too into his dancing for Scorpius’s liking as the ginger kitten ran into his sibling. Scorpius elbowed Albus away and glared at him briefly, before returning his attention to Harry. Harry stopped right next to Draco’s face, loving the way  the white cat was smiling as he finished the last few lines of his song.
“Won’t you join us, Monsieur Ron?” Draco invited the mouse.
“But someday we might meet a tough alley cat.” Albus supplied from his spot atop the table. Then he jumped down gracefully and started to meow, shake and spit all at the same time. His best impersonation of an alley cat.
“This music...Narcissa. It’s from Carmen, isn’t it?”
“He’s glad to see us.” James remarked.
“Fight fair Scorpius!” James complained as Scorpius caught James’s ribbon in his mouth and pulled.
Harry sighed and got out of bed, still flushed but accepting his fate. He could rarely bring himself to tell Draco no, especially when it came to trivial things like this. Sure, Harry wouldn’t like to strut around in that speedo in the middle of Diagon Alley, but here on an island, with just the two of them? Harry would definitely wear a rainbow speedo to keep that light in Draco’s eyes.
Narcissa sighed on the porch, shrinking in on herself in her grief. “Oh, it’s no use, Lucius. I’m afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady.” Narcissa re-entered her home clutching her head as she shook it side to side. “But I was so sure that I heard them.”
Remus, still asleep replied, “That’s all right.”
The kittens ran to the train tracks immediately, an idea in mind. The tracks were part of a bridge and it was huge.
Harry stood at the end of the sidewalk, watching the door, hoping that maybe it would open up again soon and Draco would ask him to stay with them. Or that Draco would say he wanted to live with Harry. But nothing of the sort seemed to be happening so Harry sighed to himself before speaking.
“Heavens!” She screamed hitting the brakes hard, and her poor delivery truck screeched out at the force.
Sirius walked next to Remus and looked down at him before answering. “Cause I outrank you, that’s why. Now stop beating your gums and sound the attack.”
“Ow! Now, that hurt.” Scorpius complained looking up at his other brother. “Papa! Papa!” He yelled.
“Right under that magic carpet.” Harry answered, putting his paw on the tarpaulin covering the giant cans of cream. “But we have to cook up a little spell.” Harry winked on the word ‘spell’, and continued. “You know. Ready?”
Scorpius walked over to his brother and his father, doing his best imitation of the frog, which caused James to shrink down and try to hide in their dad’s fur. Scorpius giggled happily at his brother’s discomfort, enjoying his moment of feeling superior.
Harry returned the smile with a wink as he enjoyed the view before him. Draco’s lightly muscled torso shimmered from the effect of their sunblock potion and his bulge in that speedo did things to Harry’s sanity. Draco started to fasten his thigh holster and Harry forced himself to look away and change, otherwise, they would never leave the room. As he changed Harry focused on his breathing, trying to calm himself down a bit so that they could actually do some swimming when they arrived at the cavern. Draco whistled from behind Harry as the dark-haired man changed in front of him. Harry felt himself blush, but shook his ass for Draco, enjoying the attention. Draco whistled more as Harry shook for him before breaking out into a giggle fit at their playful antics. It had been forever since they were both able to be so relaxed. Harry finished changing, tossed on a thin robe for their walk and tucked his wand into his own thigh holster. Draco watched Harry move with rapt attention, drinking his fill of the sexy man before him.
Draco lay down on the towel, and Harry started to get him ready immediately. Once both men were oiled up, Harry entered Draco slowly, giving the blond a minute before starting to move. Draco gasped in ecstasy as Harry entered him, he felt he would never tire of being filled by the dark-haired man. Harry moaned in response to the sounds of Draco’s pleasure, loving how tight Draco was. Harry kissed his way up Draco’s back as he continued to thrust inside the blond, timing his kisses so that he could keep a slow and steady pace. Draco arched his back into Harry’s attention and kept pace perfectly with his lover. Harry picked up the pace again, starting to nip at Draco’s back as he started to pound into the blond.
“I’m scratching as fast as I can,” Remus responded as his own foot started to twitch in his sleep.
“Now, my darling, don’t be frightened. You’ll see...” Draco’s soothing words were drowned out by an even louder thunderclap. Scorpius screamed and ran towards the basket.
“Cats inherit first?” Lucius cried out as if the idea was causing him physical pain. “And I come after the cats? I, me, after…No. It’s…it’s not fair.” Lucius stood up in his indignation and hit his head on the pipe he had been eavesdropping through.
"Ooooh did I find a touchy subject, Potter?"
They landed on a ledge a little bit under the track. Harry wrapped his paw around Draco and the kittens to try and hold everyone in place while the train thundered over the tracks above them. The bridge shook with the speed of the train and Draco stared up in horror, terrified that this wouldn’t end well. Harry and Draco switched to both clinging to the post and pressing the kittens against it to get a better grip to combat the continued trembling of the bridge. When the train finally left the bridge, Harry, Draco, Albus and James slowly poked their heads up through the gap in the tracks. And that is when they heard the shout.
“It’s squeaky shoes approaching,” Sirius argued.
“How about…Malfoy? Huh?” Ron questioned himself even as he spoke.
“Oh my goodness Lucius, I know Luna.” Narcissa responded as the wild haired blonde in odd spectacles entered the room. All three of the kittens meowed happily at the new arrival and ran to circle her feet. However they kept a good eye on her movements as none of them were stepped on.
“OWW!” cried Lucius and got the adrenaline to jump out of his ridiculous position and into the air. Somehow he landed sitting on his motorbike, so he grabbed the handlebars and kept steering himself away from the two vicious dogs who had ended up going the opposite direction. Sirius and Remus were so busy watching the man get away that they didn’t realize they were headed right for a trough. The sidecar smacked into it and sent the dogs flying into the mud, face first. Lucius turned to look behind him just in time to see the dogs land with a splat. He cackled at the sight as he kept going…though what he didn’t realize is that he was driving directly into the windmill. He got in through the opening no problem…it was the crash through the back wall that hurt. Lucius ducked his head as far down as he could to get through the wall, and then he was back over the bridge where he had run into the dogs and out of sight.
“Remus. Hey, Remus,” Sirius said as he stopped right next to the bale of hay, not looking down at his feet and therefore not noticing his paw had stepped on one of the basset hound’s long ears.
“Hey, wait for me! You don’t know the way!” Ron yelled at the stampede of cats as he jumped from the crate and gave chase. It wouldn’t help anyone if they went to the wrong house.
“And they are very fond of you,” Draco admitted happily, neither adult realizing that all three of said kittens were currently eavesdropping from the window. “Yeah…” James agreed before being shushed by Scorpius.
“I’ll show her.” Albus said jumping down the step of the hut and hissing and spitting at the truck in the distance.
“Hey! What’s all the yelling about, huh?” Albus asked, still half asleep.
“You’re nothing but a brother!” James added, grabbing hold of Scorpius’s tail. He pulled his brother back until Scorpius’s but hit the door in a very ungraceful way. Scorpius grunted in annoyance as his well styled fur fell into his eyes. James then jumped over Scorpius and out of the door.
“Uncle Hagrid!” Fred called out.
Harry pressed his body up against Draco’s and slowly wrapped his arms around his lover’s hips, hugging him loosely. Draco smiled as their kiss broke and he laid his head on Harry’s shoulder soaking up the love and comfort he was receiving. They stayed like that for a while, in a loose yet comfortable and love filled hug, the rest of the world completely forgotten. Harry slowly started to help Draco get sand out of his hair as they both shivered slightly, reminding them that it was in fact, night time. They rinsed off rather quickly after that before using their wands to find their robes and discarded trunks before racing back into the house. Once inside, Harry and Draco hung up their wet clothes, grabbed new towels and hopped in the shower. Both men wanted to try and get more sand off of their bodies, plus the warmth would be refreshing. Draco and Harry took turns washing each others’ bodies and ensuring that no grain of sand stuck to them. It took Draco a while to get all of the sand out of Harry’s hair causing Harry to feel bad about it, so he helped Draco because the poor man’s arms had to be tired. With both of them sorting through it, Harry’s hair was sand free again in no time. Draco shook his head in mock indignation at how challenging Harry’s mop had been.
“No, no. This is no time for fun and games.” But all they could see were bubbles on the water, no sign of the cat anywhere. After a few more seconds, the twins stopped laughing, starting to worry.
“Come on Ron, have some!” James encouraged.
Pansy’s jazz band was playing loudly in the piano room, color changing lights and all. Draco and Harry were already dancing together, and the kittens were all getting into the groove too. The cats all sang together, “Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat.” Ron was dancing atop the piano, acting as if he was conducting the band, but not singing along, just smiling at them all.
“Gentlemen do not start fights, but they can finish them.” Scorpius sassed back, shaking his hind end in superiority. He had always been the most well behaved of his siblings, and he enjoyed rubbing that in whenever he could.
Ron had just made it to the motorcycle when the door to the stable creaked open. Lucius stood at the doorway for a minute, face contorted by his evil plans, making the fishing pole he was carrying seem menacing. He walked on his toes into the stable, acting like a cop could possibly be hiding out with the horse. Not seeing anyone, he started to talk to his steed.
Harry joins up with Draco and his family, not wanting to let them down. "Magic Carpet" ride, Harry almost drowns and the cats meet some twin geese and their crazy uncle.
“How come you always grab the tender part for yourself?” Remus complained, looking up at Sirius. He tripped over one of his long ears since he had moved his line of sight and fell sideways with an “oof”.
Remus scratched himself lazily as he replied, “I still say it was a little old cricket bug.”
“Evening Lucius, and they are Spectrespecs, do try to keep up. Now then where is the Madam of the house? I have missed my dear Narcissa. Also no matter how you flatter me, I refuse to be on your side and argue your case with her.”
“Move!” Harry yelled as he turned to run towards his love. “Just tell ‘em Potter sent you, and you won’t have a bit of trouble.”
Lucius recovered quickly from the attack and ran towards this new nuisance, hands outstretched and ready to fight. Hermione however, was not about to let this wretched excuse for a man get away with harming her friends. As Lucius ran past her, Hermione grabbed his coattails in her mouth and pulled hard. Lucius stopped for a moment and spun around, trying to figure out what he was caught on. He pulled his jacket until it ripped, and turned back to the wide doors. He was stuck for a few minutes and Lucius had to pull with all his might. After a final hard tug, the door opened and Lucius was sent flying backwards over the trunk and onto the hard floor. Desperate to save Draco and his kittens, Harry walked up to the trunk and pressed his body against it. Trying to keep it in place as Lucius began to push it outside once more. Harry’s cat body was no match for Lucius and the trunk, but Hermione’s strong legs would prove useful. As Harry started to fall over from exhaustion, Hermione stomped her front legs down in front of the trunk as it passed her stall.
Lucius’s running made more noise than just his attempted stealth, and as the man disappeared behind the hay pile next to the dogs, Sirius registered the noise. His ear shot up at the same time that his eyes opened wide. He listened for a minute before deciding to wake his partner.
Hermione nickered at Narcissa’s words, wanting recognition for her good job as well. Narcissa turned to the beautiful light brown horse with a smile and walked over to her.
James ran as fast as his little legs could carry him, not caring about the water splashing at his feet. He didn’t want to be eaten by whatever big mouthed thing was there hiding in the tall grass.
“Please get the kittens for me and tuck them into bed. They seem to be tuckered out after the excitement of today. I can manage Draco on my own but not all four.”
“Ooof. Ow.” Remus and Sirius grumbled as they sat up in the hay.
“Did you see him?” Remus stuttered.
“Of course, my dear. But first, introductions.” Fred said excitedly.
Harry made a face at the comb and the odd sensation of a brush on top of his head but he didn’t pull away. She parted his fur a bit, and he was sure that she was making him look silly, but Narcissa kept talking, unaware of Harry’s discomfort. “Shall we keep him in the family?” Narcissa asked of her cats, to which the kittens meowed a resounding yes. Narcissa laughed as she put away the comb and started to walk back towards the camera. “Of course we will, we need another man around the house. And Luna, we must be sure to provide for their future little ones.”
“Ooops! Oh dear. Slip of the hand and it’s off to dreamland. I say, that’s not all that bad. Slip of the hand, dreamland.” Lucius chuckled at his cleverness.
“Where every note is out of sight,” Draco sang the final line of the song beautifully before Pansy started the jazz back up with only a few notes from her trumpet.
“Please, please let me explain. Harry is a dear friend of ours. He’s just helping us to get to…”
“Narcissa, what’s that music? Sounds like a gang of swinging hepcats.” Luna commented, dancing with her walking stick happily.
“Each other is clearly the obvious answer,” Draco replied with a sexy smirk.
“Likewise, Draco,” Pansy replied, kissing Draco’s offered paw. “You’re too much.”
"Oh right yeah that makes sense I guess, it just seemed like maybe you knew of someone else here who supposedly needed me. Granted that is laughable now that I think about it..."
Huffing, Scorpius took off after James replying, “I’ll show you if I’m a gentleman or not.” They chased each other for a minute before James managed to trip his sibling. From the safety of the ottoman, Albus cheered on James as he watched.
"I do believe I am already there. I came here to relax and now that plan is out the window as you arrived and ruined my ability to relax. Especially with your constant need to talk to me."
That I’m,” Harry gracefully jumped to the tree behind the white cat, which was full of beautiful blossoms, just asking to be rained down upon such a beautiful creature. He slid down a long and sturdy branch and used his front paws to wiggle it, sending petals floating down onto the cat below.
Thank you for the beta Vukovich!
A few pages of paperwork later, Harry’s phone buzzed again. He decided that since he was almost finished with his case file, it would be okay to ignore this current message and just power through to the end and text Draco as he handed the file in. That would give Draco something to be happy about, instead of Draco potentially getting more annoyed at him. It wasn’t Harry’s fault he had been so busy at work, an upsurge in Wizarding crime had really messed with his schedule. It’s not like he paid the criminals to do bad shit that required him to have to hunt them down.
“It’s Lucius!” Scorpius cried out.
“Sorry handsome, you know me. Always feeling like I am forgetting to pack something… or finally remembering where I put a surprise new outfit, which means I have to add something before I can leave. I don’t want to leave something cute or sexy behind, especially not for a beach vacation!”
“Yup. And she goes all the way to Timbuktu,” was the response. The two person team lifted the trunk into the back of the truck with a heave-ho, unaware of their animal audience. As the truck drove off, every animal had a smile on their face. They were all safe, rather unharmed and the bad man was going to Timbuktu! Little Albus ran out after the truck, spitting and hissing in his best alley cat impression. Draco and Harry both chuckled at the little tiger’s spunk. Ron and the cat clowder thanked Hermione for her help, before leaving the stable to check out their new home. Draco was hopeful that Madame would have room in her heart for all of them. After all, their mansion was big enough.
“Boy, he blew it,” Seamus chuckled.
“Ready, everyone.  Now, think goose.” George instructed from the front of the line. When he spoke, Fred started to walk, with George right behind him.
Once they had finished changing, Draco spent a few minutes just staring at Harry, unable to speak. Harry did love it when Draco was rendered speechless. It didn’t happen often, but the heat of Draco’s eyes was making him blush. Harry stared back at Draco just as intently, figuring that fair was fair, and he was rewarded as a brilliant pink flush filled Draco’s cheeks.
He struggled to breathe, and the exhaust proved to be too much for him. Unable to hold on any longer between his coughs and the jerkiness of the motorbike, he went flying from the bike, landing with a thud against the curb. Ron’s hat fell to the ground in front of him, and he pulled up his goggles to watch Lucius. His fur was black from the exhaust and he was still coughing as the evil man sped away into the night. Ron climbed up the curb to get out of the street to recover from his adventure before starting the walk home.
“Careful Madame, please! Dreadfully sorry Madame.” He rushed out the words in a hurry as he realized he had basically started to hug this woman.
Draco meowed happily up at Narcissa as he stretched to give her a hug. Madame held him close, hugging him in return while still holding onto little Scorpius with her other hand. Draco and Scorpius booped Narcissa’s face lovingly as a sign of affection while purring. With his father distracted, Albus seized his chance to go bother the driver of the carriage, Lucius. Lucius was their Madam’s soon to be ex husband but he was currently in denial about that fact. He had resorted to taking on butler duties to try and convince Narcissa to let him stay. Though Lucius had treated her very badly so Albus didn’t see the harm in making his life more difficult. Which would be why the orange kitten was currently climbing up the side of Lucius’s face as he drove the carriage, wanting to play with the man’s hair ribbon. Lucius had really long hair that he tied back with a ribbon, and the ribbon looked like a perfect cat toy. Getting up on the side of Lucius’s face Albus felt a sense of victory before reaching out his paw to bat at the ribbon playfully.
Unaffected by Albus’s look of disdain, Scorpius lifts his head up as high as he can while stuck in the door before responding. “Because I’m a gentleman, that’s why.” Scorpius then jumped out of the door gracefully, preparing to trot away victorious.
“Lucius?” Asked Luna incredulously. Do you mean to say you’re leaving your vast fortune to your soon to be ex-husband? Everything you possess? Stocks and bonds? This mansion? Your country chateau? Your treasures, jewels and…”
When Narcissa checked the living room on her way up to bed, she saw all of her sweet cats sound asleep. She picked up Draco in her arms and cradled him lovingly before taking the elevator up to her room. Narcissa passed Lucius on her way and whispered to him.
“Come now handsome, let’s get changed into our swimsuits and head to the beach! I am ready to see you in the new trunks I bought for you,” Draco said with a mischievous wink at Harry as he rolled off the bed.
“Lucius? Oh, darling, why, that’s... Why, that’s ridiculous,” Draco replied soothingly.
“Well some humans are like that Draco. I’ve learned to live with it.” Harry shrugged.
“The other cats will all commence,
Harry, Draco, and the kittens watched out a window as Pans Cat and her gang disappeared into the night. Still singing and playing their loud music, they were joined by other alley cats as they went. Once they were no longer visible, and even the music had faded, Draco ushered his exhausted litter into bed. They tucked themselves in with Draco’s help, and each kitten slid down the pillow, into the open space between the bed and the blanket. Except for Albus, who trotted across the bed in his alley cat style and received a grooming attempt from his dad before tucking himself into the blanket easily.
As soon as the towel was lifted off the tray the kittens were drinking their treat. Draco joined them after Lucius had gone and they ate in a happy silence, enjoying the food immensely. Ron, the mouse that lived in their house, had smelled the food being brought out. He sniffed happily before running to grab a cracker and clearing his throat to get Draco’s attention.
“Yeah, maybe you fell on your head, Albus,” James joked.
Draco read the first short story in the book, one involving a wizard and his friends who enjoyed pranks a little too much, which always made them laugh. It reminded Harry of the twins and their antics at school and he always wished he could think of fun little pranks to pull every now and then to make others smile. When Draco and Harry’s laughter had subsided, Draco put the book on the nightstand and finished his tea with a contented sigh. Harry had finished his cup while Draco was reading so he headed to the bathroom once more before taking off his glasses and settling down under the blankets. Draco finished his tea, performed his night time skincare ritual and then joined Harry in bed. Draco curled up with his head on Harry’s chest and fell asleep to the sensation of Harry gentling playing with his hair. Harry stroked Draco’s head until the blond fell sound asleep, following suit not long after, something about holding Draco close always helped him fall asleep.
“What’s gonna happen to us?” Albus asked pitifully, watching the rain start to fall.
“Yes, dear. Think goose.”
“Go away. I’m trying to get to shore.” Harry growled when he sank into the water once more.
“This patootie?” Harry asked, shaking his ass back and forth in front of Draco for a minute.
“Mm. Delicious. Double delicious.” Ron commented as he finished his cracker. “This calls for another cracker. I’ll be right back!” Ron called as he went back to his home.
Smell the flames of green,”
“It sure was, and what a finale,” Harry agreed.
“And how we celebrated your success.” Luna wiggled her eyebrows before continuing to speak. “Champagne, dancing the night away…” Luna stopped speaking in order to hum along with the music now, dancing gracefully with her arms out around her.
“Yeah, old pickle-puss Lucius.” James agreed, laughing as well.
A frog croaked near the scared and confused kitten and James asked, “Papa?”
“Look, they got rubber feet.” James commented.
Seamus let Ron down onto a crate and he huffed as he grabbed his hat back and jammed it on his head. “You’re darn tootin’ I’m on the level.” Ron agreed.
Harry groaned as he typed. “I think you are cock sick love. No, that doesn’t count, stop texting me and I will be home sooner.”
“Yes I know, that’s why wizard BnB’s are such a nice thing for us. We already have the spell to get in and no one is there waiting on us. However, I would really like to get you into the ocean before sunset. So shall we get going, my love? I assume your suitcase is completely packed this time?” Harry said gently, pulling Draco into a hug now that he had an empty hand.
“Not to worry Rutherford, I’ve got him, it’s me he wants anyway. But thank you for your efforts.
Luna Lovegood arrived in a rickety car that seemed to constantly backfire as she drove, making it easy to tell when she was approaching. Her nargle inspired hat had become skewed due to the jerkiness of the car so she straightened it before getting out. She sang loudly as she exited her car, not caring if she was on tune or not, nor caring if she drew the attention of others. She had always been eccentric, but she was good at her job and that is why her clients loved her. Luna nearly tripped over the curb, too busy checking for wrackspurts in the general vicinity to pay attention to the lay of the land.
This ultimately sent Lucius, his motorcycle, and the sidecar holding Draco and his kittens off the road and down a steep hill leading to the river below. As his bike clunked and thudded down the incline, the bassinet with Draco and his babies fell out of the sidecar and flipped a few times before landing on the edge of the river. Thankfully, none of the cats had fallen out during the fall, but Lucius wasn’t paying attention. He was too afraid of the blasted dogs chasing him to care about the cats he had been trying to get rid of anyways. He drove his bike into the river and somehow managed to turn to go under the bridge, Sirius and Remus still hot on his trail. Lucius was underwater and then he was circling the underside of the bridge, and he did it again, unable to get out of the rut for a minute. After his second turn, Lucius managed to steer out of the river, and up the opposite side of where he had originally fallen in. His motorcycle was going so fast that it caught air on the way up, using the hill as a ramp and he landed with a hard thud. Lucius nearly fell off his bike at that and had to hang on to his handlebars for dear life.
“Fancy that. A cat learning how to swim.” George agreed, watching Harry in the river and mistakenly thinking the cat wanted to be in the water.
“They’re black…Now, how would I know that?” Sirius grumbled at Remus, who slid further into his basket in an attempt to avoid the glare coming at him.
Sirius had been ready for an escape attempt from this intruder and so when the man jumped, so did Sirius, biting into the man’s bottom to stay with him. Sirius was determined not to lose his prey and held onto the man through a full turn of the blades. He tried to pull the man off when their blade was near the ground again, but to no avail. Instead, Sirius ended up on the ground with yet another piece of the man’s trousers in his mouth. He stood there for a minute trying to get his bearings and then out of nowhere the motorbike ran him over! He was fine, just shocked and in some pain mostly, his ears stood up on end as he watched the motorbike run off without a driver. Remus rounded the side of the windmill at a record pace, eyes getting wide as he saw Sirius on the ground. Before he could swerve to avoid running over his friend, Remus felt the pole of one of the blades pick him up by his collar and he was unable to break free.
Draco sat in the carriage with Narcissa, enjoying the ride and the view of the city as Hermione trotted along. Scorpius, his only son that resembled him, all white with silver eyes that matched his own, sat in between himself and their loving owner. Apart from their size difference, the only way to tell Draco and Scorpius apart was their collars. Scorpius had a green bow tie around his neck and Draco had a fancy silver collar studded with diamonds. Draco watched apprehensively as little James, his all black kitten, walked across Hermione’s back to play with the horse’s hat. When James had made it safely on top of the horse’s hat, Draco let out his breath, which he hadn’t realized he had been holding. Cats could land on their feet, even kittens, but if they landed only to be trampled by horse hooves or carriage wheels…well that would be disastrous. Madam’s voice interrupted Draco’s worry spiral as she started to coo at Scorpius.
Hermione watched the fall with tremendous glee, part of her wishing Lucius had been hurt. Her look turned into one of concern and terror though, when she saw that Lucius had picked up a pitchfork and was stabbing at the hay, trying to skewer Potter! Harry managed to dig himself out of the hay unharmed, but Lucius spotted him immediately. The blond man chased Harry into a corner, trapping him in front of the side door and Harry turned to face him, terrified. Lucius ran, swinging the pitchfork and missing Harry by a breath. But Harry wasn’t sure the man's next attack would, so he closed his eyes as Lucius wound up and threw the pitchfork at the black cat. Hermione whinnied loudly in terror, certain that the poor hero cat was lost. Turns out, Lucius had a terrible aim and Harry was merely trapped against the wall by the pitchfork, his slim build keeping him firmly between two of the prongs.
Sirius and Remus barked as they gave chase, not about to let someone come onto their property and get away with it. They caught up to the haystack easily, and both of them jumped into the hay together, teeth bared and ready to attack.
Hagrid screamed in shock, having been startled out of his drunken reverie rather suddenly at the sound of his name. “Fred! George! My two favorite noophews!” Hagrid yelled back between hiccups.
Rosmerta glared up at the black cat while yelling, “Sacre bleu!” She tried to catch the cat atop her head but he jumped off immediately and dashed out of the back of the truck. “Thieves! Robbers! Mangy tramps! Take that! And that!” Rosmerta shouted as she got out of the truck and started to throw a wrench and other supplies at the escaping animals. Scorpius tripped over a hole in the ground, and Harry grabbed him by the scruff to move him away from the angry person. They ran over some train tracks in their escape before entering a small hut on the other side and hiding within.
“Thank you Miss Hermione, for letting me ride on your back.” James amended.
“But she called us tramps.” Albus argued.
“Of course not. That’s pure Harry Potter, baby. Right off the cuff. I got a million of them,” Harry explained with a chuckle.
“I wish we were home with Madame right now,” Albus lamented.
Draco  steadily watched this black and somehow auburn furred cat sing and dance, entranced by the way the cat moved. His voice was smooth and steady, and he seemed so sure of himself. Draco couldn’t look away. As the cat continued dancing, Draco noticed an odd mark in the middle of the cat’s forehead. It looked like a bolt of lightning, and it was the only bit of white on this cat’s body. Harry Potter continued to dance as he moved on to his second verse.
Ron yelled as the motorcycle sped off, and he had to turn around quickly to grab hold of the frame so that he wouldn’t fall off. Lucius had put down his riding goggles and sped out of the barn so fast that his legs somehow raised above his head. He managed to get his feet back to where they should be as he peeled away, still going too fast to be safe, but he was on a mission. Poor Ron was sat inside the tail light, bumping his head and his bottom on the edges as the motorcycle drove on the cobblestone road. The bumps combined with a sharp turn sent Ron flying out of his hiding spot, he managed to grab a hold of the license plate, but that put his face in line with the exhaust.
“Ooo. Oh. Oooo,” Sirius muttered in his sleep as his foot started to twitch at the belly scratches.
“Morning, Hermione, my pretty steed.” Lucius greeted the horse jovially and tipped his hat to her. He walked closer and gently patted her neck in greeting. Hermione was looking at Lucius in horror and shock, but Lucius didn’t notice. He was too caught up in his own little world. A world full of millions of dollar signs. His face contorted in a mixture of glee and conniving he leaned in closer to the light brown horse, again not noticing the look she was giving him.
“Over here, darling, Albus, here we are. And don’t worry. Everything’s going to be alright.”
“I don’t dig him. Strike one.” Pansy said with a sinister smirk.
The noise woke up Ron, who walked out of his hole and behind a banister to listen. “Draco? Kittens? Gone? Why, that’s terrible!” Ron exclaimed worriedly as he put his hands to his head in shock. “But where? Why? Good heavens. Anything could happen to them on a night like this. Get washed down a storm drain, struck by lightning…” Ron fretted aloud before running back to his house as he said “Oh, they’ll need help. I’ve just got to find them.”
“Why little man, let me elucidate here.” Pansy danced while answering and then broke into song.
“It’s locked.” James commented.
A loud thunderclap rang out before Draco could chastise his son.
“Wait a minute. I’m the leader. I’m the one that says when we go,” Sirius said, sitting up importantly. “Here we go,” he conceded after a few seconds, too excited to wait any longer. “Charge!” Sirius called as he jumped over Remus, who covered his eyes in case the lanky dog missed. But Sirius cleared his partner easily and kept running towards the motorcycle.
Pans Cat sighed as the jazz faded away, and the entire gang of alley cats became enchanted by Draco’s music. “Beautiful,” Harry agreed, right before Draco started to serenade him.
“Oh, I’ll be so glad when we get back home.” Draco said longingly, shaking his head.
“Of course my darling, that’s why I chose this book.” Draco’s answer was followed by a sweet kiss before he took a sip of tea and cleared his throat.
“Hooray! We did it!” Scorpius cried triumphantly as he ran to their food.
The kittens darted into the truck immediately, Draco following slowly, his face full of concern.
“Ahhh still the softest hands in all of Paris.” Luna conceded warmly.
I’ll take a few ad-libs and pretty soon…” Pansy added softly before going back to her instrument.
“Draco! Kittens! Hallelujah. They’re back!” Ron exclaimed as he did a happy dance, threw his hat in the air to catch it, and slid down the curtain to run to greet his friends. He slowed as he passed the den however…as that was where Lucius, the evil husbutler was currently sitting. “Oh, no! Lucius! I’ve got to do something, quick.” Ron thought aloud. He ran into the room, unseen by the far too happy Lucius, thinking about ways to slow the man down.
“What?” Remus asked, confused.
It’s the way of life, make no mistake for me.”
“Who wants to deal with dogs and birds or stuff like that…” Blaise sang in a deep voice.
“Darling,” Draco said with a small chuckle as James made it to his side. “That’s only a little frog, my love.”
“Careful Albus.” Narcissa said with a chuckle. “You are making it very difficult for Lucius.”
“Mr. Potter,” George said in a tone that was far too happy for Harry’s liking, “I think you should be the rear end.” George instructed while he gently pushed Harry into the spot behind little Scorpius.
“Hey. Meow! What a classy neighborhood. Dig these fancy wigwams.” Harry remarked as he looked around.
The rest of Pansy’s band joined in eagerly, and they all danced on top of the piano as they played. They sang the chorus as they played, well, yelled it, mostly, due to how loud their music was. “Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat.” They stomped while they played and after the chorus, the floor beneath them gave way. They sang the chorus and stomped and played their way through every floor of the abandoned house they were in. Once they reached the ground floor, the band played their way out of the door and onto the street, though their instruments were a little worse for wear.
Draco gave Harry a grateful squeeze as he complied, and the two men created a huge splash when they landed into the small pool. Harry paddled their way to the top as Draco’s legs released Harry’s waist. Both men held hands, treading water in a circle together as if they were actually dancing. Slowly but surely Harry pushed them towards the edge of the pool. Harry let go of Draco’s hands to lift the blond up onto the ledge, before kissing Draco passionately, picking up where they had left off on the slide. Draco opened his mouth willingly, biting at Harry’s tongue eagerly as Harry moaned into their kiss. Draco swallowed Harry’s kiss eagerly before letting out a moan of his own. Harry broke their kiss when he felt Draco shimmying out of his speedo. Rainbow fabric landed in the water and Harry followed, stripping off his suit as well.
“Draco, wherever have you been?” Lucius asked as if he truly didn’t know.
“You will never learn to swim properly with that vine in your mouth.” Fred told him, not listening to the cat’s words at all.
“Children, where are you? Answer me. James, Albus, Scorpius, where are you?” Draco called out frantically, looking everywhere for his precious babies.
“Did I say that?” Harry asked.
“My home for all the alley cats of Paris.” Narcissa replied with a smile as if it was no big deal.
“Okay, okay baby. Hiya, roosters.”
“Of course. The more the merrier.” Luna agreed from her spot at the desk, adding in some extra notes to the will.
“Tell them you are sick. Better yet tell them I am sick. Lovesick is a thing, right?” Read the text from Draco.
“It definitely is, plus your cooking is far superior to breakfast anywhere else.” Draco agreed.
Draco pounded hard and fast into Harry, nipping at his neck in between kisses once their kiss had broken. Harry moaned in pleasure at Draco’s pace and the attention his husband was giving his neck. Harry fell into a delicious rhythm consistently meeting Draco’s thrusts and taking his cock as deep as he could. Harry cried out Draco’s name as he increased the speed even more, bringing Harry closer to orgasm. Draco yelled Harry’s name in return not long after, as he finished violently. Draco’s orgasm shook his whole body as his hot seed filled Harry. Harry came shortly after, painting Draco’s stomach as he did so. Draco pulled out not long after that, slowly catching his breath and smirking happily at Harry.
Worried that the noise had woken  someone up, Lucius walked backwards so that he could keep an eye on the door. He backed into a tree branch and threw his hands up, scared that it was someone trying to rob him. He still had hold of the bassinet in one hand though, and stood there for a moment, terrified. Until he looked behind him, that is, and realized it was merely a tree. Lucius chuckled at himself before continuing to walk to his car. Nerves were messing with his mind for sure. Lucius made it to his motorbike not long after and eased the bassinet into his sidecar. He lifted up the blanket to check that the cats were sleeping and was happy to see that they were. However, little Albus, the ginger kitten, briefly opened his eyes a smidge. As Lucius set the blanket back down, Albus’s eyes closed all the way once more. Lucius got on his motorbike and kicked it into gear.
“Hermione, tonight Operation Catnapper will be completed. Wish me luck. Fisherman’s luck,” Lucius said to the annoyed horse as he hopped onto his bike. Ron was sitting inside the busted tail light, and pulled down some riding goggles before waving good-bye to his friend. The motorbike started up, causing where he was sitting to become red. He looked around for a second before saying, “Good-bye Hermione.”
That burst of speed got the dogs right next to the motorcycle and Remus stretched out his paws to pull the man closer. But the sidecar leaned to the opposite side and suddenly Remus’s little basset hound body was being stretched rather far. Lucius had extricated himself from the umbrella and now gave the dog an evil glare. His foot lifted up and the man’s heel came down hard on one of Remus’s paws. He removed both paws immediately and cradled his sore one to his chest. He had been having fun until now, but now he was angry. Remus shook both of his paws out before turning his attention back to the man on the motorcycle, a snarl firmly in place.
Scorpius heard the grown ups chatting and sat up to listen closer. The longer they talked, the closer the white kitten moved to the window.
“Potter?” Pansy asked immediately, no longer thinking about eating the mouse. Her confusion was echoed by the rest of the gang as they echoed the name. “Hold it, cats. This little guy’s on the level.” Pansy exclaimed.
“Ooooh. Right there, that’s good. Ooooh,” Sirius replied happily.
Harry James Potter,
“Yeah. Well, I guess you know best. But I’m gonna miss you, baby. And those kids. Gee, I’m gonna miss them too,” Harry conceded, snuggling closer to Draco while he could.
Draco whined slightly and grabbed playfully at Harry’s ass, squeezing it briefly before giving Harry a gentle push ahead and both men walked out of their room and towards the ocean. Once they hit the beach, Harry started to run, racing Draco to the beautiful turquoise water.
Harry stayed out for a while longer, trying to get a handle on his feelings about what the next day would bring. He went to bed eventually, keeping guard at the end of the bed all night. They slept late the next morning so that everyone would be well rested for the last leg of their trip back home.
Harry’s hair was rather clear of sand as he started to swim around with Draco and the sharks once more. They didn’t swim for very long this time though, as they were both rather tired from their earlier swimming and love making session. Harry and Draco exited the cavern, rinsed off their speedos in the water before getting dressed once again, and drying off before they headed back to the house. Harry had scheduled a magical food delivery from one of their favorite restaurants which was thankfully waiting for them on the kitchen counter. Harry started to plate their food while Draco ran to change and finish drying off, he returned shortly, wearing a deliciously tight tank top of Harry’s and a tight, brightly colored thong. Harry gulped at the sight before him and ran to change his clothes as Draco took over the unboxing of food. Harry playfully squeezed Draco’s ass as he walked past, on his way to their room, excited to be in comfortable clothes soon.
“How can we ever thank you?” Draco asked earnestly.
“I don’t worry where to go,
“How was that Papa?”
James took a few more sips and started to yawn excessively. Ron was trying to get to his hole when he started to wobble rather than walk.
“I did not agree to those terms Potter… so the only way I am getting naked is if you get naked first.”
“Look, Papa, look!” Albus added.
“Oh, I’m delighted to meet you, Mademoiselle Pans Cat.”
Harry chuckled before replying, “Keep your whiskers up, tiger. It’s just beyond that next chimney pot. Well, there it is. My own penthouse pad. It’s not exactly the Ritz, but it’s peaceful and quiet.” Harry said as the kittens and Draco looked across the roof to his house.
The truck hit a bump and poor little Scorpius lost his balance and fell out. “Papa!” He screamed.
Remus uncovered his eyes after a few seconds, and seeing that Sirius was now firmly back on the ground, he jumped up happily and started to run after the motorcycle himself. Now that he saw the motorbike, his annoyance had been replaced by excitement. This would be fun! Remus kept pace with Sirius easily and both dogs barked as loudly and ferociously as they could. No one should be out near their farm this time of night and it was their job to ensure that everyone who drove by knew that. Lucius hadn’t registered the sound of the dogs until he saw them standing in front of a small bridge he had been planning to drive over. His hair flew out of his ponytail as he tried to brake, but to no avail. Instead, face showing his terror once more, Lucius swerved to avoid the dogs.
Slowly, he opened the door, wincing slightly as the handle creaked. Narcissa didn’t stir at the sound though, she too was out like a light, even without sleep medication. Lucius smiled evilly as he tiptoed across her room to the giant canopy bed the cats all shared. He reached behind to pull out the little travel bassinet, and slowly tucked  the cats in one by one. He started with Draco, who he wasn’t sure would sleep as long as the smaller kittens, then he tucked in the little ones snuggly on either side of their dad. Had he truly cared for them, Lucius would have stopped to admire the cuteness. However, all he could see was an obstacle between himself and the future he felt he deserved, so they had to go. Once all of the kitties were safely inside, Lucius pulled back the curtains and tiptoed out of the room. He managed to shut the door silently this time, much to his relief. Lucius crept slowly down the stairs to the front door, glad his footsteps were silent.
Harry rolled his eyes before stretching out his legs and arms, not wanting to injure himself while playing a silly game. Though he had to admit getting tangled up with Draco sounded like a fun and potentially sexy time. Draco finished setting up the game and decided to stretch a little as well, sitting right next to Harry and poking his toes with his own. Harry chuckled at Draco’s adorableness before standing up and grabbing his wand; he went and stood on the twister mat. Clearly, the best way to play this game would be to stay on the mat and use magic to move the spinner. Draco joined Harry on the mat shortly after, pulling Harry into his arms for a bear hug. Harry returned the hug happily and relaxed into Draco’s arms.
“Hurry up, Papa, hurry!” Called Scorpius who was already hidden. Less than a minute later, Draco heard the sound of an engine running. He had an inkling he might know what Potter had meant by flying carpet now, but he wasn’t sure.
Remus chuckled as he followed Sirius around, “This time I get the tender part.”
Albus laughed as he said, “You’re not a gentleman.”
Scorpius walked past James with his head and tail held high once more, as if none of their fighting had happened. James and Scorpius both murmured “yes Papa” and headed to the piano.
