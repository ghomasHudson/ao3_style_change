"Idiotic clingy sister..." She mumbled. Draco looked at her. "I thought you said no insulting your sister!" Lost glared at him. "Only I can do that. She's insane, bonkers, cuckoo, whatever you want to call it. Anyways, she's really fucked in the head, so only I can make fun of her since she's my sister." Draco rolled his eyes and continued eating his toast.
Dumbledore separated them. "That's enough!" He roared. Roxy looked at him calmly and let go of Ginny, Ginny backing away from the demon she attacked. Dumbledore glared at Ginny. "How dare you try to attack someone who is here to protect your life, and who is also one of our guests. 20 points from Gryffindor." All of Gryffindor table groaned and gave Ginny nasty looks. Roxy did nothing but twitch again and giggle. Dumbledore looked at Roxy. "Please, try not to hurt the students." Roxy nodded.
A few Ravenclaw's at the Ravenclaw table clapped, and as she got closer to the table more and more of them started to clap as she sat down beside Luna Lovegood. Sapphire gave her a warm smile as Luna returned it, the both of them shaking hands. The students in Ravenclaw were happy to have Sapphire in their house, they knew they would all get along with her quite well indeed.
After breakfast, Blaise grabbed Neville and lead him to the nearest boys lavatory. When Blaise grabbed him, Neville squeaked, afraid of what the Slytherin boy was going to do to him. When they got to the bathroom, Blaise pushed him into a corner. Not roughly, but Neville squeaked again, terrified. Anxiety filled him as Blaise got closer to him, and he blushed.
When they got there, Lost's eyes widened and she put on her glasses. She immediately walked past them and to the nearest shelf and took out the first book she saw. "I love reading. Even if they are to help me learn; I grew up with reading, my maid Nicole would read to me every day while she took care of me due to my mother being too busy to do so herself." Lost sat down at a table and opened the book, the book was on potions. Lost smiled for the first time in awhile. "I love potions, it's very interesting."
He went to the nearest bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. He ran a hand through his hair and stood up straight. Draco Malfoy will not be upset over something so stupid. Not now, not today. He needs to make a good first impression with this scary demon he was sitting beside just a few minutes ago. But even though she was a demon, he found himself feeling a bit more comfortable around her now that he knew a bit about her. She loves books, and potions. He'll get to know her better when they all go to Hogsmeade together.
She walked up to the stool and sat down, the sorting hat smiled again as it was placed on her head. Again, it took some time to think of which house she should be placed in. After a moment, it called out "Slytherin!"
Roxy purred as Harry ate his breakfast, shifting every now and then to try and get her to let go, but her grip would tighten on him faintly every time. He eventually gave up and sighed, taking a sip of his pumpkin juice. She twitched. It was then that Roxy took Harry's hand and started examining it. She nuzzled her face into his neck and purred more, and that was what made Ginny snap.
Luna looked at Draco, Pansy and Blaise and waved. They awkwardly waved back, not really caring for Luna that much. But now that she has a demon by her side, they should be careful around Luna and act kindly towards her.
While Lost and Sapphire started talking, Luna looked at Ally and held out her hand. "It's nice to meet you. What's your name?" Ally shook her hand, and a wave of happiness and relaxation went through Luna the second their hands touched. "I'm Ally. It's a pleasure to meet you." Luna smiled.
how that awful demon- "I can hear your thoughts. Don't call my sister awful if you know what's good for you." What Lost said sent shivers down Draco's spine. He muttered out "sorry" before looking down at the ground. Lost sighed quietly. "It's fine. But if it happens again, we'll have some problems. Anyways, I know why you hate her." Draco whipped his head around and looked at her with shock written all over his pale face. "Don't worry, I won't tell anyone." Draco visibly relaxed.
Hufflepuff house clapped and cheered just like Ravenclaw did as Bernadette walked to her table, sitting down beside some nice Hufflepuffs, already making friends with her house mates.
" He screamed, quickly storming over to the cauldron, the smoke hiding Dawn's face. When he realized who he was yelling at due to the smoke fading away, a wave of fear overcame him as Dawn looked at him with bright glowing white eyes.
way she could memorize those that quickly. Lost didn't even look at Draco, she just flipped through the pages without a care in the world. While she flipped through the pages of the old book, she was smiling warmly.
"I have a very important message for you all." Harry just realized that the sorting hat and stool were up at the front. Were there new students joining them? "Due to the several attacks on Hogwarts already, your fellow staff and myself have decided to bring in some well trained fighters to protect us all so that we may continue to learn and teach magic. They will live among you as if they were normal students, they will take classes, gain and lose house points for you. I have summoned six demons and one fallen angel to serve us."
Lost took her glasses off and pinched the bridge of her nose. She stood up and looked at the student with a bored expression. "Yes, we all represent the seven deadly sins. I am the deadly sin of wrath, the sin's leader, and Lucifer's best."
Just then, the next demon skipped into the hall when Dumbledore called for "Roxy". Creepy giggling filled the room as everyone's fear grew by the hundreds, the next demon was also a girl, brown hair done up in pigtails with bright pink eyes. She was wearing a white button up shirt, vest and black tie. A tiny little top hat was slanted on her head as she twitched. Her mini skirt almost showed her rear end, and some girls glared at her while others girls and some boys blushed. She twitched again as she made her way up to the stool, pulled her skirt under her as she sat down. The sorting hat was so horrified of this one that it took a few moments for it to utter "Gryffindor". It didn't even think on whether or not the house was right for her, it just said the first house that came to mind. The hat was removed and Roxy skipped over to the Gryffindor table. Harry's eyes widened as Roxy sat next to him, gave him a creepy smile and twitched, causing her smile to fade. After a moment of staring at the table, she smiled widely at him and held out her hand for him to shake.
Dusk was Dawn's twin sister. Dusk had white hair that went down to the floor, her eyes pitch black. The room went quiet again as she made her way to the front, all eyes on her. Everyone was uncomfortable.
Lost wrote like there was no tomorrow. She wrote quickly, occasionally dipping her quill in her small bottle of ink when she ran out. She finished the work before class had ended, got up and handed it in. The professor was a bit impressed, but not surprised considering that Lost is a demon, and no normal student.
In the Slytherin common room, the new "students" were sitting by the fireplace along with Pansy, Blaise and Draco. Dusk was watching the fire while Lost was lost in thought. Ally was still chatting with Pansy, and Blaise and Draco were still a bit uncomfortable. To help the situation, Pansy cleared her throat and came up with a suggestion. "How about when we have a break from classes, we go to Hogsmeade? We can get to know each other better since we'll be stuck with you for awhile..." Lost and Dusk slowly nodded. Lost spoke, her hoarse german voice sending chills down every witch and wizard in the rooms' spines.
Dusk nudged Blaise with her elbow while still looking at the boy. Blaise looked at her while taking a drink of his pumpkin juice with a curious look. Dusk pointed to the Gryffindor boy staring at him and asked, "Who is that?" Blaise and the boy locked eyes with each other. The boy quickly looked away, blushing heavily. Blaise gave him a confused and annoyed look.
The last demon to join Hogwarts was Bernadette. Her hair was the colour of lavender, her body chubby. She had a kind, innocent smile on her face as she walked up to the stool. The hat was placed on her head, and the sorting hat relaxed and smiled as it called out, "Hufflepuff!"
Blaise looked at them confused, but at the same time, he had a guess as to what they were talking about. He'd have to find out later.
The wind was howling wickedly as rain hit the windows of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. School had started a month ago, and Harry was nervous due to the whole Voldemort coming back last year thing. Anyways, it was time for all the students to head down to the great hall for dinner, all of them sitting down at their house tables. Harry, Ron and Hermione talked while they waited for the food to appear, but it never showed up. Instead, Dumbledore asked for silence.
Lost was excited for her first lesson in Hogwarts, and they all could tell. Blaise and Draco told Pansy about her love for books, so it made them feel well that Lost, one of the scariest demons staying with them, was going to be in a good mood.
"That's fine with me." She didn't say anything bad, just the sound and tone of her voice that was spine chilling. Everyone nodded in agreement. Pansy smiled. "Then it's settled."
Of course, the demons all did extremely well with making the class, especially Lost...All except one.
Draco got bored after a few minutes. He sighed, got up and muttered "I'm going to the restroom." He then left the library, and as he did, Harry fucking Potter and Roxy walked in to the library. Roxy was skipping ahead of Harry and...Holding. His. Hand.
She sat down on the stool as the hat was placed on her head. The hat was uncomfortable, so it quickly shouted "Slytherin!" A few Slytherin's clapped as Dusk got up and walked over to her new house without a care in the world. She sat down beside the one and only Draco Malfoy. She looked around at her fellow house mates, her face emotionless.
Draco couldn't help but fall for those green eyes and messy black hair. The way he walked and talked, that stupid smile of his. And here he is holding hand with some random bitch who's skirt is too short.
The answering grin told him that she had understood and that she would use that information however she pleased, which was a frightening prospect.
"Just break him out, you asshole," muttered Harry at the reflection. But that wasn't a good idea either. As long as his father stayed away from them, Draco and his mother were safe. Safer. Even if it hurt them.
As Goyle told Crabbe what he thought about the plans and Ron kept spluttering in surprise, from the corner of his eyes Harry spotted Theodore Nott giving their little group a dark look that went unnoticed by them, then walking away with a neutral-as-usual Zabini. Blaise spotted Harry and raised his eyebrows slightly, something that could be either interpreted as a greeting or a 'What is this guy's problem?'
“But we have to make sure he is there first!” cut in Hermione, her hands tightened in fists. “Harry, please, let’s check Sirius is not safe first. Maybe it’s all a-”
“Of course she did,” drawled Draco, sounding quite pleased. He then shrugged. “That’s fine, I’ll help you tomorrow."
Harry laughed. "Sorry, sorry." He squeezed the blond's hand and smiled at him, "I just like you a lot."
“Just peachy,” managed Harry, voice strained by the effort. There was nothing broken, but the hit would leave a bruise and the fall had made him lose his air. He took a second to take it in again, as he looked at Angelina for an explanation.
“Maybe,” conceded Harry, receiving a glare. "I can’t say much, but perhaps that information could help? Sorry about your friend.”
Harry shook his head, and then followed him outside the classroom and all the way to the Entrance Hall. It was getting filled by curious students that had walked out of the Great Hall, where dinner was still getting served, in order to see the cause of such ruckus. Snape quickly disappeared among the crowd, leaving Harry to do the same. He searched around for any familiar face while also keeping an eye on the centre, where Trelawney was sobbing into her hands, two large trunks resting by her feet.
“You know what, I take back what I said,” whispered Ron as they made way to the Gryffindor table. “We shouldn’t have let this happen, Hermione. My best friend is completely gone."
One second the Hufflepuffs had turned around the corner and the next Draco had been shoved into the nearest room. The blond let out a startled laugh. "What the hell-?" His words halted when he looked at Harry, his grey eyes widening slightly as if surprised.
“We are not sitting together today?” asked Hermione when Harry directed them to their usual table, at the other side of the room. It was a valid question, since Draco and two of his friends usually joined them, to Snape's growing confusion.
“You are here for an interview with Harry,” cut in Luna, voice as dreamy as usual but also regal and definitive. She took another sip of her drink and looked at Draco. “If you must go, I’ll see you later, Draco.”
“I wouldn’t piss him off, Smith, he was my best student,” said Harry coolly, approaching the pair now that the situation had turned bad. His appearance startled Smith, but Draco only spared him a glance. “You don’t want to get jinxed now, do you?”
“Harry,” called a cheerful voice, so unfitting to the mood that it startled him. Cedric was walking towards him, the drops of rain bouncing off his clothes, a sign of a recently casted
Draco closed his eyes with a sigh. “Against my better judgment, I am,” he mumbled, and Harry smiled at him.
Sirius frowned. “What the hell would I be keeping from you now? Lucius' sentence? Do you really want to hear about the number of years he was given? Because I’ll tell you this, it’s far longer than it will take him to die-”
Harry followed the pair out of the house, throwing one last look over his shoulder before the door closed. It was odd to leave a place he wouldn’t mind returning to, love to even, a place he would miss that wasn’t Hogwarts.
Ron looked at them in confusion. “What’s the big deal? Just sneak to Hogsmeade tomorrow and get him something. Like a vial of poison.”
Malfoy scowled at him but turned away. Harry watched as he seemed to fiddle with a piece of parchment, lips pursed in frustration. Harry remembered last week and let out a sigh.
“I’m fine.” He reached to grab a bagel from the small plate at the centre. “Ron and Hermione are coming earlier, is that okay?”
Harry gritted his teeth as he watched Blaise cough behind his hand, clearly trying to hide his laughter, and then, in the worst act of betrayal ever seen, Ginny pursed her lips and quipped, “Oh, and I hear he’s been named Captain of the Gryffindor Team as well.”
“But not even write to Harry on his birthday?” said Ron sceptically. "His mum must have him under surveillance or something...”
“I don’t feel like it,” said Draco, looking down at his book again. Moments passed in awkward silence, Harry drumming his fingers on the table, watching the crease between Draco’s eyebrows grow with each tap, until he cracked and looked up again. "I do
“He’s daydreaming again, Merlin.” A hand was waved in front of his face, rudely startling him from staring at a spot on the opposite wall. It was probably good that Harry had sat with his back to the Slytherin table because if he hadn’t he would have probably been staring at Draco.
Harry opened his mouth to say there was no need, but Sirius beat him to the punch. "I'm sure we can prepare some here, Molly," said the man with a sharp smile.
angry? Or just busy? I mean, he and his mom must be swarmed by Ministry officials right now, looking for dark artefacts and all that.”
“Alright, so use it-” The blond halted, eyebrows rising in realization before settling into a frown. “No,
Harry hadn’t meant to do it, really, it had been just a reaction. He had just relieved some of his worst memories; the graveyard, Sirius' almost deadly encounter with the Dementors, Arthur Weasley’s attack. It had been too much, but Snape wouldn’t budge.
," sighed Hermione, looking away briefly before smiling at him. "But no, even then I definitely wouldn't act like you. You are just a lost cause." Another set of giggles came from the centre of the room, and Harry and Hermione looked back at the group again. "How is he going to carry all that?" mused Hermione.
“No, of course not. That’s not what I meant.” Hermione shook her head. “Either way, they won’t say anything, and it helps that Skeeter is still keeping her promise.” She sighed. “But, it could be that, Harry, perhaps you could ask Mr Weasley when the officials will leave.”
Ron and Parkinson gagged, even worse when Draco smiled at Harry and pulled him into a chaste kiss. A chess piece hit Harry on his head, and Draco broke away to frown at Ron and remind him it was his turn to move.
Forced to run with him, Harry felt as if wanting to laugh at how bizarre the situation was. And figuring he didn't have anything to lose, he did, almost stumbling when the force of it made him double over.
The bird merely blinked at him and turned around, the exact same thing she had done when Harry had reached for a piece of parchment to write back against Draco’s request. She had made her position clear, and Harry vaguely remembered a discussion he had with Draco about owls and other magical animal companions.
The first thing Harry noticed was the size, because he could only compare it to his stag, and this one was definitely smaller. It didn’t throttle either, its pace slow in a graceful strut, a long feathery tail behind it, opening into a wide fan as it stopped.
It was just as he stood next to Remus, while the man spoke with the shopkeeper, that Harry noticed an unfriendly face. Theodore Nott was standing next to a shelf, one arm hovering in mid-air from when it had stopped moving when he saw Harry.
They sounded like fireworks and seemed to become louder by the second. He froze at the middle of the hall when he realised that the noises were coming from around the corner at the end of it and seemed to be going straight towards him. And so were other sounds; the fast steps of someone running, almost drowned by the explosions, so loud now that Harry swore they sounded like a growl, and a very distinctive scream of terror.
As soon as the steps seemed to pass them, Harry peeked around the bush. It was Snape, of course, but he was accompanied by Igor Karkaroff, and they seemed to be in the middle of an argument.
“Maybe I should,” said Harry, and Hermione turned to look at him in confusion. “He doesn’t want to see me, Hermione,” he explained, trying to ignore how painful the words were.
Sirius laughed. “Well, well," he shoved Harry playfully, “Look at you, all smitten with a boy. James would have-" He paused, voice low when he spoke again. “He would have teased you a lot, Lily too."
Harry sighed. Narcissa would surely ask questions if she found a letter, and Draco most likely didn't want to tell her what he had done...
Harry nodded, wishing he had a surface to drum his fingers on. He didn’t notice Draco had moved until there was a round package being pressed into his hands.
It was what Harry had been waiting for, in some way, because the answer was out before he could think of it. “I can get them back.”
Apparently, Wizards didn’t have zoos. Harry scrunched his nose, once again looking for the best way to face the hard task that was explaining a muggle concept to a pureblood. “It’s a place where muggles keep animals”
“So,” said a voice to his right, not long after he had started on a slice of treacle tart, which he hadn’t advanced on much. He looked up to see Ron, Hermione and Ginny seating near him. It was Ginny the one that had spoken as she took the seat next to him. “You have heard the
“Because you wanted me to,” protests Harry. Because that was the reason, the wolf had growled at him not to go.
"If you sign this," Hermione's expression and voice were all business, "You are promising not to betray us."
“It’s not a matter of being good or bad company, I know it must be hard for you,” he said honestly, his words making Draco stop and look at him. Harry rubbed his neck. “I just want to be there for you. I promised I would. Even if it’s just sitting in silence, as long as it’s with you, I want it. ”
Sirius gave him a thin smile. “Well, she’s a smart girl. Pureblood mothers…” He shook his head with a  tired sigh. “They are something else, Harry. And even if Narcissa isn’t as bad as mine was, I can imagine what my cousin is going through. I mean, if I had told my mother…” He trailed off and scratched his scruffy jaw thoughtfully, before nodding. “Yes, it has to be that. He might have asked you to not write because she’s keeping him close now that Lucius is not around.”
Perhaps the only Slytherin discontent with the article was Theodore Nott. Harry had not taken his father’s name out of his testimony, and even if it had been done due to them not being friends, he wouldn’t deny feeling satisfied by his irritation. Ron had suggested he had changed from one Slytherin rival to another and Harry had shoved him off the sofa. The only thing about Nott he cared about was that he had somehow made Draco feel troubled, which was more than enough to dislike him, he was not a rival and definitely not whatever Draco had been.
He took a deep steadying breath, put on his pyjamas, got under the covers and resisted the impulse to take the pin out of his trunk and cradle it to his chest. Instead, he glared furiously at the ceiling of his bed as if it could provide him with the answers he desperately needed.
“He said he would explain,” said Hermione, giving Harry back his two letters. “If it’s not now, then you two will talk when term begins. So let’s just wait, Harry.”
told himself Harry, glancing at the clock as the last group departed. Just as he was about to check the map, the doors opened, effectively startling him into hiding the box of toffees behind him.
“Well, that was...” started Hermione once Umbridge stopped and a few hesitant claps were given before Dumbledore went back to his speech.
Draco didn't take away his eyes from the ceiling, or where the ceiling should have been but now was a piece of night sky. From what Harry had seen during class, it changed during the day just like the real one. Firenze had made it change for them to see the stars, but now there was no need to change anything and the white dots winked at them.
“I think I know a lost cause when I see one, Horace, and my friend Harry Potter,” Dumbledore placed a hand on his shoulder, “has to be somewhere else soon. He just so graciously accepted to accompany me, but I can see you have made up your mind and I have delayed him enough.” The Headmaster gave Harry a look. “Apologies, Harry.”
“So stubborn,” mused Draco, reaching to cup his face with a hand. He sighed. “Stubborn git. I can only ask you to be cautious. You know the toad is going to be sniffing over your shoulder."
“That man... He taught Molly and me.” Mr Weasley huffed in annoyance. “Didn’t give the time of day to those that didn’t have an important name or such. But he was not a bad teacher by any means, so don’t worry, Hermione, you will be in good hands.”
“Goodnight, Harry.” Draco watched as Harry disappeared once again. “And you are still not gone, I know that. I can hear you.”
“I was raised as a muggle. I didn’t even know I was a wizard until I received my letter.” Harry smiled, opening his mouth to tell him about the raining letters and Hagrid's apparition. But that would involve telling him about the Dursleys taking away the letters too.
That night, Harry first dreamed of an empty ballroom, with white walls and floors and soft music, white smiles and graceful steps.
It wasn’t hard to catch the moment Blaise lost interest either, as he abandoned his smile to give him a bored look. “For Merlin’s sake, you don’t know anything,” he said in disapproval before walking away.
Their biggest advantage. Harry could only think of one, and along what the Headmaster had said about the Minister... “Was he there?” asked Harry, and Dumbledore looked at him over his glasses as if prompting him to continue. “Voldemort.”
Harry recognized the dark hair and haughty Black features instantly. Regulus resembled his brother a lot, but he seemed to be of a much more serious nature, judging by the way he looked straight at the camera without smiling from his spot in the middle of the front row.
What Krum wanted was to talk to Hermione in private, but before they walked away he turned to Harry. Placing a hand on his shoulder, Krum frowned at him. “Hermione told me,” he said, and then patted him, “Good. Very good."
“Git,” muttered Harry, pulling him closer to press a kiss on his lips, effectively making the blond stop laughing. He smiled at him, “I missed you a lot, thanks for writing to me."
Harry turns then, and Malfoy is already dressed but Harry’s jacket is still in his hands. There’s a frown on his face as he looks at him. “Will you tell?” asks Malfoy, and now he sounds resigned in an entirely not-Malfoy way.
"Draco," he said, gently lowering his arm. The blond turned his wide eyes towards him. "It's fine, fireworks can't open doors-" Harry barely managed to finish the sentence before another fit of laughter started.
“No, Harry, I don’t think there is.” Dumbledore’s expression was hard to read as he looked forward. Harry could hear him counting under his breath as they crossed the front door. “One, two,…”
And that’s where he is. Wand tightly on his hands as he goes through every possible spell that could work in this situation. Teeth gritted to not let any sound get out as he hears the creaks of the planks as the wolf approaches. Every expletive he knows being screamed on his head at him, for being an idiot, in the distinctive voice of Hermione.
“It’s… an invitation from Slughorn. He wants us to go to his compartment.” Harry passed Neville his parchment and pondered about ripping his own to pieces. He had no intention to go
The door opened with a creak and Harry started to slip away, when a voice made him halt because it was dangerously neutral. “You will be his ruin,” hissed Snape, so definitive and grim it sounded like what Trelawney should sound like when she made a deadly prediction.
There was no softness in the way he opened his mouth against Draco's, almost hungrily. Thin fingers threaded through his hair, tugging him forwards roughly to deepen the kiss, head tilting to give him more access. One of Harry's hands found a bony hip, the other arm bent against the wall as if trying to phase through, wanting to be even closer. There was a sharp scrape of teeth against his lips, followed by a lick, fast to leave just as Harry was to follow, and then he was licking into Draco's mouth and it was weird and wet and
Neville took pity on him and offered to help since he only needed a pocket to carry Trevor. Together, they carried everything out the train and towards the designated area. After that, carrying the cages became quite easier, especially since both owls were very serene. As they walked towards the carriages, Harry noticed the absence of a certain Groundskeeper.
They had taken the truth of what happened with Marietta quite similarly to Harry; getting angry at the girl and then, even if they didn’t say it out loud, relieved by Draco not having turned on them. It made Harry happy, knowing that they were getting along better and that the circumstances hadn’t ruined that.
Hermione had looked at him with sadness in her eyes, which increased with everything he had said. Her eyes had flashed calm fury when he mentioned Skeeter, and she had grabbed his hands and told him, "We can fix this."
"You would love that, wouldn't you?" Draco placed on hand on his hip and raised the other to his chin. “It’s easier to cast it once you have done it before, right?"
“A centaur?” Harry looked over his shoulder to find Draco with an expression not that distant from Umbridge’s. His pale nose was slightly scrunched, silver eyes carefully studying Firenze. “A centaur is going to be teaching Divination?”
“The ice cream shop in Diagon Alley?” Harry hadn't been expecting that answer, but Draco had answered automatically, as if he had known the question beforehand.
It was perhaps silly of him, but Harry kept every single one he received, be it book-lists, meeting arrangements with Sirius or greetings from his friends. The first of them was, of course, his admittance to Hogwarts, which had changed his life.
“You know what?” said Dean as they had lunch. “Maybe I don’t have to keep studying, I could just leave it like your brothers, Ron.”
"Alright," said Harry. He let out another sigh and pulled Draco into a hug, hiding his face on the crook of his neck and just breathing in. Soon Draco's fingers were gently threading through his hair, comforting like his words, and Harry felt himself feeling better. "Thank you."
As you might have noticed, yes, there are four chapters left and I'm fully panicking! (No, I'm fine (read; I'm not))
The wolf backs away and Harry stays still, waiting until it returns, letting Harry's palm rest between its eyes. It's soft, and warm, and Harry feels amazed as the wolf closes its eyes and leans into the touch.
“I don’t really,” said Harry distractedly. “This is actually the first birthday party I have-” It was the wrong thing to say. Harry watched as his friends exchanged a look, the same expression on their faces;
“Oh, thanks,” said Harry, approaching the front of the carriage. As he extended his arm towards the girl, it bumped into something and Harry almost dropped the eagle owl’s cage in surprise. He managed to hold onto it, but the bird was already awake and glaring at him. “Sorry,” he grimaced, passing Luna the cage as he looked for whatever he had bumped into.
The water was cold, and Harry was sure that if it weren’t for the resistance the Gillyweed gave him, it would be freezing. He wasn’t sure of how much time had passed since he got in, everything looking the same underwater, but he had finally reached what seemed to be ruins.
“What are you doing?” asked Harry, trying to decipher the contents of one of them. He quickly noticed they were the same Draco had been staring at until just a few moments ago. Harry had thought that he would take a break from studying after the match, but he had been wrong.
Unfortunately, Harry didn’t have time to enjoy it because at that same moment the door opened quite loudly, making him snap his gaze towards it. A younger student stood there, one hand on the knob as her face began to turn red, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of the water.
“We are more likely to have trouble with the Hufflepuff team,” said Harry, remembering what an idiot Zacharias Smith was. “But, the Slytherins will be our bigger threat, as usual. Not only their Seeker is good, but the Beaters hit hard and we just lost ours.”
Silver eyes met green. “Perhaps you should,” said Draco. “And perhaps I should too. You might be criticized, but I-” he swallowed, “I would be publicly giving my back to my parents. What will they say about a Death Eater’s son that dates one of the people that locked his father up?”
"Draco's coming to watch our practice later," commented Harry as he served himself some toast from the uncrowded Gryffindor table. Breakfast was served early at 8 every day, but during the weekends it remained until 10, in case students chose to sleep in a bit more. And as it turned out, a lot of them did. “I mean, he always did, along with the Slytherins, so it’s not really different from usual."
"It's late, we should get back. Besides, I have homework to do for Muggle Studies," Scorpius said, and it was quite obvious to him that he needed time to process this now. He just wanted to get out of this room and away from this Pensieve, away from his father's memories.
"Let's look at another memory," was all Albus had to say about it. He couldn't wait to learn more about his father and his relationship with Draco Malfoy. This thing was getting more and more twisted and by now he wondered if his father was really happy with his mother. He had never seen even a hint of doubt in his eyes when Harry Potter looked at his wife. Albus had always been under the impression that his parents had a picture-perfect marriage. But slowly, his entire worldview began to falter.
Dumbledore smiled as he called for "Ally". This one was not a demon, but instead a fallen angel. Everyone smiled and blushed heavily as she walked in. She was wearing a short tight dress, her hair flowing as she walked gracefully. Boys and girls were in awe with her appearance, her double D's the reason Ron was drooling. Hermione punched him in the arm for staring.
of thunder. Lost got up off the stool and walked towards the Slytherin table. Harry almost felt bad for the Slytherin's, but he knew that there would be at least one of those things in his house too. Draco Malfoy and his group of friends tensed up as Lost's footsteps got closer to them, and she sat down beside Blaise Zabini. She looked down at the table in disgust, and when Blaise moved even a centimeter, her head would shoot up to look at him with a nasty look and a low growl. Blaise was
Draco, Pansy and Blaise sat down at the table, feeling awkward. Lost sat down beside them, still talking to Sapphire.
Most of the students in the class had fallen asleep, or were close to it. But not Lost, she was focused. She would raise her hand constantly, eager to learn as much as she can until the class ends. But this class took longer since it was a double period, but Lost didn't seem to mind at all. When they were given their work for the day, Lost immediately went to work on it. Dusk rolled her eyes and couldn't help but mutter "show-off" as she watched her do the work.
When Sapphire first met Lost, it was in a dream. Lucifer had noticed that the seven deadly sin of sloth was born a human, so he sent his best demon to go find them and turn them into a demon.
"How was your first class?" Sapphire asked the Slytherin's. Lost responded with, "It was great! We did some work, I loved it." The rest of the Slytherin's nodded slowly, secretly not agreeing, but didn't want to show it.
Roxy, her partner, hit her across the head with her recipe book. Dawn let out a quiet "ow" as she looked up at Snape. "Hmph...Sorry." she said, glaring at him for yelling. Snape went back to his desk, not wanting to piss the demon off. He sighed, telling her to clean it up- "No."
Draco huffed and walked away quickly. He didn't want to see him holding hands with some girl he just met.
Draco, Blaise and Pansy lead Ally, Dusk and Lost to their very first class together with the demons.
Dumbledore spoke up again. "This is Lost, the first demon. Lost, if you could please sit." Minerva McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor house got up from her spot at the teacher's table and went over to them, a bit nervous herself to have a demon in the room. But Dumbledore was calm, so she could trust this creature for the time being. She picked up the sorting hat and waited for Lost to sit down. She then placed the sorting hat on her head, the poor hat cringing as it was placed on top of this foul creature's head. As soon as the hat touched her hair, he yelled out loud and clear "Slytherin!"
When it was time for potions, Lost walked at a fast pace to the classroom. Everyone else tried to keep up with her except Dusk, who didn't really give two shits if she was late or not.
Roxy groaned and got up, whacking her across the head with her book again. She twitched and said, "I'll clean it up. Please excuse her, she's the deadly sin of pride." She then went to go get the items needed to clean up the mess, and as soon as she did everyone looked at Dawn and started whispering. Mostly the whispering was the same question, "deadly sin?" but then, someone spoke up, pure fright could be heard by the tone of their voice as they pointed at Dawn. "Th-There's a deadly sin in the room!" They were on the verge of tears, they were so frightened.
It was the Slytherin's turn to clap as she got up off the stool and went to the Slytherin table. She sat down beside Pansy Parkinson and spoke with a french accent. "Hello. I must say, you look quite beautiful. What is your name?" Pansy blushed at the compliment and told the fallen angel her name. Ally smiled and responded with "What a lovely name." She then looked at Lost. "Hello, Lost. Looks like we're in the same house." Lost glared at her, not saying a word.
As soon as he ended his last sentence, the whole room erupted into chaos. There were people panicking and shouting, scared that these mythical powerful beings would be living with them. After a few moments of the chaos and yelling, Dumbledore loudly called for silence. After a few seconds, the room was silent again. Dumbledore readjusted his glasses and spoke again.
"Of course, we all have money with us. Enough to buy a mansion probably; We have a lot." Lost and Ally nodded. All three of them pulled out small bags, however they were endless. Inside were tons upon tons of galleons, sickles and knuts, but mostly galleons. They opened up the bags and showed them what was inside, but Draco looked as if he had seen that amount of money before. He wasn't surprised at all. "Good." He mumbled.
Eventually the class ended, and it was time for their break. They packed up their stuff and left the classroom, deciding to hang out in the library. When they got there, Sapphire and Luna were sitting at a table reading books about different types of magical creatures.
They walked into the class and took their seats. Lost was so excited she couldn't even sit still. She would move her hips back and forth, rock back and forth, shake her leg, etc., anything to use up her extra energy. Draco couldn't help but smile faintly at the sight, if he were to be honest he thought it was quite funny watching the yellow eyed demon rock back and forth, too excited to even sit still for a few seconds.
In a flash Ginny got up and jumped straight for Roxy. But since Roxy is a demon after all, her reflexes are perfection. She grabbed Ginny and flipped her onto the ground, and she groaned in pain. Many students in the great hall gasped and so did a few of the teachers, so Dumbledore got up and ran over, McGonagall right behind him. Ginny got up and went to throw a punch at Roxy, but Roxy grabbed her fist and twitched. "That's not very nice, ginger~ I would treat me nicely if I were you." Roxy twitched again. "Then keep your filthy hands off my boyfriend!" Ginny screamed, throwing her other fist at Roxy's face. Roxy caught her other hand, and giggled.
"I...I was just lost in thought...It was nothing, I-I promise!" Neville stuttered. After a few moments, Blaise nodded. "Alright. But if this happens again, I won't let you go so easily." Neville nodded and Blaise moved away from him. Neville speed walked out of the bathroom, leaving Blaise alone with his thoughts.
"I-I..." Neville had trouble speaking. They were so close, they could feel each other's breath on their lips. Neville's face was completely red, even his ears were a bright red to match. Blaise noticed this and smirked.
Draco and Blaise looked at each other and shrugged. They sat down beside Lost and watched her flip through the pages. Lost was taking notes in her head on how to make the basic potions here at Hogwarts, such as what ingredients you need, how hot your cauldron needs to be, etc. for later. She memorized several recipes in minutes, absorbing as much information as she could.
Then one day, the yellow eyed demon Aynaet, visited her in her dreams and they made a deal. Aynaet will remove her insomnia and provide her with many centuries of well needed rest and protection, and in return Sapphire must kill her family and become a demon.
Everyone was coughing and covering their mouths with their sleeves as the room filled with oddly coloured smoke, Dawn coughing the hardest. When the smoke cleared, Snape started yelling, not caring who caused the explosion.
Lost went over to Sapphire, smiling. Sapphire introduced Lost to Luna, and they shook hands. Luna was smiling warmly at the black haired demon, happy to meet someone new. "This is Luna Lovegood, she's my new friend. She's really smart, I like her!" Sapphire exclaimed in her high pitch voice. Lost nodded. "That's good." She spoke, her voice rough and hoarse as usual. The reason why her voice is always hoarse is a story for another time.
Nobody clapped as the sorting hat was removed. The whole room was silent, the only noise that could be heard was the sound of the rain hitting the windows and the loud
The food the appeared, and everyone began eating. Ally was talking to Pansy about some makeup brand, Bernadette discussed activities to do in the Hufflepuff common room. Sapphire talked to Luna about the cutest creatures they've recently found, Dawn talked to the twins about what prank they should pull together. Eventually, Dusk started a conversation with Draco about their wealth. Roxy twitched and giggled as Harry told her about quidditch. Lost however ate in silence. Blaise would take glances at her as he ate, but Lost didn't look up from her plate. Eventually, she looked at him and asked him what his name was. Blaise looked at her and responded, "Blaise Zabini." Lost nodded. She asked him what there is to do around here that would be fun, and he told her about quidditch.
He told them all to take out their books and started reading out the instructions to them on how to make today's potion. Everyone got their ingredients and set up their stations, Lost being the most excited out of them all.
Lost finally looked up at Draco and fixed her glasses. "You're back. Draco, right?" Draco nodded. "Well, want to know a fun fact? The demon Roxy is actually my younger sister. She's younger than me by about 2,000 years. I'm 11,000, she's 9,000." Draco's eyes widened when she said that. He looked over to the table across the room to look at the pink eyed demon, who was cuddled up to Harry. Harry was doing his DADA homework, and Roxy watched him. Harry had a nervous smile on his face, and he didn't look very comfortable. Harry's girlfriend Ginny was with them, and she was glaring daggers at Roxy. But she didn't yell or start a fight, she just sat there because if she did something, she knew that Roxy would tear her to bloody pieces in the blink of an eye. So she just let it happen, but would talk to Harry about it later.
"You can buy a lot of things; You can buy food and drinks, and items. Buying sweets is really popular among us students though. Do you have money with you?"
"Roxy! Nice to meet you." She spoke with a sweet british accent. Harry gave her a weak smile as he hesitantly grabbed her hand and shook it. Her smile grew wider. "Harry Potter..." Harry said quietly. Roxy's smile somehow grew wider as she replied "I know, sweetie." Harry was about to ask why she called him that when the next demon was called into the room.
Snape was taking his sweet fucking time getting to class, so while everyone waited, they all started chatting. Blaise was next to Neville, but didn't talk to him. Same with Draco and Harry. Lost was in front of Draco and Harry, so she turned around to look at them. She smirked at Draco, and Draco mumbled "Piss off." Lost turned back around, but before doing so, she looked at Harry and telepathically sent him a message. She said, "Take good care of my sister, Roxy. If you do anything to her, I'll tear your eyes out of your skull."
“Oh, Harry…” Hermione’s voice was laced with pity. The dim orange light from the fire glinted off of her features harshly, making her look much more tired, much older.
“You will?” Hermione sounded oddly enthusiastic. Harry glanced over at her, eyebrows raised. “I just think it’s a good idea! You need to get your N.E.W.T.s over with, start on a career-”
With a flick of his wand, Harry’s old school trunk flung itself out from underneath the four-poster bed and landed itself on the mattress with a dull thunk. Another flick, and the lid flew open. Harry was sickeningly reminded of the only three wizards who ever helped him pack for Hogwarts. Fred and George Weasley, in his second year, when they recklessly ripped a set of bars from his window, and Nymphadora Tonks in his fifth year, when he was rescued by the Order. He was sickeningly reminded of the fact that two of those people were now dead. And it was his fault, and his alone.
Draco gave a sharp, cold laugh that rang through the empty halls of the manor. Who did Blaise think he was, sending him a letter nothing short of a petty threat? And for what? Surely Blaise didn’t truly believe that there was any point going back to that wreck of a school, surely there wasn’t so much they had missed that it required another entire year of torturous glares from his peers, echoing calls of “That’s Draco Malfoy, he’s a Death Eater, he’s a murderer…”
“No, I’m...sorry, I shouldn’t have said- just forget it,” He stood, shoving his wand in his pocket and striding towards the drawing room door. “‘Night, Hermione,” he said, closing the door behind him and beginning to ascend the stairs towards Sirius’ old bedroom. Harry already knew he wouldn’t get much sleep. With the guilt of snapping at Hermione on top of everything else, Harry prepared himself to stare at the ceiling of Sirius’ childhood prison until morning peeked in through the dusty drapes.
When Hermione wasn’t with Ron, she was perched at the bench by the ancient typewriter that had once belonged to Andromeda Tonks. She wanted to pursue a ministry job as soon as she could, and she figured the best way to get her name out there was to write a memoir. Harry had assured her that the wizarding world would undoubtedly know her name whether she wrote a memoir or not, but Hermione was insistent.
“You alright there, mate?” Harry didn’t look up from the trunk at Ron’s voice, now that he was uncomfortably aware of the wetness on his cheeks.
Harry took a deep breath. Somewhere, a part of him knew he was right. But the feeling of hatred for himself and what Harry Potter symbolized- hundreds of deaths- was too deep embedded in him to falter. “I thought I was going to repay everyone,” his voice broke, “I thought I was going to end all this debt by letting him kill me. It’s what I wanted. But I’m not dead, Ron, I got a second chance. Where are Tonks and Remus’ second chances then? And Fred’s? They had lives outside of all of this, purposes, stuff to live for, and what have I got? Articles in the Prophet? A bloody fan club?” Harry chanced a look over at Ron. His brows were furrowed, that dreaded look of pity and confusion playing across his blunt features.
Draco threw a glass across the room with a shout of anger, loud enough to rattle the walls. It shattered into thousands of miniscule crystals, and he didn’t bother to pick up the pieces.
Blue-tinged light streamed into the dark kitchen from the break in the curtains where one had been pushed aside slightly by a bustling house elf. Draco roughly cast the drapes back closed as he made his way into the room to fill the kettle with cold tap water and place it on the stove, despite the house elves’ muttering in displeasure. He had decided that if he was to stay here for a while, he’d best learn how to do something besides burn various objects around the manor that reminded him of his past. Tea seemed like a good place to start. His gray silk pajamas he had lived and slept in for many, many days and nights were beginning to lose their sheen. If only Potter could see him now, Draco thought with a slight simpering smile. He decided he’d rather not think about Potter, as the thought of the Boy Wonder ripped Draco’s mind in two with what he assured himself was nothing more than hatred and spite. However, somewhere deep, somewhere untouchable- he knew it was guilt.
“I’m...I’m, yeah, I’m alright.” Harry hastily bent to tie his shoe so that he could discreetly brush the tears away from his face. Ron crouched down next to him.
“You can talk to me, mate. Me and ‘Mione are really worried about you,” he said. Harry didn’t respond. “She reckons it’s just...the war, you know, but I think it’s something else, what’s wrong?” His voice was uncharacteristically gentle.
“Oh, just open it, Harry,” Hermione pleads, sliding the sealed letter down the table towards him. She seemed to be the only one who picked up on the tension between the two recently, and she glances nervously between them. Harry picks up the letter from the table, sitting down and grabbing a slice of toast. The letter, heavy and thick, has the Hogwarts seal on the back. His stomach flips over.
“I need to get out of this house.” Harry said shortly, cutting Hermione off. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her face fall.
He stirred sugar into his tea, jumping slightly at the sharp sound of an owl’s beak on the covered window. The kitchen was bathed in light once more as he tugged the drapes open, lifting the window pane to grasp from an unfamiliar horned owl’s beak a satiny red envelope. He recognized it as the Zabini house stationery. Distracted, he shooed the owl away and languidly pulled the curtains shut again. It did surprise him that the high-and-mighty, venerable, ‘I fought on the right side of the war’ Blaise Zabini would have any interest in a correspondence with Draco, but he removed the wax seal indifferently all the same. Draco found Blaise’s newfound sense of superiority very unpalatable. He’d always been neutral, impartial, towards all things political and war-related. His mother had been one of the very few who hadn’t fallen prey to Voldemort’s promises of power and glory the first time around, and as a result Blaise didn’t find much allure in the Death Eater lifestyle either. But being unfazed by the seduction of dark magic and uncorrupted by familial ties was much different from choosing the side of “good”. Which, as Draco recalled, was never his plan. Not until Ginny Weasley became a factor. He had no idea what Blaise saw in her. Quite honestly, it was traitorous.
hello! i've been writing this fic on and off for about a year now, and it's been just sitting in my google docs, a glorious 15k words and counting, just waiting to be published, and I'm finally doing it! It's still not done, but I'm hoping you enjoy this journey all the same. I'll be posting chapters way in advance so there never really should be much of a wait before the next one.
So Harry retreated from the doorway, pausing to look at himself in the dusty old mirror that leant up against the armoire. Maybe Hermione is right, he thought, looking at his thin arms and the way he could practically see the outline of his rib cage even through the loose-fitting gray t-shirt he hadn’t taken off in about a week. He figured that it didn’t matter, that he’d eat something tomorrow.
Draco tried so hard, with his eyes squeezed shut and his fingers plugging his ears, to stop hearing the screams of Voldemort’s captives that had carried up from the cellar what seemed like years ago. But Draco can’t stop hearing them, he can’t stop himself from thinking that they all sound like his mother’s voice. And sometimes, Draco cries. He cries and he screams and punches the taffeta-papered walls, destroys the perfect house his father kept, making it look as broken as it felt. Of course, Draco didn’t allow himself to believe that he was crying. No, Draco didn’t cry. He felt. And he was allowed to feel as much as he wanted to, for Merlin’s sake.
The absence of Fred hung over the house like a dark cloud, stifling every laugh that dared to echo through the halls. George tried his best to remind everyone that what Fred would have wanted most is for them to laugh and be happy, reflecting on his memory, but it was obvious he was aching even more than his mother was. Mrs. Weasley didn’t speak. It was lucky to get a pat on the shoulder and a half-hearted smile as Harry passed by on the way to the kitchen. Even Ron and Hermione were different. When Ron wasn’t locked up in his room, he was holed up on the drawing room sofa with Hermione, snogging and cuddling and doing hell knows what else. Harry was happy for them, sure, but he couldn’t deny that it did make him a bit lonely.
Too caught up in his thoughts, Harry didn’t hear the soft knock on his bedroom door, followed by Ron pushing it open hesitantly.
Draco Malfoy hadn’t stopped shaking all summer. He passed it off as nerves following the war, unwilling to recognize that it was much more than that. His father was shipped off to Azkaban in a matter of days following the Battle of Hogwarts, in a violent, bloody affair that ended with Lucius cuffed and sedated, and Narcissa on the floor, in tears. She took her own life days later. And, as it always had been, Draco was alone.
“I hate to sound like a prat,” Ron began, tactfully, “But that’s bloody mental. We didn’t just fight for you. Yeah, we didn’t want to see you dead-” Harry laughed. It was humorless, more of a sad scoff. “-but the war had always been about more than just you, Harry. You...Voldemort would’ve been a threat whether you lived or died. We fought for us. Our families. If Fred didn’t want to fight he wouldn’t have been there, and you know that. Same with Tonks, same with Lupin, same with Sirius. This isn’t about you, mate.”
“Hey. You’ve got some mail, we all have, actually.” Ron gives Harry a look he can’t exactly decipher. Hermione strides into the kitchen to set the kettle on the stove, and Ron’s eyes drift up to meet hers.
Harry hadn’t stopped shaking all summer. Though he knew there was nothing to be afraid of, and that everything was okay now, there was an emptiness he couldn’t get rid of. There was nothing to concentrate on but his thoughts and memories of the war. There were no Dursleys to go back to this year, and for once, Harry mourned the loss of his petulant relatives as a distraction. In the absence of Number 4, Privet Drive, Harry settled on moving into Sirius’ old bedroom at 12 Grimmauld Place. He tried his best to leave everything exactly as it was in the room: the walls had been untouched, but Sirius’ school books, which sat in a stack by the window, had been flipped through every once in a while in lieu of anything else to do. Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys had elected to settle in the rest of the bedrooms of the old Black family house as well, saying that they preferred to all be together, but Harry knew better. They were all worried about what would happen if he was left alone.
Harry looked up. He was met with nothing but worried glances from his friends and the realization that they both looked much too old, much too broken to be receiving a letter like this.
“I can’t get them out of my head,” Harry carded his hands through his unruly black hair as he sunk onto the floorboards.
“I don’t need pity, Hermione, and I don’t need more education either. I just need a distraction and neither you nor Ron are doing a good job of that so Hogwarts seems to be my only option.” Harry snapped, regretting the words as they left his mouth.
Frustrated, and tired of explaining himself, Harry stood and gave his trunk an angry rap with his wand. His robes, books and various other items flew haphazardly into it, crumpled and disorganized.
. It’s my fault, Ron, and nobody gets that, you’re all treating me like I’m delicate or like I’m a wounded fucking hero.” Harry's eyes burned. Ron sighed.
He got the letter mid-August, and he threw it away promptly. There was no way he would be going back to that wretched school, drenched in the remnants of war and death, of promises he was forced to keep and the evils he was forced to carry out. But endless days in the manor, with no company but the house elves, was proving to be very depressing indeed.
In truth, Harry didn’t quite think he deserved to be alive at all. He had given himself up, he should have died for the cause like his friends did. It wasn’t right. He finally fell asleep as the sun was just peeking over the trees outside, with the selfish wish to never wake up deeply lodged in his mind.
"Just because you can't control yourself anymore doesn't mean I'm going to rush here. So keep it down, Potter" - Uh oh! Albus had probably tugged a little too hard on the Malfoy's nerves, even the Gryffindor understood that now. Because the blond Ravenclaw only called his friend by his last name when he was slowly losing patience. And who would have thought it, that happened to him with Albus often and especially regularly. Of course, this could also be due to the fact that Scorpius was already by nature, not a particularly patient person.
All in all, Scorpius didn't fit the image he previously had of a Malfoy at all. He always thought they were conceited and rich purebloods who thought everyone else was dirt, and of course they all came to Slytherin. That's why it was such a shock to everyone when the talking hat suddenly spoke the word Ravenclaw. The Great Hall had never been dominated by so much silence as it was at that moment. It was clear to everyone that he was a Malfoy, the son of a Death Eater. And that someone like that came to Ravenclaw, of all places, was very- shocking. But the talking hat had reasoned that out as well.
"That's what I thought. He does look a lot like his father, but you can see that they couldn't be more different. He is like his father could never be."
"Very good idea! I'll be on my way to ask James out, then. I'm sure he's in the common room. Meet me in front of the principal's office in an hour? Then we can still decide whether to ask the other portraits first or Dumbledore right away" - Rose nodded confirming and Scorpius joined her opinion with a silence. And then Albus had already disappeared from the common room.
"You know I love you, don't you?" asked Harry after a while, looking into Draco's eyes. Into those stormy gray eyes that almost took his breath away and made the world stop for a brief moment. Just for a moment, there was no war, there was nothing around them.
They split up and searched the entire room for the Pensieve. Hours seemed to pass, during which they found nothing except some bits and pieces of junk and dusty furniture. Just when they had almost given up hope, Albus came across their sought-after object of desire.
But despite these words, Scorpius was not really welcome in Ravenclaw. No one planned to talk to him at first, because they all felt that he didn't belong with them. Of course, Scorpius didn't let on that this bothered him. He was an eleven-year-old boy trying to make friends at school. And then suddenly there had been Albus. He had just sat down next to him at dinner and brought Rose right along with him. They had become friends against all expectations. Albus had gotten to know a Malfoy from a different side and had to realize that he wasn't as mean and nasty as everyone thought.
// It was a light windy day and some gray clouds crept lazily across the dark sky. The wind blew scattered leaves from the trees and made the grass sway gently back and forth. The three students immediately recognized the place they were in. It was the whomping willow, stretching tall before them and hiding beneath its whips, two people.
"Gregor potion. We'll be working on that one in Potions soon," he replied, not looking up from the book. That didn't bother Albus at all, after all, he wasn't used to it from him any other way. Scorpius, as was well known, preferred to hide in Potions books. For reasons unknown to Albus, he had a strong fascination with this subject and read almost every book on it.
"I say we go back and see who we can ask about this tape. Someone is probably gonna know something about it" - With that Albus took a step back and started to get enough distance to the willow again. Rose and Scorpius did the same. Then they went around the tree again and Scorpius removed the stone from the root bulb. The willow finished the whipping it had started earlier and then stood still again.
"No. Why should I" - Scorpius shook his head briefly and then looked to the side, just not in Albus' direction. This, of course, caught his eye immediately and the Potter grinned.
"Well, Harry Potter. HP are father's initials. And father was in Gryffindor" - With full force, Albus slapped his own forehead. Why hadn't he thought of that, then? He was such a dork!
"Oh come on, you're at least as keen to try out the Patronus!" shouted Albus and ran on towards the forbidden forest. A moment ago they had Defense Against the Dark Arts and their teacher was teaching them the Patronus spell, only in theory, of course. The practice would be some time coming, which didn't mean that the students couldn't try it out anyway. After all, nothing was forbidden to them.
"And DM?" - Albus didn't want to dwell on the fact that he hadn't thought of his own father when he thought of the initials. After all, it was Harry Potter! Still, they'd have to check. They could just as easily be wrong about that.
// They were in the corridors of Hogwarts. Everything was gray and the school seemed empty. Then, however, they could see young Draco Malfoy turning the corner. He was maybe 16 in this memory possibly 17, they couldn't tell for sure. But Scorpius was struck by how similar he really looked to his father. Actually, confusingly similar.
"I think we should search through the ground first. Often it's a root bulb sticking out of the ground," Scorpius replied, already starting to look for a root sticking out. While Scorpius and Rose went in one direction, Albus went in the opposite to search the ground around the willow.
"Then I suppose it would be most advisable if we went straight to Dumbledore. After all, he knows best about Harry Potter and his school days," Scorpius, who had been quietly watching his friends' exchange of words, spoke up again after a long time. It was strange for him to think that his father had something to do with Harry Potter, but he couldn't really rule it out. After all, he knew how unhappy his father was with his mother. And maybe that was because his heart was already set on someone else? Maybe even to Harry Potter? Who really knew?
"Hopefully this one has something to do with the tree. Because if not, I guess we'll just have to look at all the memories until we find something," Rose said, reminding the boys again what they were here for in the first place. They wanted to find out what the tape around the whomping willow was all about. But slowly they felt that they were losing sight of their goal. So many new chasms had opened up that they were no longer sure what to think of their own fathers, their families. Had it all been a lie? Could it really be that their fathers felt so much for each other and no one had ever noticed? Why? Why weren't they together if they seemed to love each other? Or had once done so?
Albus read through the notes again briefly and then positioned himself. He pulled out his wand and aimed it at the whipping willow, just in case. After all, he knew all too well that no matter how harmless a spell seemed, it could cause enormous damage with incorrect use. Anticipation flooded the boy's small body and his hand almost began to tremble, which he was still able to suppress. He closed his eyes and thought.
"Tomorrow after class we'll go back to the whipping willow and then look into it!" - Determined, Albus nodded and stood up, now heading to his own common room.
The three students, emerged from the bowl again and looked at each other. They were silent, trying to really comprehend what they had just seen.
"Albus don't! If you get too close to it, it'll-" Rose was still trying to warn the young Gryffindor, but by then it was too late. A whip of the willow, came crashing toward Albus, flinging him several feet away from it.
"Hey Scorpius, what are you reading?" asked Albus, dropping heavily onto the sofa next to the blond.
"Yes, I suppose he does own one. Back in his school days, he had asked me all sorts of things about Pensieves. Even the things you really only needed to know if you were planning on getting one. Where he hides it and whether he owns it, I don't know. Maybe you should take a look around the Room of Requirement. There are a lot of secrets hidden there."
"Hey, I think I've got something here!" suddenly exclaimed Rose, pointing to a large root bulb. It was the biggest of all and therefore most likely the right one. Albus came running from the left and searched briefly for the bulb, before he also discovered it.
"It won't come off" - "What do you mean, it won't come off?" asked Scorpius, now also reaching for the ribbon. To test it, he gave it a quick tug and came to the same conclusion.
"Guys! I found it!" he shouted immediately, and alarmed, the Ravenclaws ran to him. And indeed, Albus had found his father's Pensieve. At least, they suspected that it belonged to his father, who else could it belong to?
"Well, because our fathers aren't gay? I can't imagine my father ever having anything with a man. Besides, he always insists that mother has been the only woman for him"-"Like you said, Albus. The only woman. I can't imagine Uncle Harry having anything with a man either, yet we can't rule it out" - Rose was right. As unlikely as it sounded, they had to keep all their options open for now.
"Rose, it's all right. I'm just a little nauseous from the impact, but I'm not hurt" - Relieved, Rose exhaled, still kneeling next to her best friend. He was lying on his back, trying to catch his breath. That had been a violent blow, he would have to recover from it first.
"Professor, do you know anything, about the ribbon on the whipping willow?" - Slowly, this was getting too tiring for Scorpius. They were here to get information, and he would finally like it.
"What do you want Albus?" - Now James turned to his brother and looked at him, waiting. It was immediately clear to him that the younger boy wanted something from him. It was always like this. His little brother always wanted something.
"May I ask what you want from him?" the principal asked, already walking towards the portrait of the former principal.
"And no one noticed it hanging here before?" - Albus thought hard about what the ribbon might be about, but somehow the idea of a love oath seemed most plausible to him as well. Or an attempt to unite Slytherin and Gryffindor in friendship. That would also be another possibility.
"I can understand your anger, but will you stop talking about Ginny like that? It's not her fault!", Harry defended the red-haired girl, not knowing that he had made probably the biggest mistake he could have made. Malfoy looked him in the eye, even more hurt, and that was exactly the moment when the otherwise so controlled Malfoy, finally lost his patience.
"Expecto Patronum!" And then happened - nothing. Not even a bluish mist could be seen. Which meant he wasn't even close to summoning a Patronus. He slowly lowered his arm. This was more than disappointing to Albus. He had been so sure, after all. It had been the happiest memory he had. So why hadn't it worked?
"The Room of Requirement is not on the Marauder's Map. It is also called 'Come and go room'. It only appears when it is really needed. You have to conjure it up with your mind, in a way, and then wish for a room. And here is the problem. If Uncle Harry has thought up a special room, we have to find out what the 'password' is. Otherwise we will never get into this room" - Rose was more than happy that her mother had already informed her about this room in the first year of school. Hermione had told her daughter all about it, in case she needed some quiet time to study. Since Hermione could remember all too well her own school days and had used the Room of Requirement for the same purposes. And she knew that Rose was second to her in her eagerness to learn, which made her very happy!
