“I know.” She muttered, though she knew the words would change nothing. “It’s your favorite.”
Hermione winced again. He still had not turned to face her– she wondered if he ever would. The silence between them grew thick as she closed her eyes to keep tears from escaping.
Draco looked at Harry’s lips and her stomach lurched in anticipation of another kiss. Hermione squeezed her eyes shut, afraid that if she kept them open she might vomit.
“You’ve had one too many of those, haven’t you?” He chuckled, turning towards his new husband as if expecting him to speak. When Draco remained silent, Harry turned back towards her. “Well, I hope you’re enjoying the ceremony. I certainly am.”
“I’m drunk?” Hermione hissed. “No, Draco. I’m hurt. I’m wounded. I’m fucking devastated.”
In that moment she knew. Or at least, thought she knew.
But even that was not the answer she needed. She wondered if she kept asking questions whether he would leave sooner, or if he pitied her enough in this moment to stay and endure her questioning. She prayed to Merlin he wouldn’t leave, not while she was like this, not while she was in danger. “Important to who, Draco?”
“And you wonder why I can’t look at you– I could feel you pleading, every day at the ministry– at the wedding– I could feel how badly you needed me to look. But I looked at you every single night. And I looked at you, and looked at you, and I couldn’t turn away from the pain and the agony in your face. So I can’t bring myself to look at you now. Because that same fucking pain is in your eyes, and I know that it’s all my fault. I know, Granger.”
Hermione’s eyes went wide. She understood that part. She was being tracked.
young man." Draco rolled his eyes and sat back down on the bed.
That could have gone a lot better. So maybe Draco isn't taking advantage of him. Harry did look like he was having fun- Ahhhh. No. Nope, never thinking about that again. How am I going to look at him?
He’s right now hiding in the bathroom. He has a blouse that has a huge design on the back that says “I hit for both teams”, black leggings, and rainbow makeup. He had worn this when he had gone to a gay bar during the summer.
"We thought you knew?" "Knew what?" Ron questions.
Harry looks up and sees Draco and Pansy passing a note to each other over and over. Each time one of them would scribble something on it before passing it again.
Harry seemed very happy to show him and had a smile on his face the whole time Ron was looking at it on his... Ring finger?
oblivious. But Harry surely has to know that placing a ring on your
Draco smiles at how cute Harry is. He walks to lunch to maybe get something to eat. Draco goes there and grabs his signature green apple and sits down.
"Pansy, why would you agree to that?" Draco crosses his arms and turns away from her.
Harry gathers all of his queer energy and speed walks away. He gets into the school just as the first bell rings. He has a few minutes to head to class and sit, pretending to listen while daydreaming of Draco.
Outside the r.o.r, Fred, and George are cackling. Plan Drarry was set in motion.
"Is it really that much of a surprise?" Hermione stares at the three. "It's the whole reason Pansy and I became friends last year."
The ring has a white gold band and has a frankly huge smokey diamond. The diamond has an infinity symbol engraved into it, so small you might miss it if you weren't looking for it, and the ring band itself is shaped into an infinite symbol.
Great Professor Snape is in a lousy mood today, he's got his 'I'm having a rotten day, so all of you should have one as well' sneer. Wonder if I can escape his wrath? Hope I don't get detenio-'
"Draco, we have 2 weeks to finish this project, and we've barely done any of it. This is a perfect time to gather all the information and for
They sit down and start to eat. Ron and Hermione being all love-y and making googly eyes at each other. Harry slowly leaves as not to break their... thing.
Ron took his eyes off the ring and looked back up to the very happy Harry and complimented the ring. It truly is a beautiful ring and, if anyone would have given it to him as a promise, he would probably faint.
Harry and Draco are cuddling in the r.o.r. “I like you,” Harry says to him while half asleep. “I like you more,” and then they both fall asleep in each other's arms.
At the end of their study session, they have all of their information and only have to figure out how they'll be presenting.
Harry gets through class without questioning it
The trio head outside to their normal spot to eat. Walking in a comfortable silence as they listen to the loud chatter of the halls.
"You hear that, Draco, you get to hang out with Harry again." Draco turns a bit pink and looks annoyed.
"We've promosed ourselfs to each other." Draco sits down as he says the world-shattering news so casually.
What? Ron almost wanted to say, "That you guys were fucking?" Luckily he has enough self-control not to.
He sits down and kind of wishes for a certain blond Slytherin to be the one to break the spell.
"Hey..." one quiet "Hi" was heard from Hermione. "Well, are you going to tell us what the hell that was?!" Seamus breaks the silence. Harry and Draco glace at each other confused.
"Ronald. For your imformation I have been wearing this ring for over a month. I guess it's true that you really are unobservant. " Draco got up right after and strutted away like a confident rich perso- Oh right...
You might be questioning “What did the spell do?”. The spell made it so that Harry has to wear all of the outfits he never wanted anyone to see and it changes into something even worse each hour and he can’t get changed because whatever he puts on will disappear. Well, it’s not a part of his original outfit.
Harry stares at Draco’s bare chest looking at every detail of it. He hovers his hand above him before looking up to Draco making sure he was ok with it. Draco gives a short nod and Harry starts to touch him.
Luckily the spell didn’t make him too uncomfortable by putting him in a skirt or dress. But he couldn’t even wear his uniform. He walked to breakfast in a crop top and leggings. He normally would be fine with this during the summer when he’s at the safe house. He wouldn't normally wear this in front of his peers and teachers though it isn't too bad.
After Nevil made a small explosion, that light a paper on fire causing people to freak out.
“Can I lean on the wall?” Harry takes his mouth off of Draco with a satisfying pop. Draco repositions himself so he won’t fall over later. “Ok, I’m ready.” Harry feels for Draco then puts him back in his mouth going at the same speed he was going at earlier.
They make it out to a small courtyard, hidden away if you were not looking for it.
Draco pulled away and just stared at Harry for a second. He had been dreaming of a moment of this for some time now and he wanted to enjoy it while it lasted. He continued to take in every inch of Harry that he could see since they were in a broom closet, but everything he could see beautiful.
"Y-yeah! It's about plant vs. animal cells." Harry silently cursed at himself for stuttering, but Draco seemed to not notice making Harry calm down a bit.
This has been happening more and more since they started dating, not that Harry minded, ok that's a lie he actually was a bit jealous. But he couldn't blame them. He would do the same if he and Draco were dating. Not like that will ever happen.
"I thought your crush on him died off when you stopped talking to him a year or two ago." "Ron, that's when we got together."
'Draco would never like
Draco awakes at his usual time of 5:45 to get ready and finish any last-minute school work he might have. If he actually was being honest, he spent at least 60 minutes doing his hair.
to get promise rings?! You can't just promise yourself to someone you just stopped hating." Both Pansy and Hermione turn to him.
Ron's thoughts of the ring died down a bit until he noticed one on Draco Malfoy. He wasn't thinking when he spoke, "Since when have you been wearing that?" He pointed to the ring while eating causing Draco to sneer at him with disgust.
A few months after all of them started hanging out, Ron noticed a ring appear on Harry's finger. It isn't uncommon for wizards to wear rings even if unmarried, unlike in the muggle world, which Ron still finds weird.
"So, what do you- I mean, what information have you gotten?" Draco completely twisted up what he said, though Harry seemed to understand.
to learn more things about Harry." Pansy explains completely serious.
Now, Ron knows that Harry doesn't know
"I-uh got this book from Hermione, and she- I read it. So there is this th-thing-" Draco has to stop himself from blushing Harry stuttering is absolutely adorable.
Why would Draco and Harry have matching rings and both of them wearing them on their ring finger? Surely, it has to be a coincidence.
“Can you go a little faster?” Harry complies and starts to bob his head even faster. Draco lets out another gasp as Harry slows when he gets closer to the base. Draco had dreamt of this for so long and he couldn’t hold himself up like this for long.
Draco and Pansy walk into the library and immediately see Harry and Hermione sitting at a table closer to the back. As they get closer to the table they see, Harry's face a bit pink and Hermione quietly giggling.
Pansy grabs one of the books on the table. She sits next to Draco.
sits down there?'
Harry and Draco had gotten a lot closer after Hermione and Pansy became friends. Not that Ron minded, though it is a bit weird how they looked at each other. He knew that Harry used to have a thing for Malfoy but, he stopped talking about him a year or two ago. He never found out why he just assumed Harry lost interest.
Draco's hips start to buckle a little. He can’t hold it in for long. Harry brings his mouth to the tip and starts to lick making Draco going into pure bliss. Harry looks up to Draco silently trying to figure out if he liked it.
Draco just rolls his eyes and look at his food.
Harry quickly takes off his knickers and sits on Draco’s thighs. “Can I ride you?” Harry looks at Draco questioning. Draco nods and takes his wand to cast a spell to summon some lubricant. He takes his palm and rubs it on his now hard again member. He also brings his finders over to Harry.
His rant gets cut off by Hermione. "Hey, Pansy! You know that group project we have to do? The one Professor Snape gave us last week with Draco and Harry?"
Ron eventually finds Draco... and Harry in Draco's dorm having some "fun" without anything to cover them. Ron's immediate response was to scream and run away. In his confusion, he ran into a wall knocking him onto the floor.
Draco and Harry look at each other. But promptly look down at the papers and books in front of them.
Harry snaps out of his thoughts by a loud bell ringing signalling everyone to leave and head to their next class. A few students were starting to get up when Snape snapped at them to sit down.
"Listen Ron-" "Ahhhhhh, I need a moment." Ron looked at a wall and the couple gave him a bit of space. He took a deep breath and turned to them.
Now he needs to do the other way of getting rid of the spell. Someone that is in love with him has to get a BONER AND (because it can't end here) HAVE SEX with him for him to get changed back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Can we both just take everything off?” Harry asks Draco, still on his knees. Draco agrees and they both take off their pants, only leaving their undergarments.
Harry slowly walked over to Ron and, with the help of Draco, sat him down in a clean armchair. The first words out of Ron's mouth was not "You're dating?!" or "I'm sorry." or even an "I'll be leaving." No, it was none of those, he said, "Harry, no!"
the wizarding customs and traditions, he isn't
Harry wipes his lips with his wrist and looks at Draco. “You're in love with me?” “Yeah…” Harry rests his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I like you too.” Draco looks at him surprised.
After a few moments of Draco sucking on the spot Harry can feel a certain tightness in his knickers, yes the spell even affected them. Draco had seemed to notice since he stopped sucking and pulled away leaving only a bruise. Harry felt a tad bit saddened by the loss of contact, but he was soon unsaddened by Draco crashing their lips together.
10 minutes later
Harry started slower and started going faster. Both of them moaning and gasping. Harry felt a knot in his stomach and he shoots out long white lines onto both of their stomachs. Soon Harry feels a warm sensation being poured into him.
“Hey, Pottah!” He walked right up to Harry in the empty hallway. “I have a deal for you. We can fix your whole situation and I get to have my way with you.” Draco sticks his hand out for Harry to shake.
The whole class sighed, many of them had lunch next and simply wanted to leave. "Now I have been tasked with letting you know that the Prom is on the
Harry slings the rucksack over his shoulder and walks off. He slumps himself against a wall near the back of the school.
Harry has only ever once wanted to kill someone this bad. But this time he wants to kill two someones. Fred and George. The bloody dumbasses. They decided last night to get drunk, cast a prank spell on him, and then forget the counter spell that he needs.
"Guys, Draco and I have matching rings. And my gemstone matches his eyes and Draco's matches my eyes." Harry took Draco's hand and showed it to all of them.
The entrance to the place is overgrown and if you were to simply cut it back it would have been obvious where they were. The ground is made of an obscure cobblestone design. The walls covered in ivy with smaller trees along the edge. Flowers placed at random. And a wood picnic bench covered by an overhang.
Draco’s lips trailed down Harry’s neck making Harry gasps as he nipped on a more sensitive spot. Harry didn't mind this, he actually had been having… fantasies of Draco for some time now.
Harry heard something that knocked him out of his head. “Does this feel good?” Draco asks as he nipped at that one sensitive. “Yes,” Harry says breathlessly. Draco starts to nip and lick the spot more, happy to get a reaction out of Harry.
Harry sits back down and starts to rack his head on who Draco could like. 'Is it Blaise? No... I think he's dating someone. Nevi- No. Ron? Stop thinking such ridiculous thoughts.'
Draco grumbles a bit before starting to eat the food Pansy and Blaise got him.
"We're reading the books we have here." Draco hands a book to Hermione and goes back to reading his. Hermione takes it and sits down next to Harry.
Ron gave him a stern look. "I'm not ready to talk to
Draco and Pansy find and sit with Blaise.
Draco finally gets there and sees Pansy sitting with Blaise. He quickly walks over to them and sits down. Pansy hands him a plate with a traditional English breakfast on it, Draco gladly takes it and puts it in front of him on the table.
They stop for lunch and agree to meet up later.
Draco and Pansy go back to the library a bit after lunch and continue the process they had.
"What happened? I heard screaming!" Hermione looks at the three and freezes. Harry also gives her an awkward smile and a small wave.
“Can I?” He asked before he unbuttoned Harry’s shirt. Harry simply does it himself by undoing each button as slowly as he could, teasing Draco along the way. Harry finally undoes the last button having the blouse only hang from his arms as he looks at Draco.
(You might be wondering how Ron knows so much about rings. Well, he doesn't know shit everything just said was told to him by Harry. Also, he has to remember to ask Hermione what white gold is.)
“May I?” Draco’s hand hovers over Harry’s chest waiting for an answer. “Yes, you may.” Draco’s hand then traces Harry’s six-pack. Draco then bends down a bit and starts to lick them going from the bruise still on Harry’s collarbone to the elastic of Harry’s leggings. He then starts to suck making Harry gasp as he left small bruises all over.
"Harry, this is the moment you've been waiting for. Go up to him and ask him out!" Hermione says the last bit slightly annoyed. "You have been talking about and pining over him for 2 YEARS. Even Ron didn't wait that long to talk to me."
Draco looks into the mirror and straightens out his outfit a bit. He walks out of his private room and heads to the meal hall.
"Well, he doesn't like
"Yeah, when can we meet up again for it?" Pansy answers a lot more engaged in the conversation than with the one with Draco.
"Blaise, you won't believe what Draco did." Blaise looks up from his food with a questioning look. "He actually talked to Harry today while we were studying." Blaise gave Draco a smile and a thumbs up.
Harry sees something move out of the corner of his eye and instinctively looks. He sees Draco sitting down next to him, not noticing Harry. Harry looks back to his paper and looks at Draco again, needing a double-take to make sure his eyes were not playing tricks on him.
Pansy and Draco sit down and start to pull out the papers they already started a few days ago.
He seemed to like it, so he continued to do it. “I’m going to cum.” Harry hears this and places his mouth back on Draco so he could swallow. Draco couldn’t hold it anymore and started shooting long white lines into Harry’s mouth.
Harry ran and grabbed the blanket that fell on the floor and covered himself. Draco, who is almost fully clothed unlike Harry, only had to pull up his pants.
Draco couldn't sleep that night. Too many gay thoughts.
Harry dares to glance behind him. He sees that Ron is still holding the book watching at him. He gulps and turns back just in time to see the last students entering the class.
Harry giggles a bit. “Eager are we?” Draco chuckles a little before continuing, Harry only giggles a little more. Draco continues to leave purple bruises all over Harry’s chest.
After a few minutes of just one finger, Draco adds another one. Draco does the same thing for the third one. Draco stretches Harry out a bit and then he takes out his fingers. Harry sits up and starts to position himself with the help of Draco.
Before Hermione and Pansy could speak, he storms out in search of Draco.
"I think it's so romantic!" Huh? What's romantic about Harry and Draco having matching rings?
Harry looked very uncomfortable and glances around the room. Ron also looks around, everyone that caught them is here. Ron feels awkward for them.
"To be fair, Ron is incredibly blunt." Hermione smiles and rolls her eyes playfully at Harry. And interwinds her hand with Ron's. She turns her head and gives a soft smile at her boyfriend.
He walked into the hall. He had gone to Dumbledore earlier and he explained to the teachers that he really couldn’t change. Harry feels everyone's eyes on him as he walks to the Gryffindor table.
“Harry, where is your uniform we have class today?” Hermione says worried that Harry had forgotten about something so important.
Everything pretty much went on as usual after befriending the silver trio, with the added factor of Draco, Pansy, and Blaise hanging around them. And the six of them being sort of a friend group.
"I can't. What if he doesn't like me? WHAT if he doesn't like blokes?" Draco pouts and sits down on a bench.
Harry whined to Hermione and Ron, about how cool and collected Draco is. He raved on and on about Draco to the point where to Hermione and Ron, he was background noise as they walked to their next class.
Harry quickly falls asleep from the embarrassing and tiring day he had.
Immediately everyone got up and rushed out of the room. Harry goes over to Ron and Hermione during all the chaos and starts to walk with them.
After a few minutes of bliss for both, Harry pulls away and signals for him to stop. “Did I do something wrong?” “No of course not you're doing everything right. I just want to give back a little.”
"That's it! Everyone out!" Ron pushed all of them. And closes the door a little. "Ok, Harry- I think that you should lock your door when you're doing- Ahhhh. We also need to talk! LATER!!" He's already outside when he says the last bit.
Harry looked at him surprised would Malfoy actually do this. He really doesn’t want to get into worse clothing, so he grabbed Draco’s hand and shook it furiously.
“May I?” Harry looks up to Draco, Harry’s hand hovering above the last thing covering them both. “Y-yes.” Draco stutters out, the anticipation weighing so much on them both.
Harry looks up from the book that was shoved to his face and glances at the teacher, who just started the lesson.
But this was normal for him and his friends. What is also typical for his friends is when he'll go on tangents for 2 hours about Harry. Or when he'll; insist that "No, Harry doesn't like me!" even when it's clear that he does.
"You can't just do that out of the blue!" Ron stands in frustration.
Ron walked up to Hermione and Pansy sitting on the couch. "Hey, do you know what Draco's ring looks like?" Pansy turns to him. "Has he not shown it to you? He likes to brag about it to anyone who will listen." Ron shook his head.
The ring shouldn't have bothered Ron as much as it did. For some reason, there was something about it. He finally got the chance to look up close when he, surprisingly and very easily, asked Harry to see it.
"Huh?" He says without realizing. "Them getting promise rings. And that the stones match each others eyes!" Hermione stares at him, waiting for an answer.
Like when he screwed up and nearly told Draco what he truly felt about him. Or when he forgot one of his books and had to share Draco's. OR when he accidentally pulled out his journal (or diary, as Hermione and Ron called it) instead of another book he needed.
Harry and Draco stare at each other and Harry rests his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry and Draco step out of the closet having cleaned themselves up in the closet with a Tergeo. It’s still lunch, so no one was in the hallway. Harry gives Draco a small kiss on his cheek and leaves, so he could change into something.
“Can you?” Harry asks as he goes over to take off the slightly taller boy's shirt. Draco complies and does the same thing Harry did only now doing it slightly faster since he only had the quidditch sweater on.
Pansy and Hermione look at each other. In all the time they spent ranting about Harry and Draco being oblivious, they forgot to actually get the thing they needed. But Pansy being a fast thinker, quickly says, "We looked around the whole library. Somehow we couldn't find any, sorry."
...they say you can die when your heart breaks. Draco never believed it. But now he did.
Draco scanned the room. Right in front of him, two older gingers and that former Beauxbatons champion girl on a worn couch looked at him curiously. Meanwhile, his welcoming committee had split up: with Mrs. Weasley joining her husband on a love seat directly under the tree to the left while the other two sat down by the fire to the right, mixing in with a circle of people apparently in the middle of a game of Exploding Snap. Draco had never bothered to learn their names, but there was the surviving twin and that stuck-up ex-Head Boy. As well as one bushy-haired Hermione Granger. Oh goody.
So, right after breakfast on Boxing Day, he bade his parents goodbye and returned to Grimmauld Place.
His gaze dropped back to the notes. Master....
“If it's any consolation: It was quite spontaneous,” Draco offered, which gained him a nonplussed stare.
The other boy shifted. “You held me prisoner in your cellar.”
Draco carefully put the care packet on his desk before collapsing into a chair and slamming his arms onto the tabletop. He buried his face in the crooks, exhaustion washing over him.
“Yeah,” Granger agreed.
“Is that
Then he let out a shaky laugh. “How about that drink now?”
“Well, if you're certain...” When Draco's fingers touched the wooden surface it felt welcoming like the warmth of his mother's hug after their long separation.
The pause was long enough to make Harry wonder. “...people tell stories, Master Harry. They tell them about you, too.”
“Hermione!” Weasley cut in. Thank goodness. “You can S.P.E.W. later! Dobby, did you say 'down there'? So the Mell below us?”
Harry Potter and I'm a social outcast who hopes to gain back favour with the public by being with you?”
The house-elf had blinked. “Master Draco didn't ask.”
Sorry for the delay. Real life had demands (maybe even into next week, we'll see).
“What's that supposed to mean?” Draco turned his head to look at his companion.
Next week though... things are gonna get interesting XD
Harry pinched Malfoy's forehead. “Great tradition that is – slavery!”
want?”
“Ahem.” Lucius cleared his throat, effectively silencing all onlookers. “Mr. Potter, I would like to offer gratitude for you graciously lending your hand to–"
Draco hummed.
She and Ron had only come back from Australia a week ago and boy, had Harry missed them both. Letters could just not substitute for a live meeting. He was beyond glad they were back.
Harry smiled slowly. That had been unexpected. “Yeah, he really is.”
It had the desired effect of distraction.
“Don't call me 'Potter'. It's weird,” said Harry to the other him and glared.
“You're on.”
Uh oh. Seeker peered around the tree he'd taken cover behind: One of his team mates, a moss person, was on the verge of being captured by– Ember, of all people, bloody hell.
A song for the Hogwarts Fallen Fifty.

Since The Hunt would, in all probability, only appear again in December, Granger and Weasley had jumped off the daily-research-train. Instead the three of them had agreed on a weekly meeting on Wednesdays.

Weasley looked a bit dazed, as if shaken from a dream. He turned to Granger, eyebrows drawn up in question.
This song is more a Harry-with-The-Hunt Theme.
“He's not up to something, if that was what you were implying,” Harry countered heatedly.
“Wales. The book mentions that the sightings of The Hunt are often limited to one night of the year. Say it's tonight, then we have to get there before the sun comes up. Now, will you hurry? We have to leave!” With that she ripped the outfit out of Weasley's hands and pushed it onto Draco. “Get dressed. We wait outside.”
Breathing heavily, he tried to open a door to his right only belatedly realising that it was no door at all but one of the many trick walls just
Harry ran a hand through his hair, subconsciously mirroring the movement made earlier by his counterfeit. “I wouldn't know where to start. Hell, I don't even know if there's anything to talk
When they reached the stone, Ada led them to a hole that had approximately one metre in diameter. “This is it.”
“Dobby cannot feel Harry Potter's presence at all. Unless Harry Potter is in...” the tiny fellow trailed off and went pale. “Harry Potter might be in the Mell. That would be an explanation.”
Ember, who had somehow managed to find some clothing, snickered and Seeker sneered. He was about to mock the ginger for his slip-up (his girl, as if) when Wolfe let herself be pulled into a kiss by Half. Er, okay?
“That's not why you're out tonight though, is it?” Ron had folded his arms across his scrawny chest and tried hard to look just as intimidating as Warrington who had about an inch on him. “
Harry took the flapping, upset hands of his boyfriend into his own. “Yeah, like you, like everyone. I want a normal life, Draco. I want to grow old with you and die. Simple. Can you understand that?”
In return, Draco had been showered with bizarre and/or thoughtful gifts, including more than one unusual piece of pottery (“For your collection.”), making him wonder what had started his interest in ceramics. Was it... through someone?
It wasn't a priority.
“Argh! Sod it!
Eagle, Draco's owl, had not been best pleased about the new family member. Howard, however, had instantly understood that it was way more fun to be served food than to catch it. Eventually this had led to the bird and the feline taking to a tentative friendship which had now evolved into a full-blown acceptance that often found the two of them snuggling on a windowsill during midday.
“That won't work down here.” Queen Harry's voice was a thunderstorm. “Give. Me. Potter.”
Seeker watched them idly. Today's team was a wild mix of humans of all shades and a handful of moss folk. Those were still odd to him.
Harry blushed. Heart's name, indeed. Maybe he should go back to bed after all... well, only one more page?
But then I thought that would be a bit unsatisfying. So I hope you like the extension.
fault either.” Malfoy made an arm gesture that encompassed the whole memorial site. "Don't put it on your conscience."
“You could have said so earlier,” Malfoy chided and strode off to the left to try the first door handle. “Bloody hell, it's a trick door!”
He had wanted to re-connect at some point, but only after he would have found sure footing in his new beliefs.
Malfoy was silent for a long moment, his steps the only sound, a rhythm of echoing shoe-on-metal and dripping water.
“It's alright, Half. As long as Draco remembers, all is well. I put my trust in him. He will come for me. He will find me.”
His painted self looked thoughtful. “We never do that though. We never lean on others, not wholly. Sure, we ask for help, but in the end we are used to fending for ourselves. And yet...” he left the sentence unfinished hanging between the two Harrys.
“You bought

Contrasting against the black cat, Draco noticed a stained handkerchief wrapped around Potter's wrist. He started. Wasn't that a tiny D in the corner? It couldn't perchance be the one he'd given Potter the summer before last? No, impossible. What a thought. “I also have an owl, upstairs. This is Howard.”
Wow, this chapter (alternative chapter title: A Year with Seeker and The Wild Hunt) really turned out so much,
which resemble normal ghosts, but are indeed not really even ghosts. Rather they are the embodiment of accrued anger and frustration materialised in a human-shaped form, with the sole function of releasing stress by haunting. They are incorporeal of sorts, but can move objects. That's why Peeves always destroys things, as he is all of Hogwarts' residents' annoyance put together.”
Draco smiled humourlessly. “Mission accomplished.”
“He... he wants a word...” her brother supplied faintly, still looking utterly shocked.
“Hm?” Their forehead leaning together, Harry had closed his eyes. “I didn't say anything.”
I can believe, who'd want to hit
“Acquitted! We're acquitted!” Someone shook Draco's shoulder hard and rattled him back to reality.
Madam Hooch opened her mouth – likely to object – but was cut off before she even started.
and I was like– Ferret! Are you even listening?”
Ron's jaw dropped and he ogled her with just as much disbelief as the other two.
? Can't you bloody give the whole story for once!” Harry hadn't meant to yell, but he was sick of it. Always just bread crumbs, never the complete loaf. He was angry to find, once again he'd been manipulated by greater forces. Now he wanted answers and he would get them, goddammit.
When he'd been old enough to understand, Harry had sat Teddy down and brought him into the loop of all things Deathly Hallows.
Most times, the leader is a man and sometimes he hunts the crone. But then there are accounts where she is the leader and he is her servant. Or she is his servant. Sometimes they are married. Sometimes one of them is an animal or inanimate object.
All traces of Potter seemed to have been eradicated which meant looking for guidance in books was out of the question, at least where The Boy Who Lived was concerned.
However, Ember choosing the other team meant that right now they were rivals and Seeker had to act.
With the ghost procession coming ever nearer, Draco felt in equal shares terrified and euphoric.
She looked forlorn. “But you always just tolerated me, isn't that right? When you asked me to the Yule Ball back in fourth year, I was over the moon. From then on you let me get close, let me touch you and I figured
Blushing slightly, she tucked a curl behind her ear. “It was your idea. Ahem, now:

Draco made his best effort not to look scandalised. Seriously those Weasleys were worse blood traitors than he'd ever– no, he cut himself off halfway. He mustn't think of the freckled lot as blood traitors anymore. He swore to himself to leave those bigoted ways behind him. But still, how could anyone not have a private library? Pft, heathens.

“But you're wondering if I
“Draco!” Half exclaimed ecstatically and hugged a floundering Draco.
On the fourth day, Granger had stormed in unannounced and had emptied a bucket of ice water over his head, proceeding with giving him a piece of her mind that had his ears ringing. Weasley had been standing by, snickering silently until the girl had turned to scold him too, for being insensible. Which really had lifted Draco's mood more than the preceding telling-off.
The Great Hall was buzzing like a bee hive and Harry was just starting to feel a bit more relaxed when they announced a big reveal and asked everyone to assemble in the Entrance Hall.
Tillie crossed her tiny arms and sulked.
Malfoy moved to look at his 'arm-chair', digging his shoulder into Harry's. “Are you actually daft, Potter? Prefects can
At this, Portrait-Harry blushed. “Maybe you should talk about this with him.”
Wolfe poked the redhead. “You're so rude. She's our benefactor after all, show a bit of respect!”
Draco:	        I had to fall, to lose it all… in the end it doesn’t even matter.
Draco forced himself to a polite smile. “Sounds lovely, Granger. Shall we then?”
The raven cocked her head and remained silent. Fine, keep some secrets, why not.
Weirdly, Draco stiffened for a moment and when he spoke, he looked down at the notebook. “Yeah, about that... Ahem, so we thought that, you know, because you were temporarily the owner of my wand and we therefore somehow 'shared' a wand, that that made up the 'most powerful connection'. The lore says only the most powerful connection can make it so that people remember kidnapped witnesses. And since wandlore is complex, especially regarding ownership and allegiance, it made sense.”
“Easy, the room must be unplottable. You know, like the Room of Requirement where you busted Dumbledore's Army? You would have never found that place if not for Marietta's sneaking help,” Granger explained and Pansy irritatedly felt a hand gently nudging her around a corner.
In a series of unforeseen events, once again, nothing happened.
before, just not in that amount and– Geez, he needed a break from himself, pronto.
The redhead snorted. “Why don't you start by filling us in,
He frowned. Sure, he wasn't the best swimmer, but did he really mess up directions and swam into a castle wall instead of upwards? A few air bubbles floated by lazily. No, they went up, so Draco had it right, which meant... “This is a ceiling of a kind. Maybe we're not in the lake after all but in some sort of underwater chamber?”
Yes! ….no?
“I'm not going in there.” Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest, but uncrossed them right away to pluck Potter from the water and put him back onto his head. The soaking feeling of water running down his strands was nasty. Draco pointed his wand blindly at Potter's direction and blew a Hot Air Charm at the Gryffindor.
Fine. Whatever.
His throat was dry. The tea-bag in his golden cup invitingly read
The moment she was out of sight, a clamour of cheers broke out among The Hunt. Okay, what now?
He fluttered his eyelashes, sitting up. The soundscape seemed to intensify and his head made a valiant effort at exploding from sudden pain. He groaned and rubbed his hands over his eyes to shut out the colourful scenery spread out around him: There were people in oddest apparel sitting, standing, dancing, chatting and laughing in every direction, yet they seemed to take no notice of him. His fingers met resistance and he bent his brows when he fumbled for the strange thing on his face. Ah, yes, glasses, he wore glasses. Which made sense since the moment he took them off, the whole eccentric mass of characters turned blurry in the misty morning light.
He wasn't deigned an answer as the Slytherin was delicately checking his shins. Harry watched over Malfoy's shoulder and winced slightly at the unsightly haematomata that covered both the blond's lower legs. “Know any Healing Charms?”
name can set one free. Right in this case being debatable – either the birth name or a name with the right
The others exchanged glances. Maybe it was best to drop this topic for now. When it came to Dreamer, Ember was best not to be trifled with.
How many times was that now? Five? Ten? But he had to be patient and repeat the purpose of their meeting every now and then or else the other two would slowly forget.
Hermione watched him duck into the narrow opening and–
Wolfe cooed delighted. “What a beauty she is.” Snowdrop seemed to agree with this assessment as she gracefully landed on the girl's shoulder and accepted an un-barbecued piece of marshmallow from her.
he could do him a favour by partaking in this nonsensical spectacle. Just to cheer him up. After all, without Potter's good relation to the merpeople, Draco would have been a giant squid snack by now.
For a moment it seemed as if Mr. Withane was going to shut the door in their faces, but then he opened it wider and moved back a bit. “Come in.”
(Draco's side note: Put part of her powers into the plants?? Further research necessary)
Draco soothingly carded his aged hand through Harry's grey hair. “Didn't really plan it like this, love.” He kissed the tip of Harry's outer ear. “Did you settle all our affairs?”
But Draco didn’t. Not back then. Not when the leaves began to fall from the trees and they laid in the red and orange piles on their backs and when they accidentally fell asleep in each other’s arms in the sun. Not when he kissed her by the frozen lake in the winter when no one else was looking. They were too busy building snowmen to cast a warming charm, so the next day she was sent to the Hospital Wing for a severe cold. Not when they looked out upon the grounds from the Astronomy Tower and tried to count all the trees in the forest. She had counted two hundred and thirteen, but he had counted two hundred and thirty.
Draco groaned, looking around. “Stop speaking.”
He paused and ran a hand through his slicked hair. Hermione took that as an opportunity to speak. “It was your fault, Draco. And every day, I felt like it was my fault too.”
when he was still too cowardly to face the demons he’d left behind with her.
? How did you–” She stuttered. “How could you–”
“That’s rich.” She countered.
Because he was a Death Eater, and she was the Golden Girl. A taboo, a wrong-doing that they agreed would be too shocking to share, but low and behold here he stood with the fucking Chosen One, so maybe it was just her he didn’t want to be seen with.
Hermione wondered if Draco had asked Harry about the curse as he leaned down to whisper something in his husband’s ear. The two looked absolutely chuffed. Perhaps they’d never discussed it– perhaps Draco had rather forgiven and forgotten Harry’s sectumsempra than Hermione’s screams.
“No!” She was shouting at this point, unbothered by who else might hear.
Draco’s last name should be Granger-Malfoy not fucking Malfoy-Potter.
She hated happy people.
Yeah, he was just a boy. Just a boy who leaves every time things get tough. Just a boy who married Harry Potter to escape the girl he’d promised the world. A boy who had rather loved her best friend than her.
Red found a different meaning during the war, she supposed, when red was no longer a color of pride but a color of death and loss. Blood had always been Draco Malfoy’s fascination. His was pure as snow, or so he claimed– sacred, untouched. He’d never seen her bleed before that night at Malfoy Manor. Hermione tried to imagine the shock on his face when he realized her own blood was red, not brown.
everywhere she looked. No, instead, people pestered her, the old fashioned way, with parchment and ink.
In the car, she rolled the windows down and played a Nirvana CD at max volume. The noise made her already pounding headache worse, but silence was simply not an option. She could not be left alone with her thoughts or else she would begin to overthink. Using her brain was dangerous anymore. She simply thought
And what about the letters? They had been sending her letters. Who, if not Harry, Ron and Ginny, had she been communicating with? She assembled a list of things she knew– Molly’s cancer, Teddy’s birthday parties– and wondered if it had been secondhand knowledge.
Something in his voice made Hermione’s stomach churn– something reminiscent of the boy she’d held in the Room of Requirement– something dangerously close to fear. It sent shivers down her spine, so she shut up.
Draco said– his tone teetering dangerously between a demand and a plea. “Say something, damn it.”
to hire her. He would bring her hot chocolate on Sundays and let her browse the shelves, though she would never buy a book. She only made enough to pay her rent and buy her groceries. She’d try her best to read at work, but she could never finish a novel because by the time she reached rising action in the story, a rush would hit and she’d be forced to help customers instead. Often someone would request to purchase the book she was reading, and she couldn’t say no. Thus, the little bookshelf Hermione had built at home was sad and empty, but she read the few books she’d brought along from home over and over. Harry would always offer to send money– but she refused to tell him the currency she needed. She knew they would find her eventually if only they knew where to look.
“No! Just stop. You will never be able to say the right thing. You should just leave like you always do.” Hermione’s voice wavered. “Walk away and stay as unbothered as you have always been.”
He closed his eyes and put his forehead against the cold glass, suddenly very tired. Ever since receiving word from Sir Nicholas about a week ago, Draco had been wired. Too fidgety to sleep for long, too nervous to do something useful. He had been waiting, waiting, waiting and now that the wait was over, the restless energy driving him so far, had left him.
Draco simply nodded.
And as if they didn't just have a conversation about life and death and darkness, they returned to chanting spells. But maybe that was the beauty of their current relationship: United they could fall apart and put themselves back together again.
“Well, off you go then,” sniffed Pansy and was delighted when the ginger grumbled silently, but got up to get the reference work anyway.
Harry nodded. “So, what you're saying is that I got abducted by this ghost procession. And you  really are dead, ghosts. Even most of the animals.” Agreement all around. “But, if you are dead and I'm alive then how can you know me?”
your legs.”
“Perchta of course. Though today she's Frigg. Now get up or you're really going to miss it.” Half pulled him up.
The Chaser of the Slytherin team eyed her sceptically. “Why?”
Stepping through, they found themselves inside a broad, round well, stuffed with battered furniture, and with walls leading so high up the ceiling couldn't be made out.
“It's only his third time,” Potter explained unbidden and superfluously.
“Hey, you!” A cheerful voice to his right made Harry jump. “Yes, you! Good to see you again!”
They all exchanged worried glances.
Ember and BraveHeart joined in his tittering and Seeker hid a grin.
“Mhm, I'd rather you took something off then put more on, but I guess that'll have to wait until after.” Harry grinned and strolled back to the bedroom, leaving a flustered Draco standing in the library.
Draco had to admit that it made sense. Investigating The Hunt meant ultimately locating it and with it, Potter. Which was what he'd been suggesting from the beginning. Yet... Granger might be on to something with the not-mentioning about Scarhead for now. If they could keep the information about The Hunt better this way....
“–yet you did save me!” ...and died down. Harry blinked. Oh.
Harry nodded. “Do you know what it does?”
Maybe if he snuck away he could...?
The redhead shifted from one foot to the other. “I know we just made up... we did, didn't we?”
“Great! Let's shake on it?” Harry grinned and intoned in a mock-Death voice “After all, you said it yourself: We are comrades forevermore.”
“Maybe until you mean it?” Potter challenged.
Alright, if he wanted to play it this way. “Nah, I can't let you be the only one looking like shit.”
Life shook her head. “Bite me if I've ever seen such a dunderhead! You're really something else, boyo.” She reached out with her cold hands and mussed up Harry's hair and then, for good measure, Draco's.
“Yes, but you said she will most probably never wake up again. Wouldn't it be better for her if she, you know, were reborn?” He indicated vaguely towards Holle's Pond.
– to go see him, the boy at the barn!”
What Draco had tried to do was to draw his wand, what actually happened was that Potter  moved at the same time which ended with Draco's elbow hitting Potter full in the face.
“Say... when we first met, didn't you tell me The Hunt had picked you up only a few months before me?” he spoke to no one in particular.
Queen Harry nodded.
! Catching her will mean the end of everything. We have to stop this! Stop The Hunt from chasing her!”
“Seventy years later and you're still here,” broke Harry the amiable silence as they walked.
The lights flickered. No, they didn't. But it felt to Harry as if they did, when the world suddenly started tilting before his eyes. Myrtle and Malfoy and water...
Sometimes Potter was really easy.
At her words, several armed merpeople spiralled gracefully and in perfect harmony into the open water.
Saturdays were for Patchers' Quidditch games with quite a bunch of Potter's friends.
the Auror now.”
Harry shielded his eyes. “How can you tell?”
Hermione nodded. “Okay, but we'll have to get to the library first.”
Pansy Parkinson, wearing a pink neckerchief and a stormy expression on her pug face, came at Draco at top speed and slapped him hard. Her eyes emitted sparks as she drew up to her full height: “You deserved that.”
That made sense and Hermione felt her cheeks warm at being classified as the leader with no one disagreeing.
Malfoy, in the middle of adjusting his cloak, looked up, flabbergasted. “What now? Potter, are you seriously that stupid? We're free, let's make a run for it!”
Then Harry turned to Draco. “You know, I had a lot of weird things happen in my life, but Death himself making a love confession on my behalf really takes the cake.” His features softened when he saw Draco blush. “I think I need to say this properly now.”
“Indeed, she does.” Half's eye-roll was almost audible. “Please, don't encourage her, Seeker!”
?” she shrieked at the end, so that Cassius had to calm her down once more. They weren’t super-close actually, but his calm demeanour always had a soothing effect on her. Maybe it had been a good thing to have this half-Hufflepuff come along after all.
, sure, happy to provide a safe space for you.”
Except, there was a night raven perching on his shoulder. A black bird with white feathers dotting its wing tips. It could have been any old bird, but Harry knew the moment he saw it that this was yet another form of Holle's. For her sheer presence was emitted in such a humongous way that he was once again reminded just how powerful and ancient she really must be. Yet there was also her softness that, even in this dark place, made him feel something akin to hope. She was like winter and spring – bird or no bird. Her beady eyes seemed almost glowing when she looked down at him.
Pansy waved the comment away. Cassius' sub-bar school performance was widely known in Slytherin. At least he was gifted on a broom. “Neither is Weasley, don't mind it.”
“Look who's back, Snowdrop!” Half called when they approached the horse group with the sleeping snow owl. Leaning towards Harry he added: “She was just as worried about you as we were, I swear.”
Out of the pipe, they'd found themselves in a long, obviously still underground passage that stretched in both directions. Harry had used the Four-Point Spell that he'd learnt last year to guide him through the maze and they had been walking since. Well, Malfoy had been.
“Potter.” Draco dipped his head and steered for the exit.
“No, it's etiquette. First names are only for people who are really close.” Slytherin Harry flashed Malfoy a sickeningly sweet smile and Harry felt a flash of annoyance. “Right,
“Ah, sorry to hear that.”

fault?), Harry had no chance but to trust Malfoy and do as he was told, even though he was pretty sure that that was a bad move.
To his surprise though, Granger positively beamed. “That is a great idea, Malfoy!” She turned to Weasley. “It would be just like old times!”
Alice was beaming. “There isn't any!”
after all, so better to focus on the here and now.
Draco furrowed his brows. Right. “Actually, why
So his parents had decided to start anew and to permanently relocate to their summer residence in France. They both had felt they needed the physical distance to work through everything they'd lost: their beliefs, their dignity, so many friendships and of course a sister and a sister-in-law.

[Chorus]
“Let's say Ron tells you tonight he loves biscuits baked by his mother” (Ron gave a indignant little squeak of disapproval which made Parkinson snicker meanly.) “and he feels that this is a secret, then the jinx holds you to secrecy. Should you tell anyone outside of this circle – that is us four and Ron's mother in this example, since the secret affects her, too – about the biscuit loving, you'll regret it. Unless of course, Ron allows you to disclose it. Got it?”
“Did you know?” she asked chipper. “There used to hang a portrait of your great aunt Walburga here. She insulted everyone passing by. Guess someone took it down. Well, good riddance if you ask me. She was very annoying.”
Four pairs of big eyes stared at him.
. Considering that you two do very much look alike, that was an honest mistake.” Holle took this moment to peck him at the shoulder; it looked like a scolding.
Everyone froze in their saddles. People were supposed to avoid The Hunt. Provoking it was most unwise and all the world knew it.
"...no." It was true. With Potter, Draco felt good, whole, in a way he hadn't for a really long time.
That wasn't planned at all, it just happened. Mostly because The Wild Hunt is a lore with many facets and versions.
Somehow, deep inside his heart, deeper than any enchantment could reach, he had known that there was someone special out there. He had recognised Draco's handkerchief as important, even before he had remembered. Also, quite tell-tale, The Beginning, which supposedly showed you what you most desire, had looked like a dragon to Harry. If
Ron didn't get a chance to look at the ring up close like Harry's. He did see that it also had a white band like Harry's and, it looked like it had a green stone. He'll have to ask Hermione or Pansy what Draco's ring looks like. They know Draco the best, plus Draco probably showed it off to them.
After breakfast, Draco refused to go to meet up with Harry and Hermione. Pansy had considered dragging him there, but all it took was 15 minutes of convincing and 3 green apples. The apples convinced him the most.
Draco went to bed that night with a lot to think about. 'Had Harry actually meant what he said while studying? Did he really think Draco was 'cool' or 'out of his league'?'
Pansy and Blaise continue to tease Draco though out lunch.
'What lesson am I in again? Oh right, history. Isn't this class mandatory? I always study better when I read or listen to Hermione explain about when Ron and I ask her for help. I'll study this later. All he talks about is... is... I have never learned anything from him.'
Harry takes his book from his rucksack and burries his face in it. 'Why did I think this would be a good idea? How unfocused was I not to remember
Draco stopped shooting the long white line after a few seconds. Harry takes his mouth off of Draco and he sits down next to where Draco was standing, Draco now collapsed next to Harry.
"Maybe after breakfast? We can meet up in the library." "Sure, see you there." Hermione walks back to her table, and Pansy looks at Draco.
That however had been the wrong thing to say, because Parkinson's face screwed up into a mask of panic. “Spring him?
Greengrass stuck her pinky into her earhole. “Did I really just hear
In other news:
“Don't be ridiculous, Potter, of course not. If you weren't a wizard, we would've never met.”
Harry groaned, rolled on his back and pressed the heels of his hands under his glasses onto his eyes. Malfoy was such a, such a! “Bloody Merlin, Malfoy! Not that again! I thought you found some sense in the lake at last.” Harry stared up at the slow-moving ceiling. “You were decent to her, Mabel. I figured you liked her alright.”
“Not gonna indulge you, Potter,” floated the answer down from the cushion pile on which Malfoy was currently standing, looking at the hole in the ceiling.
-gage,” she giggled the last bit.
“I,” Malfoy swallowed and Harry could feel under his own hands how the other boy furrowed his brow. “That's irrelevant, because it's hypothetical.”
Minerva McGonagall spilt some hot tea onto her tartan dressing gown and only her innate Britishness stopped her from cursing out loud. She did, however, give Draco a
Eyeing Harry as if he was waiting for a 'gotcha', Malfoy slowly leant back in his arm-chair when the bespectacled boy's face didn't change its distressed expression. “Explain.”
“Who they are. Inside.” Harry rolled back onto his stomach, he peered down Malfoy's forehead. “Would you never compete with me if I weren't a wizard? Never talk to me?”
But Draco instead ran a hand through his hair, his short sleeves revealing a tattoo on his left forearm. It was a skull with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue.
“Yes, hello, Dobby. Sorry to disturb you so late at night.” Granger smiled. Pansy thought she was weird for talking to a servant so... politely.
(as His Majesty had put it) and appearances, Draco spent most of his time with the Dork Duo. Which was exactly the problem, since he was supposed to have a useful connection to them because of their families, but not get too friendly with them. His father would be appalled should Draco ever refer to them by their first names... even though he'd like to. After all, they
Yes, that's life.
“Alright, looks like we have a destination,” Draco announced, gesturing for father and child to come closer.
Alright then, but still: “Er, true. Though the Heal-All Oyster helped. But yeah, no, thanks. Anyway, how do you have treacle?”
“Aren't we done with introductions yet? Besides, time to eat!” chuckled Wolfe who had finished handing out sticks with sticky sweets in different colours.
shirt,” he growled. Indeed, Potter was wearing Draco's old Quidditch training T-shirt, a school-issued uniformly black piece with the Slytherin crest on the left chest.
“Absolutely,” Ronald agreed, trying (and failing) for a sober face as he sat up straight. The other men giggled.
“Granger. Please listen to the whole story before you hex me.” Draco’s voice was hard again. He began to pace across the dusty floorboards beneath him. “No one has heard from you for five years, Granger. Not your friends. Not your parents. Not the ministry. You haven’t used magic enough for us to track you or make sure you were safe, until today. You cast a healing charm, and when you did that, we were able to locate not only you– but all things that are magically attached to you.”
Draco opened his mouth, but for once, Hermione didn’t want to hear whatever was going to come out of his lips. Lips that had kissed her– every part of her. Lips that couldn’t be bothered to speak her name in public for four years, before those exact same lips sealed a marriage with her own best friend. Lips that couldn’t be bothered to explain
They were entirely alone. It was relieving and excruciating.
She fought the rising bile in her throat, because she doubted the aforementioned ”
Hermione forced herself to speak. “Mi scusi?”
There was a moment of silence during which they both readjusted and Harry let it slide that Malfoy bodily leant into him with a huff of the greatly suffering. As if
, the thought alone, ugh.
“That's bullshit!” Harry didn't like either Crabbe or Goyle but to basically call them useful henchmen was just too much. He whirled round at Malfoy, daring him to affirm or deny.
“Nothing!” Malfoy exclaimed hastily, his eyes shooting daggers at Myrtle. “Just some song.”
Draco stretched his arms over his head. He was exhausted. Another dead end.
Draco blinked and then slowly gazed down his body. A moment later, he really, really wished, he hadn't and blushed scarlet. He was still wearing his pyjamas. The childish Hogwarts ones no less.
However when the school year had started and summer had come to an end, people had stopped coming. Fewer helpers had returned, their numbers becoming less and less, until it was only a handful of regulars.
Hermione brushed the other girl's hand off. “Don't worry, we're going for the package deal – we'll spring Harry and get Malfoy as a bonus. You'll have him back in no time.”
“Let's get out of here,” whispered his father into his ear after uncharacteristically hugging both, his wife and his son, in his arms. He smelt of sweat, but Draco didn't mind.
“Attention, we need another hand here. Who's up for roofing?” Madam Hooch's magically enforced voice caused several interested heads turning their way. Yet as soon as they saw who they would be partnered with, the free patch workers quickly resumed their loud chatter and all so they wouldn't have to work with Draco.
Potter snickered. “No. I don't live with them anymore. After all, I'm an adult in the wizarding world.”
Happy Pride month!
“King's Cross,” Harry repeated pensively. “Is that why this Hallow looks like a blank train ticket?”
The flight instructor scanned the task board for a one-man-job as Draco approached, and tilted her head. “No luck, we don't have any single-missions at the moment. How about a nice team play for once, hm?” she smiled like a hawk. Damn her.
got their memories back and they're probably swarming The Burrow where they'll suspect me to be. I don't fancy an exclusive with Rita right now, so let's go to Grimmauld Place, the four of us.”
The girl smiled sadly. “Obviously not the fact that they had to die before their time. But look at it this way: Here, as moss folk, with fun-loving riders of The Wild Hunt as companions, they can play to their hearts' content until they are ready to enter Holle's Pond and be reborn. In a way, Perchta gives them the life they couldn't live out there. That's the reason they have a special connection to her and sometimes know things we others don't. Anyway, occasionally  women who want to get pregnant but can't on their own, come here to the pond and offer gold or spindles of homespun yarn to Perchta to ask her for her blessing. And sometimes Perchta answers their prayers and goes into the pond to get a soul that is all set to be born anew and 'gives' it to the mothers-to-be. Probably because these women must really mean it if they made it here even though this area is protected by Hunt magic. But you know what they say: Nothing's stronger than a mother's love.”
The ginger scratched his face. “Make it a Portkey for three then. Round of Exploding Snap, Ferret?”
,” the old woman related while giving Myrtle a stern gaze, “that you two were 'being mean to girls at the Slytherin dorms'. Now, I can see, I was woken for nothing. Thank you, Myrtle.” The ghost girl blew out her cheeks. “But it's nice to see you two have become friends. Good work on the window.”
think these insights are
He sighed deeply and shifted so that he could put both arms around the crying boy in his lap. One hand started stroking Potter's untameable mane (finding it surprisingly soft) and Draco forced his anger down, beginning to whisper soothing words into Potter's ear, Draco's chin on top of  Potter's head.
“Granger, I don’t think it’s me who needs help.”
The urge to vomit returned. Nausea consumed her as Draco continued to speak.
“No, no, I’m fine, Harry.” She said.
It felt like a weight had been lifted from her chest– like a sigh of relief to release the smoke which had clouded her lungs. She could breathe, truly breathe, for the first time in what felt like forever. Hermione let his words ring in the air like a song, like a ballad– like Now and fucking Forever. It was closure– as close as closure can be. And it simultaneously felt like bliss and agony– the end of an era of pining after a man who could not love her, and the beginning of an era without him.
he was gorgeous in a tuxedo. No, she couldn’t stare at him as if he was the only wizard in the world, let alone the room, because no one knew. No one except her and Draco Malfoy himself.
“We have to get you back before someone finds you. The other aurors are waiting outside.” Harry threw an arm around her shoulder and tried to help her stand. His touch made her skin crawl– and she felt terrible for flinching. That was her best friend, but she couldn’t get the image of his lips on Draco’s out of her mind. The wedding– Harry’s smile– that first Christmas. She hadn’t forgotten– she hadn’t moved on. She didn’t want to blame Harry, but he was still the one Draco went home to at night.
The hired singer– a stout man with a beard and a bowtie– began to croon and Hermione felt the words like a curse to her spine.
The wall, the one she needed to break, was already broken. And in Draco’s face she saw the world’s youngest Death Eater, desperate and scared. Pain. There was pain.
None of the twelve keys Hermione attempted to shove into the lock were the one she needed, despite how much she mumbled obscenities at them. She groaned, missing her wand more than ever. A simple
“So it was all a lie? Counting trees and dancing around the Room of Requirement? Did you even love me?”
“If you’ll excuse me, I believe the Minister is about to leave. I can’t let him go without saying goodbye!” He chuckled and practically skipped across the room towards Kingsley Shacklebolt, leaving his groom behind.
“You bastard–”
Hermione’s lips trembled.“You were everything.”
she paused. “
Memories flashed inside her mind. Memories of the times she’d been led to believe this wedding would be hers. Times he’d promised– muttered words against her skin, like “I love you,” and “you’re mine.” Memories of the beginning, the middle and the end of their story. The beginning was bliss. Sometimes as she would lay in bed at night, wondering if Draco was laying next to her best friend, she would go back to the beginning of it all and make believe it was still her he laid with.
Harry sent letters too. Hermione couldn’t muster the strength to read them fully, but she hated herself for that. They were always about his little family– how great Draco was with Teddy Lupin. How happy he was. His new promotion at the ministry– he was head auror now. They were thinking about finding a surrogate– they wanted to try for a kid of their own. Hermione’s heart always sank a little more as she read, because she knew Harry was so happy. She couldn’t bring herself to ignore him or to tell him the truth.
be him. He shouldn’t have known where she was– shouldn’t be in Italy, let alone in this dusty little bookstore. Not Draco. Not anyone, for that matter. She had hidden herself so meticulously that no amount of sleuthing from her friends should have managed to uncover her. Her plan was foolproof– had been for over five years.
Draco could have just grabbed him. He had been
“We're not breaking any rules!” Warrington got into a fret.
“Great! Thanks! Good night!” And he all but ran from the room and up the stairs.
It had been the last time Seeker would see him for a while, as the gang had informed him that The Hunt's leader rode solitarily outside of winter time: Berchthold ruled The Hunt during Twelvetide, Perchta during the rest of the year.
keep calling me that?”
Draco smiled thinking about it and turned towards the counter once more: “Come here, Howard! Who is a good kitty?”
“Why, Potter, first candle light, now sunrise – are you inviting me on a date?”
“Hello,” Seeker said evenly, stepping into their circle.
“No way!” Harry grinned mischievously. “I want to watch your father faint when he sees the ring.”
“So glad I could provide entertainment,” Draco grumbled, sitting down primly between Lovegood and Thomas.
“Weren't we all?” had Hermione said and had patted the house-elf's head. “I'm not angry. We're friends after all, aren't we? Friends fight sometimes.”
The girl giggled following Harry's gaze. She petted the horse. “This is Binky,” her fingertips brushed over her face absent-mindedly, eyes hardening, “and I'm Wolfe.”
Just as Harry opened his mouth to either protest the last bit or ask after the first bit, Draco's hand closed vice-like around Harry's wrist.
