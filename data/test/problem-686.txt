“Look at that,” Harry said with a gasp, taking her fingers into his hands. “All wrinkly from the bath already, Daisy. High time to call it a day.” When he stood up, Daisy’s hands were still up in the air, a repetition of
“What are you three on about?” she asks, smiling and leaning back with her hands folded across the prominent swell of her middle.
Narrowing perfectly arched eyebrows, she slowly sipped her Manhattan with charmed cherry-red lips. “Harry Potter?” she repeated. “Considering that you’ve spent nearly half your life telling me about his dreamy green eyes and how pert his arse is, frankly, I’m stunned you’ve been able to keep this a secret. I’d have thought you’d have sent an owl winging its way over to me ten minutes after your first snog. You’re dating Harry Potter? Boy Who Lived and all around bothersome Griffindor git?”
Draco’s prick slips inside of Harry with one long, glorious slide, feeling much fuller, and less overwhelming, and all around very different in comparison to the intense, suckling sex toy, but alluring in a whole other way. They are close to one another as they fuck, a mass of entangled limbs and chest on chest. Draco holds Harry’s hands pinned over his head, either lust-laden eyes or hungry lips glued down on Harry.
Harry handed me the broomstick once he was done, and it was perfectly polished and light as a feather. I even sat astride it to hover above the ground in the middle of the workshop for a moment to try it, and it felt great. We spoke about the acceleration and such. Harry confessed that it would hardly compete with the faster and more expensive Firebolt models. But when I told him that the haptic of the handle was sleek and perfect, just the way I like it, and that I enjoyed the surprisingly light weight, he looked very pleased and perhaps a bit flattered.
In the end, she advises him to keep his hands off opioids for a while
Draco just tries to understand. If he understands, he might be able to help. And,
By the time I got back to Draco’s side, I could see that he’d gotten a little worse for wear. He was arguing – vociferously – with Ron about the likelihood of the Arrows winning the League. I cursed myself. Draco was my guest tonight, and I’d let him drink several mugs of that damned strong punch, which was far more potent than its mild taste declared. Draco had hardly eaten a bite either. He had been drinking on an empty stomach.
. They’ll slander you, and they’ll insult you, but they won’t ever believe you. Put it out of your head, and move on with your life. Rape happens in secluded alleyways. It happens in pub toilets. Did Fitzgerald threaten you? Did he put his wand against your throat? Punch you? You wanted it, Draco. You wanted Fitzgerald. You propositioned him publicly, only two days beforehand.”
Drab, dull Potter who’d never pressured him, or had expectations that Draco couldn’t fulfil. In Harry’s embrace, Draco felt precious, and he felt valued. Harry tethered him to the earth.
More as an afterthought he thinks about
Harry swallows. “What did you say?”
“I’m glad you stayed.”
Draco laughed, tears streaming down his face. "I think you mean the world, Potter,” he answered. “And,
“It’s so good,” Harry whispers.  His mind swims in pleasure, flurry with the blithe of sex and coke. He’s hardly able to keep his eyes from fluttering shut, but it’s worth the effort when he sees Draco’s cheeks so full of colour and his eyes gleaming, looking almost affectionate when they travel over Harry’s face.
Draco clears his throat. “What Harry means is that it’s dangerous. You’d be brilliant at it, though, Ted. If you wish to become an Auror, you’ll have everyone’s full support.” After a pause. “Isn’t that right, Potter?”
They fall asleep in each other’s arms after Harry casts a wandless
Friends and friends of friends trail along that night, adding to the pulsing crowd of the Sonos. It would feel like a warehouse if the club was less crowded—there are rusty beams crossing the high ceiling, stairs and platforms are a mere grid of thin metal, making Harry feel excited and as dizzy as on a broom when he’s somewhere up there, watching the crowd while leaning onto the balustrade, the pole cold against his forearms.
We talked about food, and he looked way too excited when he looked through the desserts before we had even ordered our main course. It was the right moment to get a little flirtier. I said, “I know what I’ll have for afters,” letting my gaze travel south.
And, when I glanced back at Draco, he was no longer sitting there. Even though I looked all around the grounds of The Burrow, he was nowhere to be found.
Harry spots him first, trying to avoid eye contact, but as soon as John spots them, dressed in a cheap but neat suit, he comes over to say hello. It feels awkward to be seen by him together with Tarquin, on their way to some show while John is obviously coming from work, most certainly on his way home. It shouldn’t feel awkward, Harry thinks. They haven’t done anything wrong—
” There was a brief silence.
That was, until I felt the heat of my own enchanted coin scorching in my pocket.
Draco looked around in wonder and Harry grinned. The Chimaera’s Den was everything his boyfriend had wanted and more besides. “It’s so beautiful,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand across the table. I’ve no idea how you managed to get the pair of us in, but you did Harry. It’s true what they say about you, love. You really are magic.”
Still with this bright smile on his face, Draco looks at him, and it takes Harry a long moment to realise that there are some stray tears streaming down Draco’s face. Sitting up, Harry feels like doing something about that without knowing exactly what. “Hey, what’s the matter? Are you okay?”
The world spun for a second. Draco felt his stomach lurch. He watched, heart in his mouth, as Cormac waved the article in Ginny’s direction, chuckling as he did so.
It was after they stood there for a long time that Malfoy broke the silence. “
“So you’re saying,” Harry managed, his voice hoarse. “That me, getting hard when I blow you without being touched in return, is a sign of my love?”
, spreading the word about the Saviour and the Death Eater? I’ll be fair. It was inevitable that every last one of our friends would be informed sooner or later. Got to remind myself not to pick up any newspaper or magazine again for the next few months.
All that matters is our plum. Our baby that the Healers and Mediwizards all assure us is growing happily and perfectly, and who is thriving under the new regime of donated magic. Draco is very keen to keep the circumstances of how they were conceived a family secret, and not let on to any of our friends that we’re no longer a couple, and I will absolutely respect his wishes. I’ve stripped Draco of enough pride already.
Harry can’t help but marvel at all the details he’s finding out about Draco. About the way he often shoves Harry’s hands above his head, and how he expects Harry to keep them there when he runs his hands down the sensitive insides of Harry’s arms. The way Draco wants to kiss throughout most of the time they’re in bed together, and how he’s inhumanely quiet and concentrated while his orgasm builds up.
It’s in the middle of the night, and after the better part of a bottle of whisky that Harry Apparates, into the middle of a club, instantaneously overwhelmed with the nausea from the jump, the oppressive, industrial sounds of the music, the crowded dance floor and people shoving at him because of his unexpected presence in between them. He knows that he’s on the verge of a panic attack, struggling to gulp in air, his heart hammering along to the blasting percussions and ear-splitting synths. It’s exactly what he needs, the thrill of danger, even if it’s only an illusion, his bodily functions stretched to their limits with the stress of perceptions and ethanol as the only thing that keeps him on his feet are the undulating masses encompassing him.
But how beautiful it was. Perhaps only because, at the time, Harry couldn’t remember the last time that he was just stood there without a place to be, without a quest to fulfil. Just gazing up into the stars, the all-encompassing nothingness with its drawing pretence of immobility spanning above them, around them once they left the dim-lit cobble streets. He remembers thinking how different the actual sky looked from the charmed ceiling in the Great Hall, naught but a snippet, a mockery of framing something that’s meant to be infinite.
Harry grins, apologetic. “But didn’t he stay with your family?”
“What do you think you will do?” Harry asked me after a short pause, sounding a tad more reserved. “Do you want to keep on working as a rent boy?”
But looks are nothing to go by anyway, now, are they?
cheap, quick delivery . . . But the charms are bollocks. I have no idea why they can’t even get something like a Babbling Curse quite right over there.”
His fingers frozen on his typewriter keys and Draco’s heart skipped a beat. Ginny and Cormac were fighting over the paper’s headline article. A top Muggle footballer had been arrested for the sexual assault of a female fan, but he was denying that there’d ever been an attack. His defence was that it had been consensual. It hadn't been rape, it had been sex, and nothing more.
a bottle of water from the table. “The question is whether there are nights that you’re
The crystal chandelier is dangling from the ceiling. Draco points out how poorly his mum has repaired it, and when Harry looks only closely enough, he finds glassy fragments scattered all over the marble tiled floor and the huge reddish Persian rugs, reflecting the orange light in all the colours of the rainbow as though not even a week had passed after the incident with the Snatchers. The elves were instructed not to go in here, and Draco has never entered after he left the Manor the day of the final battle.
“Come,” Harry says, dragging Draco along. They get onto the settee, and Harry spells the Wireless to play at a low volume. Their kiss is accompanied by some of Draco’s favourite Muggle tunes.
What they really do when Harry comes back from a plundered hotel suite, where the cocaine tray was gently set aside by the cleaner and where his phone had a billion missed calls, is laugh about some Muggle photos that Harry has found in one of the cupboards, and which he’s so eager to show to Draco that he sprints down the stairs and knocks into the other man on the threshold to the atelier. Most of them show Tarquin, Nick, and Judith. On one of them is Aanya, and Harry tells Draco how he’s been a vegetarian for a year or so because of a revelational talk he’s had with her on ecstasy. But when he thinks back at that time, his diet mostly involved whiskey and fast food anyway.
“Is he?”
In a few days the Muggles will be celebrating Bonfire Night. The sky will fill with sparkling lights and dense smoky scent will fill the air. It’s always been a busy week on Diagon. Wizards take the opportunity to set off a few fireworks of their own, not worrying for once that they’ll be breaking the Statute and telling the Muggles about their existence. I’m invited to the Weasleys, as per the usual.
. She’d been there with him, keeping him going and giving him something to live for, even on his darkest days. Harry came up with the name Daisy. It was a small, unassuming name, but as soon as Draco heard Harry suggest it, he knew it was perfect.
And with that comment, Draco abandoned Harry Potter to his dreary, wholesome existence and stood up. Stuart Fitzgerald had just entered the room, and Draco was enchanted by the sight of him. Fitzgerald was six feet of toned, striking wizard, covered with a very snug black t-shirt.
No wizard was safe around Draco – that was the gossip around Diagon. His lips tasted like Amortentia and he seduced men with a single glance. Draco could be spied falling out of all the sexiest bars, and shopping in all the exclusive boutiques. His shadowy past, and the Dark Mark adorning his arm only added to the mystique.
“Yeah?”
So yes, little Cassiopeia Lily Malfoy-Potter. We really weren’t expecting you today.
Had it been any other circumstance under the sun, Draco would have taken his wand and aimed a sweet Jelly-Legs Jinx in Theo’s direction for talking such utter tripe. Unfortunately, Draco couldn’t do a single thing because at that precise moment the Floo bells chimed and Harry tumbled out of Pansy’s fireplace.
Everything was a bit of a blur after that. Draco ran for the door, and by the time I had followed him, my friend had Disapparated. When I got home, I found him locked up in his room, where he remains now.
They climb up a set of stairs and another door leads into the hallway that Harry recognizes from the last time at Malfoy’s place. There is the door to the bathroom and to the guest room and off to the side, there’s another set of stairs that would bring them to Malfoy’s bedroom.
When I lie awake at night, I fancy the idea of telling him everything. If anyone, it’d be him.
That image made me smile, as it was just a tiny bit true.
, of all people, get that. I suppose it was hard after the war, being Harry Potter. And before the war as well, for that matter. I mean- I don’t want to be presumptuous. I probably don’t know half of it,” he catches Harry’s gaze, tone contemplative and his hands gesturing along like he’s holding a lecture. It reminds Harry of one of the lectures he attended with Tarquin and John at their Muggle uni. Part of it also reminds him of one of the huge seminars for the DMLE at the Academy, back in Auror training. “But it hasn’t been . . . It’s not easy
Draco is pregnant.
Perhaps Pansy was wrong. After all, Harry had believed him. Harry had listened, and he hadn’t judged.
“That’s a bit potent for me,” Harry said, tilting his head in the direction of the drink. “I’ve got work first thing tomorrow. Don’t want to go in with a sore head, Draco. Thanks, but no thanks.”
When I left the Wheezes, it was with my friend’s words playing in my head. Sex is a commodity.
Ugh, it didn’t bear thinking about. They’d be betrothed before the end of the year, there was no doubt about that, and then Draco’s fate would be sealed. He’d be the solo solitary singleton left in his friendship group. Sweet Merlin. What was that famous Muggle saying? Always the bridesmaid and never the bride? A heteronormative statement, indisputably, but also one that accurately captured Draco’s experience. Why had he needed to make Harry Potter the subject of his untruth though? He’d turned the secret fantasy of his life into some sort of sick fiction, and now he felt lower than a Flobberworm. Draco had lied and now he was going to make a giant fool of himself.
Harry uses the short silence to interrupt Nick's train of thought and the impending musical rant. "Something else then? I'm not sure if I'm up for a live show anyway."
“It’s the
After several long seconds, Draco turns in his chair to look at Harry without really looking up into his face. He speaks hurriedly, his voice thin. “You see, I suppose that’s true. They’re usually in possession of the heirlooms that can’t simply be mended in your usual corner shop. And they know my name, and therefore either trust me or hate me. It’s- It has nothing to do with
It’s only when they have cleared the table and are seated back in the living room again, that Harry looks at Draco for a long moment. Then he scoots closer and runs a hand through his perfect hair, sweeping the soft tufts back over his head. “I’m sorry that I left last week,” he says. “And that I ruined the mood when we . . .”
“I’ve been keeping you distracted for far too long already, dear,” Mrs Crabbe says, and they discuss the price again, but from what Draco says, Harry gathers that she pays far more than he charged.
“I should have known a flirt like you would play hard to get,” Fitzgerald said, stepping forward. Draco knew he’d drunk his fill, but his brain wouldn’t process,
“Well, I did,” Draco says, squeezing Harry’s hand tightly. He squeezes back. “Let’s go inside, shall we?”
“Let me do it anyway,” I cajoled, digging out a dollop with my fingers. I warmed the potion to room temperature with nonverbal magic, and then I carefully spread it all around, making sure that I didn’t miss a single inch. “I love you and I enjoy taking care of you.”
“That makes us sound like we’re teenagers,” Draco says, his eyebrows arched.
The meeting with Cuffe was a positive one. Draco explained that he wanted to begin his pregnancy leave, and the Editor agreed. He shook Draco’s hand and wished him well.
“Yes, I’m broader where you’re taller,” Harry points out. “Like our pricks.”
Daringly, Draco sneaked a look in Harry’s direction, only to find that the wizard’s face had turned a fabulously vibrant shade of red. He had pushed those dreaded Muggle glasses that were still his trademark onto the top of his head and had brought his hand up to cover his mouth, from whence further reverberations of mirth still continued to escape.
“Won’t I need to listen? I’m sure that should be part of me getting familiar with that thing.”
Harry takes a deep breath, concentrating on the way his chest deflates with his exhale. He pulls Draco closer. “I’m sorry.”
Draco isn’t here right now. He has left Grimmauld for several hours; gone to meet that Muggle chap – Richard, or Ralph, whatever he is called – who has fallen so deeply in lust with Draco’s belly. The man has no clue that the bump is actually real but he enjoys the fantasy of it nevertheless. I wish – selfishly,
“That’s my grandfather, right?” Harry asks, excited to finally recognise a name. “Like- no
“Oh, well,” Draco answered. He walked around the edge of Harry’s desk and pressed a kiss into Harry’s hair. “If the name Hermione Granger isn’t enough to open the damned restaurant's books, then nothing will. I’m sure that their Caramelised Bedugul Cauliflower will be every bit as delicious on our second anniversary. And yes, before you say anything, I had chosen what I was going to order. You know how important it is to be prepared.” Standing up, Draco straightened his robes decisively. “I’d better get back to work. I’ve a meeting with Robards. He’s briefing me about the Knockturn dueling case. Love you.” Making for the exit, Draco looked back with a smile. “See you at home.”
“That’s the last photograph we ever had taken,” Draco said, picking it up and examining it briefly. “It was a summer dinner party. Mother and Father were in good form and getting on for once in their lives. I’d come top of house for Slytherin during the preceding year and Snape had sent a very pleasant letter home. My life – my happiness - felt indestructible. I couldn’t imagine how things would ever change. You, of course, know better than anybody how false such feelings were. Within months everything changed. Father’s conviction. He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.” Draco sighed, and placed the picture back on the bedside table. “Everything that I’d ever known vanished in the blink of an eye.”
Harry has no idea what’s going on. He hardly has a clue what exactly happened that night in the club, but he believes every word Tarquin says.
“Good afternoon, madam. I’m Unspeakable Malfoy, and-“ he stops himself from introducing Potter to the two people that brought him up- “and the Ministry of Magic have sent us in order to investigate an occurrence of magical singularity. Magical energy that dissociated from somewhere it didn’t belong.” He adds, “Split-off magic, if you like.”
says. A big heart, and you’re generous and clement with anyone but yourself.”
She lights a cigarette and offers Harry one.
“What do you think happened that night at the club?” Draco asks.
the photographs off the walls and blow all the crockery to smithereens. That rude, obnoxious Mediwizard at St Mungo's – I’ve a good mind to Floo back now and give him a piece of my mind. I’m not going to; I’d likely give him a piece of my fist too – was staggeringly rude to Draco. He won’t go back there and even if he was willing, I wouldn’t allow it.
to a low glow in the lounge.
It’s Bonfire Night –
“Harry,” she gasps, and then she seems to compose herself with a smile, her shoulders a bit tense. Before Harry can say anything, she is in his space and puts her arms around him. “Ron will probably be here in a few, he’s working, but- Oh Harry . . .”
As it turned out, Harry’s often restless hands are very able to be still and precise when he only puts his mind to it. The moment the tip of the brush touches the wood, Harry’s fingers go very still and his breathing slows down. He’s enlarged the chair he’s usually sits in for the task so that he can draw up his legs on the seat and hold the little figurine on his knee while he colours the wine-red stripes on the rosy dress the young lady is wearing. She surely would preen if Harry magicked her into life right now; whenever she dances, she makes sure to swirl her dress around like it’s the most precious thing in the world. She is a true model.
But back to this morning. Potter had his hands on my belly, telling me about the idea to go to Diagon by bus after his work together for some more shopping. Now that I can’t Floo or Apparate anymore, it’s quite a nuisance to get anywhere. Harry tries very hard in asking his permission for everything now. He wouldn’t buy a plushie without asking me whether I liked it too.
When he sits back up to meet Draco’s gaze, he finds an unguarded look on the man’s face, finds lips slightly parted, eyes watching Harry with disbelieving awe.
“I frankly have no fucking clue,” Harry replies, amused. He pierces his fork through a few leafy remnants of his salad, shoving them in his mouth together with some bread.
When they are in bed that night, Harry is wide-awake with his lips on Draco’s and his hand in his own pants. He’s more than a little aroused, but his penis doesn’t feel like catching up on that, which is not only frustrating but also humiliating under Draco’s darkened eyes and parted, sensual lips.
“After?” Harry prompts after a few seconds.
Malfoy looks surprised, but his eyes crinkle with amusement as he speaks. “Hm? Oh, yes, mending. You didn't know? What did we even talk about last time?”
One hand on Harry’s arm, the other in the thin stem of his wine glass, Draco sips the last remnants of the ruby liquid, leaving Harry longing for another sip of his long-drained serve or Draco’s lips or both.
Draco said he couldn’t imagine how such a show would be like but that he'd like to see a metal gig with Harry. They listened to Metallica’s Black Album next, one of the harsher things in Draco’s spectrum. It filled Harry with so much nostalgia for shows and the constant playing of metal records that Harry spent an hour catching up with Nick on the phone.
The whiskey is smooth and gentle after the sharp inhale of a cigarette, and it makes him long for the taste and feel of a stranger’s tongue in his mouth. With dry, unblinking eyes he looks against the crowd in the club, against the smoke, and stench, against old-timey music and all the movement, he himself caught in a stupor.
“I've gotten through life without a chaperone so far,” Harry mutters. He has hardly any recollection of the past day . . . perhaps the last two days . . . But he certainly can’t imagine a scenario in which he needed rescuing by Draco sodding Malfoy. He’s well behaved on drugs. The memory loss must have been due to- Harry can’t really remember. Downers and alcohol sometimes had weird interactions.
“How’d you know?” Harry asks.
When I got him out of his pants, I told him that he was huge. Because he was at least seven inches. Good thing, I’m in practice, I suppose.
. Thank you for . . . the help?” Harry remembers the diagnostic charm and doesn’t find any better explanation for what has happened here. “And about the, erm, whatever your spell said—just don’t worry. It’s just a thing Muggles take to, well,
“You should do it,” Harry said when I questioned the lack of such a thing, recalling the ignorance of that first Mediwizard I had seen in St Mungo’s in February. “You’d be a brilliant sex coach or whatever it is that they do exactly.”
, there’s nothing in this world he wishes for more deeply right now. Nothing. He won’t want to win this drawn-out court fight for the Manor, he won’t want his probation to end early, and, by Hecate, he doesn’t even care if Father will ever be released or if Mother will ever speak again if it only means for Harry to feel better.
Muggle tests work excellently. Almost as superb as my apt charmwork. I’m 10 weeks pregnant.
And that was that, really. Draco has a clever way of convincing me to do things, and I felt a wave of very Gryffindor impulsiveness run through me. Before my brain had even made a decision, my agreement was flying out of my mouth. A MoonStar, made specifically for a smaller child, enchanted with safety spells that would impede Teddy from flying too high, falling off or going too fast. It’d be the safest broomstick available, and the only one on the planet that I could trust my godson to ride, because I had designed it and made it myself.
Harry huffs a laugh, eyes catching Draco’s when he looks up from his food. They’re both smiling when their gazes meet.
It takes Harry a long moment to understand what Malfoy is saying. “Oh, oh! That wasn’t them.” He gives a laugh at the thought. “We don’t hang out as much as we used to.”
Harry can’t help but smile at the way Draco bristles and keeps on verbally cursing the metal.
That offer certainly got my attention. I wanted to ask if Draco was sure, but then I remembered the advice that I’d been given.
It’s a short meeting, filled with
“You needn’t be embarrassed, Harry. And relationships to people you know or don’t know—it doesn’t even matter, they can all be too darn complicated to explain anything. If I had known that you had no idea about any of your ancestors . . .” Draco lapses into silence. His eyes rest on Harry, heavy-lidded with something that might be understanding or affection. “You've had it rather rough in your life.”
A fission of magic washes over Harry, and then Draco is on top of him, between his thighs, and Harry can’t keep his hands off his narrow torso.
It’s creepy how Harry can’t read Malfoy’s sodding expression. “It’s not like you know me,” Harry points out, starting to feel annoyed. Malfoy just shrugs in response. Harry thinks about a good way to leave, wherever he was, without being completely impolite.
his glamour the moment he closes the door behind him, and when Draco, without any metal protective wear this time, steps through the archway into the small space behind the till, there’s a delighted gleam to his eyes and to the way he says, “Potter.” Guilt strikes Harry upon being greeted so amiably, but he tries to pay no attention to the feeling while Draco takes a  minute to finish something in his workshop.
“Advertising for example.”
“We’re agreeable because we
“There’s something I want to try—have wanted to try for a while now. But I just didn’t know . . . how to say it.” He kneaded Harry’s fingers with both his hands, eyes glimpsing up at Harry several times while he spoke. “I-“ he started, but it took a minute before Draco said what he wanted to say. “I think I miss having sex. And even more important, I want to have sex
“Harry,” Draco mumbles, quiet and cautious.
Harry blinks while his mind is busy catching up. He reaches for his wand under his pillow, only to grapple into soft, freshly laundered sheets and firm, ergonomic mattress.
Harry isn’t sure whether he could abide having Teddy work as an Auror, but he too wonders whether said anything wrong or spoke too harshly. And when he thinks about it, he wonders how Hermione can stay in the Ministry with everything going on. If things are still as infuriatingly intricate and unproductive and just full of red-tape as they always used to be . . . It’s easier to shut these thoughts out with Draco’s body heat against his skin.
The two of them were taking things slowly, but every day Draco found himself falling for Harry just a little bit more. There hadn’t been any love confessions yet or any epic romantic gestures, but such things weren’t very easy with a new-born taking up all their energy and time.
There was a mortified silence around the table and Draco felt a perverse urge to laugh. Pansy and he had done some really very wicked things together during the course of their friendship. They’d swapped Blaise Zabini’s shampoo so that his hair had turned blue. They’d stolen Daphne’s diary and ransomed it back to her for sweets and homework. Bloody hell, but it’d even been Pansy’s idea to make those foul
“Nott, you uncouth arse!” Draco gasped, wishing the ground would open up and suck him beneath the surface. “You can’t just come out with statements like that!”
Teddy clears his throat. Harry can’t help a little smirk when he watches Teddy straighten his worn tee-shirt in a mirror hanging in the shop. “You don’t know her.”
“May I,” Harry asked with a smile, and Draco wiped a tear from the corner of his eye, nodded, and let Harry rest his head on his chest.
When we were still in his office, smiling at the picture we got of our perfect baby, I fibbed, “Another mark you leave on me, Potter. Curse scars, stretch marks, surgical scars – I must hope you’re quite done now.”
to join the Aurors, your magical abilities will be very complimentary.”
“When you leave for the Charms Institute in Leeds.”
Draco listened to everything very calmly, just like always. “I’m sorry,” he said then, “for bringing up these memories. But if walking away didn’t help, then maybe you could try to talk about some of the stuff you’ve been through. Just try—that’s all I ask.”
“Thank you, ma’am.”
Draco only cocks an eyebrow at him.
A sliding door leads him onto the balcony, which is actually a rooftop terrace, sleek stone tiles surrounding a pool and a bar. But that’s just an afterthought because Harry is greeted with soothing darkness and fresh air. It’s cold, but that’s a thousand times better than the madness of the hotel room.
, the guy coughs and retches until a grape pops out of his mouth, and he starts gulping for air. Harry gets off him to give him some room to breathe—an unfruitful attempt of decency because half a dozen people clap both the bloke who almost choked to his death and Harry on their backs, applauding and laughing too loudly after the shock.
Draco had an afternoon date with Kayden, one of his regulars, and I had a long day at Phoenix to endure before we could spend our evening together. I’d already planned out our dinner of pasta and sun-dried tomatoes, and I was enthusiastic about making something that I knew my lover would enjoy for our one-month anniversary.
He’ll pretend that nothing happened because he’s a good-natured gentleman. Perhaps he’ll tell Ronald and Hermione about the kiss, but I can live with that. They’re too polite to use that knowledge against me, all three of them.
Harry feels an odd ache in his chest as if everything up from his heart is suddenly too tight to contain his pumping heart and all these tendons, and muscles, and thoughts. He fists the back of Tarquin’s posh shirt, pulling him closer. He lies on top on Harry, between his legs, on the settee in Harry’s flat—
“Draco, don’t.”
Harry had left when Draco had asked him to, even though he obviously hadn’t wanted to. Harry had kept his distance, and he hadn’t touched Draco after he’d promised not to. Harry had listened to him, and respected his boundaries and that was more than anybody else in his life had done. Harry had deferred to his wishes.
so that the Muggles sat around them wouldn’t overhear. “What’s happened? You look awful, Draco, like you’ve seen a ghost! It isn’t the baby, is it? Are you in pain? Talk to me,” he said, voice urgent. “Let me help you.”
With a groan, he goes back inside the suite, finding his wand and starting to detect and retrieve the remnants of poisonous and addictive substances from his blood. He sits on the soft settee in the bedroom, not bothering to hide his magic when the few souls surrounding him are still or already too high and drunk to question a half-naked man waving a stick of wood at his arm.
Do Muggle pregnancy tests work?
“No more than ten minutes,” Draco answered. “My back was killing me, and I was having all sorts of odd dreams, so I got up and went for a pee. The moment I stood up I had a contraction… I dived in here to catch my breath, and work out if it was real - and
Every other thought left Draco’s head. He made his way over to Fitzgerald, hoping his face didn’t give away how entirely eager he was about this encounter.
“Oh, so it’s
My stupid hands moved on their own as I felt up his chest, and then I couldn’t resist. I leant in and kissed these impossibly plush lips. And if one of my last sober brain cells hadn’t extracted me from that situation… I don’t even know what would have happened. Probably, I would have tried to get into his bed. I would have made a complete fool of myself.
” Malfoy spit out Harry’s name like an insult, eyes twisted with hatred that, Harry now understands, was never directed at him. With a stuck-up nose and appraising eyes, voice as caustic as bile, Malfoy drawled, “
“No,” Draco says. He would have left it at that, but his talking tunes out the memories, replaces them with worried, stupid Muggle questions. “Not if we extract it. It will be used for research because it happens very rarely.”
Wizarding England was a small, tight-knit place, but somehow the story of Draco’s visit to the DMLE, and Fitzgerald’s subsequent interview with them didn’t make it into the newspapers. Draco supposed that was because there was nothing to tell. There hadn’t been an arrest, and the only time he saw Fitzgerald’s name, it was in the Quidditch columns.
“Because you like to bottom?”
Perplexed to be addressed, Harry doesn’t know what to say.
John starts explaining, telling him that they can figure out how Harry could get home on the TfL website, whatever that’s supposed to mean. But it turns out to be the Tube map, only better and somehow on his computer. Harry tries hard not to ask any weird questions about it. “Will we stay in touch?” John asks, locking his eyes on Harry’s. At that moment beanie-bloke enters the kitchen with only his pants on.
“Merlin, yes, please.”
That’s probably why I felt the need to take over. I stopped Harry after a minute to return the favour. If my imagination about what Potter is like in bed had been right on one thing, it’s that he’s not quiet. Much more careful than I thought, but he lets you know what he enjoys. I took my sweet time with him. I licked the shell of his ears and kissed his neck, his pecs that I always ogle from afar. I licked and sucked his prick, never stopping to use my hands to travel over his skin, roll his balls. Circe, his body is just as perfect as the person that it harbours. He’s not bulky and not too slender either. But his pecs and the dark hair on his chest and his legs are the epitome of masculinity. His prick is a lovely red, sturdy, and it’s curved to the left. Entirely beautiful.
Besides, Draco hadn’t come here to get blotto. He wanted to enjoy the main event, rather than pass out halfway through. He turned his body so that it was facing Fitzgerald’s, and he took the bottle from his hand. “I think,” Draco said, “that there are better things you could be doing with your lips.”
Harry dropped his head, but thankfully he didn’t answer. Pansy was the next to speak. “But why did you lie?” she asked, baffled. “And then to partake in this
Draco stood up, and he smoothed the material of his shirt before he took a few shaky steps towards the double doors. He clutched my hand even tightly, as if he was worried that I’d disappear and leave him to face his appointment alone.
close to suggesting a trip that day. You seemed so . . . I don’t even know. You were saying a bunch of things that sounded like you were a little out of it. Just a tad nuts. And I sort of spiralled with you. You always do that, you selfish prick.” Draco huffs a laugh and takes a sip of red wine right from the bottle, fond eyes on Harry. “Always make me follow you down these mad roads where your mind leads.”
Draco didn’t lower the wands, but he nodded his permission.
, yes.”
Harry turned in his seat to face him. “Draco?” Harry asked, his face a picture of puzzlement, “what are you doing?”
“It’s edgy. Just like drinking from the bottle. And also, it’s just the way you spend your first evening after moving house, don’t you think?”
Harry shrugs, but then he feels guilty. It’s not like he doesn’t care. Quite the opposite. He cares very much. “Sorry, yes. Yes, please.”
Harry puts the music box down and closes the lid, before he saunters over to Draco, and hugs him unnecessarily forcefully around his middle, sending him off balance into something that might be a dance or a tussle. “I just can’t resist you,” he whispers against Draco’s neck, tongue dipping out to lick below Draco’s ear where he’s ticklish enough to try and shove Harry off unsuccessfully. When Harry manages to take his lips from Draco’s, the harp has long ceased playing.
The sun must’ve set. The half-burnt candles on the coffee table are painting the room in warm oranges and thick shadows. It’s too dark for the ordinary Muggle lighting that Harry is used to, but it almost feels romantic.
“He’s a prude,” Tarquin says with a crafty grin, taking his shorter friend into a headlock. Harry likes how affectionate their tussle looks, how friendly and familiar. He feels that now that they meet again, Harry is happy to recognise someone, reconnect. It feels good, and for a moment, he feels as though he’s a part of them. When John is released, he doesn’t look as cross anymore, his head red and beaming with laughter.
Truthfully, Harry shook his head. “I mean- we can switch. We can try anything that we both feel up for. But when I thought about sleeping with you, I fantasised about being in your capable hands. I feel very safe with you. Like there’s nothing I would need to be ashamed of.”
“I wasn’t sure that I wanted to be a dad,” Draco admitted, placing his hand on his small bump, “or that they’d fit in with my lifestyle, but seeing them, and hearing them… I know that I want this.”
Thinking that it’s unwise to ask for Draco Malfoy, but unsure what he’s looking for, Harry roams the street, trying to peek into shop windows as well as the ones above the businesses, reading signs and furtively glimpsing at the few wixen passing by, all clad in robes, looking much less hectic than their London counterparts. Harry passes tailors and corner shops, a crimson-bricked pub named The Red Lion and an old-fashioned tea room called The Green Snake.
Would he shout and swear, or worse, use his fists? A tremor of fright coiled down his spine with that idea. Perhaps Harry would use his wand instead. They would be the perfect bloody filling for the sandwich of misery that he’d served himself up as a snack.
if you ask me.”
, a few loose scrolls of parchment and a short-feathered quill that functions as the cap to a small ink bottle.
Harry gives a smile, straining his neck to give Draco a better angle. “I just pondered whether the Weasleys are going to approve of the food we prepared.”
"Why would you think that?" I asked him, moving my arm a little on the backrest to touch his back. I love how he always leans into my touch.
Nick comes back into the living room, smiling about something without looking at them. Despite himself, Harry takes a step away from Tarquin, instantly feeling ridiculous.
Rolling his shoulders and clearing his throat again, Malfoy unsuccessfully tries to disguise that he jumped upon hearing his name. “Yes. This, however, was Adelia Potter’s phoenix perch, and I found it in the Manor. I wondered what this curious thing might be, and so I decided to repair the perch and mend the charms attached. You see, the magic was fading, and the copper had begun to oxidate. Well, it is a good century—no, a few decades older than that, actually—so I didn’t mean to say that the charms were anything less than expertly applied and made perfectly durable, they just aren’t meant to-“
“I want to go with you,” Harry says before he knows it for a fact. “I’m not sure if . . . how . . .” He’s at a loss of words. Even the idea of facing Andromeda brings feelings of shame and guilt, feelings which he just doesn’t know how to explain. But what he knows is that he wants to do this for Draco, with Draco.
Draco would be entirely, completely humiliated, and I’d feel the sharp end of his wand.

Pain had seared his chest and he’d found himself on his knees, panting and gasping. It had been the oddest, most sickening experience. After hours had passed, Draco had Vanished the disgusting rag with a swipe of his wand. He didn't want to touch the filthy thing with his hands. The shirt was a reminder of Fitzgerald, and the fewer of those there were in the world, the better.
“You should see your cousin,” Harry said in his modest, shy manner when Teddy couldn’t get out of his amazement at his godfather's display. “He cuts through the turns like the devil himself. I have never seen a flyer swifter than him.”
“Happened right after the war,” he says, levelled. “I moved to France for a while and after living about half a year with insomnia and migraines as intense as though my brains were
“Mine is yours,” Harry replies automatically. His familiar fingers slip under the hem of my trousers, playing with the straps of the sock garters that—I know too well—Harry can never get enough of. “Even if I did change my mind, it’d be my fault completely. I offered it to you, now, didn’t I?”
"And will you realise that by staying or by leaving?"
Harry sighed. “It’s alright. Just so much bureaucracy. I don’t want to complain, love. It’s just a couple of days' work, and then we’ll have the hearing in the courtroom and that will put an end to all this misery. Finally.”
Harry feels like he’s being unfair. Hermione and Ron have done
Teddy hums in response. “You might . . . you might not. Who knows.”
Everything.
I set to work. My first choice was Brian, but he was covered in freckles. I clicked off his profile. Freckles remind me of Weasleys, so I knew I’d never be able to relax. My second choice was a man called Eric. He was dark haired, but a little too muscular for my taste. He was altogether too much like the bodybuilders down at the gym that I avoid like Spattergroit. Clicking off Eric, I scrolled downward.
The two of us are at Shell Cottage at the moment, in the company of Bill and Fleur. I saw Bill three days ago while I was visiting Arthur, and Ron’s older brother was there visiting. He insisted that I bring Draco down for a long weekend.
We collapsed next to each other in the large bed then, both of us sticky and sweaty, and not bothering with any Cleaning Charms that would chase away the scent of sex and shared heat on this cold winter afternoon.
“Can I Side-Along you home?” Harry asked. “You look awful, Draco. I won’t pry, or push you into saying anything you don’t want to, but I’m worried about you. Just humour me, please?”
It’s very much the first beautiful day after all that dreadful rain on the Easter weekend. Poor Teddy had to stay inside with us all day. But the boy likes to draw, so he didn’t have to listen too much to all the lame adult topics we discussed.
That was when Draco really lost his temper. He stood up and seized the plate of pasta that had been sitting waiting for his return and dashed it against the wall beside him. The crockery smashed into a dozen pieces and a dark red smear stained the wallpaper.
hers and Teddy’s coats. “A nap will be just the thing to settle your stomach.”
Raising his palms in a gesture of defeat, Draco turned to Harry. “So stop acting now, would you? Stop pretending to court my friends and stop holding my hand. Stop pretending that you’d
Draco felt like there was a bezoar stone in his throat. He wound his wand though his fingers, a stim he’d had forever. He tried to work out what he wanted to say. “I’m not courting Fitzgerald,” he managed eventually, astonished that his lips could form the word. “He’s put me off men for life, Parks.” Draco squeezed the handle of his wand, willing himself not to get upset. Weeping like a witch wouldn’t help him to be taken seriously. “That night, after Wood’s party… I went back to his place.”
When Harry Apparates back home, he makes his way downstairs towards the atelier, giddy with excitement that he can’t wait to share with Draco because his appointment is over and it wasn’t nearly as bad as he had thought. But on the bottom of the staircase, hand on the handle of the door, he hears Draco’s voice and stops dead in his tracks because it means there’s a customer.
“Is she related to . . . you know . . .”
Draco was leaning on the doorframe, and I found that I could scarcely pull my gaze away. He was more handsome than I’d ever seen him. His hair was thicker, more lustrous and longer than ever. Draco had pulled it back into a loose bun, but a couple of soft strands had escaped. I had to clasp the wood of my workbench to stop myself from tucking them behind Draco’s ears. Despite the chilly London day, Draco’s skin looked soft. I swallowed and averted my eyes, worried that I’d be caught staring. The last thing in the world that I wanted was for Draco to leave again.
Wrackspurts fluttered in Draco’s chest as he peered at his reflection. His cheeks were pinker than he’d have liked but there was nothing to be done about that, and a quick flick of his wand set his hair straight where it was curling a little at his nape. He charmed his teeth clean and straightened out the small crumples from his shirt. Tonight was shaping up to be everything he’d hoped it would be.
“Even if I wasn’t, it’s a little late to change my mind,” Draco answered, his laugh turning into a scowl as he had another contraction. “I really think we need to go,” he managed afterwards, as we stepped into the cool spring London night. “That one hurt much more than the others.”
“Indeed, phoenixes. They successfully bred a phoenix. Which is quite rare and- Apologies, you surely know that; you’re not an imbecile. I didn’t mean to be-“ Malfoy clears his throat. “Well, actually-
, not someone with just a drunken, often enough absolutely mental
I had this little hope that my pregnancy would miraculously turn out fine, and that the circumstances that led me directly under Potter’s roof established enough chances that ultimately led to the two of us falling for each other. And I know how much Potter adores children. If it’s not the pregnancy kink, it’s certainly his wish for a family with children as a gay man that would have made me a very reasonable choice to stay with. I suppose that’s a chance Harry was happy enough to take, even if it meant being with the tosser who poisoned his best friend, and whose father wanted him dead and whose aunt tortured his other best friend.
“A sense of responsibility.”
And Harry laughs with them, incredulous and oddly happy to be here and to be alive with his arm around Draco’s waist and Draco’s warm palm on his thigh; with Andromeda who’s not familiar but not quite a stranger, but who he believes might become family again.
“When we had a sleep-over, we used to sneak downstairs that way,” Draco says, and it’s the first time he speaks a bit slower and smiles. “Greg was always very keen on midnight snacks. And I- Well, you know me, Harry. I couldn’t ever resist a challenge.”
Several minutes pass with deliberately controlled breathing and too-warm palms on thighs. No words, no hexes. The earlier paranoia wore off. Malfoy didn’t appear to be any sort of threat despite his reluctance to explain what the fuck is going on. But then, Harry didn’t ask, so-
On their way up the stairs, Harry goes through his usual pre-sex questions, asking whether Draco has any preferences as in being a top-or-bottom-only kind of guy, whether he has lube somewhere, and usually, Harry is too turned on and simultaneously high off his face to care about protection, but he tells Draco that he had several partners lately, and that they should definitely use a condom. “We don’t need Muggle condoms. I’m an expert at charms, Potter,” is Draco’s comment on that.
Draco rolled his eyes at me, his cheeks pink. “It’s hardly fair,” he groused in my direction, “I’ve rubbed a skin hydration potion all over myself, long before I began to show. I’ve drank plenty of water and taken excellent care of myself. I suppose that there’ll be many more where that came from before the plum arrives. My torso will be perfectly
Maybe their encounter could still be saved.
It’s good that I’m seeing so many clients this and next week with Christmas just around the corner. If the last few years are anything to go by, I’ll be on quite a dry stretch during the next one or two months. Too bad most of my clients either save their money for presents or are suddenly the perfectly domestic husbands and dads once the shops bring out their Advent décor. Or that’s what I suppose is the reason why December is always so unprofitable.
Harry laughs at that, not sure what he means or what he is meant to say. His throat feels raw with the cold air and alcohol. “I’m certainly not,” he emphasises. For a wonderful moment, he feels something unfamiliar. He could be

has to say about that.”
He only lived ten minutes away, and he laughed loudly when he answered the Firecall. “Looks like I’ve won three Galleons from Asti,” Blaise said,
“Don’t worry, she’ll come here and get it herself. I’m not going to send your precious, restored antique via owl.”
His face – always lean – looked emaciated. His skin was sallow, and there were purplish shadows underneath his eyes. Draco is usually very well turned out, but today he was wearing a loose wool coat and a long grey scarf, twisted twice around his neck. I’m quite an oblivious person usually, but even I could tell that Draco had dressed specially so as not to attract attention.
There’s too much wet in his mouth all of a sudden and a lump that makes his breath hitch. Draco is already next to him when Harry understands that he’s about to cry, startled by the sob that escapes his mouth. And with the first tears welling and overflowing, a stream of long-repressed thoughts effervesces from his lips, chaotic and desperate to be said out loud.
It was late on a Monday afternoon, and Draco was at the Prophet offices and hastily typing up an article about a case he’d watched conclude earlier that day.
Draco looks amused. “
Merlin, but the two Quidditch journalists disagreed on everything under the sun. Today’s row was over a copy of a non-magical newspaper, called the
“Oh, don’t be ridiculous, Potter.” Draco smiles. “I’m in hopes that you’re planning on making up for that later.” Their smirks find one another for a playful peck that ends much too quickly. With their faces so close to one another, both their smiles seem to fade within a breath. Draco’s eyes look like molten lead in the flickering candlelight, intense and dark. “Or perhaps now,” he says, his voice so low that Harry’s balls tighten in direct response.
Harry shakes his head and nods right after, feeling silly. “I haven’t been. To a, er, bonfire.”
Draco snorted at my answer. “That's a stretch mark singular,” he replied. “The plum has a few more weeks of growing still to do. I’ll be covered in these bloody things before I’m finished. A badge of pride sounds like the romantic twaddle that
“What does it matter? It’s he-said-she-said and I’ll bet there’s not a smidgen of proof.” Cormac stood up. “Come on. Let’s go across to The Leaky. Fancy a pint?”
They run into John.
An irrational fear was bouncing around my belly. What if, the moment that Draco saw me, he guessed the truth about James Evans? What if I gave myself away with a slip of the tongue, or some unknown gesture?
Harry pulls Draco close, emitting a huffed laugh in the other wizard. He kisses his chest, his hips, everywhere he can reach; nudging Draco’s shirt up until he can put his lips on the soft skin of Draco’s abdomen. Draco is laughing, his hand in Harry’s hair, pushing him closer. “You ought to stop or you’ll make me hard,” he says, twitching at all the ticklish parts Harry reaches.
"Now, that sounds like something you would do," Draco says.
“Not without complaining,” Harry says, teasing, and somehow feeling happy to have a moment alone together. They rather tussle instead of talking. Everything that needs to be said is communicated by mischievous glances, quirked mouth corners, and lingering touches.
Ears hungry for Draco’s words, eyes increasingly hungry for his lips, Harry stretches out his arm on the backrest of the settee, in-accidentally grazing Draco’s shoulder. He doesn’t lean away.
Harry’s throat constricts painfully as he tries to swallow. “I’m not sure.”
If things could continue just the way they are at the moment, that would be terrific. The days I like best are seeing clients in the daytime and meeting up for a soiree with Pansy and Blaise in the night. Perhaps I wouldn’t complain about visiting Aunty and my cousin every other weekend. And the other weekends, I’ll gladly have one of these dreadful pints they serve at the Leaky with Harry and his lot. Which will mean no Potter-free weekends for me. He’s been chewing my ear off about the new series of kid’s brooms they have in his shop at the Phoenix brooms. I’m quite certain that he’ll have bought one for Teddy by the weekend. And with the autumn storms picking up this week, Aunty will completely hate the idea. Time to make myself her favourite relation.
In the morning Draco looked at Harry’s mess of untidy hair on the pillow beside him, and he’d felt a wave of genuine affection. Draco hadn’t slept over – and just
, and I pretended that they weren’t.”
Harry squirmed and shuddered underneath me as I talked to him, voice low and needy. His hands were at my hips, a pleading pressure for me to act upon my words, and I had no intentions of leaving him in the lurch. I squeezed some more lube on his penis, blindly smeared some on mine as well. Then I sank down on his cock, pleased that I managed to guide him inside of me rather expertly.
Over dinner, Harry feels bad for being pensive all day. He feels like he needs to- no, he
be that.
“You mean that?”
My beliefs were vindicated when James actually went down on his knees to rub his face over the bulge in my pants and tugged the fabric off to watch my prick spring free on eye-level.
. That’s all he needs to see to spur on his attentions and flirt more forwardly once they all decide to go back to Harry’s flat.
Bitterness and distress danced though Draco as he opened his fridge and began to indiscriminately throw items onto a tray. What a laughingstock he’d made of himself! He could only pray that Harry was really the all-round good egg his reputation deemed him to be. Otherwise, the entirety of London would be laughing at his expense.
They have talked about every subject under the sun, Draco and he, but what they did not mention was the fact that Harry masturbated in the shower. He’d been caught at least twice already, which was hardly a miracle considering the familiarity they'd quickly found together. They shared their thoughts, their mugs, and with the number of wipes they needed for little Daisy's adventurous eating habits—Merlin, they most certainly had shared used tissues, and Harry didn’t care one iota whether Pansy found that disgusting. With a baby in the house, it was simply one of these things that changed because it was practical and easy.
Astoundingly, Draco doesn’t seem to be one to hold grudges—not for Harry’s sudden departure the last time they saw each other and not the time before that, even though Draco mentions, repeatedly, how he had to have the Wards fixed after Harry ripped a hole in them with his Apparition. They manage to talk about a few inconsequential things, the both of them amazed by the warm weather today that isn't at all October-like, then they laugh because they just engaged in small talk about the weather. But the conversation leads them to sit outside in Draco’s back garden rather than in the kitchen.
You know what, I’m going to take a little break for the rest of my lunch break and nip into Flourish and Blotts. I could sit here, ruminating on this for the rest of time, and I still wouldn’t be anywhere closer getting any answers.
Bloody hell, but I don’t know what to do for the best. All I do know is I want to be there for Draco. I want to be the other father to his child. I’ve always loved kids – I love Teddy like he’s my own – and I’m ready for this. I have a big house, a career that doesn’t take up every hour Merlin sends, and my heart is brimful of love. Fuck, even if the baby isn’t mine, I’ll love them anyway. We could be a family, couldn’t we, Draco, myself and our little one? Even though I didn’t have a dad of my own, I still think I could do a good job.
. All of you. There’s nothing you could change about that."
The feeling of being considerate with Draco vanishes when Draco’s eyebrows rise further towards the line of his swept-back hairline which Harry can’t stop carding his fingers through. Draco’s eyes crinkle with amusement. “My
I haven’t brought the subject up with him though. If I asked Draco why he kissed me, then I’d have to ask why he ran away from me as well. He’d definitely had a little too much to drink, but he still seemed sensible enough of his actions. Besides which, I swear I wouldn’t have presumed consent. Just because I know what Draco does for a living doesn’t mean I believe he owes me kisses. But then, perhaps that is me being pejorative? Even if Draco is a sex worker, he had the right to kiss whomever he likes.
Between kisses and words of adoration, they lost their clothes and their inhibitions. When Harry asked whether they should kill the lights, Draco seemed outraged at the idea, but then he asked Harry tenderly if he was okay with the lights staying on. “Want to see you,” Draco muttered, eyes on Harry’s chest and his hands buried in Harry’s hair.
-grandmother? No, great-great-great-
Merlin, but I don’t trust St Mungo’s. No Malfoy has set foot in that hospital since Grandfather Abraxas had caught the Dragon Pox while he was a patient. Father used to ramble how only second-class-wizards were dependent on the care of public health. Well, sometimes I’m naught but a slave to his old-fashioned opinions. I want the best treatment, but I can only get what I can afford, right?
“Why?”
“May I?” he said, and when Harry nodded, Draco stepped into the shower, fully clothed.
“I’m sorry,” Hermione says, eyes flickering between the hands in her lap and Harry’s eyes. “That’s probably a lot to take in.” Harry says that that’s alright, that he wants to get up to date with everything. He’s glad that she doesn’t force him to talk much about what he’s been up to.
Afterwards, the two of us have made a tradition of laying together, talking about everything and nothing and just feeling at peace.
Harry cooked. He didn’t touch. He never came in for surprise hugs, or tried to kiss Draco goodnight. That was good. That was refreshing.
"Only if you’re a Gryffindor," I retorted with a snort.
“Bloody hell,” Harry said, casting a wandless
Draco’s eyes go blissfully vacant for a second before he focuses on Harry with a novel kind of desperate need that wasn’t there before. “Do it,” he says urgently. “Please.”
They are scared, these two Muggles. They worry about their safety and about the real intentions of those two freaks.
“Do you think it looks weird? A pregnant bloke?” I asked him, voice low.
“Fear not," Draco says to the red-faced man. “I won’t deign to draw my wand on you. But
“That’s what I’m fucking talking about,” Tarquin exclaims, bright with laughter and energy, his voice and steps resounding on the quiet streets. “We’re staying up all night, Pots. You and I.”
Gods, but I don’t have any idea what I was playing at. Part of me had the absurd idea of booking as James, but then turning up as myself before confessing all. I’m not a complete fool though.
now, is it?” Theo crowed, tossing aside his
Harry flips away the end of his cigarette and chugs the last of his beer, feeling the grumble of his empty stomach. Behind him, the others are more or less passed out, only Tarquin is still up, sitting on the ground, leant over a shallow table where he's frantically scribbling away in his black notebook. He only notices Harry when he reaches for his cup of coffee with trembling fingers, only to find it empty, and taking a bewildered look into the cup and then through the room. His eyes are red-rimmed, and his hair stands in odd directions. There's a bruise blooming on his forehead, and Harry wonders when and how that got there.
and has this Muggle painting, and it just seems so unlikely anyway.
He had a definite and very fixed plan of how he was going to spend the rest of his Sunday. Draco intended to eat his body weight in Salt ‘n’ Vinegar crisps, Chocolate Frogs and Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream and cry whilst pretending to watch films on his Muggle television. The whole endeavour would ruin his complexion and make him feel as sick as Crup, but Draco simply didn’t care. He didn’t intend ever to leave his home, not ever again, so he could be as ugly as sin, and it wouldn’t matter a whit.
of it at home.”
“Never?”
Harry’s heart jumps in his throat when Malfoy comes into the room through an arched door frame that Harry didn’t see before. “Hello, sir, welcome. How may I be of your assistance? If it’s a larger project, you might have to owl me about the details in advance, I’m afraid. Mending often enough needs proper preparation before I can even-“ Malfoy strips metallic shimmering gloves from his hands while he speaks, but when he properly sees Harry, he stops and purses his lips. “How may I help you?” he asks again, much less amicably.
But when they are in the bedroom, and Draco turns around to pull Harry towards him, his gaze is dark again, his lips slightly parted. “And now it’s even thrice,” Draco says, tugging at the hem of Harry’s shirt. Harry takes it off, and just like the last time, he watches Draco’s eyes travel over every inch of exposed skin, his fingers running over his stomach and up in his chest hair, starting to massage his shoulders and the crook of his neck when his hands reach the top of his torso. The look in Draco’s eyes is almost as arousing as his firm touch.
Harry frowns, opening his mouth in protest. But he might as well hop onto this freely offered excuse. “So, mending, huh?”
Teddy had been given a very generous set of paints by his grandmother. He settled into painting a picture of Draco and I, while I leafed through my new book.
I won’t say that to Draco though. I think he’d likely hex me for suggesting that we get bonded. None of his clothes fit anymore, and he is currently sporting an assortment of Muggle clothing that we’ve extended with magic. Draco believes that he looks huge and ungainly, but the truth is Draco hasn’t ever looked better. He’s gotten really big now he’s getting closer to his due date.
“I am,” Draco said, and he held out his hand, signalling Harry to come closer and sit on the bed with him. Their fingers stayed entwined. “There was something I wanted to talk about,” Draco ploughed on, sounding a bit insecure. “Well, how to say this . . .?”
Was there some hidden wizard or witch out there, intent on making him suffer?
"Like the Potter Stinks badges?" Harry suggests. Draco's eyes crinkle in embarrassed amusement as he lets his head fall on the backrest and throws his arm over his face. If Harry moved his hand just a bit, he'd touch the short hair on the side of his head. Harry shoves at him playfully and lets his hand rest against Draco’s shoulder, feeling the hint of heat and magic hidden under the fabric. "The dementor costumes? I can go on if you like."
He feels Draco swallow hard. “You mean-
of complete tosser.
Fitzgerald had ruined his life. He’d smashed it to smithereens. Everything reminded him of his rape, and he wore it like a shroud. His senses were traitorous. Smells catapulted him backwards through time. Sounds made him sick. Noises left him reeling. There had been a before and there had been an after and, try as he might, Draco couldn’t return to the person that he’d been before.
His blood pulses in his ears, unpleasant and too loud. Trying to stop muttering to himself and with an exasperated groan, Harry slowly but surely makes his way towards the entrance to the club. He doesn’t make it inside.
“Ready for this?” I asked Draco, trying to elicit a smile from his beautiful, nervous face. “You’re going to see the plum! This is a good day! It’s exciting.” There was so much more I wanted to add. I wanted to tell Draco how proud I was of him, and how well he was looking after my baby – how well he was looking after our baby – but I didn’t dare.
A feeling of almost-sobriety seizes him next, making him topple backwards a few steps. It feels like he’s been greeted with a bucket of ice water over his head. It’s uninvited and entirely too much, as realisation dawns inside his mind that what he’s feeling is a charm to sober up, and that prior to this charm, the dull pain was caused by an unexpectedly hard blow from Draco sodding Malfoy’s fist. And it’s just with that that Harry realises that the git has actually used his
Fitzgerald wanted sex, and he felt Draco owed him.
“Draco,” Harry said, striding over the carpet to Draco’s side. “I’ve missed you. You’ve not been far from my thoughts all morning.” Then, without any hesitation at all, Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him into a kiss.
Draco who was still looking amused and so freely happy, cheeks flushes, eyes sparkling
and having all his attention directed at himself, Harry feels so loved and in love with him that every inch of air between them feels like too much.
it for the first time to be precise. He’s used to it. He ignores the mild nausea that comes with the charm, the cold sweat forming in his neck, and a faint, tingly feeling that emanates in his chest and crawls into his brain. He doesn’t bother with fixing the jabbed vein, not with Malfoy watching him so intently.
Suddenly Tarquin is back in Harry’s vicinity; teeth on lips, tongue on throat, and then he drops to his knees and fumbles with Harry’s fly. With a wave of wandless magic, Harry turns the stereo on and lets his head fall back against the wall, undulating to the tunes of psychedelic guitars and a groovy bass.
Journal. I had to. He looked so happy-sad, looking over to me, eyes darting down to my middle as though to check that the plum was still there and alright. I said, "But you do know that me loving you has nothing to do with the plum, right? I mean- it does, sometimes, sort of. There are new ways of loving you now, but I did before."
I’m not letting him. For once, it feels just completely undignified and also, I’m not sure where my body wants to take too many touches. Potter kisses my cheek before he leaves for work and when he comes back, and that’s sometimes hard enough to digest. I swear, one of these days, I’ll turn my head to get a peck on the lips instead.
“Look, I just want to- After everything, I just want to live my life a little,” Harry mumbles.
It was odd; Draco had been prepped by lots of different men, but Fitzgerald’s fingers felt different, somehow. The sensation wasn’t painful, and the angle wasn’t awkward, but it just felt wrong. Draco felt discombobulated, absent from his body.
“I don’t want to bring you off your schedule,” Harry says.
, that wasn’t my fib. I told Pansy and Theo that you and I were dating… That you and I are an item.”
with high regard and care
“Look, you would never . . .” Draco catches his wrist when Harry moves to turn around, but Harry wrenches his hand away and starts pacing. He needs to move his muscles, get this electrifying feeling out of his system. Draco stands infuriatingly still when he ploughs on, voice rushed and almost free from any emotions. “You would never have talked to me the day I found you and Side-Alonged you to my house. Never. And that’s because you know who I am. You know my history and your own. I guess it was nice to have the first talks a bit . . .
for Harry. They’ve been family and had each other’s backs,
The ability to backtrack Apparition is not that easy a one to master, but it is one of the merits of Auror training. Harry Apparates, finding the general region from where he had Disapparated from Draco Malfoy’s home a few months ago with ease, though he won’t burst into the confines of his house or flat like a brute.
“I never said you can’t drink.”
“Your family has been through a lot,” Draco says. After a pause, “As we all have. But I’m glad that my work means something. Well, my assistant’s work in that case. Either way, I’m honoured that you commissioned me despite our family’s differences in the past.”
Harry blinks. “Yes,” he says, thinking that it should be obvious. But then again, with Draco, he has never bragged about his sexual promiscuity; about waking up to a stranger every other day of the week or about the one time he blew cocaine up his lover’s arse.
Your eyes are a soft baby-blue and look nothing like Draco’s or mine yet. You’re beautiful – don’t get me wrong – it’s just that Teddy said you looked a little like a steamed dumpling, and I’m afraid he was right. Merlin, but you’re so hairy. So much black hair that Healer Bartsch laughed out loud at the sight of you. He said that it’d likely fall out over the next few weeks, but somehow, I doubt it. “A Potter though and through,” was Draco’s opinion when he first laid eyes on you. “Another wild-haired Gryffindor to love and look after.”
I’ve been doing some calculating and the plum should arrive by the end of June, sometime between the 24th and the 30th if I’m not mistaken. There’s a new moon on the 24th, that would be a promising birth date I suppose. They will be born under the Cancer star sign, like Astoria. Let’s see whether they will be such an adorable sap as well. I wouldn’t mind that at all.
But after a short pause, Harry mentions, “I’m living with Draco. With Draco Malfoy,” as though there were a thousand possible Dracos.
still fills me with wonder.
Harry shakes his head.
“Erm, I don’t know.”
Draco adored Ollie’s parties. True, the chap was as straight as a fucking
, Draco nodded his agreement. “Why not?” he answered, shoving his notes in his satchel. “Lead the way.”
‘Thank you for the compliment James. I'm preening. You sound like exactly the sort of man I’d like to get to know better,’ he had written. ‘Men with deep pockets are my favourite. If you’ve got the money, then I promise you a night you won’t quickly forget.’
“I’m sure they will understand as well.”
When his eyes focused on me, he looked a bit conflicted. I already dreaded that he had second doubts about me or about gay sex or whatever it was that was on his mind. But when he spoke, the first thing he said was, “We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do, Drake.”
special if you’ve not kicked him to the curb yet. Tell me, love: it’s Stuart Fitzgerald, isn’t it? The Beater? All of
Well. I’ve read
the pharmacist, thinking that, after confiding all kinds of embarrassing shit in Draco and after sneaking off in the twilight of dawn like he had, panicking in the morning upon the sight of pebbled scars across a nipple- He can’t ever go back. Never.
– and not being aware of it was unconscionable. It had been easier to bury his head in the sand; easier to pretend nothing was changing in his life.
“Didn’t you?”
“I want you, Potter.” Draco pushes himself up until his back is flat against Harry’s chest. Automatically, Harry wraps his arms around his narrow middle. The moment their mouths connect, Harry presses his prick against Draco’s entrance, feeling himself slip in after a short moment of resistance. The moment feels different, different to the sex Harry usually knows and different to the way they touched before. It’s an embrace, and they kiss, sloppy and open-mouthed, while Harry is in awe with the way their bodies fit together, so flush against each other.
There’s a small mirthless smile. “Ever been married? That’s the perfect definition of being married, Potter.” They both laugh a little; Harry chances a glance at Malfoy’s hands. Two rings adorn his fingers, but Harry has no idea whether one of them looks like a wedding band. He’s not even sure whether he could tell a wedding band from any other ring.
A snort. “
Fuck, but I’m such a coward.
Draco wouldn’t have accepted five grand for a date with me. For one thing, he doesn’t do dates. Lots of wizards – even Jules, my colleague at Phoenix – have tried to court him. Draco is as polite as can be, but he never lets anyone inside his head. He never lets them in. Draco is as inscrutable now as he was at school. If I had propositioned Draco and asked for his services, I fear that I might have lost his friendship altogether. That is one outcome I cannot countenance.
The living room is divided into two fractions; on one side are the witches and Ron, all of them cooing over Hermione’s baby bump and little Rosy who sits perched on her dad’s knee, the only exception being a pale-looking Ginny, and gathered around the fireplace are the other Weasley sons with their dad and a bloke who seems to be Percy’s colleague from the Ministry. Harry sits awkwardly in between them, tired of hearing about broom regulations and not quite feeling like engaging in baby talk either, enduring the repetitive songs in the wireless.
When I felt that I was getting closer, my prick in my hand, I told him to go harder. I wanted a bit of that fantasy I’ve sometimes wanked off to. Potter, mercilessly pounding away at me in various positions, having his way with me just as he pleases.
And with that, Draco left Oliver’s bathroom.
I’m okay with that. Whenever this bloke realises that he can have a good few hours of “fooling around” for far less than that, his money will never to be seen again, thrown at the voracious gullet of the Ministry. The bank will be happy, and the one-off might even change my monthly instalment.
Draco huffs a breath, hoping to sound annoyed, not overwhelmed as he tries to tune out the deafening silence of a person’s mind, clenching their fists and just staring, staring, staring at their angrily crying toddler. “It’s Unspeakable business, an occurrence like that. I don’t know why
Harry treats himself with some takeaway the first night and he visits Ron and Hermione the next. While ‘Mione needs to catch a spot of sleep because she can’t sleep through the nights at the moment, Ron and Harry spend the afternoon listening to a Quidditch match on the Wireless, and when Rose wakes up before Hermione, Ron gets her quietly. The three of them take a little walk along a gravel road between meadows and the verge of a pinewood. Harry is surprised when Rose keeps on taking his hand, leading him a little way off the trail, just to show him branches and grasses.
Harry decides to go to them, greeting their appraising eyes with a few mumbled words. “Share a sip?” he asks, nodding his chin towards the uncapped bottle of vodka. The bottleneck stings against his lips, the swig, like ice on his tongue, cleansing his throat. When he hands the bottle back, telling them his name, he feels his tongue wet and heavy in his oral cavity, the air biting on his flushed cheeks.
most gorgeous smile and the rest of that bollocks.” Draco let his knee brush Harry’s own, light and gentle. “Bet I could bring a smile to your face. I always could provoke your very best reactions, Potter.”
And Kayden that coward just left me there! He would’ve left me to die if Harry hadn’t given me that coin. Okay, according to St Mungo’s I probably would not have gone beyond the veil, but what an arsehole. Would not have expected him to get so angry only because I wasn’t able to take care of his erection. Mind me, I was only about to fucking faint on him.
That conversation happened right before Draco and Harry started their huge renovation. They had the help of friends and family for the first big steps, and after a day of listening to quips about how they behave like a pair of randy teenagers, they were thankful but pleased to continue on their own, just the two of them. They restored the rooms to a beauty that thrived between the traditional memories of the place and their taste for less ornate designs and less colour. They mended most of the things they found because, at some point in the past, they belonged to Draco’s ancestors.
Harry accompanied Draco on his first visit to the Wizard’s Health Clinic at St Mungo’s. It felt bizarre, felt otherworldly, to be sat in the waiting room amongst all the happy doting couples, and see them smiling, all of them glowing with health and ecstatic about their futures.
Petunia Dursley who watched them quietly, for the most part, her back not secured against a doorframe, but still standing at the foot of the staircase- she finds Harry’s eyes, her mouth corners twisted downward, her gaze focused. There’s shame, Draco notes. There’s the image of a young, helpless boy, unwanted and a freak, but maybe she’s been too harsh on him. Maybe it’s been cruel of her to make him scrub the floors until his skin dissolved from the scouring cleanser.
With a swish of black, formal robes, Draco was gone. Harry looked at the empty space where his boyfriend had been and made a decision. Draco’s fierce enthusiasm was contagious. He knew there was only one celebrity that the Chimaera’s Den wouldn’t be able to resist.
“She was so happy with your repainting,” Draco says. “I wish you had seen her face. She adores it.”
Draco and I, we share my bedroom now. It seemed easier, I suppose, more practical, and both of us are cuddly sleepers, our limbs entwined beneath the sheets. That is how we woke, the press of skin on skin and our bodies fitting together like two parts of a puzzle. After we began sleeping together, neither of us wanted to be apart for any longer than we needed to be. There wasn’t any discussion or any laying down of rules. We didn’t make a big proclamation to the world, but none of our friends seemed remotely surprised at our coupling up. “The only shock is that it’s taken you both so long,” was Ron’s opinion on the matter. “You’ve wasted enough time,” was Hermione’s comment. "Don’t squander anymore.”

No, the music in the clubs and in the factory-like venues, does feel genuine, and not like bloody attention whores, circling the flashlights like vultures.

You know, I think there’s something going on between the two of them. I wouldn’t have expected it – the two of them are as different as Kneazles and Crups – but there were definitely a few glances that were shared just a moment too long. Even I noticed it, and I’m normally the most oblivious person in the world. We’ll see, shall we? If you’re reading this, Cassie, and Blaise and Astoria are lovingly bonded, you’ll have heard it here first.
“Alright?” he asked as he gently shoved Harry’s hand away to replace his grip with his own. For a moment then, Harry was afraid to orgasm just at the sight of Draco’s mouth hovering above the head of his prick. But with his nod, Draco’s lips were sealed around his cock, and his palms rolled his balls; both touches so delightfully decided and wet that it didn’t take Harry a minute to warn Draco about his impending orgasm. With that, Draco pulled his mouth off of Harry’s prick and stroked him through it with clever fingers and dilated eyes glued on Harry’s face which he felt like hiding under a pillow if Draco hadn’t looked at him so hungrily.
And Harry remembers the year after that, one year on the day, and how utterly speechless he was to find Malfoy at the low buzz of the Wards bordering the Hogwarts grounds in the dead of night, his cheeks hollow and his sunken eyes like bruises. Even something about his hair didn’t look quite right, and it took Harry several years to understand that Malfoy’s wandlessness due to his probation probably meant that he could not have Apparated there into the middle of the Highlands; that the tremor in his body was probably because he couldn’t cast a Warming Charm, and, back then, Harry hadn’t even spent a single thought to where Malfoy might live with both parents imprisoned and the Manor still confiscated.
I fucked my friend and paid him handsomely for the privilege of doing so. I don’t regret the sex, but I regret the emotions that the sex has released within me. I'm jealous of James Evans. I hate him.
Draco raised his wand to mend a book that Daisy had left discarded on the ground, with several pages creased. The spell unfolded the corners and Harry watched as it Levitated back into its confines of the shelf where the babe was already grabbing the next one.
Harry has never been so grateful for being a wizard and, ever after- well, he’s also adept with wandless magic. Healing himself takes some effort, takes a few tries with that feeling of still being slightly drunk, his throat dry and acidic from smoking too much. He ought to get rid of these habits, he thinks faintly, putting on some of his clothes that he finds discarded next to their makeshift bed that turns out to be a settee after further scrutiny. He should stop spending weekends anywhere but home, stop drinking, stop smoking. The sex is a welcome change, though, and Harry wishes he could remember more of it than what just flashed before his mind’s eye; brown eyes, dark with lust, his heart thumping away in his chest at the idea that beanie-bloke might see right through his pretence of self-confidence about anal sex. Perhaps if he gets home today, he will try to start eating better, only drinking at the weekends . . .
Draco turned and he angled his head under the racing water, closing his eyes as I found his lips. The two of us kissed, our bodies slick and sliding over each other’s, Draco’s round belly pressed snug against my flat one. I was the first to break our kiss.
I suppose, given my history, you’d think that I ought to loathe Christmas. When I was little – even before I knew I was a wizard – it was always a lonely time for me.
But back to Harry. We were talking about which shops to visit and how much we wanted to spend. “I don’t want him to be overwhelmed,” Harry said while working away on the broom. “Last year, Christmas was so busy with all the pressies Teds got. I’d rather see him enjoy a few meaningful ones than receiving heaps, half of which were never even touched.”
was exactly what I needed.” The Beater seemed to catch on when he saw the sight of Draco's flaccid, disinterested prick. “Let me take care of you,” he coaxed, taking it inside his hand and beginning to stroke it. “We can’t have you leaving without your own happy ending.”
It’s not until Draco comes back, beaming with excitement and affection, but his eyes focused with academic curiosity, that Harry’s mood shifts, unbidden and sudden. They kiss in the hallway with Harry’s arms holding Draco snug around his middle, when Draco holds him by his shoulders, pressing one kiss to Harry’s lips that feels hurried and final.
“Is this from the amulet? The Horcrux?” he asks, meaning the scar on Harry’s sternum.
Draco wasn’t sure of the truth of that. “I don’t know,” he admitted, his voice breaking. He felt fragmented, inside and out. “What if I’m not enough? What if I don’t have enough love to give? I’m not sure I can do this or even if I want to. I didn’t ask for this,” he said. “The bump – the
Ron is always trying to couple me up to any eligible gay wizards that come his way. Last week it was Johnathan, his MACUSA colleague who had arrived from America for a year at the DMLE. Dutifully, I went out for a drink with him, but I knew, even as I was waiting for him in the Leaky Cauldron, that I was wasting both our time. Johnathan was a fine fellow, funny and witty, but he wasn’t Draco… That’s the thing. Nobody ever comes close to him. Nobody ever has, not if I’m entirely honest.
only highest possible velocity. And the wixen had no idea that they were flying an illegal broomstick.”
“Harry, are you okay?” Draco asks.
Draco snorts, and Harry watches in the mirror how his nose crumples. Smiling bright and happy, Draco puts Harry’s hood up. “You’re looking scrumptious.” Harry wants to kiss Draco after pulling his hood up as well, but Draco firmly presses a finger on Harry’s lips. “We’ll be late. Aunt Andromeda would not approve of that,” Draco reproaches, not without a giddy smile ghosting over his lips when Harry sneaks just one single kiss before they Side-Along.
’ a lot. It’s . . .” Harry holds his breath for a moment. He really shouldn’t feel so annoyed.
“May I?” Harry asked, coming just an inch closer, his eyes on Draco’s lips. Draco nodded his consent, his eyes, too, dipping lower on Harry’s face. When their lips met, the kiss was slow and familiar, a needed reconnection, because the talk had begun to get just a little bit too abstract for the sensual matter at hand.
I swallowed, hardly sure why I was being allowed this chance, but not wanting to do anything to hex it. “Please don’t worry about the stretchmark. Wear it as a badge of pride. It shows that you carried the plum. There’s not a single part of you that isn’t beautiful.”
Harry’s feeling increasingly irritated with this bloke, but feels too faint, his tongue too slack for a scathing remark that might send him away. So he listens to the talent scout’s stream of thoughts about this young guy and all the easy money he’s about to make with his self-devotion and his hot adolescent biceps and the hint of a six-pack, and how it only adds to his story that he wants to invest this easy money the channel will pay him into studying. “And there’s also this girl,” the talent scout points out just when Harry thinks he ran out of things to talk about or that his high started to wear off. Harry thinks that, perhaps, he is in purgatory after all. Or in hell or hades. Or maybe he’s still in the forest, trapped there with a bunch of mentals who seem to be just as stuck in their own minds as Harry himself. “And she’s perfect material,” the bloke goes on, incessantly fanning air against his revealed chest. “Will be such a viewer magnet with her botoxed lips and her- she always has these cat eyes, you see? Typical Latina—temperamental, thinks she’s dressed to the nines with her short, snug dresses. And, if you know what I mean, pal, it’s not only her front that is-“ he gestures in front of his chest, cupping air in his palms.
The truth was, Draco was beginning not to love what was happening to him at all. His jaw was starting to ache, and the jolt of Fitzgerald’s thrusts against him weren’t alluring. They'd become a bit painful. For the first time, Draco wished he’d not drunk quite as much as he had.
But once the idea was planted, we started planning away like that was something we did all the time. Harry calculated all the important key data on weight of the flyer and the weight of the wood, how strong the charms would need to be in order to be compliant to the broomstick regulations. He showed me a bunch of different woods and together we mused which might be the perfect material.
“Oh, wizards like to buy sex,” he said sharply, glaring at the Mediwizard. “I'll have you know that I’ve been brought by men of every shape, race and creed and beneath their clothes, they’re all exactly the same. Don’t worry Harry. I won’t let anyone take my baby. I’d leave London and disappear, long before that happened.” Draco narrowed his eyes, his stare withering. “And yes, I know what else you’re assuming, so let’s get that little matter out in the open as well. Yes, my baby’s other father was one of my clients, and yes, he was a wizard. Perhaps he was a Metamorphmagus or used Polyjuice because you know what, I’ve no idea who he was. I still don’t, but that doesn’t matter because I’ll be enough for them.”
. Then there’s the search for words, the need to speak before the boy, the boy who looks more like the unkempt monster he’s always been now without their care- before he would leave.
“Do you need to go?” Jules asked, looking at my white knuckled hands.
Instead, Harry finds himself in a quaint street in Lacock, Wiltshire. For a moment he thinks he would have had to go further  because Malfoy Manor can’t be far from here, but he’s sure that he's close. The street looks wizarding if the floating displays in the shop windows and the width of the street, much too small for a car, are anything to go by. It’s hardly different to Diagon, except smaller and quieter, the houses possibly older. Natural stones support white walled upper floors, warm timbres lead into dim shops through low door frames.
Addressed in emerald-green ink to
I’m sitting in my parlour as I write.
“It makes what easier? Talking? Because we tend to be . . . very agreeable on coke or mephedrone?”
“Oh,” Harry says again, this time with a huge grin plastered across his face. “I had no idea that gays could marry
might be a better word,” he suggested, feeling his soul shatter a little. "I’ll admit, Pans, that of all the things Harry was expecting to hear yesterday, it certainly wasn’t that.”
Her words ran out, and the two of them were quiet for a moment. Daisy made a snuffling noise, deep in her dreams.
I wasn’t expecting Draco to reply as quickly as he did.
Nobody else knows about the baby yet, although I know my gaggle of mates far too well. I’m sure that the Malfoy-Potter cohabitation of Grimmauld Place has been commented on and discussed
I’ll admit, diary, that my heart was beating ten to the dozen as I sipped tea in Andi’s lounge, waiting for him to arrive. Teddy was beside me, nattering about his friends from primary school, and the class cat that they’ve just adopted, but – completely disgraceful, I know - I wasn’t listening.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “But you’ve told the other dad?”
Once Malfoy started speaking, he apparently couldn’t bring himself to stop. Would one have asked Harry what he had expected Draco Malfoy to say to him—ex-foe, still former bully, then reticent kindred spirit—it would have been something nice and inconsequential. How are you? Do you have trouble sleeping too? Just three, two, one more year until my probation is over. Thanks for not reporting the Seeing Skull you found when your team searched the Manor.
, with him if they so dearly wish to act as his substitute parents. And for Hermione to speak her mind instead of acting after some psychology textbook, and for Ron to stop
“Of course,” Draco concedes. “Yes, I only mean- What I meant to say was-“
a jar of lube from the same drawer he’d gotten the Firewhisky from. “Don’t worry, Malfoy. I’ll make sure you have a great time.”
“Not at the weekend, no,” Harry answered, the lines around his eyes crinkling in amusement. “And I’ll tell you what Malfoy. Since I find myself at a loose end, why don’t you tell me what’s making you look so glum?” Hasty as always, Harry didn’t pause before he was turning in his seat and signalling to the barman. “We’ll have the bottle, Tom,” Harry said, with all the happy arrogance of a wizard that rarely heard the word no. “Just put it on my tab.”
The last call I made was to Narcissa, who had demanded, quite rightly, that she be told the very moment that there was any news. Naturally, she was worried, but even through the Floo flames I could see how very glittery and excited her eyes were. She’ll be a wonderful grandma; I had no doubts about that. Since her release from Dartmore she had been a very different, much more laid-back person than the uptight aristocrat that I knew in my youth. “Can I do anything?” she asked. “Come to St Mungo’s or-“
Draco listens.
“Do you still have that . . . the phoenix thing?” Harry didn’t know he’d ask until he does.
“You sound like you had a schoolgirl pash yourself,” Theo answered, sounding a little put out by the way that the conversation was progressing. “Wasn’t anyone else at that damned school writing those dozens of inches of parchment that Snape was always demanding? Or was that just me, and the two of you were out on Potterwatch?”
The entrance hall is eerily gloomy and chilly but clean. Draco tells him in a nervous voice that there would likely be house-elves that must be around because they keep everything here in check. They would inform him if something was amiss. He summons them, and four house-elves appear who all of them bow deeply in front of Draco who only seems more nervous and short-winded.
“Erm . . .” That’s nothing Harry actively thought about, but Malfoy sounds hurt. “I’m sorry? I didn’t mean to be rude. Just a habit, I guess. Besides, I told you that you can call me Harry or Potter.” Harry shrugs. “Makes no difference.”
Perhaps it’s all for the best. I go back to thinking about the plum, discard all other things my embellishing fantasy came up with.
After I was okay to leave the hospital this morning, we had breakfast together. Merlin, but Potter cried before we even finished the tea. He confessed it all, the whole sorry take, and I told him that everything will proceed under my terms and conditions now. That he can bloody pay for everything – St Mungo’s, everything we will need for the baby – and that he better look after himself so that he’ll be strong enough to provide the much needed magic.
, sick here in the Great Hall for everyone to see.
There was only one thing to do in situations as dire as this one, and that was get drunk. Perhaps once he’d swallowed a few shots of Ogden’s Finest he’d be able to Floo back to Parkinson and announce that it'd been some sort of lark. A practical joke to keep the lovebirds on their toes.
“The death-thing?”
“We could . . . I don’t know. We might as well take them tonight. We'll get new ones by Friday anyway.”
Salazar, but it has taken me a bit more than two weeks to talk about it, but I have done at last. First with Astoria when she visited me for tea, and once it was out, I had to tell Harry about it as well.
Even though Harry can't begin to imagine how his health or being on turkey would be without magic, he is glad that he doesn’t feel as faint anymore, thanks to a combination of some prescription-free potions, Draco’s care, and a healthy alternation between rest and helping Draco out in the workshop or around the house.
“Do go on,” Draco said, but he interrupted himself with another, “May I?” meaning touching Harry. Harry nodded, automatically bringing his hands up, but Draco brought both his hands up to meet them, his body jolting and the door behind him rattling from pushing back. “Can you . . . Let me, for now.” After a second, he whispered, “Sorry.”
Harry was just calculating a smooth angle to start unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, when Draco gently pushes against his shoulder, signalling him to sit up. Pink lips and heavy-lidded eyes in the sedate light of the room. The hint of his smile is completely disarming. But Draco gives the impression that they are done kissing, hopefully only for now.
busy. I can’t be the only one of his clients that have gone on to fall in love with him. Perhaps it is an occurrence that happens often.
The chap next to Harry was quiet so far, not indulging in any Fio-talk, but he turns to Harry now. He’s shorter than Harry himself, which was quite a rarity, and the way he voices his words, Harry knows that it’s not meant for the whole round, but only for him. “I’m John,” he says, nodding at Harry, his eyes dark and assessing in the unnatural light that’s cast upon his face.
I’ll feel dreadfully ashamed whenever I see him, that’s what will happen. And once I’m done being embarrassed, I’ll remember how he’s acting all holier than thou, and I’ll get mad at him for taking the moral high ground with me, mostly because he’s right to do so. Salazar, but knowing myself so well is hardly any help when it doesn’t help my darn feelings anyway.
When Harry goes to the loo, he’s only half-surprised that he’s cornered by the bloke who was so cross with him for the compliment. The hallway is dimly lit with sconces that mock the soft, warm flicker of a candle in a poor imitation. Harry finds himself crowded against the pure-white wall panelling, one of the edges digging into his shoulder blades.
All I could do was comfort Draco with a hug, pulling his lithe little body into my arms. I could feel the round swell of his bump next to my own taut belly. He is getting bigger, his movements more languid and unhurried.
“Get onto the bed,” Draco says, and Harry strips down his jeans and his pants in one go. As if magnetic, Draco’s hands are on Harry’s hard-on even before his knees sink into the mattress, blissfully soft after the torment of the hardwood floor, even if it was just for a few minutes.
“Well, how many percent of the population are gay? Or bi? Anyway, there’s a good chance he wouldn’t touch me with a barge pole while you probably just have to strip off your shirt.”
“Turn of the nineteenth to the twentieth century?” Harry asks.
“Have you planned ahead?” Hermione asks Teddy with a kind smile. “Wrapped your head around which subjects you’d like to take?”
They kiss slow and tenderly after that, and Harry can’t remember ever being kissed like that—with closed eyes, hands in each other’s hair. He thinks about where and how they could shag. Grimmauld isn’t an option, unfortunately. Not only is the home magical, but Harry half-suspects Ron or Hermione or both of them might be waiting for him in the drawing room as though they were his parents, arms crossed, and voices dripping with reprimand and worry.
Yes, Draco might have fought on the opposite side during the war, but in so many ways our experiences were mirrored. The pair of us were misused by adults that we trusted with our lives and forced to carry our hatred like a shroud. The pair of us were lucky to emerge with most of our sanity intact and the freedom of long lives in front of us to live.
Stuart Fitzgerald was waiting for him on the landing. “I was bored of all those idiots down there,” he said, stepping over to where Draco was standing. “Thought it was high time that you and I had some time alone. What’d you reckon, Draco?”
and, simultaneously,
Draco hushes Harry and kisses the top of his head.
I couldn’t understand how I’d so thoroughly buggered everything up. Why was Draco so defensive about my paying off the debt? There’s been many times in my short life where I’ve not been the most sensitive of men, so I thought perhaps Mike could put me right, and he did. I left his office feeling better than I have in ages.
But after a while, Father caught sight of my middle. For a moment, I wasn’t even sure what he wanted but unmistakably, he pointed to the plum, his eyes gleaming with joy. “Draco,” he said then, and I thought that I had imagined it all. That I only thought he hadn’t recognised me or that he was cross with me for something.
I know it’s a silly precaution, but I’ve made him take an enchanted coin on his dates. It’s exactly like the one we used to use in the DA, except that it’s a Muggle pound coin. All he has to do is squeeze it in his fist, and then I can Apparate over to wherever Draco might be. “My Saviour,” Draco teased, when I insisted that he take it, but I noticed that he tucked it into his pocket without an argument.
With apprehensive eyes on Harry, Malfoy takes a sip of his tea before he speaks. “Nice it was indeed. Except for the part where you left.”
“And just imagine,” Aanya goes on, “to make all of it happen, the mass husbandry. To ensure optimum conditions for new life to be created,
Fitzgerald ruffled Draco’s hair before he stood up. “You’re a brilliant fuck, blondie. Seems the rumours are true.” He yawned. “Listen, I hope you don’t mind, but I’m going to grab a shower. The Arrows have some boring-as-shit fan event in Flourish and Blotts tomorrow. You know how it is. I’m contracted to attend. But this has been fun.” He lent over, and pressed a kiss on Draco’s cheek. “I’m up for a repeat session, any time.”
Draco watched Harry go, staring at the spot in the middle of his lounge where Potter had stood. He watched the last vestiges of his magic vanish, and he thought about what Harry had said. How he needed a friend, and how it didn’t matter what other people thought. How his life wasn’t ruined.
“Hm?”
“I hate when you do that,” Potter whispers, expression changing from open to business. “So, tell me. Could it be here?”
“I heard you shouting, and I thought you’d slipped over, or something worse,” I answered, not really sure where to put my eyes. I wasn’t used to the sight of such a completely nude Draco, and the sight of him, big with my baby, his skin plush and glowing was doing some very funny things to my inside. To my penis as well, though I tried not to think about that, lest I made it worse.
The music box turned into his own little project. The charms were perfectly in place—the third time Harry held the thing in hand, he discovered that there was a pearl stuck in the mechanism which put the whole thing out of operation. But what he does is clean, and polish, and paint the whole thing back into a state of splendid, untouched beauty, or that’s what he tries.
Draco nods vehemently, taking the water bottle out of Harry’s hands. He rubs the back of his hand over his face before he uncaps the bottle and chugs the water down. He opens a second one. “I get that. Oh, Salazar’s balls, believe me-
Draco wasn’t really dating Harry Potter, though he really wished he was. Still, what else was new? He fancied the socks off the wizard since he was twelve. That was only a decade of pining, give or take a few months.
“Perce needs a Dom,” Ron has joked, miming the crack of a whip to our hoots of laughter. “That’d loosen the bugger up a bit.”
I slept with Harry Potter.
Draco switched regularly, and couldn’t say that he had a preference either way. Sexual positions didn’t imply anything about a person’s wider life, yet Fitzgerald seemed to believe that Draco was an instinctive bottom. It was stereotypical, clichéd bullshit and entirely fucking boring.
,” Harry retorts, teasing, and this time, Draco's nose crumples up in amusement.
“It’s just two nights,” Draco replies, a warm gleam in his eyes. “I’ll be back before you know it.”
“So, we want to . . .?” Harry asked.
that you hope to crack if you only try often enough. Good thing that Voldemort at least showed you your talent with that bloody Vanishing Cabinet, but let me tell you what,” Harry spits, “This-“ he gestures to his own forehead- “This is unmendable.”
Draco snorts and looks up from where he’s planting garlic before he bursts into full-on laughter. “Merlin, you’re such an idiot.” Grinning along and shaking his head, Harry goes over to him, not able to resist the way Draco looks when he’s getting his hands dirty. When Harry throws his arms around the squatting figure of Draco, they sway dangerously, but Harry manages to stop them from falling onto the freshly aerated, pitch-black soil.
Draco felt anger bloom in his brain. Fitzgerald expected them to get straight down to fucking? Was the man a
With a shudder and a reproaching glance at Harry, Draco nods. “Yule. Yes. And despite his . . . disturbing appearance, he was quite nice. But I hadn’t seen Father so very nervous to please ever before, and You-Know-Who was very good at . . . suggesting something was a promise just as much as it was a threat.”
He stands and descends two sets of staircases, finding Draco in his workshop. He looks up when Harry stands there on the threshold.
Darling, I don’t care what you do with your life. You can be a Quidditch player, or you can make potions. You can bake cakes or raise Hippogriffs. As long as you’re happy, that’s all that matters. Happiness is everything, and I’ll make sure you have an easier life than Draco and I did. I suppose this is an apology too – I’m getting in early here, Cassie! – I don’t have a dad, so I’m not wholly sure how to do this fatherhood thing. I’m going to have to make it up as I go along.
Draco is still no closer to forgiving me, though there have been some small thaws in the ice over the last few weeks. Perhaps that is my wishful thinking. Draco’s face looks pinched much of the time, and I think that his back is painful with the extra weight he’s carrying.
“And you take in . . . just anything?”
“I’m not prude,” John emphasises, eyes on Harry. “I just told this prat here a thousand times this week that he’s got exams soon, and that he ought to sit his arse down and start actually learning.”
“But you left.”
Despite himself, despite
It’s farcical, actually. Part of me dies a little with envy at the idea of Draco and these other nameless, faceless men, while the other part of me is protective. I want them to treat Draco with respect and not just fuck into him like he’s a living sex doll, made to their specifications, without any needs or wants of his own. I’m aware of how infantilising I’m being, and how condescending. Draco is an adult and a professional. This is his world, and I know he can look after himself.
I’m his everything again.
Harry spots the moon then. A pale crescent among the voluminous grey clouds. The moon rising before sundown has a myriad of different influences on plants and brewing processes, Harry recalls. And on the tide and therefore on some spells that have to do with earth magic.
Harry looks at the painting again and he thinks about the bookshelf and how cosy the dark-grey settee is. “Is this . . . Do you live here?”
The Dursleys never modelled healthy, loving relationships when I was a child, and then with school came Voldemort and the war, but that wasn’t an excuse for the way I’d conducted myself over the last few months.
There’s a frown on Harry’s face, accentuating his severe, weary appearance. “I told you it wouldn’t be very . . . interesting.”
“Like what?”
Harry frowns at Draco’s words, trying to imagine a younger version of Draco; a sneering boy, a skeletal spectre in sixth year, hardly any better when Harry saw him again at Malfoy Manor . . . and in the courtroom. “It’s unfair, the way you got involved in this.”
That was part of the reason, but it wasn’t all of it.
For a moment, Harry is completely torn between letting their hands fall back down and just pressing another kiss to Draco’s hand. Upon seeing Draco’s vulnerable, open face watching him almost anxiously, Harry’s stomach does a weird flip, and he leans down—not to kiss the back of Draco’s hand, glistening in the rich orange of the setting sun, but rather turn his arm and put his lips on the soft cotton on the spot where he suspects the Dark Mark to be.
“Oh, I . . .” Harry clears his throat, feeling embarrassment bloom on his cheeks. He thinks that the blow must be wearing off. “I don’t remember that.”
Harry stares at Malfoy.
Draco could see that Cormac had gotten bored of the conversation. He watched as the wizard balled up the cover of the paper, and sent it flying across at Ginny with a flick of his wand. She chuckled, and so did Cormac.
Draco swallowed; his mouth dry. Suddenly he was more exhausted than he’d ever been in his life.
At the moment Blaise and Astoria are sitting with him, gifting him their magic with their touches - and I’ve been shooed away from the ward and away from Draco's bedside, told to go home and try to get some sleep. I’ve been there twelve hours.
. He’s blind, so angry and blind.
“I don’t think it matters what other people think,” Harry answered, matter of fact. “It’s your body, and it’s your baby. You’ve still got four months to make a decision about what you want your future to look like.”
If I’d pretend to be anything but the heir of my family, I’d have to mention what I do for a living. And I don’t know one soul on Gaia’s green earth who wouldn’t be completely appalled.
“Plans you haven’t shared with me,” Draco said, hating how stupid and slurred his words sounded. “We haven’t even talked about who is going to top, Stuart! Sex… It- It
Harry is unsure of what to say and suddenly aware that it’s early in the afternoon and that Malfoy probably has work to do. He follows the idea he subconsciously had anyway, and reaches into his pocket, retrieving the two bags of coke and mephedrone. “I still owe you,” he says. “Thought we could . . . I don’t know, repeat last time?”
“Come on, I won’t break,” I told him, and I took his hands and put them on my bump. “Just hold there. Some pressure always feels nice, especially when… Feels more secure, less moving about,” I told him, and even if it wasn’t anything special to say, it felt like a great deal to me to find that little compromise.
“I need you-“ Draco kisses Harry, not caring how brittle his voice sounds. “
They both laugh while rearranging their positions on the settee, and possibly Draco feels just as clumsy as Harry. When they face each other, arms meeting on the backrest, their hands squeezing each other’s forearms, Harry leans forward to put his lips on Draco’s, chaste, testing.
Harry looks at Draco for a long moment. Only when their eyes meet, does he feel something funny and bittersweet erupt in his ribcage. He gives a mirthless laugh and shrugs his shoulders. Harry thinks about Hermione and Ron who will have their second child. About Tarquin who mustered up the courage to find out what he wanted two long, weird years ago. About Teddy who wants to be an Auror like his mum was. "I have no bloody idea what I want. Everyone seems to have their big dreams and their lives and their futures, but I'm just-" Harry’s arms dangle in front of him, pointing to the room, to his chest, then he abandons the gesture. He doesn’t want to tell Draco that he’s all he needs. It’s too much pressure. It might be just too much. "Ever after that thing I've told you about, I just don't have any big life plans."
“Malfoy,” came a voice from beside him, jolting Draco out of his daydreams and back to the present. His heart hammered and swooped in his chest. Draco would have known that soft Home Counties accent at any time and any place. As if by some sort of obscure spell, the subject of Draco’s imaginings had been conjured up.
I’d fallen so hard for Draco, and the baby we’d made, and the life that we’d built in Grimmauld Place that I hadn’t dared to pause, hadn’t even dared to take a breath.
I love him.
Harry nods towards Tarquin's face. "Hit your head?"
Luckily, I had thought ahead and had booked seats in first-class. He said that it reminded him of travelling to school, and that he was half-wondering when the Trolly Witch would be along with her Ice Mice and packets of Droobles.
Salazar, my nausea is starting to get rather appalling. I’ve lost a few pounds and my chest is already looking way too skinny. It can hardly be entirely stress- and anxiety-related.
Every so often Draco came back for seconds, but usually he moved onto the next man speedily enough. They were so many, and he was only one wizard. He got around, and everyone knew it.
One night. Five Thousand pounds. 5.000. That’s very much about 25.000 Galleons.
As for me, I always ask Draco to accompany me. He always demurs of course, calling it a Muggle observance and telling me that he couldn’t possibly stay up until after midnight. “I need my beauty sleep,” Draco told me last year. “I’m no good to anyone without a good chunk of rest.”
Malfoy gets a few bottles of water and a box of chocolates, and if Harry hadn’t guessed before, at least now he
It’s exactly as he imagined it to be. The place reeks of absence but looks as though it is cleaned every now and then. The drawing room is veiled in the grey shadows of the sombre November day. He feels the tingle of Wards that are not his own. It doesn’t take five minutes until Hermione steps out of the Floo.
Don’t know what to say. He paid everything, all of the remaining 9k. Here I was, happy that despite having cancelled all remaining dates after my breakdown, that I’ve been able to scrape up the necessary 82 Galleons for this month.
that he isn’t biased against Muggles anymore. Well, he wears
Harry froze, mid-sentence, already knowing he’d said too much. Damn his impetuous mouth. Draco was a lawyer, used to noticing every last word. Daring to look up at his boyfriend, Harry found Draco gazing curiously at him.
Of all the people in Draco’s life, the last person he’d ever imagine that he'd have for a friend was Harry Potter. It was farcical. The universe’s big joke. Pansy had been a wall of stony silence ever since he’d made his ill-timed confession, and Draco couldn’t blame her, not really. Draco knew he was supposed to be outrageous, supposed to be entertaining. He was supposed to be diverting, not broken. He had broken the rules, and now he was being punished.
“But- Isn’t all the magic-electronic-interaction a bit funny? Is it going to work?” Harry asks.
Between his mother and Harry, Draco felt shielded from the reality of his situation. He still hadn’t been able to make a decision about what the future held, and every day he felt the pressure more keenly. Mother had mooted the idea of the bump going to live with Andromeda while they were still small – Teddy was bigger now; aunty Andi loved babies – and he’d agreed that seemed like a perfect solution. Draco would have been able to Floo over whenever he wanted and visit the bump. He’d get to know them, and watch them grow up. They’d have Teddy as a sibling and they’d have a full, happy life. When they were older, Draco could get to know them a little better.
To share intimacy is so much better than to toss one off all by yourself. Sweet Circe, it really is. I'm sitting with Harry on a bench, overwatching the sea, and I just told him what I wrote down. To my astonishment, he told me that he keeps a diary as well to which I answered that only fourth-years call it a diary.
Today I brought sex.
Circe, I’m crying again. Need a short break.
person the whole common room expected you to end up with.”
“It’s . . .” Harry lapses into silence for a moment, trailing the juts of Draco’s spine with two fingers and stepping even closer until Draco’s arms deny him from crawling into his skin like Harry often wishes he could. “It wasn’t bad.”
Draco would have liked to have locked the door to St Swithins Crescent and never left again. Never leaving meant he didn’t run the risk of seeing Fitzgerald shopping on Diagon Alley, or drinking in The Leaky Cauldron. Never leaving meant he’d never have to see that self-satisfied smirk ever again.
For a moment their eyes are locked on each other, and Harry’s heart pounds heavily in his chest all of a sudden. He wants to say something, anything, but no words come as though his vocal cords are clogged up with euphoria. In lieu of speaking, he brushes a few strands of light hair out of grey eyes, and caresses Draco’s high cheekbones. Draco looks so vulnerable, as though he doesn’t dare breathe. After another kiss, they both go back to work, both of them not speaking, only smiling as though they’ve just told each other the best joke in existence.
“You want to say something,” she pointed out, sounding like she had braced herself to hear something horrible.
“Ginny Firecalled Grimmauld Place to warn me,” Harry explained to Draco, watching Cormac leave. “She told me that Cormac had been to dinner with Fitzgerald last night, and that he’d fed him a story. I tried to get here as soon as the words left her mouth, but I was too late. I’m sorry, Draco. I should have been faster.”
Our hours of infused magic are the sweetest, most frustrating torture. Every day I find that I cannot think of a single thing else. Those hours when I get to lay my hands on the hard, silky skin of Draco’s bump are the only hours of the day where I feel really alive. It’s as if the two of us melt into each other, and I forget that we’re two separate people. Our magic interweaves, and it tangles, and every fibre of my being urges me to close the space between us. I wonder if Draco feels the same? He is a master of cool meticulous silence and I swear that he closes his mind to me with Occlumency. He holds his body as still as a statue beneath my hands and schools his face with passive indifference.
“So I take in many very mundane things. Like magicked tea services, quills, household utensils, instruments. But sometimes I get the interesting stuff like family jewellery or looking glasses, enhanced with sometimes the most wonderous spellwork. You see, these things are often inherited over generations on end, and charms have changed over time. Not only which ones are used, but also
I watched Draco, fascinated, as he greeted Teddy. He ruffled his cousin’s turquoise hair, asking him serious questions about his life and listened, captivated by the answers.
“It’s not that funny!” Draco snapped after a minute or so of Harry’s cruel treatment. “I’m only glad my predicament has afforded you so much hilarity! My problems, however, get considerably worse. Pansy would like you to come for Sunday lunch tomorrow.”
“My Saviour,” Draco whispered. “There’s never been a man as good to me as you are, Harry. Sometimes I think I could tell you anything, and you wouldn’t judge me.”
“Funny drug stories mostly,” Harry replies.
,” Draco answered, pushing a droplet of condensation across the bar with the pad of his finger. “And I’m not their biggest fan, simply the one with the deepest pockets.” In spite of himself, Draco made a self-deprecating snort. “And shouldn’t you be somewhere signing autographs or posing for a solid-gold statue? Isn’t that what Saviours are supposed to do with their time?”
"Don't," Draco says. "I get it." After a moment, he mutters, voice half-muffled by his arm across his face. "I've always been out to get your attention."
“Magic,” Draco says. “He’s magical. Enchanting even if you prefer to stick to the metaphorical sense of the word. And you two-“ Draco looks between them, finding fear. Fear of being judged, fear of being hurt by him and the boy. He feels childishly petulant, frustrated. He turns to the uncle. “Yes, he’s bent. And
They end up writing a short letter in which Harry apologises for being absent. He asks a few questions about school and Quidditch, and he also tells Teddy that, if he liked, they could see each other in his Christmas holidays.
Draco’s smile grew bigger at that. He looked very much in love when he said, “And without you I couldn’t imagine being enough to make anyone feel safe and loved. I very much thought these days were a thing of the past. You give me that strength, Harry.” His voice a whisper, he added, “Somehow, it was always you.”
The thing is, dear diary, I’ve always wanted a family of my own. I suppose that a Mind Healer would say I’m a big cliché. The boy without parents wanting more than anything to have a family of his own. There’s an excess of love inside of me, I’m flooded with it, drenched and overwhelmed. Jules had to tell me to get my head in the game yesterday – I’d nearly chiselled off a finger – and he shook his head. “You’ve got it bad,” he said, scoffing at me. “I hope he’s worth it.”
,” he said. “
“You know,” Nick says casually after he took his place on the settee again, picking up his book and burying his nose in it. “You know, we should see Gorgoroth. They’re having a huge tour this year, and the shows look bloody amazing. They have sheep heads on stage, and real naked people who stand there, tied to a cross—it's completely mental. Oh, and also, you know, the singer is out and proud. Pretty much the only bent bloke in the black metal scene. Or at least I can’t think of another one.”
The woman gives a laugh. She takes a long drag from her smoke and her eyes twinkle with amusement. “You’re good. Convincingly authentic and humble.”
“I’m sorry to bother you on this fine afternoon, sir,” Draco says because Potter’s new-found silence won’t get them anywhere. “I’m Unspeakable Malfoy. We’re here on Ministry business as you might have figured by now.”
“So who is
only because you consider me family.” It was a slightly (very) stupid thing to say. But it’s always at the back of my mind when I’m feeling low that, forever after Hogwarts, Harry is only friendly with me because we’re somewhat related through Teddy.
During their restorations and mending furniture in the Manor, they listened to Muggle records in the small, cosy parlour whenever they took a break or called it a day. They made themselves at home in the drawing room that has a Floo connection to Draco’s new atelier on the edge of the Manor grounds. It's in a building that used to be a gatehouse.
“Is that a compliment?” Harry probes with a grin and a mouthful of chips.
” Draco yelled into Harry's ears that he's never seen or heard anything better. At the side of the fire-breathing stage, their mouths crushed together in between black-clad Muggles swaying their long hair like pendulums to music close to an incantation. Later that night, Draco confessed how he liked the dark aesthetic, and he asked Harry, "
Standing, the pair of us swapped places. I stood beneath the gush of water and rinsed my face and hair. Draco pushed his bottom backwards, nudging my prominent erection.
He wakes again, and he remembers how his heart was pounding too heavily in his chest the last time he woke. Even with concentrated scrutiny, the feeling seems to be gone. Harry sits up, and it feels like every muscle has to defy every known law of physics to do so. He doesn’t move through air, but through cotton in the one moment and through an oppressive flood in the next. Guilt and shame loom inside of him, so deep inside that it’s hard to imagine the feeling gone. A tight clasp around his heart, his lungs, and he feels paralysed but isn’t, not really.
“You are?” Hermione asks, but somehow Harry can’t shake the feeling that she already knew. “How did that happen?” And Harry goes on to explain, realising that he has never actually told Hermione that he likes men because, back in the day, he was too afraid that she’d judge his weekend-escapades. Because, back then, sex was something that only happened drunk and, more often than not, not even in a bed.
He’ll stay. He’ll try to stay.
Bonfire Night – already a month ago – still fills every one of my daydreams. Sometimes I convince myself that I dreamt the whole thing. That Draco actually kissed me – not gorgeous, muscley James Evans but
“The customs and taxes are low to promote competition,” Percy concedes, sounding outraged. “What the trade agreement is aiming to achieve is a better awareness in wixen who can afford the better, possibly homemade broom to pay the extra Galleon for it.”
“Stuart told me everything,” Cormac continued. “Told me how you’re trying to pin your bastard on him, when it could be one of a hundred men that laid it on you! Told me how you’d cried rape when you were gagging for it!” Cormac poked Draco in the shoulder, hard and painful. “Fitzgerald has to leave England, leave the Arrows, and it’s all because of you, Malfoy! He's had to take a job in America to escape your lies.”
“But how does one operate technology when it seems to be so complicated with all these-” Draco gestures in search of words- “this
It was the first time anyone had said it. Fitzgerald hadn’t listened. He’d heard Draco’s words, but he’d taken exactly what he wanted. Pansy hadn’t listened either. Nobody had wanted to hear Draco’s wretched little tale. His friends weren’t bothered, not now he wasn’t ever amusing or popular.
“Obviously.”
Draco felt another traitorous tear spill down his cheek.
enough. Remember what I said when you first arrived? That the magic and treatment of a male pregnancy is noticeably different to that of a witch? Before long you’re going to need that other father. It doesn’t matter how many other men you’ve laid on your back for, Muggle
“But of course.” Her voice sounds composed again. “As the last survivors of our respective lines, it’s a matter of decorum to support each other, Lord Malfoy. I shall hope that there’s a Lady Malfoy to be? You must be past the proper age to bond.”
Bloody hell, but I’m hardly likely to sleep. My partner – the father of my baby – is ill and I don’t know what to do with myself. I’m too keyed up to eat and I need to be able to get back to St Mungo’s immediately whenever Draco needs me for anything at all.
Draco picked up another couple of leaflets, added them to his pile, and then he walked away, as quick as his legs could carry him.
When Draco goes on explaining how, precisely, charms are embedded into woods and metals, and what a huge difference such materials make—
Harry raises his eyebrows at him. “Do I?”
And I’m sick again.
canteen. He felt heavy and sluggish as if he’d aged a decade in three months. Draco felt
“Bloody hell,” he pronounced, grinning incredulously. “I’m exhausted just thinking about your life, Potter. You’re always on the go! So, did the two get together on one of your adventures? Let’s hear all the ghastly romantic clichés and don’t spare the details. Malfoy will only blab them when he’s had a few too many glasses of booze anyway. He’s always been the worst sort of lightweight-”
Death although even that is quite questionable. You were a child when-“ Harry makes himself stop speaking. Draco’s eyes went wide while he talked so frantically, and Harry’s grip is tight on Draco’s arm where the Dark Mark is hidden below his sleeve, always hidden except in bed where Harry still tries to look at everything except the scars crossing Draco’s chest and the pebbled outlines of what used had been branded into the soft inside of Draco’s arm by Voldemort himself.
And now that the idea settles in that the plum will be safe because we do have the other father’s magic – what are my biggest regrets and worries now? I feel indignant that Potter’s lie takes him away from me. That his lie takes away waking up next to someone I love and respect, have someone to hug close in my sleep, bloody amazing sex, … I’m so pathetic. I can’t believe that I’m lovesick for that git, or the person that I thought I might know. Everything we had is gone and for once, it’s not even my fault.
Still, actions spoke louder than words.
“You randy git.”
It was an unmistakable
As it always seems to be the case with Potter and me, things didn’t exactly go as planned. When I wanted to pick him up, he was still working on a broom, and he was happy to show and explain to me some details about the process. I do know that there are better brooms out there, but it was nice to see him so invested in his work. I always forget how crafty and creative he is because I hardly ever see him do anything in the backroom of the shop. When I come into Phoenix, he’s often standing behind the till or he’s counselling customers about the benefits of different broomstick models.
"When in doubt, it shall be the Sonos," Tarquin prompts without looking up from the book he’s reading. He’s lying on the settee, legs crossed at the ankles, book held up in an uncomfortable position. Judith sounds excited at the idea, and her friend's head—Harry forgot her name, but it might be Lynn or Kim or something—her head perks up at the mention of the club as well. It’s not a huge nightclub, but it is one of their regulars. Harry likes the idea. They’d find everything they need; it all flows freely there—drinks, loud music, MDMA, mephedrone, coke. It’d be a perfect night. Exhausting perhaps, but it’s exactly what he’ll need after the weird down he’s having. He remembers how oddly alone he felt this morning with all his friends just a few feet away. The thrill of music, a pleasant upper in his system, ideally somewhere to talk the night away with Tarquin after being sweaty and breathless from dancing for hours on end—that sounds just perfect.
“I don't see why not,” Draco replies, eyes flickering over Harry as though to check if he’s okay with that. The little gesture seizes Harry with unexpected intensity. Teddy’s small smile splits into a happy grin.
Harry didn’t attack him though.
“But it’s not my fault when they kick us out,” I replied.
Harry is silent for a moment. He steals a sip of Draco’s whisky, relishing the smooth taste for a moment on his tongue before swallowing it. They hardly ever fight. In fact, Draco hardly reacts these days when Harry happens to lash out at him, annoyed at himself or Draco or at nothing in particular. And sometimes it drives Harry mad that he could land blow after blow without sparking any sign of resistance in Draco, until Harry feels alone and guilty.
And that was when I saw the man that I wanted.
A squeal and a
“Someone’s a dark horse!” Theo said, clapping Draco squarely in the middle of his back. “The Saviour himself! Only you could have pulled that one off Malfoy, you sly dog. I'm astonished that the
I unbuttoned his shirt and mimicked him by running my hand across his chest, slowly and tenderly. It is quite an attractive part of a man; I’ll give him that. And his pecs were nice and taut under my touch. Not too muscled, but well-defined.
“And your point is?” Arthur asks. “It happens to the cheap models. Not because they are cheap as in
I imagined scooting even closer until I felt the tingle of his Warming Charm mixing with my own. And we would have entangled our arms, would have let our temples rest against each other. We would have watched the scintillating fireworks together in a reverent silence.
“I’ve not seen you look this dismal since school,” Harry said, as soon as the barman had left them alone. He poured them both a shot. “You clearly need to talk, and I’ve nowhere better to be. Spill your potion, and while you’re at it, could you do me the kindness of calling me
It felt odd that he was already beginning to show. The night of Oliver’s party was so seared into his consciousness that it might have been the day before. Juxtaposed, the last three months were ethereal, a half-remembered dream.
and not one single mention in the Prophet gossip columns, Draco! I’m shocked beyond belief. I’ll admit I did make a little wager with Daph. The witch is convinced you've been holed up in St Swithins Crescent bonking some gorgeous new chap you’d got the hots for and I wholeheartedly concur.” Pansy placed her teacup back in its saucer with a neat little click before picking up a Cauldron Cake with dainty fingers. “He must be
How odd. Part of me feels like it must still be 2000, the year I earned my very first own money. I remember trying to use the Muggle transportation because I was drunk and bored one night. The plan was to get to the outskirts of London by Tube and then Apparate home to the Zabinis. As most nights in London, however, I was sucked into the nightlife, and I didn’t make it home until the sun came up.
“You don’t need to get it up to feel good,” Draco says, back to his sex-voice. “Just let me take care of you, darling. And stop forcing yourself, alright? Kiss me.”
“For a while?” Harry prompts, playful, tugging at Draco and half-heaving him off the mattress until he’s half-lying on top of Harry and the both of them giggle like love-drunk idiots.
“Harry!” Draco said, turning to face me, his voice full of dismay. “You got me in this condition, Harry, so really you ought to be a
, but it’s also equipped with nifty charms that are hardly in use today, at least not in this old-fashioned way. The charms are almost similar to house magic and provide the simple habitat with a certain warmth and humidity, depending on the intricate needs of a phoenix. The birds thrive in different temperatures and prefer different air moistures depending on their Burn Day cycle. And on their Burn Day, the copper is charmed to keep the ashes scorching hot which is the best temperature for phoenix fledglings.
You were checked over while the Mediwizard brought us tea and toast, and Healer Bartsch pronounced himself very pleased with you. “The procedure went perfectly, and little Cassiopeia Lily Malfoy-Potter here is as healthy as can be. Two days in hospital, I think, just to double check that there aren’t any lingering effects on your magic, and then you can go home. Draco, please do take it easy for the next few weeks. Your body has been through a lot, and it needs time to return to normal.”
“I know what you’ve got planned,” Draco hissed. “You’ve got everyone fooled with your nice-man act! It’s bollocks! It’s all fucking bollocks! You can’t just fuck me, Potter. I can say no!” He felt a tear roll down his cheek. “I’m saying no!” Harry took another step forward and Draco braced himself for Harry's magic. Maybe he’d use a Stinging Hex or a
Draco got tired of waiting for a reply.
The garden is full of life and colour during the season of change. The days are drenched in rain by the end of October, and on a mild, golden day like today, the dampness doesn’t fully leave the air. There are still vibrant blooms in several of the flower beds, sparks of pinks and violets through the mushy leaves and skies of autumn as though they are defying their coming end. A few pumpkins grow next to the small greenhouse right at the fence. Birds, hedgehogs, toads make their appearance if one is only quiet and observant enough.
In the kitchen Harry finds the bloke whose name was John, brooding over a newspaper, but smiling amiably when Harry comes in. He gets coffee and even a sandwich, is offered an aspirin, and Harry feels a bit like John might actually be a wizard and very well aware of who he was talking to, courteous as he is.
With a sudden, unsuspected force, he retches, but nothing comes up. He tries to cast a Healing Charm to no avail. After taking another deep breath, Harry gets to his feet, watching the room tilt sideways as he falls back on the bed. He stands up again, head pulsing with each step that he takes over to the bathroom door.
We’re just back home, and Harry has a spot of sleep at the moment. After we cuddled for a few minutes, I got up and started unpacking some of our things to get the laundry going. Well, Harry’s diary made it into my hands. I won’t even try to claim I had no idea what it was. I haven’t ever seen him write in it, but Harry had just told me that he does write down what’s on his mind, even more so since he’s spoken to his Mind Healer again.
He wanted to use his fingers first, but I insisted that he should lube his prick up nice and well for me, no prep. Circe, but I won’t forget the way he looked at me then. So completely and openly turned on, his lips parted, giving me a docile nod. Usually I would have gladly accepted, but I knew this bloke would be careful not to rip me apart. And that’s exactly how it went. I lay on my stomach, James on top, and his arms were aligned with mine as he pushed inside of me, breaching me inch by inch, and it felt so good and careful, yet more decisive than that guy has been the whole evening.
Not able to suppress a soft chuckle, Harry smiles against the few pecks Draco presses to his lips, into his stubble. They don’t talk for a few minutes; they just look at each other, fingers tracing faces, hair, and arms.
The Healer coughed discreetly and pulled me out of my reverie. “If you could sit down,” he asked, gesturing to a chair beside the bed, “and lay your hands on Draco’s skin? You don’t need to cast a spell; the baby instinctively feeds from it. Please try not to move around too much. A steady flow of magic is best for everyone.”
– but I can’t seem to help myself. Draco and I are talking – even laughing, sometimes – and I simply can’t believe that I’ve been given this second chance to make things right. Hermione had told me that I won’t be getting a second one, and that I’m the luckiest wizard on Merlin’s green Earth.
“Perhaps I shouldn’t say it then,” Draco says coolly.
Now it was Draco’s turn to nod frantically, and he was the one to take the step forwards, right below the shower head, and he pressed the entirety of his body, clothes drenched in warm water and cum against Harry’s body, whispering how beautiful Harry was naked, and that he was sorry, and that this felt so amazing.
Harry listened intently, and I was tempted to go into all the details, but I broke it down to, “Yes, I’m safe, and I’m taking care of us.”
The afternoon was a pleasant one. Teddy and Draco played a few rounds of Exploding Snap, and then we ate a light lunch of sandwiches and more cake. By the end of our food, Draco was visibly weary, and – after he had yawned for a second time – was dispatched to the settee with me by his side. Andi left us to sit with Teddy while she set Cleaning Charms.
“You alright there, mate?” Harry asks him, trying to find water for his friend. He can conjure some—Tarquin is probably too pissed to notice anyway.
With the Burrow out of sight and only the pale
“You sure you don’t want to spend the night in your bed? Have a nice tea, watch some telly, catch up on some sleep?”
Harry isn’t sure whether Draco means that people are going to talk about
“Well, yes. Erm . . . See, it’s a bit like these Euphoria Potions?” Harry remembers taking one. It was okay, but not as exciting as ecstasy, not as compelling as mephedrone, and not as empowering as cocaine. Not as blissful as opioids.
“Then you do it,” Harry says, reaching around Draco to grab the shampoo. “You have a much steadier hand and a better eye for such things.” A little smile plays around Draco’s lips. That’s probably exactly how he imagined this conversation to go. And it leads them to Harry, being seated on a Transfigured stool in the bathroom under the charmed light that was brighter than the daylight of the past few gloomy weeks combined, and to Draco in front of him, clad in just a simple tee-shirt and his boxers, a magical razor in his secure hands.
Spending time with Ron that day feels familiar and refreshingly special all the same, and when Harry gets home, feeling like he ought to tell Draco all about it, he doesn’t feel sad but happy; happy that he has someone that he wants to share all these thoughts with. The joy of sharing happiness
My colleagues at Phoenix know that something has changed. My boss, Jules – thirty-three, a brain-box Ravenclaw, as sharp as a hex – thinks that I’m courting and has teased me about it when we’ve been employed together in the broomstick workshop, polishing and waxing the wood to a high gleam. “Who’s the lucky man?” he asked me only yesterday. “Don’t think you’ve got us fooled, Potter. You’ve been staring off into space, mind a million miles away. Is he a wizard or a Muggle? Spill the beans! When do we get to meet this Mr Mysterious?”
The sad truth is that I’M the one taking advantage. Every day that Draco lives here, at Grimmauld Place, is another day that I get to look after him. That’s all I want from my life. All I want is my family – Draco and our plum – here beside me, where I can take care of them. I have to appreciate it while I can. As soon as Draco finds out the truth – that I’m James Evans – and that I was his client, then he’ll hate me. This bubble of happiness will burst, and I’ll be alone once again.
Draco shrugs. “It was covered in my pre-Hogwarts education. Not everything got engraved into my grey matter, but I know a thing or two about the old wizarding families. Besides . . .” he smiles to himself, “I was immensely proud to be related to the legendary Harry Potter when I was a young lad. Very distantly, but- Well, we both show up here.”
I do what I do. I haven’t thought of that before I-“
Their routine today is slightly different though. It’s Easter and while stepping into the shower together, rinsing off sleep, sweat, and drying cum, Draco says, “Today’s the day, love. Time to tame that monstrosity growing off your face.”
The thing about having a nice, perfectly well-timed and functioning rhythm as a young family was that changes that didn’t evolve around Daisy developing a new need, a new schedule, a new tooth were hard to initiate.
As time passed, trust developed. Draco even found himself able to mention the bump. Once he told Harry that he’d felt them wriggle a little, while he’d been in the shower. Harry had been delighted. “You’re getting bigger,” he’d remarked, and that much was true.
“I haven’t told anyone,” Draco confessed. “You’re the first, Potter. You ought to feel honoured.” He made an awful noise, half-sob and half-snort. “I’ll bet you think it could be one of a
They stare at each other for an unnerving minute.
Malfoy needs a moment to answer, humming contemplatively. “Must be four years now. Or five? No, it was in the summer of 2006.” After a moment, he speaks. “I can’t believe you didn't know. It was all over the news when I came back to England and inherited the Manor.”
Salazar, but I almost let on how exhausted I was from the night before. That client had some very fixed ideas on the positioning he wanted. My thighs feel so incredibly sore that standing up from the settee seems hardly worth it. Greg and I even lost the two on two versus Blaise and Astoria because every movement is sheer torture. And I’m seeing Tom tomorrow after his work – that git will certainly have a good laugh at me while he ties me up.
Eventually, Harry picks up his earlier thought. “I just meant that I’m used to doing so many things the Muggle way that I don’t even think about using magic a lot.”
It turned out that a glamour was hardly necessary when you’re amid a dozen or so wixen, all of them hooded in similar black robes. They are gathered on top of a hill which is likely not all that tall, but every elevation looks tall when you’re in Wiltshire. A huge bonfire lit the very top.
But there’s another reason why St Mungo’s is problematic. Even in my loose robes, my condition is becoming patently obvious. The
Harry draws in a nervous breath, his thoughts with the same words spoken in another voice. The crowd of people feels too much, too loud, but Harry endures the overwhelming sensation. It’s Carol who hugs him so fiercely that he has to catch his own breath after she lets go. “You. Are. A lifesaver,” she says, and then turns towards everyone who would listen. “Potter, the great Saviour. He’s incredible, isn’t he? It’s just a month or so ago that this lady had a seizure or something, and Potter here was the only one level-headed enough to pull out this ancient Nokia he has and call an ambulance.”
Now that they sit in their chic drawing room, their house in nearby Lacock cleared and sold, a half-full bottle of wine between them, and a Gorillaz song on the wireless, Harry feels alright with the world. “We’re making this our home,” he says.
Incredulously, Harry gives a laughter. “Yes, but- I mean, it was a few Hogwarts students going to London
Draco didn’t though. Instead, he shifted his body, and reached up. Draco curled his fingers around my pec, squeezing ever so slightly, and then he closed the space between us. He brushed the lightest of kisses on my own, his lips hot, sweet, and flawless.
Unlike usually, they are on their way quite early. The last minutes of sunlight paint the dull, grey streets in rich colours, the asphalt gleaming as though it was gilded, while they walk towards the Tube station. Harry smiles when he spots the first folk that look like they have the same destination; people wearing cut-offs and shirts with art and logos on them, some of whom Harry recognises.
“Ah, tosh. Wizards are a cheap bunch. Only buy what they know.”
They prepare breakfast together and they work in the atelier or the house. They sometimes get lazy or distracted with each other up to the point that Draco has to rise early in the morning to get his commissions finished in time. They read together, and they listen to music and talk about every subject under the sun while doing so. They sometimes end up making out on the settee or dancing together in the drawing room and, sometimes, Harry would faintly think how their fun could be enhanced by a few grams of snow-white powder. They make a habit out of using Draco’s sex toy. Harry has never felt more wanted than in those moments Draco looks at him with dilated pupils, his movements slow and idle as though he wants to slow Harry down and never in his life do anything else again than have Harry orgasm for him.Draco himself often stays utterly untouched until Harry begs him to get one of their pricks into the other one’s arse.
They are both breathing heavily. Harry holds onto his arms, holds on tightly, expels a breath as though he has held it for the past ten minutes. Harry looks at him with a desperate hope in his eyes that Draco can’t bear to See right now. He brings their lips together, lingers in the firm touch of just their mouths, connecting without much movement.
meant for Harry to stay out. But the problem with the bathroom was that it harboured nappies, talcum powder and barrier cream for Daisy, and other stuff Draco seemed to be in constant search of. So instead of having Draco pound at the door, Harry just left it open, just a tad, and Harry told Draco that he didn’t mind him barging in unannounced.
While the Granger-Weasleys put Rose to bed at some point and Harry and I were left to ourselves in the drawing room with coke light, tortilla chips and a fruit salad that looked like a very meagre attempt of adding something healthy to the little buffet, I vaguely announced that I wanted to talk with him about something. Alone. Harry just nodded for them.
Because that’s what’s on his mind. Draco’s pristine appearance and his thin wrists and strong hands and whatever lies hidden inside those hot Muggle jeans. It’s all about that, and not about the scars that make Harry feel sick or the way Draco quietly sings along to the Wireless or how all Harry can think of is the way Draco’s face crumples when he laughs. Especially when Draco looks troubled and nervous, the contrast to Draco’s happy face seems to always be on the forefront of Harry’s mind.
In the bathroom, however, Harry tried to be as considerate and as sensitive as he possibly could. He didn’t want to catch Draco naked, or see anything else Draco didn’t want to share.
When the feeling of a dry climax accelerates again, Harry groans, wrenching himself off Draco’s mouth for a second to blurt out, “Fuck me.”
He finds Carol who already starts glancing at her watch because it’s getting late and she apparently has work in the morning. “You really ought to tell me your secret at some point, Potter. Spending all this money without a job. You’re not the old money type.” Harry is fairly certain that by
It was an odd moment. Harry was smiling, eyes trimmed on the plum whom we had seen for the first time only an hour or so ago. I felt overwhelmed with a ton of unfathomable feelings, looking down at my body and seeing Potter’s face, affectionate and vulnerable over my bare skin, over my child. And his magic. I felt it. A soft prickle that streamed over the swell, gently lapping and receding at my sides.
“I won’t ogle you,” Draco said with an embarrassed smile. “Is this awkward? Am I weird?”
Daisy had been kind enough to give the two of them a morning lay-in, and Harry had gifted Draco a box of his favourite Cauldron Cakes and a gorgeous new jumper. Draco had beamed, delighted with his treat, and he pulled it straight over his head.
Draco loved playing up to his reputation. He loved dressing up in revealing clothes and showing off. He looked great, he was fit, and he knew the effect that he had on men. Draco loved flirting. He loved the way that suave, sophisticated men went to pieces under a few small touches or a well-timed double entendre. Draco had spent too many years playing Lucius’s good boy, playing the perfect pure-blood heir, and now, with that arsehole locked up in Azkaban, Draco wanted to have fun. Draco wanted to have a good time.
Yesterday, I tried to tell Draco this. I knew he wouldn’t listen to my words – that’s fair – but I hoped if I wrote it down, he might read it, and consider that my original motivations weren’t evil. I wrote that I was stupid and randy and bashful, and I didn’t think that I was good enough for Draco. I’ve proved that much to myself, haven’t I? I’m not good enough for Draco. He’s worth ten of me, which were the exact words that I used.
Things would be a tad easier if James had mailed me again. I ought to keep my appointments open just in case he's in London and wants to arrange a date. I’d chug down all the potions in existence for that. Decent chap, huge pay-off – I’d prioritise him anytime.
“Yeah, aren’t you two . . .?” Teddy asks carefully.
“I’m not a victim,” Draco answered. “I had something terrible happen to me, something that changed me, but I refuse to let that define who I am. I’m Daisy’s dad now, and Harry’s boyfriend. I’m
Some of Draco’s punters like to tie him up or humiliate him. Draco says that he’s an actor, playing a role and simply giving them a good time but, as I find I can't stop saying, I’ve fallen in love with him. I can’t abide the idea of him actually,
Pulling his wand out from his jumper sleeve, Draco flashed it through the air. He Disapparated from the pitiful calamity that his life had become.
Draco retrieves the phial from his robes, showing it to Harry again. Harry doesn’t say anything. The trapped magic floats through it’s narrow confines, looking sombre on first sight but glittering with all the colours if Draco concentrates long enough on it, saves it from intrusive light that marrs the intrinsic shine. “It’s yours,” Draco points out stubbornly. “A dissociated singularity of your magic. How did that happen?”
And that was that. I held Draco through another contraction, and then I rushed off to Firecall Healer Bartsch. The caesarean was to take place at St Mungo’s and he wanted us to get there as soon as we could, but not to take the risk of Flooing or Apparating. Travelling via wizarding methods would do Draco more harm than good.  That was fine. Blaise had use of a magicked car as part of his posh Ministry job and had agreed to pick us up whenever we needed it.
As we watched Rose build a tower out of little blocks and Hermione proudly announced that she stacked it higher two more blocks than was average for her age, I began to wonder about my future. Whether I would have friends coming over to visit me and the plum, renouncing flashy parties and fun company just to spend a quiet evening in a small circle of close intimates. I would actually love that. More than I had imagined possible. And it’s so different from the way I grew up. Potter even handles Rose as though she was his own, much like he’s always done with Teddy.
being empathic, sounding deeply saddened as though Remus was his loss as well.
been Draco. Images force themselves upon his mind. Of the Weasleys, of Andromeda. Of Ron and Hermione even. All of them patient and understanding and loving because, found family or not, it’s what they have to do. Love him they do. That’s what they’ve proven their whole lives and especially when Harry reentered said lives. They accept him being broken, being with Draco Malfoy, being unable to lead that life that his generation calls

A flash and there’s a funeral. Harry looks devastated. Pale, skin waxen, posture displaying every bit the despair that I know he feels. I feel nothing.
“I’d love to,” Harry replies in a low voice, complying with the kiss Draco wordlessly requests.
, Harry spends a minute looking at that odd Muggle painting in the living room, watching how this bloke’s head is consumed by darkness as thick as Instant Darkness Powder. Then he looks at the bookshelf and at a few apparatuses standing on top of an antique commode, ever-circling and moving, and Harry recognises it as an old-fashioned model of wizarding device that depicts the lunar cycle. Harry taps it with his wand, and it rotates until it stops, showing the thin crescent of today’s waning moon, just a few days past new moon.
“Yeah,” Harry mutters. “Yeah, I guess I should . . .”
“Don’t be.” Draco sounds calm and collected. “I don’t mind having you to myself for a while. Did you like the surprise? Did you enjoy your day?”
“Oh right, I did that.”
Lazily entangled and naked, we lay there, and had a light-hearted talk about earlier. I finally apologised for having been such a pain in the arse before, and Harry only quipped, “I dearly hope that I wasn’t a pain in
Only Harry had seen his suffering. Boring, staid old Potter had been the only one to see that his life had splintered, had shattered, into a billion little pieces. The truth rose unbidden, and two words slipped out of his mouth before he had a chance to rein them in.
Teddy was bewildered, but he was far too interested in eating to delve into Draco’s words. Andi cautiously changed the subject, talking about the Ministry, and how it was high time that the various elf reforms they were debating were passed. I tuned out. Hermione was the driving force behind these new laws, and though I approved of them wholeheartedly, I’d already repeatedly heard about them in forensic detail. All I could bring myself to do was puzzle over Draco’s enigmatic words. I wished, fervently, that he’d confide in me.
“I Side-Alonged you here,” Malfoy says. As though he could read Harry’s thoughts, he sounds a little nervous and rushes out his words in a seemingly uncharacteristic way that Harry doesn’t recognise. “Saw you in the lobby, and I thought,
“But I always say that they know what they get themselves into,” the man goes on, staring ahead wide-eyes, finger digging into his knees. His jaw works heavily for the moment he pauses. “That they’ll have to follow the contract and all that. Say what they gotta say, do what they gotta do. Not my fault they’re naïve.”
