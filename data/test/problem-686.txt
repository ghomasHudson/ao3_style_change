“I’m not much of a wordsmith, as you can probably tell from my rambling stories,” Harry replied, with a chuckle tucked into the warm fondness in his voice, “But hopefully you’ll find it in yourself, your real self, to forgive me, and,”
“Deflection aside,” because that had been what he was doing, the entire time, “We’re going to have to work through all of this. Because we haven’t even gotten to the testimony of the trial and I want... I want this to be something we either do together or not at all. As much as I love Rebecca, I can’t lose you in the process.” There it was. The fear out in the open. Somehow, Harry was still the only one who understood it, even after all the deception and the lying by omission. He didn’t know how he could be so lucky to be so in love and so
“I was sleeping in one of the sleeping bags we used on the run, angry at myself, unable to handle the inactivity, hating everything. I knew I needed to buy things— furniture, food, so on but some— some small part of me is still that boy in the cupboard, watching the rest of the world through the slats on the door and wishing. I couldn’t bring myself to take up space. All I kept doing was watching the sun go past and thinking about, well, everything. And at some point, I thought of you.” Draco inhaled sharply.
end of the war, after the last of the major skirmishes with the remaining groups of Death Eaters, the holdouts who didn’t believe it was over or didn’t want it to be over, content to watch the destruction around them with relish, had been dealt with. He didn’t know much about it, becoming a recluse for his year of punishment (to be forbidden to use magic) after the first series of trials, his ‘wand’ (though there was none) was confiscated in some vault somewhere. People had testified on both sides, but, as the Prophet reported (back before the takeover) it all came down to a single testimony. Harry Potter, calm and tired in his pitch black robes, his voice hoarse from making sure that no deed, good or bad, went unacknowledged, stood up before the Wizegamot and told how, against all odds, Draco himself was a small but crucial part of the plan to stop Voldemort, orchestrated by both Dumbledore and Severus and executed by none other than the Boy Who Lived, after Draco’s change of heart in the final hours. It was all very dramatic.
“What?” It takes him a moment and the stares of half the other people in chairs to calm down enough to answer but eventually he straighten a up with a pop of his spine.
Here’s how they meet Rebecca McIntyre. They’re talking back and forth, chatting about almost nothing at all (though Draco would be loathe to admit his hair amounts to nothing, particularly how Harry could spend hours running his hands through it when watching telly) when the little girl who was sleeping on Harry looks up at them apropos of nothing, with giant brown-green-hazel eyes and says plain as day in a thick Irish accent, “Am I like you now?”
“In order...” he started and stopped a few times, trying to form the words, “In order for the protection magic to work, I needed to be taken in by family, after my parents were murdered.” His tone was a hair closer to clinical then personal. A terrifying prospect. He had seen people in the aftermath of the war lose all sense of time and space, detach from the terrible reality, knowing it wasn't healthy but finding no others options for survival.
to help and handle an emotionally distraught five year old?!” Lacey had stopped struggling now, the warm rain a shock to her system as she stood there numbly between them. “It’s
“I know.” Harry licked his lips, they were red in the chill air. “Draco… I’m sorry about your father. I don’t think you’re like him at all and I definitely
For the first time since starting this job, Draco laughed and with it, felt lighter than he had since receiving the note. He had a lunch date to make.
He paused, giving it some thought, wondering if he could delay the inevitable. Then shook his head. “It seems straightforward to me.”
—“ They teetered for a second, his heart stopping as he realized there was only a scant few feet between his head and the tile floor, but by the grace of some god, stayed upright.
“The home study is scheduled for next week?” He nodded. He was nervous about that, having a stranger in their home to judge them. It being someone from the Irish Ministry and under Loreen's thumb didn’t help his nerves. He felt the book he had in his expanded coat pocket for comfort.
When he had made his unintentionally dramatic entrance, Harry had instantly bounded over to him, looking for all intents and purposes like an overly excitable dog and greeted him with a loud, “Draco! You made it, I was starting to worry,” which if his entrance hadn’t turned heads that most certainly had. And then, as if they were publicly close and dear friends, had given him a
“There is a man, but I’m not ashamed of it. I’m actually,” he collected himself slightly, “I’m actually ending it today...” He felt the shame and sadness roll through him like waves, a storm over the ocean of unsaid things.
“Hmm.” He wasn’t sure that he wanted to continue this deep and scalding dig through the past but he could agree there: Rebecca did not deserve any sort of physical punishment. Even the few times Father had slapped him would have been enough to turn him off of the idea but this cemented it. And if you were willing to hit someone you were supposed to love and protect, then what else could you be capable of?
“Not much money in being an heir these days,” he admits, returning to the teacups, making them look, for all intents and purposes, like two strangers and not something else. “I work with Blaise at his firm—it’s like curse breaking, specifically dark magic. There’s a lot of it left lying around.”
“Perish the thought,” he drawled in return, “Then you’d only be with my memory insulting you for company.” But he walked closer, until their arms were nearly flush as they walked, “In all seriousness, that’s good. Let me... Let me know if you need an opinion. Or an ear,” And he had zero idea how to be supportive, particularly while drunk, so he floundered on the next part, “Or something.” How did one accurately describe the delicacy that was being wanted, specifically by the one you cared about. The one you would go to awkward outings to pubs with and share maudlin memories with. Harry gave him all of that and more, only asking his opinion in return when Draco would find a way to give him the sun and stars if he could. How inarticulate words were when love was involved.
He had changed quite a bit since the war, but then a lot of them had. Harry Potter, the Chosen One,  was taller, a slight bit more well fed, a bit less hunted in how he stood, but without the arrogance that Draco had seen or remembered seeing in their school years. Even his scar was slightly faded, covered in part by his ever unruly hair. His eyes covered by better glasses, probably recommended by his ex-girlfriend or maybe Granger, and probably the latter based on the sheer nagging capabilities, assuming that at least in any weird universe he was living in that
what that woman would do.” He remembered how it was and how it is. It was awful, to see the difference in their days become muted and desaturated and quiet. But this, this was at least alive.
“You forget, America is much larger with a much higher population of people, it stands to reason that they’d have a higher number of witches and wizards.”
“Yeah, and it was wonderful to know even that about my dad, but at the same time… I felt as if I didn’t do well in Quidditch or didn’t love it enough, I was letting him down.”
He nearly slapped him, it was so near a thing and he wondered how they’d gotten here. Only the sight of Harry flinching, pure panic in his eyes had shocked them apart.
“Well Mr. Malfoy,” Cathleen says after a short pause where they confer notes, Draco trying not to think of what adjectives they’re using for him, “I must say this has been one of the most… interesting interviews I’ve worked on.”
“Hey,” Harry breathed, standing up to stand close to him, “I’m glad Ron caught you before you left.”
He got up with a sigh, heading to the kitchen to get some tea when there was a sharp banging at the door. And then shouting. And then the hinges gave a great creak and—
came Harry’s voice, unbidden into his mind. It had been a month since the conversation in the office and all he could think about was that they were far beyond last names now and even then all he could think of was the stupid bloody trial.
They stood like that, back to back, Draco providing the counter to every dark curse being shot their way, as if no time had passed since 1998, and Harry, powerful defeater of dark wizards, sent each one within range into a crumpled heap on the street, for a solid five minutes, there was only chanting, breathing and Draco shouting counter curses.
A perfectly average and wealthy one, born into the right circumstances. “I suppose I would have to talk it over with Harry, but I assume we would tell her if she asked or if she were old enough to understand all the nuances.”
Anyway, that was how they ended up in the one corner shop in all of Muggle London that seemed to have broken down.
“Do you need me?” The words tumbled out, tripping over themselves as they stood there, lightning flashing. He had to know.
no less, I could say the same of you, Draco Malfoy.” She finished her drink before neatly tucking the umbrella onto her hair artfully, “Don’t be a stranger at these things, we still need more evidence that there’s a bias against blondes.” And with that she ducked around him to get to the bar and passed Granger and Weasley with a trailing hand and as he watched her, he caught Harry’s eye and with how he was grinning, that made the last five minutes worth every other embarrassing moment that had accompanied it.
Harry Potter that he felt short of breath, “You’re right, it was a good explanation.” Harry smiled like he was watching the sunset, with the horizon somewhere behind Draco.
“So Westminster is a palace but it’s also the place where Parliament and Big Ben is.” Draco had a vague recollection of which buildings were which, but most of his topography consisted of bookstores, restaurants and the pubs they visited.
Then it was over and Father was ready to leave and the next chapter had started. Soon after that, she’d stopped hugging him tight before they left, preferring the gentle squeeze of his shoulder or the rubbing of his cheek or the brushing of his hair. They had never been a demonstrative family.
“I never... I never told Ginny that— how could I? She grew up with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley for parents, God she was
In all honesty, Draco blames himself. He hadn’t said anything. Hadn’t gotten up the courage to contradict Harry. He’d instead drifted behind the man like a ghost, darkening his doorway and foiling his simple story. The Outcast. The Other.
or more against a hundred thousand, he still couldn’t grasp the numbers of it. He had been one of them and while he left it behind, the world would remember. What part he had had in it and how many of that number were his. Unfettered darkness creeping up, a tangle of plants lurking nearby, waiting to pull more in. He wondered what they would think of him after they read through the to-be-completed parental fitness surveys.
She sobbed into his shoulder, mumbling and crying and warm. Draco felt all his body slowly stabilize after the spike of energy from the deflection, they were lucky that he’d had enough time to recognize the spell work. A favorite of Herringborn, the curse was a parting gift for whoever had survived the initial assault. It was nearly impossible to detect unless you were to last person to leave after the initial curses and, well, there wouldn’t be much left of you after. He’d seen it happen enough times to know the signs and knew he had a good chance of avoiding it but on the fly...
His gaze lifted up, wondering if anyone actually bought the ones on the highest shelves. Draco wasn’t quite sure what was so entrancing about the lights here—they weren’t torches, or flickering candlelight, a comforting sight of his childhood and his school years and one very terrifying incident during a heatwave vis a vis his punishment, and they definitely weren’t the obnoxious bright white lights of the muggle world. He wasn’t even sure why he always ended up here, roaming the open late rows of product supplied by the Patel family. Maybe he’d just found something he liked, that the store was anonymous enough that no one recognized him from the copies of the old Prophet or maybe they just didn’t care, such was the clientele. It was a good feeling, a strange but good feeling, to know that no one around you knew or cared who you were. It was freeing after a life of notoriety.
, of course, is a popular pattern of fabric / knitting / moasiacs /etc based on the bones of a fish, first used in the 1600s. I figured it was a fitting homage for a longstanding pureblood family. The others are just random names that sound sufficiently old.
Ostensibly as Harry had felt the need to order dessert at every restaurant they visited, they often ended up talking about it as they finished their meal or on the walk home. He ate dessert as often as he could, trying a variety of never-ending sweets that, while doing nothing to add to his waistline, left his lips sweet. At least that was something Draco could get behind. But on a hot summer night like this one, the hot puddings at the restaurant would have been unbearable. So naturally, they had to find something else.
“An orphan, like you... are...” she looks at both of them with a dazed look, “Is everyone really dead?”
Any time I use violent, all I can think of is someone whispering: “These violent delights have violent ends,” but in a Baz Luhrmann way and not in a Westworld way.
, and I’d sent in my resignation but they hadn’t done anything about it and we were at Luna’s—she’d just bought the New Prophet, and we were on her balcony talking about the bloody
“That’s okay.” It’s not a question, or an affirmation, simply a statement, a status of the things between them, stretching out like so many gossamer threads in the sunlight.
Even the weather looked fortuitous—fat flakes falling slowly where the biting wind and freezing rain had turned him rosy cheeked despite the warming charms. It was still and perhaps, cheekily because Draco was in
“Well. Let’s press on,” Harry said, an arm at Draco’s elbow, as if he were worried that he would leave, as they headed into the building and up to the top floor. The key opened the door smoothly and then they were inside and the lights went on with a flick.
“We will,” he agreed, kissing their clasped hands, “We’ll set a better example of how to communicate.”
“Think I’ve used all that up today already,” he says back, sitting heavily in the chair after Draco waves him off. He’d been grazed with a stunner earlier but nothing out of the ordinary for a fight. Harry had avoided all injury, aside from the initial explosions—lucky bastard, so he just adjusted her to the other side as he looked up at Draco, resting his head against the wall.
With a last flick, he removed the last ‘detonators’ of the curse several minutes later, sending the magic—garden and pureblood— whizzing up into the sky to fizzle out. He felt his pulse drop slowly,
“Reasonably weird,” Harry said in response, “I think that’s a fair assessment and a rather good phrase. I think it works well for us.” Draco nodded, heart hammering oddly at the thought that they were
a mom, because she missed her own but she still wanted to do cool things. Molly would love to spoil her. That she was endlessly empathetic, always helping out the nuns at the ministry, and smart, loving maths and sums just as he did at her age. She liked to help count stock with the mediwitches, helping them out when she could be underfoot, something Hermione would latch onto and have her sorting paperwork when they have to clear the table at her and Ron’s place to have dinner. That she loved beer bread with butter right from the oven, but that her Da hadn’t made it very often. He wanted her to have it all and he wanted to learn all she would give him.
adult knees knocking together. He remembered introducing himself when they were children at the entrance to the Great Hall. “At least it never feels like that.” Harry was silent, silent, he realizes because he wants him to continue.
By now, Weasley was tipsy, on his third glass and Harry was smiling a lot more and adding in his usual insightful comments that were often just for him and each time Weasley would let out a louder than average laugh and Draco was stuck there stiff as a board. Sure he was following along with the conversation but he wasn’t ready to add anything. The
This…truce they had, lasted roughly three months since the first time they’d gone out for drinks. They’d met up a dozen times between the first day and now and at this point, Draco was reluctant but assured to admit that they were some form of friends. An odd couple for sure, but definitely some form of friends.
“And instead of anything reasonable like that, he sent you, looking a mess to tell me to come with you, so that way, when I
at Wandless magic and here’s why: magic is hereditary but when you’re intermarrying all the time, you ruin the gene pool much like the Hapsburgs. Yes, Magic should get stronger if you’re always marrying witches and wizards, BUT, and this is key, that assumes you’re marrying someone with magical blood and not from the same 20 magically blooded families, because it can’t just be
“It’s been fairly hot compared to past summers,” Draco said, hand sliding into Harry’s for comfort in this sort of small talk, as Harry added, “Yeah, we’ve been getting a lot worse summers, to the point where we’re thinking about getting a cooling unit.”
So when the “work trip” had come up, to clear a series of properties in Northern Ireland that needed Draco (currently the best dark magic curse breaker of the firm and therefore the country by process of elimination and disregard for Gringrotts, as Bill Weasley liked to remind him at Sunday dinner) to take care of clearing these places, where there was a wide variety of foods to try and less people that cared who he was, there wasn’t much he to do to convince Harry otherwise. They were going to Northern Ireland.
“Right, that was back before we changed the legal term from Giftless to Unenchanted, so we changed the degree name to fit the new norm.” Cynthia politely folded her napkin and set it next to her empty plate. Thankfully, it looked like everyone was finishing and the two Americans were looking a bit tired, Thomas hiding a yawn behind his hand.
childish. He was a grown man, a man who had survived a war. And instead of facing the fear together, he’d torn them apart in some misaligned idea to keep them safe.
That same feeling of moving too fast hit him again but he shook it off. This was the right thing to do.
Harry Potter was trying not to be upset with Draco. He knew this was hard. He saw, every week, family’s struggling with being ripped apart. The urge to become whole again so strong and human that it was practically a base need.
in the UK which would mean that even at her rate of 3K, that would translate to roughly, 16K in the US for a country of 300M. That is way more than you could stick in a single school (I think she also said like 1K of that 3K were students which means that the birth rate for wizards is like some
“That’s right, my Mum and Dad died, a long long time ago, during a war... are you able to see all that?”
He entangled himself around Draco as he got in, smelling of mint and  home, as the paler man burrowed into the hold.
“Keeping her company, fed and entertained until you could be bothered to come for her, yes,” said Harry, standing up with Rebecca behind him. Draco could already feel the thrum of energy in him, so used to it’s comforting safety. There was a time when that flare and crackle of power, like heat lightning, was turned on him but now it was the wall he could back himself against, knowing behind him was an ally.
“A little over three years,” he answered Cynthia as she organized three stacks of something called print outs. Such even crisp edges to the palest parchment, like the pages of a book. They were held together with a black and silver clip of some kind.
Once he’d gone home, he eagerly set about putting this odd occurrence behind him, Draco had returned to his normal routine. He avoided the rugs permanently— that seemed the safest way. Surely Potter, the rich victor that will be remembered in history, was looking for many rugs to furnish the many rooms of his home. And he wasn’t jealous, the Manor had been tarnished beyond all belief and his mother and he had both agreed that selling everything and keeping the place empty was the best option, in terms of the reparations and the legal fees and the funeral and their costs, but it still stung. That losing was so costly and winning so princely a reward.
He started pulling out the muggle ‘pounds’ to cover his two waters when someone finally dropped into the seat across from him with a huff and Draco’s heart thudded as he whipped his head up—
“Probably as enjoyable as you aurors enjoy working with us.” Potter chuckles, lifting up another plate, this one dark blue with a matte finish.
“Really? All sorts of skeletons in your closet you haven’t told me about?” Harry gave a chuckle, leaning into him. It wasn’t cold by any standards, but the warmth seeping through their contact felt soothing, familiar. Like whiskey in a poorly named pub.
to hurt you...” Bile rolled in his stomach as he realized how close he’d been to all the people who had hurt the Boy Who Lived. How he’d almost thrown it all away to win a stupid fight in an effort to protect himself from the one person who wouldn’t hurt him.
.” As angry as he was at his own situation, he couldn’t help but feel a deep, stinging sorrow, to think that being around people who loved you intrinsically was lucky. To grow up entirely
“Always a good strategy,” John added, and to Harry he said “We’ll have the interview room on three ready when you are.” They both left, chatting about some muggle movie they’d both seen, something about spies who’d lost their memory and had gotten revenge. It didn’t sound familiar to him but they seemed to be friends outside of work as well. He was getting ready to follow suit when Harry stopped him, shutting the door.
Jo gave him a birthday in June so he would be a Gemini (double agent/agendas???) but CLEARLY the boy has strong, sad boy Virgo tendencies. It’s a waste that’s all I’m saying.)
“I think he does it because it makes her laugh, mostly,” he adds, as they fall into step, looking down briefly at his trainers and Draco’s shined oxfords, “Love’s weird like that.”
“Getting back on track,” Hermione said, gesturing with a crisp, “After the Magical Civil War, which coincided with the American Civil War—it had to do with slavery,” she added, for the benefit of the pure bloods, not that it added much context for them, “It was decided that the schools, as a result of the change in states versus federal rights, could continue to operate uninterrupted as ‘separate but equal,’ meaning that the federal government had little control over what was being taught, how it was being taught or who was going the teaching, beyond the bare minimum of what was required. This all changed after the First World War.”
“Anyway, we’d been working for a couple of months, when I started becoming...more paranoid, I guess you could call it. Ron had been transferred to his own team, we were both training new recruits. But I couldn’t shut it off, the job. The older aurors would talk about it sometimes, that after enough cases, you were always on. Sort of lent credibility to old Mad Eye, now that I think on it. And it wasn’t so bad at first. Until I’d nearly blasted some gent apart who’d snuck up on me to get an autograph.” He gave the mug a grimace, slowly rotating it in one rougher hand.
“Then yeah,” he mused, “It’s sort of like an auror but at the federal level. Legally, I’m blind as a bat without my glasses, so I mostly work with the other egg heads.”
“I think we’ve very clearly established, without a reasonable doubt, that I remember the afternoon in your office in April.” The warm fire, the smell of rain, a small sad girl, a popping ribcage, the tea in mismatched mugs, Harry's wrists, the story told with little to no shame. It was all very clear in his head. Draco looked up and Harry was still, watching him. He couldn't pin the emotion in his face, but he wasn't sure if it was his own racing heart that was clouding his deductive skills. He added, softer, “Please, continue.” Harry answered with a jerky nod.
Draco was lost in these thoughts again, stirring absently the cup of pale looking breakfast tea, the honey and milk long since mixed together when a pair of long, rangy arms slipped around him and he startled, slopping hot liquid over his hand.
that Ronald would be there, to help out Harry, and that his casual barb about Draco’s father was a sleaze or a slime ball or something equally dumb was
It was the silence that Eurydice held that had lost her from Orpheus and it was the past of himself that lurked silently behind as he tried to leave it in hell that followed him.
“Oh,” Potter put the plate down, “That would be annoying.” But then he seemed just as lost as before.
“Ooh, Italian,” Cynthia said, pulling her jacket back on, “I’m excited.” Thomas also stood up, with a bit of a smile on, contrary to his usual lack of one when they were working.
They start with the easy questions—can he verify his employment, his home, his identity. Then what Harry does, where he lives, his identity, and if there are any other people in the household that they need to verify or interview. John asks these in succession and they confer that it matches what Harry says.
If you want to find me otherwise, I'm still on tumblr (we-re-always-alright) and the ask box is always open.
Each time Draco opened them, it had seemed that time had passed. There was tea placed in front of him that he drank gratefully, small biscuits to nibble on, Lacey had long since fallen asleep after tearfully telling what had happened in the broken understanding of a child and now Harry just sat quietly in his chair, leaning back and resting his feet on on of the open drawers of the desk while he filed paperwork. In the background, he could hear a polonaise emitting from the wireless.
“For money, you know, a job,” the reddish-brown skinned man looked at him, quickly sliding his eyes across his form before turning back to plates, “Aside from being the Malfoy heir.”
Draco only murmured a few agreements in response, quickly getting changed and into bed so he could rest his head. Harry followed suit, talking to him still through the ensuite.
“Brill,” and without another word, the tea set floated over to where Draco had commandeered a corner of Harry’s desk and began pouring him a new cup, all while Harry continued writing. He stared in a little bit of shock at the action— wandless magic, such casual wandless magic, was practically unheard of. “Let me know if you need something stronger alright? Today was,” the grimace set on his lips as he finished the form, “One of the worser cases I’ve seen.”
“Well, it’s a pleasant subject, Flitwick never tried to kill me and I think it was the only class where no one expected anything of me and I was decent at it. What about you?” Distracted, he thought on this as he watched Harry take a bite of cold Mars Bar.
“Save it for someone who wants to hear it.” He tried to wrench his arm away but it seemed to only make Harry hold on tighter. Even through his robes he could feel how warm he always was. “Let go.”
“Not a fan of love songs?” Draco nearly jumped but not out of being startled. More that he couldn’t believe, though that was his own doing, that Harry Potter had found him again. It seemed that he was going to have to abandon this store.
The tea shop was roughly half way between their prior temporary residences, high enough class that they would have a special service for tea and once they were back, they simply just kept up the meeting. Particularly after the death of his father.
, then you couldn’t be entirely bad.” He took a second to tap his fingers on the table, golden ring sitting heavy on his finger. “And if you aren’t entirely bad, then that means,” he added, and it was plain to see that Weasley had learned quite a bit about deduction through his work, he paused for another tap-tap-tap, “Then that means that hating you won’t improve anything further.”
country. He was certain Malfoy Manor was nearly as old as the country itself was, and they had only left France a few centuries ago.
He paused again, remembering a few months ago when he was at a similar crossroads, and decided what to say.
Harry led them to the bar and they both sat down, Harry dressed in a sweater (gray) with a button up (red) below it and yet another pair of jeans, this time in better shape. Draco felt overdressed in his tailored vest (charcoal) and shirt (white) and trousers (also charcoal) but the allure of the drink outweighed it. The bartender swung by dropping down coasters advertising Guinness.
And then suddenly everything isn’t. Harry starts arguing with you, angry like he was the year they’d made Dumbledore’s Army, moody and secretive and lashing out at
Her face screwed up as she tried to remember, “I think... we were looking for a pastry, because Mum wanted one for Sunday with Gran, but didn’t like the shop because Clarence’s Mum’s Brother’s Sister stole a dish or something— and then it was really loud and really hot and then I couldn’t feel them anymore but,” she looked up, with tears in her eyes, “I could feel you and you were scared and sad...” Harry nodded like this all made sense, shifting in his seat to be more at her eye level.
“But really,” Luna said with all seriousness, stirring the whiskey in her hands with a lurid pink umbrella more fitting for the tropics, “They’re just like that with everyone. I think,” she continued, side stepping into his space as one of the Patel twins brushed past them, “They have an issue with blondes but I’ve never been able to confirm it. Well, until now at least.”
“Did it though? This room is, with all the respect of the story you just told, very bare. It might be worth getting the real me’s opinions on it.”
“Mrs. Stone stop moving!” He started the incantation but Lacey gave another cry, interrupting him, “Lacey, you need to go
It was Harry’s turn to stare, eye contact a familiar and ensnaring thing by now. And then he looked away, determined, as if the darkness held all the answers. Draco waited. And waited.
“What is your problem with this? Why now?” Harry accused, playing his part perfectly, as if things hadn’t even changed, “Do you know how much time and my money I’ve spent on this?”
Narcissa was always emotional proceeding winter. Something about approaching Christmas always set her off—the Malfoy’s had, historically, held a Christmas ball the day before, and a New Year’s one shortly after, and she was always the most generous with her smiles then, they seemed to fall like the flakes from the gray sky on days like that. And after the war, she’d been subdued, prevented from throwing anything more than a single gift for her son’s birthday in his direction, though they were separated only legally. And then, his father had been killed.
“You’ve never said what you do, actually,” Draco finally said after the silence had gone on too long. Harry looked up, blinking a few times before realizing—
Draco froze. Somewhere, in his head, the voice he buried told him it was a bad idea. The louder and snider part reminded him that this was the goal in the first place and that by inviting him, Harry was ensuring the first round was on him at the very least. That was a solid deal to make if he was planning on getting knackered on a Tuesday.
Sometimes he missed how easy it was to hide away in the manor. The 90 or so square meters here didn’t leave much in the way of hiding.
“What Harry means,” Draco cut through,  “Is that the auror’s on scene tasked us with making sure Rebecca got here safely—he’s head of the Department of Magical Child Services in the British Ministry. Show her your badge, Harry.”  Harry blinked once, but did as he was asked, pulling out his somewhat ratty wallet—Draco really had to get him a new one for Christmas— and showed his badge and card.
So it was self preservation when Draco started pulling back. He’d had his moment to bask in the sun that was Harry Potter, with his smiles and his sincerity and his honest care for those around him. Harry would be
It consisted of a lower level, where three desks sat, along with a kitchen and sitting area, and a metal staircase that went up to the two bedrooms and bathrooms, sectioned off from the rest of the space. It had cost quite a bit but Harry had cash to burn and he was taking no chances with this case. Draco thought it a bit extreme on a long shot but who was he to argue? It wasn’t his money.
With this process, it had to be all smiles and sunshine and happiness, so they wouldn’t give up a single step in this fight. Not with Rebecca counting on him. Liza and John hadn’t said that Lorraine’s house was horrible, it had already passed inspection. It just wasn’t very…friendly, they had said. Ornate and beautiful but a cage all the same. And he hated the idea of such a bright young girl being dimmed.
Blaise’s eyes widened as he stared back at Draco, his stylish purple blazer at the perfect angle across his gray silk dress shirt, his shoes shined and far ahead of the fashion curve as he rested on the edge of Draco’s desk.
He didn’t really wait for Draco to nod, preferring to nod to himself and steamroll on, as though if he paused for too long, he’d lose his nerve, “How I was angry and reckless, waiting for something stupid to kill me so I could
I picked Larghetto for two reasons: one, the reason why Chopin wrote it was sad and beautiful and two, because The Truman Show changed me as a person and made me, briefly, feel things related to Jim Carrey and that piece was used in one of the
“Good,” Harry said, quickly kissing his cheek, “We’ll snog next time,” he promised in a carefree voice before they headed out and up to the third floor.
want you dead, in any form.” The air felt tight around them, as if it might compress him into a solid core of pain and anger. He didn’t want apologies, he just wanted out. What could anyone say? Apparently Harry knew, because he continued.
“But it wasn’t just hate. It was distrust. And anger. And shame. Shame that I even existed. So they did what they thought they had to do. They kept me locked away, in a cupboard under the stairs. If I was lucky, they’d let me out, to cook and clean for them, as I was such a burden on their lives.” He sounded hoarse, and rushed, and scared, even now, “Vernon would hit me, if I messed something up, and so would my aunt, if I didn’t cook just right. And my cousin grew up to do the same. I didn’t have any friends, or any toys, just what I could scrounge from... from the donation bin and the trash. They gave me my cousin’s hand me downs— I was never big for my age, kept shut away in a small space and underfed, when I wasn’t punished. Every so often,” Harry’s voice cracked, “I’d get a real meal, instead of table scraps from dinner. And I’d pretend, that someone who loved me had made it for me, instead of myself.” He swallowed hard and water— tears had started falling from his chin. “When Hagrid finally came to get me, it was my 11th birthday. The first time anyone had told me happy birthday or made me a cake, simply because I was there and existed.” He let out a shaky breath, seemingly exhausted.
“Right, well,” he paled and flushed at the same time, it was quite a sight, “We’ll just be borrowing Malfoy and get him off your hands, sorry about that—” Draco ducked out of his ushering hand only barely, regardless of if he were an auror or not, one did not simply
Harry shrugged, answering for them both seeing that Draco wasn’t responding, tone detached, “It’ll be almost a decade in the past soon. No point in getting upset over ghosts now.” Thomas went to open his mouth with his broad accent and rude interjections but Cynthia shut him up with a look.
it, deep in his bones. He couldn’t articulate it, not to Hermione, when she’d asked why and not to Ron when he said it was bloody weird and not even to Luna, who out of everyone would just
?” Draco would like to say that he was proud of himself for not startling and only looking up at Blaise with a half hearted look of disdain, but that only reinforced how much of an idiot he was.
Draco chuckles, thinking back to the bar, and says, “You know, Weasley said that this was the least reasonably weird thing you’ve done to date.”
Then they (Draco and Harry, never Ronald) started having lunch every now and then, even on days when there were no cases to be had. And owling when they could, starting with short notes and progressing to letters. It was nice, being friends with Harry, who would write medium length letters in cramped print handwriting, compared to Draco’s looping cursive, formed with years of practice. But they never ran out of things to say, surprisingly. And he found the time passing faster.
“Is it true that Enchanted London is separate from Unenchanted London?” She asked as they waited for the light to change.
“Really.” There’s a comfortable silence as they regard each other. Some time passes, they’re both a bit out of shape for dueling it seems, and they only make the occasional comment until the witch next to Harry finally wakes up and leaves to yell at the front desk and Draco snatches up her chair so they can sit together. “Though, there are far worse words to leave behind.” Harry nods, adjusting the girl to his other shoulder so he can press the closer one into Draco’s.
Even when he hadn’t seen the damn fool in a month, here he was, plagued by his voice. It was sixth year all over again.
Each time, it hurt, to place the word Last as a bookend to every First, but it was better for both of them.
“D’you think a red rug is too predictable?” said the smooth voice that broke his staring. He turned and there he was.
“He really thought she would think we were having dinner? Brightest witch of our generation and he’s trying to pull the wool over with a flimsy lie like that.”
Notes will probably get longer and longer as the story goes on because I did SO MUCH MATH for this. I will try and publish this weekly as it's basically written out, all ten chapters of it.
, as they were looking to buy a bigger place in Camden to account for the added person so they were viewing their current place in Pimlico, as it was most accurate, and then the new place (still in the hands of muggle solicitors) to ensure it wasn’t some sort of glorified dungeon. He had balked at that, making a snippy comment about how dungeons weren’t all that terrible, weeks ago. Now he felt barely able to muster up a weak smile to keep up his facade.
“Goals are important,” Draco responded, though he was fairly certain he’d never once had a conversation about goals with Blaise, who was, in effect, his supervisor.
“Is that a palace or am I mixing that up with place where Big Ben is at?” Cynthia asked, dodging deftly a group of young people out for a bite before hitting a ‘club,’ as Harry would say.
me, that’s my problem. You just dragged me along with your inane plan! I never wanted children!” Harry looked as if he had slapped him. He knew all of his sensitive spots as well and as much as he knew he didn’t want to, he felt the devilish validation of the pain he was causing. To make one hurt as much as he did, an utterly human thought, forgoing magic entirely. Just as a muggle would.
“How serious were you when you said you were childhood enemies?” Tommy asks with a wicked grin, expressions loosened by the atmosphere, watching their softness over candlelight. “Because there’s more than one girl I got into arguments with in high school that seem to keep popping up in my life and my Ma keeps expecting me to settle down soon.”
If Pansy could do that, following her most primal talents, and make a few euros in the process then more power to her.
“Who’s Hitler?” Harry gaped a bit at Ron, though Hermione seemed used to these sorts of questions. Draco was glad he hadn’t been the one to ask about it.
“Head Cursebreaker Malfoy,” Draco supplied, pulling out the full title for added oomph. The auror winced further, probably already feeling the sting of the chewing out he would receive later, the drilling of hierarchy already smarting.
Draco composed himself, blind to the small splinters still clinging to his cloak and the small cuts along his temple, but well enough to know that he should at least exit with dignity.
“Just the usual, though technically my degree was given after the fact due to the war. I’m not sure what I would have gone for in NEWTs.”
“And nearly kill each other, as well,” Harry added, with his lips loosened by the wine, while he stiffened just slightly, remembering the slashing of unknown magic just faintly, just as much as was sure Harry could feel fiendfyre at his back. “Even before the war.”
However, Azkaban had been razed to the ground in the war and public opinion had swayed sharply on its effectiveness on stopping dark wizards and more on
“Every day.” And it was true. He would survive through anything at this rate, perhaps even the solicitors, but it wouldn’t be living. Not without Harry. Harry who made him feel as if he were loving and brave and wonderful, even when he was not. “You… Life is better with you in it.”
Regardless, Draco was now roaming around Housewares a few months later, looking at the neat rows of plates, serving dishes, platters, decorative plates and other ceramics that made up the special aisle dedicated solely to ceramics. There was porcelain too, which was ironic considering the title of the aisle but the designs were quite good. He traced the edge of a teacup from Germany, where a little bee hovered around the center of the lilacs painted there. He hadn’t been sleeping well for a few weeks now, nightmares of shapeless things and roiling anxiety plagued his bedroom so he’d taken to walking the shop floor every now and then. In the background of the store, and apparently the closer you got to checkout, the easier it was to hear the muzak being piped in from the wireless. He didn’t recognize the music but it was a nice tune.
Then there was the long, pleasantry filled goodbye. He barely gave answers outside of what was polite, running automatically based on years of experience. Repeated ad nauseam.
“Reasonably weird, isn’t it,” he mutters, watching a dark haired witch quickly turn away from him. “Honestly, Ronald, I will never forgive you for coining that particular phrase.” Ronald only laughed in reply.
By the time they’d finally gotten through and Draco had shaken off the feeling of being compressed through sections of pipes, the lunch crowd had mostly disappeared from the hall, already back in their offices and their meetings and already glued to the memos and post flying around the atrium.
His chest felt tight and he could tell his heart was racing, the pounding of his own pulse in his ears.
(far too deep of a look into himself) and even more. When the librarian knew he was going to read essentially everything they had, she gave him a list to go through: 100 Books to Read Before You Die. And after a while, more popular books of the day, to cut through all of the older prose he was reading.
go to school prior to Hogwarts.” They all busied themselves with taking drinks and eating crisps but somewhere along the way he caught Harry’s eye and shot him a grin, which he returned in full, making Draco flush. Did he mention that Harry was brilliant? He should mention it again. The wine was getting to him. Even now.
The good news is that we’ve finally caught up to the first chapter in ‘real’ time. I'm posting TWO chapters today in honor of it being a three day weekend in the US--Thanks Memorial Day!
“Right, thanks for the advice, Draco. Knew I could count on a Malfoy to know his way around rugs. Cheers then,” and with a nod, Harry Fucking Potter, Chosen One and golden boy, picked up a gray rug and walked up to the front of the store and left Draco to ponder just what happened.
“Did you just move in...?” Draco cautiously stepped forward, looking at the tiny table with one chair, the empty drawing room devoid of anything, the office, with its distressed glass French doors and utilitarian desk, with the same empty feeling to it. He remembered what Harry had told him, almost a year ago, about how it was hardly a palace. This was hardly a flat. The kitchen was empty, not even dishes in the rack, and down the slight hall, the bathroom across from the bedroom where the mattress sat on the floor in the dim light from the hall. His footsteps echoed and outside the moon shined. The walls were the plain white of sold property and the floors were a little dusty and it was so
Draco Malfoy didn’t believe in non-magic curses; that is, the non-magic ones that Pansy would foretell of in Paris, her dark eyes rimmed in gold and black eyeliner. He and Harry had visited her for a short jaunt and after she had stopped trying to figure out what joke he’d been playing on her, she’d shown them around to all the greatest dingy bars and restaurants and spoke the most wonderfully dirty French and let them live anonymously a while. It was nice.
if we keep wallowing in the past,” his tone softened slightly, “We may not have lived lives to be proud of, but it’s the past, we’re meant to move on from it. To take a second chance and waste it, to not do better.
“I think in primary school, it was Maths, because I was good at it, and it was practical, for money and cooking and at Hogwarts, I think I would say...” He paused, sitting down, “I think I would say Charms.”
Assuming that Galleons are not pure gold and would be roughly half that price (a conservative estimate considering
The Telly had been turned off and it was raining, making their moods sour. A hot summer storm filled with lightning that made both of them jump and the flat rattle. Another day of delay—Loreen had filed another motion on the location. Another day of waiting. Another day off work and stuck, listless in their home as Cynthia and Thomas decided to continue ironing out the plan. They hadn’t dropped the case yet, even though the interview transcripts had been delivered and digested. Draco would have only be upset at them for abandoning Harry.
The next day was sunny and bright and they received a morning floo call, which Harry took while Draco tried to prepare some tea that would sooth his stomach. Harry had taken his lie in stride that the interview had gone well and it was only some poorly digested breakfast that had caused his bathroom excursion. Besides, he was busy with cleaning and fretting over the home study. Well, home
There was a desk and chair in the center, a stack of case files in the inbox, more pens and desk ornaments that were clearly made by kids. And the shelves— they were new, with more files, and books and even more nicknacks and photos. Some of them even had frames.  But more importantly, there was a clear love in this room, a clear love for the people gone and the people who remained.  After all of the hate and pain, some love was good.
But there was a slight twist, a hint of garden magic that added something coarse and stinging into the blast. Garden or hedge magic wasn’t as common in dark family curses, being that, well, it was
(The time had seemed to gone by in a blur for Draco and while Harry seemed to be drawing energy from the proceedings, he had felt unmoored and tired. Their place was always being called on by owls and paperwork. Floo calls and visits between their place and the Weasley-Granger residence. Between work and preparation, he wasn’t sure even what day it was any more. This he could at least do. He’d been accompanying Father since he could politely use all four forks and hold a conversation on local politics with ease.)
“We both shouldn’t have,” Harry kissed him properly and hard, fat drops of rain rattling the windows, the summer storm finally broken. “We’ll talk about it tomorrow, after we—”
“The same.” It seemed the safest option. The bartender nodded once and went to go fill their order, replacing the woman’s drink as well.
as if he were staring at her, maintaining eye contact, but all he was really focusing on was the wall behind her. He didn’t want to think on the loss of his friends, his status, his family.
“Draco, Draco,” he clucked, shaking his head, “Don’t make me pull rank on you for this.” He ignored him, pulling out a quill and paper, ready to continue the task at hand. He started reading, content to pretend the other man wasn’t there.
What I assume happened is similar to what happened post-World War II for many adjacent countries— radicals / sympathizers moved from their land to a new one (in this case, Death Eaters) and merged their cause with the cause du-jour or des-pays as it were. While in Germany, neo-nazism is stopped severely, everywhere else, it’s more tolerated, so the same I believe would happen here; while in the UK, Death Eaters are strongly persecuted, elsewhere the movement was “softened.” Very much how nazis found their cause taken up by former confederate / white supremacists in the US to merge into a new movement, so did former death eaters and death eater sympathizers do to the members of the IRA who had magic, hence the bright blue on the masks and green on the robes. And since the muggle UK ‘owns’ Northern Ireland, it was easy to jump ship to the Emerald Isle through muggle / wizard means and join up with the IRA right before the end of the war / right after the end of the war.
. Their suitcases, full of clothing and likely other wonders, sat abandoned at the top of the stairs as the Americans were so focused on their task.
“Sure, whatever you need...” Cynthia gave them another wide smile before continuing to setup the desks.
“Second issue, and this is a very old law from 800 years ago that was modified 150 years ago, that says that family is in charge of deciding on schooling and Irish families have precedent for removing their children from British schools—however, it’s got a secondary ruling that British families are given no acceptance into Irish wizarding schools. Essentially, because Rebecca is Irish, she’s not allowed to be taught at Hogwarts if her family says so, however, if she is adopted by a Brit, she wouldn’t be allowed at any Irish schools, a ridiculous notion but one which has, as a result, complicated the adoption bid. Placement starts as soon as they turn 10 and Rebecca is 9, hence the reason why there’s all these extra hoops to jump through.”
Kissing in the middle of his doorway in front of his flat and Harry tasted like whiskey and a hint of lager and the smell of cigarettes was still on him and for once his lips weren’t chapped and Draco’s mind couldn’t handle any more because it was everything he wanted and if this was death then he was more than ready to welcome it into open arms—
, whatever that was. When he was like that, all Draco could compare him to, now with hindsight, a breeder of fine dogs, purposefully picking and punishing in kind, because he saw everyone as beneath him and not just muggleborns. And the strongest part of his emotions, the ones that held most sway, were a combination of sorrow of the rare happy moments that were now only memories and the larger sadness that he could no longer look to him and feel anything for fear of speaking ill of the dead.
“But it could still be true, in a sense,” Harry added, as they walked around a waiter setting up tables for an outdoor cafe, “I mean look at us…”
“You would think,” he segues, launching into another, related story but all Draco notices is the small, tentative smile that he’d first seen in the rug aisle. Maybe tonight wasn’t a total loss.
when he was gone, really he would. He would still have his friends and his nearly fully furnished flat and the expanding Weasley family and his fulfilling job and Draco Malfoy would just fade into the background and disappear entirely. He’d become a story that others would ask Harry about, or Harry would tell them about, and one day, he’d fade entirely from memory. Harry would be fine. Yet to make himself keep standing by his side only to wave goodbye as a friend was some sort of unholy torture that, while earned over his life, was too painful.
He tries to move out of the way but he nearly bumps into Liza who huffs a small sound so he nearly steps into the way of John’s measurements of the window.
They looked at each other for a moment and in that moment Draco was certain that for all the creases in his suit and the freshness of his robes, Harry would be the only one to see the cracks forming in him.
Robes off, in another jumper (a Mrs. Weasley original, judging by the homemade quality) with the sleeves pushed up and his decent jeans and a few bags under his eyes but he was smiling this little stunned smile at Draco and he could feel his own mouth tugging upwards in response. Beyond him, the silent picture of the Thames rolled by, while the fire crackled and classical music (some piano piece—Beethoven? Liszt? Probably Liszt) softly played from the wireless on the mantle.
“Night Harry, Malfoy,” Weasley adds breezily before lumbering into the flat, and Weasley-Granger rolls her eyes and says simply, “Thank you for making sure he got home safe.”
“Safe and neutral,” Potter mused next to him, rolling around the words in his lower class accent, as if trying them out, “Well, I couldn’t hope for anything better than that. Better than freezing my toes when I wake up, right?”
—over a lightly patterned bedspread in soft cream, the pillows strewn across it in matching colors and patterns. The walls were bare, but a stack of prints with a note in the distinctive cursive of Editor in Chief Lovegood lent against the wall. There was a dresser, older, but in good quality and the clothes neatly within. Sensing that Harry wouldn't stop him, he peeked inside. He recognized the sweatshirts that Harry favored in a tidy stack, running his fingers along the fabric. Similarly, the closet was open but organized, the shoes ranging from ratty trainers to nicer brown dress shoes with a faint shine in a slightly lopsided row. The light was soft, coming from the fan in the ceiling and the large moon outside and there, under the slightly raised mattress, sat the grey rug from the first night. Draco was right, something neutral worked very well there.
Looking down at his sweatshirt, he looked back up with a small smile, “I took a few courses from Greenwich University and University East London to help prepare me to do this job, during my sabbatical.”
“I think it’s the size of Europe, roughly,” Harry said, trying to recall his scant public schooling, “It’s massive compared to here.”
After a quick aparition (Draco couldn’t help but stare at their wands, Cynthia holding a birch and cherrywood striped lengthwise wand that was maybe five or six inches in length from a pocket inside her jacket. And Thomas holding a black as night wand with a length of amber running up the side holding it together, nearly 12 inches in length that seemed to come from a hidden pocket on his trousers. Very odd.) they arrived in the combination loft / flat / office space that Harry had put them up in.
Which is why when Draco is waiting outside the pub (thinking all the while, and for the umpteenth time, that the
He dropped his voice down to a hoarse whisper, it was still a bit chilly out to be standing even in warm rain and he never yelled much as it was, but this would be more threatening, “And you better do a good job of it or else.”
He told Harry about a lot of things—how he’d started reading during his imprisonment and what he read and what he thought about the books. Sometimes those conversations would spill into their lunches or their pub drinks when Ronald wasn’t there. Harry told him about ’his’ kids, who was succeeding and who needed more support, the work he was doing to save them. Sometimes Draco would make a recommendation on a family who could help. He told him about how he’d joined Blaise’s firm after months of needling by the other Slytherin, a story that had left Harry in stitches, remarking how he’d have to thank Zabini one day for the laughter. It was really nice, coming home to see the standard ministry owl sitting there, waiting for a treat, or watching Harry walk up to the pub, a moment or two late as always.
to dress down, and somehow the conversation had started back up as Harry had led him to the bar to get a drink, though he was certain it was all about him. The numb tattoo on his forearm itched but he knew to make any sudden moves would be the sure way to get a stunner in the back.
“Yeah, they’re stories, you know, long running cast, unnecessary drama, been on since the dawn of time for housewives to watch after the kids are in bed.”
And there’s a tapping of a slippered foot to accompany that statement, almost on cue. With some effort, he waits until they’ve surmounted the last step to the landing before looking up, dodging yet another gesture.
So this story roughly takes place in 2005/2006, after the end of the Troubles but not so far past that people don’t remember it. In fact, a lot of the Irish wizards probably remember it all too well. Also, firmly putting my stake in the ground that magical Ireland is one ‘whole’ country in the HP verse, and because I think it makes more sense as wizards seem to not be particularly religious though more ethnocentric than expected. This is a theme that you’ll see throughout this fic.
was... unthinkable. “But... I never told her. So... when I left her place, I didn’t have anything. I’d been borrowing the Dursley’s things since birth— nothing made it from my parent's place. Living with friends. Living with Ginny who had things from her siblings. So when I moved out, all I had was some clothes, my pictures. My books, my things from school so I brought it all here and it was so empty. But I didn’t... I couldn’t fill it.” He slid down the wall and sat down, looking so young. "I was alone, without a purpose. A tool without a use. No one to fight." His eyes darted towards Draco and he gave a wet laugh. "And no one to send my emotional hangups to."
It should have changed his world, the thought of being in love, but this was real life and not a book. Instead, Draco spent his winter as he had previous: he visited his mother, they visited his father’s grave, while the snow lashed at their rosy cheeks and it was less worse that’s he was expecting but no better considering the news. He spent the appropriate amount of time at the firm’s Christmas party before begging off to get drunk very pointedly
“Hop up here, dear.” And Rebecca let go of them to sit on the desk, but quickly took Harry’s hand back. Harry was oblivious, as always, and entirely focused on Rebecca, leaving Draco to do the dirty work. He put on his best, withering Malfoy sneer and looked at them each in turn. Only the witches had sense to look embarrassed but he knew what would work best.
“We’re glad you could come on short notice,” Draco said, never one to lose his manners over a simple thing such as meeting the two people meant to help them retain Rebecca, “I know it’s quite the trip.”
It didn’t mean that he didn’t think about it, in fact he thought about their short encounter often. In his weaker moments, he could feel paranoia climb up his throat, telling him against reason that it was a conspiracy. In others, he was reminded of his acute loneliness, Pansy gone off to France, Blaise more a coworker than a friend, his own mother and their stilted conversations, his circle so small compared to  the brief brush with Potter’s large and eclectic group of friends.
He opened his mouth to tell Zabini off, to lie to him, to tuck himself into the dark places only he knew, but he stopped himself. As willing as the Zabini’s were to switch sides, they were deeply prideful and once a secret was earned, it was kept. And he was tired of arguing with only himself.
It was rare, in his opinion, that Draco Malfoy found himself in the middle of the Patel’s store, staring at the rugs, recently imported by way of magic carpet from Bangladesh, and trying to decide if he’s ever going to bite the bullet to get one for the front room or just leave it as is and continually curse the cold stone beneath his feet. Normally, he found himself more at home amongst the rows and rows of dishes, flatware and silverware, remembering fondly the various sets his mother would have for different occasions. It had been several weeks of staring at the rugs since he had first come in making this his new haunt and still his feet were cold. By now, he knew the layout of the store, knew the aisles and the different areas where the lights didn’t quite reach as well. Where one could find a spice rack versus a spice cabinet versus spices to fill it. Typically, he was more a lurker of the home goods or the wall simply labeled ‘Oddities,’ but as of late he was more often hovering around the rugs.
With his hand on his wand and his charcoal robes blowing in from the door and his second best casual suit on, he knew he cut an imposing figure. The three of them came to a stop, Butterman bending over to huff and puff at his knees. The older woman fixed him with a shrewd look. He held her gaze. “What’s going on here?”
“I’ve fully completed my time in prison, I’ve paid the reparations for the families and I now spend my time working to remove dark magic left over from the war from homes and other buildings.” The words felt stale in his mouth and he tried not to shiver. “I no longer hold the views expressed by my family and the group they were associated with and I worked very hard to do so.” Cathleen didn’t narrow her eyes but she could smell blood in the water, honing in on it as finally tuned as a hunter in the woods chasing their query. Loreen had done a fine job finding a formidable opponent for Harry and him.
he reminded himself to drive the knife in deeper as he polished off a bottle of cheap American Malbec,
The Medi-witch gave them both a look but led them back to the break room, where two other witches were attending to a set of aurors and another family with a child. They all stopped when the three of them walked in, staring at the three of them. At first, he assumed it was their appearances, because they were a bit of a sight, or that they had recognized Harry. But then he saw the way their eyes all watched their linked hands.
Part two was punishment for those who had done the worst of the crimes, banned and prevented from ever using magic again, they were sent to a commune, in a newly constructed and staffed building, to live out their sentences. Why they weren’t just executed, as some were very fond of writing into the struggling Prophet about, was that Shacklebolt’s goal was rehabilitating a majority of the people and a lot of them, as much as it pained him to say, were still people and still connected. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it handled the worst of them.
Draco nodded, unsure where he was going with this. The story had been all over the old Prophet, and was probably one of the last majors stories they had run, after the trials and while the reparations were being doled out.
Harry sighed. “So, Ron intercepted the resignation and instead convinced them to put me on a short term leave while I got myself sorted out. Hermione helped me draft the plan and got me a six month extension on that leave, to give me time to get it all ready, take a few classes and get the paperwork sorted. And at the end of it all, I ended up here,” He licked his lips, looking at his tea, “Here at the start of all things.”
Harry didn’t look away but his shoulders sagged, his whole body cut from the puppeteer strings holding him up. He looked older than his age. Draco could only imagine he looked as bad, pale and filled with discomfort. He felt like throwing up, knowing that he’d done that, like a hangover, sour and sober. That he’d said those things.
“How...” Draco stopped and shook his head. “They’re going to get found out. One way or another. The separation is necessary.” They were too different to coexist in knowledge of each other. He looked to Harry for support but he only half nodded, in that way he always did when talking with headstrong Aurors. He’d yet to make an opinion but wouldn’t make that known until necessary.
He spat once more into the toilet, flushing away the foul smelling stuff. Someone banged on the door, the the swinging door to the outside of the washroom bringing the smells of lunch and other people and he felt the bile rise again. He nearly choked on his own throat, retching again, as if his body was trying to purge itself of all of the bad things he’d done and was coming up short.
“Honestly, it’s you, who helped me, to do all of this. I’d be sitting there, just imagining you tutting at the state of things,” Harry said from the door, “Insulting my very apparent lack of style and very apparent lack of motivation and it became, well, not easier, but more palatable, I suppose. I wasn’t doing it in spite of anyone or to fill up the holes, I was doing it to prove you wrong, because I
He kept repeating the words over and over in his head. Liza gave him a smile but he wondered if it were false, if all the others were. He had to leave.
can go watch her while I clear the rest of the fucking house.” He gently detached Lacey and gave her to the shocked auror, hair matted to her head and
“The point is, after he took over, both Canada and Mexico got involved as well, through his connections as a former president, and pooling their funds, research and authority together, they created UMNAS, the United Magical North American Schools. It’s a collection of two
But here they were now, Draco sat next to Harry and adjacent to Weasley at one of the high topped tables, all facing the bar and the shut off 'Telly', waiting for Ron to return the double of whiskey and...red wine. And since when has their usual order become a pattern? Since when had he come to expect and look forward to the whiskey and lager and the low, subtle mood in the pub? Even the bartender eyed them with their new additions warily. When did
amazing is that I have not used a single Lorde song in this entire playlist. Who even am I. (To be honest, it could just be both albums because Lorde is just. that. good.)
Once they’d looked one another over, afraid to speak but entirely concerned, Draco had started undoing some of the more embedded curses poking out of the stone buildings, needing something for the adrenaline, while Harry talked with the aurors, detailing what had happened, how many their were, etc; a few who recognized him were able to smooth over and vouch for the extremely powerful wizard standing before them (wearing of all things: ripped slim fit jeans, a stolen red flannel from Ronald from ages ago and a shirt that was advertising something called ‘Spice World’) and, as a result, his curse breaking boyfriend (dressed
“Thank you,” he said pointedly. He adjusted his jumper collar slightly so it sat correctly, barely avoiding a shiver as he remember why is was messed up in the first place. “Now. I’m going to ask you some questions and you’re going to answer them.” Harry opened his mouth but Draco cut him off, “With yes or no answers only.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Harry shift before coming closer, standing only a half meter away.
It’s so small, with five adults in it and he can’t imagine it filled with all of Rebecca’s favorite things. More and more things piling in. A whole life time. He can’t—
It was only his own thoughts that were adding color to it, imagining the feel of the hands that held the ‘biro,’ the brow that had crinkled as he thought on what to write. If he had thought his imagination was awful prior to last night, he was so incomprehensibly wrong.
“I’m fine,” he retracted his hand, ”You’re being paranoid, jumping at shadows again.” In his head he could hear:
support staff, not to mention they’re closely tied into their department of welfare, economics and national defense. They’re a massive program of regulation, seniority and funding. Actually, it’s where I got some of the ideas for your department Harry.”
“Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests,” Harry supplies with a grin. “They’re our highest form of examination through Hogwarts.”
“Italian food is her favorite.” She laughed back at him, lightly punching his arm, friendly and familiar. Draco blinked.
Then, using his powers of whatever the hell it was that made him the Boy Who Defeated the Dark Lord, Harry had ushered him in and hung up his coat, prattling about something or other as Draco was becoming more and more aware that he was far too overdressed in his slimming cashmere jumper, tailored shirt and dark, expensive denim even when he was
“I’ll get the check,” Draco offered, motioning to the waiter to get the bill, “Seems like it’s time to turn in early.” His head throbbed with every word.
The silence in the flat was deafening, as if they could see the physical destruction around them had scattered all life from it. Stop all the clocks, stop the barking of the dogs and stop even the turn of the earth itself. They stood at this precipice, both knowing there was no good ahead.
Draco opened his mouth to say something when Weasley started again, “You know, Malfoy,” he said, rolling the words in his mouth like stones in a tin cup, “When Harry told me who we were going out with tonight, I was...” he trailed off again, tilting his head the other way. Maybe he was more drunk than tipsy.
“I can’t wait,” he replied sarcastically, dreading every step closer to the interview rooms. He could easily remember the hours he spent in there, years ago, waiting for the aurors to collect his statements prior to trial. He remembered how Mother couldn’t stop silently crying, the venom in Father’s eyes as he watched his son tell the whole story, start to finish, of his involvement. Draco knew his rights, he knew that by giving a statement, dressed primly in black with his favorite cloak with bags under his eyes so deep that no glamour could fully cover them, that it could implicate himself or others. He remembered being very cold, even though there was no legal way a dementor could be in the room and it was only his own conscience parasitically eating at him. And he knew that when the whole story was out, he’d be punished and, even more so, it would damn Father to prison, perhaps for life. But he knew he had to do it. He was tired of running. And he’d rather he and Mother have a chance someday to return to normal.
“She’s not a piece of property!” And at that the door slammed closed and papers flew and Draco had to hold Harry back a bit as he went to stand.
“He actually said more about you than anything else,” he slowed to a stop a few steps ahead of him, turning back to look at him, “Something about me helping you settle and that if that’s what I could help you with, he was alright with the reasonably weird things going on.”
“What’s that supposed to imply?” Now Harry was sitting up, staring at him. Glaring even, in the dim light. It made him nostalgic in a twisted way.
“This one,” Draco cut him off, silencing whatever false platitude he was about to toss out by holding up a slate set, with a smooth finish and a subtle pattern that wouldn’t wear away or become tacky in a few years.
supposed to mean?” Harry mocked him, picking at the pain in his heart, just where he knew it would be.
“Well,” Harry scratched the back of his head, like he wasn’t the most powerful wizard to beat death twice, “He sort of turned to dust—“
“You’re either wise beyond your years or completely insane,” Draco said before he could stop himself. Luna laughed before grinning widely at him.
“Oh not again,” he couldn’t help but say out loud but there he was, Harry Potter, talking with Lacey Stone and wrapping her in a warm dry blanket, a few meters away while she sat on a semi-dry shaded bench in the overcast light. Maybe he could just leave before anyone noticed—and no, of course not, because Potter was looking up and meeting his eyes with his green ones and smiling sadly.
“But in the end, we grew up to be different people, and became better for it and better for each other.” He was certain he’d said something like that when being interrogated at Sunday dinner at the Weasley’s, he was certain it would suffice now.
“UMNAS seems really complicated,” Harry told her, the auror voice long gone, “I can’t imagine the amount of work that goes into it.”
Unlike Weasley, who had seemed to simply grow into a larger version of his school self, Hermione Weasley-Granger has changed rather a lot. Her hair, still bushy as ever, was shorter, framing her rounded face, showing her long neck and making her umber skin luminescent with how it curled around, even in the bright hall lights. Her eyes were only slightly furious under her arched brows, her body more filled out as if her younger self were a sketch of the powerful witch she would become, and he felt his nose wince remembering the pain of her punch and that she’d never needed her wand to cause damage. Damage that she clearly felt like inflicting, judging by how her eyes narrowed at the three of them.
¹ = this is actually not a political comment—most major cities, weirdly enough, are built over former swamp/marshland (Chicago, New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, London, to name a few) DC just happens to be the one she lives in and being further south, has much warmer weather, particularly compared to Chicago. Last year, it hit -51F (-46C) with the windchill, though it topped out at about -19F (-28C)/-21F (-29C) without it in the winter (average in Jan is usually 23F) and then our high was 97F/36C in July, which is hot but we've hit 105 in the past ten years so I'm not complaining lol.
“It is. And,” Harry says, wrapping his brown hand around his pale one, the callouses rubbing across the soft skin there that rested on his wrist, right above his pulse, “At least we’re not two miserable blokes sitting in a restaurant, waiting for a date who will never show up.” Draco laughs, deep from his core, and agrees that this, in whatever form, for however long, is worth having.
They had talked on this, he and Harry. How he was a changed man. How he had made his penance. There’d been flashcards and very strong gin and tonics as they reviewed. He wondered what Cynthia and Thomas would think of him when they’d finally read the reports of this conversation and the trials. He wouldn’t fault them for giving up then, but he knew it would upset Harry.
Which is when Harry stood up, knocking his chair over, instinct taking over, wand already out and hurling spells as if there’d never been a pause in the war, incapacitating the first death eater that had come out of the smoke, sending another two flying down the rubble filled street. He looked as an avenging angel, a god of chaos and destruction with the cuts bleeding from his temple and arms, his hair flying up from raw magic expulsion and his scar pale and bright against his reddish-brown skin. He looked at him fiercely, bright green eyes alight. The man who had beaten death twice.
“It’s a religion, Ronald,” Hermione told him, “Similar to how my parent’s are catholic, you know, the church, the priests, the crucifixes.” Slowly he nodded.
“It’s not— it’s not that simple,” Draco sighed, because even to describe the gulf of non-simplicity between them was too much. There was too much of everything, history, animosity, emotion, to be doing favors for one another. Harry tossed the biro on his desk and rubbed his eyes, tired, but he maintained his earlier statements.
By the time he’d reached the last compression curse on the last spare bedroom, he was swaying just a little on his feet and in his exhaustion, he must have deflected it the wrong way, taking one of the walls clear off, scattering splinters and plaster everywhere as he watched the wall compress itself into vanishing.
Liza was the opposite, cornsilk hair, hazel eyes, barely coming up to Harry’s chin and cursed like a sailor when there weren’t children around. She said her family was here by way of her mother and by way of Poland and had a boisterous laugh, filling any room she was in. She had joined first, marched right up and had demanded a chance to prove herself to Harry Potter, who had graciously ‘accepted.’ Where John was steadfast and eager to tell off aurors with biting commentary that he’d hidden behind his solemn demeanor, Liza was fast, darting in and darting out of scenes, moving in a flippant way that hid how upset she could be. She recently had chopped off most of her hair after someone on the tube had put gum in it, she told him when he had blinked at her appearance.
“You must live life with the full knowledge that your actions will remain. We are creatures of consequence.” — Zadie Smith
“Stop lying!” They were in each other’s faces now and he felt 16 again and out of control of his emotions. He could smell stagnant water and hear dripping even though they were in the drawing room. But at least he felt alive. No longer a ghost, a poltergeist.
That said, New Order is probably still going to be one of my fav bands of all time, with a bonus for the whole messed up love thing. Additional bonus because the scene from Marie Antoinette where they’re
“So,” the man next to him starts, “I’ve gotten an actual frame for my bed and a second chair for my place and I was thinking of picking up some more magazines because I think it’s high time I got a sofa and a Telly—can’t have you keeling over next time you come for a visit.”
literally everything else. Not to say Americans are special or some BS like that, but the school should probably reflect the country more than just duplicating British imperialism. Come on, the ruler of a country stepping down on a schedule? For that matter, a ruler picked by vote and
He couldn't remember what they'd called it in the Library. This was the closest they’d even been together for this long without trying to kill one another. He remembered a time in a bathroom, blood running red against the pale of his skin and Severus looming above him. There were no faults now, so long past.
But Harry brushes this off, sighing with a chuckle and heading downstairs, Draco close behind him. As they stepped out into the night air, he had to say something.
emotion until all there was was pain. What would be do next? Fling things from the shelves? Break crockery? Hurt people as they tried to flee?
“Correct,” he answered, making sure they all got into the dim and grey alley off from the side road, where really there were only rats and cigarette butts to see them.
“That’s good news,” he said, drying his hand and then taking a sip of the tea. It was too sweet and too milky but it was better than continuing on an empty stomach. “Have they heard about Hogwarts?”
“I don’t care WHAT the law says, I am her blood relation! The only child of my late son, god rest him. She is MINE.”
“It’s hardly a palace, more of a flat really, I think it’s only 90 square meters and it’s in Pimlico so. Not really like a palace at all. I wouldn’t even mark it a single family home, only two bedrooms and a bath and a half, so not ideal for more than one or two people.” He seemed nervous now, maybe it was the porcelain; after all, this aisle was marked for ceramics. Draco shook his head slightly, trying to regain his wits about him. Potter looked at him quizzically, so clearly he’d noticed.
You see, what you do is organize everything around concentric circles, from the lowest level of the organization to the highest level. Imagine it like this, you have a wide variety of bracelets on a wrist, and each of the beads is a different person. And instead of hierarchy, you have bracelet beads that pass information up and down the arm of bracelets. We have so many different districts and schools in all three countries, we need a better decentralized and yet centralized form of communication, so that way even the principal of a tiny school in Chiapas, Mexico feels as heard as a science teacher in a giant school of 10,000 students in California and as a Québécois special needs student aid would feel heard. It’s a complete departure from what we do now, to have these circles of management—“
just think: you’re the head of the auror department and your top, shiny bauble decides to quit one day. You would do anything to keep him. He brings you this zany idea and he’ll be technically on your payroll but doing his own thing, with very little impact, very little press and a lot of paperwork and all he wants is an office and the authority to do it. It’s a no brainer and it keeps the higher ups off your back about budget (look any time Harry was on a case you better bet they had to bring additional aurors to the scene to handle the press, before the Prophet takeover) and personnel and everyone wins.
“And it might make her want to stay even more, to know all the parts of you that you don’t hide,” Harry told him, “At least the parts you don’t want people you love to know,” he added. Draco felt relief wash in, for that was exactly why. “I feel the same way.”
Draco thought, miserable at his desk, watching his tea cool and staring at the letter that had just been dropped off from one of the Ministry owls.
His heart ached with longing and unsaid words and other silly little things as he shut the door behind him, hearing Harry pop out of existence on the other side.
The way he had proposed it, a few days ago, was that he couldn’t meet at their normal weekly sans-Ronald dinner (
Cynthia Wallis is based, in name, on Wallis Simpson, who caused an abdication on the British throne and then Tommy is just your standard, scruffy Buddy Holly looking second generation Polish American from Chicago who hates New York style pizza with a passion. I think I’ve met like 40 guys like Tommy since moving to Chicago myself, so it was the perfect thing to toss in as her assistant on this case.
“And I...” Draco started again, talking around the sobs that wanted to escape, “I can’t believe I said those things to you, I was just so angry and I wanted you to feel as bad as I did— it was so wrong. I... There’s no way that’s forgivable.”
After the first 15 minutes of waiting, he’d just assumed that Harry was running late due to his chronic inability to judge times. It was endearing, at times. At 30 minutes, Draco made internal excuses that Harry was likely tidying up something at work or had run into one of the many aurors who seemed to always want to pick his brain. He ordered a sparkling water, a delightful thing he’d discovered they would serve here and practiced what teasing remark he would make when Harry finally rushed in. At 55 minutes late, Draco almost left, but instead, switched to the other chair so he could watch the door and wait for him to walk in. He ordered another water, forgoing the lemon this time. At an hour and five minutes past, someone asked to borrow the chair across from him, as the crowd was picking up, but he declined their request, stating that he was waiting for someone. The waitress stopped over a few more times. And now he was here, nearing an hour and 45 minutes late and looking down at his empty place setting and wishing he could break the secrecy law to disappear without having to get up and walk out of the restaurant in shame.
Usually, a prospective family or the government would contact the firm on the property in question. The lower level breakers would research the property, followed by an initial look by the junior partners to feel out the limits in the curses. These two groups would return and present these notes to the partners or advanced members of the firm, who would determine the best suited member and potential courses of action. Final discretion was always left up to the head curse breaker, but often the majority of the busywork was left to younger members. Then the curse breaker for the case would formulate a plan, come up with how they would resolve the curses and potential curses, and assume any contingencies they might need. In the end, it was a little bit clinical. The research, the diagnosis, the treatment. Mostly solitary, mostly mentally taxing but emotionally devoid, the places empty and bare of wizard or witch affects.
half of who he was. Would Rebecca do the same to him, if he were to repeat history? He wanted to say no, he would never dare, but a small part of him, a part that would probably be with him to his death bed, said
Here’s how they reached that point. Neither Draco or Harry would forget that day, so remembering it was no hard task.
Did he see what Draco was afraid of when he looked at him, all covered in glamours and finely tailored clothes, pale and sneering? When he’d thought of the future, he’d imagined that one day they’d die together but never as enemies. Not then and not now and yet they were twisting into violent, painful creatures.
“Yes, and I don’t take any objects home. Usually only case files or texts on curses. We keep them in a warded drawer in the study.” They’d practiced those answers a dozen times, so often he felt they were more study partners in school than romantic partners.
This was the only room in which the walls were painted, the walls a soft, gray blue that exuded calm, while the paint cans laid in the corner under a few glossy magazines that showed furnished rooms and curated spaces. The bed was covered in dark gray sheets, covered in a warm, hand knitted blanket in blue green—
“What?” Even Harry, genial and kind Harry, his own tone was testy. The voice in his head was advising him to back off but he couldn’t hear it over the pounding of his own pulse in his ears.
“So like an auror?” Harry asked, equally unaware of what the FMI or its Muggle counterpart, FBI, was.
“You idiot— how can we have broken up if we hadn’t even started properly dating yet,” and then it was Draco’s turn to press Harry into the wall and kiss him with all the emotions he had locked away.
“This’ll be perfect,” Cynthia added to his reverie, already unpacking their files and two dense pieces of dull ‘plastic’ and more notebooks, pads and pens than potentially necessary while Thomas took their other bags upstairs. “Though I don’t suppose we could get the case files sent over and a couple of white boards and cork boards as well?” Even Harry looked at her blankly for a moment but stuttered back to life. Draco had assumed they would spend the first day strolling around, taking them out to a nice dinner with copious amounts of booze and talking about pleasantries. It’s what Father had always done when calling on foreign lords and what he’d told Harry to expect.
Every couple of weeks, Weasley, who was, at this point Ronald in the same sort of way Potter was now Harry, only different, would join Harry and Draco at the pub. They would usually drink pints of lager, still, only switching to wine after particularly trying cases.
After that, over a few months, it became an ad hoc routine of theirs. One of them would owl the other. Or send a message via floo. Or they’d catch each other’s eyes after long hard cases, somehow finding each other in the same circles of houses. Or Harry would end up in the spices section of the Tescos or Harry would find him standing in front of the bargain teas and with a jut of the chin they’d head to the pub. Sometimes they would talk, usually only about trivial, annoying stuff, pressed close enough together at the bar that that when Harry would laugh as Draco gestured, he could feel it along his left arm.
Draco nodded to some thing that Cath was saying, looking distant and blank. He was certain he was just as nervous as Harry was and he was definitely using a glamor. Only Harry could really recognize the look.
But the conversation moved on: “By extension, each state had their own local schooling systems based on area
“In school— not Hogwarts, regular Muggle school, and then I ended up having to run to the corner store to get whatever Aunt Petunia had forgotten she’d needed for dinner. I had to know what change was needed or it was no dinner and a night in the cupboard, more if they thought I’d bought something for myself. Sometimes she would misjudge what money was needed and I’d have to make do.” Draco felt the familiar hot flare of anger and resentment that boiled up from some protective place and tamped it back down, not willing to ruin their night with another discussion about just how wrong it was to lock a child anywhere dark and damp and isolated. Instead, he just said:
“So explain to me this whole Voldemort thing,” Tommy said, gesturing with a piece of oiled bread. In any other restaurant, particularly a Wizard one, a hush would have fallen over at the name. In fact, it was only by virtue that Harry had dusted the creature and Draco had spent so long in his company that neither had flinched. “We don’t often get much intel out of the UK.” He wasn’t surprised, knowing what he knew now, or rather, how little he knew about the rest of the world.
“So,” He looked back at the other man, “I think I was supposed to give an explanation. And I would offer you a chair but...” he gestures lamely to the kitchen. “Would it be odd if you sat and I stood?”
“Huh, that’s fascinating—We should really take a city tour if we have time, Tommy, maybe one with Segways that I’ve been hearing about.”
you to say anything. You don’t know how to tell him it’ll be okay because you don’t know what to do. And you still don’t know what to do when the resignation papers come in so you burn them, worried that if Harry loses this, he’ll be gone for good.
“That’s only because you think pizza supersedes any other food groups,” she told them, “Though it’s charitable to call deep dish a pizza—”
“It’s not your fault, obviously,” he hastily added, “Bloody machines.” This seemed to be a good catchall for the mechanical maladies that happened in the non-magic world and most Muggles seemed to agree with it. She nodded in response, her shivering name tag said Matilda, and she wiped her eyes prematurely, which only served to make her seem even younger. She seemed eager to try and save the sale by starting to ramp up into a conversation about how much the machine’s fault it was.
“Well yeah,” he says in that delightfully in exact fashion he’s so fond of, “Harry wouldn’t be interested in someone who didn’t care and he definitely wouldn’t hang out with someone who was an utter arsehole, through and through. What I reckon,” which always meant ‘Hermione made an observation since I’m too dense to notice it myself and I’m now using it as my own,’ “Is you spend a lot of time trying to fit in a specific mold, but now you’re free to be whoever you want and you’re only
And now, Draco ‘entirely-too-trusting-when-it-comes-Harry-Fucking-Potter’ Malfoy was enjoying the pitying stares from the muggles in the restaurant and the waitress coming by, yet again, to ask him if he’d like to order anything.
He reached out and laid his left hand on hers, neatly avoiding his sleeve from going into the plate of untouched biscuits, “I know you do.” It wasn’t so much admittance of anything, the safest answer, while all his answers warred inside of him.
By the time Rebecca had finally calmed down and was sitting in a stupor, Draco and Harry had attracted a Medi-Witch in soft blue robes over to them.
He’d attempted to extrapolate this to Harry once but couldn’t really articulate it in a way that made sense.
“Welcome, Mr. Malfoy,” she stated, her accent thick and her tone even, “I’m Cathleen Walsh with the Department of Child and Family Home Services in the Irish Ministry.”
“Harry, stop,” and his jaw clicked shut Draco’s words, paling a little as he let go of the door and it swung wider, “I don’t know
! His brain squealed while Draco wondered if it was possible to obliviate yourself) for a quarterly get together with some of the classmates of theirs that Draco only knew through generic animosity and last names. Which is when Harry had come up with his next brilliant thought to tumble from his (
They sat in silence, Harry glued to the Telly until he nudged Draco with his shoulder, “Doesn’t matter what pub you’re in, they all seem to always have reruns of
“It is, though now I get to hear you in real life, insulting my opinions, does a man’s ego good.” He laughed.
Because the goblins are essentially pocketing the profits—a single galleon converted to GBP is about 10GBP at Gringrott’s whereas if you convert it from “pure gold” to GBP it’s worth 72-145GBP, at today’s prices. Wild. Even more wild? Harry’s minimum net worth in today’s prices would be anywhere from 3.2M-6.5M GBP, not counting the other stacks of coins in his bank, interest rates, the value of his holdings OR the residuals (potentially) of the Potter name.
“But,” Billings floundered for a second, wanting to control his case but also wanting to follow orders. Maybe if Draco was lucky, he would simply explode from indecision and— suddenly all he could think of was the woman grasping and reaching for her daughter and it felt like icy water had been poured all around him. The humor was gone and if he were any paler, they might end up having to call the Spirit task force out here.
Harry said something to him as he ducked into the room and he knew he didn’t even react, so lost in the cobwebs of his memories that he didn’t even offer the reassuring smile he had planned. He couldn’t see into the room, not like the one he’d been in, so instead he sat on the hard wooden chairs and looked down on his hands as he clenched them together over and over again. They’d grown a bit older in the time since he’d been here last but that was okay. It was going to be fine.
“I would have thought that with all the training before and during the war, you’d startle less.” Anger flared up in Draco.
Suddenly he realized all of the times he'd jeered at Potter's infamy, not realizing, in all of his youth, that being bred for a purpose was as isolating as it was for him, only he had parents and relatives and friends to fill that space. Harry had none.
“Exceedingly, but I suppose it’s to make the criminals truly regret what they did.” Draco’s voice was unsteady as Harry half chuckled before sitting next to him, bumping their shoulders together.
get it, not understand his own version of life that he was struggling with and not be alright with it, “It’s going to be okay.”
Overall, they seemed to pass with flying colors. Even John had cracked a smile at their shared office, with their books and files and the art prints from Luna.
“November 12th,” Harry said, sweeping in with the groceries and the case files, sending both respectively to their places while he paused to peck Draco on the cheek. Then he swept away before he could get in a private word and started putting away the groceries. He felt very separate from Harry, as if they were shouting across rooms instead of speaking, a gnawing feeling more and more familiar these days. He tried to shake it away; tried and failed.
“Don’t worry Lacey, we’ll get you and Draco nice and dry soon,” Potter said, stepping into the point while three cleaners stepped past them, ready to compile and remove the bodies, and held out his hand, landing on Draco’s shoulder, who looked at him a daze, and with a tug, they popped out of the space.
“Right,” he swallowed thickly, taking the hand Draco was offering after adjusting her on his other arm and squeezing tightly. “She’ll be okay.”
Harry laughed, but not in a mocking way, in the breathless sort of happy way, where he made Draco feel like he was a hero for being a part of it, for causing that bit of joy. “I could handle it too,” he told him, quickly kissing his cheek before tugging him along, heading up the street.
much different on this case, being that they were involved. “And you can’t have me check over your work, so please verify,” and he looked at Liza with that as she playfully stuck her tongue out at him, “with each other to make sure you don’t leave anything out. No sugarcoating, no omissions, no white lies. This is by the book through and through.”
“Hitler was—” Harry interrupted her to say, words hot and fast, “Hitler was a dictator who rose to power in Germany, who was trying to take over the world, in order to purify it—resulting in the deaths of over six million Jews.” He was as angry as he was when talking about abusive parents or Voldemort, and Draco tentatively touched his arm and minutely, Harry lost some of the fire. More ghosts, he wonders if this is the fate of the Master of Death, to be forever surrounded.
Draco, if you asked him, didn’t believe in curses. He was more of a practical sort, the kind who would look for signs and signatures and real magic left behind in the silent houses he would sweep through. Privately, he would not admit to it, but he did believe in
And of course, there’s tons of contention between the British and Irish governments about this, hence the attack. The death eater’s were the Brits problem not the Irish—which of course the Brits counter that this is just the IRA using the Brits dark wizard’s look and feel. And of course, no one can just form an international task force to handle this. Maybe it’s high time someone invented wizarding Interpol. I did base some parts of it off of the unfortunately common car bombings / bombings of the Troubles, particularly how often the targets were civilians.
“No trouble at all,” Harry answers for them, stepping closer to Draco to fill the gap left by Weasley, “It was a rough day and I invited him so only fair we help him home.” She nods, with a hum, watching the two of them, seeming to analyze their very nature. He stood a little taller.
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is still amazing, on of my favorite albums and short films of all time (Runaway slayed me in 2010 and I still haven’t recovered) and he’s gone kind of way downhill for me since then, but Ghost Town is just a perfect track. I cut it out at the last minute but I wanted to add this in, as the lines were just too poignant:
“Lacey?”  She whipped her head around, panicked breaths joining the sounds of the crushing wall. “Lacey, my name is Draco I’m here to—“
“I mean it,” he added more sincerely after a short laugh, twisting their fingers together, “You have a good way of looking at it all.”
“I’m sorry I brought it up—I was just curious.” Curiosity was natural, the reason why muggles often stopped to view traffic accidents on the road, little ‘cameras’ coming out to capture the scene. He wondered if Rebecca would have the same questions that Thomas did. If she would ask the same questions and then accept his demure answers. Would he become his father, hiding dark wizards under the guise of work? He hoped not.
“Pansy once told me this thing about people,” he told Harry as they took the less busy streets, already filled with mother’s and children doing the shopping, “About how they find each other?”
“Do?” Draco was still staring at him as he moved from the soft taupe ceramics from Turkey to the China from Poland.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “As long as it’s a good explanation, as promised, I think sitting my be a better option.”
“Either that or it’s something to do with not being a Gryffindor,” he added, noting how people seemed to avoid both of them, though her less than him, “Considering we’re the only two not directly related to that house.”
“Why should I?!” He whirled around, hissing the next part in his stupid savior face like the snake he was, Harry’s face shocked, “So you can tell me how sorry you are that I’m a murderous death eater like my father? How you regret testifying? How you don’t understand why I can’t be good? How I deserve to die like he did? Why didn’t you just leave me alone!?” Harry didn’t look angry anymore. Just panicked.
“Weasley, you wouldn’t know style if it showed up on your front step in a golden crown, with loud fanfare and calling itself the Queen,” and Draco instantly clammed up. The wine had clearly gone to his head and
Small references to one of my favorite tracks from the 'superposition' story, the first in this couplet, “Bottles and Cans” by McCafferty:
For a moment, he reflected on how odd it was to have such a familiar opinion on Harry’s friends. The conversation continued.
It was roughly a eight or nine square meter space, with one long wall where the door sat, covered in bookshelves, case law and filing cabinets, which carried around the corner, past the small table with the tea service bubbling along, around behind the desk, where it looked like the files and books and case law turned more personal and had stuffed toys, blankets and spare clothes before turning into a coat rack where Harry hung up his slightly damp cloak. He wasn’t dressed as a wizard usually was, or an auror usually was at the least, instead wearing jeans and an odd muggle jumper advertising Greenwich University. His desk was relatively orderly, a cup of quills and strange devices sitting on the desk, parchment and other forms of paper in neat piles, a stack of memos and notes in their appropriate boxes. Above it sat a few muggle and non-muggle photos of deceased family and his living friends. Along the wall opposite of the desk and next to the fireplace was the small blue couch, where Lacey was currently tucked under a blanket and holding her mug of tea, staring into the flames. Above the couch was a false window that looked for all purposes, as though you could see a silent view of the Thames running by. It was entrancing to watch.
It was so beyond late at this point, his mind circling round and round on what it meant, rewriting the conversation where he came out on top or where Potter felt so awful for approaching him that he left in shame or that, even curiouser, he left with him. Draco didn’t like to dwell on any of these situations but no matter which way he turned on the rich sheets or how he fluffed his pillows or how often he tried counting backwards from 100, sleep eluded him. He turned again towards the window, regretting everything that had happened there and hating the thousand things that hadn’t.
“Now, I was wondering what your reaction would be if the child in question decided to cut ties with you and Mr. Potter at 17.”
“Oh whatever you poncy git, just because it’s not some pur— things like polo and fencing doesn’t mean the common people are devoid of talents. Thanks, you can keep the change.” He added, swiping up the chocolate and pulling Draco out of his astonishment and into the street.
my mum for being a witch. I don’t know if it was ever true and deep hate, because she did take me in, but she hated her. Hated her life, her husband and...” Harry trailed off. He was still facing the wall, one hand pressing into it, but Draco wasn’t sure if it was the wall holding up Harry or the other way around. He looked at the floor, shame in his voice. “She hated me. Just a year old and she hated me. Hates me even now, if she thought I was still alive. Her husband— Vernon, hated me too. And their son, they raised him to hate me as well. And you know, that wouldn’t have bothered me. If there’s one thing this whole savior business has done, it made me realize that doing what’s right even when being hated is far better than anything else.” Harry sounded so sold and tired. Tired of the whole business. How much more could he take? Not much, Draco surmised.
Harry fell into him, warm and solid and feeling so much of home that if he weren’t crying before, he was now, “I know, Draco, I know,” he inhaled unsteadily, the sound right by Draco’s ear, “It’s just all so fucked.”
.” And Blaise all but dragged him there, shutting the door and poking him in the chest once he had stumbled into standing there, watching the other man with wide eyes. All the joking in Blaise’s face from earlier was gone.
sure what it meant, but he’d seen enough arguments at the pub between muggles to know the gesture wasn’t a kind one.
The girl was pressed corner by the door. She was a small for her age, probably five or six, and clearly took after her mother, who was currently behind slowly pressed into the wall by the opposite wall of the hallway, the two mirrors replicating her image ad nauseam.
Draco stood up stiffly as well, noting how much time had passed sitting here talking, and followed the other man to the hall, lights being turned on as they went. They passed the little water closet, which was indeed, filled with things to make it hospitable, soaps, towels, even a little bowl of decorative stones. “And then this is the office,” Harry pushes the doors to the side and it was clear to see that this was a far better looking room, there was a print on the wall, even.
would never so choose. “He was a half blood man who thought he could outsmart death and get rid of muggles all in one go. Non-magical people,” he added, seeing their blank looks. “He ended up taking over the government after his return and went on a reign of terror for a year or so, killing tens of thousands, both muggle and wizard, along with his followers, until he was killed at the Battle of Hogwarts in ‘98.”
If you had told Draco Malfoy from sixth form that at one point, he and golden boy Harry Potter would be supporting an absolutely smashed Ron Weasley up the front stairs of the flat that he shared with his wife, he would have laughed you out of the room, out of the building and possibly out of the country.
He tried to push Lacey out— with her safe, he’d be able to try and save Mikaela, he was now trying to call out, “Mikaela Stone, I have your daughter, she’s safe for now, how are you doing?” At no point in his cursebreaking training did they ever go over how to handle victims. In fact, it was often why Draco would avoid the cases were people were already there, preferring to avoid any awkward stares or silences. But this week a new group of people were moving into reclaimed homes, which meant the firm was stretched thin  and considering all the rest of his cases were in the next wave, he’d been the last one available on short notice. Water pounded the sides of the house at a dull roar.
seen the world’s most adorable baby at the Tate a few weeks ago when Harry told him they had to go see a Picasso (whoever that was, his
“Cynthia Wallis of Mage-USA, you must be Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy,” she said with a crisp, northeastern and undeniably American accent and a broad, friendly smile. Harry smiled back but Draco was demure, giving a somewhat friendly nod. They weren’t chums, as Blaise would say, so there was no reason to greet one another as if they were. She shook both of their hands before inclining her head back in a short nod, “And this is my assistant, Thomas Gabryszak.”
Who could he punish? They were all just ghosts now. What do you say to the boy who survived instead of merely living?
So here he was, a warm pint of lager in his hand, looking “casual” while his heart tried to beat out of his chest, lurking like some sort of mental patient with a carefully neutral expression on his face that screamed
Heavy reliance on “Like a Staring Contest” from the soundtrack below here, because gosh, some great lines and perfect for this heavy chapter. Mostly because sometimes you fight with someone just so it’s not over. So totally not healthy but it’s been a rough time.
Draco stared at him, afraid that if he looked away, he’d end up tearing up or something silly like that. It was what he didn’t want to hear, but needed to hear, yes, but he didn’t believe it yet, this ‘truth’ he’d spoken. Not at all.
understood it in her own unique way), only knowing that being with Draco, being this close, it felt right.
I was surprised that you were here again. Furnishing more rooms in your victor’s palace?” Potter just shook his head, his smile smaller.
“Okay,” Harry said, shedding his robes and draping them over the small island that separated the kitchen from the living space, he was wearing another one of his sweatshirts, this one said FRIENDS in capital letters, “You remember what I said in April right?”
“Voldemort,” Harry said, weariness in his shoulders as his Auror persona slid back into place, a second lid that seemed to sap all his energy, “Was a homicidal, genocidal dark wizard.” His voice was firm but detached, calm but quiet. Through their linked hands, Draco could swear he could feel the thrum of power in him, the power over Death he held, both great and terrible if he so chooses. Soothed by the coolness in his hands the whispered promises that
“It’s okay Harry, I do the same thing when I have to do my chores...” He took a deep breath, gripping Draco’s hand as well. He squeezed back. He felt like he was taking a leap off a very tall building. Was this what doing the right thing was all about?
“Yeah,” Harry copied his motion and stole a drink from his cup before smiling at him, “They passed with flying colors—I mean so did St. Augustine’s, but it’s come a long way from when we went to school.“
Draco’s heart felt like it was stuck in a compact box that was only getting smaller and he wasn’t sure yet why. But Rebecca’s new story about her friend Clarence’s dog was helping.
“Piss off. Then I thought about it and I realized I never really liked potions, learning about them, I was just good at them. But I did really like Transfiguration— the idea of knowing something well enough to make it into something else.”
“I think I’m the best judge for that,” Harry said with a grin, his white teeth bared, his eyes green as acid and his scar pale against his sepia skin as he brushed the hair out of the way, as she gave a little gasp, “Harry Potter, Head of Magical Child Services.”
While he was able to hide his reaction earlier, he couldn’t stop the jolt that went through him, slashing through Sir Phineas’ name, as he felt his heart race. There was no way he could know, but he wasn’t able to stop himself from looking at Blaise in a slight panic. “So it’s a man—obviously someone you’re ashamed of, judging by that reaction,” And Draco couldn’t help but scoff—he was the one despoiling the Chosen One, “Or not, judging by
So he sat there in the dark of his flat, staring out at the empty lights of the city, the moving stars in the sky, and cursed the entrancing nature of the Patel’s store. Wishing for morning to come quickly yet wishing he had more time.
He couldn’t help but admire, in a way, Weasley’s reasoning. There was a lot to unpack, things he should be more concerned about in the words he said, but all of that was overshadowed by some feeling he couldn’t describe. Was it relief? Pride? Something earned? There’s wasn’t time to come up with much better.
a child versus adopting one but I assume that would be the same issue even if you weren’t wizards. There’s a whole slew of paperwork that will need to be done.”
, there’s so much more.” He rested his head against the wall, a dark, somber mass against all the white.
“Oh, I’m on the Magical Child Protective Services Department; well, department of one,” he smiled, “But I help children of witches and wizards after any dangerous or deadly incidents. Comfort them, make sure they’re safe, warm and dry and sent to a safe home. The pay is rubbish but it’s for a good cause.”
Which is why, in Harry’s rather cramped office (it wasn’t so much made for four grown adults as it were one maybe two adults and a child) between the second and third floor of the Ministry while Harry caught them up to speed.
“I remember Dudley always asking for money and eating enough ice cream to make him sick. If it hadn’t melted by the time he’d left the shop and gotten back to Privet Drive,” Harry started, walking with Draco at an easy strolling pace past Regent’s Park. There was no rush in how they walked, no need to go fast or slow. Their jobs, once things had settled, left them with many empty hours to fill in between.
“They’re completing the child evaluation and accompanying us for interviews and performing their own the home study,” John cut in, “Does this mean that we’re both following the same format for all three?”
but he couldn’t stop the rage bubbling up, the pain and anger seeping out from where it normally sat.
After that, Granger—Hermione now—invites him into the conversation asking him about the work they’d done on a muggle school in north Sussex a few weeks prior and Ronald keeps plying him with beer and Luna stops by twice more to report on people’s reactions to them (slowly growing the umbrella’s in her garden of hair) and even Longbottom stops by, remarks that he didn’t believe until he saw it and that he’s alright with it all but one step out of place and he’ll punch him with such drunken seriousness he starts—which only serves to send Granger into lightly scolding him, red wine in hand about inciting violence in a muggle pub and Ronald into peels of drunk laughter and Harry to smile and grip him on the shoulder until he relaxes.
By the time he’d gotten there and assessed the scene, dour aurors hanging all around him in the heavy sun shower around him, eyeing his investigative measures with suspicion, there was little he could do. The sun and rain combination was the smallest irony of the day. Draco ducked inside the house, the preliminary look at the house had revealed nothing more than what had already happened. It was the stuff of nightmares. He pulled back out to talk to the head auror, a tall man with a permanent scowl and half an ear.
because he was Blaise Zabini and that was just something he did and added, “It’s my mother’s secret to real happiness. You take things as they come and make the best of where you are right now. Talking of maybe’s and someday’s only forces you down paths you don’t want to take.” He shook his head again. “And, as your boss, I’m requiring you to stop bringing you sad little woe-is-me act into the office anymore, you’re causing the plants to wilt and that looks bad for business.”
“I will Mrs. Stone,” and with that promise, he tried to push Lacey out the door but she was clinging too tightly.
“Yeah, from the case file information, all the way to the case law and the other side’s lawyer,” he answered back, finally stopping the clicking and dropping the pen to the table on top of them. It was starting to get annoying, even as a new sound to Draco.
So far the conversation had been relatively light. Things that wouldn’t come up normally in the files:
Draco had never learned why his parents married. He had never asked. They could have loved each other. It could have been yet another pure blood marriage of convenience. But they were his and it left joy and a sour taste in his mouth.
“If she wanted to leave, I guess I would try to support her as much as I could,” he said haltingly, “I wouldn’t want to force her…her to stay or be what she wasn’t.” It was words he’d wished he’d heard. Words he only thought of at night, turning past events over and over in his mind like a lodestone, pointing his way into the murky future.
He sits up carefully and cracks his neck. The blond next to him winces, like always, but doesn’t move.
Malfoy,” the red head next to him joked, his longer legged stride meant that Draco had to widen his own stride to keep up, “For a moment I thought you were going to make my own eyes melt in my skull with how you were glaring.”
He skimmed the history section, still unsure at all the words flying past him—enlightenment, separation of church and state, amendments—focusing instead on the school portion. Above and below America, on the map at least, sat another set of massive nations, Canada and Mexico, respectively. Looking at the maps in the file, detailed with Hermione’s neat handwriting, he watched, page by page, as the borders between the three shifted, decade over decade until they finally stopped moving and became firm.
in the whole world and you still can’t speak when you watch your sister and him have silent arguments or you see him get choked up over Teddy or you watch him at his desk across from yours staring a thousand miles away. So you put on a brave face and hope it’ll be okay, that Harry will come back to you.
“Oh.” There wasn’t much to say to that, and the sort of kindness Harry was exhibiting towards him was throwing him off. “Then I suppose another cup couldn’t hurt...”
“So,” he drawled and Draco cursed internally, “I’m going to need to understand why you look as though someone has just eviscerated you and why, or we’re going to have an even longer and more uncomfortable discussion about feelings than you wish.” This was a common tactic that Zabini used—offer you two options, neither of which were pleasant and then give you enough rope to hang yourself with. If it weren’t turned on himself at the moment, he would be impressed. Coupled with his sly stare and arched brow, it was extremely effective.
.  That’s what he did yet again, even if he didn’t commit the crime, he’d spurred on the horridness within him. “I’m sorry. I’m a piece of shit. I’m so sorry.” His breath hitched as he tried to keep the panic from taking over. Two people could be in love and still break apart. Mother and Father might have ended that way and now Draco was just repeating history, the way he’d never intended. The Malfoy name was for power, not for love.
The Camden place was on the first and second floors of the building (with another unit on the third and fourth floor) with private use of the small aforementioned garden, which Harry had to have.
. And it’s not perfect, not by a long stretch, but you know now you won’t be visiting the grave of Harry James Potter the same way you stood over Fred’s and Lupin’s and a hundred others any time soon and that’s well worth it. You’d do anything for the boy who bought you a sweet cart and made you feel special all those years ago. So you encourage him, exactly like you and Mione practiced. You remind him of things that are implied when it comes to family, like it says in the pamphlet. And when he nervously tells you who and why he’s been meeting at the pub, you swallow your burst of anger and the stubborn lump of pride sticking in your throat and you promise to be fair, so the boy on the train, now a grown man, will trust you with all his secrets again.
It had become a habit during his year in captivity. When his monetary supplies were low, he’d have to avoid the Waitrose, with its bright and clean atmosphere and head to the slightly dingy but exceedingly popular for muggles Tesco located just off center facing the worser off part of town.
“I mean it.” And he did. He knew all the horrible things he’d done, by his testimony and by his own admission, in privacy. Yet he was still here. And maybe that was enough, when things were hard. To be known. To have the entirety of your crimes laid bare and still be acknowledged as a person.
deal with magical schooling, for which the rules are extremely old and varied. Now, we’ve slowed them down by filing an injunction that it should be handled by the British wizegamont but that’s only to stall. We’ll need to present, most likely, to a combination of both courts.
We’re also going to need an expert— As much as I’ve studied case law it’s been fairly limited over its history for Irish case law so I’ve been in contact with the educational secretary’s team in the United States— She directly worked with the former president and the head of UMNAS—and helped further the standards for what would later be defined as the Magical Child Protection Act of 1987 which—”
wish,” Harry echoes back. He’s not sure what his emotions look like, splayed out carelessly and open on his face, but whatever they are, Harry likes them because then they’re kissing again. And it’s not perfect but it’s a perfect moment, distilled into a memory that he’ll keep forever. They’d spent so long nearly crashing into one another, nearly drifting apart that this felt like settling into some bone deep rhythm that only they could feel. A shared pulse. Pansy had said something forever ago about ‘perfect, entrancing, celestial circles around one another’ and even if it wasn’t that’s what this felt like.
“Because I love you,” Harry said with all the confidence of the bravely drunk, “And I know I upset you with something but I apologized and I just want you back.”
“No, it’s from today,” the witch nodded and worked up a spell to clean the cuts and burns—he was certain like the rest of them, Rebecca was going to have some weird hair for a while. Then she handed Rebecca another potion (a simple Pepper Up Potion or something local variety) before turning to them.
“Right,” perky and eager to talk she continued, “So this is something I came up with when I was taking my daughter to Girl Scouts—it’s a scouting group that encourages young women to get involved with their community and discover their inner strengths,” she digressed for their inner benefit. Draco idly wondered what Rebecca’s hobbies were and if she did something like that. It seemed a bit mundane. “And the former director a while ago, started using this new management system.
He wasn’t sure why he knew it but Draco finally tore his eyes away from the instruments playing themselves in the corner and back to his mother. It had become a habit of theirs, during his supervised visits with her while she served her own (longer) house arrest.
“It’s a great cause, I really hope it works out.” Harry answered for them. Draco quickly finished his wine again, hoping it would dull the headache.
He couldn’t read their expressions, his breath was coming a bit too shallowly to focus on much of anything.
There was an extended silence. Draco traced the bookshelves which were empty except for a sloppily organized set of six books on child psychology, fresh paint over wood catching on the sensitive pads of his fingers. He wonders if Harry has callouses and if they catch on the shelves or if they glide past, leaving no trace.
“I’m not letting you go—that was rude to Ron but—” His eyes softened, just slightly and Draco felt his heart seize in his chest. He didn’t want pity. “I get why you’re angry but you can’t just leave.” He kept his hold but loosened his grip slightly, and the blond was about to wrench free when Harry continued, ”Please.”
Draco glared at him, knowing full well he wasn’t the cause of his problems. Harry’s eyebrow raised a smidge higher before dropping. He was far too sober to be dealing with this.
Who Bloody Lived in his sadly bare flat than any of girls she suggested. Maybe Harry would be alright with absconding to Paris to live in anonymity. Pansy would put him up for a few months while he faked his own death.
turn of fate Ronald Weasley and his wife to defend him when they tore him to shreds. And, out of stupidity (
Then there was a small staircase that went up to the top floor, a bathroom that also functioned as the loo for the first story, which Rebecca would have use of, next to the plain room with a decent closet and view overlooking the garden. Their own room had a decently sized bathroom between their walk in closet (his suits really only could be hung up) and the master suite which overlooked the street. It was a nice place, very large without all the furniture.
He’d never felt his place in the world as being small. In fact, at times, it seemed like their now apparently small island was the only one in existence, floating outside of ominous words like World War and Cold War and Genocide. Yet now he was starting to think that it was less ignorance and more isolation. So much destruction in such little time, now subsisting in footnotes.
Their tour of the Pimlico property went off without a hitch. There was a few small comments on the decor—he could handle those as they were more surprised that he didn’t recreate the dungeons of Hogwarts there. Or recreate the Manor, he supposed, with all of its Stuart era trappings and art (softened by the influx of art his great grandfather had purchased all the way through the Regency era) though how they probably thought it looked matched more of a dungeon and less of an estate that it was.
“I want you to be happy,” her voice was a slight level above a whisper and despite her control, the tremor in her voice is there.
“Wine.” He reiterated firmly, chin jutting out as if to challenge him, “If it’s wine, then ‘Mione will think we were at dinner instead of getting plastered at a bar.” Draco could only raise an eyebrow in response but before he could make a cutting remark, Harry added in, “I think that’s fine with me. Draco?”
“Yeah,” Harry added, “There’s a great little Italian place up the high street that we’ve been to a few times, nice and cozy.”
Magic tills never needed something as silly as ’soft wearing updates,’ whatever those were, and as such you always knew how much money you needed before you could return to the comfort of your cooled home and sit and listen to the heavy storm clouds that had been rolling in all day release their rain. If nothing else, the sheer convenience of it all was astounding.
Apparently, all of the papers would put together list of the biggest books of the week and let everyone know—the one from America was the most popular and prestigious list—so it was on the covers of all the books to let you know it was popular. Those were harder to read—too much information and bloody crime and political intrigue for him to understand. When the librarian took note, she switched him to something classic, “You’ll enjoy these, they’re so exceptional and classics for a reason!”
“Put me in jail with the rest of them? Leave me?” He tried to sound haughty but it was harder and harder to call it forth. Hated the part of Draco Malfoy that still craved punishment for his transgressions. The part that still lost it whenever he stepped into parts of the Ministry or saw curses that were just a bit too viscous.
But now she’d started again ever since the end of war and no matter how much he said otherwise, he always hugged her back. Life was too fleeting otherwise.
“What if there was a place so safe that the worst of you could be known and you wouldn’t be loved less, but more in the telling of it?” - John Lynch
“You just said it,” he said, holding out a cold sweet for Draco to bite off, “It’s all about knowing something well enough you can change it— that’s cursebreaking, knowing a curse well enough and inside and out you can break it. It’s a lot of research and discovery and then you finally test it.”
Matilda looked at the candies and the crisps and looked back at him, smile breaking out. This was also a common occurrence, apparently something about Harry would just cause members of both sexes to break into smiles (something Draco would deny but secretly made him pleased and vain that Harry was all for him). Draco posited once, perhaps while intoxicated on some extremely good scotch that they were drinking because they ran out of wine and had to break into the ‘Chosen One Liquor Gifts,’ that his messy hair reminded people of a lost puppy with floppy ears hence their kind words and smiles. This of course prompted his response, “So does that include you?” accompanied by this half-lechorous-half-endearing grin. And Draco could barely save face, feeling his skin flush outside of the alcohol, as he responded, “Well, obviously but that doesn’t mean you can skirt the dishes every time you throw bedroom eyes at me—“ and after that there wasn’t much else they spoke of on the subject that night. At least not with words. And the dishes still weren’t done.
“I mean, they’re all nice, as far as rugs go,” and he gave a half smile at Draco, as if there wasn’t a gulf of history and emotion and baggage between them, because he was Harry Fucking Potter and that was just the lark of a life he led, having conversations about rugs with people he tangentially knew, “Not that I would know but you’re someone of good taste—is red too tacky and decidedly Gryffindor?”
Draco had never felt strongly about children. Of course he loved Teddy, he was his relation. And he didn’t mind them, abstractly. And he
“It’s nice to meet you,” he says, sitting down and hoping he’s not shaking too much. It feels just as cold in here as it did before, but he’s certain it’s just a memory. “Liza, John.” He nods to both of them. Cathleen marks something down on her papers in front of her and he hopes he hasn’t fucked it up already.
“Always the conversationalist,” Liza quipped with a wink, standing up with the rest of them, “That’ll be good for the witness box.”
But he doesn’t. Even after Harry panics at the engagement party and disappears to go stand in the freezing rain for hours, or after you cover up the bloke who nearly died for an autograph or your own fucking
But it kept happening. He felt like he was being stalked by Harry and that he was stalking Harry in turn, nothing like their sixth year but everything like it, the intensity of the emotions. It wasn’t
This wouldn’t be the last they would talk on it either. No, this was a turning point. Despite the horrid pleasure he took in hurting Harry in their fight, admitting to vomiting in the ministry bathroom, the very one that apparently Harry had also vomited in fifteen minutes into his testimony, was better. It was knowing another person so deeply and truly, despite the consequences. To be known and know in turn.
He picked up his pace, feeling the bile rising, he hadn’t eaten breakfast consistently since this thing had started. He wasn’t sure, as he moved, if he was in his body or someone else was piloting it, driving him to his destination. Nearly slamming into the stall, he barely had time to throw the latch before he was falling over the bowl, retching and coughing up water and acid. His eyes and nose stung as he retched until there was nothing left and he was wrung out. Stinging as though his skin had been scrapped raw and salted, the burning of his dull and numb tattooed skin only a memory made real. He was still here. He was free. But the things he’d done. The things he’d let happen. Those were still there.
“Hm,” she made a note, “Are you planning on telling the child in question about your past?” The question grazed him as a fast as any spell could, sending him into a spin.
By now, Draco was used to the stop that they would make at the various corner stores on their way back to their home to get a few treats, and the bits of information that, on quiet streets and busy streets, Harry would disseminate to him, more time than not in an offhand way, and sometimes in a quiet way that would leave him staring up at the sky, an inky black that only existed in crowded, well-lit cities.
It was a good question to ask. Unless... the pieces started to click together, not strongly and not with any supreme clarity, but enough for Draco to ask the next question. The right question.
“Lake Michigan?” Tommy answered, seeing Harry nod, “It’s the second biggest in the country—actually, from what I remember last time I was in the Chicago History Museum, I think you could fit the whole of the England or something in it, both in depth and size.”
He was life itself, unabashed and human in all the ways there could be, bottled into a tincture that Harry wanted, constantly.
“Careful,” Draco said, tucking his book back under his arm, “I might have to start charging for my interior design expertise.” He started heading towards the door as Potter’s laughter followed him.
These cases were awful, start to finish, and usually with a trail of bodies in their midst. Some witch or wizard, or in this case, a whole family, had moved back into their home, unsuspecting of what lie inside. They never assumed, despite any warnings, that it could happen to

), the lights seemed to flicker worse in a way most muggle lights did and he always drew stares, even with his cloak over his arm like a large overcoat. He hated even more what always drew him there. The local Tesco.  It was slumming it, even for muggles.
“Yes, I need their names because there is a terrified mother and child in there who just watched their family die and panicking is only going to make it worse.” Even though he was a foot shorter, the auror recoiled at the icy heat in his voice.
Draco just put his head in his hands, and by the time he’d lifted his head back up, he had to laugh. Harry looked at him a little confused.
Draco croaked our a wet laugh, his arms holding Harry tightly. Somehow it felt better, knowing he was just as angry as he was. That it all wasn’t some genial mask worn by the Chosen One.

, he would simply have to become a hermit and live the rest of the days in the shell of the manor and work his way towards being a ghost. “Malfoy
help?” He didn’t lose his perfect posture but it was a near thing. He could hear the intention. Harry would never lose Rebecca, but Draco could. Draco was the anchor, dragging in the silt, until, at some point, he would catch on something and tear the boat in two.
He turned to face Luna Lovegood, her hair in a complex set of twists and tumbles where bright red chopsticks stuck out of it, in a soft peach sundress with grey woolen tights and snow boots and white fingerless gloves bedecked with pearls and her, now famous, radish earrings swinging as she fixed him with a tilted-headed look, “I’m sorry—”
“That’s right,” Matilda smiled bravely at the nice man who also just happened to make it a habit of saving the world. It was hot and sticky and he just wanted to be a home in the cool calm quiet of their flat. “Thanks, I just— sometimes I forget that we don’t always need the machine.”
“I don’t think Pansy is actually much of a seer, well, a good enough one for muggle purposes,” Draco stated plainly. Her Divination scores had been worse than his but in true Slytherin fashion, she was excellent at reading people, particularly one on one.
Draco was alone with Weasley who had settled down in his laughter and was now staring at him, looking as though he were trying to think. Perish the thought.
Typically, if you knew enough about the long standing branch of dark or hereditary magic, you could find the ways to diffuse it, but it was harder to do with older dark curses from more insular families. So sometimes, the only solution was to trigger it, as embedded as it was into the very bones of the building it inhabited. Instead, you need to direct the flow of magic elsewhere, because the magic itself is so wrought with hate and pain that the energy must be expended. In fact, knowing dueling as well as he did, plus the summers at the manor, only increased his abilities to spin the dark magic from its point of origin, feel his new wand heat up with crackling energy and hurl it away with a twist, breathing a grateful sigh every time it worked.
If Harry was the puppet with cut strings and Draco was a ghost, all the air and fight went out of him at that. His heart ached, not at the fighting but because they had caused so much hurt to one another.
“Harry! Draco! Don’t let her take me!” Rebecca was all but screaming her head off and at a rather high pitch (“I don’t know her!!”) and Harry was busy trying to get her to explain with his calm soothing voice so it was up to Draco to straighten his spine and stand between them.
. He’d decided to give it another shot, now knowing it was one of Hermione’s favorite books. He found he was liking it more as his 200th muggle novel instead of his 4th or 5th.
“Right,” Draco sipped his tea, “Which is where my sources of information were incorrect.” He nodded, watching as the completed paperwork flew in and out of the room, almost soothed by the age-old whisper of paper he remembered when he was small and would accompany his father. “And how exactly did you go from an auror to this?”
“It’s alright,” Harry smiled at her encouragingly, “Do you know how much it is?” Draco nearly rolled his eyes, which, of course, the girl saw and made her even more flustered.
“Right, during detention,” Draco responded, he’d heard the story in bits and pieces over the year, the first small connection to his deceased family.
relationship. That was what we promised. And now you’re bringing her into it!” Harry looked hurt. He wondered if he hated and enjoyed causing pain as much as Draco was.
just behind Harry while he and Ronald shared a laugh with Granger. He could see Finnegan off by the bar, getting another round staring at him and could only imagine how completely off-putting and potentially insane he looked. He tried a short nod, one he’d seen Harry use at all sorts of aurors and it made Finnegan only do a double take.
“It seems fascist ideologies go hand in hand with wizards and muggles,” Hermione concluded, not unkindly, “Now, here’s where the magical government joined forces with the muggles to stop the war and end some diseases, it wasn’t just that Dumbledore arrived in annexed Austria alone to fight Grindewald, he had the support of American military and wizards helping to pave the way as they were fighting their way towards their own monster. There was a pacific theater, changing powers and world leaders, new technology that changed the world, etc, and followed all the way through the abdication of Harold Humphrey, the Magical president, right after the end of the muggle war. Ring any bells?”
“But you did.” He could feel his temper start to rise. Why did he have to keep rehashing his crimes? His just punishment? His atonement?
“It’s just the anniversary,” he lied, half shrugging one shoulder while keeping his head level and gaze locked, a way of using a common gesture while maintaining the air of high class as he sipped his tea from the expensive porcelain wishing it were a slightly stained mug in his deepest heart, “It always puts me in a mood.”
“Fuck off,” Harry gave him a shove before turning fully to Draco, his green eyes in the soft light reminding him of being held in a serpents enchanting gaze, “Sorry Draco,” in the background,  Weasley repeated ‘Draco’ in a strangled tone, “But I promised Ron after this case.”
But if he were being honest, he knew the curse would mean nothing, because this tragedy was only the after effects of a curse his family had made themselves.
“—worse than yours. Honestly, there should be a penmanship quality part of the auror training program,” Weasley gestured quite a bit compared to Harry, though usually with a wine glass, a napkin, a handful of bar nuts, “So I told Billingsly
She takes over then, switching the conversation to finances and he almost relaxes. It’s easy enough to answer, things are very straightforward now.
He merely dropped the sneer and sniffed, turning his back fully to focus on Rebecca. It was an old trick of Father’s, to make the room feel as if they were an inch tall, and then cement his status by completely ignoring them and it seemed it would work again, because the chatter picked up but in a hushed tone and everyone avoided them.
“I don’t know what I did but I’m sorry,” Harry cut him off, the smell of whiskey and pub and cigarette smoke proceeding him, rambling with a manic look, “Honestly, I’m sorry, I don’t know what I can do to make it up to you but I’m sorry and I miss you and I l—”
“What my associate is trying to say is that he’s the head of the department of Magical Child Services in London. He’s not absconding with the child, simply trying to remove her from the disaster area.” These where bits and pieces of phrases he’d heard Harry use before on aurors. They usually worked well. Dropping his voice lower and leaning towards the auror, who was so young it made him nauseous, “I highly doubt that any of us want this young one to see her family in
they were freed and heading home, Harry chattering beside him while they aparated and then walked the rest of the way home. Whereas the conversation through dinner had made him irritated and given him a headache, the smooth and cadenced speech next to him was soothing, punctuated by introspective pauses that he only had to nod or shake his head to. What sort of inferences Harry made, what he’d thought of the food and their strategies. He bounced back and forth between topics easily, his excitement palpable, despite his muted tone. Their house was exactly as they’d left it, just a little too small and full of their things. It felt better than any spell, just knowing they were blessedly
and he says, “I can’t promise I’m worth your time because I’m still proving it to myself. You talk to furniture and pretended to argue with me and I don’t do the same but I’m still... I’m still trying to figure out who I am and what I’m doing.”
His hands trembled with unspoken things—the ghost he was twisting into a poltergeist, with pain and agony fueling the change, wringing out every
He felt the room grow very small and he could already see the pained and upset expression on Harry’s face as he realized that he had lost them their chance. He didn’t dare look at Liza or John, knowing they wouldn’t help him there.
It took him another hour to clear out what was left in the house. A few more compression curses in the bedrooms, the bathrooms charmed to flood and drown their victims, blasting and charring curses designed to loosen limbs and leave the victim on fire. It was easy to recognize a lot of them, but removing them was a lot of work—simple to learn, difficult to master.
“Of course,” he replied, setting the notes neatly on the table. That was enough world history for one day. “Do we have everything?”
“Not an issue,” Harry interjected, nodding firmly, “I fill out similar forms all the time.” He seemed committed to fighting the paperwork dragon as it seemed so there was nothing to add.
It took roughly until closing time, when the lights flickered twice, much like in a theater, signifying that Patel’s shop was closing, for Draco’s heart to stop beating so fast. It took him the entirety of the five warning minutes to actually exit the shop.
“Is that a Zabini family secret?” Draco choked out. He felt at least one or two tears escape and the room felt far too warm for February.
“It’s always good to find what you like. What did you study in school?” Thomas leaned in, eager to find out more. They were so inquisitive, it was borderline intrusive.
The feelings within him, particularly as they passed November and headed full tilt into December were always mixed. Part of him was deeply, secretly, relieved that he didn’t need to handle his father in his post-trail life. Maybe it was wrong to feel that way; mostly because he could vividly remember the time where his father’s opinion was the only thing that mattered. And that part of him that still reared its naive head would remind him what a terrible son he was. Then there was another part of him that was glad that his father, who had dragged him a child and his mother, however willing she was, into the Dark Lord’s most intimate plans, was gone. They could have easily died at any moment, but it never matter to Lucius because of things like
“Well,” the Medi-witch said, “I really should take this to the Head Auror—“ she motioned to Harry to walk out of range, like it was up to Draco to distract Rebecca. His body and mouth taking over, after having seen Harry do it so often, using what he hoped was a gentler tone. “Rebecca, you said you ride your bike to school?”
from the Venture Brothers. That whole episode was golden and kept me from feeling too bad about the fictional Stone family. Who doesn’t love hot voil?
you would be with me. How insulted you would be that I’d gone this far just to pack it all in because of a mattress or a table or a clock. I could even hear your voice—“ it was a decent impression of his accent next— “Honestly, you defeated the most powerful wizard and you can’t be bothered to buy a mattress? A table? A
And that’s when the sound came back, all at once, a cacophony of muggle sirens and screaming people and spells being launched and blasting apart more explosive cars, their unholy cackling rising up. It wasn’t the death eaters. It simply couldn’t be.
was a sure constant. If Draco was being honest, he too hardly looked like he did in school and this probably worked to his advantage, despite the emptiness of the hour before closing in Patel’s Emporium of Fine Goods Near and Far. But he looked good, not perfect or golden, but good. He felt frozen.
Yes, Harry’s fashion sense is still terrible, and yes, he steals most of his clothes from Ron and buys the rest at consignment stores. Draco’s working on it.
Huge thank you’s to Bel for helping me come up with the original idea and encouraging me to turn this into A ThingTM and a huge thank you to Kat for listening to me warble, having no judgements when it came to fic and for stanning Drarry from many miles away. Bonus points to Di for being my rock ( since forever.)
“What I did, what I was bred to do, that’s a lot for a child to live up to… When I was in first year, I found a trophy in a case for my father.”
“Alright,” Ronald said, thumping him on the back with one of his frying pans that were also his hands, “Good luck mate, I’m rooting for you lot.” And he turn around and disappeared down the stairs to head back to his office, leaving Draco, shocked, in front of the door that announced “H. Potter” and below that, “Magical Child Protective Services.”
“I’m going to—to screw it up, or someone will say something and—” Why was he even saying this, Blaise didn’t care about his shortcomings, “That’ll kill me, if he ends up leaving—” Heavy hands, one carrying the Zabini family ring beset with Barbados pearls, rested on his shoulders, forcing him to focus away from the carpet swimming below him.
“And stuff...” Draco repeated, still staring at him. Matilda seemed to look between the two, sliding over some silver and copper coins across the counter slowly, unwillingly to break apart their staring.
It seemed that he had two options before him, could see the forking paths in front of him stretching into the dark horizon. He could brush it off, say something somewhat kind, like “Well I’m glad you decided to shower
“God, two miserable sights in the same restaurant.” And his smile turns a little sadder at him. “It was another rough case today—I couldn’t leave him alone. And,” he swallowed, and Draco realized in that moment that he was just as scared of this thing between them as he was, “I can’t promise I won’t do the same thing again, Draco.” It sounded like a promise; a promise to try because this was worth it. A promise to trust without looking to see if this were the light at the end of the tunnel or an incoming train, because they’d be walking together, facing outward.
, the intoxicating feel of trust, barely earned but returned in spades, and it hit him with the strength of the ocean cresting a violent wave that stole his breath and his feet out from under him. But the thought itself, the secret confession, was quiet under the sounds of Harry.
Draco turned around, still in his shined oxfords and looked at Harry. There was discomfort in every lean line of his body.
“Just like how everyone learns charms or potions or transfiguration. Just, Maths and literature and grammar and such.”
There were notes on the government, the branches that seemed similar yet different to the ministry here, the rules, the regulations, the funding. It looks like they’d been using elected people for centuries, something on a scale that didn’t happen here. The Minister was always voted in by the Wizegamont who were chosen half by status and half by local election. Even something as simple as taxes, rules that had been in place for the past five hundred years in Britain seemed up to debate in Mage-USA. Never mind the controversy of funding a school system that benefited other nations. Her notes read:
He was very lucky, though he didn’t really deserve it he was starting to realize when the carnage had settled down.
“It’s a bit of Sisyphean task, in a sense, the second we start to get caught up, there’s more to add—but that’s why I try and focus on more concrete projects that have more reasonable goals.”
“Draco?” He looked up. Harry was standing up next to him, stretching, a list being pocketed in the same script. “Ready to go home?”
“Can you describe as to the reason why?” He knows, objectively, why they need to ask. They need to know if he’s been into anything that could cause undo harm to a child.
By the time Draco looked up from his tea at Harry sitting at his desk, dutifully writing reports with what he called a biro, it had been another couple of hours, but time had been fluctuating oddly since he’d arrived at the Ministry of Magic.
day, it felt like. Then there was the stressful visions when he slept—never quite a nightmare and never quite a dream. Just the same feeling compounded in the dark. Alone, only seeing flashes of other people, other moments, other feelings before the dark loneliness was back.
He just had to be strong and keep Draco with him, like the moon drawing the tide back to her. That’s all they needed.
Draco ignored him, turning to head down the lane, towards the nearest apparition point, when Harry reached out with a firm grip and stopped him, “Draco I said
“Yellow would be ghastly,” Draco seemed to be agreeing, going along with this bizarre conversation as if he weren’t sitting here talking with his former mortal enemy and instead just chatting with a stranger about rug colors of all things, “Go with gray. Or taupe. Safe and neutral.”
“Mother,” he said sharply, reminding himself of his father and the words felt like a knife wound. Her jaw clicked shut behind silent lips and they stared again at one another. She had often remarked how much he looked like his father, prior to the war. He wondered if she regretted the comparison now.
“Well, it just happened to be luck,” he said neutrally, stepping into her view again. “We were on our way to visit her.”
“You missed it,” Draco told him with mild interest, “Just so happens that same lot of aurors just walked in and posted a list of those Injured or killed which sent everyone in a frenzy to hospital.” Harry frowned but he wasn’t a part of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement during the war so maybe that was standard procedure for mass casualty events.
Draco nodded slowly, eyebrows back to their normal level of shock. Not speaking as much seemed to be working so far, even though he desperately wished to comment on Harry’s lacksidasical hair (as was standard) and the rips in Weasley’s jeans (which was standard five bloody years ago.) He must have entered some alternate, highly advanced pocket dimension nine months ago where Harry Potter was nice, where Ronald Weasley didn’t instantly punch him in the nose upon viewing and where they just sort of went to pubs as if that were a thing that people did.
He’s clearly moved to the UK at some point the traitor, but seriously. If there’s separate quidditch teams for each country and prime ministers/presidents for each country then why the fuck would the Irish go to Hogwarts. Just—everything about Jo’s expansion into other magical governments and schools is the worst world building I’ve ever seen which is why I tore it apart and have rebuilt it in a way to attempt to reflect the actual countries and cultures they represent. (Why you ask? It’s British Imperialism baby.)
