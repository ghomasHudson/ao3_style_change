“Too much weight was placed upon you, yes, but also upon all of us. It made us forget that you are only a teenager, like every other student at this school. For that, I feel I must apologise. We should’ve done better,” Mcgonagall says solemnly. The atmosphere of the room has dampened even further, like someone has wrapped the room in a wet blanket, and Harry cannot stand it.
is news. It is the exact kind of happenings he had foreseen in coming back to Hogwarts. The suspense, the panic, the constant threat. It may always be his home, in some twisted nostalgic shape or form, but it has also brought him so much misfortune that he isn’t sure he could recount it all in one sitting. Frankly, he is sick to death of it; he wants no further part in this bullshit. If only Malfoy wasn’t bang smack in the centre of it all.
It sounds harsh and ill-meaning against Neville’s kind words, and Harry curses himself for his ineptitude with social skills. They both share an uneasy chuckle, and he suspects neither of them find anything especially amusing in the recycled joke.
“It’s fine,” Harry interrupts, studiously looking at Malfoy’s bed instead. This makes him blush even harder for some god forsaken reason and suddenly, he needs air. He feels like he can’t breathe- every inhale is too big, yet somehow still too little. “I have to go. Sorry.”
“Ha Ha. You’re hilarious,” Malfoy deadpans, obviously thinking that Harry is making a jab at him about their earlier conversation.
hiiii ok so harry speaks to mcgonagall.... has a moment with justin.... has more draco moments..... you'll have to read i guess ;)
“For sure, I would’ve asked for at least three bands,” Harry says, light-heartedly, and he receives a laugh in response. It is a bit too melancholy to be a complete victory, but he allows himself to feel the slightest bit chuffed for managing to put the tears on hold, at least. Then, he looks at Justin’s trembling lips and a wave of guilt envelops him for being happy at someone else's grief.
At the entrance, there is a tall basket of books, right by the door, with a note attached. It reads: ‘half-price’. He heads towards them, judging that cheap is probably better anyway, but Hermione grabs his arm gently. “Harry, shall we go down there?” she points to the shelves by the man with the now humongous book, eyes bright with her intellect.
“I’ll buy it,” he says, perhaps a little too excitedly. Silky leather strokes his hand when he grabs it; maybe it is his imagination, but the book seems to shudder upon touching it.
Not anticipating the comment, Harry snorts quietly. At this, Malfoy appears moderately shocked. He seems to forget his facade at times- it is increasingly inconsistent. Having to uphold such a stiff wall all the time must be tiring, it is natural he would slip sometimes, even in spite of being the natural cold bastard that he is. It’s either that, or Malfoy is half way to lunacy. With the way he flips between a blank state one second, to something resembling normalcy the next, it’s also a plausible explanation. Harry can understand it, at least- the switching on and off. You can be riding a gigantic tidal wave of anger, pain and loss, only to find yourself sliding along a bubbling stream in the next instance.
. Hermione and Ron may have gone about it thoughtfully, but he still felt it. Their scared eyes gave away their fear, whether it was for, or even of him.
Harry takes one final glance at the Astronomy Tower, remembering how vindicated he had felt seeing Malfoy’s trembling figure above him, wand raised at the man who offered him a chance, and decides for the final time he has no choice. It could be dangerous. There will be no more deliberating. He is formally investigating Draco Malfoy on the grounds of extremely dubious behaviour.
He edges towards the sheet, noting the celebratory whoops and proclamations of disappointment from girls and boys alike, who have already read the list. Blaise Zabini marches past him, dark and striking features looking distinctly pissed off. Seamus and Dean cheer and embrace in a bear hug, appearing to have been roomed together.
It’s all he says. Vacant words in a hollow room. After being such a loudmouth, Harry senses that something is wrong- thinks he always sensed it, in a way. He squeezes his hands and eyes, finding his own tension in both.
He clasps it in his fingers in disbelief, unsure whether he is dreaming. A flick to his arm isn’t helpful- since he is in a numb state tonight, he wouldn’t be able to feel anything anyway. When Anthony lets out gargantuan snore, he realises that this is indeed reality.
Greeting Harry like an old friend, the sun shines through the window, its rays reaching out to stroke every corner and surface in the room. Everything is touched by its light; it is radiant, and glimmering with the arrival of a new day.
Having had enough of the self-deprecation, Harry places his hand on the taller boy’s arm and squeezes firmly, hoping it will make him listen. “I..uh..understand. It sucks for them, but it sucks for
Out here, in the muggy and oppressive air, he finds that running away from these problems hasn’t helped. If anything, it just makes him feel cowardly, which in turns reminds him of something he has been frantically repressing ever since it happened.
“I know!” he says, proud of himself for being able to remember the right spell to use- even if it is a third year charm- considering his mind feels like it has been skinned, chopped and skewed. He points his wand at his face, trying to ignore how menacing that feels. “Scourgify!” he exclaims with confidence.
A part of Harry’s grand plan includes spending more time with Ron and Hermione. First and foremost because they are his best friends, and the love that he has for them is embedded deep within him, has become as fundamental to his living as the lungs with which he breathes. Secondly, and perhaps selfishly of him, because they are a distraction.
In the meantime, he casts a feeble Stasis Charm in the hope that it might stabilise whatever condition Malfoy is in, which appears to be pretty bad, judging by his infrequent breathing. He probably does something wrong, Hermione would know instantly, but he begs to every God that is listening that it is adequate enough to do the job. Never before has he regretted not paying attention in Charms quite like this.
Harry can feel his word vomit coming up only split seconds before it happens, and he is rendered helpless as he prepares for whatever bullshit is about to come out of his mouth. He blames the silence- it was killing him to not break it.
“Funny one,” he says to nobody in particular and caves into the itching to get them out again. Who is he to argue with the universe?
“You reckon?” asks Justin softly. His hair is dishevelled from where his rings got stuck, and it falls down his cheeks in waves which frame his heart-shaped face.
“Don’t be stupid, my love. Justin, any friend of Harry’s is a friend of mine,” she swears, as if they have been close all their lives, rather than two people who barely know each other's names, let alone any detail of real substance.
“I think he’s harmless at the moment. He seems very subdued. It’s curious.” adds Hermione thoughtfully and they all chance a fleeting glance in Malfoy’s direction.
Scanning his eyes for the toy, he sees nothing. He pretends to not be looking and has a crack at just casually laying in bed, until he gives up and makes a cough to grab Malfoy's attention. In the back of his mind, Cindy the spider scolds him for forgoing the decision that they had made together.
For a while, every direction he takes is a swamp of students dressed in mid-autumn gear. Seriously, it is like gazing upon a field of bobble-hats when the first years finish their lessons. It has always been this way- offensive knitwear is, in all ways but literally, a Hogwarts tradition. However, this year, the larger crowds forming indoors as a result of the cold weather, bring Harry much grievance and anxiety. So instead he finds himself seeking alternative passages, and gets to know the castle in yet another way. One would almost think he was up to no good again, with the level of sneaking and evading he is doing. Only this time he is running from chatty eleven year olds, not an evil Dark Lord.
Harry thinks about the paper all day, wondering what could be on it. Half of him wants to be concerned that he is so dedicated to acquiring the knowledge but the other half, the louder half, says
“I‘ll tell you the same thing I told Mcgonagall and every other fucking teacher who has come to interrogate me today: I don’t know. One moment I was taking a walk, the next thing I know I’m on the floor,” snaps Malfoy, hostile.
“I might have to pull you up on that. Everything I’m doing for this entry is starting to make me age faster than Filch. Did you know he’s only forty-three?’ says Neville. They put away their trays and start to head out of the door.
At the weekend, Harry, Ron and Hermione take a trip to The Three Broomsticks after sitting in the cold all day for the Quidditch match. Ron is feeling miffed, he can tell, about not being allowed to participate this year, and claims that he needs to get sloshed to dull the pain. Harry knows it isn’t a smart idea for himself to fly, regardless of him being an eighth year. One little episode, and he could collapse off of his broom before anyone is any the wiser. That doesn’t mean his heart didn’t ache when, in reflex, he spotted the snitch before either the Hufflepuff or the Gryffindor seeker.
“You’re joining me then?” says Malfoy with an arched eyebrow, distaste written all over him. He ignores the stumble, which simultaneously vexes Harry and leaves him pleasantly surprised. Idly, he wonders if he would ever get so desperate as to pay Malfoy to bully him.
Malfoy shuffles against the wall, looking uncomfortable now that they have no excuse to bicker. If he is considering ignoring Harry again, he
Justin pulls a device out of his bedside table drawer, and Harry recognises it as a Muggle smartphone, which Justin informs him has been adapted for Magical use. Ashamedly, he is absolutely clueless on how to use it and Justin attempts at giving him a trial. Harry quickly gets the hang of it and he entertains the mental image of Ron and his thick thumbs trying to press down the fiddly keys. Excitedly, he thinks of the number that Erin had given him whilst in Hyde Park and he resolves to stir up that famous Gryffindor courage in order to ask Justin if he might be able to contact her. Her sparkling eyes and freckles, lightly splattered like paint on an artist’s apron, had ignited a peace inside of him that he had not thought possible any longer.
“Welcome, my dears!” Madame Malkin startles, busy tailoring and trimming a petite girl’s robes next to the expanse of mirror, which seems to stretch for miles somehow in the tiny room. “Do try to not cause a fuss in my doorway, if you will.”
“Pansy Parkinson,” she grumbles unhappily, but then brightens a fraction, “Padma, and Susan. I’m actually rather excited to be with those two. Susan is lovely and Padma has incredibly interesting theories on Runes in the Age of Alexandria the Forlorn which I cannot wait to hear.”
One of the changes this year is that all students are required to take a Muggle Studies class, regardless of their OWL and NEWT choices- including Eight Year. Especially, even, as Harry had gathered from the way Mcgonagall had sent a brisk look at the Slytherins in his year upon announcing it. It seems that even Mcgonagall, with all her talk of house unity and forgiveness, can’t shake some prejudice. That is what the war did. It took everything you believed in, everything you thought you stood for, and turned it all on its head, until you’re not sure what the point is, other than plain survival, other than avoiding joining the pile of dead. Other than protecting the people around you.
This first sheet, however- he has some semblance of understanding of it, though his certainty dwindles with every passing beat of his pounding head. Despite what his abysmal years as a Potions student might indicate, Harry is able to at least deduce that they are, in fact, ingredients. If not for the recognisable elements, then because seeing Malfoy stealing supplies from the Potions classroom is pretty much a telltale sign.
Seeing the wounded look on Ron’s face, Harry rushes to apologise, awash in guilt. He is being a dick, he is painstakingly aware, and Ron is fulfilling his role as both best friend and boyfriend perfectly. It’s just a lot- all of it.
Wind filtering through his hair and cooling his burning forehead is what confirms it. He is at the Astronomy Tower.
“What! Really?” she huffs in amusement, “Harry, you really are a bit of a mystery, aren’t you?” And Harry finds that this makes him sound a whole lot more interesting than he actually is. Yeah, he killed a dark wizard. Big deal. He spent the entire time moping about it, and getting unnecessarily angry. Still does- even. In that respect, nothing has changed at all.There is not a single thing mysterious about him.
“So,” Harry says, unable to hold it in any longer. He ignores Malfoy’s glare, not giving a fuck whether he has interrupted a good part in the book, or whatever, “You’re the owner of a toy dragon? I didn’t think of you as the ‘pet’ type, you know.”
“Maybe,” agrees Ron but, likewise, without much enthusiasm. There is a sudden influx of noise as a group of Ravenclaw girls arrive in a flurry. As he watches them scurry to their dorms in fits of giggles, the new sigil and tie for eighth years is glaringly obvious. He hardly notices it on himself but he finds it a little jarring on others.
hi hope u enjoyed reading!!! THIS TOOK SO LONG SO PLS COMMENTS AND KUDOS i beg... i would be very appreciative <33333333 !!! i tried to keep this chapter quite centred on harry and his friends because i feel like they havent gotten enough development yet- but of course still building the plot (which by the way is going to be quite big once it comes- just setting the foundations... i have a feeling this fic is gonna be way longer than i had originally planned)!
ALSO QUESTION: would you guys prefer if i updated less regularly (every week-two weeks) with 10k+ updates, or at least once a week with 4k/5k??? because as much as i would love to, i probably can't do chapters this length every few days, because i won't have time for literally anything else in my life. trust me, i wish i could... lemme know x
When he ultimately doesn’t show up for breakfast, Ron comes to the dorm to get him, with a levitated plate of food trailing behind him. It smells delectable, a true Hogwarts breakfast, but the scent makes Harry feel queasy.
“You’re no fun, ‘Mione,” Ron had complained grumpily, and was promptly hit with the force of her scorn. He had frowned and aimed for an angry bite of his crispy toast. The crumbs fell down his shirt and a splodge of the tangerine marmalade fell onto his white shirt. He groaned and Hermione looked smugly satisfied. For his part, Harry had simply eaten his own toast in bewilderment and thanked Merlin for being single.
“Alright, yeah. Tough luck about Malfoy, what a ponce. Tony is alright though. I think he’s left already. An early bird, that one.”
“What do you mean? What did they say?” asks Neville. During the course of the discussion, Harry’s mind desperately tries to fill in the missing gaps. He tries, and fails.
It’s absence almost makes him run back, and he realises how foolish he is. He wouldn’t even know which way to go. He feels tears well up in his eyes against his will and he fights to keep them down. The atmosphere seems to feed on his anxiety, growing stronger as he becomes weaker. What if this is dark magic? For all he knows, Malfoy could have been tricking him into a false sense of security these last few days, waiting to pounce.
He pads over to the window, feet hitting the cold and hard wood with soft plods. The curtains have not been opened once in all the time he has been sleeping here, as he understands. The fabric is moth-bitten and musty; a cream colour with heavy drawstring ropes that hang lifelessly. Sirius would have hated them, with their haughty sense of importance in both the grandeur and scale, he knows. Along the hemline, there are chunky tassels which swing threateningly when he goes to open the curtains. He meets resistance as he tries to tug them across the rail with all the strength left in his weakened body, which is admittedly not a lot.
“You- uh..are very, uhm, pretty?” he accidentally phrases it as a question in his nervousness and he wants to slap himself for his lack of charm.
“Hermione!” he yelps, and she cackles, doubling over. Ron shoves his hat back on, as if it is his protective helmet.
He turns around to face him, somehow feeling alright about the situation. Distractions are welcome. Perhaps his legs knew where they were taking him, working where his mind couldn’t. Often, Harry wonders if his body has had to grow a new brain to make up for the fact that the original one has gone off the rails.
on his cauldron, but it doesn’t appear to work. He grabs at his hair, messing it up even further, and his glasses finally just plop off his nose. In irritation, he vigorously thrusts the cauldron into his bag too, which despite being quite petite, still barely fits.
He is now once again walking around the grounds aimlessly, his only goal to not give in to whatever demon is plaguing the castle. It is more difficult said than done, and many times has he felt his eyes prick with tears for no apparent reason. The irrevocability of it makes him feel weak, and he keeps his eyeline low, ashamed to look up though the only judgement he would face is from the sky itself. In a way it is worse; he would almost rather be teased by a first year than have the pressure of his mind and the earth’s eyes on him.
“I bet you’re gonna be a famous Quidditch player one day, Gin. I see it now: First successful Weasley- nation shocked!” he jokes in an attempt to change and drop the subject. If the implication of their previous conversation is what Harry thinks it is, he is both confused and a little angry. It hasn’t been that long since they broke up, he thinks heatedly. Maybe that’s unfair of him, but he recalls the weeks after it ended, and the bone-deep agony that he felt at each and every reminder of her. In his pit of despair, he had thrown away his favourite Quidditch magazines, the ones that they had shared together.
Anyhow, he is feeling fragile, and on edge. Too many questions and he might snap. That is why, when Justin approaches him next, as he has done four or five times so far, Harry will continue the pattern of smiling sheepishly, before running away. It is the understanding pity in Justin’s eyes that makes him the most frightened. There is nothing he would want to do less than have someone confirm all of
The horrified look on the other boy’s face is ingrained into his brain, destined to haunt Harry for the remainder of his failure of a life.
Justin raises his eyebrows, and even Anthony stifles a laugh, breaking his grouchy mood. Having seen it used with Muggles, Harry is aware that you don’t usually have the person at the other end of the line playing out loud like this, but he doesn’t know how to change it, and he is too scared to signal for Justin’s help.
He loses his grip on himself, breaths no longer coming uniformly but in harsh, jagged stabs to his chest. This has to be a dream.
Something stops him. He lets the question hang there instead, praying to whatever God is listening. And hang it does- for a bit too long, if you ask him.
Now, a new feeling, half relief and half dreadful anticipation. “What do you mean?” inquires Harry, though he isn’t sure he will be able to digest any response which isn’t just Malfoy calling him an idiot.
, because, thank god, he is actually interested in something. The relief of it makes him want to break down into tears. These three things are perhaps why he is so plagued with these intrusive, unrelenting thoughts. They must be.
Still, it is probably time to accept other help- something not from an inanimate object, no matter how much of a connection he feels with it. And even then, he can recognise that it’s not so much a loving bond, but more of an unhealthy obsession based on dependence.
Now on his wander around the castle, he gazes wistfully upon the first years buzzing from corridor to corridor. They seem to share a hive mind, swarms of young bees congregating in groups only; no child appears left behind. It’s heartwarming, all things considered. However, whilst they still retain that limitless energy that only eleven year olds seem to have the power to muster up, they do appear more subdued than normal, somehow. A sandy haired, thin girl hurries past him and he wonders whether she was the sister of the boy whom Harry had seen die, their eyes locked as he fell. A silly thought, but they shared the same hair colour at least, so it could have been possible. His heart clenches painfully as she smiles at him on her way.
So, he concludes, it’s time to get up. At least today it's easier. Small victories, Harry, small victories.
. When has it ever worked in his favour? The very existence of Hogwarts and magic itself denies reason, when you really think about. His entire life is illogical. There is no reason to get worked up about it now.
He blames Dudley for every cruel remark he ever made about the boys who dared to dress femininely at school, and Petunia for allowing it. As much as she pretended to turn a blind eye, her silence was compliance. He blames Vernon for perpetuating it, with his foul mouth and resentful nature, turning down the invites to meet the husbands that moved in down the road. The letters stopped coming after a while, and Harry can only imagine the spiteful responses that they received. Finally, he blames every single coward who sided with them. Whether it were Dudley’s sidekicks, or Vernon’s blustering and warty work colleagues. All of them were bullies. It’s not a sickness, no, but it’s
“No, don’t,” Hermione interjects from beside him. The ginormous ink blot has snuck onto her cheeks now, marring her dark skin, and Harry distantly thinks about how they should probably tell her. He won’t. Secretly he adores her most like this, a little frazzled, a little messy, and oh so full of ideas.
She just raises an eyebrow in an all-knowing manner, turns to Luna, taking her hand... and then that’s that. Harry frowns, slurps his now-frosty soup and turns to no-one.
Frowning, Mcgonagall responds, “I have to disagree, but of course we will support whatever decision you make. Have a think, and we will reconvene soon.” Her teacup is empty now, and Harry’s own pasty brew has gone stone cold. He feels a little guilty that he didn’t drink it; the ratio of milk to water was just far too high for him to tolerate.
The contrast between the Malfoy in his mind’s eye, and the one he sees in real life is jarring. It’s almost nauseating when Harry catches glimpses of his ungrudgingly blank face in class, or the dorm, or the common room- he is fucking
Bodies congregate the area surrounding the posted information, swarming and cramming each other in attempts to see it first. An elbows flies in his direction and almost jabs him in the eye; probably would have, had he not developed a Seeker's instinct from playing the position for six years straight.
First, Harry spots Draco Malfoy walking in late, clearly trying not to be noticed in creeping around the edge of the hall. He joins the Slytherin table at the very end, putting a considerable distance between himself and the rest of his peers. This makes the house appear even smaller than it is, the empty spaces speaking a thousand words at the current disdain of the house. Harry feels like he could be going into shock at the sight of his former enemy. He breaks out of his state to briefly laugh at himself. Enemy- really? At most, Malfoy was a pain in the arse. A melodramatic arsehole, who doubled as a bully and made idiotic decisions- absolutely. But he almost doesn’t want to grant the title of ‘enemy’ to such a weak person. Harry likes to think he deserves a more intimidating nemesis than Draco Malfoy and his stupid face.
She smirks jokingly and Harry thinks that she has become more confident in herself since the war. To be candid, he is delighted to see it. He has been concerned that the memories of Malfoy Manor, paired with the suffering of her parents who still struggle to remember their beloved daughter with real clarity, would be too much for Hermione to handle. On a good day, they don’t flinch from her touch; they allow her to tenderly repeat her name and sometimes, if they are lucky, they will have moments of recognition. Harry has seen it himself and it broke his heart into splinters. Though, clearly, she can handle it. He should have never doubted her.
Now, he converses with Neville, startled to discover that he has been dating Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff. Over on their table, she waves at them with a beaming grin and Neville blushes furiously. Harry is seriously happy for him, seeing the glee as clear as day on his round face, and promises to himself that he will make more of a conscious effort to keep up to date with his friend’s lives.
Suddenly, Neville clasps his shoulder and draws him a hearty hug. It is unexpected, and not entirely welcome at first. However, he should have long learnt not to underestimate the power behind one of the man’s infamous hugs, since it soon provides a little comfort. He squeezes back wholeheartedly.
He ignores the question in the comment, and instead throws it back in the bastard’s pointy face. “What about you, Malfoy? Maybe I had too much faith in you, but I thought you would be doing a bit more to prove yourself this year. Not in class?” he says, and he tunes out the part of him that deflates at how spiteful he sounds. Why did he ever think they could be anything less? Friendly civility, boring civility- it clearly doesn’t work for them. Harry hopes that Malfoy recognises this now- he feels mad with how much he wants him to- and decides to ditch this charade once and for all.
The penny drops and strikes the floor. Harry will remember the moment that jaws swung wide open and outrage exploded for years to come. Zacharius Smith seems to be booing from his seat on the Hufflepuff table, his angry features distorted in indignation. For the first time since the war, Harry sees Malfoy showing emotion. His eyes widen in shock, face white as a sheet. Harry cannot gage whether this is positive or negative. Hermione hums a murmur of approval and glares at the furious students in obvious contempt for their behaviour.
After his discovery of Malfoy’s stuffed pet, Harry had had no clue what to do with the rest of his day. He had waited for Malfoy to show up, anticipating a reaction that would have fueled Harry’s sudden hunger for a fight. Alas, the bastard was frustratingly absent from both the common room and the dormitory the entire day, and this left Harry feeling lost and a little disappointed. He was overwhelmingly bored, and concerned that if he stayed still for too long he may begin to deteriorate. So far the unfamiliarity of his sleeping quarters had both managed to unsettle him, in their strangeness, and comfort him, as he has no traumatic memories associated with them. Harry had been festering in his bed for a while, glaring at the plush dragon perched opposite him on Malfoy’s perfectly folded sheets, when the general sense of tediousness which hung around the room made the decision for him that he needed to leave. So he had exited the dorms, with no goal in mind other than keeping his mind at bay.
“Do you nee-” Harry says, assuming an aura of helpfulness, even if only to mask the fact that he actually wants to know why Malfoy is here. But he never finishes his words, for Malfoy abruptly turns away and, in a split second, withdraws from sight.
“As if,” snorts Ron, “We’ve been playing this for years, mate, and you’re still yet to win in a game. I think that’s a sign of shitness. In fact, ‘m pretty sure the only person you’ve beat is Neville- and he’s not the biggest competition out there.”
- complete with comically large cartoonish eyes and a spiky tail. He cannot believe it. Wonders truly never cease.
Rage has never looked so wonderful, he thinks, observing the confused expression on the boy’s face. Malfoy probably judges him as delirious with the way that he grins wildly back.
“I cannot say I am all together shocked,” she says with a slightly disheartened expression on her face, like his lack of enthusiasm for a job (which is ultimately half-violence and half paperwork) has disappointed her. This is exactly what he was afraid of. His heart sinks, and he realises with sovereign pain that the pressure of being Harry Potter is still there. When he says it in full like that, there’s a disconnect.
He would have never thought it to be Malfoy’s style. Credit given where credit is due, and the Slytherin has always been a fighter, tenacious and unrelenting. Perhaps the issue started when Mcgonagall then went and took the Slytherin away when she eradicated houses for the eighth years. It certainly made Harry feel a little stripped of identity, though he no longer relies on Gryffindor when searching for reasons to be prideful.
“Oh yeah, very. Can’t wait.” Harry says sarcastically, “My favourite part is when they string our guts up to dry. I think my intestines will look just great around Malfoy’s bed.”
He is slumped, clearly exhausted yet, undeniably, awake in his bed. Harry feels a weight lifted from his shoulders at the sight of him alive, and releases a sigh he didn’t know he had been holding in. Dressed in the light blue Hospital gown and only a fraction less pale than he had been yesterday, Malfoy looks minutes from death. Not quite the peace of mind that Harry was searching for. He aches to reach out and check, placing his hand over the boy's frail chest like he had before, that he is in fact still breathing.
Now there is nothing. And this is what signifies to Harry that Malfoy is awake on the other side of the dorm, probably eavesdropping. It makes him irritatingly self conscious of what stupid things he might have been saying.
At first, he is concerned that Malfoy has gotten himself into some sort of trouble again. Since the time outside Harry’s Defence lesson, there haven’t been any more public attacks on him, but Harry has frequently been worried that they may have turned private. Even more disturbing, is the fact that Malfoy is legally bound not to defend himself on the grounds of his probation. He is a free punching bag. And though everyone else seems to have forgotten this fact, the knowledge that the boys were never identified concerns Harry greatly. His gut says they are a real danger, that maybe this is linked to whatever Malfoy is up to.
“So what is the potion for?” he inquires. If he is having to spend free hours in this dungeon, he wants a bloody good justification for doing so.
The takeaways- Merlin, he admits freely that he would trade a Hogwarts meal for just one portion of Chow Mein Singapore Noodles in an instant, greasy as they may have been. There was something special about their tradition of watching Ron fumble with the TV remote whilst they spooned bucketfuls of fried vegetables into their ravenous mouths.
He remembers Malfoy’s dragon and a little life gets breathed back into him again as he huffs a laugh. Watching Malfoy in his peripheral vision, he collects his soup-soaked spoon from the bowl and begins to eat. Hermione seems satisfied, if the loss of her gaze is any indication. The meal is enjoyable, but Harry’s mind cannot settle, for it is suddenly rampant with curiosity for the boy that has become a stranger.
That seems too precarious, too unstable to be an ingredient. Of course, it is also possible that it could be linked to whatever spell Malfoy seems to be routinely practising. Whilst not a Patronus Charm, the silver bursts of light indicate that it could be perhaps within the same realm.
He stands up, straighter and more rigid than usual. Grabbing Harry’s bicep, which sends rippling sensations out from where they make contact, Malfoy pushes him out of his medical bay. He drops Harry’s arm as soon as he deems it far enough away, and gives him a gentle shove in the chest for good measure.
Inside his chest, his heart beats like an offbeat drum. He doesn’t mean it really, hopes that Malfoy doesn’t hear the question in his tone.
“Aha!” she says excitedly, “I see your tactic! Trying to change the subject won’t work on me Harry.” Damn it. “How come you were in London then ? Are you back in Scotland with the person you love?” She laughs again.
The unwanted awareness that he is in some form of denial is crushing. With the way that he militantly casts away the rogue thoughts that pester him throughout the day, and spends hours trying to wipe his mind during the night, it couldn’t be anything else. Then again, being in denial goes hand in hand with the implication that there is something he is trying to cover, and he refuses to acknowledge that too. You could say, if you can excuse the ridiculousness- he certainly can’t- that it is a double denial.
Just once, but it is enough for Harry. Enough to kick his brain back into rusty action. He waves his wand and shouts, “Expecto Patronum!” His stag takes off into the woods, a trail of silver, hopefully on it’s way to bring help.
“Bye Harry,” Neville waves and turns to walk down the corridor, which runs in the other direction. He only gets approximately halfway though, before sprinting back. “Wait!” Just thought I’d let you know that I think Malfoy is awake. I heard Pomfrey talking about it earlier when I swung by for something.”
“A dickhead,” says Harry, not bothering to beat around the bush. After all, why would he for someone who supposedly
Harry winces as the bruise to his heart, which flares up whenever he is reminded of someone he lost, is ripped apart in its current state of healing. It is as if somebody has plunged a knife into a partially-closed wound. Suddenly, he staggers to the nearest wall at the cutting realisation that everyday will be like this at Hogwarts. It’s overwhelming and he has the urge to scream into the nearest surface.
“Potter, will you please do us all a favour and shut the fuck up?” Harry looks up at him in shock. His chapped lips are curled in irritation, and he spits every word like they have been revving up beforehand. Momentarily, the whirling in Harry’s head pauses. It is still with anticipation, frozen with the weight of the moment, and then it cheers again with vivacity when Malfoy continues. “You vomited all over the freshly varnished floorboards, and it lasted for at least a revolting two minutes. I would know because I counted, thus I conclude: you’re not fine. So stop lying.”
She laughs, loud even with the phone as a buffer, and Harry is thrown back into the memory of that summers day in the bustling grass of Hyde park.
“Not really, sorry. Just thought you were quite good looking.” She grins good-naturedly and he’s shocked into speechlessness, rather humiliatingly.
“I’m not really sure, Professor,” he admits, avoiding her gaze and instead staring at the trim white quill on her desk. It isn’t a full confession, but it is all he can say without risking a panic attack. On the other hand, the idea of lying, of just going along with the Dark-Wizard-Fighting-Auror that the Wizarding world expects of him, leaves a sick and dirty taste in his mouth.
She nods, grudgingly accepting his point, but says with integrity, “Someone like you, Potter, would be invaluable to the Ministry. I can’t think of anyone more fitting for the job. If I'm honest, I am more than a little baffled at your decision.”
“Because you’re infuriating and the sight of you makes me want to break into Slughorn’s stores and down a bottle of his finest poison.” Malfoy says with utmost conviction, leaving Harry in disbelief at the fervor of the statement.
Malfoy never comes into the room. Harry detests that he wants to know why. Granted, the boy is a hard worker- he has to be in order to have almost topped Hermione throughout their school years- but the chances of him still scribbling away in the library with that high-arching quill of his are pretty low. Unless Madam Pince has taken him, and he debates the idea fearfully. He wouldn’t wish such a chilling end on anyone, even Malfoy.
As he lies there, cursed by his thoughts to stay awake even in spite of his need to sleep, he imagines that instead of some random dorm, Malfoy is in the lab right now. The image makes him restless to go and check, and a wave of self-loathing throttles him for entertaining the idea. Harry clenches a fistful of his pillow, willing his subconscious to pipe down. He envisages Malfoy: glasses on, sleeves rolled up and baring his hideous scarred Dark Mark proudly to the ghouls that lurk down there. The cauldrons bubble furiously, masking the noise of Malfoy scrawling more senseless Potions recipes.
Mcgonagall whips her wand twice sharply and it spurts out a vigorous jet of silver sparks, quelling the outbreak of discussion. “By this, I mean to say that we will no longer use the house points system. Students can visit any common room they choose, given that it is in the window of your curfew, and we have renounced the use of passwords.” Harry hears raucous whooping from Ginny and he irritably remembers Luna in the Ravenclaw common room. Already, gossip flits from person to person and he feels fondness at the childlike habits that he had resigned himself to never experiencing again. The horrors that he had faced over the past few years had certainly not made it difficult to forget the simple yet rich pleasure of childhood innocence. Rather, he had lived his life in black and white, aged beyond his years. He is unaccustomed now to the vibrant colours of youth and adolescence.
He treks across their dorm to the bathroom. The light inside flickers and again, he is thrown back to his conversation with Malfoy, whose pale face was illuminated by the blinking lamps of the library. Just as vivid as it were at the time, Harry finds the reminder of his humiliation and failure too much.
Ron and Hermione order for them both and when the food comes, simple but delectably gooey pizza, they all dig in ravenously. Conversation bounces between them and Harry zones out, thinking of his now very apparent status as a lone bachelor.
He’s not sure how long it has been when Ron and Hermione fall into the carriage, but Hermione automatically fastens the blinds shut. She then aims a silencing spell out of the window, and the world settles a little back into place, the commotion coming to an abrupt stop. Smiling at Harry, she collapses next to Ron on the seats and he notices their bedraggled appearances.
The office is not much different than when it belonged to Dumbledore; the mismatched collections of objects scattered around the room feel almost like an homage to his eccentricity. A well-used, bobbly pair of socks on the armchair by the tallest window, a curation of ivory coloured shells which stir up the stinging smell of seasalt and whisper to you with the sound of waves everytime you pass by, dotted along the top of the bookcase. There is even a Muggle yoga book sitting atop a table. In the madness, however, he finds a method. A neatness in the placements which is so distinctively un-Dumbledore that Harry instantly knows Mcgonagall has strategically placed each individual item, probably trying her best to recreate what cannot be recreated. The image is so honest, so blue, that Harry suddenly wants to hug her, recognising her own grief in himself. He feels it too when he flicks through all of Sirius’s old motorbike magazines, grasping at the pretense that he understands his godfather. A man that he never honestly knew.
He and Justin share a glance, and Justin shrugs his shoulder before exclaiming, “Crap!” as his potion begins to bubble over. Chuckling, Harry rushes to help him and, hey, if they both burnt their robes in the process, who can blame them? It is all in the name of magic.
Neville huffs, “Religion. Merlin, it’s so confusing to me. Wizards don’t have gods in the same way. I suppose when all miracles can just be explained by magic, it sorta takes the mystery out of it. Still, that’s a Pureblood thing, I guess. Lots of Half-bloods and Muggleborns are religious, so maybe the practise might get adopted.”
“Are you quite sure? You have always had an aptitude for the sport, though I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you this. Madam Hooch will be gravely disappointed, I think she has been holding out hope that you could be her next big star,” she says and Harry thinks,
Lifting his hand, Harry examines the way the sparkles look on his dark skin. In some ways, it is a sweet reminder of the love and joy of the couple that it came from. In many others, it just serves to provoke the memory of the way that Malfoy had briefly scanned him upon looking up from his desk, clearly judging Harry as dirty and uncivilised. The image of it certainly makes him feel so.
Indignant, Ron storms off, the loose strands of hair on his body forming a trail behind him. The sun shines down at them, seemingly chuckling too, and his freckled scalp gleams as the rays hit him. Harry didn’t think it possible, but he and Hermione laugh even harder at this, bending over to catch their breath.
“Hey, guys,” he says flatly, wishing he had more to contribute to the group other than his sombre demeanour. He hopes that if he is fated to woe, he is at least giving off a brooding and mysterious aura-
“They’re a plague on this neighbourhood, Petunia,” he had blustered, pink neck looking as if it was about to burst. Peering through the grate in his cupboard door, he had watched as Aunt Petunia sympathetically agreed, rubbing his back in solidarity. Harry hadn’t understood his rage at all. On the days where he was forced to do work in the front garden, he often saw the pair, hand in hand, walking along the pavement. They looked head over heels in love with each other and, every few minutes, would lean in for a soft and intimate kiss. Harry had thought that Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could learn a lesson from this affectionate and seemingly harmless relationship. Their marriage consisted of bullying Harry and spoiling Dudley, and that was about it.
Still, his hands are clammy and his heart is hammering, and he doesn’t understand the strength of his reaction. Harry supposes that Malfoy is just another reminder of what he is trying so hard to forget. Despite this, he’s a little too perturbed at Malfoy’s figure, now hunched over in perhaps an attempt to make himself invisible. He would have expected the twat to make a conscious effort to rebuild his image. Prior to the trials, he envisaged, whenever the thought popped into his head, a boot-licking Malfoy throwing money around in order to try and erase the reputation that surrounded them like a black cloud. Instead, Lucius Malfoy got sentenced to life in prison, rightfully so. Narcissa Malfoy had broken down into all-consuming tears at the news, and Harry had had to make a hasty exit, feeling agonised by the sight of her body crumpled on the floor, for some reason. Malfoy Junior, however, had simply remained in his seat, stony and cold, whilst his father had been condemned. He had been pardoned, but there was no sense of pleasure in his face. Staring straight ahead at seemingly nothing in particular, he looked as if he wasn’t present in the room. Lifeless, even. His grey eyes, usually quick and cutting, were sunken and like an empty chasm. The hair, which had become so widely recognised during the press release of the trials, had dirtied itself into matted clumps that drooped onto his face, obscuring his sharp features.
In a rush of impatience, Harry snatches it and it tears right down the middle, obscuring a large number of the names. Fingers mildly shaking, he tries to hold it together. The sense of foreboding is tearing up his insides, a million jagged shards which cut him like glass as he breathes.
Proving himself a real pain in the arse, and Harry wrong, Malfoy starts striding down the corridor without so much as a pity glance in Harry’s direction. This won’t do. He is determined to get something out of this- at least some sort of justification for being suspicious. Otherwise, he will just feel like a twat. More so than usual, that is.
Daring a fleeting glance at the Slytherin table, Harry is met with nothing but the curious eyes of the first years and he whips his head back before anyone can question his actions. Ginny hits the back of his head with a piece of toast and he realises that he has been spotted.
They don’t speak for a few minutes and he almost drifts off to sleep. Beyond him, the mountainous landscape is shrouded in dark clouds, and it is wonderfully moody. He had always thought of the wind as an agent of chaos, unpredictable and vicious. Now, he finds it soothing to be blown about. If only he had a tea, then he would be truly peaceful. Oh, and if the Slytherin across from him went away. Having your longtime rival join your midnight brooding is never the greatest source of relaxation. And yet, absurdly, he is- relaxed, that is. He thinks about how proud Dumbledore would be to see him not throttling Malfoy at the nearest opportunity, and isn’t sure whether that makes him want to do it more or less.
At one particularly low point in his exploring, he opens the door to what he assumed would be another corridor, and rather catches Seamus and Dean in the act for the second time. This time it was at least seventy-five degrees more compromising than the last.
It is a sunny day- unexpectedly so after the cruel storm of last night. Basking in the rays, like a flower after a long spell of rain, Harry contemplates the idea of running away to a hot country and setting up residence in the countryside there. He could spend all his days like this- warming the cold inside of him, and learning to unthaw his muscles from their broken state. He imagines a stream trickling through a wide garden, whose unending trees and tweeting birds are privy to his eyes only. Perhaps he would take up gardening, or something else physical in nature that could keep his mind at rest. The appeal of it almost has him running to the nearest Floo, and Harry has to restrain himself from rushing off with great difficulty. Logically, he knows that denying the orders of both Mcgonagall and Kingsley would spell out his death sentence in big, bold, underlined letters. His stay at Hogwarts must be endured, however depressed that may make him feel.
Suddenly, something hits him on the crown of his head. He lifts his hand up to feel, but there is nothing there but his greasy hair. As confused and dazed as he is at this hour, he is certain he felt it. His fingers pat the bedsheets around him, searching in the darkness for a clue. They fall upon something small, rough and wrinkled all over, and he comes to the bemusing conclusion that it is another piece of paper.
In the end, he says none of this. “Not that I can think of,” Harry responds, downtrodden. Anxiously, he jounces his leg. The quill rattles in its pot, and he realises that the entire desk is shaking along with him.
No, he’s going to stay outside. Do something worthwhile and, Merlin’s Beard, healthy. The sun beams brightly, which invites warmth to drizzle through Harry in a manner more satisfying than any Warming Charm.
“I hope you are all well on this pleasant night, and I trust that you have all had a safe journey here.” says Mcgonagall warmly, clasping her hands together, “There is not much to say tonight other than I wish you all a happy and studious year here at Hogwarts. Alas, there are a few important notes that I would like to touch on before we feast.”
He looks different today, put together, and even more angular than usual. Sharp, as if he could cut Harry in two, maybe more, with just a glance. Dressed from head to toe in black, his pale skin and snowy hair stand out as starkly as the moon does in the sky. What ruins the effect is the swollen black eye, and the dark splatter of bruises which lead a trail down his cheek and neck, before disappearing beneath his high collar.
Harry is about to reply agreeably when an aggressive vibration buzzes from somewhere in the room. He has no idea what the culprit could be, but he is certain that it’s in Justin's direction.
. It feels almost cruel now to prod at both his and the other boy’s old wounds like this when they are so close to healing. Still, he can’t quite shake it. Some would call it self-sabotage, and he can’t find it in himself to disagree with that.
They are a group of teenagers, both emotionally and physically scarred, who prevailed in the face of a madman, and who came out the other side of hell’s road. Harry feels that he is justified in having pride in that. A small island of easy camaraderie in a vast ocean of students, they dish out the food and enjoy the small luxury of friendship.
“I wish I had a tea right now,” he says to break the stillness. Immediately, he wishes he could take it back and continue on in civil silence. Another length of time passes, the wind beats down on them harder, and Harry accepts that he isn’t getting a response.
The lanterns flicker in the dim light of the library, casting shadows upon the walls of books. It is pretty empty now, being a Sunday evening, just a few stray study-fanatics dotted around. This is fortunate for him, considering that he is covered head to toe in glitter. On the way over, he steadfastly refused to meet people’s gaze and Ron had tried his hardest to assure Harry that nobody was looking. Ron is not a good liar.
“Relax, I didn’t try to off myself. At least not technically,” Malfoy tips his head back, fed up. The words rip into Harry’s stomach. And then Malfoy is deflating, the energy leaving his body once and for all. He whirls around and his eyes are blank. “I think you should go now, Potter. You’ve done your part and I’m unfortunately still here,
- seems quiet and unassuming, even if he is still a pompous twat. His lean frame shuffles onto the end of the eighth year bench and Harry can just about see him reach out for a bread roll from where he is in the middle. The people around Malfoy lean away as he nibbles the roll, and Harry cannot make sense of the small flare of anger that sparks up at that.
would never be sitting here with sixth-day hair and fresh stains on his jeans from where he spilt his cup of tea upon being handed it by Mcgonagall. His hands had been trembling as he accepted the delicate ceramic. Or maybe he would. Harry has never been very skilled at knowing himself.
As normal, Malfoy shoots to the bathroom, leaving a blur of black and white in Harry’s vision, a streak of monotone in the warm room.
hiiii guys :-D ITS A YEAR SINCE i started this fic wowee that’s insane and i’ve only done 13 chapters oop.... hopefully it will be quicker from now on!! back with another fat chapter, i think i need to accept that i’m unable to write short ones apparently since they all get to like 10k lol. i think i quite like this chapter but also i have not read it over it in its entirety so who knows LOL there are probably so many mistakes- feel free to point them out but don’t be mean pls :-(. have fun besties xoxoxx
The following silence eats up his thumping pulse, the only noise he can hear is the ominous melody of nothing.
“Ugh,” Ron groans, “You torture me, you do. As if I won’t get enough of that with Zabini.” Then he appears to form a joke inside his head as he sniggers, “Hey, we each have our own personal Slytherin sleeping-buddy. Fun”
“Thank you for that, Mr Murphy,” Professor Mcgonagall says wryly and Harry now witnesses a fifth year named Olivier shrugging cheekily in response.
They all share a quiet snicker at the idea. The level of toxicity currently residing in Harry’s socks is probably more dangerous than Voldemort himself.
For a moment, he convinces himself that Malfoy is about to say that it is, that he won’t stand for Harry’s company. Ever contrary, the boy just turns his lean figure to the view, so magnificently vast Harry feels like it must stretch out beyond our universe, and answers, “No.”
if Malfoy were to give up this dumb facade. But then again, thinking of the Malfoy of the common room, he is not so sure anymore.
Malfoy sucks in two consecutive deep breaths. Nothing is said for a few seconds, but he can sense something is coming, so he remains still. His head tells him that if he moves, he could shatter what’s left of this delicate situation.
As he does so, a biting wind hits him and his legs wobble. He ungracefully falls back on his arse but manages to throw his hands out backwards to catch him in the nick of time. Hot in the face, he tries to recollect his dignity from shattering completely by straightening his back and clearing his throat. It only brings more attention to it.
The morning of his return to Hogwarts comes around so swiftly that Harry feels like he has whiplash.
As it happens, it proves a good distraction. Soon Harry’s eyes are drying a little, enchanted by what they see before it. The incandescence is strong and as the surrounding area comes to light, he is able to spot where the sky begins once more. It helps him breathe a little easier, but he still refuses to look at the floor. You never know when an enemy may attack, not until it is too late. Eyes up, Harry.
Harry nods stiltedly, not really hearing what Dean is saying, and stumbles out of the room  just as the pair break into giggles. It is in the nick of time, if the gasps and continued ruffles of clothing ringing down the corridor are any indication.
“I dunno whether an accent that thick can pull off anything quite as cool sounding as Dumbledore, though.” adds Ron jokingly. Harry personally thinks now that Dumbledore sounded everything but cool, as he terrified them all with descriptions of all the ways in which they could die brutally on the school grounds. Very comforting.
“You really are shit at this game, aren’t you?” Ron pokes teasingly, although it is, in all fairness, a justified point. Harry is seemingly lousy at all games, as he has come to realise over the past few days- thank you to Malfoy for calling attention to his incompetence at Exploding Snap.
He glances back just to check that Ron and Hermione aren’t watching him incredulously, but he needn’t worry- they are absorbed in each other. From the way that Hermione moves her hands passionately across the papers and Ron stares at her with a dopey smile sitting on his lips, Harry knows that Hermione is trying to tell Ron about whatever it is she is working on. He also knows that Ron isn’t listening in the slightest.
He straightens out the toy, ignoring the fact that it really is quite sweet, and that he would not mind one himself. Malfoy has a plush
“Malfoy, why don’t you talk to me?” he says and immediately wants to cry and cower in a corner somewhere at how pathetic he sounds. Harry opens his mouth, just about to lead on from this absolute humiliation with an over-explanation about how he doesn’t even
hi thanks so much for reading please leave comments and kudos because this takes a long time to write and it gives me more motivation when i know people are enjoying it :) xxx would mean a lot
. He refuses to remember the instances in which a flash of broad pecs, or an angular jawline, would creep into his fantasies as well.
“You do that and I’ll tell everyone just how much you’ve been stalking me,” threatens Malfoy, a glint in his eye. Cruel. Addictive.
“Don’t be ridiculous” Hermione scolds, although her lips wobble amusedly, “However, I won’t lie. I’m not particularly thrilled to be with Pansy. The look she gave me when we found out who we were being roomed with was almost feral. Still, we’ll see.”
. When did it all get so backwards? Shouldn’t it be the other way around? He doesn’t know anymore, but he thinks that maybe Malfoy is supposed to be working a little harder for forgiveness.
Suddenly wary that Malfoy could run off, and they would never speak again, Harry says all in a rush, “Don’t move dorms. I won’t bother you anymore.”
It is a testament to the intensity of his dreamlike state that he has been thinking as long as Malfoy has been in there. The twat’s routine is longer than anybody he knows, even Luna, who likes to spend a solid half an hour twisting her hair into complicated styles, as he has heard. He wonders how that compares to Ginny’s quick and clean morning showers, followed only by a brief scrape of the ponytail and scour of the designated clothing chair. Their dynamic must be interesting. She has never been one to fuss about, and maybe she and Harry are too similar in that way. It has occurred to him before that maybe he needs someone to make him care about the acute fine things in life. Growing up with nothing in the Dursley’s household, and then battling just for pure survival, Harry has never had the time, nor cared to. It just didn’t seem important.
, his brain pipes up unhelpfully. Ginny had once told him that his thick and straight eyebrows just made him look perpetually angry.
“Not really, Professor. I’m sorry,” he mumbles, ashamed. Everyone else in his year seems to have a plan A, B, C and D- all the way up until Z. He awaits her scorn.
“It’s OK, Harry,” Hermione says tenderly, “I wouldn’t blame you if you had decided to run away. Frankly, I’m surprised you didn’t,” her eyes widen and she adds “and I’m happy that you haven’t!”, as if she fears he is about to bolt out of the carriage at any given second. The idea is tempting.
The next morning, Harry wakes up and something feels different. It takes him a while to figure out what it is, this odd fluttering sensation in the pit of his belly, but he realises that it could be some semblance of happiness. He had had an enjoyable evening yesterday, even after all the events of the day. He has also had his first nightmare-free sleep in a long time, and one he begs the Gods above is not his last.
Hermione squeezes his hand back tightly, meaningfully, and he immediately realises that she must have sent a warning to Tom ahead of their entrance. His suspicions are confirmed when he sees Doris Crockford almost bursting out of her seat in the corner of the room. Next to her, her friend elbows her side sharply. He turns away uncomfortably, trying to get Hermione to follow him out of the stuffy and tight confinement of the pub. Thankfully, she seems to understand his message and they hasten out, through the brick wall, into Diagon Alley.
Once his heart stops pounding, he turns towards the actual source of the noise: Justin, with a furious scowl on his face and his phone up to his ear. He has never seen his roommate look anything less than happy, unless you count the pitiful stares he is prone to shooting Harry. It is an odd expression on him. Usually, he would admit that Justin is a handsome guy but his features have distorted so much that it changes his appearance entirely. In a way, he is the anti-Malfoy. It shocked Harry to see the git
“Yeah great thanks, you?” Harry lies and produces a weak smile. Justin appears a little frightened, so he thinks it most likely did not have the desired effect of reassurance.
Malfoy’s tall figure heads into the bathroom and Harry hears the shower turn on. The idea that Malfoy is in such close proximity to him,
At ten AM, Harry is alone in the dorm and he trudges out of bed. He is walking to the toilet when he identifies a strange object at the foot of Malfoy’s bed. Suspicious- this habit never truly goes away- he goes to examine it.
“I’m sorry, I hate to disappoint, but I’m really not.” Harry scoffs in disbelief at her invasive and, frankly, weird comment. Butterflies flutter in his stomach, for a reason unknown to him. “And I’m Harry.”
The floating lanterns are dimly lit, but cosy. Harry thinks he saw some once with great likeness at a market in London; the stall owner said they were Turkish. Studying the intricate patterns in the sea of red, orange and blue light, he decides they are simply beautiful. Wafting through the air is the gentle aromas of the kitchen, which is just down the corridor. Rosemary, thyme and warm herbs signal the cooking of a roast dinner. On the ceiling, vines have been bound around the beams and have now grown across the whole room. Leaves and crimson flowers are newly sprouting everywhere, peppering the ceiling with shrubs. Next to the dark wood, Harry feels like he is sitting under a tree. He hasn’t been back here before, always opting for the front of the pub in the past. It is very removed, their own secret den. As he gets comfortable, he notices that the booths have cushions. Huge, squishy things, patterned with swirls. They have tassels on each corner, and Harry idly fondles one in between his fingers. He relaxes.
Of course, Malfoy could still be hatching an evil plan for all Harry truly knows. In a moment of sudden realisation, Harry contemplates why he thinks he could ever foresee Malfoy’s actions again when all the dickhead has done is surprise him ever since they got back to Hogwarts.
Harry expects him to demand why he is here, the reason for his bizarre company in the dark shades of night, why he felt the need to sneak in like some lewd fifth year visiting his girlfriend. If it were him in Malfoy’s position, he would doubtlessly be perturbed by his inexplicable behaviour. But Malfoy says nothing. Just blinks, breathes, shuffles.
“Yeah, yeah, stop moaning. I’m doing it” says Justin as he slams open his drawer. He reaches in and pulls out something rectangular.
That isn’t to say that Harry likes it. In fact, he would go as far as saying that he actively dislikes the jarring half-peace that has plonked itself in the hard-edged space of their fading rivalry. It is nonsensical; he is certain that even the most genius of people would be rightfully baffled by his reaction. But, funnily enough, it doesn’t shock him anymore, this adversity to letting go of a relationship to Malfoy, no matter how fraught with resentment it was. It isn’t that he enjoys the fighting and the animosity. No, that weighs him down, makes him feel like he is going backwards. Back to the war, back to being so wildly angry, back to fear, and running, and real, terrifying danger. But it still assuredly feels more natural, more normal than this odd, unsettling truce. The change is truly the most frightening thing.
As if one day without answers wasn’t enough, it rolls onto the next, and then the next. Another. Another. Hermione and Ron get distracted by a new trip that they are planning to take in the holidays, and soon they forget to check up on Harry so often. He reflects once more on how pathetic he is when left to his own devices. They are thinking of going to visit Charlie in Romania, and then touring the country a bit. Ron is practically bursting with excitement, and as much as Harry would like to believe it has something to do with seeing his absent brother, he cringes and resigns himself to the fact that it is probably more about the empty tent and enlarged double bed. Better than a broom cupboard, for sure.
“Go back to your friends, Potter. Seriously, have you ever considered it’s time to think about doing something else with your life other than obsess over me?” snipes Malfoy. This time he expects it when Malfoy rolls his eyes back deep into his skull. The fact that he predicted the other boy's next action leaves him internally grinning, even amongst the shock waves rolling over him.
A few moments after Harry speaks, Malfoy appears to shake himself of whatever thought was on his mind. Harry dreads to know, yet craves it simultaneously. Still facing the window, he frowns, “OK.”
She continues, “I know what happened, not that I was purposefully listening, of course, but they were being dreadfully loud. I heard Padma talking to Hannah in the library and she said that she overheard Malfoy refusing to speak. Apparently he is feigning ignorance about the whole affair.”
Harry picks it up cautiously, checking subtly for any dodgy markings. However, he is clearly not as conspicuous as he thought because Jenna snorts humorously. “Don’t worry, this one is clean. If you want, I can show you some other round th-”
Of one- Harry, creeping again. He shakes his head at himself internally, cringing, whilst still observing the boy in front of him, and above all, the letter. Realistically, he knows that Malfoy is not plotting some great downfall of Hogwarts. Harry may not understand the way his brain works- warped by that unnatural blonde hair of his most likely. He has long suspected that upon Malfoy’s birth, Lucius was horrified to find out that he was brunette, and has been bleaching Malfoy Junior’s hair ever since in shame. However, something in him does recognise a sameness in the twat. Some sort of sense of confusion, and perhaps guilt. Harry can empathise. For all the people who died on his watch. The fierceness of that burden crushes him at every given moment, like the air has turned to heavy lead.
He scoffs angrily, just once, and then goes silent. Harry, suddenly terrified that he might burst into tears, searches for something to comfort him with, “It’s pretty, but you could do better.”
Justin startles and then laughs, face scrunched in amusement. He must see Harry’s face fall because he rushes to justify himself, still chuckling. “Oh no, Harry, don't worry, I’m not laughing at you. It’s just because I noticed you looking really confused a couple of minutes ago and I’ve just been waiting. Sorry if that makes me cruel,” and the twinkle of humour in his eyes settles Harry’s anxiety.
Shivering, he looks to the shop window on his right hand side. He examines the items on display and comes to understand that it is a bookstore. Archaic covers are woven with golden leaf imprints, and Harry notices that, bizarrely, one appears to be singing a melodic tune. The dark wooden sign states, with a carving now smooth from the Scottish weather which beats against it, that the place is named
Harry vaguely recognises that perhaps Malfoy’s blissful face isn’t as a grotesque sight as Vernon’s pink and infuriated one, but still, both are tormenting. The memory of the incident just plays again and again and again; Harry wishes that he could drown it out like he used to do with the headphones and the ancient Walkman that he had found locked away in a ginormous box of Dudley’s unused stuff. Maybe he should ask if Dudley could send them over. At this point, he would definitely anything to stop the unwanted interest that he feels growing at the image of Malfoy in that fucking silver-lit room. He really doesn’t need a repeat of sixth year, no thank you- Hermione and Ron wouldn’t ever let it go.
Instead of fleeing, his apparent deathwish prevails and he awaits Malfoy’s response eagerly, hoping he might reveal what he has been working on in his distress. And if there was just something about the life in the boy’s eyes during their episode in the dormitory last week that sent a little thrill to running up Harry’s spine, then sue him for wanting it back.
Before he can contemplate making a dash for it, the engine begins to pump and the train starts to move out of the station. Although the strength of Hermione’s charms had made him feel alone for a moment, bar his two best friends, he still feels lighter at the thought. Ron and Hermione start chatting about their predictions for dinner in the Great Hall that evening, and whether Mcgonagall will bother them all with a speech or not.
“Harry, let me get this perfectly clear. What you are saying is that you saw nothing that could indicate why Mr. Malfoy is in this condition?” presses Mcgonagall. As always, she gets down to the gritty business, all the while replacing Harry’s own shoddy charmwork. He appreciates that there is no mention of his own condition.
Although, considering the brief glimpses of anger that Harry has been a witness to, maybe he hasn’t completely transformed. The livid look on his face earlier today was more akin to the boy he once knew. The curiosity kills him, but he must resist. It’s pointless to him now, when there are so many other things that need to be addressed. He cannot let Malfoy be at the front of his mind, as he had in sixth year- he
He scarcely manages to fold up the robes that he had purchased from Madame Malkin’s, and say goodnight to Cindy, before collapsing in the vast expanse of his bed. Finding that he’s utterly exhausted, he drops into a slumber almost as soon as his head hits the pillow. Dreams of white daisy petals, a love that doesn’t exist, and the impending
Curiously, he then grimaces, almost as if he said something he didn’t mean to. This keeps happening; he wonders, for the millionth time, why Malfoy is so reluctant to speak these days.
An expression of sympathy spreads across her features and Hermione’s full lips downturn at the corners. “Not at all. I was under the impression that Kings Cross even had orders from the Ministry to heighten their security today. It appears someone isn’t doing their job right.” she frowns. Harry feels hotly embarrassed at the level of fuss that surrounds them at every instance in which they are outside.
“What?” Harry interrupts, alive, “Hurt me? Punch me? No you won’t. You don’t do anything anymore, apart from mope around.”
Harry is mildly horrified at such a depressing statement, but he also wants to laugh. It is typical of people head over heels in love to focus on the small weed in a field of flowers. For Justin to get so wound up about such pedantic things, like the number of bands, means that he misses the bigger picture: he has been given a fucking wedding ring. Even if it weren’t intended for marriage, it should tell Justin all he needs to know about luck and love.
“Sorry that I left you guys,” Harry leans back against the seat and wraps his arms around his knees, the instinct to protect himself still existent, “I had to get out of there before Amelia Brundlewood ended up stealing one of my socks, or something.”
The evening finds him in the library. Despite his intentions the day before, he is yet to even open the book he bought in Hogsmeade. After last night, after Malfoy, he has been left feeling a little wary. When his hard edges are wiped away, it is difficult to see Malfoy as the villain that Harry’s instinct tells him he is. There is a disconnect between the snarky, silent boy who has been sneaking around with suspicion written all over him, and the one last night, who confessed to Harry his love of Jasmine tea in whispered tones. Needless to say, it is much easier on his soul to envision the former, and this is what shakes him of his guilty conscience.
Later, Harry’s brain is in pieces, blown into dozens of shards several times over. After Malfoy’s cryptic and puzzling comments, his mind is reeling with confusion and, most concerningly, worry. Despite the boy's half false assurances that it wasn’t a suicidal incident, there is something amiss. Harry is uneasy.
He is jerked back into reality as Malfoy leaves the room. As quiet as he is, he is easily identifiable from the clacking of his boots, probably Dragonhide, and probably preposterously expensive, the twat. Goldstein must follow, because somebody else’s footsteps echo after him.
Realising how bizarre the situation is, he sighs. Two rivals in the night attempting to find solace in antagonising each other, yet a pathetic bit of vomit brings them it instead. It is that, but still so much more- and so much less.
He’s so different now, Harry notes. Before the war and throughout their school years, he had walked with such confidence. Even in sixth year, a lot of the time he had swaggered about, obviously feeling a sense of self-importance, however terrified he also was. But the current Malfoy, the one who is clearly feeling the impact of the war, much to Harry’s indignation-
“Just wondering if you’re going to insist on following me up here every night, or if I can expect a peaceful evening tomorrow,” remarks Malfoy dryly.
Nothing happens, except from a thudding noise which ceases to exist, and Harry realises that Malfoy has stopped shaking his legs. He almost wants to stomp on Malfoy’s foot to get it to do
“Pretty much.” If it is even possible, Ron’s grin widens and he begins to point at a dozen spots on his own face. “It’s here,” he says, jabbing himself particularly harshly in the tip of his nose, just where it begins to curve up. It goes slightly red where he pokes it. “Here, too” he says, prodding his large forehead right in the centre. “Oh, yeah, and here,” and then he proceeds to gesture to the whole of himself with a hearty cackle.
Once the water has worked its magic the best it can, leaving behind only the familiar residual aching that he knows so well, Harry regretfully turns it off and grabs his clothes from the floor. Proving just how blissfully oblivious a good shower can render him, they are damp from where he hasn’t been careful and has splashed them. They are still covered in glitter and the laundry won’t be collected by the house elves for at least a couple of days, so he casts a quick cleaning charm. It isn’t quite the same, and as he puts them on, he curses the stiff and itchy feeling of the fabric that comes from washing with magic.
Feeling oddly nostalgic for nothing specific, he considers again the word memory. He reckons that Hogwarts has a lot of that. But what could it mean for Malfoy’s potion? Perhaps that he must recall an emotional moment in his past, as one must do to produce a Patronus?
He sticks his tongue out experimentally at the stranger opposite him and feels peculiar as it copies his movement. Surely this shell of a man can’t be the once brave and noble Harry Potter? He snorts at the preposterous title he had been donned by the Daily Prophet, and slams the door hard on his way out.
The door swings open and Malfoy saunters out, thankfully clothed. Harry releases a breath, which he hadn’t even realised he was holding in, at the sight of him fully dressed.
“Oi, shut that up will you, Justin?” complains Anthony from his bed. Harry had thought him asleep, but his wakefulness is apparent- though clearly fresh, judging from his still puffy eyes. The boy has massively come out of his shell in the past few days. Harry is glad, it has even encouraged him to do the same in many ways, but Anthony’s newfound ease with them also brought the knowledge that he can be honest-to-god unbearably grumpy.
Justin doesn’t seem to understand how to act in relation to the war, and for that, Harry can’t blame him.
It’s only after a few minutes that he realises she’s watching him through her round sunglasses, slipping gradually off of her nose.
“Fine,” he sighs, unreluctant to let this path of conversation carry on any further. He lets it die, feeling it float away, though it will probably drift back later. “Anyway if you’re not going to tell Mcgonagall what really happened, you might want to at least assure her this wasn’t some kind of suicidal mission. I think she might start taping up the windows soon, just to make sure you don’t jump out.”
“No, Potter. Not quite,” he says. He nibbles his lip again, leaving an indent where it has been continuously repeated. Harry never noticed that was a habit until now. If Malfoy bites even one more time, he could make it bleed.
“OK, OK, damn, give a man a second,” Justin responds, “Basically, my parents have disowned me because they found out that I’m, uh, gay.”
It could be the moonlight, or it could be sweat, but his skin has started to shine. He isn’t focusing on Harry anymore, isn’t focusing on anything. There is a veil between them. And he isn’t looking at Harry, but Harry is him. He notices the seconds passing in Malfoy’s expressions. Sees every fleeting emotion, which is only given away by the downturn of his brow.
It hovers, perhaps judging how well it thinks he is going to fare with carrying on. He is inclined to think that that would be,
Harry himself also thinks of Snape and his Legilimency lessons in fifth year. He relives how vigorously he had been worked, how cruelly he had been treated for a boy only
“‘Gotcha!” says Ron with glee, taking his King after only about five minutes of playing. He could be cheating, could have even made the rules up, for all Harry knows. But for now he is content to admit failure. He can recognise a lost cause when he sees one- it has indeed become a talent of his.
With no goal in mind, he ambles along the busy road. Ignoring the bodies that crowd him is difficult, but as it’s noon on a weekday, it could be worse. On a street corner somewhere, a busker plays the saxophone and he wishes he had some Muggle money to drop in the top hat.
She seems to take in his dried tear tracks and general dishevelled state, and thankfully accepts his unlikely tale with a nod. Harry scrubs hotly at his cheeks, embarrassed, as soon as she turns her eyes to Malfoy.
At the mention of Malfoy’s name, Harry’s ears prick up. As anticipated, he hasn’t seen him since their last incident. He has had more run-ins with bloody Peeves, for Merlin’s sake. The ponce is more of a phantom than any of the Hogwarts resident ghosts. By now, Harry assumes that he has formally moved dorm rooms, but Malfoy hasn’t been back to collect any of his belongings, which throws Harry off. The glasses case is still there.
Harry moans loudly, feeling like all his despair and grief at the very fact that this day has the audacity to exist is coming up from the pit he forced down this morning. It must be revenge for pushing it away. “It didn’t?”
