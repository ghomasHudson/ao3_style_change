“Great job!” Molly said with a smile.
One final step, and then Potter took Draco in his arms, embracing him, and Draco’s entire world shattered. With his head on Potter’s shoulder, Draco let himself fall apart, wetting Potter’s shirt with his tears as he clung to Potter for dear life. Draco shook as months’, if not years’ worth of fear, angst, and desperation broke through the carefully constructed barriers he always worked so hard to keep up. He was a fucking mess, but Potter didn’t shy away. Instead, he held him, rubbing soothing circles over Draco’s back, stroking his hair, mumbling nonsense, and patiently calming him down.
Saturday 21 August 1999
“Certainly, ma’am.”
I wish I could say that I believed I would have become the same person no matter who my parents were (or rather, as in my case, which parental figures I grew up with), but I must admit you might be on to something here, Mr Philosopher. In fact, there’s nothing saying I wouldn’t have been just as coddled and spoiled as you, had I had the pleasure of growing up with my loving parents instead of with my bigoted, narrow-minded aunt and uncle.
, you idiot.”
. He won’t hold it against you.”
Draco stepped closer and leaned forwards, only stilling his movement once their shallow breaths mingled between them. Draco could feel the heat from Harry’s exhale brushing against his lips as he whispered, “Yes.”
Harry had thought Draco would choose to fuck him like this, taking him from behind. It would surely have been most convenient, considering how close his prick already was to where it was supposed to go. But Draco told him to turn over, and so he did, lifting his hips to allow for Draco to place a pillow under his arse. Draco kneeled between his thighs, his dark eyes roaming over Harry’s body as he lined himself up.
“No, I didn’t.”
. How could he have forgotten? He’d sat here, joking with two-thirds of the Golden Trio, and he’d fucking forgot. How did one forget Harry Potter? How could he ever have forgotten the boy he’d been circling around for years during his childhood, the man he’d been head-over-heels in love with for half of their eighth year at Hogwarts? Not that he had ever let his stupid crush be known by anyone, of course — not even Pansy.
He’s almost afraid to raise his head to meet Draco’s eyes, uncertain of what he’ll find in those silver-grey depths. Then he reminds himself he’s a Gryffindor. He can do this. How bad can it be?
“Nope. Too late.” Sirius backed away, spreading his arms as he exited the room. “See you tomorrow, little cousin!”
“One of the most critical factors for successful dating is the choice of where and how you’ll be spending your date. You’ll want to have a good time, or more specifically, you’ll want
. He tells Malfoy as much.
“Well…” Draco raised an eyebrow. “You know, your godson has this cousin…”
I have no idea when we came to this, how we suddenly became each other’s confidants. I only know that we are, that you, for some inexplicable reason, trust me with stuff you never tell anyone else, that I tell you more than I probably should, that you now know me better than any of my other friends does. Apart from the one big secret hidden deep in my heart, protected by carefully constructed walls, you know all there is to know about me. All the shit, all the flaws, all the mess; it’s a wonder you still endure my company.
To his credit, Theo tried to mollify her, telling her I probably have everything under control (Haven’t you, Harry?), but when she continued to glare exasperatedly at me, he turned to me and said, ‘Maybe you should just tell them, mate?’ So, I did.
Harry nods. “In my dreams at first, and then later when I bumped into you in the corridors. Nothing like this, though. Nothing like tonight.”
“I—” It takes all Harry’s willpower not to avert his gaze. “Thanks.”
This was Sirius Black, Draco’s only living family, but not one he’d ever met.
"Dinner?" Harry turned to face him, finally taking in the cottage behind them. It was quaint and rather charming, the warm glow spilling out from the windows welcoming its guests to step inside, only… Harry's eyes widened and he smiled. Next to them on the cobblestone veranda, a table was laid out under the evening sky, candles lit and wine poured, waiting just for them.
“O-Ollivanders.”
Harry hisses back to Orion as he slithers into the room. "
“Really?”
“I hear you, mate.”
Orion hisses.
“I might as well love you.”
Draco drew the last remnants of composure from his core and steeled himself as he turned to face the man he loved but could never have. When he spoke, his voice was but a whisper, and he doubted the man could even hear him in the commotion surrounding them.
“Honestly?” he mumbled to himself, itching to take out his wand and clean. But, first, the cat. “Ps-ps-ps-ps,” he called out, making the same noises that usually got Smaug’s attention. “Here kitty-kitty, where are you? Tch-tch-tch.” He wandered into the kitchenette and found two small bowls sitting on the floor, empty.
“So,” Harry says as the waitress retreats with their empty dishes, “what’s the verdict?”
“Mushu?” Harry repeated, scrunching his brow. “Like, the little dragon from Mulan?”
Draco smiled and slipped a furtive hand into his pocket. The band of metal was cool to the touch as he wrapped his fingers around it and settled in for a nerve-wracking wait.
“You’re a saint.”
He felt so…included, he supposed was the word for it. For the first time in a long time, he felt like he was part of a family.
12 Grimmauld Place, London
She smiled. “Let’s put on an old movie and order pizza. It’ll make you feel better.”
The Floo call came very early in the morning on New Year’s Day. There were no details, just that there was a change in Charlie’s status, and that Draco needed to come in.
"I do."
Should I be concerned about the fact that you just used my first name for the first time in possibly forever? Who are you, and what have you done to my Draco? (See? It feels weird, doesn’t it? So weird.)
Thanks to Potter’s need to chat up the Dragon-Weasel, there was only one sledge left waiting for them once they finally reached the top of the hill. Draco offered to cast a Doubling Charm on it, but Potter called him silly and insisted they’d share it. So here he was, arms wrapped around Potter’s torso, nose buried in Potter’s soft knitted scarf, groin alarmingly close to Potter’s arse. It was like the Room of Requirement all over again and Draco’s heart beat wildly in his chest as they rushed down the slope.
"He wants out," Draco said, watching the exchange between Harry and Orion with amusement.
Harry scans the room, checking off his mental to-do list.
Draco managed to stay not-at-all-intrigued for several hours, distracting himself with inventory and a very-much-needed deep clean of the espresso machine after closing time. (Well, the “very-much-needed” part may have referred more to Draco’s need to delay the inevitable than anything else — he’d gone through the bi-weekly cleaning routine just this past Sunday, after all — but, yeah. Very much needed.) He made it all the way to nine pm before he eventually caved.
Draco huffed a laugh over Harry’s hypersensitive skin. “You want me to defile you, Potter?”
Draco still remembered those fateful weeks all too well, and the mere thought of them now made his stomach churn. He laid down his spoon next to his half-finished dessert and pushed the plate aside. The entire meal had been divine, but he couldn’t possibly eat another bite. Especially not anything as sickly sweet as Harry’s favoured treacle tart.
“How do you know?” When Harry doesn’t answer, Draco nudges his shoulder again. “Have you ever talked to them about it?”
— ☕ —
Draco was unable to register the words.
A quiet bark from a nearby bush pulled his attention away from his dark thoughts. Behind a park bench off the right side of the path sat a large, black dog. It looked clean and well-fed, but there was no collar around its neck and no sign of an owner nearby.
“Which one of these shirts do you think—”
“You know I’m here for you whatever happens, right?” I say, because I am, and I always will be.
As soon as Harry’s lips were on him, Draco’s every intention was turned to ash, incinerated by the blazing heat of their mutual desire. Soon, Harry was devouring him, his tongue hot and wet as it surged inside, greedily exploring every corner of Draco’s mouth. And Draco let him, eagerly giving as good as he got, one hand tangled in Harry’s messy — but oh so silky soft — hair, the other venturing down the ridge of Harry’s spine on a quest for that perfectly rounded arse he’d been lusting after for so long.
“But of course, cutie cub. Anything for you.” Harry didn’t know why — maybe it was the sight of Draco’s tentative smile as he took a moment to glance Harry’s way before lifting up the next child on his lap — but as he drew back from their hug to catch his godson’s eye, he asked, “But why did you both turn and wave? Did you two talk about me?”
PS Consider the door open.
Draco shakes his head but lowers them down into the trees on the edge of the forest. They're still on the school grounds, but far from view from the castle, so Harry doesn't hesitate to reach up and nuzzle the side of Draco's neck.
“No, not a Healer.”
"Well, more of a light evening tea. Molly's food is a bit heavy. This is just something small to keep us going for the night." Draco flicked his wand and some gentle violin began to play through the cottage's open window.
Draco threw on his clothes and hurried through his ablutions. If something had happened to Charlie, the family would be devastated.
in this heap of parchment? Honestly, Ernie, I’m only here twice a week. I can’t be expected to reorganise your office every time.”
A hiss from Orion catches Harry’s attention, prompting him to place his hand on the desk and allow for the snake to slither down his arm onto the polished wood surface. He shrugs off his father’s cloak, his eyes never leaving the mesmerising sight on the other side of the door as he drops the magical fabric in a heap next to Orion, letting him curl into it for warmth. Heart pounding, Harry moves towards the door, pushing it open, breathless.
Draco's eyes glaze over and his broad wings seem to quiver. "Okay, Harry. Okay."
. Why now? After all these years of nothing — why now?
It didn’t last for nearly long enough. The protracted build-up, after months (if not years) of mutual pining, made it impossible for either one of them to delay the inevitable. Draco had barely wrapped his hand around Harry’s cock before Harry came with a shout, spurting all over his chest and probably over Draco’s as well. Draco wasn’t far behind, pulled over the edge just a few strokes later by the sight of Harry coming and the pulsating feel of Harry’s arse clenching around his cock.
His lungs burned, screaming for air, but he no longer knew how to breathe.
Draco looked around the room, trying to find a way out of this where they wouldn’t all hex him once he eventually managed to spit out the truth. The sooner it happened, the better.
“So, where to?” Harry asked as the chilly night greeted them outdoors. As usual, it was raining, but the ground seemed cold enough to freeze the gathering puddles, covering the grass in a thin layer of ice that crunched under Draco’s boots.
She sighed. “It’s Potter, love. He’s always made you a mess.”
Draco’s knowledge-thirsty brain took over the reins of his mouth. “I thought you could only travel so far with a time-turner?”
Harry frowned. “You didn’t…? Um… At least you
“I can’t?” Draco’s forehead moves under Harry’s, furrowing as Draco’s eyebrows rise towards his hairline.
Grasping at straws, he managed a cocky grin. “Well, wouldn’t you like to know?”
Draco goes silent and for a brief moment, Harry wonders what’s distracting the man from continuing. Then realisation hits him like a rogue bludger; he’s not meeting Draco’s gaze anymore, he’s staring at Draco’s perfect mouth.
“…Want to feel you… i-inside me.”
Draco nods and takes a deep breath. "Just another moment and I think I'll have it under control. If I move too quickly, I'll come on the spot and it'll all be over."
“I bet he’s in here.”
be perfect. There are only two days to go, and something always goes wrong at the last minute. I simply won’t let that happen this time.”
I stop in the doorway, eyes immediately drawn to the swell of your arse, covered only by the tight black fabric of your low-rise boxer briefs. Below, your impossibly long legs, covered in a light dusting of golden hairs. Above, the elegant curve of your spine, your broad shoulders, and small droplets of water trickling down from the nape of your neck towards the waistline of your pants. I swallow hard, ignoring the heat pooling in my crotch.
“Yeah. Let’s go have some ice cream.”
“There’s no need. I’ll be fine.”
“Sorry.”
“I’d think he’d be here tonight,” Draco said quietly, hoping she wouldn’t detect the nervousness in his voice. Merlin, how would Potter react to Draco’s sudden presence in the family?
Caramel. Feathers.
me? For real? We’re going to be friends?”
“So…” Draco hesitates, distracted, his gaze straying to Harry’s damp chest before shooting up to meet Harry’s eyes again. “What do you plan on wearing?”
But to clear up your confusion, you should be grateful, of course. Or would you’ve preferred not getting any letter at all from me that week? I don’t know, seeing as you still seemed so offended by it a whole week later, maybe you would. Maybe you would’ve preferred it if I’d never replied to you at all, way back in January? Now that you know what it’s like to be quill pals with me, I bet you regret ever writing that initial letter to me in the first place, don’t you?. Well, tough luck, Malfoy. You’re stuck with me now. Me, and all my linguistic flaws.
“Er, sure…”
Received: Whatever. Left, right, potato, tomato.
“Sorry.” He expertly guided her back to the door and walked with her into the hallway. “But thank you so much for the invitation. I’m very flattered you thought of me.”
“Slyvia, I seriously have to—” He paused, embarrassed. “Oh, Harry. I thought you were someone else.”
“Is that what you do with your son too? Try to cheer him up by not letting him know he means something to you? Because it’s not working.”
Malfoy had suggested Harry ‘do his thing’ for the first hour of their so-called date, claiming he wanted to ‘observe and evaluate his raw material’ before deciding on a plan of action.
“Mum, stop, I’m fine,” Charlie’s voice came from the bed where Molly had a handkerchief out and was trying to wipe away some imaginary spot from his face. Charlie squirmed like a small child, but his grin belied his enjoyment at the coddling. “So, everyone’s here, huh?”
Draco chuckles again. It’s a glorious sound and Harry loves the sensation of it as it rumbles through his body. “I was just about to suggest you could join me, but if you think I’m an evil—”
Now, keep your fingers crossed I’ll be able to sneak this letter out to the owlery in time without anyone noticing.
That is, if you’re able to stop trash-talking my friends. You may have been brought up to hate ‘blood traitors’ and ‘mudbloods’, but they’re my friends and if that’s how this is going to be, then you don’t have to bother writing me any more letters. If you still feel a need to insult someone, I’m sure yours truly will suffice as the sole target for your stupid bullshit for years to come. Okay?
“Well, someone needs to make sure we don’t get splinched on the way home.”
Evenings like these, with all their fineries, everyone enjoying themselves dancing, eating, drinking, laughing…these evenings always left Draco with a hollow feeling in his chest. Maybe because they reminded him of his childhood, of his parents — sparkling, laughing, joyful…and together. His mother would look up at his father and positively glow, and Draco would watch, sure that everyone in the room wished they were as happy as the Malfoys.
“But—”
Draco gulped. “Yes,” he promised, making sure to meet Harry’s impossibly green eyes this time.
The uncharacteristic praise makes Harry’s throat ache, delight bubbling under the surface but kept at bay by an instant rush of guilt. Because he’s not
You lay curled up on your bed, fully clothed, with your back against the door. You even have your shoes on, for Merlin’s sake, and if that’s not a tell-tale sign something’s terribly wrong, I don’t know what is. My socked feet make no sound as I walk the few steps needed to reach your bed. I hesitate for just a moment before I sit down beside you, lifting my hand to place on your arm when I notice the slight tremble of your shoulder.
Draco shifted uncomfortably, but Hermione didn’t seem to notice as she just continued.
Harry’s arm shot out, grabbing onto Draco’s bicep as Harry’s feet slid on the ice. Unprepared, Draco fell to his knees, dragged down onto the cold ground. The laughter they’d been enjoying increased and Draco tried to stand, only to slip and fall, landing with a huff entirely on top of Harry.
“Okay…?” Draco frowned, hesitated, and then reached for the box. Their fingers brushed, and Harry finally raised his gaze to meet Draco’s eyes through thick, inky black lashes. There was something so confusing stirring in those green depths; Draco found it impossible to look away. Under their eye-lock, Draco’s hands fumbled as he slowly lifted the lid from the box and waited, unsure as to what he was waiting for.
“Yes, well, I
“Then I guess you’re stuck with me now.”
Harry pauses, and Orion hisses in curiosity.
“Of course,” he managed, feeling like a fool for ever thinking Harry would be interested in anything beyond a casual acquaintance and the occasional evening of exam revisions. “I’d be happy to help. Whatever you need, I—”
Sent: It's not even a word!
And he would. Harry’s potions cabinet hadn’t been this well-stocked in the entire history of the universe. Draco had seen to that, bringing him new batches of balms and tinctures, infusions and salves, elixirs and draughts every day for nearly a week now. It was Draco's job, after all, supplying the Healing staff with his brews, but Harry was starting to wonder if the man was on his way to a nervous breakdown or something. “Don’t worry, Draco. I’m good.”
Harry snorted and sat up, an amused smile playing on his lips. “You’re incorrigible.”
And so he does.
His fingers were stiff, chilled to the bone from the unforgiving climate of the season. Although the temperature rarely crept below zero out here, the proximity to the ocean brought a rawness to the air that no known warming charm was ever able to stave off for long. No, the Hebridean winter was certainly not a pleasant experience by any means, but the dragons favoured the humidity — or at least their scales did — and that was really all that mattered.
Draco says, his voice serious. "Merlin, Harry, you are so responsive; I swear I could come from nothing but the noises you make. And your face? You're so bloody beautiful. So perfect."
tell them. I can’t lie about something like this.”
The sound of the gulls and the lapping of waves in the distance, not to mention the smell of the sea, gave Harry a pretty damned good idea of where they were. Well, not like, where on a map, but definitely somewhere near the sea.
“Sorry,” she said quietly and leaned forward, giving him a little hug. “I shouldn’t have said that. If there’s anything you need me to do, let me know.”
The Library, Hogwarts
“How long?” Draco voice cuts through Harry’s racing thoughts, low and deliciously husky.
“Charlie?” A voice came from the doorway interrupting them.
To that end, he’d got in contact with Madam Rosmerta and, after apologising profusely for what he put her through during that awful Sixth Year, persuaded her to create and produce a new Butterbeer essence to complement the usual Muggle syrups on offer. (A wise move, as it turned out, considering how many Butterbeer lattes Draco and his staff already had on their tally this opening day.) He also reached out to Florean Fortescue’s daughter Florence (who, George had told him, had taken over her father’s ice cream parlour after the war), initiating a collaboration that resulted in Draco’s shop now being able to offer a weekly special pick of ice cream to flavour his chilled coffee drinks. The greatest conundrum to date, however, had proven to be finding a Muggle supplier able to provide the seasonal pumpkin spice syrup on a year-round basis; something Draco hoped he’d now been able to accomplish, although he really couldn’t say anything for certain until this year’s Hallowe’en was over and the deliveries would keep on coming. Or not.
Merlin, it made him miss his mother.
“This will be… an everlasting love…” Natalie Cole’s joyful voice suddenly rang through the room. Draco wiped the dough off his hands and covered the bowl with a towel to keep Smaug from sticking his paw into the mix. The little fox watched from his perch on the back of the sofa, feigning disinterest. Draco was not fooled.
“It arrived this morning. Take it out. I want to see it.”
I frown at the contents of our pantry, still unsure what to make for dinner even after minutes of vacant staring. It’s impossible to come to a decision when all I can think about is the fact that you won’t be here to join me. “Yeah?”
"Ugh, you need to shave," Draco mutters. "If you'd just use the Shaving Charm I taught you, it'd stay smooth all day."
Harry blinked at Draco’s words, promptly ignoring the amusement in his voice, as well as the heat creeping up his own cheeks.
Draco ended the call and glanced over at Smaug who was now inspecting the towel-covered bowl. “Looks like I’m taking a trip out to the Reserve tonight.”
“Merry Christmas, love,” he whispered into the nape of Harry’s neck.
“Temporary, short-term amnesia is not uncommon in cases of extreme magical trauma like the one Charlie’s endured,” the Healer recited. “His magic will likely heal him up in a few more days, but if that’s not the case for whatever reason, there are potions we can administer at that time to help him finish the process. The best thing you can do is to spend time with him and keep him comfortable.”
“Thirty per cent of students that enter Hogwarts each year are using substandard wands or had monetary difficulties obtaining one.”
“Have fun,” Draco muttered from his desk.
. Heat rushes to Harry’s cheeks. Biting down on his lower lip, he braves his embarrassment and looks up to meet Draco’s eyes.
older than Draco — grinned. “In fact, you’re just shy of two months older than me.”
Ernie grinned and shrugged, his hunched shoulders and rounded face making him look like the guileless Hufflepuff he was. “Sorry, mate, but there’s a lot to do just keeping this place running. By the time I get back here most days, I don’t have enough energy to do more than just throw everything down and hope for the best.” Something seemed to catch the man’s eye, and he leant forwards across the desk to withdraw a wrinkled piece of parchment from the dustbin next to it. “Is this it?”
Draco pulled his knees closer, hugging them tight to his chest. “My parents will survive. I bet they won’t miss me at all.”
Draco shook his head and stepped up onto the porch of the office building. “I don’t have anybody.”
Sent: You have the power to say no, Potter.
“Edward Remus Lupin!” Wide blue eyes looked up at him, chin trembling. “We do
“So fast?”
Draco wished he knew what she’d said to her friend to make such a fierce blush spread over the bloke’s cheeks. The notion that, whatever it was, it must have somehow been about him, set off a warm fluttery feeling in the pit of Draco’s stomach, a sparkling sensation that rose up his torso like bubbles in a champagne flute and soon threatened to burst out of his mouth in giggle form. Grinning, he turned back to the hopeful man by the counter.
“You’re—” And that’s when Draco finally registered what Harry’d said.
Slyvia’s voice dropped, lower now, and Draco heard her natural timbre come out. “I always think of you, Draco. Let me know if you change your mind.” She ran a finger along his arm as she walked away, and Draco swallowed.
Slyvia dropped her voice and winked. “I need
“Maybe you are, Potter, but I certainly don’t have time to—” Draco stilled as Potter came up from behind him and placed his large warm hands on Draco’s shoulders.
“Yeah,” Draco answered, because what else was there to say? Except… “I want it.”
Draco examined them, then his eyes grew wide and he looked down at Smaug. “Oh, Merlin, he has a cat!”
"Fuck, Harry," Draco groans, tightening his arms' hold around Harry's body.
Smaug stretched, then inched closer, laying his snout on Draco’s shoulder.
— crosses your features, but it’s gone before I get a chance to decipher it properly.
Fuck. Now I feel like the most selfish prick ever. Merlin, I’m sorry, I will tell them, I promise. Not today, though — I’m not as stupid as to deliberately distract Hermione this close to N.E.W.T.s week — but maybe after the exams are finally over and done with?
“You’re
When Smaug jumped up onto his lap and began to lick the tears from his face, Draco didn’t stop him.
“Oh, thank you.” She smiled gratefully and blushed, as if he’d just told her she was the prettiest girl in the room.
Harry winced at the sharp metallic sound of his whisk beating the inside of the saucepan. It felt awfully loud in the otherwise quiet kitchen, and Harry almost regretted being the cause of it. Almost. He did have a good reason for producing it, after all.
Draco met his eyes. "I want to, yes."
“That means you’re really part of the family now. Molly’s jumpers are legendary.”
“Oh, right. The Minister said he’d asked him if he would. Is it another bowl?”
“I know,” Harry murmurs against Draco’s flushed skin. “I want…”
Heart filled to bursting with emotion, Draco tore his gaze from his boyfriend to look up at the little scrap of paper framed and mounted to the wall over the shiny-new espresso machine. The sight of Janie’s scribbles made him smile just as unerringly as it always did.

Sent: Who is this?
“See?” Draco murmured as his finger brushed over Harry’s prostate, making him yowl. “So good. So fucking perfect.”
“That was an irresponsible act, and it’s no surprise he was injured,” Percy Weasley’s imperious tone cut through, and Draco watched all the siblings roll their eyes. Draco was just wondering if he could slip out the door unnoticed when the two people he’d been dreading the most entered the room.
“Was it a shoe?”
“And you think I haven’t? Godric, Draco, I’d forgotten how stubborn you are. I almost combusted waiting for you to give in.”
There’s a lot of Slytherin in me — even if self-preservation isn’t nearly my strong suit — and I bet there’s quite a lot of Ravenclaw in you, just as there is in Hermione. And even if you’ll never admit it, I know there’s a fierce lion hiding somewhere deep inside you too. I glimpsed it once, you know, lurking in a thick foliage of deliberate uncertainty. I might never find out what made you do it, but the courage you showed that day when you refused to identify me is one of the main reasons I’m still alive. That we all are.
Harry may regret a lot of things in his life, but letting his walls fall down tonight will never be one of them. If anything, he wishes he’d never erected them in the first place. It’s impossible to dwell on that, though. Not with Draco’s throbbing cock filling his mouth as he’s kneeling on the tile in the shower. Not with Draco’s lips stretched around his erection a while later when they’re tangled in the sheets on Harry’s bed. Not with Draco’s arms wrapped around him as they eventually give in to the bone-deep lethargy of sex-induced bliss. Not with Draco’s mouth still curved into a lazy smile as Harry wakes him up the next morning with a hardened nipple in his mouth and an even harder cock pressing against his thigh.
“Draco?”
“I’m telling you this because I can see how much you care about Charlie, and through him, his family.”
PSS ‘What the shell?’ Seriously, M? Your fucking unbelievable, you know that?

Harry hurried down the stairs, thanking his lucky stars he’d managed to get them both dressed before Andromeda’s impromptu Boxing Day check-in. He paused in the sitting room doorway, his heart warmed by the sight of his darling godson sitting cross-legged in front of the hearth, animatedly telling his grandmother about the previous day.
With a loud shout of Draco's name, he comes, spilling across the fist that keeps moving around him, drawing out every last sliver of pleasure he might have left in his body. It seems infinite, as though it'll go on forever, and in some vague little part of his mind, he recognises that Draco has reached his own crest, filling Harry with his release. Perhaps it's this notion that keeps Harry's orgasm going for so long.
“Er…” Harry blinked, taking in the boy’s hopeful blue eyes and the elf standing next to him, handing out candy canes. “Sure, why not?”
The Burrow, Devon
?" Harry turns, grinning. "You seem awfully concerned about…my snake." Harry drops his voice low on the final two words, emphasising the innuendo.
Dropping his hand to his own leaking cock, he stroked it slowly as he looked into Draco's lust-blown eyes.
Sent: Are you aware you just called me 'the master'?
Sirius’s voice grew quiet, and Draco waited, sure he would continue.
Draco stepped through the Floo on Saturday morning and breezed right into Pansy’s open office. Her assistant was gone for the weekend, but Draco knew he’d find his best friend at her desk. It was only another week until the Wands for Wixen event, and they both had too much to do to completely blow off the entire weekend.
I’m sorry to confirm that the War Memorial Ceremony turned out to be just as dreadful as I had anticipated. People, so many people, all dressed in black, mourning and sobbing while listening to droning speeches and depressing funeral music. I still don’t know why they all insisted on me being there. Frankly, if I’d had any say in the matter, I’d rather have been anywhere but.
Harry rolls his eyes and reaches for Draco's cock. Draco sucks in a sharp breath as Harry urges him closer, caressing the hard length and bringing it to his waiting hole. "Now," he begs.
Slyvia’s heels clicked across Draco’s ceiling. She was clearly getting ready to go out, making all the noises Draco expected to hear before a night on the town. For some reason, it only made his own lonely Friday evening seem stranger.
Sunday dinner at the Burrow was quieter than Christmas had been, with Bill, Percy, and their families missing. Hermione was on temporary bed rest for a few days, so she and Ron were absent too, leaving a more manageable ten people at the table, including Draco.
Orion's hiss sounds an awful lot like an annoyed child's, 'Yes, Mother,' making Harry laugh.
The demand shoots through Harry's groin, and in an instant, he goes harder than he's ever been before, his jeans painfully tight over his erection. Still, he ignores it and presses his hand to Draco's covered cock. He's felt it before. He's held it before, as they've gotten each other off, but he's never taken it out and examined it, never felt the weight of it on his tongue, never run it along his shadowed jaw like he wants to do now.
With his hands on Harry’s arse, Draco guides Harry’s undulating hips into a steady rhythm, meeting his every thrust with a relentless thrust of his own.

“I love it.” Draco glanced back at the thoughtful gift before returning his eyes to Harry. “Thank you.”
the one who’s supposed to know how her brain works.”
Victoire dropped a package onto his lap, and he looked up, surprised. “It’s for you. And don’t forget your stocking.”
“Splendid! And you look amazing by the way!”
Draco has wings — gorgeous, shimmering wings.
“Thank you,” Draco said as Harry handed him a pair of light grey joggers and a neutral navy tee Harry wore rarely enough for Teddy not to recognise. He rose from the bed and got dressed while Harry went through their discarded clothing in search of his missing glasses.
“It’s—?”
Sirius glanced over at the gift bag Draco picked up off the table. “What’s in the bag?”
He nodded.
She let go and reached up with one hand to pat his cheek. “You’re such a good boy.” Draco swallowed, unsure what to say to that, but a commotion behind them saved him from coming up with something fitting. Molly’s eyes flicked to the Healer inviting them inside, then turned back to Draco with a smile. “Now come on, let’s go see Charlie.”
“I’m hungry,” Teddy whines.
Sent: Can’t see anything but that atrocious shirt.
He set off down the street, his expensive shoes clicking on the pavement with each step and echoing off the buildings around him in the quiet night.
Draco felt his heart rate quicken and glared at Sirius, who just sent him a completely innocent smile in return. Fucking Black family morality.
“Hmm.” Malfoy’s lower lip seems to be trapped between his teeth and he doesn’t look all that convinced as his eyes return to Harry’s face. “It’s passable, I guess, but I’ll better make sure to fit in a proper shopping spree in our schedule at our earliest convenience.”
Honestly, I’m not sure I even want to know just how poorly that letter was written, and I do admit I’m quite relieved to not be able to give it a second look. From your reply, I can only imagine what it must have read like, so do feel free to cast an Incendio on it whenever you get the chance, okay?

Received: Or do you want to do it for me? 😉
PS I called him Tom Riddle, as this was his real name before he came up with that pretentious moniker he liked to intimidate people with.
“He usually comes with me to the Reserve and gets to run around and explore; everyone there knows him and spoils him to no end. Anyway, he recently hit his sexual maturity, and he’s not scheduled to be neutered until mid-January, so I’ve been keeping him in the flat. It’s made him get into more trouble than usual, though, thus the leather last night.”
Harry nodded. “Sounds like I need to head to St Mungo’s too. I’ll go with you.”
“One flat white and two cappuccinos, please. And…” The redhead frowned at the cake display as if the baked goods were somehow trying to goad her into submission. She always did this, conducting an inner battle of instinct versus reason, seemingly counting calories and pennies before weighing the result against her current guilt tally. The outcome, Draco had soon learnt, was always the same. “…and that’ll be all.”
Draco scowled. “Amusing? Well, I’m glad my

Draco can act all he wants, if that’s what he needs to cope, but Harry knows he misses them.
Harry hisses in question.
When morning arrived, sensibility thankfully returned, and with it, a resolute decision to forget the entire ordeal, to act as if yesterday never happened. So far, this new strategy had worked, well…not flawlessly, by any means, but well enough. At least if you didn’t count the times Draco caught himself palming his pocket to make sure The Note was still there and not a figment of his imagination. Which he didn’t. Count, that is.
Draco tried but failed to hold back a surprised snort. The Golden Son of Gryffindor calling
It hasn’t been completely abandoned since Walburga died — I believe I mentioned the Order of the Phoenix used it as HQ during the war? — but apart from Sirius staying here for about a year while he was in hiding, it’s true no one has really lived in this house, not really. And it wasn’t like Sirius ever liked being here, which isn’t strange considering his past and what this house likely represented to him. It was lawfully his, but at the same time, he had been disowned by his own mother, blasted off the family tree tapestry in the 1st-floor drawing-room, and I don’t know if the house remembered that and decided to stay loyal to Walburga rather than him, but it sure as hell didn’t seem like the house liked him very much. Not that the feeling wasn’t mutual.
“Thank you,” he managed to say again. His eyes burned with unshed tears, but he couldn’t look away and words began to fall from his mouth without his consent. “Harry, can you give me any reason why I shouldn’t marry Charlie? Any reason at all?” The moment they were out, he was horrified, but he needed to hear Harry’s answer.
Received: Awww, you’re just scared. I don't bite, you know... unless it's called for 😉
It happened so many times that eventually, Draco could swear he even heard Harry’s voice. Draco knew it wasn’t possible since the man wasn’t on the guest list, so he pushed it out of his mind and continued the conversation with the couple in front of him.
He waggled his eyebrows, and Draco groaned. “Oh, Merlin.” He wondered if Charlie had freckles on his cock.
“Draco, wait…” Harry’s voice called out to him over the ruckus.
The truth was Harry dreaded what came after — after Teddy had gone to sleep.
Merlin. If that naïve version of himself only knew this was where they’d eventually end up…
Don’t worry, my queen; I won’t steal your crown. We both know I wouldn’t make a serious contender for the title if I tried.
Oliver Wood appeared to be gone, but the smell of his aftershave still hung back in the stale hospital air. Charlie sat up in his bed, his clothing changed into fresh pyjamas.
Harry jerks awake.
He sighed. “Besides, I don’t really want to talk to him until I’ve figured it out—whatever
“Draco. You’re finally here.” Her voice was urgent but kind. “He’s awake.”
“It was…” Harry blinked again. “
“—and you haven’t put any effort into your choice of clothes—”
- Harry
Draco shook his head, but Sirius stepped forward and conjured a chair next to Molly. “Go on. What she’s not saying is that’ll do
This letter is already much too long, but just one more thing and then I’ll leave you to your day. Yes, you may have done some awful things during the war, but you’re not a monster, Draco. You never were.
Eventually, it was time for young mister Finch-Fletchley to climb the steps. As he followed one of the elves to where Draco was seated next to the oversized Christmas tree, Harry squeezed his godson’s shoulder.
Has anyone ever told you you’re good with words? Because you are. Really good. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve read your latest letter by now, but your emotional description of Narcissa still makes my chest tighten every time, an actual physical reaction, as if your words somehow had direct access to my body. All from a few strokes of ink on parchment. Have you ever considered becoming an author? I bet your biography would be much more read-worthy than all the drivel they’ve put in mine. You’d think an author would want to do their research properly, or at least contact me with some questions before they publish 800 pages of lies and gossip, but no. ‘The Boy Who Lived: The True Tale of Harry Potter’ is nothing but a made-up fairy tale, bringing the masses even more fodder for their delusional hero worship.
“You named my cat Mushu?” Wood asked, sounding amused. “Well, it’s no Colonel Wellington, but I suppose for a nickname, it’s sufficient. Thanks for making sure he didn’t die, Malfoy.” He glanced at Charlie, then added, “And I suppose that goes for Charlie, too, not just Colonel Wellington.”
Harry smiled at Teddy’s polite “Thank you” and shook his head when the elf turned to offer him one as well.
“Yes, Draco,” he said instead. “Or do you want Teddy to find us like this?”
Harry grins. "Happy birthday, Draco."
“Are you sure you won’t need any more Pepper-Up?” Draco frowned, perusing Harry’s potions cabinet. “I brought you three bottles, but…”
“It’s true,” she continued. “He jumped into the dragon paddock and pulled Charlie out. Got close enough to singe his own hair.” She had a proud smile on her face, as if Draco belonged to her in some way and she wanted everyone to know just how wonderful he was. Fucking Hufflepuffs.
Good news: I haven’t strangled anyone yet. I must admit it was close this morning, though, what with Hermione insisting we’d spend all day in the library studying. Sure, N.E.W.T.s week starts the day after tomorrow, but the weather is perfect and I can't believe I’m not out there on a broom instead of trapped in this dusty library hunched over these boring-as-fuck textbooks.
“No. Not really. But I will be, right? That’s how life is.”

them. But now that I do, I just… They’re wonderful.”
“Hannah!” he called through gritted teeth as he saw the Hufflepuff emerge from the next hospital room. “We need to talk. Now.”
“How did you get my number?”
“And you never considered going back?”
The sound of Draco’s footsteps in the hallway sends Harry’s heart racing, his body still taut and thrumming from the vision of water droplets running down Draco’s bare skin, seeking out every dip and curve of his smooth…
“That’s not heroic.”
Satisfied, he turned to answer as the visitor knocked again, and Smaug scattered off into his room.
Not until you’ve left the flat for your date, cheerful and bloody gorgeous, leaving me here, a pathetic mess of a man curled up on the couch with no one but Ben and Jerry and Michael Aspel to keep me company throughout the evening.
Draco bit his lip as he sent off the message, then promptly jumped a mile high in his seat when the phone started buzzing in his hand.
“Still think it’s possible? You don’t think I’m a hopeless case?”
It had been like this all day, not that Draco had really expected anything else. It wasn’t every day a new shop opened up in Diagon Alley, after all. And, as if his exotic injection of Muggle culture wasn’t already enough to spike the interest of everyone and their Crup, a visit to Espresso Patronum also offered the added allure of a first-hand glimpse of the infamous, enigmatic wizard who’d allegedly stolen their precious Saviour’s heart.
“Me neither,” Draco murmured a few steps further up, his eyes dark and dazed as he captured Harry’s lips in a bruising kiss.
So why did he feel like shit? Why was his stomach turning, his head aching, and his chest tightening at even the notion of tying himself to the man whom he’d been obsessing over for an entire year?
“Oh, well, then, you’ll see Harry and George run the fireworks display. How nice.”
(Honestly? We’re really doing this? All right then, Draco, suit yourself; we’re on.)
“Nope, just me.” Harry glanced back over his shoulder, his eyes narrowed, but once he turned back to face Draco again, he smiled. “Are you on the way to the Reserve?”
Please don’t remind me about that awful day in Myrtle’s bathroom. As you already know, it’s still plaguing me every other night, and I’m pretty sure I’ll have to live with the regret for the rest of my life. I know I shouldn’t have done that to you, no matter what spell you were trying to hit me with, and I still can’t explain why I chose to use that spell. As you say, an Expelliarmus would’ve sufficed just fine, and instead, I went with an unfamiliar curse, unaware of what it would do to you. ‘For enemies’ the description had said, nothing else. Hell, I didn’t even know who’d invented it at the time. Did he ever tell you it was his spell that nearly bled you dry? I bet he didn’t; I sure as hell wouldn’t have wanted to, had I been in his shoes. But then again, he was an awfully brave man, so maybe he did.
why Draco was going over to Harry’s tonight — to help him study. Nothing else. Draco resolutely reined in his galloping delusions.
Sent: Why? You don't have any rhythm!
Harry’s frown grew deeper, but he took it and turned it over in his hands. “A regular silver Sickle.”
Draco knew it was his charm, rather than his excellent barista skills, that had earned him the customer votes for the Employee of the Month award five times in a row now.
“You still up for tonight?”
“So will you,” Harry hastened to assure him. “I saw you with the kids last week. They all adored you.”
Actually, you know what? Writing this, I just realised your parents weren’t all that different from them — my aunt and uncle that is, not my parents. (Merlin, don’t ever let any of them know I said that, Draco; we do
“I object.”
When the Emergency Portkey dropped Draco and Charlie into the Creature-Induced Injuries ward, they were immediately surrounded by Healers and Mediwixen who took charge. Charlie was levitated and rushed away, and Draco sat on the floor where he’d landed, stunned.
Draco opened the door to find Harry sitting behind a large desk, a sleek laptop open in front of him. Harry didn’t look up as he mumbled, “Just a minute. I need to finish this email.”
“B-but,” Potter stuttered, “Charlie’s not engaged. He’s not even seeing anybody regularly. I mean, it’s
Smaug, sensing Draco’s distress, pawed at his shirt and tucked his head into the crook of Draco’s arm, purring. Grateful for the support, Draco did his best to relax. “Sirius says—”
Draco held out his hand, willing it not to tremble as he offered Harry the coin.
“Ginny said I’d find you out here. You broke up, then?”
“I think I’ll have the cinnamon coffee cake today, if you please, and a cup of tea.”
He looks back down at the feather in his hand and recalls the dreams.
he put wards on his flat? True, he hadn’t used much magic at all since he entered the Muggle world, partly because he didn’t want anything to do with anything reminding him of the world he’d decided to leave behind, partly because he feared any use of magic would enable the members of said world to track him down. He’d felt awfully lost and vulnerable without being able to rely on his magic, but at least he’d finally been safe from all the witches and wizards who had taken it upon themselves to purge the magical world of anyone who had been on the wrong side of the war, regardless of the official sentences given and served per the Wizengamot’s rulings. These days, magic was all but a closed chapter of his life, and now he thought about it, he couldn’t even remember the last time he’d held his wand. Apart from the magic still flowing through his veins, he was practically a Muggle now, and, apparently, he’d lost his self-preservation and common sense somewhere along the way.
“We should go sledging!”
Flirty guy’s order is, of course, an appreciative nod to
“Are you sleeping in here, or are you coming to my room?” Draco asked the animal. “I’ve had a long night and don’t have the energy to argue.”
He pulled back but let her hold on to his hands. “Thanks, Molly. You’ve all been really wonderful and made what could have been a horrible week into something I’ll never forget.”
you?”
“Yes,” Draco said, watching them carefully. Smaug usually hid from guests in the flat. He was very friendly at the Reserve but generally preferred only Draco in their home, and sometimes Slyvia.
Received: Seriously? And here I thought you were clever...
“Coming! Good luck,” she added with a wink in Draco’s direction before hurrying away. Draco took a deep breath, turning towards Charlie’s room. He could do this.
“You’ll know.”
Harry shrugs. “Potato, tomahto.”
…until Draco smiles and murmurs, “I don’t mind.”
“Mm-hmm, dreams. Been having them for quite some time now; ever since my birthday. I just couldn’t remember them after I woke up. But they made me want more. They showed me what I was missing, and—” He moves his hand over Draco’s soft skin, sliding his palm along the length of his arm, over tense muscle and up to Draco’s shoulder. He should be freezing cold, standing half-naked and barefoot in the brisk November night, but he isn’t. He’s warm, warm and glowing, and so, so gorgeous. “—and I want that. I want you. Please.”
“He what?”
“There you are! Come in, come in,” he said, stepping aside to let Draco into his narrow hallway. “Dinner’s about ready.”
“I’m not drinking tonight. Fireworks, remember?”
Then Harry’s thumb moved, just a tentative brush of skin against sensitive skin, and with a tremor, Draco came undone. In one single stroke, Draco’s floodgates were unlocked and left wide open, allowing for all resistance to flow out of his system and make room for nothing but aching need and desperate desire. In one single stroke, Draco’s pent-up emotions came bursting out of his mouth in one raunchy moan. In one single stroke, Draco’s hold on his own body gave way, releasing his hips to finally thrust against the mattress the way they’d been craving to do for so long.
“How did you two meet?”
‘Someone who has the ability to make your heart race and your toes curl’? Seriously, M, what the fuck happened to you?
“Good night, Pansy. Yes, yes, I’ll be fine. You worry about getting yourself home.”
He yawned and prepared to stretch, but a man’s low voice talking to Molly in the doorway halted him.
been surprisingly pleasant so far. And considering the way Harry was once again topping up their glasses, he didn’t seem all too eager to call it a night either. A fresh bout of anticipation fluttered through Draco’s body at the mere thought.
I don’t know why the notion rattles me this much. I should have known this was bound to happen, sooner or later. I should have known you wouldn’t stay content playing house with your best mate forever; you’re not like me. You want more. And why shouldn’t you? After everything you’ve been through, you’re definitely worth it. You used to be so misguided, but you’ve changed since then. You’re a decent person now. Amazing even. And you’re beautiful. Fucking fabulous.
“Makes sense, I guess.” Harry cleared his throat. “Listen, I brought you an engagement present.”
Despite its title, it’s actually not a coffee shop AU, but even so, it’s friggin’ awesome, so if you haven’t read it already, please promise you’ll do it asap (after you’ve finished this one, obviously 😉)
PPS I suppose you could technically be considered handsome by some people who care enough to notice. And yes, apparently you’re clever enough to have given Hermione a good run for the top grades all these years. But why should I miss your obnoxious vanity? Why should I long for your ‘brilliant brain’ when I’m best friends with the brightest student of our generation? I simply said I’d have appreciated a rivalling seeker to play with sometimes, and an antagonist to rile up in the corridors when I’m down and in need of an adrenaline boost. If Misinterpretation was a N.E.W.T. subject, you’d ace it.
Your faithful listener,
“Of course you can.” Harry chuckled, “but I’m here if you change your mind, alright?”
“Oh, well, in that case. If you’ll excuse us, Mr and Mrs Champon,” Draco said lightly, unsure where the confidence in his voice was coming from. Thank Merlin for years of pure-blood training, he supposed.
“Your hair looks nice today, by the way,” Draco says, thankfully tearing Harry’s thoughts away from the mental view of his perfectly rounded arse. “Did you try that untousling potion I mentioned the other day?”
“Welcome to Santa Claus’ Corner!” said the cheery elf manning the steps. “What is being your name, young sir?”
“H-Harry Potter?”
Draco’s strong hands found their way back to Harry’s arse, grabbing it eagerly and pressing their bodies even closer together with every thrust. Without breaking their kiss, Harry reached up to relieve Draco of his coat, pushing it over his shoulders and revelling in the feel of bared skin under his palms as he followed its path down Draco’s upper arms. It got stuck at his elbows, of course, what with Draco’s hands being occupied where they were, and Harry tugged on the garment until Draco got the message and reluctantly let go of his hold.
"Do you have to ask?"
Potter’s words echoed through his mind, and for the first time in his life, Draco finally let himself believe them.
Harry follows Draco’s gaze, suddenly wondering the same. “No idea.” On the screen, some weird-looking insect is climbing a long blade of grass, making it buckle under its weight. “Want to join me?”
Saturday 24 July 1999
Draco shook off the nagging feeling and grabbed his tongs to transfer a cauldron cake — another one of his wizarding additions to the classical coffeeshop assortment — from the glass display case to a waiting plate. As he did, he took a mental note of soon having to restock the House cheesecakes. Again. He wasn’t even sure Greg had more of all four flavours ready in the back yet, but he sure hoped so. The cakes had been far more popular than any one of them had expected, but that’s house pride for you. Anything claiming to be connected to any of the Hogwarts Houses always seemed to bring it out in people, no matter their allegiances.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” Harry began formally, his voice soft but determined. “I love you. I’m so sorry that I didn’t say anything sooner, and—”
Which was dangerous territory and something Draco didn’t need to contemplate.
He laughed at himself; he sounded ridiculous.
“Yes, why— Wait, my
“No, you’re not.” Malfoy’s warm smile is like a soothing balm. “None of us are. We all have our quirks, our flaws and weaknesses; they’re what makes us precious and unique. No one would endure living with someone who is perfect in every way, it would only make you feel inadequate and even more of a failure. So be yourself. Hopefully, it will also encourage your date to do the same.”
“Sorry,” mumbled a teenager who stepped on his foot, likely more by reflex than genuine apology.
“Hey, Hannah, how is he today?” Draco asked as he approached the Healer station in the middle of the ward.
“That’s not the point. If you want this to work, you’ll have to pretend that this is real. You need to treat me as if I were the girl of your dreams.”
PPS Thank Merlin you’re over Theo. I wouldn’t have wanted to come between the two of you if you weren’t. Now I only have to figure out who the secret love of your life is, so I don’t accidentally kiss him too. I’m sure you’d never forgive me if I did.
Arthur laughed. “Charlie doesn’t have a cat. He hates cats.”
Right.
“Oh, you…” The rest of the sentence fled Draco’s mind as Harry’s hands crept up his torso, his touch as frustratingly feather-light as before.
. It didn’t matter anyway, since Draco took the opportunity to silence him with another brutal kiss, invading Harry’s mouth with his hot, wet tongue. Harry thrust against him and gasped as Draco’s hard erection rubbed against his own through several layers of clothing.
Scowling, Draco entered his kitchen not waiting for Harry to follow him. “Right, well, I haven’t wanted to live in the manor for a decade, so I suppose I’ve changed.”
Draco had never enjoyed a workout session more, and once wrung out and sated, they fell asleep in each other’s arms, all cuddled up under Harry’s luxurious duvet. The next morning, Harry insisted they’d continue the study session from the previous night, with Draco on his back this time, but, not surprisingly, they didn’t even last more than a few minutes before they got distracted with other, far more interesting activities. Not that Harry had really needed the study help in the first place — he’d done his homework and would surely have aced the exam regardless — but Draco was only too happy to play along.
“This amazing, brilliant, terribly attractive cousin…” …
Harry’s smile faltered with every retreating footfall. They wouldn’t have any chance to talk tomorrow, not as long as Draco was on the clock. And then he’d be gone, whisked away by international Portkey to celebrate the holidays with his mother and Andromeda in France.
. Only a reckless Gryffindor would ever consider drinking on the job when your closest colleagues are seriously dangerous beasts like Daenerys. Draco wanted to smack him over the head and tell him he’d been an irresponsible twat, but he figured it wasn’t his place. Even if their engagement hadn’t been fake, Charlie was a grown man and responsible for his own actions.
Draco growled and lunged, taking Harry’s mouth in a fierce kiss that wiped away every trace of coherent thought from Harry’s mind and left him breathless. When Draco withdrew, it was only to assault Harry’s neck instead, mouthing his way down Harry’s stubbled skin to the accompanying sound of Harry’s needy whimpers. With a bit of hard-earned concentration, Harry managed to wriggle his wrists out of Draco’s grip, freeing his hands to slide under the fabric of Draco’s fur-brimmed coat. The broad leather belt was already on the floor, fallen off after Draco’s body had returned to its usual lean self. None of them had noticed it fall, too wrapped up in each other to pay attention to such trivial things as the clunking sound of a heavy metal buckle meeting wooden floorboards.
You are chatting, Richard is appraising, Michael is smiling — none of you aware of the heart breaking in my chest.
“I— Sorry. Hi. I, um…”
He took a glass of wine from a passing tray and thanked the server, then set to his task. It was time to mingle.
The climax rips through Harry like a Hippogriff's claws across silk sheets. There's nothing smooth about this, and it pulls him to shreds.
closer. Closer to Draco. Confused, intrigued, and dizzy from a flood of emotions he cannot even begin to name, Harry takes several shaky steps towards the man.
“—neither of these a good first impression on a date.”
Narcissa got away pretty much the same way you did, actually. She risked her life to save mine, and once the Wizengamot found out about that, they seemed to calm down enough to take that into account before they reached their verdict. I never told them she only did it out of fear of losing you in the battle, but maybe it would comfort you to know that. She does love you, you know, more than anything.
Harry just stares at his snake, then notices Draco standing there watching, waiting.
Hermione came out of her initial shock over our correspondence sooner than I’d expected. It only took her a couple of hours, a bottle of wine, and an intense 57-questions interrogation the same evening to eventually accept it. Not that I was ever worried that she wouldn’t. She’s usually a reasonable woman, unlike her boyfriend. Ron still alternates between ignoring the topic altogether and muttering agitatedly about it under his breath. Taken from the frustrated glares Hermione gives him whenever he does that, I’m ready to bet my Firebolt that there’ve been several heated discussions on the matter between the two of them in my absence since I broke the news. No surprise there, really, I know them both well enough to have predicted this very outcome ages ago.
.” Harry moans into Draco’s mouth; it feels so fucking good. So fucking perfect. Panting heavily, he glances down between them, intrigued by the sight of their equally raging erections moving against each other through obscenely tented trousers. “Oh fuck, Draco. I’m going to…”
“Hi, Smaug. I’m Harry. Aren’t you a handsome little fellow?”
“I— Yeah.” The girl frowned as she perused the display of baked goods. “Any recommendations? I…” She hesitated, then seemed to come to a decision. Turning back to Draco, she murmured, “She told me to surprise her…”
“It’s basically just around the block from the coffee shop. I’ll text you the address.”
As Harry walked over to sit in his chair, Draco was unable to look away from the sight of him in his scruffy blue jeans and washed-out, once-black t-shirt.
He shook his head. “No, I don’t believe so.” His heartbeat quickened as his mind began to catch up with what had happened back at the Reserve. He looked around. “Charlie. Where is he? I need to see Charlie.”
Molly, though, only looked pleased. “Do you cook, then? Well, that’s lovely, isn’t it?”
The supertalented artist
. Because of Charlie, his sort-of-fiancé.
“They’re waiting on you. The Healer is in with him now, but the family is gathered outside the room, waiting on you before they go in. You have to join them.”
“Fuck,” he mutters, breathing heavily. Harry tries to catch his breath, gaze fixed on the man in front of him, his kiss-swollen lips, his flushed skin, his heavy-lidded eyes.
Draco cringed but nodded. “Yes, I suppose I did,” he said, uncomfortable at the praise given everything else he was about to tell them. “But when we got there, they took him away and someone”— his eyes met Hannah’s in the back of the room, and she gave him an encouraging nod —“misunderstood something I said in my exhaustion. The truth is, though, other than a quick greeting from time to time on the Reserve, Charlie and I had never spoken. And we were never engaged.”
He’s not obsessed, though. He’s just intrigued. Interested. Curious.
Draco gasped as the pad of Harry’s thumb stroked the sensitive skin of his inner thigh, causing a muscle in his left arse cheek — one of the glutes maybe? Draco had no idea, it wasn’t like he’d been able to pay any attention to the content of Harry’s quiet murmurings — to twitch without his permission. Harry stilled midstroke, his hand hot on Draco’s leg as he fell silent, as if choked by the sudden tension crackling in the air between them.
Sent: I'm just thinking of all the ways you're going to owe me for this.
He is here.
Draco leans in, the tip of his nose grazing the shell of Harry’s ear as he adds, whispering, “Always will be.”
Received: We've been dancing around each other for a decade and then you just act like you don't know me…
“That’s terrible,” Mrs Champon gasped, and her husband put his arm around her. “I can’t imagine. Those poor children.”
“Have I ever told you about my lucky coin?”
Harry didn’t hesitate. He leaned in, his lust-blown eyes never leaving Draco’s as he braced himself with one hand next to Draco’s head and licked his lips.
conform to the
. Draco couldn’t stand to listen to any more, and he hurried off down the hall.
A noise in the hallway caught his attention and he looked over, but there was nobody there. He was still alone. He sat back in the chair and tilted his head back, staring at the ceiling.
It was perfect. It was an exact fit, and the colour was just what he would have picked out on his own. His eyes found Molly’s, and he smiled. “Thank you,” he mouthed, and she grinned.
It was like a physical representation of everything that made his life so pathetic. There was nobody except his fox to give a flying Hippogriff shit that he wasn’t there with them to celebrate the holiday. There wasn’t even a true reason for him to be at the Reserve. Not really. To man the offices? What was the point? Most of the keepers already lived on the grounds, all perfectly capable of taking care of the high-maintenance beasts without his assistance. And it wasn’t like anyone would be visiting or requiring access from outside on a day like this.
“I can’t believe how genuine you look,” he said. “How did you—?
Draco didn’t wait for Harry to follow as he went in search of his friends. He probably had better things to do than hang around with Draco all night anyway. Unfortunately. As predicted, Draco found Pansy and Ernie close to the bar, surrounded by a handful of other people Draco knew through his work for the foundation. “Pans!”
“Well, that won’t be a problem, would it, since we’ll not be dating for real? It’s just one friend helping out another. You know what? Go out with me, and I bet you ten Galleons your Valentine’s date will end up better than any other date you’ve ever had.”
“Come for me, Draco. I’m right there with you…”
”No worries.” Draco offered her an encouraging smile. “Want anything else to go with your drinks?” He gestured towards the vitrine.
Harry didn’t seem to need the nudge Molly was giving him, though, and gave Draco a little smile. “No, please, let me walk with you. At least to the coffee shop across the street? I’ll buy you one before you head home.”
Harry hesitated then returned, “See you, Draco,” his soft voice smooth as melted chocolate as it travelled down Draco’s spine.
"What are you thinking?" Draco whispered in his ear. "You look like Orion after he's eaten a fat mouse."
He turned back to Charlie.
“TTTP?”
The low din of people cheering could be heard through the muffling Privacy Charm, and Draco pulled back, his arms now around Harry’s neck, his fingers tangled in his messy hair. “I—” He cleared his throat, but his voice still came out husky when he tried again. “I think we have an audience.”
“It’s so strange to see him like this, so quiet and still. Charlie’s always been one of the most active of Molly’s sons, constantly running around and full of life. This is…unsettling.”
Yet, I realise that I could never risk you finding out, could never risk having you walk out of my life now that we’ve finally learnt how to get along.
Hannah led Draco down the hallway to a private room. The lights were turned down low, and the hum of the monitoring spells echoed in the background. “He’s in a coma while his body and magic heal,” she said quietly, “but some believe comatose people can still hear subconsciously, so sit down, let him hear your voice.”
Malfoy’s eyes narrow and, for a brief moment, Harry wonders if he’s gone too far. With Malfoy, it’s always hard to know where to draw the line.
“You work?” Harry asked, sounding incredulous, both eyebrows now halfway towards his hairline.
Draco pocketed the time-turner without a second thought and turned around to find Minette taking in Bellatrix’s handiwork with wide eyes.
The sun has moved a good bit across the sky when Harry hears the voices coming closer to his favoured spot under the trees near the lake. He's fully in the shade now, alone after Orion abandoned him a while ago, slithering farther and farther away in his never-ending quest for the sun's warming rays.
“Don’t do anything?” Sirius argued. “They float and they squeak. You know, when Harry was a baby, it was the only thing he ever wanted to play with while in the bath. He had a dozen, at least.”
, I work. Now, if you’ll excuse me.”
Your white-blond hair stands out like a beacon in the dark, making you look almost ethereal. Your skin-tight jeans hug your form in all the right places and the sheer fabric of your shirt is plastered to your sweaty skin, outlining every dip and curve of your toned torso. You look positively gorgeous. You always do. But somehow, there’s even more to you when you’re in this state. You look confident, dishevelled, carefree — and happier than I’ve ever seen you before.
Draco winked and sauntered out the door, disappearing down the corridor towards his lab.

“I know,” you say, offering a playful pout that makes me want to lean in and suck that protruding lip into my mouth, maybe even nibble on it for a while. “What I don’t know is
“He wants to talk to you, Mr Malfoy,” Mrs Champon said on Draco’s right from where she and her husband were eagerly watching the interaction. “Do you know Mr Potter?”
. Draco suppressed a groan. He’d do almost anything to keep hearing that glorious sound every day for the rest of his life. “Actually, it’s part of my kinesiology major, so more like an athletic trainer or exercise physiologist or something. I haven’t really decided yet.”
“I-I just don’t want to…” Harry lowers his gaze to find Malfoy’s hand on his own, his pale thumb brushing gently over the darker skin of Harry’s knuckles. He swallows. “…end up alone.”
This morning, though, one hadn’t been enough. Draco had been on his fifth even before the morning rush ebbed away, and the only reason he hadn’t suffered a major caffeine overdose yet was that the last hour’s never-ending line of customers had prevented him from tending to his own needs and cravings. It seemed like every person within a five-mile radius had suddenly decided to frequent Beans & Serendipitea this very afternoon, and Draco honestly couldn’t wait for his shift to end.
As soon the decision had been made, something warm and comforting settled in Harry’s gut. It spread throughout his body, pleasant and soothing, draining the tension from his stiff shoulders and slowing down the rapid beating of his heart. Even the pixies in his stomach were finally lulled to sleep. Harry had thought it would be hard, letting go; he’d thought it would be agonising and painful and all but unbearable. It wasn’t. He had expected sorrow, anticipated the bitter taste of defeat, and instead, what welcomed him now was nothing but a liberating feeling of relief.
I’m not entirely sure how to feel about it, to be honest. A part of me is genuinely happy for him. He’s always looked up to his older brothers, and even though they’ve always teased and taunted him, I also know they all love each other very much. With Fred gone, I reckon it’ll be good for both of them to have each other close, especially for George. Not that Ron could ever replace Fred, but because having Ron by his side will hopefully make him feel less abandoned and alone.
“Don’t worry, Potter. We’ll work on it come Monday.” Malfoy’s eyes sparkle with mirth as he takes a seat next to him. “I’m sure there’s a way to whip it into submission somehow.”
“You all right?” Harry’s words cut through his musings.
“I don’t know,” Harry says. And if his voice is a tad strained, he decides to ignore it. “You’re the pro, Malfoy. Surprise me.”
“You did?” Andromeda said from the green flames of the Floo.
Jess nodded and spelled the door open for them so they could leave, and Draco stepped out into the cool night, Harry at his side.
Draco lifted the coin to take a better look at it. A regular silver Sickle, it seemed, only… instead of the usual dragon, there was the head of a man. And not any man either, but the man sitting next to him; Harry Potter, the grown-up version. Draco squinted to read the engraving underneath, not believing his eyes as he finally made out the date. Holy—
“Please…”
You may be a poncy git, M, but you know what? Even poncy gits should have the right to be happpy. (Well, as long as their happiness isn’t depending on someone else’s misery, that is.) Who knows, maybe a
It wasn’t Slyvia.
Draco’s heart started to race, but he refused to let his mind contemplate Harry’s declaration.
friend;
Draco turned to Charlie. “I’ll let you two talk. I’ve left the bag with your things over there on the table. I noticed the cat food in your coat, and I’ve been stopping by the cottage every day to feed Mushu.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, he’s playing with it and tossing it around. He won’t eat it. He’s too smart for that.”
Draco stood, stunned, heart racing, disbelieving what he’d just seen.
With only a few days to go before Christmas, Diagon Alley was just as crammed as Harry had feared it might be. He rarely ventured into the heart of Wizarding London anymore, and when he eventually did, he always planned to avoid the peak hours to evade the crowds as much as possible. Not that he didn’t like people, per se, it was just… Too many at once had a tendency to hinder him from living his life with any semblance of normalcy. And if there was anything he craved after the war, it was normalcy.
“Will you? Will you let me make you happy? Will you be my family?”
“Witches and wizards, thank you for coming here today to bear witness to the union of Charles Cadmus Weasley and Draco Lucius Malfoy. A union between two souls is—”
“What?” Harry asked, looking over, the pleasant humming suddenly gone.
“You promise?”
Harry chuckled, sounding tired now. “Fuck you.”
“Hey, sunshine.”
Yeah, I already know what you’re going to say; that I should just man up and start acting like a responsible adult, right? And that if you’ve been able to go through the manor and fix it all up, I should be able to do the same with my shit. I know. I really should. And I guess I’ll just have to do it at some point, but right now I prefer to just hang around here, play quidditch with the others in the back garden, help Arthur with his muggle research, and let Molly feed me to her heart’s content.
Draco added a flourish on the end of the current invitation and picked it up, staring at the words.
“Yeah.” Harry smiles. “Have a nice evening.”
Draco sighs and leans back, placing his head in Harry's lap. For all the world, he seems relaxed, but Harry notices the tension in Draco's shoulders. "I just have a lot more to prove with my scores than you guys do. And if word of my…condition…is made known—"
As Draco rang up the order and placed their cookies on a plate, he felt his muted phone vibrate in his pocket, not once, but twice in quick succession. He ignored it, of course, no way was he going to pick up his phone in front of a paying customer. Instead, he busied himself making the couple’s drinks, forcing himself to focus as he reached the critical stage, this time managing to produce a perfect cinnamon heart on the chai latte.
It's exhilarating, more so than flying on his broom. Like this, Harry is completely reliant on Draco, an exposed position he doesn't put himself in often, with anyone. He doesn't have to watch where they're going or pay attention to his height or speed. Instead, he can simply hold on to the man he loves and just
He rolled his eyes in a manner Harry had always thought universally exclusive to melodramatic teenagers. Teddy did that sometimes, acting much older than his years, and Harry usually had a hard time hiding his amusement whenever it happened. Tonight, though, it barely registered with him, distracted as he was by the implication of Teddy’s words.
He leaned over and rested his head on Slyvia’s shoulder. “Thank you.”

“I’m taken.” Merlin knows I’m not, but since we started coming here, I’ve found it to be the easiest way to get rid of the likes of him; the ones who decide to try their luck with the lonely, silent man by the bar.
Harry licks his lips. “Too long.”
I swallow around the lump in my throat, burning eyes fixed on the screen.
Hannah greeted Draco as he returned to Charlie’s floor. He must have had a particular look on his face because she approached him and pulled him into a hug.
