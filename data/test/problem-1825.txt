Draco arched an eyebrow. “Er…sure. We won’t get married. Not that I think you have to worry about that anyhow.” He wonders…does Scorpius…?
He was trying, far too hard, and so was Draco for that fact. But if he was being completely honest, the bleached blonde that stood him up could be sitting in Harry’s seat at this very moment and it wouldn’t feel any different.
There is a brief moment when her words hang in the quiet air then settle down like the dust on the headmaster's desk. Then Ron is shrieking in disgust and Harry’s brows are rising to his hairline. “How did you know?” After all these years, Hermione can still surprise him with her cleverness.
Shrouded in silence, Draco wonders if between the time that she saw him and the time that it took to get him water if Hermione stumbled upon a sudden epiphany: that she actually doesn’t give a single damn about what was wrong with him and that if he was settling for drinking in the dark, then what does it matter to her? He wouldn’t blame her if that was her reasoning.
Potter lowers his gaze and his face hardens in a way Draco had never seen before. That must be a first. In the years he’s spent watching him, hating him, taunting him, Draco has probably seen every emotion cross his face. But not this one. This must be his parenting look.
it produces when it smashes up against the neighboring wall. He had several bones to pick with Potter and he wanted his full attention when he plucked him bare.
Draco tenses. Either Potter doesn’t understand what it means to drop it or he just doesn’t fucking care. “And if I do?”
“The worst part was how she treated him. Scorpius.” Wine, no, liquor was needed. He stretches out his tense back. Brown liquor, specifically. Harry wraps his finger around his pinky in a silent show of encouragement. “She never cared for him, ever. I thought, after he was born, that she just had trouble connecting to him. I thought maybe she was suffering from postpartum depression, but for ten years? I never tried to hold that against her, but there were only so many times she could forget to feed him or ignore him when he was talking to her before I had enough. She always acted as if he didn’t even exist.”
Draco scoffs. He had enough money in Gringotts to buy a small country. Granted it was Wizarding money but still! He doesn’t need whatever few crumpled notes she has stuffed away in her god ugly handbag.
He winces. Merlin please be with him. Don’t let him strangle this man. “Jaspers,” he says in a soft, even voice, “I am in the middle of presenting right now. Can this not wait until after?”
Harry twists his mouth up and for a second, guilt runs through Draco’s veins at the sight. He looks on the verge of crying. Maybe from frustration. Or anger. Harry takes a breath, recomposing himself as he says, “Two. Several of my students who have anxiety do the same things as you: worrying excessively about the time, hyperventilate—”
He won’t ask, because it's not something you should ask, but Draco has a sneaking suspicion that George Weasley isn’t quite
“Thomas and Finnigan?” Malfoy supplies, letting his arms drop down to his sides dramatically when Harry's face remains blank. “Have you really not noticed?”
In the back of his mind, Draco wonders if Potter is toying with him. If he knows he’s gay and was only flirting just to see how he’ll react. The thought makes his jaw harden and his teeth ache.
Draco looks at him, the vicious expression on his face so far removed from his ridiculous insult. His breath hitches in his throat in that wonderfully good way and he has to put his hands on his knees to keep from toppling over from laughter.
cared about what Scorpius thinks. Why would he not? Scorpius’ opinion matters more to him than anyone’s, he can’t just
“Uh, thanks,” he says, his manners keeping him from making a move to eat the toast. “And if you must know, I was just out on a date. A rather forgetful one if I do say so myself.” He scowls at the toast when a pre-drunk memory of the boring bleached blonde whose name still hasn’t occurred to him infiltrates his mind.
The fresh air never felt so good as he walked down the steps of the school building, Harry on his heels.
Draco nods, refusing to give in and smile at the odd little boy Potter produced. “Thanks. I won’t.” He's never going to live this down.
Draco shakes his head at a rapid pace. “No! No, I swear it’s not you it’s… ugh, it’s me.” He cringes. “Sorry to hit you with such an abysmal cliché, but it’s true. It’s just that I haven’t…fuck, well I haven’t actually done this before. Not real stuff at least.” Sighing wearily, he rubs the bridge of his nose. “Look, you know I’m not actually a girl—”
His jaw clenches under his beard and Draco knows he is starting to tread on thin ice with him. “What’s your problem with them? They already know about us, it’s not like it's some big secret. And before you say anything, no, they don’t hate you anymore. You said it yourself, some of us have grown up since Hogwarts.” He waves a hand between Draco and himself pointedly. “So why can’t you give them a chance?”
Blaise and Draco help bring Pansy over to Floo, her hands still clutching her stomach. “You’re the only responsible person in this house, twerp,” she groans out to Scorpius, patting him on the cheek as she and Blaise disappear into the flames.
“He’s always forgetting things,” Potter explains. Flashing her a smile that could read as charming to literally anyone but Draco, his fingers grip onto his shoulder with a friendly familiarity. He leans towards Ana, cupping a hand over his mouth and loudly whispering in a faux secretive tone to her, “Can you believe he’s only 31? The doctors say not to start worrying at this early stage unless he starts misplacing his keys in the refrigerator.”
The word married rings about in his mind, swirling and dizzying like a twirling teacup on a platter.
Malfoy smirks. With fluttered lashes, he leans closer to him, his hands cutting and dicing the potion ingredients with perfect ease. He didn’t even need to look at the textbook or his notes for help, almost instinctively knowing what to do. Harry’ll give him that— Malfoy sure did know how to brew a perfect potion.
“You ought to be using this time cutting those carrots rather than trying to apologize for something you’re already forgiven for.” She smiles at him, far too reminiscent of his own mother. “Isn’t that right, Draco?”
“Of course I do,” he lies through clenched teeth. He actually has no idea how it looks and he doesn’t fancy seeing it anytime soon. “I’m fine Harry, clearly or I wouldn’t be here.”
Draco gives an undignified squeak in protest. “Sorry if I don’t devour my breakfast like a slobbering mutt.” He grimaces when in that moment, Potter accidentally drops a piece of bacon into his lap. He picks it up and eats it without any hesitation.
Swallowing nervously, he sees Harry’s jaw set into a strict line even underneath his beard. “No. That’s not why.”
Draco thins his lips in a promising attempt to keep from smiling at Potter’s… oddness. “Don’t worry about it Potter,” he says tiredly. His knees hurt from being on the floor for too long and he shifts down to lay on his bottom, drawing his legs up to his chest and wrapping his arms around himself like he always does when he finds himself having the desire to be small. “I just worry about Scorpius is all. And about...things.”
He doesn’t know how long he sits there, on the cold, hard ground of his kitchen with Firewhiskey bottles scattered around him and thinking drunken thoughts about moths fluttering around lights when the Floo whooshes to life.
the school and not away from it. “You look fine,” he insists. And he really does; glasses fit his face perfectly. “You are far more handsome than me when I was your age. A pair of glasses doesn’t change that.”
Draco mouths a silent ‘thank you’ to Areum as Harry begins to speak. She winks at him from the corner of her eye.
“It’s about Ha—Potter,” he coughs and dives headfirst into the jugular of the problem. “Okay listen, I’ve been trying so hard, but fuck, Blaise, what is he not understanding? Do you think he’s stupid? Am I dating a stupid man? I mean how hard is it to pick up my bloody hints? It’s like he doesn’t even want to and I don’t think I can handle any more of his—”
Draco swings his braid over his shoulder, a coy smile emerging on his lips. “Well I didn’t actually charm the sky, if that’s what you’re thinking, I simply…” He frowns. “You know what? I think I may bore you to death with the details and magical theories involved but just know it’s essentially the reverse of a Disillusion charm plus a Magnifying spell. A very strong Disillusion charm and Magnifying spell.” It took weeks to create the telescope-like charm and even longer to cast it and place the intricate spells needed so that it wasn’t viewable to Muggles. Just thinking about the months-long process exhausted him.
the bottle off the floor, depositing a generous amount of lube onto his palm and covering every inch of Harry’s cock with it.
She blushes prettily, though for a moment Draco wonders if he’s managed to offend her by the surprised expression riddled on her features. “Oh you’re too kind, Mr. Malfoy, but I’m no professor. Please, just call me Ana.”
A wry grin forms on his face as he shrugs, plastering on that faux look of innocence that would have annoyed him if it wasn’t so adorable. He leans back into the fuzzy grey couch, arms outreached on the bridge. “It makes you look softer.”
No, no. The git was a snake, he had to remember that. Who cares what his arse looked like or what was underneath his poncy skirt?
They sit in a silence so uncomfortably thick that Draco’s almost ready to hex himself when Harry says, “The reason I’m not an Auror, Draco, is that I couldn’t
Harry rolls his eyes. Prick. “Fine, I swear on my magic and on my ‘stupid scar’ that I won’t go blabbering about whatever ridiculous secret you’re about to tell me.”
As soon as he suggests that he finish, Draco closes his eyes, letting his head loll to the side as he pretends to snore. His jaw was aching and good Merlin, he'd do just about anything to get a few moments of sleep— anything except putting a cock in his mouth. He was 31 years old, nearly 32, and Draco thinks he can honestly say that he’s a bit too old to stay up past midnight on a good night. Much less suck someone off at one am.
Fortunately for Potter, being in the middle of Muggle London protects him from being hex senseless. Unfortunately for Draco, being in the middle of Muggle London prevents him from hexing Potter senseless.
Draco takes a seat on the plush velvet couch, patting the spot next to him as an indication to sit. He does, shuffling forward like he was a predator waiting to strike.
Pansy throws her head back and laughs, her virgin drink spilling into her hand. “I’m going to pee! I swear I’m going to!” Her fists bang on the table and she cackles loudly.
Harry follows Ron’s finger and swallows when he sees Malfoy leaning seductively across the table with one leg placed delicately behind the other, his back arched beautifully in front of them and wonderfully displaying his perfect arse. As much as he hated to admit it—Ron was right. About the skirt
Draco shakes his head, feeling slightly silly for his panicking but all the more relieved to know that he was fine. “No, everything’s alright Scorp. I was just checking on you—”
happened. And who would have been there to stop or tell me that something went wrong, that he needed me? No one.” He tugs anxiously at his braid. “After that, I just can’t seem to relax when he’s not near me. I don’t know how I’m going to cope when he goes to Hogwarts next year.”
Draco lets out a rather combative breath. “Yeah.” He searches for something to say as he stares out of the window, his eyes searching for signs of malice in a ten year old boy who could be thrown askew by a strong gust of wind. Warm, brown eyes penetrate his skin as she waits for further explanation. “Scorpius and I are going through a bit of a transition right now. I thought— I thought the move may help him.” His mouth feels too full suddenly and he has to swallow to keep his emotions and his speech in check. “It’s just actually helping him that’s the hard part.”
Sing? Draco doesn’t sing. Well, he does and he’s been told that he can, but he doesn’t do it for anyone other than Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy. And then that’s only in the safety of their home. With the windows drawn. And with a very strong
Draco resists the urge to roll his eyes. He was married to the same woman he shagged in school for Merlin sake, what did he know about dating with a child? Better yet, what did he know about dating blokes with a kid? Not shite, he assumed. He wasn’t so desperate that he was willing to chat up a bloke who married his Hogwarts sweetheart.
Had he not wanted this so badly, Draco would have hexed Harry for mentioning the Weasel when he’s preparing to get fucked on his desk. He’ll put it on his to-do list.
His voice is gruff, and almost bitter-sounding but then those dimples flash again and Draco feels his stomach flip.
“I’ll ferret it out of you eventually,” he teases, his voice catching at the end as if he was regretting bringing up their shared memory of what Draco still deems as the most embarrassing moment of his life. Besides having an entire conversation with Potter and Ana with his fly down.
Lying on his back, he uses his lit wand to trace the outline of Aquarius, his mind as cloudy as the white puffs he exhales. Against the black night, the contrast is especially distinct, the stars fading away underneath the smoke.
He finds that he needs eye contact during sex, another peculiarity gifted to him by his ex-wife. It’s not so bad, because he really liked seeing those moments when Harry’s jaw tightens under his beard as he tries not to come, or the ripple of his shoulder muscles as he thrusts deeper into him.
He still feels the heat of Draco’s soft lips on his nose long after he’s scurried down the tree and headed back towards the castle.
Ana is locking up her classroom for the day when they exit the room, hand in hand. Her smile is wider than usual, and she’s eyeing the bouquet, looking almost as if someone’s gifted her the cherry blossoms. She wiggles her fingers at them, keys jingling. “Have a good afternoon you two.” A sly wink is sent Harry’s way.
A hand grabs his elbow right before he can walk into the room. “You didn’t hear this from me, but a little doxy told me that Burns will be the first one to speak today. Something about laying down the ground rules before the presentation starts. I would strike then if I were you.” He coughs into his hand. “But again, you didn’t hear this from me.”
His next fear is that it’s Harry coming to tell him that it was over, to enjoy his suffering by himself since that’s clearly what he wants. He didn’t mean to be so harsh to him, but he couldn’t think with him in his ear like that. Couldn’t breathe with him hovering over him and trying to convince him not to be worried for his son.
Harry begins to wave his fingers around and thankfully, Draco stops him just in time before the spell is casted.
Muggle or not, his grandmother would be appalled knowing that Scorpius wasn’t paying due respect to his educator. Narcissa Malfoy felt very strongly about manners.
a sleeping dragon and you’re going to get burned if you’re not careful.” Ron bites his lips in embarrassment. “Besides, Malfoy isn’t even
Her and Potter laugh about some witch that was failing to blend in with Muggles and Draco felt himself slowly melting into a puddle of sappy waxing poetic thoughts that a Hufflepuff wouldn’t poke with a ten foot wand.
Draco bats his hand away from his wand. “Merlin, it’s the bloody cow again.” He stands up dragging a confused Harry with him as they descend back into Draco’s office.
” Draco hisses, not knowing whether to be more appalled that he failed his test or that he was bragging that he failed his test. Draco rubs his temples, his friends laughing away.
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy!” Albus shouts as if he wasn’t a mere two feet away from him. Draco tries not to wince. This kid will never be allowed in Madam Pince’s library if he doesn’t learn how to use his inside voice. “Can you
pure white shirt. Harry’s mouth bobs in mortification when the dark green fabric of a bra shows through his shirt.
Draco laughs, too exhausted to do anything else. “Don’t worry, your cock is safe with me.” He leans his head back into Harry’s shoulder, his exposed neck near his lips. “That is, unless you don’t finish singing for me. I wouldn’t be responsible for whatever she does then.”
“Since I accidentally changed him into a bloody girl.” He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, frustrated that he was wasting precious time with Malfoy’s friends just to see if the git was okay. “Look, he looked awful in class yesterday and he wasn’t in class today. I just wanted to make sure he’s alright. He could be experiencing some type of side effect from the potion.”
Then Astoria, obviously. He can count on his fingers the number of times they had sex, with both of them looking away during and afterwards each time, never talking or really touching more than necessary.
Gasping, Albus raises his hand, shaking it in the air to get his teacher’s attention. Burns keeps talking, glaring at him and too distracted stewing in his anger to notice some of the other students giggling madly at him.
Jaspers, who has never had him willingly give in so easily, beams. He pulls out his tarot cards and taps them with the same spell he uses that Draco now knows it by heart. Draco lets him do his ritual of shuffling the cards for exactly a minute and spreading them in the air with his wand. He wonders if he doesn’t do this at least once a day if he’ll explode.
“Who would have thought?” Weasley scoffs, breaking the building tension. He drags his eyes back and forth between them, looking a bit green under his freckles.
During Potions would have been an excellent moment to speak with him, but Snape, the sodding git, decided that today was the perfect day to do individual assignments instead. So during lecture, Harry watches Malfoy feverishly do his work, Ron watches Harry not do his work, and Neville watches his cauldron explode.
He hears Potter’s breathing next to him when he says, “Scorpius blames himself for our separation. No matter how many times I try to explain to him that none of it was his fault, he just can’t seem to comprehend that when Astoria has made no effort to contact him since we left Paris.”
He’s slowly coming to accept that he’s never going to hear the end of that with him. “Well,” he drawls, curling up in Harry’s side, closing his eyes as the post-sex sleepiness inevitably pulled him in. “I would have to love you
He slouches into his leather chair, the photo of Marcéline clutched in his fingers. He places the framed photo in front of the Milky Way structure that twinkles as it moves about on the magical orbit Draco created.
What if it hasn't been his Dark Mark that’s been holding him back all this time? What if it’s him? What if he’s just simply not good enough, not smart enough, not enough to have his research taken seriously?
“Potter!” He tries to pull away from the tight hug Harry sweeps him into but he holds fast. Fuck, he’s strong. He’ll have to make a rule about no physical displays of affection in front of Weasleys.
With nearly everyone in class now, only a few students were in the Common Room when he entered. He’s hoping that Malfoy’s room wouldn’t be too difficult to find. He knows he has his own private quarters per McGonagall's request, but in the maze of dorms, it would be a bit tricky figuring out which one was his. Harry slinks off to a corner, pressing his head against a dorm door and waiting several minutes before pulling out his map to whisper Malfoy’s name. He almost gives himself away when he laughs aloud. He was leaning on Malfoy’s door.
He places his head on the cool kitchen floor, ignoring the tiny stabs of pain from the bits of stray glass cutting into his skin. Chest still heaving painfully, he grips harder in a fruitless attempt to calm his racing breaths. “Please. Leave.”
Anger has been simmering underneath his skin all day, waiting to be released, thumping hard in his pulse. Draco keeps it contained. Barely.
Hands trail up under his shirt, moving to the buckle of his belt, tugging at the waistband of his pants. “I’m the one under the influence. Don’t you think I should be the scared one?”
“There are so many things about you I love that I’ve lost count,” Draco admits, a welling in his chest that would have felt constricting had it not all been caused by Harry.
But it was far from over. While Hermione was busy hugging Malfoy and with Ron having his back turned, only Harry saw it. Malfoy’s tear-stained face lifts from being buried in Hermione’s robes, and a sly, evil smirk crawls up on his pink lips. Harry growls indignantly. To make matters worse, a hand that was placed on Hermione’s back was now holding a polished middle finger aimed right at Harry. Malfoy sticks his tongue out before pulling away from Hermione.
Unfortunately, his usual sex expert of a gossiping partner and Blaise’s drinking partner is so tired from the baby that she has locked herself in one of the guest rooms for the week, claiming that sleep is the only remedy for her sore nipples and body aches. Unless Voldemort has risen from the dead, she was not to be disturbed.
Potter sighs in his ear. “There’s a Muggle library two blocks on East Cavern. Go in there and ask for Sagitta. She’s one of us so she won’t look at you funny when you ask to be shown how to create an email address.” Draco sucks the inside of his cheeks in annoyance, rolling his eyes. Unsolicited advice was probably his biggest pet peeve and it was just like Potter to give it.
Harry scrambles the eggs a bit too fast, yellow liquid sloshing out of the side of the pan and sizzling as it hits the stove. “Did we not already?”
Harry presses his body closer to Draco’s. Fuck, if he kept moaning his name in his ear like that, this may be over before it even started.
“You spiked them with Veritaserum,” Hermione says. “What exactly were you planning on accomplishing by doing so?”
He was hyper-aware of this additional audience as a wave of nerves fell over him. Damn Potter and his ridiculously adorable kid. Their matching green eyes stared at him eagerly, though Potter was trying and failing to hide his curiosity behind rapid blinking and the drumming of his fingers on his thigh.
Dodging a deadly aimed Bludger, Harry spins off towards the Snitch, face pressed down to the handle of his broom. A familiar sharp pain pricks his arse and he looks back for a fraction of a second, seeing his smirking opponent holding his wand under his shirt sleeve.
Pansy holds out her arms out for Marcéline, cooing at her softly. “I can’t stay for long, it’s time for a certain someone’s nap.” She squishes Marcéline in between them as she kisses him on the cheek. “I love you Draco. Don’t let that woman mess with your head.” With a quick kiss on his other cheek she murmurs, “And check on your boyfriend, I think he may need a hug.”
That night, Draco flips through the pamphlet over and over again in his hands, chewing his lip nervously as he re-reads the same, overly enthusiastic text repeatedly. On the glossy paper, non-moving pictures of Muggle families and satisfied parents with artificial smiles plastered on their faces, are placed strategically around the edges of the pamphlet.
Harry shakes his head vigorously. “No, no I wouldn’t— I wouldn’t do that to you Malfoy.” Malfoy side eyes him and purses his lips. “Really, I wouldn’t. If I wanted to embarrass you I’ll just keep beating you to the Snitch every game. That usually does the trick.”
Ron cocks his head to the side, gazing curiously at Malfoy. “Is it just me or do you look like Malfoy if he had a hot twin sister?” Hermione grumbles irritatedly and tugs Ron away by the back of his shirt collar.
He still thought about the way Malfoy’s body felt pressed against him or the feeling of his breath on his face as he snarled at him. Harry wondered if Malfoy was aware that his new, er…
His mouth leaves a deep, purple bruise on his skin. He sinks lower, purposely letting his words trail over Harry’s spent cock. “I love it, because all you’ve ever needed was one round to put me to sleep too.”
Draco practiced that in the mirror last night and this morning. No parent is ever willing to admit it, but sometimes a rehearsed speech is necessary to stand your ground. He already has a speech planned if he ever catches Scorpius sneaking out of the house and a very good one planned if Merin-forbid he ever says anything derogatory about Muggles or Muggleborns.
No, instead he was put on trial and publicly shamed for it all. In the spirit of saying it like it is, mental health was a joke. Only Hermione seemed to somewhat understand his frustration.
He and Hermione exchange a knowing look. From the way she was eyeing the lemonade, she too knew exactly what was happening.
“This isn’t us, you know? Fancy dinners, sushi, and whatever the hell that is—” he points to a large metal contraception that was glowing rainbow colors several yards away against an empty wall. He scowls. “Seriously, what the hell is that?” The thing was horrifically ugly.
He takes a breath that’s a bit too loud for it to go unnoticed by the rest of the table. Draco’s been trying so hard to control his breathing that it becomes an unnatural endeavor.
“Well that’s just stupid then,” he counters. “You’re from Scorpius’ home right? Then you should be able to be brought for Show and Tell just like anything else. My Dad told me that you can’t discriminate against people.”
” he taps the tip of his nose, “are eccentric.” Draco rolls his eyes, trying to turn his chair away but Harry holds fast, gripping onto the arms with unsurprising strength. He’ll kill him for thumping his nose like a damn rabbit.
“Horny? Yes I am.” She waves her sweaty face. “Whew, my libido has been in overdrive and I swear Draco, if Blaise and his fat cock aren’t here in the next ten seconds, me and this baby will burst. There’s only so many times I can stand humping that pillow.” She points to the silver-fringed pillow he currently had his arm under.
Harry’s mouth drops open in shock at Draco’s easy acceptance. He shifts uncomfortably on a floor that wasn’t really his either, needing for him to speak.
It was completely worth it because Malfoy looks like he’s about to choke on his spit when Harry sticks his tongue into the parted middle of the fruit, slurping licking at the center with as much fervor as Malfoy does sucking that damned sausage every morning.
“What? The period? The tits? The fact that I can’t walk down the hallway without feeling like I’m being stared at?” Harry winces. Malfoy snatches up a piece of candy on the plate of treats Harry brought up and examines the sticked candy closely. “What is this?”
Harry jumps out of his seat when he sees Draco’s distraught face, but he quickly shakes his head to calm him. They weren’t worth it. This wasn’t worth it.
There had been so many times where Draco wanted to give up, to run away and pretend as if he didn’t have a crying bundle of responsibilities too. He made sacrifices, they all did, so why couldn’t Astoria do the same? Why was she always the first to run away and the last to come back?
He nods politely, his throat too closed up to speak without his voice coming out as anything more than a pitiful squeaking sound. It doesn’t seem to matter much anyway, because Kacia speaks enough for the both of them. She rabbits away about her son that was apparently in the same year as Scorpius, about how much fun PTA activities were, and how
The smell of gillyweed on the tips of his fingers grows stronger as a blistering cold gust of wind rushes over his skin. He laughs harder.
With surprisingly little complaint, Harry does as he’s told. Draco’s hand snakes behind him and swats at his crossed legs. “Feet should be flat on the ground as well.” With a grumble, he stomps his both of his feet loudly on the flooring just to annoy him.
He sits the paper down, feeling oddly put off by the subtly ominous reading. He shakes his head and flicks the paper away with a snort. “Whatever, it’s just a stupid reading. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Potter’s throat bobs as he digests what he just said. “It’s a what?” The tickets in his fingers still; his grip around the papers tightening till his nail bed turns a light pink shade that begins to match the hue creeping from under his beard.
“Don’t!” He panicked. Then pauses, realizing that he was very rudely commanding Potter to not come into his own room. Or guest room, he supposes. Draco rubs his forehead. This was just getting worse and worse by the second. “No, just uh, just hold on a second. Please.” He trips over his feet to grab his wand that was laid carefully on the bedside table, right next to a vial of Hangover Potion Potter must have left for him.
Harry crosses his arms over his chest, glowering. “There isn’t, but to Burns there is. He came up to me this morning and told me that he was promoting deviant behaviors with his comment. Worst of all, he took it out on Al and made him write a two page long paper on why the nature of his comment was unacceptable.”
Blaise takes a deep breath, setting his own glass down and sitting straighter in his seat. “First off: rude. Second, if it’s about Pansy and I’s side pieces, just know we have both agreed—”
“And before you ask, it’s not like that anymore,” Harry assures him though it doesn’t do much good. “There are times, I’ll admit, but all I would ask is for you to not mention Aurors. Ron knows this too. Crazy enough, learning that I had PTSD was just about as traumatic as dealing with it.”
He shakes his head again. “No, I just thought they were just really good friends,” he admits. Now that he thought about it, they were awfully handsy with each other…
She nods to him in acknowledgment, watching him slowly peel potatoes so that he wouldn’t be obligated to join the pack of laughing extroverts. He nods back, watching her bury shaking fingers in her daughter’s hair.
“You know, I thought Harry had gone barking mad when he said that he was teaching your son,” Ron recounts through a mouth stuffed full of the fancy little appetizers the waitress sat in front of them. “Still think he is.”
He could feel the swelling orgasm in the junction of his thighs and he knew he was nearing closer to the edge too. “Look at me.” Draco’s hand finds its way into the short curls at the back of Harry’s head. He tugs at the hairs, willing him to open his closed eyes and look. “
“Pansy! Will you shut the—” He coughs, noticing Marcéline in Pansy’s arms. “...heck up.” Bloody hell, Pansy knew exactly how to tame him.
This would be the millionth fucking time he’s had to explain it. “It’s an amulet. To protect you from negative spirits for tomorrow’s Supermoon. It’s a proven fact that the first Supermoon of the year is a powerful conductor of negativity. You all should be grateful, everyone in this room I care about enough to brew and give one of these to. Pansy, Blaise, and my mother already have theirs from previous years. And yes, they all will be wearing it, as will you all.” Even little Marcéline has one, wrapped around her chubby ankle.
“You never mean to do anything Potter,” he growls. “Watch out, Snape isn’t here to clean up your bloody messes anymore.”
“What I’m about to do is mimic the gravitational pull of a Full Moon in this room,” Draco informs him. “The tides are the highest then and the stability of your magic will be affected as well.”
Blonde hair is flipped over her shoulder and she turns to glance at Harry speaking with Boot. “Harry always looks so happy,” Kacia sighs, “I wonder what it would take to make a man like that upset.”
Like he hasn’t heard that one before. Blaise was convinced that Marcéline hated his guts just because he can’t make her laugh. He waves him off. “All kids hate their parents for something and all parents hate something about their kids. Take Scorpius and I for example,” Draco says, stopping them and dragging Scorpius away from the caterpillar and closer to him. He pats him on the head lovingly. “Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy is possibly the biggest smartarse I have ever met and he is only ten years old; definitely a 0 out of 10 rating.”
“Can I go to bed now? All this spaghetti is making me queasy.” Scorpius pouts ridiculously and rubs his tummy for added flair of dramatics that he had mostly definitely
He turns for the door, making sure his braid whips Potter in the chest as he does. The classroom door slams behind him, Potter’s name tag on the polished wood shattering into hundreds of tiny pieces from the force of his unbalanced magic.
show Dad how to properly sing?” A smug grin appears on his face, an unusual sight with his easy-going demeanor. “You did promise me, remember?”
“You can control a broom with your own two hands,” Draco counters, still squirming in his seat as the ride takes them higher and higher into the fridge air. “If that kid in the box is the one controlling this thing, then we’re all more screwed than we think.”
“Oi! I’m no expert but I’m also not completely oblivious you know. I did have a girlfriend once.” Malfoy sneers at the mention of Ginny. “And you’re lucky I did because whenever she got her period I went to Madam Pomfrey to get a special potion for her.” He continues rubbing circles on Malfoy’s back and feels some of the tension in his muscles slowly relax.
Suddenly nervous that Scorpius might rat him out unintentionally, Draco suggests in an overly enthusiastic tone, “Hey Scorpius, why don’t you go get Princess to show to Aunt Pansy?” That is if he was still alive. Who knows, that spaghetti could have done him in.
There’s a pause, the liquor in Blaise’s drink stilling. Then he’s laughing so loudly that he risks waking Pansy up with his cackling. “
“I guess he internalized that… and the fact that I avoided them. I never really knew how he was feeling until Ginny and I separated. Since then he’s… well you know. He has a tendency not to say what he’s feeling. It’s my fault, I know it’s my fault.”
And yet, like the hapless fool he was, the first page Draco flips to every morning is the horoscope one.
Draco’s about to joke that after Molly Weasley met his son, he would be surprised he doesn’t already have a jumper waiting for him when someone calls Scorpius’ name behind them. All four of them turn to see a breathless Astoria running towards them on the platform.
There’s a sharp intake of breath. Then Ginevra is laughing, sounding much like Pansy after she’s had one too many mimosas.
I might add, just because she is wearing a short skirt?!” Harry groans. Fuck, now he’s got Hermione defending the poncy git.
Scorpius sniffs out, “It was alright. No one believed me though when I told them about your job. They thought I was fibbing.”
There was some swanky prize for the child but Draco didn’t care about that, no, he cared about securing the bragging rights. Winning against Potter was a prize in and of itself.
Draco nods, too sick to give in to the urge to roll his eyes at the pun. Dad jokes. The one thing he was proud of not mastering. “I’m fine. I’ll see you in an hour.” He calls out a goodbye to Scorpius though he doubts he heard it running away from a waddling Pansy.
Malfoy groans into his hands. “Some people I didn’t expect anything less from, like Blaise. That man would fuck a half-dead werewolf if he could. He was always a bit sleazy, to say the least, so it’s no surprise that he’s been staring at my arse like the sun shines out of it.” Harry snorts. “But Merlin,
He should tell Pansy and Blaise. He should, but the only person he can think of to warn first is Harry. Racing to the fireplace in his office, he watches the flames turn green, waiting anxiously for Harry to notice him in the fire.
It must be nice, being a moth. Having no worries except for finding the light in pitch darkness. Such a simple, elementary task to be given.
He shrugs. A free orange. “Thanks.” Ron crinkles his nose at him and scoots his seat away, murmuring about how not even
Draco clings to the bottle of Firewhiskey he drunkenly nicked from the restaurant, keeping it close to his heart as he wandered around Diagon Alley. It always looked like Christmas around here, even though it was the middle of October and the air was still shimmering with the last tendrils of autumn’s warmth. The lights twinkled beautifully against the black night and he wonders why he ever chose to leave this place? Regardless of his former father-in-law’s demands and the well-deserved loathing he had accumulated from his past, Draco couldn’t think of anywhere he’d rather be but here. Diagon Alley was still as perfectly imperfect as it was in his youth.
A tall, plump woman is exiting room 3326, getting her small children in a straight line before releasing them out into the hallway. She’s pretty, with sleek auburn hair, a faint blush on her rounded cheeks, and a yellow sundress brushing past her ankles.
It was all too confusing and Harry really didn’t want to have an in-depth analysis of his sexuality in the middle of the library with Ron by his side, so he pushes it off for something to think about later. Maybe during his nightly session of wanking to faceless blonde beauties.
how Potter gave prep-talks? Merlin, he already knew this, but Gryffindors really did have no sense of tact about them.
Unfortunately for him, Malfoy remembers. His silver eyes widen at the incoming fist aimed at the pointy tip of his nose and he lets out a high pitched scream for help.
It’s only when he wakes up late that evening, brushing the hair out of his eyes when he sees it in the bathroom mirror.
“Sensitive,” Draco finishes for him coolly. He didn’t have all day to listen to Potter’s ramblings about his son’s secretly delicate nature—something that he was already acutely aware of. Perturbed, Potter’s eyes stay fixed on the gold buttons on Draco’s Muggle shirt rather than his face.
Two weeks before the first of September, Draco owled a letter to Astoria in the dead of night, unable to rest when he remembered that they would be standing on the platform of 9 ¾ in less than a moon cycle. The first time a child leaves for Hogwarts is special, and if she was actually serious about mending her relationship with Scorpius, he won’t deny Astoria the joy of seeing him off.
The teenage girl behind the glass ice cream counter blows her blue gum, letting it pop loudly in his face. “Sir, it’s the middle of January.”
His nights were spent stroking himself into oblivion, his libido worse than Pansy’s every time he laid down to sleep.
Harry’s cock was wonderfully thick and heavy in his hands and he moaned appreciatively at the thought of it inside him. Or Draco inside of him. He doesn’t think he cared either way as long as
Harry winces, already envisioning the blowback of what he was about to ask for. “Okay, just hear me out but I need a really big favor from you.” He waits for her reaction but she only gives him a bored blink. Here goes nothing. “I need the Slytherin password.”
“Thank you anyway. It’s funny, now that you’re telling me this, I wonder if the key to fixing my marriage was my singing,” he blurts out, his voice too low for it to be taken as a joke. He doesn’t know why he cocked the conversation up by bringing his ex-wife up but he did. It was even more ludicrous seeing that he knows the true reasons for why he divorced her and it’s certainly not because he didn’t sing stupid songs for her.
Malfoy laughs lightly, the sound pleasant and dainty— two things Harry never thought he would associate with him. “Salazar no, you raging beast. It’s about a guy that I
Soft voices float from the drawing room. He follows them, walking on silent footfalls through the art-filled corridor. Past a nook in the study—that’s where he developed his first hypothesis. Past the kitchen—that’s where he and Scorpius sat alone most nights.
“James,” Ginny says to the scowling boy, “this is your father’s boyfriend Mr. Malfoy and his son, Scorpius. They are very excited to meet you.” There’s a strange glint in her eye and the infliction of her tone goes up one octave as she speaks to James. Draco has a feeling that if this goes sour, Ginny Weasley may awaken the pits of Hell with her fury.
“I wasn’t snogging anybody,” he clears up. The thought of snogging a Slytherin, let alone Slytherin Prefect Draco Malfoy…
I don't know if anyone here watches She-Ra and the Princess of Powers... but I just finished binge-watching the last season and I think I'm dying??? But like, in a good way??
Draco instinctively reaches for Scorpius’ hand and pulls him close, only to realize that there was no danger, just a Gryffindor bastard and his spawn in his presence.
Draco lowers his eyes. “Then make something up.” Scorpius pouts and he waves him off. “Go on, scram.”
Like a bird ready to take flight, Draco leans forward on his feet, eager to get started. “Yes! Yes whatever it is, I’ll do it.” Dangerous to say, but Draco really would do anything if it was for Scorpius.
. When he catches up to him, he notices that he was limping, possibly due to the small fall he took.
It’s freezing on his roof, but Draco would rather deal with the piercing winter winds than return to his office. It’s the only place he can think clearly these days.
“I want the edge seat!” Lily exclaims when they’re let in, pushing past the two of them to get to the furthest right. Draco gets in last, with Potter in between them. He groans. This ride better be short. There’s only so long he can manage to be this close to Not-An-Auror Potter’s body without thinking unsafe thoughts.
Draco takes another swing, savoring in the burn it produces in his throat and chest. He has the right to be mad. This was the product of the life his father envisioned for him twelve years ago.
James sidesteps him and heads upstairs to his room, outright ignoring Harry in a way that Draco was never able to master with Jaspers. Draco winces. So maybe he might see what Harry means. But that doesn’t mean he hates him. No, it was just a rebellious teen phase; they’ve all had one of those, and Draco was no stranger to disliking his father. At least Harry hadn’t groomed him to be a blood supremacist and auctioned him off to do the dirty work for a deranged dark wizard.
something out of the living room. “Hey arsehole,” Blaise murmurs, shoving a soft, Slytherin green blanket in Draco’s face, “You know you can talk to me right? I won’t judge you Draco.”
His quill snaps as well, theatrically splattering droplets of ink on his nearly done essay and scuffed library floors. Hermione gasps— whether from his shift in demeanor or from her concern for the Hogwarts library’s precious already-ink-stained floors, Harry didn’t know nor care. What he did know was that Malfoy was entering into the library, his face set into an impassioned expression as he strolls through a throng of weary-eyed Eighth Year Ravenclaws.
It was embarrassing. He had separation anxiety worse than a young crup, all because of Astoria’s carelessness. But no matter how much he tries to trick his mind into thinking that it would never happen again, that Scorpius is safe, that moment never seems to quite leave his memories.
Scorpius gasps, sitting up from his lying position and nearly crawling into the flames from fright. “Dad! What are you—”
August arrives and the weekends are spent in Diagon Alley, slowly accumulating the necessary items needed for Albus and Scorpius. Hermione and Ron tag along several times, bringing their oldest Rose along with them.
From the corner of his eyes he sees his neighbor Miss Norrison staring at him with wide eyes as she waters her grass with one of those long snake-like things.
Draco sighs, a wave of nausea hitting him from nowhere. He really, really should have taken that potion. “Well I’m glad you three are having fun. I’ll Floo over to get him in an hour.”
Unfortunately, Harry has dodged every single one of Draco’s advances, and he's now wondering if his fantasy is nothing more than that. A fantasy.
His throat goes dry. Draco knew that his son was privy to his weaker moments, but he didn’t know that it had affected him quite like this.
“Harry, you’ll tell us if something was going on right?” Hermione asks, her voice laced with concern but her face still in the same disgusted expression as before.
So instead they both opt to eat in silence. Draco, neatly eating his sushi with his chopsticks and Harry fumbling with the two sticks like a five year old. His fingers do an odd little dance as he tries to organize them into a suitable position.
Ana pulls him out of his staring with a polite cough. “If you don’t mind me asking, why did you choose to enroll Scorpius into Brookington?”
A bouquet of gorgeous light pink flowers is placed under his nose with a bright smile to accompany it.
“Please don’t,” he growls, holding a hand out in warning. “You’re welcome Potter, but next time you ambush me like that you’ll have balls for teeth.”
“I was finishing the last of the papers that day when Al fell out of the tree.” So that’s what Ana was referring to being a shame. Draco sniffs. Interesting. “But it’s done now, obviously, since I tried and failed to ask you out on the ferris wheel.” He hits his forehead with his palms in embarrassment. “Don’t tell anybody about that, will you? It’s not one of my finest moments.”
want to punch you? You’re such a prat you know that? Hell, not even your own bloody friends want to look after you; honestly, I don’t blame them. How they can stand being around someone as insufferable as you is beyond—”
Potter leans back and barks out a laugh, playfully clapping him on the back and breaking the spell. “You are a complete nutter Malfoy. Come on, there’s a Pygmy Puff fashion show happening soon; if we hurry we may just get the best seats.”
He crumples the letter in his fist after the word obligation. In the years since he stood on trial, Draco’s come to detest that word. Obligation. He has an obligation to no one but Scorpius. Draco vividly remembers how his father used to hold that word over his head, used it to twist and bend him into doing unspeakable things, cause irreparable harm, damage his skin for a cause he groomed him for.
He yanks Scorpius near him when a young man nearly knocks him over as he flies by in one of those skating machines. He’s got half a mind to hex the idiot, but one elder lady scolds the rider loudly on his behalf. Draco hurriedly drags Scorpius along, wanting nothing more than to go back to the peaceful stillness of the wizarding world. Though he doesn’t hate them, Draco certainly hates how
Harry squirms at the pressure, clinging onto Draco’s narrow shoulders and silently worrying that his weight was too much to bear and that he may accidentally drop him in the middle of the dance floor in front of the gaping students that are trying their hardest not to stare at the odd couple.
They stop moving, Hermione’s fingers clenching tightly around her empty wine stem and the last bit of food Ron was about to stuff his face with stopping midway on its journey to his mouth. Harry tenses next to him.
in his own home. His walls weren’t light blue, they were cream. And his bed smelled like the vanilla wash he used, not like Potter’s woodsy scented cologne.
He doesn’t quite fancy the idea of placing the first photo of his goddaughter in the middle of a bunch of nonsensical looking calculations either.
, but how can it just be so easy for him? Harry and Ginevra’s simple divorce made his sound like hell itself. Can it really be so simple? That easy?
Scorpius and Draco look at the overcooked noodles on their plates with similar mournful expressions. Scorpius hasn’t even lifted his fork, staring at the hard, tasteless noodles with a mixture of repugnance and longing for a better meal to be magically placed in front of him. Draco, who had attempted to lead by example, ate exactly one noodle and immediately regretted it. It took every ounce of Charm School ingrained dinner etiquette not to spit it into his napkin and
Draco’s breath hitches. With all of the disappointment from today, he had forgotten that it was the first day of spring. His favorite season. How Harry knows this or had known to get his favorite flowers is a mystery his brain can’t work out. His breath audibly catches in his throat once more.
Ginny sighs, negating her anger to reach out and card a hand through James’ hair. “Oh sweetie, I left your father. It was a mutual agreement. I can’t help that I love Luna more than he can help that he loves Draco.” He wrangles himself from out of her reach, his piercing glare still fixed on Harry from across the table.
He mutters wonderingly under his breath, utterly perplexed by this new development in his son’s life. How, between focusing on work and worrying about Scorpius’s adjustments, had he overlooked the fact that he managed to make a new friend? In less than a week nonetheless.
He yanks at his shirt collar, dragging his face down to his. “I don’t have a kink for people singing. I have a kink for
Draco turns around, his now loose braid whipping him in the face as he does. Potter’s pressed up against the frame of the door, looking absolutely petrified of the man standing in front of him.
Yet, like a fool, he attempts to do so anyway the first night, admittingly too prideful for his own good. Despite Harry's insistence that Draco stay the night, he stayed locked away in his bedroom, riding out two panic attacks by himself and a long crying fit Draco vowed he would take to his grave before sharing with another living soul.
of your assignments.” She looks at him from underneath her glasses. “Furthermore, if I hear of any more bickering, you will be serving detention right alongside Mr. Potter. Do I make myself clear?” She eyes them both.
Instinctually, Draco twists his nose up, remembering why it is that Harry used to bug the shite out of him.
With a gentle push, he shoves the ice cream aside. He really shouldn’t have gotten every flavor. “We ought to get going then, right Potter?”
Draco shrugs, feigning nonchalance. He tugs at Harry’s bow tie, his long fingers fiddling gently with the crisp loop in the fabric. “Just a personal experiment of mine. I want to see if I can make you look as hot and bothered on my knees as I do at breakfast.”
“Are you wearing makeup?” He can’t help but grin. “Geez, you only have a girl’s body Malfoy. You don’t have to act the part as well.” Despite his jibing, he won’t deny that it looks good—that he looks good. Unlike the heavy makeup some of the older girls liked to wear, Malfoy’s was light and subtle, applied with an expert hand and complementing his admittingly pretty features. His already high cheekbones glittered from the combination of dusted gold and sunlight pouring in from the windows. He bets that if he saw him now, Colin Creevey would be salivating at a chance to take a picture of him.
It’s dark when Harry Floos into his home that night. Scorpius went to bed immediately afterwards, too stuffed from Molly’s fruit cake and melodrama to want to do anything other than sleep. She pointedly gave him and Draco the biggest pieces, her eyes gazing sympathetically at them. He could hear the three going at it up in James’ room as they ate, Ginny’s brash voice breaking through the Silencing charm.
The house was becoming increasingly crowded as more members filtered in. George Weasley with his pretty wife in one hand and a rowdy child in the other. Bill, who doesn’t greet Draco directly but nods in his and Harry’s direction. With all of his carrots cut, Draco doesn’t have anything to keep him occupied enough to ignore Teddy’s blue hair changing to a bright platinum blond.
Draco places Harry’s necklace on for him, adjusting the crystallized amulet so that it sits at the center of his chest. It glows bright pink when it touches his skin and Draco places a discreet kiss on it because an extra bit of protection never hurt anybody.
Draco cranes his head back. Did this kid not know how to take offense to anything? Not even a thousand shouting jarverys could sour his mood.
On the third day, Malfoy simply snatches the plate of chocolates and lollipops out of Harry’s hand and shows him a book Parkinson had nicked from the library about the family tree of Knotgrass, which, ironically enough, included Goosegrass. He talks further about how both kinds of grass can be used interchangeably in potions work, but Knotgrass tends to be more reactive when included in healing potions.
A spark of heat burns a hole through Draco’s heart; Potter’s presence and attractiveness having everything to do with it.
knew you were a sodding ponce in school,” Harry reminisces matter-of-factly. “It’s not that hard to figure out.”
The bell rings, signifying a new day, a fresh beginning. The dark hair child per usual races into the building, only this time he’s followed by a smaller, red-haired girl attempting to keep up with him on stubby legs.
Scorpius cackles, pushing up his glasses with his finger. “And my dad is the worst cook in the world. He couldn’t make a glass of water without needing the help of a house-elf. He’s what my Uncle Blaise calls, and I quote,
“Ugh, Potter!” Thick, black hair tickles his cheeks and he ends up with a mouthful of the stuff. His strong arms squeeze tighter around his body. He pushes him away the second Potter relinquishes his grip on him. Draco fusses over his clothes and hair, scoffing at the audacity of his son’s teacher.
She looks up from slicing the fruit cake. “Oh, I didn’t make it, George did.” She pats George on the cheek as he hands her a glass, taking a sip to see what the fuss was about.
Harry’s shoulders slump. “Ron and Hermione aren’t animals, Draco. As long as you don’t provoke them, they won’t be nasty to you.”
Draco grips his side of the cart when it begins to suddenly move. As he watches over the side, he wonders how many ways it was possible for a person to die on a ferris wheel. Potter grabs his hair, tugging gently at the braid. “You alright there, Malfoy?”
“I don’t believe you and I don’t believe I deserve to be forgiven,” Malfoy says at last. He gives him a watery smile. “But thank you.”
Looking at them both with gleaming eyes, Ana makes a funny sound, clearly wanting to press for more information. She turns to Scorpius when he conveniently increases the volume of his apologies to discontinue her prodding. Salazar, this boy was made for Slytherin. Draco holds him tighter. Ana rubs his back. “Oh sweetheart, it’s okay, these things happen sometimes.”
Draco’s mouth drops open and he narrows his eyes. Was it appropriate to strangle someone on the first date or was that something that should wait for the second?
equal causation, he hands them each a document of his past Ministry approved experiments that had similar results as this one.
They’ll probably never get it just right, but it doesn’t matter much. Sex is so much more than it’s ending when you’re doing it with a person who you actually care for. A relationship doesn’t always have to feel like a trap. Who would have known that the antidote for his past lied in Harry Potter’s calloused hands?
When she points a ringed finger to the dark-haired boy that had rushed by them, that wry smile is fully formed on her lips.
He sneers, “It’s not that big of a deal Granger.” She cocks her head, smiling. “Weasley,” he tries again, spitting it out with as much vitriol as he can manage. The grin widens and she places her hands on her hips. He sighs. Bloody hell. “Hermione,” he grits out through clenched teeth.
He huffs, feeling himself unclench. If that wasn’t the truth. “I’m sorry.” Draco looks away at the crystallized antique vase on the fireplace mantle. Bitterly he adds, “You’re right anyway.”
Yet, he’s surprised to find that he doesn’t quite mind it all that much. Well, that wasn’t entirely true. He does mind, but his sodding nerves made it possible for him to care.
He begins to sing about a moon painting over the sea and the wonders of miracles—quite a fitting song for an astronomer. It was Scorpius’ favorite song; a duet from a Muggle play Draco had taken him to see when they first moved to London.
When he doesn’t move, Potter takes it upon himself to heave Draco off the ground and onto his feet. Though when he tries to walk on his own, he nearly ends up falling flat on his face and into the gravel ocean below.
“Yeah, yeah Dad, I know. Equo-nixon, pretty constellation, and half-eaten cookie moon shapes.” Draco rolled his eyes. It was starting to become apparent to him that maybe, just maybe, Scorpius is secretly faking his interest in astronomy for his benefit. “All of that is great and all, but I’m asking if
“Draco… Draco,” Blaise says calmly, breathing in and out demonstratively to soothe Draco’s nerves. “Take a breath.” He does, feeling no better than he did before. Why does his heart pound and his hands shake over even the simplest of things? Must be the liquor. “Now tell me in plain words what the issue is. Keyword:
“I think it’s best just to wait until he leaves for Hogwarts, yeah?” He points his own wand to the pile of ash and Vanishes it away with several flicks, the only evidence of Draco’s fury being the smoking, burnt grass underneath.
He groans at the last part, cringing as embarrassment washes over him from the tips of his toes to his disgusted scowl. “I’m sorry,” he croaks out. Even after Hogwarts he still found new ways to torture her.
His Glamour doesn’t conceal the wrinkles around his mouth as he scowls. “You cannot legally keep Astoria away from her own child, no more than she can from you.”
Draco snaps his body away, the biting cold rushing between them. His mouth hangs agape in shock despite the innocent look on his son’s face. That was
Pansy holds out her hand. “Come here. Come on now.” She wiggles her hand impatiently and he entwines her swollen fingers with his. “Draco, I want you to stop thinking that you owe her anything.
This is far from over with him, but for now, Draco can breathe a little easier knowing that he could continue to keep Scorpius far away from Finley's claws.
Scorpius deflates. “See ya later Al.” The flames turn orange again with a snap. Scorpius stands up, swaying nervously on his feet, standing in Draco’s looming shadow. “Yes Dad?”
Ginny and Luna make their rounds greeting everyone, with James sulking off to a corner far away from Harry and Draco. Ginny kisses Harry on the cheek, and Draco damn near cuts himself as he slices a carrot.
“You think I’m irresponsible don’t you?” He hardly sounds threatening given how awfully he slurred the word ‘irresponsible’. But he had a point to make, slurring or not. “Scorpius is with Blaise and Pansy, thank you. I have some sense, y’know. He…” he sighs tiredly. “He doesn’t need to see this,” Draco mutters darkly, lifting the bottle of Firewhiskey to his lips again.
Harry blanches, gagging on the rancid stench coming from the cauldron. His eyes sting from the foul scent and he has to wipe them with his sleeve. Malfoy cackles at his disgust and flees towards the door like the wanker he was.
“Astoria.” Draco swallows some of the bitterness downing his tongue at the feeling of her name in his mouth. “You’re going to lose this fight, regardless of what you or your father do.”
Draco finds himself in the same room he had woken up in that night after his god awful date. He thought he hadn’t been in his room before but he was wrong. Apparently, Harry didn’t just deposit him into a random guest bedroom that night. “Harry, why are you—?”
Draco wonders how long he can keep it together before he finally bursts out into laughter. Potter, crazy, wild-eyed Potter, with pink paint on his cheeks and a stained shirt, was bedazzling the terrifying night when a troll broke into Hogwarts into something acceptable for kids. It’s enough to meet the Ministry of Magic’s standards but not enough for Draco to pick up on the not so subtle hint at who this ‘intelligent, curly-haired princess’ was. He wonders what Granger would think of being called one.
Pansy Parkinson could tell a cat to bark and it would do it. Draco theorized a long time ago that her power didn’t lie in magic, no, it was in persuasion.
Potter takes a long, deep breath, looking up at Draco as if encouraging him to do the same. It was pointless anyhow because when Draco Malfoy had something to say, someone was going to hear it. “Would you like me to owl you every one of my lesson plans so it can have your magical stamp of approval, then?”
But he doesn’t stop here. When a Malfoy has something to say, he says it. “I love that I can trust you with Scorpius. That you bring me flowers and let me pester you about predictions every morning. I love that you can't keep your hands out of my hair.”
“It is pretty bad,” Arthur agrees, his lips looking as though they moved on their own accord. He chokes when he realizes what he said.
Draco snarls, whipping around and successfully hitting Jaspers in the face with his hair from the way he was rubbing his round, pink cheek. He looms over Jaspers, his height and piercing glare speaking for itself. The sunlight coming from the large windows beside them was hurting his eyes, but he didn’t care, his unblinking stare earning him a quiet whimper from Jaspers.
The witch at the reception desk for the Ministry purses her lips at his appearance, too upset by his presence to notice Harry standing behind him. He grabs onto Harry’s sleeve when a sudden bout of worry grips him. “How do I look? Do I look Death Eater-ish? Should I take out my dragon earring?”
Draco drags him up the stairs of the school building and he hears Scorpius scoff loudly behind him. “Oh, so now you’re not afraid to go inside the school?”
, I would pay good money to listen to you sing. Why don’t you share your talent more? I nearly wanked myself raw the first time I heard you sing—goddamnit George!” Mortification spreads across his face as he tells a buried truth that the potion dug out of him. He closes them shut and grimaces.
Harry thinks while shifting uncomfortably in his seat. He takes deep breaths to calm himself when Malfoy’s cheeks hollow out and he genuinely looks to be fucking his mouth with the sausage. Ron stuffs one last roll into his mouth before scampering away. Malfoy bursts out into peals of laughter, his body leaning against Parkinson’s for support as they cackle gleefully together.
Harry’s face turns red. “I, er…” Malfoy cocks his head to the side and raises a delicate brow at him. “Actually yeah you’re right. How does it, you know, feel?”
discussed this Ronald!” She hisses threateningly. Harry’s heart lurches when he sees long blonde hair swing into view, then it subsequently falls when a tanned Hufflepuff turns around.
“And,” he drawled, looking annoyed. “He’s purposefully being suggestive.” He narrows his eyes suspiciously. “You know, you sound a bit possessive of him Harry. Like you don’t want anyone else looking at him.”
“I’m not going to touch you,” Harry promises, his hands held up for Draco to see. He stays back but speaks as if he was directly in his ear. “Breathe Draco. You have to remember to breathe. You’re hyperventilating.”
“You’re more than your mistakes,” says Harry, meaning every word. Though he despised the Mark and nearly all of the people who bore it, it was difficult to despise Malfoy. For better or for worse, Harry knew him, and he knew that on some level, Malfoy was forced into getting it.
He wandlessly recites all of the body protection charms he can remember, keeping a tight hold on the two squirming children until the charms were done to his satisfaction.
“Some days are better than others, Draco. Some months are easier than the next. I don’t want to promise anything I can’t keep. But I’ll try, I’ll try. I can promise that.”
She smirks. “Nice save dumbarse.” She shifts Marcéline in her arms. The little girl was surprisingly calm in the face of her mother’s squawking. Poor baby must be used to it. “I need to talk to you.”
Draco comes to a sudden halt. They were almost at the abandoned Apparition point but he can hardly believe his ears. “Get to know— when did you…?”
Idiots. Every single last one of them. He includes himself in that group as well, seeing that he still holds onto the hope that someone in the Ministry will take a second glance at his research and not dismiss it because of his last name. Draco has enough money as it is. He’s not doing this for galleons, he’s doing this because he’s genuinely intrigued but the celestial patterns and its effects on magic.
He stops a yard away from the small dining table they were stationed at, none of them willing to make the first move towards the other.
Once he was gone, Draco committed himself to not remembering his own name as well. The utter bastard conveniently left him to pay the tab, so nothing was beholding him to order one whiskey after another before finally throwing a cup full of galleons on the table and stumbling out of the ridiculously posh establishment, clenching an unfinished bottle of Firewhiskey in his hand.
Harry obediently stills, looming over Draco with his pulsing, above average cock balls-deep in his arse and staring him as they wait for Draco to adjust. Even now, he is a bloody fidgeter, biting the inside of his cheek, playing with the tail end of his braid, drumming his fingers on his desk.
Potter smirks, one eyebrow raised in that same smug arrogance his wild-haired spawn inherited. “Your fly’s been down this entire time. Maybe fix it when you get a chance, yeah?”
It’s particularly nauseating because astrology actually is a valuable field, especially for Animagus transformations. Yet, people like Jaspers give astrologists a bad rep with his pseudo-astrological predictions and inaccurate research. It’s almost as abhorrent as Muggle magic; Jaspers isn’t even aware of how significant Pluto is in the field, instead discrediting the planet because it’s “too small to matter”.
Temptation tasted sweeter than the peppermint he placed in his palm that day, constantly guiling him into giving in. Doesn’t he know? Doesn’t he see it, feel it? He must, or else he would just leave Draco alone.
Draco’s dealt with far worse, yet no one ever made a fuss about his mental health when he was tasked with killing Dumbledore or made to watch Voldemort torture Muggles or dealt with the death of the man who healed his scarred chest. Yet, everyone has an opinion on what he should do just because his hands shake every once and awhile. It was all so fucked—no one cared when actually traumatizing events occurred in his life.
A voice, deep and familiar seizes his attention like he was just delivered a Stinging Hex on the arse.
Scorpius puts a steady hand over his shaking ones. Even his hands have grown bigger since last year. He wants to hold onto them, grip them, and take him some place where he can’t be hurt by Astoria or circumstance or anyone else that has the potential to harm him.
“Well, er, thanks guys. I can’t believe I’m saying this but I’m glad none of you tried to sabotage my relationship with Draco.”
With a raised brow, Harry leans against his large wooden desk, that fucking shirt working its magic on his body. “Why don’t you come to my desk Malfoy. I’m sure we could come to a conclusion.”
His hands are everywhere, on Draco’s hips, in his hair, on the left side of his breast. Revealing the soft, creamy skin underneath the gorgeous robes was his goal. His hands tug gently at the white bowtie around his neck.
“Obviously,” Blaise continues, “He’s either not as confident as you make him out to be or he’s waiting for you to make the first move so that he doesn’t scare you away. Either way, that means you have to man up or suffer through another ten years of celibacy.”
Harry shakes his head, his mouth not moving an inch at his joke. “No, for just assuming that you would come to dinner without properly asking you. After Ron and Hermione…” They both wince, but Draco squares his shoulders and tries to disregard it, “It’s not right for me to just throw you in situations where you feel uncomfortable. You don’t have to go. I’ll understand.”
“Bugger off Potter,” Malfoy sneers, though with his pouty lips it looked far less menacing than it usually did. Come to think of it, Malfoy kind of always had pretty pouty lips. It must be the hint of lip gloss that made them stand out even more. “You’re not nearly as good at flirting as you think you are. If you think I look good just say it.”
They cross a busy interaction, leading them to the Apparition point behind an abandoned warehouse. Muggles zip past on foot, in cars, on those odd-looking contraptions with two wheels. Despite the whirlwind of energy and movement around him, Draco’s attention remained solely on his son.
“Whatever I want?” Scorpius breathes, disbelieving in his luck. Draco had made a point not to spoil Scorpius in the slightest, for fear that he may grow as entitled as he was as a child. For him to give his son the option to get absolutely anything that he wanted was unheard of.
Malfoy rolls his eyes, a hand on his hip. “Oh please, who needs to be funny when you’re bloody gorgeous? And besides, it’s not my fault your Weasel can’t keep it in his pants for me.”
Her fingers brush through Marcéline’s thick coil of dark curls. A small smirk grows on her face. “Narcissa. We’re gal pals.”
Harry braces a hand on the back of Draco’s seat, his face a mere centimeters away from Draco’s. “Lockhart is a narcissist, Bellatrix was demented, Luna’s quirky, and
Perseus cocks his head. As far as animals go, he was a strong contender as his favorite, along with Princess of course, but Draco never liked how bloody perceptive he was.
Beside him sits four, empty bottles of Firewhiskey, the excess alcohol dripping from the mouth of the small bottles, causing a sticky mess around him. He should get off of the ground, but his drunken, fatigued body won’t cooperate long enough to even move his legs.
Potter crosses his arms over his chest defensively. “Long enough to realize that you were five seconds away from looking like an eccentric nonconformist in front of your son’s Muggle teacher.
His heart lurches. “Of course I do! But it’s not you that’s the problem Scorp. It’s your little snotty-nosed friend that I don’t like. My foot still aches from his hooves digging into it.” Bitterness is laced in his words, the sting in his foot re-emerging at the memory.
He feels a sort of kinship to her. It was overwhelming being surrounded by a congregation of large personalities and fiery energies.
“Draco?” Looking down, he sees the reflective black rim of Harry’s glasses is visible from his spot on the roof. “Draco, where are you?”
Hermione purses her lips together, examining him with a quizzical eye. Draco has never felt more uncomfortable in his life.
She sighs again. “He’s in the middle of a crying fit right now, I’m not asking you to drop everything and come—”
Bloody hell. How could he have missed it?! The green eyes, those rambunctious smiles, the inherent disregard for other people’s feelings. Hell, even his sodding name,
Areum, the Korean woman who Draco first saw endure Kacia’s constant chattering, is possibly the funniest person in this PTA group. The thing is, she hardly ever speaks to anyone but him, but over the weeks they’ve bonded through side eyes and silent yawns.
His body deflates as Draco assesses the situation. “I… haven’t done this in a while,” Harry admits shyly, his face tinted red with embarrassment. The slight tremble in his hands placed everything into context.
Light pink colors Malfoy’s cheeks and his eyes widen in alarm. “Changes? What sort of changes? And why for a month?”
He feels it in the ridge movements of his fingers when he casts a spell, in his legs as he stomps up the stairs into his office, even in his braid, which had been swinging in twitchy whip-like motions all day.
Draco never thought of himself as sad with Astoria before. Mainly numb. And resentful. It was numbness that grew from her apathy and resentment that grew from his anger. If he ever was sad, it was when he realized that Scorpius couldn’t be trusted in the care of his own mother. Even then, he preferred anger over anything.
Given the circumstances, this was the most peaceful Saturday morning he’s had in a very long time. Potter isn’t bad company when he wants to be.
Draco made an alarmed sound, scaring the house-elf Tippy as she took their coats. She scampers away on frantic feet. “Don’t say that!”
The wards let him in and Harry’s there, on the couch in front of the Floo, looking far worse than Draco last seen him.
“I know I said this before but I truly am sorry for fighting you the other day. And for…you know….” He flushes, remembering the embarrassment on Malfoy’s face when he looked down at his soaked shirt.
When he enters into the bright yellow classroom, a group of chattering parents sits in the rows of seats set out for them, looking comfortable with each other and ignoring his presence completely. Draco’s grateful. He doesn’t fancy talking much.
His father’s letter had left him on the edge of snapping all day. He wisely decides to stay away from the Ministry today, knowing that it won’t be pretty for Jaspers when Draco finally loses his composure and verbally tears him a new one.
There’s something beautifully intimate about being able to laugh with a person while you’re both stark naked. Draco begins to care less about orgasming, something that he knew was going to happen anyway, and more about those moments when Harry absentmindedly runs his fingers up and down the expanse of skin. Or those endearingly small moans Harry makes when Draco rides him. Or better yet, the laughs from both of them when Harry tries (and fails) to talk dirty.
Harry watches James as he drags his trunk onto the train, his smile never faltering. “Please tell me I’m not dreaming.”
Sunlight burns Draco’s eyes and he fruitlessly places a hand over them to block it out. Everything hurt. His ribs, his chest, for some odd reason even his arse though he’s certain it hurts from sitting in that uncomfortable restaurant chair and not because he was lucky enough to get any last night. His temples were throbbing and his body ached as if it realized that it was 31 years old and not 21.
The three laugh loudly over some joke Draco wasn’t in on, startling him. Harry explains it in his ear so that he doesn’t feel left out but he couldn’t care less about feeling left out. He wishes he was.
He doesn’t miss the way Malfoy’s eyes light up when he refers to him as a bloke, or the small smile on his face before he snaps the blanket back over his head.
Draco and Areum share an exasperated look as Kacia continues blathering about how unfair her son received detention for chatting in class. Really, it wasn’t that hard to figure out where he got it from.
Ana laughs, clearly finding whatever the hell Potter meant utterly hilarious. Draco grinds his teeth, his body growing hot under his hand. This was
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Semantics.” Thankfully he stops grabbing at his chest and lets his hand fall onto his lap. “Now, as for the period? Pure hell. I mean Merlin, how are people expected to walk around feeling like something is stabbing them in the gut and
He opens his mouth to argue but Scorpius beats him to it. “Remember what you called Mum’s new boyfriend?” Scorpius asks, sounding far too much like a chiding adult in this situation than he cared for. Draco shrugs as if he couldn’t remember what was said when in fact he remembered the exact time and place he rudely referred to Astoria’s new beau. “You called him a cock-eyed bastard.”
Malfoy looks as if he were about to burst a vein in his neck. His hands splay out in an odd fashion and Harry could tell he was itching to wrap them around his throat. “Knotgrass is used for Polyjuice potions you dumbarse!”
was funny. And handsome and had real blonde hair, not that fake stuff. Plus, he wasn’t afraid of a bloke with a child. Why couldn’t he find someone?
The silence is comfortable, both of them watching the children and watching as the minutes on the smiley face clock tick by.
“Because you needed someone to shake some sense into you. This is a good thing. No one’s trying to sabotage you. Sometimes people are just
Harry closes the distance between them, drawing Draco in for a long, languid kiss. He can feel him relaxing with each passing second and the tensed air around them lifts.
Draco runs his hands through his hair, from the crown to his nape, attempting to ease Harry’s growing anxiety lest he blow his house to pieces. He was literally playing with fire by doing this experiment with the most powerful wizard of their time. He needed him to be as calm as possible. Draco can nearly taste the drumming magic vibrating from Harry’s tensed body.
Draco pinches him. Hard. Harry lets out a hissed laugh. It was the truth anyway because if there was one thing Draco loved talking about more than how great his tits looked, it was how perfect his cock was.
“I’m sorry.” His face is pinched as if the effects of the Veritaserum are still coursing through his veins. James runs his hand through his hair much like Harry does, sighing all the way. Sensing a father-son moment about to occur, Draco slowly backs away, preparing to give them their space to talk. “Wait! Mr. Malfoy!”
That smile. It felt all too reminiscent of another smile, pulled at the corners slightly in a ruffled, half-sheepish half-apologetic one. One that he, until very recently, detested. The name lingers in his brain, but Draco finds himself too preoccupied in watching as the boy darts straight towards an equally rambunctious Scorpius. Scorpius welcomes him with an air of familiarity and Draco really wants to know when
Harry pulls him from the door, his mouth still on his. Several child-drawn pictures of a black haired figure with green eyes and brown skin are knocked onto the floor when Harry deposits him on the desk, along with a note that reads ‘I Love You Mr. Porter!’ enclosed in pink hearts. Draco’s hands trace over the fine grain wood, the tiny grooves of the desk digging into his fingertips. Harry’s mouth sucks at the base of his neck, down his collarbone and right along the top of his jugular.
“Draco, I will give you Albus and one hundred galleons for Scorpius,” Ginny groans as they enter the platform, looking at Scorpius’ neatly packed trunk and school items enviously.
“Alright, so no talk of your father,” Jaspers says good-naturedly, holding up his hands as if Draco was a predator readying to attack. “Got it.” He follows him when Draco steps into the room.
The leg swings in response. A flash of a green skirt comes with it. That was Malfoy alright. He had a birthmark the shape of France on the juncture of his right knee.
the arrogant, fox-faced, and King of Sneers Slytherin, was attractive. Whether he was in a male or female body.
“Shove it, Potter. For whatever reason, Pureblood children were expected to be proficient in some aspect of music. I choose to sing and although she’ll deny it to the end of time, Pansy is quite excellent at the harp.” Looking back on it, Charm School was truly an odd place, even odder when he realizes that he hadn’t learned about fascinating subjects like Scorpius is now. Like photosynthesis.
“I…” his voice cracks pathetically as he enlarges the green dragon with a tap of his trembling wand. “I brought you this.” The downy fuzz on the dragon is splotchy and wet from his tears. “I don’t know, I just thought…”
He swallows nervously. Why does Potter do things like this? Touch his hair, touch his hand, compliment him about his voice? Blaise didn’t act like this nor has any straight man Draco’s ever known. He untangles their fingers, placing his hand out of reach under his thigh.
Draco can tell they’re trying their hardest not to let their eyes linger doubtfully for too long. He bets if they shift their perspective just a degree differently, they’ll see Harry and Draco, not Potter and Malfoy in front of them.
He and Scorpius spent their first Christmas from Paris tip-toeing around the fact that they were missing another person of their family this year. Somehow, their unwritten rule to not sugarcoat anything falls flat when it comes to Astoria. She is the exception to everything.
He takes that breath Potter subtly suggested, breathing in the smell of Autumn air, dying things, and the remnants of Harry Potter’s terrified soul that he held mere centimeters from his wand. Draco pats his son’s cheek with a smile.
Harry runs a hand through his hair. “Bloody hell. We’ve just been caught by the world’s biggest tattletale.”
He waves at Draco, his little smile remelting his heart. “Hi Dad! Is everything okay?” He’s clutching the green stuffed dragon Draco once had as a kid in his arms, the head of it pressed close to his cheek.
is what I look like when I am angry and I am so bloody angry Draco I could—” His hands ball into fists and Draco calmly places his own on top of them. An opened door across from them slams shut on its own accord and Draco squeezes harder. Thank God it wasn’t the Summer Equinox yet.
Scorpius rolls his eyes, that Astoria-like cross expression appearing on his face. “You don’t have to trick me anymore Dad, just say that you want to talk to Aunt Pansy in private.” He turns and heads up to his room.
Draco feels his heart being crushed into pieces as Scorpius buries his face further into his chest, bawling. He hated when his son cried. He never stopped him from doing so, like his father always forced him to, but it always made him feel like he was failing. Since he divorced Astoria, each time Scorpius cried he was reminded of her last words before they left.
“Here,” Pansy shoves an old, dusted book his way. Draco gingerly takes it, feeling it’s weight and glancing at the cover to make sure that this was the one. The title,
Mrs. Lellory gives Draco a strange look. Draco pats Scorpius’ head a bit too forcefully, ignoring his son’s hissed ‘
Potter is on Draco’s tail, an arm positioned behind his body in case he takes a turn for the worst. It takes everything in his inebriated mind not to throw his leg out behind him and kick Potter away. “I’m not pretending, I do care about Scorpius,” his eyes flash, “And you, even though you’re a right prick to me most of the time.”
He waves him off. “I know. But let me just show you. And if I prove myself to you, then I believe I’ll be in for some recompensation.” He cocks his head upwards. “Please?”
dad. Not mine.” He pokes Potter’s chest accusingly. He knows he probably reeks of Firewhiskey and unresolved horniness from tonight’s failed date. Maybe if Potter wasn’t so bloody noble he’ll take Draco back to his place and shag him silly.
illuminated the hard lines of Potter’s impassive face, contributing further to the feeling that he was his superior. The pink, glowing words
He runs through a list of possible visitors in his mind. His mother. Theodore Nott to explain why he left for Belgium the morning after he took his virginity. Ron Weasley, to hex him senseless for carelessly burning his last chance. His father, after escaping his cell in Azkaban just to berate Draco for introducing his son to filthy Muggle lifestyles.
His anger is quickly replaced with remorse. “I’m sorry,” he repeats, because he doesn’t quite know what else to say to him. He wasn’t Astoria, so he can’t exactly answer all of Scorpius’ questions about his mother, but he can apologize for her inaction.
Even last week, when Draco had purposefully Floo-called him to inform him that Scorpius would be at the Manor for the rest of the day, Harry had only smiled and nodded, changing the subject back whether or not Princess had impregnated Optimus Prime during their last playdate. Draco had scowled into the fire, only half-listening and fuming that he owed Ginny a favor for nothing. She had taken Albus and Lily out for the entire day, in hopes that he may get lucky.
Draco hums again, sliding down the cool glass of a closed broom shop. He was going to have a wicked hangover in the morning if he didn't find a Hangover Potion. There was so much light coming from the shops around him, especially the ones who had taken to using glowing Muggle shop signs charmed into running on magic and not electricity.
Potter saunters up to them, Albus in tow with a wide, giddy smile aimed directly at Scorpius. Scorpius returns it, looking far happier than Draco’s seen him look in quite a long time.
“Really.” He presses a kiss on his lips, the soft familiarity of his mouth not lost on Harry in the slightest. “Now come on, I heard they’re serving sausages for breakfast.”
“I’m fine,” he pants, “I just remembered that I haven’t done this in ten years and there’s a reason why you warned me.” He hisses in pain. “It’s okay though, really.”
has paid him such a genuine compliment. “You nearly chewed my head off two weeks ago and have you noticed that you’re the only parent who consistently attends the PTA meetings?”
Purposely softening his voice, he says, “How about this, I’ll go to Madam Pomfrey and get you the potion. It’ll subdue the cramps for a little while but you’ll have to take it again the next day. And if there’s anything else you need, I’ll try my best to get it for you.”
Scorpius shrugs and kicks a passing rock with his toe. “I dunno, you always stare at him. And he always stares back.”
He’s partially expecting Malfoy to grumble and groan about not wanting to do work in this state, but he actually sits up with excitement; scrambling eagerly for the Potions assignment Snape begrudgingly gave him. His eyes light up when he finally finds it and gives it a brief once over.
Draco leans up against the doorframe, listening to the gentle murmurs of childish conversation and the occasional laugh or two from Scorpius.
He keeps his distance even as Draco sets up the Floo connection, staying several yards away from him and silently moving out of his way when he leaves to return to his office.
He still hasn’t forgiven his father for burning his copy in front of him when he found out he had read it.
The waitress comes by to refill his water for the fourth time. “Merlin Malfoy,” Ron mutters, cutting Hermione off mid-soliloquy, “thirsty much?”
“Not my fault you’re a sexual deviant.” Draco fixes his clothes back into their proper position. He’s always having to do that around him. “And I think I’m a bit too old for surprises.”
Harry leans back, perplexed. Sure Malfoy was always pretty unpleasant, but today it seems as if he had a genuine reason to be an arsehole. What that reason was Harry didn’t know.
They’ve only been here for thirty minutes, Harry reminds himself. Only thirty minutes. But Merlin, he doesn’t know if he can make it five more minutes before he jumps Draco in front of everyone.
Covering a hand over his face, Draco groans shamefully. He really needed to watch his mouth around Scorpius, the sodding kid absorbed everything like a sponge. To end the conversation, he uses the oldest trick in the book of parenting: deflection.
Wind replaces the everyday chattering of Hogwarts students, the smell of old parchment paper that is abundant in the castle is replaced by the crisp scents of winter begging to reclaim its ascendancy. The Snitch is his professor and him, the ever-eager pupil.
Wand drawn and a hex ready to fly on his lips, Draco throws open his door only to have his wand aimed at… Princess?
Ron gasps and the two go at it, bickering between themselves with a lightheartedness that Draco hadn’t expected from them. Harry watches, a smile on his face as he leans over to whisper in Draco’s ear. “Are you okay?” He eyes Draco’s untouched soup with worried eyes, his smile faltering.
Her voice is obscenely rough, like she smoked a pack of cigs a day and then some. Or like the churning rocks on gravel. He’d never thought he’d meet someone whose voice was worse than Madam Pince’s shrill squawking. Thankfully she doesn’t speak further, with Draco assuming he’s dismissed when she buries her nose back in the novel, disregarding him even when he bids her a good day.
Draco grunts from the sharp pain, grinding his teeth and hissing obscenities under his breath. Ana chides him with a stern mouth, reminding him that some point system was still in effect regardless that it was the end of the day, but the child only flashes her a brief, apologetic smile as he plunges through the metal doors that lead out to the play area.
He knows the tea is probably delicious but that still won’t get her out of his admonishing. “They’re less stressful than my best friend foolishly trying to do work while pregnant.” He takes a sip of the cup. Pomegranate. Damn it to hell, but if she doesn’t know how to win him over so well.
, actually. “Please Harry what do you want? Galleons? Skeeter stepped on? A vile of unicorn blood? I’ll do anything mate, just please
Draco rears his head back in shock. “What?” Why wasn’t he agreeing with him? Why wasn’t he berating him for leaving his son at his friends’ house and stumbling around Diagon Alley pissed out of his mind?
Draco laughed when he pulled out the Draco constellation Harry drew. The thing looked like a crooked sperm for Salazar’s sake. Good god, it was awful. But it was Harry’s and Draco would most definitely be hanging this up on his wall next to Scorpius’ drawings.
Harry sits on the stands, watching as Ron and Dean race each other on their brooms. Seamus sits behind Dean, his arms wrapped around his waist and his head laying on Dean’s shoulder.
Harry sighs, still smiling. “Me too. I don’t want to push you to do anything you don’t want to do.” He lets out a tiny huff in amusement. “That's a thought. Like I could force you to do anything. You’re Draco fucking Malfoy.” He grins approvingly. “But that doesn’t mean that I’m going to stop talking about your anxiety,” Draco rolls his eyes and groans at the word, “So you’re either going to have to listen to me or brush it off.”
They don’t need to be told twice. “Vermin,” he mutters as he watches the two dart off to go to the first horrific looking contraception.
He waits until Scorpius’ eyes are fixed on his plate of food then quickly flips two fingers his way.
Harry Potter was the very last person he would like to get divorced. He had the whole nine— a pretty wife, a nice home, a good job, and better than average kids. Well…the kids part can be debated. But just why? Wasn’t he happy being a part of his best friend’s family? Wasn’t he happy having everything?
Harry is as a President. From across the room, a pair of green eyes watch their interaction, scrutinizing his every action.
“Please don’t throw up on my back,” whimpers Potter. “I’ve had my fair share of that after three children.”
His hands are starting to tremble in anger around his wine glass when he remembers Scorpius’ unwillingness to admit that his mother neglected him for an entire week. After that, he had been so convinced that their divorce was his fault and not Astoria’s for being a neglectful parent. They shake harder and he doesn’t know what to do with the excess emotions. He doesn’t think Harry would appreciate it much if he snapped and starts burning random office items.
“Alright! Good afternoon everyone. If you don’t know already, my name’s Harry Potter and I'll be working as the President of this PTA group.”
The blonde woman smiles down at him, her white, toothy grin too big for her thin lips. “Draco, is it?” He can’t even nod before she is vigorously shaking his hand like he was the Muggle Queen. “I’m Kacia, I didn’t get the chance to introduce myself earlier.”
Potter’s lips thinned into a disappointed line. Whatever, not like he cared. “Pity. I was rather looking forward to it.”
Lily looks ready to burst from excitement as he sings, even mouthing some of the words when he trails off and forgets the lyrics. Albus leans forward, far too close to his face to be socially acceptable. Scorpius looks rather bored, possibly because of his secret hatred for the movie that Lily forced him to watch three times over.
Yet Harry entertains him, nodding and answering all of Boot’s inquiries about a meeting that in Draco’s humble opinion, could have been sent in an email. Or in his case, an owl. Yet Harry’s doing much better with this than Draco was. Perhaps it was all that spoiling from Draco’s youth that was getting to him. When he really wants something, he wants it
He makes his way to the front row of the room, moving carefully through a throng of squirming eleven years olds to where Albus and Scorpius were seated.
With ginger fingers, Potter carefully picks up the paper and eyes it. “It’s last night's homework,” he says, voice treading on the side of caution. “What’s the issue?”
like rollercoasters, but only the ones that are low to the ground and move at a snail's pace. Something called a merry-go-round is her favorite of the twenty they have been to and Draco and Harry are left watching her go on the thing five times over, each time as nauseating as the last.
The kid sounded earnest enough, but he couldn’t give less of a damn. He wasn’t here to discuss his father or make friends, he was here to present his research.
That’s a question that he can’t answer. But he does know one thing: Astoria Greengrass has been depressed for as long as he has been anxious.
White, bony fingers dig into her carefully made low bun, clawing at her scalp. “I never wanted it to be like this Draco. I’m sorry.”
“It doesn’t look good on you to dwell on the past. You waste too much time doing that.” She pats the bag of vegetables in his arms. “Now go finish those carrots.”
His son hides his laughter behind a box of lemon drop biscuits as Draco continues to rant, the heat and the situation picking at his nerves. His braid swishes violently behind him, mimicking his frustration in its own animated fashion.
Pureblood families were expected to partake in the odd tradition. He’s trying to do better to rid himself of his past prejudices, for his and Scorpius’ sake, but old habits die hard. They’re much more inclined to living, especially when it comes to Potter and his gang of Gryffindors. So instead he finds himself saying, “I could teach him.”
Harry watches Malfoy’s exaggerated facial expressions for a second longer than he should because his trousers feel tighter than comfortable and he forces himself to tear his eyes away from the scene and head over to the Quidditch pitch, holding his broom with a deathly grip.
Harry seems to consider for a moment before nodding his head. “Probably. I quite like doing that. It’s a pretty effective way to shut you up.”
they casted around them is strong and Draco twiddles his fingers anxiously as he waits. In the name of professionalism, he says put in his spot at the front of the room, not going over to Harry and gripping his hand as he waits for their decision. His hand grips onto his wand, because it’s real. His braid, because that’s real too.
“Right.” His fingers circle around the rim of his wine glass slowly, as he prepares to include Harry in the small list of people that know why he got divorced. “She never hurt him. Physically, I mean. I just think that should be made clear beforehand.”
It’s Harry who pulls away first, nostrils flaring. A bit of his old childhood competitiveness simmers in delight at Harry being the first to give in.
It’s not often he has to report to the Ministry for his new findings but when he does, it’s always a dreadfully saddening experience. Draco knows that he’s made his mistakes, and he knows that a bit of celestial research won’t atone for those mistakes but Merlin, it wouldn't hurt for someone just to
Draco’s figured Harry out. He’s not stupid and he bets his cock wasn’t broken from the way he was smirking. He’s just a terribly massive flirt.
The children clap loudly as he finishes with Albus and Scorpius whooping and flat out ignoring Burns snarling for them to hush.
Draco laughs at the notion that he was ever shy in front of Potter. If nothing else, he’s grateful that Scorpius favors Astoria in temperament. Draco bets that if he tried making friends like he did in his first year, his experience at Brookington would be a lonely one.
Ginny moves across the kitchen, ignoring the gasps of Molly and Hermione when she grabs George by the collar of his shirt, pulling his sitting body up to her height with terrifying strength. It’s easy to forget at times that she was a professional Quidditch player. “Next time you drug my kid, I’ll hex the skin off your arse.” He lets out several choked coughs as she pulls harder. “Got it?”
Jaspers is there when he turns, breathless and bright-eyed as he asks, “Do you want to know your future?”
“We should have done this sooner.” It’s been ten years and Draco finally remembers how right it felt to feel another body pinning him down, dominating him. He can’t help but imagine all of the trouble they would have been spared had they just admitted this—
He tries and fails not to watch with poorly concealed curiosity as Potter cooks them breakfast. He would have tried to watch whether it was Potter cooking or not. How anybody can create something edible from virtual nothingness will never not baffle him. It was a skill that he had undermined when he had house-elves, and certainly one he never thought he would ever bother learning.
Draco watches with narrowed, determined eyes as Harry finishes up the PTA meeting for today. Kacia is suspiciously quiet, but from the way Areum had been glaring daggers at her all afternoon, Draco would be too.
Scorpius is just telling Arthur about photosynthesis when Molly excitedly announces that the desert is done. Albus sits up straighter in his seat, squirming and licking his lips.
Draco can honestly say that he’s never quite been the type of person to fall into obsession or to be addicted to something, but Merlin does Harry make him lose all pretense of his former self when his tongue is so deep inside him. Or when he’s on his knees, staring up at Harry as his teeth glide along the soft skin of his cock to remind him just who it was that was making him feel like this.
“I know. And I said I wasn’t finished you git.” He pinches Harry’s side and he squeaks out an apology. “It was stupid of me to think that. I like you and for some reason, you seem to like me too. Plus it doesn’t hurt that you’re like… aggressively bisexual.”
The universe was giving him all the signs and yet he chose to ignore it like the ignorant sod he was. And now, Potter’s here, teaching his son Merlin knows what and controlling his education for the next year.
Harry was tempted to go to the Tower and pull out his map to locate Malfoy but he resists the urge. Malfoy clearly didn’t want to be found and he had to respect that. No matter how much it was killing him.
“There is no such thing occurring at Scorpius’ school. Every mark he gets, he earns it. Isn’t that right, Scorpius?”
The second Malfoy settles into his seat, he smiles smugly at him from across the room, raising his brows in delight.
“Goddamnit, you’re right!” He pounds his fist on the table with reignited resolve. He was going to do this. Sex was important in many relationships and there was no reason for them not to be having it. “We are going to have sex!”
Harry stiffens beside him. “Erm, what?” He laughs nervously and runs a hand through his hair. “Who says that this is for going to therapy and the potions? Pfft, come on, please it’s not—”
When he puts the plate in front of him, it takes all of his self-restraint to not dig in like a ravished animal. Instead, he waits patiently for Potter to get himself settled, busying himself by carefully laying a napkin on his lap and tries to ignore the titillating steam that wafted up from the food and to his nose.
“Oh! And before I forget, I wanted to give this to you.” Jaspers pulls out a crumpled piece of paper from where his tarot cards are stuffed, handing it to Draco. “I’ve told my uncle all about you and how weird it was that you keep getting rejected. He’s an astronomer like you and wanted to know if you’ll be willing to work as a research assistant for him in October.”
“Your Mother and I are two different people,” Draco says, his voice reeking with spite. He sets his jaw, biting back some of the more scathing criticisms that were slinking up his throat and threatening to spill out from undissolved anger. She was nothing more than Scorpius’ birth mother in Draco’s eyes. To him, Astoria Greengrass was a nobody. She wasn’t
