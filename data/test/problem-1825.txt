"Oh," said John White, A Ravenclaw seventh year half-blood who was dressed up as Pennywise. "Well, I'm Pennywise the dancing clown!" He tried to sound exactly like Pennywise and did a little dance for them.
"Very good, very good," Professor Flitwick squeaked. "10 points to Gryffindor!"
Rebecca gagged as her throat was slit with blood gushing out of her neck. Obviously, she was acting this out but making it seem as real as she could. She fell to the floor, clutching her throat.
Draco smiled and watched Harry leave thinking; I really, really like you. He was surprised to hear Harry thank him for the kiss. After all, it was an irresistible, amazing kiss. He got up from the bed, grabbed his clothes and headed into the bathroom to change his clothes, leaving the green pyjamas next to the red ones and made his way down to the Slytherin common room after getting his Nimbus 2001.
"Harry, please get to work," Draco said and shoved Harry in the chest with his shoulder. He just wanted to get this done so he doesn't have to deal with knowing Weasel was in the same room as him again. Harry involuntarily sucked in air as a flash of pain travelled through his chest.
"The spell 'Hastio' is a charm that is used whenever you need to get to places fast," Hermione said proudly. "It basically makes you run 10x faster than you normally can. However, using the charm in events such as races and muggle triathlons will have consequences."
Narcissa just kissed her husband on the cheek and headed down to her bedroom. When she entered, she walked up to her desk, grabbed a red envelope, and started writing her own letter to her son.
Draco kept the smirk on his face as he let go of their intertwined hands and used his hands to help push himself under the table. He crawled over to Harry's legs and pushed them outwards, now staring at Harry's pants.
Ivy grinned mischievously and whispered to herself, "Oh, but you will."
"Oh, nothing," Neville said in a flat voice and he let out a deep sigh from within. "It's nothing at all, Harry. Please, let's just go to sleep. We will need it." Harry saw Neville roll onto his side and the drapes of his bed fell shut.
Granger rolled her eyes at the Slytherin, knowing that was all an act as she saw him hesitating and thinking. "Whatever, Malfoy. Believe what you want." She turned and left for the Gryffindor common room.
"Oh, ha-ha!" Ivy said in disbelief with a roll of her eyes. If this was some trick of Pansy's it was not going to work. She doesn't give up that easy. She decided to drop Draco off at Harry first and then do Pansy. It'll be much easier as she knows Pansy can get a little whiny.
Draco looked up and nodded slightly at the muggle-born, acknowledging her existence for a bit. "Granger."
"That sounds so romantic!" Lavender says sweetly, her hand coming up to her heart which it stayed there. "I wonder what Ivy and I will do; I still don't know who's going to pick the places to go." She was pondering where Ivy will take her. Is there a lunch reservation? Or just a little stroll through Hogsmeade together, holding hands.
"Oh, okay," Harry said with a small smile and watched as Cedric turned around after smiling at them and went to the exit of the tent. "Goodbye, Cedric."
Hermione didn't exactly know who she supported in Quidditch. It was all just so confusing, it was like soccer, but in the air with brooms. Much like the muggle sports, so she just wore her Gryffindor scarf.
Padma and the other Pure-blooded Ravenclaws, except the muggle-born and half-blood ones, came running out of their common room at the sound of a scream close by. They didn't know what was going on, but something was leading them down to the third floor of Hogwarts. And that's when they saw a large doll sitting on a white chair, with two blonde braids held together by red ribbons and a white creamy dress.
As soon as Lunch came around, Harry walked into the Great Hall and sat down next to Hermione on the Gryffindor table facing the Slytherins. He didn't want to come to lunch today, but the professor had informed them last night that he wanted to speak to everyone about something special. So, even if he dreaded going to the Great Hall and wanted to just sulk in his bed with the curtains drawn around him, he just had to come.
Draco eyed Harry's straight back leaving the room. Draco stood up from the table and walked away ignoring the gap-jawed expressions of the Slytherins at the table. He had been watching Harry for three years; he knew that the idiot didn't stop until he couldn't go on anymore. Hopefully, the dragon handlers knew what they were doing.
"I am finally Done at last!" She said with a smile and guided them through The Three Broomsticks until they found a seat together on the left side of the restaurant. "Harry, may I please use Hedwig to deliver my parent's presents?"
"I hope you're right," Harry stared at his snowy white owl, giving her a fond smile even if she is ignoring him. Hedwig was just looking out the window at the snow falling outside the window of the moving train.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I didn't know how to title this chapter.
"I- I did not say any of that!" Draco spat with a single stutter, not liking how right they were. He remembers saying something close to what they were saying. He hated how others can be right when talking to him. Why can't he be right for once?
Harry watched as the flames danced under the cauldron, he could feel the warmth on his fingers. "Oh, okay," he said and scanned the ingredients and instructions on the page in Draco's potions book. "It says here that I need Boom berry, Dittany, Ginger root, Griffin claw, Horklump juice and peppermint."
There will be practical lessons today. Meet out back in the courtyard as we'll be trying a new spell.
Harry replayed what Malfoy had said in his head. He has to make sure that this isn't a trick. "What makes you think that I would accept the truce?" he asked him, giving him a sour expression. Though he really does want a truce with Malfoy. He would love to get along with Malfoy just once, or twice, or forever. "Everything you've said and done from the first year to this year. I can't exactly forget everything you've done and move on."
"Behind the door is a room which has furniture and a couple more bookshelves but smaller than the ones in the library," Draco told him, smiling as he's glad to have Harry around him more than other days. He will cherish these days he spends with Harry as they're very special to him. "It's just like another library but smaller."
"I'm yours, Harry James Potter," Draco whispered into Harry's ear and gave his earlobe a little nibble. The Gryffindor gasped at the feeling and nuzzled his nose in Draco's neck, scenting the citrus and vanilla and sighing in satisfaction.
Lavender gave a little giggle and looked over Ivy's shoulder, trying to see if anyone was around them in case someone were to overhear them. "No, not that," she told her a little shyly and folded her hair behind her ears. "I mean of my sexuality... being bisexual"
Harry rocked his body slowly in Draco's lap, settling himself there, savouring the hot stretch of his anal passage, smiling to himself just like the cat that got the cream. Draco's body seemed to liquefy beneath him until all he could do was flop back into the pillow, gazing lovingly up at Harry, his fingers caressing the taut flesh of his backside in lazy circles.
He thought about the other week, and how Harry somehow put his name in that goblet. Of course, Draco didn't believe that Harry was that stupid to want to go into the Tri-wizard or even try putting his name in that Goblet. He knew Harry could never get passed Dumbledore's age line, nobody could unless they were 17 or older. No spell or potion he was ever taught by his godfather could make someone age and have that age recognized as true. It was just impossible.
Draco nodded his thanks and jogged up the stairs. He took a left and entered the 4th year's boy's dormitory. When he entered, he was threatened with wands at his throat by Neville, Dean and Seamus. He breathed heavily, and looked around the room, not finding Harry anywhere. "Sorry, I came to find Harry." Neville, Dean and Seamus lowered their wands from his throat.
*cough*
"And a cute one at that," Draco said with a loving smile as he has seen that one baby photo of Harry in the red photo Album professor Hagrid apparently gave Harry. He sucked on Harry's top lip like he was a sweet, which he was. Harry is his sweet. His lollipop.
To change the topic, they talked about each other, what they like and love doing until it was time to head home. Harry insisted he comes over and meets Draco's parents properly, and not like back in the second year. Eventually, Draco agrees to take Harry home, even though he questioned him to if he's alright to see the manor after the war. So, Draco took Harry to the manor and smiled when seeing the new-coloured manor.
"Not if I can actually win back the snitch, which I believe I can," Harry said with a playful grin, and a gleam showed in his green eyes, making Draco feel amused and also a little playful. The Slytherin was pondering what Harry could do that would beat him to the snitch.
Harry turned around and looked at Draco with a questionable expression. "Yeah?" he asked, a little unsure why Draco wasn't trying to rush him to class. He knows the Slytherin likes to get to class just in time with his house.
Pansy screamed and backed away from the tv, hiding behind the couch Ron sat on. Draco and Blaise jumped over the back of their armchairs but peeped their heads over the edge to keep an eye on the ghost girl.
Harry slowly turned to look at him. Draco could see the horror and fright on his face. Harry was shaking, trembling and Draco wished they never entered into the darn maze in the first place. He saw the tears streaming down Harry's beautiful face. He quickly made his way through the archway, grabbing his wand and pointing it to the deceased Weasley and Granger and shouted "REDUCTO!" at them.
Draco shook his head as he said, "No." He doesn't exactly want to wake up his dorm mates like the last time he did. And he knows Ivy would be waiting for him with unanswered questions which he doesn't want to answer. "A Malfoy always gets their beauty sleep."
Draco looked Harry in his eyes and nodded at the nervous look his boyfriend had. He looked beside him and stared right back at Ron, narrowing his eyes at the redhead. "Anything you have to say to Harry you can say it to me too."
Harry swallows, nearly choking on the peach slice and looks to the floor. "Oh, um..." He never expected this to come up. Yet again Draco surprises him with questions he doesn't want to answer. But he'll try anyway. He's going to regret this later though. "I- They... they treat me like a house-elf and have been since I was young. They make me do the chores for them such as cleaning the dishes, making breakfast, hanging out the laundry."
Harry held out his pinky finger to Draco. They've never done this before. It's a first time for everything. "Do you promise, my dear one?"
Harry just looked at Draco with a tear-stained face. He leaned into Draco's warm comforting body and just lay there. "I'm sorry, Draco," he started sobbing, feeling his mental walls collapse. "I've always wanted to but never knew when to, I don't want to ruin our romantic moments together. I know it's no reason to not tell you... I love you too, so sodding much."
Down in the Slytherin dungeons in the boy's dormitory, Draco Malfoy was dreaming the same. The exact same actually. He dreams of Harry's hands exploring his hair, and his own hands holding Harry's beautiful face as he kisses him passionately. Over on the bed beside him, Blaise looked over at his best friend's bed and saw a smile on Draco's face. He just knew Draco was dreaming of Harry Potter. Draco always smiles in his sleep when dreaming of the green-eyes Gryffindor.
Ivy smiled, she loved having knowledge that other wizards and witches didn't have. It just means she gets to teach others about muggle objects and see their reactions after. "It's a thing you play music on and it's like a gramophone but can play more songs that don't require records."
Ivy remembered the talk they had a night ago and chuckled. Then she remembered his face and how red it is. "By the way, your face is very red," she told him earnestly. "You should read chapter 342 of your charms book, Dray." She reached into her robe pocket and took out her round makeup mirror, opening it up so the mirror faced Draco.
"And a "little" jealous when Lavender Brown-" Harry stopped right there when Hermione glared at him, so he changed the topic quickly. Damn him and his big mouth. "Sorry... Anyway, I'm here to find a bloke." He looked away from her and kept his head down but looked around the bar again.
Draco considered this for a moment. If he does do it, he won't do it alone. Pansy and Ivy will do it too but at different times. It can't be that hard, can it? "Alright. Deal." It seemed fair anyway. They all shook hands, agreeing with the deal.
"Yes, to what?" asked Draco, raising an eyebrow.
*****
Draco nodded about the Malfoyism Harry mentioned but couldn't help but feel a little sad that his words could have hurt Harry. "Yeah, they weren't hard to miss," he said a little woefully and stared down at his hands. "Just so you know, I talked to Skeeter a couple of weeks ago when I was still, err, mad at you."
Draco was desperate for more. He reached behind himself with both hands and prised his buttocks apart painfully, begging through his actions for that first shock of penetration.
Harry sighed and put his wand away, shaking his head at the Slytherin. "When will you get it through your thick skull?" he asked him. Well, he's been asking the world that. "I don't want attention, it's so annoying having the Prophet tell its viewers about such negative and bias things about me. I cannot control what the papers write about me, Rita's always making up stories about me! You don't get it! Nobody does! Nobody knows how the great Harry Potter lives. Everyone thinks I live in some castle and is treated like royalty but I'm not!" He stopped before he would say anything else.
Harry looked down at his nose where Draco kissed him. He hoped his face wasn't as red as a tomato was. Merlin save him if he did. "Oh, well I hope she treated you well."
Harry looked up at the hidden clock in the sky. 11:36 pm. Gosh, can't time fly for once? 'The last dance' started playing in the ballroom. He looked back at Draco and bowed while asking for Draco's hand, "Another dance?"
Harry sucked on Draco hard while reaching up to play with his balls. He caressed a finger over Draco's groin, loving hearing the shaky breath coming from his boyfriend. And then he leaned up and scraped his teeth over the gorgeous Slytherin's shaft.
They both got out their wands and cast a "Lumos" so they could see in front of them as they entered through the dark hidden passageway. They walked on and on until they noticed that the passageway became brighter and the floor and walls were covered with what looked like vines. They then came to a mysterious looking wooden door with more roots and vines snaking up and around the door and a little wooden carved symbol of a badger on the doorknob. Harry and Draco both looked at each other, looking to see if the other agrees with them to open the door.
Neville regained his Gryffindor bravery from who knows where and looked at everyone. "We should go search for them and find the professors. They will know what to do and how to get the students back."
Harry and Draco sat down next to each other at the long table in the kitchen. Dobby gave the boys happy and surprised looks as he saw them. He jumped up on the table they were seated at. "Harry Potter sir, how can Dobby be at service?"
"Actually yes, a midnight blue dress robe with a fedora," said Ron with a nod and placed the yellow fedora back on its rack with the other fedoras and weird beanies and hats that look too expensive. He made sure to get a cheap robe that's not too cheap but not too expensive. It only cost about seven Galleons. "Can I have it?"
Draco leaned out of the hug only slightly, so he could look at the teary boy. He wiped away a few tears from Harry's face with his thumb and kissed him slowly, not wanting to leave his side, but he didn't want to keep his mother waiting. "I love you," Draco said, letting the word slip out of his mouth even though he shouldn't have said it. "Owl me the details of our date at any time, I'll owl you back a reply." He then exited the Grand Hall towards the entrance Hall after another kiss to the mouth.
“Sorry, father, but I’m in good and safe hands,” said Draco, using a reassuring tone to calm his father down a little. Hagrid finally caught up to them but hanged around the Weasley family and Lucius smiled at his son and Harry.
"How are you able to afford it, then?" asked Dean, and his eyebrows gathered in a little in curiosity. She must live in the muggle world or something if she has muggle money to afford these things. "It's got to be worth thousands of dollars. Do you live in the muggle world too?"
Harry just stared at Draco, still not knowing why he'd just come up and say 'Hi' then say 'Bye' and leave. He then caught himself staring at the blonde Slytherin's butt and liking how it moves as he walks. He sighs and decides to head to breakfast like he would have done. It's nice to see Draco come and go though.
Harry ran and ran, looking back again and kept running until he was at the park. He raced through the park, jumping over small shrubs, ducking from low tree branches and zig-zagged through the lines of trees. He looked behind him for what felt like the 30th time, didn't see Dudley or his friends and ducked behind a tree. Panting, he glanced around his surroundings again but there was still no sign of his cousin.
And that was when the memory ended. Ron continued to stare at the fireplace, wondering if Percy was right about it all. The only people he's seen together are boys and girls, not girls and girls or boys and boys. He's never actually seen any guys kiss guys or girls kiss girls. But bloody hell! He's come close to it with Harry and Malfoy. What would happen if Harry and Malfoy start dating? Would their friendship change or would it be the same? Just the thought of losing Harry to Malfoy was horrifying.
Draco felt his pulse pick up as they stood in the dim-lit shower. Harry's hand hadn't moved, but it felt like it was pumping a burning heat into Draco's leg, a heat that radiated outward and sent signals to parts of his body, waking them up, making them prickle with tension. He sees Harry's panicked face, and from the corner of his eye, he sees red. "Harry, don't be afraid to show your scars to me," he tells him softly, and Harry nods and looks to the ground with a frown. "Don't be ashamed, my darling. Ivy does it too. I'm not angry or mad that you do such a thing to yourself. It's saddening but I believe you'll get better."
He sighs and pats the mattress beside him for Blaise to sit down next to him. Blaise did exactly so but left one leg dangling over the side of the bed and the other leg tucked under the other. "I've just been thinking about him. That's all. He touched my hair."
"But Ivy Black," Harry reminded him just to make sure of things. He swore they were... he didn't even want to say the word. It sickened him. Merlin, why's he getting all yandere now. "She and Draco are close. I've seen them together a lot..."
He had this odd, exciting sensation within him though he knows that he will soon not believe anything he's heard. No, he's starting to not believe it now. But it's just the way Draco's moving his eggs around his plate is what amused Harry, and he felt himself moving closer to the blonde until he touched his leg. Being here at the Slytherin table felt like he had come into a new world. It's like he fell down the rabbit hole and ended up in Wonderland.
He found the skulls on the table a little creepy, but they matched the eerie feeling down in the common room. But it was a little too dark. Harry couldn't really see anything. The only thing that guided him was Draco's warm hand intertwined with his own pulling him somewhere.
"Good," Seamus said and decided to doodle a little on his parchment to pass the time. Beside him, Dean was watching Seamus draw, but he also added a few little doodles to Seamus' parchment too.
Draco blushed as he checked Harry out and admired everything about this Gryffindor. He can't literally tell him he has fluffy black hair, has green eyes, is a Gryffindor and has a firebolt now, can he? He laughed on the inside at how Harry would react when hearing him admit all that. "Anyway, we're here now," he said as he entered through the wooden library doors with Harry by his side.
Draco let out a groan of delight, and he kept himself up by his arms on either side of Harry. He opened Harry's mouth hungrily to let his tongue in as Harry would always obey to whatever he wants. Harry's green eyes opened a little in surprise at the feel of Draco's tongue in his mouth, but he succumbed to his boyfriend's ministrations without hesitation.
"Anything else we should hear?" Ron asked with a smirk to his lips. This was quite amusing, and he could use this as blackmail towards Malfoy if he hurts his best mate's heart.
Harry really didn't want to be here. Escaping was something he wanted to do but he had to stay and suffer in an hour of Potions. He wanted to be alone, to be someplace where nobody could find him. In a loud 'Thud' the Potions Classroom Door shut, that could only mean that Snape has entered.
Harry looked at from one Professor to the next worriedly. He hoped his Professor's believed him because he didn't put his name in the bloody Goblet. He doesn't even know how this happened in the first place.
Draco glared at the Gryffindor, feeling a blush form on his cheeks when realizing what Dean Thomas meant. "Alright," he said and took a few more steps back towards the exit. "I'm going to go now... and find him." He rushed out the dormitory and made his way down the steps but stopped as he saw the boy's bathroom. He curiously followed his gut inside the bathroom but didn't see anybody there. He sighed and made his way back out towards the common room and that's when he saw... "Harry?!" He didn't see his boyfriend there before when he entered the common room minutes ago.
"How about you, Harry? Harry? Oi! Harry!" Ron whispered and sighed, laying back on his bed. "Bloody Hell, Harry. You had me scared." Ron thought for a moment if Harry were asleep, he could say anything to him. He decided not to and just head to bed, better safe than sorry, right?
Ron just didn't believe it. He didn't want to believe his best mate way gay. But would he actually mind if Harry were gay? It's a little strange, especially if it's Malfoy Harry's into. It's himself that minds if he were gay though. What would his mom and dad think about that? "Um... that's cool." The thought of kissing Blaise popped into his head and he believes he's going crazy. He looks up above them and freezes. The darn Poltergeist and his idiocy. "Bloody Hell!"
A certain flash of red broke Harry's dreamy state and he looked over at the other side of the library, seeing Hermione giving him a knowing smile with a red book in her hands. Harry blushed from being caught staring at Draco and looked back down at the book he was reading with a smile. Why the hell was Hermione here? Oh, never mind. She's always in the Hogwarts Library.
Harry and Draco quickly pulled out of the kiss and blushed guiltily. The whole class turned their heads to see a flushed Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy looking away from each other. Hermione, Pansy, and Blaise chuckled at the duo. As the class finished, everyone headed down to their next class.
Harry frowned at him, wondering if there really is something which Draco can do to make it up for the things he did and said. "It's okay, I've forgiven you." Has he really forgiven Draco after everything he did and said? The answer is yes because who wouldn't forgive that pretty face.
Harry turned around to face his favourite Slytherin, Draco Malfoy. "Yeah, he is," He said but then hesitated as he just couldn't believe what he said and admitted right in front of his crush. He felt his cheeks warm up with a blush. "I mean- it is-," he said with a nervous smile and laugh. "Definitely! The view-. Yes, very pretty."
Dean shrugged, his eyes not looking away from Seamus' blue eyes. Such a pretty colour. The colour he just loves to see every morning, day, and night. He removed his mask from his face, ignoring Hannah's words of protest. He cupped Seamus' face and whispered, "I am so sorry for this prank if it hurt you, Shay." He pressed his forehead to the Irish Gryffindor's. "I love you so much, Seamus Finnegan."
Neville nodded. He can easily do that. "Only if you ask him out," he said and crossed his arms, trying to look confident when standing up to the Slytherin. "And please, just call me Neville. And trust me, Ron likes you back. Even if he's been a complete git about it. It'll take some time for that small brain of his to wrap itself around reality but that time will come."
"Come on, you lovestruck wizard," Hermione said, placing a hand around Ron's side and Harry's shoulder. "We should head back now. And I'm cooking dinner this time, Harry."
Draco nodded and watched the TV as it showed the introduction to the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' movie. Joslyn silently hummed the tune of the 'Harry Potter' introduction as it came on. (I mean, who doesn't? XD) We silently watched the movie together in silence. She always got excited at every part of the movie since she hasn't seen it in a while.
Then the lights turned back off. Everyone still screamed, afraid the ghost girl might get them now that the lights are off.
Draco suddenly blushed and looked into Harry's green eyes, remembering a certain thing he dreamt of. No, but I dreamt of kissing you, he thought. He shook his head at the question. "No. I don't remember a thing except drinking the potion and falling asleep."
Draco reached over and ran his fingers through Harry's raven hair, trailing them down his neck, and then further down to his back. He slithered his hand over Harry's waist and held him close, his body pressed up against his boyfriend and he was smelling the pine in his boyfriend's hair.
Draco sat down next to Harry with a smile. He always loved getting partnered with Harry, even if he has to use his Malfoy Mask at times. "Hello Harry," he said a little quietly, so nobody really hears him saying Harry's name. "I'm glad to see you made it to class."
Harry looked at him as he stood up from the table seat and he nodded. "I'd like that," he says as he knows and hopes he would get a goodnight kiss from Draco. It would be their first goodnight kiss and hopefully not their last.
Fred and George both looked up and saw Harry. Harry looked up at the twins and smile, who smiled back at Harry.
Harry closed his eyes with a smile. Having Draco touch his scar sent tingles around it and down his spine. It was very comforting, almost like a massage. He could fall asleep.
Harry remembered the blade he left in Moaning Myrtles Bathroom in the can of empty mints in a cupboard. Maybe cutting has an effect on his anxiety, as well. He never actually wanted Hermione and Ron to worry at all about him though. But still, even when telling Ron that the Dursleys kept him in a cupboard for the first 11 years of his life, he still had not tried to rescue Harry through any of the summer breaks.
Lucius smirked at him but really didn't want to be hugged. He grabbed a small white container and levitated it over to the youngest Red head.
"Uh... Truth or Dare is when you ask someone a question," Harry said and the number of questions he would like to ask Draco popped into his head. "Daring someone means they have to do it and Truth means you ask a question about them and they can't lie."
He also got Draco a Crystal Ball with a 3D solar system inside the glass and a silver stand to go with it. It was to remind him that their friendship means more than the world to him. It's a little cheesy, and Harry knows this, but Harry won't tell him. It would be like a secret Santa. And for Ivy, since he knows she likes witchery stuff he got her some tarot cards and a carved deer skull to put on a wall. Also, for Hermione, he got her a Clutch that looks like an old leather book and a red mug that says 'My books are my best friends', in white cursive letters. He got Ron a black wallet with little hand-stitched snitches on it and an O shaped magnetic levitation globe with the Earth in the centre of it. He just thought that Ron would like to see what the Earth looks like when spinning around and levitating inside a circle.
I love Drarry! :3
Harry looked back beside him at his adorable jealous boyfriend and nudged him playfully with a cheeky smile and a wink. Why would his boyfriend ever be jealous of Firenze? Harry doesn't even like the centaur. He likes Draco. No, he loves him with all his heart and soul.
Ivy frowned at Harry and his smile, knowing too well that the smile he gave her was fake. She could tell when someone fakes a smile. She's faked thousands of smiles every day. She's not used to it, and it looks like she made a good decision to come over here so she could look out for Harry.
Blaise beamed and rubbed the back of his neck, knowing exactly what this meant. But he still had to interrogate Draco about this for more answers. "Noted," he said simply. He got out his wand and swished it around the flattened rose. The rose puffed itself up like a balloon, unflattening its petals and blooming into the rose it was before getting flattened. "Would you like me to give this to Draco but say it's from you?"
Harry and Draco looked back at each other and smiled. They couldn't help it. They moved back closer to each other, Draco grabbed Harry's waist and dipped him over the table, kissing him gently and carefully, and Harry's arms came up and wrapped around Draco's neck. It was the kind of kiss that steals your breath away but gives it back. It definitely took their breath away. Everything around them became oddly quiet but they didn't mind. Not really.
Ron rolled his eyes at Hermione, not liking the day already. "Fine..."
*****
"Good morning class, today we'll be doing something much easier," said Professor Trelawny in her shaky voice, and smiling at all her students. "We'll be using zodiac crystals to see what is set for you in the future."
While filming Prisoner of Azkaban, the pockets of Tom Felton's Hogwarts robes were sewn shut to stop him sneaking food on set.
Draco and Harry nodded and followed her to the photographers taking group photos. They spotted Pansy, Blaise, Ron, and Ivy in one group who were positioned in front of the large white fir trees. They hurried over just so they aren't wasting the photographer's time. Ignoring Pansy's rants about where they've been, Harry and Draco joined the two other boys on the floor while Hermione joined the girls standing up.
The Yule Ball is finally happening!
Draco walked over and sat beside Harry with his legs crossed and his elbow leaning on the top of the couches back while he looked into Harry's emerald green eyes. "Since we're alone down here with nothing but books, did want to play a game?"
"Ha-ha!" Harry teased and smirked at the blonde whose white-blonde hair had snow on it. It was beautiful actually. But that would be cold, and he knows it. "Nice shot, Draco. You missed by a few inches."
"Potty!".
"Very well done, 'Ermione!" said Hagrid and put the bag he was holding down on the floor for use. "So, in these very mounds of treasure are Niffler'z. Grab some gold everyone and lure a Niffler out for yerselves."
"But he'z juzt a boy!" Fleur said sharply. She couldn't believe it. This school would let an innocent young boy into such a dangerous Tournament with three other older competitors. What if he gets hurt or worse? Killed!
Draco sighed and rubbed at his brows. "Fine..." He said and quickly started re-potting a Sunflower and another rose. "Come on let's finish this. The sooner we are done the sooner we are out of here."
Draco kissed Harry's cheek, and Hedwig dug her claws into the blonde's arm to get his attention back again, but Draco tried his best to ignore the pain. Harry smiled at the loving gesture and leaned his head on the Slytherin's shoulder.
Draco frowned; he's been wanting to hear what caused Harry to develop an eating disorder. Or even what could have made him look so down and depressed. What does Harry go through? He couldn't help but ask, "Harry, are you really okay?"
*****
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
The two of them worked in silence for the rest of the time. Draco's face was completely blank, focused on the task in front of him, telling Harry to add more soil, dig a hole in the small pot and plant the tree. Harry automatically did whatever Draco told him to do. In his head, he was replaying the conversation in the storeroom. What had he been about to say about Ron?
But this was necessary. Harry believes he deserves to have pain, he deserves to be in pain. He doesn't deserve to be loved; he deserves to be lonely. He doesn't deserve to have friends. Sometimes, he wants attention, but does that make him an attention seeker? These are even more reasons for him to be lonely and in pain. He wants to be in more pain.
Draco grunted and wanted the preparations to be over with already. "Please-- Harry."
"Alright," Draco said with a nod and turned to look at Pansy and Ivy. Finally, he could leave these two and spend some quality time with Harry. "Ta-Ta, Pansy, Ivy."
He stands up and goes downstairs to see if he really is alone in the house, and he is. The little puddle of blood he spat out hours ago was still there and he couldn't be bothered cleaning it up. He was walking around the empty house, trying to find a mirror when he looks directly at the medicine cabinet. Deja Vu. He limps over to the medicine cabinet and examines its contents. He sees the pills that he tried overdosing on last holiday and grabs them as well as a fuller container of the same pills.
"Where on earth did you learn to dance like this?" Harry asked in between dance moves. He just followed Fred's movements, even if he sucked at waltzing and dancing in general. Practice makes perfect though. He doesn't know where he picked that up from, but it must have been from a movie.
"I love you," Harry says quietly to Draco's shoulder as the music gets a little softer, and he leaned his forehead on Draco's shoulder. "You know, the happiest I've ever felt was that moment I discovered you love me too. That was our first real kiss together, and the moment on Christmas day when you asked me out."
"Mate, where are you going?" Ron asked, his eyebrows furrowing out of curiosity. There was a ton of food on the table, surely his best mate would want a little more to eat.
Harry circled his hips, willing the muscles to stretch enough to make the rest of the penetration easier, and he played with those couple of inches of Draco, sliding them in and out of his body, squeezing them tight inside his hole and letting them go again, moaning at the incredible sensation rippling outwards, making himself hungry for more.
Harry shrugged as he said, "I like to mess with people. And it will work in getting Ginny to back off a bit". A mischievous glint entered his eye as he smirked, "Also, I definitely wouldn't mind snogging the hell out of you".
Ivy and Lavender both rolled their eyes at the boys and continued carrying on a conversation with each other about what they want their date to be and so on.
"And you didn't think to tell someone about the kidnapping?" Blaise snapped at him, sweeping his hand across his forehead with fear at what could have happened to Neville. The night just keeps getting worse.
Fred and George exchanged glances of confusion as they looked at Draco who seemed utterly worried about something. They ignored him and turned to look at the girl with Black hair and blue eyes. "Who might this lovely lady be-," asked Fred.
Draco leaned in for a short kiss with the biggest smile he has ever given anyone. After all this time, Harry knew he was saying 'I love you' to him. He leaned away from the kiss, pressing his lips together and he said, "You don't know how long I've waited to say that to you or even hear that from you, Harry."
Draco blushed a little from Harry seeing what he looks like under a shirt and grabbed the pyjamas from Harry that he forgot to get beforehand. "Thank you, for the pyjamas," he said and placed them on the sink beside his clothes. "And it's fine, really." He didn't mind at all that Harry came in at this time. It's just if he was taking his pants off... then he would have snapped. He knows that he and Harry both have the same... parts, but he likes his privacy.
"Sure!" Draco then thought of something...he would be on the back of Harry's broom, right up next to his bottom along with almost hugging him, even though he wouldn't mind the hugging bit. It was just the thought of being close to Harry's tight-looking ass made him almost harden. He was about to refuse but Harry had already mounted his broom and held out his hand. Draco smiled up at Harry levitating in the air, grabbed his hand and mounted on Harry's broom.
Harry felt this was getting a little boring, but he watched Mark's friends talk amongst each other and summon three red plastic cups. What exactly were the boys going to do? Or were they just thirsty? He actually doesn't know what he is still doing here and why he isn't up in his dorm where it's warm and he can look out the window while thinking about his depressing life.
Harry couldn't help but smile continuously and he squeezed Draco's hand, earning him a light squeeze back from the Slytherin.
She then heard a loud crash coming from her room. Oh god... Draco, what have you done now" she thought to herself warily as she walked back to her room. She just hoped he didn't break anything like a glass skull which she likes to collect.
"I've tried," said Ginny, her voice breaking in fear when she turned her head to look at her brother. She didn't want to look away in case the Nun came back and crept up at her from behind, but she had to be brave. "But she wasn't anywhere in her office and we tried knocking on her portrait but there was no response."
"I'll make sure he doesn't, and thanks for understanding," Harry said and was glad Ron could put the differences aside for once. It was nice to know Ron was making friends with a Slytherin. His smile genuinely built as he looked over at the Slytherin table behind Ron. Draco was chatting to Ivy while eating jam scones and drinking what looked like Eggnog.
Draco frowned when Harry disappeared. Where did he go? Or perhaps... it was just a figment of his imagination. He hoped not. He placed his hands on the glass, swearing that Harry was in front of him. But this glass... He sighed, placing his forehead against the cold glass. "Let's go..." He turned around sadly and escorted his friends back towards where they came in from.
Their mouths touch the slightest bit and Harry pulls away with anxiety but then they begin closing the gap even more and then gradually this small peck becomes this much more passionate kiss with its own lifeline surviving by the slight movements of their tongues dancing in their mouths. They were connected body and soul at this moment, the rest of the world spins so fast it becomes non-existent in their minds.
"Maybe I should start spilling Butterbeer on myself when I'm around you," Fred said with a wink at Harry. Though the thought of doing so would be daft and he doesn't want to ruin his dress robes. They might be secondhand robes, but they were hard to come by.
They kept walking along the corridors of Hogwarts when Ron bumped right into something, well, someone. He looked up at the figure that crashed into him. "Bloody Hell, Hagrid," he said out of surprise. The professor actually scared him a little. "I'm sorry."
"Potter?"
Draco bites his lip and looks down at Harry's trousers. He looks back up at Harry, asking for permission and he gets another nod. He sighs and feels butterflies start fluttering around in his stomach at the thought of what's under these pants. He slowly unzips Harry's trousers and with a little help from Harry lifting his lower body up, he was able to slip the trousers down to Harry's knees. He was looking down at black boxers. Biting harder down on his lips, he pulls Harry's boxers down to his knees and quickly looks up at the flushed face of Harry Potter. He smiles a little and braces himself for the sight he's about to see.
Harry walked up beside her to admire the view from the Astronomy Tower. It's also when he felt the sharpness of the chilly air on his face The sun was only just above the horizon in the distance and its yellow gleam covered the mountains and landscape like a heavenly light.
"About controlling my loathing of Gryffindors, and my friendship with you," Draco said with a sideways glance towards Harry, and he gave a small smile at Harry. He wondered how Harry would look with a rose placed on his ear.
We are still kids, but we're so in love
At first, Harry just stared and rested his arms casually on the railings that were stopping him from falling to his death, until the Slytherin caught him staring and gave him a wink. Harry felt his cheeks warm-up and a noticeable reddening tinge formed on his face. He couldn't tell if they were blushing or if someone cast a warming charm somewhere.
Draco nodded and eventually took Harry's hands and intertwined them with his again as they continued walking to Magical Creatures. "I know, I will do that after class," he said in a promising tone.
"Wow..."
Harry gave a slow shrug though he knows exactly what to do. "Can we um... lay together for a little while?" he asks, and he already is moving slightly forward towards the blonde Slytherin. "As a new couple?"
"Honestly, Harry! "Hermione said with utter disbelief that her friend doesn't remember a simple spell and bewilderment as Harry doesn't listen to their Charms classes. "Do you not pay attention in class or not?"
Seamus smirked at the spell and what it could do. He was intrigued at what else it could do. "So, if I lock the classroom door with the spell, it can only open with Alohomora," he said to the Professor, who nodded at him. "How about if I try locking someone's lips together to shut them up? Can I use Alohomora to open them up again when I feel as if they deserve it?"
Draco screamed. On every brutal thrust inward, he let his lustful, desperate cries out, filling the room and eating away at Harry's composure.
"I find it ... a little concerning with that skin," said Severus, grunting at the noise that the claws were making. "What are you designed to be?"
"That's fine," Harry says and immediately nods his head at the secret entrance into the common room for him. He just needed to see Draco. He had to give his boyfriend the gifts he got him. "Can I have your name please?"
Draco's heart fluttered as he saw Harry take off the cloak. Merlin, the Gryffindor scared him. But the cloak... they're really rare things to have. "Harry?!" He looked Harry up and down in surprise, blinked a few times to make sure he wasn't dreaming. "What- you have an invisibility cloak?"
"Yes," Harry walked to the Floo with Draco, grabbed a handful of Floo powder and said I a clear voice, "The Leaky Cauldron."
"Very well, dear," Mrs Weasley says. Then her expression turned a little serious, confusing Harry a little bit until she said, "Just be careful, won't you?"
Harry frowned and made five cuts deeper into his arm and let the blood roll down his arm. All the anger and pain started slowly draining out of him, he soon started to feel rather dizzy and his vision was blurring. He turned the tap on and ran the icy cold water over his cuts, hissing in pain and watched the blood disappear from his arms. He cast a drying charm on his arm, placed the blade back into the tin and spelled it shut. He rolled down his sleeve and placed the tin back in the cupboard and closed it shut. He numbly walked back up to the common room to his dorm, quietly entered the dorm and got into bed. He closed the drapes around his bed him and as soon as his head hit the pillow, he fell asleep.
Harry groaned in frustration and searched his trunk for his blade. There, in the book, he found it. He walked out of the room towards the bathroom and closed the door behind him, pushing in the lock so nobody could enter unless he allows them to. He stood in front of the sink and rolled his sleeves up past his elbows. He ran his finger down his scarred arm, feeling every cut he has made previously. He pressed his blade into his skin hard and pulled it across his arm until blood began to seep out. Harry sliced the blade across his skin again. The pain of the cuts soothed Harry. It calmed him down. He didn't even realize that the tears were falling down his cheeks.
"What's that thing that Harry's planning for late tonight?" Christina asked her brother, whispering in case her voice was heard by one of her classmates which were still running around freely.
"So," Harry said, breaking the moments of pure silence from this beautiful sunny day. "Tell me about this whole Lucius befriending Mr. Weasley thing."
Harry just scratched harder at his cuts from under his sleeves. He really wanted to just disappear and hideaway up in Gryffindor Tower or down in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Or, perhaps, in the Chamber of secrets. Nobody would dare go down there to find him. It was actually a pretty good idea; it is just the memory of the basilisk would haunt him down there. To see the flesh of the giant snake, and possibly the stench of its rotten flesh.
Harry was staring into those beautiful pools of silver as he was inside the other man. "Oh, Draco," he moaned. "You're so beautiful."
"We know that, you idiot!" spat Pansy at once, and when Draco continued to walk ahead, they follow him. She was stopping herself from hitting him on the arm from how he was reacting. "What I mean is who's is it?"
Draco pointed his wand at the fireplace and immediately the room warmed up as flames flared into life.
"How about both?" Draco suggests softly, leaning closer and brushing his lips over Harry's. He just needed to feel Harry's soft lips on his again. They were mesmerizing and every time they touched his own, he just forgets where he is, and his brain shuts down. "But we can get the couple photo together. Group photos can be after and then we can eat."
Draco looked over at Ivy. He was startled at the sight of her cuts showing in the candle chandelier light of the common room even though he sees her before. "Ivy?" he asked with concern, tilting his head to the side. "Are you okay?"
Harry got up off the floor, washed and dried the blood off his arm and then rolled his sleeves back down. He put the scissors in his trousers pocket, unlocked the bathroom door and went down to the lounge room.
Harry tried to smile as he was remembering that day out in the Quidditch Pitch. "Yes, we talked," he said with a little nod and he picked at his French Toast, trying to eat more. "I never knew he was watching me until I saw his hair glowing on the stands." Hermione giggled at him, knowing how lovestruck Harry can be. Harry didn't know what else to tell her, he knows Draco would rather keep the secret places just that, secret. He sighed and stared down at the ant who's trying to steal a bit of bread crumb from his half-eaten French Toast.
"Okay, it's a deal," Draco said with a warm smile and shook their intertwined hands up and down like he was giving Harry a handshake. "So..." He smirked at the sudden thought of after the dinner events with Harry. "Where are we going to go for our... fun later on tonight?"
Harry sighed. The most popular question known to mankind. Nobody can escape it. "Yes," he nodded, smiling slightly at the memory of seeing Malfoy today. He wondered what Fred's reaction would be if he told him who he likes. Amused, disgusted, and shocked, flashed in his mind in bold letters.
"Don't you dare!" Draco spat at her, and his face tightened with irritation and anger. Pansy was just going too far with this. Doesn't she know how important his hair products are to him? "Give me my hair products!"
Harry and Draco were both loving this. Not just because of the attention but letting everyone know that they really like each other and coming out to them really lifted something from inside each other. It was like a breath they've been holding in for so long and they just released it. Then they leaned away from the kiss, cheeks flushed, panting, with wide smiles on their faces. They pressed their foreheads together, ignoring the sudden round of applause they were getting.
"So, class, all you have to do is water and fertilizer your plants," Professor Sprout explained. "It is recommended to water them once a day, the morning is the best time. Fertilize them once a week otherwise the excess fertilizer alters the soil by creating a too high salt concentration, and this can hurt beneficial soil microorganisms." Everyone in the class beside Hermione, Dean, and Neville was confused with what the professor had said.
Draco blushed from the familiar compliment and smiled wider than ever. He just couldn't believe he didn't recognize Harry under the Freddie costume. He knows all of Harry's curves and edges, and he loves them. "I love you, Harry."
Ivy ended the hug and sat on the windowsill of the castle's big window. She sighed miserably, her back pressed against the window which made Draco's anxiety soar. "I was just in the library looking for a book to read when I passed... a table of fifth years and they whispered..." she paused, and she blinked at her tears which began rolling down her cheeks. "They whispered such obnoxious words to me. One of them even called me a... a..."
I miss you so much, you were like a sister to me that I never had, even if I were a ferret for the small amount of time getting to know you.
"He wanted to ask me a question, but he never got to it," said Harry and the thought of what Draco wanted to tell him, if it wasn't for Hermione coming over at the wrong time, flooded his mind. What could he have wanted to ask Harry? The thoughts were endless.
When he knew his dorm mates were asleep, he quickly grabbed his new metal friend from inside the book he kept it in as well as the one from the sock. He made his way down into Moaning Myrtles Bathroom and found an empty 'Eclipse mints' tub in a cupboard and put his little sharp friends in it. Nobody has ever used or touched it ever, nobody probably knows it's there, so he thought that would be a good hiding spot. He put a ward around the tin so nobody can open the tin and find his little friends in the future.
"Bring your friend over here," the Bulgarian told him with a simple gesture of a wave. "She must sit vith you or you von't be able to sit vith us."
"Yeah, it was fun," said Ron with a shrug, remembering talking to Blaise a lot. The Italian Slytherin, as he found out today where Blaise came from, mostly flexed on about what he likes to do on the weekends such as going shopping or walking the maze out the back of his family's house. It was interesting to listen to, but he mainly watched the Slytherin bite his lip and it was somewhat amusing.
Harry blinks at the sight of Draco below him, so handsome and perfect with his high cheekbones, and sharp jawline, shiny silver eyes, pointy-natural pink lips, soft white-blonde hair, and a beautiful pink tinge to his cheeks. He smiles and looks around them, seeing no Ron, Blaise, or Ivy in his sight. He looks back down at Draco and bites his lip.
"We must follow it; I don't know what else that is," said Harry with a wide smile. "It should lead us right to him." He couldn't wait to find Draco and bring him home. Then he blushed at the word 'home' and having a home with Draco. He pondered what living with Draco is like.
"Harry, you kissed her, remember?" Ginny asks softly, frowning.
"He believes I'll cut off the relationship between him and me because of the article," Harry said with a frown as he doesn't want that either. He wants the relationship with Draco to go on for as long as it can and hopefully that will be for a long time. He wants to get to know more of Draco and to maybe meet his mother and see what she's like.
Pansy frowned and knew that was true. Ivy had somehow turned a quill, a broken piece of table, lipstick and Butterbeer corks into a blade, and an inkpot into disinfectant so she could clean her cuts. "But why did she leave the Yule Ball?"
Draco leaned out of the kiss with a smile. It's been a while since he's actually smiled, and he hopes this won't be his last. But Potter makes him smile, he always could even when he was teasing him. "So, how can I help?"
Harry chuckled at his boyfriend and stroked Draco’s leg that was closest to him. He had a sudden familiar urge, he was hungry for Draco Malfoy again. "Hello, I missed you too, and how was the meeting?" He tried his best to sound casual as he'll leave the certain hungry feeling for a while.
All Draco wanted to do was sit with his boyfriend. Is that too hard to ask? It seems so for the chairs. He straightened his back and crossed his arms over his chest, looking at the chairs like they were a child misbehaving. "How utterly rude."
"Ve should play Quidditch together sometime," Viktor then said as he looked down at Harry. That was easy. It would have been easier to say it in his native language, but the young Gryffindor just doesn't know about the language.
Harry cast a quick "Tempus" and showed that it was around 6:00 in the morning. Frowning to himself, he got up quietly, not wanting to wake anyone up, and sluggishly got dressed in warm clothes. He searched for one of the potion vials in his trunk as he doesn't want to disappoint Draco and feel even worse, and when he grabbed a vile, he drank the whole tube. He then grabbed his invisibility cloak from under his pillow and walked out of the dormitory.
Petunia locks the car after getting the shopping bags from the boot and gestures her son and nephew forward towards Aldi. Of course, Dudley gives Harry a hard smack across the head like always and then catches up to his mother.
"Oh!" Harry said, staring at the Oak door, becoming more intrigued at the thought of what those books in this secret room contain. They could hold the world's secrets, or parchments from the olden times when Archimedes was around. Or even Egyptian secrets like how they mummified their dead. Or these books could tell him about Atlantis, the hidden and sunken city in the sea and if it really was a city which people lived on. "Shall we enter then?"
"Ron and Blaise are dancing together," Harry says when feeling Draco's kiss still lingering on his cheek and neck and he smiles when Draco pressed their foreheads together again. It was a beautiful feeling actually, being close to your lover like this and dancing together. He didn't want this day to end.
"Have fun then, Harry," George said as he walked backwards to the Floo behind him. with one last smile, which faltered as he turned around, he disappeared in the green flames of the Floo.
"Good," Harry said as he continued slicing the chicken. Just a quick glance to the side of him he caught Draco staring at him. He smiled and saw how the blonde's cheeks were becoming a little red which he loved. When Draco smiled at him, he looked back at Neville with a smile. The thought of that heart he saw doodled on Draco's work back in Herbology class flooded his mind and he couldn't stop thinking about it. "If you need help just ask."
Pansy jumped away in fright when the door banged again. Something was inside that door, trying to get out. Out of curiosity, she neared the door and was about to twist the doorknob when a metal thing broke through the door right at her eye level.
Draco shook his head, pulling Harry closer to him by the waist. “I don’t, unfortunately. His stories are cliché and sound a bit to… unreal.”
Pansy rolled her eyes at Draco and decided to leave then. She didn't want to witness anything. Oh... but does this mean they're coming closer to having sex? Whenever that does happen she hopes Draco will tell her so she can give him a 'Congrats for losing your virginity' present to him.
"And Cedric, he iz juzt a friend, too?" Krum asked him. "And what about Drako? That blonde boy you hang around with a lot."
Harry yelled in pain, crying out, wanting someone to help him but he knew he deserved this pain. The second whip of the belt hit Harry on his stomach, he felt like he was going to be sick, so he laid on his stomach and tried to get up. He then knew that was a bad decision because Uncle Vernon then whipped him with the belt on his back before Harry could try and escape.
Draco has definitely not smiled so much in his lifetime. Especially when Voldemort was in power, that time of his years was just scary as hell. But Harry floods him with happiness whenever the Gryffindor smiles at him, or when those green eyes look at him and into his own eyes. This Gryffindor, even throughout his schooling years at Hogwarts, could always make him feel like this. He just ignored these feelings through Hogwarts, though. He knew he shouldn't have.
Harry screamed for help, begging someone to come to find him but all he could muster was a screech. He started crying, feeling more and more tears come from his eyes that ran down his cheeks like a river. He began to shake, tremble, and fall to the ground. He just couldn't take this sight any longer. What happened to them? What kind of monster would do this?
Hannah Abbot, as the Headless Horseman, (Horsewoman, she liked to be called) galloped on her black horse through the corridors of Hogwarts. She had just taken out Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, and Cormac McLaggon. Easy targets. Don't they know that they can use their wands? Honestly, they're scared little cats.
Harry shrugged and Ron snorted. He then sighed as he looked from Harry to Hermione. "Blaise Zabini actually asked me and I kind of panicked and told him I'm going with Lavender which then I had to actually ask her," he said and scratched his head a little, watching his best friend's surprised expression. "I'm going to ditch her anyway so I can talk to Blaise during the evening."
Lucius was still at a loss of words. He didn't know what to say, he couldn't say anything. Narcissa was right, he had been a bad father. How could he not know his own wife cried at night? He frowned at the thought of Draco losing Potter in a war if he did die, the broken look on his son's face would crush his own heart. "I know, I will soon come to accept our son as gay. It may take a while, but I will accept him. Although, I do feel as if we should Pensieve this memory of now and create a fake one in case our friends use their legilimens on us. We can't risk losing our Dragon, nor his love."
Just keep your eyes on me
As he moved his hand away from Harry's groin, Draco felt the gentle probing of a second finger as it traced through the remaining sheen of lubricant and slipped inside. He thrust his hips upwards, hoping to force the fingers deeper, but Harry smiled and drew his hand back, retaining the shallow depth he wanted.
"Of course, I didn't," whispered Cody, now looking at her with an obvious expression. "It's in the dressing room. You didn't forget yours, now, did you?"
"Hello, Luna..." Ginny said, smiling brightly at her. "My morning is perfect now that I'm here with you." she watched the blush rise from Luna's neck which made her feel satisfied. "Would you like to go over to Gryffindor table with me and meet my brothers, Fred and George, as my official girlfriend?"
Harry waited until it was sunset on Sunday afternoon and then got ready to meet Draco after a long day of Wizards Chess with Ron and reading The Hunger Games book Hermione let him borrow. He grabbed his invisibility cloak, a practice snitch, and his broomstick and headed down to the Willow tree. Before he could exit the common room, Hermione gave him a curious look.
He remembered how close he was with Draco. It made him remember a few classes back in Potions and charms, being closer to him made him all warm and fuzzy inside. "I could even see the need in Draco's eyes. He is so flawless, so handsome, like an angel from heaven but more perfect than god could ever create. I just felt like I wanted to be with him all night, in his arms and presence. He's so wonderful, Hermione. He's someone I want to be with forever if that is even possible."
"Oh, it's my pleasure," Molly said sweetly and waving her hand as she needn't an instance of a 'thank you'. "Anyone's welcome for dinner."
"Mmm..." Harry grunted as he buried his face into Draco's crack, licking and slurping at the skin noisily, skirting infuriatingly around the pulsing edges of his anus, but never dipping inside.
"Oh, don't be embarrassed, Draco," Harry said softly and took the last final steps forward until he was at least two feet from Draco. "I have no idea how I am able to help you, but do you at least want a hug?"
Ron stared at his sleeping best mate in worry. He knew Harry had been keeping to himself lately but shook the thought away as it was just probably adolescent moods. But he remembered the nightmare Harry had, remembered hearing him shout in fear because of his uncle. It terrified him to think of the nightmares Harry had been having. They sounded pretty intense. He hadn't talked to Hermione about Harry's nightmare because, well, he just didn't think Harry would want him to. Even if he himself had a disturbing nightmare he would not want it to be shared around.
"Right," said Harry, seeming a little disbelieved. He knows the Malfoy in Draco can never be replaced. He'd still deep within Draco somewhere. "Anyway, we should head back. I don't need a 'Tempus' to tell us it's late."
Draco blinked at Harry and his open mouth. He didn't know why seeing Harry’s mouth filled with his own semen make him feel aroused and hard again. Damn Harry and his sexual ways. “Well, I can’t leave until I’ve given you one too,” he says to the Gryffindor who then eagerly swallows the sticky white semen down his throat. Merlin… “Sit down.” His voice was commanding but gentle.
The girl frowned a little, acknowledging his rude remark. "I wasn't actually wanting an autograph thank you very much," she told him in a firm tone. "I'm not really a fan of yours either. I'm just a girl who's bored and wanting something to do. Sadly, the internet and reception don't work out here either. Not that you would know what the internet is."
Draco raised an eyebrow at the sarcasm from Harry. Was it really necessary though? He didn't think so, and it seemed Harry didn't think so either by the look of shame on his face. He didn't need to feel that way though. "And you're a Gryffindor, makes no sense."
Halloween Night.
To Draco, it was such an intimate, covetous touch. Despite the tight, hot presence of Harry's shaft pumping deep inside him, this tender exploration felt a thousand times more personal. Draco could almost kid himself that Harry's face held an expression of satisfaction, of possession, but in reality, it was a far more intense gaze than that. Draco felt truly naked before those joyous green eyes, as if all his deepest secrets, his every thought and feeling were open for Harry to read. Yet still, Draco felt safe. And that was jarring.
Harry had forgotten that Snape had died. There's just been so much going on, like Fred's funeral and the burial of so many others. It's been a tough week. "I'm really sorry for your loss, Draco," he said, leaning his head on Draco's shoulder. "He was a good man, even if he hated my guts since he first laid eyes on me back in the first year."
"You know when our date is?" asked Harry. But then he felt a little stupid at what he said. Of course, Narcissa would know! Draco probably would have told her. The thought of Draco made him blush, especially when thinking about how Draco would talk to Narcissa about him and the date on Tuesday.
"Still a little sore but I think I can handle another round if that's what we're going to do," Harry tells him while casting a muttered privacy and sound charm around his bed they were in. "Now give your all to me, Draco."
They stay like that for a few more minutes until the drapes around Harry's bed open up like someone had just opened them. But Harry and Draco knew they were cast open by magic, and Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom appeared at the end of the bed with tired smiles on their faces. The light of the sun immediately shone through Harry's bed and onto the faces of Harry and Draco. The Slytherin groaned and turned over, stuffing his face in Harry's neck, smiling with relief as it blocked out the sun and the best part was being able to smell Harry.
"Do you think there will be a giant Snake down there?" Draco asked anxiously when they both entered the door, and he was biting down on his bottom lip as he stared down the stairs into the darkness. There could be something down there watching them and when they get down there it could gobble them up. Of course, that was what was going through Draco's head.
"Yes, very needy," Draco drawled and slipped his hands around Harry's waist, under the Gryffindor robe, and underneath Harry's pants and boxers, getting a good feel of the arse he'll be thrusting into soon. "What took you so long though? Walking up to Gryffindor Tower and then here can't take you nearly fifteen minutes."
Draco sat up on the couch and looked over at Harry. That was... a nice sleep. It felt like he was out for hours, but was he? "How long was I asleep for?"
He sighed as he didn't hear a reply back. He tried again, and again and again. He didn't want to give up but as he never heard a single reply, he frowned and turned around. Harry was about to turn around and turn off the Floo, but as he heard that familiar soft voice, he swiftly turned back around to face... "Narcissa?"
He does admit, Blaise is incredibly...handsome. He has had a few dreams where he's kissed the bloke but thought that he was just confused and needed to have a drink of water. But even after having a glass of water, the bloke fought his way back into Ron's head. Ron was even thinking of having a chat with Fred and George about this since they are older and possibly know a lot more about adolescence and growing up.
As Draco slid upwards and then dropped himself back down the full length of Harry's shaft, he came. His spine bowed with frightening speed, tipping his head back as he cried his orgasm with abandon. The sensations in his body were overwhelming, far too much to absorb at that moment. What he registered most of all, even above the wet, pulsing warmth of his ejaculation were the manic spasms of his muscles inside. Draco's body was like a clamp. Rather than loosening in relaxation, everything inside him pulled tight, clutching at the huge intrusion of Harry's erection almost like it was trying to imprint every vein and curve on his passage walls. His blood thundered round his body.
"Thanks, Pansy and please do, you're a great friend," Draco said. He watched his best friend leave the dorm room. He then headed to the bathroom to change into his Pajamas, brush his teeth and jumped back in bed. Merlin, the pillows smelt of Harry. His bed will never feel the same again since it had Harry lay down on it, with a flushed face and a dripping cock covered in semen.
"Got yourself a girlfriend did you, Potter?" he asked and smirked at Potter. Deep down, Draco wished that weren't true. He hoped that wasn't true. He'd ask his own father to kill him on the spot than have his heart broken into pieces like that.
"Do you really have to go?" Potter asked, nearly sounding almost whiny. Why the hell did he have to sound like that? It wasn't impressive or attractive in any sort of way. He didn't want to sound babyish either.
"I think it wants us to go right," said Blaise, not taking his eyes off the killer who death stared at him. Merlin, these things were creepy. But he was stabbed so how could he be alive?
Harry Potter, the boy who lived, grew curious to why Draco Malfoy has been disappearing off the Marauders Map every Friday afternoon at around six o'clock. So, being obviously suspicious, he decided to follow the blonde snake after a quick dinner with Hermione and Ron.
Harry had no idea what he just saw. It was muggle magic but in Hogwarts. How did those two do all that? It seemed impossible without a wand. Sighing, he decides to go find Hermione and Ron since they did go off to lunch without him half an hour ago.
"I'm glad you enjoyed it, Harry," Draco says and for fun, threw a grape over at him. Instead of it hitting Harry somewhere, he actually caught it in his mouth. It surprised Draco a little, so he did it again and watched as Harry caught the grape in his mouth again. "You can catch the Snitch in the field quite easily by hand, but it appears you can do it by mouth too."
He winced at how hurtful the pinch was but knew then that this was real. He had kissed Harry Potter, the wizarding world’s Golden boy. He had bloody kissed him!
"Oh, okay," Draco said and gave Harry a little wave goodbye. He hopes to see Harry soon. Maybe in a few hours. "Bye, Harry!"
"But Malfoy's don't cry. We can't show fear," Draco muttered while looking up into emerald green eyes.
As soon as Moody saw Professor McGonagall a corridor away he finally agreed to levitate the ferret into Ivy's hands. "Alright, you lot," he grumbled at the students surrounding the courtyard. "Clear off, clear off!" He steered all the students in the courtyard to go elsewhere, leaving just Harry, Ivy and Draco the ferret alone together.
Draco knew his father could see the slight red tinge to his cheeks, but that didn't matter. "It's Ivy," he said earnestly with a smirk. "I know. Just playing with you."
Cedric smiled as he caught Harry staring at him and he led Harry down towards the closest set of trees, nearest to the stadium. "So, uh..." He paused, looking towards a tree. "Let's sit under this tree."
It was the Italian boy again, holding two plates with a wrap on each. Before the boy could say anything, Draco interrupted him by grabbing the plates from the boy and placed one in front of Harry and the other in front of himself. He shooed the boy away from their table with a flick of his wrist.
Ron looked up at the blackboard and shook his head, "Nope. Just noticed it now thanks to you."
"Yes, son, were nearly at the portkey," shouted Mr Weasley, who was in front of the other Weasleys and Harry. He was lying as there still was another five and a half miles to travel by foot. He just had to shut his son up somehow.
Harry did not disappoint him. The tip of his tongue inched inside the twitching opening by minute increments before making a final sharp stab to thrust all the way inside as far as it could go. Draco bellowed his aroused shock into the heavy atmosphere and Harry matched the sound with one of his own, exhaling scorching hot breaths onto Draco's body.
As Harry was out flying the Dragon from who knows where Draco began to remember back when he first got to meet Harry. When he first met him in Madam Malkin's Robe shop, he remembered that his heartbeat was beating faster than ever. That day, he actually thought that he was having a panic attack, but now he knows what that feeling is. Draco smiled to himself, feeling that familiar beat of his heart quicken as he was thinking about Harry Potter. Even then, he didn't know he was actually meeting Harry Potter. But he always used his Malfoy Mask to hide his true emotions, because according to his father 'Malfoys don't show their emotions'. Draco blames it on his father and how he wants the Malfoys to be these perfect pureblooded wizards.
Harry didn't understand why his heart was thumping hard against his chest as he leaned forward, or even the butterfly feeling in his stomach which was only producing more butterflies which fluttered around his stomach. But these feelings were...good. He liked these weird feelings. They felt so natural and utterly wonderful!
"And why not?" Blaise asked him, then he started chuckling because these boys just don't see beyond their conversations or the lines. He doesn't know Potter that well, but he knows the conversations between Potter and Draco must have a little bit of flirting. "Come on, Draco. You should know if Harry's into you. We are Slytherins. If we want something or someone, we go for them."
He got up and crept down into the empty common room, looking down at the Christmas tree filled with the familiar wizard decorations. He sighed miserably and stared under the tree, seeing more presents piled up underneath the dark green leaves. The Dursleys never got him presents for Christmas, not even his birthday. It was miserable. The only time he was given Christmas was in his first year with Ron as he stayed at Hogwarts.
Harry remembered the talk with Fred at the Quidditch World Cup and how they had a chat about sexuality, how Fred and his twin were Pansexual and how Harry was more into guys than he was of girls. He remembered locking lips with Fred that night and remembered how George found out and how he kept asking how it all happened.
Now it was Harry's turn to blush. Draco wasn't meant to compliment him. He then smiled when realizing there was still a game to play. "Ivy, Truth or Dare."
Harry placed a chicken wing, a square of lasagna and some curried eggs on his plate. If Draco never gave Harry the eating disorder thing potion, he'd be feeling super sick by looking at these foods. He wolfed down only half of what was on his plate as he felt a bit full after eating as much as he could. He then exited the Grand Hall to get the egg, Marauders Map, a towel, and his Pajamas just to see if Cedric was right about the egg.
"I'm fully into guys. So, I'm gay," Draco replied automatically. He was smiling brightly as he knew he could have a chance with Harry. He just had to find out if Harry liked him back which was the number one question he had to ask.
Harry shook his head swiftly, looked over to see a mischief smiling Dudley and got into his cupboard, doing what he was told. He backed himself up against the wall but didn't see Uncle Vernon at all, it was rare to see him not lock the cupboard door after Harry did something bad. Then it hit Harry, he knew what was coming next. He started to shake and felt tears burn in his eyes, he hugged his legs with his arms and sat there in silence. In a matter of seconds, Uncle Vernon was back at the cupboard door with a belt in his hands. The next thing Harry felt was the raw belt slap him across the arm. Harry yelled in pain, feeling another whip of the belt on the same arm. He turned to his side and held his throbbing arm with his other hand to the wall and hid it from Uncle Vernon. He felt another whip of the belt but on his back, and another and another until Uncle Vernon smiled with pleasure and locked the cupboard with a sobbing Harry inside.
"It's fine," Fred said, and his smile grows. "You have to listen to the beats in the music, you just don't start moving." He tried his hardest to help Harry learn how to dance even if his toes kept getting squashed by Harry. He didn't weight a lot so that wasn't a problem. "1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and begin...Listen to the music, follow the beat of the music..." Finally, after about fifteen minutes, Harry was starting to get a hold of the dancing.
"No, don't ask Pansy to do that," Harry said, shaking his head at the suggestion. But he understood why Draco doesn't exactly want to go with him all because of his father. "I don't want your friend to go to the Yule Ball dateless." He knows Pansy and Draco are just friends which relieved him, and he is sure Pansy isn't into Draco. Well, he hoped Pansy wasn't into Draco.
"I don't know about you but I'm definitely hungry," Draco says, and he squeezes their linked hands together. He can feel his stomach rumbling for food and Harry's kisses. "I could eat a whole cow!"
He shifted his hips upward as Harry's hands gripped the waistband of his underwear and tugged them down, exposing his erection, then his thighs. He could feel Harry's eyes on him. It was like they burned a path into him, but the burn was inside, not on the surface. Just the thought that he might soon know the pleasure of Harry's tongue licking his slit and the feel of the soft wetness of his mouth along his shaft made a heavy bead of clear fluid ooze out of him and hang suspended for a second before it fell in a steady trickle and puddled in his boxers.
Now Teddy was giggling too as he leaned away. But then Harry's watch started beeping, and Teddy frowned, knowing that meant his godfather had to go. He hugged him tightly, not wanting Harry to go. "Hawwy, please don't go."
Draco looks beside him at Harry and stands up, giving Harry his hand to take. He didn't need to say anything as Harry places his hand over Draco's and he waits for Harry to move off the chair. When he does, Draco leads him to the middle of the Great Hall, and they face each other. For a brief moment, they just stare fondly into each other's eyes. Then Draco reached his hands up and holds Harry's face in his hands, tilts his head and slowly started leaning towards him.
Harry sighed, not wanting to leave Draco. He wants to spend more time with this bloke more than anything. He wants to get to know Draco, to find out his interests and what Quidditch Team he goes for. "Until we meet again, Draco Malfoy."
When in the Slytherin 4th year boy's dormitory, he searched his trunk for his own nail clippers. He picked up the grey nail clippers from in a little compartment and checked his own nails out just to be sure his own nails weren't sharp. Perfect as always with no pointy or sharp edges. He smiled and headed down into the common room to find his sharp clawed friend.
That Saturday, Harry watched Cedric and Joshua leave the Hogwarts grounds with intertwined hands from behind a tapestry in a courtyard. He smiled weakly at them and wished he had someone to go out with too. Well, a particular whitish blonde haired Slytherin wizard.
Draco gave Harry a curious look and pointed his wand at the door and muttered, "Apertio!" Obviously, it was this spell. They both watched as the door opened, revealing green torch lights similar to the Slytherin ones on a wall in front of them. Whatever this hallway was, it wasn't going forwards. It actually was going to the right, so they had to walk through the doorframe and turn right which there were a few stairs going down into darkness.
Harry played around with his birds, feeding them even if it was just a conjuring spell. He looked over at Ron and noticed his Indian Minor birds are getting all feisty. He smiled and looked over at Draco. As soon as Draco saw Harry staring, he winked at him. Harry turned to pet his cockatoos with a blush on his face.
"Nothing, it's just. Who do you think will win?" Ron asked quickly, hoping for an answer straight away. "Ireland or the Bulgarians?" What Harry wanted to know was how could someone be this excited during the night?
"Sure," Luna said and reached out for Ginny's hand, twining their hands together while ignoring the giggles coming from all around them. "I would love to. Let's go."
Harry grabbed a hold of Draco's legs and sluggishly pushed them forward. At first, when Harry nudged the head of his cock past Draco's entrance, Draco felt as if he were splitting apart at the seams. He tensed, then forced himself to relax, and concentrated on the look of pure pleasure creasing Harry's face as he pushed himself into Draco. His muscles were taut and his eyes were starred with a brilliancy that made Harry suddenly shudder with the yearning to take him in, be taken over by him, to be in him, to be, to, to a thousand things at once.
"Nobody can get passed Dumbledore's age line, not unless they're 17 or older," Harry said tiredly and resting his head on his knees. He was tired of having to answer the same question repeatedly, especially if it was something he didn't do.
Draco looked to the ground, blushing, and Harry looked up at the Professor's table, seeing all the Professor's staring at them. He smiled at them all, and then he turns his head and looks at the entrance to the Great Hall, seeing Ron just standing there and staring at him. Did Ron see everything in these past minutes? He didn't mind if Ron did see the kiss though.
Just like every morning, the owls swooped into the Great Hall. Hedwig flew down with a reply from Sirius and landed on the table next to Harry. Harry smiled at his bird pal and retrieved the letter from her beak, "Thanks, Hedwig." He gave Hedwig a bit of toast and stuffed his envelope in his robe pocket.
"We have dinner arrangements with the Weasley's this afternoon," Draco reminded his mother. Honestly, he's a little anxious to go because the Weasley's are like Harry's family and he wants to make a good impression of himself and his family in front of them.
Draco smiled into the kiss and kissed back passionately, not wanting to let go either. When they began running out of air, they slowly let go of the kiss and stared into each other's eyes. "What was that for?"
Draco smiled at Harry and nodded quickly, really wanting this. "Yes, Harry Potter. You literally have no idea how long I've wanted to... go out with you." He's been wanting this for a very long time. Whenever he sees Harry with other girls or boys something insides him wakes up and hisses. He's always just wanted to put a hand around Harry's waist, or hold his hand and walk away with him to someplace private for a snogging session. It seems he can now do that.
To this day, he still doesn't know what man that's his heart's desire smells like Citrus, apples and Vanilla. Obviously, Hermione had told Ron that she smelt Ron in the Potion, but he doesn't know if Ron had told her of what he smelt. Ron actually never told Harry what he smelt, so that made him curious to what he did smell. But Harry knew Hermione's shampoo smelt of watermelon. So, he guessed Ron could smell that.
"We Slytherins kind of have the same mechanism," said Draco, but he laughed a little at the way the Slytherin's have to deal with if they dare try and cross into the other gender's dormitories. "We can't go to the girl's dormitories, not even though the tunnel without it burning the hair off our heads or we get blown into the wall behind us. This one kid learnt his lesson last year. He was mortified about losing all his hair and having a back injury at the same time. It's the same with the girls too. The only way you can go into the other sexes dormitories is if you're holding their hands."
{True love.} Draco bit his lip when watching Harry lick his lips, making those pink lips that look so mesmerizing to touch wet. Why must Harry make him feel this way? The warm fluttery feeling inside is only intensifying, and his heart was beating at a rapid pace that he feels like he has just run a... what are they called? Those muggle things where they run for ages? Merephans? Whatever...
“I would love to meet your friends, Draco,” said Harry. As he saw the impatience on Mr Malfoy’s face, he sighed and dropped his arms from Draco’s neck. His arms were now falling to his side, and he stepped back. “Mebi oso na hit choda op nodotaim.”
"Thank you for tonight, Draco," he said, smiling. "It was brilliant!"
Harry frowns and really wishes a car can come speeding through the car park and hit him hard enough to kill him. While scratching at his cuts from underneath his sleeve, he slowly catches up to his relatives and follows them inside. As instructed to like always, he grabs a shopping cart and begins the slow journey of following his aunt around Aldi, only stopping when she puts items in the trolley.
As Harry knows Draco's about to leave, he looks down at his right hand at the ring that belongs to Draco's family. He slides it off and opens the palm of Draco's hand. He was going to put the ring in the centre of Draco's palm but the Slytherin had other plans. When Draco spreads apart his fingers for Harry, this gives Harry the idea on what Draco wants and so he slides the Malfoy ring on Draco's ring finger.
Pansy and Hermione both blushed as they looked away from each other. "No," Pansy said as she shook her head. Although she wished it was true. "We're not dating, yet." She gave Hermione a little wink just to tell her she definitely wants to get with her. She has been giving Hermione hints ever since the Yule Ball.
Ron hugged his best mate, really thinking hard about these nightmares his best mate was having. First, they were dreams about Voldemort and now dreams about his own family? Bloody hell! What was happening to his friend? He really was pondering about asking his mother about this nightmare. Maybe she could help Harry?
"Oh Harry," Fred said sweetly with a hand over his heart. "I'm flattered!" He fluttered his ginger eyelashes at Harry and took the last step closer to him.
Narcissa's frown grew a little. Finally, he is starting to see everything now! She nodded at him. "He never wore his mask around me, and I found out about his sexuality one time when we went shopping. I noticed he wasn't staring at all the pretty girls who walked by. He kept his eyes on the men walking the streets, they mostly resemble Harry though. Black hair and glasses. I even caught him staring at a boys' bottom who looked the same age as him." She held back a chuckle. "That is how I knew; you have to spend time with our Dragon to get to know him. He's not our little boy anymore, he's becoming a grown man. By spending time with him, he will start to warm up to you, trust you more," she said with a hint of a smile. She knew how much her Dragon loved Harry; it was just so obvious. Even by the way he writes about him in his letters to her.
Harry nodded again, liking that idea. Good lord, he needs the help in Potions otherwise he will be failing the class in a matter of months. He doesn't actually want that. He wants to pass so he can get a good enough job. "That sounds very fair."
Even though he loved endlessly staring at Draco, he reminded Harry of an angel. One of God's beautiful angels from heaven, even though he wasn't a Christian. But Harry believed Draco was even more beautiful than one of god's angels. He believed Draco was the definition of beautiful and perfect. No, he is the definition of beautiful and perfect.
"Now, please try your best to not smell the plant, as it will make you sneeze a lot," the professor warned her class. "And write a detailed description of the Sneezewort on your parchments please."
"I love you so much, Harry," Draco said as he looked back up into the eyes of his lover, placed the card back in the box and shut it closed. He immediately wrapped his arms around Harry tightly and kissed him on the cheek, the neck, the lower neck, his earlobe. Just anywhere his lips could reach. "I love the gift. It's so thoughtful and romantic. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart."
Harry's mouth stayed unmoving for long moments, but he sucked and sucked until all Draco could feel was the most arousing constriction pressing over the head of his cock, and he watched Harry's lips grow paler as he pursed them harder and harder, imprinting every single contour of Draco's glans and his retracted foreskin on the inside of his mouth. His teeth were gritted with the tension, and the pressure only subsided and eased away when Harry released his suction and slid his mouth further down.
Harry looked back at him sadly but tried to suppress it with annoyance. He couldn't let his best mate see what he really is. A freak. "No... I just have a nightmare of seeing it happen," he told him just to shut him out of the conversation. "It's normal, Ron. Please, come off it!"
Harry wiped his sweater sleeve over the top left corner of his mouth and looked down at his sleeve. He didn't see anything sticky on his sweater but thought that lemon jam wouldn't leave a kind of mess or mark. "Did I get it?"
He remembered everything his Dragon had told him about Harry Potter, 'Wonderful Potter, with his scar, smile and his broomstick'. How could he be so blind? Draco was masking his true feelings in front of his own father, and possibly his mother. He now knew in between those lines, that there was a boy who masked his true feelings, a boy who found love. Lucius sighed and looked back up at his wife, "Did you know about our son's true feelings for the boy? Did Draco mask his feelings in front of you too or is it just me?"
"Yeah?" Harry asked distractedly as he was getting lost looking at the mountains in the distance. The distraction was actually Draco, but he didn't want it to be obvious. He didn't want Draco finding out about his little crush on him.
"C'mon, let's just head to breakfast," Hermione said, and she placed a hand on his back, just hoping the little gesture will help him. She offered him a small smile and started heading to the Great Hall with Harry by her side.
"Yes, Granger," Draco said with a strong nod. "And, he and I will hopefully be going out when this whole thing ends. So, you'll both be seeing more of me in the future."
Ron frowned at his best mate, "Harry, look at me!"
Harry looked over at Hermione and she saw his reaction and came over to him. She gave him a big hug and reassured him that everything will be okay. "At least he apologized," she told him softly. "And he doesn't seem to mind that you're with Draco."
"Hello, Master Harry Potter," said Dobby in his normal excited tone when seeing the person who freed him. "How can Dobby be at service to Harry Potter?"
Blaise muttered the password under his breath and the secret passageway opened, revealing a green-lighted common room. As much as he likes hearing Draco and Harry flirting, he would rather get back up to the dorm and read the book about the latest fashion trends his mother got him. Ivy smiled at the recording as she will definitely show Pansy this and show Draco later with Pansy so they can tease him about it. She stops the recording but keeps her phone out in her hands.
Hermione nodded at her best friend, and she was literally squealing on the inside that they finally hugged. "Yes. It's me who just witnessed the two of you hugging," She said and raised an eyebrow at the Slytherin. She was just so happy for Harry but hiding it with just a smile. "Have I also missed out on seeing a snogging session as well?"
Draco shook his head, and so did Harry. They had no idea she wore contact lenses. "We never knew of this, Madam Pomphrey," Draco informed her, lying to her face though he knew Harry didn't know if this. Perhaps sending Ivy here was too dangerous. "I've never seen her put contact lenses in at all. I thought those eyes were real."
"Heeeeey, those are my eggs you little sneaky bugger!" Draco said with a prolonged 'e', swatting Harry's hands away as he quickly ate the rest of his eggs and was thinking of a plan to get Harry back. Maybe tonight in bed h can get Harry back a different way.
"That's even worse!" Draco answered seriously and couldn't believe the names the poor lady gets told or hears every day. It's saddening. She could have been someone's mother or grandmother. Nobody wants to be called named behind their backs or even in front of themselves. He knows this.
"I don't know what that was... but anyway...where were we? Ah, yes," Voldemort said, aiming his wand at Harry.
And in your eyes, you are holding mine
Draco stared back into those brilliant Emerald Green eyes of Harry Potter. He gives a fake and dramatic sigh." Oh, poor Harry Potter," he teased with a smirk on his lips.
Draco sighed and rubbed his thumb over Harry's lips, "I love you so much, Harry," he said, letting a tear fall down his face. "No matter what. I'll always love you. So please, if you ever need to talk to me about anything, I am here for you." He watched as Harry slightly nodded and he wished he could just look through this boy's mind and see what he's thinking so he could try to understand and help as much as he could. His heart fluttered and his cheeks blushed as Harry wiped the tear from his eye with his thumb and kissed his cheek. At least he knew Harry was still capable of showing and giving love, even if his demeanour was so damned numb and lifeless.
"Bye!" Blaise and Ivy said and gave the two little waves.
Harry looked up at Draco in disbelief, into those silver eyes which gleamed with an inner light and an emotion Harry couldn't pick up. His heartbeat picked up speed until it was hammering against his chest. Did Draco really mean that... No, it's just the love of a friend. Not anything else. But he was grateful that Draco was telling him this. It didn't exactly help that much but it kind of gave him hope.
Draco quickly stood to the side of the door in case there was something inside the room and he reached a hand beside him where Harry was, guarding the Gryffindor with his life. He waited a few seconds, hearing if there was any noise coming from the room and sighed in relief. Harry smiled at the Slytherin protecting him, which he really didn't need, and pointed his wand towards the room and muttered, "Lumos Maxima!" Draco still stood to the side again, just for precaution and to protect Harry.
The tiny professor dressed as a scary Leprechaun merely chuckled and hopped back in his cauldron. "Sorry about that, Mr Thomas," said Flitwick softly. "So, how many students have been taken out?"
"Thanks, Draco," Harry said with an embarrassed smile and a flush crept across his cheeks. He cleared his throat and thought of Draco feeding him again which actually didn't sound too bad. It's weird to admit but he likes Draco feeding him. It's like couples do except he and Draco aren't together. The thought of it put a smile on his face. He and Draco have only kissed twice but on the cheek a few times. He'd do anything to get another kiss from Draco and to feel the slide of his lips on his own.
Ron nodded his head; he had been platting Ginny's hair when she was younger. It was fun and it was a part of how they got along as kids. "Sure thing, mate. Do you know what you want your hair to look like? Like... Slicked back, undercut, et cetera."
Harry looked from Neville and back to his boyfriend. He was surprised at his dormmate. "Did you see Neville kissing Ron and then Blaise coming after him?" he asked with a gleam of excitement in his eye. "I honestly thought Neville was going to die of anxiety then."
And then Draco kissed Harry's cheek, causing Harry to feel a sudden heating sensation in his cheeks and he smiled. The blonde Slytherin's kiss still lingering on his cheeks and it was so calming, so natural.
"Potter! This is not the time and place. And I'll have you know that it is obvious to me you were a flame since first-year.
"Yeah, Same," Draco says and he looks down at the vial in Harry's hand. He hesitates and bites his lip. "Pass me the vial, please?" he asks him sweetly, quickly runs a hand through his hair and extends out his arm to Harry.
"Oh!" Harry looked at the familiar wall that he went through back in the second year. He understands that Draco still wants the password to be a secret. "Sorry, not at all!" Before leaving, he quickly gave Draco a hug and left with a big smile on his face. It's still quite rare for him to smile.
Lavender nodded excitingly, biting her lip. "EEEEEEK!" she squealed as she couldn't believe that just happened. She could have hugged her professor but didn't want to get into trouble from it. "Thank you, Professor. I will, I will give it the life of royalty."
Harry felt his face burn deeper with the same blush. Where are some eggs? He will literally try cooking some eggs on his face right now. But he doesn't want his classmates laughing at him if that does actually happen. "Thank you," he mumbled, still staring at the table in front of them.
Draco stopped and looked back at her, a little annoyed. What is it now? Honesty, he just wants to find Harry and make sure he is doing well.
Draco was entranced, now sucking gently on the head of Harry's dick while he felt Harry's grip tighten harshly in his hair, nails scratching at his scalp. It was a pleasurable pain that made the hairs stand up on Draco's arms, a swooping sensation in his stomach.
"Oh, I remember that day," said Draco, pointing out to the Hippogriff. "Harry was being annoying and amazing at the same time when riding the Hippogriff." But what he didn't understand was why Harry was brunette on the tv and had blue eyes. Where's that messy black hair gone ad those gorgeous emerald green eyes?
"Good!" said Harry with a strict nod. If that girl did anything to his Draco... she will definitely regret it. But he trusts Draco to tell the truth. "Otherwise, she'll regret it."
"You're welcome?" Harry asked and was uncertain about why Draco was thanking him. What exactly did he do? "But why are you thanking me? I didn't do anything."
"That sounds like a plan," Harry said with a nod of agreement and moved closer to his boyfriend. He began thinking about the maze and what's in it too. Could it be a nice lovely maze with a gazebo in the centre, or could it be a scary maze with monsters on it? He hoped for the first option. He knows muggle mazes can be creepy. Especially corn mazes during the night.
Seamus stared down at his pancake and started, "So, this was during the Christmas holidays last year in our third year. Dean asked me over for Christmas with his family and of course, how could anybody ever say naw?" He saw Dean smile down at his own strawberry syrup covered pancake. "And it was one afternoon, we were outside having a snowball fight with his siblings and I was walking backwards with a handful of snowballs in my arms and... bam!" He clapped his palms together to signify how hard he fell. "I fell on top of Dean, we were so close to each other, our noses just touching and our lips only inches apart. I looked Dean deep in his beautiful chocolate brown eyes and saw the most beautiful thing. Well, of course, I've always seen something beautiful in my Dean." He kissed Dean's warm blushing cheek, which caused his boyfriend to chuckle. "Then we kissed, it was so..."
