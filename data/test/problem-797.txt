When fresh drinks were presented to them, they both silently sipped and stared across the bar. Of course, Draco was really only watching Harry through the mirrored back of the shelves holding various bottles of spirits.
Slightly cold fingers wrapped around Harry’s wrist, pulling him out of his thoughts. “Hey,” Draco said softly, “I don’t have to tell him, but I know my mother will.”
He could have sworn he saw a white-blonde head turning to stare up at the Weasley clan right before he took off.
“Fuck,” Harry muttered. He had to make a decision. Either he could fly to the ground and pause the game, or he could keep playing with only one arm.
happen again. How did it even happen in the first place?” Potter seemed to wonder that last part to himself, before taking one last, almost longing, look at Draco and fleeing. Draco wouldn’t chase after him. He never did that kind of thing. But for once he didn’t think he’d mind if someone he’d shagged stayed over. If Potter stayed.
He sensed Potter walking up behind him and felt a light touch on his elbow. “I wouldn’t miss it,” he said quietly, his fingers slipping down Draco’s forearm and then squeezing his hand lightly. “I’m going to go chat with Ron in his office.”
Harry looked to the ceiling, desperately hoping it held the answer as to why things like this always happened to him. All he had wanted to do was buy his godson a birthday gift, and now he’s suddenly a property owner. How does that even happen?
Potter’s distrusting expression did not change. In fact, Potter didn’t seem to react at all, so Draco decided it would be best to continue the apology. “I was a right pillock back at Hogwarts. Especially fourth and fifth year, I know. Look, I’m not asking for forgiveness, I just want you to know I’m sorry for what I did. I’m sorry for what Voldemort made me do.”
Malfoy’s lips were moving wordlessly as he focused, a strand of pale hair falling in his eyes as he hunched over. Harry briefly wished he could push it back, then shook those thoughts away.
It had been quite a while since Harry had felt so… energized. He felt like he could handle five of the most intense quidditch practices in a row or start a charity or reinvent the wheel. Something big and magical and amazing. Part of him felt like he was starting a whole new life. Something about kissing Draco, having genuine fun with Draco, instead of the low-blow insults they had exchanged in what now felt like their previous lives. Something about that made Harry unconditionally cheerful.
charm considering how loud the music was. Both Draco and Potter turned to look, and Potter immediately smiled and waved at whoever had called over to him. Draco turned back to stare at Potter, waiting for him to return to their conversation, but Potter, it seemed, was not nearly as interested as Draco wished he was. Mere seconds later, Potter had his coat slung over his arm.
Potter glanced back into the kitchen and replied, “I mean the cutoff was supposed to be a few days ago but if it’s not a big order we can probably squeeze it in.”
“I did,” Harry confirmed, finally screwing the first shelf into place before he had to start the next one.
Harry paused and thought for a moment. “I think I’d like to go alone this first time,” he glanced at his friend to gauge her reaction, and continued when she seemed fine. “I just want to establish a connection with it and then I can bring you guys.”
. Though, Harry was never comfortable being addressed quite so formally anyway. Malfoy’s tone was merely professional, not a single hint of sarcasm or anger in sight. Harry was impressed, considering how he and Malfoy had gone toe-to-toe several times during that eighth year at Hogwarts, nearly getting them both expelled at one point.
The burrow was as crowded as ever when he arrived, with the usual crowd of kids running in and out of the house and a pickup quidditch game going on in the backyard. Harry opened the door as Victoire, followed by what looked like a harried Fleur. She stopped to give him a kiss on each of his cheeks and a hug before running after her daughter.
“How would you even know that? We’ve barely spoken since the war. Hell, we never spoke then, only fought. Who are you to say whether I’ve changed?”
He pushed himself up, sitting back on his legs and tugging Potter’s pants off. Potter’s prick, heavy and flushed, laid against his belly, leaking at the tip. Draco kicked off his own trousers and pants and closed the distance between them again, dragging his lips up the slope of Potter’s neck.
Draco rocked their hips together, feeling the hardness of Potter’s prick through the layers of fabric. Potter gasped, their lips parting for mere seconds before finding each other again. Potter’s hands slid down Draco’s sides, tickling his ribs and making him shiver, before they landed on his belt buckle. Before he could even blink, Potter had his trousers undone and was shoving the fabric down his legs, as far as he could reach without breaking the kiss. Potter’s fingers curled around Draco’s prick, giving it a firm stroke to the tip and making Draco whine against his lips.
Harry nodded and quickly shut the door before the woman could make any more eyes at him. Draco’s glare rivaled even Snape’s. He felt like he had just received a month’s worth of detention. He assumed Draco was just being professional and didn’t really appreciate how Harry kept barging in on his workdays, but then again, when it was just the two of them Draco never really seemed to mind.
“It’s alright,” Draco replied, trying not to smile at the hilarious way that Harry was walking. His ankles seemed to wobble with every step and he clung tighter to Draco’s arm the closer they got to their destination. Draco had a fleeting thought of a baby deer trying to walk for the first time after being born. In the effort to not look drunk, Harry was taking overly cautious steps that backfired, making him look like a lunatic. “I even have a few ideas on retail space, if he’s still looking for it that is. And if he’d accept my help as well, I suppose.”
A bludger suddenly broke through the cluster of people and brooms at the other side of the pitch and looked like it was heading their way. Harry shouted, “Look out!” but the ball was coming too fast. Barnaby, who had been trying to clear his glasses, couldn’t move in time. As a last resort, Harry steered his broom in front of the bludger. The ball struck him in his left shoulder, making him cry out, and then bounded off for the other side of the pitch. Pain bloomed in his shoulder, all the way down to the tip of his index finger. He hunched over on his broom and tried to breath through the stabbing sensation.
The pub was packed the next time Draco found himself there, a local Wizard band Draco vaguely recognised gracing the stage and filling the pub with music that automatically made one nod their head to the beat.
his uniform, but the mud left brown stains on all the white patches of his clothes. After a few more attempts, he simply waved his wand to clean up his face and glasses and opened the door. He really wished he’d stopped to shower before coming here.
Around a year ago, Harry had joined a minor league quidditch team. He had missed being on his broom during that last year of school, since eighth years weren’t able to join their house teams. He now had matches almost every Saturday during the season. He had bought himself another Firebolt for this purpose, despite newer models arriving in stores.
“Please talk to us if you feel like closing up. I know you don’t need babying, but remember when you found that other letter in Sirius’ old room?” Harry flinched at his godfather’s name. Hermione walked over to him and gave him a tight hug. “We will be there for you, so don’t shut us out.”
Potter didn’t exactly surprise Draco anymore. When they were kids, teenagers, Potter could easily hit Draco with a comeback, sneak into the Slytherin carriage to eavesdrop on them, and have a Stinging Hex placed on him so his face was unrecognisable as he found himself caught in Malfoy Manor. And the things Draco heard he did during the war as well, like successfully casting the Cruciatus Curse on Amycus Carrow, breaking into Gringotts and escaping on the back of a dragon, and so on. But nowadays, Draco thought, Potter had become predictable. He’d bought himself a house close to where Draco knew the Weasley’s resided, joined the Auror force at the Ministry, and was almost married, although he broke it off within a month of the wedding.
Smirk forming across his face, Draco replied, “Well, I’m the heir of the Malfoy fortune. I like to spend my days collecting vases and—”
The living room furniture was replaced with cushy sofas and recliner chairs. The wood from the old kitchen table was repurposed into frames of pictures of Harry, Hermione, and Ron, the original Order of the Phoenix, the Weasley family, and a picture of his parents., all of which were hanging in the living room. Harry had wanted to keep the table, but it was falling apart. He replaced all the showers, toilets, and doors (except for Sirius’ and Regulus’). Harry made sure Kreacher was permanently placed in the Hogwarts kitchens while he did these renovations, otherwise he was sure the old elf would die on the spot.
Harry choked on his cake, coughing and sputtering before bursting out laughing. “No way,” he wheezed, “one of
“I could have figured it out on my own,” she quickly defended, and then softly, “but yes Ron told me.”
Also hung up on the wall of the living room was his old broomstick, a Firebolt whose branches were frayed and broken after so many years of use. The handle of it had broken in two places. He’d dropped it when Death Eaters had attacked them on the journey from Surrey to the Weasley residence, but went back after the war to look for it. By his luck, it had been in the backyard of a sweet old muggle woman, who had merely waved to him from her kitchen window while he trespassed on her yard.
“Magical Deeds and Realty. The left corridor, at the end.” Harry nodded his thanks and backed away towards the corridor, before turning completely and disappearing from view. He walked down the hallway, wishing that it hadn’t been raining outside as his trainers were now squeaking against the waxed floor. Every step could be heard echoing through the corridor.
“Sorry,” he said again. “Um…is there an address listed? I never knew it existed before now. Do you think it will be…uh, never mind.”
Ron, Hermione, and Harry said their goodbyes to Bippy and the manor house nearly an hour later, Harry with the vow to return and not only investigate but try to clean up the place and see what he would be working with. He wasn’t going to let the house sit and look like that. Especially knowing that he himself was capable of getting the place up and running.
What would he do if there was nothing left? It’s possible he could rebuild, but he had no memory of ever being in this place. There was no way he could restore it to its former glory. At least, his imagination made it seem glorious. For all he knew, it could look like the Burrow. That’d be nice. Cozy shag rugs surrounded by mismatched couches and chairs, the essence of functionality.  Or it could look like Malfoy Manor, dark marbled floors with rooms that held nothing but a few sculptures to take up space. Not that he’d exactly gotten a clean look around the place when he had last been there.
Weasley smirked at him and then returned to the safety of his office, leaving the rest of them to return to their cubicles. Draco walked back to his desk, sighing as he sat down behind the pile of paperwork.
Harry traveled back and forth from Gringott’s to his new manor a total of four times that day, each time walking back into Malfoy’s office even more agitated than before. “I’ve asked nicely, I’ve used spells, I’ve tried begging, and I even tried touching my blood to the gate, and I’ve gotten nothing!” he ranted, pulling up a chair opposite Malfoy and sitting with a huff. “Maybe it’s not meant to be mine.”
It took Draco several moments to move off Potter, pressing gentle kisses to Potter’s sweat-covered body, before bonelessly collapsing into the pillows at the head of the bed. Potter laid next to him, catching his breath, staring at the ceiling. Assuming Potter was overthinking what had just happened, Draco reached out to touch his shoulder.
“James....Right…” He was at a loss for words, mouth opening and closing every so often, but void of sound.
The room was quiet for a while as Draco began to doze off, light, half-snores emitting from his mouth. Harry sighed as he stared at his reflection in the dark muggle television. The fire was burning out and Harry watched as his own green eyes grew dimmer in the reflection until the whole room was near pitch black.
job, especially for what the Ministry called a “reformed Death Eater”. Harry couldn’t jeopardize that by being
Harry’s smile didn’t falter. “Pretty fitting for us, I’d argue. Draco, I don’t really care how the date went or what happened during it. I got to hold your hand and make you smile and that’s all that matters to me.”
Potter’s head pulled back so fast it thumped against the wall behind him, but that didn’t slow him down. His lips found the pulse point on Draco’s neck, scraping his teeth against it while his hips ground up into Draco’s hand. Draco’s knee wedged between Potter’s legs, pressing the shorter man fully against the wall.
Harry, caught up in the memory of holding Malfoy in a headlock, struggled to come up with a semi-intellectual response. However, speaking to Malfoy without sounding like an idiot had never been his strong suit, as he simply blurted out, “I have a house!”
“I only invited you because…well, I wanted to stop myself from…” Harry stopped short, staring up into Malfoy’s eyes. “I-“ he tried again, but the words wouldn’t come. He could not look away from Malfoy. His eyes darted from his chin to his eyebrows to his lips to his eyes, even down to his chest, and everywhere in between. His brain had gone blank and in his attempts to distinguish Malfoy’s eye color from the reflection of the green trees around them, he had forgotten that he was still holding the blonde’s wrist.
Draco pushed until he was fully seated inside Potter, head hanging down to watch himself. Potter squirmed below him, panting, silently encouraging Draco to move. Draco took the hint, gripping Potter’s hips as he pulled back and fucked into him again. When Draco finally looked up, Potter was watching him with a heavy stare, pupils blown. Draco came to a momentary halt, entranced.
“Hi, how can- oh, Malfoy…hey,” Harry Potter greeted with a smile. The door to the kitchen was still swinging behind him, but he seemed to ignore the sound.
“Okay, right,” Potter murmured, his curved lips lifting in a small smirk, almost hidden by the sip of whisky he took directly after.
“You opened it?” He questioned immediately, watching as the trees bloomed beyond the gate and the path formed.
Harry, whose collection of Neville’s salves and solutions was steadily growing too big for the medicine cabinet in his loo, wondered if he’d be able to grab some before the crowd outside bought out the entire store. Before he could even finish the thought, however, Neville had set down his quill and smirked at him from across the desk. He gestured shortly to the corner of his desk.
Harry had been distraught when he arrived at the gate on Tuesday, after opening the gate the day before, just to see that the fog had returned and there was no sign of that luscious green grass that had appeared. It looked the same as it had since he’d discovered it, but he found as soon as he touched the gate, the fog again dissipated and the plants grew more colorful. He’d wondered if the mist and the abandoned look were just for the manor’s defense.
Harry stood up quickly, his eyebrows rose as he watched the fog on the grounds clear. He could actually see the gargantuan size of the house and entire property now, and he was blown away. It was five times bigger than he initially thought. There was clearly an extension charm on the inside of the gate, because when Harry peeked his head around the corner, he couldn’t see the end of the yard, but when he stood outside the gate, it was only several metres wide.
The blonde didn’t answer, just took Harry’s hand in his again and led him down the path. Eventually, they turned a corner and Harry immediately recognized where they were. On either side was number eleven and thirteen, but Harry waved his wand and number 12 Grimmauld Place appeared before them.
“Uh…Pardon?” He tried, leaning forward to get a look at the page Malfoy was reading. The blonde ignored him in favor of the text, which Harry was more than used to after growing up with Hermione as his best friend.
“I think… at some point my parents both lived here. They were in love. My mom’s sister didn’t like her very much, so that must have driven her from home. I didn’t know any of my grandparents; I suspect they lived here as well. I really don’t know anything about them other than the fact that they died either before I was born or shortly after… I want to know more about my family. I want to know things I can pass on to my kids, stories…”
Weasley placed a hand on his shoulder and leaned in to whisper. “Harry is in my office and he wants to talk to you.”
Draco hailed to the barman, who immediately wandered over. “Another for me and he’s drinking whisky on the rocks,” Draco half-spoke, half-shouted.
The gate looked the same as every other time he’d been here, solid and unbreakable. To be honest, this was his last-ditch effort to open the gate. He’d been here every day for weeks it seemed and the iron hadn’t loosened up in the slightest.
When the front door slammed closed, creating a bitter end to Draco’s train of thought, he stood up. It hadn’t even reached eleven o’clock yet and Draco was unsure of what to do with himself. He wandered around, as if lost in his own apartment. He made tea, but left it to cool in his cup for too long and it grew cold.
Panicking, he threw the scroll in his bag along with a few more coins and slipped out of the vault, watching it close behind him. The ride back to the lobby of Gringott’s was uneventful, but Harry still felt dizzy, as if he had been on a merry-go-round for an hour.
Draco tried to speak, but all that came out was a hoarse rasping sound. He swallowed, cleared his throat, and tried again. “Did we…?” he started, his voice barely a whisper and yet too loud.
you gave me said an emotional connection was necessary and I thought maybe if I showed it some vulnerability or made a memory for it, maybe it'd open. I didn’t know what else to do.” Harry finished, and then quickly threw in another, "I'm really sorry." He threw his back against the gate and sank down to the ground.
The world at two o’clock in the morning was riddled with silent beauty. The rolling fog under the yellow street lamps, endless wonder when looking up into the darkness of the black sky. The feeling of contortion, though everything was in place. A body, heavy and hot underneath him, bringing him back to reality.
After noticing he still had about twenty minutes to spare, he turned around and took the stairs up into Gringott’s two at a time. He hadn’t seen Draco since Monday, but they had written back and forth several times. Mostly about the manor’s defensive spells, but Harry tried to throw in something about how attractive he found the blonde or something along those lines in every letter.
He nodded. The quaffle was at the other end of the pitch and the two of them watched the chasers fight for it. “It’s good to be back on the pitch,” Harry said conversationally.
“Well, you might want to stick around to watch it crash and burn,” Draco laughed awkwardly. “I didn’t get the party planning gene, I suppose.
As the team headed off for the showers, the coach stopped him and demanded he get his arm checked out. Harry sighed and obeyed. Luckily the healer was quick. She pressed a potion to his chest and instructed him to take it. It tasted slightly of peppermint and felt icy cool sliding down his throat. The pain faded away and Harry started to get up, but the healer pushed him back down in his seat.
“Master Draco would like Kreacher to tell Master Potter that he is leaving,” the elf recited, climbing down off the bed and waiting.
Harry took a generous gulp of his pint, taking a moment to think over the offer. “Like a manager?” He finally asked.
“Death Eaters! Voldemort, and I’m sure the list continues. We’re not going to be friends. There’s no way it would work.”
One of Thomas’ hands remained on Draco’s arm as he sat and joined in the chat. His drink was soon empty, and then was refilled several times by the bottle of Firewhisky that was passed around. He hadn’t been expecting to go off the rails, but he was well on his way. After finishing his latest round, Thomas grabbed his glass and held it up for the rest of the group to see. “It’s— Everyone, it’s Draco’s turn!” Thomas declared, giving him a push towards the centre of the group, where the table resided, untouched for the last hour at least. Draco and Thomas were the only two of the group who had still been drinking, the rest deciding to let their buzz cruise for the time being.
Draco sighed again next to him, tapping his fingers on his knee rhythmically. Harry looked at the blonde. His hair was voluminous on top of his head, swooped back from his forehead but not caked down with gel like it was at Hogwarts. His lips turned downward slightly and his eyebrows raised every time the host gave them an updated wait time. He groaned in frustration a couple of times, but mostly it was sighs and body language that told Harry he was sick of waiting. He looked beautiful despite his mood and every time Harry saw his fingers move he wanted to grab that hand and hold it. He agonized over that for a few moments before mentally saying “Bugger it”, reached over, and pulled Draco’s hand into his own.
Bippy’s large, black eyes welled up with tears. “Master has been gone for many years. Lolly and Mufty passed. Bippy has been unable to clean.” She began to sob, thick tears rolling off her cheeks and being absorbed into the layer of dust on the floor.
“You played wonderfully, sweetheart,” Mrs. Weasley assured him. Harry smiled and accepted hugs from all his friends, including Ginny which made Mr. and Mrs. Weasley nudge each other. Despite them knowing he was gay, they still held onto some blind hope that he and Ginny would get together.  As far as Harry knew, Ginny didn’t want to be with him either, as she’d recently reconnected with Michael Corner.
The grass on either side of the path perked up near his foot, suddenly changing from the sandy brown, dead color to the lushest, most vivid green Harry had seen in his life. Each step resulted in more color, more plants that recovered from more than twenty years of absence. The trees immediately began to bloom as he passed them, pedals sprinkling down like the gentlest snowfall. The whole experience was, ironically, magical. Harry could hear birds chirping across the yard, a breeze rustling through the leaves of the- of
Harry was deep in thought, staring at the ground just on the other side of the gate. He couldn’t help but feel a jolt of hope. Maybe someone in his family was still alive and they’d been taking care of the Manor. A newfound excitement spread throughout his body, his mind racing. Who could it be? His parents? Grandparents? A long lost cousin? A grin started to form on his face as he thought about his possible alive family. Images of him surrounded by raven-haired witches and wizards, hazel eyes and wicked smirks floated through his brain. Spending Christmas holidays with them. Easter, or his birthday, or even just a casual Sunday dinner. God, he wanted that.
He held eye contact with his mother figure and answered honestly, “I’m not sure.” When her face contorted into one of confusion, he added, “We’ve been spending some time together recently, but haven’t exactly had a conversation about it. We’re…dating.”
The game started shortly after and Harry couldn’t find the snitch anywhere. After forty-five minutes of circling the pitch, the other team’s seeker on his tail, he still came up short. He thought he’d seen it over the opposite team’s stands, but it had just been a muggle camera that someone had brought in. He pulled up near the keeper of his own team and hovered for a few moments, looking around.
“You have to pay the tab,” Thomas said offhandedly, standing behind Draco and bouncing excitedly. “No magic, go on!”
The gate wouldn’t open. Harry had tried pushing, pulling, a simple Alohamora, and even a blasting curse, but it wouldn’t budge. He’d thought it might recognize his magical signature, or something like that, and let him in, but the lock remained tightly shut. He grabbed one of the iron bars and rattled it back and forth furiously before letting go with a huff. He turned to Hermione.
“Yeah, well…” She deflected, busying herself by examining the crisp between her fingers. Harry just watched her for a moment as she seemed to think very hard about something.
Harry though for a moment before nodding. “It sounds like he’s planning on giving you some sort of promotion, but he’s talking in riddles.” He finished the rest of his tea and handed his empty mug to Hermione, who packed it back up in the basket they brought. The cake was gone at this point, finished off by Ron who had just licked his fingers clean.
The smile that stretched across Draco’s face was blinding and contagious. Harry felt his cheeks burning from being stretched so wide. The fact that Draco felt comfortable enough to talk to him about his mother and ask his permission to tell her about them felt like a huge accomplishment, despite Harry previously being unsure about whether there was a
Harry couldn’t wait until his godson opened the present he bought. Andromeda had warned him that Teddy shouldn’t get a broomstick until his second year of Hogwarts, but Harry couldn’t resist. If anything, he could take it back home with him every time they were done using it, so that Teddy couldn’t get into it when Andromeda wasn’t looking. Harry reasoned with himself. Flying was a huge part of his life, especially now that he had the time to actually enjoy it, and he wanted to share it with his godson.
“It’s nice to see that your hero complex hasn’t faded over the years,” someone said behind him. He turned to see Malfoy leaning against the outside wall of the locker room. The sunlight was so bright that Harry had to squint to see his face. All he wore was an old t-shirt and some fancy, dark wash jeans that accentuated how long his legs were.
He was silent for a moment before he turned around and they made eye contact. “Okay, don’t laugh.” A smile was already starting to form. “I said don’t!” He passed her one of the pages Malfoy had given him.
“What are you, going off to war now?” Harry asked jokingly, and then laughed at his own jest. If there were two people in the entire wizarding world that could joke about war, it would be them. Draco broke out in a grin, staring down at the shorter man.
Harry had tried to tame himself, but thoughts about Malfoy infiltrated his every day. He eventually gave in, letting himself think, imagine, what it would be like to be friends with Malfoy. Maybe even something more.
He couldn’t help but pant, feeling beads of sweat gather at his temples as his hips made full contact, the slap of skin on skin echoing all the way up the 15-foot ceiling. His pace was brutal, taking it all for himself, but giving the man underneath him just enough to keep him there, submissive.
“Is this…?” Draco trailed off, staring through the iron bars at the outline of the mansion in the distance. He spun around to face Harry, looking him in the eyes. “Why did you bring me here?”
, he thought, somewhat irritatedly. When he could finally lay his hands on the counter, nodding at the harried looking cashier who looked like he could use a break, he launched himself over it and closed the door to the office behind himself.
Draco’s arm snaked around Potter’s waist, pulling them flush together. Potter glanced up, making eye contact. He was still angry, that was obvious, but there was that small bit of uncertainty in his expression which made Draco lean down and touch their lips together.
“M’sorry,” Harry confessed, overtly attempting to walk as if he wasn’t struggling, which made his walk even stranger. “I didn’t mean to leave you out when talking to Nev.”
If Malfoy had been annoyed by his frequent visits, he never expressed it. In fact, he was more than pleasant every single time Harry was in his office. Harry never could have fathomed that he would actually enjoy spending time with Draco Malfoy, especially after everything they had gone through.  After all the times they had fought, dueled, thrown insults at each other, how could Harry so desperately want to reach out and touch that blonde hair, run his fingers along the curve of Malfoy’s jaw, and maybe even interlock their fingers together.
“Hey,” Potter said, “I’ve got your order.” He stepped into the room followed by three levitating trays. Each one floated into place onto the front table and Harry quickly removed their coverings, revealing a display of beautiful heart shaped cookies with various designs on them. The chocolate ones looked especially good, and as Draco walked up to observe them he almost wanted to try one now.
Draco watched Potter through half-lidded eyes, leaned back against the wall and waited as the Gryffindor approached. Potter’s hands came up, like they wanted to shove at Draco again, but landed on his chest instead. His fingers felt hot through Draco’s thin button-down and Draco thought if they were left any longer he’d burn. Draco could almost guess what was running through Potter’s mind. He still wanted Draco. He wasn’t happy about it, but those feelings were still there.
He pulled the usual blanket out of his basket and opened it up, spreading it on the grass under a tree nearby and placing the basket in the center. So far, this was his favorite tree. It was more wide than it was tall, and the branches cast wicked shadows on the grass below, but when he looked closer at the trunk there was something that nearly brought tears to his eyes when he first saw it. Etched into the bark, with a knife or maybe even magic, were the letters “LE + JP”. His parents. He briefly wondered if his father had been the one to carve it out of hope for a relationship with his mother, or if they’d done it together. He imagined a day where they spent hours on this very lawn, laughing and watching the day go by.
It was at this point Draco could gauge exactly how drunk Thomas was, and the answer was: extremely. Thomas pointed to each individual in the circle and said something along the lines of, “great bloke right here”, when talking about each one. Draco said hello to each, nodding along with Thomas’ ramblings. Draco reached back and grabbed Thomas’ chair, pulling it forward so Thomas could sit back down. Draco waved his wand and another chair appeared so he could sit.
The group chatted away happily over wine glasses that drained and refilled over the course of the meal. Harry always felt an ache in his heart when he came back to this house with his family. They were his family. They would never
Potter had been writing furiously on a notebook behind the counter, and when Draco leaned forward to catch a glimpse, he slickly covered his writing. “Ron did mention it, so I may stop by for a bit.”
Draco agreed and before he knew it, he was ushered in, pushed down into a soft chair, and had a nice glass of goblin wine in his hand. Harry sat on the floor between Draco’s knees, sipping his own glass and sighing when he felt Draco’s fingers run through his hair. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes, feeling utterly relaxed.
Maybe it was the fact that he’d just woken up, or that he was still thinking about that damned sock he needed to find so he could snog Draco again, but Harry nearly said
A throat cleared behind him and he glanced over his shoulder, then shot straight up, glass still in hand. Potter. Potter had appeared, drink in hand, joining the circle of people who surrounded him.
“Oops,” Harry automatically said as two pairs of eyes turned to him. The woman instantly recognized him, he could tell. Her expression moved from shocked to excited and then to something else that made him a little uncomfortable. “Uh...I’ll come back later, I think.”
“Oh, hey,” Harry said casually, and then chuckled. “Yeah I guess I have a habit of saving people from pain.”
“Of course I will,” Draco assured, his grip on Harry’s arm slipping down until they were holding hands. The pair stood at the edge of the gate, peering at the house in the distance, and then Harry slowly took his first step onto his new, inherited property.
“Sorry,” he said quickly, and then, “I was grabbing coins from my vault when I came across this and I was just wondering… If you could tell me anything about it.”
“No, Kingsley wanted to have lunch because he,” she threw up two air quotes, “‘found out about Ron and I’s anniversary last week’. I told him it’s really okay, but he insisted.”
“It’s okay,” Hermione said while quickly pulling on Ron’s shirt, sitting next to him while Ron went to get dressed for work. She eyed him before asking, “What’s wrong?”
Draco had half a mind to stay right there, Potter’s hand on his prick bringing him off. But he needed more, he wanted to get closer.
On Monday, Harry had quidditch practice. It was hot outside, the sweltering sun beating down on him during the whole practice. He knew he smelled terrible, could barely stand the scent of his quidditch uniform by the end of it. Sweat dripped freely down his face as he bounded off the pitch, robes caked in mud.
Potter’s free hand flew to the back of Draco’s neck, tugging him back into a snog. Draco went willingly, his hips grinding deeply against Potter’s arse, over and over. He pressed his weight into his forearm, reaching down to grip Potter’s cock in his fist. The both of them groaned into the kiss, moving seamlessly together. Draco felt his body go hot, felt the telling stir in his lower stomach as he thrust into Potter. His hand tightened around Potter’s prick, stroking in time with his own hips. Potter broke the kiss, gasping for breath underneath him. Draco pressed his forehead into Potter’s shoulder, breath hitching, the friction between them threatening to send him over the edge. The heel of Potter’s foot dug into the back of Draco’s thigh, keeping him in place as Potter’s back arched, coating Draco’s fingers in his sticky release.
Harry sighed and opened his mouth to speak, but Neville beat him to it. “I know, I know. You ‘didn’t ask for it’. What did you expect, Harry? For people to forget about Voldemort after all their friends and family were buried? Everyone is grateful for you, and you’ve already paid them back a thousand times over by defeating him and being alive.”
Approaching a random goblin, a rather new one it looked like, Harry cleared his throat. The goblin set down its quill and gazed at Harry blankly. “Yes?” It’s beady eyes seemed to glare at him and he briefly wondered if they still hated him for breaking into the bank, stealing from a vault, and escaping on the back of their protective dragon.
“Thought about it, have you?” Draco smirked again, signalling to the bartender for yet another round.
“No, thank you. I really should be getting home.” Malfoy interrupted. Harry nodded and watched as the other man stepped onto the apparition spot and disappeared with a crack. He sighed and followed suit, coming to a stop in the middle of his living room and trekking up to the bathroom.
Draco nodded. “Right,” he replied. He set his drink on the nearest flat surface and weaved his way through the cubicles to the Head Auror’s office. He knocked on the slightly ajar door and poked his head in. “Potter, I apologize. I forgot about the payment, but I can write you that check no—mmf.” A pair of soft lips pushed against his unexpectedly. Draco stumbled back against the door from the force and quickly tried to balance himself by leaning onto Potter, wrapping his arms around Potter’s waist. They took time with the kiss, a chance to really feel each other for the first time, until the need to breathe dominated.
“Were you watching me?” Potter asked, sliding his empty glass across the counter so it could be taken away when the bartender brought them each a fresh one.
“Wicked. Do you think your dad--” Hermione sent a swift kick to Ron’s shin and he yelped. “Bloody hell! What was that for?”
“Oh, haven’t you heard?” Came Harry’s joking voice, unlocking his fingers from behind Draco’s head and sliding his hands down to the blonde’s chest. “You’re dating the great Harry Potter. You know, that guy that saved the entire wizarding world? Heroes don’t lose their quidditch spots.”
Slughorn wasn’t getting any younger and with Professor Snape gone, the position needed to be filled sooner or later. And oh, how Draco longed to teach at Hogwarts. Despite everything, he loved the castle. It was the only home he had left. The Manor had seen too much death to be a home to anyone. Draco had seriously considered burning it down after the war was over, but common sense told him that selling would probably be a more sensible option. His parents wouldn’t need a place to live for a long time.
His friends… Only Blaise had returned to Hogwarts for their eighth year. He was easy company, they kept their conversations light and pleasant. It was good to have him there.
“Somewhere in the forest I took out the stone, I turned it three times in my hand…” He let the sentence hang in the air for a moment, both of them focussed on their joined hands between them. “And they appeared.”
‘She said you’d say that. It’s true, Draco. I’m so fucking in love with you, I don’t want to hide it. I want you to know, I want everyone to know. I should have just said it, not write it on a sign. Will you go on a date with me?’
Flannagan passes me in a rush of violence. He walks out of the Great Hall. I turn around and follow him out.
on Malfoy’s lips set his body on fire. He gasped, his body shaking. Malfoy’s fingers wrapped suddenly around his cock. Harry cried out.
‘You know… funny thing about this spell…’ his fingers skimmed over the head, teasing the slit. Draco whispered a little word. ‘It can change everything when you least expect it.’
I’m not in the habit of stalking him, but the truth is I was worried. Even when he’s gone for a whole day, like today, he always comes back to the room.
I cross my arms over my chest. I’m not letting his all too innocent look stop me from addressing this.
He stares at you from across the room. It’s impossible to know what he’s thinking or what he’s going to do.
He took out his wand and had the glasses on the side table filling with water. Josh picked one up and drank, Draco waved his wand and lifted the other two glasses. He drank his then grabbed the other one and reached for Harry. He brought the glass to Harry’s lips and Harry drank.
The second I recover from his curse, I pay him back with interest. He blocks the first one, misses the next. I watch him fall to the floor, clutching at his chest, gasping loudly for air. These are the sounds I love. Anger, resentment and challenge. It’s all in there, as he fights to breathe, his fingers clutching his wand.
His hands are on my pants again, he pushes them all the way down. I remember the wandless hex. I can use it. This is why I learned it. To get away when all else failed. I have to use it. I have to- his hands are on my throat, his cock between my legs, but he’s not quite there yet, where he wants to be, he’s trying to force me into a position- I try to summon it, my magic-
He needed to have Harry or leave. And he couldn’t have him just once more, if he did, he would have to take him home and have him again, until the curling need inside him would think itself appeased, even if he suspected it wouldn’t be, not ever.
He seems to be searching for this word we don’t say, this word filled with impossible things. I’m here hoping and dreading that he might find it.
@isleen_, thank you for all the brainstorming, your several readings, your support. You kept me writing and you kept me hopeful.
You think it’s all in the way he holds the cigarette, negligently, with his long pale fingers. His lips separate briefly, then close. It’s decadent and so very alive.
He notices me staring, puts his arms around himself and stands there, seemingly unsure. I quickly look away. My eyes burn.
Harry’s heart hammered. His head swam and his whole body was trembling from the interrupted orgasm. He fought to be able to speak, his throat closing down on him.
‘I… You’re…’ Harry kept looking at his shoulder. ‘Just your voice does it for me,’ he laughed. ‘It’s pathetic really.’ His eyes finally focused on Draco. ‘There must be hundreds of men pining for you. Throwing themselves at your feet.’
Hands were moving up his sides and coming up from behind to hold him close. Malfoy’s arms circled around him and he heard someone sob, lost, whimpering and babbling. He took some time to realise it was his own voice, that he had passed the test, he hadn’t come with Malfoy’s tongue inside him, he had been good. Malfoy was whispering something on his ear, soft words, his lips brushing on his neck, but he couldn’t hear it, he just felt Malfoy’s hands rubbing circles over his chest, so gentle.
‘And you don’t let people in easily. I don’t know why, but that gets me going like- Fuck. It’s not just sex for me.’
I’m too aware of the fact that the other bloke is still waiting several steps away, out of ear shot, but clearly watching his supposed date hitting on another man.
Malfoy sucked on his rim. Harry trashed under him, his movements cut short because of the restraints and that seemed to drive Malfoy even further. He heard a distant groan, but clearly felt it against his hole. Malfoy’s tongue breached him, slow, unrelenting, breaking his self-control, teasing him open, and Harry felt so incredible safe, so gone out of his mind, infinite in Malfoy’s hands, under his tongue.
The lights from the club flashed over Josh’s piercing blue eyes. He had a curious smile on his face, his posture completely at ease. It made Draco all the more aware of the tension building in his shoulders. Draco actually liked Josh. He was the type of man who was completely straightforward in all his interactions. You knew from the uptake where you stood with him, which lines you could cross, which were out of bounds, which were up for debate. A part of Draco wished he could always be like that, totally transparent about his own desires. But this whole business included Harry Potter and that complicated things.
He wasn’t wearing his glasses so everything farther than Draco was blurry. There were figures watching them, and some people on the sofas farther back. Josh was one of them. Harry hoped he was enjoying himself, getting off on this. He saw Draco adjusting the straps on his hands again, checking his fingers’ response. Then he turned to the side table and came back with a bottle of lube. The grey eyes were suddenly unguarded.
Potter smiles at him, looks down at the sign, like it could answer the question for him. He looks shy. It shouldn’t fit him. But it does.
Draco tried to calm down his own breathing, to shut down the part of him that said all this closeness was dangerous, was too much. He should just wrap-up the scene, should clean Harry up and clothe him. They probably needed to talk. But he didn’t want to, not really.
Malfoy’s hands pressed harder into his hips and his fingers roamed freely over Harry’s body, anywhere they wanted to go. They skimmed over the hairs on Harry’s thighs and then came too close to his cock. Harry’s eyes shot open only to be faced with the  darkness inside the blindfold.
Harry was drowning, so tired, his body on shutdown, and Draco’s touch was everything… Draco was still his whole world… it felt wrong to say goodbye. He closed his eyes just for a minute. When he opened them, he was alone with Josh.
Suddenly Harry was there, on him, pushing him back on the bed, and straddling him, his legs coming to wrap around Draco. He was sweaty and he smelled of sex and of broom polish and Summer and light things. Draco heard his own voice, hoarse, unrecognizable but still his.
Gravity can’t be defied. Even with magic, it can only be fought off temporarily. In the end, it always wins.
‘I can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t fucking work and I fought way too hard to be where I am at the Ministry,’ I say. ‘Not all of us are famous War heroes and have our jobs guaranteed because we’re fucking reckless and not afraid to die.’
But there’s a bite to his tone. He’s mad at you for ruining the moment. You’ve been meaning to have this conversation before, you just didn’t know how to start.
He knew he was attractive for most men. He also knew he was too damned distant and arrogant. That he felt like no one could reach him. Until Harry happened. Out of the blue. Like nothing and everything at the same time.
Then his hands are on each side of my face and he kisses me again, I’m half naked, and I feel tears gather behind my eyes. I don’t let them out, instead I press my body against his, my hands on his waist, I trace his hipbones, I push his pants down. He’s cold, my hands cup his arse. We don’t rush, we’re not even hard yet. I want him with something more than my cock, this was never about the sex, the sex is something that happens because I want to be close to him, and this is the only way I get to have him.
He really laughs this time. A full, bright, belly laugh. I can’t seem to stop the smile spreading on my lips.
He barely had time to bite back a moan. Malfoy’s hands were on him. Long fingers wrapped around his hips, tugging them in place. Malfoy’s nails brushed his skin and dug into it. Hard. The searing pain expanded through Harry, but he did not make a sound. He could take it. He could take it all. Malfoy was going to mark him. His nails were deep enough to do so. Harry was a sucker for pain. And Malfoy was going to give it to him. Bad.
‘I think it’s because you want it so badly. It scares you.’  I say this in a rush. I regret it instantly, but the damage is done.
Draco was speaking over him, his voice uneven, as he thrust again inside Harry, breaking away any resistance he might had. Harry stopped thinking, his hole clenching and releasing around Draco’s cock, and he was being filled up so good he wanted to cry. He let Draco have his way with him, his every thrust taking him apart.
‘She said I was a fucking jerk. And, you know, the usual life threat. She meant it, though. She cares for you.’
‘What do I need to do for you to stop this charade and fuck me?’ I walk over to him, and pull my sweater off, drop it to the floor, and then start on the buttons on my shirt. ‘Do you want a show, Harry?’ I ease two buttons open and let my hands trail down my chest and stomach and then I cup myself through my trousers.
Fucking god, he was hungry, so fucking hungry for Malfoy. He wanted Malfoy to snap, to lose all his composure and just take Harry, brutally and completely.
As usual, he had come here with Josh. Harry didn’t normally have any problems with whomever Josh handed him to. Quite the contrary. Inside the club, Josh was in charge of him, he took care of Harry’s pain and pleasure.
He shivered at the praise, feeling thankful for the blindfold. He didn’t know what he’d do if he could see Malfoy - his expression, his eyes, that smile forming on his thin lips. The same lips that were now on his neck. Malfoy kissed Harry there. Just once, a gentle flick of his tongue. It was enough to leave a trail of gooseflesh and a frantic heart.
Harry looked up at Draco, his mouth working Josh’s cock, his eyes wet, face torn by need and arousal.
A strangled cry went inside his mouth, Harry clutched at his shirt. From there to a kiss it was only gravity. They swapped the come between their mouths, slowly, teasingly. Draco had never wanted to do something like this before. It felt strangely right.
The first place where he kisses you is your neck. It’s soft, barely there, but it makes you gasp. Your hands catch on his arms and his lips are warm, trailing down your neck, over your shoulder and up again, his hands on your hips, on the loops of your trousers, pushing you closer. His breath on your neck, his warm tongue there, so sweet. You bite down a moan, he pulls you flush together. You were never this aware of getting slowly hard. It’s always been something you notice after the fact. But now you are aware of the way there, and of him, getting there too.
‘I don’t wanna talk about it,’ I mutter, watching his hand on my knee, the bones on his fingers, the slow movement of them over my jeans.
‘You want another medal for that great accomplishment?’ I ask, when my words finally catch up with my brain and probably my heart. ‘The Golden Playboy manages to keep it in his pants-’ My tone is now high pitched, and I’m beyond thankful for the silencing charm.
‘You will, for me. I know you will take it and take it, until you can’t anymore,’ the look on Draco’s face was vicious and proud, his cock unmoving inside Harry. ‘And then I’m going to make you come all over yourself, and you’ll scream so loud you'll make every fucking cock in this room harder.’

A week goes by. Two. I don’t go back to the club. I call in sick & get a leave of absence, so I don’t have to cross paths with him at the Ministry. I don’t answer his calls. Or his Firecalls. I refuse every one of his owls, without even opening the envelopes, simply burning them to ashes. For good measure, I also avoid everyone else. I don’t leave my house. I ignore Pansy & Blaise. They know me far too well, it would only take them one good look at me to know the full truth. I drink. A lot. I start as soon as I wake up & keep going, easing the days away. I take every numbing potion I can get my hands on. I stay as intoxicated as I can, as far away from reality as I can.
‘Don’t be a jerk. They were just a game, Draco. I didn’t even want to- all those men, they were just this thing, to get to you. You’re insufferable and arrogant and-’
On the streets, he walks coolly and resolutely. He turns left, then left again and you realise he’s going to the Apparition point closest to where you are. Expectation sits in the back of your throat.
Potter is far from stupid, but there is no way in hell he came to this beautiful conclusion without some help from the only other person who actually knows I have feelings.
He looks at me expectantly. I realise he’s probably thought about this ages ago and was just waiting for the right moment to ask me.
A slick tongue trailed a path between his shoulders blades. Harry barely kept the moan in, his body arching off the leather. Fuck. Inside his mind, Malfoy was wearing the same smirk that used to crawl under his skin and that now seemed to crawl right down to his core, leaving nothing untouched. Harry lifted his arse as best as he could, offering it up for the crop.
‘You did this,’ Malfoy said, voice as sharp as his hips snapping forward. ‘You… with that pretty arse of yours.’
His smile stays in place. It sends a red-hot jolt down my body, burning through everything. He gets up, arms open, hands empty, palms turned upwards. I’ve seen him go for wandless and non-verbal magic like it’s nothing at all. I’m ready for it. Whatever he throws at me. But wandless is much harder to predict. I lift my wand.
Please take care of yourselves, be safe if you decide to read. Thank you all for the support and love for this story.
‘Baby, I loved it…’ Josh said, whispering in his ear, his hand brushing Harry’s hair back. ‘You were so, so good. So beautiful. God, you both were, you had the attention of everyone in this room. I bet next time there’ll be a line of men willing to spank you.’
The word rolled slowly against his tongue. It tasted soft, right and commanding all at the same time. Harry closed his eyes, then opened them again and looked up at Josh with a silent plea. The three of them were standing so close together, it felt like Draco was being brought into their intimate circle. Or rather that the circle was only complete because he was there.
You take another step and drop to your knees. It’s cold and wet and you couldn’t care less. You palm him through his pants. He’s not fully hard yet, but he’s getting there. Your mouth waters.
I don’t think twice about what he means by that. My own hair is plastered to my face, but I know I look good anyway. I play with the seams of my jumper. Harry likes me in Muggle clothes. He likes me better without them.
‘And if he were to touch me…’ he took Josh’s hand and pulled it around him, dropping it to his lower back, close to the swell of his arse, knowing Harry’s eyes would be there, transfixed. ‘You’d probably go crazy, wouldn’t you,
I take a step back and try to stop the shake in my hands, the feeling that I’m standing over an edge again and it’s all dark, dark and endless under. I have no idea when I’ll be seeing him again.
for him. He never asks you to stay the night, so you usually leave around 4 am. You fall into your bed and sleep takes over you. You always think it will be the last time, but weeks turn to months. You are at his beck and call and you don’t mind, you just want whatever you can get.
Green eyes, messy hair, Gryffindor scarf. The light shines a bright gold so intense it blinds Draco suddenly and then, just like that, the little light is out.
‘I want you… Want you to fuck me. Use me. When Josh hands me over I want to be a hole…’ his throat was dry.
Since we’re back at Hogwarts, we barely said a word to each other. Not that he speaks much to anyone these days. He doesn't seem to have any friends besides his usual two. They always look worried around him and that's probably why he's spending less and less time with them.
‘We're not going to fuck. We’re having tea. And a hangover potion for you,’ he steps back, pulls back a chair for me to sit, and surprising even myself, I sit down without a retort. I watch him walk over to the counter, pick up the sugar bowl.
He didn’t know what he was asking for anymore, the only thing he knew was that tongue, moving inside him, Malfoy’s thumb caressing the skin near his hole, Malfoy’s face pressing into him, his hairs tinkling his skin, and he was bucking back against that heat, against Malfoy’s mouth and tongue, forgetting everything. He moaned freely, loud, his body going more pliant as Malfoy’s hands gripped his arse, forcing his tongue further inside Harry. He was going to come and he couldn’t, he had to take this, he had to, but he wasn’t strong enough, he was a hole, just a hole for Malfoy to fuck… a small, tight hole, being torn apart by that tongue. Merlin, that mouth. That filthy, terrible mouth. He felt powerless against the building pleasure, his orgasm starting to rise up, a force that could not be contained, but he had to fight it, Malfoy hadn’t allowed it, his orgasm wasn’t his, it was Malfoy’s… Malfoy’s to decide, Malfoy’s to have.
He finally stands up. I have an inch on him, give or take. I never noticed this before, but I do now because he’s so close, leaning even closer. Seemingly realising the same thing,  he tilts his head up slightly & his lips brush my cheek. My breath catches. The shiver starts there, on the point of contact & runs me down. He is warm & too real.
In fact, it’s Granger-Parkinson, but I never got around to saying it out loud. Her smile bares a row of perfect white teeth.
Draco bent his head down and his tongue flicked over Harry’s hard nipple. He was tasting Harry. Then he turned around, walked two steps to the side table where his instruments were displayed, and he picked up the cane. Harry sucked in a breath.
I get away from him as fast as I can, and stagger through his corridor, like he’s invited me in. I hear the door closing behind me. If there’s another man in here, I’ll find him. With luck, I might even throw up on him. The thought makes me smile.
I bring the dark tip of my boot forward, putting out the cigarette. He brings a warm hand to the small of my back & just like that our bodies slant together.
There was a spanking leather bench close by, and Draco did not have to wonder much about Josh’s immediate plans. The lights flashed once over the beautiful line of Harry’s back. Draco thought he saw older bruises there, but it was too fast for him to be sure. His heart felt lodged in his throat, a sensation he wasn’t familiar with. He took a sip of the wine, willing the liquid to ease it down, to numb the feeling. No such luck. His eyes were fixed on the planes and curves of Harry’s body. He had the body of an Auror, of a reckless fighter. Hard, strong, marred in so many different ways, a testimony to the battles that had taken place there. But still there was a trace of fragility there… something so
It was only a whisper. Draco revelled in it, his lips parted in a gasp, his eyes on fire. For this hint of nearly uncontrolled fire, Harry would beg all night.
His tongue swirled around Malfoy’s fingers. He thought of Malfoy’s cock. How it would feel on his mouth, the weight of it on his tongue, fucking him so deep he would happily gag on it. He wanted it down his throat, like those fingers. His scalp was hurting, Malfoy’s other hand gripping his hair so tightly and Harry’s body was on fucking fire. A low pleading sound came out of his mouth and Malfoy’s fingers were suddenly gone, as was his hand on Harry’s hair.
Harry realised he was supposed to say something, to answer Malfoy, but he couldn’t be reminded of a single word. He was too intensely aware of Malfoy’s body behind him, probably impeccably dressed (he imagined), of his voice, low, whispered on his ear, of his breath with a hint of whiskey in it, of his scent, something like polished wood, musk and something else he couldn’t identify, but which made him dizzy. He was vaguely aware that there were other people in the room, moans and cries reaching his years, the cackle of a flogger cutting through the heavy air. These sounds were generally soothing for him, driving him under, but now he was only dimly aware of them because Malfoy was there.
‘You’re more than an addiction. You’re- I had a taste of you seven months ago and that was it for me.’
Potter comes up behind me, body a hard line right at my back. I tense, he exhales, breath warm on my neck. He extends his hand, fingers sliding alongside mine, holding the cigarette, lifting it up to his mouth. I turn in time to watch as his lips close over the place mine were barely a second ago.
The rest of what Ron is saying sinks into the background noise. You nod out of habit. These days, it’s all background noise anyway.
‘What can I say, Draco… You’re special,’ he says & for a second he’s the one to look away. It is not exactly a lie, but it is also so far from the truth I can practically put my finger on the space it opens up.
‘How many times do I have to tell you he’s changed?’ Hermione turns to Ron, her voice rising above the incessant babble in the room. ‘We work together now, can’t you make an effort—?’
He rubs his face against the hard line of your cock. It’s maddening, even with your pants still on. His hands rest on your thighs. You fight back a half-moan, half-scream. The sight of him, all formal and upright on his knees and, at the same time, his face, so focused, so pretty, lodges itself on your mind. You like him like this.
Harry realised he’d closed his eyes to better take it. He opened them. Draco looked completely wrecked, his hair plastered to his face, eyes dark-grey, sweat trickling on his forehead - he looked more beautiful than ever. Harry felt like he would burst the minute Draco moved inside him.
He stares at the glass of Firewhisky in my hand and I know he knows exactly how many I’ve had. His smirk is blatantly bold & perceptive. One of his eyebrows goes up. That’s my trademark, so obviously I take offense.
‘I want to make you lose all that composure you pretend to have when you’re playing Auror. That control they tried to drill into you. In here, you don’t need any of it. Moan for me.’
‘Look at me, Harry. Did I say you could look away?’ The loving hand behind his neck was tight over his throat, hard, pressing, Malfoy’s fingers slowly suffocating him.
Edit: omg I just realised this fic is 18888 words long and has 18/18 chapters wth? Is there any kind of sign in there? I swear I didn't plan this!
or from those beautiful memories we once shared in a bathroom. I still have the scars to show for it, they give off a dull ache in especially cold weather. At that time, his magic felt more raw, intense, but kind of all over the place. It lacked the searing focus it has now. Like a blade made for battle, he’s been polishing it. But so have I.
I watch as a dark-haired bloke tries his luck. Malfoy ruts against him, lets the man run his hands down his chest, over his stomach, then he lets that hand cup him through his tight black jeans. I can’t yank my eyes away, as he rolls his hips up, slowly. I can’t tell if he’s hard, but I like to think he is, his cock filling up under that hand. My chest constricts. Malfoy lifts his eyes and looks me up and down. He runs his tongue over his piercing. A metal ring in the right corner of his lower lip. That’s new. He didn’t have it yesterday. I never kissed anyone with a piercing.
‘Such a demanding bottom,’ Draco said and gave a short laugh. It rippled through him, like a current of power down his legs, his arms, his fingers. A dozen or so ways of making Harry confess his every fantasy came to Draco’s mind in the space of a heartbeat.
All the unsaid questions burn in my chest. I throw them all at his retreating back: why did you save me from the fire, why did you speak for me at the trials, why don’t you show up at Hogwarts, why do you keep coming here, what do you want from me, why don’t you do something about this, about us, because c’mmon there’s an us in here somewhere, in the way you watch me, why don’t you fucking make a move on me, can’t you see that I don’t want them, where’s that Gryffindor recklessness, that thing that made you so alive, what do you wank about when you finally go home, is it me, do you get hard when you watch me, do you get any sleep at all, because I only do if I dance and you never do, why do you look so fucking sad, why does that hurt me?
You decide to sit on his bed and take off your clothes. You’re not self-conscious about the way you look, but you’re so thoroughly aware of his eyes on you, you’re shaking a bit.
Hi, there! So here's another chapter, Harry is dead set on a plan that might be even worse than having to kill Voldemort :D
Josh breathed heavily. He pulled at Harry’s hair and yanked his head back. Harry was the perfect picture of a cockslut, his mouth open for cock, his spit dripping down his lips, his jaw, his neck, over Josh’s length.
Harry looked up at Josh, and from that angle Draco couldn’t see his expression. Only Josh’s. The Dom gave Harry a slight smile, followed by a curt nod. He then moved to release the restraints on Harry’s wrists. The change allowed Harry to hold himself up on his hands, over the bench, which he did, shaking, the muscles on his arms straining. This way, his cock was clearly visible, resting against the leather in what must be a painful friction. Potter was going to endure the flogging like this, but why would he want that?
‘Romantic relationship.’ I repeat after him, like I have run out of all my previously extensive vocabulary.
‘I want to be so good for you, Draco… fill me up,’ he hitched his hips up again, and Draco grunted against him. Harry couldn’t believe what he was doing or saying. He wanted to be filled with Draco, stuffed with him everywhere.
‘You’re so fucking gorgeous like this,’ Draco said, his voice more tender than usual, the words coming to him in sudden clarity.
‘Fuck you, Malfoy,’ he snapped, biting the words out, his defiance zinging through Draco in a bloody rush.
‘I keep thinking… you need a place to relax,’ Harry whispered. His hands cupped Draco’s bollocks, his tongue darting out to lick at them, slow. He took his time to make Draco wet all over before he even turned to his cock. Draco groaned in frustration, his hand shooting to Harry’s hair. His cock rubbed against Harry’s cheek.
. He didn’t want to give him all that. He wanted to refuse, to have a last threshold where Malfoy could not go, since he already had him like this.
‘They’re not like you,’ Harry said through gritted teeth, eyes on Draco. ‘They can’t give me what I want,’ his voice trailed off.
You pretend to pay attention to what Ron is saying, but he’s drunk anyway, so you give him some excuse about leaving and head for the door.
He finishes on the last button and steps back. His face is tinged in red, his eyes shine with purpose, and I almost feel like he’s getting off on denying me now.
I’m already lifting him off his feet, my arms around him. He makes this wonderful noise, half surprise, half true happiness.
‘There’s also a weird rumor…’ I keep going because I’m not about to let him off the hook. ‘Apparently, someone broke Flannagan’s wand in half. He didn’t say who. But everyone’s going on about how freaking scared he was… he even talked of leaving the country. You don’t happen to have anything to do with that, do you?’
He leans over, his elbows on his knees. I get lost watching his tattoos. There it is, under the flowers. The white-stark scars of his Dark Mark. Instead of finding it repulsive, I find it brave. The way he wears it. Like it doesn’t define him anymore. I wish mine didn’t. I glance at him. He tilts his head, the strand of hair moves with it.
The why and how and what the hells all evaporated at once. The world was reduced to Harry Potter’s wrecked face in the semi-darkness of the room, his eyes alight.
‘You’re a sucker for this, aren’t you?’ Malfoy asked, and for the first time Harry heard his voice break, filled with arousal.
You cross your arms, keep your mouth shut and wait as his eyes travel from the pictures hanging on your walls, to the bundled up blanket on your sofa. You know your house is messy, but it’s comfortable and it’s yours. You’re filled quite suddenly with a burning feeling. Let him judge you. Let him judge you and you’ll finally know what he thinks of you. Why
Harry did moan then, loud and desperate. The next second, Malfoy’s hands left him. Harry sobbed. The crop went down on his skin again, the leather biting oh so wonderfully down his thighs. Harry lost track of time. His whole being was on overdrive. He wanted more, more pain, more Malfoy. He felt wild with agony and want. God, he wished he could see Malfoy standing there, crop in hand, eyes demanding, the movement of his arm as he hit Harry. The pain was spreading, so that he no longer knew which parts of his body were hurting and which were aroused. Everything was pleasure and pain.
Harry didn’t even try to stand up. He crawled over to Draco, kneeling between his parted thighs. Draco felt himself float on that thread of desire so insane, pulling them closer, so that he knew that when they finally did touch, after all this, it would be like crashing, like a tornado meets a volcano, like two powerful spells striking in midair.
It’s all too much. The fixed smiles, the thousand handshakes, the formal attire, the glasses of fancy champagne, the too bright lights, the names of all of the fallen, which you repeat year after year in your speech, the memories, always the memories, the eager faces of the crowd looking up at you and you wondering: what are they looking at? It never ceases to make you sick to your stomach.
Potter turns to him. This time, Draco can’t look away. He gets the feeling this moment is like those in Muggle movies, almost at the end, when everyone holds their breaths to listen. He does it now.
‘You've known Draco almost all your life. You've watched him for the better part of it. Just put the fucking pieces together.’
We kiss as we walk to the bedroom, clothes scattered on the floor. Draco is so beautiful. He’s under me on the bed, and there’s nothing like the warmth in his eyes. So helpless. So lost. He is in love with me. He’d never let anyone see him like this if he wasn’t.
You laid on your back and watched him summon his wand and make the cleaning spells on the both of you with his usual efficiency. He then accioed his pack of cigarettes from the living room. He caught it with one hand and you watched him light one cigarette with slow purpose. This time, he didn’t offer you one.
‘And here I thought I had seen it all this night,’ she says, her eyes drifting to our hands on his thigh. It’s so fucking intimate, so good, that I smile like an idiot and say nothing in return.
I move over him, finding my own rhythm, chasing my pleasure. His fingers curl on the sheets. His eyes are wide & wet. I have never wanted him this much. I bring my hand to his chest & ride him, slow, slow, slower. He trembles underneath me, his neck corded. He bites on his lip, delaying the moment as much as he can. He looks drunk on me.
His voice is even, soft, it washes over you and for a second you imagine it on your ear, slow and sweet, making you do things.
Harry bit back a curse. If Draco wasn’t so attuned to him, he would have missed it. Draco stared down at him, an eyebrow raised inquiringly. For a moment it seemed like Harry wasn’t going to elaborate further. Then he took a deep breath. His jaw unclenched.
But Josh had followed him, stopped him in his tracks. And was looking at him now, a defying smile on his lips. It would be infuriating if Draco didn’t feel the pressing need to listen to whatever he was going to say.
Harry lost it. His mouth opened to be taken over by Draco’s tongue and he felt he could die, he had never tasted something like that, the only reason he wasn’t falling in a heap on the floor was because he was impaled on Draco’s cock, his wrists still restrained, his body trapped under Draco’s, because he was on free fall inside that mouth. And Draco tasted like coming home and he didn’t know why. Harry moaned inside Draco’s mouth, lost to the world, panting loud, as Draco’s cock fucked into him and his mouth almost ate him alive.
How could a man like Harry let himself go like that? It wasn’t the submission that impressed him, no. Draco had had many submissives along the years. He’d brought several men to the pits of subspace and back again to the living world. He did it easily, for fun, for the kicks, to get himself off
Draco glanced at Josh, who had cleaned himself up and was back next to them, his shirt now hanging loose around his shoulders, his skin bright with sweat and sex.
Harry let his eyes roam freely, now that they could. As he had known, Malfoy was impeccably dressed. He wore a black suit, perfectly tailored to his body, all straight lines and nice cuts and of course it fitted him everywhere. His black shirt was open at the neck, something in between formal and mussed up, like he wanted other people to decide which version of him they wanted. Like an invitation. A provocation of sorts, as everything else in him was. Harry knew which version he liked best. Both. Both of them, this undefined state that was Malfoy, poised, seemingly collected but with spitting fire burning underneath. He looked down, feeling himself blush. He could see the bulge on Malfoy’s trousers, the long defined line of his cock. His mouth watered at the sight.
Harry swallowed. The idea of moaning around Malfoy was shameful, it made him feel too vulnerable. He wanted to take everything Malfoy gave him and it was easier to do it if he didn’t make any sounds.
‘He’ll wait hours if need be,’ Josh added. ‘He’s a good pet as you know, but he’s been waiting for this all week. Do you really want to put him through it?’
I don’t expect the admission to hurt as much as it does. But that’s just the whole thing, isn’t it? I never expected him to come close enough to matter. Much less to hurt me.
‘I wanted him to,’ I go on. ‘I wanted him to fuck me on my bed. So I said I was going to the loo. And came here.’
She looks as impressed by this as she did that one time I saved the world. Which is: not in the least.
“I’m telling you!” Ron laughed, “He had to have been about one hundred and fifty! And he tried to run away using one of those muggle razor blades!”
“No thanks,” Draco grunted, “I’ve got to go to Diagon to get these party supplies, I guess.” Charles let out a short laugh and nodded before leaving Draco behind. He supposed he better get it all over with and grabbed his traveling cloak.
Harry was silent for a moment as he screwed it in tight, holding the shelf in place. “I don’t think so. We’ve only really gone for drinks at the pub.” He threw the rest of his supplies back in his toolbox and urged Ron out of the loo, following behind him. “Are you only here to interrogate me or are we going for lunch?”
After a pint and a half and a lull in the conversation, Harry chanced a look around the bar. Most of the inhabitants were at tables with their mates, laughing and drinking the day away. At the table closest to the exit, a group of tall men in button down shirts and slacks were shouting and laughing with each other. Harry thought they looked like a group on lunch from the Ministry. Harry’s eyes continued to scan the place for anyone he recognized until it landed on a familiar sandy-brown head.
The streamers were up, the harpist had arrived and was setting up in the corner, and Draco was pouring these interesting Muggle candy called “conversation hearts” into different bowls around the room. Before he knew it, Harry Potter was knocking on the threshold.
’. He wanted to grin. No, he wanted to jump up from the table and scream from the rooftops that he and Draco were together. He wanted one of those Muggle contraptions he’s seen at protests in downtown London, the ones like the Sonorus charm that make their voices louder and more grating and more annoying. He wanted to tell everyone he crossed paths with on the street, stranger or not. He wanted to kiss Draco in public, in private, wherever they wanted. He even, dare he say it, wanted to see what kind of reaction the Prophet would have if they found out. He wanted to see himself smiling and happy with Draco Malfoy on the front cover of an admittedly speculative newspaper, but he didn’t care. He wanted them to be seen together everywhere and he didn’t want to hide it.
Draco’s little book had a home in the pocket of his waistcoat during the day (his bedside table at night) and held Draco’s lifeblood, his collection plans, his notes, everything. If one were to flip through this book, they wouldn’t be able to piece together what individual pages meant, except for perhaps the very last page, which held Draco’s list of bent Gryffindors, ones he’d bedded as well as ones he planned to.
“Actually,” Potter began in a hushed, warning voice, throwing several Galleons on the table without so much as a glance at the check, “I was thinking more along the lines of me hexing your bollocks off.”
The Weasleys had some general inquiries about Harry’s house, now they all knew he’d been inside, but quickly moved on to Ginny’s most recent accomplishment- reserve seeker for the Holyhead Harpies. Harry briefly wondered if there would be a Sunday dinner at the Burrow in which one of them did not have some sort of announcement and celebration. Indeed, just last week Molly had announced that her carrot crop was ready to be harvested and Arthur broke out a bottle of mead just for that. He couldn’t blame them; they had many things to be proud of, especially their children.
Before he could shake his head and say no, he hadn’t gone yet and he wished they would accompany him so that he didn’t end up crying on the floor of an abandoned building, Ron walked in wearing his bright orange Chudley Cannons shirt under the deep red Auror coat. Harry felt a surge of affection for his friend, whose allegiances never seemed to waver. “See what?”
“That’s alright,” the woman — Draco never did clarify her name — started, “I’ve got to be getting home anyway.” Neither of the men paid any attention to her. Draco wasn’t sure what sort of conversation they would be having once she was gone, but maybe it would play out.
Draco folded his book closed, slipping it back where it belonged. He ordered another drink, draining his current one and sliding the glass across the counter to indicate he was done.
Diagon Alley was tame compared to the last time he had walked down the cobbled street. It had been Christmastime and he forgot to get his Aunt Andromeda a gift, so he had to wait in monstrously long lines and get too close for comfort to the people around him. Luckily today was slow. He only passed a few people on his way. He stopped at the florist first to place an order of white lilies, red roses, and pink carnations. After setting the pickup date for Friday, the day before Valentine’s, he continued down the street towards the bakery.
Draco woke up to sunlight seeping in around his curtains. He forced himself to peel his eyelids apart, then immediately shut them again. He tried to reach for his wand for the time, but his head swam. He settled back onto the pillow, letting out a pathetic whimper.
“Malfoy,” Potter addressed without emotion. He then craned his neck to look at the tower, smirking, as if he knew Draco couldn’t possibly place his glass without knocking the whole thing onto the floor, and waved his hand. “Go on, then.” Draco watched Potter for a moment, that smirk throwing him off.
Molly, having had several glasses of wine by now, was less than delicate when she asked the next question. “Are you and he together?”
trees. He felt more alive than when he was playing quidditch. And speaking of the game, his new yard was plenty big for a regulation-sized pitch to practice on.
Someone took the bottle of wine he was carrying, but he didn’t remember who as he was greeted by what seemed like every Weasley in existence. He finally made it to the living room and collapsed beside Ron, who seemed to have broken into the wine early. As the night went on, the whole family talked, ate, laughed, drink, and played numerous games, but mostly drank. It seemed like every room in the house was going to be used as a bedroom tonight, as no one was in any shape to apparate home.
Their lunch was simple, so simple it was gone within a few minutes, but afterward they laid on the grass and took in the smell of the fresh air, feeling the sun beating down on their faces. Every once in a while, a butterfly would flutter above them, but often for only a second or two. Ron finally sat up, leaning on his elbow to face Harry.
Draco shook his head, “Not necessary. I know she’ll be happy.” He paused. “Can’t say the same for my father, however.”
The other Gryffindors eyed Draco at first, but seemed to calm when Thomas took Draco in so easily, as if they were old friends. Draco couldn’t even remember a single conversation he’d ever had with the bloke, but he’d take it.
Draco finally stepped forward into the light, but Harry could still only see his outline. He leaned over the side of the bed to reach his glasses and shoved them on his face. “He’s done it before. He’s senile. I keep telling myself to let him go because he doesn’t do anything around here, not that I really need him to, but I think he’d have a stroke if I did. I feel bad for him.”
Minutes went by, Harry pressed up against the bookshelf, hands tightly gripping the back of Draco’s dress shirt, wrinkling it between his fingers. Draco’s tongue was insistent against Harry’s lips, prying its way inside. The blonde’s hand slid down to rest against Harry’s hip, thumb hooking into the waistband of his jeans. Harry attempted to pull Draco closer, but they were already pressed so tightly together that nothing changed. Harry had just had the thought to slip his hand down over Draco’s arse when there was a short knock on the door. They pulled apart, panting.
Hermione hummed. “That’s what I was thinking. On Tuesday he had me go to his office and he gave he a list of the duties he has to do. Not that he does all of them so much as he delegates them, but I thought it a bit weird. Do you think he’ll make me his personal secretary or something?”
“It could have. Some gates are harder to break out of than the cells in Azkaban, unless you ask it nicely. I know my- Malfoy Manor has a particularly difficult gate, which is why I usually just apparate directly inside.”
He absently ran a finger across his lips as he made his way out of Gringott’s and into the flood of people in Diagon Alley.
“Er...yeah, I suppose,” Harry replied, pushing himself off the couch. “I’ll go change.” He shuffled to the landing and heard Hermione vanish the nearly empty bag of chips.
Later that night, when Wood had made his exit with only a sly smirk sent his way, Draco couldn’t help but think of all the things — well,
Harry only passed two people in the corridor on his way to Draco’s office, both of which were curse-breakers that were too busy speaking to each other in hushed whispers to pay any attention to him. All the better, he thought. He’s not sure Draco is ready to be seen with him in public quite yet. When he reached the door, he opened it without thinking, only to find someone else sitting in his usual seat.
“Tell her,” Draco finished, staring curiously across the table. “Yeah?” he asked after a second. Harry just nodded and forked a huge chunk of egg into his mouth.
That failed to happen, though. In fact, when Longbottom had finally caught sight of him, he’d merely closed his eyes again and smirked. Draco could only imagine him lost in the euphoria of several alcoholic drinks and good music, as Draco, himself, had been nearly there as well. And when Longbottom had dragged him out to the street for “some fresh air”, the space lit up by the moon overhead and a single lamp several doors down, Draco had kissed him.
“Not in the wizarding world, you don’t.” And it’s true. For the past five years, Harry had barely paid for a single thing when he went to Diagon Alley. He was guaranteed bottomless drinks at the Leaky, and ice cream for life when Fortescue’s reopened its doors. He was technically the main investor in the Weasley’s joke shop, but that’s already paid off with the amount of merchandise George sends him every month or two. Several times he resorted to sneakily paying for things. It didn’t seem fair that he got everything for free when he had plenty of gold to pay for it all. Especially when there were witches and wizards like the Weasley family who couldn’t afford much at all.
Draco almost wanted to argue that it wasn’t his fault he was so late. That he drew the short straw and was forced to throw this party. However, he honestly felt incredibly glad it was all working out. The arrangements all looked fantastic and soon his coworkers would be arriving.
Mrs. Weasley rounded around the tree to find them and immediately pulled Harry into a rib-crushing hug. The whole Weasley clan followed behind her, and he saw some raising their eyebrows at the sight of Malfoy leaning on the nearby tree.
Harry and Ron ended up in Ron’s old room, the garishly orange Chudley Cannons posters beginning to fray at the corners. Hermione arrived to the room a short while later and laid down with Ron on the opposite side of the room. Harry had some brief, nostalgic feelings, remembering how they spent months in a tent together. Ron and Hermione both fell asleep quickly, the sound of their rhythmic and slow breathing making Harry’s eyes drift shut. Before he could fall completely asleep, however, the door opened.
“It’s nearly lunch,” Draco smiled down at him, a genuine, if not sleepy, smile that made Harry’s heart melt. As kids, Draco’s expressions mostly consisted of mirth and hatred, but seeing his eyes crinkle around a goofy grin that he strictly reserved for when he was alone with Harry made him want to faint. Harry couldn’t remember what his life was like before that smile, before seeing genuine happiness on Draco’s face. Draco’s cheeks always bulged out when he did it, and many times they flushed red when he saw Harry looking. But to tell the truth, Harry could never stop looking. He was quickly becoming a man obsessed, watching Draco’s eyes light up and his frown lines practically disappear. He had vowed on their first official date to make Draco smile as much as he could, and he mentally extended the vow indefinitely. He’d make the blonde show those teeth one way or another, everyday for the rest of his life if he needed to.
“It appears, unless I’m mistaken, to be the deed to the Potter Manor,” Malfoy said with finality, setting down his tools and fixing Harry with a blank look.
Bippy popped back into existence, startling all three of them as she set the tray on the dusty floor.
“It’s not unheard of. A magical residence needs care and nurturing just as much as its residents do. If things fall apart, they need to be fixed. If it's abandoned for a certain amount of time, like more than twenty years, it needs to trust you before you can enter. Read that,” he gestured to Harry’s hand, “and try those tips.”
The fireplace burned green for a moment before Hermione stepped through. Harry was busy in the kitchen making a pot of tea and packing up some biscuits for the road. Hermione pressed a kiss to his cheek and sat at the table, a round piece of cherry wood that Harry constructed himself.
“Thanks, uh, thank you, Malfoy,” he said earnestly. Malfoy gave him an odd look, as if he as well couldn’t believe that they had managed to have a civil, adult conversation. Malfoy nodded his farewell as Harry took his leave. The door clicked gently shut behind him and he made his way back down the corridor, shoes still squeaking obscenely.
“Merlin, you’re such a prick,” Potter muttered, tugging Draco down on top of him and connecting their lips once more. Draco pressed his hips down against Potter’s, feeling one of Potter’s legs wrap around him. Potter’s tongue wedged its way between Draco’s lips, tasting Draco’s own.
Harry wondered what those legs would look like without any trousers, and then shook his head. He couldn’t help that Malfoy was such a distraction lately, but he had to focus. Though at the moment, he couldn’t quite remember what he was supposed to be focusing on.
“Budge over,” she commanded in a whisper. He rolled his body towards the wall to make room for her and she laid beside him. They faced each other, sharing the pillow. “When are you going to tell him?”
“Of course you focus on that part,” Potter sighed, swirling the ice around in his glass fast enough that if it weren’t for the pounding bass of club music, Draco would probably hear it clinking against the glass.
He felt his shoulders loosen at the friendly touch and he sagged slightly, wondering when his best friend had become so perceptive. “I’m okay. It’s a lot to take in.”
The question caught him by surprise. “I… I guess I forgot about that, to be honest.” He chuckled softly, realizing that he hadn’t thought about the manor since he’d left it the previous day. The past 24 hours had been unstoppable, meeting with Neville and his date with Draco and then lunch earlier that day had made him completely forget about what he’d been obsessing over for the last month. “I’ve been a bit distracted.”
“Here,” Potter placed something in Draco’s hand. It was another heart shaped cookie, but this one was different than the others. While the ones at the party were sophistically, generically decorated, Draco could clearly see that this one had been iced by hand. The background was the same soft pink, but this one has a bright yellow bee iced onto it and big, black letters that spelled out “BEE MINE”.
He felt amazing despite losing the match and hurting his shoulder. He’d forgotten how much he loved playing and even just training for the games. In Harry’s lack of mobility, the other team’s seeker was able to catch the snitch before him, but he honestly hadn’t cared that much.
“That’s it. Outside,” Potter demanded, throwing his napkin onto his empty place and hailing the waiter for the check. They hadn’t even gotten to the appetisers.
The date was terrible. After a good forty-five minutes of waiting they were finally sat, and it took another hour just to get their food. Harry had tried to order wine as a romantic gesture, and ordered the most disgusting wine in the entire world, according to Draco. Then he accidentally spilled it all over the table and into his own lap. And the food was honestly just god awful, Draco had very loudly informed everyone that was around them of that.
The sunlight grew more intense, warming his face and making Draco see red behind his eyelids. He rolled over, burying his face under the covers, drifting back to sleep.
He knew, logically, that there was a possibility he would not like what he found on the other side of the door. It could all be gone. There was no way of knowing until he turned his wrist and pushed. But he couldn’t. It was all too much. When he walked on the grounds, his hopes shot up that maybe everything would be fine as long as he was on the premises, but a pull in his gut reminded him that no one had been there for years to maintain it.
She nodded quickly. “Yes, I think so. Oh! I’d almost forgotten why I came over. Ron said you wanted us to join you at the manor today.”
The desk was covered in parchment. Stacks of file folders were on every corner, and scrolls upon scrolls of parchment piled up on any available space. A container of quills was nicely stocked on one edge, but it looked like it was about to topple over. Harry almost reached out to push it further onto the desk.
The space at the bar was still sticky from spilled drink, but they both took a seat and leaned their elbows on it anyway. Harry’s uniform was still caked in mud, despite even Draco’s attempts to freshen it up.
