Harry took a deep breath, smiling at his friends. “I’m going to go to the Ministry and to do that I need to get into Umbridge’s office, to use the floo.”
Draco scoffed.
Harry felt a blush creep up the back of his neck as he realised Draco didn’t notice the casual affection. “No, I – I really don’t actually,” he smiled. “I asked Teddy if he wants to stay over Christmas,” he added, diverting his eyes from Draco, to stare at the counter. “The only reason he couldn’t was because my job took up too much of my time. I just want to be with the people I care about,” Harry said, looking at Draco and hoping Draco would realise
“No!” Teddy said, shaking his head violently, only to be betrayed by another yawn. “Maybe a little,” he admitted, taking a sip of hot chocolate. “But I have so much to tell you about Hogwarts and my new friends and –“
Suppressing a laugh, Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco who shrugged, his cheeks rosy. “I don’t think he meant it,” he said to Scorpius, joining him in the living area. He grinned as he saw Draco roll his eyes, certain that he saw Draco mutter something along the lines of ‘
After a moment of silence, Harry grabbed Draco's free hand and started to trace along the indents in his palm. Draco gasped at the gentle touch but didn’t protest, so Harry continued. They sat in the presence of each other for what could have been hours. Harry’s mind had been quite preoccupied tonight as they sat in their usual spot on the Astronomy Tower.
ever been pleasant?” he grinned.
Sighing dramatically, Harry flopped back onto Draco's lap. “Your Godfather hates me.”
“He taught Sirius and my Dad,” Harry explained to Draco, who nodded. “I still find it weird we don’t have Muggle card games,” he said, furrowing his eyebrows together before he shrugged.
“Why Ladon?” Harry asked, as they walked across the apartment.
Harry had always loved this time of year, when nature turned into warm colours, as the temperature began to drop. Perhaps it was because autumn was always the time when he was able to escape the Dursley’s – he knew that they were the reason he hated the summer months anyway.
at the Ministry?” Draco asked, placing a hand on the crook of Harry’s back, just as he grabbed the mirror shard, jumping up to sit on his bed.
” he muttered to himself, leaning back on the armchair. “When your friends come to you with an issue, how do you feel?” he asked.
“You heard?” Draco asked, confused as to how.
This was when that something in Harry,
Draco shrugged. “Not everyone agrees with their family, for whatever reason,” he said, getting quieter as he spoke.
,” Harry grumbled quietly before re-joining them.
“Well, I’d have to agree,” Draco muttered.
Harry blinked, tilting his head.
“When isn’t he?” Draco asked jokingly, making Harry chuckle. “So is this a warning for an angry Lupin or concerned Sirius?”
Harry spat, his voice getting louder as he paced.
“Mr Potter,” Madam Pomfrey said sternly, and Harry rubbed the back of his neck. Draco watched curiously as the dog appeared to be smirking.
– the book of tea?” he said, a little unsure.
” he insisted, and suddenly they found themselves at the library.
“Is that a book?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow.
“It’s about remembering the dead,” he said bluntly, sipping on his own cup of tea.
Draco sighed, feeling even worse than before. “So why can’t I use it?”
It was most likely a mixture of things.
He didn’t argue with Narcissa.
Draco’s eyebrows furrowed. “Does that happen often?” he asked, his eyes scrunching up in concern.
“There was a dog that sat with Harry in the hospital wing that did
Harry felt the heat rise in his face for multiple reasons. “I wouldn’t have done anything stupid,” he said, frowning at the accusation.
Harry smiled to himself. “I was unsure if I’d be a good Father,” he said, leaning back on the sofa.
Laughing softly, Harry placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Don’t worry about it, no one can be worse than Ron,” he joked, the corners of his eyes crinkling as he laughed. “
–“ he stammered, and Draco squeezed his hand, rubbing his thumb over Harry’s to keep him calm.
“Kreacher, tell me the truth. Is my cousin, Sirius Black, at home with you?” Draco asked, and Harry saw Kreacher’s ears flatten as he grimaced, unhappy that he had to do what Draco asked.
“What, what did you find?” Harry asked, trying to catch a glimpse, only for Draco to pull it close to his chest.
That made Draco chuckle. “She’s a terrifying woman too, I imagine she gave George quite the earful.”
Then, Harry quickly pulled himself from Draco, his eyes staring directly into Draco’s. Draco felt his face burn. “Why are you here?” he asked, though he didn’t sound upset, just curious.
“You’ve raised a Hufflepuff,” Harry pointed out, suppressing a chuckle at the moment of horror on Malfoy’s face.
Which meant he could spend a few more minutes in bed.
, are you talking shit about Slytherin?” he teased.
Harry laughed again. “Sure Draco, I believe you.” He poured himself another cup of tea and added five teaspoons of sugar.
Blaise sighed, rubbing his arm. “That’s not really the point Pans,” Blaise said, understanding Draco’s fears. His mother was only just neutral, in terms of politics. “If he does get disowned, he won’t be able to
Hermione nodded along. “He might not have lived with you, but you weren’t absent from his life,” she said. “You were there for him, you were his Father, even if the living arrangement didn’t show that, you were.”
“He didn’t?” Hermione asked, as if she thought Harry had misspoken or she’d misheard.
“Perhaps it’s both.”
Draco nodded. “Until next time then,” he smiled, brushing his lips on Harry’s cheek, making his skin tingle.
Ted asked, but the question was ignored.
“Thank you, Draco,” Harry said, smiling at the other.
“Harry –“ Hermione began, but Harry cut her off.
“Unofficially,” George asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Ha!” Draco exclaimed. “I knew you’d slip up at some point.”
“Well, that’s
?” he asked with a knowing smile. “Did you buy anything off the trolly lady?” Draco asked. “Mother helped the house elves make me a few things, but I saw the pumpkin pasties on my way back,” he said, ducking his head with a sheepish smile as Blaise shot him an exasperated look.
, he owns a teashop in Muggle London,” Harry said, running his hand through his hair. “That’s how we met actually.”
“This mirror is marvellous,” Draco muttered, clearly already coming up with a list of spells needed to create such an object. “Harry is fine – well… it’s better if he explains it.”
“About...” he trailed off. Harry nodded. “And you’re concerned he’s going to get caught.”
“All good?” Harry asked quietly and Draco hummed with a nod.
– I quit my job.”
The room filled with an odd silence. “

“I guess, if you’re not visiting,
One thing Harry knew for certain; he was going to find out exactly why this just happened.
It was a bad plan, but the only plan Harry had. He changed his direction, walking to the Gryffindor common room to retrieve the Marauder’s Map.
His mind was spinning, and he felt a little sick, but he wasn’t sure if that was from the nerves or the conversation with Lucius.
Draco shrugged. “We’re fifteen, we can be reckless and naive if we want to -
Zabini raised an eyebrow, his smile softening. Parkinson unfolded her arms, her glare looking less murderous than before. “My threat still stands Potter,” Parkinson shrugged. “Don’t even
he never questioned why Malfoy was on his mind almost all the time like an obsession – like his sixth year.
“Harry, you are
“I’d better be,” Harry grinned. “I think it might be the only reason your Dad keeps me around,” he whispered to Scorpius, who fell into another fit of giggles.
Draco had tried to rationalise what he had overheard; he knew his own father, he must know his own father, and his father would never try to kill someone, even by proxy. It must have been a misunderstanding.
“Mother hasn’t spoken to me since the third task,” Draco said, with a sigh, resting the book against his knees. “I know that Father was there the night
They both sat back down on the bank, closer to each other than before, but entirely unsure of what to do next.
Scorpius pondered the idea for a moment, before looking at Harry. “What do you think Harry?” he asked, as if they were discussing matters of national security.
Instead he stood in the door, opening and closing his mouth, unsure of what to say.
“Just get some rest alright?” she added as she left.
“Told him no, he started kicking up a fuss, so I told him to go fuck himself,” Ron explained, and Harry choked on his own laughter. “What a wanker though. George told me to make sure I banned him from the store.”
“It takes ages to walk there, we should get going.”
Lost in his thoughts, he only noticed Harry enter the café when Pansy coughed, getting his attention.
have the attention span to be able to read a book,” he asked with a raised eyebrow, knowing for a fact that he didn’t. It always drove Hermione mad, that neither Ron nor he would read the textbooks for lessons.
Draco glanced at his watch. “Shit, this took longer than I thought, Mother is going to kill me,” he muttered, earning an incredulous look from Potter. “I told her I’d pick up my son at 4,” he explained, only deepening Potters incredulous look.
“But you like me,” Harry teased.
“He’s a nice kid,” Harry shrugged, watching as Malfoy smiled.
“OK, so I’m
Harry shrugged. “People ask me if I miss my Aunt and Uncle, tell me I should.”
“It’s –
Draco blinked. “Right,” he said, though he was a little unsure of the rules.
“Uncle Harry!”
Draco noticed Harry looked as if he was considering hiding behind one of the shelves. “
“I refuse to accept that,” Draco said, shaking his head. “And stop distracting me, we’re supposed to be having a pleasant ‘
“I’m glad you don’t regret it,” Harry admitted, smiling sheepishly.
“I’d rather like to punch your dad,” Harry admitted, making Draco laugh.
“You got the best job,” Harry said, leaning towards Scorpius. “You can secretly eat the cake batter,” he whispered, smiling as Scorpius looked as if he had just been told the secret of the universe.
people,” Draco said, laughing as Pansy’s eyes widened and her mouth fell open. Blaise failed to supress his laughter.
Harry felt a gentle pull at on his sleeve and noticed Scorpius was looking at him with his eyebrows furrowed. “What does ‘
“Well then, sleep it is.”
“You don’t need to visit me,” Harry said, but they both acted as if he didn’t say a thing.
“Okay?” Draco said, never feeling more confused. It must have shown on his face because when he turned to Harry, the boy shrugged.
Draco said, feeling a swell of pride.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly Potter,” he said, sounding exhausted, but the smile on his face said otherwise.
Upon seeing their confused expressions Remus smiled. “You weren’t the only one I had frequent meetings with Harry,” Remus explained. “Draco took quite a liking to my collection of Muggle classics.”
He was interrupted by Harry placing his hands-on Draco’s face and pulling him in for a kiss. It was gentle. Possibly because Scorpius was behind them, possibly because neither knew exactly how the other would react. It was short but Draco felt his heart flutter and his stomach flip, and his magic explode within like a firework. When they pulled away, both of them were blushing hard and neither knew of anything more to say.
“I’d love to say you’re wrong, but I don’t think you are,” Draco said, a small smile pulling at the corner of his lips – not that Harry was staring at his lips. “Ah ha!’ he exclaimed, pulling a small book of the shelf.
The two sat in silence for a moment, as Harry continued to stare out the window, and Draco noticed he was fidgeting with the bottom of his t-shirt. “I see Cedric die, every night,” Harry said, closing his eyes as Draco’s blood ran cold. “Again, and again,
I have, haven’t I?” Malfoy said, with a small smile towards his son, who was talking to the ducks about the proper etiquette surrounding teacups. He sighed. “It would be better for him than being in Slytherin,” he said.
Malfoy smirked and patted Harry's cheek. "Fair is for Gryffindors, Harry. But oh yes, I think you deserve it."
Malfoy nodded, a tiny smirk on his lips as if he had picked up on Harry's mental image just fine. "Out, Potter," he commanded softly.
"Slut," the bastard whispered into Harry's ear, and repeated the movement, just there. Harry whimpered and met the next stroke with his hips to guarantee the full effect of Malfoy's thrusts.
His eyes searched for his clothes and found them, neatly folded on one of the chairs. He dragged himself over, leaning heavily on the headrest. The mere thought of putting clothes on his soiled body sent a shudder of revulsion through him. He wanted nothing more than to submerge himself in a shower, or a bath, until he drowned or until hot water had scalded away Malfoy's traces from his body, and the memory of pleasure from his mind. But there was no water in Dung's hut; even the chipped washbasin on the chest of drawers was collecting dust at the bottom. And, Harry reminded himself as he reluctantly pulled his trousers over his bruised hips - he could not bring himself to touch his ripped underpants - Voldemort's cohorts might be ringing the place, waiting to drag him off to his death as soon as he set foot outside. He couldn't be found naked.
Harry dove out of the way with reflexes honed in hours of DA training, and then for real in the empty ballroom of Grimmauld Place with Tonks, Shacklebolt and Moody. A curse, hot and sickly yellow, whistled past his face and impacted on the shingles next to the door. Splinters and boards exploded in a cloud of dust. Harry rolled to the side and braced himself against the wall in a half-sprawl, wand raised at the black-clad figure that stood at the opposite end of the clearing. Before his assailant could cast another curse, Harry had regained his breath and flicked his wand.
Malfoy leaned over Harry's pain-wracked body. His mouth touched the corner of Harry's, and then a warm tongue lapped at the blood that coated Harry's chin. Harry squeezed his eyes shut, too weak to tremble.
But of course Snape was nowhere in sight, after shooting his team and Harry in particular dirty looks as they limped off the pitch. Snape would leave it to his House to deal with Harry, and would undoubtedly find his own way of making Harry's life utter hell in the days to come.
At least, Harry assured himself as he tried not to slip on the rain-soaked footpath winding its way along under the trees, he'd come prepared. Ron had slipped him a wicked-looking silver knife that had been part of Bill's Curse-Breaking Kit. Weighing down his other pocket was a large flask with concentrated Essence of Aconite that Hermione had pressed into his hand at the last moment. It wouldn't kill a werewolf, of course, but perhaps send it running, she'd announced, flustered and surrounded by a cloud of potions fumes. Not that Harry planned to stick around to find out!
Ron frowned, placing a hand on Hermione's shoulder as she took a step back. “Harry,” he said, sternly. “We know you have a lot on your mind, and we want to be here for you, but don’t be a prick about it.”
Harry grinned. “Yeah, yeah,” he said, rolling his eyes as he nudged Draco’s shoulder with his own. “I’m guessing that Scorpius told you?”
But what he was asking seemed impossible.
,” before pulling Harry’s face to his and connecting their lips, shocking not only Harry but clearly Malfoy himself, who Harry suspected had never made a rash decision in his life.
Potter grinned, “would it make you feel better if I said I considered it?”
“Good to know,” Draco said dryly with a smile. “How much for the wand?” he asked, reaching into his pockets.
Draco missed Pansy and Blaise.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Prat,” he muttered, making Malfoy chuckle.
A few days passed and Harry had started to notice Ron’s worried glances at Harry as his eyes scanned the corridors for Malfoy – not to mention he had been studying the Marauders map – Ron was certain that Harry was obsessing over his conversation with Malfoy to avoid confronting what he said in Potions – which Harry insisted wasn’t the case.
shut up!” he yelled up the stairs, and Draco put together the comments his aunt and Lupin were making – this was a part of the question his aunt had wanted to ask.
Draco hummed. “You mean a lot to me Harry,” he said, his voice soft.
“Harry?” he heard the voice call again. He couldn’t see who they were because they left the door open. This meant they also couldn’t see him.
“You know,” Cedric began, as the fire crackled and spat sparks on the stone mantle. “Suffering in silence causes more pain to those around you than talking to those who care for you,” he explained. Draco didn’t understand what he meant. “Your friends can
It turns out Harry wasn’t the only one who was happy about their conversation the other day. He noticed whose owl it was immediately, and carefully untied the letter around its ankle.
Just the thought made his stomach twist and turn inside him like a snake.
Platform nine and three-quarters was bustling with noise. Noise from the train, noise from people, noise from trollies being scrapped across the ground. Then there was the overbearing closeness of every single person on the platform.
“I didn’t,” Harry shrugged.
Harry almost dropped the spoon he was holding. “What?” he squeaked, as Draco laughed at Harry’s reaction.
Malfoy laughed, his laughter only adding to the warm welcoming feeling of the shop. Harry didn’t even try and stop himself from grinning in response. “I couldn’t agree more.”
Malfoy,” she glared as she sat back in her seat. “
“You’ll have to go in at some point Pans,” Draco said, carefully stacking yet another box in the kitchen. “Perhaps you’re overthinking it.”
“Probably would,” Draco said, trying not to smile at the comment.
,” Draco grinned. “I am,
“I wasn’t complaining,” Draco said softly, his voice barely above a whisper. Harry felt his breath catch in his throat.
“I wasn’t going to say anything!” Harry lied, curious about what the lady said that made Malfoy so flustered.
But then he remembered that this was the first time in over a week Malfoy was talking to him, and he was acting like Malfoy normally did – which made Harry want to punch that smirk off the prick’s face but it was incredibly mundane compared to all his other interactions that week.
That was one of my Dad’s best friend, right?” he asked, and Harry felt his heart pang at the thought that Teddy didn’t automatically know that.
Harry took a deep breath. “How would you feel about meeting Draco?” he asked, watching as Teddy looked at his toast.
“Scorpius –“ Malfoy sighed.
He tilted his head and kissed Draco on the cheek. “I’m fun, I just don’t consider murder fun,” he smiled, and Draco pouted, making Harry chuckle and gently press his lips to Draco’s. “Have you heard from your mother yet?” Harry asked, knowing Draco had been waiting all week for a response.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “I may be scared beyond my wits, but I have faith in you, and
Beside them, at a separate table, was a young boy with platinum blond hair that curled ever so slightly at the ends – he looked like a smaller version of Malfoy, so much so that Harry was unsure about whether he might actually be Malfoy’s child. The boy was reading, completely absorbed by whatever it was, and Harry was reminded of Teddy whose expression was similar when he was reading a book he enjoyed.
Draco felt his mouth go dry as his mind blanked for any response. “My apologies,” he said, avoiding looking Potter in the eye.
became his partner once they officially joined the force, meant that Harry didn’t mind that he needed to be an Auror.
Biting back his laughter, Harry handed him the card. They were down to four cards, one set to collect, and they had been caught in a loop for the past five minutes. “Draco…” Harry managed to say, before his laughter escaped. “I’ll always end up with three cards, you with one, just give me the card so we can end this,” he pleaded, though it took him a while to say.
“And if you’re playing with his feelings Potter, I will skin you alive and hang you by your throat off the Astronomy Tower,” Parkinson smirked, her eyes venomous.
“Thank you, Andie,” he said.
After an hour of aimless wandering, he realised he had no idea where he was. Then he remembered that didn’t really matter, since he could apparate home if he needed to. He glanced around and saw that he must have wandered deeper into London, as a few shops were scattered about, but the one that caught his eye was a teashop, called
Draco shrugged. “I didn’t notice,” he mumbled into his mug, turning the page of his book. He could feel Harry next to him, leaning over his shoulder to read the book.
“Aren’t you going to ask me about that?” Harry asked, watching for Malfoy’s reaction.
,” Harry chuckled. “And for good reason,” he said, glancing over at Teddy as he put the teapot on the stove. “If it wasn’t for Hagrid, I would have probably been in a lot of trouble,” he said, looking at Teddy to make sure he knew not to enter Knockturn Alley.
which removed the dirt from their clothes and Harry’s hair when they emerged from the tunnel– Draco’s hair was
“Who’s the sentimental one now?” Harry asked with a sly grin, feeling a little warmer than a moment ago.
Draco went to unpack more boxes, but Scorpius pulled at his sleeves.
“Hi George,” Harry said, returning the grin.
“How have I never drunk peppermint tea before, it’s amazing!” Harry enthused, and Malfoy had to bite back another laugh.
Wandering through the halls, he didn’t really remember how he ended up in the foyer outside the Great Hall. He saw Hannah Abbott in the corner of his eye, a look of concern evident on her face. “Draco,” she said, waking him from his mindless wandering. “Are you…” she trailed off as she scanned his face, sighing. “Just, don’t wander too far into the forest, okay?” she said, her smile not reaching her eyes.
Harry bit back a laugh. “That’s Luna,” he replied, watching as Scorpius was still talking to the German Shepard.
Draco elbowed him, still holding his hand. “I’m merely stating a fact,” he said, waving his free hand dismissively. “But one I thought might cheer you up.” Harry saw his smirk in the corner of his eye as he laughed.
“Are you going to tell me what book it is?” he asked.
Draco, this is why I love you,” he grinned at the blond, unaware of the gaping mouths surrounding them and turned back to his friends.
can you be that dense?” Draco said, stifling a laugh.
He laughed. “Shockingly, you’ve said before,” Harry mused, accepting the tea from Draco. The smell of apples and cinnamon began to fill the air as the cakes baked. “What is it with you and cinnamon?”
Draco placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “He would have loved to see the person you’ve become,” he said, smiling warmly. “As would your mother.”
“The twelfth,” she said, smiling at her husband. “I’m sorry I never told you Ted, but we know he’s about as dangerous as a fly, and I’ve only known since we knew he was innocent.”
, don’t go into Knockturn Alley.”
is back, I know that – my father.” He tried to get the words out, but they faltered. He noticed the ink on the parchment was running and realised he must be crying. “Mother will most definitely allow him to disown me now,” he said, balling up the letter and throwing it at the closest bookshelf, biting his lip in the hopes it would stop him from crying.
“I’ll see you tomorrow Harry.”
Draco shot him a look. “The basics perhaps,” he joked, laughing as Harry swatted his arm.
Cedric leaned back, his head hitting the window. “The first night can be rather daunting,” he said, looking straight ahead. “I hated it at first,” he explained, and Draco stared at the boy opposite him. “I had this idea that this house was for average people with no real character,” he said, and Draco knew he had a similar mindset. The Hufflepuff House had always been berated for simply being ‘

“Sorry,” Harry mumbled, burying his face in Draco’s neck.
Andromeda paused, as if seeing whether or not Harry was paying attention. “When he was seven years old, he told me he didn’t mind not having a Dad because he had an Uncle Harry who was
Pansy
“All right,” he shrugged. “I am sorry though.”
“He misses you Harry,” she chastised one day over tea. The two of them were sat in her back garden, watching as Teddy ran around in circles with an energy only known to five-year olds.
"The moon." He says, smiling like he knows a secret Draco doesn't.
Harry shakes his head. "I didn't know how to say what I wanted to. I needed to admit that I was-
He can faintly hear her poorly disguised laughter.
"No." Harry says brazenly, and Draco almost wants to snort in amusement. Trust Harry to care so little about ettiquette. "I'm not leaving until you listen to me."
He kicks the map underneath his bed in a smooth, fluid movement as he stands, stretching upwards and yawning theatrically.
"Does it pay you well?"
He makes a noise of acknowledgement, shifting to the side to settle down next to Draco.
Draco's silent, thinking. "Why are you telling
"Stop laughing at me!" Draco says, sounding every bit the petulant child he was not so long ago.
Ginny Weasley. The only female in the litter of offspring produced by Molly and Arthur Weasley. And, unfortunately,
"Cold, Distant. A bigot. Someone who'd rather be feared than loved." Draco's saying too much, he's being too vulnerable. But Harry's looking at him with those warm eyes, and Draco lets himself get lost in their comforts. "I don't want to be feared, or hated."
"But - Ginny. And you didn't... why didn't you say anything, that night?"
"Deatheater."
- Regarding three months passing - terms start 1rst September. So realistically, a little over three months has passed
Long one this time, to celebrate this fic's one month anniversary! I can't believe how much support this has accumulated over just one months, it's incredible. Thank you so much, guys. Enjoy the chapter (it's packed with fluff and protective Harry, just you wait and see <3)
"You know," Harry says to him lowly when Hermione engages Luna in a passionate conversation about Bavarian Erklings. "It's not your fault either."
Harry shouldn't want him. No, it's not just that.
"No, really. That's alright. She said she'd meet me at a ... certain spot, I should get going." He scratches the back of his neck, and the rather bleak eureka moment hits Draco suddenly.
“It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done—it hurt
He never truly
“We have to, Harry.”
Draco’s voice drawled in his head. Harry huffed a weak laugh, the sound drowned out by the whipping wind and rain. He thought of Draco, curled under his duvet, his hair fanned out on the pillow, his hand empty and reaching for Harry in his sleep.
Harry smiled weakly, unable to speak over the lump in his throat. Molly would probably smack him with her dishtowel. Andromeda would glare until he cowered. He’d never known his own mother, but she would probably disapprove of him saying such a thing.
Harry opened his mouth, but paused, furrowing his brows.
They continued staring for a moment, until Potter slowly raised his hand to point at the wire-framed glasses on his own face, his lips twitching in barely concealed amusement.
but his impulse control was notoriously bad. Besides, he couldn’t think of another solution, and the tried and true Gryffindor method of just
Slow, careful footsteps, rounding the island, coming closer. A long, heavy sigh. The air behind Harry grew warmer, and he tried not to flinch as warm hands landed lightly on his shoulders, but he couldn’t help it. He let out a shuddering breath, his body still fighting the aftermath of all that aimless adrenaline, that cold, harrowing fear, that suffocating grief.
Draco’s mouth dropped open, instantly regretting ever making Pansy talk,
“Rose, this is Draco Malfoy,” Hermione said, petting the girl’s head. “He’s, erm… an old schoolmate of ours. He’s a friend.”
and Draco couldn’t let him have the last word before he left, though it felt like Harry had it, anyway, with that unexpected wink.
“I quit,” Harry says. He can’t help the tiny, weightless smile that admission brings, and Draco seems too shocked to mirror it.
“And you’re
Draco took a deep breath, and caught himself rubbing his chest. He quickly returned his hand to the armrest, but Harry stared at his chest now, as if he could see through the fabric.
The echo of Harry’s voice continued reading for another five minutes, the volume gradually decreasing. Scorpius was always quick to fall asleep, when he actually
If Draco knew the Unspeakables were responsible, he’d storm right up to their front door. Then all they’d have to do was throw a
“Mother,” Draco said quietly. “Are you alright?”
They wheeled her into an empty room, with Harry still attached to her hand.
“Get out,” he growled.
“Alright, fifth year,” Draco mumbled, preparing himself. He raised his wand, waited for Harry’s nod, and cast himself into Harry’s head. Harry had brought him to the very end of fourth year, where they had left off last time.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked. Potter didn’t answer, just continued watching him.
“Point,” Draco grumbled, going quiet. Then his shoulders started shaking, quick puffs of air hitting Harry’s neck, and finally, he was laughing, which allowed Harry to laugh, too.
“Er… to be honest, I don’t know. We were on Willem’s boat, in the North Sea, and it was pretty rough weather, and it was dark, but I passed out the second I waved my wand. I may have been struck again, I don’t know, I hit my head at some point,” Harry fumbled. He brought the cutting board to the hob and scraped the chopped onions and veggies into a pan, stirring them in hot oil, filling the silence with a quiet sizzling sound.
to be found, and I have no idea why they bothered hiding it at all.”
Then the air exploded with a deafening
Harry shook his head yet again, and decided he needed the notebook after all.
Ron seemed tense, ready for a fight to break out at any second. “Look, Draco,” he said, causing both Harry’s and Malfoy’s eyes to widen comically, “I’ve seen him work a couple times, and all he does is stand around like a creep and watch. He won’t impede the investigation, I’ll make sure of it. I unfortunately don’t have the power to keep the Unspeakables from sticking their swotty noses in other peoples’ business.”
Harry raised his hands.
Draco was delighted to see Rose, introducing her pompously to Timsy, who curtsied politely at her, making her giggle. They settled in the sitting room, Rose taking her time choosing the perfect cushion to sit on. Draco chatted seriously with her over the merits of each one, and Harry couldn’t hide his fondness, which made Ron roll his eyes.
“They’ll probably have a hold of poor Weasley all day,” Malfoy muttered, still grinning, his silver eyes brighter than the dawn itself. “Fancy a walk?”
“I told you to
spell, to see the danger, but Harry was focused entirely on him, searching his face, eyes landing on the bruise on his cheek, the blood that had dripped onto his shirt. He lowered his wand, and inside his head, Draco was screaming.
“I’m honestly quite afraid I’ll just muck it up,” he admitted.
“Because it’s not important,” Harry glared.
Draco’s loose, damp hair fell over Harry’s face, closing off the outside world. Draco moved against him, urgent and strong, barely pausing for breath. Harry felt dizzy with it, and his hands wandered helplessly, his fingers pressing into the heated skin of Draco’s back under his jumper, pulling him even closer.
so badly,
was happening.
“I hate doing this,” he admitted. It was somehow easier to admit it to Potter. “But it’s an integral part of my work. You’re undoubtedly going to feel extremely vulnerable. I’m going to enter your mind, four times a week, and I have to see everything, Potter. I don’t know if you ever learned Occlumency after Severus tried to teach you—” Potter snorted at this, “—but you can’t hide anything from me, while I’m in your head. I’ll see embarrassing things, personal things, grief and joy and pain and all the rest. Someone forced you to hide your own voice away inside your mind, which means we’ll have to look for it, and leave no stone unturned.”
Harry jerked back.
“Of fucking course,” Draco snickered. “I don’t even doubt that, you know, I know it must be true, but it’s so… it’s
His fingers buried themselves in Harry’s hair, so much thicker and softer than Draco had ever imagined it’d be, and he could admit he’d imagined quite a bit.
“I’m sorry, mate. It’s true, he is the best at what he does. All the Healers on this floor recommended him. He’s in high demand, and we’re lucky he’s got the time to take on this case at all.”
“I’ll apparate away from here before it goes off, so it can’t be traced to you, alright?” he said.
“You know you’re safe here,” he reminded Harry. “I won’t pass judgement on you, and nothing in there can hurt you now. If it gets to be too much, if I feel your body responding in panic or shock or anything else dangerous, I pull us out. If you need me out before then, snap your fingers. I’ll hear it.”
His cell was in the emptiest—and perhaps the draftiest—corridor. The barred iron door was left open, so Harry could move freely, to and from the mess hall and out to the grounds when he needed the air.
The haze in his brain was clearing as the pain slowly subsided, and he realized he could not remember who had kissed who first, who had started that at all. Draco had started it with the dancing, which was unethical in the first place, but they had moved closer simultaneously, Harry’s hand had definitely moved to his hair, Draco’s nose had moved to Harry’s ear—
Gripping the wand in his undamaged hand, determined not to be parted with it except by death, Harry peered around the half-open door. The drizzle had set in again sometime during the night, and the morning was bleak. Grey skies shed their water, and the little clearing looked deserted with leaves clustered around now-lifeless roots. Draco Malfoy - wolf or man - was gone.
Malfoy was looking back at him, a raw, almost vulnerable expression on his face. His mouth twisted into a pained grimace, as if more teeth than could be accommodated were taking shape behind the tightly shut lips. He let go of Harry's shoulder. Even as he drew back, Harry saw that the pale skin of his arm was now covered with whitish fuzz. His fingers curved, gnarled as if they were being broken and then put together again with extra joints. At the tips, his nails tapered into points.
"Do you want to know how, Harry? You were so smug pointing out that I didn't kill Dumbledore - did you think I earned the Dark Lord's praise that way, ignoring my orders in front of a group of Death Eaters?" Malfoy's lips drew back in an animalistic twist that exposed the tip of his canines. "He was furious. He wanted to punish my father. So he thought that giving me to Greyback would be a nice touch."
Bastard, Harry thought grumpily, but gave it a few more licks just the same before suckling it experimentally. Malfoy's skin didn't taste unpleasant - salty, and very warm. Harry could feel the nub tightening further under his tongue. He bit down sharply for vengeance's sake, and heard Malfoy's gasp. The boy arched his back like a big cat.
"Enough," Malfoy interrupted, stepping bodily between Harry and the glowering seventh-year, forcing Jugson backwards. "I'll be your second if it comes to that, Potter, but right now it's your abysmal performance on the pitch we're concerned with."
"I don't like doing things by halves." The infernal bastard shrugged and leaned into the pillows in a casual sprawl. "You promised to submit to your captain - would you rather I dragged you out and thrashed you in the common room for all to see?"
Malfoy laughed callously and pressed the very tip of his thumb against Harry's clenched opening. An "Accio!" later, something cool and round wobbled into existence on Harry's back. Harry bucked, but Malfoy had already snatched it to safety.
Malfoy stroked the tense skin between Harry's shoulder blades. "Thanks for the offer - I'll keep it in mind."
"Yes, Malfoy," Higgs's younger brother Reginald threw in, face staring up aggressively from under a shock of sandy hair. "He's your lover, isn't he?"
The bruise on Harry's chest where the second Bludger had impacted still burned, but it was the scrape on his head that left him with a pounding headache.
Malfoy slid the brush over Harry's bare bottom, and Harry felt the tingle of cold metal even though the inlay was fused seamlessly with the wood.
Yes, Tonks and Kingsley had gone through the hut in the woods that Dung had used to stack stolen cauldrons and whatnot. But they hadn't known what to look for. Harry knew he could not rest until he'd searched the place and seen with his own eyes that the Horcrux wasn't there.
Harry wanted to scream, but fear filled his lungs and his throat. His eyes were painfully wide. The warped hand raced towards his face as if in suspended animation, nails and fingerbones lengthening even as Malfoy swung. Curved white claws gleamed before Harry's eyes, then the werewolf twisted his paw around and his knuckles caught Harry's temple right over the bruise where Malfoy's boot had come down earlier.
"Now, Harry..." Malfoy hooked one long leg around Harry's calf, trapping him in place.
Then he screamed out loud as Malfoy bit down on his shoulder with teeth so sharp that Harry wondered whether he was already in the throes of transformation. He gave a final, brutal thrust into Harry and came, nails raking down Harry's side as he twisted in his own release, drawing blood without making a sound. Harry felt Malfoy's harsh, wet breaths as the Death Eater slumped heavily against his back for a moment, before drawing back and pulling Harry onto his back along with him.
The tight rage trembling in Malfoy's voice was unsettling. It scared Harry as much as the claw marks on the young man's side and stomach, which still seemed to pulse with blood underneath that had been running free once, and longed to spill out again. If Harry had been able to move, he might have given in to his sick impulse to touch them.
Harry's hand reflexively went up to the bump on his temple. "If those two losers-" he glowered at the bulky figures framing his accuser, "- had guarded my back instead of yelling at the Gryffindor captain, their Beaters wouldn't have mopped the pitch with me!" At least the duo had the decency to shuffle and look guilty.
"You're not a monster for having those instincts," he said softly, even though he wasn't really sure - you had to be pretty twisted to molest an enemy like this. But Dumbledore had died to confirm his faith in Malfoy. "You'll only become a monster if you behave like one."
Malfoy! The wolf! That claw, coming at his face!
He crooked his finger at Harry. "Come here, Potter."
"Couldn't I?" Malfoy inquired.
It was a mutual sentiment, of course, and yet something tightened in Harry's chest. They'd been school enemies, eager enough to strike out viciously, but on killing terms? Harry recalled the few agonising moments he'd knelt beside Malfoy's trembling body in the sixth-floor bathroom, trying to staunch Malfoy's blood and pleading soundlessly for something to catapult him out of that utter nightmare. And Malfoy could have cast the Killing Curse instead of breaking Harry's face on the train, without anyone to stop him. No, Harry refused to believe it. Malfoy was a right evil bastard, but not a killer.
Harry heard a lid being unscrewed, and then Malfoy's fingers returned to his hole, coated with something slippery. The initial cold vanished as the substance warmed on Malfoy's fingers. Harry bit down on his lower lip until he tasted blood and buried his face into the mattress as Malfoy pushed a slick finger into him. It burned, though not as much as Harry had been expecting. The shame was much worse, with the picture he had to be making for Malfoy looming luridly in front of his inner eye.
"You see, Harry," Malfoy murmured when the side of Harry's face was clean, and wet. "You won't win this time."
Then Malfoy dug fingers into Harry's hips and pulled them up against his own in a vicious thrust, and wound a cruel hand around the base of Harry's prick, clamping down and pinching orgasm right out of Harry's mind.
Harry exhaled and closed his eyes for a second. Last night's session with Snape had torn his memories loose until they floated disjointly around inside his brain. He'd been way too exhausted for proper Occlumency, even more for a seven-hour match, and now he wanted nothing more than to collapse on his bed and let sleep soothe his feverish thoughts. Best get this over with.
It was too much, and too full, but it reached deep, and when Malfoy moved out a bit, and thrust in again at a slightly different angle, it brushed against something inside Harry that sent sparks of lust through his entire frame. His surprised squeak drowned in Malfoy's chuckle.
"I always wanted to do that," Malfoy said conversationally. "I did wonder how it would feel."
Harry's prick hardened with every squeeze of that warm hand around him, the heat in his groin chasing back the multiple aches of his body. Pleasure bubbled to the centre of his consciousness, and the urge to close his eyes and moan softly against Malfoy's skin grew stronger.
"Nice, Harry," he smirked and shifted his upper body to give Harry access to his other nipple. His hand trailed down, fingers curling around Harry's prick in a tight ring even as he flicked the tip with his thumb. Harry muffled his moan against Malfoy's nipple, aware that the bastard could probably feel the vibration on his skin. He was hot all over, sweat beading on his forehead. It would be so easy to give in to the amazing sensation of his prick and balls tightening... To forget who was doing this to him, and that the moon was fat and round beyond the barred window, and that Harry had only a short time before its pull would reach into the boy above him and turn him inside out.
Harry screamed as the curse sliced through him, splitting his head and his chest and every cell of his body. He writhed in the loveless embrace of the roots, trying feebly to escape. When the curse was lifted after a few seconds, he remained unmoving and facedown. The aftershocks were still trembling through his nerves, but as far as Cruciatus went, he'd had worse. Still, he didn't stir as the Death Eater took a few careful steps towards thim.
"Granted," Malfoy continued, "I was a bit older than Greyback's usual prey of choice, but well, he decided that there were other... interesting things he could do to get his kicks."
Remus would kill him if he found out. But the last time Harry had seen Remus he'd been tucked under a blanket on a musty couch at Grimmauld Place, plied with honeyed tea by Tonks and having a lie-down after the ravages of a night under the full moon.
The sheer force of the blows sent Harry's buttocks ablaze, and he cringed with mortification as the heat spread through his groin and he felt his prick respond. Malfoy felt it too, the sick fuck, and took a moment to rearrange his thighs until his own hardness pressed right up against Harry's. It was all Harry could do to stifle a groan.
It was this niggling feeling that gave him the courage to open his eyes at last. Which was exactly as painful as he'd been dreading. His dilated pupils caught the light, little though there was, and it pierced his brain like a second needle in his forehead. He was too weak to groan but twisted his face into a pained grimace. His lips were cracked and stung when he touched them with his tongue.
"No, Harry. The Dark Lord had me turned into a monster for a reason; he would not want the easy way out for you."
Finally, Malfoy leaned forward for a nip at Harry's tailbone before settling between Harry's legs, spreading them even further in the process. Harry couldn't help but struggle against the belt that bound him. If he could only get his hands free! But no, as much as he hated lying there with his legs spread like a dead frog while Malfoy exposed his arse hole, the bastard would probably just hit him over the head if he fought. Harry's neck crawled and burned as if there were ants burrowing under his skin.
Higgs looked as if he was about to burst a blood vessel or go for his wand any second, even though Malfoy was well-guarded and obviously ready for a fight. The crowd around Reg Higgs actually had to grab his arms. Malfoy gave them his most acid-dipped sneer and nodded at Harry.
Harry took a few deep breaths and tried not to think of his wand, just within reach inside his robe. It wasn't the trashing he was worried about, even if he felt bruised already and less than resilient after a gruelling match. No, Harry was all too aware that Malfoy liked him without his pants. And this whole setup was exactly the warped thing Malfoy enjoyed getting up to in bed, which tended to leave Harry squirming with shame afterwards at his own reaction.
The name 'Fenrir Greyback' had been bandied about by the few hardened punters who had dared to brave the atmosphere of gloom blanketing Hogsmeade to venture into the Three Broomsticks when Harry had slipped in for a butterbeer and a bit of warmth before starting into the woods. Their suspicious looks had nearly burned the skin off his neck, bundled up though he was in his concealing cloak.
"But you want to, don't you?" the bastard murmured. "Snape told us about that night you and the Mudblood and the Weasel were almost eaten by Lupin. Were you scared, Harry?"
"That was before you missed the Snitch." Malfoy shook his head. "You could've asked for an interruption, or to be taken off - Harper could hardly have played worse."
He'd had support at the beginning of term when everybody had expected him to challenge Malfoy over captainship. Harry's eyes brushed the rest of his team, stopping for a moment on Christian Vaisey's cold face. The fifth year - a brilliant chaser and easily Malfoy's equal on a broomstick - had offered to back Harry, together with a handful of people who wanted to try out for the team, but not put up with Malfoy's methods. Disappointed by Harry's refusal, they would think it only fair that Malfoy was now cementing his authority at Harry's expense.
Malfoy would remember third year, of course. Marcus Flint had whipped them both with his belt over the sinks in the Slytherin changing room after Harry had fainted when the Dementors rounded the pitch, and Draco had gone after to break his fall, leaving the Snitch to drop right into Cedric Diggory's lap. That was the price for letting down your team. Draco had sobbed under the blows while Harry hadn't, silenced by a sick, shifting agony in the pit of his stomach, worse than the lashes themselves - the knowledge that it was his fault that Draco was being hurt. They hadn't lost a game since, but it had never been forgotten either.
"Don't panic," Malfoy sneered, moist breath shivering over the sting of the bite. "It's not time yet."
"Let me go!" Harry shrieked as soon as his mouth was free again, a bitter taste clinging to his lips.
Malfoy smiled thinly. "Oh, no, Harry. You see, the Dark Lord has lost his personal interest in you." He sauntered closer, wand held loosely between black-gloved fingers. "His Death Eaters are merely under orders to kill you wherever they find you."
Then he swung, a single blow connecting with Harry's face and knocking him down onto the mattress. The back of his head hit the headboard, and a sickening black wave crested over his brain. He tasted thick blood at the back of his throat, and his jaw felt as if it had been shattered with a hammer. For an endless moment he struggled for consciousness, and when he opened his eyes, he looked right at the tip of Malfoy's wand.
"I guess he was fucking cousin Sirius to get rid of the tension," Malfoy insinuated viciously. "I'm surprised that he didn't try you after the mutt died." He brushed his thumb over the outline of Harry's prick underneath the denim, and Harry squeaked in protest. "Fenrir Greyback tells us that the instincts of the wolf are all that matters. Everyone who's not pack is food - or entertainment beforehand." His mouth twitched. "That's the law among monsters."
Slowly, the smile reappeared, but sharper, a lot sharper.
"Next time, come to me directly when you need it," he whispered, stroking Harry's hair where it curled damply against his neck.
"Arcturus," a gravelly voice announced from the wall, one Harry had last heard breaking in pain as it had protested the pronouncement of Sirius's death. Phineas Nigellus had slipped soundlessly back into his frame, returning, Harry assumed, from the darkened corridors of Hogwarts and the empty study of its Headmaster.
"Of course I was!" he snapped, noticing how unnaturally warm Malfoy's hand felt against his clammy skin. As if he was burning up with fever.
Harry struggled weakly, trapped between Malfoy's unforgiving hand on his back and the bespelled brush, while helpless fury bubbled inside him - it wasn't fair, he'd been hurt, he was hurting and it was all too much and how could he be leaking onto Malfoy's trousers as he beat him! He screamed and sobbed, beating and clawing at the carpet just to distract himself from the spiralling twin agony in his arse and in his groin, while the blows never once let up or slowed until he writhed, his neck and spine a single painful curve, and spilled himself into the cradle of Malfoy's lap with a sound like a dying cat in the gutter.
Harry let the force of the thrusts wash over him, turning his head to the side so he could breathe without having his mouth stuffed full of blanket, and tried feebly not to respond too enthusiastically. The tight pressure in his balls increased, but Malfoy's grip around his cock prevented his climb towards orgasm. He squeezed his eyes shut, and felt tears of frustration burn in their corners.
Then darkness claimed him.
Face suffused with heat, Harry shrugged out of his robes and fumbled with his belt. He felt as if he had two left thumbs, but finally managed to get the trousers off and step out of them. He kept his eyes firmly on Malfoy's knees, even as a muffled snicker came from behind. He couldn't distinguish whether it was Zabini or Nott - they were probably both grinning.
"It's our best bet so far," he'd told them resolutely. Grimmauld Place had been Regulus Black's home. They had seen the antique locket that might have been Voldemort's Horcrux while cleaning up the house two years back. Only to have it vanish, Kreacher pleading squeakily that he'd returned it to its accustomed place, not taken it to the Malfoys. And Harry had caught Mundungus Fletcher with trinkets stolen from Grimmauld Place at the Hog's Head last year.
There it was, pleading in spirit if not in words. Because Malfoy was right, he was scared, and Malfoy was the sort of coward who might hesitate to dirty his own hands, but perhaps not to turn his back and leave Harry to his fate. Sirius's cousin. It was ironic, Harry realised, the blot on the Black tapestry looming large in his mind. Both willing to feed their enemies to the wolves.
Harry gave her a grateful look, but she didn't smile back. They were friends, but Millicent, too, took Quidditch rather seriously.
Hell, Harry wanted to see Malfoy again! Wanted so badly to talk to him, to curse him till he writhed on the ground, choking on his own screams. To throw him to the ground and pummel his face into a bloody pulp. To shove him up against the wall and kiss him speechless, perhaps.
~ finis ~
And yet, for an instant he almost thought he was seeing the older Malfoy in place of the younger, despite the ferret's slighter build. There was real rather than forced self-possession in Malfoy's posture, a more subtle smirk on his face, and an air of confidence that hadn't been there before. Certainly not during the past year. As if Draco Malfoy had finally remade himself in his father's image rather than feebly trying to imitate him.
"In the nights of the full moon we have the strength of the wolf, even in human form." Malfoy paused, licking his lower lip purposefully. "In the nights of the full moon we have all the instincts and urges of the wolf."
The robed figure gave a satisfyingly high scream and fell in a whorl of inky cloth, Harry still clinging obstinately to his foot. With his free hand, Harry scrabbled for his wand in a snake-like tangle of roots. His enemy struggled back onto his feet just as Harry managed to tear the wand free.
Malfoy's explorations went deeper than Harry would have thought possible, and though having something stuck into an opening that wasn't made for such exertions was uncomfortable, the oily stuff made the intrusion easy and dulled both the stretch and the bite of Malfoy's nails.
He limped back to the bed and shuddered in disgust as he took in the soiled mattress. The blanket was bunched up, and still warm under Harry's hand. A patch of fine, silver-white fur stuck to the rough fabric. The blanket smelled burnt and fresh at the same time - like animal.
Which wasn't to say that it made Malfoy's smirk any less aggravating. Obviously he hadn't done badly out of his flight to Voldemort. In retrospect, Harry regretted the frisson of pity he'd occasionally felt for the little bastard over the past months.
Harry's stomach clenched. If Malfoy was working with the werewolf that had killed Dung... if he left him here, unable to move a finger, left the door open with a monster waiting outside...
He didn't let go of Harry's arm, though, as he steered Harry's body over to his four-poster. Harry stumbled along, still in shirt tails with his bottom half naked and his prick dangling spent between his legs. Malfoy drew back the coverlet and urged Harry in onto his stomach. The linen felt blissfully cool under Harry's flushed skin.
Malfoy's cock was a dark pink, heavy and curving arrogantly upwards. A colourless drop of fluid trickled from the fully emerged head. Malfoy caught it with a salacious smirk and rubbed it over the slit. His head dipped back a little, eyes half-closed in pleasure, unmindful of Harry's eyes on him. Somehow, Harry couldn't bring himself to look away even as his cheeks blazed.
Again, Malfoy smiled that vague, amused smile that made Harry's neck prickle. He shifted and his hip touched Harry's limp arm. Harry's skin crawled as Malfoy's hand brushed aside a few strands of hair plastered to his forehead.
"It wasn't my fault!" Harry snarled when the carpeted door to the common room had fallen shut behind him, and he found himself facing a half-circle of angry housemates.
A churning, hot feeling rose in Harry's gut as he felt the trap close around him. He glared at Malfoy. First names belonged in bed, not in the common room. Malfoy grinned unapologetically and pointed to the door that led down to the dormitories. "Sixth year boys' dorm. Now."
"It's all right now," Malfoy murmured, gruffly brushing sweat-soaked strands of hair out of Harry's face.
"If that's what you want," he smirked. He tapped the wooden tip against Harry's collarbone and ran it down his chest. "Finite Incantatem!"
His nemesis, predictably at the head of the group, cocked his head. "You missed the Snitch and cost us the game and the Quidditch Cup, Potter!"
Aware of Harry's gruelling workload, Draco had offered Harry the less stressful Chaser position the beginning of the school year. In retrospect, Harry was painfully aware that he shouldn't have snorted quite so contemptuously at the thought of Malfoy taking over as Seeker, even knowing that Snape would never have given his permission. It still rankled with Malfoy that he'd never been Harry's equal with the Snitch.
Harry groaned inwardly. "I was hit by two Bludgers!"
Harry exhaled very softly. He didn't want Malfoy to die, not when he seemed more alive than ever before. But he didn't want to die himself, either. He'd been chosen to defeat Voldemort - he could not end here, prey to Draco Malfoy. Dumbledore, Sirius, his parents - they would all have died in vain.
Trying hard to ignore the thumb that stroked his length until an unwelcome stiffening betrayed him, Harry sought to catch Malfoy's eyes.
"I was there, under an Invisibility Cloak." Harry shrugged, or rather gave the woefully feeble twitch that the spell allowed his neck muscles. The memory of who had killed that night ate at his stomach, a pain as acute as his injured head.
Harry had a moment's mental flash of Greyback, shaggy grey hair, yellow teeth, with blood caking his nails, slavering over the body of Draco Malfoy sprawled naked and bound on a bed. He saw hairy skin sprouting into an equally shaggy pelt, sharp nails into claws, and squeezed his eyes shut until they hurt, biting his tongue to chase the image away. It was only his imagination, not a memory picked from Malfoy's brain - Malfoy, too, had been trained in Occlumency!
"Oh yes. He was slow and stupid and weighed down by that suitcase of his. And he had something I wanted."
"I was weak there on the tower," Malfoy said. "I won't be weak ever again."
Hilarity crinkled the corners of Malfoy's eyes. They had been plain grey before, but now they were almost silver; like Remus's, Harry suddenly realised, ordinary honey brown but sometimes acquiring an amber shade when the full moon approached. Malfoy tightened his hand, and Harry's breath rattled in his lungs.
Nervously, Harry checked his watch. It wasn't even five yet, moonrise was way off. He'd have enough time to find and search the hut, then Apparate out before it got dark.
Malfoy smirked. With a quick "Diffindo!" Harry's trousers vanished, only to reappear in a crumbled heap on the floor next to the bed. Harry yelped and tried to curl into a protective ball, but froze when Malfoy's wand tapped against his Adam's apple.
Harry could think pretty excruciatingly bad, but shut his mouth and pressed the side of his face into the mattress before he could spill something unfortunate, like a plea. There was nothing he could do to stop the Death Eater, but he would not beg.
"Stupefy!" Harry tried again, followed by a quick, "Reducto!" that snapped at the man's heels as he dived out of the way of the first spell. The Reductor Curse hit home, blasting its target several feet across the clearing. With a surge of triumph Harry dove after him, intent on finishing his enemy with another stunning spell. If he could bring in this Death Eater, Veritaserum might just give them a lead on Mundungus's death, and the Horcrux!
Again, Malfoy summoned his wand from the floor. His low "Scourgify!" rushed in a prickly wave through Harry's insides and over his skin. The sweat vanished from his back and face only to break out anew in a rush of panicked heat when Malfoy touched a thumb to the nasty spot between Harry's buttocks. Every muscle in his body, from his toes to the tendons in his neck, stiffened in raw panic.
At the very bottom, hardly noticeable against the heavy seam, he touched a small bundle of cloth. Gingerly, he pulled it out. It lay on his palm, a piece of metal swaddled in silk. When Harry loosened the knots, it unfolded itself into a handkerchief, embroidered at one corner with an elaborate 'M'. Inside gleamed a heavy, old-fashioned silver locket.
The Higgs brothers had been on the war path ever since Snape had replaced their eldest, Terence, with Harry as Seeker at the beginning of his second year. Although Snape hated Harry like nobody's business, he was also very keen on the Quidditch Cup and enjoyed boasting about Slytherin's victories in front of Professor McGonagall.
Malfoy, who had known what he had in the Horcrux, who had slaughtered Dung Fletcher to get it. And who had slipped it to Harry instead of carrying it, in triumph, to Voldemort. Taking, in exchange, nothing more than a tumble with Harry's body on a mouldy bed in a fence's hut.
And now Dung was messily dead, and it was just too much of a coincidence - a vanished Horcrux, a werewolf...
The sharp bark of Malfoy's laughter startled Harry. "You know nothing, you stupid, Muggle-raised halfblood! The Dark Lord may elevate us because we're useful to him, but to the wizarding world - to the purebloods families - we're nothing but animals. If my father were free he'd put me down like a rabid dog."
Malfoy balanced his hands above Harry's shoulders before lowering his groin over Harry's prick, which hadn't flagged since Malfoy had taken his hand away. Harry mangled a moan deep in his throat as Malfoy's cock pressed against his, hot and hard and sticky with precome. The sensation fizzed right up his spine, where it seemed to burn a hole into his brain. He found his body pressing up to seek more of that delicious friction. Malfoy chuckled and wound his fingers into Harry's hair before laying sharp teeth against his exposed throat. Harry shuddered deeply, his pelvis freezing at the implications.
"Harry," the bastard acknowledged with a slight dip of the head, as if they'd always been on first-name terms.
Malfoy opened the kit and took out a phial of pale-golden liquid. Harry eyed it suspiciously, but relaxed when he recognised the mild anise smell the Prince had described wafting up when Malfoy undid the stopper. Malfoy handed the phial and a cotton pad to Pansy, who hovered dutifully nearby. Harry didn't particularly want to owe Malfoy more than he already did, but he wasn't going to pass up on a dose of Allsoothing Ointment at 120 Galleons a bottle. He was too groggy for pride, and judging from the look of things, he'd feel worse before the day wore off.
"Regulus A. Black," he'd read aloud. "I wonder what A. stands for."
Malfoy, who had sworn to kill him, and yet had let him walk out into the morning rain alive.
Harry looked around—he hadn’t even noticed they’d arrived at the meeting place.
Draco hesitated at the door to the shed, trying to preserve his good mood, but it was no use. He’d be in the air soon, anyway. He pulled open the door.

flying.
Harry rounded the island, easing in next to him and taking the tea from his hand. Draco pressed his lips together and took a step back, balling his fists. Harry silently scooped the tea leaves, pouring hot water into the mugs and giving each a little stir, just as Draco would.
Draco quickly looked away, but kept that puzzled frown on his face for the rest of the evening.
The second Draco tried to move, however, the tiny figure flinched violently, which made Draco’s heart ache.
And every time, Draco would click his tongue and roll his eyes as he beckoned Harry over, as if this wasn’t his favourite part of the day. Harry would give him a knowing smile and sit in front of him, water droplets marking trails down his smooth, bronze shoulders, over freckles and scars. Draco would comb through the dark tresses with his gentlest touch, collecting the lawless locks in his hand, mesmerized by the contrasting shapes they made against his pale skin.
In seconds, the half-open door was blown off its hinges by Timsy, followed by Pansy, who gasped at the sight of them on the floor: Harry, half-conscious and breathless, with Draco on top of him, shielding him with his body. Panicked and frantic that even more people he loved were now in danger, Draco did the only thing he could, and thrust his hand out, pointing directly at the shroud of magic that hid Lucius.
“You think you can just break into my house, after
Draco didn’t answer. Harry suddenly remembered his stir fry, and turned around to toss the veggies before they burnt.
“I’m sorry you lost your mother,” she said, quieter. “I know nothing can replace her. But you should know that the mothers that love you, love you very much. Do you think Molly Weasley would stop c—clucking over you if you were to remind her, like that, whenever you saw her?”

Thank you so much for reading this flangsty gay novel! I'll be adding a bonus chapter soon, of a snippet from Harry's POV. And soon, another post in the series that will include all of my wife’s incredible art. :)

It was the first time Draco had ever thanked him.
“Since Halloween.”
It was one thing to know Harry’s parents died trying to save him, and quite another to witness it. Draco’s fingers itched to reach out and touch Harry, to comfort him, but he couldn’t. He rubbed his left forearm instead, reminding himself of who he was. His hands were shaking.
Malfoy pulled his plait over his shoulder and tucked a loose strand behind his ear. Harry’s gaze fell to a thin, pale scar, running up from under the collar of his jumper, ending just over his jawbone—effectively wiping out any trace of amusement in Harry’s mind.
“Yes, who else?”
pocket, deliberately, with zero fanfare, as if it were just something that belonged in Harry’s pocket.
“Granger,” Draco nodded at her, “you have a lovely home.” He glanced over at Weasley, to include him in the sentiment, which was true: the cottage was lovely, filled with warm colours and hand knit blankets and plenty of photographs. There was a gentle fire going in the hearth in the sitting room, and the whole thing felt rather comforting, soothing Draco’s nerves a bit, even as his eyes darted around in his typical paranoia.

“Kheer,” Draco answered, wincing at his breathy voice. He cleared his throat, trying to cool down, but his hands landed on Harry’s thighs anyway. “Extra naan.”
He held her up to his face, examining her. Harry watched with barely contained fondness, pressing his lips together to stifle the silly grin.
Harry inhaled deeply, trying to calm himself, scrubbing a hand through his hair as he thought. His hand came down and rubbed over his jaw—his stubble was bloody relentless, he had shaved that morning and
for his attention, you even told me once you thought he’d cursed or poisoned you, because looking at him made it difficult to breathe, even after he
“As in, you
“Harry,” Malfoy murmured, shocking him. Had he ever said Harry’s name like that before? “I know you have no reason to trust me. But I won’t ply you with empty words, I won’t grovel at your feet. The only way you’ll know I’m not the same boy I was is if you see it for yourself, but I won’t waste my time if you won’t bother giving me a chance.”
“I love him,” the truth flew out of Draco’s mouth, and he flinched with the abruptness of it, feeling like he’d been slapped. All those years of precious denial, all that work in shoving it away, gone in less than a second. He loved Harry, he’d loved him for way too long, and Pansy had been right, as always. A wash of sweet relief mixed with the painful loss of denial, conflicting him. He wanted to cry, but he wouldn’t.
“Obviously.” Malfoy scowled. “My owls came back unopened, not even my Patronus could find her. I went to the Manor, but the house elves said she’d left the day before for her book club, and hadn’t returned.”
“I said, leave.”
“Harry, are you alright?”
you show no respect for your superiors.”
“For you to do what you wanted to,” Draco clarified, lips twitching in a wry grin. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Afraid to enter the spooky Manor by yourself, then?”
But Draco looked so much softer like this, asleep at the table in the library, on top of his mother’s appointment book. His hair fanned over the dark wood, his arms curled around his head. Harry had never gotten to see something like this, and that was what he was here for, right? To see everything there was to see.
Harry had an expectant look on his face, that was slowly turning puzzled. Draco kept his walls up, and his face emotionless. “We’ve made excellent progress today,” he said. “We’ll start on third year next time. You can start your ending meditation, now.”
by any means, but he was calm and logical and precise, not torture-happy like Bella. Draco had also had much more incentive to learn Occlumency quickly. He’d had a lot to hide in that Manor, among such… company. He wasn’t surprised it didn’t take for Potter the same way.
Nevertheless, he was magically bound to keep patient confidentiality, to do no intentional harm, and to maintain ‘ethical working relationships’ with anyone under his care, which was difficult in his line of work, but not impossible. He wouldn’t die if he broke any of these vows, probably—but he hadn’t tried. The one time one of his patients had developed an inconvenient crush on him, and tried to act on it, the pain had been excruciating.
“Oh! Ohhhh—” Hermione dashed back to her desk, moving around piles of books, “—this changes everything!
The first thing Draco noticed upon returning to consciousness was the smell: the sharp, distinct antiseptic scent of St. Mungo’s.
an Unspeakable who doesn’t ask questions, then I can only imagine that they prefer it that way—perhaps the Department of Mysteries required an Unspeakable whose sole job it was to acquire knowledge, as usual, but without any of that pesky curiosity.”
Harry glanced briefly at the shelves of memories inside the Pensieve cabinet, before making his way to his chair. “Start meditating, I’ll be over in a moment,” Draco said, pulling out his wand to fish the memories out of the Pensieve, placing them carefully back into the glass vial. He brought the Pensieve back to its cabinet, replaced the vial on the shelf, and closed it up, locking it meticulously.
She continued to run her fingers through the tangled curls that had grown down to his shoulders, smoothing out the knots and combing it back away from his face. Harry eventually relaxed under the soothing touch, and wondered if she had done this to Draco’s hair, too.
