The air around him shimmers and weaves as if he is walking through water. If Draco moves his hands it seems to ripple and he can follow the waves until they reach the mother of pearl coloured walls and flow back to him, amplified but immaterial as they pass through him on their return. There is no sound, but the noise of his feet hitting the stairs. Draco knows he should probably be worried, but the warm light fills him with a sense of calm unlike anything he has felt before.
Draco was unable to avert his eyes from the wanton picture he made with Harry still fully clothed behind him, working him open with his hands. Draco was trapped, held by Harry’s gaze in the mirror the entire time as he moved his fingers in and out of Draco’s tight opening.
Time ticked by slowly, its progress recorded by more than a dozen synchronized time pieces at once. The constant noise was beginning to annoy Draco. Why did the man have to ask him to wait here of all places, he could have come back later.
Not wasting another thought on all that had happened today, he thought of where he wanted to go and apparated home.
A slim leather-bound journal lay in the very centre of the drawer. There was a string of leather tied around it in an intricate knot seemingly held together by an ancient quill. Draco poked it with his wand, expecting more traps or bad luck, but the book just lay there. Still slightly wary, Draco pulled his sleeve over his hand and carefully lifted the diary from its hiding place. The moment the diary had been removed, the drawer snapped shut with a bang and Draco was glad he had taken precautions.
Resting his hand on Malfoy’s shoulders and arms again, Harry realised that Malfoy still wasn’t warmer than before and in actual danger of hypothermia. He had tried several warming charms already, but Malfoy’s body hadn’t responded to any of them. There was nothing to it, Harry sighed and slowly took off his jumper and pyjamas leaving him and Malfoy both clad in a pair of Harry’s boxers each.
He startled. There was a voice. Was it real? He didn’t know. Nothing was real. He felt like he was floating away, losing all sense of self, even the feeling of the cold stone slab was gone. Maybe this was what death felt like? If so, he welcomed it, there was nothing left for him, not even himself.
Despite what he now remembered, he didn’t know what to make of it. He didn’t know whether to be happy at Harry’s declaration of love or sad because he had chosen to remove that very thing from his memory. He was brought out of his reverie when the message still in the bottle slowly slid out of its tight neck and unscrolled itself on the desk in front of him. It was a letter addressed to him by Harry. The parchment felt brittle and strange under his fingers, which was probably due to the insane amount of wards and safeguards charmed to the paper. Draco got the distinct impression that he would be the only one beside Harry to ever be able to read what it said.
Making sure of his appearance in the hallway mirror, Draco grabbed his keys and his bag, lowered the wards and made his way out of the door.
“I always figured some kind of potions accident, you know, like when you and Hermione used to brew potions in the second floor girls’ bathroom? Only he was working on something new all the time, we all thought he was out there experimenting or something, that is when he wasn’t out there shagging his boyfriend silly.” She smirks at him and Harry blushes, remembering all too well how the shagging part had never been a problem between the two of them.
He was watching the tumult through a dusty shop window. A couple of Aurors were questioning the assembled crowd as to what the ruckus was all about. Everyone seemed to be saying that they had just crowded around to see what all the fuss had been about and behind those people the reporters were scanning the crowd, probably to try and find out where he had disappeared to.
“I’m hiding from the insanity out there,” he said, gesturing at the people trying to force their way inside without success. Their shouts were muffled through the glass. “Do you happen to know what that was all about? I know people have been talking about retaliation against Death Eaters being on the rise, but that out there is ridiculous. Why they’d bother you of all people about it is completely beyond me.”
Potter pressed the handle of his umbrella into Draco’s hand, squeezing it once, the gentle touch lingering slightly longer than would have been normal.
Harry rushed forward pulling him inside and pressed his wand against Draco’s throat, before slamming his back into the closed front door.
“Good evening, Ginevra!” Draco said although it turned out to be rather pointless as she had insinuated herself between himself and Potter. She was effectively ignoring Draco and drawing Potter into a passionate kiss, as if needing to stake her claim on him.
The band that had set up earlier had just begun to play and the volume was such that Malfoy had to lean in to try and make himself understood. Harry still didn’t hear a word of what he said, too busy shivering and cataloguing how every single feather-light touch and every puff of breath against his skin made him feel.
“Harry, come on, you can’t keep saying you’re busy, I know the children and Ginny are at Hogwarts and as far as you know you don’t have anyone waiting for you at home.” Ron implores.
After they had finished the tea and Harry had managed not to spill most of it, Malfoy helped him up to his bedroom. Harry was curled up under the duvet, still wearing his regular clothes, but too exhausted to change and not close enough to Malfoy to ask him for help.
When Draco, after having received his verdict finally left the courtroom through a side exit, Harry welcomed him with an open and happy smile, holding out his hand for him to shake. There hadn’t been many chances to talk after the fiendfyre incident with everything that had to be sorted out. Additionally, when it became clear that Harry would speak at Draco’s trial, any sort of contact had been strictly prohibited.
Suddenly Draco finds himself standing in the middle of a river on a large flat stone. The sunlight is bright and warm on his skin and he has to blink against the bright sparkling light reflected on the water all around him. He sets the bucket filled with clear river water down between his feet and brushes across his brow wearily. The forest around him is lush green and a small rainbow spans the water where the sunlight hits it and the waterfall becomes a river again. Dragonflies hover and flit over the water’s surface like tiny fairies and Draco swears he can hear them laugh as they breeze by him.
The park was cold and dark and he was early. Harry began to pace to try and keep himself warm and to get rid of the agitation that was starting to cloud his judgement. Why had he kissed Draco, who so obviously had wanted to remove all reminders of them together from his life? The answer was as simple as it was disturbing: because it had made him feel better than he had felt in weeks, because seeing Draco every day but not being able to touch him was a poor substitute for having Draco safely wrapped in his arms. Even having an unresponsive Draco close to him had felt better than this forced restraint. At least there’d been recognition in his eyes. Harry was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he almost didn’t notice when Draco arrived.
That’s how Harry finds himself on Luna’s doorstep a month after their original encounter in his living room.
Draco, finally giving in to what he’d wanted to do ever since Harry had caressed the palm of his hand, had tilted Harry’s chin up with his free hand while the other man’s were still clutching his shoulder and his robes because his legs refused to keep him upright and kissed him. The kiss was sloppy and slightly uncoordinated but it was a kiss nonetheless. Harry had tasted like butterbeer and this distinct flavour had mixed with the one of firewhiskey in Draco’s mouth before too long.
“Sorry, what?” Draco swallowed again, noticing that he was leaning back into Potter’s warmth. Merlin’s beard, he hadn’t heard a word that Potter had said. A dark warm chuckle and more warm breath against his ear were the only response.
“Draco! Dear Merlin, you're awake, you are actually awake!” Draco was crushed into what must have been a mattress by something whoever was doing the crushing apparently considered a hug. Finally letting him go, when he started coughing and choking, but still clutching his hand, whoever was with him, continued.
“Get out now,” Draco repeated, advancing on the still cowering Harry with his wand drawn. Harry scrambled towards the door, feeling for the handle behind his back. He seemed genuinely scared.
“Look who’s talking! You’re not even making an effort to stay in focus anymore, how can I be more ine-… ine-… drunk than you? And don’t call me Potter,” he added, almost as an afterthought.
“That’s not… that can’t be true,” Draco said. “I’ve been reading about his life, reading about the man he met and that got him shunned by his family, when they found out about it. He was just a wonderful human being—“ Draco fell silent.
He knew something was up as soon as he unlocked the door of Number Twelve Grimmauld Place and stepped inside. Ginny’s coat was on the coat rack beside the door and he could see sickly yellow light seeping through the uneven crack between the kitchen door and the hallway floor. Harry sighed as he took off his coat put it on the coat rack beside Ginny’s and hid the cloak in his bag. This was going to be yet another unpleasant evening.
The creature wraps itself around Draco’s body, slowly becoming human in its form and Draco recognises his black knight in it. The man presses his forehead against Draco’s.
At first Harry had thought he followed him to make sure that Draco wouldn’t harm himself, now he knew better. He simply wanted to see the blond. At dusk in the park, Harry would gaze at Draco from underneath his cloak, watch the troubled expression on his face and long to reach out to touch him and tell him that things would be okay someday soon, to have more patience and hope.
Pansy hummed, looking at the notes the quill had taken and then prodded the area where Draco’s eyebrows should have been.
Harry flushed and looked at the floor, before he straightened up, clearly the brave Gryffindor, facing problems head on. He crouched down until he was on eyelevel with Draco and took both his hands.
The shout startled them both. And Harry barely avoided whacking Draco in the face with the back of his head as they both flailed about trying to figure out what was going on.
“Draco! Merlin no! Please no! What have you done?” Harry yelled, his pain and panic evident, dragging Draco’s lifeless form to the floor cradling him to his chest as tears streamed down his face.
“Get your filthy hands off me,” he snarled and tried to push Harry out of his bed. The images of the Harry from his dreams were somehow merging with images of the night at a pub where Harry’s hands ran all over him. Draco remembered Harry’s hands in his hair, he remembered the desperate kiss from the night before and still all he could feel right now was complete and utter revulsion.
There are two faint popping noises and Harry deducts that he’s alone again. Moving still isn’t an option, the headache much too severe and the armchair way too comfortable. While Harry attempts to become one with this beautiful, beautiful piece of furniture, he waits for the inevitable screaming to begin.
The wizarding world was definitely fickle in its attention, and Harry’s liaison with Draco seemed almost forgotten.
Potter’s smile widened into a grin. “Which is why I usually rely on the Muggle alternative of actually bringing an umbrella with me. I don’t have a patient right now, if you’d like, we could get started early.”
“Bloody Hell!” Draco exclaimed as the simple innocent gilded frame turned into an utterly disfiguring monstrosity when he beheld his reflection. “Over my dead body!”
Draco carefully untied the ribbon from around her leg and petted her. Sophia’s sharp talons cut into the thick leather of the chair so she wouldn’t lose her balance, while she pressed her head against the palm of his hand and made him scratch her feathers.
“I wanted to let you know that I’m back from London and that I’ve decided it’s time for you to get dressed and join me for tea.”
“I don’t know,” Harry turned his head this way and that, looking at the carving on the face of the stone. The different angles made the image seem almost alive, as if the spirals and swirls were actually moving. “It almost looks like a vortex of some kind.”
“Where am I?” His voice sounded raw and scratchy as if he hadn’t spoken in weeks. Then again, maybe he hadn’t, who knew how much time he’d spent in limbo.
“I don’t think so. I don’t want you on my property, let alone inside my house. So, say your piece and leave.”
Despair made Harry brave, he grabbed the proffered arm and held onto it tightly. His fingers traced the skin from Draco’s palm to his elbow as he looked at Draco steadily.
Draco rushes to the window, to look outside and make sure there are no footprints in front of the window. It had all felt so real last night. They have to be there. The pristine blanket of snow outside mocks him and crushes the last of his hope. Everything seems bleak even the snow flakes drifting down from the sky are nothing but tiny shrouds to cover up the last shreds of his heart.
Harry looked slightly dumbstruck but then managed to get the noodles on his fork at the second attempt. He looked so delighted with his success that Draco had to hide his smile behind his napkin as he pretended to wipe some beetroot juice from his lips.
Sudden fear punched through him. Harry couldn't breathe. Something else had happened, something terrible, something he couldn’t remember, all he knew was that he had to get away. Harry was half out of his armchair, when his therapist’s words finally managed to penetrate the fog of panic.
“Absolutely, don’t worry about it. I’ll take care of it myself.” Percy promises. That is the first thing Harry finds even remotely calming on this upsetting day.
Draco was asked to sit down in front of a weird contraption before Potter darkened the room with a spell, explaining that a diluted pupil was necessary for the tests. After measuring Draco’s intraocular pressure, taking pictures of his retinas and doing some other things to his eyes that seemed distinctly Muggle, Potter announced the next one to be the last test. Draco was asked to sit on a stool in front of the only white wall that didn’t sport a poster on some ocular health-related subject or other (his favourite being: “Tired of the old wooden prosthesis? Try the new magical revolving eyeball, now with wide angle and improved macro function!”).
It was dark when Draco finally reached the last page. So, Harry had been ashamed and confused. He’d thought that Draco hadn’t wanted him and felt guilty over forcing himself on him. Just as the magnitude of the misunderstanding still separating them began sinking in, a pale glass bottle two-thirds filled with sand appeared beside the diary with a small pop. Draco picked it up and shook it gently thus revealing that there was a rolled up piece of parchment buried in the sand. He tried summoning it to no avail. Checking the bottle for curses out of sheer habit, Draco picked it up and pulled the stopper. Sand immediately began spilling over his fingers.
The next time Harry awoke, he tried to tap into his magic again to summon anything, maybe just a small spot of light so he could see and not just imagine what was holding him prisoner. But just when he thought he had enough, he could feel his magic snuff out like a candle in a storm.
Not being able to press the heel of his hand against his crotch was akin to torture; his voice shook as he continued to read out the letters to a calm and collected Potter who didn’t even seem to notice Draco’s distress. When he finally thought he couldn’t take anymore, it was over. Feeling the heat radiate off his face, Draco realised that his entire body was trembling.
He turned and walked out, closing the door quietly behind him. Harry took a sip of his coffee and made a grimace, when he realised that his coffee was just as cold as Malfoy’s. He went to the kitchen to pour the vile liquid down the drain. If this was any indication on how his day would proceed, Harry didn’t want to know what else was going to happen.
Draco is terrified as water he can’t even see keeps jostling him around and pulling him under, trying to force its way into his lungs. He tries to grab for the black knight to find something, anything to hold on to as they are swept away. Just for a moment their fingers touch.
His mood had reached a new low when the stack of memos on his desk glowed briefly, revealing a short unsigned message written in a neat script that made his heart hammer in his chest.
Suddenly Draco froze and looked up at him expectantly, he must have made a noise he thought. When Harry didn’t speak, Draco politely inquired how he could be of assistance, stressing Harry’s rank and title.
Draco moans in delight when Harry finally enters him, canting his hips up to take him in deeper. Harry is making him his, claiming his body and soul. Draco rejoices in Harry’s possession of his body, his heart has belonged to the man too long to even be considered Draco’s own anymore. Every time Harry has turned away from him in a Hogwarts corridor, every time he refused to meet his eye or talk to him melts away as they connect, creating something beautiful. However fleeting this moment makes Draco feel like part of something whole, something special and with that thought in mind he can feel himself coming completely undone.
And they are back on known terrain. Harry finds himself almost picking up the fight. But he’s so tired, tired of everything, of fighting, of having to live up to expectations, of loneliness.
Making coffee didn’t really need much thought, his hands knew what they were doing and it gave Harry time to think about what to do. He usually just charged into things, much like last night when he had quit his job or even earlier when he had gone for Malfoy’s flirtatious behaviour. Malfoy didn’t seem to remember anything, which asked for delicacy on Harry’s part. He couldn’t very well accuse Malfoy of molesting him while in a drug induced haze he didn’t even remember. Harry immediately felt a pang of guilt as he remembered how he had taken advantage of Malfoy. The fact that Malfoy had slept on the floor with Harry and had been completely nude did make Harry look like the guilty party.
It was at the exact moment when Harry shifted restlessly, needing more but not quite knowing how to ask for it, that Draco hit his prostate. Harry arched his body, throwing his head back and moaning in pleasure. Draco angled all his thrusts at that brilliant spot inside of him, Harry turning into a quivering mess. As much as he hated the want inside of him, it made him feel alive, Draco made him feel whole and safe and… and he hit the spot again, making light explode in front of Harry’s eyes.
Harry followed Draco home every day worried the man would break the promise he’d made, it hadn’t been an unbreakable vow after all. When the anniversary finally came around, Harry knew something was wrong the minute Draco didn’t show up at the park. He’d taken to carrying his invisibility cloak with him at all times in case he’d have to quickly disappear from sight but still stick around unseen.
“I was trying to keep you safe, you stupid prick. What do you think I was doing? I was trying fucking everything to make sure you wouldn’t come to any harm. I haven’t slept a full night in months, so tell me again that I was pretending.”
“He… I am just so lost without him Pansy! I don’t know what to do with myself. I need him and he won’t even speak to me!”
“Does what we have, what we feel mean so little to you that you can simply abandon it? Do I mean that little to you? Don’t throw this away Harry. I need you, and I know that you need me too. Just tell me what’s wrong. I need to know!” Oh God, what had he done. He’d broken Draco Malfoy. The man believed himself to have feelings for him. This couldn’t be happening. Harry needed to get out of this conversation and fast. He needed to hide from the guilt.
“On the topic of awkward, Potter. Do you suppose we could go and find my clothes before long? As comfortable as your bathrobe is, I’d rather not go home wearing only that.”
Potter came to a halt just before rounding the corner and he stumbled back to where Draco was standing.
“You did have the right to make those demands on me Harry. With everything I’ve shown you, everything that I indicated through my behaviour, you knew you had the right to do this, which is why you did it.”
Harry does reach for Draco then, reaches for the hand on his chest and moves it up, pressing his cheek into it. He tries to hold Draco’s gaze but still can’t quite seem to catch it, the blazing sun turning Draco’s pale hair into a halo.
Draco’s took a firm hold of Harry’s erection and started pulling him off in time with his thrusts. Harry could feel his orgasm approaching. It started in the balls of his feet and rushed through him like lightening, his muscles tightened and warmth pooled in his belly before his release burst out of him, coating his abdomen in thick strings of pearly white liquid.
on the square and they all join each other hanging over the space like a giant rainbow coloured upside down bubble bath. The fish pokes Draco in the ribs and it actually hurts.
“No, you must leave now.” The house elf agitatedly tried to push Harry back into the flames, completely missing that his cloak and hair almost caught fire.
Harry took a step back as if he regretted his sudden outburst. His voice was quiet but firm when he spoke again.
“Have you been following me? Is this some misguided attempt to get a story out of me for your best friend Ms Skeeter?”
“Thank you Poxy, I understand.” Harry said. He could hear the house-elf whispering to herself. “Sorry, did you say something?”
Harry padded into the bathroom, drained another glass of tab water and then returned, handing Malfoy his bathrobe.
“There’s a lot you don’t know about me oh cunning Slytherin, but if you are very nice to me, I intend to let you find out.” His voice sounded sultry and promising, letting a shiver run down Draco’s spine. Not that he’d been able to resist the man in front of him before, or even been willing to, but that voice just made him want to drag him into his bed, devour him and being devoured in return.
Draco thought. Unwilling to speak and afraid he’d reveal too much if he did, he let himself sink back into sleep
In his mind Draco had always imagined Harry coming back to him, a sad look on his face, begging Draco to take him back. Draco would spread his arms and Harry would run into them, right back where he belonged.
It wasn’t even that his hair had fallen out, it had just gone, which was somehow even more unnerving. If he had at least had to brush it off the floor it might have made more sense. And don’t get him started on Harry’s fondness for teaching Draco to do things “the Muggle way”. Who the fuck even came up with “Muggle Mondays” and used that shit unironically? Harry Potter apparently and for some reason Draco didn’t have the heart to tell him ‘no’. Draco not saying no to the things he hated, like hand-washing dishes, like spending time with Harry’s friends – some of whom still resented him for besmirching their immaculate saviour – and moments like these, when wearing a scratchy, vomit-coloured, hand-knitted hat that smelled funny, were still better than telling Harry “no”.
It takes Luna coming over to conduct a proper interview that is published in a special edition of the Quibbler the same day and makes the niche magazine reach a record-breaking run, for Draco to forgive him.
The change of surroundings was quite sudden. He was back in the armchair, his therapist at his side, her wand still attached to his forehead.
“I believe you were leaving.” Draco says indicating the way they came in, a house elf is standing there, ready to take Harry back to the gate.
The only thing for Harry to do seems to be to drag Draco against his chest and sling his arms around his torso, holding on like a vice, while Draco begins to sob in desperation. Once Draco has stopped fighting him, Harry begins to stroke along his arms and presses his own cheek against Draco.
“I was just wondering, because absolutely everything is covered in elderflowers, I think the wind must have carried them in here while we were sleeping.”
“Your hands are pretty and your arms are pretty too and you are…” Draco could almost see Harry mentally kicking himself and cutting his stream of words off by pure force of will.
“Oh rubbish, Potter! You and your ego simply enjoy when I have to come and apologise, that’s why you always choose to meet at such inopportune times and then keep meeting time and place a secret.”
Harry pressed his forehead into Draco’s, his eyes closed and his hands cradling Draco’s face, the wand pressing uncomfortably into their skin.
They say their goodbyes and while they’ve shared something very personal they are not friends, not even on the way to becoming acquaintances, but somehow that’s ok too. Before she leaves, Millicent tells him that if he ever needs to over share his feelings with someone who won’t judge him, he knows where to find her.
“Sweet Merlin!” Harry gasped. So that’s what it felt like. He’d heard about what it was like to have one’s prostate stimulated, had done it to Draco dozens of times, but never experienced it himself. Lightening bolts of pleasure ran from the tiny nub through his entire body, making him arch his back involuntarily as Draco touched it again and for a moment Harry thought he would come.
“…why’d we have to take another one of those Harry? I don’t see why it’s our job to rehabilitate scum like him.”
treasure, would he actually come across any of the houses or had they all been swallowed up or replaced by the ever-growing Muggle London?
There was a disgusting sort of taste in his mouth. If he had to describe it, Draco would have gone for “furry”. He licked his lips and swallowed convulsively trying to get rid of it. Someone was poking his chest, but it was too dark to see who or what it was.
On and on it went, frame after frame, none of them entirely meeting with his approval except for one, but Potter’s reaction of “Oh Hell no! You look like a bloody hipster in those!” was veto enough for Draco to discard those as well. Potter levitated more and more frames over, some of them outrageously hideous, but Draco tried them all anyway to indulge the man. Some of them made the two of them laugh so hard that they threatened to fall off their chairs. He couldn’t have said when it started but after a while Potter began putting the frames on Draco’s face, carefully making sure the earpieces fit smoothly and didn’t hurt him. With every frame Potter’s touches lingered longer and longer and it was all Draco could do but to lean into them.  Both men grew more and more quiet, their shared laughter and conversation becoming sparse.
Draco was as stiff as a board, before he buried his face against Harry’s shoulder and melted against his chest and let his arms sneak around Harry’s waist. Overcome with affection, Harry pressed a quick kiss to the crown of Draco’s hair, who hugged him even tighter.
Draco held tight to Harry's waist from where he was sitting right behind him on the broom, pressing his cold face into the warmth of his back, while holding down the...beanie with his other hand. Draco couldn’t even think it without shuddering. Harry hopefully thought it was due to the cold and not the truth.
Harry woke with a start, the afterimage of the figure bending over his bed still clear in front of his eyes. He scrambled backwards till his back hit the headboard, desperately trying to find a source of light to drive the fear away. When he found it, his wand felt warm and reassuring in his hand. Harry gently lit it up, carefully looking around the room. He was alone.
Draco found himself in front of a reception desk. A dark-haired middle-aged witch smiled at him making Draco want to scowl even more. Completely oblivious to the temper brewing under the as of yet calm surface of one Draco Malfoy, the receptionist reached for the calendar in front of her and began cheerfully rattling off a series of questions that everyone who’s ever been to a physician anywhere would be nauseatingly familiar with. Had he ever been here before? Was he allergic to anything? Was he insured? Would he please fill in this form? And last but not least the all-time favourite, whether he’d please take a seat in the waiting room, somebody would be over to fetch him momentarily.
Pressing his cheek into Harry’s, Draco held him close, not wanting to let go for the world, but the moment had to come to an end. Harry took a step back and took Draco’s hands in his.
“It was altruistic intent. I wanted so badly for you to be ok that it didn’t matter if what I did would bring you back to me. The only thing that mattered was that you were ok, whether with or without my presence in your life. That’s when I realised that I love you, unconditionally and that I don’t need you to love me back, I just need to love you and that’s enough.”
“Alright, what do you say we start afresh you and me? Clean slate and all that? Let’s see how it turns out this time.” Potter stretched out his right hand.
Preparing dinner was a lonely affair and Harry wished he knew where Draco was right now. With his memories, his feelings had returned and not having Draco around caused an almost physical ache in his chest. Harry realised that he didn’t even know where Draco’s office in London was located, let alone where he lived.
“How is it possible that this house is the only one left standing? Every other building for miles has been reduced to a mount of rubble and ash, yet this shop seems almost entirely unaffected.”
Harry had taken him out to lunch and then let himself be dragged through a dozen furniture shops, Muggle as well as wizarding ones. The furniture had been delivered later that day and seeing Harry working up a sweat while getting rid of the old furniture and replacing it with the new definitely had its merits. Draco liked to remember how Harry had prowled towards him, when he’d noticed Draco’s interest. He’d pressed him down on the freshly uncovered sofa and had, as they would both later call it, his wicked way with him.
“Sophia,” Harry called after he had got up and the bird settled onto his shoulder. “I’ll make sure to send her by with more fresh mice so you get well soon.”
Satisfied with his toast, he raised the phial once more and then downed its entire contents in one smooth gulp.
“Fuck!” Draco yelled after the knife slipped, its blade biting into his thumb. He threw the dagger clear across the room and could hear it clatter into some dark corner. “Shit!” he hissed and stuck the finger into his mouth.
“Now this might actually hurt. I’ve never had to cancel a curse that has been attached to a person for such a long time. While I really want you to tell me, if what I’m doing is hurting you, I’ll probably only be able to stop at certain intervals.”
“Almost finished with the first strand,” Harry promises. Draco clenches his teeth in response, before finding Harry’s gaze. His expression is clear, despite the scars and the pain displayed there. “Scared, Potter?!” it seems to say. Harry knows they both are but that has never stopped either of them.
“Tell Mother I’ll be right down,” he said instead of apologising and Holly appeared glad to be dismissed.
Another step and the person is now close enough to touch. Draco still doesn’t turn around, but he can feel their breath on his neck. He wants to scream, but suddenly finds himself paralysed. If he closes his eyes and wishes away the dark presence at his back then maybe, just maybe he can wake up.
It’s at least another five minutes before Luna strolls in, dressed in a long woollen jumper that reaches down to her knees and a pair of comfortable looking, curled stockings. With nowhere to sit, she perches on the armrest of the chair Millicent occupies. She smiles at him encouragingly and suddenly Harry can find his words again. It feels strange not to address the wholly unexpected matter of the third person in the room.
Weasley’s grin grew so wide the top of his head was in danger of toppling off, as he held out an old toothbrush to Draco.
“Well, finally. What took you so long?” Malfoy broke off, giving him a once over. “You look like shit, Potter. What happened?”
“You talk to Ron every day.” Harry pointed out, two could play this game. He only wished she would come out with it, so they could get the inevitable row over with, destroy some more of Mrs. Black’s incredibly expensive china in the process and then hopefully reconcile enough for him to kiss Ginny goodbye and finally get some sleep. After all, he had to get up extra early again tomorrow to make sure Draco and that dangerous phial of his got to work okay.
They alight on the chaise lounge, a hand width’s distance between them, that feels like a vast ravine and Harry has no idea how words are supposed to bridge it. Draco is the one who is brave enough to speak first. He tells Harry of his time at Hogwarts while Voldemort was staying at his house, tells him how hard it had been to accept that Harry would hurt him the way he did, the scars a constant reminder and the fixed glamour he began to wear now a part of his very being. He talks about being lonely and how a loveless marriage hadn’t changed his feeling of constant alienation.
It wasn’t so much that Harry feared what might come of those feelings, or that he feared rejection; it was that he didn’t know what to do with them. He hadn’t expected to like Draco Malfoy, let alone to be attracted to him.
A cold gust of wind pelting his face with raindrops and small bits of ice finally roused Harry enough to turn around and make his way back to the lighthouse. He was frustrated. What was Malfoy, of all people, doing here? The one time Harry actually wanted to spend some time alone, one of the people he had least wanted to run into had to stay at the same place. How big were the chances? Malfoy must definitely be up to something, maybe he was vetting the area for one of those neo Death Eater groups Harry had read about in
“Look Draco, I think I found another one!” Harry shouted from behind an unidentified shrubbery. Mrs. Black it would appear had had quite the extensive rose garden, before she died. Without anyone to care for it, nature had reclaimed the meticulously neat flowerbeds and turned the garden into a jungle.
“I’m not sure that’s even possible. If what you say is true, it’s probably protected against anything we can come up with.”
He tried to get up again and the pain, even though expected, made him pause for a moment. Draco couldn’t breathe, something aside from Sophia was on his chest and constricting his lungs. Bright spots began to dance in front of his eyes as the thing shifted, making breathing even more difficult. Draco shuffled around under what could only be a heavy beam. It eventually came loose and tumbled to the side.
He started to reach for his prick, but Draco slapped his hand away. There was a strange glint in his eyes that scared Harry for a moment, but then Draco was kissing him, tracing the seam of his lips with his tongue and then demanding entrance. Harry could only moan helplessly as his mouth was plundered. Draco was taking charge and he was able to let himself go just a little bit more. Even though he was familiar with most of the steps he had someone to guide him through this uncharted territory, someone who wouldn’t hurt him.
Never letting go of Draco’s neck, Harry slung his long legs around Draco’s hip, crossing his ankles behind his back.
“Hands off, Boy Wonder! It’s mine and you cannot have it unless you are in this bed and recovering!”
“I think we forgot something.” He said, “Your glasses are all clouded with condensation. Here, let me help you.” Draco suddenly realised that his eyes were almost crossed with the effort of making out the wand that was pointed directly at his face. He didn’t flinch, his subconscious apparently deciding to give Harry the benefit of the doubt. Draco was rewarded with another quick kiss after the other man had cast an
When he saw who was heading towards them, he almost wished that he had refused the beanie. It was the last person he wanted to see him like this. Lying skank, she had told him she’d had a hot date tonight and here she was descending on him and his poor head like a luminescent vulture. Draco could almost physically feel the moment she noticed “it”. Draco tried to hide behind Harry and in his opinion nobody could hold that against him.
“Don’t think you are getting out of this that easily!” Draco said his breath hitching as Harry’s hand stroked up and down his arms soothingly. His eyelids fluttered shut as the sensation of Harry’s fingernails raking along his arms overwhelmed him.
“It wasn’t like that. I wasn’t pretending…” Harry sat down again, rubbing his hands across his face and then staring at the floor. “I wasn’t pretending,” he repeated.
“Malfoy! I was right then, it was your watch!” The man said jovially. He cleaned his hands on an already dirty piece of cloth and advanced on Draco hand outstretched in greeting. Draco could not believe his eyes.
“I think we did it,” Draco said, his voice still hoarse from the earlier screaming as he looked outside. The storm had simply disappeared as if by magic and now the warm rays of the evening sun as it was just about to set fell in through the window, lighting his room with its warm golden glow.
Draco brought up the planet in front of them. Earth was easily recognisable now with its continents and large oceans.
She told Harry that she’d spoken to a few of her colleagues who would be willing to work with him, if he wanted, but Harry refused. He did want to talk to someone about everything that was going on inside him, but he wanted it to be someone he could trust unconditionally. With Ginny’s departure the number of people he trusted had shrunk to two – and even Ginny had not been allowed to see certain sides of him.
That night, Harry lies in bed, the image of Malfoy, his head bent, the very picture of defeat burnt into his mind. Dudley had taken him aside when their children were saying their goodbyes and had asked about what had happened with Malfoy to have Harry react like that. Harry had simply said that he knew Malfoy from school and tried to change the subject, which was when Dudley had insisted on saying his piece.
“Harry, calm down, it’s not the end of the world. You always said Slytherins aren’t evil and that they should be accepted for who they are.”
Harry raised his hand, requesting silence before anyone else could speak. He pinched the bridge of his nose and then pushed his glasses back up.
“She might not be able to, but I certainly can,” Millicent says with conviction. This is followed by a short and quiet discussion between her and Luna that ends with Luna looking pissed and Millicent smiling indulgently behind her back.
He’d stood in front of the mirror for the last hour, choosing and discarding more than a dozen outfits and getting increasingly frustrated with his inability to decide on any one set of robes. Finally he decided on a set of dark robes with a silver and green trim that would go well with Harry’s eyes and that were loose around his crotch, in case he had another inappropriate reaction and needed to hide it. He refused to admit to himself that he was both hoping for and dreading said reaction.
Draco was stuck. Pulling didn’t seem to get him anywhere, though. Neither did pushing and squirming only caused his skin to chafe. Draco stopped struggling for the moment and tried to come up with a plan on how to extricate himself from the wall’s clutches. If he could only get his wand, he might be able to free himself. He stretched and tugged again, hearing the sound of tearing fabric but seemed to be stuck more firmly than ever.
Sometimes he wondered why there was even a need for an assistant librarian, it wasn’t as if anyone ever came down here to inquire after building plans or asking to look at an original blueprint. Not even Granger had been here once. Considering how her kind actually hatched in the dusty stacks of libraries and would probably wither in the light of day, it went to show just how dead his work place actually was. Most days he didn’t expect to see another human being, while he sat behind his desk, cataloguing dusty and faded blueprints of long forgotten wizarding buildings that probably didn’t even exist anymore. On rare occasions he wondered what would happen if he took the time to compare a map of current London with the blueprints stored in the library. Should he decide to take a walk through the city, looking for
They stood there for what seemed like forever, wrapped around each other, covered in sweat and panting, while their hearts still raced. Draco thought his legs would buckle under him, unable to carry both his and Harry’s weight after such a mind-blowing orgasm. Harry must have felt him tremble, because he righted himself, pulling Draco up with him and gently turning him around in his embrace. Finally looking up at his lover and seeing his face not only in reflection, he was surprised despite what had just occurred to find a feeling of devotion as intense as his own mirrored there. Harry pulled him closer and placed gentle lingering kisses all over his face and lips, before stepping back.
There must be something, some clue as to what happened to Pyxis hidden in this room somewhere. Draco got up, careful not to step on the broken glass. He placed the picture reverently on the desk and went to inspect the book cases. He carefully brushed along the backs of the old tomes, most of them books on navigation and astronomy. Which would explain why this room was up in the observatory. None of them managed to shed light on Pyxis’ fate. Some of them had notes scribbled in the margins, which seemed to be written in some kind of code. Draco snapped the book he was currently holding shut and surveyed the entire collection in front of him and realised that there was a lot of work for him, right here, in his immediate future.
The weather had been mild and beautiful for days, and Harry would have loved to spend yet another evening at the Burrow with Ginny and his family. If it hadn’t been for the ministry event that evening that’s where he would be right now, sitting on a blanket in the garden, listening to the wind in the fields around them and watching the bats chase insects through the slowly darkening sky. He would caress Ginny’s hair while her head lay in his lap, whispering sweet nothings, while she pointed out their favourite made up constellations.
“This is isn’t a good time. I am having friends over. If there’s nothing else.” Harry tried to close the door. He could do this. He could shut out what he had done to Draco and move on. Harry realised that Malfoy wouldn’t let him get away that easily.
“Hm?” Harry turned around in the semi dark room and looked up at Malfoy who was leaning on his elbows and looking down at him with a less than attractive sneer.
“Luna, what the hell are you even talking about? Nothing happened to him, he didn’t even get punished for what he did during the war. He got to keep everything, his reputation, his money, his family. Everything! He’s never been alone like I have.”
“You mentioned I should look into the report, only when I got access to the case file there was nothing in it. It’s also the only report of a crime involving Death Eaters-.”
“No, we did that months ago. We haven’t finished going through all the storage spaces, there just never seems to be enough time, but we haven’t really done anything with them lately and as far as I know, neither has Harry or Dobby.”
Draco shuddered at the expression on her face. “Pansy, you’re right. I do not need to know more about your vagina.”
None of Pansy’s tests brought any results. Draco hadn’t been cursed by an object and while he had been affected by magic, nobody seemed to be able to pinpoint what kind of magic exactly was responsible. It could have been Cornish Pixies for all he knew. Even Hermione seemed stumped and it annoyed her more than it did him.
Eventually Harry falls asleep, the empty tumbler dropping from his unfeeling fingers, the fire having died down some time ago.
“We’ve got to go, Draco,” he shouts and grabs Draco’s hand, dragging him towards one of the windows. It hurts as they jump through it. Outside it is dark, completely opposite of what the inside of the room would have made Draco believe. The sheer drop seems to take forever and Draco begins to thrash around in terror, while the knight tries to keep his hold on him. Ligeia is still coming after them. Her arms have turned into wings and her body into that of a bird. She dives after them and Draco knows they are not going to make it.
“Why do you want to know?” Draco had almost given up on an answer to his question by the time Harry finally spoke.
“Open your eyes! I want you to see what a pretty picture you make, shaking with need, waiting for what I am going to do to you next.” Harry’s low commanding voice let shivers run up and down his spine and unable to disobey, he opened his eyes, taking in his appearance. His hair was a complete mess, his pupils were blown wide with lust and his lips were puffy and wet with their shared saliva. His tongue darted out to taste it once more, causing Harry to moan at the sight.
What Draco now knew to be fragments of memories kept assaulting him. Memories of Harry touching him, loving him, talking to him, needing him. His favourite memories were the ones of them waking up together, of the tenderness in Harry’s eyes whenever he looked at him, of how desperately overwhelming Harry’s need to touch him was and how much he enjoyed being touched by Harry.
Draco had to put the diary away. There was so much pain in Pyxis words and not for the first time Draco realised that he should be glad to live in the times that he did. He had envied Pyxis his seemingly happy and carefree life at first. But seeing how restricted his life had become and how much Pyxis suffered under his father’s rule which sacrificed his sons happiness, Draco began to pity him. Draco could identify with Pyxis, seeking his father’s approval while somehow trying to stay his own person. Pyxis had been braver than Draco and hadn’t allowed his family’s doctrines to pollute his mind.
Potter’s breathing changed almost imperceptibly and his strong arms tightened around Draco, apparently he hadn’t been careful enough.
The more he remembered the more an overwhelming sense of loss and betrayal began overshadowing the happy memories.
Draco tears his hand out of Harry’s grip and when Harry looks at him again, whatever he thought he had seen is gone. The skin he can make out in the dim light that filters through the curtains is as pristine as ever and without touch, there is no way for him to tell.
Above him the sky has turned black and the light from the fountain reflects in the thousands of hovering spheres that clink and ring, making them look like stars. The rider leans down off the horse and reaches for Draco. If he didn’t know better Draco could have sworn the rider was offering him his hand. There is no time to think about this as suddenly all the spheres above him drop to the floor, shattering into thousands of sharp pieces, showering him in shards that bite into his skin and make him stumble backwards. The noise is so intense that even covering his ears isn’t helping.
Draco only nodded, obviously unable to speak. He reached over and grabbed one of  his pillows, helping Harry to lift his pelvis even higher and placing it under him. Harry assumed that it was to ease penetration and suddenly felt overwhelmed by a weird mixture of guilt and gratitude that Draco was taking such care of him.
"Don't worry, we're almost there," Harry shouted from the front and Draco squeezed him in thanks. And that right there was why Draco couldn’t say no. Harry cared and was willing to put up with almost anything from and for the people he loved and inspired the same in them. While Ron and Draco would probably never be friends, both of them always put in an effort to at least politely discuss the weather and if they couldn’t agree on that, Molly’s fabulous cooking was usually the safest topic that they could agree on. All the same, Draco was glad that it had been Hermione and not Ron who had been witness to his plight. The mocking he would receive otherwise would commence soon enough and considering Ron’s incredible stamina for such things would probably be regaled every family Christmas until Draco’s hair disappeared due to natural reasons. He wasn’t really looking forward to it. Better to keep a low profile, if necessary, forever.
Much later they watched the sun rise together, the conversation having sobered them both up. After all they had shared in the safety of the night neither could seem to find the right words afterwards when it became time to leave and go back to what passed for reality.
Draco’s potions supplies were running low and with things as they stood, he would have to go to London himself to replenish them. Fortunately going to Diagon Alley had become a much less dreadful notion than it had been only months earlier. He considered asking Pansy to come along but when he was faced with having to call her, he realised he didn’t much feel like having company on his first foray into London since the Prophet article.
Ginny was due to arrive at Grimmauld Place any day now. She’d completed her training and was currently taking some well deserved time off with one of her team mates. Things would go back to normal soon, he was sure of it. Once Ginny moved back in with him, he would get over his infatuation and live the life he was meant to. He would set Draco free, no matter how much it hurt him. It was better for them both.
He slumped back in the comfortable chair and stared at the high ceiling above him. Harry had run out of ideas. At this point he was only glad that Mrs. Malfoy had chosen to search Draco’s room herself and not asked Harry to do it. He felt guilty enough about going behind Draco’s back all the time as it was, without adding invasion of privacy to the list of things he berated himself about. Mrs. Malfoy had claimed that she had found nothing out of the ordinary except for an old conch shell that Draco seemed to have acquired somewhere. She had checked it for spells and curses and replaced it when she hadn’t been able to find anything. It seemed to have been a completely normal shell. Harry would have liked to investigate it himself, but he trusted her judgement. At any rate it fit in neatly with Draco’s sudden naval obsession.
Harry’s feet eventually carried him towards the village as he turned around at the end of his property. It was certainly an impressive stretch of land that came with the lighthouse. He still didn’t understand why he had been able to acquire it at so little expense.
Draco looked towards where she had vanished long after she had gone.  It was at least another twenty minutes until he made his way downstairs to his own room. His mother must have been the one who had searched his room, it was the only explanation. Draco was both relieved and confused. He didn’t know what to feel about this. He felt betrayed, because his mother obviously didn’t trust him enough to take care of himself, but then he also felt loved, because he knew how much it must have taken for her to overcome her reserve and act on her worries.
Potter snorted in response and Draco was happy to see a small smile stretch his features only to be replaced by the earlier unhappy scowl within seconds.
“I’m going to Apparate us there. The walk isn’t very far, but you need to know exactly where you’re going. Trust me?”
“See? Now you try it,” he added and carefully shook the pasta free off his fork, leaving a small circular nest of noodles on the corner of Harry’s plate.
closing a door on them is staggering, as is the amount of ligaments and tendons torn, in hands, knees and ankles, as well as bruises, lost teeth and concussions. If this is only ten percent of the accidents that were reported they have far bigger problem than even Luna had anticipated. Harry takes to writing down the names and kinds of injuries to cross reference with the people on the Ministry’s watch list once he is back in his office.
He realised he had gone too far, when Draco disentangled himself and got up. Harry was already resigned to his fate and thinking about what excuses he could make to leave and escape this unbearable situation, when Draco climbed into his lap. Draco took Harry’s arms and wrapped them around his own waist while he rested his wrists on Harry’s shoulders, playing with the hair at Harry’s nape.
Patience wasn’t one of his stronger suits. Harry tended to barge into situations before he knew exactly what was going on. He had got more than his fair share of serious talking-tos, when he had still worked for the Ministry, some even threatening suspension but it hadn’t changed a thing. He could still hear Hermione in her sing-song voice when she was doing something that wasn’t happening fast enough for him, as she went “patience is a virtue”. “Virtue my arse,” he had mumbled, to him it seemed more like a super power.
Draco was surprised when strong arms wrapped themselves around him from behind preventing him from leaving the bed. Warm lips pressed against his neck and then followed its line until they reached the shell of his ear.
Thinking back to the first time he’d offered his hand to Potter and been refused, Draco decided to go along this time – clean slate it was – took Potter’s hand and shook it.
Draco pulled his cloak tighter around his shivering frame. They’d decided he would make one last attempt to speak to Harry and that if he wouldn’t open his floo to Draco, he’d simply show up at his home pretending to have forgotten something in his room.
He can see Harry his face a mask of rage as he shakes his fists at Draco and the small man riding the dragonfly who as far as Draco can tell blows Harry a raspberry. The others are still going about their business but Pansy is looking at Draco whenever he gets in her line of sight.
Harry got up and quickly left the room only to return a moment later with a small box in his hands. He went down on one knee in front of Draco.
“Maybe the pages are just enchanted so only Malfoys can read them.” Draco added, not quite believing his own words. Why hadn’t the diary been available to his mother then, when she had searched his room? I didn’t make any sense.
Harry hands were roaming Draco’s body, touching everywhere he could reach, relearning all the little places that made him gasp and hiss and moan. They were kneading and stroking his back, then travelled across Draco’s lower back and came to rest on his backside, squeezing the beautiful firm buttocks and pushing their groins closer together. They both moaned.
Finally he made his way downstairs, following the scent of fresh fried bacon and coffee that was drifting up from the kitchen.
Harry was still in awe over the situation. He had never in his wildest dreams believed that he would be here now with Draco Malfoy of all people. He couldn’t have imagined wanting this as badly as he did, and most of all, he couldn’t have imagined Draco wanting to be here with him. For the first time in his life, it felt like being “just Harry” was actually enough.
Ginny had fallen up the three tiny innocent looking front steps of their home. This had happened many times in the past, when they were still moving in and usually ended with either of them cursing the ‘stupid stairs’ and vowing to get them fixed soon. They had never got around to it.
Standing in front of the door he knocked tentatively, not quite ready to face both Harry and Weasley, but to his surprise the door was flung open just far enough to allow Harry to pull him inside. Draco found himself pressed against the door from the inside by the man whose hands were already busy divesting him of his clothes.
“I was thinking we could cast wards on the doors together. Since you don’t have a wand we need to find a way to combine our magic.”
After that Draco went back to devouring Harry’s prick. Overwhelmed by the glorious feeling of having his cock sucked, his head fell back onto the pillow and he voiced his pleasure in a loud moan. Harry could feel his hips involuntarily thrusting up into Draco’s warm slick mouth, that motion however was soon prevented when Draco held his hips down as his head bopped up and down quickly a few times.
Harry cupped Draco’s face and kissed him gently, unhurriedly, before hugging him close again. He gently untangled himself from Draco, but intertwined their fingers to keep the connection between them alive.
How Harry could possibly have thought that the state of things was his fault was beyond Draco. Still holding the first letter tenderly, Draco sank onto the bed as he felt all strength leave him. He truly didn’t deserve someone like Harry and now it was too late, now Harry had left their home as well and who knew, maybe he would never return.
Over the next several weeks Harry forgot about the letter. Spending time with Draco was both exhilarating and exhausting. Harry had convinced himself that if things worked out the way he hoped he would never have to tell Draco how close of a call it had been that night. The guilt was eating away at Harry but he reasoned that he had to find the right moment to tell Draco and if that moment never came, Harry wasn’t to blame for it.
“Despite the double negative, your assessment of the state of your legs appears to have been accurate.”
“Ah, so that can’t have been it then. Anyway, he tried to bite me. Look,” Potter said, pulling his collar to the side where a dark red bruise was forming. It seemed like Rafferty hadn’t managed to break the skin. Whatever the hell was going on, Draco was only glad that he didn’t have to deal with a medical emergency as well.
He can hear Draco’s pants and feel his breath graze his cheeks and with every powerful thrust Harry feels more and more alive. He comes with a curse and would have slumped forward but for Draco holding him up. Unlike in the past, Draco’s completely silent as he climaxes. Draco pulls out much too soon, putting an unwelcome distance between them.
“Luna thinks the risk is too big and while I appreciate the sentiment, I think the greater good is of more importance here. I can’t sit by any longer and just let this happen to others, just because it’s not happening to me.”
Harry woke once, warm sunlight tickling his face through the open curtains. It was only when he tried reaching for his wand to close them, that he realised he wasn’t alone anymore. Malfoy seemed to have either fallen out of bed or deliberately gone looking for him. Either way, he was now wrapped tightly around Harry’s back, breathing warmly against his neck, while his arm was possessively slung around Harry’s waist. Nothing in the world could have made Harry get up, not even the sunlight or the imminent threat of Malfoy waking up.
Harry doesn’t quite know what to do with himself after vomiting his feelings all over her like that. She seems to know exactly what to do and it doesn’t take long until he has regained his composure enough to take down her statement and file a report. Millicent helps with a spell Luna must have taught her, making the author and the trace Harry himself puts on the report, untraceable.
They lay there for a long time, Harry breathing into Draco’s neck, clinging to his thin frame and Draco alternately holding him, gently rubbing slow circles into Harry’s back and whispering nonsense into the mop of hair that smelled of earth and roses.
Harry nodded without opening his eyes and his arms finally came up and wound themselves around Draco, holding him close.
Draco was about to examine the shell closer once more, when Holly appeared in his room with a quiet “pop”.
The same bookshelf that the picture of Pyxis and his friend had come from was shaking again and one of the boxes shifted forward ever so slightly. For but a moment, it just hung there and then toppled to the ground. As Draco bent down to retrieve it, he heard a distinct clicking sound coming from the desk. He turned around slowly and there as if to mock him was the top drawer, protruding slightly, obviously open. Draco used several curses that would make his mother scold him for days on end, before investigating further.
Draco’s left hand joined his right, gently cradling Harry’s face between his palms. He pressed his forehead against Harry’s before he spoke again.
Harry stands much too close and Draco shrinks away from his touch as Harry’s hand lands on his lower back where his shirt has ridden up. Harry’s hands are sweaty and cold against Draco’s skin.
What had got into him? Harry had most likely ruined everything. If Draco refused to see him now, how could Harry keep him safe or even keep his word to Mrs. Malfoy? After all Harry didn’t even know whether Draco saw him as anything more than a friend if even that.
“I never said... hmmmm.” Potter scraped his teeth across Draco’s Adam’s apple and completely derailed Draco’s train of thought. It was only when Potters erection began digging into Draco’s thigh that the fog of lust lifted enough for him to be able to realise what they were about to do.
“Yes, I promise, one year and you’ll stay away from me for the entirety of it.” With that Draco stalked away leaving Harry feeling oddly bereft.
Harry’s expression shut him completely. Draco couldn’t read him and his eyes gave nothing away. This was even worse than it had been during their school days. A reaction, any reaction at this point would do, anything but this cold hard mask. Draco felt tears burning in his eyes, as he tried and failed to find what he needed in Harry’s eyes.
“No,” Harry gasped, before covering Malfoy’s hand with own. Malfoy’s eyebrows rose in surprise for just a moment before he casually let his hand trail along the inside of Harry’s thigh, back to talking about whatever the hell they had been talking about earlier.
Work kept Harry occupied for the next few days and he didn’t get a chance to talk to Mrs. Malfoy. When he finally found the time to visit her, it was shortly before dinner time and she seemed less than pleased to receive him. Considering what he was about to tell her, he didn’t expect anything else. She must have sensed his reluctance to continue even in his letters to her.
“My mother asked me to inform you that your life debt to her has been repaid with what you have done for me.”
When Harry tried to tell him that he was worried because of the arrangement he had agreed to with Mrs. Malfoy he found that he couldn’t utter a single word that wasn’t gibberish. Mrs. Malfoy must have put a spell on him while he was at the Manor. The rooms there were probably rigged to make sure promises made to the Malfoy family were kept.
That was the last straw, no matter how much Draco yearned for Potter during the night when his treacherous subconscious filled his dreams with Potter and nothing else. He began hating the man again, first for letting him feel like the most precious thing in the world and then dropping him. He hated him for becoming the centre of Draco’s life and then vanishing without a trace and, most of all, he hated Potter because he needed him like the air he breathed and every moment apart made him feel like dying a little more inside.
“No we can’t” Draco said, tearing his arm out of Harry’s grasp. “I am not going to be your dirty little secret Potter! Go and play house with that red-haired bint of yours and stop wasting my time. It’s not like I was in love with you anyway.”
“Oh, Draco didn’t tell anyone, don’t worry. I was seeing someone in Hufflepuff at the time and Draco and I bumped into each other a couple of times on our way in and out of the dungeons. He was sporting some pretty amazing hickeys, if I recall correctly and so were you the next day, but neither were Pansy or Weasley whom everyone thought you were shagging at the time. And if there is one thing I know for a fact, it’s that Draco doesn’t share and is very obvious about marking his territory.”
He must have fallen asleep there, because that was where his mother had found him, berating him for being so careless and asking what had happened to get him into this state. Draco tried to tell her, he really did, but something stopped him, his mouth offering other explanations whenever he tried to tell the truth.
“I…no, of course not. I, sorry.” Harry said and then blushed prettily under Draco’s scrutiny. Hardly a trace was left of the self-assured physician who had so deliciously tortured Draco only a week ago. “It wasn’t very professional of me, I know, but somebody told me you might be interested and I just couldn’t let the chance pass me by.” The words left Harry’s mouth in a rush, making it hard to understand him properly. “And you are special, you always have been… I thought you knew that…”  with that he became silent, looking anywhere but at Draco and trying but failing to hide the evidence of his embarrassment behind his paper coffee cup.
The wind tousled their hair and made Draco press himself tighter into the warm body in front of him. Harry flew a quick summersault and whooped with joy. This Harry, with his ridiculous hair sticking up in all directions, a wicked daredevil, never sticking to the rules, was the one he’d so desperately admired and envied and now he was his. Being with him made Draco feel alive for the first time in months and it made him love Harry all the more.
The moment the flames touched the journal, Draco stumbled back as if he had been dealt a physical blow, before he crumbled to the floor. Harry was beside him in an instant, calling his name and gently shaking him. The room was spinning around Draco and he felt like he was about to vomit. He turned onto his side and before he knew what he was doing, he was crawling back towards the flames, reaching for the journal. Harry held him fast, his arms like a vice around Draco’s middle.
The next morning dawned bright and cold; the wind weaving through the vast grasslands surrounding the lighthouse. Harry stretched and yawned, his muscles shifting and his joints cracking. He really should have known better than to fall asleep in an old armchair, but even the fact that he would probably feel it all day couldn’t dim his smile. He was finally here.
Draco sobbed almost with relief as Weasley finally let go of his hands, immediately hiding them in the pockets of his black robes to make sure nobody else saw the blood trickling down his right hand.
Shit! She knows, Harry thought. Draco must have remembered the night after all and somehow his mother had found out about it. Was she blaming Harry? If she did, she was going to kill him. In the end it didn’t matter whether it was Molly Weasley or Narcissa Malfoy wielding the power of motherly love, it was always a force to be reckoned with.
In the dreams he walked the halls of his home, encountering people who all either looked at him with an expression of scorn or revulsion or and these were the dreams that had him waking up screaming, where he reached for the people he loved, the curse leaping onto their skin and devouring them whole, while Draco had to stand by, unable to help or even move.
“That’s none of your business.” Malfoy’s voice was as hostile as ever. “And if you say I can’t be on your land, I’ve got a permit, so there is nothing you can do about it either way. Now, would you be so kind as to bugger off? I’m on a bit of a time limit here.”
Being called an idiot is something Harry is familiar with, how his being an idiot relates to Malfoy escapes him though. Luna goes on as if his input isn’t a necessary part of this scolding.
It was a map; A map of the coastline, of the lands surrounding the lighthouse and the nearby village. It also showed an island just off the cliff, which Harry hadn’t notice last night, when he had arrived. Maybe it had been further out than the map suggested. Between the cliffs and the island there were drawings of some kind of fairytale creatures, with a lot of tentacles, more legs than seemed natural and long necks. The artist had taken great care to draw in many grotesque details even going so far as to colour their eyes a deep dark red. Harry shuddered at the images. It must be a very old map he reasoned, remembering one of his Muggle teachers telling him about how in the past cartographers drew leviathans and other sea monsters on maps in regions where a lot of ships had disappeared over time. Harry thought it very unlikely that with a lighthouse this big that had been here for generations, many ships had sunk near the cliffs or the village. The artist must have taken some artistic licence, embellishing where it wasn’t necessary.
When they reach his room, Draco cancels the spell and Potter falls onto the duvet. Potter is shivering uncontrollably and Draco is beginning to worry. He pulls the duvet out from under the shaking man and invents new swearwords while he does so, words about Potter’s idiocy, his enraging braveness, his stupid scar, his terrible hair and his ridiculous glasses. When he’s covered Potter and tucked him in, he feels a lot better but rants at Potter for a while longer anyway. It’s not like the prat doesn’t need someone to make sure his head doesn’t get too big.
“I—…no… help me, please,” Draco forces out. The words barely audible and taking all of his strength to voice.
Another year had passed, Draco had taken to getting his potion supplies by mail order so there was no reason to go to London anymore. Even Pansy had given up on trying to make him come with her. She still visited once a week, making sure he took a turn around the garden and ate at least one full meal on that day.
Harry had been pacing in agitation at Grimmauld Place for what felt like eternity. The only thing that kept him sane was the constant motion. He was afraid that if he stopped if only for a second, the despair and loss would break over him like the crest of a wave and carry him away back into the darkness.
“Brace yourself on the sink.” Harry’s voice was husky. His hands were trailing up Draco’s still pyjama clad thighs encouraging him to spread his legs further. A moan escaped him and he pressed his eyes tightly shut as the by now familiar feeling of Harry’s hand stroking his prick overwhelmed him.
Harry stood by the sink, staring forlornly into the filthy dishwater. He knew plenty of spells that would do the job for him, but most days he found doing chores had something calming and helped him to clear his mind. As ridiculous as this sounded to even himself, tonight it only made him sad, perhaps because he knew, that no amount of scrubbing would wash the filth of his lies away.
“Listen Malfoy, Ginny is waiting for me downstairs in the atrium. We have a dinner reservation and are already late. Could you just floo home? We’ll figure this out later. I’m sorry about Ron, he’s…”
A warm glow and friendly chatter were what drew him to the pub. It was the first real sign of human life. The warmth of the taproom made his glasses fog over, despite them being charmed against exactly that happening. He sighed and took them off, drying them haphazardly with a corner of his jumper. Inside the pub was crowded, people were sitting at the bar, in booths and at narrow tables, talking and laughing. In the corner a group of several men and women was absorbed in some kind of dart tournament.
Draco leaned in and pressed his lips gently against the corner of Harry’s mouth, then moved his lips along Harry’s cheek until he reached his ear.
Draco strolled into Potter and Weasley’s office as if he owned it, his confident stride not betraying the inner turmoil. It was only twelve months he told himself, he would survive twelve month of community service under the supervision of the two youngest Aurors in Department History. He was a Malfoy after all and if Malfoys knew one thing, it was how to survive in style and twist circumstances to suit them. Surely it couldn’t be that bad.
They got ushered into a waiting room because, while Harry might have been able to get them preferential treatment, he chose not to. This, Draco didn’t understand. It was bad enough that he was suffering from some bastardised version of premature male pattern baldness that affected all of him, being seen out and about wearing this atrocity was worse. Draco would have almost rather been bald and cold.
Devastated Draco stood frozen in the middle of the street, being jostled and constantly bumped into by the crowd. It was a long time before he made his way into an alley and apparated home.
What erupted from Draco’s wand was a stream of rainbow coloured lights – how fitting he thought sarcastically, that ran over their skin, then covered them like a cocoon of shiny lights, before separating from them and covering the floor, walls and ceiling and most importantly the blasted lift doors.
“It’s alright, I’ve got nothing but time, I’m still on forced leave, if Hermione is to be believed.”
A trembling moan of relief escaped Harry when Draco finally reached his already leaking prick and lapped at it languidly.
“Here’s something even more impressive though, that’s only one DNA string right there. Let me just open the archive.”
“What are you doing?” Draco asks, his voice sounding distressed, as if he had expected pain instead of whatever else was happening and didn’t know how to handle it.
Draco had tried to remove any reminders of Harry from his life during the last few years, but had never been entirely successful. Once, the sunlight had fallen on one of the small sofas in the west wing, causing the dark green colour to appear the exact same hue as Harry’s eyes. He’d incinerated the family heirloom before he could stop himself.
“What was it—…? The audacity. May I point your attention to the fact, Potter, that you are in my room and that I woke up with you in my bed and your grubby paws all over myself?”
Getting up to pick up a journal, Draco glanced across the paintings on the wall that were supposed to make the room cheerful but only managed to somehow underline the feeling of boredom as well as anticipation and the impression of fluctuation at the constant to and fro of patients being asked to wait and called to the examination rooms. He settled back into his uncomfortable chair and hid behind his copy of
“I… I can’t…” Harry’s voice broke and dry sobs wracked his frame. He buried his face in Draco’s shoulder, holding on to him tightly. Harry could feel Draco’s lips press into the crown of his head tenderly and then felt them move as he spoke against his hair.
“Draco, I’m so sorry, Dobby used elf-magic to make your hair disappear. I’m sorry it took me so long to figure it out. Well actually, it was Hermione who did.”
Draco’s fingers gently pressed into Harry’s temple and he leaned his forehead against Harry’s. Physical contact wasn’t necessary but Draco seemed to want to make Harry feel as comfortable as possible during the process. He felt Draco’s mind gently probe his and could see images of the day’s events flicker past. Ginny’s stumble and fall in front of Grimmauld Place, their rush to the hospital, the endless hours of waiting and pacing and then the healer speaking to him. The images became a blur after that and stopped with his arrival at Draco’s front door. Draco’s presence withdrew from his mind and Harry felt empty and lost without him.
They walked to the atrium in silence, if not companionable, it was at least the kind of silence shared by two individuals who had ceased actively hating each other.
Harry counted to three, holding Draco’s gaze with his own, before shouting “now” and throwing the powder into the flames, which suddenly burnt in a sickening greenish yellow hue. It took all of Draco’s strength to bring the journal close to the flames and then a smack from his left hand onto his right for him to let go, because his fingers wouldn’t obey him.
“My scans indicate that that is not entirely accurate Mr Potter. Can you please specify? This is important, this part of your memories shows an especially strong emotional reaction.”
Narcissa smiled and closed the door. Draco didn’t like what she was implying. Sure, he could take care of the family’s finances and multiple projects, he had done so before, and would until his father was released from Azkaban. What she also meant however was that it was time for him to settle down. Draco could still hear her say that at his age she had already been married and given birth to him. Her rebukes always seemed gentle on the surface, but beneath lay a hint of steel that even the Dark Lord had not been able to break. That layer of steel was love, love for her family, love for her offspring and this love was what had turned the tide of war.
Maybe Malfoy wanted to relive his glory days? Harry would never know unless he ran into Malfoy again, which considering he hadn’t headed for the hills at Harry’s threats was unfortunately quite likely. There were only so many places one could go in the village and the surrounding fields.
“As I said before, I’m going to retire to my rooms. I expect you to entertain my guest, while I’m away.”
The heavy book in the centre of the table was a volume on the Malfoy family history, only one of Malfoy blood would be able to open it and find anything other than blank pages. Draco was trying to find out what had happened to Pyxis, but so far had had no luck whatsoever. It was almost as if Pyxis was just a figment of his imagination, as if he had never existed. Draco was beginning to doubt his own sanity. The several dozen letters written by someone called DaVinci addressed to someone called Copernicus didn’t help to clear up the matter in any way.
The time they shared together made the last year seem like a bad dream. They bickered and laughed and it all seemed light and pleasant.
“I, well…” Harry was stalling, he seemed nervous. Draco thought bitterly that most of that was probably due to the fact that he didn’t know how to keep his promise to Draco’s mother without Draco’s cooperation. Finally Harry went on. “I didn’t like the direction they were taking us in. I felt that they were too harsh in their resolution to stamp out any and all kinds of dark magic, because what it all boiled down to was them looking for an excuse to bully the people who they thought got off too lightly in the trials. I didn’t want to support that. So, when Bill told me they were thinking of branching out I jumped at the opportunity.”
Draco sneered at her for using such a platitude but found himself agreeing with her nonetheless. She laughed when she saw his face.
It was dark by the time Harry got home. With most of his memories of the last three months returned, he almost expected Draco to be waiting for him, but of course he wasn’t there. He hadn’t been there the day before or any day before that; not even on the day Harry had suddenly awoken in his bed in Grimmauld Place with no idea that a little over three months had passed during, what to him, had only been a single night.
Draco straightened and turned to Granger, offering his hand to shake, which she took after hesitating shortly.
Potter turned to him for a short moment, smiling, his hand twitching as if he wanted to reach over and squeeze Draco’s leg again in a gesture of thanks, but he didn’t and Draco pretended he wasn’t disappointed. Potter eventually began to speak again. “And I am, happy, I mean, mostly anyway, but there’s something, I don’t know how to explain, it’s like…”
“My point is, I love you, no matter what. I love you cranky and I love you happy. I’m not waiting for some excuse to leave you and I just wish you knew that too. I’m in it for the long run and nothing could convince me otherwise. I mean I’ve even…” Harry fell silent.
Harry was still too drunk to stop himself from placing a fond kiss on Malfoy’s lips before he pulled him even closer and whispered into his ear.
Back in the room he sank into one of the chairs in the sectioned-off area, Potter was still working, but in front of Draco now stood a hot cup of tea. He wrapped his, by now, cold hands around the mug and inhaled the steam rising from the liquid. Careful not to burn his tongue he took a sip, not entirely managing to suppress the moan that escaped him when he noticed that the tea was exactly how he liked it. Two sugars and a splash of milk; in other words, perfection in a cup. He didn’t have time to reflect on how whoever had prepared the tea for him knew just how he liked it, because at this moment Potter approached the table and sat down opposite Draco.
“Not bloody likely! I am here to see the head optician, not to get poked and prodded at by the hired help,” said Draco disdainfully, still refusing to get up.
Pansy was one of the few people still keyed into his floo and still allowed to enter the Manor. Draco was scared of what would happen if she stopped showing up. She was his only regular visitor and his only connection to the outside world. At first she’d refused to bring him the things he’d asked her to, but as time passed she must have realised that nothing would make him leave the house, no matter how much he needed it and she had finally given in.
Cancelling on short notice was nothing new to Harry, but by now two weeks had passed since Harry had spoken to Draco’s mother and he hadn’t seen the man himself even once in that span of time. Something was definitely going on, because no matter how reasonable his excuses sounded, even Harry had picked up on the fact that Draco seemed to be avoiding him.
going?” Harry asked making air quotation marks when inventing a name for what Draco supposedly did with his time.
“I… yes…” Harry replied, suddenly looking even more insecure. Draco could see the thought that he’d been wrong about everything rise to the forefront of Harry’s mind. His eyes widened in mortification as realisation about his assumptions hit him. “Oh God, I… I’d better go. My lunch break is almost over, I am sorry Malfoy, I shouldn’t have assumed…”
Percy’s office is immaculate. Stacks of files frame one side of his desk and several pencils, all exactly the same length and sharpness, are arranged there as if by use of a straight razor. Percy adjusts his glasses, when Harry enters and gestures at the chair in front and at the very centre of the desk. He continues dictating something to a quill that’s racing across a scroll of parchment.
His nightmares haunted him even at work and he found he couldn’t concentrate on the case file he was supposed to be reading. When he’d arrived at the office that morning, Ron, who’d finally returned from an assignment that had taken him abroad for several weeks, had wordlessly handed him a cup of coffee and said they’d talk about “it” later.
Apparently accepting that Draco wasn’t going to answer his question any time soon, Draco expected Potter to get up and move back to his chair. He was completely unprepared for what came next. The mattress gave way even more as Potter climbed into bed with him again, wrapping his arms around Draco and nuzzling his neck gently from behind. The feeling of being protectively cradled against Potter’s warm chest was incredible and overwhelming at the same time.
Draco crowded Harry against the heavy desk, aligning their bodies and roughly pushing against him, the motion tearing a needy moan from Harry’s lips. The look in his eyes was dazed as he grabbed Draco’s arse and pulled him even harder against himself. He leaned over and whispered in Draco’s ear breathing hotly against his neck in the process.
Harry’s hand runs up and down Draco’s lower back whenever he stands and his backside whenever he bends down. Harry’s skin feels scaly and wrong. Draco seems to be caught in the constant down and upward motion of filling his bucket, lifting it and turning. It doesn’t matter how hard he tries, he can’t dislodge Harry’s hand.
“But I saw them, they were charred, every page for about forty years from 1816 onwards…” Draco felt like he was going around the bend. What in Merlin’s name was going on?
He opened his eyes to a bright and bleary world, blinking rapidly a few times waiting for it to come back into focus.
His breath fogged in the air as he stood in front of the closed front doors for the third time in as many years. He didn’t know what to expect. The wards had let him through this time, giving him hope. Surely Draco wouldn’t have keyed him back into the wards if he intended to crush his hopes? After all it took days to key someone into wards like these.
When Draco woke, he didn’t know where he was. Somehow he’d expected to feel stiff and cold, but he felt neither of those things. He felt warm and cared for and if he hadn’t known better, he would have thought there was currently a warm body snuggled against him. Draco analysed the information his body was sending him and realised that there really was somebody spooning him, an arm possessively draped over Draco’s hip and breathing warmly onto his neck. It had just been a nightmare. The whole thing about Ginevra coming back and destroying what he had with Harry had been nothing but a nightmare. Relieved beyond words, Draco slowly turned around in the embrace and pulled Harry closer to his chest. He pressed a quick kiss to the crown of Harry’s head, smiling as the characteristically tousled hair tickled his nose.
Gin was late as usual. Harry had received a memo earlier telling him that she would be ten to twenty minutes late. He chose to window shop to pass the time.
So Harry does. What he finds is not unexpected, yet shocking. The amount of hands that got broken by
He stops at the rim of the basin. Similar steps to the ones he climbed earlier lead into the water. For the first time, Draco hesitates. He wants to step forward, to immerse himself in the water, but something is holding him back, some instinct that he can’t explain. Pearly laughter unexpectedly reaches his ears and Draco looks around himself to find its source. The pond’s surface is now broken by tiny waves and Draco can see something darting along under the surface. A head breaks through the surface too far out for Draco to make it out clearly and the pull on him increases a hundredfold. Before Draco can stop himself, he takes another step forward, mere inches separating him from the edge of the water.
The silence stretched between the three of them and the situation became more awkward with every moment that passed.
Draco tried to put his hip into it and pushed against the wall panelling. What followed was only heralded by an ominous sounding crack. He could feel himself falling, backwards, into the wall, almost as if he was pulled. With too little room to manoeuvre let alone keep his balance in any way, he stumbled and fell. Draco’s back connected painfully with the sharp edge of something that he couldn’t see in the dark.
In the end it was hunger that drove him downstairs to the kitchen. Night had already fallen outside and the first stars had appeared. No candles were lit in room when he arrived and he carefully crept inside, not knowing what to expect, but anticipating the worst. The last thing he needed to see was evidence of Potter’s newfound interest in his girlfriend, not with the wound still raw.
He did his best to school his features into a sneer and went on to say the words that he already knew part of him would forever regret.
Even though he should look ahead, it seems that this is where he is supposed to go. Still, Draco takes his time looking at the trees. Finally it becomes clear why they seem so odd. The trees are people – or at least something like that. Where they come from the earth, they look like trees but from the waist upward they turn into people who look blissfully content and wave their arms in the breeze. The image makes Draco’s skin crawl.
His hand still burned where it had come in contact with Draco’s skin, filling his mind with images of what could have been.
“We should and we will,” Harry replied, taking care of the door with a quick locking charm, before attaching his lips to Draco’s once again.
Pyxis was staring down at him through serious dark eyes and for the first time in a long time, Draco felt like an intruder and not someone who had been allowed to seek refuge in this sanctuary. Pyxis had probably never wanted for someone to read the words he had written down to lighten his burden. Draco found that despite the guilt of reading something not intended for his eyes he couldn’t seem to stay away.
The library was incredibly dark, every corridor, even the one leading to the front desk was lined with shelves laden down with scrolls. The shelves reached from the floor to a ceiling that was much higher than it should have been considering the basement of the ministry wasn’t built like a cathedral. A warm yellow glow chased away the darkness in one corner and reflected warmly on the white blond hair of a man currently entirely engrossed in his work.
“Pull up your knees.” Draco said, his voice sounding husky. Harry could see him wet his lips nervously, but obeyed before he could change his mind. He reached behind his knees, held on to his thighs and pulled them to his chest.
“I need to check something but I’ll need to use my wand for it.” This new peace between them seems so fragile, Harry thinks it’s best to announce his plans rather than act without explanation. It’s a lesson in self discipline, but he finds he doesn’t mind so much, because he’s doing it for Draco.
Upon entering his room, Draco immediately noticed that something was off. It wasn’t like anything was missing, at least not at first. It was small things that were out of place. Someone had obviously searched his room and then meticulously tried to put everything back the way it was afterward. The conch shell still lay on the nightstand, but its opening was facing away from the bed. That wasn’t the only thing odd though; something else was missing entirely, Draco looked under the bed, maybe it had fallen down, when Harry had rushed him from the room earlier that day.
Draco rolled his eyes, but couldn’t suppress a smile. Apparently this was what he’d needed – nagging, outrageous, annoying, pushy Pansy!
He believed what he’d told Draco after the trial: they had to help create this new world and to make it better, but sometimes, when he was alone the responsibility of it all weighed him down. Nobody had said that life after the war would be easy and Harry hadn’t expected it to be. However, he’d hoped for a sense of closure or at least some form of minor happiness. Instead of the sense of equilibrium he longed for, all he felt was a disturbing aimlessness. He felt adrift between the old and the new world and sometimes he wondered whether this new world was going to be that much better than the old one, having left him with a sometimes overwhelming feeling of purposelessness and not much else.
It was late, but there was one more thing for Harry to do, before he could inflate his uncomfortable Muggle mattress and go to sleep himself. As unpleasant as that would be, he was not going to leave Malfoy alone for the remainder of the night in case there were complications.
At the last one, Draco feels himself cringe as the pain that had come from being cursed burns through him once more. He fearfully reaches for his chest, almost expecting to find his wounds reopened, but there is nothing there. He remembers the devastation and fear, remembers what it was like to live in a house so tainted by the Dark Lord’s presence that even years later, Draco sometimes still has trouble calling it home and meaning it. That last sensation was so strong that it blocks out many of the shapes that pass through him, what they invoke seems like a mere echo compared to the intensity of the one that came before them.
His heart beats loud in his ears as he runs. The floor breezes by, in contrast the walls seem to be crawling by. He knows he has to run faster to catch up with his guide, before what is chasing him catches up. Draco can hear panting breaths behind him and the sound of heavy footfall.
Draco found he was actually enjoying himself despite his earlier prediction. He jumped when Harry’s knee bumped into his under the table. Draco suddenly couldn’t breathe, when had Harry come so close? From one moment to the next the atmosphere between them had become charged and too intense. Draco was expecting it, but when Harry reached for him and held his arm by his wrist he couldn’t suppress a surprised gasp.
Time passed and the dripping sound of the water mocked his parched lips and throat from afar. Originally, he had tried to count to find out how long he was here, only guessing at the periods he had spent unconscious. Harry had been hungry at some point, but even that feeling had long since passed.
Recurring nightmares made Harry’s life a living hell for the next few weeks. The only ray of light in his otherwise bleak life was the times he spent watching Draco to make sure that he was okay. He’d abandoned the idea of polyjuice potion after seeing what effect spotting him had had on Draco.
Early morning air was always colder, but it would warm up during the day, smelling of fresh flowers and something uniquely summer. Draco pulled the covers tighter around them with his free hand, closing his eyes once more revelling in the feeling of the warm body pressed tightly against his own.
Potter shook his head. “I don’t. I’ve let myself forget that it’s alright not to be fine. I feel like the mask I put on and maintaining it has become who I am. I… I’ve let myself become empty, become something I can’t even love anymore. How can I expect anyone…” he fell silent.
No such thing happened and when Draco’s heartbeat had calmed down sufficiently he reverently set the book down onto the desk and then slumped into the chair in front of it. This right here was probably where Pyxis had sat when he had written those words that had become so dear to Draco. Maybe that was why the book had returned here, because this was where Pyxis felt safe and protected, where he felt like himself. Draco turned to the wall to look at the paintings. A few restoration spells had taken care of the thick patina of grime and dust and the portraits looked much like they must have the day after they had been finished.
It took Harry a moment to come up with an answer and he began to fidget, faced with Malfoy’s growing impatience.
He stopped in front of Draco’s flat and thought about what he was about to do. If his gut instinct was wrong, he’d be breaking and entering. His Auror career would be over because Draco would never agree to keep this quiet. Worry gnawed at him because no noise came from within the flat. Before he could change his mind, he started to dismantle the wards. The feat done, he unlocked the door and slipped inside the unfamiliar flat.
Harry carded his hand through his already messy hair in frustration. He was still no step closer to solving this and consequently also from settling his life debt. Mrs. Malfoy had asked for him to call on her again after today and Harry really wasn’t looking forward to it. He had no leads and frankly was running out of ideas of where to look. Short of stalking Draco under his invisibility cloak, there was not much more he could do and he really didn’t want to. The last time he had done it, it had ended in disaster for both of them.
The Manor wards were set in a way that meant howlers – unless sent by people keyed into them – self-destructed on encountering them. Draco had never been more grateful for that small detail in Manor security in all his life, if he was honest.
So Harry does. It’s difficult at first to untangle the curse and Draco’s aura. It is almost as if Draco’s own magic had fused with the curse, which might be due to the glamour Draco said he was forced to wear in public ever since sixth year. Harry can’t bear the guilt and lifts Draco’s fingers to his mouth and gives each fingertip a quick kiss in silent apology.
The head vanishes beneath the water again only to re-emerge much closer this time. It is a beautiful woman. Her white dress clings to her, where the fabric is weighed down with water and at the same time swirls and almost dances around her feet where it is still submerged. She walks up the stairs and stops about a metre from where Draco is standing.
“Mr Potter, you must leave. Master, Mr Potter won’t leave.” The elf shut its mouth, its eyes growing large in horror, as it realised what it had revealed. “You tricked me! I will go iron my ears immediately, I betrayed Master.”
Harry pointed his wand at Draco’s chest and began carving away the skin and flesh above his heart, making him scream in agony.
Draco turned over, burrowing his head into the soft pillows, but sleep eluded him. It was probably kept away by the ruckus the birds were making outside, he thought grumpily. On any other day, if he had been less tired, he might have enjoyed their song, but today he knew that before his first cup of coffee nothing would delight him. What could those creatures possibly have to chatter away about so loudly anyway? Maybe they wouldn’t be as annoying if he closed the windows.
He had planned for every eventuality and come up with a solution to make Draco take the parcel, or so he’d thought until Pansy Parkinson of all people opened the door.
“There’s one more test we have to do. You’ll have to wear your glasses for it, to make sure your eyes have properly adjusted to the lenses.”
And apparently he did. Much like the stars and star systems earlier, the cave was now filled with hundreds of double helixes.
He finds himself walking along an avenue, the trees on the left and right seem unreal. He is unable to slow down or look at them closer. It is almost as if he has no control over where he is going or what is happening to him, just as this thought comes to him, his feet suddenly stop and the square in front of him comes unexpectedly into focus as if someone had held a magnifying glass to it.
Of course they argued and talked at him for what seemed like hours, but Draco didn’t speak again. In the end they lit a fire and covered him with a blanket before they left. Although Draco had a sneaking suspicion that at least Pansy didn’t give a fuck about what he wanted and would return after the others had gone. He couldn’t even muster up the energy to care.
Harry stared at him, seeing his flushed faced, his wide pupils, and the errant strand of hair that stuck to his sweaty forehead and realised that he’d never seen anything more beautiful. He reached out to brush the strand of hair from Draco’s forehead, traced the shape of his brow with his thumb before he moved his hand down to cup Draco’s cheek, caressing the soft skin gently. Draco pressed his cheek into the palm of Harry’s hand and the moment was everything their first kiss under the roses had been, only better in the way that Harry knew Draco wanted and needed him as much as he did.
“Your complete and utter asshattery made me come to your house in the middle of the fucking night, that’s what’s going on.”
Harry doesn’t seem to notice and keeps praising Draco and touching him in ways that make Draco feel filthy and used.
They made it just in time. The creature must have kept Harry hydrated for as long as it needed to drain his life force from his body. The memory loss, they said at St Mungo’s was a mere side effect.
Draco knew he was sulking. Maybe it wasn’t the end of the world, but right now he didn’t care. At least the weather was cooperative enough to play along with his mood, he reflected, feeling another raindrop run down his cheek and dripping off his chin to join the many others on his robes. Even his mother hadn’t indulged him, just told him it was a part of life and that he’d better get used to it and don’t he dare throw a tantrum because the house elves had just set up the good china. Which is how he found himself standing in the rain, outside a shop in Diagon Alley, slightly drunk and desperate to come up with an excuse to avoid having to go inside.
When Draco woke up the next morning, he was alone in the room. He looked for Harry inside the lighthouse but hadn’t found him. Draco had assumed Harry went down to the village to go to the shop, but when he took Harry’s Firebolt to follow him, the village had been deserted. And not just deserted. The houses looked as if they had been uninhabited for centuries.  They were nothing more than decaying ruins.
“That doesn’t look like it’s a lot of fun,” the dragonfly rider remarks and hovers beside Draco’s head. “Are you sure you want to stay?”
As he was squatting in the dark recruits’ locker room beside a human being that was so scared that it tried to hide away in the shadows to protect itself from forces outside of its control, Harry had come to a decision. He would no longer turn a blind eye. He would observe and would make an effort to help if he could.
“What do you say if we make some new memories for you to hold onto? As many and for as long as you’ll have me.”
The daily routine was always the same. Draco would sit behind his desk, cross-referencing some runes from a case Potter was working on, doing some research or some other task the man or the department had chosen to settle him with. At least cross-referencing the runes they had on file at the ministry had been, if not interesting, at least intellectually challenging. Still, it hadn’t been as annoying as having to go through piles of letters full of praise for the Chosen One, every day. Most of them were harmless. While you found your usual hero-worship, your occasional pressed flower, poem and frilly underwear, there had also been some covered in unidentified fluids that Draco refused to investigate further. Potter had vanished those instantly on each occasion, the last one prompting him to storm out of the office and get into a heated argument with Kingsley. The next day Draco had been assigned to other tasks.
and while Harry found a few actual domestic violence cases, he can use to cover up what he is doing, the evidence he has uncovered shows plain as day that if a Slytherin, a former Death Eater or sympathiser has a so-called accident, which necessitates a stay in St Mungo’s, no criminal reports let alone charges are ever filed. Draco’s case being the only exception, not that it had made a difference.
“Can we just not?” Potter asked. “Just this once, can we not go there, about how all of this is my fault. Can we talk about something else? Please?”
“As if you care where I’ve been, I could have been devoured by a Devil’s Snare for all you care and don’t tell me it’s not true, you said as much.” Harry replied, not looking at him, but playing with his keys like a petulant child.
Later in his flat Draco contemplated whether he was just being paranoid or whether somebody was actually following him. If so, that somebody obviously had access to polyjuice potion. Considering what had happened to other former Death Eaters, it was very unlikely that the stranger’s intentions were to surprise Draco with flowers and a song.
“I thought he looked familiar. He looks like you did when we were at Hogwarts together.” Potter winked at him. Harry bloody Potter had actually just winked at him, Draco could not quite believe what was happening. Maybe he had fallen asleep to the constant ticking around him and this was just a bizarre dream caused by who knows what, maybe the French cheese he had had earlier. The last time he had seen Potter was when he had shown up at the Manor to give Draco back his wand, the very wand that at this moment was nestled into the folds of Draco’s robes.
Draco needed Harry to open his eyes and look at him, needed for him to see the regret in his eyes and that he was sincere about his words.
“Pansy, I am sorry,” Draco choked out. “I can’t… I just… I can’t go outside.” His voice broke, but he kept repeating his words over and over nonetheless.
“So sorry… didn’t mean to… upset you…” Harry whispered, trailing kisses along Draco’s neck. His arms still held Draco tightly even though he wasn’t trying to escape anymore. Despite his anger, Draco exposed more of his neck for Harry to worship, nuzzle and caress.
He could hear her from where he sat. His heartbeat still hadn’t slowed noticeably and he had barely made it to the first landing, before he’d slipped down to the floor.
The first time they’d kissed had been after Harry had taken Draco out to dinner for their first date. After hours of pleasant conversation, Harry had walked Draco home. They could have apparated instead, but neither of them wanted the evening to end. Ever the perfect gentleman, Harry had actually walked Draco to his front door and placed a chaste kiss on his lips before saying goodbye – or at least that’s what they told their friends. The events of that evening actually weren’t something they’d made up, well mostly anyway, but it wasn’t their first kiss, nor was it anywhere near their second, if one decided to keep count of such things.
Potter laughed. “Yes, sometimes, not unlike someone else I know. Come on. Up you get!” He said, hoisting Draco up bodily.
Forcing his erratic thoughts under control, he took a step forward, in an attempt to bridge the chasm he felt opening up between them. As Draco reached out for Harry, he took a step back, colliding with a bookshelf. Draco told himself that Harry shying away from his touch didn’t sting. Unable to let it go, he stepped closer yet again, not touching yet, but crowding Harry’s personal space nonetheless.
I took longer than Harry had anticipated to guide Malfoy back to the lighthouse. When the door finally closed behind them Harry breathed in a sigh of relief. They were safe. He manoeuvred Malfoy onto the sofa by the fire. When he let go of Malfoy his hands came away wet. Just covering him with a blanket wouldn’t be enough, especially as Malfoy’s lips were beginning to turn blue and he had begun to shake so much that he was close to falling off the sofa.
Pansy gently disentangled herself and held Draco at arms’ length. Apparently she hadn’t expected honesty but rather his usual snark.
“Sweetie, are you alright?” Her voice was closer now and he felt something akin to relief as he realised that she would spot him and help him soon.
Draco gratefully noticed that Harry kept thrusting inside of him for his benefit alone. His own erection was demanding attention and his right hand flew up and down it in swift moves as he stroked himself to completion, painting Harry’s abdomen and chest with his release.
They cling to each other and Draco isn’t surprised when Harry slowly begins undressing him. It all seems so strange, but it doesn’t scare him, all he needs is here in his arms, professing his undying love to Draco with every touch and every kiss. They are so desperate to feel each other that they scratch and bite and tear at everything they can reach, marking each other and staking their claim.
“You know, I am really glad I caught you. I was almost afraid I wouldn’t ever see you again after you received your full pardon.” Harry said still smiling but sounding more serious.
Draco concentrated his fire on the creature. It curled itself around Harry and the pedestal.  And for a moment, Draco thought he was too late, that the creature had taken Harry from him. In that moment, he had been so overwhelmed by grief and rage, he had been able to cast an Unforgivable curse. When Draco came back to himself, the creature had slid from the pedestal and was lying on its side with its legs folded together like a dead spider on a window sill.
Confined to the house that had seen his downfall and his worst moments, Harry felt like he was slowly going insane. His obsession with his failures and his sins grew to such an extent that he avoided his friends and began making up excuses whenever he was supposed to meet with them. Even though he should have known better, Harry was surprised when Hermione finally had enough and cornered him. She showed up at his home unannounced and let herself in.
Harry doesn’t know where Malfoy is leading him, but follows anyway. They eventually arrive at a small parlour that looks out onto the grounds. The curtains are half drawn and there are stacks of books everywhere. From what Harry can glean, most of them are about horticulture. The chaise lounge looks slept in, a thick blanket carefully folded hanging over one end. Compared to the rest of the Manor this rooms is the only one that feels lived in.
“See Potter, I know who I am, I know where I came from and I know what I headed toward. Being evil – as ridiculous as it may sound – is easy. You don’t need to question your actions; you don’t need to live up to expectations because people just don’t have any. All they expect from you is to be evil so they have a whipping boy should your side lose. Well, my side lost and all I need to be is a scapegoat.” Draco swallowed audibly but forced himself to continue speaking. “I’ve always known what would happen to me, if we lost and I’ve never thought past that. Either we’d win and my life as I knew it would be over, or we’d lose and I’d get punished for my sins. There’s never been room for anything else.”
The breath rushed out of his lungs as he painfully connected with the shelves behind him and then suddenly found himself on the floor, with scrolls tumbling down from above and hitting him on the head. He stared up at Draco who at the same time wiped the back of his hand across his mouth, as if he was trying to remove a taint Harry had left there. And finally Harry understood that this would never happen. Draco wanted to remove all traces of him, of what he’d so carelessly abandoned back when he’d thought other things mattered more. This was all his fault, but why wouldn’t Draco let him explain, why wouldn’t he let him make things right again?
Draco looked around himself in puzzlement. It was not long before he could make out what must have been an old sofa in the corner of the room. It too was covered in pieces of clockwork, but there appeared to be just enough room for one person to sit down. Making sure the sofa was not covered in anything that would ruin his cloak, Draco carefully lowered himself onto it. It was more comfortable than it had looked; apparently the cushioning charm had not entirely worn off during its presumably long and eventful life.
This was the first time Harry had allowed Draco to fuck him and if Draco hadn’t been so angry, he’d have been far more gentle. Harry didn’t seem to mind though and little needy sounds continued to spill from his lips.
and that was enough for him. It also appeared to be enough for Draco, whose smile at this moment was something Harry would never forget.
“Okay.” Harry plucked the rose from Draco’s trembling fingers and walked up what they’d already cleaned of the garden path towards the house, humming happily.
It takes several hours for Harry to free Draco from the curse and by the end of it they are both exhausted. Harry runs his fingers over every bit of cursed skin and only stops when everything that was cursed has become scar tissue.
When he came back to Hogwarts after the trials last summer to finish his studies and joined the other eighth years, he hadn’t known what to expect. He had expected to be shunned to become some kind of martyr or pariah for the causes of Slytherin, but what had actually happened was nothing like it. He had been completely and utterly ignored, by his housemates, his teachers and his fellow eighth years alike. And worst of all, he had been ignored by one Harry James Potter.
As he watched Sophia get swallowed up by the darkness, Harry wondered whether he had made the right decision. The next morning would see that letter on the table of his superior and no matter what the consequences, Harry would not withdraw his resignation. Thinking about the undiluted hatred on his colleagues face as he chased Malfoy and him down that alley drove home just how much the Aurors had changed, since such people as Tonks and Moody weren’t part of them anymore. Some of them had become crusaders for Death Eater retribution in their spare time, it seemed and Harry wanted no part in it.
“Of course you deserve better Draco! You were a victim of circumstances like the rest of us and if the public cannot see that, the Wizengamot would do well to remind it of that!” Harry hastened to assure the man in front of him, at the same time already noting that nothing he was saying seemed to penetrate.
talk about it. We need to make sure nobody who’s not supposed will be able to get in. Can you help me with that?”
Harry was suddenly frightened. Were they talking about him? Had Malfoy set him up? Just then Malfoy encircled him with his arms and began kissing his neck. Malfoy seemed so out of it that Harry suddenly doubted he was involved at all. Still, better safe than sorry, he decided and pulled Malfoy into a corner where the darkness would hide them both easily.
Harry didn’t want to be harassed, asked about what it felt like to kill Voldemort or why he hadn’t married his childhood sweetheart. The latter would have become clear if they had looked into the fact that Ginny had realised she was as much into men as women and was much happier with Luna living in what Muggles would probably call a “hippie Lesbian Commune”, so it wasn’t so much about him not marrying her, but rather about her not marrying him.
There was definitely something wrong Draco decided. He couldn’t have taken over seven hours to find the diary and then read a few pages in it.
“No, I sleep just fine. I don’t know why.” He squeezed Harry’s hand once wanting to give comfort despite his earlier resolution. “There just doesn’t seem to be enough time to do anything, even rest.”
It is safe to say that Draco wasn’t happy to be outed like that, especially since the flock of reporters at the gates makes it hard for him to leave the Manor. That Harry, who has all but moved in, is in the same boat, doesn’t soften Draco’s scorn.
He never made it to work that day, not daring to open the door till everyone else had gone home. When he’d finally unlocked the door and snuck out he could see Harry Potter surrounded by his friends, his arm around his girlfriend, laughing and joking while making their way to the exit.
Draco was standing in his study, none the wiser on how to fix this situation. He wanted Harry to be his friend, but at the same time he found it incredibly hard to come up with an explanation or an apology that wouldn’t sound completely half-arsed.
“I am not sure this is what’s usually meant when somebody asks to sit with somebody, Harry.” Draco said, unable to hide the smile that was stealing across his face.
“Ah well, we all have our crosses to bear, I suppose… So, I heard you were involved with Potter, is that true?”
A grin spread across his face. It was almost like old times, Malfoy was up to something and Harry was going to find out what it was.
Harry ran out of the room, laughing loudly as Malfoy chased after him, throwing Harry’s slippers after him, as he ran. It seemed that no floor was sticky enough to warrant foregoing just revenge.
“Is anything the matter, Malfoy?” Potter asked innocently, as if the letters hadn’t just changed into words.
Harry reaches for Draco’s hand, this time expecting the strange contours and the heat from the festering skin.
“Seeing as Pansy sent me this weeks in advance,” Draco said, holding up a small card that had “Draco Malfoy, guest of honour” written on it, “you were right to expect me. What brings you both here on the other hand remains a total mystery.”
don’t have time for private conversations.” Draco said. That stung. Not as much as the “Potter” did when it had been “Harry” in the past. He only wished Draco would give him the chance to talk to him, let Harry touch him again, kiss him and maybe be with him.
He didn’t stay to watch but went into the kitchen instead. The coffee machine sputtered into life and started to slowly dispense its life giving elixir into the pot. Harry hit his forehead against the cupboard several times. What the hell was he supposed to do now? It seemed like something was seriously wrong here and somehow Malfoy was all tangled up in it. Harry had no idea where to begin.
Harry was already dozing off and hardly noticed when Draco cast a non-verbal cleaning spell and pulled the covers over them. He did feel Draco pulling him close and snuggled up to him, inhaling his scent and revelling in the warmth of the beautiful body pressed against his own. With an all-encompassing sense of peace and belonging Harry drifted off into a dreamless sleep.
“Why should I trust you, after what you did to me at the pub that night?” Draco asked feeling guilty, because despite everything Draco had wanted it all at the time and he still wanted it. But how could he trust Harry? If that dragonfly hadn’t come along, Harry would have taken him against his will in that dream, unless…Harry had never been himself in his dream not until the very end. Perhaps… but that didn’t really matter. What stung more than anything was that Harry had lied to him.
Harry hadn’t owned an owl he had been entirely happy with since Hedwig, which meant that he didn’t have any means of contacting his friends aside from howlers and the Muggle way. He sighed, the topic at hand was too delicate. He couldn’t risk more people finding out about it. Muggle post it was. Harry conjured a quill and a sheet of paper, quickly writing down a message to Hermione, asking her if she knew anything and asking her advice on how to proceed.
“Look, I’m sorry…” instead of continuing, Potter quickly healed Draco’s wrists with a flick of his wand. The silence stretching between them became awkward and Draco caught himself staring at Potter’s slightly parted lips. Potter must have noticed it too, but he didn’t say anything.
It had become harder with every day. Draco seemed to crave physical contact. The nature of Draco’s sentence denied him even the simplest human contact. Harry began to consider it rather cruel when he saw what that deprivation did to Draco.
It was as if the world had fallen away, narrowing reality to nothing but the feeling of Harry’s hand against his skin. He barely noticed the heat of the afternoon sun on his face and even the scent of the roses and the sound of the wind seemed subdued as if somebody had muted the world outside of the space they shared. He gazed into Harry’s eyes and could feel him tremble. This was the first time they had touched since the incident in the recruits’ locker room months earlier and the intensity of it was almost overwhelming.
“I want to be with you, but I am not ready. There are still so many things, Ginny and I…” Harry’s voice trailed off.
Ginny was sitting at the kitchen table, a mug clasped in hand, pretending to read. The grip on the mug was so strained that her white knuckles almost seemed to glow in contrast to the sturdy dark ceramic in her hand. She appeared to have waited for him for quite a while. The lack of steam rising from the supposedly hot liquid in her mug told him as much.
“How could you even think that? In the end we were basically living together at Grimmauld Place!” Draco said, withdrawing his hand from Harry’s and wrapping his arms protectively around himself.
The first map he unrolled was also the one that Harry had found himself. Draco lit up when he saw the little notations and the images of the sea creatures just above where Harry now knew the city lay. Draco traced the lines reverently and then looked directly up at Harry.
“Of course I’m alright,” he burst out only to deflate instantly “I’m just tired.” He ran his hand through his hair not caring whether it got dishevelled.
At that, Draco had returned to the lighthouse and he tried to find Harry. In the end, he fell asleep from exhaustion and he spent the next two days looking for him everywhere. He even went back to the underground city, but found no sign that anything had been disturbed. Eventually, he went back to the nearest wizarding city to Floo for help.
Stars lit the patch of night sky he could make out through the windows from where he lay hunched on his bed. His face felt hot and raw where the tears had dried on his skin. At first he didn’t know what had woken him, but as he looked around, he could make out the dark shape of a figure sitting on the side of his bed, frozen in the motion of pulling the covers over Draco.
Magical Archaeology had fit the bill perfectly. Harry could see that it gave Draco a sense of purpose. The way he talked about the places he had been, since he had finished his studies, about the cultures he had visited and about the things he had learnt. One could fill whole books with all that knowledge, Harry had said and Draco had smiled, his cheeks red-tinged in pleasure at the compliment.
“That’s not the point, is it? The point… the point was…? Now you’ve made me forget what my point was! Oh Dear Lord, look at how humongous my hands are!”
Draco’s first impulse which he barely managed to resist, was to reach out and wake Harry. Instead he lay down on the bed, facing Harry and gently brushing an errant strand of dark hair out of his face. As if triggered by the motion, Harry suddenly moved closer, his hands still clutching the jumper and buried his face in Draco’s chest. This time Draco couldn’t resist reaching out an arm and pulling him closer. He pressed a soft kiss to the crown of Harry’s head and then just held him close, not wanting to disturb his sleep.
would love that story. He could see the headline before him now, “Former Death Eater and Nemesis of the Boy Who Lived Burned to Death” and smaller beneath it “causes of which are as of yet unknown.” Unknown my arse he thought. Clutching the side of the sink forcefully he stared at his reflection, noticing his dishevelled hair for the first time; he must have unconsciously been running his hands through it while reading out the torturous parade of letters. Draco turned on the tap and splashed cold water in his face repeatedly, willing his erection down at the same time. What he needed was a cold shower, it probably wouldn’t help much anyway though, but even if water from the tap was a poor substitute it was better than nothing. The cold water stung his face unpleasantly but it did manage to return his complexion to a more normal colour, effectively dissipating the impression of him hiding a colony of red glow worms under the skin of his usually pale cheeks. Drops of cold water ran down his chin and into the collar of his shirt, making him shiver. He cast the second drying charm of the day on himself finally managing to pull himself together. Taking one last look at his reflection in the mirror, he took a deep breath, unlocked the doors and made his way back to examination room 6.
, he thought happily. Smiling brightly he stepped into the room. His mind was already filled with thoughts of wrapping his arms around Harry, claiming what was his and ending up making love to him on the kitchen table, like they had so many times in his fantasies.
Harry now lay on this stomach and had somehow managed to reattach his left arm around Draco’s middle. It was both reassuring and terrifying to feel that solid pressure there, especially after the disturbing dream he had had.
“Yes, although I did discover a few cases of repeated domestic violence that I will have to get back to once this is all sorted out.”
Despite what he had said to Draco earlier, Harry found his hands wrapped around the cool smooth fabric before he could even make a conscious thought about it. He had to see Draco even if that meant yet another invasion of Draco’s privacy. With only a slight twinge of guilt, Harry grabbed the cloak and his keys. He Apparated to Wiltshire and walked across the Manor grounds to where he knew Draco’s rooms were located.
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled. Granger’s expression softened a little only to harden when she realised whose arms were still slung around Harry’s middle.
Draco begins to struggle against her grip and he can hear the pearly laughter again. He waits to make sure she is not looking at him before pressing the Malfoy crest against the back of her hand as hard as he can. The laughter immediately turns into a shriek of anguish and suddenly her hold on him is gone. Draco begins to kick and strike out to make his way back to the surface, the knight’s presence reassuringly close. He can feel Ligeia’s grip slither off his ankle, as the knight grabs his hand and begins to haul Draco out of the water.
It felt like an immense accomplishment when Harry reached the gents and was finally able to piss. The urine was loud as it hit the porcelain. He was so relieved that it took him a while to figure out why he had suddenly begun listening in on the conversation going on in one of the toilet stalls. Hearing what those people seemed to have planned for someone they didn’t like very much was sobering.
Draco’s breath hitched and his heart raced as Harry’s sinful hand began to stroke him. With every agonisingly slow stroke he could feel himself getting closer to completion. He had wanked to the thought of having Harry’s hands on him, worshipping his body but the reality was so much better than his fantasies. Harry’s strong left arm now pressed Draco against his chest, trapping him there, while his right hand made Draco moan and whimper into his open mouth.
“Alright Ginny, let’s talk, but not here and not now.” Harry said. “Come on, let’s go and have some coffee in the waiting area. I could do with one and I really don’t want to wake him.”
The slapping sound of footsteps moved further and further away from him. Then suddenly there were hands on him, hands that were gentle and reassuring, still he shrank away.
“Because now I know how much time I’ve wasted. And I’m still worried that my memories will fade away again. Even now, when I think of the dream I had last night, the story you told me about my rescue, I begin to forget. It’s little things, like the colour of my mum’s hair, my dad’s name, stuff like that. It happens when I think about that time for too long. I’m scared I’ll forget you again.”
It was days before Draco even left his bed. For the first time in his life he didn’t care about his appearance. Nothing seemed to matter, nothing cheered him up, not even the expensive chocolates and cheerful conversation his friends provided.
Draco got up and crossed the distance between them. He didn’t quite dare to touch Harry, so he held his gaze instead.
Shaking with terror, Draco crawls to the edge of the water and the moment he touches it, the entire pond lights up and Ligeia lunges for him, pulling him into the water with her, at the same time that a tentacle like arm closes over empty air, where Draco’s ankle had been only a moment ago.
Every room in Draco’s flat appeared to be flooded with light when Harry arrived outside the plain building and all the curtains were drawn. He could see a single shape moving around the flat, walking from one room to the next and looking more relaxed than he’d had in days. Harry waited for Draco to turn off the lights and go to bed so he himself could retire, but Draco didn’t appear to be wanting to be that forthcoming.
The healer had finally caught up with him and cast a silenced bubble around them to keep the disturbance he was creating to a minimum.
“I… but how? Nobody has seen him for months, years even; nobody knows where he is, or what he is doing. He probably left the country and has forgotten all about me, happily fucking every bloke he meets for all I know,” Harry said, hoping that it wasn’t true.
“I’m sorry to say, this is only about ten percent of what we have. The rest seems to be in storage, but I should have it in your office before I leave for Scotland. The problem is that these can’t leave the building, so you’ll have to look into them while you’re here. I hope that’s ok.”
Draco ran his hand along the dark wood of the mantelpiece, not a speck of dust clung to his finger. Harry had definitely been thorough in his efforts. Around a series of holiday photographs, they’d arranged some pebbles, seashells, bits of twisted gnarled old wood and a few feathers they’d found. There were many photos. Like always, Draco’s gaze was immediately drawn to his favourite picture of the two of them. Despite what others might expect, the ones from the holidays in Paris or Barcelona weren’t Draco’s favourites, his favourite was one they’d taken at the beginning of their relationship during an impromptu weekend trip to Hogwarts.
, but he didn’t say that out loud. Draco didn’t quite manage to entirely keep the bitterness out of his voice as he spoke.
The bench was cold and solid beneath him. It was always the same bench around the same time, every single day. The phial was out in the open again and Draco traced its shape with his fingers. Seeing Potter again after such a long time tempted him all the more to just give in. Round and round the distorted image of his own face went as he twisted and turned the small glass object in his fingers. Whispering to him about what lay beneath, drawing him in more than on most days.
His hands were wet with perspiration, and his heart was hammering away in his chest like a tiny frightened bird flapping its wings desperately trying to escape the confinements of its cage. The sharp lines of the carved wood cut sharply into his back as he pressed himself against the door, his breath leaving his mouth in short panicked gasps.
The fact that he couldn’t have Potter, made Draco want him all the more. This need for Potter was not normal or healthy, he knew. It had grown stronger over the last few months with Potter being constantly around him. Taking care of him, where he himself couldn’t, protecting him at work and generally being much less of a prick than Draco was used to.
“So…” Draco cleared his throat, this being a word he had been using an awful lot around Harry in recent times. “Thank you for dinner.”
Slowly he felt Harry withdraw, his breath leaving his mouth in panting gasps. He felt his face cupped by strong hands and closed his eyes as Harry pressed his forehead against his own only somewhat successful in getting his ragged breathing under control. Draco could make out some of the words Harry whispered against his lips before capturing them again in the sensual slow movement of a languid kiss.
Draco used his right hand to wipe the sweat from his brows and when he looked outside again the street was deserted, there was no trace of there ever having been another person.
“Oh come on Harry, you were awake enough to crawl into my bed this morning. How could you think what happened in the garden was a dream?”
It was no secret that Draco was gay – everyone knew, or so he assumed. He’d never even tried to keep it hidden. What would be the point of that really?
They were a family; they would always be there for each other, no matter what. This truth to Draco was universal. He sometimes wondered what it would have been like if he had had to grow up without this sense of security and often his gaze travelled only to alight on a small scrawny boy with messy hair and green eyes.
When Harry, no Potter, returned a while later looking exasperated and harassed Draco refused to meet his eyes as he sat in the chair he’d been occupying every single day Draco had been in hospital. He heard Potter drag a frustrated hand through his hair more than he saw it. An uncomfortable silence settled over them.
Feeling his anger boil up after months of taking abuse from Weasley, he thrust the instructions back at the man in front of him.
“You insufferable git!” she yelled before embracing him impulsively. “I really missed you this past year, you know?”
If he had been Pyxis, he reasoned, his personal belongings would be locked in the desk. Draco sat down in the high-backed heavy wooden desk chair and eyed the table in front of him. He took out his wand and cast several unlocking spells, but none of them seemed to work. Eventually he grew so frustrated that he took a dagger from one of the shelves and tried to pry open the top drawer. The knife dug into the wood, leaving deep gouges, but didn’t seem to make much headway with getting it open.
When the kiss ended they both lay there panting, just looking at each other. Draco reached out and pressed his hand against Harry’s chest, spreading his fingers and pushing Harry onto his back, never breaking eye-contact.
An expression of such intense hatred crossed Weasley’s features for a second that Draco was convinced the man would kill him then and there, consequences be damned. Weasley gave Draco’s hands another hard squeeze, making sure the artificially sharpened edges of the toothbrush’s handle bit into the tender skin of Draco’s palm before speaking again.
Potter was standing in front of Draco’s desk now, obviously expecting an answer. He was bending over it, while supporting his weight on his knuckles, like some ape-man. The comparison made Draco smile.
Harry was still worried about Mrs. Malfoy’s agenda, but he couldn’t put off refusing her summons forever. Which is how he found himself with some trepidation standing shivering and worried outside Malfoy Manor, waiting for the wards to be lowered so he might approach.
“What do you mean the whole world? It might lie open in front of you Potter, but the only thing that’s waiting for me is a home haunted by nightmares as well as a whole public that’s only waiting for me to step outside of this building to take the law into their own hands and string me up on the next tree.” Draco said angrily. He continued in a calmer, almost resigned sounding voice before Harry could say anything.
Grabbing Draco’s shrunken boxes, furniture and suitcases and dropping them into his coat pockets, Harry continued. “Sorry about the inconvenience of moving your things like this, but the ministry is refusing to lift the anti-apparition charm, which means I can’t just side-along you either.”
His arm, still outstretched over the empty bed towards the door, was a dark shape against the darker shadow of the rest of the room. It was much later when he was finally able to go back to sleep.
Draco felt like his whole world had just come crashing down around his ears. How had they known? They’d been so discreet. Not even Harry’s best friends had known. He didn’t even dare to look up at Harry for a minute as he tried to get his feelings under control.
“Harry Potter!” he said aloud once more and the book flew open in front of him, revealing the first page. Draco couldn’t help himself as curiosity overcame him and began to read.
“I—“ Harry swallowed and finally moved away enough to meet Draco’s gaze. “Please don’t be messing with me”
“Sometimes. I am not sure I’ll ever be rid of it, of any of it really.” Draco said, suddenly serious.
“It’s a date then.” Draco said, feeling slightly gobsmacked at the enormity of what lay ahead of them and grinning stupidly.
The deserted bathroom was quiet for a few minutes, before two voices could be heard from the stalls.
The memory of what had happened the last time Draco had tried to speak to Harry about a shared future kept him from bringing up the topic himself or even taking their shared intimacy one step further.
“Well, Potter, congratulations on saving the world, on vanquishing the darkest wizard of all time. Thanks for trying to save me, even though I didn’t deserve it.  Here’s to you, may you be happy with the life you chose and may you be able to forgive me for not letting you save me this time.”
he wondered? After many long minutes he finally got up, took his scroll and left the library. He took the long way around, hoping to spot Draco at his desk one last time before he left, but apparently having anticipated his move Draco was nowhere to be seen. Sighing, Harry made his way back to his office in despondent silence.
Draco had never seen Harry so angry and despite the fact that he was about to get married to Harry, he finally realised that Harry would stick up for him no matter what, even to the people he loved.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand on his arm to alert him to what they were about to do and as childish as it was, Draco couldn’t help the laughter that rose to the surface as Harry made him leap over several large puddles in a row. They didn’t manage to get clear across the last one and even though Draco’s shoes were now soaked through, he couldn’t find it in himself to care. Despite all his reservations, he had definitely ended up having fun the Muggle way. Harry’s smile rivalled the sun in brilliance when Draco told him so.
The creature screams with frustration, but grows ever smaller as Ligeia pulls Draco further into the water. It is not long before he loses the ground beneath his feet and she pulls him under. He can’t breathe, unlike before. Her grip is like iron on his arm and when he begins to struggle to free himself, as his lungs begin to burn, she only smiles at him, pulling him down further.
When he finds it, he turns around, his hand on the door knob, “keep it, if you like, it’s not like I don’t have another one at home. Yours in fact.”
This was getting stranger by the minute. Draco must have somehow fallen asleep on the shell and broken it. Which in itself didn’t make any sense whatsoever, because the shell was so hard that the odds of him getting bruises and possibly breaking a rib while lying on it seemed much higher than the shell breaking under his weight. Though none of that explained where the arm around his waist came from. Draco was a bit scared of what he would find if he turned around.
Sometimes it still felt surreal to Draco and he wondered what would happen when he left the hospital. As the time of his release drew nearer, he began to worry.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. As scared as he was of the path in front of him, at least he could be sure of one thing – Harry walking alongside him. He turned around in the embrace and brushed his lips across Harry’s, his heart too full of emotion to be conveyed through words alone. Their kisses were tender and without any urgency, the fact that they could be discovered at any moment completely forgotten.
Draco looked at him as if to say “really, you’re gonna go there?”. Apparently Potter did want him to go there.
Draco still didn’t know what had happened at the trial. He’d entered the courtroom convinced that by the end of it, he’d be on the fast track to Azkaban and he knew it was what he deserved for the things he’d done. Nothing he could do would ever make up for his sins, his soul would always be tainted. Even though the Wizengamot had for whatever reason chosen to forgive him, he wasn’t sure he ever could.
Draco sank back into his chair as all strength left him. It had been Potter after all. He felt anger flare inside him at the realisation. How dare Potter do this to him, taunt him like this? A little voice at the back of Draco’s mind reminded him excitedly, that this really wasn’t the point. What was the point then? He wondered. The tiny voice piped up again. His eyes widened in shock as realisation hit him. Harry wants me! When he finally looked up to meet Harry’s cast down eyes, he’d already made a decision.
He had never spent much thought on whether he might be bi or maybe even gay. Ginny and he were supposed to get back together at some point. It had been years and Harry still felt guilty about not talking it out with her. She was seriously casually seeing Dean and Harry found that he didn’t mind in the slightest. But he had never asked himself why he had got over her so easily. None of the women he had dated since had left a lasting impression.
The chest contained what appeared to be old linen and strangely enough fishing equipment. His arm full of fabric Harry looked around himself and decided to deposit the entire load on the wicker chair by the old wardrobe in the corner. He dug through the fishing equipment, cursing when he cut himself on a fish-hook. Having had enough of battling fishing line and hazardous spikes, he used his wand to levitate the whole bundle to the window and let it drop to the grass outside. He would take care of it later. He stuck his injured forefinger into his mouth to stop the bleeding and went back to the chest. It was just large enough to keep his suitcase in until he needed it again. Or so he thought. The chest looked a lot larger from the outside than it seemed to be, because the suitcase wouldn’t fit.
“Exactly!” Draco replied disillusioned enough with his family’s antics to agree, while still pretending to claim the higher ground.
“I went to see a mind healer because I realised that there was something I didn’t remember and I wanted to know what happened.”
For about two weeks, Harry had been in a coma and Draco had sat with him most days, until Hermione told him he should leave. She had said the scans indicated that Harry’s brain was healing itself but that whatever happened in the cave and in the weeks leading up to it would most likely be lost. If Harry saw Draco when he woke up, it might agitate him. His condition, she reasoned, was too delicate for that.
Draco had finally had it and decided to kiss his lover into silence. They kissed for a long time, tenderly and slow as if having to relearn the shapes of each other’s lips, savouring the taste as if it was a new flavour they were just enjoying for the first time. When Harry finally stopped trying to break the kiss to continue speaking, Draco released him, still staying close in case he needed to shut the other man up again if he wasn’t willing to listen.
Potter’s whole attitude seemed to change. He straightened up, took several steps back and unlocked the door before replying.
“I’m sorry, so very sorry.” The man peppers light kisses all over Draco’s face, tracing his eyebrows, kissing his eyelids, his nose and then finally his lips again. “It’s my fault.”
It was much later during the day. Night was falling outside and the rain still hadn’t let up. Harry and Draco were sitting in his room and a fire was crackling merrily in the fireplace. Draco had enlarged his favourite armchair until it became a loveseat that easily had enough space for the both of them. Harry’s head lay in Draco’s lap and Draco was absentmindedly running his fingers through Harry’s hair.
Today had been no different. Weasley had waited for Draco in front of his tiny corner office, leaning against the doorframe and smirking. Draco knew he was in trouble if Weaselby was that happy to see him.
Draco anxiously turned towards the charmed mirror and stopped to take in his reflection. He didn’t look like a dork or how Potter had looked during their school years, he looked refined and sophisticated and if Potter’s reaction was any indication, he also looked hot. Carefully taking off the slender silver frame, he handed it over to Potter.
Draco smiled despite himself. The compliment didn’t make any sense at all, at least not to him, it probably didn’t to Harry either, but it was a compliment nonetheless or so he hoped.
Draco looks around himself looking for evidence of what happened last night. There is no sign of any disturbance. Where is Harry? The shock of realisation wakes him fully. It has been nothing but a dream. Nothing but one of the innumerable dreams he has had since Harry, no Potter, he reminds himself, has saved him from the Fiendfyre.
“I’m not doing anything,” Harry says, fascinated by how the skin underneath his fingers seems to lose some of the inflamed quality, the colour returning back to a more normal skin tone.
Harry could barely make out the phial from where he stood across the flowerbed. He wanted to walk up to Draco and demand to know what was in it that kept him so engrossed every time he took the thing out. But of course he couldn’t just walk up to him, being polyjuiced as a ginger-haired bloke and all. A cold wind was blowing through the park when Draco finally caught him staring across the flower bed.
Water from the grass soaked the hem of his trousers as he walked through the garden they had both laboured so hard to uncover. It didn’t take long for him to find Draco. He lay beneath the rosebush where they had shared their first kiss. The man was fast asleep, not waking up despite shivering in the cold air.
He had given up scolding his house elves for obeying Pansy. They always pretended to be sorry, but he knew they thought they were helping him by taking orders from her. They were probably right.
Harry was terrified when he finished, he pulled away from Draco, unable to look at him or even watch his reaction while Harry’s very soul felt so exposed.
“You are trespassing, please return to the areas designated for public use,” Draco says, his voice void of emotion.
“Oh no”, Draco groaned, “not another David Copperfield.” But then, maybe not all was lost, he decided to give the second page a chance, because he wasn’t quite ready to believe that his ancestor and namesake was as incredibly dull as the first page seemed to imply.
“Hmm, but it’s so delicious, how will I be able to resist? I suppose, if I spilled any of it on you, I’d have to eat it off of your…” Now it was Harry’s turn to blush furiously.
He was wandering aimlessly when someone ran straight into him, causing them both to stumble and fall to the floor. Harry was so used to people making way for ‘the great Harry Potter’ that he’d been completely unprepared.
Draco doesn’t have to continue for Harry to understand. While what he wants most is to chase the darkness around Draco away, he knows it’s not as simple as tearing open the curtains and casting a few cleaning charms. Although, coming to think of it, the latter might be a good idea. Draco seems to have anticipated his objections to using the room and calls a house elf in to prepare the room for what they will have to do.
Over a year had passed since their last encounter. Harry was standing in front of those dark oak doors again, waiting for them to open. It had taken him longer to break through the Manor’s wards than he had anticipated, they obviously had been reinforced since he’d last been here, but he’d finally made it.
Much later that night, Draco picked up that very same shell. He couldn’t stay away any longer. The evening with Harry and finding out about Pyxis’ fate were too much to bear. He grabbed the shell, deliberately choosing its soothing influence over the dreariness and devastation of real life.
