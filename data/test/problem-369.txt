Today would be a disaster.
"Minerva, do you not
How did he even have a foot left to burn? What had gone wrong with the blasting spell? Why was fire so
"Dad!"
"A spell?!" Remus repeated loudly, like a git.
" he breathed, looking skyward as if he were welcoming some sort of cosmic event. "Three days on sabbatical and I'm going barmy. How'd we used to go all summer with nothing to do? Is it the kids, have they ruined my laze?"
"Me?!"
, Ron thought.
, James tried, making the symbol again and again. He gave a tentative smile through his own annoyance.
Was it a crime to help the people he loved?
“--company than you ever dreamed you’d have,” Remus finished for him. They’d had this conversation before.
"What?" she snapped, already whipping out her wand and preparing to Apparate. "What's happened?...Arthur!" A million images flooded her brain: Alec was bleeding out, or James blew up the kitchen, or a Death Eater was holding them all hostage and only Arthur had managed to slip away -
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't take lessons in logic from a Death Eater spy who got himself digested by a snake."
"Still nineteen to eighteen," he breathed, reaching into the box to choose his winning level-piece. "Got anything else? Going once - twice - "
Potter fists his scorched fingers through the trousers and throws his weight against the door. For a heart-stopping moment, Draco thinks the click meant nothing, it was just another trick up the old witch's sleeve! But then Potter grunts, shifts, his arse perks up a little as he engages his thighs, and the heavy door swings out.
"Right. Here's my card," he slipped a business card into his hands and Harry fiddled with the corners.
"Daddy, I fell," he announced loudly to clear things up.
Four weeks. James wasn't sure whether he should be horrified or impressed at how long Arthur had kept a living, breathing, meowing, shitting cat a secret.
he said simply. Monty looked at the bed, at James's side. He shook his head.
James thought with satisfaction, blinking away his own tears at the sound of the Scotsman's choked words.
He threw himself down on the settee - on James's side, since she'd taken his. He tried to push away the memory of that morning's visit to the shop in Aberdeen, before it opened, before Beatrice arrived. He tried to push away the way James had looked at him after his shit comment and little smirk, but it was burned into his mind's eye.
"Cast another warming charm, will you?"
Normally he would have argued, he would have said he was fine and he didn't need his help, and fuck off for offering. But today he relented with a sigh and a stiff nod.
"Harry was always independent," Hermione murmured to Ron in a pleased way.
He would not go back to a tiny studio flat and nightly blanket forts, and he wouldn't go back to working sixteen hour days just to get Gibbs Goddamn Goodies up and running.
"Nothing wrong with asking for help, you know," Draco said, bending low to press a quick kiss to his lips. James kept his mouth firmly clamped shut, mindful of his breath and not wanting to spoil the mood. There was something to be said about using sign language, especially in the mornings. "Unless you're still too much of a
James frowned. It
“Thank you once again for your eloquent input, Mr. Gibbs. We’ll table that if you’re unsure, Mr. Charming, there’s no need to decide right away. Is there anything you would like to work on for your own purposes?” Draco took comfort in his old familiar Mind Healer script, even if he was using it on his old-school-enemy-turned-amnesiac-Muggle.
Mr. James frowned quite seriously and Daddy looked appropriately chagrined.
, Dad would say. In case of what? In case a kidnapper snatched them up and didn't think to check their pockets? It was 2010. Everyone and their dogs carried mobiles.

Draco shook his head, working up a scowl to mimic how he'd looked that day in the mirror. He fumbled his wine glass, spilling some of the fine Elvish vintage. Still shaking his head and scowling fiercely, he leaned forward to trap James's hands once more.
"July 1998."
James scrubbed a hand - one of those enticingly strong, warm-looking hands - over his stubbled jaw.
“Do you - er, I’m rubbish with these, but do you need - ”
"Yeah." Potter's very somber now, somber and grim and not at all joking. But mad people are rarely convinced of their madness.
. Anatomy, for example. I was always quite good with anatomy.”

shift in a row. Had tae pay the nanny three times over!"
Harry let himself find that temperature, and it indeed came from the sun. The space was indistinct but there was plenty of sun and the windows were huge and, lacking divided panes, practically invisible.
He was drawn to Draco, time and time again, for better or for worse, because that was how it had always been. They energized each other in a way he'd never felt with Monty, or Aarti, or Ginny.
"I said that?"
say anything?" Draco countered.
Harry has too much to drink at a lesbian bar and spoils just about everything.
- you can't even...can't even...you can't do whatever it is I just asked you to do."
"I can think of precious few people who might be more interesting than you, Haz," said Kim.
, Monty insisted.
, and
plus-size lesbian mannequins. Right, Hermione, love?”
Arthur shut the door behind him and flopped down on his unmade bed, which creaked loudly. Arty patted it absentmindedly, like he always did after some annoying piece of second-hand furniture "greeted" him.
They fight. They always fight. Fighting is in their blood; it’s the fire that gets them out of bed and into the Great Hall. It fuels their appetites when grief and trauma would have food turn to ash in their mouths.
Harry was silent, then, "Yeah." She didn't ask for details.
"Ridiculous," he scoffs, because
The large window behind the desk was charmed to show a sunny field of white peacocks, because Draco Malfoy was apparently still every bit the posh wanker. Pretty glowing orbs of light floated over their heads, and the arched ceiling was surely a product of magic, seeing as the outside of the building was far too stout to allow it. The dark hardwood floor matched the dark beams of the arches, but the cream-colored walls, rug, and ceiling kept the room feeling bright, clean, and open.
"WHAT?" he snarls, not looking away from his weird little project.
Remus was just tucking into a new box of Charming Chocolates at the Head Table during breakfast when Hagrid tossed him the Daily Prophet. The front page was a clear threat to this beautiful morning - a headline screamed about yet another death linked to an illegal potion called Prism. He scanned the rest of the paper idly as he sucked on a truffle, wondering what it was that had Hagrid beaming at him. He found it on page 9 in the form of an extensive op-ed that took up the top half-fold:
Malfoys don't share, and they don't apologize.
Tony missed a snap and the sound of metal scraping against metal broke through Ron's thoughts. He sent a deadly look at his twitchy partner, who grimaced and brought his hands back down.
Draco was on his third round of checking through the month's supply of potions that would be shipped out to Potter when Blaise interrupted.
James never said no to that and by the time they made it home, he was exhausted and his whole body was screaming. He collapsed in a kitchen chair and summoned his pain potion for a premature dose, resolving to go to sleep early tonight.
"If you'd like to see where you'll be sleeping," Draco cut in loudly, "I'll reveal the coup de gras…."
"But you weren't there when he needed you!"
[incoming text from: J-bird]
"I-I-I - " Remus stammered, at a loss, still staring at Harry who was looking back at him coolly. The Thing - the robot, Monty called it - was vibrating violently now. Its arms were spinning in their sockets and it was looking less and less human by the second.
"Hum? So, yours was...Scorpium?" He only just caught himself before he tried to guess Scorpius's mum's name was
"No," then, opting for honesty, "well, yes, but I'm not running away. I just want to look at some houses." He was an adult, this was not a prison, he was allowed to do as he pleased.
“Alright, Potter, what’s my mission?”
Monty looked alarmed and James couldn't blame him. He never closed early without a damn good reason. And while he'd explained the books before, he had never asked him to do this part.
, he said as he studied the shine of the wood.
"Check out now or come back tomorrow, ma friend!" the Scotsman called, closing the cash drawer. "Got tae get dinner started fer the wee ones."
Ron blinked before the question registered. His head whipped over to Hermione - she was just as breathless as he felt - before he answered:
“You…” He blinked rapidly again. “You thought about...about abandoning them?
"It'll start working when we get closer to the outer treeline—"
"Starr's is shut down," Nott said. "And Goldstein can't prance back into the Ministry, but there's other ways to make money."
They went to bed early that night, but neither managed to fall asleep for several more hours. Alec tried to convince himself that it was just regular Christmas excitement that kept him awake.
"Out. Get us
"Right!" he said, his voice much higher than before. "I'll just - I'll take care of that."
“Ah! Ah ah ah!” he crows pitifully as he claws at his leg.
"The other side was led by a powerful dark wizard," Remus answered. "Called himself Lord Voldemort. To this day, most witches and wizards are afraid to say his name… Harry killed him."
Two hours later, he was discharged from St. Mungo's with a nerve tonic and a calming draught, though he wasn't particularly nervous. Jittery, certainly, but that was more from the excess of magical electricity that had his hair standing on end. Draco begged off work early to escort him to the Manor, where he would stay for the next week or so while the crime scene in his kitchen was sorted. The man laughed maniacally as he ran his hands through James's sky-scraping tresses.
just gonna leave an animal like that!"
"Any port in a storm, Potter. And you've just sent us out to sea."
"You're trying to protect me from someone?" Draco said, clearing his throat around the last of the slug-juice. "Or you're the only one who could pull off a decent impression of Blaise in order to get close to me?"
Draco froze. Scorpius crammed the last of his cone into his mouth and answered with ice cream dripping down his chin.
Ron pulled both ears; it was only a matter of time before they started steaming. "
"Was this before or after the raspberry jam incident?" George snickered.
"Draco, for Circe's sake,
"NO!" a chorus of voices - Draco, Pansy, Sirius, Remus, Ron, and Hermione - shouted him down, and he trudged on grumpily. He wouldn't have agreed to the blindness spell if he'd known how far they'd be walking. Draco led him by the hand and Harry was glad to be wearing gloves today, certain that his own palms were sweating. He was nervous. This was it. This would be his
Draco answered innocently.
A rude gesture that didn't require a translation was his only answer before Harry snatched his wand and stormed - stumbled - upstairs. After a long moment, Ron caught Tony's eye and jerked his head at the door. Auror Goldstein followed, looking as if he'd rather be anywhere else tonight than playing nanny to a drunk infant.
Minerva glares at the camera as if it’s to blame for this meeting.
"You mean you and Pansy would crumble if either of you had to open shop at eight in the morning..." Terry quipped, winking. "I do miss flying, but I'm not cut out for circus life. My luck, they'd hire me as their bearded lady!"
. He's safe and loved - cherished for who he is. Harry. With his eyes closed, he can pretend it's the sort of love that doesn't leave him feeling ill, or used. The room keeps spinning, upsetting his balance even through his eyelids, but he keeps them shut. It's only pretend, but sometimes, down here, pretend morphs into something else.
the overworked batter. His mouth was screeching on autopilot as he laid into him for tracking his every move rather than returning a bit of that blind trust he was demanding.
. Away from Sirius and Remus. He was about to fly the coop and, as excited as he was three days ago, he was rather more than queasy about it now.
An hour later he returned with McGonagall, windswept and breathless. She had listened with rapt attention to his frantic story before she tore into a drawer of personal belongings, retrieved an old photograph, and dragged Remus back out of Hogwarts. Sometimes she hardly seemed to need a cane, but it was at her side anyway, clunking away with every hurried step.
been one to underestimate. And I swear to you, I won't."
"My workshop…" he breathed, his chest swelling madly at the thought of spending his days here instead of Sirius's musty old shed. He could spend hours upon hours here and not get used to the way the sunlight was streaming in at that angle through the window. A carousel-stand in the middle held a few old prototypes of his broom designs and Harry tore off his gloves automatically, already itching to start a new project, if only just to
Denny holds him, pinned against his chest, squirming and choking and screaming and retching, and Harry doesn't end up eating in his hated loo-room that day after all.
"That's a loaded question," he muttered. "It's not that easy. Potter didn't fix things, he charged in blind and made a bigger mess. He only had an extraordinary amount of luck and Granger's brains to make everything work out in his favor. For the most part." James sent an inquiring gesture. "He was human. He made mistakes. People died, he couldn't save everyone."
"And how you insisted that I muck out the hippogriff stables every day because you're deathly afraid of them, but somehow all of them seemed to adore you? And your pockets?"
"Stop it, button," Monty muttered lowly so that no one but James could hear. James lifted his chin slightly but didn't respond to the mind-reading git. "We'll see 'em off an' then we'll go fer some ice cream."
"We're getting hands-on experience, how's that for exam prep?"
Silence while Dad presumably signed, then Monty said, albeit reluctantly:
"They're alive? Shit, turn it down!" Arthur covered his ears with his hands as the static became overwhelmingly loud. Alec hastily picked up the device and spun the volume knob several times, to no effect. He shook the contraption roughly and several pieces rattled about inside before he tried again. This time the volume returned to a reasonable level and the static faded as he lifted it into the air again.
"I remember sarcasm, you know," he retorted.
James nearly dropped the roast. Their voices were getting closer. They would pass right by the window to get to the bins at the end of the alley.
"Oh! Just the one room. Bedroom, I mean. And the bathroom, I'll definitely need one of those. A separate bathroom, not one that's, like, behind a screen or something." Harry pursed his lips and tried to recall any other loo that didn't come with an actual door. By the look on Malfoy's face, a screened-off toilet was not the norm. "I like, er, not the city. I mean, I do like the city, but not to live in, I don't think. I like it looking..." he gestured to the window and its beautiful rolling hills, "open, I guess. I just don't want to look at the side of a shopping center, you know?"
Harry opened his mouth to protest - he had plenty of
"No..." Draco abandoned the vials in favor of staring at Blaise in quiet shock. "Is...is he alright?"
wand on him so when Monty attacked, he was - "
“You’re exactly the same,” Sirius blurted in a raspy voice. Harry hummed in answer; he certainly didn’t feel the same but he’d yet to run across a mirror. “Exactly...exactly the same…”
Harry shoved past him and barreled up the stairs, near bursting with glee. He heard the others thundering up the stairs behind him but they were sturdy steps and didn't vibrate under the small stampede. At the very top was an ornate, gold-laced trapdoor, which lifted automatically as he approached. He climbed the last few steps up into his new home.
"Merlin's sack, sit
The boys cried out behind James as Draco screamed in agony and Narcissa grabbed another teacup from the table. It hit its mark and Tony hissed, clutching his eye. Released, Draco rolled onto his back, gasping for breath, and James hesitated. He couldn't go to him without leaving the boys vulnerable but Draco didn't have a chance from the floor.
"Watch yourself," Potter has the gall to say a moment later.
James asked, raising a brow and trying to maintain his best I Am A Business-Owner expression. His boy had skills. He would have to get used to negotiating commissions.
, felt wrong."
“Can you tell me about their mother?”
Silence reigned and Harry sipped his tea, longing for his toast, for his godfather, for a pickup game of Quidditch with Ron, Ginny, Charlie, and the twins.
"Said he could be yer twin, he did," Monty told Harry in a low voice, nodding in Remus's direction. "Went all pale when 'e saw yer picture in the shop, like he'd seen a ghost."
, and Draco blinks.
[scratched out ink] [scratched out ink]
“So will this be aired somewhere? How’s that work? Do you blur our faces, change the names?”
Monty had nodded at the time, like an idiot, thinking he would prove something to James. He would prove that Malfoy was up to no good, that James was flirting back, that Muggle music was better than the Wizarding Wireless rubbish that Ron kept carting in every week! He would prove to James that he knew a thing or two, even if magic wasn't his world. He would gain James's trust back, if he'd ever had it.
James had a feeling that Monty was tying his bad mood today into his radio silence all week. He wasn't freezing the man out, he was only trying to give him space to think on what he'd said. They would have time to talk it through after Christmas!
he incanted silently as yet another ruthless flash tore through his once pristine kitchen. He thought of the little wire stag that Alec had given to him that Christmas and then suddenly Prongs himself erupted from his wand, as bright as the lightning overhead.
"What makes you think that?"
do, to be honest with you."
tha' our James is yer Harry. It could be a coincidence."
The floor was a gorgeous yellow knotted pine, shining with finish, and the walls were whole logs that he could touch and dig his fingernails into. A matching log pillar stood in the middle of the single, magically expanded room, with a kitchen area to his left and a living space to his right, and he spotted a small loo through a door straight ahead. The kitchen cupboards were the same gleaming pine, topped with sleek green-marble counters and a matching island with a breakfast ledge. A simple but pretty collection of glass orbs on iron spokes made up a chandelier over the island.
#9 ½ Flint Ct.
James blanched, feeling something horrible grip him. Something like guilt.
Harry loves all of it, he tells him, “just not...that bit, so much.” Well, fine then. Draco can take care of himself, but what does Harry need from him if not his legendary efforts?
That line earned him some delighted chuckles, it always did.
James was horror-struck, his hands flying through the letters. Harry Potter's closest friends were coming to dinner
Remus hummed and returned to that morning’s paper, though his eyes didn’t track across the page because he was just using it as a prop. Harry stopped chewing and waited. The toast was turning soggy in his mouth but he couldn’t possibly swallow until Remus said whatever he had to say.
"Ohhh, c'mon, I want to meet your 'realty person' - "
Mr. James nodded but didn't say please, which was not polite, but sometimes it was even less polite to tell people they were not polite, so Scorpius let it go.
It had been a week. New Year's Eve was spent at Ron and Hermione's house. That was fun - George brought new tricks - but Arthur just wanted a normal Saturday night tonight. He wanted to make heaps of chocolates for Sunday's rush. He wanted Marge to bang on the shared kitchen wall when they played their music too loud. He would even endure Dad's ABBA albums, if that's what it took to set all this to rights.
. She hummed in delight at the cherry cordials. He set aside Scorpius's small tower of ridiculous candies and unwrapped the lumpy package with his name on it. He barked a laugh - of course!
The iridescent potion could cure any ailment, its pushers claimed; upon consumption, it would chemically transform into whatever potion one most needed. If someone was dead tired and in need of a good rest, they could drink Prism instead of Dreamless Sleep Potion. If someone suffered a broken bone and couldn't manage the spell to set it, they could just Vanish the bone and take Prism for an instant dose of Skele-Gro. A miracle solution.
Mr. Arthur Weasley
He'd rather be too hot than too cold.
Draco tugs at his collar, loosening his tie and undoing the top few buttons of his shirt. They can’t properly indulge if they’re not comfortable, he decides as he sheds his cloak. Potter watches him dazedly before following his lead. They sling their cloaks and outer robes over the bed and Draco’s breath catches. Potter looks positively edible with his tie loose, his glasses askew, and his hair even more mussed than usual.
"It's London," he said, mimicking Sirius's nonchalance. "There's always a pub within a three-minute walk."
“And she approved?” James felt his stomach bottom out.
"What happened to Harry James Potter?" Alec asked quietly. "You said he disappeared?"
"Er...hello," he offered with a little wave. "Looking for his, erm...person." He gestured in Scorpius's direction, though he was long gone. Should he go after him? He had just let an unsupervised child loose in a posh home, and until they found his...person, Harry would have to mind him, right? "Scorpius?!" he called, shoving through a couple blocking the hall.
Harry struggles to recall a time when Aunt Petunia reading Dudley a story to sleep was a point of jealousy for him. Ben is on his last nerve. Harry doesn't want to go to sleep, he just woke up, it's not his fault there's no clock in here!
"Look, mate," he sighed, pulling hard on his own ear in an effort to keep his temper in check. "I get that it takes time and you can't identify anyone yet." He didn't think forcing another round of Malfoy's memory-recovery potions down Harry's throat right there in the Blue Parlor would go over too well, however tempting it was. "But if we just use a pensieve - "
"Dinnae think we should keep on wit those, tae be honest," he said. James sent him a sharp look. "This was a close call. James was doin' jus' fine wit the Muggle stuff."
Draco kisses his stupid hair and tries not to wonder if it'll be the last time. It's a test he can't afford to fail but there's no bloody manual for this, despite his clever words. He holds Harry against his side and feels him relax marginally. He cups his arse – in for a knut, in for a galleon – and to his surprise, Harry doesn't pull away. He turns into it. Right... Right. Draco knows this part. Maybe he's not quite as lost as he thought, though the endgame has changed. When they snog, it's soft and warm, then a bit more warm, and just as Draco thinks he's found his rhythm, Harry pulls back.
While Ron and Hermione moved ahead to help load the luggage and the cat-carrier onto the train, Monty pulled the boys around for a gruff goodbye.
Harry doesn't know why Ben is Ben or why he has to fight Ben, but every time he shows his stupid face, Harry has to pick a fight. And Ben always fudging wins in one way or another.
"I - "
"Yes indeed."
(CW: Brief cigarette-smoking in this episode.)
"HA!" Monty barked, startling everyone but the boys and Harry. "So ye got yerself a stowaway!" Arthur smiled sheepishly and Harry rolled his eyes, looking so much like his old self.
“Your tea is shit.”
That morning marked their fifth session. The first two had brought up a daunting mess of childhood horrors to work through - Draco would never look at a cupboard the same way again - and the last two had been a hodgepodge of school hijinks. This latest one, against his better instincts and with Weasley and Goldstein standing by, Draco reluctantly asked James to meditate on his past experiences with pain and trauma.
Arthur nodded conspiratorially and Dad levitated the pot, picked up his cane, and together they creeped back upstairs.
[incoming text from: Monty]
"He's just so
Astoria faced forward on the settee, hunching her back in a brutish way that would have sent the rest of the Greengrass family into hysterics if they'd witnessed it. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her watch the fire as if she'd learned the art of divination from the Greek oracle. She may have done. Draco had no idea what she was up to these days.
Monty translated with a slightly sick expression: "You want us tae send our boys tae a school tha' tortures kids in detention?"
His eyes light up and a grin steals over his face, stretching those syrup-sticky lips and scrunching his nose. Their gazes meet again and Draco quirks a brow.
They were that same gorgeous yellow-pine as the floor, whole logs now instead of planks, and Harry could almost smell the wood.
When I hear that song, I always think of the end of my wedding reception, when my new husband's family encircled (trapped) us and sang (chanted) this song for an eternity with their Minnesota accents while we awkwardly bobbed around in the middle.  When I hear that song, I get really really really uncomfortable.
“You’ve made it perfectly cl - ”

After everyone had laughed themselves half-sick and had come back down to earth, James lifted his head from his hands and glared at Arty, the fucking traitor. His eldest smirked at him much too proudly, basking in the glow of his stage time. James couldn't stand it but Arty hadn't actually done anything wrong.
James moved to the sofa last night and had no intention of going back to bed with Monty anytime soon, no matter how many times the man apologized. He was apologizing for the wrong things anyway. He was sorry for screaming, for saying certain things, but not for...for whatever it was that happened yesterday. James had never seen Monty like that. It was
His face twisted again and Hermione stared at him in alarm. The situation went beyond caveman communication; James looked as hurt by this as Monty sounded on the phone.
James fumbled and dropped his colored pencil. It rolled off the table and hit the tile floor with a clatter. Arthur rolled his eyes and picked up his charcoal again, returning to his sketchbook as if he hadn't just dropped a nuclear bomb.
a Scottish accent is heard over the intercom.
"Call me Haz."
"I - well, I thought of it as… And you said, then, you wanted to put it all behind us, all that rot in our past, and be - " Draco cleared his throat, cheeks pinking like they had that brilliant, stupid night in October. "I gathered you regretted it, at least in part, since you didn't want to talk about it anymore after the fact. But I thought we'd… I thought we'd at least put the past behind us." It was a statement, but sounded a bit like a question.
“We’re not really up for discussing the advertisements that corporate decides to play - “
"It's safe now, ye heard what they said. Their war's over - "
(Perhaps they wouldn't ask that one, but Draco was certainly curious.)
Monty was stunned into stillness and James could feel his heart pounding wildly, his pulse fluttering in his neck. This...this felt like a big deal. Bigger than anything else he'd said to Monty. Almost without conscious thought, his hands went on signing:
James didn't have an answer to that. He sank into a chair at the table and nodded pointedly at the door, as if to say,
Harry opened the door of the Leaky and then promptly closed it again, relishing the thrill of casting his own
"So - so, Draco's
. So he found himself clutching a broomstick in the back garden of the Burrow, a crowd of mostly-ginger spectators watching and calling out advice to the three Charming men.
But then again, Charming had claimed last month (and seven times since) that it was an open invitation. Saturday night was boozy chocos night, open invitation, that's what he said, Draco still had the letter in his desk. He could put up with the superfluous Gryffindor garbage for company if it meant he could drag Blaise along and force the funk out of him with chocolates and booze. Depression, not funk. Merlin, he was starting to think like Charming.
"Haz," Malfoy agreed after a moment of hesitation, then waited. It took a long moment before Harry realized he still needed an answer.
Arthur shrugged, considering the cat carefully before shrugging again. James felt a smile tug at his lips. He and Aarti had spent the entire pregnancy debating names. He could definitely relate.
"I work in a variety of markets," Malfoy said pointedly, as if it meant something. Harry nodded dumbly. Malfoy looked heavenward as if praying for patience before angling his back towards the Muggles. With an odd little flourish, he used his pinky-finger to tap the card in Harry's hand twice. Harry's eyes widened with understanding, and he nodded again. He pocketed the seemingly non-magical card for now, until he could take his wand to it.
Potter bucks and their cocks touch for a fleeting moment, separated only by a thin layer of rapidly dampening fabric. Heat surges through him, through the room. He works his way down Potter's neck, pushing up the sopping shirt to run his hands over miles of bare skin. He can't taste what's sweat, what's spit. Potter bucks again. Merlin, he hopes it's precome that's soggying his pants.
Halloween was coming up and the shop was overflowing with witchcraft-themed decorations and treats. Actual vintage cauldrons, donated by the Weasleys, were full of cauldron-truffles, each with a surprise "potion" ganache filling. Pointed witch-hats were upturned and suspended from the ceiling, carrying chocolate snaps decorated with tiny witch faces. The pièce de résistance was an enormous spellbook mounted on a pedestal: large flat bars of dark chocolate made the covers, thin white chocolate snaps (individually wrapped for quick and easy sales) made up the pages. James seemed particularly inspired this Halloween.
He just couldn’t remember why.
James held his glass of water between his thighs while he signed cheekily:
"And I tend to - well, I have an emotional investment in my work, no matter the case, and I won't apologize for that!" she said fiercely, criminally harsh against the backdrop of fluffy pinks, golds, and blues. "But it
"They're the only Muggle shop that does it right," Draco insisted. It was a long-held secret that he preferred Muggle to magical chocolate. Or it had been, until his mother blabbed to Blaise and Blaise blabbed to everyone and their aunt. "Everything else comes through the post dry or melted. Don't know what the secret is, but theirs is never wanting."
"Right." Ron didn't look entirely satisfied, but he continued. "And anyway, Hermione, he shouldn't need Monty, I don't think that's right."
"You'll need to check in with Jesse before we leave."
of all places!
Corporate cuts back on employee hours, sparking a tentative alliance between foes.
Ten hours later, James saw the last pair of gabbing customers out with a friendly smile, waving apologetically at the pair of older women lingering on the sidewalk hopefully. He pointed at the sign - it was clear, after all. 7:00 sharp. His peculiar but always accurate watch - featuring planetary orbits, the phases of the moon, and one too many hands - read 7:01 when he flipped the sign over to Closed and locked the door.
Alec, still standing on his bed with the radio over his head, shared a surprised look with Arthur on the ground. They hadn't known that.
"You know what this is about, Potter," Nott said, adjusting his hold on the ever-fidgeting Arthur. "But we'll give you a choice. If we Obliviate you, your bloody Healer - " he spat in Draco's direction, " - will just undo it all again and we'll never get anywhere."
"Only cos you always win..."
Ice cut through his heart and he shoved Sirius in the chest, hard. The man nearly went down and Harry wondered when his godfather had become so
James was carrying on about Malfoy as well, but implying he might be sick or maybe he was just sick
on occasion, and they grew closer every day, but it seemed a frivolous waste of energy to pursue a relationship at the time. And then it all went to shit and Aarti wasn’t granted a future.
Barking back and forth, their words teeter just on the edge of cutting. Potter, returning the favor, crams a truffle against Draco’s mouth to break him off mid-rant. His teeth sink into firm dark chocolate, a flood of cherry ganache cutting across the bittersweet shell. The combination sings in his mouth and he hums his pleasure. Potter twitches…and grins like an idiot.
"A pity he doesn't remember them," he snarled.
Monty reached down and righted James's chair, squinting suspiciously at Alec, who was peaking at Minerva with obvious distrust.
, James explained excitedly. Hermione had a lot of brilliant ideas of what they could do next, ideas that could help Remus keep the Ministry off his back when it came to Teddy.
He nearly leaps off the mound of rapidly-warming fabric when Potter pokes his back with a firm finger through his shirt. There’s no discernable difference in the room’s temperature, but perhaps it just can’t get any hotter. The air is already shimmering. Potter removes his finger and Draco sees his hand come around to his arm. He hesitates, trembling, then places his finger on Draco’s bare arm.
"Er - well, Mum, right? Isn't that what all mummies are called?"
"Well, I can't think in soggy trousers," he declares. He throws off his shoes and trousers before he can lose his nerve and climbs to his socked feet. The room tilts and he crashes to the floor again, banging his knees. He swears loudly and Potter crawls over.
Monty.
The Ministry prosecutor was ruthless. Romilda Vane and Graham Montague never stood a chance. As he left Courtroom Number Ten, Ron felt a weight lift from his shoulders. This was it. They were doing it, he and Rachel. This case had started just months after the Battle of Hogwarts, it had simultaneously fueled and drained him during Auror training, and then it haunted him for over a decade.
"What program?" said Arthur.
"Harry…" His whisper shouldn't be heard over the old crone's screams, but it is. Green eyes meet grey. He shivers in the cold corridor, in his sweat-soaked undershirt with his wand sticking stupidly out of his pants, but he holds his ground against those eyes. Something changes in Potter's expression—a deep misery, an untouchable anguish Draco can't even begin to understand—and, with great effort, Potter peels his half-melted sneakers from the door.
He had to get this idea out of Monty's head.
"Right, so... I
"Right!" Too aggressive. Ron forced a deep breath. "Sorry, mate. I'm sure those can be scary and all, but we - "
Hermione blanched.
This had to be one of his stupider ideas. Why did he ever do anything in the name of science? It only led to half-melted robots and suicidal flights of fancy.
"James - " Monty's voice broke off in a tearful squeak.
"What?!" Harry stumbled slightly on the curb as he tried to look over his shoulder. "Why not? You need to - to learn. You need an education."
What could he say to that? What did it mean?
"Munchkin!" he cried. "Munchkin's next, I'll get it ready..." He started rooting through the precarious stack of game boxes at his elbow while Dad passed out the cards.
Not the most eloquent he'd ever been, but without his wand, it would have to do.
He didn't know what he expected from them when they came home to a life of Draco and Scorpius popping by nearly every day. Monty had integrated into their lives so slowly, as his co-worker first, then his only friend, then his only employee, and
"Enough bloody puns!" he growled. "This hasn't turned out to be one of our better anniversaries, Potter, let's just get it done - whatever game this is - so I can go home." Preferably
"That's how we communicate!"
"Well, what did you do with the corner shop's inventory?"
The witch bobs out of view of the window-slat and hurries to the side to avoid being scalded. Draco's hands dart out and his blistered fingers grasp the many folds of her robes. He wrenches back with all his might. Potter's crouched on all fours, just where he said he'd be, and the witch cries out as she stumbles over his back toward Draco. He side-steps and uses her falling momentum to send her flying onto the bed.
"Oh! I know you!" Harry declared suddenly as the pieces clicked into place. Terry Higgs raised a brow and Harry went on, careful to keep his own identity foggy. "You were Seeker, right? The year before Draco took over?"
Scorpius straightened in his seat and recited: “This kitchen comes with all-new stainless steel appliances, and check out that gorgeous backsplash!” Malfoy patted his blond head and then turned to Harry, who failed to hide his glee in time.
"Yer no' sending that tae him," Monty growled.
James closed his eyes and took a great, shuddering, dramatic breath. Monty's stomach hurt; he caused this. He was trying to make things stronger between them. If James could only accept how much Monty had already done for him, if he could put aside his pride... But James was pale and dinner was thoroughly burned and Monty was still waiting for an answer. He was finished.
"Yes, you're always forgetting things," he sniffed. James thought he heard,
Arthur dragged his feet while Alec hurried ahead of him up the stairs, down the hall, and into the largest bedroom. Twin beds, ironically mismatched, were nestled against opposite walls. At the end of Alec's bed was a Franken-desk he had put together from two tables and an old dresser: one surface was horizontal and sat higher than a normal desk - he preferred to sit on a high stool - and the other surface was leaning between the horizontal piece and the wall, rigged to pull out at various angles when needed. Bungee-cords held large drafting papers in place on the angled surface, but he kept it pushed up close to the wall for now. Climbing up onto the tall, padded stool, he began rooting around in the dresser-drawers tucked under the table.
It was as he was bending over the oven to retrieve the roast that he heard little old Marge's voice through the window.
"But - but..." Draco was far more drunk than James. He was rather handsy, too. Smiling stupidly, James let Draco reach across the table to latch onto both of his wrists. It felt nice. His long pale fingers were strong but soft. He thought those nimble fingers could have the potential to do some brilliant work in the proper setting.
"Entertain the idea fer
Kim, his Mind Healer, was kind and funny and far too wise for her age. She was hardly older than him, after all. He never felt like she was patronizing him. In fact, she was the only one nowadays who made him feel like he was...well, if not right, then at least capable of arriving at what was right.
“Attention, employees. Attention, employees. Mr. Cedric Diggory, please report to Warehouse Sector B, as per Bellabitch’s request. Repeat, Mr. Cedric Diggory, please get your pert little arse down to Warehouse Sector B - as in Basilisk - as per Bellatrix’s request.

Hermione handed him both letters. They had been dropped off at different times of the day by the same owl - Lucy or Anne or Donna or Black Widow, whatever the poor thing's name was - but were written from two different idiots.
The match is lit and the kindling catches. Before long, they have a roaring fire:
was the one to trust implicitly. Nevermind the fact that he'd just mentioned a blond assailant in his fragmented memory of the incident…
“I told him about Rolanda’s position opening up - “
James had always known that Monty was a nurturer and, yes, a touch emotional. These traits weren't faults, and James felt awful for rejecting such an inherent part of the man. But he felt smothered and helpless in the wake of Monty's constant hovering. He considered getting him a needy pet, perhaps a small dog with intestinal issues, to keep him busy, but thought that might be a bit too on the nose. And James could use a bit of help sometimes, he reminded himself. He should be grateful to have someone who tried to carry him down the stairs like a twat. He wouldn't have complained ten years ago when he was walking ten blocks every day to get to the grocery.
"Come on!" he says, as if Draco didn't just nearly murder him. On a griddle-bed. In a giant oven.
Draco's heart spasmed and he pressed a hand to his chest.
, he said shortly.
"What is it about Draco that you like, Harry?" she pressed, ever so gently. He sent her a knowing look, but indulged her anyway.
There. Maybe Arthur's fear of felines would be the next topic of discussion and humiliation. He could tell stories too!
, it's fine."
"When was the last time you orgasmed, Harry?"
"Like now." Draco nods. "And that's why you're so scrawny, I suppose? You've made a habit of skiving class and getting spectacularly lost?"
That jaw clenches again. Potter shrugs, looking painfully rigid. Like an out-of-body experience, Draco watches himself reach forward—his hand trembles before it brushes against Potter's jaw, scratching lightly against the scruff. The tension in the jaw eases. Potter swallows. Draco feels stupid as soon as he sees his pale pink hand on Potter's dark brown skin—he doesn't know what his body is trying to play at, throwing limbs on people’s faces like a twat—but then Potter clasps his own hand over Draco's and holds him there.
Only a spectacular idiot would approach centaurs. They're not younglings anymore and Firenze—a traitor to his own kind—isn't likely to come to their rescue if they're caught. Draco follows Potter's lead and they creep away through the undergrowth.
Monty repeated attentively.
"What's all that then?" he grunted, pointing at the series of white dots. Nevermind the perfectly tempered chocolate on every single shining truffle, which was bloody difficult to do, thank you...
smile at the same time, the picture of calm, cool, and collected, while scanning the wide selection of hard liquors on the back shelves. Was this why people went out drinking? To watch their...well, their realtors look all sharp and focused and slightly bored but in a suave way, like he had had a thousand nights more interesting than this -
"I met one yesterday," he explained, blunt as ever. He seemed to have forgotten how to soften his words. "I'm twenty-eight. Twenty-

"Brick oven," he insists. "Like a giant brick oven. Iron door, iron furnishings—what sort of guest room doesn't have a doorknob?"
Charming nodded again. Gibbs opened his stupid mouth.
“A surprise, then?”
this week." Draco raises his eyebrows meaningfully. Harry waits for more, but nothing comes. He blinks rapidly, appearing to scramble for something to say.
. He felt at home with that name - he'd always liked it, ever since he spotted it on the long list of names at the hospital. It was yet another big deal to hear
"I told you," Ron muttered to her, though James could clearly hear. "Last Saturday night, he kept doing everything for him, hardly let him out of the chair. It was barmy."
Footsteps thundered down the stairs behind them and soon they were joined at the table by the twins. Monty sat at Harry's side, Arthur next to Monty, and Alec took the remaining seat next to McGonagall. The Thing clunked ominously at the head of the table.
"Haz...?"
As if he'd heard his mental quip, James cocked his head and raised his brows mockingly.
“Hello, there…”
"Tha' was a good birthday," he remembered fondly.
"You've certainly made all sorts of observations!" Malfoy said, sounding a bit more shrill now. James leaned forward, raising his brows in mock-interest. "The difference is, I bother to
"What are you looking for in a home, Mr. Blue?"
"Ah, tha's a good story," he began. "Ye wan' the long version or the short one?"
"Am sorry..." Monty said. It sounded as if he was pressing his face right up against the wood of the door. "A saw the shop, it looks… Jaybird, it looks incredible. Am sorry, a jus' - a jus' worry about ye. Dinnae wan' ye tae be taken advantage of. Doctors aren' s'posed tae get close tae their patients like that fer a reason, ye know, it's no' right."
"Bros will come and go, you know, but this one's a keeper."
"And spend all afternoon reviewing security footage with Trelawney?" Severus scoffs. "I think not."
"Damn," was all Sirius managed.
"You can afford th- "
“Alright, pup?”
Blaise said nothing. Draco handed him a dropper. Together, they finished testing the rest of the shipment in silence.
"Carry me!" he demanded, and Harry found himself complying. He was too big to carry in his arms, but with some fumbling, he got the boy settled on his back with his legs gripping his waist and his arms wrapped uncomfortably around his neck.
"Okay..." It seemed like that would be enough to keep him out of trouble, but sometimes words decided to spill out of Scorpius's mouth without consulting him first: "Only - you're not being very mannerly, Mr. James. Manners matter."
They all slept on a makeshift pallet on the floor, like a nest of animals. The boys crowded in on Draco's side, keeping Scorpius between them. James was left on the end, twitching and puttering about like an idiot, until Draco grabbed his arm and wrapped it around his own waist decisively.
"You little shit!" he let slip in whispered horror, cheeks burning. Arthur snorted, sounding bizarrely like Weasley, before kicking Draco's shoe lightly and starting the game again.
Draco takes pride in making Harry happy.
The deadpan delivery, the hot breath tickling his ear, the outrageousness of finding a candy cottage in the middle of the Forbidden Forest after skiving class with Harry Potter—all of it builds up in Draco's chest and bubbles out of him in a cascading waterfall of snorts and giggles.
"Not so much anymore," he answered. "Toast, soup - whatever's easy." Sometime over the past decade or so, the memories of slaving over the hob at Privet Drive faded into a vague concept.
“You said I look better now?”
A few knowing titters from the spectators and Monty’s surprised but ever-supportive whoop from the sidelines. Ginny showed them how to properly mount the broom. Arthur was already floating but she called him back down and explained the importance of a proper kick-off. Alec’s palms were sweating as he gripped
, Draco can hear his mother saying in his head. One of those things they have to talk about.
now and since when did Hermione want to be an auror anyway? None of them knew, none of them understood -
"The report claims that your son recognized you were experiencing a flashback, which provoked you to attack an Auror." Charming nodded again, glaring at the file.
he asked, knowing it would be shot down.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco can see Potter glance over at him, but he doesn't look down.
The other two walls were more homely; less for business, more for family. A heavy wooden table, looking centuries old and impossible to move, jutted out from the wall on the right, some half-dozen mismatched wooden chairs surrounding it. Books and comics were stacked up neatly on the end that was nestled against the wall, and the strangest metallic figure stood at the head of the table:
“Mr. Malfoy will be overwhelmed with buckets and bins of new inventory this week,” Albus says cheerfully. “I’m confident that young Harry will handle this mission with great aplomb.”
Dad pushed his fingers under his glasses to rub at his eyes. He was pale and hadn't touched his own waffles. Alec thought he looked a bit fragile, if it were possible for a human to look that way. Like the icicles on the awning outside the shop, the little ones that chipped off with a little
he said sternly.
Something about that hospital had screamed the name Arthur to him. And he could call him Arty, like a little Aarti Junior. It was perfect.
“Now’s not the time for your ego,” Draco hisses, still staring at his mangled shins. The threat of the cramp lingers in his thigh, as if biding its time. He’s thoroughly miserable and not in the mood for Potter’s clumsy innuendos.
"We need to leave," Potter mutters, bending over Draco's shoulder from behind the chair. His hot breath fills the shell of his ear and Draco has to fight to steady his heart. He focuses his attention on the arm of the chair. It’s quality leather, soft and well tended, but stained. Or was the hide stained before it was tanned? Actually, it looks like a design, worn away by years of wear…
The Thing next to Remus suddenly whirred back to life and he startled when its copper-coil eyes began glowing. Alec gave a cry of triumph and pointed across the table, his fathers' conversation forgotten.
he said instead of all that.
feelings were on the line. Monty's feelings weren't even worth a discussion.
he spluttered, reaching out with the sleeve of his ruined jumper to wipe Harry's chin.
"Fascinating," Draco said, turning the mobile over in his hands as Monty's garbled message played on speaker for the third time. "A clever little device, but it doesn't seem to work very well. Floo's still better by a long shot."
“Fine,” he huffs, relinquishing Potter’s arm and stalking around the bed to what he thinks might be an exterior wall, or near enough to it. “I’ll do it myself.” He flicks his wand at the wall in a complicated pattern and draws a square in the bricks. His incantation is flawless, the wand movements clean and precise, but the magic doesn’t…go. His wand doesn’t summon the magic from within him, doesn’t propel it into the wall. It just…doesn’t.
?" she laughed. "Must be all that chocolate..."
"Mrs. Weasley gave us that," Monty answered gruffly, gesturing to the quilt as Dad levitated their trunks down the hall.
"Not him." Arthur thrust a stack of incriminating letters at Alec. "Look at all this! Whatever he's done, he's tryin' tae apologize but Dad's bein' a right cunt!" He was seething. This was Monty all over again. Dad and his blasted pride getting in the way of things,

could do such a thing! We're far too delicate."
Arthur returned after just a few minutes, looking pale.
Harry looked well and truly pitiful, but, ever the Gryffindor, he was still trying to salvage the moment:
"I asked for anything but Slytherin, so the Hat sent me to other side of the Great Hall."
"House?"
Monty insisted.
His feet seemed to carry him automatically and he found himself hobbling around the settee in a wide arc so he stood between the intruders and the doorway. He wouldn't have the Killing Curse come anywhere close to his family. Tony moved at once to stand directly behind him, blocking his escape. But he wasn't trying to escape. He wouldn't run this time.
"Well, well, well," Harry whispered, staring at him in awe. "Look who's making puns now!"
"You let the mystery of my attack rest," he pointed out. No one actually seemed to care that he was ambushed in his own office. No Cruciatus, no matter. Abbott, their supervisors, the hospital board, the Aurors - no one really seemed to mind what he had gone through after he gave his statement and his memorial evidence. Weasel upped the security around Charming's shop and said they would
A bookcase next to a little writing table was crammed full of books. Four teeming shelves of parenting books, from infant-care to planning for university. An entire row of Agatha Christie caught his eye, then two shelves of recipes, notebooks, and business manuals, and below that, a series of comic books in neat, vertical stacks on the bottom shelf.
James lifted his fingers higher, repeating the sign slowly.
He tries screaming into the tiny, solitary vent mounted up on the wall by the ceiling. It just goes into his captor's room, though. And he knows that, but he is still learning what sounds meant the man is "home" and what sounds are typical of the bunker's rudimentary mechanical systems. He's hoping, if he's loud enough, that his voice will carry through the room and up to the surface somehow. It doesn't. Even if it does, no one will be near the little clearing where the trap door is located.
Honestly, the way he looked at him, like
"Your friend is dead," Draco spat.
His knuckles went white and he hefted himself up on the first rung, but couldn't get his legs to keep going. So he rocked back, experimenting with tossing his weight forward and back, letting go and catching himself.

and for Viktor's football team/position! (Again, his position isn't mentioned here...but he's a striker, okay? There. Mentioned. No idea what it means, but it's been mentioned now.)
Potter opening and closing his mouth, speechless. It only took nineteen years, but Draco had finally done the impossible. He had shut Potter up.
"What's 'prism'?" Alec muttered, but Draco heard:
, he said, summoning patience from the depths of his soul.
"I've worked out a whole business model fer us," Monty said delicately but obviously still brimming with excitement.
"Are you talking about Draco or a nougat?"
he offered as he began to extricate himself from the twisted blankets.
James nodded, glad to be back on a topic that wasn’t about his mistakes. Well, not entirely.
Monty signed, shrugging without a care. James ground his teeth together.
For a while, at least.
They had a bit of a row at the jukebox at some point and things got rather heated before a tiny woman with long silver hair broke it up and put on her song instead. Draco and Harry returned to their seats, content at least to be losers together if it meant the other didn't win. Since when did Draco Malfoy know anything about Muggle music anyway?
“Yours, you berk, but that doesn’t mean Remus is wrong.” He had that pitying look on his face again, the hypocrite. Both of them were imprisoned for over a decade and Sirius had the gall to
"I'm a stocker. Er - stocker, like I stock shelves. I don't
, he said.
"I was so angry..." Draco swallowed thickly, not looking up from James's hands. "You stalked me all bloody year and then you - you saw - "
James tried to push him back out of sight but Tony stalked over and snatched Arthur's collar, dragging him forward. James latched onto his oldest boy, using his other hand to push away the traitor, but Tony suddenly drove him back against his bad hip and sent him sprawling to the floor, wheezing in pain, with Alec beneath him.
right.
Monty wasn't happy. He wasn't a fine actor either so James knew he wasn't happy, which meant James was tense and ready to bark, which meant Monty was tense and ready to bite.
“Oi, you can’t just - ”
Lupin and McGonagall took up their usual seats across from James and Monty. Ron Weasley-Granger and Hermione Granger-Weasley sat to McGonagall's right. Molly and Arthur Weasley - Ron's parents - chose to sit at James's side. (James tried very hard not to wonder if he had subconsciously named his own son after the balding stranger next to him.) Next to Lupin was his thirteen-year-old son, Teddy. Teddy sported fashionable turquoise hair that Arty was eyeing with envy. Not what he would have expected for the child of Remus Lupin, but he quite liked the boy.
Green eyes met his and Draco felt his breath leave him, not for the first time.
"You don't have a voice box at all?" Ron asked. That wasn't in the file.
"The Weasleys are all over this store. They sort of took Harry in, during school. His first family died in a car accident, you see, and his second family was no good at all. But his third family is
A steady thumping sound started on the floor above, in time with Sirius's favorite Muggle record. As fun as it seemed to dance around with his godfather without a care in the world, experience told him that Sirius would likely be in his skivvies right now.
The inside of the house was...well, dank. Harry supposed that couldn't be helped out here in the barely-tamed wilds of wherever they were, in this drizzly weather. The surrounding trees - tall and spindly - cast much of the shack in shadow and Harry thought the idea of a sunroom would only make things just-this-side-of-bearable for whatever poor soul ended up here.

From the ground, Potter pulls his own wand out his pants and, without looking, shoots an
Where...was he?
James reared back, eyes wide. Monty stood by what he'd said. The man was being stubborn, was throwing away his family for a blond cock and then turning it around on Monty, as if the man hadn't done enough to keep them going through the years -
James said nothing.
What Monty was suggesting was massive: it could be bigger than their relationship, bigger than their entire history as lovers, friends, co-workers. It was asking for another ten years, or twenty, or maybe even a life-time, or to end in disaster. James wasn't prepared for that kind of investment. He had spent the last eleven years dealing with the last life-blow that tied him down to an anchor. For the first time in living memory, James was enjoying his freedom, his independence; he couldn't sign himself up for the next anchor.
“I suffered just the one incident and, before you ask, Blaise has been cleared of all suspicion by your little Auror friends. He was drugged to sleep in his office.”
spell, which was a game changer as a parent.
James nodded. They said nothing. Draco wasn’t sure if they had ever gone so long in each other's presence without speaking.
“Here,” she says, thrusting it in Pansy's face and lifting her chin in defiance of what just happened. “In case you’ve read all of Belrose, I thought you might like Adora Conti’s med school collection. This one’s called Defibrill My Heart.” On the floor, Pansy reaches for the book with both hands, making sure to brush against Hermione’s fingers. She accepts the book blindly, staring up at Hermione with an adoring expression.
"Okay?" he asked, not entirely believing it. James nodded resolutely before climbing to his feet, more slowly this time.
He retreated downstairs, leaving Monty to take the bed tonight.
Why was James doing this to him? Was he not enough? He was human, he made mistakes, and yes, he was prone to jealousy…but this went beyond his control. There was
Silence fell and Tony shifted where he stood, fiddling with the series of gold snaps on the front of his Auror robe. Ron bit his tongue to keep himself from saying what Harry really looked like that day on the Hogwarts Express: wide-eyed and gasping, throwing open doors like a madman. They were right to respond with caution; Ron's only fault with his team was that two of the three were so easily disarmed.
An hour later, Hermione joined him in the sitting room and accepted a cup of tea from Monty, who sat next to James. He felt a mug of tea pressed into his own hands and he simply set it on the coffee table in front of him. Monty wrapped an arm around his shoulders.
"It certainly looks like your father," Remus admitted, uncertain how to reply…. He
"Invited you into my home, sedated my dear father, opened my kitchen to you - "
He watched the man who was once his best friend limp back into the kitchen, hand guiding his young-but-far-too-old son, Arthur.
“You can find anatomical references in Medicine.”
Harry signed and Monty said: "S'not like he thought o' the name himself. They gave 'im a list'a common male names an' he just chose one."
he asked, pulling up the hood to cover his own hair and eyes with a cheeky grin.
Rachel was close to Tony, though she kept a stiff - almost steel - upper lip. Her dark hair was pulled back in a neat braid and her robes were recently pressed. She, like Tony, always made an effort to be presentable. But her eyes were sad, her voice was hoarse, and she was prone to snap at him for the silliest things.
"Da', no!" Alec demanded, like he was speaking to a dog. "Bloody h - can you imagine what the others will think if they see you
"What the fuck was that?!" Arthur squeaked, looking between James and the Aurors.
“Which leg?” He was out of his element here. He’d never dealt with children before...he estimated this one at about, what, seven years old? Nine? Maybe six? He was sobbing into the grass, tears and dirt all over his bright pink face.

He's not sure how long it is before he swings the other way -
"It is ma business!" he shot back. "Yer tellin' me, what, you cannae accept apologies anymore? Whatever he did, he's clearly sorry for it!"
They managed to get lost on the way back to the street that hosted both the office and, more importantly, the Leaky Cauldron's floo. Or maybe they weren't lost...maybe Draco was simply fed up with stumbling around and scuffing up his dumb stupid poncy loafers. Somewhere between watching the streetlights pass through the window of a cab, as if in a trance, and waking up at Blupin Frottage, something happened that was decidedly less warm-and-fuzzy and more cold-sweat-and-fuzzy.
was probably a head shrink's codeword for
A third round of horrible silence.
There, that shuts him up. Draco obstinately ignores the trickle of blood or sweat that runs down the side of his face in favor of smirking triumphantly up at Potter.
But Charming and Potter
Four hours later, it was past three in the morning and he was beginning to sweat through his t-shirt and joggers. But the shop was completely transformed. He even pulled apart a supply pallet in the alley to make a few signs. Years ago, he had stowed a load of renovating materials in the cupboard under the stairs, including sandpaper and paint, and the signs didn't look half-bad.
And exactly how quickly was possible? Alec wondered. He leaned forward experimentally and tried valiantly not to piss himself when the broom began moving. Arthur held a hand on Ron’s broom and the man guided him through the air a bit faster than Alec was going; they were turning, rising, and falling at random. Alec tentatively pulled on his right hand and wobbled over in that direction, nearly upsetting his balance. He resettled himself and watched as his dad flew by him confidently. He watched carefully...there!
It was a combination of things that set him off.
Potter clamps his hot, meaty palm over Draco's mouth again and it takes all his willpower not to bite him. He shoves him off, scowling, but Potter's eyes have gone bright and he seems not to notice. He nods dumbly over Draco's shoulder, and Draco turns to look.
He exhaled in a whoosh as he joined Draco and Scorpius at an outdoor table. Draco was eyeing him oddly as they ate dessert before lunch - anything goes in the above-ground world, apparently - but didn't ask.
"I'm starting the last round day after tomorrow," Harry said with a grimace. "Healer Wilkerson says I'm already of age, physically speaking."
"You're lying.
“Anything?”
"I found the letter three days before it 'arrived.'"
"Why. Am I. Here." He saw Harry's face fall but he couldn't care less. He was near seething at this point. Nine hours of being whisked away all over the world by clumsy riddles and questionably attained Portkeys! He was not in the mood for any more games.
“The Weasleys are great. Sort of took me in after I met Ron at school. Didn’t have to spend summers with the Durs - er, with my relatives. Are you - you’re a documentary company, right?”
11:30am
"Oh ye jus' been sulking a bit since Malfoy called off yer appointments. He said yer fine after all, an' a agree. Think yer just bored. Thought ye might be gettin' too attached tae the git, if ye ask me..."
"But, don't you want to go to school with other people? Kids your age?"
He knew he was being a bit reckless with these safety precautions, just as Harry had been before this mess. He knew it was probably prudent to have an Auror around, however annoying it was to have a nanny forced on him every hour of the day. He knew he should have pulled his wand without prompting, probably even followed Rachel out to investigate the noise in case she needed backup, but his old mulish attitude was hard to kill.
The ward was painfully silent now. All he wanted for his first day of freedom was to watch his window in peace, and now he was in a stand-off. Remus stepped forward, hands clasped in front of him in that naturally professorial way he had.
. He could use some time to himself after today. A hot bath would be nice. Banishing the water straight onto Harry's side of the bed would be even better.

Ron flushed red and flicked his wand, sending the old charred envelop zipping down the hall to finally rest in the Evidence storage room. A few lazy sparks still fell from its edges as it disappeared down the hall. Even weeks later, Ron could hardly stand to imagine what sort of scene he would have discovered if Rachel hadn't been in that kitchen with Harry. A blank scroll, just regular office parchment, soaked in a powerful Sparking Potion. As it dried, the potion activated. Given a few more minutes, the lightning would have burned through the parchment. But they were able to douse it before that could happen, recovering just enough singed parchment to run several dozen tests.
laugh, turning his cheeks even pinker.
Monty bit down on his tongue. He wasn't going to play that game.
Now it is, "Got it, Lenny."
The Spice Girls make an appearance, the pining begins, and the Golden Git of Gryffindor makes a comeback.
"Why?" This didn't sound right - unless James had lost his temper. Yes, and then he was too proud to fix it, leaving it to his boys to call in the troops. Well. Hermione would just have to fix things for the idiot, as per usual.
"And you
"Er..." Arthur said, staring up at him warily. "D'ye need some water or somethin'?"
“I just think everyone should be treated fairly,” sighs Cedric. “She’s always had it out for him and nothing ever gets done about it. Maybe if it’s documented, things will change.”
Draco sneered. "He always got his fill. We civilians have to carve out our own reputations."
"Which one?"
“Your back…” The smell is nauseating.
this place, I tell you, Voldecorp would fall apart without the Weasleys!”
The acrid stench of burning reached his nose and he panicked for a moment, lifting the glass bowl to peer underneath for any signs of damage. None. He had a batch of chestnuts roasting in the oven, but as he poked through them with a spat, he couldn't find any char at all. The fudge was cooling in the fridge. So what was burning?
“Auror Weasley,” Tony said in a quiet tone that still carried over to the others. “I don’t know how much of his statement we can take into consideration if - “
"Got a better idea, Malfoy?" Potter growls. His leg quakes more and more the longer he remains crouched.
The house is entirely based on my childhood neighbor. (I actually went back home in October and snagged the photo for this story, since my only other pictures are at least ten years old.) My neighbor is Extra and he used a crane to place this cabin (which he built) on top of an old silo as a play-house for his little granddaughter. She's grown now, but we used to wave at her from her porch! I've never been inside, but I sort of don't want to...imagining the interior is so much more fun!!
“Just forget about the fucking door, Potter—”
he said suddenly with a wild, helpless expression.
No. He was not thinking of Monty now. This was different. A new, different...thing that he had with Draco. They hadn't put a label on it yet, but it was definitely...a thing.
“Corporate likes you, but let’s face it, your department’s new. It could easily be reabsorbed back into Beauty.”
“Yeah,” Pansy answers in a slightly breathless voice, pulling her bottom lip between her teeth. The black cherry shade of her lipstick remains perfectly undisturbed. “And I’ve come...to you.” She lifts a brow suggestively, deploying a dangerous little smirk. Hermione remains oblivious as she flips back a page, looking through the notes.
Draco's day was worse.
“No,” she says through gritted teeth. “No, that’s all. Thank you, Hermione.”
Potter whirls around to watch the witch in alarm. He probably thinks Draco spotted a burly arm or a hairy leg in the concoction, the stupid tit, but it's not quite as dramatic as cannibalism. It's simply…not done, cooking in a cauldron. Cooking
Ron had explained about the magical energy syphoning that had led to all of this. He felt a flare of anger that a bloody potions ring was holding his and his family's lives in flux. He could hear Snape laughing from the grave.
"Racists spout the same dragonshit, it's all bollocks! Hagrid's not any more dangerous than I am, but all that people like you ever see is a dangerous half-breed or a brown man that's up to no good—just because we look a certain way!"
The crying subsided into sniffles and Harry smirked when the boy used his collar as a handkerchief, smearing snot and tears into it. Better than crying and attracting all sorts of strange stares from passersby, anyway.
“Lupin Cottage.”
“Is this romantic, Draco?” Blaise asked too casually as he reached the landing. Draco shoved him hard in the back because he didn’t have a knife to return the favor.
"This is more than a - " Monty broke off with a snarl and James waited for him to finish.
Did Monty even grasp what it took to
) for making me finally finish this episode that's been sitting in my WIP folder for far too long. And oodles of thanks to Rose (
So why ask me then?" he said weakly, gasping and shaking and trying very hard not to cry.
“Who let a pair of Hawaiian shirts within a mile of Men's?” Blaise Z. snaps. Ginny peeks over her shoulder at him, smothering a grin.
“You’re a bitch,” he decided, packing up what remained of his chocolates and
"Yes, ma'am?"
Who was James Charming?
his end... If Ben doesn't come back, if he's been hit by a car or cut up in an alley or gored by a great big stag with a striking resemblance to Prongs, Harry will just rot here, finally and thoroughly forgotten.
Tony was behind him. Nott was before him, raising his wand for
"See what?" McGonagall pressed while raising a placating hand in Monty's direction.
Draco quirked a brow. "I'll wager the first round that it'll take at least
“A what?” Sirius grunted miserably as he set upon his tea like a starving beast. His long hair was in disarray, eyes puffy with sleep, kimono-style robe barely tied and revealing far too much. Harry’s face went hot and he kept his eyes firmly fixed on his toast.
Dad turned on him, eyes blazing.
Monty and James sat through round after round of questioning while a team of Healers and potioneers were questioned down the hall. A single ingredient had been substituted in James's pain potions - powdered graphorn horn in place of fluxweed - but the switch was not indicated on the label. It was not likely to be a mistake, given the cost of graphorn horn. The result was a potion that looked and acted exactly as the original supply of pain potions that James had received from St. Mungo's...except, if James were to cut himself, the wound wouldn't stop bleeding until he received a magical antidote.
Sirius was standing in front of him now, shoulders curled in on himself in a humble, pleading way that didn't fit the man.
Charming nodded and Granger gasped loudly. Draco shook his head minutely at her.
"We left him right there in the interrogation room, soon as we had your location."
Surely all those memory potions were just messing with his head, or the wine really was distorting his hearing.
It was an old tradition of theirs but still good. Better than going to bed, anyway. Dad (very carefully) colored his old sketches while he worked on new ones. Sometimes Alec joined them, sometimes he didn't. He couldn't remember when it had started exactly - he had vague memories of Dad coloring with them in their coloring books on the fold-out card table in their studio flat, using wax crayons and fat markers.
"Muggles."
"It's not going anywhere," Robards sighed. "Nott said he'd give us names. Says it's far-reaching. There's plenty of work left to do."
"Fiancé!" he said, unable to articulate a response worthy of this momentous occasion. A Malfoy and a Potter,
The wind battering against his eardrums was music, the early morning air smelled delicious, the pinkening clouds against the dimmest blue of a fading night was unspeakably beautiful, and the chill of it all on his back and face and arms, ruffling up into his sleeves, was nothing short of rapture.
"I'll alert Nott," his father announced agreeably. "Post-haste."
"Greg?" Draco straightened up from his stooped position. "For what?" Gregory Goyle was a bit of a brute in their school days under Draco's command, but left to his own devices, he wouldn't hurt a fly. He preferred to focus on his music. What trouble could he have possibly gotten into while still living with his mumsy?
" Potter arches his back encouragingly when Draco's teeth taunt his waistband. "F-fuck!" he gasps, peeking down. Draco plucks the waistband again. It slips out from between his teeth and bottom lip to snap against the v-shape over Potter's groin. His eyes are blazing for all the right reasons now, his shirt is scrunched up in his armpits and his chest is heaving. The locked door might as well be miles away.
“I’ve been thinking of getting an owl,” Harry lied, starting to feel desperate. He liked his life now. No complaints. None. Everything was fine the way it was, why should it have to change? Why should he have to endure the stares and whispers to put Remus at ease over an imagined issue? “I could get a penpal.”
It all went down in such rapid succession that James didn't have time to comprehend the words. His own wand went from translating to zipping into Tony's outstretched hand. He leapt to his feet just as Draco managed to hit his father with a stunning spell, before his wand was taken as well. Narcissa chose to stand and throw her cup of scalding tea over the boys' heads at the intruders, who dodged it and collected her wand in turn. The boys were the last to be disarmed as they jumped up to face the two remaining figures in the doorway.
She could only guess how badly she had betrayed Harry's trust after his breakup. He didn't take kindly to her talking to Monty privately on the phone, not at all. He'd always been sensitive to people talking about him behind his back, and with Monty's overall manipulation... Well, she was perfectly contrite about it now, but the damage was done. She shouldn't have trusted Monty's feelings over Harry's tendency to brood, not for a second. She should have left well enough alone.
"A real dragon?" Scorpius gasped. "But, you love dragons! His name means dragon, you know," he told their guest. "He's got dragons on his bed."
Irma sniffs in frank disapproval and Hermione frowns, biting her lip. Carefully, as if it might bite her, she pulls the bookmark out of the little gift box and tucks it into her large notebook. Pensively, she runs a finger over the edge that sticks out, a frown still pulling on her lips.
“The oven, you idiot!”
too good to be true, because then Lucius Malfoy returned with Theodore Nott and Anthony Goldstein in tow.
"He put my tools in Jell-O again!" Draco huffs, pulling a plate of bright yellow gelatin out of the drawer and dropping it to the counter. Inside, a ring sizer and a pair of needle-nose pliers are clearly visible. "It's the third time!"
"Where's the list of everyone who was there that night?" Ron asked, shuffling through the miles of parchment spread out on the conference room table. Rachel flicked her wand and a single scroll flew over to the wall. Another flick and she attached it there with a sticking charm. "Could've just handed it to me..." he muttered, stepping over to examine the list.
"James...what the fuck are ye playin' at?"
Monty sent him a look and he sighed.
A unicorn and her foal are drinking from a brook, not even a quarter length of a Quidditch pitch away from them. Draco's fingers surge with renewed feeling while his legs go inexplicably numb. The mother and foal are
"No."
Monty ate dinner in stony silence, watching James's hands as he tried to make conversation but only ever responding with noncommittal grunts and shrugs. It was out of character, even for an unhappy Monty.
"Then at least carry wizarding money so you can call the Knight Bus," Remus put in. Ron gestured between him and Hermione as if they held all the wisdom in the world.
"Phantom pain," Malfoy said in that official Healer way he had. "You can read up on it if you'd like, it's fairly common. More so with amputees but you've always been exceptional." Malfoy blanched and rushed to say, "The exception to every rule, I mean. The odd one. Freakish, if you will."
be friends, if James tried harder. Inviting someone to Quidditch wasn't enough, of course. Between his and Monty's long-term relationship and Harry Potter's old crowd, James Charming had clearly forgotten how to treat a friend.
"Bollocks, I've a Mind Healer in house," said Ron, waving to Draco who was off again on one of his breathless giggles at something that Harry was tracing on his palm. Worse than teenagers, the two of them.
Seething, Draco stuffed the letter back in the envelope and stacked them all haphazardly again. He had no hope of disguising his nosiness, nor did he particularly want to. James had done plenty of reorganizing these past few weeks and had left these out for anyone to see.
because he was a wizard. That didn't matter.
" - you judge my manners - "
The tiny Charming flat was rapidly becoming more like a home to him than Malfoy Manor had ever been. Not that he hated his childhood home...not exactly. It was tainted, of course, by the piss, shit, and tears of prisoners in their cellars, the screams of a certain bushy-haired Muggleborn in the west wing, the masked figures who held him and his family hostage under the threat of a glorified, animated, noseless corpse -
"James was Harry's father's name," McGonagall smiled fondly. "And of course, Harry's middle name."
he thought in horror,
But this battle, Harry thinks he's won. He won't eat his vegetables - he won't eat anything, in fact, that isn't a room-temperature cup of pudding steeped in preservatives. He will starve unless it's the pudding cup, and he
Monty signed, brows raised, eyes wide, hands already coming out to massage James's not-sore-thank-you-very-much shoulders.
"Da' said they didn' wan' anything tae do with him," Alec insisted, bending over the phone again with his tiniest pair of needle-nose pliers.
There's chocolate, wine, and FUDGE!  Sparks will fly!  (Literally!)
That would surely get James to see that his world wasn't all sunshine and daisies after the war. There was plenty that was fucked up. James was always having to defend his parenting to people who thought someone else could do better, someone who was older or less mute or more mobile or entirely straight. So of course he would relate to Remus's struggle and build up an appropriate wary outlook on the Ministry and maybe start taking everything that came from magic with a grain of salt.
"The laws that the
"Excuse me!" Scorpius snapped. "We're s'posed to talk about manners!"
Alarm bells were ringing in her mind, but surely this was a misunderstanding, surely James meant that Monty preferred simply to offer his help…?
. He wouldn't bring it up, but even Sirius had to know that if he had been abusing himself in the shower, he probably wouldn't be down here two minutes later. Right?
Harry interrupted before Remus could wind himself up even more.
Draco bit his lip and gripped the counter, his knuckles turning white. He breathed deeply and told himself it could be worse. Prism was nothing if not powerful, so it was lucky that Greg was getting help sooner rather than later. It was the sort of potion that could have changed everything, could have been worshipped by the healing world, if it weren't for the downfalls.
"Ha!" Monty barked loudly, stooping low to lift up a jagged piece of whatever Muggle contraption had broken apart. "Tha's a load! ALEC!"
"What on earth do you have to be sorry about, your hair?" Draco's mouth was curled in a teasing smile, but his striking grey eyes were worried. He reached out as if to knock the dust loose from his hair, but Harry flinched back and he retreated. "I have seen a bird's nest before yours, you know, I won't fall to pieces seeing you without your hat..."
"A nice one?" he suggests. "One who recognizes the importance of maintaining steady blood sugar levels whilst traversing treacherous terrain!"
"That depends on what Draco has to say," Nott went on, nodding to Tony. Tony sighed and began digging around in Nott's robe pocket, grimacing as if the action were the most undignified he'd ever been asked to do.
Oh shit

"I know the ethics!" He turned away, suddenly sickened by her perfect eyebrows. "I submitted half of them."
"Cantankerous Nott is passed, Lucius," Mum said gently. "Years gone now, dear. You remember."
simmering under the surface, though James thought they had successfully steered it toward a healthy banter instead of the violence and suspicion of the past. In the six weeks they had spent together as Healer and Loon, Malfoy was normally the cool and aloof sort that could transition smoothly into theatrical and candid. He was posh and vulgar, understanding and judgmental. Not at all like the professional berk that was blinking blankly at him today.
As a trio, they made an early start for the wizarding gallery that held a large collection of Dean's work. Arthur stopped by the front and joined a workshop led by Dean - something about sentient subjects - while Alec went with Dad to check out the exhibits. He meant to pay more attention, meant to - what was the word? -
“Nipples,” Draco blurts. His cheeks are burning but he's unable to look away. Potter fails to choke back a laugh and it turns into a long, inelegant snort, and then they’re both giggling madly. Draco shucks his own jumper and goes a step further—he slings his dress shirt onto the bed. He feels triumphant until Potter—apparently the demented lovechild of a Blast-Ended Skrewt and a Poltergeist—reaches over and tweaks one of his nipples through his own sweaty undershirt. Draco yelps and dances out of Potter’s reach, but his grin betrays him.
James laughed outright at the story of Malfoy blackmailing his friend Blaise into taking Polyjuice Potion to impersonate him so that he could skip a four-hour budget meeting. He had treated himself and Scorpius to a mid-day field trip.
"That's not healthy!"
he would say - but he let them do what they wanted with their room. And they both wanted a bit of a mess...it distracted from the stolen mobile and stowaway cat.
, Monty persisted.
"They split," Dean said. Malfoy didn't seem to take that in so he bent close to the blond's face and practically shouted: "Monty and Harry split up two weeks ago! That's why we've ambushed him tonight. To cheer him up, not set him off!"
“Right,” Arthur huffs, taking over once Bellatrix is finished with her introductory spiel. “Diversity. What is diversity?”
spell at his sneakers, before venturing out into Muggle London.
, Monty pleaded, eyes wide. But James knew he could turn in a second. Malfoy made Monty...not-Monty.
He was shaking all over and Monty huffed a little laugh, not sounding particularly mirthful.
"It doesn't make me elitist to have been fed properly my whole life, you stupid pigeon!"
With a long-suffering sigh, Draco walked them through the oscillating process for memory recovery, which was hardly an exact science and left him with a migraine that even St. Mungo's strongest potions hadn't quite shaken. Healer Abbott had already given her statement about her assistance, this was completely unnecessary.
James idly wondered how long it would be before people told stories of a mad wizard who burned down his family's home, locked in a nightmare he couldn't distinguish from reality.
, desperate to know if he himself was being a clingy nut and what could he do to get Monty off his back.
He no longer sounds muffled; everything's much too loud now. Senses fried and overwrought, Draco shoves him back on instinct and then watches in horror as Potter goes careening off their island. He crashes into the metal bed and Draco's expecting a howl of pain, but Potter just leaps back up, gasping, and returns to their island.

Charming's hands lifted and hovered, and Draco could just
"Right. Went by James Smith at first, then they started callin' him Charming. The doctors made it official on the paperwork before he was discharged."
"He's an old regular of mine, but I haven't seen him in a bit. Was beginning to think he'd found a new purveyor of ice cream!"
Mr. James said with a funny grin.
"That is usually why one stops by an Open House," Malfoy drawled, "when they're not returning errant children, that is. Thank you, by the way."
It's Lenny who resorts to tying him down to the bed to keep him from "ruining" himself. The second time he's caught with the evidence in his pants, he vows never to have to endure this lesson a third time. He's not even allowed up to relieve himself - Lenny changes his nappies and spoon-feeds him his meals and by the time he's trusted again, he has half a mind to sleep standing up rather than ever return to a horizontal position.
Static, and Alec lifted the contraption a little higher in the air.
The Aurors labeled the case cold after five years. Remus and Hermione tried to talk to him, tried to get him to maybe consider referring to Harry in the past tense... Mum and Dad hosted a private memorial service that summer, which Ron refused to attend because
When there was nothing left to say, when it had all been recounted in actual, concrete words, James felt less overwhelmed, though still numb. And when there were no more tears to cry, James was finally able to unwind. As he drifted away from Ron and Hermione's guest room, he thought he felt Draco press a kiss to his hand.
.” She mispronounces it perversely and Hermione seems ready to correct her. “Can’t wait to get inside.”
. In just under an hour, he would have to stare into their eyes and witness - no,
He'd just combined the letter D with the sign for penis! "You - I can't - Hades take you, Potter!"
“Who’s writing you?” Sirius mumbled into his mug.
James protested. Where was he getting this from? Because of the protests?
"A stunt broom?" Terry frowned. "What's the difference?"
His mind's eye found a warm yellow-pine floor with deep brown knots and streaks of grain. A plush rug appeared quite without his invitation, and he even spotted a stone hearth beginning to take shape right ahead of him.
“SHIT!” he screams. “Y-your back!”
Time seemed to slow down and speed up all at once. Harry was grinning widely, all smugness left behind for teary green eyes and a reprehensible level of sincerity. Harry was saying something, but the ringing in Draco's ears drowned it out. He remembered kissing Harry at this dried up well years ago. It was cold then, too - just past Christmas, in fact. And he remembered kissing Harry in their new home months ago, surrounded by old photos and new furniture. And, as if watching a memory in a pensieve, he saw himself reach out and haul Harry to his feet now, cramming their lips together in a heated kiss that could melt any frost.
Blaise's gaze darted down to the form as Draco lay it out flat to dry. His eyes widened in understanding.
"Are you quite finished? I tried Starr's, you second-rate ichthyes," he growled. "Came in red."
He actually manages to get his hands on the floor and then latches onto Ben's legs to drag himself the rest of the way off the mattress. When he bends over to pick him up again, Harry swings. A loud crunch tells him he's broken Ben's nose, and he scrambles away on his bum. Ben is clutching his nose, blood dripping down his chin, eyes tearing up. Harry uses the table to heave himself up just as Ben rushes forward. He gets in another punch or two before Ben grabs his arm in a bruising grip and swings him around towards the bed.
- and it was packed with shelves, bins, chocolates, and people. A dark wooden floor, old, scratched, and polished; a matching dark wooden ceiling with low beams that nearly touched Remus's head and did not improve his claustrophobia. There were too many colors, sounds, and smells to distinguish. Even the walls were busy: floor to ceiling, the cream-colored walls were covered in neatly arranged shelves, newspaper cut-outs, photos, even sketches and paintings. He couldn't even begin to guess what a blond man sporting an archer's kit had to do with chocolates, but he was the subject of several posted drawings.
"Too bloody hot for this," Draco whispers. He remembers all too clearly the time Potter and his friends were…guests…at Malfoy Manor, and decides it's wise to skip the why of what's happening in Scarhead's head right now. "Ease up, Potter. We're locked in, yes, but there's food, so she's not the worst warden. For all we know, she really does just want her privacy for the night. She's working on breakfast."
,” Draco sighs, waving a dismissive hand. The air is thick. It’s difficult to draw a full breath. They’ll have to sleep here tonight. He'll use a marshmallow as a pillow. “Wands’re okay. They’re just a tool.”
Harry raised his brows and pursed his lips, looking at Florean pointedly. He shook his head minutely, desperately.

to get over this.
"Ron, these protocols are in place for a reason," she said firmly.
were put on uses a love potion as a base."
"Do you have an appointment?"
"Yes, you are," Ron mumbled, pouring himself a glass of water. Tony returned to the kitchen with a helpless shrug and Ron rolled his eyes. Harry was a stubborn arse.
"Go on then, what did ye say?!" Monty repeated, jaw tight, hands clenched on the tabletop. Harry pursed his lips and screwed his eyes shut in annoyance, whether at Monty's shouting, the robot's loud and smelly destruction, or Remus's manners, he couldn't begin to guess.
Potter is watching the sky through the naked tree limbs overhead. Draco drops down beside him, crossing his legs and arranging his cloak elegantly. He doesn't lie back. He doesn't want to see that damn void again, the blinding sheet of blue on a sunny afternoon. He stares hard at the spot where the Dark Lord must have been. He imagines what it must be like to stand on the precipice between life and death, the promise of the sun and the finality of the cold ground beneath his own divine arse…
all or nothing though...if he let them on that scarlet train, it would take them too far from home, too far for James to protect them, to help them. What if someone’s pet cat cornered Alec? What if Arthur got himself in another tiff with older students again, students who carried magic wands? What if another noseless dark lord rose up out of the shadows and sought revenge on Harry Potter by going after Arthur and Alexander Charming?
"Come here."
“I’ll get this over to Corporate, Mr. Diggory,” he says, barely sparing a glance at the camera. “Thanks for coming forward. I can complain all I want, but what really counts is an official statement from someone who… Well, someone who isn't as close to the situation as I am.”
Charming signed and Gibbs looked surprised, even pleased, before he translated: "I want tae know how tae use a wand again."
"Considering the Board of Directors, by
"Don't let this put you off Malfoy - I mean it, Harry!" she warned. "He's done you a world of good. Even Ron sees it."
he asked carefully, dreading the answer. There were so many things, so many issues pulling them apart at the seams, he didn't even know where to start -
hits Voldemort square in the chest, ripping apart his newly formed body just seconds after the connection between their wands was broken.
Draco waited and just when he thought his method of extracting more information wouldn't work this time, James went on.
This - whatever he and Charming had - was something else entirely. Because Charming was entirely different from Potter, Gryffindor-inspired protest be damned. Charming was a grown man, not a wiry boy in a red and gold tie with a stick up his arse about justice, good and evil, right and wrong. But then Draco's eye caught the photo on the front page again and that wasn't entirely accurate….
“Skin to skin or…?” He can’t even think how to finish the question. He’s so tired. If the bed weren’t made of evil metal coils, he would lie down and drift off with hardly a fuss.
"Right. Where's the bedroom?"
What a turn-around his life had had since September, when the very thought of sending his boys away had torn him apart. Now Monty was taking up his old mantle, claiming magic was dangerous and he should flee for his life. Ron assured him that Monty was safe, that his memories of two nights ago proved their Polyjuice theory. But that didn't make it any less jarring to hear Monty's voice berating him in that voicemail.
"Blimey buggering bollocks, can I just get a little time to myself?!" he snapped, dabbing the mess with a rag. He wished with ever fiber of his being that he could do the same with the front page of the
"What'd he say?" asked Ron, eyeing James suspiciously.
"I thought you were the Bi-Who-Lived?"
Alec stormed up the stairs with his brother hot on his heels. Leonard darted past and he only threw himself into the wall a little bit to avoid her. He was getting better with cats, or at least with Leo.
"One as Haz Blue, and one as Harry Potter."
"When is your next appointment with...your charming new patient?" he said, clearly trying to work around the non-existent block.
The feeling was overwhelming: it took over his senses and he was flooded with foreign but intimately familiar sense-memories. The smell of rain, freshly turned earth, blood. The sticky feeling of sweat dampening his shirt, the uncleanliness of wearing clothes that had gone far too long without a wash. A familiar cramp in his stomach, the kind of hunger he hadn't known since the boys were tots. The voices around him faded to something else, a din of noise that didn't scare him but certainly didn't belong in his kitchen, sounding rather like the halls at the boys' primary school -
Aurors Ronald Weasley and Anthony Goldstein hadn't known the comfort of sleep in a week.
In the memory, Draco started barfing slugs. In the pensieve, Auror Weasel laughed himself sick and had to be excused.
That was another twisted truth. He couldn't tell him just
He'd hoped that Alec and Arthur might see Malfoy for the creep he was, might then get their dad to listen to reason, but they were nearly as smitten as James. Malfoy charmed them with tales of the idiot hero Harry Potter, who bumbled his way into random acts of gallantry. James took it all good-naturedly, just as he did when Arthur started up on some of his favorite stories about James, which sent Malfoy into ridiculous, breathless giggles.
"Ye have me!" Monty cried, throwing the piping bag down. "Ye have me, the boys, and Ron and Hermione! Dean! Seamus!"
"Not really all that funny..." Hermione muttered under her breath.
"Shut up. HR Weasley was talking about
"He's a different man now," Draco supplied, his tone even.
, with
"Potion-induced hemophilia," Doctor Abbott declared. He rather liked this doctor when she performed James's physical back in September. She was able to sign quite well, having a Deaf father. "Did you bring a sample of the potions you're using?"
James's mouth tightened.
The charmed creatures faded and reality began to creep back in. Monty was holding his hand where it was still clutching his forearm, watching him excitedly, knowingly. That Lupin fellow was staring at him too, but nobody else was paying any mind. Their guests went on with the meal as James forced himself back. Back to the kitchen, back to his clean trousers and thermal shirt, back to his left hand on Monty's arm and his right hand on his wand -
Sirius looked as though he was trying to keep himself from reaching out and taking Harry's hands in his own, and he stamped down his desire for the touch. He wouldn't like it. He never liked it, even when he wanted it.
"Showin' house," he blubbered into the ground, his cheek pressing sharply against an exposed root of the tree. Harry frowned, not understanding, then his head snapped up at the open house across the street.
"Don't," came his quiet warning. James froze on the spot, lifting his hands in a surrendering gesture but barely sparing Tony a glance. He nodded in what he hoped was a comforting way to Arthur, though he had no idea if it was misguided...if he could even hope to get the kids out of this alive.
Harry hesitated again, shoving his hand forward as if he were reaching into an invisible man's pocket. His fingers curled around an imaginary wand before pulling back to sign:
These are the Days of Lenny. Without windows but with just enough routine, Harry estimates it has been several years in this little underground room. Probably not ten, though it feels like it. It's impossible to be sure of time, so he defines it by whatever he's calling his captor nowadays.
"S-s-st
"And what do you do, Mr. Blue?" Terry asked, leaning forward over the receptionist counter, arms crossed.
"Don't you dare," he said, still choking back his glee.
But it seems like Harry couldn't care less for his efforts. Draco does everything right. The neck is his favorite place to start. No one invites a touch to their neck, not without complete and utter trust.
Potter rights himself too quickly and Draco just glimpses his hand raised up triumphantly before he staggers into him and they both tumble to the ground. Potter's on top, which means it's Draco's back they're smelling.
Six hours later, Remus hustled down a street teeming with couples, families, kids, and teenagers. The crowd around him moved lazily in the summer heat; people wandered aimlessly in and out of the quaint little shops and restaurants that dotted Bell Street. He tried not to get impatient, but intense smells and loud noises pressed in on him from all sides. His patched Muggle clothes scratched at his skin every time someone brushed by and he very much wanted to call it a day and Apparate back home to Teddy.
"Never saw 'im eat the treats, mind. Took 'em home instead, but he swore they were the most delicious he'd ever stuffed in 'is gorgeous gob. Now a crammed those biscuits wae butter an' sugar, but he never gained an ounce, so a knew 'im fer the dirty rotten liar 'e was. It wasn't til a happened upon 'im at the park one day that a knew he had kids, and lo and behold, there's both of 'em wae their fat little fists on ma biscuits!"
by confessing now.
He brought the cat back to the wardrobe where an open can of wet cat food was waiting. Arthur watched her proudly as James considered what came next. Obviously he couldn't just turn the cat out of doors, but an animal shelter wasn't out of the question. Then again, watching Arthur watch the cat, James knew he couldn't just throw away four weeks of love and care and bonding…
[static]
he cried.
"But how can you
, and
The warding was fine. It was having a security wizard on duty that made him feel ridiculous, like a critical political figure who was intent on fucking off and making chocolates instead of buckling down and getting to work. More and more lately, he had admitted to Malfoy that week, he felt like he owed more to these people than to simply carry on with his chocolate. But he
“Well, yeah,” he admits. “But that don’t mean I don’t have eyes! I gotta walk past Men’s to get to tech in the back, don’t I? An' I should get to see two plastic blokes get it on just the same as the straight couple in Hawaiian shirts by Luggage & Travel!”
“The thing is though, I like jewelry. Repairs, commissions, sales - I’m very good at what I do. I’ve been hounding father for years to incorporate a jewelry section, it’s a natural extension to the other accessories we offer.”
From the cramped little space between the floor and the oven flap, he twisted his head up to peer cautiously through the little tinted window. The room flashed again, somehow even brighter than before. Rachel swore under the din of thunder and threw up a strong shield charm just as a bolt of lightning shot into the ceiling over their heads, breaking up and forking in every direction. A bolt of white-hot light darted toward the oven over James's head, but it hit the shield and fizzled out.
Draco said nothing and simply pointed at the boy with the more outlandish clothes, by way of explanation.
, James said, nodding.
Dinner was actually going smoothly thus far. Monty subtly reminded him (by signing for all the world to see) (and James could only hope that no one else except his boys knew sign language) (except there they went, immediately whispering to George and Teddy) that he had always harbored a fondness for redheads and so he must be thoroughly enjoying himself now. James, of course, began plotting his revenge on Monty. Chili-powder in his special ganache, that would teach him. Monty abhorred chili-laced chocolate as much as James adored gingers.
James repaired the old manicure station with a flick of his wand, marveling at how easy it would have been to renovate the shop with magic all those years ago. The vintage cash register would take some work; Alec had offered to work on it but James wouldn't hear another word about them returning to the shop anytime soon. He sent them back at Hogwarts early, where it was safe.
"Actually, I'm here to speak with the family of Alexander and Arthur Charming," Remus began, pulling out two identical sealed letters.
“Have you been to a Mind Healer before today, magical or otherwise?”
"He doesn't mind her - "
The ground was dropping away, the people were getting shorter and smaller as he rose above their heads. Arty was literally just
"He said Hermione would say it later so he might as well beat her to it."
Arthur stared up at him, full of cautious hope. Seemingly unable to speak, he signed:
"Tha' man broke yer nose?" he asked, unable to keep the growl out of his voice. What were Ron and Hermione thinking, sending James to a bloke who hexed him and cursed him and once broke his nose? Hadn't he been through
Dad didn't say anything for a long moment. His mouth twisted at the corner as he chewed the inside of his cheek. Then he grabbed his cane, tapped his watch to indicate the late hour, and nodded goodnight to them, closing the door gently on his way out.
Harry broke off and scrubbed a hand over his jaw, knitting his brow as he tried to recall. Malfoy had warned them that this moment, the exact moment of Obliviation, would likely remain disjointed from the rest of that night. Harry was striving to cram together his brittle memories of two separate events, two separate lives.
Draco bristles. “And what’s wrong, precisely, with our current inventory?”
all of it...just not that.
Malfoy looked surprised and vaguely suspicious.
"You don't recognize us?" Remus breathed. Harry's eyes widened and he turned to Monty, pulling on his arm to get his attention. Harry began waving his hands about, making a series of gestures that were too specific to be meaningless…
Life at Blupin Frottage was a decided improvement over his last situation. Remus taught at Hogwarts during the year, popping over each day after classes, and Sirius practically ran Zonko’s by himself. The shed had been converted from its original purpose - motorcycle repair - into a broommaking studio. Harry was working on his fourth broom, which happened to be his first paid commission. All in all, he had no complaints.
Harry squinted in confusion as Malfoy walked away, looking pleased with himself.
hut!"
. "I believe you can only improve further if you leave the nest yourself. Learn to fly. Girl Weasley can assist there, but I certainly can't do anything more for you."
. He met the eye of one of the snickering men, who winked and lifted a glass of something bubbly as if in toast to his discomfort.
“Yep.” Did he dare take another bite? He felt the tension linger in the air, telling him that Remus had more to say, so he waited it out, tracing the rim of his Holyhead Harpies mug idly.
"We put your things at the end of the train, second to last compartment. The last compartment has Aurors in it. If you need anything, just knock on the wall."
"Himself too, obviously," Weasley amended. "I should've given him the duty schedule, he didn't know who to look for when they went running down the street for an Auror. Took him nearly ten minutes to find Tony, and by then, Monty was gone."
the tedious renovation process?
"The Dark Lord..." he hissed. "Potter will come for his precious pet! This is Potter's, you said? Yes! He will come!"
They talk long into the hour. Harry plucks up his Gryffindor courage and tells Draco all about how there's something wrong with him, how he loves Draco with ever fiber of his little lion heart but he just doesn't want...that. Not from him, not from anyone. But what Draco hears is that there's something wrong with
—"That isn't helping! Stop it, you brute!"
like he does when ye leave 'im alone in a kitchen too long. Starts makin' buckets an' barrels of candies an' sweets like he's Willy Wonka!"
you in your own kitchen?"
Harry let out a sort of whining hum of a false-laugh and Draco's smile disappeared, replaced by a grimace.
Finally deciding that Terry, a former Quidditch player, wasn't feigning interest to be polite, Harry launched into a lengthy explanation. The paperbark tree was rubbery and spongy, an excellent option for stunts that were hard on both the broom and the body. The broom was heavier - both denser and thicker in girth - for better control, more momentum, all in all less effort for intense stunts. Speed wasn't so much a factor as stability, so the twigs could be steeped in potions and thickly plaited with charmed ribbons for special effects in a circus act.
Harry soon lost track of exactly how many properties they checked out that morning. Some were an instant, hard no - apparently "ultra modern" was code for "concrete block" - while others were simply...not a yes. He couldn't pinpoint what felt wrong about them and only offered half-answers to Draco's probing questions.
Monty tracked his every move. He stretched over James's reaching hands to pull down the hanging pots, he wouldn't let him stoop down to put a tray of warm chocolates on the bottom shelf of the cold box, he even pressed Harry down into a chair in the middle of his animated conversation with Malfoy. Harry hardly seemed to notice, except for the odd scowl or eye-roll, which told Ron all he needed to know about how common this was.
Harry knelt, swallowing hard and blinking harder. "It looks like an old friend of mine, you know. Her name was Hedwig."
"You're on," he accepted the challenge automatically, just-about-completely-certain that 'the first round' meant their first two drinks and not something more mysterious.
Standing in several inches of water, Luna continues to hold a gushing hose over a thoroughly dead plant.
Nobody believes them, of course. Pansy is in perfect agreement with Granger's theory that they simply poisoned themselves with hallucinogenic berries near the acromantula nest. When he and Potter present the ruined sneakers as proof, Granger counters with something clever about natural heat pockets. Potter nearly peals the shirt off his back to prove them wrong, but Draco stops him before he can back them into a story they're not ready to tell…
"He's not a fragile little - "
"Can you not do that, please?" Blaise asked, lip curling. Draco didn't even bother opening his eyes, he simply raised a finger, still cradling the truffle with love, and carried on with his savoring. "Not decent..."
"Always?"
They trudged upstairs as a unit after a quiet dinner and he sent the boys to their room, only for James to protest. He cut him off and sent them away. He didn't know what was going to be said tonight but he knew he didn't want them around to see it.
At some point, McGonagall began talking in depth about her school subject, transfiguration. Then she said something that implied, somehow, that she had personal experience as a feline. Monty seemed content to blink and let it go, but James nudged him urgently before the subject could move on.
"Now anyone else in the world would know a sunset picnic in the park is romantic, but no our James. So it came tae be Valentine's Day an' a make him a nice heart-shaped cake. Stayed up all night tae do it an' had no time fer the frosting but a bring it in tae work fer 'im anyway. Leave it in a pretty little box wae his name on it..." He paused, letting the tension build. "Come tae find him an hour in tae our shift an' dinnae see it anywhere an' he dinnae say nothin', so a reckon he's flustered, like 'e gets sometimes. Only later when am workin' the counter, some old bint is tryin' tae buy ma heart-shaped cake! It had got fancy piping over it by then, but a know ma cake. Ma daft pigeon only went an' decorated it, put it on the block for sale!"
Worse than the professionalism was the frigid shoulder James was getting. Malfoy wouldn't look at him, only at the smokey letters. In their torturous hour together, all they talked about was his sleeping schedule, his eating habits, and the protest.
, gods, we need - "
Harry's grimace twitched into something else and Draco scoffed. Now wasn't the time for
turns his head,
"Er - Mr. Charming?" Marge's voice rang out, loud as could be in the echoing alley. "I think you've missed the bins." In a quieter tone, she explained to the potential buyers, "We always try to keep the alley clean and clear for each other, it's the neighborly thing to do..."
Sirius clenched his fists and settled himself on the floor, leaning against the open door to study him clinically. Harry joined him on the floor and slumped casually, openly, against the side of his bed. He rarely used it as intended - he was still kipping on the sitting room couch and enjoying the novel experience.
us." The idea is preposterous, he can't believe he's even considering it, but…there are stories warning children against cooking in cauldrons. Nothing good comes from consuming magic. It isn't a spice, it's not meant to be consumed. Even dark wizards don't dare to eat their magic, the practice is…evil.
[enclosed: sample box of ginger and wasabi truffles]
Without a backup gift, Draco's birthday was ruined. But not as ruined as it would be if he arrived and saw this oversized disaster.
And then he had to follow it up with another Talk, because Alec was still asking questions about kissing.
"Got what?"
"Not the best argument, seeing as we all saw the damage you and Hagrid are capable of."
"Goldstein?" asked Draco. "Why's your partner on a different shift than you?"
“Don’t!” Harry pushed Sirius away on instinct, his stomach clenching as if he’d been punched. His godfather shouldn't have been easy to push over but he toppled backwards onto his arse anyway, bewildered and hurt. Harry was sorry for it, but also he wasn’t, so much. “Don’t…”
“Magic?” Minerva deadpans. Albus raises his bushy white eyebrows and leans forward, intrigued.
Not much can be seen through the closed blinds except for two figures, conversing quietly across a desk. A paper is signed and handed over. One figure stands, and then the other. They shake hands.
"Mr. Potter, don't do anything stupid!"
you, you twat!" his friend hissed. Draco snorted, opening his eyes to look pointedly at their surroundings. The Janus Thickey Ward was not exactly teeming with gossips.
he tried.
Harry poked his head over the bannister of the loft that looked over the sitting room. "Who...?" Only two owls were permitted anywhere near the wards - Ron and Hermione's owl Pig, and Ginny's owl Tig. Anyone who wanted to reach Remus and Sirius these days sent their owls to their workplaces.
James pursed his lips and cocked his head, at a complete loss as to how he could get out of this one. Now his gift to Monty - baking supplies - looked like a big
They could figure this out.
Pansy is convinced that Potter has a saving-people thing, and she claims that theory is straight from Granger's horse mouth. She says that's why Potter always pairs himself up with Draco at every opportunity. Draco thinks Pansy should shut her gibbering gob and let them work in peace—or rather, in not-peace.
Skull-and-crossbones mug in hand, Harry quietly closed the cupboard and watched the back of Remus’s head. Though the shed wasn’t visible from here, he was looking outside now instead of pretending to read his paper, no doubt thinking of Harry’s workspace. Reluctantly, Harry returned to the table, setting down Sirius’s mug and pouring the tea.
kids, and then spend some time alone because they were a lot to handle and he needed a nap. In a proper bed.
Not there, definitely not.
"Imperfect?" he spluttered. "It's no better than the random flashbacks he got before!"
There was only one thing for it and that was to destroy the fort. He made the mistake of sleeping next to a very attractive man and of course he woke up with
"I need to drink," he said, but that wasn't quite right if Draco's sudden alarm was anything to go by. "
to uncover more.
"Romilda Vane once tried to use a love potion on Harry," Hermione supplied. Ron relayed some orders to the Aurors in the hall and said his goodbyes before hurrying off.
"But that's not the alphabetical letter J, is it?"
"Not just about your life this time, James," Monty argued, still avoiding his eye, still stirring that blasted soup. "Alec an' Arty deserve a chance tae be a part of that world if they want tae, an' they
"You should've heard him back in February, just after Valentine's," she whispered, her voice going high in her excitement. "Harry was comparing him to a
"Enough, Nott," Tony snapped, touching one hand absently to the cuffed sleeve of his robe. It was strange to see him in civilian clothes. "Your decision, Mr. Potter?"
“Thank you, Mr. Gibbs, but Mr. Charming is quite capable of elaborating if he wishes to do so.”
A burning smell assaulted his sensitive nose and the Thing's head began shaking and popping up and down.
"Hands-on experience, Draco. Unless you'd rather not get dirty?" Potter smirks over his shoulder while he navigates a massive log blocking their path. Perched up on the frozen moss on top of the log, straddling the wood obscenely, Potter's arse is divine. Then he swings his other leg over and drops to the far side, leaving Draco to scramble after him.
"So?”
"Have you ever seen such a big fuck off fireplace? Or cauldron?"
"Please, you're right, I'm s - "
He ran a hand through his hair, pushing it on end.
Potter whips around again to look at him, hopping from foot to foot. Draco looks down and nearly throws up. Potter’s bare feet are searing right before their eyes. All at once, Draco can feel the heat through his socks.
"Only if you solved it wrong." Harry grinned wickedly. He was enjoying this far too much and now, Merlin forbid, he was whipping out a long scroll of parchment with an annoying little flourish. "Number Three - " he cleared his throat " - our third date."
, Monty decided. James went to protest but he was waved down.
The stationary matched James's old prescription fulfillment slips from Starr's Apothecary.
"Why not?" Barred from the knob, Draco reaches overhead for the sugar crystals on the awning. With his few extra inches, he's safe from Potter's—
James didn't quite believe him. He thought it might be worse the next time it came up but he was exhausted and couldn't deal with anything more than a simple yes or no right now. This would have to do. He nodded and turned to go back to bed when Monty touched his arm.
"That was - that was that bloke," he said weakly.
"Sorry - Arthur got on his belly to watch from under the door," he went on. "Stuck his wand out and managed a good enough swish-and-flick to levitate that big heavy sales register over Monty's head. Cracked him right open which saved his dad's arse and gave Harry enough time to get the boys out."
James stared at him.
"...can I...help you? Look for it, I mean."
"You'd have me believe the Sorting Hat would've left the Boy-Who-Lived to fend for himself? Among the children of Death Eaters? Among actual
"What is it?" Arthur said, looking between them uncertainly.
"Yes, exactly. It said I'd do well in Slytherin. But it let me choose."
Ears ringing, Harry smashed the tap closed so hard he felt his hand bruise. He heard his godfather's chuckling retreat down the hall and figured he was safe, figured Sirius wouldn't go so far as to punish him anyway, but still he felt sick. Unclean, even after the shower, even though he hadn't actually done
just stop talking."
Presents were wrapped in varying papers, some brown, some just plain Prophet newspaper, some bright and moving. James didn't bother breaking out a trash bag this year, as he could simply vanish the mess with his wand when it became too much. Magic was great for aesthetics.
James lay in the middle of the bed, a son on either side as he stared at the ceiling, unable to sleep. His boys assured him that, between Narcissa holding Alec against her neck and Draco pressing Arthur to his chest, they hadn't actually seen anything until after the Aurors arrived and pried them off their father. Even then, Alec said, it was only a glimpse of Tony's arm in the corridor.
, James explained, pulling out the wand that he had taken to carrying in his pocket.
jumper. "Number Three sent me to Moscow, Potter, not Glasgow!"
"We must do this more often," Scorpius said seriously as he settled the plate of biscuits back onto the table, which stood at the perfect height for his own six-year-old self to sit comfortably. "Do tell us about your travels, Mummy."
, James repeated.
"Eat wilted ambrosia, you Cronus-shagging tart!"
“What?!” Hermione squeaks, eyes wide with panic. “Pansy! Help!”
His chest went tight. He
"So did ye get it?" he asked again with a smirk, rooting through the drawers of the wardrobe to find his pyjamas.
"Sorry!" he spluttered. "Sorry, I apologize, I'm not - I'm not making a very good impression, am I?" he laughed, sounding manic. Monty quirked a brow. "I only - your boys here, they remind me so much of someone I once knew, years ago," he confessed. "Spitting image, really, only without the glasses."
He manages to flood his room once by pulling at the wrench-tightened pipes under the toilet until his palms bleed, but it isn't the deadly, time-to-leave-the-bunker type flood he's hoping for...just a cold puddle to soak his socks. He could do more damage if he left the sink running.
Thirsts for blood
Draco glared at him hotly - or as hotly as one could while standing in an open field. In February. In fucking
Alec jumped and fell forward slightly when his elbows slipped off the table.
Shaking his head and resolutely ignoring the Auror guard that trailed him from room to room, James grabbed his cane and headed into the kitchen to get to work. A shiny black crystal was tied into his shoelaces, pressing against the top of his foot with every step. It was a gentle comfort.
"For other people, more than you." Ron was all fond pride and Harry wondered how many bull-headed aurors and dim bureaucrats had fallen victim to Hermione's temper over the years, especially when it came to his case.
He grunts and staggers, still holding onto Potter. They fall to the ground and he manages to bite his lip on the way down. Potter's lying stretched out on top of him, his heated back on Draco's chest, and they take a moment to catch their breath. It was a short battle but they're nearly spent. It's bloody
"He's not been away from 'em ever," Gibbs insisted, sniffling horribly. Charming looked over at him with a weary (annoyed?) expression. "S'always been them three together. Ye have no idea what he's been through for those boys, ye jus' have no - "
More details and a timeline of events surrounding Harry Potter's disappearance in 1998 can be found on page 8.
Harry brushed Hugo's fringe away from his face, studying his freckles.
Draco takes his place in a huge circle of glass cases, removing the sign that reads
Harry stood abruptly, but he only looked confused and worried, like any Muggle father whose children had just started riding gravity-challenged furniture round the kitchen. McGonagall brought the giggling, chattering boys back down. Arthur looked disappointed but gleeful while Alec's eyes were burning with curiosity. The boys launched into a thousand questions, and Monty barked some of his own for good measure. Sitting once more, Harry took in the scene with huge eyes. He chewed on his lip and traced patterns in the woodgrain of the table. He said nothing.
"Well you an' a know that," Monty said. "He's takin' all the sensible precautions, he's a good father, but there are still so many who wan' tae take Teddy away from him."
things. But that didn't mean they had to like them.
James trust him?
“Fuck you, Potter,” he laughs, suddenly overwhelmed, and Harry grins.
Draco spluttered violently, dribbling the traitorous water down his green Healer robes.
Draco could have kissed Abbott. Not literally, of course, because girls were icky.
"When you disappeared," she sighed, and Harry's stomach didn't do that clenching-flip it usually did when that was mentioned. "You have to understand, there was so much going on, things didn't really settle into a proper, clear-headed search for - for ages, it seemed. Of course, they
Malfoy's voice was clipped and cold, his hand reaching out in demand. James bit his lip to keep from laughing as he handed over the warm knit cap that Ron had forced on him over a month ago. In the blink of an eye, Malfoy had swapped out the small beret for the plain black cap, but it didn't look much better paired with his own semi-formal Muggle clothes.
He has no doubt that Pansy could come up with a whole new theory without Granger's help.
A puddle of maggot-sized slugs bubbled up and cascaded down his smart green robes. It was awful. Really, he almost felt bad for laughing at Weasel in second year after this curse rebounded upon himself. Almost.
That night three years ago was the first time James had asked him over to the shop after hours. When he had got that text, Monty nearly wet himself as thoroughly as Al did that night:
And that was true. Under all of this tension, all the rows and strained meals lately, James loved Monty so much sometimes it hurt. He loved his warmth, his care, his belief in James when James thought he himself was the malevolent cause of all the fires in the world. James loved Monty's smile, his brown eyes, and his wiry hair. His voice and his clever tricks to swear without swearing. For five years, their easy friendship had grown closer, stronger, until it led to a messy snog in James's cramped little office that was more suited as a cupboard...a snog that of course sent James into a month of full-blown panic before he decided to try it again. And again and again and again.
was sorry, to tell him that he hadn't known what that spell did and hadn't even given a second thought before - "No, Potter...you don't get to say anything this time. You talk too much." Draco smirked weakly at him, still hunching low over the table, and James frowned.
"Mr. Malfoy?"
It was true, anyway. His godfather was all devious smirks and sad, fond moments that reminded Harry of Mrs. Weasley bidding her children farewell at Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. In his darkest thoughts, which sprang up without warning to twist his muscles into knots, Harry wondered if he'd pushed Sirius too far over the months. Maybe he'd overheard his whinging about him to Kim. Maybe he was hurt by Harry's antics after the drinking incident.
Monty thumped down the stairs and the kitchen door opened just as he put the lid on the box and motioned Anne over. Monty obviously hadn't looked over at the shop on his way downstairs, but that was alright...James wanted to see his face when he saw it for the first time!
, Monty said with a frown, passing him a muffin from one of the displays.
"Oh - Harry?" Remus called up one evening after dinner. "I forgot to mention - you've a letter!"
"Er - marshmallows?"
"You were never curious?" He couldn't imagine a world in which Harry Potter managed to curtail his own curiosity.
“Yes, that’s what mandatory means,” Hermione G. grumbles. Nobody seems to take notice, but behind her, Pansy P. smirks devilishly.
The world spun, the sky tipped - his thighs hit the stone wall behind them and then they were stumbling - grappling - falling -
and the memory faded.
but not at all
“You alright?” He squatted down but felt unbearably close to the boy, like he was crowding him, and stood back up, shuffling his feet awkwardly.
Harry cringed and steeled himself, trying to square his shoulders as best he could in the cramped space. He'd faced down Voldemort once, a lifetime or so ago, but this was so much worse. He really liked Draco, with his fitted clothes, posh accent, and good posture. His patient, uncompromising love for Scorpius. His cheeks when they went pink. He'd rather face a dozen dark lords than let Draco down, and to have his confession pressed out of him like this was worse than the Cruciatus!
, but he couldn't be sure. He leaned to the side, toward the dissipating smoke, trying to catch Malfoy's eye. The pointy git still wouldn't look at him. It was infuriating.
he said.
"But the magic school has - er, Quidditch? That sport from the picture?" Arthur protested weakly. Dad gave him an unimpressed look.
, he decided. He wouldn’t use Polyjuice to help his kids skive classes, but he could bring Monty. To smooth things over. Everyone loved Quidditch.
"Ah - yes, that bit there sort of paints you up like a damsel in distress," she admitted. "But isn't that at least a refreshing change of pace from all that savior drivel?"
"But none work as well as yours," Tony interrupted. "Your method is patented. Who else knows how to do it?"
Trying very hard not to laugh, the bastard croaked, "And was it lustrous and shiny?"
, James reminded him spitefully as he carried Anne and the box over to the window. The anger in his chest and the pain in his hip was making him nauseous. He hated this, he hated it so much, he was never right even when Monty was wrong and he just wanted this shit to
Wrenching his mind away from that disturbing train of thought, he went on: “Mr. Charming, you’ve experienced some sort of a violent incident which resulted in the traumatic loss of your memories and identity. You’ve recently been reintroduced to a whole new world, and your children are away from home for what I assume is the first time…?”
Draco sipped his imaginary tea and graciously complimented their host. Draco didn't even mind negotiating his long form to fit into the miniature chair at the miniature table, because Scorpius was a paradigm of manners.
He left the room, shutting the door softly.
he thought desperately, and Prongs was off.
It figures that he’d come so close to sex—with
that would
He stopped, feeling sick. Eleven years later, over a decade of reminding himself that he had had no other options, and he still felt like the scum of the earth.
“So what did you do?” Malfoy asked, sounding as surprised and bewildered as James had felt in that moment all those years ago.
“And you don’t need our permission?”
“What was that time of your life like?” Malfoy prompted.
He was tapping his cane again, face pale, eyes dark. Draco wondered idly if he had recovered the memory of the Golden Trio's incarceration in Malfoy Manor. The Blue Room was brightly lit and its color scheme couldn't be more different from the west wing where Potter and his friends had been brought as captives, but sometimes the smell of a place was what triggered memories rather than the sight of it. What did Malfoy Manor smell like? Impressive or dungy? He made a mental note to pick up some incense from Diagon Alley. Something fresh and crisp, something that wouldn't remind anyone of the war.
Ron couldn't care less about the people who weren't there that night, Obliviating and torturing his friend. But it was technically the same case, and all that was left to do, next to paperwork, was tackle what remained of this Prism ring.
"And does this place strike your fancy, Haz Blue?"
For the first time in years, they made a blanket fort in the living room. Dad even used magic to enlarge one of the blankets, floating it high overhead so it felt more like a blanket castle. Robert was appropriately enthused over the hot cocoa and Alec, delirious with sugar and no sleep, even summoned the courage to feed a soaked marshmallow to Leonard.
"Got it," he snapped.
But cruelly addictive. By its very nature, Prism was an imitation. Like a boggart: powerful and effective, but not quite true. Instead of putting someone to sleep once to set them back on track, it would wreak havoc on their sleep cycle, prompting them to seek the potion over and over again. And while it would regrow a bone, the pain of the regrowth would never fade, not even with a pain reliever like what Draco was testing for Potter now. They would seek out Prism as a pain reliever, again and again and again…
"After everything, mate, who could blame you?"
" - and my chocolate - "
Draco wants to abandon the chair now, but that seems rude. She’s right. He owes her a chance to explain, even if cooking magic goes against everything he’s been taught since childhood about magic purity—about tainted, undead souls and madness. He’s been wrong before.
"A Cannons game?" Alec said, reading over his shoulder. "D'ye think he really turned down
he said, scrunching his face. Did he really believe that?
Potter lets slip a moan and the vibrations enter Draco through his lips, through his fingers. His cock twitches with interest and frankly, he can't think of anything more interesting than snogging Potter's brains out until he forgets about the damn door. He pulls Potter's stupid face closer, cramming those sweet lips against his own. Potter moans again and the feel of it courses through Draco like fire.
"And now?"
Ron left him there, ranting in a way that was eerily similar to Malfoy Senior, and went to check on Harry.
Four days before Sunday's tentatively-scheduled unveiling, Harry was pacing his workshop and wringing his hands, which had proven to be useless for putting the finishing touches on Luna’s broom, which was meant to be done by now, which made him officially late on his very first commission, which meant his new business was a failure and he shouldn’t be blowing all his money on a stupid house he didn’t need --
He's deduced that Danny is a squib or maybe has sworn off the use of his wand. He gave him a potion right off, when Harry was still twitching with the pain of the Cruciatus, but he has yet to see a wand, much less his own.
“They don’t fire people anymore,” Dean T. argues. His apron is sky-blue with a cheery yellow ribbon tacked onto the edges. “Too many lawsuits. Easier just to make them miserable enough to quit.”
he corrected.
James spluttered at that. He absolutely
his inner voice sighed.
He returned James's smile weakly before his eyes flicked back to the fridge. James caught his gaze and put on his trademark warning glare. With a surge of annoyance, Monty scowled at James instead of the letters and stepped around him to check on the batter swirling away in the stand mixer.
James shook his head, staring hard at the rejected mug.
Draco was ill-prepared, to say the least. Draco was ambushed, to speak accurately. Ambushed by the Charming chaps, if he were feeling lyrical. Auror Weasley escorted them through the gates, up the gravel walkway, across the threshold and into the parlor before James sent him away with a pointed look.
Monty hooked a pinky around his finger as they took in the hustle and bustle of Platform 9 & ¾. James took a cleansing breath. Ron and Hermione flanked them, disguised as a nondescript strawberry-blond couple, and a multitude of Aurors were scattered about the platform (or so James was told). Monty's hair was black, which looked strange and wrong against his skin.
Scorpius raised his teacup feebly but couldn't quite bring himself to toast to Slytherin this time.
"He won't talk about it anymore," she added sadly. "Not to me, anyway."
“Healer Malfoy, I’d like to re-introduce you to someone. This is James Charming.”
"Yeah."
s'what it is..."
"Ah, yes...of course, my apologies, I - "
Then again, he thought he’d matured enough over the years to follow at least one measly order from an overwrought Auror, so he obliged and left the mail on the table until she could check it for tampering.
"We scheduled some private sessions with an Apparation instructor so this won't happen again," Hermione said as if that solved it all.
They were high up, eye-level with most of the action. Camera flashes lit up the glass walls of their box almost constantly, but James had plenty of breathing room. The game was incredible. Ron brought along a few vintage omnioculars, apparently their own from the Quidditch World Cup years ago, and they all passed them around gleefully while watching the Harpies thrash Puddlemere.
Draco was glad Blaise had left and there were no witnesses to this momentous occasion. His cheeks turned pink and he tried to remember how to accept compliments.
. Monty knew too well what it was like to lose family; he couldn't live with himself if he let James turn his own away. And the boys deserved a family too.
"Leggo!"
, let - let me OUT, LET ME OUT!" his all-too-familiar plea is broken by crumbling sobs. The man's arms wrap around him and he smells like the outside world, like
"Yes," he says with a stiff nod. "Exactly like that." Draco opens his mouth to carry himself to victory but Potter interrupts. "I judged Slytherins, too," he blurts out. "Before I was sorted, I heard Voldemort—" Draco rears back on reflex "—came from Slytherin, and then I saw you sorted there so I decided to have nothing to do with it. I judged the whole lot."
"Adam, stop this now. You have your lessons here, where it's safe."
Potter looks pale, woozy. Perhaps he’s still dozy from dinner. It was a marvelous dinner. Draco snatches his sleeve and hauls him over to the dinky table laden with dessert, thinking he might as well keep Potter awake a while longer so he doesn’t have to fall asleep alone in a strange place. Besides, he can't very well make Potter sleep on the floor in his current state; that would just be bad form. He props up Potter’s lanky frame in the corner, reaching for a platter of little cakes swimming in sticky strawberry syrup. Potter sways and Draco grabs a wrist to steady him. Skin touches skin and the room flushes with warmth.
"You'd prefer he stay here?" growled Weasley. Draco jerked around to face him, eyes wide.
"Yes, that." Harry was already re-reading the stiff, formal,
He was a thrice-damned professional.
"Right. And you're suggesting…" He looks around at their little room. "You're suggesting that this is our oven?" Potter swallows. Draco tracks the movement of his throat. A bead of sweat trickles around his Adam's apple, collecting in a little pool under his t-shirt collar, and he wants to lick it off those sharp collarbones.
12:59 pm
"James?" he called, testing the handle. It didn't budge. James tossed the wand back in his sock drawer and climbed into bed. "James, please..."
If you've enjoyed this fic, please consider leaving a comment. If you've already left a comment, please know that I've read it 100-billion times, I just suck at summoning the spoons to give you the response you so deserve. I'm notorious for replying months and months too late. So...you have that to look forward to, I guess!
Harry shook his head, glancing at Monty who hesitated for a long moment. Once he got going, however, it became apparent that he was telling more than what Harry meant for him to say:
James swallowed as he flipped through the twenty-page document. Numbers based on two weeks of in-house sales, which were shoddily tracked from the start and taken during their busiest season. Inventory and stock, which were stolen from their personal groceries, whatever they had on hand in the kitchen to get Monty started that first week. Renovation estimates based on the existing shop's restoration, which didn't account for knocking out a wall in their kitchen to connect the old boutique to Charming Chocolates.
Remus adjusted himself in the rickety old chair. “We’ve discussed - “
But it was too late. Arthur was clearly in the planning phase already and James just had to hope all ink stayed off his son's skin until he was older and a bit less stupid.
Falling for It
From across the Great Hall, Potter smirks at Draco, smearing a stray bit of chocolate over his lip.
"Cormac McLaggen. I've been in Sporting Goods for three years now. Actually, I want to expand what we do here, start up some fitness classes - "
(See the end of the chapter for
"A pattern that didn't make sense for the purchaser, who was already well past puberty, and supposedly childless for almost twenty years…" Hermione straightened up, tucking her ankles under her thighs. "He was acting rather shifty when we questioned him, and I - er, well, he

"What year did you graduate?" Terry asked, eyes narrowing. Harry tried to keep his answer light and casual.
" - performed in Glasgow - "
"Just say no, kiddo," Nott said darkly. Alec ducked back behind James to avoid his gaze.
Warmth beyond sunshine flooded Harry and he couldn't help the little smile that stole over his face. They'd never lost their urgency to find him -
the problem, the bullheaded arse!
, he said simply, not knowing what sort of game his sons were playing.
And Malfoy was picking, picking, picking. He made pointed comments about Monty's absence, Monty's personality, Monty's
"Draco didn't mention it to you?" Hermione asked delicately. Harry ruffled up his hair in the back and blinked up at the sky. It was beyond his comprehension how soft the pink fluffy clouds looked against hard streaks of white in the distance, all of it joining in a warm golden glow. The majesty of it stole his words, but he'd gladly give it everything he had in a steady worship that could carry him through the rest of his new life.
"What of it?!" Draco finally broke.
“I’m looking for romance,” Pansy says pointedly.
"You can't rush art, kid..."
Draco pushed his mother gently away and opened his mouth for Tony to cautiously approach and deposit three drops of Veritaserum. His eyes glazed over and his face went slack. Narcissa eased him back down to the loveseat.
But opening another shop, a huge expansion that would tie Monty and him together as business partners… Sirens were going off in James's head, screaming at him to shut it down. He went through hell to get Charming Chocolates on its feet; he started in the kitchen of his run-down flat on the other side of town, painstakingly scraping together everything he had to put a deposit down on this place.
That last one got through. Just for a moment, it broke through that blank face and lit a fire in James's eyes. Just for a moment, Monty was sure that they would fight this out properly and James might be arsed to see someone else's side for once. But then he shut down, as he had yesterday. He snatched up his cane, leaving his wand behind, and retreated upstairs.
"Bye."
“Alright, kick off!” Ginny called, taking off on her own Rosco 7.
Suddenly the gingerbread cottage seems rather less tantalizing, and the witch sees his trepidation. She nods her head sadly, then keeps nodding as if she can't stop.
look. One of his boys was deathly afraid of cats, he knew that much, he had just temporarily mixed up which one it was. "Well, he says this one's alright," Arty amended.
He gave a sensual moan.
(See the end of the chapter for
"As he said," she began, "it was a tumultuous time in our world. Harry was in the thick of it, he was on everyone's list, and that
“DON’T!” Harry stood, whirling around and reaching towards the Healer as if he could stop her by simply flapping his hand about. It seemed to work, but maybe she’d just listened to him. He was still getting used to people doing that.
"I don't like to waste food," Potter says, picking over the wide array of dessert with glee. "You never know when you might go hungry."
The Aurors were treating it as a poisoning, an attempted murder, possibly an assassination attempt given James's recent political endeavours. The words swirled around in Monty's head while James regained his color and started whinging.
Harry returned to his seat, limping all the way and giving Alec a squeeze on his shoulder as he passed. Arthur sat next to his brother and then Harry started back into his sign language.
Arty was fully crying now as he pressed his tear-streaked face into the cat's wrinkled skin. James pressed his own face into his son's hair, trying to...to push some sort of comforting energy at him, anything to help him where words couldn't. They stood there for a long moment, James's arms around a sniffling Arthur whose arms were cradling a grumbling cat.
"Settle," he grunted in his partner's direction. Tony's hands fell away from his robe snaps and clenched at his sides. Everyone took energy potions differently and Auror Goldstein, it seemed, was one who indulged his nervous ticks.
"Who?" Draco looked between him and the knee-high snowy owl made out of actual snow. A couple brown pebbles from the garden for the eyes, some twigs stuck into the bottom for the feet, the wings were lopsided but the right size and shape... It - it was Hedwig!
"Can you speak, Mr. Charming?"
Draco smirked deviously and braced his forearms against the table, leaning into Harry's space once more.
"Yeah."
And now the dynamic duo were pushing the limit on energy potions - even Malfoy had flashed a look of concern when he and Tony arrived with Harry that morning. But they were closing in and Ron could practically taste victory after twelve long years!
"I confirmed it myself with Forensics," Unspeakable Zabini said. "It's a clean match. Or as clean as it'll get - not much of it left."
"Don't even bother with that
Which left Harry, who had next to no experience in the adult Muggle world, abruptly asking Draco Malfoy out to a London pub.
James shrugged and Monty answered without hesitation, "Montague, Nott, and Vane."
His skull is mushy and he can feel his heartbeat up there. When he pokes a finger to the injury, he nearly passes out again. Ben is on the bed next to him when he comes to, long legs stretched out the length of the mattress with a storybook open on his lap. Harry's eyes go hot and blurry. He whimpers. A few tears leak out. He feels so small under the ache.
“Weasel didn’t tell you?” Draco leaned forward. He felt sure Weasley would have given James a heads up about any attack that was meant to gather information on him. No wonder he wasn’t carrying his wand on him, he couldn’t know how serious the threat was if he hadn’t known about Draco’s attack!
, he huffed. James shook his head but the unconscious little shrug he added did nothing for his defense. James was glad that Monty had his back to their lone customer so she couldn't see his sour expression.
James nodded, his vision swimming. He was dimly aware of Rachel sighing impatiently.
Ron rolled his eyes, knowing exactly how that conversation would've gone.
“Just use the spell,” she rasped, flicking her wand. The grater in his hand came to life and started shredding the chocolate bar he was working on.
"Is there room in your hovel?" Draco asked, not unkindly though Narcissa seemed appalled.
Ron also saw that Harry had sampled too much of the coffee cake, which was criminally delicious, a possible source of the jitters, and apparently Harry's new favorite food. Which Monty may or may not have (but definitely had) noticed. The Scottish man, Ron observed, took great pride in offering everyone a piece except Malfoy, who couldn't seem to care less. Blaise and Dean hit it off right away while Seamus attempted to rekindle his easy friendship with Monty, who was much too distracted to notice.
"Is that...?" The woman was struck dumb.
Now he's screaming himself hoarse.
"Ach!" He pulled a hand through the blubbery half-dried paint that was smeared across his trousers now. "Oh well, need to feed the cat anyway..."
"See, that's something a racist says!"
Mouth dry, Harry nodded.
It was a conspiracy, he insisted to Kim while they paced the perimeter of Hogsmeade.
Remus could feel McGonagall's annoyance with him permeating the air.
James couldn't bring himself to do anything. He had done enough. He sat uselessly in his soaked clothes in their sopping bed in their flooded bedroom and waited for Monty to do something.
“Why, my sweets, you’re wasting away!” she cries out, sounding withered and old once more. Her voice cuts across Draco’s mind like a knife and he feels a stab of concern—
"This is the original store, ma'am. It opened at this location in 1979."
"There's a report in your file," he began, voice shaking but hand steady as he offered the thick folder over to Charming, "detailing the train incident. Would you say it's accurate?"
"UP!" he yelps, flailing against the dead weight on top of him. Like a spatula pressing on a sausage, Potter is pushing him into the searing hot bricks. Draco's sweat-slicked back spits, sizzles, and steams in the worst, most grisly, disgusting, offensive, grotesque—"UP, POTTER!
, he said, his fingers sharp and hard.
"Those two are at each other's throats all hours... I'm surprised there've been no actual punches thrown. When Harry and I were - "

"And you're supplying a bit of poison to help them along?" Blaise quipped as he eyed the three rows of twenty blue vials and three rows of ten green vials.
"Conjure a space for yourself where you feel safe," Pansy continued after some time. "The temperature is just right. Maybe there's a fire going, or maybe it's all from the sunlight streaming through the windows..."

pathetically against the iron and fall to the floor. Potter draws his knees up to his chest and hides his face, folding his arms over his head.
He knew Arthur was right and he hated him a little bit for it. He was being a stubborn, prideful cunt. But he couldn't bare another Prophet article proclaiming Draco his knight in shining armor, saving him from heartbreak, showing him how pureblood wizards treated their own, showing the world how Muggle relationships were doomed to fail.
I hope you like it!! I was really excited to post so this has not been proof-read yet.
Arthur said with an impatient sigh.
"Right. Soggy." Potter firms his jaw again and ducks his gaze to fumble with his fly. The trousers hit the floor and Draco tries, he really does, but he just can't
But there he was, shivering in a jacket too thin for kneeling in an open field in February, his gloveless hands wrapped around a simple black velvet box.
any of this, it all fits together, makes sense. He just doesn't want it."
"They're long-gone," Malfoy said far too kindly, the twit, apparently under the impression that he had a dire phobia of snakes.
“But not me. I can hold my own without Saint Potter and the Cart that has Never Been Greased, thank you very much.”
Still reeling, Harry tried to imagine that special space in his mind's eye becoming a reality well before Christmas. It was beyond his wildest imagination - and he had quite the imagination - but he couldn't help the thought that Draco was keeping some vital information close to his chest.
, he said.
"Jeepers, Da'..." Beside him, leaning against his own bed, Arthur mimicked James's pose and put a hand on his chest with his feet splayed out on the mattress. James huffed a laugh.
Tony and Nott seemed to understand what had been said. In one motion, Nott threw Arthur at Draco, who grunted in his dazed state on the loveseat but wrapped his arms around him protectively, still as strong as ever. James grabbed Alec in a bruising grip, shoving him past the table and into Narcissa's waiting arms, who caught him around the middle and held tight.
"I'm sorry," Harry tried again. The fine layer of sawdust he'd disturbed was floating in the air between them, coating his throat and making it all that much harder to get the words out. "I'm
“Red,” she repeats, making a note without looking at the paper. “Anything else to add, Mrs. Flamel?”
Face clinically straight, Harry merely raises his brows, a picture of innocent curiosity.
for it.”
"Yeah, mate," Ron said, grinning.
“Maybe they should give it a go for once,” Blaise said out of the corner of his mouth, perfectly audible to James. “Might spend a bit less time in Azkaban after the next war if they could learn to swallow their pride for - ”

"Got it in one."
It was warm, and wet, and soft, and sweeter than the sugar crystals on a Pop-Tart.
"He motivates me, you know? Keeps me going strong. I do a good ten reps, then Ron walks in and suddenly I can do twelve!"
, James replied curtly.
Monty nodded without hesitation.
That was a much better use of his Saturday night than eating dinner alone with his parents.
of the chair—
"Monty," Seamus said by way of explanation.
Harry shifted Hugo onto his hip, earning a warning whimper as he hurried to point out one particular line.
James couldn't remember when he'd been suffused with such energy. The boys were back home, Monty was still stubborn but at least quiet about it, Draco had joined them again on Saturday - without Blaise this time! Not that James had anything against Blaise. But like a security blanket, it was a big deal to leave behind the implied "plus-one" on the invitation.
monstrosity under Al's bed, pulling his screeching boys with him. Where was his wand, what was blowing sparks at them -
His eyes zeroed in on the iron firepoker in a stand at the hearth across the room.
The thrice-damned room gets hotter.

"First things first," Hermione said, straightening in her seat. "You need to hire someone to mind the counter so you can get back to the kitchen."
or something. He wondered if the bartender would slide the drinks down the counter from the other end.
“You’re talking about me like I’m some sad, lonely little latchkey kid who can’t make friends - “
"So 'e does," Monty conceded, relaxing slightly. "Is that your man there?" he asked casually, pointing a thick finger to a small framed photo that hung on the wall next to the stairway. Remus stepped a bit awkwardly through the opening of the counter and peered at the photo curiously, only to feel his stomach drop out of him.
, says he has a lot of
"And you're a specialist now, hidden away in the dark recesses of the Janus Thickey Ward," Blaise went on, maintaining that infuriatingly innocent tone. "Why would Potter go to you for a limp?"
James relented finally.
Harry signed with a frown, his wand spewing forth the gold smoke in a testament to his rising temper.
"Sometimes you gotta call it," Ron went on. Hermione wasn't sure she agreed but she knew she hated herself for promising Arthur that they would sort it out. James's back raised and lowered under her hand as he took deep, purposeful breaths.
Harry went on and Alec said: "You visit families often?"
The twins' bedroom door was ajar and James's heart sank when he heard it: a distinct and unmistakable meow.
Arthur thumped miserably downstairs. They still had to work, of course, even if everything felt wrong without Monty. The chocolates wouldn't make themselves and while Dad would let them off if they made their case, Alec would never let Arthur skive.
"Cedric, it's fine," Harry murmurs, but it isn't heard through the crowd.
Monty sighed in a long-suffering way that made Remus think he was trying to sound more put-upon than he actually was, before nodding. Remus went to let himself out the front door but only succeeded in crashing into it before remembering to turn the lock. With a parting wave at the little family that watched him -
"Aw, tha’s the real end tae the jam incident," Monty said, waving a dismissive hand. "Manager let ‘im finish his shift then cut ‘im loose. Said it were a lot of bad publicity an’ she needed tae do somethin’ tae ease the customers’ minds. A reckon she was worried what the neighborhood would think, all those policemen fussin’ all night, draggin’ a brown man outa the store in the wee hours. But James needed a push anyway, an' he does better as his own boss. Plus the nanny wouldn' come back after twenty-four hours wae these two!"
He kisses his fingers with a flourish, as a chef might. “Just perfect.”
"Weasley - Human Resources Weasley - "
“Daddy!” the boy whined. Harry flinched.
“I’m not lonely while you two are at work, if that’s what you’re thinking,” Harry offered, hoping Sirius would come down soon and change the subject. “I’ve already got more comp--”
"How did you recover your memories?" Robards asked, not looking particularly interested in the answer. Draco had caught him on his way out the door when he came in, bald and shaking and dripping in slug slime, demanding his undivided attention. It had probably been a long day for him.
Dinner came and went, the boys carried on in their room, and Monty - bless him - jerked his head upstairs, telling him to take the bed. James had hardly exchanged a dozen words with the man since Monday's row, and he wouldn't apologize for what he'd said. But he was so wiped he couldn't even summon up the energy to lament his pride as he half-crawled upstairs. Monty could have this one. James was tired.
It certainly wasn't about Potter's cool rejection at the start of their first year. For Merlin's sake, they were children back then. He shouldn't have gone after the Weasel right off the bat like that, and Lord Potter, Conquering Savior and God of Merciful Wizengamot Testimonies, should have given Draco's shitty eleven-year-old manners a second chance.
Harry handed Hugo over, looking troubled.
"First year, remember?" Potter breathes in plain veneration. "That's what she should've had."
The Eighth Years share a common room on the fourth floor. Potter and the Weasel have the dorm across from Draco and Blaise. Not everyone is quite so lucky with their pairings; Pansy is putting on a good show of stoicism, but Draco can see she is positively terrified of Granger (for good reason).
"Arrested."
And then Helen's attempt to murder him had put James in hospital for half a day. He was released, ordered to pour his old potions down the sink and wait for new ones. After just twenty-four hours on his old Muggle pills, James realized two things:
, he repeated more forcefully.
Draco takes pride in his bedroom efforts.
“Can you describe them?” Minerva asks in a bored tone, flipping to a blank page on her clipboard.
“Awful people who don’t understand the craft, fools piddling about,” she says. “They’ve given it a cursed reputation. I hope you won’t condemn
, and
Harry couldn't catch a break.
“Too clever, yeah.” He nods, apparently happy to agree. "So what'd you find out, Mr. Bond?"
Its versatility and addictive quality made a fortune for sellers, but their customers never lasted long. The build up of toxins in an addict's body was quick, painful, and lethal. Recovery was long, painful, and often lethal.
He couldn't wait to usher the little weirdo out of his office.
"The Cannons are playing tomorrow," Astoria said brightly.
"I wasn't - I realize I wasn't much assistance today, but the potion..."
She screams again.
he recites. It's an old saying from some childhood book, or perhaps a song…
James cocked his head and squinted. He was every bit his photo in the Prophet last summer - the one in which he looked like a confused pigeon.
A noise from the alley sent Rachel rocketing to her feet, but James carried on with his work.
James felt his carbonara turn to cement in his stomach.
It was brilliant.
"Love potion, eh?" Monty said, leering suggestively at Harry.
"Thank you ever so much for having us over," Astoria gushed, beaming. She took a biscuit (also imaginary) from the proffered plate and took a small (imaginary) bite, humming her delight.
Arthur winced and within moments another set of feet thumped down the stairs, a bit more gracefully this time. An identical boy - brown skin, black hair, wide eyes - dressed in more muted colors stopped at the bottom step, taking in the destruction on the floor with obvious distress.
"What was that?!" Monty shrieked, staring at the disaster James had caused.
"I dunno, it just seems...cramped?" for the house in Kent, though the ocean view was tempting.
So.  That's that.  Now we can move forward with memories and Drarry.  And plot, of course.  Always need a dash of plot!
1:46pm
Draco closed his eyes and hummed his pleasure around the chocolate truffle, relishing how his front teeth sank through the firm outer shell and into the soft ganache within.
shop. He should be grateful to have someone to share his shop with. To share his life with. Malfoy had told him once that Harry Potter was an arrogant git with his head firmly planted up his own arse. James was determined to not let that Potter pride ruin things.
"You'll have to prove it was me," Harry is quick to reason.
"No wonder the boys latched ontae ye," Monty said a bit awkwardly before turning back around to wave at Ginny as she passed.
Mr. James was studying both of them closely and Scorpius felt his face heat up.
the long-time enemy who would be poking around in Harry Potter's most traumatic and sensitive memories. He had the scars to prove how terrible that plan was, and yet…
"James woke in hospital several years ago without a clue. Couldn' remember 'is name, couldn' walk or talk. They found 'im on the street, all banged up, no identification."
"By ten points!" Daddy's voice went high like it sometimes did when he was upset, but he was grinning too.
he signed down the table to Alec, who ducked his head and shrugged. He grunted. The boy lifted his head but avoided his gaze by resting his elbows on the table and picking at his sleeves. Monty snorted. He wasn't James. The boys couldn't just ignore him by refusing to look in his direction; he had a voice. A bloody loud one. "Alexander!"
Ron appears out of nowhere, sweaty and covered in chalk. He ushers people back, strategically placing himself closer to Viktor. In a whirlwind of activity - flailing hands, shouted questions - Draco and Viktor disappear through the crowd, leaving Harry standing alone among the maxi-dresses.
" Arthur grumbled as he read the details of the Curse. He threw out his Wizard's protective gear, all but the Plus 1 Hat, and recounted his strength.
"The final blow?" Arthur asked breathlessly, looking between the photo and his dad with wild eyes. Harry was back to absently tracing patterns on the tabletop, stiff with unease as he listened.
said?” Harry takes one last bite and begins to shove everything back into the paper bag.
Ah. Draco adjusts himself. Harry asks if this is okay and Draco gives him his very best sneer. When he's cooled off, he pulls Harry back in. They touch. All those places that aren't sexual but still somehow forbidden without trust. Harry craves his touch and Draco delights in teaching him a thing or two about a proper weave of limbs. It gets a bit ridiculous – he's not sure where his left leg is or how Harry's arm is simultaneously behind and in front of him – and they tease and banter just the same. Harry's skin is still the same, still scruffy on the jaw and calloused on the hands. He can still hear Harry's heart beating against his firm chest, but it's not pounding in anticipation of...something. He can still meet those fiery green eyes, though there's something more in his gaze now. Something excited, and that makes Draco feel excited – not in his pants, Merlin forbid, but in his own eyes.
No promises that I'll post next week since I clearly can't be trusted with a deadline, but I'll give it a shot!
"Yer foolin' round, aren't ye?! No one jus' - no one invites their therapist to a game, James! A woke up at midnight an' ye were gone. You've been up all fuckin' night workin' on a little
At the edge of the herd, he suddenly regrets riling Potter's temper. He dreads the moment Potter goes for the low blow, the moment he brings up the fact that it's Draco's fault all the Eighth Years can see the creatures. The moment the fire burns him.
Arthur drifted off around the time the Doctor reunited with the TARDIS and took off into another dimension or whatever.
“Ginny,” he says, his face splitting into a wide grin. He gallantly offers her an arm as they head for the employee stairwell.
"Why a little?" she pressed. He shrugged pitifully, then said:
1 bed, 1 bath
"Thank you, Minerva." He smiled warmly, digging a ginger snap from the proffered tin. "What can I do for you?" he asked as he bit in.
"Dad?" Arthur said gently. The living room was lit only by what was left of the tree's string lights. The multi-colored lights did little to cheer up the room; they threw shadows everywhere and made Dad look gaunt and creepy when he looked up at him from his position on the sofa. Arthur took a fortifying breath. "Can ye sleep in ours tonight?"
he hisses, clasping a hand to his smarting bicep. "You pinched me!"
couldn't begin to cover it.
James gritted his teeth and rolled out from the pallet, crashing into the blanket wall and tearing down the whole contraption. The boys cried out and whined sleepily as pillows and cushions came crashing down on top of them, and still James kept rolling out to sea, wrapping himself in the sheet that was once their canopy.
It didn't seem a complete sentence, but he offered nothing more.
the ingredients, the magic. Just as one must know the soil in which the herbs grow. To cook and eat magic is to—why, it's to renew life when it would otherwise expire! To heal, not to drive mad.” Her voice doesn’t sound so weak anymore. Draco thinks it’s beautiful how the old crone seems to come alive when she speaks of her passion. Her art. “My mother taught me the delicate balance between…”
Looking at the damage Lucius Malfoy had caused, however, Ron wondered if house arrest would be enough.
“I’m a Healer,
"I, er… I don't have a phone," Harry admitted. The eavesdropping Muggles were briefly overcome by incredulity and Harry sent them an annoyed glare.
Harry Potter squinted at him suspiciously from one of the three guest chairs in Draco’s office. The look was almost identical to a million green-eyed glares Draco had received in Hogwarts. But it was an empty, vague suspicion. Draco hid his smirk. Potty had nothing on him now and, even better, he couldn’t even remember the days when Draco truly was up to no good. Granger claimed that he only had a tenebrous recollection of some “blond git,” and Draco took no small amount of pride in the fact that he had been remembered in the desolate landscape of Potter’s memories.
"Er - "
