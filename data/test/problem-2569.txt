“I’m going to throw up” Ron winced.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
“Do you realize that every day we have them in front of us? To believe that they do it on purpose” He growled, wincing.
Without paying more attention to him, Malfoy grabbed the shirt hanging on the edge of the shower before gracefully donning it and meticulously closing the buttons.
He winced as he watched them through the mirror and sighed before their faded and too cold side.
Potter’s skin burned him, consumed him with pleasure, his lips were soft and warm, his tongue embracing his was moist and his taste was incredibly tasty. Draco’s muscles suddenly contracted as his fingers sank into the flesh of Harry’s shoulders and he was struck by a lightning orgasm.
Harry sighed when Malfoy’s tongue forced the way between his lips to come embrace his own. He dropped his wand and grabbed Malfoy’s shoulders of his two hands, holding them tightly so as not to fall under the effect of the kiss.
“So let’s see where you are today” she declared, standing right beside him, making complicated moves of the wand to cast her diagnostic spell.
Malfoy turned his attention to his book, completely ignoring him while Harry kept looking at him, hypnotized by his way of liquefying him from within with a simple glance.
” made Malfoy’s dragging voice, while a small white light came out of his wand and reached his wound which closed immediately.
Realizing that it was ridiculous to block so on the silhouette of his roommate, he turned away his eyes, squeezing harder the handle in his hand, making the knuckles of his fingers bleach.
"What the hell were you going to ask me at the end?" he spits, his patience definitely dead.
bed waiting like a soul in pain to be delivered from his punishment, when he could have helped Ron find what he was looking for.
At least, that’s what he thought.
He smashed his fist across the wall, ripping out a cry of pain. It was stupid, but he needed it. He had to feel something other than the pleasure that had overwhelmed him by letting himself be touched by this asshole.
“You should know that when it comes to Defence Against the Dark Arts, I am particularly attentive”
This evening didn't end badly if you count the fact that it had really started badly…
Draco could see the foggy gaze of his lover staring at him with envy, guessing that his own had to experience the same feelings.
“Well, what’s the problem? You’re going to keep pissing me off or are you going to take care of my cock?” Harry shouted.
And Potter was the only one who had succeeded in this masterstroke.
He wanted to turn around, but two hands grabbed his arms to stop him. He felt his heart beat in his ears and tried to focus on any noise that might help him identify the person behind him.
"Memory Charm?" he asked in a breath, still hoping that this would not be the case.
“Yes, there is an unusual way to cast a spell, but I read somewhere that you can attach a tempus spell that determines the exact time you want it to act.” she explained, tightening her grip on Ron’s hands.
Harry blinked his eyes, not realizing what he had just witnessed and realized that he had stopped breathing, so he took a deep breath before exhaling long in silence.
Harry could feel his heart beating in his chest as he watched him.
Nevertheless, Draco was convinced that Scarhead was the cause of the peace that reigned between the Slytherins and the other students of their class. Saint Potter had worked on his behalf, recounting the facts as he had been told, that Draco had been used by the Dark Lord to carry out a mission against his will.
Harry took a few seconds to calm the frantic heartbeat and regain normal breathing before putting his glasses back on his nose. They had moved during the fiery kiss they had exchanged and Malfoy’s prominent cheekbones had left some traces.
The twin laughed before bringing them into the building.
Spreading his fingers, he released his fork, whose imprint was still visible in the hollow of his palm, having pressed it too firmly while he cursed Malfoy during his reflections.
Evening at dinner, he got better, he smiled at the jokes his friends told him to make him react. And it worked. So, Harry loosened his hand a little off Ginny’s. And when the group got up to go to bed, she made him understand that she wanted him.
Harry looked for Malfoy without finding him.
Harry saw him think very strongly, but his wand remained firmly in his hand. His friend sighed with despair and glanced at Harry who smiled at him.
He sighed at what appeared to be Harry’s anxiety attack. He knew his temper, for he often bore the brunt of it when they were younger. Once had been one too many and had almost killing him.
Malfoy raised a skeptic eyebrow.
Harry did not have time to answer him that most of the students had already gathered around the table to admire his work and made him uncomfortable to attract so much attention again.
Potter’s cheeks were slightly colored before his eyes went up, until they deviated on his left arm and sprang in amazement.
He disrupted the sixteen-year-old Harry who fought to keep his own feelings, seeking to get over that terrible passion that he desperately wanted to keep from feeling. Annihilating his chances of invading him, to engulf him and never let him go again.
“Stop that!”
He reopened them, blocking his breath in his chest and leaned forward, between Malfoy’s legs, moving forward his face to his own and kissed him passionately.
Maybe he just imagined it after all and didn’t have to worry about the confused feelings that were rushing inside him when he was thinking about Malfoy and his fucking grey eyes.
“How are you, mate?” he asked, tapping his shoulder.
Harry swallowed as he watched them greedily, retracing their form and the small lines streaking Malfoy’s thin mouth. He could hear the beating of his heart echoing in his ears as he opened his lips and let a warm, heavy breath escape.
“No Har… Potter, the only one to blame is the one who put you in this state,” Malfoy said, in a strangely low voice.
A dangerous glare passed into Malfoy’s eyes, who instantly removed his hands from his waist and placed them on either side of his pelvis.
His breathing became more difficult to control, and his lungs forced him harder to let in the air he inhaled. Harry could feel his chest rising with difficulty as his gaze held firmly to Malfoy, who did not seem to see him.
“Unfortunately, I can’t answer that question. However, I can tell you about the potion that was used to charm them.”
Harry tensed up, waiting for the sequel, hoping it never came.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows and gauged him for a moment.
He closed his eyes when he felt his heart rise up in his chest thinking of that man for whom he had gave up everything.
"I’m leaving," Harry said, to conclude the conversation.
Taking a deep breath, he moved forward in front of the right cabinet, opening the glass delicately, and fingers trembling slightly, and pulled out a transparent vial where a small filament was floating inside.
He had always been good at sarcasm, maybe even the best in his house.
“Shut up, Malfoy, and just make me get a hit.” Harry hissed, giving him a deep pelvis blow that tore away a hoarse moan while his eyes were veiled with desire.
“Not anymore” Malfoy said, anchoring his eyes to the depths of his own.
“Good evening Harry” his soft voice made, from his seat whose backrest exceeded him by several meters.
Harry almost choked in his glass and had to wipe his mouth and chin with the back of his hand.
Harry had was then afraid to lose him at that moment, using everything he could think of to show him, to prove to him that he was serious, that he wanted to…
Harry had at first hesitated, still a little on the reserve when it came to getting back on a broom, then nodded and grabbed the broomstick, which he had placed between his legs, his heart beating with apprehension.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, who nodded, confirming that he could go. Harry stood up, stalking the young woman, before stopping and turning to see that Malfoy wasn’t following them.
Harry had foolishly thought that this treatment was exclusively for him. He was obviously mistaken…
“Take good care of him and don’t hesitate to contact us if necessary” he added.
"No," Harry replied, in a tone without appeal.
Too much Weasley, too much Potter. And Potter had changed so much…
“Uh… fine?”
That was offensive. Also weary, because if Malfoy no longer had as much interest in him as before, Harry felt the one who felt him for Malfoy, multiplying tenfold with the passing of days.
His heart pounded his chest, pounding excessively against his temples, preventing him from thinking correctly.
Harry swallowed with difficulty, his saliva forcing painfully to find the way in his throat.
"Now that we've clarified everything, can you please tell me what it is exactly?" persuading him to respond, with a gesture of the hand.
Harry didn’t understand why he had not moved, he could have thrown his fist in his face when Malfoy had approached him a little too closely, but his body had not reacted. At least not the way he would have wanted it.
Harry spread his eyes, horrified.
Because that's what he was doing, wasn't it? He was openly kidding him, there was no other explanation...
“Yeah…” he sighed, in a duller tone than he would have liked.
He felt Malfoy tense himself against him, contracting all his muscles, while Harry’s tongue rushed into his mouth to delight his taste which he loved so much.
He was handsome in his own way… For a boy… Harry was quick to think.
“Sorry, Harry, but even if you wanted to, you couldn’t do much…”
Harry also frowned, searching in his memory which song he might have been referring to.
Malfoy’s smile expands on one side in a grin distorted by a certain resentment.
“What’s going on, Potter? You act like it’s the first time you’ve ever put your cock inside me” Malfoy grinned, with his dragging voice.
“It didn’t seem to bother you that much when you were yelling at me to continue my little business…” Malfoy sneered, his eyes shining maliciously, crossing his arms on his bust.
“Hi, Tom. A glass of mead, please.” he blew, just loud enough that only the manager could hear him.
Music of the evening’s news flash rang out just above his head and Harry looked up to watch the wizard network.
“But what happens to you today to ask you questions like that?”
In his head, he saw the stranger with Noah’s face, stroking Malfoy’s cheek, before coming forward to seal their lips with a feverish kiss. A veil passed before his eyes, when his imagination went further, feigning a groan of Malfoy at this contact, making his fingers tremble with hatred.
ex-enemy.
“I wanted to hurt you too. Even though I hadn’t thought of going that far…” he replied, the end of his sentence desappearing in a breath.
Harry remained for a moment, his eyes staring at the ceiling, unable to move, the muscles of his body visibly having difficulty listening to him.
He hardly swallowed before carefully turning his head to meet the blurry faces of his best friends who stood at his bedside, framing him on either side of the bed.
Harry jumped into his bed, not having heard her arrive, and smiled at her, nodding.
Harry sighed and looked up at Malfoy.
And it hurt. It was pulling, rubbing and burning but somewhere, far behind the pain that was going through him, it was fucking good too. Harry felt his flesh stretch as pleasure gradually invaded him every time Malfoy’s fingers struck further inside him.
“Nevertheless, you must continue to see him, it’s important that you keep in mind that although his way of doing things displeases you, it really acts on your mind” Draco added, in a serious tone.
Harry raised his eyebrows.
“Yeah...not sure we have time for other activities...” Harry replied, detailing the days.
Malfoy drew furrows with his tongue on Harry’s thin skin, pressing his hand on his dick, making him moan with pleasure. Harry felt himself leaving, his desire grew under Malfoy’s wrist movements. He felt his legs fail but Malfoy grabbed him by the waist with his free hand to support him.
Neville had also contributed greatly to the battle by remaining in Hogwarts. Harry would never be grateful enough to him to have always been by his side in the dark moments since all these years.
"Why don’t you tell us what you’re doing in while you’re there!" he winced.
Ginny winced before displaying a plaintive pout.
“Your girlfriend is playing tonight, right?” Nott asked, in a smirk.
Harry laughed and grabbed the pillow by his side and threw it in his face.
"There was never any question of this between us, Potter..." replied Malfoy in a dragging voice.
Having no answer to his last reply, Malfoy finally turned his head in his direction.
Potter shuddered under the touch of his lips, while Draco’s tongue licked the salty taste of his sweat and revelled in its subtly spicy flavour.
But when did that asshole smile so much?
And then suddenly a distinct noise touched his ears, so he stood still to try to identify it. It was a breath. It was slow and quite weak but seemed deep enough for him to hear it so closely.
This had to be understood since Malfoy smirked and turned his eyes to him by raising a sarcastic eyebrow.
"Then, explain to me what you’re doing here, if you want everything to stop between us Potter?" he asked, skeptic.
Harry could have sworn to have seen Malfoy’s grey eyes flicker slightly but Malfoy stretched his smile further until he discovered his white teeth where a slight choked laugh escaped.
And he didn't have time to see the end of the scene, because Potter had just pulled him towards him, putting his lips on his to seal them with a violent kiss.
“Stop it, Malfoy! Whatever may have happened, you remain the dirty little Slytherin that I have always known” he jeered in a tone that was meant to be contemptuous.
"Hey, 'got Ron’s news. He’s coming tomorrow morning" Draco said, handing him the letter.
Harry had a bitter smile. Malfoy wasn’t wrong. You really had to be completely insane to want to kiss that fucking asshole! And for loving it, despite what he said!
“Pure blood family, I suppose.” Seamus jeered, between two sips of Butterbeer.
Harry licked his lips and cleared his throat before swallowing the excess saliva that was blocking his windpipe.
“I bet you come first.” Malfoy sneered, continuing his touching, more and more pronounced, planting his eyes full of promise in his own.
He nevertheless took the trouble to remove his glasses this time, delicately placing them on the night table before dropping his head against his pillow. He turned his eyes to the door, just in case the silhouette with Malfoy’s perfume had the idea of coming back to see him and fell asleep in just a few seconds at that last thought.
"Er... Well, to be perfectly honest, I was hoping that someone like you who hates me enough, would never have the idea to snog me, all traditions combined." He informed, unsure of himself after all.
Harry had a hard time admitting it, but a deep void had been created, since the moment Malfoy stopped looking at him.
"Oh? And why, I beg you?" Malfoy asked, in a grin.
He lowered his eyes to himself, noticing that he was not wearing pajamas as usual, but simply wearing black cotton underpants.
Harry, who had not let him out of his sight, took a moment to detail him.
“Of course, it’s me, Potter! You’re not as stupid to think they’re selling it, are you?” He hissed, swaying a little while his hand squeezed the edge of the table to hold.
"And can you please answer my question!" replied the Gryffindor in a sharp tone.
“No, this is my day off” Malfoy explained, putting a sling around his neck. “Hurry up, I think we’ve earned some fresh air.” He added, turning his face slightly, revealing a little smirk.
He felt useless, lying in his... in this
Harry opened wide his eyes.
The anger that growled in his belly silently from that noon spread throughout his body to sweat through all the pores of his skin. He was as effervescent and had no idea how to regulate this murderous sensation that was taking hold of him.
Harry blinked, seeming surprised.
Harry hardly turned his face towards him, frowning.
"Perfect, let’s go!" Neville replied, joyfully.
“That’s not what comes out when you’re together, sorry to tell you this but it really sounds like there’s a serious problem”
In fact, it was mostly Harry looking at him, one of the many things he couldn’t stop himself from doing... It was impossible for him to get Malfoy out of his fucking head! It had become an obsession... He thought he was done with this bullshit since the sixth year he had this obsession with Malfoy.
Except he wasn’t in the company of his two best friends, let alone waiting for his fiancée’s return. No, he was with the only person he never thought possible to have coffee in peace and serenity.
“I’m not looking at anybody.”
Dumbledore again lowered his head forward to look over his glasses in half-moons.
He could not help thinking that he and Malfoy also had nothing in common and that absolutely everything opposed them, and yet…
He swallowed hardly by staring at the now closed door where the unknown man who had come was standing, watching him? See how he was?
It was not for her that he shouted, but for Malfoy… He had a hard time concentrating again, but he had finally managed to do it… His thoughts for Malfoy disgusted him, but Harry realized that deep down, he wanted him.
“Huh? But you-”
"You’re not serious? You honestly think I cared if I was going to hurt your face or if you were going to faint when I hit you? "Don’t you think I was trying to force you to stop your bullshit so you don’t kill us all?"
"Thanks" Harry replied, passing a hand through his hair, an embarrassed smile, by so much effusion from his friend.
Once inside, they went up to the fourth floor of treatment of spell damage services as Harry had expected for having been there in his fifth year.
He had taken the time to rest it and close his file before slowly lifting his blue lagoon eyes into those of Draco, in a piercing gaze.
Harry followed his long hands to straighten the sides of his cape so that they fully adhered to his robe and smooth the few folds that had formed there.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow, seeming to weigh the pros and cons, then turned his attention to his scroll and began writing again.
She passed her hand in her hair to take it back, directly sending him a slight scent of flower that he so enjoyed. Harry quietly inspired her scent, which immediately relaxed him. He was fully aware of his feelings for Ginny and despite Malfoy, his feelings did not seem to have diminished.
His leg being still too stiff, he failed to stand and fell forward without any means of avoiding it.
His almost white blonde hair flew slightly in the wind. His head back, his eyes closed, his mouth half open that let out some groans. His breath became more and more erratic as the body leaning over him maltreated his neck with hot kisses.
"Who talked of killing each other, our friend Potter just seems to want to chat," Malfoy said, without leaving Harry’s eyes.
Draco felt his whole body tense with apprehension. His face was just a few inches from the one of Potter who was staring at him, his hand moving slowly to his to interlace their fingers. He lowered his eyes to their folded hands and fixed them for a moment before lifting them up to Potter’s face, puzzled.
He had to be sure…
And Potter, he was leaving, he was going away and he wouldn't have his answer… It was inconceivable, he needed his fucking answer!
Harry stared at him curiously as he moved his eyes across his entire face. He remembered that Malfoy had always had the fine features, but some angles came out sharper when he was a teenager. Despite the cold look he regularly wore, his facial features had softened and made him less inaccessible than when they were children.
“You’re not going to leave me alone with...
Harry, who had seen him coming, rushed to him to steal his lips, thus preventing him from finishing his sentence. His mouth stuck to Malfoy’s, he accentuated the kiss by moving a little to force him to lay his head on his pillow.
“No, Malfoy, you don’t understand...” he retorted, getting closer, staring at his grey eyes.
Harry followed him with his eyes and saw him settle next to a group of people he immediately recognized. He was surprised not to have seen them earlier when Malfoy bent over to kiss Parkinson’s cheek and shake Goyle’s hand to end with a light embrace with Zabini.
Passing through the kitchen, he noticed that Potter had washed everything, plates and cutlery resting on the edge of the sink draining.
Malfoy laid his eyes on it again, painfully.
They went back to Florean Fortescue to order a sorbet each and Malfoy proposed to go and taste it in a park a little further to avoid the too insistent glances of some passers-by who had recognized them both.
And that, Harry couldn’t stand.
He had a startle, but without removing his fingers which held firmly the edges of the Pensieve, clinging more than reason not to fall under the shock.
Harry felt Malfoy’s soft hands go through his bust, then his back and he in turn wanted to discover Malfoy’s body. He lowered his hands directly to Malfoy’s hips and quickly lifted Malfoy’s shirt to redesign his muscles with his fingertips. He sailed up to his back, pressing his shoulder blades and retracing his spine.
to see Malfoy again.
me, not to
He knew that Malfoy had never been a Death Eater now, and despite the actions of his father against him and his friends, he could not determine how he was perceived to be walking around with the son of an ex-Voldemort supporter.
“I don’t know how that person got it and how she got it through the school, but it’s a particularly rare process.”
After one last tremor, the elevator doors opened and he stormed out, determined to face Malfoy. He was advancing in the dark and bright corridors that he had already passed through during his adolescence. He did not have a fond memory of the times when he found himself walking around these places and had difficulty understanding how Malfoy could spend his days working here.
"See, nothing left," he said, showing his immaculate hand, a little reassuring smile in the corner of his lips.
“Cause you honestly believe that I’m going to sit here and do nothing while you go and smash some Death Eaters?” Harry spit out, obviously out of him.
He suddenly plunged his hand into a pocket of his trousers to pull out a long silver chain where his pocket watch was attached.
And it was all the more frustrating.
Harry’s fury could be felt from miles away, as his magic spread between the walls, sending tingling tickles to Draco’s skin.
Harry had just asked him to stop teasing him as he had been doing since the beginning of the year.
Harry gradually removed Malfoy’s hand from his sex, delicately placing it on the sheets, exerting a slight pressure on it and gave him a determined gaze.
So, they resumed their position, Harry’s legs not totally on the bed, Malfoy above him and their bodies rubbed against each other, making them moan together with so much shared pleasure.
For any answer, Harry looked down on him, really didn’t like the idea that someone like him was so informed about himself.
Draco sighed, surreptitiously closing his eyes, quickly reopening them to anchor them painfully in the piercing green ones of Harry.
He looked at these lips for a moment, thinking of what he would like to do to them, and leaned slightly to narrow the gap between them. While closing his eyes, he stuck his mouth against Malfoy’s and relaxed all his muscles, releasing his arm that held his wand to bring it back to his side. He felt Malfoy’s hand sticking to his neck to accentuate the kiss and thus stick him even more to him.
, it’s stupid!” Hermione shouted, glaring at him.
“Oh no, I’m not going to fucking shut up and you know why? Because even though I’m scared to death, I know how I feel.”
Draco then undertook to look for Harry, starting with the kitchen, imagining that he might have had a little hunger but here, nothing had been disturbed.
, but nothing in Harry seemed to attract Malfoy’s attention to linger on him.
He then raised one of his arms and handed him a brown accordion-shaped backrest. Harry stared at the file for a moment before looking up at Malfoy and raising his eyebrows as a question.
Malfoy shrugged shoulders before turning his head towards him, planting his grey eyes in his own.
Malfoy had then put the knife down and handed him half a loaf of bread spread, biting one bite into the other to show him that he had nothing to fear.
Potter gauged him for a moment before giving him a bad grin.
He was not entirely sure of this, but the probability that Malfoy had come to the infirmary that night had materialized without difficulty in his mind since the perfume had reached him.
“Potter? Are you going to sleep here, or walk me to the elevator?”
Harry sneered nervously before rising by pushing on his arms.
Harry rolled his eyes as he sighed and hardly hid the little smile that stretched his lips as he continued to move slowly towards the end of the corridor.
“No way! Nobody’s breaking up with anybody tonight!”
He had continued to sit at the table in front of their own but no longer sent him any enticing smile.
“Potter, you’re going to be late for your diversion to Weasel if you don’t hurry” he replied with his dragging voice, shifting his attention to the reading of his book.
“And you, stop wasting time and come fuck me!”
Harry was walking on an alley of the campus without really knowing where to go.
Rating : E
“I don’t know, but do it, okay?”
“Don’t fuck with me, Ron is in the same class as you and he doesn’t seem so distant with Hermione! What the fuck is the problem? Is that me?” Ginny shouted.
Harry was still trying to understand the sad fate of this fatality when a small voice forced him to open his eyes and raise his head.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
The lights around them again flickered, triggering a slight sneer from Nott, who seemed to enjoy the show.
“Why? Are you going to hit me?” Harry asked, stretching a sarcastic smile.
It was like taking a cold shower, like waking up in the middle of the night after a bad dream. All the sensations of pleasure burst away and left nothing but cold that surrounded him all.
"Hmh ..."
They landed in a small alley, sheltered from Muggles passers-by who crossed the nearby streets.
Harry stiffened, opening wide his eyes, stunned.
Blaise, for his part, raised an amused eyebrow before grinned.
«This is how I love them... » Malfoy whispered for himself, before going through the door of his building.
He had been staying late several times to dodge his questions that he did not have any answers. She had already sent him several owls to ask him to choose between purple or blueberry red and he had not yet decided.
Harry sneered at Malfoy’s thoughtful look, which seemed to relive the moment with difficulty.
Intentionally.
Malfoy moved his eyes to his body, lingering on his crotch, which he felt hardened again in spite of himself. He then lifted his grey eyes up to his face and planted them in his own before stretching a grin.
“Just because you told me the truth. I never thought you’d be able to, but you were right about seventh year, the Astronomy Tower and-” he interrupted, obviously unable to continue.
"I'm not sure you approve if you want to know everything" Potter hissed, removing one hand from his pocket to play with the ornaments of the tablecloth from the table beside them.
Harry giggled in his scarf thinking of their complicity, which had never been so beautiful. He was almost jealous to see them so close while he and Ginny gradually moved away. He slowly lost his smile when he thought of the young woman whom he was abandoning more and more for the benefit of Malfoy.
Harry slowly got closer the support, stunned to find such a magical object here.
“Holidays are way too short...” Ron blew, collapsing on the table of the diner hall of the campus, his head in his arms.
Harry ends up closing his eyes to Malfoy’s touch and the smell of his perfume. He caught himself snorting it with envy...
Dumbledore caught his wand carelessly placed on his desk and directed it to a locked cabinet with a bronze padlock. He made a wrist movement and the cabinet opened in a small “click” before spreading one of the doors. A small pack came out, flying through the room to finally land in front of them.
He made the choice not to tell them anything. Because he didn’t know what the consequences would be. Because he didn’t want to talk about the hypothetical life he’d seen unfold, which he probably would have appreciated if it wasn’t about Malfoy…
Harry gave Malfoy time to catch his breath before positioning himself more forward between his legs. He passed a hand on his own sex, going back and forth to spread the pre-seminal liquid in order to lubricate himself.
“Sure, why wouldn’t I be?”
“You’re acting weird when he’s around, I didn’t realize it right away, but the more we run into him the more I think there’s something there.” Ron continued, obviously not willing to let go.
Everything happened very quickly, Harry made a quick move but Draco had seen it coming. His impulsivity is no longer a secret to him, after so many years spent around him.
Yes, there was no doubt that Harry was probably disgusted to have any contact with him.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, his impassive mask firmly in place on his pale face with fine features, emerging all the more under the frozen air from outside.
Harry felt his conscience give up, his body sink under the weight of realities, the weight of the fucking truth.
Harry blinked several times while the information reached his brain, still too obsessed with his recent troubles. He finally made the connection and turned his eyes to Ron before lowering them again on his food.
“Fuck, no! I just told you that I thought
“What did you mean earlier? Talking about the torpor?” he wondered, remembering his first remark.
Malfoy stood still, in the centre of the room, looking at him as if he were meeting him for the first time.
He glanced at Malfoy one last time, before taking a deep breath, which he blocked at the base of his lungs, and suddenly turning his heels to his original place. Harry stepped forward to the table he shared with Ron, Ginny, and Hermione and grabbed his bag from one of the chairs he hung on his right shoulder.
“Stop calling me by my name, fuck! For the last time where are we? ” Harry shouted.
Draco had a slight intonation before he came to his senses.
A picture of him appeared in the container, sitting on a bench, a thick forest on the horizon.
Draco then opened his briefcase, pulled out a document of several pages and handed it to Potter.
“Our little interview is coming to an end, you are free to go” he said, calmly.
Draco swallowed hardly, panting in spite of him to the memory of Harry’s mouth moving on his cock begging him to continue.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment and then wrinkled his grey eyes.
"Well, Potter, you can’t even drink properly." Zabini spoke in a condescending tone, an evil grin adorning his lips.
"For fuck’s sake, Malfoy, shut up! For once, shut the fucking up!" Harry thundered, who felt his patience crumbling in contact with Malfoy.
He glanced at Harry for the last time and began to walk through the door.
Harry stared at the place where Malfoy was standing for a few seconds before leaving him behind and headed toward one of the fireplaces with a nervous limp.
Malfoy had a move of retreat, raising his eyebrows of surprise.
“How did he die?”
Harry struggled to stay calm, but his nerves seemed to be dropping at all times.
Harry, still standing, his mind definitively refocused, was about to cross the door again to escape this place. Furious at having waited in vain, finding bitterly that he had probably forgotten him.
Draco had looked at him without blinking, the muscles of his jaw contracting painfully.
Draco closed his eyes, feeling his impassive mask break.
Harry listened with only one ear, with his elbow on the table, his head resting lazily in the palm of his hand as he grinded the food into his plate without consuming it.
And it was even more painful than his fucking leg.
“There’s no way you’re getting out of here on your own” Malfoy said, looking down on him.
"No fucking matter if you repented or not, you were a fucking bloody Death Eater, Malfoy!" Harry shouted, out of his mind.
Once in the bathroom, he took off his pants and took off his still sticky boxers from his flings with Malfoy.
Ginny stared at him, his eyebrows raised, visibly waiting for something from him without him being able to put his finger on it.
Harry rolled his eyes and sighed.
- and remembered the smell it smelled for him. Hermione talked about how it was different for everyone.
“Don’t be silly, it’s-”
Harry frowned, raising his eyes to Malfoy’s, without understanding. This one then passed a hand behind his neck, pressing it to bring him closer and crushed his lips on his.
So, why did Malfoy think he had won too?
How could he have done this to her... How could he have let Malfoy touch him when he felt nothing for him?
Once the healer left, he remained for a few moments to watch her return to her office before turning to Draco.
Draco nodded silently, then rose from all his height, pointing his wand at the body at his feet and after a brief moment freed him.
Paring : HPDM
He had not been an exemplary boyfriend for the past few weeks, but Harry was determined to fix it, now that everything was back to normal on his side.
No, it couldn’t go on anymore, he really had to smooth things over, at least to calm the burning desire to hold him again against him. He needed to regain that complicity which he had seen the day before and which had made him shamefully hope.
“Let Ron take care of it, he and the Aurors will take care of capturing this asshole and bringing back your memories” he said.
Draco stood up for a moment and looked at his watch: 12h45 am.
He looked at the beginning of his note and frowned at the ridiculous situation. He was about to respond with a letter rather than travelling in person when only 7 floors separated him.
Savior! You show up whenever you want and the rest of the time I don’t exist. I’m not a
“What… What do you mean by “real”?”
Harry kept his eyes on him, savoring every moment, every movement. He wanted to engrave this vision of Malfoy who let himself go. He, always impeccably straight and his look so cold. There, Malfoy was hot on Harry, his whole being, burned Harry's skin, he was incandescent.
He was still sitting on the floor, his knees bent over himself, supporting his head with his hands when the elementary magic teacher arrived to open his class.
“Aren’t you working today?” Harry asked, raising eyebrows, realizing only now that he was still there.
Once he had received the rag, he wiped his hand before vaguely wiping out the small drops that sprinkled the coffee table. But fate was against him and he stumbled on the bottle of whiskey that staggered dangerously before falling completely. The liquid escaped in great waves and rolled to the carpet under the coffee table.
“Let’s say the timing is rather bad, yeah… Some complications about Harry”, he suddenly became tense, “Potter! I mean about
“Malfoy,” Harry replied, nodded in turn.
“Well, then I’m leaving, Malfoy, since obviously the mere fact that I don’t spread my thighs, bothers you so much.” Harry spit out, buttoning his pants with rage and putting on his coat to face the cold.
Harry quickly turned his gaze away, feeling a spike of pain through his stomach. His jaw contracted, preventing him from swallowing his saliva properly, his hands forming fists as he moved forward in with Ron.
It was imperative that he calm down to avoid losing his cool. It was a game, he knew it. Malfoy had always had the gift of sticking where it hurt to get him to react and it took Harry some time to understand that it was in his way of speaking. They were adults now, and if at the time Malfoy was using them as a defence mechanism, there was no longer that animosity they once had. It was just a kind of teasing that seemed to have made their home.
"What did I do? What the fuck did I do?" Harry blew in an endless complaint.
"Potter, you ask me if I used you, the answer is yes, because the opportunity presented itself..." he explained, walking up to the middle of the room, overtaking him before turning to face him again.
"You’re completely out of your mind, Malfoy" Harry replied, with his throat dry as he stared at the wall to his right, “I’ve never done anything like this”.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Draco then stopped the fire under the cauldron and grabbed an empty vial and a ladle to fill it with the potion he had just finished. He carefully closed the bottle, taking care to mark, with his most beautiful calligraphy, the name “
He felt Malfoy all over him, he saw him all around him...
“Uh… I have to finish writing my case report before I go home” he explained, as he walked to the sink to put down his cup, which was instantly cleaned before getting into one of the cupboards in the room.
Exactly! And then with Malfoy you never know which foot to dance on, that fucking ferret must have found another way to get noticed,” Ron replied, pointing his fork at Harry.
He was terribly aware of his feelings now that he had managed to put words on it. He had tried to put them out of his mind and shut them, but it was like covering the truth with a veil, knowing full well that it remained exposed.
“It’s nothing, my hand just slipped” he said, without looking at him.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
“It’s true, that now that you say it, they regularly sit at this table” Ginny noticed, glaring them.
to hit him in turn for daring to do it a few seconds earlier.
On one of them, he was right beside him, Harry saw himself glancing at him and making a little grin while Malfoy looked at the lens, raising an arrogant eyebrow.
Harry stood watching them, his wand slightly pointed at Malfoy, always suspicious.
“So what?” suddenly added Ron. “You’re finally going to tell me what’s wrong?”
“Well, you’ll be happy to hear that I’m perfectly fine.” Harry smiled, changing the layout of a puzzle piece.
Malfoy looked so serious and dull that Harry almost felt responsible.
After the war, Draco had put an end to all the beliefs that his ancestors and parents had instilled to him, conditioning his spirit and his desires for his “well-being” and that of his family.
He was about to Side-Along when Harry suddenly stepped forward to interrupt him.
“Do you have any more questions or are we finally going to start what you’re here for?” Nott asked, crossing his fingers on his desk.
“Oh you two are pissing me off, I’d rather go study my next class than hear you get mad at them again” Hermione sighed, grabbing his tray and rising to head for the exit.
Harry had tried to resist, to the end, he had tried to swallow his impulses for Malfoy, but his desire for him was far too deep...
Even worse, he wanted to do it too. He had wanted to take off his past self so that he could participate in the kiss he had given Malfoy, to know his taste and to learn it more deeply with his tongue.
“Yeah, gladly!” Harry nodded.
Ron nodded and walked past Malfoy with his eyes wrinkled before continuing his path.
Malfoy’s hips rose up against him, exerting a pronounced upward and downward movement against his buttocks. Harry could feel his dick pulsating over his pants, showing all of Malfoy’s cravings for him right now.
“Who is his shrink? I think he has one since his neurons are gone to take the air” he asked, turning at Draco.
Yes, Harry was definitely physically attracted to Malfoy. More than that, he kept wanting him. It was as if his body claimed some as soon as he left him. Like a lack never satisfied, a desire never satisfied.
Harry nodded his head. His eyes had never left Malfoy, who ended up feeling observed because he raised his head and turned his eyes in his direction, in a look that was both piercing and then burning with desire. Harry swallowed, feeling his sex harden in his pants, before clearing his throat and looking down on his work too, trying to calm his nascent erection while Ron was by his side.
Harry again turned his eyes to his best friend, his suddenly erratic breathing.
“Are you here to help?” Harry asked.
“Fuck you, Malfoy! Give me back my wand!” Harry shouted, his anger sizzling the lights in the hallway.
Malfoy’s laughter calmed down a bit and Harry realized that he had stopped smiling and that his breath had stuck in his lungs. He took a deep breath and exhaled heavily when he felt the rising fear in his bowels to experience such emotions.
Yet, it was stronger than him, to look at his former enemy had become a habit. It was already like that in the days of Hogwarts, and if it didn’t seem suspicious before, it was clearly because only hatred came out. Now, there was a very different glow in their eyes and he was convinced that Ron had seen it.
Malfoy got a little closer, stooping slightly to his height.
“Cheers!”
“Obviously not tonight” Harry jeered, grabbing Malfoy’s cock full-handed and starting slow back and forth.
“Who told you we were done?” Malfoy added.
“Definitely, Voldemort must turn in his grave today and I am also taking my rank…” he scoffed bitterly. “And it’s completely deserved.” he hurried to add when he saw Ron wrinkling his eyes dangerously.
Malfoy let out a sharp groan and grabbed the man’s mouth bent over him to kiss him with passion.
Already in his sixth year, hatred had been constantly present and had even increased in intensity as he struggled to understand what the ex-Slytherin was up to.
He looked up at the wizard network that was running commercials on the last of the most commercially available brooms. A Quidditch player from the Chudley Cannons team roamed the sky at high speed on a 3.0 Firebolt, streaking the clouds separating under the power of thrust. The following image revealed the prices of the real estate and the most quoted houses currently on sale.
Kingsley was in the midst of demonstrating the new construction that the Ministry was going to fund to make a better future for wizard children and he was constantly debating with the members of the Wizengamot about the next activities that would be organized for them in the school setting.
“It only took you several months to realize it, it’s impressive! I could have bet you’d be at the same point at the end of the year” he replied, looking down on his book again.
Harry frowned his own with incomprehension.
“It’s all right, go ahead, I’ll go home anyway, I don’t want to go dancing,” Harry said, smiling.
,” he smiled, ironically.
“No it’s okay, I’m just tired” he sighed, putting one hand on his face.
He blinked and opened them abruptly when he fell on a silhouette lying beside him. The young man had the face of Malfoy, his soft and fine features, as well as the smell of his perfume.
“Harry, Draco, this is a really bad time to argue. I know this is complicated for you, Harry, but you can trust Draco, and either way, you don’t have the choice until we know more about the identity of the man who hex you. Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll take care of finishing packing up the wedding decorations” she ended up.
He stopped on one of them, indicating «Draco Malfoy», «Theodore Nott» and his breath got stuck in his chest.
"Seriously?" Malfoy asked, "You
“Potter?” Malfoy grinned, raising an innocent eyebrow.
“All right, in that case, I’m not sure we’ll see each other again,” Noah replied.
Several times, Hermione had remarked to him about the incredible shit he was working in when she came to see him and Ron for lunch or at the end of the day. Harry had always nodded without putting away a single piece of paper.
Harry turned to the left and went in front of the list of students hanging on the front door of the building. This time, Malfoy’s name was on it. He then entered the hall, went up the stairs to the indicated floor and arrived at the landing where Malfoy was staying.
"Undoubtedly," said Malfoy, with his dragging voice.
“I didn’t know it was going to damage my brain” he blew, confused.
Harry opened his eyes, breath short and frowned when he saw Malfoy irritated in front of him, an eyebrow raised, arms crossed on his bust.
Harry skillfully avoided him and ran to the front door.
Harry has redoubled his run at this thought. He had to see him, he had to talk to him.
Potter's got a new grin.
were badly mistaken. Because he sometimes had dark thoughts, and if he repressed them, it didn’t stop him from thinking about them for a long time.
Blaise’s smile grew while his eyes sparkled with malice.
“I may be more inclined to do so, yes…”
OoOoOoO
“But what was the purpose?” Harry asked, puzzled, noticing that Dumbledore's damaged hand had not moved from where it was since they were talking.
, but now that you have confirmed it, I am amply reassured.”
Harry, who drinking his ButterBeer, almost choked on it. He coughed before taking a deep breath.
He fell face to face with an immaculate white torso, almost unreal pale. If he hadn’t seen it the day before, he might have convinced himself that he imagined it.
"Your arm" he blew.
He extinguished his bedside lamp, immediately turning his back to his friend, wrapping his sheets around him.
Draco bit his lower lip to prevent the tears that he felt rising from his throat to his eyes, where already the moisture was shamefully wetting his lashes. He took a deep breath and turned completely to clasp his back against the door and let himself slide until he met the ground.
She had decided not to do her 7th year at Hogwarts and to join the Quidditch section directly at the Witch Academy.
Of course, Ginny, too tired, had not followed and apologized all day by kissing him and taking him in her arms not to go dancing. Finally, like last time, he found himself with Ron and Hermione who had dropped him again to go and shake on the dance floor. So, he had gone to the furthest room to be alone to ponder.
Harry opened his eyes again when he heard him sneer, his gaze, this time amused, always resting on him.
Sitting crossed-legged beside him, her nose was plunged into a book three times bigger than his. He looked at her sideways and could see that she was absorbed by her reading, the small crease between her eyebrows regularly wrinkling as she read the different lines of the grimoire.
Harry woke up in the morning, in the room he was supposed to share with Malfoy, who had left him, settling for his part in the sofa in the living room. He had been so disappointed to find this unknown bed, around everything he didn’t remember.
!” he immediately added, glaring anxiously at Harry, who, fortunately for him, was far too busy staring at Blaise to feel troubled.
His eyes sparkled when the whistle sounded, prompting the teams to begin.
And that, too, he was proud of. Making Potter lose his head as he had passionately stolen his heart.
"It doesn't prove anything, it's probably one of your ways to play me! But it doesn't work, I'm not stupid enough to believe in such a ridiculous thing! How could you, Saint Potter, have this kind of incongruous feelings for…Me?! Admit that it is totally laughable!"
“No, I said, do it
“That also sounds vaguely familiar…” Malfoy taunted, a malicious glow shining in the background of his grey eyes.
“Malfoy… Are you in love with me?”
“I’m really sorry, but I’m not going to tell you anything more. It’s too much…traumatic” he replied, in a calm voice.
“I don’t see the connection.”
The anger he felt was so strong that he could cry, but there’s no point in letting go.
Harry stared at him for a few more seconds before nodding and backing back enough to leave a suitable gap between them.
“To compete with the
Harry stuck his fist in his face before he could even hold it. He was so overwhelmed with the hatred that had been eating him since this morning that the slightest inappropriate, though deserved, remark made him lose control over his emotions.
Great sense of guilt fell on his shoulders as he reflected on how he had behaved toward Ron, Hermione, and especially Ginny, that very morning. He had been a fucking asshole and now that he was stepping back enough to look at the situation, he was bitterly regretting his actions.
Harry nodded silently.
In one last effort, he drew the last remnants of magic that he had in him and directed it to the object. The last inches, still intact, were covered with light ice and the light went out.
Christmas holidays were over and the classes had resumed nicely, for the greatest pain of Harry who had to bear again the presence of Malfoy in front of him.
He frowned, noticing that they seemed different from the Ron and Hermione with whom he had exchanged in recent days. Younger, undoubtedly wearing their Gryffindor’s-coloured dress with the prefect badge pinned on it.
“Oh, good news, then!” Ginny said, stretching her lips a little more until she discovered her teeth.
to remind you next time” he said, with his dragging voice.
Yes, Harry didn’t know exactly why Malfoy had allied himself with Voldemort’s cause, but it didn’t matter to him at the time, the damage was done, he had chosen his clan and it wasn’t his.
It was only the second session and Harry was already looking forward to the end of this whole improvised course thing.
Blinking, he felt blushed by his similar behavior of the day before, when he had already felt attracted by the sight of Malfoy’s body.
Ron stretched a bitter grin looking up and down at Harry, a deep contempt in his blue eyes.
But the years had passed and the beautiful face with fine lines and grey eyes had become more blurred as his life progressed. He pinched his nose and closed his eyes with a sigh.
to me!”
Ron pinched the lips before biting the one on the bottom.
A powerful tremor then moved the elevator and Harry was so confused that he did not immediately notice that he had loosened his grip from the railing. There was a second tremor, stronger this one and he stumbled, letting go completely the metal bar.
Draco shook his head negatively.
“Are you fucking kidding me?! I was very clear earlier, I asked you to
Harry blinked before shrugging his shoulders in spite.
“All right!” sneered Malfoy, raising his hands to calm him down.
Who would want him so far out? And from what?
He had to keep in mind that the one who shared his life would come back to him, even if he had to wait a long time. He would wait.
Harry moved slightly to the side with his hands, before groaning when he pressed his wound, bringing it back before his eyes.
“I don’t believe it, it’s probably hiding something,” Ron replied, engulfing a potato.
“I thought I told you not to call me like that anymore,
“We were never going to say anything. This is the fair return of things, Malfoy, I have done to you what you wanted, in my turn to enjoy it” he replied, sitting on Malfoy’s bed.
Malfoy, prisoner of his closeness, wrinkled his eyes.
“My wand?” He asked calmly, putting his head on the pillow.
Harry kept well, however, to remind him of this memory, although he has the impression that this Nott is already aware of a lot of things concerning him.
“See you later, Harry, I hope you’ll be well enough to get back into practice.” she added, in a final wink.
“Do you remember that time when you tried to scare me in that horrible Dementor costume?” Harry asked, who had already started his fifth drink.
“Of course you don’t have to go back to the chair anymore, Potter. I will gladly leave it to you to choose the sofa, which is, for its part, not bewitched” he claimed, turning his eyes to the furniture.
Because it was stronger than him, he absolutely
Harry turned his face to Malfoy, who raised his own pint to toast with his friends before lifting it to his lips. He stared at him for a moment, staring at his Adam’s apple going up and down as he drank his drink and then turned his eyes to his drink.
The Gryffindor raised his eyebrows.
“I know something’s up and you’re not telling me everything”
“Absolutely sure.”
Draco, swallowing with difficulty, always leaning against the wall, staring at him.
Then it came time to leave the table, Potter devoted himself to clearing out while Draco took advantage of it to go and freshen up in the bathroom. He opened the sink’s cold water tap, bending his hands underneath to collect enough before plunging his face into his palms to enjoy the freshness.
And Malfoy’s hand was coming down, pulling out small noises from Harry's mouth, he was panting as he saw this hand moving towards its destination. She lands on her hip which she tightened and then suddenly, she tackled
Draco had winced when he had passed the threshold of the door, standing in front, without daring to come any closer. Harry had to pull him by the arm to force him back in.
There, he laid the whole thing, opened the bottle with his wand and enchanted the wine so that it poured itself into the two glasses.
Harry slammed his tongue on his puck, wincing.
Harry couldn’t stop a grin on his lips and drank a sip of his drink.
Harry nodded silently, keeping his eyes on Malfoy.
Was Malfoy there? Was he alone?
Ron stood in the midst of the green flames, with a radiant smile illuminating his features.
Harry winked, stunned by what he had just heard. He was not entirely sure if he understood, but nevertheless risked answering him.
?" Malfoy hissed insisting on the last word.
Yet, the last one Harry touched was totally different from Ginny. Because it was that of a man, who therefore didn’t have the same forms, nor the same peculiarities and also because it was
“None of the people we interviewed were good enough, so I had to trade my place as a chaser to replace you.”
“I have no choice, Potter, our two families have already worked to link our assets and are already planning to make joint investments.”
“Hi Draco” he said, with his manipulative look, before turning his head to Harry, “Potter” he added, nodding.
Harry wicked at him and turned to the bar to order his drink. Malfoy followed him and settled by his side; his mocking smile still stuck to his bloody lips.
His stomach contracted painfully at this terrible finding. He swallows hard before surreptitiously closing his eyes and taking a deep breath, his hand picking up his wand from the pocket of his pants.
Malfoy instantly tensed up and stepped back, raising an arm and reaching forward.
He had difficulty concentrating during the practice of the new defense spells he was taught that day. But he quickly recovered when he almost touched the teacher with one of them. The rest of the day was as difficult as the morning. Harry had hardly eaten anything during lunch, too disturbed to swallow his entire meal.
“Well, you should! Just because you’re sharing my life now doesn’t mean I can’t face you!” Draco threatened.
Harry frowned as he removed his hands to stare at him.
Ron’s face closed as he turned his eyes toward Malfoy, with a serious glance.
He remained still for a moment, frowning while the flames of Malfoy’s fireplace regained their original appearance and danced joyfully.
Harry shrugged his shoulders and planted his eyes in his.
And they Disapparated.
“First of all, because you’re not an Auror, Harry, so you don’t have to get involved in investigations and you’re the one who was attacked, so there’s no way you’re going head down until we know more” Ron said, calmly.
“Theodore Nott” Draco replied.
Draco hung his hands on Harry’s hips, losing himself to his soft lips that he didn’t think he could taste for a long time.
Harry moved there, because he was indeed exhausted from his exchange with Malfoy and had not yet finished recovering.
“Harry? Hey, man, are you all right?” Ron asked, shaking his shoulder.
Seeing that it would not leave, he sighed and imbued himself with his feeling, his heart beating louder in his chest and cast the spell again, opening his eyes.
Harry raised his eyebrows. He was clearly not fooled and intended to make him spit out what he absolutely wanted to hear.
The one where he lost Hedwig, the one where a memory of Sirius was taken from him…
“I… I don’t usually leave my guests in the lurch, no.”
It was the sound of the explosion that brought him back into the crowd, blinking before posing them on his friends who looked at him completely shocked.
"Andrea will see you, we’ll wait for her wisely here," Malfoy said to him, with his dragging voice before showing two chairs on the side and settling in.
here,” Draco said, trying to contain his exasperation.
Harry shuddered at this touch, in a pronounced disgust even if the gesture remained pleasant. Coming from Malfoy it was not bearable. He tried to get away, but the Slytherin held him firmly.
This had made him upset and he ran until he lost his breath towards Malfoy’s dormitory, without really knowing what he was doing or why he was going there.
A small smile, so peculiar, adorned his lips, which Harry couldn’t remember ever seeing at Malfoy’s.
“In a minute, if you don’t mind, I’m going to be a little bit busy, right now.” Malfoy explained, whose voice suddenly became lower.
“Fine. Then good luck” Malfoy replied with his dragging voice. “For that and… for the rest of the wedding organization.” he then added, stretching a thin smile.
with Malfoy…
"Perfect, thank you," Malfoy’s voice said behind him.
He remembered perfectly the last time he left Malfoy, especially
"Seriously, Potter? Usually that’s your specialty" Malfoy pointed out, raising a sarcastic eyebrow.
A few seconds passed before Pomfrey appeared in his field of vision. In two quick steps, she was already next to him performing diagnostic spells while frowning on concentration eyebrows.
The truth is, he never even thought of a boy... let alone the ex-Slytherin!
Harry seemed to remember what he was looking at before being interrupted by his best friend and turned head down sharply.
His own breath became difficult to control when the information traced back to his brain, which ran out of oxygen at the sight of his ex-enemy taking his foot with a man. He always thought he was dating Pansy Parkinson. Harry had always believed that, being of his branch, the pureblood could only go out with girls.
“That’s the truth, Potter.” He groaned, backing a little further.
’re holding me, aren’t you?" Malfoy replied in grin.
Blaise raised his eyebrows very high before bending over to take his glass in hand.
The goblet was completely crystallized, shining from a thousand fires to the light of the room.
“Yeah, well, that’s not really how it felt” Harry blew, shaking his head.
As soon as he laid eyes on it, when his reason settled enough withered away to his own bullshit, he lifted it up to see if it did not start to change. Like he’s hoping it’s not really there.
“Malfoy…” he blew, couldn’t do more.
Ron blinked several times before turning slowly without leaving Harry’s eyes.
"Sorry, I didn’t really think about the exact spot where I would wank you, on the way here" Harry added, ironically.
The practice classes were becoming more and more complicated, their magic was being put to the test and they were completely exhausted coming out of class. After each elementary magic class, he and Ron threw themselves at the food, seeking to fill the abyss that was taking hold of them.
Harry blinked and turned them to the massive black wood library, filled with various voluminous books of rather ancient appearance. He then looked at the large, bottle-green window framing the entire length of the desk.
“Why did you do exactly what I asked you to do?” Harry said, turning his head to glance him.
Harry opted for a dark wooden box that had crossed his mind in seconds. He remembered seeing her hanging around somewhere and finding her pretty but unable to determine where she came from.
Draco stared at him for a moment, detailing his tired features and the totally distraught look that shone in his emerald eyes as he kept staring at his lips, which seemed to trouble him.
Because that’s what he did. Just before he holed up here with his drink and his loneliness for company.
Harry couldn’t help laughing at the bickering of his best friends, who usually annoyed him but who finally missed him in a few days. They were finally behaving in a way that seemed familiar to him and he felt much more serene to see them like that.
Malfoy snorted before drinking a sip of tea, obviously uncomfortable.
’s body.
A little tinkling on the window pane brought him to his senses, and he rushed to open the little owl which rushed into the room. It had a simple letter with the words “
He felt that he had withdrawn into his bubble, ignoring his friends and the world around him. Nothing seemed captivating enough for him to deign to be interested enough. It was like drowning in deep melancholy without really caring what others thought.
He observed the place where Malfoy was staying and was surprised to find that he was particularly sober.
Harry and Ron were therefore in front of the shop when George opened the doors of his small personal palace.
A sadness’s wave invaded him. He really hoped to be mistaken, but in the picture that Malfoy sent him back he could not help believing it.
“You’ll find something to wear in these drawers, these are mine” he said, with a nod of the head before heading back to the living room.
Hermione nodded silently and turned to him.
He would have wanted to be able to yell at him that he had enough strength to hear what he had to say, that he didn’t give a shit about tiredness and that only the answers to his fucking questions mattered at that moment.
He went around the hall, recognizing a few people, including Hermione, a quill in his hand that seemed to transcribe the whole of what was going on. Harry looked at the row of chairs closest to the stage and his heart missed a beat when his eyes landed on a blonde head recognizable among all.
For this reason, he could not suppress a slight smile, detailing his reflection, having never seen himself elegantly dressed.
He was dressed in a heavy plum robe that brought out his light grey eyes and almost white hair. He looked even bleaker with that hue, but it looked strangely good on him.
Once far enough from the hearth, there was a detonation and the greenish faces left the flames to give way to his two best friends in the flesh and bone in front of him.
As if his subconscious had needed his blessing, the colour scheme that surrounded him slowly faded away to make room only for the dark, like a night without stars where he felt suffocated.
Harry only had time to see a dark-coloured figure closing the door and a few strands of light hair flying when the door closed.
He had a thought for Lockhart, and Neville’s unfortunate parents, while Malfoy was talking with the hostess, before turning to point him.
Just once…
He began to read the report Malfoy had just given him, a few moments before he left in haste. Harry knew the reunion was going to be tense.
His blood bubbled in his veins as Malfoy seemed closer than ever to a young man sitting beside him. Young man whom he identified as Noah the other night, his hand casually resting on Malfoy’s thigh which seemed to listen to him without much interest.
Yes. Lying was his only way out if he wanted to make sure she didn’t look any further until she found out the truth. The terrible truth he’s been hiding for months now.
Harry wasn’t following the game at all. He could no longer hear the students shouting in the stands around them. A hand on his shoulder brought him to his senses, making him look away and lay his eyes on Ron, who was smiling to his teeth.
He was so absorbed in his reflections, unable to fix any other direction than that which his heart submitted to him, that he did not even pay attention when his glass fell over, spreading all the liquid that dripped around his hand, splashing his food, then slid to the edge of the table to end up in a fine line on the ground.
These are things that happen naturally, he was Harry Potter, the most famous wizard after Dumbledore and Voldemort. And after the last two died, he was at the top of the list.
“For what it’s worth, if you need to talk or just drown your grief in a good, pure fire whiskey, you know where to find me” he said, anchoring his black eyes in his owns
“I get the distinct impression that our evenings are quite similar. I would bet the most expensive cauldron that Astoria is handling the table allocation right now.” he grinned, rolling his eyes slightly but enough for Harry to notice.
Neville nodded and joined him.
The Gryffindor sneered before speaking again.
Draco wanted to prevent him from escaping but Blaise had not left him time. He cursed before turning to Scarhead which made him a little awkward smile.
He crossed the hall, came to the atrium and carefully avoided the pressing glances of the visitors who stared at him without restraint.
"Uh, are we... are we... okay? »
"Hermione! Can you
Draco took a few seconds to think.
“Never. Not when it’s your first time!”
“What? What will you do?” Harry retorted, as he moved forward.
With his hand on the handle, he opened the door in a flash and froze before he had time to go in.
Harry watched him bend the cup slightly to his lips to swallow a sip and slowly rest it on the table while contemplating the bottom.
“Okay, that’s enough. Get out of my room!”
"Yeah, yeah, I’m okay, I’m just a little tired," Harry replied, trying to smile.
Harry, of course, never intended to repeat what he had done with Malfoy. They had parted in the middle of one of their many -
want,” Harry concluded.
After all, he also wanted to, but he had to comfort her.
Once again, he wanted to stop him but Malfoy had already caught his sex and brought up his tongue all along, snatching a groan from Harry. Malfoy licked the head of his cock, licking the few drops that beaded there and Harry moaned louder, his head tipping back, his back bowing under pleasure.
“Is everything all right?” he asked, to be sure.
“If you want to know that much, I want to be a Healer”
All the more so since all this was true, it was now ten years since he had not met this individual and that he remembers him as well as Harry had only a vague memory of him was particularly revealing.
"Blaise… If you don't tell me right away what you mean by that, I will…" He began with his dragging voice, before being cut off by the young man.
Harry passed the stadium, arriving on the alleys of the campus, immediately taking the road to Malfoy’s dormitory, as if on autopilot.
Looking up at the clock hanging on the wall, he agreed to get up and get dressed.
He raised his head when he heard the door clicking, his heart pounding with apprehension that Malfoy was passing it. It was stupid, but he still had trouble thinking he was
Inside, the pub was still dark. The many wizards sitting in front of their drinks, where sitting directly at the bar were thrown into great discussions. Some threw interested eyes at them, others pointed fingers at their neighbours as they headed to the back of the building to the famous brick wall.
Never mind the delay he would take in making his last potions, he would send an owl to warn his superiors that he would not come back this afternoon.
He contemplated the letters "P. S", which had become almost unreadable, for a few seconds and then placed the note on his side.
? ” Harry hissed, turning his head sharply in his direction.
“Strangely, he’s no longer as exasperating as he was in Hogwarts, but he’s still very odd, even... quite uninhibited, right Harry?” Ron explained, turning his eyes to him.
“Stop that”, Harry hissed, jolting.
“So, tell me everything! What complications are we talking about, exactly?” Blaise asked, crossing his legs, one of his feet resting carelessly on one of his knees, while his arm lay on the back of the couch.
He must have known that Malfoy would always be there at the wrong time.
The position was not unpleasant, even though the weight was more present now that he had realized it. This movement disturbed him more than he should have, accentuating the strange complicity that settled between them.
He took the time to find his breathing, which had become erratic as a result of the efforts to devastate the living room before locking himself in the bedroom and resting on the bed.
The room had been well hidden, only he or Harry had access to it, but he never thought he would find it so easily. Potter really had to dig around for the idea of examining the vial.
His features relaxed and he raised a taunting eyebrow before grin. Harry swallowed, turning his eyes to the wall, and putting them back on him. Malfoy always looked at him, but his smile was sweeter. Harry’s heart missed a beat without him really knowing why, and he blinked before shaking his head, shifting his focus to the discussion of his friends.
Harry tightened his teeth, the muscles of his jaw contracting painfully, before nodding dry.
Malfoy accentuated the kiss, embracing his tongue around his own, searching for it more and more, passing it on his teeth, while he moaned in return for having it in his mouth.
No, he was doing a lot more than that. He was going way beyond anything Harry had ever imagined. And he just couldn’t stand it.
Malfoy’s face closed a little while he pinched his lips but nodded and stood by his side.
Fuck, it had to!
Feeling a little better, he got up to go around the room, his wooded friend, always by his side.
“It still happens to me, but don’t worry, they’re not as violent as they used to be,” Harry lies in a little smile.
Looking at his reflection, he wondered if like his physical appearance, his state of mind, had also evolved… About Malfoy, about the people around him, about politics, about sports and everything that made him what he was in his day.
“No, I had the Disarming Charm to review…you know you have to try to cast it in a nonverbal spell…” Harry sighed.
Malfoy looked down on him for a moment, perfectly still, no expression betraying the fine features of his face.
Ginny quickly glanced at his brother before sighing heavily.
It was even harder to ignore, knowing that he was moving away from him, having lost his support for years… He was the one who gave up everything to Harry.
When he entered the room, Ron turned his eyes to him and welcomed him with a broad smile before rising to take him in his arms.
He remembered that Harry had confessed to him that he too had a dark side, that all who thought him a
“Fuck, Malfoy... You’re the one who’s putting me in this state...”
Harry winked at the last sentence before turning them to the clock on the wall. He then lowered his head, rereading it again and put his finger on it. A little ink landed on his thumb, proving that the message had just been written.
"Exactly," Harry claimed.
"Merry Christmas, Malfoy," he smiled, nodding gently before walking away to his friends, who signaled to join them.
Harry looked at him without blinking, nodding imperceptibly, before turning and lying on the bed.
Feeling too much discomfort, Draco backed away, delicately releasing Harry’s shoulder without preventing himself from touching his arm with his fingertips. He rose up completely, thus putting some distance between them, as vital to him as to Harry.
“And one night, you went up to the Astronomy Tower when I was already there. I used to go there to refocus myself, and it’s the first time I’ve seen you there. You didn’t say anything, you just stood there, looking at the landscape, and I enjoyed the silence between us. No sharp remarks, no spells cast by anger, just two confused souls seeking calm” He added, taking the picture in his hand, a slight smile in the corner on his lips. “And then it went on. Another night, this time, you were there before me and you started the conversation”
Too many feelings were intertwined in him and he could not detect his own, of those, so powerful, of his own today.
Harry closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and opened his eyes as he exhaled.
Harry opened the door without knocking and entered the room without being invited.
Harry froze, completely afraid to go further with her when his desire went straight to Malfoy, even when it was Ginny who touched him. He was stunned to realize that he still wanted her but that it was totally increased when he was with Malfoy.
He thoroughly flushed out the hemoglobin that was rapidly escaping from his wound before continuing to wash to erase the last traces of his thoughts.
Harry looked at him until he disappeared behind the door.
“My book?” he asked between two breaths, finally looking at him.
"Harry, are you sure you’re okay?" Hermione asked to his right, sweating from his usual sickly anxiety that he knew so well.
Harry glanced at him slightly before imperceptibly shrugging his shoulders.
“This is where you’re wrong, my dear Potter, getting to know the reactions of my patients is primarily part of why I’m employed, as is assessing how you feel and deal with the issues around you” he argued, moving closer to a shelf on one of the walls to contemplate the various trinkets on display.
That was entirely true, they had courses to study and that was why they had invested part of the refectory to be able to read and eat as they wanted.
wanted to continue, but on my side I was very clear!” Harry retorted, annoyed.
"Then act, instead of going into your speeches of the perfect guy who always tells the truth!" Draco intimated, opening his arms wide.
Back in the living room of their home, he let go of Harry who pushed him vehemently before heading for the fireplace, grabbing a handful of floo powder in the process.
Ron and Hermione had found a lovely little house in the small village of Kent, in the south-east of England where they lived happy days.
Hatred had turned into purely physical and sexual envy that neither Malfoy nor Harry had foreseen in the equation.
"See you soon, yes," he added in his trailing voice before rising without looking at others.
“You have no idea how much this whole thing is
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Draco pressed his hands against his skull, grabbing silky handles of hair in the process.
Harry tried to ignore the beating of his heart which accelerated at the sight of Malfoy, silencing the heat that was spreading in the hollow of his belly.
Ron swallowed. Harry could see the muscles of his jaw contract before finally loosening it to open his mouth.
"Of course, who doesn't know?"
Then after what seemed like an eternity, he sat on the sofa, his elbows on his thighs, his hands rising up along his face. He looked exhausted, overwhelmed by all the information.
“So what do you think, Malfoy? You believe me now?” Harry asked, in a hoarse voice.
“Potter, you’re freezing to death, let me give you something to cover for you” Malfoy protested, severely.
He was still completely obsessed with Malfoy when the anger passed through him at the moment when he uttered a slight laugh to Zabini’s attention who had certainly just told a hilarious event since the others are struggling around them.
Harry seemed impressed, following the kitchen tools in their place, the premises of a smile adorning his lips.
“You look so eager that I can remember” he noticed.
"Merlin, Potter but what are you talking about?" hissed Draco, annoyed.
It was 6:00 p.m. when Harry and Ron finally got out of their last class. Exhausted, but brains well imbued, they spoke with liveliness of their new lessons.
Malfoy’s grip loosened slightly, and Harry took advantage of it to try to free himself.
According to his behavior, Draco’s suspicions about Harry’s desire for him were confirmed, but far from him the idea of using it against his will.
Draco therefore went towards the bedroom, frowning to find it resolutely empty. A few folds on the bed suggested that Harry had, however, had to lie there, but he was apparently nowhere.
He headed towards the exit without much enthusiasm knowing full well that once home, Ginny was going to jump on him to ask him if he had thought between the two exterior decorations, she had shown him the day before.
“What are you going to do?” Harry asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
Harry began to breathe louder as Malfoy began to smile slowly, understanding that he was at his mercy.
“I’ve absolutely no doubt that if I did, there is no reason why you should not succeed!”
is going to marry his ginger in a few months from what the newspapers are saying.” he scoffed, in a smug tone.
“I guess it’s not as virulent as it used to be, but it doesn’t change the fact that you always piss me off!”
“The degree of Master of potions…” he blew for himself, remembering the scroll framed on the wall of the living room.
“See you next, Potter” Malfoy whispered who had not stopped looking at him.
Harry tensed up slightly but caught himself not panicking, as if he suspected that Malfoy meant him no harm. And that was the case, he knew it, he felt it.
"I wouldn't be what?" Potter asked, furrowing his eyebrows.
“You summed up perfectly what I expected of you. Now, are you going to answer my request or are you going to be stuck in your perfect little therapist suit that doesn’t break any rules, not even for those who share the Survivor’s life?” he had dared, although using Potter’s notoriety had never been in his attention.
Draco could feel Potter’s beating heart pounding against his bust while his arms firmly surrounded his back in an almost desperate embrace.
He winced to the taste acre of the alcohol which burned his throat and chest where a sweet heat enveloped him. Draco dug himself into the back of the sofa by placing his glass against his thigh and laid his eyes on the extinguished fireplace that he lit by waving his hand.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
"Then who-"
Harry said he loved them. Comparing them to silver when they reflected light, or to a tumultuous ocean when they darkened with desire. Sometimes, much less now, but the few times that hatred and anger were mixed in, he spoke of a stormy sky with flashes of light like lightning. Draco clearly preferred those of Potter, where the intensity of the emeralds was always as vivid regardless of the emotion that ran through it.
He wanted to leave, even more than he had wanted when he arrived here. To see Malfoy had awakened in him a certain uneasiness. And he was even more surprised to feel a strong desire for him.
And feeling him here, against him, made him realize that it wasn’t temporary...
His head appeared again after a few seconds, intimating him to follow him, which Harry did, not without frowning.
Malfoy blinked his grey eyes, seeming to reflect for a moment.
Harry stared at them once again, letting his gaze through the room, falling on a degree of Master of Potions framed on the wall, dated 2002.
“Of course I see Potter…I feel it too… 'Cause if you don’t remember anything, I do, and I’m going to have to deal with it” he said, hoping the sound of his voice didn’t shake.
“Oh, really? You’re going to make me think you didn’t want to kiss me right now?”
Harry raised eyebrows before blinking, totally dazed.
Harry turned around completely this time, looking him in the eye.
Malfoy’s pupils dilated slightly in the dark and he moved just a little so as to take off from the desk and move slightly closer to him. His breath was now falling on the bottom of Harry’s face, who suppressed a chill by lowering his eyes on his lips.
His heart missed a beat, his breath jammed in his lungs when he fell on Noah, a few inches from Malfoy all the way down.
"Malfoy?" he asked, needlessly.
He still couldn’t get over the twist of his pleasure. What possessed him to drift so far on Malfoy when he had never wanted him or any other person of the same sex!
Malfoy attempted a move in his direction but Harry held out his wand to prevent him from going further.
Harry squinted his eyes at the wince displayed by his best friend who looked down on him as if he were deeply disgusted by what he saw.
He risked a glance at Malfoy who smiled slightly at him.
Harry raised his eyebrows, leaning slightly forward.
Harry was gasping on his shoulder. His chest would hardly rise against his while his warm breath touched his neck and made him shiver. Potter must have misinterpreted his reaction since he froze instantly and raised his arms extended along his flanks to pass them between their pressed bodies against each other.
“Of course, that’s what my ancestors have been doing for generations and being the last of the Malfoys, tradition endures with me.”
Harry held Malfoy firmly against him, devouring his mouth with a bewildering envy. His hand pressed against his neck, pressing his skin softly, his arm in the hollow of his kidneys pressing to bring him even closer if he could.
The point bearing the name of Draco Malfoy moved slowly, stopping from time to time, turning on itself, moving closer to the different walls to move away and continue its way.
Malfoy then raised his eyebrows with an undisguised astonishment over his aristocratic fine features.
Then, what the hell was Malfoy doing in his own?
He figured out why Malfoy looked so confident, having himself been a Slytherin, it was obvious that he was one of his comrades and that he knew him well.
Potter tensed up in the middle of the bed, seeming to want to merge with the mattress. Panic had taken possession of the harmonious features of his face and his breath was becoming more and more irregular.
Harry stay still for a moment, before going to sit mechanically on the bed, Malfoy’s feet grazing his pelvis under the sheets.
Harry breathed the frozen air into his lungs before exhaling an almost opaque white mist in front of him.
Harry focused on Ginny, spinning in the air under the dark late afternoon sky. The days had been terribly shortened in this month of January, revealing the moon before the end of the day.
"You, nothing. You carry on with your life and I find the bastards who want to kill you," Ron replied, with a smirk.
Harry just looked down on him, taken aback by the young man standing in front of him.
He was terrorized by the effect that Malfoy was giving him, as if his hatred towards him escaped and that nothing mattered anymore. He was still fragile from the events of the day before and his desire for Malfoy had still not declined. On the contrary, he had only become stronger since he had wanked himself, thinking about him...
“Stop taking your dreams for realities Malfoy, I don’t give a fuck about you and contrary to what you think, I absolutely didn't like that you... you touch me in this way” he replied, shaking his head, disgusted.
“If you say so, but I’m absolutely not convinced” he sighed.
"Yeah! Since I tell you that they do it to piss us off, I'm convinced!" Ron claimed, with a big gesture of the hand.
He had turned his back several times, repeating that it was decidedly not a good idea, but something in him, forced him to stay.
The sentence was about to come down. Draco was smiling full of teeth, feeling Potter panic to his left, waiting for the cleaver to fall.
He extinguished the fire under the cauldron and then cleaned all the ingredients still present on the work surface. He discarded half of them which were to be used immediately after taking them out of their jars.
He blinked to drop the few drops that had hung from his lashes, revealing his disturbing, almost transparent, grey orbs. Draco had never liked his eyes. Too faded, not enough coloured. As if they had been bleached.
“No, really, let’s see what you’re fucking made of! “Because you and I know very well that it wasn’t your magic skills that defeated Voldemort, right?”
"Yes, here we are, Ron, in the kitchen, I’m coming!" he shouted as he came to his senses.
Malfoy looked away from his book, lowering it slightly to look at him, raising a sarcastic eyebrow.
Draco raised his eyes to Harry and raised his eyebrows when he saw his determined gaze as he squeezed his hand tighter on his wrist.
Malfoy eventually dislodged himself from the wall on which he had leaned and nodded as a greeting before turning to the door.
Since seeing Malfoy regularly and maintaining an exclusively carnal relationship with him, he had never felt so calm and serene. It’s like being around Malfoy makes him better. His abilities were increased tenfold, he had felt it, even his concentration had improved significantly during practice exercises.
She seemed to be thinking for a while. Harry had no trouble imagining the connectors of her brain assembling ideas, scrolling them in front of her, looking for the one that would make the most sense to her. Then saw her go back to reading her book on the table, without any glance for him.
“Where are you two going, dressed like that?” Harry grinned.
“But it’s up to you to do it whenever you want, and I’ll do it whenever
Harry swallowed hard.
It was absolutely out of the question that Harry would stand there patiently waiting for his “lover” to come home from work while the asshole who had taken away his memories wandered quietly into the wild.
Potter in front of him, expanded his eyes before giving off a slight grin and finally burst out of laughter without restraint.
All he knew was that the last person he’d seen before he woke up here was Malfoy and that he’d made his completely lose his mind.
Potter stared at him a moment before the corners of his lips began to tremble dangerously and set out in an uncontrollable madness.
He hadn’t really seen Malfoy since the night they went for a drink at the Three Broomsticks. It had been more of vague greetings at the turn of a departmental corridor or of thin polished smiles the few times they had seen each other in the distance but nothing very conclusive.
Harry saw him swallow before a bitter smile twisted his thin lips.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
“I’ve read something like that before, yes, why?”
Harry sighed shaking his head from left to right, without preventing a thin smile from adorning his lips.
“Thank you, Professor, but it was thanks to you that I got this result.” Harry replied.
“Yeah, it’s definitely better when you shut up!”
Theo had wrinkled his eyes before settling more comfortably in the back of his seat.
Draco swallowed with difficulty, thinking back to the hateful and disgusting glances that Harry had constantly put on him, hurting him a little more every time he met his eyes.
Harry had foolishly thought that stopping everything with Malfoy was going to be beneficial on his side because he could focus on himself and his relationship with Ginny.
But how could he hate Malfoy so much and wanted him at the same time? Two diametrically opposed feelings which, however, were complementary and united to form a too full of emotions that Harry tried to keep to himself.
Harry broke the kiss to taste his neck and smell her flower scent that he loved so much. She groaned panting under his burning kisses and he placed himself between her thighs to make one with her.
Not this Harry…
Harry blinked, stunned by the luxury in which Malfoy seemed to live, even if he expected this kind of abode from an aristocrat of his rank. Everything seemed to have been chosen and tidied up with care, an aspect of Malfoy’s personality without a doubt.
“Allow me to doubt it…” he added, slowly turning a page.
Malfoy moved his head slightly without stopping to write, without even saying a word to him.
Harry grinned.
The beating of his heart redoubled before the intensity of the emotions he felt thinking of all the times when he had wanted Malfoy. The pressing need to find him to make him pay for this obsession, this addiction that slowly breathed into his veins, spreading its venom in his blood to control his desires.
“Malfoy… I really have to go” Harry sighed, fastening his belt with his eyes closed.
His friends glanced at each other before turning their eyes to him.
Banners above each shelf indicated the themes of the products arranged.
He raised his head towards Nott, still shocked by his move.
"For the last fucking time and before you draw even more attention to us, I'm not lying! So let me go back to my friends and let's leave it at that since there's obviously nothing else to add," he hissed, turning around again to leave.
Malfoy frowned slightly, looking down on him for a few moments, seeming to find where the trap was.
“Harry… Draco won’t do anything to you,” she said. “It’s no longer the one you knew in the days of Hogwarts,” she added, seeing Harry open his mouth to retort.
Harry was fast thinking, looking for a plausible way to achieve what Dumbledore was explaining to him.
“You’re sure about that, Potter? I think you wanted me to
“Did you get hurt?” Malfoy asked, leaning his face towards Harry’s hand to see if it was serious.
Harry sat in turn, indisputably hampered by the proximity of Malfoy’s body too closer for his taste.
Imagining that Malfoy had surely turned in his sleep and had, in an uncontrolled reflex, surrounded his waist, greatly disconcerted him.
He was convinced that thanks to him, Harry would manage to relax his mind enough so that he could recover his memories without any problems. Because it was complicated to get everything all at once. Especially when the number of years was so high. And ten years of Potter’s life was way more than anyone else on this bloody planet.
He contemplated them for a few moments, as if hypnotized by their way of moving in the hearth before remembering that he was not alone.
He drank a sip of mead and suddenly felt a warm breath sweeping his neck.
"Well, what? What happened?" replied Harry, looking around him.
“What’s the hell talking about him since I can’t even find him” he sighed.
“So, what’s the plan?” he hissed, squinting his eyes.
“Do not hesitate, if you need anything…” he began, with difficulty. “I know you’d rather rip your arm off than do it, but know that… I’m no longer the same as in your memories of me… So, if you have any problems, wake me” he ended.
“It sounds strangely like what you said at his trial.” George retorted, with a light smile.
And the failure was staggering…
“What is the last thing you remember, exactly?” he asked softly.
Harry stayed in this position for a long time, until he felt too tired to keep his eyes open and ended up closing them.
Harry gauged the pale hand with long thin fingers before advancing his arm in turn and grabbing Malfoy’s wrist further, unwilling to experience sensations that would still make him uncomfortable when he touched his skin against his own.
"Before you think about starting over, I'm going to get away from you and this fucking mistletoe and get me drunk," he said, heading towards the buffet.
And he was going to.
Surprised, Draco blinked before looking for Harry’s gaze. He met his closed eyelids as his fingers squeezed tightly around his waist and pressed his flank a little closer until their bodies touched completely.
Draco then moved Potter’s hand to place it against his own neck. Potter’s fingers clung to him as if he were about to fall, as he slowly opened his eyes veiled by desire to look at him. Harry looked at him for a moment before pressing firmly on his neck to force him to come closer, also moving forward to once again delight his lips with a trembling kiss.
“Where exactly do you think you’re going?” Malfoy asked.
"Me too…" Harry replied, thinking of his Fire Lightning crumbled last year, when he was fleeing the Death Eaters on the night of his birthday...
He sighed while opening the door of the infirmary, trying to silence all the questions that were rushing inside him, knowing that it would lead to nothing to rehash without more information. He was going to see Dumbledore for this very purpose and hoped profoundly to come out of his office with satisfactory answers.
“That’s correct. I’m delighted that you take it as a reference, I myself would not have found a better way to explain how this potion works.”
They trained hard, trying to be faster every time they tried, to improve their accuracy, aiming for where they wanted the opponent’s wand to land.
Draco stared at him for a few seconds before answering him.
Draco followed his look before raising an eyebrow.
“I’m not looking at him, at least not consciously, you’re getting your head up for nothing, because there’s clearly nothing to say about it.”
"Oh yeah? Have you looked at yours lately? You really have nothing to envy on this point if you ask me."
"Yeah, I miss Gryffindor’s common room sometimes," Seamus added, nostalgic.
Hermione gave him a contrite smile before answering him.
It was stronger than him... Harry
He made the mistake of letting go of that primitive feeling for his
, this potion is used to induce the person who ingested it into an awake coma. Everything she experiences and feels is real and the universe she lands in.” he explained.
But Harry was far too aware of what was going on. He was far too present in his exchange with Ginny. Nothing seemed to want to disconnect him until that made him come, to have so much pain it was good, to be afraid of it.
who provided his pleasure.
Potter frowned, opened his mouth to answer and then changed his mind. He finally reopening it.
Malfoy took his cigarette away from his lips before spitting out the smoke by gently blowing, his eyes detailing Harry top-down.
It was also one of the reasons that had given rise in Draco to a deep and acrimonious hatred for his former enemy. Hatred that had faded little by little to eventually turn into an unconditional love for that bloody
Harry also moved in a more vigorous rhythm, his moaning becoming more and more raucous, less and less spaced as his hands grabbed both the skin of his back and his blond hair, which he pulled between his fingers.
He quickly slipped under his cover and closed his eyes. He opened them immediately when Malfoy’s smile passed under his closed eyelids and he turned over on his back, sighing.
Harry turned his head to Malfoy, who seemed to have not stopped staring at him and passed a hand through his dark hair feeling blush.
Harry opened wide his eyes, realizing that he had not moved since he faced Malfoy.
Harry passed his hand under his glasses to press the awn of his nose and closing his eyes. He remained in this position for a few seconds while inhaling deeply before blinking and raising his head. He went through the whole room where his colleagues seemed to drink the words of the politician, some of them even nodded their heads at every sentence he uttered.
“Let’s say he’s not bad at logistics and his ideas are good to take,” George added in a small laugh.
Harry prepared to receive the same sentence and began to sheath all his muscles to protect himself when a blue bolt shook between them and hit Ron.
Harry took a deep breath before slowly detaching himself from him.
“They are no longer in England,” he said in a lower tone.
Then without waiting for Malfoy’s reply, turned his heels and went in the opposite direction.
in this photo? What does it mean, what does it
“I will not tolerate you insulting me in my office, Potter. I’m here to help you remember, not to pick on me because my family has made choices you don’t like.” Nott retorted, firmly.
“This student might as well have taken the password from one of you, but let’s not discount the possibility that one of your roommates is equally guilty.”
Then Harry took a step forward, shyly lifting one of his hands and putting it on one of his cheeks. Draco could feel the warmth of Potter’s fingers against his skin, his thumb moved gently in a slight touch that accentuated the heartbeat against his chest.
“Oh yeah? And what makes you say that?” He replied, his patience is slowly crumbling.
Yes, Malfoy had also made him jealous…
Would he manage to fly after that terrible night? Were his reflexes not withered?
"It never seemed to bother you," Harry jeered, beginning to open the button on his pants.
"Apparently, the last time wasn’t enough for you... Potter" Malfoy replied behind him, in a smooth voice.
“We haven’t talked about it yet, but I feel it’s coming.” he muttered, glaring at Malfoy in spite.
Yet he could feel his lower stomach contract at the thought of taking Malfoy’s taste and touching the thin skin of his lips while he had them right in front of his eyes, so accessible, so tempting. He licked his own before raising his eyes to those of Malfoy to see that he had his eyes fixed on his own lips.
Draco folded and unfolded his hand, feeling the heat of the spell spreading under the pores of his skin, immediately healing the crack in the center of his palm to leave no trace of it.
He almost instantly raised his eyes to Malfoy who raised an eyebrow visibly waiting for his answer.
Harry’s breathing became more difficult to control as he saw the situation slipping away.
"But how come I don't know about it?! I couldn't miss such important information! It's not possible!" Draco blew, passing a hand in his hair, dropping a few strands on his forehead.
Harry was sweating, his breathing was getting more and more complicated to deal with.
Harry stared at him for a moment, lingering on the blond lashes that moved as he read. Malfoy’s eyes went through the book from left to right, sometimes frowning when he didn’t seem to understand the meaning of a sentence.
Harry looked at him without blinking, then finally nodded his head before letting go of his grip on his hair, lowering his arm on Ron’s shoulder to press it.
"I don't bloody know, I freaked out!" he tried to explain, embarrassed.
"You're going to make me believe that you're not turned off by the fact that I love men?" he asked, amused in spite of himself.
"No, I didn’t like it, I hated it, okay?!" Harry replied, plunging his hateful green eyes into Malfoy’s grey ones.
Harry let go of his hand, using both his arms to rise up completely, the bust straight in front of him, before turning away to fix the wall, the red rising to his cheeks.
Potter’s body was now frantically rubbing against his, panting loudly as his warm breath crashed into the hollow of his neck. One of his thighs positioned itself between his legs, encountering the painful erection of Draco who bitten his own lip hard not to scream.
"Oh, nothing special, except maybe you almost choked me with
“So what? For fuck’s sake Harry, there’s got to be something or someone who puts you in that state!” Ron shouted, moving slightly on his bed to totally face him.
Harry felt him relax as his hands left his pelvis to crawl up his back with his fingertips, which ripped off an impossible-to-repress thrill. Malfoy then grabbed his shoulders and held them tightly before pushing him back to force him to withdraw and lied down on his back at his side.
Malfoy, who was about to throw his powder into the hearth, instantly froze and turned his head in his direction.
So he trampled like a fool in front of the building, sighing.
“Yeah… Just my leg is a little stiff, but it’ll get better in a few days.”
Unfortunately, Potter’s behavior was once again as violent as it was when he was in Hogwarts and he had to deal with this aspect of his personality for the second time.
“I- I don’t know…. Maybe.” he replied, looking away, unable to face the young woman's piercing eyes.
Harry tensed up on his chair. He turned slightly to watch them settle down. In particular Malfoy who slowly removed his scarf to gently place it on the edge of the table before take off his gloves.
“Holy shit!”
“Sorry, mate, but for us it’s complicated too,” Ron replied in a comprehensive tone.
Then Harry would put the picture back against the table, wincing against the heartbeat of his heart that instantly filled with the vision of Malfoy’s lips to delight his own, to the warmth down to his lower belly to this simple idea.
The second friendly game of the season was tonight and Ginny’s team had trained hard to face their new opponents.
He honestly never thought he’d leave Ginny. However, when he went home tonight and joined her in the living room, he was convinced it was the right thing to do. And even now, with his glass still intact in his hand, he did not regret.
Ever since he met Malfoy and they had regular sex, Harry had always been on top. More specifically, Harry was always the one who started their shags and had, therefore, never let Malfoy take over during it.
“So what am I?” he asked, puzzled.
“Seriously, are you okay?” he asked, in a strangely worried tone.
“A case little more complicated than usual.”
Harry rolled his eyes, sighing.
Harry proceeded cautiously in the main driveway until he found another door a little to the right where the name of Draco Malfoy appeared in fine letters leaning as his handwriting. He took a deep breath and knocked firmly before allowing himself to open without waiting for an answer.
Potter’s fingers shyly parted to let appear his beautiful green eyes, too bright, and lay on Draco's palm exposed to the sky, patiently waiting for him to cover it with his own.
Harry opened wide his eyes.
“No Harry. I don’t think Voldemort was behind this idea. Also, all Death Eaters are actively sought after and none can get close enough to Hogsmeade without being immediately intercepted.” Dumbledore replied, in a tone that was intended to be reassuring but that only accentuated the fear that seized his body as well as his mind.
His fame had only increased and it bothered him a lot, he had never liked being in the front of the stage.
And every day, he was grateful to fate for putting him on his way...
It was all his
Harry looked at him, suspicious.
“Go fuck yourself!” Harry shouted, turning his back to get back on his way to his dorm.
“I’m not allowed to follow you…” he explained.
Potter was always smiling but suddenly frowned at the serious look on Draco's face.
Harry felt that his desire was not the same as his desire for Malfoy, but he really loved Ginny. And there she needed him. Needed him to show her it was true. So, he let her undress him and put his lips all over him.
Very few wizards had the ability to use this gift, he himself was not able to master it enough to read clearly in the minds of others.
Harry raised his eyebrows.
"Malfoy..." he blew, in a half whisper, unable to control the sound of his voice.
Harry was staring at him, frowning, with the look of someone trying to untangle what he has just assimilated.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
He closed his eyes and realized that Malfoy had not left his thoughts while touching her. Harry contracted his jaws to the done deal. He had sought Malfoy in the young woman, he had wanted her to be…
Harry opened wide his eyes. He was kidding him, right? This fucking bastard had just come in his hand moaning like a desperate man, and now he denigrated the moment as if he had not appreciated it.
Harry breathed deeply, trying to empty his mind to assess the situation.
He had just kissed Malfoy...
Hands held on his arms to prevent him from going further and a slight pressure brought him back to his bed where his head fell heavily against the pillow he felt encompassing him. This had the merit of taking off a little more his eyelids that he blinked several times without ever succeeding in opening them completely for that reason.
"Fine, I see you have a lot to say, so I'll take care of what's not my business, a little further," he replied in a tone without calling, before he quickly walked away.
Sitting on one of the benches in the park, his hands in the pockets of his pants, he looked at the trees rocked by the light breeze that touched his face and closed his eyes under this pleasant caress. He reopened them to look at the water bordering one of the aisles of the campus and stared at the few ducks swimming.
Ron frowned, anxious to see him so disturbed.
He got up, by-passing Malfoy, his two hands shoving his hair, his wand still in one of them.
Malfoy had become a drug he could hardly do without.
The excitement was in Ron’s eyes and Harry knew that the same glow was also reflected in his own. Fear also ran through their veins but made live this love of the danger they had always had.
One of the customers scoffed to his right and made him turn his head by reflex. One of the people at the table was telling a story that turned out to be exceedingly funny because all the guests seemed to have an uncontrollable laugh.
“What if I do?”
Malfoy glanced at him for a moment, before turning his gaze on the book he was holding.
Harry shook his head, disillusioned, and then anchored his eyes again in Malfoy’s.
It stabbed him in the heart without warning because he had never felt such pain, such a powerful grip on someone in his fucking life.
"Yes! You have to go out for a bit and then you’re not going to let me go alone, are you?" Ron added without waiting for Harry’s answer.
“What do you mean?” Harry replied, frowning.
The Room of Requirement had been the landmark of Dumbledore’s army where Harry and his friends had secretly studied the Defense Against the Dark Arts, much like the most useless Umbridge’s courses, allowing them to perfect themselves in different spells.
“He always had the annoying tendency to look at me to piss me off... It shouldn’t surprise you any more, it’s Malfoy after all” Harry sighed, turning his eyes away.
And if her caresses cried out her desire, her gaze was filled with love. Then Harry had let her kiss him. He had let her undress him and made love to him to show Ginny that he felt the same way.
“No need, I can go alone, you stay here to help others.” had then blown Harry, holding back a moan of pain.
The trinket placed on his classroom table seemed to taunt him more than usual, almost exhausting his nerves already fried with too strong a sensitivity.
Harry raised his eyebrows.
“We’ll be back soon, Harry!” Hermione promised, her eyes betraying the restlessness that had not left her.
Not hearing anything particular, he took care to knock slightly to signify his presence and opened the door delicately to sink inside. It was dark. Only the low brightness of the living room gave a glimpse of the furniture in the room.
"I don't know, I foolishly thought that after everything we've been through, you just wouldn't hate me anymore, but after the witch press revealed that I was gay, and… why Zabini cowardly ran away, I thought that was what made you hate me again," he sighed, looking disappointed.
“But then… It would be someone from Gryffindor? How else could he pass the portrait? ” he breathed, his eyes anchored in the Cauldrons Cakes that were now floating a few inches from the office.
Draco didn't take it apart and raised a loud voice.
"Well, I have to go" he added, raising his inexpressive, metallic eyes.
His gaze was almost indifferent, as if Harry were nothing to him, as if they had never seen each other before, as if their past were not common. Harry blinked, stunned by so much detachment, at the lack of interest he read in that bloody glance.
He closed his eyes, taking advantage of his girlfriend’s warm hand, seeming to appease somewhat the rancor that had been burning him since yesterday.
Harry blinked several times before frowning.
“What if I don’t want to anymore?” Malfoy asked, lying on his back, leaning on his elbows, raising a sarcastic eyebrow.
Maybe at the Dursley’s?
“But it bothers me to see my sister and my best friend making out!” Ron took offence.
"Merlin, Potter, would you please stop screaming!" he hissed, annoyed.
“Gawain Robards, our wonderful boss”.
Each time Harry had shown him an idea, Draco had mimicked with his fingers the immediate urge to throw up all of his guts on the floor, because the objects and decoration were so disgusting.
He turned his head in their direction but saw only the bleachers where only a few students were present to encourage them. He thought he could ear the rustling of cloth, like the rustling of a dress that rubs when one moves and the flapping of the sides that hit the ground under the effect of the wind.
He had let go in Malfoy’s arms and bitterly regretted it...
“Potter, I asked you a question!” Nott added, grabbing his wrist to hold him.
“I … I’m not sure I’m doing it right … this is the first time I’ve done this…” he explained, biting his lower lip.
Harry walked into his dorm slamming the door. He kicked the trash in front of him, insulting it.
What he did to him, was so good, he forgot the embarrassment of being touched by a guy.
Draco felt that something was slipping through his fingers when he saw his best friend and Potter also suddenly complicit but still couldn't put his finger on it.
There had been a few scathing remarks, but these were strangely reminiscent of humour or concealed compliments.
But he only passed by him, simply brushing his shoulder against his own, without detaching his gaze from Harry.
Harry felt that if Malfoy didn’t take him now he might die from it so much pleasure he felt was intense. Malfoy fulfilled his wish by delicately removing his fingers, which caused Harry to growl, to lose the sensation that had become pleasant to have them inside him.
mean?” Harry shouted, out of him.
“Voldemort only marked those he considered to be in his ranks. I have never been more than a pawn in his eyes. That’s why I never received the mark” he explained, in a perfectly calm tone.
Harry supported his gaze, the erratic breathing of having wanked Malfoy and of having seen him come against him.
“But honestly, it’s Malfoy... One of the most rotten guys we’ve ever met, I can’t imagine him having a conversation, don’t you think?” Ron added.
Harry had swallowed, salivating profusely under the sweet smell of jam, toasted bread, and tea that filled his nostrils.
He barely swallowed, remembering this painful and embarrassing memory of his past and began to put on his lemon-green outfit, stitched with the healers' emblems: a wand crossed with a bone.
Raising a sceptical eyebrow, Draco followed the path of his thought and scrutinized his own hand before realizing that a stain of blood was spreading between his fingers and slowly widening. A slight tingling inside his palm confirmed that he had undoubtedly cut himself when he struck his hand on the table to stop Potter’s drift. He turned his hand to expose it to the sky and noticed some pieces of glass inlaid in his flesh, in the middle of a small bloody circle.
“Clothes… I had chosen them for you in the new shop on Diagon Alley» he added, a slight smile in the corner, a little sad.
Draco gauged him for a moment, still not knowing what the hell Potter was getting at.
“Come on, let’s go home” Draco added, to stop this strange obsession that Potter had since he woke up this morning.
“Why are you looking at me? You’ve got a problem?” Noah hissed.
He then jumped into one of the campus showers, to thoroughly rinse the torture that his subconscious had inflicted on him.
Malfoy frowned, not seeing this time, absolutely not what it was all about.
“Far be it from me to put an end to this particularly touching painting, but I think Hermione is waiting for you to clean up the rest of the decoration” he intervened with his dragging voice.
“I guess you were inspiring me.” He explained, before drinking a sip of whiskey. He licked his lips and turned his dark eyes towards him. “And it wasn’t just you, remember the song for Weasel. Another one of my wonderful finds.” He added, stretching another smirk.
try to calm down and rest” Draco sighed, deprived.
Malfoy was messing with him. He said he liked making him lose his mind and showed Harry that he wanted to do it again, if he was interested too.
His last forces were leaving him, tiredness regaining control over all the information and events he had gone through in such a short time, completely defeating him.
He get upset, grabbing a book that was lying around and threw it across the room. He did the same with the various books in the library, overturning many of the trinkets that hung there.
“Ron…”
Harry had not slept all night. He had refused to give in to sleep for fear of deviating again in his dreams. It was the first time he had done that. He had never thought of anyone other than Ginny since his sixth year at Hogwarts while he masturbated...
He and Blaise had never been very close, but had learned to appreciate each other over the years by rubbing shoulders. He was grateful to Pansy for falling in love with the young man to count him in his friends today. The list was not the longest… Only Ron and Hermione and of course
“For your information, this horrible costume as you call it, was one of my creations! You have no idea how many hours it took me to sew enough fabric so that Crabbe and Goyle could be completely covered.” Malfoy retorted, raising a disdainful eyebrow.
He didn’t see the time go by.... He didn’t pay attention to the time he left.
“Well, I hope you found them because this is the last time you touch that bloody vial!”
Draco remained forbidden, hardly assimilating the information, staring without seeing the Survivor before him.
When he woke up the next day, the nausea had finally passed had resumed. He’d been dreaming about Malfoy all night and never getting rid of him. As if his subconscious wanted to kill him with a peroxidised blond.
“As if I did it on purpose!” Harry took offence, a handkerchief under his nose, his head slightly forward.
He looked taller, more muscular as well, although always slim and slender. His hair was no longer clad back as usual, resting on the sides, adorning his fine face, less sharp than in his memories, a few strands running through his forehead, fallen before his eyes.
The pain was immeasurable and Harry squeezing his teeth tightly while his hands grabbed the sheets. Malfoy’s face faded when he closed his eyes, unable to resist the violent sensation that was passing through his body. He groaned with pain between his teeth when Malfoy’s sex slowly retreated to withdraw entirely.
He could not prevent his eyes from traveling on the details of his face, the few blond strands carefully brought back to the temples, framing Malfoy’s gaze, always resting on him, making it stand out more dim than it was. His lips were half-open, and his teeth were perfectly aligned. Harry looked down, exploring his chin and Adam’s apple, looking at his square shoulders, which were straight in shape. He stopped, however, when he fell on the bust underlining his pectorals and his pimples of flesh have hardened.
He opened the dial and observed it before closing it and storing it in the garment.
“Show me how much you hate me and hump me, Malfoy!”
All was well for a few weeks, he had stopped thinking about Malfoy and had resumed the course of his life.
“Harry? Are you okay?”
“It doesn’t change the fact that it’s Malfoy, Hermione, and whatever he’s trying to do, he’s still the son of a Death eater and a Death eater himself.” Ron jeered.
“Great drawing Dean! You think I can keep it?” Ron asked, impressed by his friend’s sketch.
Harry opened them, feeling Malfoy moving away. He got up and walked away from the bed to put on his clothes.
“Now you’re going to listen to me, Potter, it’s not about coming across on a bad memory that concerns me, but about the fact that you’re going to end up messing with your brain! Do I have to remind you that you had Obliviate and that dug a deep hole in your fucking brain for many years! If you ever want to get back to your memories, try not to mess it up until you do!” he shouted, frustrated.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Harry was still searching for his words when Malfoy rose from his bed, the blanket slipping on his skin and discovered his completely naked body. He stood in front of him and walked one step forward to surround his hand firmly on his sex.
“I… It… must…” he began, forcing on his voice before a straight cough took him back.
Then he nodded silently, without bothering to check if Harry had seen him do it and closed the door behind him.
Harry squinted his eyes, realizing that he was playing the fool and fully understood who he was referring to.
What if it was him that Malfoy was came to find?
Malfoy pushed him away and backed back enough to totally break the kiss.
Despite all their common past, it wasn’t enough to get Theo to talk about Potter’s wizard therapy session.
But none of the spells were able to defeat the unquestionably too powerful one that held him here.
He no longer cared for anything while his mouth foraged his, their teeth colliding at times, their erratic breath at every moment.
It was painful and hot, fragile and powerful and it kept him from breathing properly.
Harry took a few seconds of reflection before replying, searching his memory for what it was.
Harry listened to him seriously, realizing that he had paid the price for a subtle manipulation worthy of an ex-Slytherin, being absolutely not surprised.
“At least it changes from the off-white and anthracite grey that Astoria decided to impose on me… I’ve never seen such sad colours for a wedding.”
"Where what?" he asked, puzzled.
This at least had the merit of making him jump slightly before he steps back without letting go of his eyes.
“Take us to your place, I have to talk to Ron and Hermione,” he said.
“Good evening, Harry.” he said, standing right in front of the foot of his bed.
“I just want everything back to the way it was…”
He stared at the trees for a few more moments, seeming lost in his thoughts again before turning completely and extending his arm in its direction.
Harry raised his eyebrows before blinking several times, surprised by the question.
Harry felt he could open his eyes. He had finally done it. He had succeeded in eradicating the evil dreams of his mind. The small spots escaped from his retina as he lifted his eyelids.
For nothing in the world he would have missed this moment.
Every time he came out of Malfoy’s dorm, he wanted to go right back. It never did that to him with Ginny. Besides, he didn’t do much with her anymore. He couldn’t touch her without visualizing Malfoy. Even kissing her became difficult. He always wanted her but not as often as before. Not after tasting Malfoy’s soft lips and skillful tongue. Not after his pleasure increased tenfold in Malfoy’s arms.
Harry raised his eyebrows before sighing again and coming straight at him, stopping at his height. He then leaned his head to the side to give him a feverish kiss, tipping him back, until the back of his head touched the pillow.
Harry raised his eyebrows, surprised to be released so quickly and could not prevent a smile stretching his lips at the prospect of finally finding his bed and his comrades again tonight.
"Are you kidding me? Couldn't you tell me at the end instead of putting your tongue into my mouth?" he hissed, wiping his mouth with his hand.
They glanced at him before staring at each other again.
"Relax, Potty, I'm just messing with you, I hate this mistletoe as much as you do."
Draco grinned, before carrying his glass to his lips, emptying his glass and clapping his tongue on the roof of his mouth, sighing with contentment.
Harry reveled in the sight Malfoy offered him. His moans became more raucous as he exerted this pressure on his sex.
Harry and Ron had not wasted any time and had run to the apparition spot to Side-Along directly at the crime scene. They had arrived in the middle of the attack where several Aurors like them were already casting spells against their attackers.
Ron, on the other hand, grabbed a drink from the nightstand and filled it with water before he gave it so quickly that he dropped a few drops on the sheets.
He then began to search for his clothes scattered all over the room during their eventful exchange in the evening. Harry dressed in haste, his heart still beating against his chest, foolishly fearing that the beats he heard so loud in his ears would awaken Malfoy.
Blinking, he quickly looked around the room to see that he was well in the infirmary of Hogwarts as he had suspected. He squished on the edges of his glasses which had regained their usual round appearance and a violent panic rose up in his throat to prevent him from breathing.
Harry swallowed with difficulty and took a deep breath knowing full well that he could not hold his words.
Harry did not listen to him and freed his arm to pull again on the shirt that masked part of his body. Despite a second attempt, Malfoy did not manage quickly enough to block his wrist
Obviously, Draco was, so Potter lost his smile and raised his eyebrows.
Jealousy resurfaces as quickly as it left. This feeling burned all the pores of his skin, at the same time igniting his mind which suddenly came to life, swinging mortuary pictures against Noah who kissed Malfoy under his nose.
“No, not this time.” he blow, while his heart was beating louder against his chest.
Harry contracted his jaw and continued on his way to an indefinite destination before finally stopping at the bar. He ordered mead and almost drowned in it hoping someone would get it out. And that someone sat beside him, barely two minutes later. Malfoy, still oozing and euphoric of his hypnotic dance, ordered in his turn a drink with a gasping voice.
Harry knew he wouldn’t last much longer. His arm was now trembling between his holding hand, preventing him from falling under the weight of magic emanating from it.
“What do you mean, “Where are we”?” He replied, confused.
Harry saw him slowly looked down on his lips and then on his shoulders and chest, which he observed for a long time before he lowered a little more to his stomach, then his hips and then lifted his eyes up to his face. He stared at him for a few seconds before looking away and swallowing hard.
An amusing glimmer was in his silver-grey eyes as he looked at Harry as he had never done before.
"Ah... again on You-know-who? I thought you wouldn’t do it anymore..." he asked visibly annoyed by the situation.
He had to.
Harry winced before complying.
"Slytherin, obviously" Harry said, looking at the room.
On his nightstand, his alarm clock was at 12:30 a.m., and he decided to take a shower before going to bed. Harry grabbed his pajamas and towel before heading to the bathrooms across the hallway from the different rooms.
"Potter… Who is this person for whom you have a crush?" he said, scared to death.
He had also caught himself looking at her when she passed by him, he even imagined himself kissing her two or three times.
“What makes you think that, please?”
“God, Harry… You scared us so much…” Hermione added, in a trembling voice.
"Well, since you obviously need reassurance on the matter, open your ears and take what I’m about to tell you well because I won’t repeat it. I do appreciate our carnal exchanges and especially when you are “
He wanted to get rid of those fucking memories he had of that last night, where he had finally felt
“Likely”
But holy shit, nothing made sense in his fucking head for days. He wasn’t even sure he’d actually made it back to the world he knew.
"Hermione, please come, it’s urgent!" he shouted behind him.
… the way I did. I never intended to kill you! I was only defending myself and I am convinced that if you could, you would have done it without hesitation!” he hissed, annoyed to be held solely responsible.
A smile stretched his lips, when he realized that the object was still as frozen, even after he had stopped his magic.
He had to stop this before it got worse!
When Harry lowered his eyes again to Malfoy, he froze when he noticed that Malfoy was watching him. Harry frowned when he saw a malicious smile stretching his lips. He then saw Malfoy grabbing his neighbour’s neck and kissing him on his mouth without leaving Harry’s eyes.
"Well, what’s happening to you, mate? You look like you saw a ghost," he asked with a funny smile.
“Yeah…she has a serious problem with family events… She’s already planning on marrying me and Angelina when we’re not even engaged.” George nodded, pointing his drink at Harry.
“Good evening sir” he replied, raising the eyes to anchor them in the piercing blue that seemed to probe him.
“What if it doesn’t happen? If it doesn’t work and I stay the way I am?” he challenged him to answer.
He and Malfoy had been meeting almost every other night for almost a month now to satisfy their common desire to touch.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, and then he started it! He keeps taunting me every time we come to eat. He hates me!" he replied, defensively.
While all the utensils were sharpening around him, he went to the sink to splash fresh water on his face, basking in the goodness of the water as it dripped down his skin. He then took a cloth to sponge off the few drops that were slipping on his face and sighed into the cloth that he kept for a moment against his skin, with his eyes closed.
about Malfoy… Only Cho and Ginny brought that feeling to him a few years ago when he saw them on other guys' arms.
"Malfoy!" he shouted, banging on the door.
and don’t you dare come back! Anyway, I’d be too busy “spreading my thighs” to welcome you if you ever decide to take responsibility for the facts!” Malfoy hissed, a deep contempt in the voice.
“I swear you, Mione, he had almost scared me with his “look how I’ve changed, I’ve become a junkie”” Ron mimicked with a chicken leg in his hands.
Harry’s smile also widened as a puffed laugh escaped from his lips without him being able to help himself. Malfoy seemed to calm down a little, his smile still perched on his lips before it diminished very slowly while his gaze became deeper and more piercing. Harry was still smiling slightly, frowning at Malfoy’s sudden change in behaviour.
A strange feeling ran through his heart when Harry immediately recognized the Leaky Cauldron located between a bookstore and a record shop.
“Wait, what? How does that “create”? How could I have done that?” He asked, while the panic was gaining ground inside him.
“Come on Potter, you’re not leaving yet, you’ve just arrived…and
“Harry, Draco?” a distant voice made in a room of the house.
Blinking, Harry stared at him for a few moments, impressed by the hatred that deformed his still fully relaxed features when he was still inside him.
“Malfoy, where are we? And what the hell are you doing here?” Harry asked, completely panicked.
Harry glanced at him and nodded silently.
“What are you talking about?”
His screams became hoarser as she continued and he brought her back to him to kiss her passionately while quickly removing her clothes. The last clothe on the ground, he detailed his feminine curves and tipped Ginny under him, kissing her again, playing with his tongue.
“I didn’t wait for you, Potter. Find someone else to regulate your cravings” Malfoy replied, in a smirk.
“No” Draco replied, with a firm voice.
Harry had hoped so much to fall asleep and return to the dormitory that he had left, at the same time rediscovering his age and his previous life. But as he suspected, that was not the case, of course. Nothing was ever as he hoped… It was always like that with him, everything had to be irreparably complicated…
He performed a quick cleaning spell while she was putting on a bathrobe, then she caressed his cheek before leaving the room towards the showers.
But he had no choice…
“Why? You’re afraid that I’ll come across something that I should not?” he asked, with some contempt.
A flash of lucidity erupted and the anger passed through him before he went any further to lay his arms stretched out on the desk, bending his face towards that of the young man.
The cogs set in place, operating at full speed, while an incongruous idea was born in his perilous mind.
Malfoy uttered a pronounced exclamation, scowling at him while Harry hardly rose from the bed to stand.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and loosely stretched a grin.
“It reminds me of that ridiculous badge you wore during the Triwizard tournament.”
“I’ve never been fond of this kind of representation, but it seems to me that
"That’s not-" Harry began, in a hoarse voice.
Draco blinked several times before answering.
He had been working there for a short time, having missed his NEWTs one time but had succeeded them brilliantly the second time.
"Fuck you, Malfoy!" he hissed, the words coming out alone, without taking the time to simply think them.
And somewhere in his mind, he couldn’t stop a little voice from blowing him that he was wrong and that he was perfectly stupid.
Harry was so impulsive that it was never easy to find out what state of mind he was going to find him in when he got out of bed.
So he hardly got up from the couch, leaning on the armrest so as not to fall down and walked with a nervous step towards the door where Harry was.
“My memories… My neurons are in their place” Harry hissed, giving Blaise a wicked gaze.
There was nothing around them anymore, it seemed to them that no one could see them, as time seems to have stopped when their lips touched.
Harry finally lowered his head and turned his attention to Hermione, without a look at him.
And Harry exploded…
“Completely drugged would be a more appropriate term,” Harry winced.
One of the glasses filled with juice was dangerously vacillating and the liquid spilled in large drops on the table when it started to crack on the top. A larger and deeper line formed on the glass before it exploded and scattered into several pieces of glass that landed on Draco’s plate.
“We have to leave you, we have Transfiguration class in five minutes and we still have to cross the entire castle to get there.” Hermione announced, looking at the watch on her wrist.
Draco unfolded the scroll, comforting, not surprisingly, Ron’s writing inside.
“Far be it from me to contradict you, but I really find it hard to believe you...” Malfoy replied.
Harry sighed, detailing Ron’s anxious features.
Why did it have to be false?
Draco raised a skeptical eyebrow.
“I don’t believe you, you really seemed to like it when I
Harry briefly turned his head towards him, with a sarcastic smile on his lips.
In hindsight, Draco was convinced that this was exactly what he was waiting for, but despite the fact that he had a strong penchant for power, he did not have his temper and, in all modesty, was not as smart as he was.
Because it was true, Malfoy had always spent most of his time ruining his life and now he was going on… Even after ten fucking years, if it was true…
"You bastard…" Harry whispered between his teeth, that he was squeezing and wrinkling his eyes.
“Hey!” she said, with a little smile on her lips.
Why was fate once again trying to prove him wrong?
So yes, it was worth thinking about and he already knew the answer.
He was about to drink another sip of his beverage when a small group passed by his side accidentally rushing him.
Nott went up the stairs quickly, probably to stop him in his madness.
Hermione was right, they were far from Hogwarts now and the war was over. It was not in any way beneficial to them to look into bullshit like Malfoy and his dubious friends. They had much better things to do with their studies and their love life.
Harry never saw Ron’s gaze resting strangely on him before turning around to stare at Malfoy and look down as if he had realized something was up.
No one moved, too shocked by the scene unfolding in front of them. Malfoy and Potter spoke without insulting each other! It had never happened and it was really special.
Harry squinted his eyes.
“No, Harry, there’s no problem I assure you, let him go please, it’s rather embarrassing to see him in this position.” Ron sighed, rubbing his sleeve for remove ashes.
He heard Nott coming behind him, breathing with difficulty.
Draco chuckled nervously.
Harry knelt on the bed, raising Malfoy’s pelvis to position it in front of him, clasping between his legs. Malfoy looked at him, his empty gaze, seeming not to believe for a moment what he was about to do.
Harry’s heart missed a beat as his whole body froze in front of Draco Malfoy who sat a few tables in front of them accompanied by his friends. He remained for a few seconds before closing his mouth, swallowing with difficulty as his throat was dry, the muscles of his jaw contracting painfully as he tried to swallow his saliva.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows before smiling bitterly.
He was afraid to have really imagined Malfoy’s answer when he stared at him without moving before finally putting a hand in his pocket to pull out what looked like a pocket watch.
Harry had a gasp, biting his lip to restrain his groans.
as to bring your ass back here so we can talk seriously?" Harry hissed, taking on him, knowing that if he insulted him, Malfoy wouldn’t move.
Extinguishing his mind just for the time of one last fleeting caress.
Harry finally came back to him and blinked to see that he was standing a few meters from him and raised a sceptical eyebrow. He looked at him for a moment, his hair with bluish reflections by the torches hanging on the walls and his bright grey eyes which seemed to probe him on all sides.
