“Daddy loves Dumbledore, if you stayed with us, he’d let him know the moment you left,” Luna commented, her sad eyes trained on him and he gave her a soothing smile.
“You hurt him,” the blonde hissed and Parkinson shook her head and let out cry as Draco snarled.
Dumbledore was next to him muttering something and Harry watched as he transfigured a rock into a small rowboat for the two of them. It was shaky ride to the cave entrance and Harry was thoroughly soaked once his feet connected with the ground. Consciously using his wand, he dried himself off before getting a good look at where they were.
, though it was a moment too late that Harry realized Conner had animated some of the nearby chairs that had stumbled their way towards them.
Harry weighed his options; he could have Malfoy heal him or make his way to the Hospital Wing. He was terrible at healing charms and if he went to see Madam Pomfrey he’d have to explain the fight and that could get everyone in trouble. Removing his glasses, he turned his head towards Malfoy, who had pointed his wand at the bruise that was quickly turning dark.
Turning to Flagley, Harry’s first mission was to find a place to stay. He thought he’d have enough money to get a room but without Gringotts he wasn’t sure how he’d get more.
Mister Malfoy picked up his cane and pushed himself out of his seat, it was a moment before he said anything.
Dinner was a typical affair except that the group sat with one another at the end of the Slytherin table. Since it was an informal meal setting many students mingled with another and sat at various tables, the group did receive some odd looks, especially once the Weasley siblings had entered, but with ease the looks were ignored.
which had caused the creature to rear back.
“I know it’s in poor taste, but how do you feel?” Harry refrained from a snarky response and shrugged.
“Attacking a student is against school rules,” she admonished, “Let’s go to Dumbledore to have him sort this out,” Hermione’s eyes caught sight of two figures walking towards them and Harry noticed both Draco and Blaise were on edge as they approached the group.
There was something behind the door that he was meant to see; he stared at the handle for a few moments before he reached out and just as he clasped the knob in the palm of his hand, the door swung open and he stumbled in.
“I doubt any of them would open up to me Professor,” Harry said dryly. Dumbledore’s frown deepened.
When Vernon had woke the next morning to find his wife and sons’ things gone he had left the house for hours, the growing pit of anxiety in Harry’s stomach was making him nervous and out of paranoia he had sent Hedwig to Luna’s and while he hadn’t heard from her since the disastrous trip to the Ministry he knew his winged partner would be safe there.
Harry’s anxiety spiked and he looked panicked at the locket. His magic was reacting to his emotions running high and the locket started to stir, as if trying to follow through a summons, his concentration shifted as something clutched at his leg.
“Mister Potter, welcome to the Malfoy manor,” with a wave of her hand Missus Malfoy led them towards where Harry assumed was dinner, her hand lingered with her husband as if calming him from a potential fit of rage.
“Luna!” said girl turned her head from where she was sitting, a slight smile on her face as Harry made his way towards her.
Blaise had jumped but only took a moment before he pointed his wand towards where Harry was standing, snickering Harry peered out from underneath the cloak hood, both Prefect’s stared at him in shock.
Draco was right, a few moments later Zabini’s head popped around the corner of the bookshelf and gave them a grin.
“I don’t know, at the start of term that hat sang a different song and brought up students and resorted a handful of us, the Headmaster was just as surprised as anyone,” rubbing at his chin Salazar looked thoughtful.
x.x.x.x.x
Silence.
“Mister Malfoy! Where have you been?” she scolded him, and Harry could see her eyes tracing his hand clutching his stomach.
As they finally broke apart Harry had to push aside the warm and fuzzy thoughts and concentrate on what Draco had said.
Nothing happened and Harry started to worry that his magic was being rejected but when the door suddenly glowed green and faded Harry breathed a sigh of relief, though as he looked towards the Zabini’s he frowned at the surprise look marring their faces.
“I don’t think it has to do with that, he’s teaching me a skill that is passed down from one family member to the next, and Tom wasn’t able to learn it, and this might be my only chance to keep the family,” he bobbed his head, “tradition alive,” Draco peered down at him with a small quirk of his lips.
Deciding he didn’t want to hide out in his dorm room the rest of the night Harry headed towards the library, he still hadn’t looked more into magical maturity. The first night he had gone there to study Madam Pince had followed him around assuming the worst, the following days she had relaxed somewhat but kept a sharp eye on him.
Stalking moodily to his room he waved towards Blaise, but his path was stopped by one of the seventh years.
Said blonde dabbed at his lips with a napkin and thin fingers reached out and grasped his.
The door opened with a bang and there were two gasps and Harry tried to hide himself more in the blonde’s arms.
“Are you gay?” the question had caught Malfoy off guard whose eyes had widened.
In the following weeks Harry felt as if he was having a relatively normal Hogwarts experience, more so than he ever had. He and Draco had spent more time together, from sitting next to each other at meals, to studying in the library, to playing chess in the common room, the mated pair found themselves getting to know one another. Blaise wasn’t far behind and soon whispers were breaking out in the Slytherin house about the new trio.
Not waiting for a response, he ran towards the entrance of the library with Blaise hot on his heels, ignoring the cries from the librarian that running was prohibited he turned down a hallway leading towards the stairs.
A loud bang had Nott turning his head in surprise and Harry looked up to see the bathroom door had been broken open and a very angry looking Veela stepped through.
“Yeah,” he whispered, dread settling in the pit of his stomach as his eyes traced his mock Transfiguration questions.
“Looked like two first years maybe? I told them that you were out in the courtyard,” Draco shot the Hufflepuff a glare and Neville faltered.
Turning around Harry watched in horror as a mangled corpse crawled towards them from the furthest side of the small island. It was sickly pale and missing a leg and its eyes were sunken in. It let out a strangled moan as it inched its way towards them.
blearily he looked to the voice that was calling out to him, it sounded so familiar.
Ripples broke across the lake as more of the Inferius started coming closer to them. Dumbledore had stepped around Harry and cast a spell to knock some of them back but with each one knocked down another two came closer.
The conversation had taken a turn when Draco had then explained that being a Veela was like having another part inside his mind and the Veela was very protective of his mate. Draco confessed that sometimes the Veela side would try take over and do anything to protect him and controlling that side of him was hard but how Harry understood it was with time Draco would have better control over his Veela.
“I would like that Mister Potter,” a brief blanket of silence covered the room.
“Well, if you need anything Harry, let me know,” beaming towards his friend he nodded and his attention was diverted when a second year, the name completely skipping him, came over to ask Draco for help with homework.
Harry crept up behind the two Prefects and watched as Blaise sent Draco relieved look.
Turning towards the two Blaise looked worried, “What’s wrong? I know everything with Dumbledore was shocking but you both look worse than when I left you.”
Flipping himself around Draco’s hips he pinned the Veela’s hands above the blonde hair and gave his mate a sly look.
Draco didn’t say any more on the topic and Harry didn’t venture bringing it up again until he had a better plan to present the blonde. He understood the recklessness of the idea but he knew that meeting with Tom was the right thing to do; the man needed to be told everything that Harry had found out, since neither of them could kill each other they needed to turn their attention to the true enemy, Dumbledore.
“I see your lying skills haven’t improved in the slightest, Mister Malfoy must not be teaching you the tricks he learned at a young age,” at the mention of his mate Harry’s face fell and he heard the Professor sigh.
“If you don’t stop moving,” the teen trailed off with a moan as Harry wiggled around more, there was a growl as Draco rolled on top of his smaller mate.
“You knew Draco’s parents when they were bonded?” he asked incredulously and snapped his mouth shut at the man’s annoyed look.
Draco pressed their foreheads together and gave a quick peck to his nose, only chuckling once Harry had scrunched up his face.
Silver fox.
“A bit each day, I don’t think I’m in any state to duel without my wand but small things, like the warming charm, has come a lot easier,” he said as he rubbed at the bridge of his nose.
Harry mused.
“What did you do Harry,” clasping his hands behind his back Harry shot him what he hopped was an innocent look.
“I need to step out for a quick moment Harry,” moving on autopilot Harry nodded and listen as the door clicked softly.
They had warded a room in the dungeons knowing that none of the Professors, except for Snape, would get curious enough to try and break the ward. It was Blaise’s idea to adjust the ward to recognize each of their magical signatures so they could enter without having to remove the ward and put it back up again once they left.
“We saw Death Eaters at the Ministry at the end of the year,” Harry’s brows furrowed as he was piecing together what she was implying.
“Well, we can take this as an opportunity for you to find any valuable information from the students and their ties with Voldemort,” Harry’s fists clenched, Dumbledore said students, but meant Slytherins.
He didn’t understand how Tom and that brand of dark magic came together. From Dumbledore’s perspective it wasn’t something talked, or written about, so how had the Dark Lord figured it out?
“Please Professor, let me go, please!” the cries were getting more hysterical and just as Harry moved enough to see the person pleading a glimmer from his side caught his attention.
Blaise snickered and Harry turned to glare, but the Slytherin Prefect gave him a smirk, “Despite the change of houses, you’ve got yourself a loyal set of friends Harry.”
Ron hadn’t given Harry a moment to regain his balance or to send a spell back, so when another
The boys gawked and Harry explained the best way to achieve that was to first practice aiming Bludgers at the practice dummies and then to practice hitting a Bludger at the same time.
Seviper let out an excited hiss and slithered his way back into the center of the canopy.
“It was when I tried to see you, your father was in such a rage that you had been hurt his magic had flung me out of the room,” he said softly, partially hoping his mate wouldn’t have heard him.
“You didn’t have to return the favor,” a gruff voice said from behind him and Harry stuck his tongue out aware the blonde couldn’t see it.
Heading towards the door Harry was held back by a warm hand at his elbow.
“I had wondered why Mister Malfoy was in a right state today,” Harry felt his heart churn at the thought Draco had been a mess because he didn’t understand his own jealousy, but before Harry could apologize the Potions Professor continued.
There were certain things that she wouldn’t divulge with him. He had pressed and she had changed the topic immediately, Harry suspected that once she told him certain things that she’d disappear for good.
“Still frustrated?” Blaise asked gently as Draco sat himself next to Harry and rubbed at his knee, Harry briefly wondered how they would curb their affection once classes resumed.
“Better?” he asked and all he received was a curt nod in response.
Blaise sent Harry lopsided smile, “Draco has been a fan of the series since it came out during our third year, that’s the last one unfortunately.”
“Perfect, keep an eye out while I harvest it,” Draco said as he pulled the ingredient bag from his pocket aiming his wand at the root of the plant.
“Mister Malfoy, Mister Zambini, please escort Mister Potter and Missus Wright and Mister Bobeck to the Hospital Wing, I will fetch Professor Dumbledore,” there was no room for argument as the group headed up the various floors and hallways to the nurse; their Head of House had only separated at the last possible moment.
Like Zabini manor Harry was lost after the first turn down a different hallway, he’d be screwed if he ever got separated.
“I’m alright Professor,” Harry said, trailing off he watched the Headmaster push around a few pieces of parchment on his desk.
It wasn’t until after dinner that Harry arrived back in his room and put away his new attire. He was more than happy to toss all his old, torn up clothes into the bags to throw away later. Opting to spend some time on his homework he managed to finish two of the essays for Transfiguration and questionnaire for Charms, it was nearing midnight before he finally found himself asleep.
Harry wasn’t too surprised that his words came out as hiss, he tended to switch to Parseltongue when he was emotional.
“I denied him, and he was furious, claimed that it would be my biggest regret,” Dumbledore chuckled.
Concentrating on trinket he wanted it to be with Tom once more, wanted that piece of Tom to reside back within him, his magic pulsed around him and Harry forced his eyes to open as he hadn’t realized they had shut.
Tom shrugged, “I don’t know what I feel,” Harry hummed, and his eyes lingered close.
“During third year I spent a lot of time researching laws concerning creatures and whatnot regarding Hagrid; and then again during the nightmare that was Rita Skeeter,” she sneered and Harry gave her a grin, “I vaguely remembered parts of the law book talking about the adoptive heir law.”
It was as he got his hair wet that he felt a burst of air behind him, squinting behind him he let out a laugh as Draco’s eyes raked over his body, “Felt like waking up?” he asked amused and Draco just nodded, eyes not leaving the marks he had left.
“Agreed Granger, but we can’t outright ask him, and all of you knowing puts you at risk as Dumbledore is a skilled Legilimens,” Harry looked up at the blonde confused.
“I’m so happy you’re okay Harry!” Harry grinned as he listened to her chat about what had happened since the night before, Anderson was close at her heals and as the larger group made their way down through the halls in the dungeon Harry felt more relaxed despite the pain that he was still feeling.
Strapped to the table, with blood running out of the corner of his eyes and the side of his mouth, and small trickle out of his nose, laid He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.
“Is there any danger in making these changes with the potion?” Luna asked calmly as Blaise skimmed over the parchment.
Seviper hissed and Harry made a mental note to take the snake outside when the weather warmed, he was getting lazy from his spot on the bed.
As Draco’s hands found his hips Harry let out a moan and reluctantly pulled back, while the manor was big, he didn’t want to risk the possibility that Draco’s parents could see them.  Draco let out a gruff chuckle, eyes bright.
What felt like minutes, yet by Draco’s gentle shaking, had been a few hours, Harry pushed himself up. Blinking, he felt more like himself, and not so drained.
Harry spent the next day miserable, Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t let anyone see Draco but did tell him and Blaise that Draco had woken up for a bit before falling back to sleep. She said that the earliest that she’d release him was Wednesday and that was if he was showing signs of improvement. He had shown some progress, but she still wasn’t completely sure why he had collapsed.
Thank you for reading.
Draco had coaxed him to sitting on his bed and turning to face him, feeling hands cupping his cheeks he looked up into silver eyes.
“What did you sa – mumphhh,” without giving Draco any warning Harry had grabbed his hand and pulled him closer smashing their lips together.
“You didn’t think of that before coming to me?” Harry was about to make a snippy retort when he caught sight of Tom’s quirked lips.
“Hold on, hold on, no one needs to stay here with me for the holiday’s, I expect you all to go home and see your families, you know they’re missing you like crazy,” he wasn’t sure he had convinced them but they had gone quiet so Harry took something in that.
Once it seemed that everyone realized that nothing spectacular was happening with Harry Potter in their common room chatter between students spread and Harry watched from his spot as everyone seemed more relaxed and at ease than he had ever seen them during class or in the hallways.
“Well, we’d let the bond grow and develop,” Harry hummed.
The memory faded a few moments later and Harry blinked a few times before he recognized that he was back in the Headmaster’s office.
Conner’s voice had changed, and Harry realized he had disappointed the older Slytherin.
It was a silent affair as they each finished getting ready. Harry hadn’t realized how much had happened between his mate being cursed and waking up next to Draco. Yet as they reentered Draco’s room the blonde ushered him on the bed sitting down next to him and cupping the injured wrist gently in his hands.
“Um, do you have any recommendation of somewhere that,” Harry mulled over exactly what he wanted, “is more secluded and less busy than the Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade?” Something about the way Harry had said it tipped Stan off to his distressed and the older man tapped his lip with his finger.
“It was years after I felt the spark with Lucius that we mated, there were so many things that had happened in that time, so many awful things, Draco wasn’t our first child,” Harry felt as if his heart had stopped at that revelation, he looked towards her in shock.
and on cue a book whooshed into the air. It was surrounded by blue sparks and with each flap of the cover as it flew around sparks fell from it and scattered to the students below. A shriek had both Draco and Blaise standing in concern.
Tom looked at him with surprise.
“Well, what did Dumbledore want?” Harry grimaced.
; Murphy had only been able to dodge the silencing spell but was caught by the follow up spell and stumbled backwards.
Blaise leaned forward with his hands tucked under his chin as Harry collected himself after recalling the awful birth story.
The floor was the same stone that could found throughout the common room and the hallways and a large green rug was placed in the center, Harry was happy to see that his trunk had been set at the end of the bed. Looking at the clock on the end table Harry contemplated on whether he wanted to unpack or sleep.
Walking towards Tom Harry held out the locket to the man, seemingly unsure of what to do Tom grabbed a hold of it and sucked in a breath, the magic resonating from the locket surrounded Tom and the man’s eyes lost focus.
“Everything’s fine, Nev, I’m just ready for winter holidays,” Draco and Blaise had stopped to watch Harry closely and it took all of Harry’s willpower to maintain his relaxed demeanor.
But something still didn’t add up.
Tossing on one of his few outfits that hadn’t come from Dudley and wasn’t torn in random places Harry made his way to Sophia who looked just as frazzled as the afternoon he had arrived.
“Who else knows?” the anger in Draco’s voice was replaced with a softness that had only been reserved for when the two were alone.
Blaise was thrilled to see that Draco had got him new books on Charms and Transfiguration, he didn’t wait a moment before immersing himself in the first chapter.
Breakfast was a quiet affair after that, and the silence was broken when a house elf appeared next to Blaise.
Tentatively looking into his bag Harry was leery as to what he’d find; what he hadn’t expected was a black snack with a thin red line running down its back. Rolling his eyes Harry snorted at the duo’s devious attempt at scaring him, it was like they hadn’t remembered he could speak with snakes.
“Yes Theo, Potter clearly stepped out of the showered and decided he’d attack you, follow me, we’ll see what Professor Snape has to say about this,” Nott glowered at Harry who had moved himself next to Draco.
“I do believe you’ll be useful elsewhere,” shooting the founder a glare Harry turned and exited the room and the dungeon, he could vaguely hear footsteps behind him but ignored that the older man was following him.
“Thank you, Neville,” she giggled as the Hufflepuff’s cheeks tinted pink; Harry was about to make a comment when he watched Hermione walk in next to Ron and his heart dropped, unsure what to make of the scene.
“Godric believes he could be silent longer than Salazar,” Harry’s face split into a grin at that, it was such a Gryffindor thing to do.
As they walked out of the room Harry sided up next to his friend and gave him an uneasy look, “Blaise?” he didn’t know what he wanted to ask.
“Could it be something so simple I wonder?” he mused to himself.
“Shower?” Draco asked as he walked by Harry who had emerged from his room with bathroom toiletries, Harry nodded as they parted ways.
“Harry, we don’t know how he’ll react, and we don’t know who he’s with. He still has command of the Death Eaters and you’d be walking straight into a potential attack, just because he can’t kill you doesn’t mean someone else wouldn’t take the opportunity,” the Veela said coolly and Harry wormed his hand into the taller boys pocket and threaded their fingers together.
“It’s tradition to live in the Malfoy manor, but,” two fingers pushed up his chin, “we can live anywhere Harry,” a goofy grin appeared on his face and Draco swooped down for a kiss.
“Do you know what a Horcrux is Harry?” watching the Headmaster cautiously, Harry’s eyes didn’t leave him as his thumbed through the various pages.
Dumbledore’s brows furrowed as he nodded his head solemnly, hand stroking his beard as his eyes surveyed the room.
“Luna said that Dumbledore has been increasingly distressed since the beginning of break,” Harry frowned at Neville’s comment, feeling a small amount of guilt that he hadn’t kept in contact with either of the girls during break.
“Father, I would appreciate if you wouldn’t point your wand at my mate,” the Malfoy heir said coolly, and Mister Malfoy snarled.
“You should talk to him,” Zabini hadn’t said much during class and Harry had been prepared he might have brought up his situation with Malfoy.
So, Tom hadn’t got his information from the library.
Snapping her fingers, a small house elf appeared a moment later.
“Draco!?!”
She squeezed his hand and headed towards Ravenclaw with Luna in tow, Neville waved his own goodbye and Harry stood with Draco and Blaise at the entrance to the dungeons.
“Other pocket, dear,” he sent Lady Zabini an adoring look before bringing her hand to his lips and kissing her fingers, she giggled and he whispered something that brought a laugh and smile to her face, from the corner of his eye Harry saw Blaise tense.
Magic continued to swarm around Tom’s heart as a red pulsing orb lift out of the man. Harry noticed that Dumbledore was sweating something fierce, whatever he was doing was taxing on his own magic and his own strength.
“Harry’s never been anywhere outside of Hogwarts during break, he’d really enjoy the manor at this time of year,” Blaise pipped up and Snape’s eyes darted towards the Prefect.
“Who are you?” as if imagining a breeze, she closed her eyes and tilted her head back.
Frowning, Harry strained his ears to hear who was in the bathroom. Not hearing a stall open or close or another shower start, Harry felt his muscles tense once more.
“Uh, thanks Malfoy,” the blonde nodded and as he went to turn away Harry couldn’t help but ask.
“Laci, please bring the light dinner that was prepared for Blaise and Mister Potter,” the elf bowed again, and Harry shifted as her eyes landed on him.
It was a nursery lined with pink walls and cute animal print, with a crib off to one side and various toys lining the other, there was a rocking chair and a dresser with a drawer halfway opened. For a moment Harry imagined himself in his own nursery with both his parents playing on the floor with him, rolling around, and for that moment, it took his breath away.
Walking back towards the corridor he canceled the disillusionment spell and found the nearest bench to sit on.
“See, what makes the Wideye Potion addictive is the use of six Billywig stings, which, in single amount such as what is required in the Invigoration Draght, is harmless,” Harry made a noise of acknowledgement.
It didn’t take him long before he felt the build up and with a cry of his mates name Draco was swallowing him.
“I uh, wanted to talk to you about me and Draco,” her face stayed passive as she waited for him to continue.
Gently closing the book Harry placed it back on the shelf and ensure that nothing was out of place. He doubted anyone would check down this way, but his luck liked to toy with him.
he hissed and gave a satisfied smirk at the click that came from the door, pushing it open he peered inside.
Squeezing her back he smiled.
The remainder of the night was spent with the two intertwined with one another and Harry sporting a few new marks on his neck.
At Harry’s stunned expression, Murphy chuckled.
“During the third week, did you let the potion simmer for four hours in a cold room?” Draco nodded.
His dreams had returned, and Merope had bombarded him with questions about his absence; when he had admitted to being injured after an attack a crazed look in her eye sparked.
Harry’s hands settled in his lap and he stared at his fingers. Had he imagined it? Was there an enchantment on the ring that had given him that image, so he’d question it?
The end of year exams began with a flurry of stress and Harry felt as if he was being pulled into a million different pieces trying to keep from snapping at Draco or one of his friends. Everyone was increasingly on edge as nothing bad had happened as many had come to expect, for a moment even Harry felt himself easing up from a perpetual state of anxiousness.
“It was one time and the manor didn’t like who was invited in,” squirming in Draco’s hold the blonde clutched him tighter and glanced up through the fringe of his bang.
“It’ll be rough for a while, but we’ll figure it out,” he said softly, Draco hummed.
?!” he exclaimed, and no matter how much he told himself to close his mouth, he couldn’t.
Fennekitten.
Harry watched as Draco headed to a different part of the train station to meet up with his parents. He caught a glimpse of blonde hair and hastily turned away; he didn’t want the Malfoy’s to see him and start to piece together why he was here with Blaise.
“I know, I haven’t been a good mate at all, I just,” Dean looked hopeless as he stared at Harry with sad eyes.
Firm hands rubbed circles on his back as his nose was pressed into the base of Draco’s neck. He tried to breath and to concentrate on his mate rather than the screams he could still hear.
“Leaving so soon?” Harry tried his best to keep his voice normal though something must have set Neville on alert because he stopped putting his things in his bag.
As they passed the various housemates in the common room Harry trudge towards his room giving Draco a small pout as the other teen headed towards his room, they hadn’t been able to spend a night together since break and he had missed the warmth that the blonde provided.
Cries behind him had Harry smirking; opening the door to an abandoned classroom Harry pried Esmelda’s hands from around his neck and ushered her to the corner, she was whimpering, and tears were rolling down her face as he tried to comfort her.
He absentmindedly pushed around his food to only look up when someone sat across from him. Giving a forced smile he looked at the bright eyes of Esmelda, and the first years sitting aside her.
“It’s one of the Horcruxes, it’s a piece of your soul that Dumbledore separated, I’m not sure how to reconnect it with you,” he said uncomfortably, wishing he had a better idea of what he needed to do.
he said once more, reaching out he traced the familiar scales that didn’t move with his touch.
“Hermione will come around too Harry,” Luna whispered up at him as they reached the entrance to Hogsmeade and Harry could only stare in awe at her retreating form as her and Neville went through the gate.
“My apologies, after today my Veela has been feeling the urge to be overly protective of my mate, I’m having trouble reigning it in,” Harry’s hand found Draco’s and he gave it a squeeze.
It was mere minutes as Harry found himself pushing through trees and bushes and copious amounts of weeds before he finally made it into a clearing with a small stone building in the middle. Quirking his eyebrow up in surprise he was skeptical that he had the right place, wasn’t the family supposed to be buried here? Wouldn’t it have been bigger?
It wasn’t adding up that Tom was that magically powerful that he could split his soul into multiple pieces. If he was able to do all that, how did he, as a baby, cause for his demise?
“Drac-?” he tried to move back but the blonde screeched and Harry stilled, something in his body had told him not to move, that Draco needed him to stay where he was.
“You weren’t supposed to stay at Hogwarts,” an icy chill coursed through his veins at her comment and from the duel reactions next to him Hermione and Luna had come to a similar conclusion.
“I named him Tom, Tom Riddle Junior,” and in the moment that Harry processed the name, processed what that had meant, he blacked out.
Her face scrunched as she seemed to fumble with what to say next.
Sitting on the bed Harry laid backwards and for the first time all summer he felt completely at ease. Which, with a madman after him, seemed so surreal. Though as Harry thought about it, Voldemort had been unusually quiet since the end of term. Harry would occasionally feel emotions that weren’t his own, but he hadn’t had any nightmares or visions.
Fuming as he slipped in behind a group of Hufflepuffs he found himself wandering the halls until he found both Draco and Blaise on their rounds. Neither teen pried him for information knowing that he had a meeting with Dumbledore and whatever was said had clearly set him off.
“I, uh, okay Professor, so, detention?” Harry hoped that his Potions Professor would stop glaring at his Veela mate.
“How long have you been able to do wandless magic?” the grin dropped from his face and Harry gawked at Murphy who looked like he had just asked a very simple question.
the hiss from his side gave him small comfort as he turned to get a better look at the snake.
the snake said saucily, and Harry grabbed his bag before running out the door.
It was another ten minutes before the two teens found themselves back in the common room with Blaise rolling his eyes from his spot on the couch. Draco was straightening out his shirt as Harry was attempting to control his hair that was messier than normal.
“Hello? Hello!”
“Well Mister Potter, I can’t make him talk unfortunately, but is there something I can help you with?” she asked calmly, and Harry appreciated that like so many of the Hufflepuff’s he knew, she made him feel at ease.
in bold.
“Draco,” he warned, the blond pushed his hair back only to have it fall in front of his face once more.
The three flushed.
He had never tried to execute something like sneaking into the Restricted Section alone, but he had to know if there were any books in there that talked about Horcruxes. Walking to the other end of the library he skimmed over the students that were studying; there were probably twenty or so students present and of course Madam Pince. Draco and Blaise were the only Prefects seated and there weren’t any Head Boy or Girl’s that Harry recognized.
Inside of the box was a deep emerald cloak with silver clasps, there was a slight shimmer to the cloak and as Harry ran his fingers against the fabric, he felt his heart jump into his throat, it was a stunning garment.
“Will he be okay Madam Pomfrey?” he choked back a sob as the woman looked over the sleeping patient.
“Merlin, Harry, what happened, you seemed fine last night,” the blonde huffed, and Harry groaned as Draco’s colder body clashed with his overheated skin.
“Why did you give Harry a choice on accepting the mateship?”
“Why are you being nice to me? Why haven’t you, or any other Slytherin, lashed out about this resorting?” dark eyes stared at him.
As usual the group binged on a bit of everything and the next handful of hours were spent playing games and listening to everyone’s vacation stories. Harry still wasn’t too inclined to open about where he was and instead explained that he had been doing research about dreams.
Standing beneath Slytherin’s portrait he looked up at it curiously.
“The unsuccessful tries resulted in the death of the potential heir and in a few cases the caster died as well, some tries even left one or the other severely injured,” her face pinched and Harry wondered exactly how much she had read into each of the cases.
“Saw that Harry,” he hid a grin in his pillow as Draco wrapped his arms tighter around him.
“I wouldn’t let your guard down mate,” Ron said, Neville nodded in agreement. Ginny had gone back to her book while Luna kept staring out the window with a smile.
There was a moment of silence among the group members as each were lost in their respective thoughts.
But as Harry turned towards the person casting the spell, Harry felt as if the wind was knocked out of him, no, it couldn’t be.
“It won’t hurt anyone to be nice to them,” he mused, and Draco shrugged, eyes still closed.
“What happened Harry? Dumbledore stopped by asking if we had heard from you and where you went! You know how dangerous it is right now, what were you thinking?” Harry had known she would lay into him and only by a thread was he able to control his frustration, they knew bits and pieces of his experience at the Dursleys, they knew it was hell.
“I’m out of town and wasn’t really wanting to bump into anyone while I was here,” Harry said as casually as he could muster. Walking towards his stack of books Harry reasoned he could read for another hour or so.
Said woman shot him a warm smile as if thinking the same thing.
“Well Potter, we had better make the best of our time,” he had just pinned Harry’s wrists above the tasseled hair when a loud knock had them both glancing towards the door.
“I know of the perfect place mate, find a seat and hang on!” Hobbling to the first available seat Harry took note that the bus was empty except for himself.
“Uh, thank you, both of you,” Zabini smiled cheekily at him while Malfoy still looked concerned, his hand reached to touch Harry’s cheek, but he retracted it, seeming as if conflicted.
She returned minutes later with a jar of green paste, she instructed him to coat the burn with it, wrap it, and then wash it off the following morning. It would take a day or two before it healed completely, as Harry thanked her and walked towards the entrance of the green house, she called out to him.
“How was Quidditch practice?” scowling at himself as his voice squeaked Harry averted his eyes from the amused silver.
Hermione was ecstatic that Harry wanted to learn about meditation, and she promised that she would do research and help him in any way she could. He explained after the loss of Sirius he wanted to get better at controlling his emotions and possibly control the visions from Voldemort, he wasn’t ready to admit the truth until he had a better idea of what he was capable of.
“Hey ‘mione, how was your first night in Ravenclaw?” her worried look hadn’t diminished no matter how hard Harry tried to reassure her.
This had confirmed he was the heir to the Potter and Black line.
“I’ve always stayed at the castle for the holidays,” Harry said as nonchalantly as he could, it would be his first year where he was completely alone.
that annoyed Harry; Parkinson and Nott had taken a snake from its home in a feeble attempt at hurting him.
“Harry, this is Severus, he’s my godfather,” Harry couldn’t control himself when his mouth dropped open.
At hand reached to his chin pushing it upwards and Harry willingly looked up into Draco’s eyes; those eyes that were looking at him with comfort and reassurance.
The night seemed to drag on, Hermione was at one of the clubs that she signed up for while Neville was assisting Professor Sprout with a new batch of Sneezewort and Luna was fixing up her Butterbeer cork necklace after it had broken. She was upset and no matter how much Harry had offered to help fix the necklace she was adamant that she could do it on her own.
“We’re weak, we can barely hit the Bludger back let alone do some damage,” Harry hummed to himself.
“Do you know what this is Harry?” motioning to dish Dumbledore waved Harry over, Harry shook his head.
“Harry, my boy, I was unaware that the hat would choose this year as a resorting,” just barely able to control his eye roll Harry hummed.
Harry suddenly felt very angry.
Walking next to her Harry appreciated the manor in the different light. It was still early morning and the suns rays caught the morning dew that was still clinging to the plants. The grey tones that spread out along the hallways and rooms looked less dreary and Harry could easily see how elegant the manor truly was.
Harry took off his glasses and placed them on the nightstand, he knew what was next, but it wasn’t something he had even talked over with Draco.
Glancing towards the teacher’s table Harry homed in on the vacant seat where the Headmaster would normally have sat. Dumbledore had been absent the past few days and no one had taken much notice.
“Glad you both are awake! Present time!” and with that, Blaise bounded off towards the common room and Harry looked towards Draco with confusion, rarely was Blaise this exuberant.
Hello everyone! I know it has been a while, this story hasn’t been abandoned I promise. I’ve struggled with my mental health this year and have found many things difficult to do. This chapter was equally as frustrating because I felt like I was rushing the plot just to fill a word count.
There was a pause as Snape waited for a response.
“So how is Draco, Harry?” caught off guard by Luna’s light tone and the question she asked Harry tripped over his feet, Neville reached an arm out to steady him, face full of confusion.
Oh, they didn’t.
Checking for any wards or basic curses Harry was pleased to see that there was nothing on it, Hermione too, had mentioned that some of the most secured texts were warded tight.
The next morning Harry found himself lazing about his room for most of the day. He ignored the knocks on his door and buried himself in the various homework assignments he still had to complete. He had woken up just as annoyed at the thought of Draco and Astoria as he had the night before though as dinner approached, he found his annoyance and jealously morphing into embarrassment.
Phew, this chapter was a lot, I didn’t want to skimp over anything so it’s much longer than normal. Questions? Thoughts? Tom and Harry finally met and of course it didn’t go smoothly and unfortunately will get worse.
It was a few hours later before Draco and Harry sought Blaise out. After fooling around on the bed Harry had decided to take a shower and Draco couldn’t resist his naked mate, which lead to more touching and teasing afterwards.
“I,” Harry faltered; he trusted Draco, this Draco that he had known since the start of term, but bad things happened to people he trusted.
“Draco, she just wanted to see how a Patronus was cast,” biting back a laugh as pointed nose nuzzled in his hair he felt as the muscles he was pressed up against began to relax.
“Draco, Draco,” he whispered urgently, the blonde was only a few steps away from him and spun around quickly, worried that Harry’s tone meant they weren’t alone.
“Draco!” the blonde didn’t move nor his wand wavier from where he had it pointed at Pansy Parkinson who was looking tearfully up at the blonde.
“What do you want Potter,” for the life of him, Harry couldn’t remember the kids name.
“It is very true father, I’ve experienced one of the dreams with Harry,” the elder Malfoy slouched back into his chair.
“Hi Sophia,” she mustn’t have expected anyone because his voice startled her and the papers she had been carrying went up in the air.
In that moment Harry knew that he was in control, that Draco would never push him into something he didn’t want, he had respected Harry’s boundaries since they had the discussion in the library.
Harry’s magic had reacted to his happiness and he was excelling at spells in his classes. By the middle of the week he had earned Slytherin fifty house points. He had even managed to improve his wandless magic thanks to the time he dedicated to meditation and he could summon items to where he was while concentrating on the object rather than being in a state of emotion.
If Draco felt worried that he had overstepped a boundary his body showed nothing of it.
“I believe Missus Granger will be of great assistance, it is unfortunate that you and Mister Weasley aren’t on friendly terms right now, but I know you’ll do what you can to be friends once more,” it took a moment for Harry to process that he was back in the Headmaster’s office and his eyes traced the ring that was still on the desk.
Dumbledore held the spell as he walked to the edge of the room and picked up an item. It looked like some cup, but it wasn’t something Harry had seen before. Harry’s eyes found Tom’s and the man looked like he was struggling to stay conscious.
“Ungraceful much Potter?” the blonde teased and Harry didn’t dignify his mate with a response.
Yet as Harry stepped up to the entrance Lady Zabini stopped him and motioned for him to place his hand in the middle of the door.
“If someone inflicted those burns on you, I hope you report them Mister Potter, but let me know if I can be of any more assistance,” nodding, Harry left.
Closing his eyes Harry concentrated on his breathing as he could feel the swell of his magic surround him; he hated the stereotypes that came with Hogwarts houses, he hated that the magical world was divided based off status, so much could be learned from one another if wizards and witches just opened their eyes.
Harry racked his brain with the new information, “Where could the portrait’s be?” he wondered, not expecting an answer.
“You will kill for me Tom, you will kill thousands, you will kill powerful wizards and witches, and then when the time comes, you will be killed, and by then,” Dumbledore’s thumb rubbed the stone and it glowed white and then red, “I will be able to use the stone for its intended purpose, the ultimate purpose.”
“I died that night, from that drink that I was given.”
“Oh, hush you, exams are,” she paused, “competitive in Ravenclaw,” Harry couldn’t even begin to understand why she seemed excited about that declaration.
Grasping the sides of the basin Harry pushed all his magic into it, to reaching the locket, and it was as if a tight band had been broken and the locket shot out. It went sailing past him and rolled down towards the edge of the island. Without thinking Harry rushed after it, using his magic in such a way had unexpectedly drained him and he fell to his knees panting and gasping for breath. He barely noticed as white bone curled around uninjured calf and dragged him under the water once more.
The blond couldn’t look at him anymore. “It’s true.”
“What? No!”
Harry looked back, angrily and about to tell Malfoy off when he saw the boy walk toward him, still naked, wand raised.
to dust around the house. “I want this house spotless. If I see even a speck of dust anywhere in my home, you will be begging for my forgiveness. Do you understand, Potty?”
“There. That wasn’t so hard. Now,” the boy said, coming to stand behind him. “Lift up your pillowcase, I’m going to give that disobedient ass of yours some nice red marks.
Draco could hear the boy’s wet feet patting on the floor and waited. He peeked over his shoulder. Harry was opening the cabinet and looking inside. Draco could see everything. The boy was skinny, like Draco knew he was, but he could see some muscle too. Quidditch was really helping Harry’s body develop. Draco’s eyes traveled down. He saw the boy’s pink nipples. They were cute. Then they traveled down further. He saw a tuft of dark curly hair before…Draco smiled. The boy was small down there. But Draco liked it just the same. His cute little dick was on full display and the blond wanted to suck it. He imagined pinning the boy down and having his way with him. But of course that was when Harry noticed his eyes on him.
“Doesn’t matter. Surprise me.”
“Oh come on Malfoy. It’s not that big a deal. Couldn’t you just-“
“Thanks Ma’am,” Malfoy said. He gave Harry a sneer as he and Goyle walked past. When the door closed behind them, Madam Pomfrey strode into the back room to get the results of the blood test. Harry waited a few minutes, but she didn’t come back out. He waited another few minutes before calling out to her.
Minerva sighed and said, “accio Harry Potter’s glasses,” pointing her wand at the lake. They immediately flew into her hand. She handed them back to him and told them to be on their way.
“I…I’m not.” Harry said weakly.
“Umm, Malfoy?”
“What’s this, Potty? I’ve already finished my meal and you still haven’t started dusting? I always knew you were lazy, Potty, but to not follow an order…I’m going to have to punish you,” Harry saw that the blond was enjoying this. His smile was wide and made Harry fearful.
There was another room at the end of the bathroom that was solely for taking showers. Tatty told him that every Monday and Thursday at 1:00 am sharp, all the elves took a ten minute shower. They were not permitted to take a shower at any other time, and if they missed it due to being too slow or in the middle of following an order, then they’d just have to wait till the next designated time and date.
The officials pulled Harry into the next room and the boy froze. Sitting on an elegant red sofa sat the Malfoys. Harry shook his head. His family couldn’t be the Malfoys. Harry looked into the eyes of Lucious first. The man looked almost bored. Narcissa looked disgusted as she stared at him with her beady little eyes. And Draco…Draco was sneering evilly at him.
Draco heard the boy gulp from inside his stall.
“What are you waiting for, Potty? Father gave you an order. Get to it.”
“What’s wrong Potter, don’t tell me you’re a virgin.” Draco hoped he was. He was a virgin himself.
“Usually we being apparating meals on dinner table for masters, but since Master Draco only wanted a separate meal apart from breakfast, lunch, or dinner, meal is brought to him.”
The room he was in was furnished and pretty nice. Harry just sat on the bed and waited for Dumbledore or the ministry officials to come back. He thought about what the Headmaster had told him. He didn’t believe it. There was no way he was a house-elf. The very thought was crazy. They couldn’t just make him serve a family like some kind of slave. He had to go to Hogwarts. He had to defeat Voldemort. He wasn’t a fucking house-elf!
“…Then umm…how are we going to get back to our dorms?”
house-elf.”
“Right now the Ministry is performing a ritual so you’ll act more like a house-elf. Please wait patiently while the dark curse is cast on you.”
Once in the locker room however, the boy made his way to a shower stall. “What are you doing?” Draco sounded defeated. Was he not going to get to see the boy change after all?
Draco suddenly felt a weight in his stomach. He’d thought that Harry was probably not gay…but to have it confirmed like that…it hurt. The blond was suddenly angry. If he wasn’t going to ever have him, he was damn-well going to at least see him naked. “Merlin, Potter! Nobody gives a shit what you look like. It’s not a big deal!”
“Elves? What do you mean, I thought this was about my blood test?”
“…okay. Weird, but okay. Now what? Can I uh…go back to my dorm?”
“Um…what does it say? Am I okay?”
“I left it back at the dorm. Do you have yours?”
“No. I’m not your maid Potter. Get one yourself,” He said sitting on a bench, waiting for the boy to come out.
Draco gave an exasperated sigh. “Fine, jeez.”
Harry was stunned. Did he just say- no. No that’s not possible. He couldn’t feel the same way…could he? Maybe this was still part of the joke. “Yeah right Malfoy, very funny. Now get off me.”
“But I don’t feel anything like that.”
The elf looked at Harry. “You is being a house-elf, Potty? But you is looking—”
“Your ears are a bit pointy at the very tops, just slightly. Your nose is a bit on the thin side. Your eyes are slightly larger than the average human’s.
“But-“
The Malfoy’s apparated to their mansion with Harry. Draco went with them. It was a weekend and the boy got permission to spend the two days with his family.
Harry ran up the stairs at the elf’s request. When he got up to the first floor, he saw Draco standing there, hands on his hips and tapping his foot impatiently. Harry was out of breath.
“W-why?” Harry couldn’t believe that Malfoy could be this cruel. He was a bully, but this? Nobody was around to see, why was he humiliating him like this? Harry couldn’t stop the tears. “Why are you doing this? T-that was m-my first kiss.”
“You will refer to me as Master Lucius, my wife as Mistress Narcissa, and my son as Master Draco from now on, understand?”
“I believe we’ve already witnessed it in its father. James Potter lived life as a human.”
“Oh, I don’t know. Taking a shower? We smell like the lake.” Then the boy disappeared inside the stall.
“No. Tatty job is being mostly cleaning, not cooking. Some house-elves even have job of being personal elves for masters. Dottie is being Mistress Narcissa’s elf, for instance. Personal elves be doing everything they can for Master.”
The first person to speak was Lucious. He gave a direct order to see what Harry would do. “Come here, Potter.”
“Any special instructions, Master Draco? What type of ham is Master Draco be wanting? Cheese?”
“Is there a problem Mr. Malfoy?”
About ten minutes later, Draco heard Potter’s shower turn off. He turned off his own then realized something. It seemed that Harry realized the same thing, because he heard the boy call out.
She looked back at him again, but this time she didn’t look away. This time her gaze was focused. She looked him up and down. She looked at his eyes, his ears, his nose, his mouth…all with such focus. She slowly reached toward him and took the glasses off his face. She looked at his eyes again. Then she put his glasses back on him and stood up. She walked past him without saying a word.
Harry saw the group of Ministry officials, five in all, surround his cot. They raised their wands and pointed them at him. Then they began to chant. Harry could feel dark magic form over his skin like a blanket, then slowly sink into him, into his blood, into his bones, into his mind. Harry lost consciousness when he felt a dark curse cause havoc inside his skull.
“Madam Pomfrey?”
“I’m sorry,” the blond said. “I shouldn’t have done that.”
Then Harry took another bite of his apple. The blond watched the boy’s plump lips as he chewed. Draco imagined those lips on his, would they be soft or firm? Would he bite Draco’s lip like he did his own? Draco noticed all the boy’s little habits. Like how his hands would fray the sleeve of his jumper when he was nervous. Or how, when he was happy, he would talk with his hands. Draco saw everything when it came to Harry Potter.
The blond stepped away, sneering and keeping the glasses raised in his hand, but out of the other boy’s reach. “You actually want this ugly piece of metal back?” Malfoy sculpted his features to appear shocked. “I was going to do you a favor and chuck them in the lake.”
Harry was used to such orders and threats from so many summers with the Dursley’s. “Yes, sir.”
Then all four of them heard a ringing sound coming from the back room. “That’ll be the results of your blood test,” she said as she handed Goyle a potion. “Drink this Mr. Goyle. It’ll heal you up in about an hour. Now no punching walls, understand?”
Harry’s eyes widened, but before he could say anything, Narcissa spoke up. “I’d worry for your health, Draco. Do you really want to eat something that some filthy half-elf on its first day cooked up?”
Harry heard the door to the stall next to his open. He heard Malfoy walk barefoot across the tiles, past his stall. He heard him open a cabinet. The towel cabinet. “Are you getting a towel?”
“Quiet down you two,” she said, finally looking at the pair. “Mr. Potter is only here for a simple check-up.”
“That’s childish, Draco,” said Narcissa.
Draco had heard the other boy approaching. He looked up just in time to see the boy’s lips press against his own. Harry Potter was kissing him.
Harry broke the kiss and looked down at the blond. “I…I love you too,” he said. Harry watched as the boy’s eyes widened and fresh tears ran down his face. “I think I’ve liked you for a long time,” Harry smiled.
Draco really, really did. The very thought of forcing the great Harry Potter to make him a sandwich made his cock twitch. “I suppose not.”
Harry Potter was no longer the powerful prince from his books. Harry was a house-elf. His house-elf. Well, his father’s. He’d have to convince the man to give him the boy. For even though Draco was told that Harry had elf blood, though Harry Potter was legally a house-elf, Draco still desired him sexually. He couldn’t wait to give the boy all manner of orders. He’d have Harry as his own personal house-elf if it killed him.

The Headmaster looked away. “No. You need to stay here until the Ministry officials arrive.”
Harry laughed.
He saw her suddenly stop when she got to the door. She didn’t turn around to look at him. She placed the bit of parchment in her pocket and finally spoke. “Don’t move. Just stay where you are. I’m going to get the Headmaster.” Then she left, closing the door behind her.
“What can Elner do for Mister?” The house elf bowed. He had an interesting accent.
Draco brought his other hand, covering the top of his own, still holding Theo, and asked, “Did you hide the Horcruxes?”
The moment his feet touched the floor he stopped.
“Before we learn it though,” Draco started. “We need to get Theodore Nott out from the Ministry’s holding cell.”
Harry felt his hellfire hug him, making him shine with shadow flames. He cracked one of his fingers.
The little boy didn’t reach the piano stool – he had to hop on it and then remeasure it, so that he could easily sit on it. He wore a long T–shirt, it reached down to his ankles. His pants were filled with holes and was barefoot.
Harry sat down to wait for the women he had been called for and gave out a loud sigh.
“I’d never hurt you. You’re my only friend.” Theo said and hummed with approval. Draco knew that lemon cake was Theo’s favorite.
“All ready,” he said looking up, “why?”
His hands were shaking as he looked down at Malfoy, whose eyes were in shock, as well.
The house is quiet yet again and it’s strange to think about how Father has been the one to talk all the time, filling it up with noise.
Harry clenched his jaw and nodded. He waved his hand to vanish Ron from this place.
Finally!” Muriel shouted from the window as she noticed Blaise and Ginny walking back to the elegant carriage. “What took you so long?”
And then Malfoy came in with a smile and Narcissa looked at him with empty eyes. Harry felt the pain in his chest immediately.
It got into his skull and filled it with a living sensitivity.
He silently closed the door behind him and started to walk towards the man, sitting on the chair. Steady steps, slow ones. He breathed the cold air in his lungs. The man in front of him wore a deep blue cape, which wrapped his whole being, like a hurricane.
When Harry found them in the room, he gently said, “Thank you, Lady Alcyone.”
An older, Russian boy with a shaved head and brown eyes. Black Uniform. Deyan Ignatov.
Chinasa bowed her head, showing respect and peace. “And you are a trickster,” she said. “A Nogitsune.”
“It’s a pity you’ve got lucky,” he said and then stared at Harry. Draco moved so that he could cover him, hide him.
. Harry had to tilt his head in order to maintain eye contact.
Harry let out a deep breath. Even that was hard, he buried his face into his hands. He then buried his hands in his hair. It was useless. It was messy.
“Are you sure about this Harry? This is going to push you to your limit.” She said, not looking at him. “Dudley thinks you’re going to snap.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Just like Voldemort.
Harry looked at her with narrowed eyes, not quite understanding what she told him.
Into that hole.
Harry looked at Draco instead. His eyes, his lips, his eyelashes and he let out a deep breath.
Draco was smiling as well, trying to calm down his heartbeat and turned around to apparate to somewhere, where everything will be much harder to handle than it was before.
Harry wore a low, cold expression and pulled up a bit his wrist.
– Harry:
“Lisbeth”
Blaise Zabini looked nothing like he did a year ago. His skin was dark but paler, there were visible circles around his eyes, as if he hadn’t slept properly for days, months,
George paled as if he has seen a ghost.
And the summary of act II!!
Because she was and would always be important to him, because she was smart, confident, talented, and lively, and everything someone could hope for a wife.
Ginny and Blaise whirled around the same time as Aberforth said, “What the–
“You have cute friends, honey.” She told him and Dudley let out a heavy sigh. Harry smiled.
“I knew Voldemort would come back because of the Horcruxes and you wouldn’t die, but me? I had no idea what would happen to me. Harry was the nearest powerful being in the room, so I reincarnated in him. War and Death’s power vanished, as if I had never even killed them in the first place. You see now?” Pestilence looked into Draco’s eyes. “I knew I would die in this life the moment Harry destroyed me, because he will do the same thing again – the moment he gets out of the cage –, and then I’ll be dead permanently.”
Theo raised up his fingers, blasting up little flames, playing with them like coins.
Harry furrowed his brows. “What–?”
Harry thought of this while he was in the garden. Sitting on the green grass, admiring the little golden patches that were all over the place, signing that the sun was high up in the sky. He pulled out a couple of hauls, enjoying the warm and the light breeze that caressed his dark hair. He loved to be here. In here, there was no shouting, demands or hateful eyes that burned him. He was all by himself and he loved it. He was used to it if he wanted to be honest. The Dursley’s didn’t talk to him. They endured him, made him do all the chores, sometimes looked at him but that was it.
have to take down the king to win.”
and watched
Charlton was staring at Ginny, while he was drinking his fifth cup of coffee.
It was–
Malfoy didn’t expect this, he almost took a step back. But instead of doing that, he got closer to Harry, his expression changed into intrigue, curiosity and
“If you eat them,
“What do you think why I visited you at the cemetery?” Harry asked. “Besides the fact that I wanted to do something, trying not to think about the fight between me and my friends?”
“You’re clever Mister Potter.” The woman started. She was the leader, Harry noticed her insignia. “That’s your only luck.”
Someone cracked his throat and Harry gazed at Ron, who was smiling like a maniac.
“Draco Malfoy?” George Weasley blinked at him with his tired face and bed hair and Draco could only grin like a happy, fool, maniac.
“Really?” Harry raised his hand and moved his fingers, as if he only now had seen his body for the first time. “How?”
Gavril had no idea why he walked here, why he thought this might make him feel better. Eliza Vilar only understood him once, and only once. Why would she understand him now? Why was this so important to him anyway? Why did this have to matter?
He also felt that he just destroyed something in him, which would never be the same again.
“HELLO GUYS!” Cedric waved at them with a big smile.
Fenrir looked at him with fearful eyes. “If I had known that My Lord–”
“Neither of you look really happy.”
They loved each other.
–,” her voice cracked. Harry noticed a slow movement in the corner of his eyes. Malfoy started to walk towards Narcissa’s bed, where she sat.
Harry shook his head so fast it hurt. “No.” He answered. Ron offered to him his arm. “Nobody could met him the way I did.”
Harry’s heart clenched.
Draco looked at him with intelligent eyes but he had so much tension inside, he only said this through his teeth, “I can’t kill Voldemort–”
Almost as quiet as his own home.
Harry raised his head a bit and pressed a quiet kiss on her forehead. Following Harry, she closed her bright eyes as well.
He was young but he understood.
The man in front of him was half dead. Someone who was gripping his last chance of life as hard as he could.
“We’ll see how clever she really is,” Harry looked back at the brothel and said in a cold voice, “A drowning man will clutch at a straw, Voskey.”
“The Cup is a portkey,” Draco breathed and Theo opened his eyes in surprise. He shouldn’t have been, though.
Weeks passed after that.
Searching for Father.
Blaise and Pansy smiled simultaneously and it was brilliant and terrifying at the same time, but it thrilled up Draco nonetheless.
Whenever Draco sees Mother, he feels like his childhood comes back home to him. It’s a feeling that doesn’t pass by him, it’s a feeling that never will. Her and Father are everything he remembers from the years of growing up and she’s the only reason Draco knows what it means to have someone beside you.
“Who are you?” Harry asked instead, his voice felt just as small as he was, so he just curled up more, leaning against one of the piano’s legs. “How can you be here in my mind?”
- Pansy:
Harry smiled with warmth and his eyes glowed with pure intents.
Harry felt
Harry shook his head gently. “You can’t mean this.” His voice was shaking. “I am not any of those–”
But this is, yet again, another door that never opens.
“I’m not a fool, Malfoy.” Harry started. “Bringing back Hermione and Ron... I know it was your idea. So why did you do it?”
He got braver then, like a quiet, raging rain.
That familiar feeling.
he thought and smiled with full teeth, sharp as a razor.
Here's the new chapter guys!!! Special thanks to Crypto as always, because my bro–sweetheart is that awesome!! hope you all will like it!! Thank you for the kudos and the comments they are everything to me!! Lots of hugs and kisses and love!!
PS: I've recently bought a Ps4 game called 'Nier:Automata' and can I just say THAT IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND THE OST IS AMAZING!!!??? I still haven't played out fully so no spoilers!!! My fav is 2b so far btw!
Draco is sitting out on the terrace, looking down, watching his mother water the flowers. It takes him back to the days when he’s eleven, chasing the clouds in the clear sky. Feeling the grass beneath his bare feet, pulling the halm. Sensing the wind ruffling his white hair, seeing the colorful butterflies rest on the leaves of trees.
Draco glances down at his arm, the black mark like a grim looking back at him. A patch of ink, never dries, never vanishes, never becomes white.
He had no idea why.
“Yeah. Where is the savior now, I say?”
“If one of us finds the Cup, he has to wait for the other to find it, too?” Pestilence asked Draco again.
Harry’s body stiffened and made himself think a little.
Draco’s eyes widened with recognition and Harry felt his hands shake a bit.
“I was hungry.” She admitted.
“He’s smiling.” Harry whispered, noticing the grin on the monster.
“Of course.”
He wanted to say something.
Voldemort just leaned closer, his nose brushed Draco’s, as he said, “Well then you can do this for me, surely,” he leaned back and stepped away. “Lucius, give me a whip.”
Seeing how Theo stepped out of it without any damage on his skin or his dark cape,
“Feeling as if you have no more time left.”
without even
He stopped when he heard Harry’s voice. It was gentle, and it was for him and Draco’s heart melted a bit.
All he had to know, that he had been lied to.
Draco wince and narrowed his eyes at her. “Yes.” He said curtly. “That.”
that smile disappeared.
Liliana’s eyes were wide and behind her, Malfoy looked like he was going to pass out. Dudley’s fiancée had a letter in her hand. She clutched it strongly, then looked at Harry.
And yet.
Everyone is shouting but all Draco can think is that a memory that has a deep impression is the one that stays.
Pansy
She looked like one of Teddy’s doll. Soulless.
“I’m glad he’s okay.” He laughed too.
Draco smiles a little, and now it’s three in the morning again.
Harry’s hands were shaking and they only stopped when Draco touched with his, covering the feather’s side with his fingers.
He sensed fear behind his back.
Ron smile grew bigger. “It was still quite a sight.” He stated. “Your magic and his are–”
Some droplets are leaping out at intervals like goldfish soaring from their bowl. Draco’s eyes widen as he beams.
“Yes,” Theo nodded.
delicacy, even though Harry was far from delicate. “You can always say no, I would let you go and nothing would change between us.”
He felt gentle hands touch his face, his hair. It felt like home, and freedom, and peace.
“What was it? His dream?” Harry asked quietly. He had no power to make his voice louder. He also knew that he couldn’t do it anyway.
The boy had old eyes.
She smiled at him, with an interesting glint in her eyes and gave him the sweet thing. Harry couldn’t help it.
He doesn’t feel regret but he feels lost in more ways he can ever count.
“That’s more like it,” Theo whispered and smothered the fire, letting the darkness fill out the whole world. “Famine.”
Draco exploded.
It was small, dilapidated and thick with filth and Draco didn’t know what he was doing here. The place was the same that was in his mind, so that was something.
Now he needs to rip out his spine and his lungs too.
He felt Fred’s hand on his shoulder. “There’s only one thing you need to see and then we’re done. Open them.”
Harry touched his neck, thinking. “I want you to find Blaise Zabini for me.” He said finally.
Harry didn’t look at the cells either. These vile things don’t deserve to be looked at. He just walked straight – he knew Yaxley’s cell was the last one on the first hallway –, enjoying the screams and the songs.
Voldemort looked at his mark on his servant’s skin, as he extended his other arm. “It’s back,” he said softly, his voice low. “They will have noticed it.... and now we shall know... we shall see.”
Blaise murmured. “Seventh.”
“Long time no see Malfoy.” Harry started with a cold voice.
As if he demands to be stopped, as if he dares them to put him down. Then he glances down at Mother and it doesn’t seem real, and she’s looking at him as well.
“Ron.” Harry’s voice was low and quiet.
“I heard when they were talking to you,” the little girl just shrugged. “I know how it feels to be hungry.”
Harry stared up in surprise. Mr. Karkaroff smile was wide and honest and Harry’s every instinct screamed
Ginny the whole situation to Aberforth, Blaise added to the story here and there. By the end of, Ginny began again, “I figured he wasn’t dead,” she said to Blaise. “Because otherwise you would have seen a ghost or something indescribable. So if he wasn’t dead, he was alive. But then if he wasn’t really alive, he must have been standing somewhere in between.”
And then he saw,
Harry looked at her and sensed her magic, he felt the little waves which was in whole. He smiled gently.
Parkinson looked at him without emotions. Her eyes were empty and lonely, like a bottomless pit.
“How pathetic,” he whispered to him with a warm voice. “You’re scared, but then again, who could blame you?”
Harry’s feelings had been gone since a year.
While Pestilance is the First and the Last.
The fox twitched one of his ears and sat down in front of Harry.
The chorus began again, “
“We wanted to make a better place without you in it.” Kingsley gladly whispered. “You are an infection to the world, and all you do is spread infecting everyone else. We can’t make peace and harmony if you’re alive. We need you dead, but I can’t kill you.” He stopped for a minute and looked at Harry dead in the eye. “But The King can.”
Pestilence blushed.
His heart began to sting when Dumbledore suddenly stopped. Draco looked ahead, preparing himself for every possible...
Draco’s eyes widened
“And why would that have been so much of a problem?” His voice quivered, his throat burned. “If I agreed, that is–”
“I’d never thought you would admit this.” He answered and looked at deep in his eyes. In Malfoy’s eyes, there was grey and a little blue and white and Harry’s magic
The red head was laughing, hugging Harry back with a nostalgic smile. “I knew you can still tell us apart,” Fred said, voice full of joy.
Harry couldn’t say anything he just stared at Malfoy, whose eyes were full of panic.
And Zabini gave up.
The man’s eyes narrowed down as he covered Harry’s hand with this. “Someone like you would never step in here.”
And finally,
“Ah, you visited again.” Harry heard a voice in his head and looked to his left.
“Long time no see Potter.” Malfoy mirrored him. “Actually, I knew that this was going to happen eventually. Where’s your glasses by the way?”
The reason is something else.
Draco pulled his face gently and ran a thumb along his cheek. Harry leaned into it, because this time he didn’t need to be the one who have to be wary, because the person close to him wasn’t weaker.
Theo felt his chest explode, and breathing became hard or impossible to do, and Draco always looked and acted like a machine, someone who didn’t feel anything towards anyone, who didn’t care about anything or anyone–
Draco looked gobsmacked. “Blaise?” he asked, as if he heard it wrong. “Zabini? Blaise?”
He stopped and turned around to stare at Relna again, who looked up at him with her big eyes.
Just as he thought about this, holding the flower, Blaise walked out of the flower shop and bumped into a shorter, delicate body–
Draco – without a second thought – pulled out one strand of white hair and gave it to the man. The prisoner looked at the white thing with confusion.
Draco couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe it. Everything was right at his nose.
moment.
He can use wandless magic.
Draco was hugging him.
He wasn’t expecting this.
His steps were slow because he was starving and had no strength or power to do anything. He didn’t sleep because there was so much light coming out everywhere.
Harry, after a while, killed them all.
“What?”
Almost like a music box, with a ballerina.
“No. Not just only a wizard,” The Fifth Seal shook his head and gave Harry a wide grin, filled with slyness and joy. “You can steal, Harry. Anything, you can steal anything at all.”
No one really could.
“Well, she’s not entirely wrong.” He said with a low voice, then changed the topic. “Why did Parkinson stay after you caught her though? How did you catch her?” He looked at Ron.
Draco stops midway drinking his own green tea, eagerly anticipating an answer or anything at all from Robards, but the older man just simply says, “Thank you, but I have to decline,” and then continues to stand there with his hands folded behind his back.
When Draco felt the ground beneath his limbs he dared to open his eyes. It took a couple of minutes to get used to the bright light – and Fred Weasley for the matter, who was next to him –, but when he did, he focused the scene that was in front of him.
Harry felt the flames rise up. “How long were you with The King?”
- Greg:
“Do you think that it’s normal if you burn alive your father?” Theo said and Draco shut down his eyes, trying hard to not look at the other boy. “It’s not, but sometimes people have no choice. I’m hella cool and you’re hella cool, so what’s the problem here?”
Then his magic felt a living nightmare in hell.
She looked down at her hands, at her slightly brown skin. The color of the dress she wore was as dark as the mightiest, oldest gold, and it reached her ankles. She tried to fully embrace herself as much as she could.
And the bell started to ring down at the church. “So that was why,” Weasley’s eyes widened and then and idea popped into her mind. She touched Blaise hand and started to run back to the carriage, pulling Blaise with her.
He was making fun of him. This
“Lamir Takasuke.” He stated. “My partner said that your magic has the ability to create dreams.”
“Why did you put him in a cage?” Draco asked.
Harry’s eyes became grim and he forced his eyelids to shut down. He felt his fury in his veins. In his smoke and blood.
Narcissa’s eyes went round. “Blaise,” her voice always made him smile, so that he did. It made Narcissa smile, too. “That’s the first thing you say to me after you haven’t visited me for
Pure white hair. Pure white eyelashes. Pure grey eyes.
When Harry stood up and turned around to walk out of the room he stopped – just in front of the door.
Harry squinted his eyes at him.
Harry looked at Draco when he sensed his magic stressful waves. The pretty man didn’t look up at Harry at all and he–
“Everybody’s sad about Neville. You’re not the only one who’s grieving. You don’t need to do everything on your own.” Luna blurted out suddenly, with a broken voice.
“Your books intrigue me, Miss,” Harry started to speak. He sensed another human being had come into the room. He closed the book which he had been reading and turned around to look at the main lady of the Woodpecker’s Brothel.
– Terence:
Ron nodded faithfully. “I’ll go.” Harry raised his hand to apparate his friend who looked at him grimly. “Protect Hermione and win.”
“FRANKLY, MY DEAR, I DON’T GIVE A DAMN!”
A lot of books, lying around everywhere, piles of books – so high and long piles of them that it reached the ceiling. Crows were flying around the room, all of them black like night. The candles were high up on the almost broken chandelier, giving a golden glow to the room, making the objects’ shadows as big as a malicious wolf in a dark forest. A staircase was there to escort people a bit higher where there was an old, big chair with a big table with a lot of potions on the surface.
Harry felt that piercing strike again, more strongly this time.
Blaise freeze but Draco has started it and he won’t stop–
Harry felt shivers ran down his spine. He felt something creep into him, a feeling, making his breathing quicker as he felt his heart pump blood, as he imagined the headless corpses–
Why did Kingsley watch his reaction? When they talked about Malfoy’s torture? When they talked about The King? Why did he–?
Something weird.
“I did it hell of a lot better than you, apparently,” Voskey said, scratching his animalistic ears with his claws. “You don’t reek of blood so you didn’t kill that lying motherfucking son of a bitch.”
As he felt the familiar feeling of disgust creeping upon in him, he bowed his head and clenched his fists.
Ginny started to get irritated. “What?” she asked. “What are you hinting at? What do you want?”
Draco clicks his tongue, giving him a side eye. “So,” he continuous, looking back to Humbert. “He’ll fly back to his owner? When we let him go?”
He forgot how to love, how to be calm and relaxed. He forgot a lot of things, and maybe he’ll never get them back.
It was silence after it ended and Harry could feel Draco looking at him. He was afraid to look back.
Karin moved back a little in her hiding spot.
“I’ve heard that if you’re prayin’, God will listen to you.” He heard Theo’s innocent voice. “I always pray to him, but he never answers. Maybe it only works in Church.”
So Mildred accepted and shook on it.
The mask resembled a vulture.
Hermione leaned back with a surprising speed and frowned at him. She didn’t understood.
Harry hasn’t heard any of that. He hasn’t even looked at everyone’s faces, because all he heard was silence. All he felt was calmness. All he saw, was Voldemort’s dead body in front of him. His parents’ murderer. His friend’s families murderer. Snape’s murderer. Albus Dumbledore’s murderer. He saw him, lying on the ground, lifeless, people already coming to get him. His blood was boiling in his veins and he raised his chin. He clenched Voldemort’s wand, hands shaking a little.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gavril wanted to let her go, but couldn’t move. “Why is this so important to you? Do you know what you’re asking, you’re asking the impossible–”
He deserved his death. He deserved it.
“I’ve been talking to Nev,” Luna began quietly, as if she was scared that people could overhear. “And he’s been talking to Harry, and you see Harry’s been talking to Hermione and–”
Harry was still frozen.
Odile shut her eyes again, and one moment later she was smiling. Harry felt her magic, it was suffocating, rotten and bitter.
“Don’t worry, I’m not going to tell anybody.” She whispered then started to walk away.
Before the day Commander Siegfried came back, Voskey was similar to a shadow.
Harry half closed his eyes and gave out an amused smile.
Draco narrowed his eyes at the Gaunt Shack, at Little Hangleton.
“Then she says no,” he said simply.
“Mr. Potter.” addressed him Auror Ramir and bowed to him. “What can I help you with?”
- Blaise:
Harry heard the gentle piano the moment he stepped into the room. Beautiful women and men walked around in clothes that made them look like royalty. There were quite a lot people here, most of them were kissing with the courtesans, or were discovering each other bodies.
“My magic senses you.” Draco breathed. “I feel you. I know you too well by now.”
on Adrian.”
“He was heavily alike with Amundar.” He said with a thoughtful voice.
“There’s no outcome which is beneficial, however I look at it,” Father begins slowly, holding a cup of tea in his hand, looking down at it devoid of emotion. “For me anyway.”
He didn’t know who controlled his legs and didn’t know how he ended up at Azkaban Zero.
Its eyes were dark as the tar, it glowed as the snow fell on its black skin. The beast twitched his ears, and tilted his head without looking away from Karin.
“Able to fight with other strong opponents.” Continued Professor Snape. “Able to destroy him.”
And then he shot the spell.
weak.
“I know,” Blaise sighed, looking away. “I know.”
Odile bowed to him so deep, it almost reached Kreacher’s.
– Luna:
“Did he chained him too?” Harry asked her quietly and when Parkinson looked up with surprise, Harry knew he got it right. “He did.” He muttered.
– The Dark Lord's Heir: Jóhann Jóhansson – Escape
He didn’t wince.
– Instrumental Core – Uprising
“I owe your mother so much, I don’t know how I’m going to repay it, Malfoy.” He whispered and Draco almost recoiled because of the sudden change in his voice. “If she hadn’t told him that I died then...” He stopped for a minute, taking a deep breath. “I owe you too. When you pretended that you don’t know me. At the Manor.” He looked at him, dead in the eye and that was when Draco noticed something.
The game changed.
“Th–it–can’t be.” Malfoy’s voice quivered “You don’t recognize me?” His eyes pleaded for the answer and he got more and more panicked.
“Theodore maybe.” He said to him quietly. “Blaise and Theo always went together in missions, because they were Compatible.”
Leader. The Death Eaters’ leader. The beast’s apprentice.
“You never were because of Voldemort.” He heard Ron’s grim voice. “But he’s dead now and everyone is grateful because of it–”
He looked down at his hands. It was familiar but he didn’t know what it was.
“What the fuck Draco?” He looked at the clock on the wall. “It’s six in the morning, holy mother of–”
Why did they catch Yaxley two weeks ago? Who knew only two words, The King and The Prince? Why two weeks? And Odile? Who has the ability to find people? Why her? After a couple of days? Before Malfoy’s arrival?
Eliza brought her knees up to her chest and laid her head on them. Her short, curly hair got into her eyes, as she closed them – the eyelashes stroked her skin.
“What did Potter want?” Pansy asked with interest. Draco lifted up one of his eyebrows, it was surprising if Pansy sounded interested nowadays.
Harry’s eyes widened.
Robards mimics his expression. “Yes,” he emphasizes. “Yes, it is.”
And then Pettigrew began to talk.
Harry let him but he tried to look away. Try to hide from Draco’s eyes.
They nodded again and came closer to the table. Harry touched his neck and made his voice quiet.
Then they started to talk.
Read. the. warnings. This fic is mature for a reason. I said it – I say it one more time – it is bloodier and 10 thousand times worse than 'Make a Heaven out of Hell'. Also, from now on, there will be things that can trigger a lot of things, so read it with that on mind.
” and everything heals. Blaise sends her a gentle smile, his mom gives one back as she presses a kiss on Blaise’s knuckles.
Draco saw a graveyard. The black outline of a church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A hill rose above their left.
“Yeah, sure,” Humbert sounds excited. “You saved him. If he doesn’t fly away, he’s yours,” the owl immediately begins to purr, frizzling up his feathers. “Look,” Humbert laughs. “Seems like he’s already decided!”
Harry trained and learned and studied with them for four months – not seeing anyone at all of his age, not even Viktor –, until today.
“Today is Kuma Lisa,” Mildred told Ivor and she felt him tense – this making her go still as well.
“They act like they have never done one single bad thing in all their lives,” Astoria whispers and then lowers her head, pulling up her knees, hugging them and laying her head on them. “It’s not about the punishment, it’s about the behavior.”
“You told me Regulus figured it out why you reincarnated, what you were searching for,” Draco spoke after what it seemed like an hour. “What was your reason?”
“Okay, I will,” he said. He knew that meant the world for Blaise – those words. Harry didn’t even remember when was the last time something made him feel that strongly.
“To me,” Draco’s breath was ghosting over his face. “You are.”
But he didn't know how. He didn't know what. How could he reply? What would be the right thing to say–
Everyone froze at the table except Draco. He sensed that Auntie Bellatrix walked in the dining room.
He walked pass by Harry and moved to one of the shelves, searching for something. Harry shifted in his seat, turning towards him. “What are you looking for?”
PPPPS: Has any of you guys watched the movie 'Unbreakable' that came out in 2000? It's the prequel of the movie 'Split' which arrived in 2017. I watched 'Unbreakable' first and then 'Split' and I'm telling you guys, UNBREAKABLE IS SUCH A MASTERPIECE AND NO ONE CAN CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE. The movie's villain and Hero have such a unique way of storytelling. That's how you develop a protagonist and an antagonist. Its OST is also stunning. It left me speechless – it was so refreshing to see something like that nowadays.
Draco shrugs and then gathers his courage.
She was looking behind him.
Ginny gave out a tired sigh and opened her eyes, she could already feel the migraines start.
Nothing at all.
“What’s wrong?” Theo asked, worried. “Draco?! What is it?”
Stole the light around him and grew it to dark.
“You should go to Church, Zabini.”
“I’m going to explain how I know for sure, that he’s a living thing. Just to– put everything on the table.” Harry nodded and Neville smiled at him. “Today, when I found Malfoy, there were other Death Eaters as well. I hadn’t got the time to capture every one of them. I wanted Malfoy, so I was focusing on him.” He shut his eyes, recapturing the scene again.
Draco sat up in the shallow water. He’d only then realized that the glasses were no longer in his hand. He reflexively searched the lake bottom, and felt something hard. He gave the boy an evil smile as he lifted the object out of the water. “Looking for these Potter?”
“What is wrong, Potty?” Tatty asked.
“Why do I-“
“Stop Malfoy!”
“Wait, we only get one meal a day?” Harry couldn’t believe this.
“What? I’m not paying for your stupid robes! It isn’t my fault that you have two left feet Malfoy!” The boy said, getting to his feet. “Give me my glasses back,” he said, reaching for the wire frames.
Draco Malfoy smiled back.
Draco watched as Potter walked all the way up to them. The boy was only a foot from where Lucious sat. Then Harry got to his knees and slammed his head hard on the wooden floor. Harry stood back up. A stream of blood slowly made its way down his face. Draco watched as a drop fell from the boy’s chin.
“That’s the Master! You must go!” Tatty forced a feather duster into Harry’s hand. “Go now. Hurry, run, or you is being punished!”
“Potter?” That’s when Malfoy noticed him. “Why are you here, Potty?”
“Fine, don’t tell me. I’m sure Professor Umbridge would know.”
“A house-elf? What are you talking about? You said the elf DNA in me was really low, right? I’m pretty much human.”
“Don’t tear it,” Draco said. “That’s the only one you’ll be getting. Right, father?” Harry watched the man nod. “Father, I think we should give our new house-elf a name. It wouldn’t be proper to call him by a human name.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry suddenly felt like he should walk toward Lucious. Odd. He wondered what would happen if he didn’t. Harry stood his ground and decided he wasn’t going to follow the order. At first Harry smirked at the man. He knew it. He wasn’t a house-elf. They couldn’t make him do whatever they wanted. Then Harry started to feel something in his gut. It was growing in his stomach. It made him feel ill. Not like he was going to vomit again, but…he couldn’t really explain it. Then he felt sweat bead on his skin. He felt a wave of nervousness next. Then the ill feeling in his stomach spread. It was guilt. Harry was feeling a sickening guilt for not doing what he had been told.
“Watch me,” he said inching closer to the lake.
The Headmaster? Why? There must be something wrong with him. Was he so sick that even the Headmaster had to be informed? Harry waited a long time. He looked at the clock on the wall. A whole hour had gone by before Madam Pomfrey came back with the Headmaster.
“What the fuck Potter! Why are you sprawled out on the ground where people are trying to walk? If my robes even have a stitch out of place you will be responsible,” he said, dusting himself off. “Believe me, my robes do not come cheap.”
Harry gasped when he saw Malfoy looking at him and covered himself with the towel quickly. “W-what the hell Malfoy! You weren’t supposed to look!”
I hope you enjoy the story so far. If you're new to my work, hi, I'm Finnian and I have a website: https://finniansiog.home.blog/ where I post updates and sneak peeks for future chapters and fics along with my original stories you can't find anywhere else. I just finished a big project so go check it out!
“Ha! I knew it. That’s why you don’t like being naked in front of people. But we are both guys…unless. Oh don’t tell me. You’re gay, aren’t you?”
“Same to you, Mr. Potter. Civility please,” She said.
“Oh it doesn’t matter,” Draco said, bored now that Potter wasn’t going to be the one to do it. “Just ham and cheese.”
“No Harry, you only think you aren’t. In the eyes of the Ministry you are. I’m sorry that I ever sent you your Hogwarts acceptance letter. I didn’t know you were an elf. You should have never learned Wizarding magic. You should have never gotten an education. That is my fault. I should have seen the signs, Harry. I’m sorry to have put you through all this. Just relax now. You no longer need to concern yourself with Voldemort. All you need to know, all you need to do, is serve your house. Be a good house-elf, Harry.” Then the man left the room. Harry screamed after him, but the man didn’t turn around, didn’t come back.
Harry wished they’d give him some clothes. He wasn’t used to being naked. He was shy when he had to take showers in the quidditch locker rooms. He always waited until everyone left to take his. And now here he was, naked as could be in a spare bedroom inside the Ministry for Magic. His hands were currently covering his crotch just in case someone came back.
“Stop wasting time. Show him to the custodial closet so he can start his work.”
Harry was expecting a number of things, but not that. Not an apology. Not from Draco Malfoy.
“We need to register him with the Ministry.”
“Malfoy’s dad is a veela?” He murmured to himself, thinking back to the interactions he had had with Lucius in the past. “What...what is Malfoy’s mum’s inheritance?”
“Who’s it from? Hermione? Ron?” Sirius asked, moving to take over the bacon.
“Been out for hours....No no don’t give him….I Am Perfectly Calm!” It was Sirius’s yelling that broke through the hazy din of his half-awake state. His entire body was sticky with dried sweat and just as sore as when he flew his broom through a storm.
It took practically all his strength to lift his arm and turn his head to look at his watch, counting down every second until finally, finally, it let out a long series of beeps announcing midnight. With one last look towards the mirror Harry passed out.
“So tell me again why we have to register with the Ministry first? Couldn’t that be handled at Gringotts too?” Harry asked as he walked alongside Remus and Sirius down the busy streets of London to the Ministry’s service entrance. “I mean wouldn’t the goblins be better at this sort of thing?”
Narcissa rolled her eyes at her son, certain that he had inherited his father’s flare for dramatics. “Draco..” She sighed and opened the letter, tossing a treat to the bird. “Now let’s see here…” She moved her reading glasses from around her neck onto her face and began to scan the letter, a slow smile beginning to curl along her face. “My dear cousin Sirius, Harry’s godfather mind you, has begged for me to help them throw Harry’s presentation party. Isn’t that great Draco?”
His knuckles were nearly pure white from how hard he was gripping the edges of the sink and with every panting breath the mirror fogged up in front of him. “Harry? Harry, pup, are you doing okay in there?” Sirius’s voice was wracked with worry as it called to him from the other side of the door.
“Harry will be spending a lot of time in the manor to learn about his veela inheritance and to plan his presentation party. Which means you will be in charge of playing host to him while I handle the party and his godfathers.” Narcissa further explained, her lips pulled tight. “You will be able to get close to him during this time.”
“Sorry, submissive? What’s that mean?” He blinked at her, his brain finally catching up to what exactly she had said.
“But now isn’t the time for that.” Remus waved his hand around, as if clearing the air of the previous discussion. “You should get cleaned up as soon as you feel well so that we can celebrate your birthday.” That same scarred hand came and ruffled his ever messy hair, “Happy 16th pup.”
“Once, the summer between first and second year.” Harry nodded, “I sent a letter there saying that if Malfoy was done being a prat then I wouldn’t mind attempting to be his friend but I never got a letter back and Malfoy is just as much of a prick as he was then.”
Harry stared at her for a long moment before letting out a great big sigh, “Let me guess they’re also slow to anger and weaker than dominants?”
Sirius had turned the light off as he left the room which helped the throbbing in his head go away. He began to open his eyes fully and smiled when they didn’t immediately burn. His godfather came back and he accepted the glass of water gratefully. Only after he had drained the glass did he speak up. “How long was I out? What inheritance did I come into?” A look passed between Remus and Sirius, “What? What’s wrong?” He asked hesitantly, almost not wanting to know.
Sirius gave him a soft look, “Oh pup, you know you never have to worry about us relying on you for that sort of stuff, you’re supposed to rely on us. If it would make you feel more comfortable you can watch the bacon and I’ll finish up the French Toast” He gestured to the bacon that was cooking in a pan on the stove, “I’ll admit I’m not very good at multitasking and normally Remus helps out.”
After Sirius had wished him the same they both left the room to give him some privacy. He was quick to change out of his, frankly disgusting, sleepwear and head towards the shower to wash off all of the grossness he had acquired through the inheritance process. His entire body was sticky with the dried sweat, and his hair was so matted with it he wondered how Remus could stand to have touched it. He could feel a slight pain in the back of his head and assumed he fell after he had passed out .
