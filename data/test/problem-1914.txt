“Your hair actually looks devastatingly well tonight, please don’t ruin this miracle,” Draco’s voice said behind him.
.’  He raised a hand to his face and absently rubbed at his stinging eyes.  He must need a new prescription
Professor Opacre carelessly waved a hand, smiling widely as she rocked on her heels.  “Oh, don’t worry about that, better safe than in a rush, right?” she said cheerfully.
“I don’t know what is anymore,” Harry mumbled.  He swallowed and tilted his head back, eyes blinking rapidly at the ceiling.  “I’ve got no clue who I am.”
To his surprise, his other cousin stood up from next to Saira.  Quietly, she said, “Marylin Opacre.  Sister to the Head of the Opacre family of vampires from Europe, who are the Head family of the European vampires.  Second-in-command of the family as well as advisor to the Head of the Opacres and European vampires.”  She sat down and Jordan eyed her curiously, wondering why she stated herself.  He shook his head and returned his eyes to his other cousin.
:: he said hesitantly.  Silence met his words, surprise and slight anger emanating from the person in his head.
Harry paused in his stirring for a moment, startled by Qye’s sudden comment. He frowned inwardly and said as he resumed stirring, ::
Her brother made no notice of her threat, staring off into the crowded room, full of Hogwarts students and a few Hogsmeade residents.  When she made the arrangements with Madam Rosmerta, she made sure the regulars would still have access to the tavern while also making sure the students would be safe for event.  She had been a little hesitant that her suggestion for a dance during the last Hogsmeade visit before the intense studying for the O.W.L.s and N.E.W.T.s began would be cast down.  The event she had encouraged for Valentine’s Day had barely passed with approval and probably because the other staff members had most likely thought it would be a better way to supervise couples who would otherwise no doubt attempt other late night activities.
Draco reached for a cocktail that was sitting over a small garden table. He stared at Scorpius, Albus and Rose, a new friend of theirs, a Gryffindor and a Weasley. Scorpius was really out there having the opposite childhood Draco had. The teens were playing on a makeshift pool in front of him, with Scorpius’ crup barking and playfully biting them. Draco took the paper umbrella from the large glass sitting next to him, putted it over the table, took a sip of his cocktail and closed his eyes, as his thoughts drifted while he enjoyed the sunlight over his arms, his summer hat carefully protecting his face from burning. A couple minutes later a voice next to him made his mind return to the garden.
They made their way down the stand and Potter asked him if he was flooing back from Hogsmeade, Draco admitted that he had a Governors meeting in about an hour, the match ended earlier than expected, but he didn’t feel like going away and then coming back, though he wasn’t sure where to lounge at Hogwarts either. Draco knew there was certain uneasiness in his words and the way he referred to Hogwarts, but he hoped Potter could not read into it. Potter, however, thought for a second and then offered to make him company until his meeting, saying he knew some places. Draco asked if this had to do with that wicked map of his. Potter smiled so big that Draco felt his cheeks might explode and then guided him towards the hallways. They walked and talked for a bit, and Draco didn’t really noticed where they were until a door materialised in front of them. Potter smiled at him, as if sharing a secret.
“Are you back to anger again?” a bored voice asked him and he slowly lifted his gaze to wrathfully stare at the vampire claiming to be his godson’s mate.
Sighing silently, the platinum-haired teen withdraw his hand and the corners of his lips lifted slightly when he saw the golden hand flex towards his retreating fingers. He resisted the desire to return his hand and reluctantly backed away from his rival. Shaking his head, Draco ironically thought of how everything had changed since last year.
As she unrolled the attendance roll, Marylin Opacre subtly looked at one of the pair of eyes, eyes that belonged to a particular student she knew she would have problems with.  Draco Malfoy was scowling deeply at her, anger clear in his quicksilver eyes and she could feel the fury roll off him in great amounts.  As she picked up her quill, she absently thanked her mother for teaching her in early childhood how to read the feelings that emitted from the living and how to minimize their effects.  She doubted she would have gotten this far if she hadn’t learned that particular trick.
“Oh, hurry up, I’m starving,” Ron grumbled, looking longfully at the empty plates.  Harry shook his head as Hermione began to admonish Ron in a reprimanding whisper.  Ron shot him an agonized look but he merely shrugged, looking at the Sorting.  He didn’t catch the worried look exchanged between Ron and Hermione.
“He still manages to find ways to do so,” Harry muttered as he stirred his potion.  Professor Opacre laughed again.
“I think anger is perfectly justifiable at this moment,” an even voice said next to him and Sirius wished, just once, Remus would stop being so damned controlled and let himself loose at this monster that had a part to play in disrupting their best friend’s son’s already tumultuous life.
Hermione frowned.  “You don’t suppose something happened between them?” she said slowly, looking confused and thoughtful.  “Maybe he’s the reason behind this?”  She shook her head, frowning more.  “No, Harry would have said something.”  Then she sighed and slumped back against her own chair.  “Maybe.”
“I’m just missing today’s breakfast, Hermione,” he broke in, giving her a look.  “Just…I’ll catch up with you and Ron later, alright?”
“Draco,” Marylin said, her voice bright.  He glanced at her coolly and Remus watched as the vampire determinedly stayed upbeat.  “I’m so glad to see you out of the dungeons.  I know we haven’t had much of a chance to talk and - ”
He didn’t notice Qye’s hidden relief. He also didn’t notice Ron’s narrowed blue eyes at Draco or Hermione’s thoughtful brown eyes on him.
“Oh no, Harry,” Professor Opacre soothed, ruffling his hair as she guided him to the door.  “The pleasure is all mine.”
“Remember to thank Mr. Malfoy next time you see him, Mr. Potter,” she said, her lips twitching slightly.  He stared at her and she coughed, raising a hand to her mouth.  “He was the one who carried you up here after you fainted and he visited you at least twice while you were unconscious.  I think the least you can do is thank him.”
“Y-you always look well-dressed,” Harry stammered as she looked at him intently.  “I know I’m not always…well, it was mentioned that I could use some help and I’m not exactly comfortable with anyone else and Hermione’s got her own things to worry about and someone suggested you might…help.”
“I’ve read so many things about Threstrals,” Hermione continued on, apparently oblivious to Harry’s growing anger.  “They’re apparently wonderful protectors, once you have their loyalty of course, and there are so many myths and legends surrounding them.”  She sighed.  “I so wish I could see them.”
“What are you talking about, Finnegan?” Malfoy said coolly, looking distastefully at the Irish boy but his pale, gray eyes looking interested.
Harry looked at his potion, which was just a shade shy of the perfect color.  Sighing, he reached for a vial to turn in the potion…
“Mr. Black, I’ve explained that we’re as well-equipped as any team at St. Mungo’s - ” Healer Smethwyck began and in another time Sirius would have appreciated that the man didn’t bat an eye at discussing the treatment of the Boy-Who-Lived with a supposed mass murderer on the run.
Harry growled softly as he closed his eyes again.  He had seen the moon shining through the window behind him, saw the pale light fall upon the floor.  He had finally recognized the bed as being one of the beds in the Infirmary, telling him exactly where he was.  He must have been brought up here after the potion backfired on him.  The moonlight was too far on the ground, telling him that he had woken up late at night so he couldn’t call for Madam Pomfrey.  And would he?  Considering what was currently going on?
"When born, there is one stone that seems to resonate best with the child. The jewel is then bound to the child - once again, not going into specifics but that's more because I don't think any of you wish to hear about the process - to be given to the vampire when they begin Maturation.
Professor Opacre merely smiled and nodded. "I'm glad you caught on to that, Neville!" she said cheerfully and the awkward Gryffindor blinked, looking slightly surprised.
“What was that all about?” Ron’s voice asked behind Harry, making him whirl around to see his best friend frowning after the back of the Slytherin.
Draco slowly rolled his family ring between his fingers as he stared at the fireplace in the common room.  It was brighter than usual, no doubt to account for all the students gathered at the tables and couches instead of carefully cloistered in their respective private rooms and rendezvous areas.  His own notes were on his lap where he had been reviewing them before casting them aside as soon as he came across a note on Threstrals.
Everyone fell silent as Myn stood, staring the pair of them down, face pale with cheeks blooming red, eyes bright and burning.
Harry blinked and looked up from his bag to see Seamus grinning at him, his blue eyes dancing merrily.
“Enough with the guilt trip already, Hermione,” Ron grumbled, settling further on the bed and snatching the bag of goodies. “I think we’ve all had enough of it.” He ripped off the wrapping of a Chocolate Frog and bit off the head.
Harry shot him a grateful look, which Ron returned with a grin before he started walking towards the castle.  Harry followed him and he heard Hermione mutter something that sounded suspiciously like ‘
She still hadn’t told her brother about Harry Potter.  It was two months since she had began to suspect this black-haired boy as being their Qye and yet she still hadn’t said a word about him to her brother.  She looked down at the parchment and sighed quietly.
When the rest of the Gryffindors started to question what had gone on that morning, the Weasley twins had promptly offered the latest delicacies their product line had to offer while their dorm mates shrugged it all off.
Sirius dropped his hands and looked up at Dumbledore to distract himself, hands itching to do violence and barely refraining because he knew that without his wand, he stood no chance next to this vampire who supposedly led all the vampires in Europe.
The exams that had seemed so distant were now here and all those hours studying didn’t seem quite enough.
Harry exhaled and ignored Qye’s flicker of frustration.  “Kind of hard to take you seriously when it seems all either of you want to do is beat each other bloody.”  He moved to stand next the blond against the fence.  “Didn’t think you’d act that way with anyone other than me or Ron.”
It was the day after Halloween and Harry was back for the last time at the place he never called home.  Walking up the stairs, he dully recalled the past week.
"My mother told me this story when I was little, before my brother was born," Professor Opacre said quietly, light blue eyes gazing at the spinning jewel. "The Earth was lush and green, full of vitality and at the beginning of its life. The Moon meanwhile hung suspended above it, beautiful in its distance. And on the Moon were hundreds of thousands of millions of precious stones. They were the creations of the Goddesses of the Moon, Goddesses who adored the Earth. And one day, these Goddesses decided to give gifts to the creations of the Earth, humans.
"So?" Ron repeated in a disbelieving tone of voice.  "So?  It's almost Christmas and they're giving us a hell of a lot of work and bombarding us with homework every day!  You would think they would get into the holiday spirit but noooo. . ."
“I think you’re right,” Krista Jeaneyl said, smiling while her hazel eyes twinkled in mirth.  “‘Mourn the losses because they are many but cherish the victories because they are few,’” she quoted, brushing her long brown-blond hair out of her face.  Jacob grinned at her, snapping his fingers.
“Pater!” she yelled and he grimaced as he heard a faint scrambling sound echoing in the hallway, raised voices bouncing off the walls.
"If your potion had exploded, I would have gotten it all over me too," the blond muttered, sprinkling in the final ingredient, firefly wings.  "I don't fancy having my clothes getting soaked on such a cold day like this."  Harry saw the satisfaction in the other boy's face as the potion turned a dark blue.
"That's right, you like green dragon jellies more, don't you, Harry?" Ginny suddenly said, innocence pouring from her voice as she sat across him with her brothers, both who looked up and gave identical sly grins.
The frown swiftly disappeared as Draco whirled around, wand in his hand.  His scowl shifted to confusion as Harry pulled him into an alcove down an empty corridor, silently waiting for the footsteps of the Ravenclaws to fade.
She sighed quietly as she turned and began to walk slowly to the staff lounge.  Out of all the students in Hogwarts, those three were among the few wizards and witches who she could count on to help vampires, both in battle and by spreading the ideas.  There were others, of course, but those three were special.  She didn’t want anything to happen to them.
His former student turned around.  Remus noted that the young man was taller, broader than the youth he had seen only a couple of years ago.  His face was growing into the pointed features, a sharp look maturing and beginning to show a glimpse of the man emerging.  He didn’t know whether if it was because he was caught off guard or something else, but the gray eyes gazed at him without a hint of arrogance or contempt but rather the assessing look of one reserving judgment.
“I just want to know that if the Dazains are truly a threat at the moment and if they will be if they join Voldemort,” his cousin said quietly, his back turned to them.
“There’s only so far dragonhide can appeal,” Draco said dryly.  Then he gave Harry a long look, something dark and heated flickering in his eyes and making Harry forget about the night chill for a moment.  “Although, if you’d ever like to try it out in other ways, I’d be more than happy to give you a hand.”
?:: Harry mumbled at the other and he could hear them laugh softly.  He shifted in his bed, squirming to get in a better position, when a new thought came to him.
:: Harry muttered as he slowly began to open his eyes more.  He winced as he felt his eyes tighten again and he paused, allowing his eyes to adjust before opening them further.  ::
“Don’t be ridiculous, Seamus,” Ron said in an annoyed voice, having stopped laughing when the blond arrived.  Glaring hatefully at the cool Malfoy, the redhead growled to Seamus, “Harry wouldn’t do that.  Would you, Harry?” Ron added, glancing at the confused boy from the corner of his eye.
Then something hit his mind, making his head snap towards the wall and creating a small burst of pain.  But he didn’t pay any attention to it.
"Oh, leave him alone, Hermione," the redhead said, rolling his eyes.  "He probably just can't wait for classes to be over so he can finally get some time to relax.  Isn't that right, mate?" he asked, grinning.
“She takes orders from her brother, Harry,” Draco said, looking at him.  “Has been for years now.  Say what you will but they aren’t just here for good relations.  Not just for that.”
This year, it seemed Dumbledore – it had to be Dumbledore, Harry just couldn’t see any of the other teachers arranging to do something like this – wanted to promote inter-house relations as well as inter-magical relations.  All the classes of the Gryffindors were doubled with one house or another.  But that wasn’t what had convinced Ron that their beloved Headmaster was truly senile.  Oh no, what had convinced his fiery friend was that fact that almost all their classes were paired with the Slytherins.
Harry had a flashback to Draco telling him he had gone to the Opacre heir’s bonding when he was ten.  A sickening feeling began to grow in his stomach.
Harry stared and slowly nodded.  “Okay…well, then.  I’ll…see you tomorrow at four.”  He ducked his head in embarrassment.  “Thanks again, I know this is probably really strange.”
“I don’t know…” Hermione responded uneasily, her brown eyes also looking confusedly at the map. “It never has before…”
“At some point, yes,” Wainscott said matter-of-factly.  “I anticipate conducting several different psychological questionnaires with both of you present and then again with you individually.  I would like to talk with both of you and also hold one on one sessions.  More than likely we will debrief together after that, not accounting for breaks in between each section.  None of these have to occur in a specific order so it really is up to you on what you would like to do first.  There isn’t really a plan for how to run an evaluation like this so I will be adapting it to others I have done, with individuals and multiple persons involved.”
“Easier than it could’ve been,” Harry said carefully, looking away from the blond and back at the Shrieking Shack.  “If you recall, the last time you talked about this I left you oozing on the train.”
"Oh!" Hermione suddenly said, jumping and flushing. Harry blinked at her and Professor Opacre laughed.
In his hand, the Daily Prophet hung loosely with its wild speculations about the end of the term attack still on its front page, right next to the continued silence from the Ministry about the whereabouts of the Boy Who Lived.  The Prophet had run a piece earlier in the week, when one of their reporters – thankfully not Rita Skeeter, as Hermione held her warning high over the unregistered Animagus – had gone to the orphanage the Ministry had designated and did not find him for their questions.  There were questions and whispers as to why Harry Potter never made it and where was he now that You Know Who and his vampires were a threat to their world.  There had been rumors that he had engaged the Dark Lord during the attack but there was no word from Dumbledore or any of the other staff, who instead commented about how the Hogwarts defenses held during the assault and how the alliance represented with the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher had come to their aide.
He heard something like a snort and he glanced over to see Sirius rubbing a hand across his mouth while Remus jabbed his elbow into his side.  The black-haired man shrugged and when Remus looked away, Qye blinked as he thought he saw a slight wink thrown at him.
“Merlin,” Harry muttered, rubbing his temple slightly.  He frowned again as another thought hit him and he gave Draco a slightly suspicious look.  “Why haven’t I heard anything about this from any of the others?”
“Same thing I’ve been doing all week, Qye,” the Healer said absently as he ran his wand down Harry’s side, carefully lifting his arm and bending it like he had the other side.  “Making sure neither one of you is on the verge of getting me knocked around by the army of people asking me about you every day.”
was all he heard before he felt Harry withdraw, alone in his mind as he stared at the waiting adults, at Lest staring straight at them, face hard and stubborn.
“I was waiting until we were all together,” she sighed, fingering her dress sleeves.  “I thought it would be easier if we just said everything then and - ”
“Well,” the vampire said dryly, “You almost ruined your potion with a wrong ingredient and now you’re stirring so fast that some of it is sloshing over the edges.  Bit of a klutz, aren’t you?”
No…wait.  He wasn’t completely numb.  A new feeling was rising in him, something dark and…his eyes widened slightly in horror as he recognized the feeling and then he closed them quickly, shaking his head minutely.  ‘
“Are you sure you’re feeling up to this, Harry?” Hermione asked him anxiously on Monday as they made their way over to the Great Hall for breakfast. “I mean, if you’re still feeling weak, maybe you need to recover a bit more and I’m sure Madam Pomfrey would be more than happy to take you in for a few more days - ”
Marylin led them to rooms in a wing Remus had never been to, away from the staff rooms and dormitories, a few floors from the Hospital Wing.  She had been quiet on their walk there and with every hallway passed, Remus saw the frown on Sirius’ face grow deeper and darker.  Even the sight of Dumbledore waiting for them did nothing to erase it.
Ron paused in his search, stared at Hermione, then shook his head as he realized how futile it would be to explain to her that angry women were generally something guys tended to avoid like the plague. Looking back down, he grinned as he caught sight of a piece of ragged parchment peeking out. Tugging it out, he triumphantly held it out to the brunette, who rolled her eyes.
Finally,  “Zebie, Daniel!” became a Hufflepuff, and McGonagall took the Sorting Hat and stool away.  Dumbledore once again stood up, beaming at them.
“Doing it without asking me!” he snarled, tightening his grip on the stake while his hand ached and his stomach rolled and his heart kept shattering.  “Making me forget!”
He looked back down at his essay and let his mind wander through the last two months.  September had flown by quickly and now there was only a week left until Halloween.  All around the castle, decorations of live bats and floating pumpkins filled the school.  Everyone eagerly awaited the Halloween feast but he doubted that anyone was even more eager than the fifth years.
“That,” the vampire man said tightly, dark brown eyes staring menacingly as Harry choked and tried to pry the hand off his throat, “was unwise.”
“And interrupting us!” Hermione said exasperatedly.  She made a little shooing gesture with her hand.  “Don’t you have better things to do?”
“We’re not kids,” Harry said irritably while Qye looked down, frowning as he fought away vague memories and reaching for his anger once more.
He stood, his lips pulling back to reveal his fangs, his eyes pinned on her, furious and disbelieving.
“Watch yourself, Saira,” Marylin suddenly said softly.  They all jumped when she spoke and even Saira looked at her.  Then she leaned back, seeing the fires of anger leaping from quiet Marylin’s eyes.  Jordan suddenly remembered how frightening his other cousin was, just like her brother.
“As I said,” she said wearily as Lest slowly rejoined her, his eyes on the unconscious figures, “we need to talk.”
Walking over to his seat, he dropped his bag down and slid into his seat without a word.  Malfoy was already sitting in his chair, idly flipping through his Potions textbook.  The blond didn't say a word as Harry unpacked his things and green-eyed boy watched him out of the corner of his eyes as he took out his supplies.
One of the vampires rebounded, lifting themselves up quickly and diving for the distracted Gryffindors.  Ron drew strength for another fire spell.
,’ he thought to himself as he carefully stepped around the body and warily glanced down the hallway.  ‘
“I had a cousin who died as a result of him,” Draco said lowly, his gaze far-off and dark.  “He had participated more in the Muggle world, thought there were some things the wizarding community could use from them.  My mother made sure never to speak of him while my father was around.  I think I’ve only met him a few times in my life and never at the manor, never where my father could see him.”  He was quiet for a moment.  “I remember him always trying to make me laugh with these terrible jokes and he would grin when I called them stupid.  He never took offense.  Those few times I saw him with family, he always wanted to make sure everyone was comfortable.  He could get into a conversation with anyone.  Despite thinking he was a fool for wanting to spend time with Muggles, I liked him.
He ducked as she grabbed the nearest ornament and flung it at him.  Brushing the fragments of the shattered vase off him, he looked mildly at his fuming sister.  “Time of the month?”  He ducked the flying book next.  “Guess so…”
Sirius looked back at the teenagers, ignoring Dumbledore as he nodded at Wainscott and made his way out, reluctant as they took faltering steps to the door.
Jordan shook his head in exasperation.  “Jacob,” he began in his most calming tone of voice before his hotheaded twin got into a fight with the head of the Hastai family.  His twin’s red hair matched his fiery disposition and Jordan once again thanked all the gods and goddesses that he wasn’t next in line to be head of the Taine family.  That happy title landed on their older sister, Natalie Taine.
"Your whining is well acknowledged," the female vampire said, rolling her eyes. "It does not change the fact that it's going to happen however."
The vampire stood a few feet away from him, his hands casually in his coat pockets.  There was a strange look in his eyes and his body stood stiff and tense.
Harry glanced around at his classmates and even though there was still a fair amount of people who hadn't fought yet, they were all acting as they had at the beginning, with downcast eyes and disheartened spirits. He felt his fingers twitch and he didn't even think about it, wanting so badly to erase that arrogant expression -
“I just…” Harry sighed and gazed at that the shack and the barren land surrounding it, mindful of the careful manner the blond was holding himself.  “I guess I’m just surprised by how easy this is going.  It almost feels too easy.”  He toyed with one of the loose panels of the fence.  “You can’t tell me you don’t feel the same way.”
Shaking her head, she ignored the young Malfoy’s insubordination and continued to call roll.  She paused however when she heard a quiet voice say, “Here.”
Draco drummed his fingers on the fence lightly.  “Goes back to the fact that the wizarding world hardly has contact with them.  Rogue vampires, maybe, once in a while, who quickly get taken care by Venators if not their own while wizards and witches look the other way.”  He scowled lightly as he gripped the fence.  “I imagine most students had some notions about vampires but were most likely more curious than anything.   Coupled with the fact that they sent the most disarming vampire they could…”   He shrugged stiffly.
Potter was looking rather ill, his tea long forgotten over the table. Draco took advantage of this turn of events to drink from his own cuppa. He left it over the table and turned towards McGonagall, with a way more relaxed tone than before.
“When are you not, you bloody Mother Theresa.” Potter laughed. While Draco went back to what Potter said, realising something.
Draco stood fast and Potter did as well, ready to leave. Draco opened the door and, before leaving, he turned to Potter, who stopped on his tracks, almost crashing on him.
Potter finished his cocktail and so did Draco. Then, he materialised new ones for both, grabbed the sunblock and applied a new layer. Potter raised his shades and looked at him, laughing quietly.
Draco turned back to him, tried reading his expression for a second, Potter looked relaxed and focused on the match. Albus passed by next to them, speeding up, probably after catching a glance of the Snitch.
“Accidents happen.” Harry finished for him. Draco nodded, and Harry followed, as if it was an automatic response of his to imitate Draco's gesture. He turned back to his son, who remained calm despite the mood of those around him. Harry wondered if this was also a side effect of the potion for the pain. He turned back to Draco. “How long does the potion last?”
“Of course, thank you. I’m Harry… Potter. I’m assuming you must be Astoria?” Harry offered her his hand, which she eyed curiously before shaking it and nodding.
“Not really.” James seemed to be thinking about it for a second, while moving the chicken around. “She is very professional.” Harry nodded, a bit distracted by his own thoughts. A yell came from above the house, Lily was calling for help because Albus wasn’t letting her use the bathroom. Harry woke up from his meditation and looked at James, who shared a sympathetic look with him.
“It’s some case at work. I’ve been involved closely and its been draining. Being in the field and the paperwork, I don’t know what’s more dreadful, honestly.”
“Ginny? Yeah. I mean, when she is not at some very important competition abroad or complaining about Slytherin’s team being a disaster, except for Albus…” Oh there it was. The reason the ring was certainly not coming back. “She is still very supportive, of course, but we agreed the pressure was not good for Al. So, she stopped coming halfway through last year. She does come for the important matches, though, but it’s better like this.” Draco stared at him, but Potter dodged his eyes and turned to the board, where his bishop moved and killed one of Draco’s pawns. Draco noticed the light was away from his face again. “What about you?”
“Don’t you think it’s bizarre how fast things change? One day we are at Hogwarts, staring at the Giant Squid, the next my son is pretending to be one.”
“You can talk…” Draco feigned indignance and guided Harry towards the cauldron with the hangover potion.
Draco walked them out into the garage, which was mostly empty except for some old trinkets. Potter frowned.
“I don’t want to sound like a cliché, but they really grow up too fast. I’ll be heartbroken when I won’t be able to carry her again or, worse, when she no longer wants it.”
“No. I-“ But, Potter’s face seemed so honest that his insides twisted, and he started considering he might be more nervous about the opposite happening: everyone being so welcoming that he would be the odd one out. “I’m not ready.”
Draco continued his way towards the house in the horizon, trying to forget about his uneasiness. Scorpius, his gaze still to the ground, followed and Potter and the little girl caught up quite quickly. Draco decided to ease the tension by asking the obvious.
“Well, I thought relevant to have a chat with you about a situation that has been developing throughout this school year that involves both your sons… Considering I rather avoid any misunderstandings that might arise between you two if I just send a letter about it, I thought you could spare fifteen minutes of your busy lives to come here.”
Harry stepped back, looking more hurt than afraid. Still, he went out and closed the door behind him with force. Draco breathed hard, feeling his chest tightening, he tried to even out his breathing, certain he was having a panic attack. He was unsuccessful, so he grabbed one of the flasks on the top shelf, the one for emergencies, opened it, and drank the whole thing. He then felt extremely tired, like he just ran a marathon, his body weak but his breath back to normal. He slid slowly to the ground, his back to the wall. Once he felt his heart rate going at a standard speed, he dared to look at the cauldron in front of him again, the one
“At the Room of Requirements? Or at this place with more pillows than chairs?” Draco huffed, Potter could be so insufferable at times, honestly.
Draco’s guards made a warning, making Draco jump from his chair, before recomposing himself. He reminded himself there was only one person he had been waiting for, so he made his way to the entrance. Potter liked to Apparate outside of the door, arguing that wizard’s methods could be a bit invasive, he rather announce himself and let the other person decide to let him in or not. When Potter first mentioned it, Draco thought the discussion a bit ridiculous, but then watched how invested Potter was on his own opinions and let him ramble.
“Does this have to do with their adventures? Because I would hardly consider those part of a ‘situation’, professor.”
Draco thought about this for a second, he could understand what Potter was saying because he felt the exact same way around him. Despite how nervous he felt initially at Scorpius befriending Potter’s son, since their walk at The Burrow and the reception Scorpius had had by everyone there, he felt himself relaxing. And Potter got a particular way of reading him that it was hard to explain to others. They knew each other’s boundaries from years of experience trying to break them, but now that there was no ill intention, they seemed to be creating a safe space within them.
“It won’t take too long, don’t worry, Potter.” Draco stared at Potter as he drank quite a large sip of tea, and couldn’t help but noticing a shadow on his ring finger, a mark of something that was no longer there.
Scorpius actually smirked at that and kept his ramble about Hogwarts, “We usually like to explore the hallways and find new paintings we don’t know yet, and he uses his special map to, like, check who’s in it and who’s not, to… um… avoid some people…”
“How was it coming back to Hogwarts for Quidditch? Do you think it’s better or worse than in our days.”
Potter turned to him with fury in his gaze. Draco tried to offer him a glass, but he rejected it with his head.
Draco breathed deep and thought for a second in a happy memory. However, what seemed to come to his mind were all those moments in which he had tried to cast a Patronus but instead was flooded by dreadful images of his mother suffering and his life turning grey as the dementors around him made him lose all hope and joy. He noticed his hands were grasping tightly at his wand and tried to shake off the feeling. He opened his eyes, finally, and saw Potter looking at him intensely.
It was a beautiful sunny day, wind flowing along Draco’s robes, which were proving to be too warm for a day on the Quidditch grounds. Draco climbed through the stand and found a cosy spot on the Slytherin side, he could see the team stretching and planning game-plays below. He found Scorpius in his Quidditch robes and smiled, this was his first time playing as keeper, replacing the other one that got injured a few days prior. When Scorpius wrote him a letter, extremely excited about it, Draco knew he had to be there, the fact that the Governors meeting was on the same day was just a happy coincidence. Scorpius caught his eye and waved, Draco waved back, excited and proud, Albus, who was right next to him, also wearing his Quidditch robes while reprising his role as the seeker in the Slytherin team for the second year, waved as well. Draco smiled to him and then felt someone waving close by.
He heard the sounds of fighting echoing through the grounds as the vampire stared at him and Harry caught his breath, brows furrowing when the vampire did nothing more.  He vaguely heard Qye mumbling something softly, repeatedly, as he straightened and looked uncertainly at the growing frown on the vampire’s face.
"But he said - " Neville begin and then stopped, turning a bright red when every eye turned to him. He slouched further down, edging to hide behind the group. "Never mind," he muttered.
Draco felt his arm getting warm, and he sensed himself lingering on the touch until Harry finally let go and Draco remembered his instructions. The Dragon moved one foot towards his finger, then the other, and as soon as it was standing on both feet remained frozen as steel, as it did before. Draco was so shocked by this he kept his finger with the dragon close to Harry’s face, a smile growing on it with something tender behind it, that Draco couldn’t help but reciprocate as well. Draco had a strong urge to tell Harry how amazed he was by this, by it, by him… whisper it in his ear, like asking for… for what?
“Do you need a pepper up potion? I also have a hangover one, personal recipe, that you can keep around your house, just in case…” Draco said, teasingly.
Potter smiled and pulled her in his arms, despite she being almost half his torso. Draco eased his expression, and he could feel Scorpius lifting his head again.
“How is France?” James smiled and shook his head as he picked a pan and putted it over the stove. He took out his wand and put a light fire underneath, then floated some shopped vegetables in it with his wand and wiggled them around. He turned back to Harry.
Potter laughed and rubbed a hand through his hair, clearly unaware that he was messing it up even more. Draco dropped his gaze and remembered the Chess game, he commanded one of his pawns to move.
“It doesn’t have to be that…” Harry turned away from him and stared at the horizon, thinking. He continued, “When I cast mine I felt my godfather’s life depended on me, and I had this foolish notion that someone else was going to come and save us… But when no one came… I realised it was all on me. And it happened.” Harry seemed to be deep in thought, again, or maybe just flooded by memories. Draco thought about Harry’s godfather, which, if he wasn’t mistaken, must have been Sirius Black. He wasn’t sure what Harry meant by ‘saving him’, but he wanted to hear more.
“Woah, I want to try it! I have never tried hangover potions myself, but I love your brand, so I’m excited for this one…. Where have these been my entire wizard life?” Potter said, as he stared longingly at the flask.
“I- I brew potions and sell them. Got a company of my own.” Then, Draco spoke what first came to his mind and his rook moved.
“Like I said, not a threat, a challenge.” Draco laughed to himself, denying with his head. Potter continued, clearly not giving up, “What if… in exchange, I also teach you how to cast a Patronus?”
problem.” Potter nodded, taking the challenge. Then, he looked from the flask to Draco, lowered his gaze, as if considering something, and, finally, turned to Draco again.
In front of them, Albus was splashing Scorpius and then running away. Draco took of his hat for a second and wiped off some sweat building on his forehead. Then, a splash of water fell on his face. Frowning, he followed the source of it to find Potter pointing his wand at him and laughing like a little kid.
Harry Apparated right outside Draco’s door. He was hesitant to ring the bell, as this was the first time he was back here after Draco kicked him out, and the accumulation of emotions he was feeling was overwhelming, to say the least. Part of it was anger, some frustration, and then there was also nervousness, because he wasn’t sure how he would react when he finally saw him. There hadn’t been any type of communication between them, not even for his birthday a couple of weeks ago, and his instinct was telling him he might punch Draco, or shake him at least… something that involved close contact and confrontation, the opposite of what happened last time. However, his son was still best friends with Draco’s son and was waiting for him inside, so Harry took a deep breath, decided that it was in his best interests to behave contrary to his instincts, rang the bell and waited, his mind racing as steps came closer. The door finally opened and Astoria greeted him from the other side.
, chest of Potter greeted him, he remembered instantly and lowered his gaze. Potter looked at him confused.
On this occasion, they were at Draco’s backyard. Draco had his sleeves pulled back and was feeling particularly exhausted after managing to shy away the dementors at Azkaban, in which the boggart had transformed, by a particularly strong white light that his Patronus had produced. Harry addressed him excitedly.
“Well, be ready for a whole animal coming out of it soon, Draco.” Draco gasped again and Potter looked at him with a mischievous smile, the fucker. He would not let him get a response out of him every time he talked to him, though.
“We’ll see…” Potter smiled and stared attentively at the board, focused only on that. Draco tried to think in his next move, decided to move his bishop to protect his queen. Potter kept advancing with his knight getting closer to Draco’s bishop. A pleasant expression over him as a storm formed outside. “I have to admit I’m rather surprised at how much I enjoy your company.”
Draco stared at the enchanted clock over the wall on his cottage house, actually, his only house, once he had moved out of the Manor to form a family. The clock marked ten minutes past four and, for the first time while living here, he found himself staring nervously from the clock to Potter, who kept pacing the floor exactly underneath it, staring between his watch and the stairs, as if that mere action could drag Albus down.
“Thank you for having Scorpius over… it means a lot to him.” Potter stared at him for what seemed like hours but were likely only seconds and smirked.
, dad… You don’t give up on people.” Harry stared at James’ eyes, the same as his… as his mother’s. He felt himself staring at a mirror for a brief second, and a shiver ran through his spine at the recognition that this wasn’t himself, time had passed, and now his older son, similar in some ways, but so different from him in many others, was reading him better than he could have ever read himself. He sighed.
He shuffled her hair playfully and Lily responded with her first laughs since he had seen her. Then, in a high-pitched voice, “I’m tired, dad.”
“You are not as significant to the Weasleys as you think you are, you know?” Draco raised an eyebrow at him, which got Potter shaking his head again. “But you can attest that yourself by meeting everyone inside, I bet Scorpius would love to be delivered by you.”
“Of course. Thanks for owling me… Bye, Draco.” Harry smiled at him, who just nodded as pink dressed his cheekbones. Harry turned to Scorpius and addressed him as well. “See you soon, Scorpius.” Scorpius smiled wide and waved a goodbye to both. Harry looked over Albus, noticing his still quite calm demeanour, and denied with his head in a fond way. He finally held his arm towards him and Apparated in front of Patty, at the bone-healing wing, her expression a bit too excited, given the situation, as she took Albus from Harry’s hands and helped him to a litter.
“I don’t know how to fix it, because I’m not sure what I did wrong. Draco shut me off… out of nowhere.” Harry stared at his son for a second as the smell of garlic, onion, pepper and chicken filled the room. He remembered what Albus mentioned earlier. “Has Narcissa said anything about him? About his marriage?”
“Oh, wanna bet? I’ve got very good distraction tactics.” Draco raised a questioning eyebrow. Potter took his shades off, putted them over the table and then took his shirt off. Draco almost choked on his cocktail, he could feel his face flushed and turned away, trying to cover it with his hat even more. He could see from the corner of his eye as Potter spread sunblock over his chest, and Draco forced himself to close his eyes. “My confundus charm does wonders…”
Harry nodded and settled to work. Draco walked around the lab, he was starting to feel dizzy, but he didn’t understand why. He came back to Harry and reached for the flask, felt even more lightheaded, so he turned around and walked the opposite way. He took one of his blank labels, marked it with the name of the potion, and put it on the flask, then turned back towards Harry, who was now laying on a nearby cauldron. Draco got close to him again.
“I mean it. I feel I can forget about the usual dynamics in my daily life when I’m with you… I feel no pressure to perform, no need to be… something, someone. It’s refreshing.”
“Wait. You’re doing it again. Clockwise, Potter. Do you seriously cannot remember which way the clock goes?”
Harry placed the postcard with a simple wandless spell near other similar ones on his wall that showed touristic spots of Paris. He stared at his collection and smirked, this was now an ongoing inside joke between him and his son. Growing up,  James used to mock Harry often for his muggle habits. Now, Harry mocked him instead for being the most attached to them from his children. To get him back, every time he got the chance to send him muggle mail, James did, and he always chose the most clichéd postcards to do so. Harry contemplated the picture, and considered taking a
“Don’t even remind me. One of the many times I felt I was going to die just so Gryffindor could win.” Draco puffed a breath out. Despite how many times Draco had bothered Potter during their childhood, yelling threats and bad wishes at him, he had always been quietly impressed at how much stamina he had. Draco wouldn’t have lasted that long at Hogwarts if his life was threatened like Potter’s was every single year. “Ginny, has not been as fond of the regulations, though. She seems to think that playing Quidditch at Hogwarts as you do in the professional league trains you better for it, says it makes you tougher. But… I don’t know, I’m happy my kids can catch a break while they grow up, you know? They can develop a tough skin when they are older, there’s no rush. For now they should just sit under the sun and play with leaves for as long as they can.”
“You bet.” Both teens did what seemed to be a secret handshake. And, after they finished, Harry started walking, with Albus using his shoulder as support. Draco stopped them after the second step.
“You can stay… Hang out for a while, say Hello to everyone else.” Draco frowned, his instincts were telling him there was no way he was going to be welcomed with open arms, and he wasn’t ready to stomach that.
“That’s not- I mean, that would be lovely… and I bet he would be thrilled, but that’s not what I’m saying here…” Harry turned back at him. “Every lesson we have, your eyes open and shine in excitement… You enjoy explaining things to me and are patient and quick to understand what needs to be done and how to make me do it…” Harry was now looking at him with a frown, but without muttering a word, which Draco took as encouragement to continue, “You must have realised already that I am, certainly, not as tolerant while instructing others.” Harry smiled at him, a tender expression that made Draco stop for a second before continuing. “But I think your insistence on us continuing the lessons have just as much to do with you wanting me to cast a Patronus, as with you having many qualities that make you love teaching.” At this, Harry dropped his gaze and chuckled.
“I think this is a great start.” Draco made a confused face, was Potter listening or playing dumb? “Childhood doesn’t have to be the happiest period of our lives, but it is a moment that can inspire joy…”, he thought for a second before continuing, “How does Scorpius’ childhood makes you feel?”
Lest raised an eyebrow. “You said after dinner, did you not?” He nodded towards the castle. “It’s starting.”
’  She shook her head and looked back up to peer at the doorway.  For a moment, she just stared at it, wondering whether to get her hopes up.
Qye’s fist cracked against the stone and he heard Harry’s sharp inhale as he hissed and pulled back, rubbing at his reddened knuckles.  When he turned to Harry, sitting upright and concerned, he gave him a look with all the anger still boiling under his skin.
"Then why don't you go up, Granger?" Parkinson muttered, pushing Zabini forward a bit more. The dark-haired boy shot her a burning glare as he was forced to take a step forward before holding his ground.
Movement happened in the corner of his eye and Harry turned his head in time to see a beast lunge, its terrible features snarling at him.
“You’ve always been strong,” Ron said, as he straightened up and moved to sit next to them.  His blue eyes narrowed at him.  “You-Know-Who trying to make your life a living hell, end of year exams, Malfoy being a git, you’ve never let any of this beat you down before.”
Dark blue eyes he hadn’t seen in what seemed to be ages looked into his own, framed in that same pale, aristocratic face he had once glared and smiled at.
“It’s alright,” Harry said, waving a hand and taking a step back, relaxing slightly.  He smiled shyly at her, then turned around and walked out with his friends.  The redhead was snickering as he followed his friend and Harry glowered at him while blushing slightly.  The brunette just looked at her for a moment before joining her two friends.
class to opt out of this simple exercise?" The professor smirked knowingly when several students shifted uncomfortably and eyed each other.
There was a sickening feeling as he saw the unconscious form of Asger, mind automatically scanning for telepathic assaults and finding nothing but an almost stirring consciousness that told him Asger would wake by himself soon.
“Another way for you to torment me,” Harry replied irritably, glaring up at the blond.  “Can’t you find another wall to lean on?  Or another person to torture?  Or, better yet, another school?”
“A night like this, huh?” Harry hummed, keeping leisurely pace with the blond.  He watched the Shrieking Shack appear in the distance, dark and looming.  It was offset by the clear sky with its almost full moon, the stars accompanying its light to shine down.  He couldn’t help but smile slightly as he felt Draco press closer, mumbling under his breath about dilapidated conditions.
:: he shouted back at the other one, trying to shove away the voice.  His body shuddered and he squeezed his eyes even more.  He knew he was at the edge of hysteria – maybe he was already there - but god, there was a voice inside his head and he wanted it out and  –
The bushy-haired girl shook her head, quickly taking out a thick book and hiding her face behind it.  Harry blinked at the hidden girl as they rounded the corner to the Potions classroom.  He turned his face away from her and back to the other boys as he heard Seamus and Ron erupt into laughter.
:: Qye trailed off again and the silence resumed. Harry continued to fiddle with the frog remains, coughing occasionally. He tugged at his collar, blinking tiredly. The dungeons – usually freezing – felt boiling and the smells of the potions and ingredients seemed stronger than usual, making him swallow constantly. Maybe he should’ve eaten something after all.
“That’s a first,” a dry voice said beneath the dark hood.  She grinned, moving closer and hugging her taller brother lightly.
:: Harry thought back to the person, also irritated and pained, his eyes tightly shut and palms pressed up against them.  ::
Chuckling slightly and throwing an amused look at the murderous look on Hermione’s face, he offered the two sweets to the vampires.
He stared at him, horrified and blushing even more.  Groaning, he covered his face with one of his hands.  ‘
She saw Asger sweep between Harry and the vampires, his spear sending them all scattering back as Harry dashed off closer to the school, snagging his wand along the way, unfortunately towards the dueling wizards.
“Excuse me,” interrupted Lest stiffly, the surprise gone from his eyes, pushed aside by the annoyance that now filled them. “But as I recall,
Harry sighed, relieved at not having to think so much.  “Thanks,” he said gratefully, reaching for the parchments.  He blinked as Malfoy laid a pale hand on top of his own, raising his eyes in confusion to the other’s while heat crept up on his face.
“Right,” Draco exhaled.  He stuck his hands in his pockets and looked at Harry from the corner of his eye.  Harry met his eyes and couldn’t help but flush at the sight of his reddened lips and mussed hair.  Whatever Draco saw on his face seemed to help because he saw his shoulders start to dip, relaxing as he nodded.
Apparently his cousin thought so too.  “Watch yourself, Leon,” he said coldly, glaring icily at the older man.  “You may be older than me and friend of my father but remember that I outrank you in every way.  Don’t question me or make me remind you why I outrank you.”  Leon lowered his eyes and the Head of the Opacres looked at him hard for a few more moments before nodding.
As if some higher power heard him, his two best friends beside him immediately launched into another argument yet again.  Mentally sighing, he pushed around the food on his plate, his mind straying back to what he had been thinking about all of November and most of December.
“I already like the date I have!” Harry burst out, flinging his hands out as his panicked eyes watched the eyeliner move dangerously close.
He looked around quietly, walking through the house slowly.  Barely a week since they had been killed and yet all of the Dursleys' possessions were gone, leaving white spaces on the walls.  The house felt strangely large and empty without the pictures of Dudley being spoiled.  The clouded moonlight shone through the living room windows, creating monstrous shadows out of the trees and bushes out on the lawn.  Harry shivered and wrapped his arms around himself as he turned away from the living room.  This was where his aunt and uncle had been found.
“The Headmaster would like to speak with you, Potter,” she said in a tight voice.  Harry’s brow furrowed slightly.  It almost sounded like she was…pained?  Her eyes appeared to be a bit too bright as well.  Apprehension began to bubble up in him.
“Bloody hell, you look like crap, mate” were Ron’s first words when he saw the shorter boy slumped over his plate.
“I was right about you being ill,” she repeated, her blue eyes looking at the small black-haired boy in concern. “You looked a little pale to me. Why haven’t you gone to the Infirmary?”
“Really?” Harry muttered under his breath, Qye unrepentant in the face of the answering shock of the room, still viciously satisfied at the blow inflicted.
“Right,” Seamus said right as Dean came back with Hermione bundled up in her sleep robe.  Dean hovered in the doorway and Ron could see a few curious faces behind him, obviously attracted by Dean’s shouting.
Ron stared at his best friend, a bit of hurt rising in him.  There was something wrong with Harry.  Ever since that potions accident – hell, from before – the green-eyed boy had been acting oddly.  Harry hardly ever spoke even more and only when Hermione piled up his plate did he eat enough.  He still smiled but that familiar grin was dull and forced now, like Harry thought he had to smile all the time, like everyone wanted him to smile even when he didn’t want to.
’ A flash of pain went through him at the memory of those distant eyes and he swallowed painfully, his anger fading. Taking a deep breath, he pushed the hurt away. ‘
He froze when he saw the unconscious guard on the floor, the carefully protected door slightly ajar.
Shaking his head, he sat down on the bed and curiously felt Harry, shifting uncomfortably at the feeling but ignoring it. He frowned as he delved further into the presence of the other.
Harry gritted his teeth as a flush started to work its way up his neck.  Trying to control it, Harry lifted his chin challengingly and raised an eyebrow at the blonde.  “To what?”
Harry reached out and grasped Draco’s free hand with his own.  He saw a flicker in Draco’s eyes and ran his fingers over Draco’s.
Harry coughed, held himself up by the tree and looked up as the vampire stared contemptuously at him.
The black clad man looked at him for a moment, the pale face half-shadowed.  Then slowly, the pale red lips curved into a sadistic smile.
“I suppose I just don’t want to question it too much,” Draco shrugged, dropping one of his hands on the post.  “And I wouldn’t exactly say it’s been easy.”
“I suppose,” he said slowly, shifting his bag.  “Is there anything in particular you want me to bring?  I don’t have much beyond school clothes but - ”
He watched Harry breathing slowly, lying so utterly unaware and vulnerable.  He imagined people walking in, looking at Harry, looking at Qye, and coming to the conclusion they both knew everyone would.  Qye closed his eyes and reached out like he had the past half year, his mind searching to brush against something to center him.
Maybe he should take a vacation.  An early retirement even.  The things happening right now, this hadn’t been what he had been elected for, he was only the Minister of Magic not some -
He wasn’t ten, he wasn’t fifteen going on sixteen, Merlin only knew what he was.  He knew so much and was capable of further still and Harry had no doubt that he’d adjust to living as the teenager he now was.  But he was still, in ways that mattered, very young.  And Harry felt a stirring in his heart, even as he nodded and broke their stare, looking out at the Black Lake while they waited for a decision.
She finished taking the attendance and she rolled it up.  She walked back in front of the class as the roll vanished to wherever the attendance rolls went.  As she smiled kindly at the class, she noticed that almost all of them were more comfortable than they had been in the beginning.
“This was never going to be something resolved overnight,” Libby explained, settling herself further in her seat as Lest stood with his hands flexing over her.  “Or even with a few simple sessions.”
He looked across the table at the two boys, wondering what they were thinking.  He knew the one calling himself Qye by the lack of glasses, observed as he sat rigidly, a glare fixed at the wall right above their heads.  His eyes shifted next to him, looking at the one he knew as Harry, quiet while he looked down at his knees, his hands gripping the couch cushions tightly.
He sat there in silence for a few moments, calming himself so he could think about all this. Harry was like a little part of his mind, nestled in the back, almost unnoticeable, silent and just giving off feelings of sleep and sickness. Qye chewed his lip, looking at the covers of the bed.
When he didn’t say anything else, he felt another shift and heard Remus say, still in that level voice, “I still don’t understand how this is possible.  Headmaster, weren’t there precautions taken when Harry was placed with his family?”
“Poppy, what - ” Smethwyck began as the adults stared at them and Qye glared at them, trying not to give in to the rage still boiling under his skin as he kept his eyes away from the vampires.
Ron gasped as he staggered and clutched his head, squeezing his eyes shut as a vampire hissed in his mind, violently rooting around.  ‘
Harry lurched to his feet and stumbled out of the stall, blindly heading to where he had dropped his cloak.
Draco gave the room where the Boy-Who-Lived lay one last, lingering look before turning around and catching up with the other man, who was already striding down the corridor. They walked in silence for a while and it was only until they began to descend to the dungeons that the younger Slytherin broke the silence.
In his head ran a myriad of thoughts, the looks of the students and staff, the judging press in the papers, the strangers delving into another part of his life that in another person wouldn’t matter at all.  The expectations of who he was and who he should be with and exactly who Draco Malfoy was and the disappointment and -
“If your refer to immortal as being unable to die,” she said dryly, “then you’ll have to look elsewhere.  While it is harder to kill one of the undead like myself, it is not impossible.  I won’t tell you how to kill one, however,” she said, her eyes twinkling slightly, “Since I plan on finishing out the year here.  I would like to get my paycheck for this and go for a long trip of shopping.”  There was more laughter at this and she saw a few roll their eyes in good fun.  She inwardly rejoiced.
The bell rang throughout the household of Number Four, Privet Drive.  Vernon Dursley scowled, looking away from the television next to wife.  His son, Dudley Dursley just continued to slurp on his ice cream while his piggy eyes were trained on the television show, home for the weekend after plowing down one of his classmates.
“Hang on,” Black said, his voice wavering as she shifted her gaze to him.  He stared at her, his hands gripping the report tight in his hands while Lupin held it open in his lap and read silently.  “What does…I mean, it’s good they’re not - ”  He fumbled with his words, struggled much as he had in that final observation.
Five years of his life were completely false, the memories that he remembered and made decisions on were all fabricated and unreal and Qye…Qye was the real part of him.  The boy who valued more time reading in the library than out on the Quidditch Pitch, the boy who made fun of Ron and Seamus and the people he called friends, the boy who had a harsh view of people, trusted not a single person but made friends with vampires.
The group moved closer and Harry saw Hermione waving her hand at them from inside the crowd, smiling. He waved back but tilted his head in confusion as he saw her shooting glances at Ron, who was trying to look over the excited crowd.  She gestured at something with her hand and Harry shook his head, not understanding.  The brunette rolled her eyes and impatiently waved her hand, motioning for them to come closer.
He rolled the sweet thoughtfully in his mouth for a moment, Hermione looking inquiringly at him and Ron wincing slightly as he munched on the Chocolate Frog. Then he popped out the red sweet and looked at curiously at it.
Something glinted at the corner of his eye and he turned his head to find a mirror hanging next to another bed. He hesitated, then slowly walked over to it, his walk becoming firmer with every step. Swallowing, he stepped in front of the mirror…
The younger boy slowly retreated from looking through Harry’s eyes and the black-haired boy grew even more anxious by the sudden withdrawal and blank, slightly stunned, feeling from Qye.
The vampire let go of Harry, stumbling to try to avoid getting hit by the errant spell.  In the next instant, a familiar long spear pierced his shoulder and he snarled as he stumbled forward.
"Did you use Videte or..." Professor Opacre trailed off, turning to look at her brother with a curious expression.
The person froze as he threw himself at them, wrapping his arms around them, shaking and choking with pain, landing in someone’s lap. The voices stopped, there was quiet, peaceful quiet, and his cries and whimpers echoed loudly as the blows came again and again.
Ron smirked as he crossed his arms.  “I bet she’d like to know why you’re so tired as well,” he said lightly.  “Maybe you’re coming down with something, you’ve been acting all funny lately.  I should probably go talk with Madam Pomfrey as well.”
There was a sickness in his stomach, crawling up his chest and creeping in his throat, trying to burst out and scream.
“We talked about the breathing exercises and countdowns, Qye,” Smethwyck said evenly as he lowered Harry’s hand and lightly tapped his shoulder, making the teenager roll onto his back, his eyes closed and face undisturbed by the trembles in room.
Coughing, he turned back and blinked when he saw Malfoy gazing at him with a thoughtful look in his silver eyes, the anger gone without a trace.  He looked curiously at the other boy and the Slytherin dropped his eyes.
He leaned back in the couch, looking thoughtfully into the fire.  “I think you’ve done reasonably well,” he said slowly, “considering your position.  Not the best results but you still have three and a half months left.  I think, given that time, we’ll be able to get the help we need should the Dazains launch something with Voldemort.”
Lest snarled something, taking a step towards the other blond.  He stopped and hunched forward, gasping as he clutched the elbow he tried to hit Draco with.
“Want?  Nothing.”  Qye joined Harry in staring flatly at her.  “I don’t.  I’m here to make as impartial an evaluation as possible and that means listening and learning as much as I can about you.  I know nothing about you, Harry, besides the things I’ve read in the Daily Prophet and I know we both know to take those articles with more than a grain of salt.  I have this,” she gestured to the file, “and I’ve spoken with Healer Smethwyck about his observations with the both of you this week.  But second-hand information isn’t enough for an informed decision.”
Deciding that they would try the potion turned out to be the easier part of the process.  Reviewing the ingredient list again after making the decision had revealed that while making the potion itself was not complicated, it was time-consuming and would go straight through the O.W.L.s, assuming that they could get all the ingredients on time.  He had briefly considered making another run for Snape’s storage but decided against it as he realized he would not have Hermione’s assistance.  Which created another problem as he realized that not only would he have to brew the potion on his own but he needed to do it somewhere his friends would not be likely to discover.
The boy turned around to return to his friends and without thinking, her hand reached out and mussed his hair.  His head snapped back to her, eyes widening in shock, and she blinked.
The group murmured their thanks and she saw Alicia glance over her shoulder, none too subtlety at Lest.
Gasping, he heaved once more but nothing more came out, a few tears sliding down from his squeezed shut eyes.
“Students to their dormitories,” he suddenly heard Dumbledore’s voice echoing through the Great Hall, through the corridors, vaguely in the distance to what he assumed was the entire castle.  “All students to their dormitories.  Advise a portrait if unable, assistance is on its way.”  His voice fell to normal volume as he strode to Lest, casting his own spell to render a beast immobile.  “Professor Opacre, please continue your shielding and enact what we discussed.  Professors, assist the students back to their Houses as rehearsed.  Minerva, Severus, if you could - ”
He felt the other one roll their eyes, obviously unaware of his shock and horror.  In a slightly irritated voice, they repeated, ::
Shaking his head, he opened his eyes and looked around the deserted corridor. Everyone seemed to be in classes right now but Qye didn’t want to take any chances, silently keeping to the edges as he walked through Hogwarts.
“Am I supposed to answer you with my life goals or something?” he asked back, boredom carefully threaded in his voice as he walked past the bookshelves, eyeing them and wondering if he could pass the time just reading instead of answering.  “I’m just a kid, what do I know what I want to do with my life?”
“Brother dear,” Marylin said amusedly, her blue eyes dancing, “You’re not going to obliterate that poor tree now, are you?”
Professor McGonagall frowned as she handed over the day’s assignment to Hermione, the bushy-haired teenager promising that Harry would be fine with a day’s rest, she wasn’t convinced he needed yet another trip to the Infirmary.
One night, after the rest of his dorm mates passed out before him, Harry took the opportunity to flip haphazardly through the pages of Qye’s journal.
the one who put that one in there because Ron and I cleaned out all the others. He must’ve put it when we had our backs turned. Ooh, he better hope - ”
“I just fucking said, didn’t I?” Qye snapped, not even making it to seven.  “You’re here to prove to everyone we need to be fixed - ”
The figure stilled and the smile faded from the pale face, replaced with a thoughtful frown.  “I promised him I wouldn’t kill you,” the man murmured, obviously to himself.  Vernon paled drastically at this and he heard his son’s sobbing increase while his wife’s wheezes became more frightened.
“Dumbledore?” Saira said sharply and Jordan jumped, turning his eyes back to the table.  Saira looked furious and was glaring back and forth between the Opacres and Verna.  “Dumbledore?  As in
"I'm sorry," Seamus said loudly, finally breaking the silence left in the wake of Professor Opacre's cheerful declaration. "I must've gone temporarily mad. I
Harry grimaced slightly, glancing back up at the crowd to check if Ron and Hermione had come in yet.  Not seeing them, he dropped his eyes back down.  The ingredients’ theory had sounded good in the beginning.  But without knowing which ingredient he could have been allergic to – unless he chose to test them all, something he didn’t particularly fancy – they had a grand total of 27 ingredients to research, some basic potion, others a bit more rare.  And he had no clue how any of them could have caused this.  He blew out his bangs in frustration.
We are one chapter away from the finale of Part 1! If you have read this far, I'm very thankful and glad you are so close to the end :)
“Of course.” And he went away, Draco kept the door opened and watched him walk a bit ahead before he turned with a ‘Goodbye, Draco’ and apparated, as Draco waved back at him. His stomach was a mess, his hands were grasping at the fabric inside of his pockets, and Draco knew that this was bound to be terrible or absolutely amazing.
Draco’s first impression, by the look of his surroundings, was that Potter was fucking with him. He could have given him a closer field to appear in, not one with a 30-minute-walk ahead of them, in the middle of summer. It was likely that the bastard didn’t want anyone to see his face. This was all a scheme to keep contact as scarce as possible. Well, too bad, because they would be hosting Scorpius for the entire weekend, and Draco had heard he looked like a carbon copy of himself at twelve, so good luck with-
“I don’t know what’s about you two that no matter your age, where you are in life, what you are doing… whenever you get together you seem thirteen again.”
“Are you threatening me?” Draco smiled, cunningly. He liked when Potter let his Slytherin side show.
“We were flying around and…” Albus looked up towards Scorpius, who was frowning back at him, and continued, “I got distracted… slipped and fell to the ground. The end.” Scorpius turned to look at the ground, and Harry knew there was more to the story, but there was no point in pressing for it.
Potter finished his cocktail and Draco materialised a new one next to him. “I’m sorry.” Potter was looking at his chest and arms, probably at the scars that sneaked behind his shirt. “I didn’t know what it did back then-“
The whistle rang and the commentator announced Slytherin was playing against Hufflepuff. Draco and Potter watched as Scorpius flew by on his broom to the Slytherin goalposts. A couple minutes later he sent a Quaffle away, Draco smiled, and celebrated quietly, Potter, instead, whistled. Draco turned to him, an inquiring look on his face, Potter finally turned back to him and shrugged, then returned his gaze towards Albus who was surveying the field, looking for the Snitch.
“What about you, Malfoy? What do you do with your time? I don’t think I have ever asked, have I? For some reason we always end up talking about Auror duty or Quidditch.”
Despite his mind yelling at him to huff and return walking, head high. Potter’s face was now pressing a challenge, and there was no way he was walking away from that. So, he reached for the broom and gave Potter a short nod.
Harry was so shocked by seeing Astoria for the first time, he remained speechless for a few minutes before he finally replied.
Draco realised they were sitting quite closely, which was why he was able to notice all these details. He noticed Potter smelled strongly like the Quidditch field they just were in, or maybe the smell rubbed on them, then there was a hint of something strong and sweet that Draco was certain did not belong to himself. He then focused on Potter’s eyes, which he had never seen so green, and he wondered if they have always looked like that. He remembered the shades Potter was wearing outside, he couldn’t recall when he changed them for his usual round specs, but clearly it happened some time between the match and them entering the room.
“What a privilege… But then that would mean I need to find you a belated birthday present.” Potter said, with a cheeky smile.
Harry stared at his window, a dust of snow falling peacefully over his garden, an electric guitar accompanied by an operatic voice going on a very high note in the background. He followed the music with his fingers and took a sip of his tea. Then, he grabbed some of the mail that was resting on a corner of his escritoire. He looked through it, ignoring everything with the letters “URGENT” printed over, because it was Sunday and he wasn’t in the mood. He stopped at a postcard with the Champs-Élysée in it and turned it around, smiling when he confirmed this was from James. Harry turned it around, checked the stamp on the corner with amusement and read the short message:
“Open it first. And you gave me already my own means of making hangover potions, which is more than this, believe me. This is just… A token of sorts… To keep you interested in our lessons.” Draco took the box back to himself, sighed, and rolled his eyes, then opened it, and from the box, a tiny silver dragon came flying around them. Harry looked at it, happily, while Draco stared at it in awe, a smile also sneaking through his lips. The dragon landed on his finger and then stood very still, he could feel the coldness of the silver solidifying on him. He turned to Harry, flabbergasted.
Potter did react to this, and though his expression still showed anger, there was also something more. Maybe surprise?
” By now they have taken to call each other by their first names, but Draco loved how riled up Harry got every time Draco let his last name slip, so he chose specific moments to do so very carefully. They remained quiet for a while, then Harry spoke again. “Why don’t you tell everyone about the stories behind your potions? I think that could be a great marketing strategy to sell more potions… People love things that have a person with a story behind.” Draco turned at this at him, now wearing a frown himself.
“I don’t know yet, Potter, but I wouldn’t be surprised to find out there’s certain pride and shame related to it.”
“Fuck off” Draco haven’t heard Potter curse in... well, ages. And, from the look on his face that went from a bit of shock to, maybe regret, it seemed like Potter himself haven’t either. He moved his hand to the bridge of his nose, lifting his glasses and pressuring hard. “You know what, Malfoy? I don’t have the energy for this.”
“You have improved a lot. I’m serious.” Harry sat down next to him, took some grass from the ground, and tossed it towards him, without much success. Draco looked at him and puffed, dismissing the comment, and his failed attempt at throwing grass at him. He knew Harry was right, though. He was now more capable of evoking happy memories when casting the charm, and that added power to his Patronus. If some of them included Harry and their recent meetings, was no one’s business but his, not even his Mind Healer’s. However, the absence of a real threatening situation was keeping him in a comfortable position, that Draco felt stopped him from making a full Patronus. “I feel what’s missing is a bigger risk. The boggart will not really push you into having a corporeal Patronus…”, Harry said, almost reading his thoughts about having figured out the fuel but not the motivation for the Patronus. Draco smiled at how connected they were, Harry raised a questioning eyebrow.
This is it! Thank you for reading all the way, and I hope the journey felt as fulfilling for you as it did for me. However, if you recall, this is only the first part of a two-part story. I have the rest of it planned and thought through, and I can tell you for now that it will be mostly from Harry's perspective. However, I still need to write it, so my guess is that it will come a month from now, with a new chapter every two weeks. So stick around that time, if you want to read what happens next, and, again, thanks for being here!
Draco turned abruptly to him, surprised and looking a bit lost for a reply. Then, he looked away from Harry and towards their kids, smirking. Harry felt hope rush to him. Yes, this whole encounter was still a bit awkward, but maybe Draco didn’t fully hate him. Maybe…
“You know why…” Harry shot a knowing look at Draco, then looked away, “I could give private lessons to Scorpius if you want, and if he is interested in them...”
Draco snapped back to Potter, who was clearly addressing Scorpius. Scorpius turned to Draco first, like asking for permission. Draco gave him a small nod, despite hating that his son felt the need of asking. Scorpius turned to Potter and Draco could sense one of his son’s long rambles coming.
Draco opened his eyes as Albus was yelling at Scorpius while using some pool noodles as extra arms. Scorp tried to hit him, playfully, with some floats, probably pretending to be the Whomping Willow, while Rose laughed at them while laying on the grass.
“Well, Al will be thrilled to know you are here, Scorpius. Want to go inside and say Hi?” Scorpius smiled and turned to Draco with a question on his face.
Draco frowned but felt some excitement growing at having the usual Potter back. He caught sight of Potter’s eyes, shining over some dark sockets as he lifted his shades to focus on Albus who was now diving near their stand.
Draco tried to regain the hangover potion from Potter, but he had a strong hold on it and pulled it away before he could even fight for it.
Draco opened the door and found Potter in work-out, casual, clothes. Draco checked his clothes again, feeling a bit over-dressed.
Draco was surprised to find an expression of amusement in Potter when he lowered his potions. He handed them to Potter, who glanced at the pepper up and drank it immediately, then stared at the hangover one and opened his eyes very wide. Draco noticed his mistake then, but it was too late. Potter turned to Draco with clear surprise.
“Probably…” Potter smiled to himself, and commanded his other knight to move, Draco’s rook was destroyed.
Potter downed the rest of his drink. Draco was considering if Potter might be regretting mentioning anything, when he turned back to Draco.
“Nothing. Your obliviousness… We’ve been meeting here for… what? The entire Christmas break? This is not your usual.”
“How about third year… you terrorising me with the dementors, disguising as one… That incident pushed me into producing a corporeal Patronus.” Potter drank half of his new cocktail.
Draco frowned, but stared intently, it wasn’t usual for Scorpius to misbehave. He had raised him with love and care, but also discipline, making clear to his son there was a history behind the Malfoy name that was unavoidable. Draco didn’t want him to carry that burden but he also didn’t want him to be naïve or unaware of how the outside world might treat him because of it. His first year had gone by without major developments, this year, though, things had taken a different path and he didn’t need McGonagall to tell him. Scorpius himself have been keeping him up to date through their letters, all about another Potter.
Draco watched as Potter stood, rubbed his hand through his hair and paced again. He looked particularly tired and uneasy, he kept staring at his wristwatch, rubbing his eyes and yelling for Albus to rush, something he never did, even when he got appointments afterwards. Draco knew this because he paid attention, that’s all.
consider the position?” Potter’s head snapped fast at him. He then bit his lip, and made his bishop return.
“First, a bit of introduction. Just some stuff you must know about, but just in case… Patronuses are used mostly against dementors, which is why they feed on your happiest memories. But they can also serve communication purposes and a sort of ID. As you know, everyone has a different Patronus form, and part of the fun is discovering what’s yours. So… before we even open the suitcase, I should ask for you to focus in what you consider your happiest memory…”
Potter covered his eyes with his fingers, rubbing slowly. Draco stared at him curiously. On the occasions in which Potter came to pick up Albus, Draco and Potter’s interactions tended to circle around friendly insults and attempts to outwit each other, nothing too strong but still a bit reminiscent of their days at Hogwarts. And Potter was usually quick to shoot back, even amused by it. Today, though, he was acting as if every word out of Draco’s mouth was a personal attack, no wonder he was tired.
“Wait, hold up. I’m not- I mean- I-“ Potter took a long breath, Draco was turning his back at him with his arms crossed. After some five minutes without Potter muttering another word he turned back at him. He was sitting over the suitcase that kept moving underneath him. “Shall we start over?”
Draco immediately let loose of his hold, laid the glass over the table. Then turned with a frown to Potter, who gave a quick stroll, lifted the glass Draco had poured some minutes ago and downed the alcohol in one go. Draco looked at him, shocked. Then, focused on Potter’s hand as he left the glass down, noticed no ring again.
, a tiny wisp of white light came out of it, clearly not enough to repel the dementors coming from the dark tower, but enough to surprise Draco, whom, in all his attempts at casting this charm, had never gotten anything close to make his wand produce any type of response. Potter stepped in front of him and the boggart started shifting into a collection of his children, sick and pale. He yelled ‘
Potter snapped towards him, then looked at the little girl and giggled. Actually, giggled. Sometimes Draco wondered how Potter, Head Auror and Defeater of The Dark Lord, could possibly be the same giggly man walking next to him.
They walked back to the garden, and Harry took the chance to grab Albus’ broom, which was laying on the ground, before approaching them. Harry stood back up with Draco close by, and looked at Albus and Scorpius, now playing in the ground with the crup.
“A bit much, I would say.” But Draco continued waving his flag. Who would have thought having Potter on the same team could be so entertaining.
“Merlin, way better. I feel McGonagall’s regulations have made it way more bearable for kids to play it. Cannot forget that one time we flew under an impossible storm.” Potter moved his knight and Draco thought of his next move.
Potter kept up the conversation with lighter themes that involved his adventures with the map during his own childhood, and Draco found himself being actually shocked at how much Potter had got away with because of this map. He would need to have a chat with Scorpius about how only a Potter could do this with no repercussions. However, with each story Draco felt the tension easing from his shoulders, to the point that he only felt it creeping back when he caught a glance of the entrance, only a few steps away.
They left, leaving behind the image of a frowning Draco with a playful crup biting his robes below him.
’ left his mouth and a silver stag came out of his wand and start running around them. Draco stared at it with wonder, trying to comprehend how did Harry manage to make his Patronus work in such a stressful situation, with hundreds of Dementors around and two more lives depending on him, when he turned back to Harry, whose expression looked grimmer than before. “No one should be subjected to something like that and is long overdue for the Minister of Magic to finally remove them from Azkaban. I’ve tried, but… some political issues escape my reach.” Draco stared back at the stag, now seemingly eating some grass from the ground, nothing actually entering its mouth. Draco looked back at Harry who was now staring at the stag as well, way more relaxed. Draco couldn’t help but be amazed by the whole story, and the wonderful Patronus in front of him.
Draco could read how Potter meant every word. His dark bags under his eyes showed many creases, as if measuring the years they have been over his face, a reminder of tiring times. Draco moved another pawn and stared at Potter’s finger again. Potter certainly mentioned Ginevra with no ill intention, he even sounded calm, but Draco was still itching to ask him about her.
Potter ignored him and Draco decided not to push it, he could tell Potter wasn’t that convinced of his own answer. Draco moved his knight again, threatening Potter’s bishop.
Draco went to the small corner he had prepared for the lesson and prepared the ingredients they will be using. He usually took about a week to brew a batch of Hangover potions, depending on how many he was making. With Potter, however, he planned to make two batches: one assisted by him, and one made entirely by Potter, with him nearby to supervise. So, all in all, this should take them about two weeks. Draco had already explained all this to Potter over owl by an itemised list of time, ingredients, and possible dates for meetings, considering brewing time and practice. And Potter’s response, as no surprise to Draco, was: “We’ll take however long we’ll need for the Patronus lessons, only need a private space and a boggart, and I’m sure I can get the latter… See you soon!” Potter finally joined him over the table, Draco passed him a cutting board, a knife and a piece of rhubarb and they set off.
Qye wasn't the only one whose tensions were leaving. When Professor Opacre entered, he felt the other students calm, Seamus going as far as muttering "Thank you" and Neville letting out a relieved sigh.
Qye closed his eyes as he remembered the soft, warm oatmeal, livened up with bursts of sweet strawberry, zangy raspberry, and tart blackberry. And the orange juice, though room temp, had been sweetly refreshing as he drank it, the smooth tangy taste wakening him. And the muffin with its delicious spread had been warm and comforting.
“You know the first thing I’m going to do as soon as I graduate?” Ron muttered Monday morning as he rubbed his tired eyes.  The sun was shining, the birds were singing and there was a Potions quiz first thing in the morning.
“Yes, yes,” the Head Nurse said impatiently, still looking annoyed. “He’ll need a lot of rest but he’ll be fine. I’m surprised he made it this far though. Boys,” she sniffed and returned to her office.
“Fine!” Saira shouted, throwing her hands up in the air.  “Let’s join these damn wizards already.  But the minute they start to want to tag us and treat us like servants, I’ll be among the first to say ‘I told you so’ and fight for myself.”
It was completely unlike everything he had with Draco, burning where Draco’s had been warm, demanding where the other had been inviting.  He stood in shock as Lest wrapped his arms tightly around him and held him, desperate and confusing.  His eyes were wide and he could see that the vampire’s eyes had fallen shut, hiding all traces of that strange look.
Harry had stared, slack-jawed, at the lack of the reaction from his best friend.  To see the redhead, who had just a couple of weeks ago turned red at the mere glimpse of the white-blonde hair, not affected by Harry talking casually with his rival instead of his friends while awaiting Hagrid had sent warning signals off in his head.
“Oh, don’t be harsh, Harry,” Professor Opacre chided as she smoothed the hair back into place.  “And yes, I suppose it didn’t really help when it was just him but when he brought - ”  She suddenly stopped.
“Tomorrow and beyond,” the Mind-Healer said in a final tone of voice, silencing the group.  “Qye, Harry, go to bed.  I’ll be seeing you both tomorrow after Healer Smethwyck and Ms. Nilsson’s check ins with you.  After that, everyone, we’ll discuss the plan moving forward.”  She looked around, coolly meeting everyone’s eyes.  No one said anything and she nodded, waving her wand.
“I noticed you were comfortable with Harry…” she said, her light eyes watching him sharply.  “That’s the first time you’ve smiled for real since…since five years ago.”  Lest said nothing, his dark eyes focused on the fire.  She pressed on.  “He’s one of my best students, you know.  He and his friends could probably help us - ”
Hermione eyed him suspiciously as he put aside the guide.  “You can even keep it, alright?  I just want to think about it.”  She nodded slowly and Harry reached over to quickly give her hand a small squeeze.  “Thank you,” he murmured.
“I am not leaving him!” the voice snapped and his hand trembled against the wall, his vision blurring as longing and relief and every emotion he ever had hit him because that voice,
“You didn’t used to be this angry,” Harry said quietly.  Qye snorted and opened his eyes, propping himself up just enough to give Harry a disbelieving look.  Harry rolled his eyes and laid back down, watching him with slowly tiring eyes.  “You didn’t.  You would get mad, sure, but never this quick.  Not like this.”
Shaking his head, he thought about what had happened next. Harry had come back, he felt their connection again but when Qye had called his name, the other boy had remained silent. Harry radiated a numb sort of horror and pain and Qye had been relieved when he had started responding to the old man. But he hadn’t understood what occurred. The old man had asked Harry what he had seen and Harry had begun talking of Muggles – that name sounded familiar – and Voldemort. And right before everything went black, Harry had said a name that Qye knew he had not known before.
“I’m going to get McGonagall,” Dean said, stumbling out of his bed, tripping over his robes strewn on the floor.  “I should - ”
“Well, it seems your fever has finally broken, Mr. Potter,” Pomfrey commented, removing her hand. Harry restrained a sound of loss and opened his eyes in time to see her bring out her wand. “Or, at the least, is on the verge of it. You should recover in a day or two.” She waved her wand over him and the green-eyed boy squinted painfully at the sudden bright light. He thought he saw her mouth tighten and he definitely heard an irritated tone when she next spoke.
The elevator for their floor dinged open and he grimaced as he caught sight of the figures in hooded jackets, bands of silver and blue and red around their arms, silently standing vigilant in the shadows while the few other Ministry workers still working avoided looking at them.
