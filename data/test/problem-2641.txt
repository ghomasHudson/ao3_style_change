“George, hi,” Harry said, deftly wrapping a bouquet of brightly coloured tulips in cellophane and securing it with a bit of tape. “What can I do for you? I’m on my own, so it might take me a little while.”
“I know, I’m sorry. It’s always a little bit mad for the first few months of a new year, what with Valentine’s Day and then Easter,” Draco replied. “We should quieten off a bit now.”
Harry turned in Draco’s arms, lifting his own and wrapping them around Draco’s neck. “We were. But then you got me all riled up and I thought we’d better come straight home.”
Ron grinned and gave Harry a wave, turning on the spot and Disapparating.
Ron nodded and wandered over to the displays while Harry headed back behind the counter with the flowers.
“School, if you’re anything like me,” Draco snorted. “Unless you count the catalogue at work when we look at it together.”
“That reminds me, I must pop in and get one for in here,” Pansy replied as they entered the parlour. “I
Draco chewed his lip.
“When did you realise you were gay?” Harry asked, glancing at Draco. “If you don’t mind me asking.”
“Harry? What’s wrong?”
Draco paused and looked at Harry. “I…”
“T… Tulips?” Harry asked, his gaze immediately falling on the brightly coloured blooms in their display buckets.
“Yeah, it makes sense,” Harry said. “Six o’clock isn’t too late for dinner in my opinion.”
Five minutes later, he was on his way once more with a cardboard cup holder containing the coffees in one hand and a paper bag containing the bacon sandwiches in the other. As he got closer to Paperwhite’s, his stomach began churning again, until he was outside of the door. Taking a deep breath, he turned his back and used it to push the door open.
“Oh, believe me, I know,” Harry replied with a nod. “I might not have looked like I was paying attention in his lessons, but I know he was a good teacher. I may have paid more attention if he hadn’t given me the impression that he hated me from the moment he first set eyes on me, though.”
“Ah, you’re here, good,” Draco said, walking towards Harry.
Draco nodded before glancing around and then quickly leaning over to capture Harry’s lips in a heated kiss. “See you then,” he murmured as they parted, then turned on his heel and headed for the Apparition point.
“Alright, I get the picture,” Ron said, chuckling. “So will we ever get to meet him?”
Harry laughed and shook his head. “No, I just don’t wear them very often. I didn’t think full dress robes were necessary.”
Stepping out of the Floo at the Leaky Cauldron, he set off down the alley towards Paperwhite’s. It was still dark, and the air was crisp but not too cold yet. The streetlamps cast a soft glow onto the wet cobblestones below and Harry smiled to himself. He was always reminded of the magical feeling of the street at this time of the morning, while it was still quiet. Even though he’d been coming here for nearly twenty years now, it never got old.
“Never mind. Alright, what’s the book we’re reading?” Harry asked.
happening again.”
“Of course,” Harry nodded. “Can I do anything to help?”
Ginny rolled her eyes and turned back to Harry and Draco. “Aren’t you going to sit down?”
“That’s all well and good, but I need to get the antidote for this potion,” Draco said. “I know I don’t have any because I don’t keep Draught of Living Death in my house. I don’t suppose you do, do you?”
“Have fun,” Pansy replied, wiggling her fingers in their direction as she swept away in the direction of the drinks table.
Harry flushed. “Yeah, well, it was nothing, really.”
“Oh. Well, he said he was going to have dinner with the Weasleys and they were having roast beef,” Draco said, unfolding his own napkin and placing it on his lap. “So I told him if I wasn’t having roast beef too, I’d hex him.”
“You’ve forgiven me then?” Draco asked, his hands on Harry’s backside.
“No, I suppose you’re right,” Draco nodded. “Anyway. I think we’re finished here, aren’t we? What time do you need to be at The Burrow for?”
“Goodbye, Harry!”
Draco gave him a smile, pleased that his choice had been received well. “I’m not sure we’ll get it all read today, but we can always come back to finish it off.”
“Yeah, by the way, when you make someone up to throw people off the scent, don’t say he looks like your actual bloke,” Ron said, rolling his eyes. “Honestly, I thought you’d remember
“Sometimes I think he
“Yeah, of course,” Harry nodded. “We always have time to make bouquets for people who walk in. So what colours are you after? Any particular flowers?”
“I know. You’ve done a good job. I’ve enjoyed getting to know you,” Harry admitted. “It’s not something I ever saw happening, but there we are. People change.”
“I know,” Molly said with a sigh. “I know I shouldn’t judge him based on who he might have been. It’s been too long between then and now, but old habits die hard.”
“Who would have thought this would be so difficult?” Harry asked softly, a smile on his face as he looked down at his coffee cup. “It’s like being fifteen all over again.”
“It’s all fun and games in the shop, Pansy,” Draco said lightly. “You should drop in one day, find out for yourself.”
Harry laughed as the table fell silent as they began to eat.
“Whatever you like,” Harry smiled. “I think we probably pass every kind of takeaway if we decide to walk home, which by the way, I think we should do.”
“It smells great,” Harry said, following her into the kitchen. “I’ve been looking forward to it all week.”
Harry shook his head. “No, I think that would be worse. It would make him nervous.”
Harry ladled some baked beans onto his plate and carried it over to the table, sitting down. He turned and opened the cutlery drawer behind him, taking out a knife and fork as a second thought. He began to cut into his fried egg.
“Nothing, obviously,” Ron said quickly. “Merlin knows Charlie was happy the way he was. But I think because we’re such a big family that Mum was worried we’d all miss it if we only had small families.”
“Mm, well, we’ll see,” Harry said, sitting back slightly as the pudding landed in front of him. He took hold of the serving spoon and cut himself a portion, depositing it into his own bowl before the pudding dish moved on to Ron.
“Excellent choices,” Harry said with a grin. “Right. Let me just get some greenery to go in with them. The ferns always look good mixed in with the roses. And some Gypsophila. Do you want it in a vase or just wrapped?”
“I hope so. I can’t cope with doing the deliveries every day,” Ron said, causing Hermione to tut loudly across the table.
“I’ll just have a tonic water, if that’s alright?” Tim said. “I’m not much of a drinker.”
“That we’ve both been idiots and it’s time we talked?” Harry suggested.
“Yes. Something I’m sure he’ll be grateful for at six-thirty tomorrow morning,” Draco said with a grin. “Although a quick hex would certainly wake him up.”
“Good point. Anyway, come and grab a seat before Charlie gets here,” Ron said, shifting slightly in his seat.
“I’d like to think so.” Draco grinned. “Let’s hope we never find out though, eh?”
Draco laughed. “I’ll be back in a few minutes, don’t worry,” he said, sliding off the sofa and standing up. “Anything in particular?”
“Well, since you asked so nicely,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “It wasn’t really a date. I was just helping Harry out.”
“What do you mean you don’t know what’s wrong with you? Why do you think there’s anything wrong with you?” Draco asked with a frown.
“I can’t remember why we put it in there,” Draco said, also frowning. “It seems a perfectly good–” He was cut off by the sign collapsing. “Ah.”
“Do you think you’re missing out?”
“I can imagine. You realise that if people catch us in the same bed, you’ll get even more attention?” Harry asked.
“Of course,” Harry replied, nodding. “So is there anything else we should know about him?”
Harry grinned and watched as Draco left. They weren’t in the same department at the Ministry, but it wasn’t unusual for Draco to go and investigate objects found during raids prior to them being brought in. Glancing at the clock, Harry groaned before getting up and leaving his office. It was time for his briefing.
“Oh? Do tell me more,” Draco replied, glancing up as he neatened the small pile of dust and debris that had accumulated throughout the day. “You didn’t mention it this morning.”
Draco nodded. “Yes, it’s starting to look a bit wilted now isn’t it? We’ll use some nice summery flowers to freshen it all up. And, I was thinking, maybe we could rearrange all the displays. Nothing too drastic, of course. Merlin knows the old dears who come in would complain if we moved anything too far from where it’s been for however long.”
“They don’t do things by half, here,” Draco said as he sat down carefully. “I like that they use bread rolls rather than sliced bread, too.”
Finally, he set off to meet Ron, Hermione and the mystery man. At least, he assumed it was a man. Hermione hadn’t actually said, he realised. Shrugging, he walked into London. They were meant to be meeting in a Muggle pub this time, and he had to say that he was glad. If things went terribly wrong, he’d be able to slip away easily.
Draco smiled and turned away, nodding. “Pass me the brush on your way to fill the bucket.”
“Maybe take a sleeping potion?” Ron suggested. “Something that’ll let you sleep a bit longer. I know you, you’ll be up at the crack of bloody dawn no matter what time you go to bed. We’re off for the next four days, so if you spend the whole day in bed no-one’s going to mind.”
Draco nodded. “Yes. Well, sort of. It’s in the building, but everything in here is magical.”
Harry looked down at the list and then back up at Draco with a groan. “Oh my… you’re right. Why didn’t I notice that?”
“Alright,” Harry said, picking up the other sandwich and unwrapping it to take a bite. “Have we got orders to make up as well?”
“No reason,” Draco said with a shrug, lowering his head to kiss Harry once more while simultaneously shifting to straddle his lap.
The following evening, Harry arrived at Draco’s flat at five o’clock on the dot. He’d Apparated rather than taking the Floo as he’d forgotten to check whether it would be alright for him to Floo directly into Draco’s flat. He paused for a moment on the doorstep, looking up at the building in front of him. It was more modern than he’d expected, although the building itself was clearly an old structure. On the face of it, the building was a house, but Harry knew better. There was a big bay window facing out onto the street and a wide stone staircase led up to the door, which was painted in dark green with a bright brass door knocker in the centre. He glanced at the neighbouring properties, wondering if Draco had some sort of charm set up so that any visiting wizards could Apparate in and out without breaking the Statute of Secrecy. He lifted his hand to knock.
Draco nodded and backed out of the fireplace, ending the call. He immediately began to pace back and forth across the kitchen tiles. As he paced, his mind wandered and he found himself thinking about how long they’d been together. He’d been in this kitchen more times than he liked to count over the last six years, yet he still had his own flat elsewhere in London. He wondered if, perhaps, now was the time to discuss moving in together. He was sure that this wouldn’t have happened if they’d been living together.
“Yes, when I said surprise me I didn’t think you’d get me my favourite,” Draco said.
“Well,
Draco nodded as he took the cloak, pulling it around himself as he headed down the aisle without a backwards glance.
“No, no, it’s fine,” Harry replied, managing to sound coherent as Draco’s foot stroked its way further up his thigh. His muscles twitched with every stroke of Draco’s toe and he felt a blush creeping up his neck. “That bit was just a bit…
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand at the mention of roast beef. After hearing Harry’s tales of the legendary Weasley lunches, he was anticipating great things.
“That’s definitely what I mean,” Harry said, nodding. “Some of those were awful.”
Draco nodded. “Anyway. Shall we get started on the order for this week?”
Harry laughed. “Alright, where’s Hugo’s chair? It looks like dinner is just about ready.”
“I thought you could do with rescuing,” Ron said with a shrug. “I know you’ve probably had enough now, but for what it’s worth, anyone will be lucky to have you and if you want me to set you up with anyone, just let me know.”
Ron gave a low whistle, sticking his head back around the frame. “All this over a mug? Are you
“Yeah, why not?” Draco said thoughtfully. “I’ll give everything a quick sweep with the brush while you’re out and then when the delivery gets here, we’ll be able to get straight on with it all.”
“It smells delicious,” Arlo commented with a smile.
“It’s an amazing invention, that’s why,” Harry replied, glancing over at the potted plants that Draco was talking about. The flowers were always a bright white in the position they were in, but every so often, a customer would come in to buy one and the colour transformation was a sight. “Who wouldn’t want a plant that changes colour depending on the owner’s feelings?”
“Ahh, I see,” Hermione smiled. “Well, I’m sure you’ll make a comeback, Harry. Dinner’s at six, like usual. Now, I’d better get back. I’ve got an important meeting before I finish for the day. See you later.”
“Either is fine by me,” Draco said with a shrug, sipping his own coffee. “It’s not a massively long read so we should easily get it read in a couple of hours.”
Draco broke the kiss once more, pressing their foreheads together. “Harry, what are you doing to me? I don’t do things like this…”
“Trying to drown your sorrows in the shower?” Draco asked with a grin, handing one of the cups to Harry. Then he took a Danish from the bag and passed the other to Harry.
“I’ll just drop you off at the doorstep and go on my way,” Harry said firmly. “Come on.”
Harry laughed. “I can imagine, but I think that’s a clever idea. Especially if it means you can have a nice table rather than a folding one or something.”
“I’ve managed so far. We get along really well,” Harry said, a smile threatening to spill across his face. “I know that’s a surprise, given our history, but we’re definitely past all that now.”
“This is the lounge,” Draco said, gesturing for Harry to go into the room. “It’s not huge, but I like it well enough. And my sofa is the comfiest sofa I think I’ve ever sat on.”
“Well, yeah, I suppose so,” Harry said with a chuckle. “Luckily most people have changed their opinions.”
“Mother,” Draco started with a sigh as he sat down. “Do we have to do this now?”
“Thanks,” Charlie said. “I’ll trade you the cabbage.”
Harry groaned. “Do you think I’ll be in for an interrogation?”
“I think it probably did, but all of the people convicted with my father were given the harshest punishments,” Draco replied. “So they weren’t treated the same. He won’t really speak of his time in the prison, which I’m actually alright with. I’m not sure I want to hear details.”
“Told you it was comfy,” Draco said, having walked back into the room as Harry sat down. He grinned as he held out an opened bottle to Harry. “Do you want a glass for this?”
“Yeah, you’ll understand when I tell you what’s on my mind,” Harry replied, pulling the grill pan out and checking on the bacon and sausages.
Harry grinned as he caught Ginny’s eye. “We don’t do small portions in this house, Zabini.”
“No, it seems like this year has passed in a flash,” Draco replied, fixing the padlock to the gate. “It hasn’t been a bad year though.”
good to me,” Draco replied, sitting down himself. “Especially in your bed. It’s so comfortable.”
“Likewise,” Harry smiled. “What are we all drinking?”
“Well, I’d say that it’s all your fault,” Draco said one lunchtime as they sat behind the counter. They’d both eaten already and were now waiting for a customer. “You were the one who brought up springtime dried arrangements. Now it seems like that’s all we do.”
Harry laughed. “I suppose not, no. At least you managed to change it successfully, anyway. I remember Colin Creevey trying to change them and making it worse.”
Pansy nodded, making her way into the kitchen as Draco headed for the downstairs toilet.
“I’m glad I’m not the only one then,” Harry said with a chuckle. “I know this happens every year, but it always surprises me.”
Harry smiled and nodded. “Yeah, let’s get this date started.”
“She’ll be thrilled, I’m sure,” Harry replied, rolling his eyes. “I’ll Side-Along you to make sure. I do not want to have to explain to Hermione why you’ve splinched yourself.”
Harry smiled, taking one side of the display unit from Draco. “I’d love to. We could listen to the Christmas show that’s on the radio and have hot chocolate too.”
Pansy snorted softly. “What a strange way to treat your colleagues.”
Draco snorted. “
“A table is much easier, though,” Draco said, carrying the plates across to the table. He set Harry’s down in front of him before sitting down with his own. “Please feel free to use the napkin as a bib. I will be.”
“Indeed. I wouldn’t mind seeing more of them later if you get my meaning?” Draco replied, pulling Harry closer still.
“Well, it was easy when they gave us free rein,” Harry said with a shrug. “The only requirement they really had was the colours of the flowers we used.”
“No, sadly not. I keep killing poor defenceless spider plants,” Draco replied regretfully. “I think I am getting closer though. The last plant definitely took longer to wither.”
He turned and headed out to the Apparition point, already bracing himself for the journey.
Harry nodded, picking up the sign easily. “How have you done the voting cards?”
“We need to go through all the sales receipts for the past year and see what’s not selling,” Draco said to Harry as he returned from lunch on the first Saturday in March.
“Mum means well. She keeps saying similar to me,” Ginny replied. “At least, until recently.”
Draco rolled his eyes and took another bite of his sandwich.
“Yes, but they’re all wizarding folk,” Draco replied. “This whole row of houses are owned by wizards, so there’s no danger of upsetting anyone.”
someone.”
“With him?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow. “The marriage to Johnson on the rocks, is it?”
“This will be more enjoyable than the catalogue,” Draco replied matter-of-factly.
They fell silent for a few minutes as they continued to drink their coffee, listening to the soft crackling of the wood burner.
“Are they freshly made?” Harry asked, lifting his plate to eye level so that he could examine the sandwich.
“Well, we’ll still have to be a
Draco celebrated by punching the air before he turned his attention to what he could say. “Alright, I spy with my little eye something beginning with T.”
“I am not cancelling
“I didn’t say it was a bad thing,” Draco replied with a shrug. “It’s nice to have something to do on a daily basis. But it’s definitely your fault.”
“No, I know it’s not,” Draco replied. “But it’s not something I want for myself. I’m quite happy with my life as it is at the moment.”
Twenty minutes later, they were standing on the doorstep of The Burrow. Harry gripped Draco’s hand tightly. “Ready?”
“Well, if you say so,” Lucius sniffed. “I suppose you weren’t too late, as it happens.”
“Aren’t you?” Harry countered. “I’ve been thinking about the book ever since we were last here. On and off, I mean.”
“Definitely. Should we start this afternoon, do you think? We’ve got nothing else on,” Harry suggested.
Harry shook his head and turned back to the oven. “Don’t worry about it. Let me just get this started and then I’ll put the kettle on.”
“Oh, really? I’ll put it in the pile of stuff to be chucked out then, yeah?” Harry asked.
Harry stretched slightly, arching his back against the dining chair. “Yes, I think I could squeeze something in. What do you have in mind?”
“You sure? We could get it all done if we move quickly,” Harry said, turning to look at Draco.
Harry gave a groan. “If you really must. But like I told Hermione, make sure you vet them thoroughly first.”
Draco nodded. “Let’s get started then. I’ll do the floor, you sort the back room. I cleaned all the display units when I was watering.”
Draco shifted. “Yes… do you mind if I face you? I usually sleep on my left side, that’s all.”
“Right, I’ll see you back here in an hour,” Draco said, turning to Harry as they locked the security gate. “You don’t need to worry about dressing extra smart or anything. Dress for comfort, and probably best to grab something to eat before you leave.”
Harry laughed and headed for the door, Draco following him, extinguishing the lamps as he went. They stepped out into the chilly, dark air and turned to pull the door shut after them.
“Very well,” he said after a pause, taking Harry’s hand. “I’ll see you momentarily, Pansy.”
“Twenty, I think,” Draco said. “But we’ll double check tomorrow. They might have asked for extras, just in case anything happens.”
Draco laughed again, shaking his head. “In my defence, I didn’t really start making it until after we started working together, so although I
“Oh, we’re not doing it outside of work hours,” Draco said, horrified at the thought. “No, no. We’ll do it here in the quiet moments, like you say.”
“You look knackered, mate,” Ron said, looking at him critically.
Hermione raised one eyebrow at him as she began to cut a slice of pie.
“It is clear to me that the only way a message will get through to either of you is by giving you a detention,” Professor McGonagall said, still looking at them over the top of her glasses. “A detention where you will be required to work together.”
“It’s more fun with company,” Harry protested as he handed over his money.
Harry grinned back and opened his mouth to continue, but before he could speak, the door to the kitchen opened again and Charlie walked in. As everyone in the room began to greet him, he turned and pulled someone else into the room.
Harry smiled. “Alright, give me a second and I’ll see what I can come up with. Anything else?”
“Yes, please. I would love to have dinner with you,” Harry said with a grin. “Are we keeping it casual or will it be a formal occasion?”
“You’d be surprised. Some of those
“Are you still taking him on ‘fake’ dates?” Pansy asked, making air quotes around the word fake.
“I know, don’t worry,” Harry said, returning the smile. “It always sounds cliché, but I would happily do it all over again. “
Draco shook his head and straightened up again. “I don’t mind. I’ll ask them to set us up a tab so we can pay when we leave.”
Harry inhaled deeply and made his way to the Leaky Cauldron to use the Floo. He hadn’t imagined it would feel so strange to walk away from Draco on Christmas Eve.
“Oh. I suppose, yeah,” Harry said, frowning slightly. “I’ve never thought about it before. I usually have a roast at The Burrow.”
Harry laughed as the door swung shut. He stood up and began to clear away the remaining dried flowers, putting them back into their display vases. The centrepieces were all stored in a box with protective charms around them to ensure there was no damage caused and Harry carried the box into the back room to store it safely until the day it would be delivered.
“Alright, no problem,” Harry said, nodding. He was mopping the floor in front of the counter now, ushering Draco backwards so that he was behind the counter. “Could you really not go home to the Manor every week?”
As Harry began to sort through the boxes of returns, he could hear tuneless humming coming from the shop. Giving a soft huff of laughter, Harry shook his head and carried on.
Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything.
Draco shrugged one shoulder, a faint red blush colouring his cheeks. Although he was very proud of his creation, it embarrassed him to talk about it in such a way.
“Well I was walking backwards and pulling it after me and then I bumped into the freestanding shelving unit,” Harry said, wrapping his cloak around himself. “The Peace Lilies on the top shelf were a bit close to the edge and, well, I’m sure you can work the rest out.”
Harry kicked him under the table. “Oh, well, maybe,” he said, turning back to Tim. “Cheers,” he added, lifting his glass and clinking it against the other three.
“He’s a Muggle-born wizard, seeing as the shop is on Diagon Alley and Muggles can’t usually get there,” Harry said thoughtfully. “And he played Quidditch as a hobby. I think that should cover everything they might ask?”
Harry laughed again and gave Draco a light squeeze. “If it helps, they still don’t know it’s you that will be turning up.”
Hary sighed and pulled a chair as close to the bed as he dared. “I’m staying here for the afternoon. Can you let Robards know?”
Draco groaned and closed his eyes. “Don’t say things like that. I
“Just now. Mum filled us in,” Charlie replied, stepping into the room now, followed by Arlo. “We thought we’d come and see if you needed rescuing, but apparently not!”
“He never really seemed to like being a teacher,” Harry said. “Even when it came to you Slytherins, he didn’t seem to actually want to be at Hogwarts sometimes.”
Harry nodded and opened his eyes, gasping as he took in their surroundings. “Venice?”
Draco grinned and headed off down the corridor.
Ron nodded. “Yeah, go on. If you stay, you’ll only distract me with your constant talking about him.”
Harry tilted his head slightly before shrugging. “I hadn’t really thought about it,” he said apologetically. “I honestly didn’t think that they’d go on about my love life for so long. I thought they’d lose interest after a few weeks, but they seemed to get even more determined. And now we’ve started this, unless I talk about ‘Adam’ every time I see one of them, they’re apparently going to think that it’s fizzled out and I need setting up again.”
, but he was one of those people who are
Harry grabbed the sweeping brush and moved around the counter onto the shop floor. He swept from the door back to the counter, making sure to get all of the fallen leaves from under the display units. He deftly swept them onto the dustpan before depositing them in the bin. He moved to get the mop and bucket from the backroom, filling the bucket with water and squirting some disinfectant into it.
Draco grinned as he gazed up at the ceiling. “Mission accomplished,” he whispered.
“It feels like forever since we’ve been here,” Harry said with a sigh as they walked up the steps that led to the entrance. “Don’t you think?”
further up his leg. He had a sudden realisation of what could be causing the tickle and he dared to glance over the top of his menu at Draco, who was studying his own menu. Frowning, Harry turned his gaze down again. Then he gasped out loud.
“Excellent. I’ll only be a minute,” Alice replied, still smiling as she pulled the door open and disappeared through it.
“Maybe,” Harry shrugged, making a face at Hugo and grinning as the little boy giggled at him. “I don’t know. I haven’t thought that far ahead.”
On Monday morning, as Draco was giving the shop floor a quick sweep to get rid of any petals and leaves that had fallen over the weekend, the door swung open forcefully and Harry stomped into the shop. Draco looked up in surprise as the door slammed shut again.
Harry snorted. “No, no. But, Draco… her cousin is only twenty! I just… what could I possibly have in common with him?”
“Maybe. So… did we just have our first official date?” Harry asked.
“With Malfoy, I assume?” Charlie asked, as Arlo got up to leave the room, placing a hand on his shoulder.
Harry smiled to himself as he took a drink from his glass of wine.
“Sounds delightful. I like that pub,” Draco said, still smiling as he lifted his mug to take a sip of his coffee.
?” Draco countered. “Her family has bought bouquets from us for as long as we’ve been open.”
Harry obliged and stepped inside, slipping past Draco until he was standing in the hallway. He looked around surreptitiously. “This is nice.”
He thought back to when his mother had first opened the shop. There had been a few mornings when they’d come to open up and found the glass in the door or the window smashed. People were not so quick to forget what his family had done during the war, it seemed. Thankfully those mornings were a thing of the past now, and had been for a long time. Harry joining the team had been something of a surprise to everyone and had certainly helped. Even before that, though, people had come to accept that neither Draco nor Narcissa were of the same mindset as Lucius. The business had grown steadily since. Narcissa had been a passionate gardener behind the closed doors of Malfoy Manor for as long as Draco could remember. Seeing her so happy in the florist’s made him happy too. In fact, he couldn’t imagine doing anything else with his life now.
He stood up and strode over to the fireplace. He lifted the tin of Floo powder off the mantelpiece and took a pinch before returning the tin to it’s spot. He threw the powder into the flames and hoped Pansy was available for a call.
. And now, here he was at the Ministry’s official fundraising ball, about to take to the dance floor with Potter.
“Yes, well done,” Harry laughed. “Alright, your go.”
“Where is the table?” Harry asked, looking around as he took the plate from Draco.
“Of course we can. We’re getting good at these now,” Harry replied.
Draco shook his head, his hair brushing against Harry’s cheek. “No.”
“Oh. Well that’s alright then,” Draco said with a pleased smile. “How is she?”
Harry nodded. “Yeah. They’re not bad, are they?”
Harry clapped his hands. “Yes. Right. Do you want to do the floor today or should I?”
Harry smiled. “I like that. It’s nice and different. Can’t get many presents under it though.”
Draco nodded, accepting his cloak when Harry held it out to him.
Draco shook his head again. “No, don’t worry about anything like that. I’m sure I’ll have some wine or something in the house that we can drink. Just bring yourself.”
Draco nodded again. “It’s been by my bedside all through Hogwarts,” he admitted. “Under a charm so no-one could see it, but it was there.”
Pansy shook her head, dark hair swishing about her face. “If you say so.”
“Oh yeah? How? Because I tried all sorts and Mum wouldn’t leave me alone. I had to move to Romania,” Charlie said, looking impressed.
to stop after three chapters if we don’t want to, you know.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Everywhere?”
“It is nice to have someone worry about me, in a way, but I’m just… I’m not used to being the sole focus of one person, never mind a whole group of them,” Harry replied. “It gets tiring. So when Draco offered, I jumped at the chance.”
“Not right now,” Draco said, shaking his head. “Maybe later. This cake is far too good to waste time talking about things I remember.”
Molly was on her feet, staring down at her plate in shock and as Harry looked over, he could see why. In the middle of her pie was a live baby chicken, chirping away happily.
“There, what do you think?” Harry asked, stepping back so that Draco could see what he’d done.
Draco nodded. “I’m quite looking forward to it, I have to admit. Not that I have anything planned for Christmas. I’ll probably spend the morning with my parents.”
“You can’t help who you fall for, Draco. I have to say, it seemed inevitable,” Pansy said with a smile. “Is it so bad?”
A few moments passed and then the door was flung open. “Draco!” Pansy exclaimed, swooping forward and kissing him on the cheek. “Come in, come in, it’s getting cold.”
“I know, but it’s a bit different meeting them as your boyfriend to how it is when I’m serving them in the shop,” Draco replied. “That’s my territory. This is theirs.”
“Good,” Draco said, glancing at Harry out of the corner of his eye as he went back to his own box, pressing a soft kiss to the head of Babbitty Rabbitty as he did so.
“Yes. I thought one of us could do them while the other moves the displays,” Draco replied, averting his gaze slightly. “I’ll start on the orders. We can swap at lunchtime.”
Draco shook his head. “No, none for tomorrow. We can’t really do the ones for Wednesday because they won’t look their best by the time they’re collected.”
Sitting down, he knew he should look over the paperwork for the next surveillance mission, but he just couldn’t face it tonight. He just wanted to eat his sandwich and go to bed. So that’s what he did. He stood up as he popped the last of his sandwich into his mouth, heading back into the kitchen to refill his glass before going upstairs and getting into bed.
“She’ll just be biding her time, you mark my words,” Ginny replied darkly. “She’ll mention him one day, completely out of the blue and you’ll be forced to bring him to dinner.”
Harry shook his head. “No, she seemed so excited that I might like this man that I didn’t have the heart to.”
good,” Pansy admitted reluctantly. “I enjoyed it last time you made it for me.”
Draco stepped out his front door not even half an hour after he’d arrived home. He felt grateful for the many years of quick showers at Hogwarts as it seemed to be a skill that, once acquired, was not easily forgotten. Buttoning his cloak up as he walked, he headed for Pansy’s place, wondering idly what Theo was making for dinner.
“I know. I think that’s why Mum worries about you.” Ron admitted. “She was worried Charlie would never settle down and that he’d be a permanent bachelor.”
Harry snorted. “Thanks very much. And no, for your information, I didn’t call it a tune. I was just humming, if that’s alright?”
“No, I don’t suppose you could have. For what it’s worth, I’m flattered that you wanted me to be your
“I’d prefer you not to bid on any men, actually!” Harry exclaimed. “I don’t see why we can’t just do a bake sale. Nice and safe, no worries about anyone bidding on anyone they shouldn’t…”
“I don’t know what to do now,” Harry said, looking at Draco as they sat behind the counter. “I feel like I should be doing something.”
Draco waved a hand at him without lifting his head from the magazine he was studying.
Harry laughed again, glad that he and ‘Adam’ were no longer at the front of everyone’s thoughts.
through it,” Draco nodded. “I’m glad it didn’t end up like that. I don’t think I could have handled an unhappy ending.”
Draco leaned over and nodded. “Looks like it. Put them to one side and we’ll sort that when we’re done checking the rest.”
“Do you trust him?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Ginny said, waving a hand. “You could have been a pro if you hadn’t joined the Aurors, you know that.”
“Can’t we get ribbon with diamonds on it? Or at least little sparkly bits?” Harry asked, straightening up, a frown on his face.
“Maybe,” Harry agreed, nodding. “I don’t know though. I don’t know if I can see myself with a woman forever.”
“Not on your life,” Harry said with a laugh. “You’re not the only stubborn one, you know.”
“He wasn’t too bad, really,” Draco said thoughtfully. “He wasn’t particularly… friendly. But he was always fair with us when it came to house matters. We could go to him with problems, although he did prefer it if we went to a prefect first.”
“I’ll do that, don’t worry. Tea or coffee?” Charlie said, walking across the kitchen and picking up the kettle so he could fill it with water.
“Looks like it, yeah,” Harry replied as he turned. “You decorated the box?”
“Oh, like you could do any better,” Pansy tutted.
“This is certainly a reminder of
Ron followed, listening as Harry explained what each flower was called and what they smell like. Then he picked out several on Harry’s recommendation to make up the bouquet.
Harry grinned. “Go on then.”
“Surely it can’t have been that good,” Lucius snorted. “Just pick something else.”
Draco raised a hand awkwardly in greeting as the faces of Hermione, Ron, George and Ginny turned to them.
Draco laughed. “Did the book help put things into perspective, though? It’s pretty evident that marriage isn’t the be all and end all of life.”
“I’m still annoyed by it,” Pansy said with a sniff. “And I don’t like being reminded of it. I know I’ve changed my way of thinking, but I don’t think that going back there would help at all.”
you and Malfoy were kissing then? Or am I supposed to guess?”
“Is there a problem with you liking him?” Charlie asked, wrapping both hands around his mug as he listened to Harry.
“Witch. Where’s Theo? Chained to the kitchen?” Draco asked, shrugging his cloak off and hanging it on the coat stand.
Harry blinked as he looked back at Draco. “Really?”
“Yes, Professor,” Harry muttered, bowing his head.
“Ye–no! Don’t you dare,” Draco said, leaping across the room to snatch the toy out of Harry’s hand.
“I can see why you like it so much,” Harry smiled as Draco led them down one of the aisles towards the rear of the shop. “So what is your plan for tonight?”
Harry swallowed. “I, er, I need to tell you something. Before I lose my nerve.”
“Alright, come on then,” Draco said with a smile of his own. He took Harry by the hand and led him from the lounge to the bedroom.
“Did you really think I’d be okay with you bidding on a random man?”
Pansy sat up straighter. “You fancy him!”
“Alright, well that’s a start. Anything you don’t really need anymore can go up to the third floor. I’ve got one room up there that’s a glorified storage cupboard,” Harry replied.
“Are you seriously asking that? The Boy Who Lived going out for a meal with an ex-Death Eater?” Draco asked incredulously. “Can you honestly not see what they would be curious about?”
Harry snorted. “Good point,” he said, lifting his cup to take a drink. “But this coffee makes your sacrifice worth it.”
That evening, Harry sat down beside Ron as usual and leaned over to make a face at Hugo who was, once again, on his father’s lap.
“My friends haven’t been setting me up on dates,” Harry said. “Not since… well, months ago, actually.”
Draco chuckled. “We don’t
“I’ve taught Draco how to play ‘I Spy’,” Harry said. “I think I’ve made a mistake.”
At six o’clock that night, Harry was waiting outside Paperwhite’s when Draco got there. “You’re early.”
“Fair enough,” Draco said, nodding. “Alright, food might be a good idea next time. We’ll work it out when it happens.”
Harry laughed. “Go. Don’t worry.”
“It’s spaghetti. Hardly the tidiest food to eat,” Draco replied, shrugging. “I have trouble with it so I can’t imagine you’re any better.”
“Oh. So you’re still sticking with that, are you?” Pansy asked with a sigh, sitting forward.
Harry laughed and leant closer, pressing his lips to Draco’s in a soft kiss. He smiled as Draco kissed back.
Molly smiled and ushered them inside, closing the door behind them before disappearing into the kitchen.
The rest of the morning passed quickly with the present exchange taking place and then lunch being served and by the time mid-afternoon came, Harry was full and feeling pleasantly sleepy. At around four o’clock, after the third round of Charades, Ginny got up and announced that she was going to see Blaise now and Harry felt instantly more awake.
He gave the parchment a quick read through as he waited in the line.
Draco snorted as he picked up the sweeping brush to give the floor a quick once over before he could mop. “Not this year. You?”
Ginny laughed. “Your secret is safe. Better make this a self-inking quill though.”
“Even when you were a child?” Harry asked, tucking one leg underneath himself.
Draco nodded this time. “He does. He… wasn’t too happy about that, but ultimately, Mother reminded him that it has nothing to do with him and that you’re a good worker.”
would be the problem,” Draco said. “Although the fact you were so hung up on his age probably didn’t help.”
“That’s because we haven’t,” Pansy replied. “You’ve been too busy at work. So this is long overdue.”
“No, because if you bring the cake back now, I’ll want to eat it now,” Harry replied with a grin. “You can get the cake when we’ve read a chapter though.”
“No, exactly. I do, however, fancy a cake today,” Draco said, turning his attention to the glass-fronted counter. “That chocolate cake looks divine, don’t you think?”
“Ginny said she’s only just told Mr and Mrs Weasley, so maybe they’ve been keeping it quiet on purpose?” Harry suggested, glancing over at Draco. “Our reactions are probably mild compared to some people’s.”
“Exactly. Right, get your cloak off and get comfortable. I’ll go and get the books, then we can get coffee and sandwiches,” Draco said, shrugging his own cloak off as he spoke.
“No, me neither. I’ve had too many unhappy endings in the past. You know, reading that story really reminded me of us,” Harry said. “I mean, I know it’s nothing like our situation, but there were definitely similarities.”
Draco smiled and turned to kiss Harry. “You said that already.”
Hermione gave a little gasp at the same time as Charlie said “Mum.”
“Oh, yeah good point,” Harry said, wrinkling his nose. “Didn’t think of that.”
Draco laughed. “Come on then. Or we’ll miss the show.”
“I was thinking the same,” Harry nodded. “By the way, do we need to refresh that hanging display? It doesn’t seem to have held up as well as normal.”
Harry looked around as they made their way along the central aisle. Away from the noise of the café, the sounds of soft jazz music could be heard. Either side of the aisle were high bookshelves of dark wood and everywhere Harry looked, there were plush sofas and armchairs covered in soft-looking green leather and low tables. Occasionally he caught sight of a wood burner at the end of an aisle, fire crackling away comfortingly. “Wow,” he breathed.
“Harry Potter. I’ve heard your story,” Arlo replied, shaking Harry’s hand firmly. “You accomplished a great deal.”
“So rude,” Draco shook his head. “Remind me why people thought you were the good one, again?”
“Well, to be fair, we didn’t set out with that in mind,” Harry replied, feeling his cheeks turn pink. “We only wanted to get Hermione out of the toilets and back to the common room. We were just a bit late getting there.”
“I’ve got a nice bottle in my fridge,” Draco mused. “Do we have time to call at my place to get it?”
“You do know this is ridiculous, don’t you?” Harry demanded, his hands on his hips as he stared down at Draco.
The next few moments were silent as they all continued to study their menus. Eventually, they had all decided on what they wanted to eat and the server appeared to take their order. Harry’s thigh, disappointingly, remained untickled and he wondered if Draco had had his fun.
Hermione nodded. “Of course. I need to go back anyway. Will you be okay?”
“That’s fair enough. I’m not a huge fan of Christmas pudding either,” Harry admitted. “The fruit is too chewy for my liking.”
“Here we go,” Draco said, presenting Harry with a copy of the book he’d chosen. “What do you think?”
“Have you got any plans tonight?” Draco asked with a smirk as they picked up their sweeping brushes.
“I’ll let you auction me off if we can make a compromise. Every man we auction has to also bake a cake,” Harry replied quietly. “So people are bidding on both things.”
“Your secret is safe with me, don’t worry,” Harry said with a grin.
“Leftovers from the shop,” Harry admitted with a grin. “Your other present is under the tree.”
Harry kept hold of one of Draco’s hands and led him from the room and upstairs.
Any attempt at talking about something other than work was neatly brushed aside as quickly as Draco could manage it, but it didn’t stop Harry from trying. Occasionally he thought he saw a momentary lapse from the other man, but it was hard to tell because Draco was so adept at hiding his true feelings. By mid-December, they were so busy making up centrepieces and Christmas orders that there wasn’t really any room for conversation and so Harry was spared the disappointment of Draco ignoring his attempts to talk any longer.
Harry shook his head. “Surprise me. I’ll make myself comfortable here.”
Draco laughed. “Don’t worry about it, Theo. I know you’re a dedicated chef. What are we having?”
Harry laughed quietly. “I can understand why. A book club sounds interesting. Do you have a book in mind?”
“No. While we’re on, maybe we should do some Halloween-themed ones too?” Harry asked, sliding off his stool.
“Seeing Blaise Zabini, apparently,” Harry said.
started, might I remind you,” Draco hissed back, finally turning his head to glare at Harry. “All because I said I didn’t think you should put your name forward for that overseas mission.”
“We’ll be done before we know it,” Draco smiled.
“Yeah, I like that it’s a bit out of the way,” Draco replied with a smile. “More privacy is always a good thing.”
Harry shook his head and picked up his fork again. “So, you know how… your mum and everyone keeps trying to set me up with people they think I’ll like?”
Harry nodded. “Got it. At least it’s started raining. We shouldn’t get too many interruptions.”
“Helping Harry out,” Pansy repeated slowly, before shaking her head, her sleek brown hair swishing around her face. “No, that doesn’t add up. Tell me the truth.”
I don’t go out very often,” Draco said with a snort. “Anyway, are you staying tonight?”
“Is it really?” Draco asked, feigning ignorance. “I… was not aware of that.”
Harry swallowed and tightened his grip on the key. While it wasn’t as bad as Apparating, he couldn’t say that travelling by Portkey was a favourite of his.
“Understandable,” Hermione said, biting her lip briefly. “I’ll come back in an hour or so, whether or not I know anything more.”
“When we have guests, yes. Appearances are important, Draco,” Pansy said, standing up. “Come along, or it’ll get cold.”
Harry laughed and turned to Hermione, holding out one of the bunches of flowers. “Merry Christmas.”
“I sometimes still can’t believe it, you know,” Draco mused. “Who would have guessed that this is what would become of the Malfoys?”
“Of course, I do,” Draco said, the corner of his mouth twitching into a smile. “Well, Blaise, anyway.”
Harry grinned. “Good thinking. They’re just the right size too.”
Draco kissed back, wrapping one leg around Harry’s as he did so. “Believe me, so have I,” he replied, his breath coming in short gasps.
Harry smiled as he hung their cloaks in the cupboard. “She’ll be thrilled that you think so. Did you really enjoy it?”
“Thank you,” Draco replied gratefully, taking the vial from her. “I appreciate you taking time out of your work to bring it over.”
A slow grin appeared on Harry’s face as he took Draco’s hand and sat up. “That sounds good to me, lead the way.”
“Draco?” Harry asked, the corner of his mouth twitching.
he’s worth it?”
When he stepped back into the shop, it was just in time to see Draco walk back through the door with two cups of coffee in his hands. “That was quick!”
“Well. It would still be nice to be
“You’re telling me. I still remember Fred challenging me to a flying competition after Sunday lunch once. Mum was
“Sounds good to me,” Harry said, taking the bottle of tonic water and handing it to Tim with a smile, followed by the glass.
“What?” Ron said, the look on his face immediately turning to one of concern. “What do you mean?”
“All I want is your permission to say ‘I told you so’ if things change,” Pansy said with a sniff.
“Yep,” Ron replied with a grin. “He can’t get enough. It takes its toll on us after a while though.”
“Why, though?” Harry asked. “Why do I
we’ll manage to have a conversation about it.”
“No, good point. We could play ‘I Spy’,” Harry said, looking across at Draco again.
“Here you are, darling,” Pansy said as she came back into the room again, a large glass in one hand. “Dinner will be ten minutes. Theo says hello, but he can’t possibly come out to say it in person as the potatoes will burn.”
“Lunch is ready!” Molly announced, sticking her head around the door.
“Man,” Harry said, the blush on his face returning anew. “I know that much. Name is Conor, or something.”
Ron laughed. “Of course. Like I would set you up with anyone who wasn’t right for you.”
“Not the same as he was,” Draco said quietly. “I mean, in a way that’s good. Less of the inclination to follow insane maniacs. But he’s not even… we can’t have proper conversations anymore. The time he spent in Azkaban has certainly taken its toll on him.”
Molly shook her head. “No, he and Arlo couldn’t make it this week. Something about a very delicate dragon mating going wrong. I dread to think. Ginny is here though, along with her new boyfriend.”
“Oh yeah?” Harry asked through his mouthful of treacle tart. “Mm, this is amazing, by the way.”
were terrified? How do you think I felt, trying to distract it from Hermione?” Harry snorted.
“Can we do Halloween-themed? Are they not just Autumnal?” Draco asked, tilting his head slightly.
Harry grinned. “That was kind of the idea. Although I suppose working together has the added bonus of not being able to forget me…”
Draco glanced up at the clock above them. “Ah, you’re right. We haven’t got long, so let’s just do a quick sweep around tonight. We can mop in the morning if we need to.”
“Don’t worry about it,” Harry said, waving his hand. “I know it wasn’t exactly a run of the mill thing.”
“Because we have to do so many things before we can open up,” Draco replied with a shrug. “At least we don’t change the hanging display every week.”
Ginny shook her head.
“Yeah, why not,” Harry said, stretching. “It’ll give us something to do. Are you going for them?”
“You see. Your words backfire,” Draco said smugly.
Harry did the same, letting the subject drop for now and they ate quietly for the next few minutes.
Draco shook his head. “No, I can’t think of anything. Just having coffee and sitting with you will be good enough, then we can take it back to your place.”
he thought.
“Sounds like fun,” Draco replied, picking up his overcoat.
“You haven’t got anybody pregnant, have you?” Charlie asked immediately.
“Same here. I just can’t seem to say no when someone tells me they want to arrange a date for me,” Harry sighed. “Hence why I’m here with you, discussing a book about the ways of pure-blood wizards.”
Harry laughed. “I bet he was thrilled about that.”
“Fair enough. We need to change the hanging display unit over,” Harry said, sliding out of Draco’s way and moving into the back room of the shop. “No need for hearts everywhere now.”
Finally, Harry rolled off Draco, breathing hard as he collapsed next to him on the bed. “Well,” he panted. “Was it worth it?”
Draco nodded, taking a deep breath. “I’m ready. Let them do their worst.”
“It occurred to me that some of the conventional plant foods need to be administered more often and that people probably forget,” Draco said, picking up a bottle of plant food from the store they kept. “See, this one says it should be used every time you water the plant, or if you use a little bit more, every two weeks. So I thought it might be useful if I could come up with something that could be used less often but still have the same benefits.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry nodded. “Why wouldn’t it be?”
Harry rolled his eyes and headed out of the door.
“Much nicer,” he responded. “Are you enjoying your evening?”
, breathing a sigh of relief to find his mother to be the only human in the house.
“Goodbye, Mother!” Draco said, practically fleeing to the front door and apparating to the first place that entered his mind.
Harry smiled. “Thank you. I had the kurta made for the occasion but the dupatta,” he stopped, nodding at the shawl draped over his shoulder, “was my father’s. I found it when we moved into the estate.”
Draco cleared his throat and bowed in return. “Yes, thank you for joining us. Are we still expecting Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Granger-Weasley?”
Her eyes brightened and she shook her head. “No, I have no questions.”
He leaned back in his chair. “I will try, but I make no promises.”
“A plan?” Harry asked, leaning back in surprise. And then he laughed humorlessly. “Of course there was a plan. Of course. And I was just… a pawn in a game to manipulate the Wizarding World into forgetting the evil your family has done.”
“And, Gods forbid, if something did happen to you before Teddy came of age, he could be adopted by both his godfather and his benefactor and we could raise him together.”
. Draco returned the letter to his pocket and knocked on the door.
Potter opened his eyes and frowned. “Right. Of course.”
They reached a clearing a few moments later. The sun had set, but there was still enough light to see the tomb before them. There were two rows of boulders nestled closely together, with five, chest-level stones in each line. Bridging the rows were thin slabs of rock perched upon each pair of boulders, and at the front stood one final stone with a pointed peak.
“As do you,” she replied. “My son looks even more handsome than usual.” Draco chuckled and then heard a commotion downstairs that indicated that their guests had arrived. He extended his arm to escort Mrs. Malfoy to the parlor.
By the end of the evening, he had not spent a single moment alone with Miss Astoria and was on edge from her mother’s constant meddling. When he and Mrs. Malfoy finally said goodbye and Apparated home, he let out a cry of frustration.
He gasped when he saw the familiar handwriting and looked at the open door to make sure his mother was not nearby. In his haste to open the letter, he accidentally tore the page, and he cast a very careful
“And what are your passions?”
“Oh, Draco. I cannot believe Harry Potter will be having dinner in our home! You really have made excellent progress already.”
They stayed there for several minutes, and Draco realized that it was all together… pleasant. If he pulled Teddy a bit closer to cuddle against him, well certainly no one would notice.
“Uncle Harry!” Teddy exclaimed and left Draco’s side to run and greet him. Potter knelt down and embraced him tightly. “Happy birthday.”
Draco lit the candelabra by his bed and looked at the book resting upon the side table. Whenever he would feel particularly maudlin, which was more often than he would admit to anyone, he would open their book and read all of the things they had said to each other. It would both comfort him and make him sadder, the paradox of memories of lost love.
He shook his head. “I am not.”
The upstairs quarters fared no better. There was the hallway, where he had heard all manner of cries and screams in the months that the Dark Lord resided there. There was his bedroom, where his mother had held him as he had trembled from the Dark Lord’s hexes. There was the balcony, where he had seen his father—
“Good evening,” he said, “We are honoured to have you here. We have come together tonight to raise funds in order to promote unity within our society: unity between houses at Hogwarts, and unity between all magical beings. We added a bit of competition because we know that Hogwarts graduates enjoy friendly games, but I hope that this exercise encourages all of us to think of the world around us from the viewpoint of other people, especially those less fortunate than us.
“Is this new as well?” Harry asked, his face alight with wonder as he looked around the forest.
“I heard it was someone’s birthday,” Draco replied, trying to keep his lips from twitching upward. But it was difficult when he was here, completely alone with Harry Potter, looking so gorgeously sinful in the soft light of the candelabra.
“That is up to you. If the pain I have caused you is too much to overcome or if you have moved on since we parted, please say so and I will make my leave.” He paused to allow Harry to respond, but he continued to look at Draco expectantly. “If that is not the case, I told you our first night here that I was yours. I meant it then,” he said, “and I mean it now.”
, he was already dizzy from their kisses, from just their bodies pressed together. How would he make it through a whole evening?
The rest of dinner continued much the same way, with Mrs. Greengrass speaking thrice as much as anyone else and at a louder and louder volume with each glass of wine she consumed. She then demanded that Draco and Miss Astoria perform a singing duet when they retired to the parlour. Draco took a deep breath, wanting nothing more than to leave this charade and return to his quiet home to pine for Harry Potter in peace. He plastered the best smile he could and offered to play the
Potter gave a sheepish grin. “Yes.” They had both changed out of their flying robes, though Potter was now wearing a muggle tailcoat. He tossed up the tails before sitting down.
“Excellent work,” she replied with a doting smile. Mrs. Malfoy had a thick portfolio in her arms. She laid it upon the table, and spelled its contents to spill forth in neat piles. When each stack was finished, their names appeared and a silver ribbon tied them into a package. She then took a turn around the room, her eyes measuring its capability. He could see her vision formulating as she completed her turn.
When she closed the door, he heard Mrs. Potter shout, “handsome, no?” to Mrs. Granger-Weasley, and he grinned despite himself.
“No,” Potter replied. “My godson is Teddy Lupin.”
As soon as he held her against him, the top of her head resting under his chin, he felt her shake with sobs. “Mama,” he said again, his voice cracking as tears threaten to spill down his own cheeks. He held her like that for so long that he lost track of the time, bringing her as much comfort as he could while she cried uncontrollably in his arms, working through years of fear and worry and the loss of her husband.
“Do you remember Miss Luna Lovegood from school?”
“I beg your pardon?”
Weasley made another move. Draco could already see that this would be a tight match.
“Mrs. Figg lived nearby. She offered to let me stay with her when I was six while the Dursleys took a small trip. She said she needed help with keeping her house and could use an extra pair of hands. When I arrived, a bath had been drawn for me and there were clean clothes waiting for me. I asked if I was too dirty to work in her house. She smiled and told me that I would not be working after all.
Teddy giggled. “That was Bitty. He is always scared.”
“Likewise,” Draco said with a bow.
He returned her smile, and felt the pinprick of tears at the corners of his eyes. “I am proud of you too, for learning, for trying to do the right thing.”
Her question wrenched a sob from his chest, ugly and loud, and suddenly, all he could think of was the look of anger on Harry’s face in the forest. He heard her whisper, “oh, dear,” and then she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him close, his head falling to her chest. She held him as he continued to cry, and her fingers, light and cool, brushed his temple and combed through his hair.
After dessert, the group moved to the parlour for games. The elves had prepared two card tables in the center of the room, however Weasley’s eyes fell on a wizard chess board tucked into the corner. Mrs. Malfoy noticed and gave Draco a suggestive look.
Harry Potter
“Ah,” Harry replied softly, looking down at their entwined hands. “I’ve already gotten so used to having you near.” He took a step forward and pressed their foreheads together. “I will miss you.”
“Thank you, mama,” he replied, sitting down next to her. He was gathering himself food when the
“Good day! Welcome to the Burrow. If you have a gift for Mr. Potter, you can add it over there.” She pointed to a table already filled with presents.
Potter laughed again and grabbed his shoulder. “It is still very fun to tease you, even if we are making amends.” He was standing so close and his eyes were so green that Draco momentarily forgot to breathe.
Draco saw that Mrs. Malfoy was about to interrupt Miss Lovegood’s very awkward attempt at flirting, and so he grabbed her arm. “Mother, may I take a moment of your time?”
oversee. We have hardly had an amicable relationship before this point.”
“Like this?” Harry asked after slicking himself up, one hand gripping behind Draco’s knee while the other guided his length to his entrance.
“There is a sense of… conflict to your aura. May I suggest the Witch’s Brew? It cures many common aura ailments.”
“And Mr. Weasley’s?” Draco replied, looking around.
Mrs. Granger-Weasley gave an exasperated smile. “Aditi, may I present to you Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Malfoy, this is Aditi Potter, Mr. Potter’s grandmother.”
“Of course. It should be published in the coming months, and I will ensure that you have a copy.”
Potter laughed. “It’s a tiptop broom, isn’t it?”
As expected, they received a formal dinner invitation from the Greengrasses for the following Friday. Draco felt slightly more at ease about accepting it since his run-in with Miss Astoria; she had seemed to provide stimulating conversation and had been at least thrice as agreeable as her sister had been in school. Still, he knew that both his mother and Mrs. Greengrass would be vying for a match with one of the sisters. In theory, Draco could see that it would be an advantageous betrothal: while the Greengrasses were purebloods, they had taken no sides during the war, saving their family from Azkaban and asset seizure. Their wealth still did not compare to the Malfoys’ post-war, but half of the families in the Sacred Eight and Twenty were now tarnished, and the Greengrasses had managed to escape that. In addition, Mr. Greengrass’s elevated position in the Ministry could prove useful for the Malfoys’ future.
“Oh?”
“It was necessary. I should have done so long ago.”
“Merlin’s beard, Mother, that was the most insufferable social engagement I have ever attended, and we housed Azkaban-crazed Death Eaters in our home for a year.”
“Oh, that is splendid! And things are well between you and Mr. Potter?”
She nodded. “Yes. I do not have much patience for divination, and Mrs. Joylove tries too assertively to read one’s leaves whether one wants her to or not. I would rather just not know, thank you.”
“Mother—”
Harry laughed, and then he leaned in and kissed Draco so fiercely that he conveniently forgot all about Mr. Weasley for the rest of the evening.
Draco was not sure how long he had been lost in his own mind, so he cleared his throat and plastered on a smile. He shuffled those nasty thoughts into the corner of his mind, shuttering them out with Occlumency; he was not going to let anything ruin tonight. “Right. Your present.” He stepped forward and handed it to him.
so that he could see the empty salon before him. Stepping inside, he thought of the moment when he had given Harry his present in this room, when they had kissed and held each other before making their way upstairs to be together for the first time. He had known then that their time would be fleeting, and while he regretted hurting Harry, he could never regret the small amount of time they did share together.
Draco grinned and rested his gloved hand against his chest, feeling pearls and fabric beneath his fingers. “This ensemble is beautiful.”
Bon chance aujourd'hui.
Was he now worthy of Harry’s affection and time and, most importantly, forgiveness?
Draco could not see how that would be a ringing endorsement for his skill level, but his mother was looking at him expectantly. “I enjoy the game as well,” he said. “Would you care to join me?” He had more than earned an Order of Merlin, First Class, for his amiable and upstanding performance tonight.
He spent the morning with his mother, and then apparated to the Burrow in the afternoon. When he arrived, his eyes fell on a crooked, leaning tower of a home, which looked susceptible to a tumble by a stiff breeze or even a meager shove. There were tents outside, striped white and green, with tables and chairs lined beneath them. Children ran about the grassy field next to the house, laughter filling the air as they chased each other. There were at least 30 people milling about, many of whom Draco recognized, but some he did not. There was a circle of Weasley siblings to his left and Kingsley Shacklebolt was in deep conversation Neville Longbottom further down the field. Draco’s hands fidgeted nervously at his side as he realized that Potter might be the only person there who did not hate him, and since Potter was the reason for today’s fête, it would be a very lonely day indeed.
“Yes, he is here to see Harry.”
“My mama always told me that Nimue — the Lady of the Lake — and Merlin were lovers. They lived here in the Forest of Brocéliande, and after a long life together, Nimue buried him close to the lake where her spirit resides.”
“Cousin Draco!”
They were standing at the clearing line, at least 100 feet away from the stones. Harry closed his eyes for a moment before opening them again. “I can feel its power from here,” he said. Then he laughed. “Would it be disrespectful to exclaim ‘Merlin’ at his own tomb?”
Potter interrupted his thoughts. “What about you? Your passions?”
Quelter floated the chess board onto the second card table and poured glasses of wine and brandy for their group. Draco heard Mrs. Granger-Weasley suggest a game of Loo and smirked. His mother was quite good in that game, and Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley were in for a massacre.
“When do you have to leave?” Draco asked.
“In Brittany.”
“Oh.” Draco knew that his cousin, Nymphadora, had died at the Battle of Hogwarts, but he had only met his Aunt Andromeda once and never had a relationship with Nymphadora. He had forgotten that she had had a son with Remus Lupin before their death. “I see.”
for when the invitations are dispersed. Who should I list if the paper would like a statement? Mr. Potter?”
And Mr. Draco Malfoy, pureblood wizard whose reputation had certainly been slandered by The War (and perhaps even by his own actions in said war), had a plan. It read as follows:
“Let me guess,” Draco drawled. “That is Mrs. Granger-Weasley’s desk. And this is yours.”
“Oh, yes. It is quite large. I was shocked when the solicitor told me how big the estate actually is. Ron’s jaw practically fell to the floor.”
“Oh, Malfoy.” He sounded pained. “I am so very so—”
“Malfoy!” Potter yelled above him, but Draco was too focused on trying to rein in his broom to look up. The broom would not budge from its descent.
While it was no wonder why a young boy would be so tired after a long day, Draco would not have expected to be in this position. He sat there for several moments, wondering what he should do. Teddy’s body slackened, and out of fear that his head might fall and hit the bench, Draco brought his arms around him to hold him in place.
“Oh!” She practically squeaked. He removed the list from his pocket and handed it to her.
Draco shook his head and tore his eyes away from Potter, finding himself looking at Miss Lovegood. She was gazing wistfully at the dancers, and Draco came to her side.
When the pair exited the room, Draco turned toward Potter. “I am having tea with Miss Lovegood tomorrow.”
He grinned. “Flying. Quidditch matches. Dabbling in defense spell creation with Hermione. Learning about my family. Trying to lead as private and quiet a life as possible outside of my charity obligations. Sundays at the Burrow.”
“I did not know either until the battle. But I also didn’t know that I had magic within me until Mr. Hagrid rescued me from my family. I think knowing that the Elder Wand answers to me has allowed me to harness its power.” Potter absently stroked his thumb over Draco’s knuckles as he spoke. “Hermione also thinks that because I was willing to die to try to protect everyone, it somehow compounded and strengthened the power my mother’s sacrifice gave me. Then when I used that in combination with the Elder Wand’s power…”
Mrs. Malfoy smiled at him very fondly. “Sometimes I forget that you are not my little boy anymore. Even if we disagree at times, I am so proud of you and the man you have become.”
He was already unable to sleep, so he grabbed the book and opened to one of the letters Harry had written him during his week in France.
He took the satchel that Fitzy had packed that morning and led Draco to the parlor. Potter was already waiting for him in flying robes. Draco had not seen him in such attire since Hogwarts and he almost felt like he was sixteen again, subtracting the crippling fear brought about by the Dark Lord’s mission.
“Mmm,” she said in disbelief, her eyes cutting to the letter on the floor. “I have guests coming for tea. Next time, close the door and keep your indolence to yourself.”
Draco took a deep breath and shrugged. “I fell in love with Mr. Potter when I should not have. Not when I must marry someone else and secure an heir.”
“Just give her time,” Potter said softly, and Draco nodded hesitantly in response.
“Merlin!” Draco panicked, trying to right his broom but it refused to yield to him. No matter what he did, he accelerated closer and closer to the ground. Draco could not change its descent even by the smallest amount.
Draco saw Harry making his way to the dais to give his speech, and he reached forward and grabbed his wrist to stop him.
He sighed. “How are you?”
he wrote in their book three nights later.
“Erm, thank you.” As Griffel began to disrobe him, it was easy to see that he was faster and more efficient than Draco’s own valet. He even floated mid-air to handle the top of Draco’s clothing instead of dragging about the heavy, rolling staircase. Once finished, he whisked Draco’s other clothes into the nearby wardrobe.
“No! No. My mother has a prying eye and also thinks I am having an adulterous affair with Hermione Granger-Weasley.”
“No,” Draco said with a sigh. “I will need to give you a new address.” Draco was about to tell Mr. Stone their townhome address when he had an idea. “Actually, I will be doing most of my flying elsewhere and would like it to be delivered there. Please send it to me, care of Mr. Harry Potter, Godric’s Hollow. And include a snitch, as well. If you will allow me some parchment and a quill, I will include a note.”
“I was referring to
Draco whipped around, his eyes darting furtively between Harry and Miss Lovegood. “Do you mean—”
He nodded. “If you are agreeable,” he pulled a folded strip of paper out of his pocket and handed it to him. When he opened it, he saw a familiar address.
He looked at his mother and she nodded for him to continue. “I would like to name Teddy as my heir.”
“Yes? Was he agreeable to you?”
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy.”
The corner of Harry’s lip quirked upward in thanks. “When will you leave for France?” he asked.
“We have tonight. I do not know what tomorrow will bring, but there is tonight. What do you want right now?”
He certainly did not foresee his day shaping up this way when he sat down to wizard chess with the World’s Most Bothersome Gryffindor. He sighed and looked at the remaining name on his list. After several drafts, including one he set on fire, he finally penned a letter that he felt warranted to post.
He gave what some may have called a dramatic sigh. “Very well, Ms. Granger-Weasley. I suppose I can make the time.”
The address for the office of The Patronus Charity for Restoration and Unity was a mere five blocks from Mrs. Malfoy’s home, and Draco felt a walk would be most welcome. He looked at the mirror one last time, turning his face back and forth to ensure the evenness of his sideburns, a habit he formed after a disastrous barber incident two years past. His valet, Fitzy, then helped him into his robes, and he headed downstairs to say goodbye to his mother.
“On the contrary. I am not well acquainted with many people here,” Draco said, ignoring her raised brows at his lack of good acquaintances. “He has proven to be a friend already.”
“Actually—”
“No,” Potter replied. “I had no idea until my Hogwarts letter arrived.”
Potter exhaled and grinned. “Meet me there in an hour?”
Harry nodded. “Even with Voldemort’s best efforts, we are still here.” He huffed. “Alive despite it all.”
After he ate, Fitzy came to dress him, and he returned to his bureau to begin his task.
“I sat in potions class with him for six years, Mrs. Granger-Weasley. I do not think he would know a potion ingredient in the wild if it grew legs and kicked him.”
Blankets were spread under a large oak tree, complete with a large spread of cold meats, cheeses, and fruit. Potter walked forward and perched himself against the trunk as if he often time under its large, outspread branches. It was a nice spot, Draco thought, and he could easily see Potter coming here to escape the eyes and expectations of the Wizarding World.
“I shall never marry Miss Greengrass. She is ghastly.”
Potter laughed in response, but then his face sobered. “Malfoy.” He walked closer to him. “I read the
“I feel much the same way.”
(though
“Mama,” he repeated, feeling dizzy with… hope. He had not experienced one positive emotion since Harry had left him in the forest, and the feeling was overwhelming.
“Mother!” He shot up from his seat like a guilty first-year, scattering the letter and the invitation to the floor. “Nothing, just… enjoying a relaxing Saturday.”
She grinned. “Are you not?”
They lay in bed for hours, their bodies entwined, fingers trailing over skin as the candles melted down to their wicks. They spoke of professors and quidditch and friends and birthdays past. They finally spoke of the war, too, and Potter hovered over him, pressing kisses to his scars in apology.
Draco looked up to see Teddy trudging toward him.
“Their little magazine.
“Where?”
Potter’s jaw tightened before he spoke. “Well, Malfoy, you tried to murder him, so society is well aware of your true sentiments toward Albus Dumbledore.”
Draco thought for a moment before answering. The magic
at Flourish and Blotts. Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco’s brows furrowed. “Yes, of course.”
“No. No, I am fine.” He could not believe that he was here alone with Harry Potter, with a large, tempting bed and not a soul around to disturb them. Weeks of wanting and unquenched desire would finally give way to the pleasure they both so desperately wanted. So it was not a surprise that his hands were suddenly shaking as they reached for Potter’s lapel, pausing as they brushed the fabric. “May I?” His voice was so soft that it was foreign to his own ears. Potter nodded and Draco slid the coat off of his shoulders, the sound of it hitting the floor breaking the quiet of the night.
“Yes.” His voice shook, and he cursed himself for it.
“Mr. Malfoy?” said Madam Joylove. “Are you ready?” He handed her his teacup with dread. She was quiet this time, taking much longer to read than she did for Miss Lovegood. “I see a… chain?” She seemed unsure. Draco could not remember what a chain signified from his Divination classes. “That would mean an engagement in your future!” She smiled.
“I’ve asked the elves to prepare a meal if you have the time?” Potter asked, guiding them to a small creek that they had flown over a few minutes earlier.
Harry Potter and all of the rest of that rubbish.” He was silent for several moments before he turned back over. “I wish I could just be me. I wish I were just—”
was the inspiration for Harry's grandmother's portrait.
“I would find that most agreeable. We lost our own library with the estate.”
. He sat down with Rita Skeeter just this afternoon to discuss our work with Harry Potter’s charity.” He gave his mother the smallest, most imperceptible glare he could without attracting attention. He knew very well that she had purposefully pivoted the conversation as to not offend their pureblood sensibilities.
“Oh.” His brow furrowed. “I could always sign them ‘H.’”
He went downstairs to join Mrs. Malfoy for breakfast. “You look very handsome this morning, darling.”
She sighed and looked at him for a moment, her mouth taut with displeasure. “Very well. This is your plan after all.”
Wednesday morning brought him to the sprawling estate of Godric’s Hollow. Potter was already in the air when he arrived and, after a quick change into flying robes, Draco mounted his new broom to join him. They spent several hours in the air, chasing each other and the snitch and practicing old Quidditch maneuvers from their Hogwarts days.
“I thought that surely Madam Pomfrey would have healed them.” He ran his fingertips over the worst gash along his ribcage.
While Draco had attended university in France the last few years, Mrs. Malfoy had worked tirelessly to separate the Death Eater image from the family name. She was already well known in the charity circuits and well liked in a number of circles.
“In a bad way?”
Mrs. Granger-Weasley looked as though she might object but was interrupted by Potter. “Of course. The unity ball was his idea and your family is its benefactor.”
“You led him on!” she exclaimed.
Draco grabbed a piece of parchment and a quill from his bag. “Here is my address for apparition.”
He wondered if Potter was in a similar predicament. He was not a pureblood, but he was still a gentleman of means. Surely they shared the same duty. Draco frowned. Potter had never mentioned a courtship, and the only woman he had seen him with was Mrs. Granger-Weasley. Was he courting a woman? Was he courting
“Potter?”
His mother leapt forward, brandishing her wand to quickly vanish the mess. “Are you alright?”
“I want
That certainly explained Potter’s strange request to use his floo.
Harry reached up and touched his face gently. “And I told you I would tease you as long as you would have me.”
She closed her eyes. “Hope is a beautiful thing, is it not?”
was most fortuitous.”
“Pipsy has brought tea for Mr. Potter and his guest,” she said. She seemed awed by his very presence and gave Potter an enamoured smile before setting down the tray and removing the tea cosy. She looked downright smitten.
“I am not ‘courting’ anyone,” he said. A gentleman kissing another gentleman was hardly courting, was it? There would be no impending engagement or waltz down the aisle.
Circe, he really was absolutely besotted with Harry Potter.
“Of course,” said Potter. “Mrs. Granger-Weasley and I felt that while there was a great deal of charity work for physical restoration — such as reconstruction of buildings and businesses that were damaged in the war — there was not much work for interpersonal restoration and unity. The Patronus Charity will work to support new muggle-born witches and wizards in their assimilation to our world; to provide education to wizards on muggles, muggle-borns, werewolves, centaurs, and other misunderstood magical beings; to work with the ministry to mend relationships with those marginalized groups; to support elves working toward liberation; and to assist Hogwarts in promoting inter-house unity. We also have plans to provide monetary assistance to magical peoples who are unable to support themselves due to prejudice or other hardships.”
“Yes, Fitzy! Is there anyone else standing in this room of whom I am unaware?”
“Mother? May I meet you there? I would like to make a stop first.”
“Oo,” Mrs. Greengrass squealed with delight, no doubt imagining a son-in-law influential enough to land a story in the newspaper. Merlin help him if he ever did marry into this family. He pictured a lifetime of using any excuse possible to wriggle out of Sunday dinners and other familial obligations.
Weasel huffed and took a drink of his wine.
Potter laughed deeply, and Draco realized he had never heard him laugh in such a manner. Perhaps spending their school years in perpetual fear of his life did not leave enough time for laughter. “Yes,” he responded. “His favorite color right now is green. I am sure you can imagine the effect.”
He sighed as he grabbed his wand to clean himself. He had at least a fortnight until he could see Potter again, and he had no idea how he could wait so long. Even after his body had been sated, he felt such an intense yearning to see him and be with him.
Potter laughed and came over so that they were standing side-by-side, facing the windows. “Madam Joylove’s?” He asked. Draco nodded. “Do not try the Witch’s Brew if you care anything about your tastebuds.” He laughed again. “Oh, the image of the two of you sitting at tea is a most amusing one.”
“Ha ha, mother,” Draco responded. She laughed and looked back down to the list, however her smile vanished as quickly as it had come. “What is the matter?”
“We should have held this meaning in a place that serves alcohol so we could properly celebrate together.”
“Indeed,” he said with disdain. “Though I can assure you, my life is not as exciting as you might imagine it to be.” He looked up to see that she was watching him very closely, making his skin itch with the intensity of her stare. He knew Mrs. Skeeter was not a powerful enough witch to cast
Harry leaned forward and whispered in his ear. “Anything for you.”
He grabbed Harry’s arm and escorted him away from Mrs. Malfoy. While the ballroom was a sight to behold — filled with beautiful flowers, delicate crystal and china, and intricately painted house banners — he was more interested in speaking with Harry one-on-one.  “You look incredible,” he whispered the moment they were far from prying ears. “How did I end up betrothed to such a man?”
“What is your favorite kind?”
The nights were warm, pleasantly so at this point of summer, so they would lie on top of the bedding after losing themselves in each other, the moonlight shining across Harry’s collar bones and the divots of his hips. Harry never stopped touching him, tangling his fingers in his hair or caressing his arms or trailing his hands up and down his bare back. It was as though he could not get enough, and truthfully, neither could Draco.
She stood and paced the room for several minutes before speaking. “I saw the way you looked in the manor. And I knew right then that our time with the Dark Lord has forever ruined that place for you. Even if it has been our home your entire life, it has been ruined. And then I asked myself why getting the manor back had been so important. And of course, I believe we both missed the home where our family had lived and you had grown up, but I think I had been fixated on my own vision for you — my son as head of Malfoy Manor with a wife and a child of his own.” She stopped walking and sat beside him again. “But you are rich enough to buy a grand estate of your own if you wanted. And,” she took a deep breath, “with a reversal of disownment, you would also have an heir.”
When he entered the ballroom, he saw his mother, also in navy robes with a sapphire eagle pendant at her neck, and he saw that she was talking to Harry.
She curtsied. “Of course. I am happy to be here.”
“At university in France,” Draco responded.
“I am as well as I can be.”
“None of us did.”
“I am shopping for my cousin. He has high hopes of joining the Quidditch team next year.”
“Malfoy,” he heard behind him and then felt a hand on his shoulder. “My relationship with Dumbledore was complicated.” He was quiet for several moments before he continued. “Hermione has also questioned his motives and role in my life, too, you know.”
“You want
“Right.” He took a deep breath and exhaled, his eyes returning to Draco’s. “My mother and her sister were born to a poor miner and his wife. My aunt was lucky enough to marry a merchant who was coming up in the world and they had built a comfortable life for themselves before I was dropped on their doorstep. Aunt Petunia hated my mother not only for her magic and her ability to escape their hardships by attending Hogwarts, but she also hated her for marrying into such a wealthy family. Even if they were wizards of Indian descent. After my parents died, my aunt and uncle thought that, as my new caretakers, they would have access to the Potter fortune. When they learned that was not the case, they began to treat me very poorly. I was a servant, but worse, as I received no payment. They starved me and barely clothed me. My cousin had a tutor but I was forbidden from receiving any schooling myself.
“May I take your hat? This house isn’t used often and we do not keep an elf staffed here.” Draco handed it over and Potter stepped out of the foyer to put it away. While he did so, he removed the gift from his pocket and enlarged it to his normal size. It was wrapped in brown parchment with a gold ribbon tied around its center.
“What are you doing?! We’re going to be late for potions!” he heard a shout, as Goyle passed by his side running sloppily.
Draco sat down first amongst the soft mattress and white comforter.
While his eyes roamed around the table, he almost gasped when his gaze landed on a treacle tart several dishes away.
“Malfoy”, a loud echo resonated around him as the room shook, seconds later he heard it again.
He couldn’t understand why he felt that way, but the fact that someone was confessing their love to Harry made him nervous. What was he going to do? It didn’t sit right with him, and he couldn’t understand the feeling...yet it was there all the same.
Harry looked at Draco’s desperate eyes and got what he meant as he let go of Draco’s cock with a soft ‘pop’. Harry took the time to remove his boxers as Draco lowered himself into the soft pillows, a panting mess.
He gulped, as he nervously moved his head forward. Harry did not seem to move away as he closed the space between them, and their lips met.
Momentarily shocked he spared a glance behind Goyle’s large build, where he saw Harry sitting with his idiot friends. He was cutting a slice from the treacle tart at the Gryffindor table, and Draco’s eyes widened. He couldn’t hear him but he could follow the shape of Harry’s lips.
“May I?” Harry asked, unbelievably nice. Which just succeeded in Draco feeling more turned on, as he nodded.
“Why? Jealous, Malfoy?`` Potter asked cockily a glint in his eye behind his spectacles.
That day he barely even saw Harry, he couldn’t tell why but he felt a feeling in his stomach, almost like he missed the other boy.
Not wanting to wait any longer Harry pulled out the 3 digits, seeing Draco’s body visibly relax.
Malfoy sprinted behind his friend as they barely arrived to class on time.
He was confused by the dream, and what it could mean. It hadn’t seemed that interesting or surprising but he wouldn’t know until he saw if it happened.
In the middle of the corridor stood no one other than Harry Potter, and in front of him was a girl, who was looking up at him admiringly.
“Don’t be a coward”
Draco took a shaky breath and closed his eyes, as Harry slowly pushed his index finger inside into the warm tight heat. He gave Draco a moment to adjust as he moved the finger in and out slowly.
He made his way further in as he finally spotted the brunette. Harry was leaning against the wall on the far right, his arms crossed over his chest. Light streamed in from the high up windows, as he could see small tiny particles floating around making the place seem almost unrealistic.
Draco waited.
Harry uncrossed his arms, “I think you know why I am here” he said loudly with a knowing gaze.
The blond-haired boy saw as the girl said the line he had heard earlier.
He shook his head, he knew that was too much. What had happened yesterday had merely been a coincidence and nothing else.
He dropped the pillow as he fell back onto the bed trying to ignore the feeling in between his legs. He was the heir of the Malfoy name, how could he be this weak towards someone he knew his father hated.
Draco assented as he slightly opened his mouth, although it was enough for Harry’s tongue to go through. Their tongues playfully fought one another, like snakes, making their insides weak.
Seeing Harry happy made Draco feel a warm feeling inside that he couldn’t explain. He instead looked back down at the table, not wanting to be caught staring...again.
He was highly embarrassed, if anyone could see what he had dreamt, he would feel forever ashamed. Not only about what it had been but his bodily reaction to the dream had just been too much. He was such a fool.
Going to see the game would only make him realize how much he missed it. He missed the quickness of it all, the wind against his face and hair, the feeling of his body soaring into the sky. He wanted to play, but he had to make time for other things either if he wanted to or not.
Standing in front of the wall, he started pacing in front of it, staring deeply at the letter and the words inscribed on the parchment paper.
He smeared the leftover lube over his hand before roughly coating his dick with it.
He had a hard time finding bad qualities about the other boy that he couldn’t even prepare a strong comeback whenever Crabbe or Goyle mentioned Harry. They must have started thinking he had gone soft.
Their bodies were sweaty as Harry took a moment to look up at Malfoy with admiration. The bright sunlight streamed in through the high windows making Draco’s blonde hair shine in the noon sun, reminding Harry of a botticelli angel.
He gently stood up, mind dizzy from what had just happened. He had gone from the center of the forbidden forest to the inside of the castle in the blink of an eye, and it took him a bit to process this entirely.
Harry turned around as he noticed a certain pair of pale blue eyes on him. The young Malfoy quickly turned around, too late, as he felt a small haze of red spread across his cheeks from being caught staring. He probably looked like an idiot.
Draco unbeknownst to him whispered under his breath. He couldn’t lose Harry to that - that idiotic girl.
Mind drifting away in a dream. Draco didn’t know if it was because the Slytherin dormitory was partly under the great lake but usually his dreams had a lot to do with being underwater. When they weren’t nightmares that was.
He shook his head, as he turned to look at the clock next to his bed. It was only minutes before he had to wake up, so instead he removed the alarm and jumped out of bed.
Harry got closer to the other boy, noticing a wet spot on the dark green underwear, as he nearly snickered but stopped himself from doing so. He grabbed the hem of the pair, as Draco visibly shuddered at the feeling of Harry’s fingers upon his skin. The black haired boy slowly and teasingly brought the pair down, revealing the pale boy’s dick to the rather empty room.
It wasn’t till much later when the clock neared four in the morning that he dreamt.
he questioned,
But most importantly...would it happen in real life like it had so done before?
Draco ended the kiss moments after, breathing deeply as he felt the surroundings around him. The lights from the window streamed in shining a soft glow upon their faces.
His pale blue eyes were wide as he noticed the dizzyingly small distance between them. Breathing in the same air, their noses almost touching.
“I really wanted to see you”
After several seconds, he wiggled a second finger next to the first one making Malfoy’s body flinch as he scissored them, and moved them at a steady pace wanting to finish the process faster.
Maybe it had something to with hormones, he knew that not all prophecies told everything correctly or exactly how it could go. But Potter kissing him? That was almost ridiculous and so far-fetched it could be a tall tale.
“St-” , the blond boy managed to choke out. Harry’s bright green eyes looked up at him, as their intense gaze sent a shiver down Draco’s spine.
The towers upon towers of objects were gone, as now a single thing stood in the middle of the room with a rather remarkable presence — a bed.
Harry started moving faster, sucking harder against the hard member making Draco moan, his hand stopping. He used the other hand to press it against Harry’s forehead feeling the lightning shaped scar ragged against the otherwise soft skin.
“Sorry… but can I copy from your homework?”, Goyle asked expectantly.
He woke up with a start, visibly shaken.
The castle was emptier than usual, as he walked through the corridors. He didn’t know what he was looking for but knew something important was about to happen.
When he woke up a few hours later he dressed up in his now usual black suit with matching black shirt and black spiffy shoes. He looked in the mirror and passed a comb through his pale blond hair until his hair looked meticulous and particularly nice, as he left the Slytherin dorm. Crabbe and Goyle were not in the dorm anymore as they were probably up to their normal shenanigans or stuffing their faces with food.
Azkaban had not been kind to his father’s mental state, and he had taken his own life the previous year. The sickness in his mind had made him forgetful, violent, and paranoid. At times, he no longer recognised his own wife, and he had attacked her during one of her last visits. She had been frightened to return and, when they received news of his passing, had warred with guilt that she had not had the chance to tell him goodbye.
“Good morning,” he said, sitting down next to her.
“I could not have done it without you. He loved your ideas for the ball,” he said, wanting to see her felicity continue.
“Should you not be on your way to visit Mr. Potter?” she asked.
When he read this particular headline, however, he raised his eyebrows and smiled.
Potter sighed. “Over here, Ron!”
a Slytherin, Potter.”
She smiled at him. “Good morning, Mr. Malfoy,” she said in French. “There is more coffee available if you would like some.”
“I am sorry, Miss Lovegood.”
He parted his legs, telling Harry how to prepare him and make him ready. His touch was tentative but still exquisite, filling him up, making him ache. It felt even more so when his fingers brushed that spot within him that made him see stars.
“Oh,” she said, her posture relaxing the smallest amount.
Then suddenly, Draco’s descent began to slow. He looked up and saw Potter’s hand stretched toward Draco’s broom, and as his hand moved lower, the broom followed until it slowly lowered Draco to the ground. Draco fell to his knees, tossing aside the broom and trying to catch his breath. As his heart pounded in his chest, he heard Potter land and run to his side. He was so shaken from the incident that he thought nothing of the fact that Potter had not used his wand.
“Where have you been these last few years?” Weasley asked with narrowed eyes. “It seems as though you’ve appeared from thin air.” Apparently Weasel had never learned about polite conversation.
He led her to the drawing room and closed the door. “Let us move Mr. Travers and put Miss Lovegood beside Miss Astoria at dinner.”
“Good day, Miss Lovegood. And to you, sir. What lies in your future this day?” she asked, voice hearty and firm.
“I am your cousin, Edward Lupin. But you can call me Teddy.” His face was red from playing out of doors, and his hair was damp with sweat.
Draco did remember the burned spots, names and faces that had belonged to blood traitors who had dared to defile the family. “No, you are right.” He suddenly felt, as he so often did, the weight of being a Malfoy, a Black, a former Death Eater. The cruelties committed by his ancestors —
Potter’s brows knit in confusion. “You have been here before?”
Draco had had plans for their first time; he had wanted to wrap his mouth on Potter’s prick, to feel him come, salty and warm, on his tongue. But their ministrations were over before he could even get that far, their hard lengths sliding against each other and Potter pressing kisses to Draco’s open mouth.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, not wishing to be awake yet. His head was pounding and he felt positively miserable; could Fitzy not realise that just by looking at him? “Mmph, not yet. Come back in an hour.”
“Harry, you know that I have no attraction toward women. Even before we met again, I did not want this. And then you came into my life again and turned everything upside down. Suddenly you were in my every thought and dream. I wanted nothing more than to be with you, and I allowed myself to yield to temptation, to forget my duties, to cherish the time we could have together. To, to lo—”
“Deal.” Draco removed his glove and extended his hand to shake Potter’s. Potter did the same, and when his hand enclosed Draco’s, it felt warm and calloused from years on a broom. Draco’s face heated as he suddenly remembered the last time he had touched Potter, with fiendfyre licking at their heels when they escaped the Room of Requirement. If only eleven-year-old Draco, whose handshake was scorned by Harry Potter, could see him now, placing a bet with the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
He heard the clink of her tea cup being sat upon the tray, and he felt her hand rest upon his arm. “What about the obligation to yourself? To your own happiness?”
“Yes, please have my initials engraved on the broom handle. I also have other business this afternoon, so I will need it delivered to my home.”
“Because we’re
A small smile graced Draco’s mouth at hearing those words. “We have the book. We will write to one another.”
He led her to the drawing room, where she poured them both a cup of tea. They were side-by-side on the chaise, and she handed him a cup before taking one for herself. “I added valerian root to help you sleep,” she said. He nodded his thanks and took a sip. “Noxberries would have been better, but they are hard to come by in this part of the world.” They drank in silence for a few minutes. “Do you want to talk about it?”
Draco took off his hat and bowed. “Good afternoon, Mrs. Granger-Weasley.”
“Well for a muggle-born’s magic to be so advanced, even compared to the pureblood students who attended with you, is practically unheard of.”
Draco returned the smile and followed Potter into the meeting room past the desk which was still piled with leaning towers of correspondence. “I was not aware that you were a godfather,” he said. “Have Mr. Weasley and Mrs. Granger-Weasley had a child?” The thought of even more Weasleys running around was enough to make his head hurt.
“Potter…” Draco trailed off in disbelief. This was too much. His mistreatment at the hands of his own family, his lack of wizarding education until he stepped foot onto Hogwarts ground, the fact that— “I cannot believe that Professor Dumbledore allowed that to happen to you.” He stood up, anger bubbling so suddenly in his blood that untamed magic rippled under his skin.
He smiled, though obviously still confused. “Gladly. And we hope to see you again soon as well, Mr. Malfoy.”
“Well, I cannot say it brings me joy, but—” he sighed, “the past isn’t going anywhere, as much as we would like it to.”
“I was a child when I did the things that I did. If I knowingly allow harm to come to children when I am 100 years old, then please, Potter, take me to task.” Draco turned away and walked toward the creek to calm his nerves. He was angry at Dumbledore and angry at Potter for sticking up for him and angry that this lovely day was now ruined by history that would not go away no matter how hard Draco tried.
After some time Draco headed back to the Slytherin common room to continue working on some almost due transfiguration homework. When it was time for lunch, he was nearly dragged out by Crabbe and Goyle who wanted him to go eat with them. He almost wanted to go back as the Great Hall was basically: celebration central. People were noisy and loud as others were cheering clamorously and eating quickly. It was quite evident that the Gryffindors had won, as they were high-fiving each other with big grins upon their faces. Draco distastefully went to sit down at the Slytherin table, as he glanced up seeing no one else other than Harry at the Gryffindor table. The boy with the scar was laughing, as his hands were up high in cheer.
Draco went to his seat next to Crabbe and Goyle as he placed the potions book in front of him which he had not even noticed he carried. Professor Slughorn closed the door to the classroom, as he walked to the front. It was at that moment that the door opened again although this time from the other side and someone stepped in.
The young Malfoy’s head quickly turned towards the sound, as his pale blue eyes searched for the direction of the noise before breaking into a run.
Harry’s hands were roaming over Draco’s back, as he sneakily moved one and made his way to the front towards the boy’s crotch. He smirked, feeling behind the trouser material something hard and erect underneath, as Draco let out a shuddering breath.
Malfoy shuddered, feeling goosebumps go all over his body as he felt Harry’s tongue touch his lower lip wanting permission.
A screen of black overshadowed him, as everything momentarily turned dark before the dream came into focus again. However, now Potter’s lips were on his.
When he figured it was time Harry squeezed a third finger inside making Draco throw his head back feeling his ass stretching around the other digit.
CRASH!
Two weeks had nearly gone by and he had no dreams whatsoever, or to be specific no special ones. He was starting to think maybe it had all been some sort of freak show incident. What he didn’t know was that specific night he was going to have the most extreme and last dream of them all ; the pinnacle per say.
“Miss Astoria, how are you? I would not expect to see you at a quidditch shop.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Very well.” It was hard to keep up with his irritation when Potter looked so… so—
. My cousin.”
He shook his head. “I ruined everything.” Then he huffed. “As I am wont to do.”
“Oh,” she said softly. She sat before him in the grass and grabbed both of his hands. “You do not have to tell me what happened, but I am here for you if you wish to speak on it.”
“I think not. Let us acclimate him first before we surround him with snakes.” Draco only saw his fellow Slytherins at formal events these days. Most who escaped Azkaban had, like them, also tried to escape the pall of the Dark Lord’s shadow. He saw Zabini and Miss Parkinson the most, and that was still very little. Still, if he invited them, they would descend on Potter for their own personal gains.
“Fair play to you,” Charlie nodded, pointing his wand at the kettle to start it boiling. “I suppose I’m lucky I don’t need it after wrestling dragons all day.”
“We’ll probably have at least five more of these days this year.” Draco grinned. “And each one will surprise us again.”
Harry chuckled. “I’d set an alarm or something.”
Harry nodded wordlessly.
“There’s always room for treacle tart,” Harry replied solemnly. “Just… not yet.”
“I like the sound of that,” Harry replied, returning the smile. “I’ve just been looking at the sandwiches. I think I’m just going to have a chicken salad on brown.”
“Yeah. Very well, actually,” Harry replied with a smile.
“Come in,” Draco said as he opened the door a few seconds later. “I wondered when you were going to knock. What were you doing?”
Charlie grinned and shrugged. “I wanted it to be a surprise. Plus, I knew there’d be enough food for an extra mouth.”
“Surely not?” Harry said, turning to face her.
“Well, you should be but I’m just glad you’re alright,” Draco said. “And I think, maybe it’s about time we talked about our living arrangement, don’t you?”
Heading back down the stairs, he walked into the dining room to find the table set for two. He turned to find Narcissa entering the room. “Who’s the other place for?”
“I hope so. I think I’ll just have to start answering with that, whatever the question is,” Harry replied, taking his cloak off and hanging it in the cupboard.
“I work in the florist on Diagon Alley,” Harry replied cautiously. “Narcissa Malfoy’s.”
“What about cellophane? Did you check that?” Draco asked, turning to watch Harry as he moved through the room.
“Shh. Alright, so I suppose I could say my type is… athletic? Rather than Quidditch specific,” Harry said slowly, looking at the list again.
Hermione licked her lips nervously. “It’s Draco.”
“Oh, don’t mention that,” Draco groaned, picking up his coffee again. “I was a horrible little git at school, you know that.”
Draco smiled and nodded. “Yes.”
“If you don’t mind?” Harry replied hopefully. “We will tell people, but we want to do it in our own time. We’re sort of still getting used to it ourselves, what with Christmas and everything going on.”
“Yes, I’ll get the next ones,” Harry replied with a grin.
“Good job we’re wizards, then,” Draco replied, pulling out his wand to Summon the water jug that he’d left near the sink. “I have to admit I didn’t plan to eat that much.”
“Halloween-themed dried flowers, which led to remembering the troll in the dungeon at school,” Harry chuckled. “So, if we’re going to design some Christmas displays this afternoon, should we maybe get started?”
Draco hurried to the Apparition point. He knew they weren’t really going on a date, but he still felt like there was some sort of expectation of him, and the feeling just reminded him of
“It’s alright, you’re my idiot, I’m allowed to say it.” Draco grinned.
“I’ll be back in a second then. Chicken on brown, yes?”
Draco blinked and straightened up from where he was sweeping the debris into a dustpan. “What’s crawled up your arse and died? It’s not even quarter past six yet, they’re not due until half past.”
“I told you. It’s a gem of a place,” Draco replied. “I think I must keep them in business on my own.”
Charlie smiled. “Seriously, Harry, there’s no hard and fast rule that says you have to be in a relationship by a certain time of life. Just enjoy doing what you’re doing and it’ll come.”
“Then tell them that,” Draco said simply.
Harry snorted. “Yeah, your job is a bit more physically demanding than mine, which must help.”
“I’d had enough of bad blind dates,” Harry said with a sigh. “So I made up a date of my own. With Draco’s help. He was my ‘date’ and we spent a lot of time drinking coffee and reading books together. Eventually, I realised that he was the one all along.”
Draco shook his head. “No, I did not. I had a feeling he was seeing someone, but he hasn’t said anything. He’s been very happy lately.”
“I’m alright with it,” Harry replied. “I think. I can’t remember the last time I shared a book with someone.”
“Of course,” Draco replied, pressing his slips to Harry’s once more for a brief, light kiss. “To sleep, or… ?”
As soon as they were seated, the food appeared on their plates. Smiling at each other, they began to eat.
“Ah, well you should be used to that by now,” Draco smirked.
“Fair enough,” Harry replied, making his way to the café counter. “What do you fancy this time?”
Draco’s eyes widened as he looked at Harry. “
“Ah, well, maybe another time,” Harry said apologetically. “Now, this bouquet… follow me,” he continued, coming out from behind the counter and gesturing to Ron. He made his way around the shop, showing Ron the different flowers they had in stock in the colours he’d mentioned.
“Twenty?” Harry exclaimed, almost dropping the bucket he was holding. “George, that makes him
It was a dance in the loosest sense of the word in Draco’s mind. He continued to watch as Harry wiggled his hips and kicked his legs before waving his arms around wildly. The imagery caused Draco’s mind to work overtime. On one hand, Potter looked like an idiot, but on the other… he’d never been more attracted to the man. But he couldn’t allow this to go on. With wide eyes, he took an involuntary step forward. “What in Merlin’s name are you doing?” he asked in a loud whisper.
“It will, but it’s pointless us coming in,” Draco replied as he pulled the stepladder out of its cubby-hole. “The last few years have taught us that. Better we have time to relax, don’t you think?”
Draco plastered on the best look of anticipation he could muster. “You will. I look forward to it.”
“Mr. Potter,” he said. “I was wondering if I may have your first dance of the evening?”
“Do you need assistance with anything?”
“If we must,” he responded. “Hopefully his wife has taught that oaf some manners since our school days.”
“Miss Lovegood,” he said, his eyes meeting hers, “this is an unexpected surprise! May I introduce you to my professor and mentor, Mr. Henri Bernard. Professor, this is Miss Luna Lovegood.” They nodded to each other and exchanged pleasantries. “And this is Mr. Harry Potter.”
“Draco, darling,” his mother interrupted. “We do not want to bore our hosts with academia! Let us instead discuss your upcoming piece in the
, like nothing else and no one else mattered. He had felt Potter’s body against his own and he had seen the evidence of Potter’s own attraction and arousal. Potter wanted Draco just as much as Draco wanted him.
“Of course,” Draco replied, and kissed Harry’s forehead as they said goodbye.
“It is absolutely gorgeous,” Mrs. Granger-Weasley agreed. Her hand hovered above one of the house tables, and she delicately touched her fingers to the glimmering surface, which parted like smoke at her touch.
, he wrote at the top and underlined it twice. And then he began.
And Harry was lying in the bed, asleep.
“Is it?” she asked.
They walked for several minutes until she spoke. “I have been meaning to write you. I have been reading some philosophy works lately, one of which has interested me a great deal. It discusses the possibility and ethics of providing magical potions and remedies to muggles. Are you familiar?”
A future without Harry.
“Mr. Malfoy?” Quelter asked with a knock at the door. “Your mother is ready for you now.”
“Um,” he faltered, immediately picturing Potter begging to kiss him just two days ago. He felt the tips of his ears turn pink. Though he had not answered, Mrs. Skeeter’s quill worked furiously on the page.
“Mr. Malfoy?” she said. He looked up and a serving tray was in her hands. “Where shall we take this?”
Potter looked almost as awkward as Draco suddenly felt and he cleared his throat. “Let’s begin, shall we?”
“Oh, indeed,” Mrs. Malfoy replied. Her gaze turned to Draco. “So it
“All right. I feel sober enough to Apparate, but I do not think it would be wise for you to do the same. What is the address? You can side-along with me.”
The good far outweighed the bad, and so he could not help but smile and sink further into his armchair as he thought about what another Potter rendezvous might bring.
Draco nodded, his breath still shaky and fast. After a minute, his breathing evened enough to speak. “Is it cursed?”
“Indeed! In fact—”
“I do.”
Draco and Mrs. Malfoy had found several rituals to reverse the disownment, but with both parties in agreement, the quickest and most painless option involved the mixing of blood and an incantation. Draco held the palm of his mother’s right hand open and nicked it with a dagger, watching as the blood rose to the surface. He did the same with his aunt’s hand, and then the two sisters stood side-by-side.
“Of course.”
He descended the narrow stairs of the Bernards’ cottage, and saw Mrs. Bernard sipping a cup of coffee in the small sitting room. She was a rather thin woman, with brown skin, and her hair was covered by a soft green scarf, which complimented her yellow dress.
Thanks so much for the kinds words thus far. They mean so much to me!
“Yes,” Potter replied. “This is the founding board of the charity. This is Chiara Lobosca, who oversees werewolf relations; Herky, with elf relations; Mr. Hagrid and Firenze, you know of course, with giant and centaur relations; Mrs. Granger-Weasley oversees muggle-born relations and many, many other aspects of the charity, and I am here to,” he shrugged, as if a bit embarrassed, “raise funds I suppose.”
She shook her head. “I think you should have a cup of tea first.”
Draco looked up at Harry, their breathing harsh and quickened. The rain had not stopped, and it was pattering against the brick and cobblestones outside.
“Are you not supposed to tell
“Are you adverse to the idea?” she asked.
“We will, Mr. Potter,” he responded against his lips.
question.
“Erm, a pleasure,” Draco said. He had always felt awkward talking with portraits, but she seemed to neither notice or care.
well-trained,” his mother said.
“I dressed myself at Hogwarts, thank you very much, Mr. Potter.” Finally he was finished, removing the waistcoat before making quick work of his cravat. Potter’s collar fell open when he removed it, the pressed, white linen a stark contrast to the dark skin at his neck. He looked so gorgeously undone that Draco momentarily forgot to breathe.
Draco nodded. “They care about you.”
“Uh, yes?”
Potter smiled and tucked into the package, his lip caught temptingly between his teeth as he did so. The parchment fell to the floor and in his hands was a book, bound in mahogany-coloured leather, the gold-tipped pages shimmering in the candlelight.
I forgot to mention last chapter that
“I would not know as I did not even have a chance to speak with her. We could not say two words to each other without her mother butting in.”
“May I,” Draco said, his fingers itching to grab Harry’s hand but he stopped himself in case it was too forward, “may I tell you what I had planned to say when I tried to call?” Harry nodded, and Draco took a deep breath. “Harry, I know that I hurt you. That I used you. Even if it had never been my intention, I still did it, and I will always be sorry for that.
“I am well.”
“Yes, well
are Harry Potter, and
“You do?”
Weasley gave Draco the first move. Draco commanded his first piece, then took a sip of brandy. After several further moves, he had swiped Weasley’s knight, and he gave a smug grin.
“Is it difficult to live there?” Draco asked without thinking. It was more than likely too personal to ask if it was a hardship for Potter to live in the same house where his parents were murdered.
So the Golden Trio all lived together as a happy family.
Harry opened his eyes and looked directly at Draco. They were so green, like a meadow after the rain, and Draco could happily get lost in them until time passed them by. “I wanted to see you the other day. Hermione and Ron… well they are very persuasive when they want to be.” He huffed. “They talked me out of it.”
“You are smiling, my dear. A letter from someone special?” Mrs. Malfoy asked.
“And neither would Draco Malfoy,” she responded, glancing upward until their eyes met. They stayed like that for a moment, and then the smallest, almost imperceptible smile tugged at the corner of her mouth, and he found himself returning it.
He laughed sadly and rolled up his left sleeve, where the stark blackness of the Dark Lord’s symbol would always reside. “Can you not see, Miss Lovegood? This will haunt me for the rest of my miserable life, and even if there were good inside of me, it would be buried so far down that it would never see the light of day.”
“Yes, I have been, uh, otherwise detained. Is Mr. Potter taking callers? I am hoping to speak with him.”
“Mother…” he said, deflated. “Surely this is not the family to whom you want to align the Malfoys. Do you really want to spend every Christmas with Mrs. Greengrass?”
’s most terrible owl swooped in and dropped the paper right on top of his buttered toast. “You know, I am not going to let even you ruin this day for me.” He put a plate of sausages in front of him. “Take as much as you want, you insufferable vagrant.” The owl hooted and grabbed a piece in his beak, several more in his claws, then flew out the window.
“Very well, darling.” She stood up and leaned over to kiss his cheek. “I will be visiting Mrs. Zabini this morning, as she is under the weather. We can discuss your meeting with Mr. Potter at dinner.”
“Hmm, me too,” he mumbled sleepily. When Draco looked down, he saw that the boy had closed his eyes.
“Oh, I have been eyeing
Potter’s eyes widened and they jumped apart. “It’s Ron,” he whispered.
She rolled her eyes, though her smile betrayed her.
He knew that it was the truth, but her words still felt like a dagger to the gut. He took a shuddering breath. “Yes, I — I am attempting to mend our relationship. And securing an heir is a part of that.”
Well then. He did not know if Miss Astoria was attracted to women, but he figured it was worth an attempt. He grabbed Miss Lovegood by the wrist and brought her to where Miss Astoria was standing. Mrs. Malfoy was already there greeting her.
His father would have called him a blood traitor, but Draco locked that thought away. Lucius Malfoy had betrayed their family more than Draco ever could. So Draco penned a response to Professor Bernard, offering to help in any way that he could.
He grinned. “Teddy. He seems to be fond of you.”
“This!” he shouted, gesturing between them. He took a shuddering breath which turned into a choked sob. “Harry, I have duties. To my family. I have to—” he took another deep breath. “When I returned to England from university, my mother and I concocted a plan. To try to right our wrongs and restore the Malfoy name. We planned to donate money to important charities, to reenter society through advantageous social engagements, and—”
“Of course,” he said, trying to smile. Draco had often thought most divination to be frivolous and even dangerous. The Weird Sisters’ prophecy had ruined the life of that Muggle king, and the Dark Lord himself had been unhealthily obsessed with his own prophecy. Indeed, Potter’s parents would still be alive without Professor Trelawney’s fateful words. Despite his hesitation, he turned over his teacup.
“No. You startled me. I thought you may be—”
“Draco!”
Draco swallowed. “I see.” His face reddened in shame at his outburst, but he was a Malfoy, for Merlin’s sake. A Malfoy never apologized. “Thank you,” he said instead.
“My family’s estate. My estate.”
“Yes, I am pleased,” Draco said. His cream waistcoat was made of fine silk and his shirt was freshly starched, with frills escaping the waistcoat’s opening. Fitzy finished the intricate knot at his throat before climbing down, then back up again with his black robes. As evening wear, they were more form-fitting at the waist, and they fit narrowly against Draco’s frame.
“Darling, perhaps you could give us some time to speak alone?” his mother asked.
Draco furrowed his brow in confusion. Floo travel was more common for family, friends, and children. Not business associates. Or whatever they were. “Yes, that would be fine. I will contact the network to ensure your access to our floo.”
Draco swallowed and met his eyes. “Yes.”
They ordered drinks and an assortment of sandwiches, and then Harry leaned forward. “Professor Bernard, Mr. Malfoy has told me about your research and your endeavor to have it published. While I do not have any friends in scientific publishing, Mr. Malfoy and I are both friends with Miss Lovegood, whose family owns their own printing press. Their monthly magazine,
“Oh?” Potter looked down. He made an attempt to brush it off, but did not succeed.
End: Oof, I would say I’m sorry, but your pain brings me the slightest bit of joy. O:-) I promise to make it all up to you in the next and final chapter. It may be a bit late as I’m still working on it. <3
Potter interrupted him with a sharp intake of breath. “Malfoy.”
“Oh. Oh, yes, thank you.” They waited until the next song began, and then he escorted her to the dance line. As they began to move, however, she seemed distracted. Well, she seemed more distracted than usual.
“Thirty,” she responded before sipping her tea, as if this were a very normal Sunday morning occurrence. There were not even thirty Malfoys alive. What on earth would she do with them all? Draco swatted at their usual bothersome owl who tried to land on his head, and he reached for one of the papers.
“I recommend reading them in order. I believe you may already have the fifth one in the library here.”
’s most offending owl came careening through the window. Draco sighed and held up the sausage that he knew the bird would steal. The owl hooted at the sight, dropped the paper, and swooped down to retrieve the sausage. Then he flew about the room twice and finally exited.
Teddy let go of his hand and knelt in the dirt, motioning for Draco to join him with one hand and putting his index finger to his lips with the other to quiet him. He lifted one of the large leaves of the pumpkin plant, and there sat a garden gnome munching happily on a strawberry, his little face covered in red juices. His eyes opened and widened a second later when he saw Teddy. He gasped and then made a very quick escape into the thick of the garden.
Circe, how had he messed everything up so terribly?
“It is a paired diary. I have the other. Anything you write in your copy will show up in mine. So we can write to each other without prying eyes.” He reached forward and softly clasped Potter’s wrist, his fingertips caressing the soft skin there. “And this way we can write…
“Good evening, Miss Astoria, thank you very much for joining us,” he said.
Madam Joylove brought their tea to the table, a teapot for each of them, and poured their cups. She mumbled something about returning for readings, but Draco did not pay much attention as he was adding sugar and the smallest hint of milk to his tea.
“Not like this.” He realised that he was trembling. “And not you. You would never.” He squeezed her hand. “You are too good.”
“What?” Draco responded. Potter’s eyes were glued to Draco’s body, and when he looked down, he realized that he was staring at the silver-white scars crisscrossing along his chest and torso. “Oh. Right.”
“There is breakfast on the table,” she responded. He nodded his thanks and crossed into the next room where Professor Bernard was already digging into his eggs and khobz.
“Very well. And your usual, Miss Lovegood?”
” He tried to imagine Potter — Harry — in Slytherin robes, in the Slytherin common room, in his Slytherin dormitory, and felt his brain turn to mush at the thought.
“I will admit no such thing,” Draco replied, and removed the paper from his toast to
Potter took his hand and pressed against him once more. “I want you too badly, Mr. Malfoy, to play games.” He stepped back, their hands still entwined, and he pulled Draco to encourage him to follow. “Please.”
He shrugged, pulling at Draco’s shirt from the waistband of his trousers. “I do not need a wand for much these days.”
a part of your plan.” She finished her tea.
“Whatever you say, Mr. Malfoy.” She gathered her ingredients and shears and placed them in a basket before standing. “I do need to head back to clean up before we go to the Burrow. I would be happy to escort you if you would like to have a word with Mr. Potter.”
He walked into the shop, the familiar and comforting smells of wood, leather, and polish meeting him as he entered. Draco had frequented this shop as a boy and recognized its owner, Mr. Stone, shelving quaffles to the left.
“But—”
“Thank you, Fitzy. Please remind Quelter that our guests will be arriving by floo this evening so that he is ready to take their things.”
He walked the edge of the room while waiting for Potter, taking in the view from the windows. Several minutes passed before Kreacher finally entered and Potter followed behind him. The ends of his hair were dampened, as if he had just recently bathed, and Draco spotted a bit of shaving soap beneath his left sideburn. He quickly shoved the image of Potter in a bathtub into a dark corner of his mind and locked it away for later.
“Yes, I just came to see if you wanted to go to Mama’s for tea. She has just flooed to invite us.”
“I am quite sure,” she replied and walked arm-in-arm with Draco down the stairs and out the door of the manor. He heard Mr. Greengrass behind them, and Mrs. Malfoy turned to face him. “Thank you so much for your time and for convincing the ministry to let us visit. Please tell Mrs. Greengrass that I will call on her within the next few days!”
The suggestion sounded positively revolting, but Draco tried his best to smile. “Thank you for the recommendation. I shall consider it.”
“What is it, dear?” She asked.
“Lokey, would you please leave for a few minutes?” Draco asked, hoping that Mrs. Malfoy would feel more comfortable if they were completely alone.
“The wards have been disarmed, Mr. Greengrass,” the auror to the left said, and Mr. Greengrass stepped to the side and motioned for them to come forward.
A woman whom Draco assumed was Madam Joylove came to their table, looking akin to Professor Trelawney’s long lost sister. Wild hair escaped an orange turban cap and the edges of her shawl were burned from, what Draco could only assume to be, too many run-ins with kettle fires.
“Are you alright?”
“Oh no. She takes it so very seriously, and she would never share something she deemed to be so important and private.”
“You have nothing to fear.” He extended his arm in an attempt to both end the uncomfortable conversation and to steer them toward the house. She looked him directly in the eyes, as if measuring him, and finally took his arm to continue.
She turned the cup slightly. “Oh. I apologize, Mr. Malfoy but it looks as though…” She turned the cup again. “I believe it may, in fact, be a lightning bolt.”
“Then I shall write to Minister Shacklebolt at once to recommend an Order of Merlin for your effort.”
“Very well.”
“Well?”
Potter suddenly dived down and Draco could see that he was attempting to fly through a low clearing ahead. Draco pointed his broom downward to follow him, but it dipped too quickly and he started to head straight toward the ground.
Harry kneeled down before him. “Draco,” he said, “what’s the matter?” Draco shook his head. “Draco. Tell me what’s wrong.”
“How is the summer treating you in the city, Mrs. Malfoy?” asked Mrs. Greengrass. She was a ruddy-faced woman, plump after giving birth to four children. Her dress robes were very old fashioned, harkening to the style of his mother’s school days.
They crawled under the covers and faced each other, legs tangling as magic tingled against his skin while Potter cleaned the traces of their coupling.
Draco smiled. “I am sure she will be happy to hear from you. The announcement in the paper was not very detailed. Would you mind providing more information about the charity and its mission?”
“Uh, yes, I saw,” he replied, a bit uncomfortable with the physical proximity. However, he tried to ignore it. “Though I did not realize that it was your first time. Did you enjoy it?”
“‘And, dear readers,’” his mother read aloud. “‘I asked the question you all want to know: is there a special someone in Draco Malfoy’s life? “Let a gentleman have his secrets,” he responded, with a fetching blush.’” Mrs. Malfoy glanced up from the paper, giving him the same look she gave yesterday over his spilled letter.
“He does not have much peace in public. He is always followed by the press or those who want to meet or take advantage of who he is. It is very taxing on his spirit. Some time back, Mrs. Granger-Weasley and I suggested using Floo for travel and limiting his broader social appearance to his charity work. I also suggested drinking gurdyroot infusion twice daily. The changes have made his spirits much brighter.”
“I believe George Weasley may be planning a dastardly prank against me, but other than that, I may live.”
himself?”
“Very well. I will get this list to Vinxy tonight. Shall we invite anyone else?”
Draco took a sip of tea. “My studies at university focused on lineage magic, and I assisted Professor Henri Bernard on a fascinating study about the blood of muggle-born and pureblood witches. When it is published, it may help your educational mission to widely distribute it.”
“A smart idea,” Potter said. When Draco looked up, Potter’s cheeks were dusted with pink. He feared what his own face must look like.
Apparated
Draco was unable to answer as the door opened to Potter escorting a much older woman inside.
“Potter, what on
“Not tonight, you are not. And do not think I have forgotten our bet. Five galleons to the house who wins the charity cup.” He chuckled. “It does amuse me greatly to know how hard you will be working to ensure that Gryffindor snatches it.”
“Is it because you defeated the Dark Lord? Did his power transfer to you?”
The party gave way to dancing, starting with Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley moving to the dance area. Draco stood on the side, watching as the pair twirled together. What would it be like to ask Potter for a dance, to touch him openly, to allow the world to see his private affection? What would it be like to ask for so many dances that every person at this festive occasion knew the intentions that Draco Malfoy had for Harry Potter?
Draco gave a rather undignified groan and pulled away. He dressed himself as best as he could while Harry watched from the bed, beautiful and unashamed in his nakedness, a siren tempting him toward the rocky shores.
“Please tell my mother that I am not well. I will receive breakfast here.” He sat at his bureau in his nightshirt and pulled out a quill and a fresh sheet of parchment.
“I shall write to the
“A new visitor, Hermione?” the woman asked with wide eyes. She seemed excited by the prospect.
“Draco, the idea was that we would introduce Miss Astoria to matches of wealth and status so that she would have other advantageous prospects available when you broke the news to her. Miss Lovegood, as delightful as you may find her for reasons I have yet to understand, has neither of those things.”
He gave an insincere chuckle. “Let a gentleman have his secrets, Mrs. Skeeter.”
Potter moved forward to stand next to him. “Hermione’s concern is rooted in our friendship and her care for my well-being. So.” He cleared his throat. “What does it mean coming from you?”
Draco thought, suddenly,
“I am fine,” he said.
Just then, a brown owl flew through the open window, interrupting his brooding with a
“Thank you again. I will try to find him.” Draco left to get a cup of butterbeer, his eyes searching for Potter or anyone else who would not look at him like they would be perfectly happy to murder him on sight. He luckily spotted Miss Lovegood’s golden curls, and began to walk toward her until he felt a pull on his robes. He turned and a boy with green hair looked up at him curiously.
“Her friendship with Harry Potter is her only saving grace. Her family is absolutely mad and always has been.”
, how we wanted him. How he wanted this and so much more.
Part of him wanted to laugh because it was true. Mr. Potter was not subtle whatsoever, and it was one of the reasons he loved him. “It was not my intention to lead him on, but I know that I did.” She said nothing in response, and he was unsure how to move forward. “Should I remove myself as host of the ball? Should I not attend?”
“No,” she said with a frown. “It seems that Miss Clearwater is not quite over Percy Weasley.”
Harry looked up at him and gave that big, beautiful smile that always made Draco’s chest flutter. “Good evening, Mr. Malfoy,” he said.
“Do you think it will? Become widespread, I mean,” Draco said.
As if he sensed his uncertainty, Potter closed the space between them and gave him a soft kiss. “Will we do this again, Mr. Malfoy?”
“He’s a tip-top chess player!” Potter interjected. “He was undefeated in the Gryffindor common room.”
“There was no other choice. You said yourself that I was required to stay there for my protection.”
was too kind of a word for
“First round on me,” Harry responded, while Bernard attempted to get the server’s attention.
Mrs. Malfoy was silent for several moments before she continued. “The truth is that I loved Andromeda very much. I was always closer to her than I was to Bella. Bellatrix had been our parents’ favorite child, and Andromeda and I had each other. But when she met Mr. Tonks… I felt betrayed. A muggle?” She huffed. “We were Blacks, for Merlin’s sake. And Bella latched onto that betrayal and fed off of it, and, well... you know the rest.”
Draco arrived at the front gates of Godric’s Hollow around 10 in the morning. He could see a fine house behind the grate - a bit smaller than the manor, but no less beautiful. The grounds were in full bloom, with luscious trees thick with waxy leaves and colorful flowers lining the path to the front entrance. The gate opened for Draco and he walked up the pathway. The flowers’ aroma wafted toward him, and he wondered if they were charmed to strengthen their perfume when someone passed. When he knocked on the door, he was greeted by a familiar elf.
It seemed as though Mr. Weasley, in Hufflepuff attire, was trying his best to steer clear of Draco. Harry and Draco had not yet discussed living arrangements, but considering the greatness of Harry’s estate and its ties to Harry’s family, Draco assumed that he would join Harry here to live. If so, he supposed he and Mr. Weasley had a lot to do to find common ground. But Draco would not worry about that tonight. That was a problem for Tomorrow’s Draco.
He nodded. “Yes. When I was a boy. Before Great-Aunt Walburga passed.”
“Well,” Draco said, “it took a bit of persuasion, many tears, and a ritual spell performed by the man before you now, but Andromeda Tonks has been reunited with the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, and your godson is now the Malfoy heir.”
He shrugged. “Maybe Miss Astoria does not need an advantageous prospect. Maybe she needs someone good. Someone who would love her for who she is. Which is something I never could have provided her.”
When morning came, he knew his mother would be anxious to discuss the events of the night before, but he did not have the heart to do so. He called for Fitzy.
As the matriarchs took turns discussing their children’s accomplishments as though they were not even in the room, Miss Astoria caught his eye and whispered. “I would like to hear more about your studies sometime.”
“Oh. I am sorry.”
Anger quickly bubbled within him, and he clenched his jaw forcefully in response. Draco had had a temper as a child. He could see now, after years of self-reflection, that he had been spoiled and sheltered and an absolute arse in school. While he had worked to better himself during the last few years, he still found it difficult not to pull out his wand and hex Weasley on the spot. He tried to focus, instead, on the breathing technique he used for occlumency to compartmentalise his annoyance and ire.
Draco smiled; it was a much better reaction than he had expected.
“I know, mama. I know.” He looked down at their entwined hands. “I know what is expected of me. I have already ended things.”
Potter laughed. “You jest!”
“Yes,” she replied. “I am just... surprised. And confused. Do you not plan to have children of your own?”
“Who is it?”
Harry took a trembling breath and then grinned. “I am otherwise engaged tomorrow evening, but I will check my schedule for availability.”
“Draco?” his mother said. She turned to look at him with worry in her eyes. She grabbed his hand. “Take a deep breath, darling.” He did not realise, until she said that, that he had been breathing shallowly. His hands felt clammy. There was sweat at his hairline. She leaned forward to whisper in his ear. “We do not have to do this.” She looked around and huffed, her lips curling in distaste. “We... do not have to do any of this.”
He had expected no consideration from the Wizengamot; Draco knew too well that he and his mother would be rotting in Azkaban if not for one key witness.
The next few days were a flurry of correspondence as invitations to the ball were sent out from the charity office and as the Malfoys, in turn, received their own invitations to an assortment of parties, dinners, and other social engagements. They had not received so many missives since before the Dark Lord’s return, and Draco had never seen his mother so happy.
“Why ever not?”
, for the beta!
“What did you study at school, Mr. Malfoy?” Miss Astoria asked. She looked truly interested and he welcomed her sincerity.
“You two have been so friendly as of late, and if she were not already married, I would absolutely approve.” She began to tick items off of her fingers as she listed them. “She is close friends with Harry Potter, she was on the front lines of the war, she oversees the most talked-about charity in the Wizarding World… she even has an Order of Merlin, First Class!”
“What is this?” Potter asked when he reentered the foyer.
“I am sorry that things did not work out between us,” Draco said, grabbing her gloved hand with his own. “You are a truly wonderful witch, and anyone would be lucky to have you.”
“Allow me,” Draco said, as his wand was still out. He cast a quick
“Of course there was. I
“Oh, what fun,” Potter said. “Does this mean Draco Malfoy will be wearing red and gold?”
, Draco thought with a shiver.
We're over the hump now! Thanks again to 221brosiewilde for the beta and Inkpen4877 for the sensitivity reading.
“Mr. Malfoy, are you able to let us in? Or shall I ring the bell?”
Draco walked down the hall and knocked on his mother’s door. He entered when she responded, and saw Lokey, the lady’s elf, tying a ribbon at the high empire waist of her Pomona green dress robes. It was the first time he had seen her look so exquisite since his father’s death. “You look lovely, mother.”
The moment he sat down, he felt Harry’s foot hook around his ankle. How strange that, even through dragonhide boots, the touch was enough to quicken his pulse. He pressed back and saw Harry smile minutely.
“Draco,” he said with soft admonishment.
He averted his eyes. “Miss Lovegood, I should probably try to sl—”
“We all make mistakes.”
Potter gained on him fairly quickly. Draco moved his body closer to the broom to pick up more speed in response. He had not felt so free, so unburdened since fourth year. There was no other feeling like it.
Potter gestured for Draco to join him before pouring both of them a glass of ale. “I’ve not had that much fun flying in quite some time,” he said.
“Draco Malfoy came to me with the idea of working together because if he and I could put our differences behind us for the greater good, then surely anyone could do the same thing. It has not always been easy, and we have had to face our bitter history more than once, but we stand here together to work toward a more understanding and united Wizarding World. I hope you will join us in that work and tonight as we commence the dancing portion of the evening.”
“What?” she responded, interrupting his appraisal of the room. She wore lavender robes, which complimented her dark skin, and a paisley ribbon was tied at the high waistline under her chest. She wore a small cameo on a gold chain at her neck, and her hands were covered with pristine white gloves.  “Oh. No, you are not interrupting. We seem to have a niffler problem. One has stolen my purse and there was a bit of a chase.” She cleared her throat and closed the door. “And it is Mrs. Granger-Weasley now.”
Draco had seen this display many times before. It was a speciality of Black family women for planning large social events. The lady of the house would create twinkling facsimiles of her vision, and an eager elf would take detailed notes to send out to the appropriate persons. As she continued today’s creation, Draco turned to see wide eyes and slack jaws on both Potter and Mrs. Granger-Weasley. The so-called Brightest Witch of Her Age and Boy Who Lived had both taken part in defeating the most dangerous wizard of their time, yet they were still impressed by a little bit of charms work.
Thankfully, Potter didn’t seem to mind. “At first,” he said. “The house is so large and I had never lived somewhere so grand. When Ron and Hermione were married, I asked them to move to the estate and take the east wing for themselves. It has made it much more bearable.”
“I know.”
“Do not play daft, Draco. Who are you courting? Who is sending you letters?”
Draco looked at his mother, who nodded at him, and he reached forward and opened the gate for the first time in four years. It swung open with a moaning creak. The path stood before him, though it did not seem very welcoming. Still, he offered his arm to Mrs. Malfoy, which she took, and they walked side-by-side up the path until they reached the manor.
Draco cleared his throat and turned to his own paper, rereading the sentence he had just skimmed.
My favorite chapter? Yes!
A minute passed and then the door opened to Kreacher standing before him. “Mr. Draco, it has been so long since Kreacher has seen you.”
He looked at her, his beautiful mother who had always loved him without expectation or condition. Even though his position in life had required him to do and be many things, he knew that her love and support would never waiver. Would it be so wrong for her to know?
“We have been working quite closely on the charity ball. I am sure she will want to know everything about our interview.”
“Darling—”
“I have been at university.”
“May I have the next dance, Miss Lovegood?”
“Not a
“My mother and I are in a townhome on Horizont Alley. In fact, if you are free, you should join us for dinner on Thursday.” Draco thought it best to start working on the other items on his list as well, and his mother would be most pleased.
“I think he is happy. At least, I hope he is. He surrounds himself often with friends and the family he has found along the way.”
“When?” Draco asked.
Draco bid his mother farewell and Apparated to the charity office. Now that he knew he was in the right location, he tried to let himself in. However, the door was locked. He cast a rain shielding charm and tried knocking. “Mr. Potter? Mrs. Granger-Weasley? It’s Draco Malfoy.” He checked his pocket watch again to make sure he had the correct time. What was the name of the other woman who smelled strangely?
“You want all of us to forgive you and your family for your mistakes, and yet you are unable to do so for a man who, no, was not perfect, but who died to protect all of us.”
“Studying the superiority of pure blood, no doubt,” Mrs. Greengrass said in a haughty tone.
“Are those—”
Draco felt an odd sort of warmth in his belly at receiving such a carefree interaction from such an unlikely source. He could not help but think of how different life could have been if Draco had been raised in a normal family. Perhaps he and Mrs. Granger-Weasley would have been friendly rivals at Hogwarts. Or perhaps many evenings shared together in the library would have kindled a real friendship. If he hadn’t have been so ignorantly bound to the duties of his family, his whole life could have turned out so differently.
The plan seemed to be working. By throwing one party on behalf of Harry Potter’s charity, many people seemed perfectly willing to at least sweep the Malfoys’ perilous past under the rug, if not forgive them for it all together. With the right handshakes and promised
Draco took a sip of his coffee and opened the newspaper, his eyes immediately falling below the fold to see, unsurprisingly, that Harry Potter had garnered another headline. His three years in France had been delightfully Potter-free, and, upon seeing the name, he briefly reconsidered his decision to return to England.
,” he responded. “It is tradition.” Even if it had not been tradition for the university’s students to pay their respects at the tomb, Draco would have wished to do so as a fellow Slytherin. “I do recommend a trip if you ever have the chance. It— Well, it changed me.” The words stumbled out of his mouth before he had even realized it, and he was shocked at his own carelessness in revealing his inner thoughts.
“And the heir?”
“Well, I will simply say that I truly do hope that you and Mr. Potter will be happy together. He told us everything you did so that you could be with him, and I can see that for the act of love that I believe it is.” She paused for a moment. “You did, however, hurt him, and so my trust can only go so far. And if you ever hurt him again, this is a reminder that I am a very smart and powerful witch and I promise to make you miserable for as long as you live.”
Voices carried from outside the door, marking their time to part ways.
“We did,” Draco replied. He joined in her tidying and handed her his pile.
There was a cacophony of sound as everyone tried to speak at once, the noise matching the anger rising rapidly within him, but Mrs. Granger-Weasley, unsurprisingly, won out. “Hush,” she said, looking directly at her husband. “Mr. Malfoy is a pureblood of means and influence, and he should absolutely use his status to help out a worthy cause. Not doing so would be wrong.” Then she tilted her head towards Mr. Weasley and whispered, “what is wrong with you?”
It was technically trespassing, but, well, Draco had never cared much for rules that did not benefit him, and Harry himself said that no one ever used the house. He glanced at the floo once more before standing up and heading to the wardrobe. He put on a pair of trousers and a shirt and threw robes over the bare ensemble. He debated whether he would even need shoes, but if he were to be arrested for his deeds, he would prefer to not be barefoot. So he pried on his boots before crossing the room.
“Malfoy?” Potter asked, tilting his head.
“Oh,” Potter said. He shrugged but his cheeks were tinted pink. “They are my family. If you had a brother or sister, would you not call them by their given names? We started in childhood and, after everything we have been through, it feels too formal, too detached now. We use formalities in public, but not around friends.”
“Yes, I do. Just not for easy spells.”
Potter nodded. “She is a very caring person and a wonderful grandmother. She has kindly welcomed my presence in Teddy’s life.”
Draco himself was wearing garnet-coloured dress robes, lined with buttons shaped like the heads of lions, and his gold, silk waistcoat was woven with garnet brocade.
“Scared, Malfoy?” he asked with a grin.
Potter stood and came towards him, pointing a finger toward his chest. “You’re being unfair.”
have known it. Potter kept to his very small circle, and he certainly did not seem interested in Weasel or Longbottom.
He said his goodbyes to Miss Astoria and rushed to the invitation shop to meet his mother and Mrs. Granger-Weasley.
” Her question was so shocking that it knocked him backward into his seat. Him? And her?
A cloud of soft light emerged from the stone beneath their palms. The forest began to awaken to the sound of a low hum — trees standing taller and flower buds peeking from the soil. Draco heard Miss Lovegood gasp behind him, and he looked up to see dozens of fairies rousing from slumber to come closer, their tiny bodies vibrating with delighted anticipation. Small bubbles of light popped into existence and began to drift around them in a lazy dance.
Draco nodded, unsure of what else to say.
“She sat me down with parchment and a pencil and told me that she was going to teach me to read and write. I panicked, knowing that I was not allowed to do such a thing, and I thought that she may be playing a nasty trick, as my cousin often did to me. But then she took my hand to calm me.” He gave a sad chuckle. “No one had ever held my hand before. The only touch I had ever received was a slap or a punch or a shove. Sometimes my aunt would grab me by the ear to throw me into my cupboard if she was especially displeased with me.”
“That terrible, hm?” she asked.
“Mr. Malfoy?” There was a hand at his shoulder nudging him. “Mr. Malfoy.” Draco was still on his knees, and when he looked up, he saw Miss Lovegood standing before him. “Are you alright? So much time has passed that I became worried that something had happened.” She looked around. “Where is Mr. Potter?”
“It is his first time here, Madam Joylove,” Miss Lovegood said with a warm smile.
), surely there were worse matches? Draco took a deep breath to calm his nerves and did his best to return her smile, but was immediately interrupted by her mother’s obnoxious squealing.
As the party came to a close, Draco sat on a bench near the garden. The sun was still in the sky, but it was nearing twilight.  It was quieter here and it allowed him to catch his breath from the day’s activities. At least, that had been his plan.
“Oh, no. I have a few distant cousins throughout Europe who can worry about populating the earth with more spoiled purebloods.”
He shook his head. “It does not matter now.”
“Draco—“
He turned toward Potter’s friend. “Mrs. Granger-Weasley, I have curated a list of books for you as requested.”
“Unfair? The Wizarding World has built monuments to a man who let its saviour needlessly suffer as a child and continuously put him in harm’s way as an adolescent.” Draco laughed incredulously. “This is the man our society lauds and mourns.”
“Are you sure we should not write them, dear?” asked Mrs. Malfoy.
“May I get you some more tea?”
“She is not,” Potter replied, pulling Draco’s attention back to the conversation. “And those witches do not even know who I am.” Potter poured himself a cup of tea.
“Yes, but I cannot get the country air there.” The excuse sounded thin to his own ears, so he would not expect Mrs. Granger-Weasley to believe him.
“Oh, I see. Well, I am sure Draco would be happy to take care of any statements or interviews on your behalf.”
“Mr. Draco,” he said with a bow. “Kreacher is happy to see you.”
Draco swallowed down a small ping of guilt, knowing very well that his relationship with Potter, whatever that might have been, was advantageous to his end goals. He instead tried to focus on the very good, very real feelings that being with Potter brought him, how his chest had constricted every time Potter had given him that bright, gorgeous grin. It felt too raw, too vulnerable to share any of that with Hermione Granger-Weasley, so he gave her the sincerest smile he could.
. Our history is tangled and messy and has been since our first night at Hogwarts. Ignoring that cannot be wise, and does not even seem possible. It would only make matters worse in the long run.”
“Are you well, Miss Lovegood?”
Vinxy filled Draco’s coffee cup while he filled his own plate. He waited for his mother to say something, anything, about the other day, but she did not. She seemed quite happy to ignore it, and for the sake of the day’s future success, he decided to do the same.
Potter gave him a brilliant smile. “Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. I do appreciate it.”
“Yes, I swear it! I did not even think about it when I let you borrow it. I thought that Ron may not take too kindly to letting you borrow his broom, so I lent you mine. I am sorry,” he responded. However when he saw Draco’s face, no doubt with a sullen expression, he started to laugh.
