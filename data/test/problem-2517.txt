“Fine, go tell your boss to send someone else,” Draco urged.
“No, we can’t,” agreed Harry.
"There's no point," Harry urged, his voice breaking. "I don't give a fuck about them, so can we please stop talking about it?"
Draco brought his gaze back to her and gave a nod though his eyes were still cloudy with his previous thoughts. With that, she turned away and snapped into thin air.
A mildly disheveled woman pulled open the door. She must have been the one tending the garden because there was a speck of dirt on her brow, her blond waves pulled back into a halfhazard knot on her head. Harry couldn’t help but compare her to a younger Mrs. Weasley.
Harry slowly looked back at Malfoy, who had reopened his book and was staring down at the words – he couldn’t actually make himself read any of them. “You wanna talk?” Harry asked.
Despite what Hermione might have to say on the matter, Harry was convinced that hearts could quite literally break. His certainly did. That was the one thing he was most afraid of hearing.
Everything in Draco wanted to believe that, but somewhere deep down, he knew he couldn’t be so sure. So he decided to hold onto what he had for now. With their fingers intertwined and the Dark Mark on full view, they both eventually faded off into sleep.
This kiss was long and steady. It was the seal of their promise to not go anywhere.
“Wait, they weren’t dating already?” said Justin Finch-Fletchley.
“He knows he’s a gi- Ah!” Malfoy had flipped them over in Harry’s distraction and was now stuffing leaves into every pocket or opening on Harry’s body.
Harry chuckled as he hugged her back. “The good thing is, I don’t change much.”
“Perfect,” Harry assured. He started to lead Draco towards the sitting room.
He could feel Potter’s glances here and there for the rest of the period but ignored them. If Potter was going to judge him for being nice then he could go right ahead. He didn’t care what he thought. It didn’t matter what anyone thought really.
Harry threw his hands in to the air. “Well, I saved you a trip.”
“Can I have a word―alone?” he spoke sharply, tossing a glare at the two girls and boy who he totted around with him.
Harry swallowed. “I told him,” he said meekly.
Draco swallowed hard. There was that fearsome witch — the one who was once all brain but panicked under pressure. Any timid nature she once had washed away long ago. The war had hardened her, just like many others, and he did not believe for one second that she was bluffing.
It looked like Malfoy was going to agree, but he frowned when Harry went to pick up the cookware he had picked out. He turned to Kreacher. "Where are your wine glasses?"
Without the usual five o'clock rush, it didn't take long to get a Floo home. However, the instant he stepped out of the fireplace in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, he considered turning right back around and taking up Ron's offer. Having awkward small talk with a stranger sounded much more enjoyable than hanging around this place.
“If it’s any consolation, you being here makes me happy too.”
Harry offered a hasty apology before snatching Ron’s arm to drag him to a less populated section of the alley. “Draco and I don’t have anything,” he said in a rushed whisper pulling them to a stop again, “we’re just friends.”
Draco nodded wordlessly.
ruined his reputation? I’m pretty sure that mark you put on his arm ruined his reputation. You allowing a madman into your house around your wife and son ruined his reputation. Your cowardice ruined his reputation. The only thing I have done is love your son and tried to put back the pieces you broke.”
“Dating!” Heather corrected. “The term is dating and you are lucky no one else is in here right now.” She narrowed her eyes at Pansy who simply smirked in return.  “For a witch you aren’t very discrete.”
Malfoy flipped another page, not looking up. “Get your drunk arse out of my business.”
Malfoy shrugged. “It’s not his style.” His eyes fell down to the sheets as he fiddled with a loose thread. “He doesn’t care about people enough to bother making it personal.”
“We have to stop.”
Harry had already assumed that much. He smiled. “Yeah, anytime.”
It seemed, to Malfoy at least, that Harry hadn't thought about the words coming out of his mouth at all. The young Auror turned and walked back down the hall the way he came, a muffled snap sounding from the stairwell the moment he walked through the door.
Harry’s gaze returned to the mark and began to smooth his finger over the shape. It felt just as smooth as the rest of his skin. With one trace around the mark, Draco felt his muscles ease a fraction. Harry did it again, and he relaxed a little more. Again. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut.
I can't unpack the baggage you left..."
Ron fiddled with his thumbnail, his expression impassive. “Do you want to share a bed with him?”
A grating noise not unlike an airy snort came out of Draco’s mouth. “I do not snore!”
“A tad.” Harry shrugged. “It doesn’t bother me. He did what he had to in order to save everyone. It’s not as if he was making me do something that he wouldn’t,” he glanced carefully at the boy beside him, “after all, he did the same.”
Heather soon arrived with their drinks. “It’s a slow day. If you wait around long enough, maybe we can all go to lunch together.”
The ball in Draco’s throat bobbed. His eyes were glued to the shoulder, which obstructed his path. “Just let it be, Potter,” he said so quietly that Harry nearly couldn’t hear it. “Things don’t have to change.”
He raised his wand, prepared to cast a
Harry hung up his cloak then brought his bag to the dining table. "I needed some fresh air to think about this case," he said. It wasn't a complete lie. That had been his original reasoning. He had just ended up outside of Allure when he decided to take the longer route.
“Oh?”
“Be with?” Harry exclaimed. Harry snapped his head around, spotting as a young mother sent him a venomous glare as she passed with her pre-Hogwarts aged child. He lowered his voice and leaned closer. “I’m not
“I haven’t done anything!” Harry exclaimed. He threw his arm at the door. “Malfoy came after me!”
“Very well, I’ll get a second cot set up.” She pulled out her wand again and transfigured the chair that Hermione had been sitting on into another cot. “Someone will be doing rounds around midnight. I’ll let them know you’ll be having an overnight visitor. I’ll see you both in the morning.”
“I’ll be back,” he mumbled.
“We don’t have enough pounds for the extra fee. Either you go get it, or you go to Gringotts for currency exchange.”
A sneer began to form on Malfoy's lip. To lump James and Lily Potter's deaths with such a common, muggle way to go was almost vulgar – no matter what side of the war one was on. He didn't interrupt, letting Harry continue. "It was mostly so I could cook for them."
"And I'd be the one who has to arrest her for hurting muggles!"
Harry was a little taken aback by the determination in Malfoy's eyes. He'd seen it before, of course. Times when he was trying to one-up Harry in school, but it never ended well for him. Still, he never gave up.
Robards shrugged. “He must have gotten a lead on Macnair being there. Whatever it was, it was right. He found him. Some of the locals found both of them knocked out in the streets after hearing some commotion, which you know is unusual. Usually, whoever made the last blow is still standing, or at least conscious.”
Zabini ignored him and sat on the edge of the bed. “It’s always been Draco. I was just scared.”
“That’s a very interesting bird there,” she said, eyeing the creation in front of him.
“Malfoy.”
They believed in second chances. They didn’t hate just to hate. More than anything, Draco wished he could be brave enough to meet this person. Maybe, just maybe, they’d understand.
It was only after some needling that Neville finally told those who had not been there the previous year that it was the anniversary of when the Carrows started making them torture students. There were rumors that some who had not returned still had permanent nerve damage. Harry quickly understood why Draco didn’t want to talk about it.
"What about Dray?" Harry questioned. Draco glared at him out of the corner of his eye. It only made Harry smile. He leaned forward on his elbows. "Come on,
Draco made another harsh sound, but this one was mixed with a laugh. “Sod off.”
“Whoa, wait!” Harry exclaimed, taking the papers from Draco. “That’s my case.”
Harry dropped back into the chair with a huff, petulantly crossing his arms over his chest. “He deserved it. Where does he get off talking like that?”
“Wait, Draco,” Harry pleaded, sitting up. “I didn’t mean to– That wasn’t meant as–“
However, Draco’s stranger had to be somewhere in this room. Very few eighth-years had chosen not to take Charms. If Draco wanted to make any changes that they would notice then it should be here.
Malfoy started to shake his head rapidly, his breathing coming out even faster. He let out a whimpering noise and twisted his fingers deeper into his scalp.
Harry gave him a pleading look. Maybe it would help if more people came along. It would feel less awkward. Less like they had an unwelcome spare added to their trio. “Hannah, Neville, you too. Come on, it’s nice out.”
Without a thought, he hurried to one of the Floos and went to Grimmauld.
Harry’s head snapped up. He was only halfway finished with untucking the blankets―the house-elves always did it so tight―but ultimately left it in favor for Draco. This conversation had been eating at him all day. He never realized how reserved Slytherins could be when they put their mind to it.
He still couldn't go more than a few blocks from the flat, and he was always looking over his shoulder when they did go out. Harry was happy that he could at least see some of the old Malfoy confidence shining through when they were alone.
"He could have followed you home."
“I testified because he was innocent. I can’t be punished for doing the right thing.”
Ginny continued to glare after Ron. Molly pulled on a smile. “Well, you’re welcome to a seat wherever you can find one. Lunch will be ready soon.”
Harry sat up. “It’s fairly late. I won’t be able to stay long.”
“Almost two weeks ago,” Draco answered without hesitation, surprising Harry that he remembered the exact date. For him, all the days had simply been mushed together, simultaneously making it feel like it was only yesterday and also years ago.
“You should know,” Harry said softly, “he knew you wouldn’t do it. He wanted it to be Snape. It was the only way Voldemort would trust him.”
“It’s Luna. She's always positive,” Harry reminded, a crooked smile climbing his mouth. “Maybe you shouldn't be so pessimistic. She did find an actual Squonk, though I don’t know if finding it really did anyone any favors. Aunt Marge is prettier than that thing, and I didn’t think that was possible.”
Terry shook his head slowly. “Not cured. I’m still working on it. I’ll probably always be working on it, which is why I’m happy you’re here. Forgiveness helps with healing.” He crossed his arms in a self-hug. “I know Malfoy had nothing to do with Caleb’s death and I’ve wanted to apologize somehow but I couldn’t think of the right thing to say. I think telling you who took the pictures, or at least who told them where to go, could suffice.”
"Oh! I, er," she giggled gleefully, "I just found out I got accepted into the medical program at Queen Mary's."
Harry rolled his eyes but a smirk played on his lips. He sat up and turned to face Draco, his smile widening. “I rather use my saintliness to get something else.”
“Everett! Edgar!” Just as Harry was about to lose his control, a blond woman rushed towards them with her arms held out. By her equally curly locks, Harry assumed she was their mother. A man with straighter darker hair like the other boy was not far behind. “Where have you been?” the woman demanded. “What have we said about running off without telling us where you’re going?”
"If I don't get called into work, we should go shopping tomorrow," Harry said.
“Yeah,
Harry wasn’t surprised the child who he’d never met hadn’t recognized him the dim shadows which seemed to forever loom over Knockturn Alley. However, he didn’t appreciate having his name yelled so loudly.
Pansy’s eyes became the size of bludgers. She started to open her mouth but clamped it shut the second she saw the dark look coming off of Draco.
Draco’s eyes became the size of bludgers, his mouth falling open. The only thing he could manage was a weak, “Oh….”
Harry sat back, feeling mild accomplishment for simply getting Malfoy to look up. “So, do you want to come?”
“I can’t believe it actually took this long,” rebuked Michael.
“I stopped worrying about him,” she whimpered. “He looked like he was doing better. I’m supposed to notice these things.”
Harry tilted his head, silently prodding him.
Harry responded with something that sounded somewhat like a goodnight as well. Pleased with this response, Malfoy began to leave. “Thank you, ‘Foy.”
“But it’s Potter, he’s not a-”
A warm blush budded across Draco’s cheeks. He looked down at the boxes. “Don’t be dramatic. It’s only food.”
Kreacher had outdone himself with several options, including stew, some sort of pasta dish, and a full ham. Harry was really stifling his abilities by never eating at the house anymore. The pair sat together at the end of the long table, filling their plates and chatting like they usually did.
“Your stance is off today,” Draco noted just as a stone skipped once before dropping into the murky waters.
Malfoy turned back to the dishes, waving a hand behind him. "Go get cleaned up. You're filthy."
“Mum, shush, it’s just Professor Potter,” whined Marina Oakwood from her mother’s elbow. “Let him shop in peace.” Harry couldn’t help but smile at that. He’d half to remember to thank the Ravenclaw when school started up again.
"You didn't kill anyone, Malfoy," Harry insisted. That had been the main point of his argument during the trial. Malfoy had never actually killed anyone. He didn't have blood on his hands.
He had done so. For several years, Draco had managed to keep it hidden and read in secret. He would follow the little white rabbit down the hole and join the tea party every night, arriving only as late as the rabbit. Sometimes Dobby would even read with him or help him act out certain scenes. Dobby was always a strange elf, he was so happy to play with his young master.
." Harry noticed the way Draco's lip twitched as he forcefully tried to remain upset. "Dray? Come on, you like it. I can tell."
Zabini regulated his features. “You are the savior, but we both know that evil byproducts like him don’t count. Clearly, he’s delusional. You really should make better friends, Potter. Trust me, you may have influence today, but it can go just as quickly down the drain tomorrow no matter how much good you’ve done. Having a stain like him around is only going to hurt you.”
Why did it have to be him? Why Draco Malfoy?
Ron and Neville loosened their grip on Harry but Ron mumbled for him to take a breath outside with him. Harry nodded numbly, his eyes still fixed on the crowd of Aurors. They started to walk away when Corbis snapped, “A Death Eater has your friend brainwashed and you’re just gonna stand around watch it happen? He could be raping him for all you know.”
The moment he turned around he froze. His eyes were the size of bludgers, just like the ones Harry remembered this very man batting his way at full force. It was certainly Greggory Goyle. His height had leveled out just below Harry’s but he remained far too muscular to be a comfortable match.
Warning: Brief talk of eating disorders
“Deserve…” George said quietly. His gaze drifted to the covered mirror.
George skimmed him again. “Are you saying it’s not true? You looked pretty cozy with Malfoy.”
“W- What?”
“I can’t help but stop when I pass here too,” a voice spoke up. It was Neville. He had a sad smile as he joined Harry in front of the memorial. “Seven years… Do you think it’s ever going to stop hurting?”
Andromeda rolled her eyes, turning back to the stove as the kettle began to whistle. “Milk? Sugar?”
"Most of them are snakes," Ron added, pulling on his cloak.
“It’s not my fault you worry so much. I have told you repeatedly not to. I’m okay here.”
What the hell was he doing?
“Well…” He glanced nervously at the other Aurors around him. When no one would speak up, he continued. “We’re just concerned, you see. You haven’t eaten or drank something strange?”
“Of course you are, Healer
“Where are you going?”
Pansy took the mug from her face, a cream mustache staying behind, and nodded her head profusely. Heather giggled in delight. Harry started to point out the white mark on her face, but Draco sent him a quelling look. He shut his mouth, pressing his lips together as he tried not to laugh.
After a few purchases, Harry walked back through the Leaky Cauldron into the streets of London. It wasn’t a bad day for a walk.
Malfoy's eyes went wide with utter horror. "No!" he bellowed. "I didn't kill anyone!" His shoulders fell, and his eyes suddenly became distant as if he was no longer there but somewhere else far away that Harry couldn't see. "At least… not directly…"
Draco gave a mediocre shrug, his eyes lingering on the steaming drink between his hands. “She considered us living together sufficient enough.”
Shaky air fell out of Draco's lips before he sucked in a deep breath and tried to correct his breathing. He straightened and turned to Harry again, who didn't stop rubbing his leg. "So, we were talking about your horrible snogging."
"It hasn't even been a week!"
Finally, she returned to the chair she’d been sitting in beside Harry and clasped his hand more tightly. “He’s just going to the office. He doesn’t need me.”
Harry felt his stomach plummet. Apparently, he hadn't picked the best conversation starter.
Robards skimmed the man’s face, looking for answers but only found the old stubborn glare he hadn’t at all missed from his most reckless Auror. Something definitely happened, but he wasn’t the type to meddle in personal lives. “Fine, desk work only until you’re cleared. If you step one toe out of this office other than to go take a shit, you’re out of here. Understood?”
The door opened. Harry stood there with a strained expression. His breathing was still uneven, but he looked calmer than before.
“I’m happy for them,” Harry urged, noting the shortness of Draco’s tone. “I’m happy for all of them. I just wish I could be that happy. I wish I wasn’t always souring the mood - grumpy old Potter sitting in the corner, dulling the party.”
Lips against his neck sent a shiver down his spine. “I wasn’t talking about breakfast.”
Harry only answered with a shrug and did his best Hermione impression by becoming suddenly interested in his textbook―possibly for the first time that year. He did his best to pay attention to the rest of the lesson, but he would be lying if he said he did not take any opportunity to throw a glare or two Zabini’s way. He didn’t know what happened, but it had to be his fault.
Really, it was all so stupid. The only upside was that there were twenty people who felt all variations of the same way. It had been Seamus who had been the first to pop, ranting in the common room to Dean and Neville about how if one more third-year tried to corner him in the loo, he would give him a first-hand demonstration of how he had blown up the bridge.
Harry frowned at their hands. “So are you,” he insisted. “Why do you let them talk to you like that? If I had…” but Harry didn’t finish once again, not wanting to think about their younger crueler selves.
This kiss was not like either of the priors. It was not short, but it also wasn’t as ravenous as the last. They kissed slowly. Neither dared take a breath, letting their lungs ache, and lips bruise, trying to make it last longer. Both tried to take in every moment and every movement with as much attention to detail as possible. If this would be the final of their few kisses, they needed to commit it to memory as accurately as possible.
“Petty?” Goyle roared. “My best friend is dead. My father was sent to Azkaban. All the while the Malfoys walk free. It’s not petty!
Still, it was better for them this way. At least he didn't have the same problems as many other Aurors who had to go home to their significant others and couldn't tell them anything that was going on at work – and their job was certainly the type to follow one home.
“It’s me, it’s me,” Harry assured, his voice gruff as he clasped his head, trying to steady his thoughts.
“Draco!” Harry tried again.
Harry snorted and unfolded himself. He was halfway to his feet when he reached out to pinch Malfoy’s arm. Malfoy swatted him, and Harry tried once more until they were both trying to prod at one another. Harry chuckled as he finally jumped out of reach. “Come on, let’s go to bed.”
It wasn't like he was trying to defend the Dursleys. Although he would never actively pursue it, he didn't think he would blink twice if they all died. He knew they didn't treat him right, but he also didn't like talking about it. Not even those closest to him really knew about his childhood.
“Really, Mr. Hatch?” George said from Harry’s side as if he was talking to an old friend who’d made a stupid joke. “I’ve had to reset my anti-theft hexes at least three times this summer because of those two.” He gestured at Everett and Edgar. “You can’t actually be surprised they ventured into Knockturn, can you? My parents certainly weren’t when my brother and I did it.”
Harry chuckled, the thought of them ever not being okay seeming ridiculous. "Always."
“Yes, thank you,” Harry nodded rapidly. “I’ll let you know as soon as I’ve made a decision.”
“Right, because that’s so much better!”
It was official. Harry was about an inch away from the end of his rope. If it were the old days, Harry might have started throwing hexes right about now. Currently, he was considering grabbing a pillow to throw. “In English, please? Not everyone speaks neurotic narcissist.”
The ‘office’ wasn’t really an office. It had desks but they were hardly used. It was primarily a large cleaning supply room. Shelves lined the walls with various solvents that cleaned all types of magical and non-magical messes. Mops and non-flying brooms were hung up as well. Harry moved aside the cart in front of the door which was boggled down by several vibrantly colored bottles and a few other cleaning tools Harry didn’t recognize.
Harry blinked rapidly. A meeting. What meeting was going on right now? Then, for a moment, he remembered where he actually was. He was lightheaded from his heavy breath, but he knew he needed to get out of there.
Malfoy made a sharp noise and rolled his eyes. “Are you offering up yours, Potter? How selfless.” Harry noticed his shoulders loosen only slightly although the tendons in his hands became less defined.
Only once the door was closed did he finally look at her to hiss, "Can't you use the front door, or possibly knock?"
Harry’s smile matched almost exactly, a completely involuntary reaction to the joy bubbling up in his chest. “I shouldn’t have sprung that on you.”
Harry shoved off the stone and closed the gap in one step, his wand in his hand in a flash.
Normally, such a statement might have put Harry off, but Malfoy was too good at finding his buttons, and Harry was almost just as good at ignoring it when it came from him. “You said later.”
” beneath it. A cold chill ran down his body.
Harry shrugged and took the firewhiskey bottle that appeared once more. “Dunno.”
Malfoy leaned his head back over the back of the couch, frowning at the other man. "You already got food? We didn't even decide what restaurant to go to today."
room? You’re never in there.”
Jumbled words slithered past Malfoy’s tight lips as he crossed his arms, but Harry didn’t catch any of them. He didn’t have time to ask as Malfoy said something else. “It’s a rule of mine not to accept an invite to get drunk in front of all of my classmates. You never know their intentions.”
Harry's eyes became the size of bludgers, his mouth falling agape. However, his offended expression became ruined as he struggled to keep the smile off his face. "Oh, really!"
"No, but he is sorry for it."
A smile spread across Harry’s face at the word ‘boyfriend’ before he could even attempt to restrain it. Harry crinkled his nose and made a soft, discontent noise as he stepped closer. Draco noticed it and looked up just before Harry wrapped his arms around him. “I think I rather have something else for dinner.”
A cold chill fell over the room. Harry suddenly desperately wished he had had some way to warn Draco to stay away a little longer.
“Is that all this is? Repaying a debt?”
Harry’s jaw locked. “Yes.”
“There is,” crooned Zabini, whose voice sent an instant chill through both of the standing boys. All eyes shot to the snake halfway up the stairs, which rarely deigned to leave his dorm to spend any time in the common area. He was likely on his way down to the dungeons.
Harry followed his lead and was soon swallowed by his own sheets. He was still fully clothed, but Malfoy’s generosity only went so far. At the very least, he reached down and took off Harry’s glasses to set aside. “You’re a menace, Potter.”
Harry was in the middle of a conversation about what the Quidditch Cup lineup would likely be when a noticeable volley of whispers came over Gryffindor table. He might have regularly ignored it had he not heard a throat clearing nearby. He looked up. Blaise Zabini stood just behind his friends, his features smoothed into apathy.
Harry stepped out first. Malfoy followed.
Harry's eyes snapped up. He scanned Malfoy's expression, searching for any hidden anxiety. He could see the tightness in his jaw but no true uncertainty. "Are you sure?" he asked as a last attempt. They were having a nice day; he didn't want to try to push Malfoy too much.
“Wait!” Harry reached out and snatched the sleeve of Malfoy’s robe. When Malfoy turned around, he likely expected Harry to release him, but Harry’s fingers only twisted deeper into the cloth.
Harry didn’t respond, continuing to approach. Draco’s heart was pounding in his ears. He stepped back only to back himself into the wall. One step to the left and he could slip away into the bedroom, he knew that. However, despite his words at Grimmauld, Draco wanted this just as much as Harry. He’d been a bit surprised that the notoriously stubborn Saint Potter had actually given in with such little argument. There was a moment when Draco assumed that Harry wasn’t actually as interested as Draco was. The look in Harry’s eyes now flattened all of those doubts.
"Is that a yes? You'll be an informant."
Harry flashed him a smile even as Malfoy fervently flattened his hair back into place.
Draco attempted to curb his smile, but it turned into a grin nonetheless. Harry completely melted. His heart was still hammering, but it wasn't from anger anymore.
The books tumbled out of Draco’s grasp. The careful calm he’d woven over himself throughout the day and hid behind distractions suddenly crumbled. “How?”
. We’ll get you out of this too.”
Draco’s pinched expression began to release. “You didn’t send him.” He wasn’t sure whether to be shocked that Ron came to the flat of his own volition, that he meant what he said, or that Harry wasn’t the one who sent him. The last one bubbled to the surface quickest. “You didn’t even
"Not directly!" Malfoy exclaimed. "I didn't do anything to him. I'm just the easiest person to blame."
“I wasn’t fired. I quit.”
Harry shook his head profusely. “It means a lot to her. It means a lot to all of us.”
Harry leveled a look on the man. Normally, Harry tried to show the man a great margin of respect – he reminded him greatly of a tired combination of Dumbledore and Lupin – however he wasn’t about to sit through more slander if that’s what he had planned. “It’s really none of anyone’s business who I snog,” he said tersely.
Harry waited for Draco to respond. For a moment he wondered if he’d already fallen asleep somehow until, “Well don’t leave me on the edge of my seat.”
“As a visitor, yes,” Draco nodded, “but I don’t think I could live there. Too many tourists.”
This didn’t deter Harry at all. He dropped his elbows onto his knees to lean closer. “Can you draw me something?”
"Are we okay then?"
"I need people on real problems like actual dark witches and wizards. I was hoping you could be one of those people for me unless you rather chase down nonsense and send people who have not yet gotten a fair trial to Azkaban. If that is the case, then maybe you should go home early. I don't need trouble in my department today."
“But Harry, it’s
"Aw," Malfoy hummed, pulling on a sarcastic smile as he looked back at Harry, "it would be like having a guard dog out here. Then again, I don't think I'd let my dog sleep on the furniture if I had one. It's far too expensive."
"Oh," Malfoy's face began to fall, "well if you ever want to go out instead of coming here, you can just tell me."
She shook her head profusely. “No, it’s good I’m here. I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t seen it.” She smiled sadly, her eyes distant. “I’ve never seen him that comfortable before, not even with me. If this is what he wants then we should support it. He’s our family,” she looked at George who readjusted the baby in his arms. “We’ve lost enough,” her gaze moved to Andromeda, “so has he. We don’t have any right to take this away. I just hope he’s not denying it for our sake.”
The grounds of Hogwarts soon thawed, and life began to happen outside the castle once again. The pair were soon taking up quidditch again. It felt different now. The competition was still there, but they tended to goof off more than before. Sometimes they didn’t even bring a snitch and would simply fly around the castle.
“Potter!”
Hermione shrugged as if to say,
Harry shrugged. "Is there a wine for that? I can do it if you want. It may take a while."
"Malfoy's different."
They stumbled apart in front of the fireplace of the drawing-room. Harry shook out the uncomfortable, residual feeling of apparition - it was the main reason he preferred the Floo or walking to Malfoy's.
"To a restaurant or a pub, or anywhere really," Harry declared, working open the front door.
Harry thought back to only a few minutes before when he’d been too distracted by playing wizard’s chess with Draco to notice the time ― he’d bought the board when getting some potion ingredients for Draco a few days ago. “Sorry, I didn’t notice the time.”
Draco shook his head. “Mother was too ashamed of her blood traitor sister.” Draco glanced nervously at Harry. “Obviously she’s gotten over that. However, I don’t blame Andromeda for being bitter. I can’t imagine what it must have been like to leave.” He began to pick at his sleeve, momentarily becoming disappointed when he found the smooth cotton of his button down instead of the woven wool he was used to wearing around the flat. His mind returned back to the topic at hand. “It couldn’t have been easy. Even her aunt burned her off of the family tree. I would hate any reminders of that life as well.”
Lucius slid a glare towards Harry, as if prepared to agree to take this outside. Harry didn’t think he’d be able to walk away. Dueling Lucius Malfoy would certainly be an acceptable place to direct his anger. However, Robards spotted it as well, “Later,” he pressed. “Right now, I need to speak to Potter.” He turned to the patrolmen. “Please escort Mr. Malfoy out. Come with me, Potter.”
Harry’s eyes shot open wide and now it was his turn to match his robes. “I’m not- We aren’t- I don’t-”
She looked at the overly folded piece of parchment for a moment before saying in an astute tone, “I think it looks like a Blibbering Humdinger.”
"Fine, go on," Draco sighed. "But you should know I'll be waiting up to make sure you eat something, so don't take too long."
A long sigh left Pansy’s lips as she dragged her arms around the man’s thin frame, hugging his back against her chest. She rested her cheek against his shoulder. “He’ll be back.”
“I already do,” he gave her a perplexed look, “it’s what Draco calls you in his letters. I’ll admit, I assumed for a while that he he was taking about a different Harry. I never would have dreamed...” She fell silent, her eyes assessing her surroundings once more. “I suppose I really shouldn’t be surprised actually. He always did like taking about you. Drove Lucius mad.”
It didn’t even appear too forced when Ron nodded. In an instant, Harry’s light heart became weightless.
She started to lead him towards the door and he allowed her for a few steps until he remembered that he wasn’t there alone. He paused and looked back at Draco. He hesitated. He knew Draco wouldn’t be comfortable with so many people around but he wasn’t sure how to go about comforting him when so many people would be watching. Holding his arm like usual would likely elicit more attention rather than have the opposite effect.
In the corner of the room, he spotted Potter, Weasley, and Granger. Granger was behaving similarly to Draco, at least making an effort to look productive, but Potter and Weasley seemed to think they knew the charm well enough to not need extra practice. Seeing them set a low simmer to Draco’s blood.
After their meal, Draco used minimal persuasion to talk Harry into going back to the flat with him. They walked. The rare, dry London night provided a unique opportunity. They listened to the rumble of the city. Cars slushing through the damp streets. Distant sirens. The muffled sound of a guitar paired with a deep voice from inside a lounge they passed.
There was a clamor as Harry’s knight began to beat down one of Ron’s bishops.
Harry hesitated but gradually lowered his hands. The moment they were in his lap, Malfoy punched his arm. “You liar!”
Harry could feel all of the hot tension disappear in his body instantly as he gaped at Draco. “Wait, I-“
"I don't leave," Malfoy finally said.
It seemed Draco had caught on to his thoughts because his eyes flickered to Harry’s lips. This was the only permission he needed. He leaned forward.
Moving in was actually a welcomed distraction. They weren’t going to sleep separately on the two twin beds of the room Harry once occupied so instead they moved the master bedroom. Harry actually laughed when he saw how disturbed Draco was by the smell of barn animals in the room. He almost considered not telling Draco that it was due to Buckbeak occupying the room. Of course, this launched a whole other discussion about their third-year.
"What happened? You didn't find him?"
They glanced at Skeres, who could only move his eyes. He glared at Malfoy as if he was attempting to perform a wordless, wandless Avada Kedavra.
“And you played quidditch with him,” Ron added, a twinge of hurt still pulling down at the end of his words. The very public game of quidditch between the Chosen One and the ex-Death Eater had been all over the school. Ron had known about it before Harry had even gotten back up to the common room. He had seemed more upset that he hadn’t asked Ron to play with him first rather than who else he’d gone with. Only Hermione was truly concerned, even more so after he told them what had happened.
Harry dropped his hand which still lingered in Draco’s hair. He snaked both arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him closer. “I guess something about you just makes me
"It's not supposed to," Malfoy snapped, turning back to him. "It's why I moved into a damn muggle apartment in the first place. I don't know how he found out where I lived."
“That would be much appreciated,” she said. “Now, I won’t keep you any longer.”
Draco fed them another response and kept up the banter, but he couldn’t stop thinking about the first part of the letter.
“Please don’t tell me you’re holding back because you’re scared what we’ll think, right?” Ron urged. “We aren’t the Blacks. You’re our family, we wouldn’t-” He shook his head like he was still in shock. “We wouldn’t do that to you.”
Draco spun around. Harry was jogging out towards him. He frowned. “Go back inside with your friends.” He looked away, not daring to show his face right now. “I’m just getting some air.”
“When don’t I?”
It was strange to see Potter in the library. Occasionally he’d spot him there with Granger and Weasley, likely forced by the former to study, but never alone.
His suspensions satisfied, Harry got to his feet. “I could honestly kiss you right now.”
He hit his head back against the table when he looked up. A hiss of pain left his mouth as he clasped the back of his skull. His wide, panicked eyes stared wildly up at Malfoy. For a split second, Malfoy considered putting up a shield charm. He understood now why Kreacher was ordered to protect himself against wizards.
“What? Why-”
“Shouldn’t you at least figure out what is that he wants before you start threatening people?” Zabini said in a low rush. Harry stopped. “How you are any better than me if you’re just going to bat away all of your rivals before they even get to him? At least give him a choice.”
A slow, predatory smile stretched across Harry's lips as he raised his brows in challenge. "Oh, I really need to speak to Narcissa."
He closed the fridge and looked over at Malfoy, who was looking back at him over the back of the sofa. "I can go pick something up if you want. Or we can go to that café around the corner that we saw the other day," he suggested haphazardly. His eyes flicked across the other man's face, realizing too late what he had said. Malfoy's face had fallen, his jaw tensing. "I'll just go pick something up," Harry urged. "What do you feel like today?"
When Harry got to Grimmauld, he was greeted by Kreacher as always. Kreacher almost looked delighted when Harry said he'd be staying in today. The elf hurried off to start dinner as Harry pulled himself up to his bedroom.
It was almost true. Harry’s homicidal tendencies went away once Draco was at his side. However, Zabini’s words never completely vanished. It continued to muddle his thoughts well into the evening, even as they started going to bed.
Malfoy gaze was dark and disbelieving.
Harry leered. “Stay away from him. You already gave him up once.”
“The things you did to him….” Harry had to take a deep breath through his clenched teeth. “He wasn’t just hurt by someone who never cared about him. He was betrayed by someone who actually acted like they loved him. Not just by you but his family too, by all of his friends! He doesn’t know what’s real. He doesn’t know anything except for betrayal, and I know how hard that is to come back from. I don’t care if it’s not me, but I won’t let anyone else do that to him again.”
Pansy nodded. She looked back at Ron. “If you hurt him while Harry isn’t looking, I will make it my career’s ambition to bury you.”
“It’s easy when the weapon they used was stolen from your family’s collection,” Draco sighed. When he saw Harry’s frown, he explained, “It was an old ritualistic dagger that poisons and incapacitates the victim. It’s an uncommon poison, but it is curable with the right antidote and counter-curse. Carrow or Macnair must have stolen it from the manor.”
Hermione’s brow furrowed as she examined Harry’s face. “Yeah… Why wouldn’t we be? Ron even said it’d been pretty obvious in the dorms; it’s why he didn’t like Dean with Ginny. He knew it wouldn’t work out. That’s his story, at least. You know him.”
Harry also got Malfoy to begin working on leaving the house. It wasn't impossible for him, but he couldn't go far for very long. They certainly had to stay within muggle London.
"Who's there?" roared Kreacher from the landing above before thumped down into sight. His old face was twisted with disdain. "Get out! Master will be home any minute. Kreacher won't let another thief in this house."
Harry relaxed into the embrace. It felt a bit awkward but he slowly hugged her back. “He helped me a lot too.” He looked over the woman’s head to the blushing man still by the door. It only made Draco even more flustered.
Draco looked up and down the man’s shirtless form, pausing on the worn joggers where the elastic was becoming loose. “I mean when there are other people around,” Harry urged.
“It’s okay, they need to talk,” Harry assured. He had to readjust Teddy again. He could tell it wouldn’t be long before he couldn’t carry him around like this anymore.
What spell should he use?
They had done exactly as Harry had hoped. They’d stopped hiding and stopped running and faced their demons. What made it easier was that they faced them together. Long nights in hotel rooms weren’t uncommon but just as often as they were spent in heated passion; they were also spent in trembling tears. It was because of this that they’d begun to enjoy the sweeter moments such as this even more. It was the reason Draco had forgotten they were in a kitchen and why Harry didn’t blush when they were caught. They were no longer guilty about their happiness.
Draco nodded along, concentrated on taking in her knowledge. However, upon following the movement of her hand, he noticed Harry’s gaze. He tensed instantly. Harry wasn’t the only one who saw. Hermione was also staring, her grip tightening on Harry’s hand. Draco hurried to pull down his sleeves.
Despite this treatment, Luna had found him in the library the first week of term and began talking to him about Nargles and Wrackspurts as if picking up an old conversation with a friend. In a way, she was. Draco had listened to her talk of many different odd creatures and conspiracies she believed in while she was at Malfoy Manor. He often went down there when one of her cellmates was being questioned. He had assumed both of them could use a distraction from the screaming.
He dropped the plate he'd been holding with a loud clunk in the soapy water and rushed over to Harry. He desperately dried off his hands as he hurried over before lifting his fingers to Harry's jaw. "What happened?"
Harry's eyes flashed open. He peered up at Draco, first confused as to why he had stopped and then the unmistakable dread muddling up his gaze.
He only took a step forward before Andromeda side-stepped into his path. “I don’t think that’s a good idea, Harry.”
Another reason he possibly wanted to stay home was because he didn’t want to break their high. Ever since that night in Grimmauld, he and Draco had become undeniably closer. Neither of them brought up the matter again but they both thought about it. They considered it far more than either would let on, actually.
Draco’s gaze narrowed into a glare though Harry was fairly certain he was fighting a smile. “You’re lucky you’re warm. I’ve been freezing in here lately.”
Her face softened gradually. A smile he’d only seen rarely and which had always humbled him to be the source of curved her mouth. “Thank
“Well, isn’t that just a lovely thing to have laying around your house?” Ron grumbled. He slouched back again, his eyes returning to the window.
Malfoy nodded with enthusiasm. “She’s also started gardening. I swear I’ve never seen dirt under that woman’s nails before, but she’s actually quite good at it. The sunroom looks like a greenhouse now.”
"I was one," he insisted, ignoring the dower look on Harry's face. "And I'm telling you, you're no threat in the state you're in right now."
Draco chuckled, one of his warm genuine laughs that made Harry smile. “I don’t mean farm land, just a nice cottage somewhere away from people; somewhere that I can just exist and not feel anyone’s disappointment or expectations breathing down my back.”
Robards narrowed his eyes. “I thought...” He looked to Ron quizzically, who answered with the shake of his head. “Did something happen?”
He gave a curt nod.
“But you’re still thinking about it.”
To busy himself and fill the sudden silence, Malfoy pointed his wand at the glass shards on the ground. They began to magically mend themselves, soon forming one large glass piece that fit perfectly back on top of the metal legs.
Bad news came when Harry went back to the hospital for his checkup on Tuesday. Healer Sow was professional enough not to mention Draco’s absence, but he had the uncanny feeling that she was terser with him than usual. She also most certainly did not restrain from giving him a piece of her mind when she found out that he had returned to work despite her warnings. To his dismay, she ordered him to stay home for the rest of the week and stay off his feet if he wanted to get back onto the field anytime soon.
Draco was a neat person. He was the type to fold and put away his clothes as soon as they were cleaned. He nagged Harry to do the dishes when it was his night to do them. He never let the garbage bin get too full. However, Harry had never seen him quite like this.
“I had forgotten how much I liked drawing,” Draco said as if answering some question.
Narcissa hadn’t specified what time she was coming so when she had yet to make an appearance by ten o’clock, Draco began to flutter around even more – if possible.
“You’re doing it again.”
Harry shrugged. “Apparently, they all knew already. I’m the only one who didn’t.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
Neither entirely in their right minds yet, they decided to stay at Grimmauld for dinner. When they got down to the kitchen, they found a more annoyed-looking Kreacher than usual. “Master’s friends keep calling,” he grumbled. “They threatened to come over, but Kreacher has locked up the Floo.”
“And she doesn’t know how to switch on a light without her wand.”
sort of stuff,” he added quickly seeing the look on Ron’s face. “I’m trying. Draco’s really helping me through it, actually.”
Malfoy was still mildly frozen, so Harry began to pull down his sleeve and straighten the hem of his shirt. “Sorry for groping you,” he half-joked. He likely should have asked for permission before pulling up his shirt so much.
Ron perked up. “Oh, are we actually going to address this? I figured you were just going to keep lying to us and acting like nothing is going on.”
He removed his hand from his wand. His jaw ached from the grinding pressure he forced it to endure. His hot breath burned his nostrils as he attempted to take deep breaths.
Draco snorted. "Please, who would want to be healed by Draco Malfoy?"
Harry watched as Teddy pointed at the rows of plants, talking so animatedly that he reminded Harry of someone else. Draco knelt beside him, appearing to be listening very intently. Harry couldn’t help but smile even as he felt a dull ache in his chest.
Harry looked up, meeting the other man's eyes. He felt his heart begin to beat faster in his chest. He didn't know why but his smile began to involuntarily stretch into a grin. "I'm doing it."
Hermione regarded him for one more drawn-out moment before straightening. “Okay. I’ll tell Molly not to expect us.” She glanced up at the clock over the door. “I might be able to still make that meeting with the goblins if I go quickly. They’re so difficult to reschedule.”
He was not the only one. Draco gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder. The same emotions passed through his eyes, and then, “No! No! Not again!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room.
His appetite had once again begun to wane. At the very least, this meant he could stretch out whatever leftovers they had for longer than usual. By Tuesday, the fridge was virtually empty, except for some condiments. He had to go out on his own.
“Fine, I’ll stay in the office and do paperwork, but I want to come back to work.”
“You both are unbelievable!”
Draco suddenly felt his stomach become very tight. Guilt wriggled in his chest at the thought of saying anything, but it became worse at the idea of pretending everything was okay. He had an opportunity here; it would be stupid to let it pass.
For the first time, Harry understood why Malfoy was always so skeptical of his kind gestures. Harry wasn’t entirely sure he believed him. There was just something about his eyes like he wanted to do this more than he was trying to convey.
Draco did not take his eyes away, although his head twitched as if he wanted to. His lips trembled with unsaid words before finally settling on, “This Bradley, how did you feel about him?”
"Well…"
Harry swatted his hand away and tried to move out of the line of fire, but Malfoy came around the sofa and sat beside him. Harry narrowed his eyes. He kept his hands up, prepared for whatever attack was coming.
However, now that he was there, it seemed pointless to have had his hopes up all day, because Ron was right, there was little that pointed to any guilt in the file. No alerts had been reported from the tracker on his wand and he was almost never missed a counseling session. The only red flag was that his six month probation had officially ended a few weeks ago which could explain why he waited until now to do anything.
"You don't have-"
Malfoy tried to shimmy away ― or at least into a more comfortable position ― but ended up having Harry practically sitting in his lap. "You're insufferable," Malfoy grumbled.
“That had to hurt, didn’t it?” Malfoy said cheekily.
Hermione placed their orders over the phone while Ron changed into muggle clothes. When he came out, she tossed him a wallet, and he walked out the door.
, his thoughts cruelly reminded him.
“Wow, Potter,” Robards mused as Goyle was dragged away. “I don’t think I’ve ever witnessed you have that much control.”
"Oh, right," Malfoy muttered awkwardly. "I'm sorry about that."
“You two having a fight or something?” Susan asked, breaking through Harry’s muddled thoughts.
Malfoy knew Harry hadn’t meant to hurt him, but the evident fear in his eyes made it clear that Harry didn’t forgive himself quite so easily. Without a word, Malfoy turned on his heel and grabbed the door handle, pulling it shut behind him.
"Americans are on here too?"
He passed the Dailey Prophet stand. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the front page with two figures standing far too close. He refused to look. He refused to give them the reaction they were looking for.
"A form of muggle money."
When Malfoy didn't respond, his eyes maintain on the ingredients on the counter, Harry decided to just go without pressing it anymore. "I'll be right ba-"
Harry shooed the topic away as he took another sip from his cup. “Actually,” he was at least going to have to tell him where he would be all day Saturday, “I was reminded that Teddy’s birthday is this weekend.”
“You don’t know that. You know, you could do with making some more friends. You aren’t a terribly bad bloke.”
Harry expected that he was coming to share another one of these theories for their latest case when he came up to his desk while Harry was packing up. “I don’t know if my informant,” no one besides Ron and Robards knew ho Harry’s informant was, “will know anything about petty theft. Fletcher will probably be a better source if we can track him down.”
Dread began to twist in Draco’s gut. “What story?”
“Yeah, he looks so alone over there,” Hannah agreed. “And it’s not as if anyone cares about house loyalty anymore. All the eighth-years sit at Gryffindor now.”
A smile found its way onto Harry’s face. “Yes, like a prat.”
Draco didn’t merit the statement with a response, giving only a little sniff and turning his head away from the girls.
That was right. Kreacher had been the one who sold out the Order to Narcissa Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. He's the one who told them that Sirius was a weakness for Harry. It was still difficult for Harry to look at Kreacher when he thought too much about his godfather.
Malfoy was suddenly very happy he had turned off the lights. “Go to bed, Potter.”
He stopped and took another deep breath. His eyes were on their knees, which were no longer touching. “It was more that…well, that’s what you do, isn’t it?” Their eyes finally met. Harry got lost in the metallic gaze, emotions so high that it melted the metal and made his heart clench. “I didn’t think you would save me specifically, but I did hope you’d come. Things were getting so crazy… I knew you’d come. I just wanted him gone. I didn’t care how.”
A gush of warm triumphant breath ran over Harry’s face when they finally stilled. A buoyant slope of pale hair fell over one of Draco’s eyes, leaving the other alone, bright and piercing and absolutely exhilarated. Harry wasn’t sure he would survive if he was looked at by both of them. Heat rose up his neck and wrapped around his face laced with strange tingles.
“And I said no press,” Robards spat, blocking the doorway. “You can wait for my formal announcement like everyone else.”
“Well, am I going to live, Doc?” Harry joked in an attempt to ease the sudden tension.
“You don’t, but I don’t want to have to tell your mother that my friends killed you because they didn’t trust you.”
That was the last time Harry was going to try to help him.
“Well, frankly,” Malfoy sighed, looking up warily from his pages, “I haven’t really been
"Of course," Kreacher said quickly, bowing his head. "Sorry, Master. Kreacher will get the pots and pans."
He tore away from the patrolmen and stormed towards Harry. “You can’t help yourself, can you?” he roared, his eyes alight with fury. “You’ve always had it out for my family, haven’t you? I once called you great things before you ridiculed my son, and now you continue to do it.”
I’m that moment, Harry lost his grip on the last thin thread of control he had. Harry spun on him. He was absolutely livid. “
And there's no one to blame
Harry began to shake his head as he acted as though he was too busy chewing on the bite in his mouth to answer. Not able to actually push the food down his suddenly closing throat, he muttered through it, "Just cleaning and stuff, it's not a big deal."
“Why?”
“Because you’re an oblivious imbecile.”
It must have been evident on his face because Draco instantly commented when he approached. “What happened?”
Harry shook his head. "She'd curse me if she ever heard me talking to him like that. I didn't mean to."
It momentarily looked like a mistake to add more to this conversation, Draco’s face scrunching up once again. Harry’s concern vanished when Draco spoke. “But
Malfoy’s face flushed reader than a Weasley’s child’s head. “I- I think you can handle that on your own.”
Tired of reading textbooks and academic theorems, Draco ventured towards the fictional works. He wasn’t usually one for fiction. His mother used to read The Tales of Beedle the Bard to him when he was young, but his father had made her stop when he was around six. Once he could start reading on his own, Lucius had decided to swap out the soft, touchy fairy tales for reality. It was better for him. It would prepare him for the real world, at least that was what Lucius said.
“No.”
Tears began to well in Narcissa's eyes. Draco snapped his head back, scanning the room. He spotted the two mugs sitting beside the sink. Fury pumped in his chest. "I told you to put away those cups!"
“Pansy?” both men chorused. Pansy was leaning over the counter, nearly tipping over the cup of coffee in front of her as she whispered to Heather.
“Don’t,” Ron warned grimly, spotting the twisting of Percy’s face. If anyone had less tolerance for an ex-Death Eater than George, it was Percy. After all, he had been the last person with Fred. The mousey-haired woman beside him squeezed his arm.
It was only the tiniest glimpse, and if one didn’t know what they were looking for, they might have missed it. Harry could spot it easily. Thin silver lines, hashing what would otherwise be perfectly smooth skin.
Lunch had been a good idea. Heather managed to force Draco and Harry to tell them some of their story which included sideline commentary from Pansy – mostly involving her rolling her eyes and making faces about different events during school. She also clearly wanted to ask more about magic but they’d chosen a muggle restaurant to go to so they avoided the topic.
Malfoy was not there when he woke up the next day, and Harry did not think about it.
Malfoy went to the cupboards to begin pulling out plates. He hesitated with the thought that roamed his head. Would Harry think it was too forward? He looked over at the tired look on the other man's face as he placed all of the food on the counter. "Well," Malfoy spoke up, putting extra attention in placing the plates down as quietly as possible, "I suppose I could spare a drawer or two if it would be easier for you."
“What? He’s been on the run for three years. How?”
Harry sighed but nodded. “Okay but why don’t I help you? I think it would be more enjoyable to eat if the flat is still standing afterwards.
"I know," Harry hissed.
Once again Harry pulled out a response which absolutely sent Draco. “I don’t know, I think I can have you saying ‘oh my God’ pretty soon.”
Malfoy's eyes ran across the other man's face, seeing all the lines and scars a person his age shouldn't have – he wouldn't be surprised if Harry started sprouting grey hairs within the year.
"It was Expelliarmus."
It took some effort for Harry to pull his gaze off the door and onto his friend. After a brief consideration, a smirk pulled up on his mouth.
“So why?”
Harry rolled his eyes but latched onto Draco nonetheless. “Shut up.”
produced an uncontrolled, blast of water.
“I think this is the first time I’ve been in the countryside in over a year,” Draco voices, earning Harry’s gaze on his face. “I forgot how much I liked it.”
It was only when they both began to feel lightheaded that they finally tore apart. They gasped for air. Their heavy pants swirled the dust moats which lingered in the long-forgotten room. They would look as if they had both just run a marathon if it wasn’t for the fact that they were still tangled together, foreheads pressed together, Draco pushed against Harry, caged in by Harry’s arms on either side of him as he used the piano for support. Nevertheless, of all of Harry’s physical feats, this was the one he was now most proud of.
Once they’d finished up, they said their goodbyes and the girls went on their way while the boys started towards their own flat. They didn’t get very far before Harry realized they were near Grimmauld and decided to stop by to check up on Kreacher and pick up any post that had been dropped by.
Harry nodded. He brought his eyes back down to his food, beginning to push it around the container. "Yeah, my godfather left him for me, with his house."
"You know, some Arnica would fix that right up for you," said Neville, who had just gotten back to his desk.
Harry couldn’t manage a decent counter. He was still trying to process what their last conversation was about. “Okay, it’s official. I do not want the three of you,” he gestured at the length of the couch they sat on, “to ever become friends.”
Harry nodded. “You aren’t responsible for their choices though.” Something twisted in Harry’s stomach and his eyes fell to the ground where he scuffed the carpet. “Just like I’m not responsible for everyone who tried to help me.” He looked back at Draco. “I’ve started to come to terms with that because of you. Because I see you and I realize we’re actually a lot alike. We were just other people’s pawns and we did the best we could with what we were given. But that’s all over. Now…” He closed the last bit of space between them and Draco didn’t move away. He placed a gentle hand against Draco’s cheek. “It’s time for both of us to stop punishing ourselves. We
Following his first instinct, Draco attempted to shut the door, but Ron shoved past. Draco stumbled into the table beside the door, sending all of the papers falling to the ground. “I knew Harry shouldn’t have helped you get out of Azkaban.”
Who was he trying to fool? He knew Harry wouldn't be coming, not after he stormed out the night before. It was back to the old routine of reading and watching the walls like they'd eventually give him the courage to leave his flat on his own.
Malfoy raised a brow at Harry, ignoring their audience. “No catches. That is what you’ve been telling me, right? There doesn’t need to be an ulterior motive.”
“What is it?” Robards pressed.
This was the only part he didn’t like about being a professor. He had to go far too long without seeing Draco though they did usually meet up in Hogesmede for weekends as often as they could. Then again, it only made their reunions sweeter.
Heather sent her a sharp look that instantly quieted the women. “Yes, Dear.” She pulled her mug to her lips, sipping quietly. Draco burst out in laughter. Never before had he seen the boisterous woman so utterly whipped.
“No guarantee knowing our luck.” Malfoy took another sip.
Ron’s face began to match his robes. He turned his face the way they’d been walking, squinting as if the sun had suddenly broken through the constant cloud cover overhead. “Listen, I’m not going to judge anymore. I’ll support whatever makes you happy so if you want to be with Parkinson and Malfoy-”
“Sod off, Potter.”
Malfoy clicked his tongue to the roof of his mouth. "It'll only take a few seconds. Just stop complaining."
Draco sat up, turning his back to the other boy as he started to crawl off the bed. “You know your general okay-ness with all of this is really unsettling. I’m beginning to think you’re doing it on purpose.”
It never bothered Harry. If anything, it was the one thing that made sense about Malfoy. He had also grown up in a place where kind words usually had an ulterior motive. Trusting people even for the smallest of things seemed like a treacherous feet. Maybe that was why Harry felt so inclined to step up to the task.
The words coming out of his mouth were honest, but something was missing. Perhaps Draco found it just as hard to lie to Harry now. Harry didn’t need to hear the truth. He could see it.
Malfoy sighed as if his plans had been foiled. Instead of giving a real answer, he decided to find another way to fluster Harry. “Considering we didn’t actually sleep together, I didn’t think we needed to have the morning after talk. If it really meant that much to you then I suppose I’ll listen, but it seems unfair since I didn’t get the pleasure that usually goes along with the awkward conversation.”
Terry shrugged. “I don’t have any proof other than the fact that I was just as surprised by those pictures as I imagine everyone else was.” He eyed Harry up and down. “I never would have pegged you for
“No, he doesn’t want to talk to me right now.” Harry glanced at the Slytherin table also. “Or see me, I guess.”
Ron nodded, his eyes falling away as he fell into a distant thought. "Yeah, anything to appease Hermione, I 'spose." He focused back on Harry. "We'll do something else soon, though, right?"
Draco made the same gesture between her and Heather. “And when did this happen?”
“You seem oddly chipper today,” Ron said as if he was noting that Harry appeared ill.
The twisted anger on Draco’s features slowly fell into unadulterated shock. His eyes wide and his mouth hung nearly to the floor. “You qu-quit?”
“I didn’t know you started coming here,” said Draco.
Harry snorted. "Trust me; a little trim isn't going to calm it. It's been attempted. My aunt once shaved it all off and left the fringe to cover my scar."
Robards shook his head again. “I don’t know. I was with the minister when I was told he’d been found in Hogsmeade.”
Harry wrinkled his nose and stepped on Malfoy’s foot. A slight sound of outrage came out of the boy’s mouth, who kicked his leg in return. Harry didn’t retaliate like usual, trying to stay on track.
“I just want it to look nice,” Draco responded, his voice tight. “I don’t want to give her any reason to worry.”
“Anything?” he pulled on the word until each syllable sounded like its own sentence.
The clatter from the kitchen pulled Harry’s gaze away. Draco bounced on the balls of his feet as he gave a sharp shake to his hand. When he brought the end of his finger to his lips Harry realized he must have burnt it on the heating kettle. It wasn’t like Draco to be so clumsy.
your father, Malfoy?” he said, picking up from some other part of their conversation. “I heard they got rid of the dementors. He must feel so lonely without even one of those ugly beasts there to keep him company.”
“What?” Harry snapped again, this time making an elderly woman jump as she exited the shop they were standing in front of.
“I was worried about you,” Harry said, slowly lowering his hands as Draco’s wand vanished back into his pocket.
Maybe he should just invite Draco to the party. It would be a nice setting, and it would only be Teddy, Andromeda, Ron, and Hermione. If he did, he should probably give them some sort of warning. What if that gave them the wrong idea, though, like he was bringing over a new girlfriend? Draco wasn’t his girlfriend. They were just friends who ate dinner together, and watched telly, and slept over occasionally ― or every night, in the same bed. Harry hadn’t even been that close with Ginny…
“I don’t give a fuck who you snog, Potter. I care about your safety because that’s my job. However, if you’re going to threaten the safety of the rest of my people over this, then maybe it’s time for you to take a break.”
Draco pulled himself up from the chair. “I’m coming, I’m coming. I wouldn’t want to turn down the guest of honor.”
After a moment, Harry tore away and sprung from the bed like it was on fire. “Fuck! Work!”
“Is that what this is all about?” Was Draco such a wreck because he was scared of what his mother was going to think when she found out about…about whatever they were? He wouldn’t be offended if they had to say they were just friends. That’s what they agreed on anyway. Harry had helped them before, it couldn’t sound too strange.
Harry went to open his mouth, but Ron and Hermione answered for him in a chorus, “Harry doesn’t drink tea.”
Malfoy’s head snapped up. His eyes were wide only for a moment before his eyelids grew heavy with irritation. “Of course it’s you, Potter.” He turned his head back to the fire. Harry might have thought he found the flicker interesting but he was sitting almost as far away from it as possible, pressed into the back corner of the sofa facing the stairs, his knees pulled up tightly to his chest.
Draco flushed. “You’re still ridiculous,” he huffed. “Even if I love you, too.”
"It only takes one spell to end a life."
“We used to live in dormitories. Are you saying you’ve never seen another guy change before?”
“Well, it looks like you’re in good hands here,” said Sow, her eyes dancing with amusement as she glanced at Draco’s stern expression. She patted his arm as she passed. “I’ll be back for rounds in an hour.”
"It tastes better with Oolong," Malfoy explained. "Or, that's the way my mum always made it." He gestured to a yellow tin on the counter with Chinese script. "She just sent me some more the other day."
Seeming to take into account the awkward air between the adults, Teddy began to tug on Draco’s sleeve. “Come look for gnome’s with me.”
Ron shut his mouth again, lips pressing into a hard line. He was angry still, but Harry could also see the worry set deeply behind his irises like Ron was trying his damnedest not to light a match next to the bomb fuse no matter how much he needed a fire to stay warm. "Have a good night, Harry," he said in a dry tone. He turned on his heel and walked away.
"Well, firstly…" Harry reached over and took Malfoy's set, snapping them apart and handing them back before Malfoy could complain.
A strained thank you flew out of Malfoy’s mouth before he was out the door.
“No press,” Robards voice could be heard before they rounded the corner.
Harry dropped his hands from his face and sat back on his heels. “You already told her? How?” Draco didn’t have an owl and they’d been fairly occupied after they became official. He couldn’t picture Draco appariting to the post in Diagon Alley in the middle of the night to send a letter out – actually he could and it was a bit amusing.
He pulled the cup from his mouth and shook his head as he waited for his voice to come back. “That’s not- That’s not when you use that phrase,” he urged. Draco had been trying to use more muggle sayings, but the problem was that he got most of them from Will & Grace, which made him constantly spew out gay innuendos without realizing it.
Harry sat up in his chair, a deep frown on his face. He ran his finger over the background. “How is that possible?”
Harry began to rub soothing shapes into Draco's knee, occasionally moving partially down his thigh then back up to his knee. He watched Draco's reaction the whole time, only concerned with calming him.
A smirk tugged on the corner of Harry’s mouth. “Actually, I was going to offer Ron’s.” The way Malfoy’s lip twitched gave him an odd sense of achievement. “He stays with Hermione. However, if you’d like to get into bed with me then I think we should get to know each other better.”
No, there was a complete misunderstanding going on here. They were just spending too much time together. It wasn't that odd that Draco could be showing up in Harry's dreams, and he had no idea what he was actually dreaming about. Draco simply needed to act normal. They were just friends, and it was better that it stay that way.
As Harry was hurrying to get his things together to leave work at the end of the day, Ron approached him. "Hey, Harry, I wanted to apologize for Tuesday. We both had a long day and just wanted to go home. Neither of us was in the right headspace."
“D…Draco…”
He bounded up the steps towards the ground floor. He rounded the corner with Walburga’s portrait, ignoring her grumblings, and went up the next flight. Upon first glance into the drawing-room, he thought Kreacher was playing a prank on him. It didn’t look like anyone was there. He stepped into the doorway and scanned the room.
“Hm? Oh, I ca-“ He stopped and blinked a few times as if suddenly remembering something. “Yeah, okay…”
“You’re beautiful,” Harry finally answered.
Malfoy rolled his shoulders back, and Harry felt his feet move closer as he relaxed his legs. “Well, believe it because I’m amazing at everything.”
With these aching bones,
Harry's brain lingered on the word 'home' coming out of Draco's mouth. It didn't sound incorrect. Nevertheless, he couldn't dwell on it, sensing Draco's impatience rising. Harry sighed, rubbing his temples. "Because we need to close this case before someone else gets killed."
She twisted around in a flurry. The shock on her face faded quickly. “Oh, it’s just you guys.” She sighed and picked up her mug. “I thought my mum followed me again.”
Harry looked at him with disbelief. “He throws you out every time he feels like having a shag.”
The fireplace roared to life. Within a second, Harry felt someone collide with his back. They both stumbled. “I thought the point of waiting five minutes was so you could move out of the way,” Draco grumbled as he steadied himself.
The snitch fell back into his hand, and Harry finally looked at Draco. “Harry,” he corrected.
“Well…”
The others also came to a stop, Ron and Hermione staring bewildered at a rather aloof Malfoy. “You seem to be passing the rest of your classes, although maybe you should take some more time on Transfiguration as well,” he added offhandedly.
“Draco didn’t get off because of me!” Harry bellowed.
He finally stopped pretending to be a fish and put his glass down. There was a deep crease in his brow and it began to bring Harry down he even spoke. “Can I ask you one question though?”
Harry shrugged. "We'll apparate, and it's just my house. No one will be there besides Kreacher." He noticed how Malfoy shifted uncomfortably and quickly added, "It's completely up to you, though. Like I said, it won't take long."
Despite all of these thoughts, and Draco telling himself he should suggest that they spend some time apart, he found himself checking the clock multiple times when Harry didn't come home as soon as usual.
“Doesn’t feel so nice when you’re the one being teased, does it?”
“The usual,” Heather gestured to Harry and Draco, “and one barista’s choice coming right up.” She tossed Pansy a wink then spun away.
Draco squeezed his hand again and they continued walking.
Ron’s look hardened. When nothing seemed to click, he glanced once towards the pair they’d left at the table near the dartboard. “You and the ferret,” he said in a low rush when Harry still refused to catch on.
Harry saw the fury flare in his friend's eyes before he could consider what he said. Ron opened his mouth, and Harry braced himself to be chewed out. What happened instead felt even worse.
“So?” Harry asked.
All the while, Draco made quick work of the room. The smell was soon nonexistent and every surface was spotless. He returned to the flat solely to collect all of the linen and removed the black, frilled duvet with theirs. It was around this time that Harry realized he was more of a hindrance than a help so he left Draco to it.
“Malfoy,” Harry whined. His hand reached out to try to tug on his shoulder, but his balance was not at its peak―and laying down sounded like a very good idea.
It was the second time they went downstairs that they found Dean and Anthony Goldstein on the couches.
They sat like that for a while. The television ran in the background, but Draco only watched Harry's reaction as he ran his fingers through his hair. He worked his fingers through most of his head, eventually ending up at his fringe, brushing it back from his forehead. He froze, his fingers still twisted in the other man's hair, as his eyes found the splintered shape etched into his skin.
“That’s because Zabini wasn’t there. He turned tail the moment we gave him an out. He’s a coward.”
Draco’s eyes snapped open. “Get out.”
“Chivalrous?” Harry repeated. “Be careful, you’re beginning to sound like a Gryffindor.”
Of course, there was the fact that he never exactly pulled away either. His light reprimands were the worst of it. If anything, Draco was just as guilty, constantly stuffing his feet under Harry’s thigh on the sofa, only ever getting his attention by tugging on his clothes, and never once being the first to pull away. Harry might go ninety, but Draco always met him the extra ten. It was utterly bewildering.
Harry couldn’t find words. The thoughts that had just made him ache ran through his brain. Why would he look like Zabini? What part of his thoughts made him appear that scheming?
Harry had a feeling he should drop it, but the curiosity had been eating at him for too long. “Yes.”
Malfoy began to reach out but stopped just short of Harry’s arm, looking up to the other man’s face. “Can I?”
Ron pursed his lips. He didn’t appear at all moved by this excuse but he relented nonetheless. “Fine,” he straightened, “if that’s what you really want. It’s your birthday.”
Once they were alone, Harry brought his eyes back down to Malfoy. The moment of adrenaline had passed, and now he felt even more tired than before. He could barely keep his eyes open. "So, what did you do?"
Draco’s face was twisted in a grimace but he slowly sat back down. Harry didn’t let go of him. In the contrary, he twisted their fingers together, keeping a tight hold on him while simultaneously running soothing shapes over the back of his palm with his thumb.
“You’re evil,” Harry hissed.
The tension in his body eased hearing the faint plea in her tone. “It’s okay,” he assured. “You guys don’t have time to take care of me, anyway. You have work.”
Harry shook his head. “I already told Draco I was staying home with him.” That was a downright lie but it was the best he could come up with on the spot.
There was a moment when he thought she would take his offer, but her eyes darted to Draco. She shook her head. “No, no, I’m okay here.”
Malfoy made another disgruntled face. “Honestly, someone should wash your mouth out. My hair always looks good.”
Draco paused at the insinuation that he was a girl. It was an easy mistake to make considering they had never discussed their genders. Draco had no idea who he was speaking to, and this person didn’t know him either. He couldn’t help but feel slightly emboldened and perhaps say a few things he wouldn’t normally.
What made it harder was that every time he considered that maybe, just maybe, he liked the company of men, his uncle's sneers about 'poofs’ on the telly rung in his ears. It was usually followed by how he'd grumble that they should have never legalized
“How does he even–” Ron stopped and shook his head. “I don’t wanna know. I’ll get yours ‘Mione.” He bounded up the steps past Neville and Hannah.
“I don’t care.”
He still looked apprehensive.
A shattering sound pulled the bartender's attention to the rugby players. Harry slipped out the door. As promised, he began to walk home.
Draco tilted his head, his frown looking more like a small pout. He seemed so innocent. It made it even harder for Harry to look at him, especially with his words still swimming in Harry’s head.
When Harry’s fingers lingered over his own, Draco slowly opened his eyes. He could see the thought process in Harry’s eyes. Deciding to relieve his struggle, Draco began to curl his fingers around Harry’s. Their fingers slowly entwined.
Harry’s eyes fell to the house-elf, which remained outside of the room, only looking in with one eye. The panic was replaced by rage as he jumped to his feet. “I told you to tell him I wouldn’t be coming over, not bring him here!” he roared so fiercely that Malfoy jumped back.
Their conversation began with Malfoy trying to defend his confusion. He insisted that the cafés he'd gone to in France did not have as nearly many options, to which Harry lowered his voice and leaned closer to question how many of them were wizarding cafés. Wizarding cafés tended to have two options for coffee ― with or without milk ― and the rest was up to the drinker. Malfoy stopped arguing after that.
“Do you think his father will ever approve?” Harry knew Draco cared of his mother’s opinion but it was Lucius who he always spoke of when they were growing up. He was the one who Draco looked up to the most.
Ron’s eyes bulged. “He’s done a lot wrong, Harry, and for some reason, I keep thinking I’ll walk in here, and you’ll remember that, but it seems like Carrow hit you in the head pretty hard, too.” He shook his head, already beginning to retrace his steps towards the door. “I knew I shouldn’t have come here today. Call me when you’ve got your sanity back. I’ll be in the office, ‘Mione,” he added gruffly before disappearing out the door.
Instead, Malfoy’s lip pulled up into a halfhearted sneer as he hissed, “What are you looking at, Potter?”
Malfoy opened his mouth with a retort but paused. “No,” he pushed out a sigh, “I suppose not. Hero complex and all that.”
“You’re not very discreet, you know,” Draco scolded that evening. “He’s already backed off. He doesn’t care what happens to me now.”
"No, no. Come on, before it gets too late."
Malfoy swallowed down the lump in his throat and was too busy trying to get the wires working in his brain once again that he forgot to filter his honesty. “I wasn’t.”
Sometimes watching the fire was the only way Harry could ever settle down. He knew he wasn’t the only one. It wasn’t an odd occurrence to walk downstairs at the Burrow and find two or three Weasleys huddled around the fireplace in silence―something that was usually a rarity in the daytime. Hermione would already be there or would come down soon after and quietly make cups of tea for the whole room. At least Harry had yet to see her or Ron sitting down here now; sleeping in the same bed seemed to help them. Sometimes they wouldn’t say anything. Other times the silence would be too heavy, the darkness outside the windows would act as a screen to the day before and the day to follow, and they would talk. When the next day came, no one would mention the nighttime. It would be tucked away, safe and secure in front of that fire to only be opened the next time everyone felt like sharing again.
Of course, Draco was used to hugging a pillow, so it wasn’t unusual for them to wake up intertwined. He always apologized in the morning, and Harry would make a quip about him being clingy, but it wasn’t all that bad, Harry thought. He actually quite liked how it felt to have Draco pushed up against him when he woke up, to know he wasn’t alone.
Harry kept walking until he was a few streets over where he remembered seeing the restaurant a week ago when he had been avoiding one of Allure's event nights. There were a few restaurants around – Italian, Indian, a café – but none were what he was looking for. He looked at the street signs, hoping to see the right one would jog his memory. Park Row. That sounded familiar.
“Yeah, you really got me there with that fake dementor. You almost killed me with a heart attack.”
After a little more incoherent mumbling, picking up bottles, then putting them back, he finally pulled one out and appeared satisfied.
A small, cyan blob flew across Harry’s lap, nearly knocking him over. After a moment of processing, Draco realized the blob was actually a child with shockingly colored hair. Harry steadied and pulled the child into a tight embrace. “Thank you, buddy.” As Harry rocked back and forth to exaggerate the hug, Draco finally realized who this child was. It was the only person with blue hair on his family tree. “I’m glad you’re finally here.”
Almost every eighth-year sat in a half circle around the fireplace, littering the large maroon leather sofas and ottoman and even spreading around on the floor. There were only three who weren’t there: the only Slytherins to return. Daphne Greengrass preferred sneaking down to the Slytherin common room to be with her younger sister, and Blaise Zabini was usually resigned to his bedroom. Draco Malfoy was the only one present though he didn’t join the steadily more rambunctious group. He sat in his usual thick leather chair beside the window on the other side of the room, curled up with a book in his lap and never once lifting his eyes from the pages as if hoping he would eventually fade into oblivion.
“It’s not even a scheduled day for you. Go home, most would kill for time off to spend time with their loved ones.”
Harry didn’t have to be told twice.
“I hate you.”
There was a knock on the door. Draco nearly fell out of his chair. He stared at the door wildly.
While Ron and Hermione were aware that his situation with his relatives hadn't been pleasant, he'd never actually gone into detail about what it was like. He never saw a reason to. He had gotten out of it, and there was no reason to look back. What was the point in making them feel guilty? He was sure they had their own family stuff they didn't talk about with him. It was normal to not talk about one's family, right?
Finally, he was ready to head out the door.
. He wasn’t looking over his shoulder every five seconds. He didn’t have his shoulders caved in. He stood tall and walked by himself, merely using Potter as a guard-rail whenever he got off balance.
Not able to curb his curiosity, Harry pressed a finger over the snake’s head. Draco flinched.
“Can’t you just tell Narcissa to leave you alone?” Ron spoke up. “She has her family. I don’t see why she feels the need to bother you, too.”
“Would you like a seat, Mrs. Malfoy?” Harry gestured to the sofa.
To Ron’s great relief, he didn’t have to watch this scene for much longer. The door opened again, and Robards came in, a younger Auror behind him. “We found Carrow.”
Malfoy let out a noise of offense, but neither paid it any mind. "Tap on the two-way if you need me."
Harry pressed his lips together. That was the second time that day that Draco referred to him by his surname. He usually only did it anymore to tease him but this seemed different. He was being careful around the others. Harry didn’t like it. It felt like they were going backwards. Nevertheless, he would respect Draco’s wishes. “If you’re certain.”
“No! I only want you to believe you can be loved.”
Harry followed the sound of a bubbling kettle into the next room. A smile stretched his face when he spotted the familiar lean form leaning against the counter.
"How long have you been here?" Harry asked as Malfoy ticked the stove off.
After two years of it being up ― it had been put up on the first anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts ― he was mostly able to coexist with the piece. However, there were days when it was hard. Days when he remembered…
Harry’s fingers slowly followed the twisting shape of the mark, knowing it by heart even as the image dimmed. A cool tingle ran up Malfoy’s arm and shot down his spine in a shiver. His eyes had fallen closed, never quite able to fully look at the mark on his arm.
Harry could feel his body whimpering from the stiffness of his muscles. He tried to shift his weight, but it felt awkward, his legs uneven. He brushed back his hair and only then noticed his hands were trembling as they ran across his scalp.
“Don’t start being humble now ― it doesn’t suit you,” Harry teased, making Draco’s cheeks flush. “And you’re always healing me. If I had been conscious, I would have apparated to you.”
She shrugged though her lips began to curl once again. “It’s nothing. Only…” She appeared hesitant to go on, but her curiosity got the better of her. “In my experience, men don’t usually try new things unless a girl is involved. Are you seeing anyone?”
A wizened Wizard who’d been rushing towards the lift pulled to an abrupt stop when he heard Harry’s voice. Harry recognized him the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.
“You want to help him?” Hermione asked, sounding downright aghast.
Somehow, it had all become a drinking game. Who has had the worst experience so far?
Malfoy sat up a little straighter. His eyes narrowed, flicking to various parts of Harry’s face as if searching for some sort of tell that he wasn’t real. Maybe it was a mask, or an illusion, or someone had gotten their hands on Polyjuice potion just to confuse Malfoy.
Mention of death. No clear description but understandable inferences.
It was beginning to make him question a few things about himself.
Harry didn't lower his wand, but a frown creased his face. "Blamed for what?"
“What happened?” Ron demanded. They had found Robards sitting in the corridor.
“I don’t think he’s with anyone,” Malfoy said as if reading Harry’s mind. “I just looked far too not miserable today. And I think it’s also a little revenge for how you stepped in today—twice.”
“No, he didn’t,” Harry snapped harsher than he meant to, making everyone perk up. He took a long deep breath, trying to keep himself levelheaded. “It’s over. That’s all in the past. I just don’t see why we need to keep bringing all of that stuff up again. Anyways, we know who the real villain was here. I don’t see why we need to blame the Malfoys’ for their involvement. It wasn’t all them.”
Zabini took a few more steps until he was level with everyone else. “The Slytherins have had one going for ages. Don’t tell me you’ve stooped so low, Potter.”
Malfoy took the remote from Harry’s limp hand and turned off the television. Harry was slowly sunk down onto the sofa, his head finding the pillow Malfoy had brought out. His nose crinkled as his glasses became askew, the plastic uncomfortable on his face. He reached up and took them off, but Malfoy took them from his hand before he dropped them on the floor. “Goodnight, Potter,” Malfoy said through a soft chuckle, folding the glasses on the coffee table.
Harry stopped firing and in an instant Goyle was disarmed. Harry and Lenny slowly got back to their feet. Ron and another Auror were pulling a bound Goyle up. Robards stood over them, watching the process. He whirled around when he spotted Harry out of the corner of his eye. “I thought I told you to go home! Honestly, Potter, do you have any idea how to take care of your own wellbeing?”
"I always knew you were a freak," Malfoy grumbled, bringing his cup up to his lips for a taste.
Harry nodded. He took Draco’s hand and twined their fingers together. “What to walk home? It’s a nice day.”
Ron smirked and leaned back, throwing an arm around Hermione. “Yeah, and?”
“Hello, Dromeda,” Narcissa greeted softly.
trusted them all with my life,” he corrected. “They won’t try to hurt us. Besides,” his voice lifted to a lighter tone, “this means you can tell Pansy too.”
There weren’t any voices so Harry assumed Narcissa hadn’t arrived yet. He dropped his feet onto hardwood and eased out into the living area, a yawn ripping through him as he opened the door.
“I hope you don’t mind rainbow banners,” muttered Ron. Harry felt an odd jolt in his chest. “They’ll likely reuse the decorations from Victoire’s party since they’re still up.”
Neville burst out laughing the moment Harry’s jaw dropped. “And to think I invited you to the wedding!” Harry exclaimed as Neville started to walk away.
A pressure against his side tore him from his thoughts. It was Hermione. He thought for a moment that she had noticed him beginning to hyperventilate, but her eyes were not on him. He followed her gaze.
Ron nodded though he was clearly not convinced. “Well, it’s good that the party’s this weekend then. You’ll have a good excuse not to be there.”
“Goodbye, Professor Potter,” several kids said in farewell. A few more echoed his wishes. He waved and said goodbye until they were all out of the classroom.
"It's me, Draco, I walked here," Harry's voice called through the door.
“…Arthur and I have been a few times in our earlier days but it’s been years. Oh, boys, are you all right?” Molly turned away from what appeared to have been a fairly good conversation between her and Narcissa.
"I'm not!"
That wasn’t how it was anymore though. Lucius was in Azkaban and Draco was alone. His and his mother’s safety in this new world was up to him now. If they were ever going to move forward, he would have to swallow his pride—and what a big pill to swallow that was.
Harry spun around to face Malfoy with wide eyes. "Really?" His mouth was gaping.
Harry’s eyes bulged, his mouth almost hitting the floor. “T- Told you what?”
Harry stumbled out of bed, trying as desperately as possible to stay quiet. He would be mortified if Draco saw him in his current state. He lumbered over to the bathroom, slowly closing the door behind him. The moment there was something solid between him and Draco, he let himself fall into the mess that he was.
“Well, they should have fixed the warding on the female entrance.”
“No one except for you.”
He gave the woman a dubious look. “No, you can’t, Hermione ― even if you tried to. You’re stressed enough as it is. And Ron has to pick up my slack around the office. Draco has the time, and he’s already agreed.”
Ron supposed he should have expected that considering how he’d acted the last time they had seen each other. He couldn’t bring himself to apologize, though. He wasn’t sorry. Draco was a bad idea ― he had to be.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “You’re spending too much time with Draco.”
He went to shove Harry’s shoulder, but arms quickly wrapped around his waist before they were both falling down. “Harry!”
"Not in some time."
“You giant oaf!” Malfoy tried to muscle Harry away, but the other boy gave no help.
Hermione scoffed and looked back at Harry—Ron would pay for that later. “But we’re all happy to hear those stories—like all the pranks the twins pulled on Ron–“Ron glared. “–because we get to learn about each other. That’s what normal friends do. Of course, our situation is a little different. It’s hard not to trust someone when they constantly have your life in their hands.” She leaned close, imploring with her eyes as her voice went down to just above a whisper. “You and Draco don’t really have that. You have the opposite, actually. It’s sort of staggering that you’ve managed this far.”
“I’ll be fine,” Harry insisted. “It’s passed. It won’t happen again tonight.”
Malfoy stared at the clock, his face twisted up in dismay. Harry was never this late. Maybe he had to work overtime, or he had mentioned Ron kept inviting him over after work. Perhaps he just went there for a bit first.
The tension in Harry’s shoulders relaxed. “Right.”
Narcissa’s expression remained the same but she turned it to her plate. “And those without red-hair, what do they think?”
She took the box and put it aside on a table with a pile of others that Harry assumed had been sent through the post. “Charlie’s playing with him outside,” she answered.
Draco’s eyes popped open wide. “Finnigan and Thomas were there; Longbottom was there!” he added  as if it added an extra layer of insanity.
Ron instantly wrapped her up in a tight embrace. “I see him almost every day, ‘Mione. I stopped thinking about it too. There’s nothing we can do anyway,” he mumbled into the top of her head. “This is the one thing we can’t do with him. He has to
Almost forgetting to get food in his rush to make up for the lost time, he grabbed Chinese again and headed over.
“How is your mother?”
The realization sent a burst through Harry. He pulled the folder and began to flip through the material. A crease started to form in his brow. “That doesn’t narrow much down. I should have died in a lot of places.”
Depulso.
With more people around, Draco was able to watch their reactions more carefully to Dean and Seamus’s relationship. As expected, no one gave it a second glance. They kissed and called each other stuff like ‘babe’ just like any of the other young couples at the table, and no one batted an eye. The same people would likely all faint if Harry and Draco put their hands on top of the table.
Draco pushed back just enough to speak, his voice breathy, “Dinner.”
Draco gave a squeeze to Harry’s hand and Harry could spot the gratitude in his eyes. “Yes, it is.”
It likely hadn’t been a fair way to behave. Nevertheless, confirmation that Draco at least found him attractive was far too intriguing to ignore. They could keep it at that, right? It didn’t have to be read too deeply into. At least, that’s what Harry kept telling himself.
There was a pop and a clamor. Draco pulled his head from the wardrobe, throwing out an old top he hadn't worn in a while. There were a few grunts, and something thumped onto the ground. He walked out into the living space.
Harry saved Draco from his own embarrassment by catching his lips with his own. It was hot and fast to begin with. Draco laid back into the sofa, Harry pressing down on top of him, hips rolling. Draco began to tug Harry’s shirt up-
One thing did bother Draco, though, something he had overlooked when reading the files himself. “I didn’t realize they were muggles. How do you know a wizard is doing it at all?” Of course, there was the symbol on the wrist, but that didn’t scream wizardry, merely a demented individual.
“Potter!” Malfoy roared, and Harry did not dare to look back.
Harry couldn’t help it. He honestly couldn’t stop smiling since he’d left Robards office. He had never felt so light in his life. For once there was no war. He wasn’t chasing anyone and no one was chasing him. Life and death weren’t constantly sitting in the forefront of his mind. He was free.
It was ten past eleven when a popping sound finally took Draco's attention away from the mind-numbing program he'd been watching.
“That’s more like it.”
“No, tomorrow.”
Dumbledore’s face as Draco pointed his wand at the headmaster stabbed his thoughts, forcing him to have to stop and take a long breath. His jaw ached as he gritted his teeth, shoving away the memory.
Malfoy nodded solemnly. Silence washed over them, the stiff type that hadn’t affected them in so long. Harry was desperate to find an easy subject.
Harry finally listened to his instinct. He snatched up one of the pillows to give Draco a hard wallop on the side of the head.
“You are going to drown someone like that.” The words that came out of Draco’s mouth sounded far harsher in the air than they had in his head.
Ron sighed. He looked back at Harry, his expression tight. “Angelina promised to keep George on relatively good behavior. I don’t know if anyone’s told Bill or Charlie but Percy won’t argue with Mum. Dad doesn’t mind.”
And I can't take it back
A jury might have declared him not guilty, but that didn’t mean he made the same judgment for himself. Years of isolation proved that. Starving himself proved it more. He hadn’t been sent to prison so instead he built one for himself. It was made of plain white walls and technology he never bothered to understand. He planned to die there. To fade away during his life sentence. A slow suicide.
It was a strange juxtaposition in Harry's mind to see Malfoy in such a contemporary and very muggle setting. He was used to seeing Malfoy with castle walls or ancient, ornate furniture as the background while he stood in his sleek, traditional robes. Right now, Malfoy wore comfortable slacks and a dark green sweater. Harry was curious where he'd gone to get his hands on that - not even in his wildest dreams could he picture Malfoy in a department store rifling through hangers.
Andromeda nodded. “I assumed so. That’s where our mother always got that tea she liked so much.” She looked back at Harry. He suddenly became very interested in the layers within the cake. “I must say, I’m surprised Lucius agreed to go. She always used to say how much he disliked it down there.”
“Well, I can’t, okay?” A tear slipped loose from the corner of his eye as their gaze locked. “I can’t. So just leave me alone because, clearly, I can’t give you what you want.” He tore his arms from Harry’s grasp and jumped back out of reach. He snatched his wand off his bed and shot out the door before Harry could hope to get another word in.
Harry let out a groan. "Hush," Malfoy said offhandedly, following the house-elf as he trotted to the other end of the kitchen. This decision didn't take as long. Malfoy plucked two 'U'-shaped glasses from the cupboard and began to rejoin Harry.
“What did it say?”
“Potter, can I have a word?”
Harry felt this was the best answer he’d get and it worked well enough. Harry stepped forward, eyeing the name on the man’s tag. “Lenny, would you mind telling that to a court if it’s needed.”
Seeing Harry's apprehensive look, Malfoy offered his own cup, which was pre-sweetened. "Here, just try it."
“I don’t!”
Malfoy found himself being nearly envious. He wished he could just lock stuff up like that. He had the opposite problem, where his mind would nitpick everything that ever happened to him until it slowly drove him insane. This was why he liked having Harry around, he distracted that part of his brain, and he was always moving forward so quickly that Malfoy couldn't linger on old thoughts.
Harry didn’t look at him, still glaring at the now-closed door.
After the war, she never stopped to question Harry’s desire to be an Auror. It seemed like the obvious career path for him, and it would undoubtedly give him an opportunity for success. She had thought it was a good choice. She knew it was dangerous, but their childhoods were dangerous. It was nothing new. She never saw it as something that was hurting him, not the way Draco was describing.
Terry shrugged. “I don’t know where he lives but I’m pretty sure he’s still at the ministry right now if he’s working today. He had me meet him there after his shift ended at eight.”
For the first time, Harry noticed the tension in Malfoy’s jaw as it twitched. Did he really upset him that badly?
Dinner time came sooner than he would have liked. The relatively empty castle had been lovely for most of the day. He dragged his feet up to the Entrance Hall. To his dismay, he spotted Weasley and Granger waiting by the front door.
“Working,” Harry said curtly.
Harry shrugged. "I've just never seen any other option for me. It was prophesized that I'd save people. It's all I'm good at."
He didn't have a good gauge, though. He'd gone to muggle school up until he was eleven, and even if he had met a gay child, then he certainly didn't know it.
Andromeda’s hard eyes darted towards the girl. Hermione didn’t waver, looking just as frustrated, and somewhat disappointed, as before. “I’m not allowing my grandson around the people who killed his parents.” Andromeda didn’t hold anything back. It wasn’t her style.
“Someone’s going to see,” Draco mumbled, looking anywhere but at Harry or his arm.
"Harry?"
“Wait! Wait, stop!” Draco pushed on Harry’s chest with great effort, not because Harry wouldn’t listen but because his own body didn’t want to listen either.
Considering they had both agreed nothing new would happen between them, they were both being incredibly reluctant to stop touching in some way. It was as if they thought the moment they actually separated was the moment they officially had to be true to that promise, and neither was ready for that quite yet. They had been separated for over a week only to collide back together harder than ever before. Pulling them apart again was going to take a little work.
“Potter!” Malfoy scolded. He glared down at the boy laying perpendicular over him, barely supporting himself up on his hand. “What are you doing?”
Harry nodded but pressed his lips into a tight line. It was better that he just stopped talking then burry himself into a hole he couldn’t climb out of. He let them continue with the conversation by themselves, kneeling to the ground to play with Teddy.
Harry finally looked up. He stared at him for a long moment, going through all of their conversations in the past week until he finally found what Ron was talking about. "Oh, right, well..." He felt weird turning him down again, he never usually missed an excuse to be away from Grimmauld, but he wasn't planning on being there long.
“He’s a Death Eater!”
“Really?” Ron perked up. “Never did that when we shared a room. Don’t get me wrong, I’m thankful.”
The corner of Narcissa’s mouth lifted. “Then it’s settled.”
Harry blinked once and then once more until Malfoy finally focused in his sights again. “Yeah.”
Ron leveled a look on him. “I’m sorry but were you the Weasley everyone was talking about when they sung ‘Weasley is our king’?” He looked to Draco. “Thank you for that, by the way. Lovely lyrics you made up there.”
Malfoy was still holding his face, tears streaming down over his cheeks and hand as he violently shook his head side-to-side.
Harry took his hand from his hair, dropping his gaze to his fidgeting fingers. “The same thing that always happens, Dudley. This time he learned a new word: Gay.” There was a pop of sound, but Harry did not look towards it. “He got everyone to start saying it, and eventually, it scared Bradley off. I’m not even sure if any of us really understood what that word meant at the time. I just knew that I wished someone wouldn’t be scared of me, and I never wanted anyone else to feel the way I did.”
Harry hesitated. “I didn’t tell you my name.”
His thoughts were becoming distorted. Instead of clean business robes, he saw tattered clothes damaged from spells gone awry and falling debris. The ministry atrium flashed in and out, the walls appearing to transform into gothic architecture, much like Hogwarts castle. Flashes of light from watches and hair clips shone in Harry’s eyes like curses and jinxes, making him cringe away.
He entered what was once the formal dining room. It was now a sitting room with plush chairs and sofa to greet anyone looking to adopt. The original china cabinet remained but it now stored the children’s accolades such as quidditch or academic awards.
"No such thing," Harry grunted bitterly. "Just ones that were too slippery to catch the first time."
Harry complied and began to bring noodles to his mouth with his chopsticks. Malfoy watched him intently, making Harry move a little awkwardly. Malfoy still looked amazed when he got it to his mouth. "Where did you learn to do this?" he asked as he began to desperately pinch at his own food again.
The couple went back down to the kitchen. Kreacher was there; he watched them expectantly. “He’s doing better,” Ron assured. “Three hot chocolates.”
Malfoy’s eyes went wide, and he leaped out of the bed.
Despite this, he tried to roll over and just go back to sleep. He wasn't in the mood to be productive today. However, the tapping sound coming from the sitting room insisted that he didn't get away with this.
“You heard, Robards. There was likely someone else with Macnair.” He gestured to Harry, whose eyes had fallen closed again but was mumbling something incoherent. “Whoever it was, did this to him. It had to have been Malfoy. Why else would Harry be saying his name? He’s naming his attacker.”
Harry nodded. “It’s too cold to go flying, but I want to stretch my legs.”
“Which is why I understand why Harry wants to help,” Hermione said. She clicked at the roof of her mouth at the look from both of the boys. “We were all in Malfoy Manor. We saw the way they were being used, and then the trials.” A shiver ran down her spine. “And I can’t imagine coming back to Hogwarts and not having anyone. Not even his old friends seem to want to give him the time of day.”
Draco nodded slowly but he didn’t appear convinced.
She wrote down Harry's order, and her eyes flicked over to Malfoy. He was staring at the chalkboard menu behind her in confusion, not recognizing half of the options. When he didn't say anything right away, she glanced at their still connected arms before looking at Harry again. "Are you two together?"
There were other things he must have told him. Something, anything. The admission he’d given about fancying more than half of the Weasley family felt like it should be there, but once it had been out in the open, he hadn’t really thought to repeat it. Everyone just knew now. Was how often he found some excuse to touch Draco not obviously enough? Then again, he supposed Dean and Seamus had done that for ages, and he had never thought on it.
Ron swallowed hard. If he was honest with himself, he would admit that he had noticed the same thing before. He’s had countless arguments with Harry about running into unnecessary fights. Like most Aurors, the job had taught Ron when to be cautious and when to move forward, but Harry always went in wand blazing. However, the job had not taught Ron how to forgive Death Eaters. If anything, it fueled his hatred, and he wasn’t about to admit to agreeing with one.
Malfoy’s eyes stopped near the bottom, finding a generic blond face with his name below. He brushed his fingers over the image. So he really was considered a Black. He began to look around, curious if Harry was somewhere on the massive tree. There was a Potter a few generations back, but they didn’t appear to be a direct line to Harry.
Harry gave another nod, his smile stretching even further. He brushed some of Teddy’s black, messy locks from his face. “Hopefully…one day.” He stood up again. “Goodnight, Teddy.”
When class started again, and there was no means of escape, Harry began to give mild compliments here and there. They ranged from comments on his work to muttering something about his appearance when he passed his table. The response was always spectacular. Harry had never before seen the suave, sophisticated Slytherin so clumsy. It was his best work yet.
Just as they reached the second floor landing, the subject of Harry’s contemplations appeared and he was not alone.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “So does every Slytherin. They’re all trying to distance themselves from me as much as possible. I’m quite universally hated.”
“Two weeks must have been a killer then.”
Malfoy stared at him curiously for a long second as if he didn't understand what Harry was saying. Finally, a smirk crawled onto his lips. He took Harry's hand, allowing him to help him to his feet. "You wish."
Instead of looking back at Harry, Malfoy’s eyes darted around the room at their fellow eighth-years. “Later,” he spoke on a breath.
“What are you on about now, Potter?”
Draco crossed his arms, leaning away from Harry to size him up. "I'd like to just see you try to be rough with me."
“No, I’m not. I have very little experience, in fact. I’m not exactly great at making friends.”
Malfoy’s mouth became thin and, even sloshed, Harry could recognize the very unamused light of his eyes. “Did you actually wake me up to ask me this?”
He shoved away from Malfoy, his hand scraping for his wand below his pillow. Malfoy had thrown himself at the other side of the room with his hands up as quickly as possible. “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” he said quickly. “You were groaning and crying in your sleep. I was only trying to help.”
Many didn’t like to think that Draco didn’t actually like having the Dark Lord around him. Likely, none had dreamt that he had ever pointed a wand at Draco. They thought they had all been great friends, watching the world crumble and laughing manically together as people died at their feet. In actuality, Draco had very narrowly kept himself from being one of those people.
Beginning to feel like a creep for staring so long, Harry finally turned away and went to his own bed. Maybe he would be able to get a whole six hours this night.
Malfoy nodded silently.
This request, Harry obliged to. With his sight cut off, he concentrated on the other senses. The feel of the golden rays of the afternoon across his face warmed him.  The light breeze tickled his nose and shook the leaves of the trees, the swishing sound mixing with distant chatter and the intermediate scribble of the pencil beside him.
hated
Harry stared at him for a long moment. Typically, Ron would have scoffed at anyone trying such a thing on Harry, but he was repeatedly being surprised today. Once again, Harry acted contrary to his usual, stubborn character and eased into the cot. “Okay.”
Draco was barely listening. His mind was moving a mile a minute, trying to find answers. “I can’t be your little experiment. I can’t do that. I’m sorry.”
“Still a coward.” Harry eyed the boy who wore pursed lips and a raised chin, his eyes also on the scene. “That’s never been something to bother me. Everyone here thinks we’re dating, and I’m still around.”
The usual alarm broke Harry out of a wonderful dream. He groaned in defiance. However, as he went to move his arm to shut it off he found it stuck. In an instant he realized his dream hadn’t been a dream at all. There in his arms was the sleeping form of Draco Malfoy.
All he wanted to do was see what their reaction would be to the dragon. He wished he could see their face when they opened the book. He really hoped leaving it flattened like that for so long didn’t ruin the spell work. He didn’t think it would take all day for them to see it. Considering Draco spent the whole evening in the library and never saw anyone going to the Muggle-Fiction section, he assumed they had some free period during the day which was when they were responding to him. He kept wondering if they’d seen it yet, checking his watch repeatedly and wishing the little hand would hurry up so he could talk to them again already.
Harry moved closer to Teddy, dropping his voice to a whisper as he interrupted the child’s train of thought. “Remember that Malfoy I said I wanted you to meet?”
Harry sat up, dismissing Hermione’s nagging and the pain in his abdomen. “How is she?”
"Good for you," Harry praised though he wasn't entirely sure what that was, likely a university. He was aware getting into medical programs was hard. "Er…" He felt a little odd congratulating her, considering he didn't even know her name.
Harry’s shoulders fell. A long sigh left his lips and settled back onto the edge of Teddy’s bed. “I’m going to tell you something my own godfather told me. No one is really good or bad. Everyone has both light and dark inside of them. What matters is the part we choose to act on. The Malfoys made very bad choices in the past, but some are trying to fix it.” Harry bit his lip, suddenly remembering the time Draco had tried to surprise him by cooking dinner once. For someone who was good with potions, he was horrible at putting edible ingredients together. “Some of them can actually be very sweet…”
The moment he stepped into the ministry it was second, fourth, and fifth year all over again. He was once again the heir of Slytherin. He was once again the second Hogwarts champion. He was once again the Boy Who Lied. Everyone stared. Everyone whispered.
“Why wouldn’t I be?”
He ran his finger across the length of his lower lip to look for any imperfections; however, a strange thought entered his mind. Malfoy was still running ramped in his thoughts, and therefore they brought him back to only seconds ago when Malfoy was tracing his thumb over Harry's lip. Another shudder ran down his spine.
Draco snapped his head up. “You’re home already?” He whirled around looking for a clock until he found that it was in fact five past 6 o’clock. His shoulders fell. “Oh, I didn’t notice the time.”
It got to the point that Harry actively tried to avoid overtime. He hurried out of the office, usually before Ron could even say goodbye.
“I’ve just been finding other ways to distract myself. I’ve mostly been exploring muggle London.” It wasn’t a complete lie. He and Draco did a lot of exploring, although it usually remained in a three-block radius of the flat.
The day of worry finally vanishing off his back made it very easy for Harry to fall asleep that night. He might have even been able to stay asleep all night long if something hadn’t woken him.
Malfoy nodded again and looked down at where his long pale fingers began to run across the pages of his book. “She’s invited you to come for– Well, whenever really. She said she’s been wanting you to come over, actually.”
With a little work, it might actually be quite nice. Replacing with the old wallpaper with a layer of fresh paint and finding a curse-breaker who could finally unstick some of the portraits on the walls. Just taking down the thick curtains which lined every window would probably do it wonders. While he couldn’t picture living here again, he also couldn’t see just leaving such a place empty to rot. Even a place like this deserved the chance to heal.
The years had not treated him kindly. He looked worse than the state Harry had found his son in. Not only was he thin but his face was sunken and gaunt, his receding hairline only making it more noticeable, while the patchy beard he’d grown in his isolation did little to cover any of it. Harry couldn’t help but see a better dressed Mr. Filch.
He frowned. “What is that supposed to mean?”
As he got closer he overheard the one who knew as Harper from his days on the qudditch team speaking. “How
“School was a confusing time for everyone,” Harry pressed. “I can’t speak for Dean but I know I cared about her, I still do. Besides, it’s Ginny; I’d feel bad for anyone who tried to use her just to get Hollyhead tickets.”
Harry's eyes widened, first in great excitement and then in surprise. His gaze skimmed over Draco once. "How do you know that?"
Malfoy frowned at him. "What is-?" He shook his head. "It doesn't matter. Most of it came with the apartment. The last tenet didn't want it."
Draco shook his head side to side. “You know, you’re getting to be far more romantic than I ever would have imagined Harry Potter to be. I thought you were a fumbling fool.”
Ron gave him an apprehensive look before he walked through the door that Harry held open for him. “Did something happen?”
“Go get him, I’ll head off Goyle,” Harry said, already starting towards the marked door.
“Duly noted.”
“No! Anyone who helps me gets hurt!” he snapped. “My parents, Sirius, Moody, Snape, they all tried to help me and look what happened to them. Until I was eleven, I was alone, and I dealt with my own crap, and no one got hurt.”
Draco pursed his lips. “Visiting my mother in Versailles isn’t traveling. We could visit Paris for a day or two but that’s no way experience it for the first time. You’ll need more than a week to do it properly.” He pulled gently on Harry’s roots. “I’m sure Saint Potter could get more time though.”
“I just want you.”
With no time to waist, Harry hurried back to the Ministry. Despite understanding its purpose, he silently cursed the one-way apparition wards on the Auror office which only allowed people to leave the office area but not come back in - Aurors needed to be able to get out quickly to respond to cases but allowing just anyone to pop right in was downright stupid.
The simple, blissful curve on Harry’s mouth twisted up into a goofy grin. “A bit.”
The creases in Draco’s brow deepened as his jaw locked. “I don’t believe you.”
Zabini closed his magazine. “Last year really did put a number on you.”
The eggs, mildly undercooked, were pulled off the hot burner before Draco twisted in Harry’s arms. Harry was grinning in triumph. His smugness prickled hot against Draco’s skin. He found his revenge by smashing his lips to Harry’s. Draco hooked his fingers onto his waistband and yanked Harry’s hips closer, eliciting a soft moan from the other man. Draco smiled now.
Harry shook his head. “No, well- Yes, but I think it’s more about what they were talking about.”
Harry dropped into the seat across from her and Ron. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
“I thought you said you didn’t read it.”
“What’s the big deal? You and I used to sleep in the same bed all of the time when we were little.”
“If I hadn’t known better, I would have thought you were expecting me to kiss you.”
“You can’t actually be standing up for this fa-”
Harry clambered up to his feet. Malfoy watched him rise out of the corner of his eye. Harry offered his hand. "Come on. We still have plenty of food here, right? Or are you too scared to use chopsticks again, Malfoy?"
Hermione entered the Common Room with a chip on her shoulder. Her eyes instantly found Harry, who’d been trying to focus on homework and was failing miserably. “Harry James.”
“Yeah, it’s sort of a ‘just shagged’ look,” added Susan Bones from beside her, earning a bemused look from her roommate. “If you two have started shagging, then someone somewhere must be owed some money. There had to be at least one person out there who put a bet on it. It’s a shame it wasn’t me.”
“Harry,” he corrected.
Malfoy’s eyes found him again but they were far more fierce than Harry had seen them for some time. “What about it?”
"Wait, wait, wait," Harry fervently shook his hand in the air. "Does this mean there are photos like that of you?"
Malfoy’s eyes lit up but Harry did not see the malice he tried to put into them, only the evident truth they were attempting to burry. “Wait, you really think that?” Harry demanded.
He blinked up at the ceiling, still feeling Harry’s lips pepper his neck. The ceiling was unusually low, not just from a building standpoint but as if it had sunk with age. It wasn’t a wild thought considering how old the house was. The house. Grimmauld. They were in Grimmauld. Draco was making out with Harry Potter in his ancestral home.
Harry's eyes snapped up. Malfoy was frowning at him, looking rather concerned that Harry would say such a thing. "All night and all day? Are you sure I'm not moving in?"
Malfoy stopped and stared back at him. He was trying to find something, but it wasn’t working. Maybe it was a shadow or just Harry’s sleepy eyes, but Malfoy’s cheeks seemed to darken. “I’ll have you know; I wake up looking perfect.”
Narcissa and Pansy weren’t the only people in Draco’s life. Harry hesitated, uncertain if he should even hint at it. They needed to be on the same page though. “And your father?”
Malfoy snapped his lips into a firm line. “I apologized for that.”
It was an understatement to say Harry was happy to be back at Hogwarts, though there was a pang of guilt in his chest at the thought. It disappeared when he saw a familiar blonde sitting in his usual corner.
Harry gave Ron a quizzical look, but he didn’t get to ask any questions. “Harry!” Harry spun around just in time to see the red-headed child running at him before launching himself into Harry’s arms.
He felt his wand slip into his hand. There was something he was supposed to be doing. He was supposed to be looking for something. He had to move.
“Good plan,” George agreed, he dropped his folded arms and let out some of the tension on another breath. “Half that stuff was absolutely dung. Even Malfoy, Snape’s potion protégée, couldn’t create a love potion that doesn’t make the drinker noticeably daft. Trust me; we tried it too for our Wonder Witch line.”
A weight pulled off of Ron’s chest. “Really? That’s gre-“
It began to stir him even more. However, when he pulled away for a momentary breath, he saw Draco’s face crumple up. “Your breath is horrid.”
“Potter.”
Harry didn’t really notice his feet drawing him towards the occupied bed. Every time he grabbed another drink that night, he had thought of Malfoy. He thought of coming up here and asking what his problem was. Each sip was supposed to be a final shot of courage, and yet he never stood up.
Harry threw one last smack at Malfoy’s leg before turning back to the game. Malfoy was still smiling, and it was evident by the way he was already leaning in that their little tussle had not turned him off of helping Harry.
“I’m going to kill you,” Harry snarled. His voice was capped by a hard thunk. Aberforth had just arrived with all four mugs in hand. His eyes darted once from Ron to Harry, then back again before sighing and shaking his head.
After work, he only went home to change then picked up Indian on his way to the apartment. Like the night before, he knocked and told Malfoy the food was there before taking a share and retiring to his bench.
Harry looked down at the address once more. Norfolk. They would need a jumping point in between. He took Ron’s arm and they apparated out of the house.
Harry picked up his arm through the covers. Draco didn’t pull away. He only watched as Harry brought his arm up to his mouth and planted a kiss to the center of the mark. He pulled away, lacing their fingers together before dropping their hands between them again. “Then we’ll only tell the important people and deal with the rest later.”
“Okay, so you’re just magically cured now?” Harry spat. “Magic can do a lot but not that, I know that for certain.”
“Come on, everyone’s been waiting for you,” Hermione urged, pulling Harry towards the door.
“Tell me.” Draco managed to still sound demanding even though his shuttering voice.
Harry flinched at the thought, shaking his head. What was he thinking?
heard you beg a few times.”
“Only the eggs,” he assured.
They both watched her return to the counter. Once she was out of hearing range, Draco leaned over the table to whisper haughtily, "Why'd you say that?"
A smile tore across Harry’s mouth. Instead of going to his own bed, he launched himself towards Malfoy, scooping up the book he’d been reading. “See, all you do is read.”
“What did he want?”
He tried to sit up, but Harry was still latched onto the back of his coat, now out of necessity to remain alive. Malfoy wiggled free of his coat before rolling onto Harry. He pulled up handfuls of leaves and attempted to smother the boy underneath him. It was close to working since Harry couldn’t keep his mouth closed as laughter poured out.
Malfoy pressed his head harder against his knees. "No, no. I hurt you. I keep hurting people. I'm sorry." He clutched his hands so tightly to his head that it appeared like he was trying to crush his own skull.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Please, there’s been tension between you two since your voices started changing,” the pair of men blushed even harder if it was possible, “only we all assumed it was homicidal, not sexual. That’s clearly changed though.”
Malfoy pointed back at the still-open door. "You can go eat out in the rain then."
“And I’m warning you, Potter. You shouldn’t get too close to Malfoy. You haven’t lived with him for the last seven and a half years. You don’t realize how obsessed with you he is. We used to have drinking games solely around how much he said your name.”
“No way,” Ron snarled.
Draco kept shaking his head. His arms became a clear self-hug. “I don’t- I don’t deserve it,” he whimpered and Harry’s blood ran cold. “I don’t deserve you.”
There was one thing for certain, he learned more about Harry Potter’s view of the war in these past few days than any biography could have ever told him. The hunt for Horcruxes must have been excruciating because most of his slurred ramblings were about new places to look or new theories on what the next object could be. Draco had learned some time ago not to sneak up on Harry, but his hypervigilance seemed to double during a difficult night, to the point that Draco purposefully kept Harry’s wand out of reach. Harry suspected everything to be Voldemort coming to attack him.
Kreacher hesitated as if he wasn’t sure if he was allowed to say.
“True enough, I’d still have fun, though, as long as you were there.”
He had left Harry passed out in the bed, neither of them had ordered any delivery this early, and no one had even called up to let them in. It was either a neighbor or someone magical who could easily bypass locks. Knowing his luck, it was likely the latter.
It was Ginny all over again.
“I’m not above biting,” Draco hissed, eyes now closed in an attempt to sleep.
Harry pushed himself onto his side to look up at Draco. The blond placed a placeholder between the pages before finally looking down at him to give his full attention. “It was fine, I guess,” Harry said. “I just… Everyone is so happy.” He hugged the pillow beneath him to his chest, his eyes looking unseeingly at the bathroom door. “Even George looked a lot happier. They reopened Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.”
It was only once they were about halfway there that Harry got a sudden cool chill. His steps slowed as he glanced around looking for the eyes he felt on his back. “Harry?” Draco asked cautiously. “Are you all right?” He tightened his hold on Harry’s hand.
Her face twisted. “Were you really going for a walk, or we’re going to that pub again?”
“You just said I shouldn’t make decisions on my own. Why can you make this one on your own?”
Draco attempted to remain cool, rolling his eyes. “I love you, too, Prat.”
Hermione sighed. Maybe this wasn’t as bad of an idea as it sounded. She couldn’t remember the last time she had seen Harry smile like that. Possibly with Ginny, the first time. It hadn’t lasted long, though. Once the initial joy had passed, they’d been back to their old ways only with small kisses sprinkled in.
The color drained from Harry’s face. “Oh.”
"You were just reading my files!"
Malfoy scowled. "Are you always this awkward when leaving a crime scene, or are you used to the damsels in distress throwing themselves at your feet as you leave? Trust me, Potter, I'm no damsel."
“Show me,” Harry repeated, taking a step forward.
There was no response.
Harry went straight towards the sitting room. Draco pulled himself up, trying to appear as collected as he had earlier. Harry wasn’t fooled. “You all right?”
Strong arms wrapped around his waist. There was a soft, gravely hum in his ear. “That looks amazing.”
He liked being with Malfoy. Never in a million years would he have thought he'd admit that - even to himself. Harry could hardly believe they were the same boys who once despised each other in school. He knew why they had, but it seemed so ridiculous now. All of that mess, all of that hate, all of those fights about things much bigger than either of them; it was all laughable now.
A chuckle rumbled from Draco’s chest. “I suppose I can suffer through it just this once.” By the time Draco was pulling him back for another kiss, the corner of Harry’s mouth had begun to curve up.
Draco sighed as he dropped down beside him. “I suppose you’re right on this one occasion, Potter.”
Malfoy took his outstretched hands to stand as well. The moment they were both on their feet, Harry prodded at the soft spot on Malfoy’s side below his ribs. It earned him a sharp smack on the back before he could hurry away once more.
"No, it's to put bad wizards away," Ron said crossly. He looked absolutely done with this conversation. He was too tired to argue right now. "Terry isn't a bad wizard. He's mourning. If we put away every witch or wizard who acted out after the war, then half of the wizarding population would be in Azkaban – hell, you and I would have been there day one. You know that. Terry isn't a threat. He just needs some help."
He also didn’t want to admit that there was a point that he hoped they lost because a Dementor’s kiss sounded better than what might happen if they won. The guilt of it all felt like a million bricks on his chest. At least a Dementor would be able to take the pain away along with everything else.
Ron raised his hands, quelling Harry. “That aside-” Ron licked his lips as he took in his friend once more. He hoped he wouldn’t have to say this but the frown on Harry’s face told him differently. “-You’ve also never looked at me, or Hermione for that matter, the way you look at him.”
He managed to get to the lift without anyone speaking to him outright. They were likely still trying to process the news. It was still early. Some might have only heard whispers and were yet to even read the actual article.
He was acting childish. He shouldn't have done that.
There was another pause. Malfoy momentarily thought he might be able to get the embarrassing response he had intended. However, after a brief moment of consideration, Harry smiled. “You are pretty.”
? I had no reputation to begin with.”
She looked to her son again. A dozen emotions flashed across her eyes before she finally pulled on a delicate smile. “Hello, dear.” She reached forward for an embrace, her eyes skipping over the young man’s body once more before she closed the gap. “You look wonderful!”
He succeeded. No one wanted a Malfoy around. His father would be rotting in Azkaban for the next three years and Draco and his mother were social pariahs. No one would ever give them another chance. The only man in the world who might have possibly found it in himself to take pity on them had fallen off the Astronomy Tower. Unless his pen pal did.
"Why? I thought you liked it." It was getting a little long but seeing Draco concentrated on a potion with his hair tied back at the nape of his neck held a certain appeal for Harry.
The memory of Malfoy's pale, emaciated form popped into Harry's mind. He wondered when the last time he had eaten was. It looked like it could have been days. Malfoy appeared pretty confident that Skeres hadn't followed him to his house anytime recently. When was the last time Malfoy even got groceries?
And suddenly, the rose-colored glasses finally fell off.
It was some time before Harry realized that the odd looks had stopped. The peculiar relationship between Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter was old news. It wasn’t even fun to heckle anymore. If anything, a mild ring of protectiveness started to form around him.
As they stepped out of dingy lane of Knockturn Alley into the light and chatter of Diagon, Ron gave him a sidelong glance. “You seem distracted today.” He readjusted his heavy Auror robes, looking forward again. “Is everything okay with Malfoy?”
Rustling beside him got Harry’s attention. Draco moved onto his side, his brow knitted together. “If you’re goal was to make me actually interested in something Weasley had to say, then you’ve succeeded. What is it?”
When Harry’s eyes remained locked on the movement of Malfoy’s hands, showing no sign of a change of course. He lifted up the bottom hem of his shirt.
He wouldn’t have been able to sustain this for long but the Aurors made quick work of the stuck door.
“Good afternoon, Ms. Craft. I’ve only come to check in on things on my way home,” he told her. She started down the stairs which no longer were covered by the tattered runner, revealing glossy hardwood that matched the new, sturdy handrail. “How have the kids settled back in?”
“Love him?” Lucius reeled. His eyes had become almost bigger than his head as he stared Harry, attempting to fathom the words he’d just heard. Finally, he gave a loud scoffing noise. “I’m sure you are but this is some trick you’ve pulled on my son. You’re the one who’s given him some sort of potion. No Malfoy would ever behave in such a demeaning manor?”
“Why not?” snapped Draco. “I did horrible stuff to him back in school. This would be a perfect opportunity to get revenge.”
“No, I was only…” What was wrong with Draco? It really wasn’t a big deal, and yet he could hardly keep himself from staring at Harry’s shirtless chest. An intense and confusing feeling twisted in his gut. It was baffling. “It doesn’t matter. You’re right. Forget it.”
There was that speculative look again—searching for lies, searching for truth. “I know you think you mean it.”
The dim fireplace suddenly became very interesting to Harry. So interesting, in fact, that he was too focused on the crackle to hear a word Malfoy said.
Draco still looked utterly bewildered.
The boys, who slowly finished separating, both nodded. “I’ll come with,” said Ron, his voice hoarse. He looked back at Harry as he stood up. “To make sure she doesn’t burn the chocolate.”
“In your dreams,” George teased.
Ron watched as his friend dropped into his desk chair and began to go through the backlog of papers. He hadn’t seen Harry volunteer for paperwork in months. It used to be common ― no matter how much he hated it ― just so he wouldn’t have to go back to Grimmauld. In bouts of pity, Ron would often invite him over for dinner, which was usually followed by him crashing on the couch ― something else that hadn’t happened in quite some time.
They were right. He would have to do a lot more if he ever expected anything to change. Helping Neville once wasn’t going to cut it. He didn’t want to be best friends with anyone, but he wouldn’t mind not being scared to walk outside the library anymore.
“Of course.”
"Wine?" Malfoy spoke rather enthusiastically. He threw open the door without any other prompting and beheld the small walk-in closet of vintage wine bottles. "Did you even know this room was here, Potter?"
Goyle chuckled bitterly. “I get the best rewards that way.” Harry tilted his head in question, his brow knitting together. “Don’t make a lot being a caretaker,” Goyle spat. “But some people at the Dailey Prophet will pay a lot for what I know. You should have seen what I got for your story.”
Harry’s voice was low and coarse, almost sounding how he did when he first woke up. “Not everything is your fault.” Draco’s face pinched. “But you’re only letting
Avada Kedavra.
Malfoy huffed as he yanked the covers over his shoulders. “The feeling is mutual.”
For a solid second, he thought that his heart had actually exploded in his chest. It felt like it had. If he didn’t know what it felt like, he would have thought his ribcage was bruised by the blast from the way it ached. He could easily be convinced it still was. He might have wished it had. If he were dead, at least he wouldn’t have to face what was in front of him.
“You’re a very tricky man to track down, Mr. Potter,” she said, a hint of amusement in her gaze as it flickered towards Draco. “You always did have such a fascination with Mr. Malfoy...” she hummed thoughtfully. “Of course, professors never gossip.”
“Goodnight,” Harry hummed.
Harry shrugged. “I stopped caring about what other people thought about me a while ago. Years of you bullying me, remember?”
Zabini looked at anything except for Draco. His jaw was twitching, and Draco could practically see the words he was biting away.
Draco frowned.
Harry took his hand. It continued to shudder involuntarily but his mind stilled. He looked to Harry with wide, uncertain eyes. “Are you sure you want to go?” Harry gave his hand a small squeeze. “I can tell them you’re sick. I’ll make an appearance and be back in an hour.”
Malfoy shook his head, "I wouldn't expect you to understand, but a lot of work goes into each of these bottles, and none is exactly like the last. It's only polite to appreciate everything that goes into each bottle."
“Well, I’m afraid your influence isn’t very favorable at the moment,” Robards said without a hint of remorse. “In fact, I think anyone involved with your family is leaving themselves open for quite a bit of criticism. That’s why I can’t imagine Auror Potter would intend to be connected to any of you. Given that I don’t believe anything illegal occurred, I urge you to take this personal matter out of my department.”
to be happy and not feel guilty about it.”
There was a moment of silence before the begrudging mumble of, “Goodnight.”
Upon entering Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, Harry was greeted with familiar colors and bangs and pops all around. There was so much to look at that no one paid the owner or Harry Potter any mind as they made their way through. George paused at a display of Bombtastic Bombs to inform the group of kids eyeing them that they currently had a back to school sale.
“Yeah?” Harry asked. He wasn’t sure if did or not. Could he even teach? Sure he’d done it for Dumbledore’s Army but that had been different, hadn’t it? He remembered the swell of pride each time one of his friends performed a new spell he taught, especially ones they had trouble with. He remembered the way he admired Remus and Dumbledore and McGonagall, herself. Could he be that for someone? Instead of being a distant hero, could he actually inspire the next generation to think critically and be a good memory for even one kid?
“Yes- No! Wait.” The elf started towards the alcohol cupboard but stopped at Harry’s request. “Go to Malfoy’s,” Harry ordered. Harry went through his pockets, searching for the muggle wallet he now kept on him at all times since he didn’t stop at Grimmauld before going out anymore. He pulled out the slip with Malfoy’s address and handed it to the elf. “Tell him I’m not feeling well, and I won’t be over tonight. I’ll be in my room.”
Draco abruptly sat up. Harry’s body loosened beneath him. It wasn’t relief; that’s not what he saw in his eyes. It was only disappointment and a small pinch of hurt.
“Helping me heal.”
Harry moved a little closer but didn't touch him. "Malfoy," he spoke as calmly as possible. "Listen to me. It's okay. I'm not going anywhere. I won't make you go anywhere, I swear. You're safe. Just try to breathe, and it'll pass. It's going to pass."
Malfoy could still feel him trying to hold back. He gave a tight squeeze and mumbled into Harry’s ear, “It’s okay. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Hey,” Robards scolded, “if more of you would get a little chummy, maybe we’d get some more of the crazy ones like Macnair off the streets. His information was good. Don’t go chasing off my informants.”
Harry nodded rapidly. He pounded his chest once more and cleared his throat before taking another full gulp of the wine. "Yeah, I'm good," he said, his voice still strained.
Pansy had made several inferences about their relationship and it had taken this long for Narcissa to come to terms with it. Before she did, however, she decided she had to see it for herself. She thought she’d have to dig harder. She thought her son would try to hide it. Here he was though, scolding Harry Potter for not doing the dishes properly. He’d grown so much. Once again, Harry Potter had let her see her son.
Harry spotted the way Draco turned his head at every slight movement which went past the door. Without so much as looking at him, Harry slid his hand over Draco’s where it was rested on the side of the bed; he massaged small circles into the back of his palm, silently imploring him to relax. It worked to some degree, but he remained quite tense.
She watched as both men became considerably more at ease with no one else in the room ― more at ease than Hermione’s seen Harry in a long time. Draco perched on the cot. He said something that caused a broad smile to split across Harry’s face. Hermione couldn’t remember the last time she’d seen that smile. It made her smile, too, despite herself.
She sat up, releasing his hand instantly. “Already? They said they just cleared you. We were waiting outside before they even allowed visitors in. I never saw... How could…”
Terry was the one to sit up. “No, not really. No one does. They just… they were close is all, and now they’re not.”
Draco shook his head. "I'm a Malfoy. Before, that meant I was supposed to be a ministry man like my father was. I wouldn't have any time for silly little things like doodling. Now… Now no one would want anything I created except to maybe destroy it. There's no point."
“No, we’ll need to have this conversation sooner or later,” said Harry. “We should have it now.”
"You were always so confident," Harry said. "You were never afraid to be yourself. And it aggravated me sometimes, but I also really admired that about you." Draco could have the whole school hating him and still walk through the halls with his chin held high. He never cared about what others thought before. Maybe that was why it had been so jarring to see him lock himself up in fear of the rest of the world.
Only a second passed before Harry’s words sunk in. Malfoy glanced past his shoulder to where the backs of Granger’s and Weasley’s heads could be seen at the sofas.
“What? Why not?” Harry practicality whimpered.
“Do it tomorrow,” Harry said, “and be discreet. Robards won’t approve of me searching on my own. I’m already on ‘voluntary leave’ so that I’ll stay out of trouble. I don’t want to give him a reason to suspend you because you’re helping me.”
"What is that supposed to mean?"
She frowned at Harry as if he was being purposefully obtuse. “To find Malfoy, of course.”
“I’ll go talk to him,” Hermione said. She started towards the door and was halfway out when she paused. She looked back at Harry. Her brow was furrowed, and her mouth hung open, but she appeared to quickly reconsider her thoughts and darted out of the room after her boyfriend.
"Yeah, right," Ron scoffed loudly. "This is a muggle apartment. There is no way in hell Draco Malfoy," he said his name like it was a horrible disease, "would ever live here."
He didn’t show a hint of fear. On the contrary, he was trying not to laugh. “Down, kitty. You’ll get wrinkles by frowning like that.”
"What do you mean by dealt with? Wasn't he already detained?" Malfoy urged. Harry didn't know what to say. He tried, but nothing came out. The frown on Malfoy's face slowly eased, but it was replaced by unsettling apathy, his eyes becoming so dull that they almost looked dead. "They let him go, didn't they?"
Sadly, with only two plates and cups, there wasn't much to wash. When he was going to put up the rest of the leftovers, he began to explain putting things in proper containers until he realized that Malfoy didn't actually own any. Malfoy still didn't really own much of anything. Most of the stuff he had was leftover by the previous owners or was stuff that Harry had gradually brought over from Grimmauld. About the only things that Malfoy truly owned was the table his mother bought him, the books on the shelving unit behind the dining table, and a few miscellaneous items like the dark green blanket on the back of the couch and the old alchemy box shoved in the corner that was likely forgotten about.
“If he would have just let us finish you off, no one would be dead. I used to think it was because was a coward but now I know it’s because he had a crush on you. It’s pathetic.”
George swallowed the lump in his throat. He tore his eyes off of Draco to look down at Angelina then finally nodded. She led him out the door, Charlie and Ron jumping out of their way.
“I’m not going anywhere.”
“Mistake?” Harry repeated. For some reason, that word sounded strange. If he didn’t want this, he could simply say that. Mistake meant something else. Mistake meant doing something you wanted to but knew you shouldn’t.
The glares and thick silence between the pair was enough to make anyone notice the sour note between them. However, Harry, who’d been ducking from a trio of rather persistent fifth-year girls, had overheard something that sounded far more personal.
Draco had seen them when they were brought to the manor and the war was at its peak. They were dirty and haggard, but they were fierce. They fought sharp and hard. Rabid animals with their back to the wall. There had been no flourish to any of their movements, they spared just enough energy to get the job done then retreated.
Harry shook his head though it felt like it weighed a ton. “Don’t… It’s my fault.”
bad!” Indeed it was bad but not both names bad.
Harry leaned his back onto Malfoy's shoulder, a massive grin on his face. "I thought I was a cute puppy?"
Half of Malfoy’s smile fell off as he observed the boy beside him. “You’re joking, right?”
All of the titles of the books seemed very fanciful indeed.
It was only when Harry hit a sweet spot and Draco heard his own moan in the air that Draco found some sort of focus.
Malfoy scoffed. “Please, I assumed you had been all talk and didn’t expect me to actually show up. I was being chivalrous and allowing you to bow out with your pride.”
“Excuse for what?” Harry’s voice was a low hum, most of his concentration going towards the fingers, which now began to tentatively trail behind his ear and down his smooth, white jaw.
“Wait, no,” Heather called, waving after them. “Don’t leave; I’ll keep her in line. I want to hear all about how you two got together.”
Hermione scoffed. “Harry, your type of adventurous is trying a new brand of beer, not tea.”
Warm joy began to pump through Draco’s body. He grabbed his coat and followed Ron to the door. Ron walked straight out, barely waiting for him, and started down the hall. Draco was nearly so distracted that he did the same –
Harry likely would not have slept that night if it were not for the liquor pounding his temples. When he awoke, he did not remember what had happened. That was until he looked over at the empty bed, and his chest ached.
Arguments became commonplace. Harry wanted to do everything for himself, and the more Draco said no, the more Harry wanted to try to do on his own. It didn’t help that they had no break from one another. While the pair lived together for all intents and purposes, they had never spent quite this much time with one another. Harry typically spent his days at the office and his sober evenings with Draco. However, Draco was quickly beginning to understand why Ron and Hermione wouldn’t allow painkiller potions.
There was really only one thing he could do. “What I want to know is how those pictures were taken in the first place. They were in front of Draco’s apartment which no one knows the address to besides a handful of trusted people and a, supposedly, closed file at the ministry. There has to be a leak somewhere.”
Seeing that he needed it but didn’t want to ask, Malfoy wrapped his arms around Harry’s shoulders and pulled him into a tight embrace. Harry began to soften. His fingers twisted into Malfoy’s shirt at his waist. His face resting on Malfoy’s shoulder
“Why do we even need prefects for the eighth-years?” Ron gave his usual protest. “There’s only twenty of us.”
Harry couldn’t hide the smile on his face. “I didn’t ask if you were into me, only if you enjoyed the view.” He began to button up but may or may not have been going slower than usual. “That doesn’t have to mean anything.”
Right, drunk. That’s all this was. Leave it to Potter to be an affectionate drunk. It was the best way to completely destroy Malfoy, after all.
Draco had spent the whole day trying to stay distracted so he wouldn’t watch the clock. He reordered their whole wardrobe and then moved on to do the kitchen cupboards as well. He’d been going through the fridge when he decided was going to attempt dinner again for Harry. However, now that Harry had returned, all of that didn’t seem to matter anymore. He just wanted to keep kissing Harry.
Draco frowned now. “Where is this coming from all of a sudden?”
A breeze lifted over the grounds once more, sloping down into the basin of the lake and stirring the trees.
The events of the day before flitted through his mind on repeat. So many things had happened, and yet, at the same time, very little had happened. This was the most significant difference. Draco was still in the room when he woke up—and Harry was okay with calling him Draco.
He followed her out the door. “Granger.”
A mild-weathered Saturday was almost impossible for anyone to ignore. Harry and Malfoy were not the only ones to venture down to the pitch, but when a few sixth-years tried to tempt Harry into a game, they were all more than a little miffed when he declined in favor of playing with Malfoy.
Truthfully, he did not want to let go either. He messed with Draco’s hair a lot, but he rarely got to properly appreciate just how soft it was, his fingers gliding through it like white silk. Not to mention the feeling of a chest against his own, the faint movement of his even breath that he unintentionally began to copy, and the secure arms wrapped around his torso. Separating didn’t sound all that great.
They did as told. Pansy trailed after them, pulling a seat up to join them. “So, when did this happen?” she asked, gesturing between the men.
“Well,” Draco forced his spine straight, “give it a try then.”
“Oh, thank you, Professor.” She turned back up the steps to get the rest of the kids.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “So why are you okay with it now?”
Of course, Harry wasn't aware that Draco was having a similar internal struggle. More than once, he'd caught the other man moaning his name at night. And, more than once, he caught himself pleased about it. The latter was more terrifying.
Harry took that as an invitation to move closer. “Go to sleep. I’ll keep you warm.”
It was just enough to make Harry smile. “Maybe you shouldn’t,” he teased, and Draco stilled instantly. “I think I had some unintended motives all along.” His eyes were still locked on Draco’s lips, his hand which had snaked around his waist pulled tight.
“You mean Potter,” Zabini said on a mirthless laugh. Draco knew he shouldn’t stop, but his legs were already so heavy from the long night. “You know he doesn’t actually care about you. How could he? He’s spent the last seven years hating you. Do you really think that all of a sudden he’s in love with you? He’s probably just hoping you’ll spill all your secrets so he can humiliate you.”
Harry had been bouncing out of his skin during most of the day. He wanted to do something. He wanted to go after someone. They were safe though and the wounds were still too fresh, if he went seeking Skeres then he’d do something stupid. He knew he had to wait until Ron came by.
Draco shook his head, looking back at the books. “Go back to work. I’m fine.”
Soon, the only sound in the room was their breath and Malfoy's periodic sniffles. Harry slowly eased himself to the other side of the narrow hall, pressing his own back against the wall. He watched as Malfoy slowly unraveled himself, lifting his head before hurriedly whipping at his damp face in hopes that Harry didn't catch his appearance. Harry didn't care. No one was pretty after a panic attack.
Their particular snitch seemed adverse to the actual pitch and took them nearly halfway around the castle, dodging turrets and skimming the low hanging cloud bank. More than once, Malfoy had gotten an edge and it looked like he was very close to doing as he promised. It was only the fact that Harry was more willing to get a little wet when diving for the snitch over the Black Lake that he managed to latch onto the snitch. His legs got a little wet when he was pulling up at the last minute, though he barely dodged the tentacles of the giant squid which appeared annoyed at being disturbed.
Harry was abruptly distracted. Dark cloth interrupted his vision. He yanked the shroud off his head to find that it was his own coat. His eyes darted up for the source to find Malfoy coming down the steps, the twins just behind him.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Still not my fault.”
“It’s fine,” Ron grumbled at her.
Draco thought for a moment, his hand brushing along his jaw in his contemplation. "Fine, but only him. I don't even want Weasley or Longbottom to know. There's no telling how bad they are at keeping their mouths shut under coercion."
Harry turned his head, his eyelashes fluttering as he dropped his head into his palm. “It’s all right, Malfoy. Your robes are fitting you very nice today as well.”
Ron seemed to process this information faster than Harry. His mouth fell open. “Seriously! You didn’t even tell him?”
“Just because you guys don’t get along doesn’t mean he can throw you out on the couch,” Harry hissed. “It’s not right.”
“Someone who has nearly been killed, and not just as a casualty of war, it was planned. We all know Voldemort never meant for Malfoy to survive trying to kill Dumbledore. That was just a prolonged death sentence. It’s why we all took pity on him during the trial.”
“Well,” Heather looked nervously between Draco and Harry, “do one of you know what she wants?”
Harry hadn’t started this whole endeavor with the intention of flirting, but he wasn’t stupid enough to not realize that’s what he was doing now. Draco wasn’t that dense either. How many times could Harry hold his hand under a table or call him pretty point-blank to his face before Draco caught on? He never said anything, though. Even the nights spent in the same bed were nonexistent in the light of day.
Harry had finally caught on. He became as still as a board. A wonderer who happened upon a wild animal, or a chance, fearful that it would run away if he confronted it to quickly. “Really?”
"In his office?" Ron's answer came out as a question of its own. "Harry, what are you-"
Draco took the plate and Teddy ran off again. With a sigh, he moved to the narrow stairway to sit on the last few steps while he ate. Teddy had gone back to pick up another slice of cake, presumably to hand it out to the next person like he’d been doing. However, he ran right back over Draco and jumped onto the steps beside Draco.
He was already halfway to the door before Hermione could rush anything out of her mouth, “Ronald, please."
“You’re unbelievable.”
Once both Harry and Draco were adequately dressed, they considered what to do with the day. In an attempt to annoy Pansy just as much as she was annoying him, Draco suggested the English Rose Café. She was absolutely horrified. It was perfect.
The attitude of the previous conversation seeped into Harry's tone before he considered it, "That's my business."
Malfoy scoffed. "I can't just 'pick one.' What are we eating tonight?"
"Doubtful."
“And twice you were nearly caught in the ministry headquarters ― the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Infiltration of the Ministry. And we all know about Godric’s Hollow.” Draco was reluctant to continue, not wanting to think about such things, but he could see it slowly clicking in Harry’s wide eyes. “He’s leaving them places he thinks you should have died.”
"Yeah," Harry lied. "A bit."
Once in a fresh new set of muggle clothes, Harry went down to the shop and picked up all the ingredients he would need. Seeing that he was nearly an hour late already, and the downpour outside, Harry decided to just apparate to the alley across from Malfoy's ― he had too many close calls apparating into the stairwell of the building to continue doing that.
“I’d insult you back but from what I’ve seen your husband can take care of that for me.”
“Come in.”
A short breath pulled from Harry’s lungs. It was the last of the oxygen that went in or out of him for a while. He was too locked onto the grey eyes in front of him, noticing that they had more of a metallic tone and were teetering towards a very light blue. Maybe Malfoy’s hair and fashion sense weren’t the only attractive things about him.
“I’m glad you found her,” Harry said earnestly. When the shop first opened and everyone had begun to feel the war looming nearer, Weasleys’ had been the only place left with any spirit left on the whole street. It was a beacon of hope. However, afterwards, when everything began to get built back up, like a scar on the street, the lights of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes had gone out. What had once everyone’s hope had become a reminder of their loss. It was brilliant to see it back. It was like they were all finally beginning to heal again.
He jumped. He hadn’t expected to feel the hand over his under the table. Harry was still red in the face and sending Ron dark looks but it was certainly his hand on Draco’s. Draco’s eyes darted around for any witnesses but Molly was the last to sit and she was tucking herself at the other end beside her husband.
Malfoy left his side and went up the stairs behind Neville and Hannah, presumably also to grab his coat.
His fingers were trembling when he put the book away that day. It didn’t get better when he returned Wednesday. He could feel his heart doing flips in his chest, threatening to knock him over with its nerve.
Pansy stared at her drink apprehensively as the boys sipped away, utterly untroubled by their own. “It won’t bite you,” Draco urged after a few seconds.
She started to walk away. Harry was still reeling from everything he’d just been told; however, a thought still managed to wiggle its way into the forefront of his mind. “McGonagall.” She paused and looked back. “Thank you.” Her head tilted quizzically and he tried to put as much earnest into his voice as possible. “Thank you for everything.”
“That’s your type, mate,” Harry reminded.
After everything he would need for dinner was collected at the end of the table, he went over to meet Malfoy. He crossed his arms and leaned against the doorframe, eyeing the various bottles. "Yeah, it does well as a whiskey substitute if I'm really desperate or really lazy, or both."
Hearing her friend’s given name come from their childhood bully’s lips was strange, especially when it coincided with him talking about the pair having dinner together. Nonetheless, she took another step into the flat. “I’ll give you my number then. Quill?”
dreams. Nor did he dislike seeing Draco asleep in bed after his umpteenth cold shower.
The rush of flames from the mantelpiece which was just out sight tore Draco out of his thoughts. A figure stumbled out, followed closely by another. Molly spun around. “Oh, Dean, Seamus, there you are. Perfect timing, really. Food’s got another ten minutes on it. Everyone’s outside.”
Draco’s immediate instinct was to agree. He wanted nothing more than to hide away in the flat just as he was content to do every other day. However, he could still remember the way Harry had looked at him when he first brought up this party. He’d made an attempt to bring it up casually but he kept fiddling with his chopsticks – Draco should have known something was going on when they got his favorite takeaway. Several months ago, Draco would have shot down such a proposition in an instant but he could tell that Harry wanted to go. The way he lit up when Draco agreed only proved his point. He couldn’t let him down now.
Harry wandered up the stairs around three, almost four. When he got to his room he found the ferret lying in what was meant to be Ron’s bed. He supposed it had been the one that didn’t look previously slept in.
There was another pause and then Malfoy’s eyes widened. “You actually mean that.”
"I know," Draco mumbled. His eyes went past Harry to the wall of windows behind him. The view wasn't interesting enough to look at that long, only more apartment buildings across the street. All the while, he picked at his left sleeve. "I just-" He shook his head, shaking away the thought. "I'm fine." It was easy enough to see that this wasn't true.
Both of the boys looked at Pansy, who was suddenly sitting up very straight. “Are you okay, Pans?” asked Draco.
Another frown formed on the other man's face as he looked first at Harry's load and then his own. "It's not very smart to apparate with glasses and pans," he commented quietly as if he hadn't actually wanted to say it out loud.
“Er, I don’t think you should-”
Draco had started for the door and picked up the other fallen pillow. Harry barely managed to jump out of the way this time. “You’re insufferable.”
“I was in the hospital for one night,” Harry insisted.
“Nothing!” Harry roared.
At first, Harry had thought it was odd that he had returned. He wasn’t alone. No one understood it. Even Hermione had been confused when they’d spotted him in the Great Hall.
She kept scolding him, saying that they didn’t need to know why Malfoy was there. It wasn’t their problem anymore. Harry tried to insist that it really hadn’t been his intention, but when they asked him what his true intention had been, he couldn’t come up with a good answer. He didn’t have one. Nothing other than he didn’t like seeing Malfoy so alone. It made less sense out loud than it did in his head.
Molly smiled and squeezed his arm. “Of course. Everyone deserves a little compassion near the holidays. Besides, I’m too chuffed about Percy and Audrey’s engagement to let anything bother me today.”
“I think you’ve lost it,” Harry sighed.
The brief moment of satisfied calm broke off of Harry like the crack of a whip. Rage filled him to the brim and felt like it would overflow soon. His hand slipped back into his pocket and he could almost feel a spark when his skin touched the holly wood. He knew he could have performed an unforgivable curse in that moment with ease, possibly even with incantation.
Harry’s shoulders fell. This had been what he’d wanted, but seeing it still hurt. He didn’t get to wallow for long.
“No one knew about it until he and Macnair were found unconscious in the streets of Hogsmeade.” Robards glanced at the door behind him. “It’s not the first time he’s been this reckless. It’s just the first time it’s caught up with him.”
The first week of March was quiet in the castle. It was unbearably quiet. Not even Draco would explain it when Harry asked why.
Heather’s face became as red as the scrunch she used to pull back her curls today. Draco and Harry shared a look before turning to the pair of girls again.
To an untrained eye, nothing had really changed between the boys. However, Hermione Granger knew her best friend better than anyone. She had been so entrenched into what once was the Malfoy-Potter rivalry that she couldn’t help but notice something new occurring.
Harry bit his lip and tried to play off the overwhelming feeling in his gut by teasing the other man. “I thought you said you don’t want a dog in your bed.”
Harry frowned and tilted his head. “They’re dating?”
“Potter is a dunce.”
Harry grabbed his coat and walked out the door, slamming it behind him to keep Malfoy from following. He knew he couldn't apparate. His mind was too full, with too much. He could walk home. Only once he was downstairs did he realize he'd forgotten the umbrella they'd brought up in the apartment. He couldn't risk going back and facing Malfoy again, so he braced the rain and let the storm wash away every dark thought in his mind.
It was almost impossible to stop the bitter laugh that fell out of Harry’s mouth. “And have you ever believed me?”
Harry's own petulance was rising in his chest. He snapped without thinking, "I don't know, did you file it correctly, or do we need Hermione to check your work?"
He made an attempt; he really did. However, he had only gotten down to the lobby of his apartment building before he went scrambling back up to his flat. It only infuriated him more as he realized he couldn’t do anything on his own.
Dread slipped down Harry’s throat, closing it up, and twisted in his lungs making it hard to breath. He suddenly regretted leaving Draco home alone even more. His head swiveled towards the door almost instinctually.
Draco swallowed. His eyes jumped around at the many faces looking at him before he took a deep breath and stood.
"Sod off, git!" Harry snapped, smacking the other boy in the face with his pillow. Malfoy only blocked the hit with his arm and continued to laugh.
“No, you just cheat off me.” She turned back to Malfoy, who mainly kept to his book while sitting beside the fire with them. “I’ve been trying to teach them both for ages,” Hermione went on. “I can’t believe you’ve gotten through to one of them.”
Terry took a deep breath. “Gregory Goyle.”
“It’s not always my fault!”
Harry sat up grudgingly, a petulant pull on his lower lip that made Malfoy wonder if he had known precisely what he was doing. With a huff, Malfoy threw off his covers and stood up. He pulled on Harry’s wrists, guiding him to the other bed. “Come on, this way.”
The kitchen was already alive before they got down there. Pots and pans banged as the meal was prepared. They’d decided to hire a few more house-elves and Kreacher had quickly taken to being the head elf of the household. The cavernous room was likely the least changed, mostly for Kreacher’s comfort since it was where he spent the most time. At the very least, it had gotten a good scrubbing and was child proofed as a kitchen could be.
As the ink dried on his letter, Draco began to fold another piece of paper into a dragon. He did a few before he made one that he thought was good enough. Finally, he flattened it with the note and pressed it into the book. With a small tap of his wand on the wings of the dragon, he snapped the book quickly and returned it to the shelf.
"I did," Harry admitted without a hint of hesitation. Draco straightened. "I would've never let you know that, though," Harry added. "I liked how much it annoyed you. I always paid attention to you, though," he rubbed his neck, pulling his gaze away, "actually, I think I paid more attention to you than I did to a lot of other things that were going on. School was such a blur."
Draco didn’t know where to go. People were still in the Common Room, and he was trembling. He decided to chance it and go to his actual dorm, hoping Zabini had abandoned it for the night. Of course, he had no such luck.
What happened?
Harry groaned and fell back against the cushions. “Kill me, please.”
The room was so silent a pin could have dropped and be heard by all. Or, rather, heard by most. Harry’s ears were still ringing, barely registering Robards’ reprimand. His eyes remained locked on Cobris, like a hungry animal ready to strike the moment it was released.
Malfoy scowled at him. Harry straightened and muttered, very intelligently, "Oh." He supposed an Ex-Death Eater couldn't have much of a social circle. Anyone he considered a friend once was either dead, in prison, or likely desperately disassociating with anyone that could connect them back to Voldemort.
Draco looked back to Pansy, who was trying to form words but only looked like a fish out of water. Before she could find her tongue, he launched himself forward and yanked her out of the room.

Draco nodded, not daring to let his voice betray him.
A groan slipped from his lips. His head gave a little shake as he pinched his eyes tighter.
As they walked, people continued to glare and murmur. Harry kept his head low. George, on the other hand, smiled and tossed two fingered salutes to the onlookers. One man mumbled a homophobic slur as they passed and George, not missing a beat, responded loudly, “And to you, good sir.”
Hermione somehow managed to coax Ron back into Harry’s room, but he remained silent in the corner ― lent against the wall with his arms crossed as he stared with a permanent glare out the window. There was still some hesitation in the woman, but she came to Harry’s bedside nonetheless. She was updating him on her newest attempts to gain wages for house-elves when the door opened again.
Malfoy relaxed. He glanced once out the nearest window. There was a steady wind but the clouds looked stable enough to get them through one more class. He sighed as if he was giving into an imposition. “Fine, but I hope you’re ready to lose today.”
“You aren’t fine,” Draco hissed. “You still think you're in the war. That's why you became an Auror. A normal person would be done with violence and justice after everything you've done, but you went back to it! You can't stand being away from it. You just keep punching and fighting your way through life, but your punching thin air, and clearly, you haven't learned anything from it because you still refuse to let people help you. If you keep telling people your fine, people will eventually stop asking; and then when you really do need help, no one will be around. You can’t keep doing this to yourself or your friends.”
