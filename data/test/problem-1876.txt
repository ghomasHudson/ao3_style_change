“Stop that.” Draco gave him a glaring look as he reassured himself that his suddenly quick pulse was because of the adrenaline still pumping through him and not because of the look in Potter’s eyes.
After a moment Pansy and Potter both walked into the brewing room and Draco got busy working on the potion Potter ordered. It was the same one as last time, so Draco let Pansy handle the conversational part, while he focused on chopping up everything he needed.
Slowly he felt Harry’s cock drag out of him and then just as slowly slide back in. The first few pushes were difficult to keep up with as Draco kept his focus on his breathing. The burning was slowly ebbing away as the thrusts became more steady and quicker.
Harry continued pushing in a third finger, which went in with ease at this point. Draco moaned as he felt him push back and forth inside of him.
“I’m joking!” Potter laughed loudly at the look of disbelief on Draco’s face. “I’m fairly certain you wouldn’t sell me out. How could you when you’ve been so openly in love with me all these years?”
“Yes, I’m not dumb, Potter. Why the hell are you asking me? If this is some sort of joke, then it is in very poor favour.” Draco could never know what exactly Potter was thinking, and this could very well be some sort of cruel payback for all the times he had tormented Potter during school.
“Calm down!” Harry said, and to Draco’s surprise he stepped in front of him, shielding him with his own body.
“We’ll see, I guess.” Ginny said thoughtfully, before frowning slightly. “Why haven’t you gone to St. Mungo’s yet?”
Draco jumped back and in his moment of panic he whipped his pillow and smacked the great Harry Potter straight across the face earning himself a loud “What the fuck?!”
“Why not use your wand and save energy. Are you that desperate to impress everyone you come across, oh saviour?” Sure, Draco knew the spells Potter had done weren’t the most challenging ones, but still. The effort it took to do non-verbal, wandless spells wasn’t something to take lightly. Draco had managed a few light spells non-verbally, but never without his wand as well, and it once again showed an inequality between their magical powers that made Draco’s old dislike towards the guy start burning all over again and he couldn’t help himself. “Perhaps you’ve forgotten, but I’m probably the last guy who would find anything you do impressive, Potter.”
“You were backed into a corner. If only I had been able to help you back then. I should’ve realised it earlier myself.” The calmness and melancholy sound of Potter’s voice only frustrated Draco more.
“If you want me to, then of course I’ll come with you.”
He opened his eyes only to find Harry standing in front of him, his shield strong and withholding all the hexes and unforgivables cast their way.
It was a beautiful place to live, he couldn’t deny that. Yet, he already knew that the biggest reason as to why he wouldn’t want to leave this place, wasn’t the endless beautiful scenery surrounding every part of the place.
“Yes, thank you ‘Mione. We’ll be counting on you then.” Potter said gracefully, either not sharing Draco’s dismay or just being able to hide it very well.
“Well, there’s no one I trust more when it comes to potion than the two of you. We’ll try it out tonight then.” Potter said as he handed the potion back to Hermione.
“We better head for the room of requirements for this though.” Granger said as she looked around the library.
more unfair treatment, I’m gonna snap!” Granger looked furious, everyone seemed to back off at her words, feeling the intimidation of one of the brightest witches known.
“Fancy a look?” The cheeky grin on Potter’s face was infuriating just as it had been during the match. But once again, Draco didn’t react the way he wanted to, and instead he felt heat rise to his cheeks as he fumbled for his words.
The potion was put to simmer before Draco turned around to face Potter who was already standing.
“I’m not grumpy.” Draco said grumpily.
“Even if it takes a long time?” Draco felt himself being silly for pushing things, but he was drunk so the restraints were less apparent.
His eyelashes were long and just as dark as the raven black hair that messily framed his face. How could someone who looked so perfect possibly consider Draco, his old school nemesis as anything more than a bother?
“Yes.” It felt tight as Harry pushed further in. Draco clenched the sheets as he took a deep breath. As Harry pulled out and slowly pushed back in, and Draco focused on taking deep breaths, he felt the tightness slowly ease up a bit with the continuous motion.
Draco looked at him for a moment.
“Hello…” Draco walked over, feeling a bit awkward for not having talked to Amelia since she told him to let Harry consider his offer a bit more.
“You don’t want to?” Draco paused as he himself felt a tinge of worry wash over him at the thought of Harry not being as into it as he was.
“Page 354, we will look at how to brew a wit-sharpening potion.” Professor Shrew said while pacing back and forth in front of the class.
“But it’s closing in on Christmas now, will you be able to take some days of for it?” Harry placed two cups of coffee on the table in front of them. The dinner had been amazing as always, and just hanging out and relaxing like this was making life much easier for Draco.
“For once I wish I could give you a decent answer, ‘Mione…” Potter sighed tiredly. “But I really have no clue what is going on myself. We’re stuck. Do you mind stepping through?”
“Are you doing it on purpose?”
“Then you are the one in charge of potion brewing, right?”
“No… wait… Aren’t you going to ask me why first?” Draco felt confused as he didn’t understand why Harry would just agree to something like that without a moment of hesitation.
“Malfoy!” Still Draco hardly registered his last name being called.
Draco turned to look at Pansy as she hoisted herself up on a table filled with Draco’s recipes. Her face lit up at the mention of yesterday and Draco could instantly see through her overly conspicuous innocence.
He had spent quite some time there lately, trying out new recipes and Amelia forcing him to find the drink that worked the best with the given pastry. They had apparently had some really good feedback on the combinations decided by Draco, so now Amelia had also started to take an interest in having Draco test out the new pastries and drinks. Amelia was an exceptional barista and she took much pride in her work. But she said that she wasn’t too good at finding the best combinations of drinks and foods that went well together.
“Our place.”
Yes, in the beginning it had been fun, going to parties all around the country and hanging out with people non-stop. But when the time had come for him to seriously step into the company and work towards becoming the new CEO, he had realised how difficult it could actually be.
“Yes… definitely…” Draco mumbled. “Please…” He knew he was more or less begging, but he didn’t mind. He wanted to feel Harry inside of him, to be connected.
“Really?” A perfect eyebrow raised in disbelief.
“That bastard…I swear…” He huffed, his heart finally calming down enough for him to stop hearing it pounding in his ears.
Draco felt Potter chuckle at his whimper when he broke the kiss between them. “Can I continue?”
“Seems like it.” Potter shrugged. “Although I’m not sure you’ll manage to convince her as easily this time around, considering you literally threw yourself at me.” Draco once again heard the faint teasing in Potter’s voice. It wasn’t malicious, but it was provocative.
“Then can’t we counteract it?”
“Welcome! Just make yourself at home” Hermione said as she opened the door with a big smile.
“Are…Are you okay?” Draco asked feeling a bit uncomfortable with the silence and the staring.
“They
another guy.
“Oh my! That’s very interesting!” Shrew quickly covered up his shock before adding “A hint of ginger roots would’ve made it perfect!” He said as he studied the total chaos that was erupting from Potter’s cauldron.
“Any other person would’ve got their hopes up if someone were touching them the way you’ve been doing for the last week or so.”
After the both of them had been reading for about two hours, Granger decided to break the silence. “Looks like there’s little chance of finding a potion that can actually redo the effect.” She sighed while rubbing her temples.
The bakery was fairly quiet at the moment, and Draco could make out the few of the regulars faces around the tables.
“Yeah, the result is also a lot better, so you won’t see any remnants of the burn.”
“You were always looking at Harry, so you never noticed the snitch even if it was right by your head. How funny that was.” The voice, airy and without malice, yet it felt like a slap across the face to Draco.
“You… I mean, if you want to then you can go… You know… further.” Draco felt himself wince at his own wording, but he couldn’t help but feel nervous and slightly embarrassed when thinking about taking it further. However, he had already started obsessing with the thought of having Harry inside of him.
Somehow the words and tone it was said in, combined with one raised eyebrow made Draco pause, and the words in his head scramble into something unrecognizable.
“You’ll know soon enough; I’m sure people will be more than willing to fill you in on everything.” Hermione said, laughing even more as Ron gave up trying to get an answer from her.
“Honestly, the day where I finally managed to get him to cook together with me was a disaster” Hermione said, giving Ron a look of both fondness and laughter.
“We still need to get hold of the ingredients though.” Draco murmured as he peered over the formula together with Granger.
“If you look at the bright side of things, you’re not stuck in each other’s laps anymore. It might only be a small improvement, but it’s something.” The sheepish look on Granger’s face was not overly convincing.
Harry turned to see Draco fidgeting. It made him look much younger than he was. He knew Draco was 26, while he himself was 24. Somehow Harry felt like he was older than the guy in front of him.
Although he still had to live with the decisions he made and those that he was forced to make, he was finally free to make new decisions that he could proudly stand by.
“Umm… That’s an interesting form for it to take.” Pansy said a bit apprehensively.
“Of course, but you really should-“
Everyone was sleeping over at Harry’s place, as no one was especially keen on going outside in the cold weather.
Draco pondered. Pansy’s good mood had turned into that of an interrogator instead of marvelling at the idea of his Patronus’s shape.
“Why?”
Harry’s eyes widen in shock for a moment before his lips slowly turned into a devious grin. “That’s cunning of you, Malfoy.” Draco felt his body strangely react to the look on Harry’s face and how he used his last name again. “I’m a Slytherin after all, aren’t I?”
“I know that this time it looked rather bad, but I can assure you-“ Draco was cut off before he could properly explain himself. “You don’t have to make excuses, Malfoy. I don’t judge, and if you and Harry want to keep it a secret that’s fine. I won’t tell anybody, and I’ve already told Ron it was a misunderstanding.”
“Trying to run away, eh?” The woman snickered and just like that the spells started flowing from wands all around him.
“I know this might be a bit sudden, but I can’t help it”
Granger turned her head and inspected the redhead that was now openly sleeping on the couch beside her.
The trials were long and took an eternity to get through. It wasn’t surprising as there were a vast number of you-know-who’s followers who had been captured and put up for trial. When it was Draco and his mother’s turn, something rather unexpected had occurred. Before the judges could come to a final conclusion, a last witness was brought forth. The doors had opened and in strode the wonder boy. Draco could do nothing less than stare wide-eyed as Potter started talking. To be fair, Draco hadn’t in his wildest dreams expected Potter of all to jump in and defend both Draco and his mother. The judges all seemed to rely profoundly on Potter’s statement and it only took a short discussion before the judgment was given. Both Draco and his mother were given mercy. No, more than that. They only got a few months of house arrest as well as having their wands confiscated. They had been given replacements that would notify the Auror department the minute either of them performed spells that could imply anything suspicious. It was required to have the wands for at least a year before they could apply for permittance to have their original wands returned to them.
Potter just laughed as Draco busied himself with the potion in front of him and refused to lift his head for the remained of time Potter was there.
He woke up with a jerk, the memories of the war slowly dissipating as he steadied his breath. He glanced through the curtain over at the bed next to him, finding that the curtains had been drawn shut indicating that Potter must’ve come back after he had fallen asleep.
“Luna’s a strong person. She’s not someone who breaks easily.” Potter yawned; Draco could hear that he was close to falling asleep. The yawn was infectious and became a reminder of Draco’s own sleepiness.
“That’s… okay” Draco mumbled through the scarf that Harry had ordered him to wear, lecturing him on his clothing choices for the cold weather.
“I’m beat! I don’t remember the speech ever being that long.” Pansy complained as they were heading back to the common room.
Draco stopped as he, for once, looked around the small town. He usually put on music and kept his eyes on the sea that he could see all the way from his home to Malfoy company.
That was the first of many encounters where Draco was left wordless at people’s kindness and willingness to allow him back into society. More people were stopping by day after day, and at one point Pansy had agreed to working almost full time at the shop to help him. However, he no longer felt the need to scurry off into the back of the shop whenever the doorbell jingled.
The surprise Draco had felt when he had realised that Amelia knew about his feelings for her brother was stunning. He didn’t think anyone would’ve noticed when he himself had spent such a long time even figuring it out on his own.
“Go see him then! Why the hell are you moping around if you’re
“I… actually think they’re decent…” Draco said in a low voice, having difficulties with actually expressing such a horrid opinion. By Merlin, how bad that team was. But oh well… Ron was the worst one to deal with, so the only thing he could do was lean into the awful idea of the Chudley Cannons actually being somewhat good.
“For a little while now, yes.” Potter just rubbed his eyes and yawned, paying very little attention to the prior happenings.
“Do you have your car?” Harry asked, as he stood watching Draco put on his jacket.
Peering into the casserole, Draco saw a mixture of vegetables simmering. Potter grabbed a pan and started heating it. “Steak with vegetables and rice.”
wanting to save everyone, huh?” Draco jeered, knowing he was stepping close to one of the many landmines that was wired into Potter.
With Pansy and Potter promising each other to do the Patronus lessons, Draco could only stand back and watch the horror unfold until Potter was out of the doors, and Pansy waved goodbye long after.
It irritated Draco to no end that Potter wasn’t seemingly affected by anything he said anymore. In the past it had been a piece of cake to get a reaction out of him, but now it was close to impossible.
There was no way she was ever going to allow herself being late for the British bake-off show…. No way…
Never before had he felt so satisfied in life.
The silence took over for a moment before Pansy turned around, a giant grin plastered on her face.
“Oh boy…” Pansy muttered as she nervously tucked a loose strand behind her ear. “Are you going to be alright?” She whispered to him. “Huh?” Draco furrowed his brows at her, not having paid much attention until his name was called. He had been too lost in thoughts.
Potter leaned in and Draco must’ve truly gone mental at that point as his eyes fluttered shut instinctively. Waiting for what he had dreamed about for so many years.
“He just needs time. Sure, he’s stubborn, but he’s also a really great guy and he is good at supporting his friends.” Potter tried to reason, but Draco felt like it would be a futile attempt to try and befriend Weasley of all people.
‘Ahhh… but can I go back there now?’ Draco thought to himself as he shook his head. The pastries had been amazing, and the black-haired girl was cute, yup! That’s it! Nothing else. Draco thought to himself as he opened the door to his home with one last thought of the bakery before focusing on work again.
He paced back and forth for a moment trying to figure out just what exactly had happened. Was it a spell? Had someone broken into their room during the night and hexed them? He figured it could be possible considering how many hated him, but why would anyone want to do something like that towards Potter? He was still viewed as a hero by most people, especially the students at Hogwarts.
Draco knew that was his cue to leave, but somehow his feet didn’t listen to him. He was frozen just as he had been a few weeks prior.
“Here’s something for the headache.” Harry said, placing a vial on the bedside table. “And here’s breakfast.”
Draco felt himself catching his breath and his words falter into a low mumble of nothing as Potter had walked up to him and proceeded to wrap his arms around his waist.
It went in easier than Draco thought it would, considering the size of it. The many times he had been fingered had definitely paid off.
“Don’t mess with something like that. And show some bloody gratitude to the fact that you’re able to live as peacefully as you do, all things considered.” Potter’s voice was low and more like a growl that sent a shiver down Draco’s spine.
He tip-toed over to the desk after having made sure that no one was present in the room. He put the tracking device down on the desk and quickly wrote a little note saying he left it there since Potter was not in his office.
“Oh, I’m surprised too. You should’ve seen them when they had to study for it. Both looked like they would die if you put another book in front of them. Luckily they excelled in the physical exam.” Granger said, before lowering her voice a bit more. “Don’t tell him I said this, but Ron’s a mess when it comes to studying. He worked really hard though, so he managed to get through it. Harry, on the other hand, seems to hate studying, but he’s actually rather smart. Seems like when it’s part of something he wants to do, he excels easily. Surprised even me to be honest.” She winked, her eyes shining with mischief and something Draco couldn’t discern.
Draco just huffed loudly, rolling his eyes. “I just let you win, that’s all.”
But why had he stared at him so much? Yeah, sure, even from a guy’s perspective that black-haired guy was handsome, do doubt. But why did he care? It’s not like he was gay or anything. He had just been taken a bit aback by the fact that the guy was unusually handsome is all.
The opposite wall was covered in windows where the curtains were drawn.
Okay… So, I might’ve just decided to extend the story by a few chapters. Just had some inspiration come to me, so I thought, ‘why not?’.
The apartment felt neither too small nor too big and Draco noted that it looked rather stylish, but homely as well.
“To sleep.” Potter yawned as he started going up the stairs, Draco following closely. “You won’t be able to do much with the little magic you have left, so you really should rest. Also, to be frank, I’m too tired to deal with you right now.”
“I haven’t done this before, so you’ll have to excuse my lack of skills” Harry said as he leaned down and gave the tip a kiss before putting it into his mouth.
“Who knows, maybe I’m part of it?” That was definitely over the line. Draco knew it, and he knew he had to say something to ease the tension and get himself out of the situation before he could dig himself even deeper.
“I’d prefer Harry at this point.” Draco licked his lips once more.
Draco gasped as he jolted up in his bed.
Draco shifted a bit uncomfortably. “Well then, I’ll get back to my work.”
“I’m just saying.” Weasley made a piece move and looked up. “You can visit him you know. He talks about you quite a bit, so consider this as me being lenient about your new blossoming friendship. His room is on the second-floor room number 435.”
Draco thought, but just as he started seeing hints of a clearing off in the distance, he could no longer feel any presence behind him. He stopped. This was bad. Where had they gone? This was their one chance to get them all. What if not all of them were following him? They would surely know about it if any of the others got apprehended, and then they would hide, and Draco would never know when it would be safe to be alive.
“Yep, totally fine!” Of course that was Potter’s idea of ‘fine’ as he could very well be lying on the floor half dead and still consider himself as ‘fine’.
Harry got hold of his shoulders and softly pushed him down to the mattress. He continued kissing him, Draco leaned his head back allowing Harry more space to explore his neck, leaving marks as he kissed down to his collarbone. He left butterfly kisses down his stomach, stopping at the edge of Draco’s trousers. With a slow pace he unbuttoned them and pulled the zipper down.
Both Draco and Harry sat down on the couch and looked expectantly at Hermione as she pulled out two vials from a small box and placed it in front of them.
“Like I’d throw myself at you. You have quite the confidence for even thinking that, Potter.” Draco scoffed.
After agreeing to see a mind healer, Draco had felt a weight lift from his shoulders. The mind healer had given him multiple coping mechanisms to use, and they were slowly starting to work on his nightmare issues.
“I’m scared.”
“It means he’s a lot less like he used to be. He’s quite pleasant to be around if I’m being honest. Even Ginny thinks so too.” Potter shrugged.
“Why not? You’re a quick dueller and I happen to be quite aware of your magical abilities, you know.” The reply was nonchalant and instant, surprising Draco slightly. He had never imagined Potter to think highly of him or his magic, considering what it had been used for.
“So you see, the time of day you take the potion is vital for it to work exactly as it should. You have to-“
He pinched them slightly, making Draco gasp. “Fuck…” Harry all but whispered, making Draco think he might’ve fucked up by being way too sensitive. He probably turned him off completely by it.
“We’re clo-“ Draco stumbled at the sight and walked into the stool behind the counter.
“As forgetful as ever, are we? You’re lucky to have saved the world, or your only chance at passing the exams would have been to start over from first year.”  Draco said with a sneer before he could stop himself. It wasn’t the time to start a quarrel, but just seeing Potter’s face was annoying, and having felt his heart jump out of his chest as Potter barged in only soured his mood further. It just felt easier to let the frustration out on him.
A blue wisp of something flew out of his wand and he blinked as he saw it take the shape of a doe in front of him. It took a few steps around the room before looking at him for a moment, rustling its head and then disappearing again.
“I admit that option would’ve been worse. He has shown multiple times to be the type of person who acts before he thinks.” Draco mocked it felt nice to have a chat that felt like old days again.
“You have to eat something, or you’ll get sick during the match.” Pansy looked concerned as her eyes darted between the uneaten soup and Draco’s face.
“So sorry about that.” Harry’s hand was still at Draco’s nape, his fingers sliding through his hair lazily tugging slightly as he did, which sent shivers through Draco’s body each time.
“Yeah, customers feeling that way is what makes it all worth it for me” The guy grinned, making Draco’s eyes linger a bit longer than necessary. He once again took note of the fact that the guy in front of him was fairly handsome even in a guy’s opinion.
“I suspected it must’ve been hard at times dealing with not only one but two people of equal uselessness.” Draco sniggered, as he stirred the potion.
“Cheers to finally breaking the hex.” Harry said, raising his glass. Draco raised his own, feeling a bit lightheaded as they had been drinking for quite some time already.
“No, seriously. There’s no way I-“
His survival instincts kicked in as he grabbed the hand that reached out to him, and yanked Potter down. It allowed him to snatch the wand from Potter’s hand before standing up and pointing it in his direction.
Draco felt a bit of gratefulness from it, as he was not fond of pain and had been scared of being on the receiving end. Yet, Harry seemed more experienced, so Draco trusted him.
“I was just making a play on what Ginny and Luna was going on and on about… I didn’t mean to-“ Potter started, but Draco cut him off.
“Oh, and I did discuss various topics with your mum as well. We became quite close in such a short amount of time.” Harry said nonchalantly as he rose from the bed and got his trousers on. “You want some breakfast?”
“As long as you do your best, no one will blame the outcome.” Draco just shrugged as he did not care to get into the whole ordeal of explaining how even people from his own house disliked him and would make it all his fault if he wasn’t able to beat Potter. Hell, the worst was the idea of having to see Weasley gloat about it for days on end.
‘Oh god…’ Harry thought to himself. He was starting to find the blonde guy more and more irresistible.
“Shut it.”
“You’re a git, you know that?” Draco lifted his head to glare at Potter.
“Can you blame me? He has to deal with you on a daily basis. I’d feel bad for anyone being in that kind of a situation.”
“I’ll be going then.” Draco felt pain surge through him at the awkwardness he was currently enduring. But before he could turn to leave Potter reached out his hand grabbing his arm softly.
“When I first started realising that you might be involved with some of those groups of people, I decided to look into the reasons why.” Potter stated as a matter of fact.
“So, this does not affect you at all?” Potter quirked an eyebrow, which did affect Draco more than he liked.
Draco stood outside the door of the Granger-Weasley family.
“What the fuck!?” He looked just as horrified as Draco had at the realisation.
“That was effective!” Harry grinned, proud of what he had done.
“I’m fine! I’m just… It’s just warm in here is all...”
“What is it?!” Granger’s eyes flew between the two with worry.
“Oh? And what’s that?” Harry was frowning slightly a tinge of worry in his eyes.
He knew Potter wouldn’t like it, and perhaps it had been a desperate attempt at getting him riled up enough for him not to call Granger. However, he hadn’t truly had time to contemplate exactly what Potter would do, and he definitely didn’t expect the reaction he got.
“I don’t think it’s weird at all. It’s more like it fits you well” The guy smiled as he took a bite of the pie.
“Bloody Potter.” Draco mumbled, he yelped as he felt an elbow hit his rib. Granger was giving him a warning look, making him realise that he had said it out loud. Luckily enough, Weasley had been busy filling up his plate and hadn’t heard his grumbling.
awful in any of the classes that it would warrant a retake, you know.”
Granger seemed satisfied with the reaction as her lips turned upwards. “So, you’re not denying it, that’s a good start at least.”
It was weird, Draco thought. Sure, he couldn’t deny that his inferiority towards Harry had somehow developed into admiration and desire much earlier than he would ever have himself admit. However, having the love be reciprocated had not dared to cross his mind.
Two more days went by before Draco could start brewing the potion. He had to ensure that Potter would be occupied for a substantial amount of time before he could do anything.
“So, are you ready?”
“You want to start hexing or defending?” Potter asked, while pulling his wands from under his cloak.
“I’m fairly certain I know which ingredients are needed to counteract the one’s you used, although I’m not completely sure about the first vial one.” She said as she skimmed through a few other potion books to make sure of her deductions.
“Too close.” Draco agreed.
As Draco made a move to straighten himself from his leaning position on the desk, he quickly scrambled back down as Potter had closed the distance between. It came as a bit of a shock when Draco felt a strong grip on his shirt, tightly holding him in place. It was impossible for Draco to try and stand up anymore, as Potter was now in-between his legs, making him awkwardly half sit, half lean against the desk. Potter inched closer to his face; the mask of professionality long gone. It was then Draco saw it, the old Harry Potter. The one who acted before he thought things through. The image dragged him back into nostalgia so much that he stood frozen only able to blink wide-eyed at the green glare in front of him.
“I’m… sorry?” Potter looked flabbergasted at the idea of him leading anyone on with his behaviour. “I’m not used to having someone constantly be so close to me, so I suppose I didn’t notice.”
“You definitely would need a reason. It’s not like you’re a bad person.” The way Harry said it like he was just stating facts was preposterous. Had he forgotten all about the years of him tormenting Harry at Hogwarts and the whole war happening.
“What the hell?! You guys have always hated Malfoy, why do you suddenly act like you’re all best friends now!” The incredulous look on Macmillan’s face was refreshing, Draco though.
“From my own experience, I can tell you that it did help quite a bit.” Harry traced his fingers along Draco’s arm as he spoke in a silent voice.
“I’ll get you some tea as well!” Pansy said, obviously pleased that her little scheming was working perfectly.
always the smartest of you lot.” Draco mumbled as he proceeded to brew a Burn-Healing Paste.
“Yeah, I’m sorry. We just thought it was for the best to keep it secret.” Draco said, feeling a bit regretful as he should’ve known his friends would’ve backed him no matter what. It was good to know nonetheless though.
“This is Draco. He’s my boyfriend.”
know what’s going on!” Draco barked out as he started looking around the room trying to find something that could give some sort of explanation.
“You okay?” He heard, as Harry turned towards him.
“Is it okay to add another one?” Harry asked. Draco nodded; he wasn’t feeling any discomfort at all.
He allowed Potter to lead him over to one of the benches where he summoned a mattress without his wand. It was nothing new that the saviour of the wizarding world could do wandless magic effortlessly, but it was still impressive to witness in action.
“It’s not a joke, Draco. I’m seriously asking you. I wouldn’t joke about something like this.” The sudden seriousness in Potter’s eyes were flustering Draco profoundly.
“What do you care? He’s a fucking death-eater!” Macmillan roared, eyes flaring with anger.
“Wow… Is it just me, or are you two have a blast insulting me?” Potter said, with far too much maturity rather than to bite back.
“Fuck.” Draco could feel his blood boil when he saw Professor Shrew’s delighted expression as he walked over to inspect one of the Patil twin’s cauldron. Draco had been working extremely hard during potion classes, having to make sure he never messed up so that Professor Shrew couldn’t find a way to use it against him. He knew the professor hated him and would use whatever opportunity he could get to make sure Draco wouldn’t get a chance to find a job relating to potions later on.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, no! I’m serious. I can walk! I’ve been walking for many years already! You don’t think I can walk, Potter?!”
“I’m sorry that I’m not used to acting like a pompous prick, Malfoy!” Potter retorted, earning himself a dismayed gasp from Draco.
Draco felt his cheeks get red before he even uttered a single word. “If you let me win…” Draco started slowly, his eyes darting over the pitch before settling on Harry with determination. “I’ll give you a free pass to do whatever you want with me. No complaints.”
“You have poor judgement then.” Draco said, licking his lips unconsciously.
“I’m so sorry mate… This must be awfully difficult for you.” Ron said, giving Harry a sympathetic look.
“Too big of a risk, not gonna do that.” Draco didn’t lift his gaze when he heard Pansy sigh dramatically beside him.
“Thank you.” Draco mumbled, still not quite able to meet her eyes.
He didn’t have as many nightmares when he was in Potter’s body, but he did occasionally wake up in the middle of the night anyway out of pure habit. He looked over at Potter’s bed, a bit surprised as he realised it was empty.
“That’s for looking stupid while you sleep, twat!” Draco yelled and quickly got back to his side, briskly standing up and impatiently waiting for Potter to do the same so that he could escape into the bathroom and die a little more inside.
“I couldn’t exactly say no, so I just threw together what I could find” Harry said as he turned to see Draco had already got his hands on two glasses of champagne.
At that Draco moved so quickly he earned himself a headache from the sudden motion. His whole body withdrew and he scooted back as far as possible in the shared bed, looking at Potter with wide eyes.
“The pastries” Harry said as he filled their teacups.
Draco heard a shriek as he looked up and saw Pansy gaping at the smoke rising from Potter’s cauldron. He heard Blaise mutter to Potter if he was alright. It seemed like both Pansy and Blaise had a hard time comprehending the utter failure that Potter had managed to create while in his body.
Harry was slowly trailing his way up Draco’s thigh, getting closer to his cock. “Fuck.” Draco mumbled as he covered his mouth. It was a sensitive spot and he didn’t want Harry to know just how easily it affected him.
“You’ve got Parkinson and Zabini which is great, but you need to open up a bit if you want to keep good relations with the both of them.”
“Hey Harry! What’s-“ Draco felt himself startle slightly at the sudden voice breaking the silence. A few seconds passed of Granger most likely trying to take in what she was seeing and process it.
Draco whipped around pointing his wand in front of himself “Protego!” The next curse clashed with the shield and Draco knew he was condemned to lose if this continued any further.
“I just don’t like potions. It’s such a difficult subject.” Weasley groaned back. “You get me right, Harry?" Weasley’s eyes were filled with despair.
“I don’t care about that! How long have you been together exactly? And why haven’t you told any of us yet? What do you think Ron is going to think of this?” Said Ginny continuing her bombardment.
“Okay, good. I’ll head back home for now, and I’ll contact Hannah first thing in the morning!” Granger gave them a look filled with both remorse and determination before stepping into the fire and leaving the two boys alone in the embrace of one another.
“Don’t be. They didn’t allow anyone else in for the hearings anyway.” Draco pocketed the wand.
“Ah, well… I was just about to leave anyway, so…”
The great hall was slowly filling up as yawning students entered one after another. Draco was already positioned in-between his two friends who were chatting away about the new defense against the dark arts teacher. “I haven’t heard of her before, but hopefully it’ll be exciting.” Pansy said as she took a big bite of her sandwich.
“Huh?” Potter rubbed his eyes as he sat up, still having trouble getting rid of his drowsiness.
“Definitely.” Draco said, leaning up to kiss him.
“Can I kiss you?” Harry asked with such a soft voice Draco had to strain himself to hear him.
“Oh, get off it! You finally have a chance to get closer to him. Why not take it? You’ll learn a valuable spell at the same time, which is just a bonus to be honest.”
The door creaked as it closed, waiting for the return of a new semester.
“Oh, yeah. I woke up in the middle of the night. It wasn’t exactly the comfiest place to sleep so I carried you upstairs.”
He went over to the dining table where breakfast had already been placed. He looked at a note next to the food.
The words were broken up in pieces and he was stuttering, but Draco got the gist of it.
“I mean, if he can, why shouldn’t he? He’s saved the whole wizarding world, I’m sure some name dropping should be okay.” Weasley laughed, before walking out of the shop.
“Putting all your hope in Potter because of your lack of goalkeeper skills, huh?” Draco jeered back. “Perhaps if you started practicing a bit it wouldn’t all be up to the snitch, now would it?”
“I’m more surprised you didn’t figure that out yourself” Hermione huffed mockingly.
“Well, no pressure, but if you want, you’re welcome to celebrate here. It’s just my sister and her boyfriend and two of my friends, so one more is always welcomed” Harry smiled, and had Draco heard even a hint of pity in the guy’s voice, he would’ve instantly declined, but to be honest, there was no inclination of Harry feeling pity towards him. Instead it felt like a genuine invitation.
Draco waited for a bit longer this time before going over to the ingredient room. He felt his nerves getting a hold of him as he looked around at the various ingredients stacked neatly in each shelf. He started picking out what he needed, while keeping an eye out for someone watching him.
“Even if I say you’re a horrible cook or-“
“Although, to be fair, underneath it all I’m currently in the process of a master plan. Once Potter is reeled in, I’ll go have a cup of tea with Granger and before you know it, you’ll be looking at a new golden trio. A far superior one that is.”
“Well, yes. When I feel like I need to be, I am.” Potter said, his voice low and uncomfortably gentle. “I just…” Potter sighed. “We’re still basically stuck together, so I figured it’s better to properly talk things through.”
“W-what?!” Draco sputtered. There was no way he could’ve prepared for the way things were progressing, and that was the only thought he could take comfort in as he continued to whirl himself deeper into Granger’s trap.
Draco blinked sleepily trying to wake up when he realised, he was being more or less cradled in Harry’s arms. He took note of the potion having worn off as he was no longer glued to Potter’s chest.
“Then why not get back together?” A weird sensation washed over him at his own words, he couldn’t quite figure out why he felt like he didn’t fully mean it.
“It would’ve been so much easier working with you in potion class rather than those two morons.” Hermione sighed, but Draco could hear a certain fondness in her voice when talking about her best friends.
“You want to come once?” Harry cocked his head to the side as he spoke, looking so damn dazzling that Draco almost just let it out.
because of the high-class potions.”
“How dare you suggest I’m less handsome?!” He gave Potter a pointed look, which in turn just made Potter laugh loudly, the awkwardness quickly dissipating.
“Well, it does depend on the ‘someone’.” Potter quirked his lips into a small smirk.
“Why don’t you tell anyone? I’m sure you’d get help if you- “.
“I hope you’re going to say something along the lines of good, great or amazing. If not, then please let me linger a bit longer in my own bliss” Harry joked as he stroked Draco’s hair.
“Oh, don’t worry. You don’t have to leave if you don’t want to. I’m sure Harry would be happy to see you once he wakes up.”
“I am in the possession of quite a few ingredients for poisons here, you know that, right?”
“That’s enough!”
“You’re just a good a seeker as Potter. Sure, his broom might be faster, but you have your wits that you can use.” Pansy shrugged as she grabbed a sandwich and put it down on Draco’s plate.
“Make sure that your memory is truly happy and peaceful, it’ll help tremendously in making this spell work.” Potter said, once again standing behind him, his hand holding lightly onto Draco’s wrist. At first it had put Draco off his game, but now he was slightly used to the comfortable warmth it was emitting. Potter apparently found it only natural to hold onto him so that he could feel whether or not the strength of the magic was increasing.
“What should I do?” Draco breathed out, wanting to do something to make Harry feel good too.
“Harry.” This time Draco felt himself say it as a statement, something that allowed them to break down the distance between both of them.
“Oh! No, nothing like that. I just wanted to apologize for my sudden interruption the other day.” Draco eyed her for a moment.
It wasn’t very pleasant to be at the receiving end of her wand again, but despite that Granger was probably the last to make any mistakes with her spell casting. The fact that any spell aimed at him would most likely affect Potter as well eased the fear greatly.
“What if she actually doesn’t figure out a solution?” Draco tried sounding unbothered, but it was difficult to conceal the worry in his voice at the unlikely but potential scenario that Granger didn’t find a solution.
It was safe to say that both jumped slightly at the sudden sound of the fire blasting before Hermione stumbled out, righting herself before letting her gaze fall upon the two boys over at the dinner table.
“Can I help y-”
“Well, I’m less worried by the fact that Granger is helping.” Draco shrugged back.
Before Potter could make another witty retort, Draco leaned down and pressed their lips together once more. It was intoxicating, and Draco just couldn’t get enough of it. It felt like he was complete whenever his lips were entwined with Harry’s. His hands were clutching at Harry’s hair, firmly keeping him in place so that he could continue his kissing spree.
“How nice of you to point out. Especially when you look no better than me.” Draco scoffed, adding “The endless homework isn’t exactly helping.” He figured the reason would be good enough to make Potter back off, and it was.
“Of course I won’t give up on you! I’m sorry this had such an effect on you both, but it does move the process along faster, I hope that can be of some comfort at the very least.” Hermione looked between the two of them with worried eyes. “You’ll manage through the night, right?”
Rosie tugged on Harry’s arm, urging him to lower down to her height. Draco could still hear her as she whispered to Harry. “Does he like quidditch too?”
No one was particularly focusing on him at the moment, as a few students had crowded around Potter as he had entered a second after Draco.
“I’m sorry.”
Pansy was lurking behind him and had obviously been keeping an eye on the whole situation while pretending to be busy with everything else.
“Hello.”
The castle was still grand as ever. Being up close to it made something inside Draco’s stomach turn. Although the structure itself was rebuilt to the finest details, it couldn’t hide the scars that still lingered in the memories of what had happened there.
“Alright.” Draco mumbled to himself as he stretched his arms above his head, he felt stiff after having stirred the potion for a prolonged time. He then used his wand to carefully extract the liquid and add it into an empty vial, making sure it was shut properly.
“Why bring up the past, Malfoy. If you go around talking like that people might misunderstand, I don’t suppose you’re that foolish.” Potter had seemingly abandoned his work as he was now crossing his arms as regarding him over the distance between them.
“At least now you can go about the house as you’d like instead of walking hand in hand all the time.” Granger grinned at the frown she got from Draco. “There’s so many rooms in this house that it’s only good if more of them are being used.” She looked down for a second, a look of melancholy on her face when her gaze fixated on Potter and absentmindedly said “It’s certainly been livelier in here these past days. This house is too big for only one person to live here.”
“I’d have a much simpler life, though.” Draco sighed.
After yet another day successfully interacting as little as possible with Potter, Draco found himself cornered.
“What happened at the quidditch match?” Now Draco wasn’t sure if something had happened that he hadn’t been aware of.
“W-what?” As Harry had stepped back, Draco didn’t at first notice the alarm’s that was going off on Harry’s reaction. He was instead too amazed at having had the courage to do something he had wanted to do for quite some time now.
“What do you think will happen if the headmistress finds out about this?” Granger looked at them sternly.
“So, tell me. What exactly happened for you to get hit by… I dunno… a Lacarnum Inflamari?”
“Alright.” Draco closed his eyes again. He tried searching for a memory as he had done so many times before. The memories he had tried to use had either helped making the blue sparks from his wand stronger or end up not showing sparks at all. Finding the perfect memory was harder than Draco had anticipated, and many of those he had thought would be him at his happiest, wasn’t giving the spell enough strength. He sighed inwardly, when suddenly he was confronted with a more recent memory. It just popped up before he had a chance to do anything and despite his better judgement, he let it consume his mind. He was laughing and joking with Pansy and Potter as they sat and had tea together.
“Sorry, I should’ve sent a notice before I came!” Granger looked apologetic as she slid out of her jacket and raised her purse slightly. “I was too excited, so I just went straight here from work.”
He heard a faint “Come in.” As he knocked on the door to the Head Auror’s office. Not surprisingly, Potter seemed just as busy as he was standing by one of the smaller tables, looking through heaps of papers.
“I’m fairly certain all of them can be found in the potion classroom.”
“Found it.”
Draco didn’t know exactly what he had expected, but Potter having the silkiest hair despite the unruly curls was not something he had even considered in his wildest dreams. How on earth could a mop of hair that looks so messy be so easy on the touch? It was mesmerizing and Draco couldn’t help but keep touching it.
Potion class was one of the few classes where Draco felt like he had a bit of control over what was going on. He had always liked potion and it was something he had been naturally good at since the start.
“What about you?”
“I’m all in.” Harry murmured as he kissed Draco softly.
Guess this is how a small-town works, Draco thought. He had realised that the people in this small-town seemed eager to help each other at any given time, which was very different from what Draco was used to in the big city life.
“Why are you here, Potter?” Draco huffed, trying to busy himself with stocking ingredients on the shelfs. God, why did Potter of all people have to come waltzing into his shop? It made no sense.
“Come here.” Draco instructed, and Weasley slowly approach him with an apprehensive look.
Potter left the store while continuously praising Draco, which only made it harder for Draco to hide the tint showing on his cheeks.
“I do work part time at bewitched dresses as well. So I have to make sure my style is always up to expectation.”
“Definitely! I believe it’s wise to thread carefully. Hannah and I had to mix this ourselves, so it’s probably good to give it a bit of time so we know for certain.” Granger nodded in agreement.
It had taken Harry a bit by surprise when he realised just how bleak the days felt once Draco stopped showing up.
“You heard nothing, Weasley!” Draco said back, smiling slightly as Weasley laughed loudly.
“Is this what happens when you become Aurors? You all become overly paranoid and takes it out on a humble potion brewer?” The sarcasm dripped from his words as Weasley huffed once more.
“What’s his Patronus?” Draco furrowed his brows at that. Sure he knew Potter could do one, but he had never seen it before with his own eyes. He also wasn’t aware of Pansy actually knowing Potter’s Patronus. When on earth had she seen it?
“When we get back to ourselves, I’ll help you get better at potions, cus that work of yours is truly devastating.”
Just then, an alarm went off over the potion, and Draco hurried to stir it and pour it into vials.
But then why was he feeling so bothered by it? Draco though. He did find Harry’s appearance to be attractive, but any guy would be able to agree on the fact that Harry was attractive. It was just a fact, nothing more…
“Then there’s gotta be a reasonable explanation for all this.” Potter said with a thoughtful expression. “We should try asking Hermione for help.”
“Why is that something everyone thinks?” Harry said with a look of exasperation.
“Oh, well… I’ve just been a bit busy…” Draco could feel himself having trouble being convincing with his words.
“Wait!” Harry said before Draco could turn to leave.
“In the meantime, though…” She gave them both a hesitant look. “You should probably avoid drawing any suspicion to the situation at hand. Meaning you’ll have to act like each other.”
“Let me do it.” Potter chuckled as he carefully managed to free the both of them.
“They only need to understand you more, Malfoy. If you would let more people in, then I’m sure it would make it easier. You should try getting along with Ron and Hermione, they are good people and they won’t be too unreasonable if you give them a chance.”
“Yeah… I know.”
“I did it!”
Draco saw Harry chatting to some of the customers, so he headed over to the counter instead.
“It can’t have been easy for you.” Draco said, feeling a sense of sympathy with what Granger had to put up with.
“Potter?!” He managed to squeak out, still a bit breathless from the harsh handling.
“Yes... She told me think it through properly, and that I shouldn’t just disregard it because of him being a guy and all that” Harry was desperate to hear what Hermione had to say. She was usually much better than him when it came to understanding the big picture and thinking calmly.
Draco just stared at her wide-eyed for a moment before he could compose himself and look away. He didn’t manage to find any sort of comeback to her words, and it didn’t make it any better that he felt heat rise to his ears. He couldn’t discern if it was shame or a blush creeping over him.
“We can do some quick lessons in-between the potion brewing if you want.” Potter suggested, clearly unaware of the hesitation Draco was feeling.
With the comfort of not having Death Eaters at his heels, Draco felt himself slowly sink into the mattress and his eyelids started to feel heavy.
Only, it didn’t. Instead, he felt slightly colder skin on his as Potter’s forehead connected with his own. He kept his eyes closed as he didn’t dare open them, knowing Potter’s face was unbelievably close to his.
“You could live here you know.” His voice didn’t sound very confident, but instead hesitant to the response he would get.
Draco could feel himself shiver as excitement washed over him. He leaned down and slowly took Harry into his mouth. Harry groaned as he grabbed a fistful of blonde hair. As he started sucking down on him, Harry moaned loudly, sending shivers straight to Draco’s cock.
“This.” She held up the last vial that Draco had used to mix into the rest of the ingredients. “It’s not the midnight blue.” Draco frowned as he went over to inspect it. “How do you know? It looks exactly like it.”
“Imagine that! Hey, Luna! I’ve got a great story for you that you can publish once you take over the position at the Prophecy. People will go crazy for this!” Potter just huffed as he defeatedly leaned back and let the Weasley girl have her fun for a while.
“It’s just reading the formula and adding ingredients, how
Harry managed a small laugh before his mouth was once again covered by Draco’s. He put his hand back on Draco’s waist and with the other one grabbed a fistful of blond hair and tried to pull back, but Draco wasn’t having it. He had been waiting so damn long to kiss those glorious lips, and he wasn’t about to let go of his prey that easily.
“What?!” Both Draco and Potter shouted in unison.
Both Pansy and Blaise looked a mix of shocked and delighted at the news of the potion working and was drawn into Hermione’s talk about how she and Draco had been working on finding a potion for ages.
“That’s all?! I can’t believe you’re this calm. Are you not taking me seriously or do you just not like me to that extent?” Draco hissed, feeling impatient to get through this. He had revealed his feelings and the prat was still insisting on being the definition of calm.
“I do, Kreacher, but he’s not up yet.” Said Potter, not looking up as he spoke. He’d now had the decency to put on a sweater, making it less difficult to look at him without distractions.
Draco unconsciously tried to cover himself with his hands, as he felt vulnerable and too exposed. “You know, I’ve already seen your body before, but seeing it like this…” Harry breathed shakingly as he reached for Draco’s hands, bringing them to his mouth and kissing them tenderly. “You’re beautiful.” He muttered as he took in the sight in front of him.
“Hold on…” Potter stumbled out of the bed, and as he stood in front of the mirror, he seemed to have finally woken up properly.
“I see… I thought so.” Draco huffed in response, feeling slightly ill from the notion of knowing it all had had no intention behind it.
He moaned as he felt his hands clench at the sheets, while Harry thrusted hard and steady.
Draco just stared for a minute, as he wasn’t used to this positive and welcoming behaviour.
He wanted to know more about Draco’s expressions. Just how red would he get if he… Harry didn’t manage to stop himself from the temptation.
Thanks for reading. Any comments or kudos are much appreciated :)
“Eh… Well, I’m not particularly good at it, no. I never really learnt how to cook or anything” Draco said, unsure of how much he should tell them about his life.
He felt a knee grace his under the table, and he looked up to see Harry looking at him with a hint of worry in his eyes. He must’ve made an expression as he was lost in his thoughts. Through the loud bickering of Ron and Blaise about quidditch teams, he mouthed an ‘You okay?’ Draco lightly pressed his knee into Harry’s and smiled, giving him a quick wink.
Draco checked his bag once more, making sure the potions were still there. There was a tinge of nervousness flowing through him as he started walking down one of the dark back alleys of Knockturn alley.
“Nothing is going on between us!” Draco was not about to let the girls of the hook just as easily as Potter.
“You gave no indication of that at all!”
The blonde had exactly one second to take in the sight of who was entering, before he threw himself down behind the counter.
“Does it perhaps involve Harry by any chance?”
“If Granger can’t figure it out while putting all her attention to it, I’m not sure anyone can help us.” Draco scoffed.
“So… You two actually aren’t together, huh?” Ginny said thoughtfully.
“One?” Potter tilted his head slightly, making strands of his black unruly hair fall into his eyes. “I seem to recall more than one instance of us playing against each other.”
Draco knocked on the large wooden doors leading into Granger’s office.
“What?” Potter turned around his brows knitted together into a frown as he tried to make sense of what Draco was saying.
The moment Harry and Draco had become closer, she had seen him take much more interest in Draco than anything else other than baking. Amelia had seen Harry’s previous relationships, and to be honest, she couldn’t blame Draco for thinking Harry might feel the same way as he did. Harry had never invested this much into a person before and trusting Draco’s decisions on new pastries were something he never let anyone do.
He stepped out of the bathroom and the smell of pie instantly filled the room. It was amazing to even experience this type of homely feeling, Draco thought to himself.
“Well…I’m not particularly touchy, I think…” Potter’s expression turned into one of thoughtfulness as he slowly stirred the sauce. “I do hug people that I’m close with such as Hermione, Ron and the other Weasley’s, but that’s about it.”
I got it! Draco thought to himself as he got out a sheet of paper and decided to write a list of things that made him like Harry just in general. And then he would be able to see whether or not those things would be more romantic or more friendly.
“Indeed we did.”
Draco wanted to curse himself for having such pale skin that Pansy had no trouble seeing the heat rise to his cheeks. She was obviously having the time of her life bothering him about Potter.
“You two have really gotten close in no time” Amelia said as Harry came back into the bakery.
“Don’t get ahead of yourself. People don’t have to be in love in order to want to fuck you. That thing you’ve got down there would make anyone want to have a go.”
“I’m not trying to impress anyone, especially not you for that matter. My wand is downstairs, and I honestly don’t use that much energy on spells anyway, so it’s fine.” The nonchalant tone and way too honest answer made Draco want to slap the guy. The fact that he admitted to not using much energy on spells in general, wandless or not, made Draco realise just how unfairly overpowered this idiot was.
“Don’t involve Hermione in this! At least I
Hesitantly, Draco took a breath before nodding. The next second he felt Harry start to push his lube covered cock towards his entrance. The tip of his cock prying its way inside. It wasn’t easy due to the size, but after a few slow tries, he finally entered. Both gasped loudly, feeling each other link together. Draco felt a sharp pain from being breached for the first time, but somehow it felt less painful when he saw the look of pleasure wash over Harry’s face.
Draco took another deep breath and felt himself relax enough for Harry to slip a finger inside of him.
As the next week passed by, Draco was starting to come to terms with what he was feeling. He had given up trying to run from it all and decided to at least accept it even a tiny bit. Still, he had no intentions of voicing these feelings in the near future. It was far too risky, and this whole situation of liking a guy was too new for him.
“If you do that, I’ll tell her you were in on it! You’d have to spend detention with me for a long time then, and you know I can make it feel like hell.” Draco warned Potter. He could only hope it was enough to make Potter change his mind. Because Potter didn’t know about the real scenario that would unfold. Most likely Malfoy would be expelled from school and would have to deal with the Ministry again. He knew they were only waiting for an opportunity where he managed to mess up enough so that they could reconsider sending him to Azkaban. The Malfoy name had earned itself much hatred throughout the war after all, and he knew that there were quite a few who felt opposed to the fact that he avoided an Azkaban sentence.
He felt the grip on his head loosened at the same time as Potter looked away for a second before once again regarding him with a restrained composed look in his eyes. “Hermione is the smartest person I know and has the best resources to figure this all out. So yes, I’m calling her.” Potter’s voice was levelled, and Draco felt his jaw clench at the notion that Potter was showing mercy despite it all.
“Malfoy!” Granger looked flabbergasted at the sudden visitor.
“You would actually
Harry chuckled once more, “I’ll make sure not to.”
“It’s not… Well, maybe it is, but it isn’t what you think…” Draco was stumbling over his words at this point, which he hadn’t had the experience of doing before. Was the situation really making him this flustered?
“What I’m saying is that I’ll consider your feelings seriously, and I’ll get back to you once I’ve figured out my own feelings.”
His whole life had been built upon the basis of not showing any weakness. This included not showing feelings or allowing yourself to rely on anyone else other than yourself. During the war, his mother had begged him to rely on her, that she would find a way for them to run away from it all. But he had been too afraid to disobey his father, and deep down he knew he wouldn’t be able to run anywhere that was out of reach from the dark lord.
“Pansy!” Draco felt his voice rise, simultaneously with the heat rising to his face.
“No, there were moments where it was just… dreams I guess.” Draco’s voice came out softer than he had intended. He quickly cleared his throat.
“If you don’t turn that page soon, I’m gonna get seriously worried.” Draco jerked his head up and was met with Blaise’s scrutinizing eyes.
“Great! I was wondering if you’d like to hang at my place and watch a movie? I’ve had this one I’ve wanted to see for a while now”
“Well, seems like to me… You’re gonna be miserable either way, so why not bet on the small chance that he’d actually fall for you?” Pansy was already eyeing another pastry as she talked. She knew Draco in and out, and she had been a bit surprised seeing him fret this much over a guy she didn’t know.
“Always the optimist, aren’t you?” Draco felt a hint of relief at the certainty in Potter’s words. Somehow, he understood why so many people had decided to follow Potter during the war.
They had also continued working on the Patronus spell diligently every time Potter stopped by, and despite Draco being unable to get used to the closeness Potter was creating between the two during the lessons, he was starting to show signs of mastering the Patronus. Just a couple days ago, he had seen blue sparks shoot from his wand, and could almost not believe it.
Draco groaned, still not wanting to leave the room until he was safely back in his body again.
Once he opened his eyes again, he realised he had been grasping at his arm where the mark was. He withdrew his hand and sighed. The nightmares hadn’t decreased at all. Every night he woke up in a cold sweat screaming or shaking violently.
“Well, those ‘few left’” Draco said, avoiding Potter’s eyes. “are fairly set on getting rid of the…traitors.” As Draco gave a quick look at the two, he realised their eyes were not meeting his. He followed their gaze, only to realise he had been clutching his left arm right where the dark mark was hidden underneath his robes. He quickly let go and cleared his throat, getting their attention once again.
(See the end of the chapter for
They all agreed to go bed as the day had been tiring with all the festivities.
“I love you too” Draco said before giving Harry a deep and lasting kiss.
Potter just shrugged slightly before settling back on the pillow, Draco could swear he saw a flash of pity in his eyes, but he was not about to start anything big right now. It was late and he was tired. Arguing with Potter could wait.
