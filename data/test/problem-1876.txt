Harry learned that he liked that, liked the way Malfoy kissed Harry in all manner of moods, liked the way he looked a bit dazed with it afterward, liked it all, all of it, every bit.
"No, it isn't," he said. "I'm not you, Malfoy. My happy thoughts don't come from others' humiliation. I think about Ron and Hermione, mostly. Their faces. The Weasleys at Christmas. S—" But he stopped. No, he didn't think about Sirius. Not to bring happiness. Not anymore.
Having Professor Lupin at Hogwarts was, for Harry, an enormous comfort. Sometimes Harry felt like only Lupin knew how he felt about Sirius, and though they rarely talked about Sirius, it helped. Harry visited him sometimes—he went with Ron and Hermione or by himself, often to press him for information or to talk about the DA, but just as often to have tea and complain about Snape. He was even getting used to calling his professor Remus when not in class.
It was only the shock of Ron remembering the Arithmancy professor's name that halted Hermione's panic.
Stranger still, however, was the way Malfoy reappeared moments later, his pale face emerging from the cheering students packed in all around Harry. For the barest instant, they looked at one another, and Malfoy seemed to have composed himself; all rancor had disappeared. If anything, he looked resigned.
'Besides, who are you to talk?' put in Malfoy, the most unlikely ally, as he prodded Pansy in the side. When Harry looked confused, Malfoy smirked. 'Pansy used to have it bad for Macmillan.'
“Not very many people have been around,” Hermione explained, looking sadly at the empty common room. “Ginny and Dean are somewhere, Dean’s still—really upset—I know all the third years are sad about Dennis, they keep bursting into tears all over the place.” She looked both anxious for their sakes and annoyed. “Poor Ginny, both Dean and Colin need her, and she’s hardly had a moment to herself.”
'And what exactly was supposed to convey that?' Malfoy said tightly. 'I must have missed those owls you sent—oh, or those times at school when you made it clear that you, what did you say, wouldn't turn me away—yes, I must have been blind, not to see that you might not
That's also the day Zacharias Smith shows up on their doorstep, his hand bandaged in several places.  'Tell your bloody owl to stop pecking at me, Potter,' he snarls.  'She nearly bit off my finger!  What the hell do you want?  Don't you people understand the idea of a holiday?'
Malfoy, who is in the middle of separating the beef from the noodles ('I loathe food all mashed together,' Harry remembers him once complaining), looks up in surprise.  Still, after a moment, he puts down his fork and heads for the door.
“Excuse me, I was just going,” Draco said tightly, unable to ignore him in such close proximity. His voice was as cold as it had ever been and, before Harry could even begin to answer, Draco turned away from him.
“YOU’RE SHAGGING MALFOY?” Ron shouted, leaping to his feet and causing everyone in the common room to swivel their heads in surprise to stare at Harry.
Ron snorts.  'Oh, that's rich.  He could be planning our deaths, and you want to throw him a birthday party?'
, there will be no more fighting in this house.  How many times have I told you that magic is a privilege?  Yes, even for you, Malfoy, I don't care how many centuries old your family tree is!  Honestly, you're all acting like a couple of first years, and if we were at Hogwarts, I'd give you all detention.'
'Great, neither do I,' Harry snapped, shifting his bag into a better position on his shoulder. He was about to step out into the corridor again when he realized that he
Okay, and it was, it was more than okay, Harry working his fingers inside him for what seemed like hours until his whole hand was sore and Malfoy’s hips jerked and he said, ‘please, Potter,’ and Harry said ‘please
He thought of Malfoy the way he had looked through Voldemort's mind, pale and trembling. And Malfoy, clutching at the sink with white fingers, his ugly sobs echoing off the tile. Harry had not known the extent of the damage he could do that day, either. It was like Hermione's parents, he thought; all they had known of magic were the tricks Hermione could do, Levitation Charms, turning pincushions into hedgehogs. They had not known that she could wipe every memory they had of her, that with magic people could control others' minds, could torture, could kill.
'Maybe Harry's going to hex him senseless in front of us,' Seamus says gleefully, looking as if Christmas has come early.  'Oy, Harry!  What's Malfoy doing here?'
Harry frowned down at the toast on his plate, only half-remembering putting it there. He jolted awake some nights from dreams of another Horcrux, or with the idea that he was lost somewhere in the forest, the war still going on. From the way Ron often woke by sitting bolt upright and looking around, and the way Hermione's wand leapt to her hand at any loud noise or sudden movement, Harry knew he wasn't alone.
Harry shrugs.  'He's going to be helping us.  So we're letting him stay.  Remember what I told you about Dumbledore?'
'We were using each other,' Malfoy gritted. 'Everyone else I don't care about, so it doesn't matter.'
"Do you miss Ron?" he asks out of the blue, and again does not expect the wince that flashes in her eyes. Living people are so sensitive.
'I try to forget,' Malfoy said with a grimace. He studied Harry with his pale gray gaze, so like Sirius's. Finally he said, 'I suppose you're an exception.'
Harry thought of Malfoy's pale, drawn face as he emerged from talking to Phineas. He looked down. 'Remus said something to me once,' Harry said. 'It was after he died—'
They spent the class period working on a three-part restorative draught, which was neither overly challenging or overly interesting, at least in its beginning stages. Even without the aid of the Prince's book—he still couldn't think of it as Snape's—Harry managed an adequate flask, and tidied up his workstation feeling pleased.
'They've got tobacco in them,' Harry said. 'I don't know, you roll them up and light one end on fire.'
“That’s what I said,” Harry snapped. “When? Tuesday? I can’t on Monday, I promised Lisa I’d work with her—"
“Right,” Ron said, “because I’ll bet you’re going to tell me Lucius Malfoy’s the newest Order of the Phoenix member, is that right?”
'Now tell me about young Malfoy,' Doge said, in his high-pitched wheeze. 'It's a pleasure to see you again, my dear boy! We met so briefly at that wedding, and you in disguise the whole time!'
On the table beside Harry's bed lay a thick stack of newspapers, a good two thirds of which contained an article on him. Atop these was
'But she does, obviously,' said Ron; it was beginning to make Harry uncomfortable, how Ron was quite suddenly the sensible one of them. 'She wanted you to say that you wouldn't let her go, that the two of you would work it out, that she was too important to just let her run off like that. But you did, Harry, you acted like it was nothing to you, what kind of message does that send?'
“I HAVEN’T SPOKEN TO MY FATHER SINCE JUNE,” Draco yelled, “AND I’M NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO TALK TO MY MOTHER NOW, ALL RIGHT? NOW I HAVEN’T GOT ANYONE, POTTER, I’M ALONE, ARE YOU HAPPY?”
“It’s the principle,” Draco seethed. “Nott’s a traitor now—he’s never been much of a Slytherin, but now that he’s friends with Dumbledore’s favorite, now that he goes around with Harry Potter—"
Harry was sure he'd seen a yellow and black scarf on at least one of the small figures, but he held his tongue.
“I think he ought to know,” Hermione said, a bit louder. “Maybe you can tell him at the Hallowe’en Feast. We thought we’d come down to check on your pumpkins. They’re looking lovely.”
It made for quite the interesting month, as Ginny was nothing if not keen on flaunting her mother's decrees. This resulted in a lot of kissing in closets and beside beds instead of in them, and once Ginny exasperatedly joked that she might as well Polyjuice into Hermione just to get him alone. At one point they'd been ensconced in a broom cupboard with his hands up her shirt, when Mrs. Weasley had given up calling their names and begun opening doors at random. Harry Apparated downstairs and Ginny made up an excuse about looking for Crookshanks, though not much could explain how short of breath she was. It was about as far as they had got, and from what it looked like, they weren't about to get any further.
Malfoy's sheets smelled like him, and Harry found a thin blonde hair on the pillowcase; he had a second to brush it off the bed before Malfoy settled on top of him, heavier than expected for how skinny he was. Malfoy's elbow jabbed straight into Harry's shoulder and he had to suppress a groan of pain.
Draco looked about to speak, but Harry went on, “And I know you saved my life more than once, which I guess means I owe you, and I don’t take that lightly. I know you like Lupin—you can deny it, but you respect him, don’t you? Even if he is a werewolf. And I know you kissed me. So no,
'I wouldn't mind some chocolate,' Malfoy says loudly, but Mrs. Weasley doesn't even spare him a glance.  He's still shivering.  His hair is wet, slicked down around his forehead, which gives him the appearance of a drowned rat.  Despite his haughty sneer, he looks, in Harry's opinion, quite pathetic.  After a moment, Harry takes pity on him and pushes his mug across the table.
“Here now, what’s this?” he said, puzzled, with the amiable confusion only a man who is still half asleep could muster for an unknown, panting boy clutching a polished stick. “Who’re you?”
'Pansy, Tracey and Astoria Greengrass,' Malfoy slurred sleepily. 'Do you have insomnia? Is this some post-traumatic sort of thing? Because I can tell you right now—'
“Mrs. Weasley would have a fit if she saw the house now,” Harry was saying to Remus when he heard what sounded like a shriek from the other room. Frowning, he looked up, but Remus only shook his head.
'Wait,' Harry said, laughing. 'Where are you always running off to these days? I know it's N.E.W.T. year, but this seems more like SPEW. Don't tell me you're starting a support group for lonely Slytherins or something.'
“Oh,” Ron said, after it took him a minute to get it, “is it—" he lowered his voice, “You-Know-Who?”
At first, he had thought Malfoy had only gone off somewhere without telling him, as he was wont to do, the Owlery or to drop in on Penelope, but he didn't appear in a single class that day, and when Harry asked Pansy, she only shook her head and hurried away. He was about to go ask in the hospital wing when Hermione came flying through the portrait hole, her hair a tangle. She looked as if she'd run all the way there.
Hermione sighs.  'For one thing, because he knows too much.  And for another thing, because even Malfoy doesn't deserve that, not if he's telling the truth and Voldemort's after him.'
,” and then it was Mrs. Weasley standing above Harry, light streaming in to illuminate the dust-heavy air, and it was morning.
'I'm fine,' Malfoy bit out, and any thought Harry had held about getting a thank you died a swift death. 'Well, Potter? You can go now.'
“Wilkes was the older brother, he inherited it all. When he died, it would have gone to his heir, but he was only a year old at the time. So it went to Benjamin for safekeeping. If Wilkes’s—the dead one—if his heir dies, it’s Benjamin’s for good."
As Harry headed for the door, a hand caught at his elbow and he almost ducked away, in an attempt to avoid Slughorn, but the hand tightened, and it turned out to only be Malfoy, who slipped through the crowds after Harry and out the door.
'Why Malfoy? Why not—' Harry found he could not think of any other Slytherins aside from Goyle and Pansy Parkinson, neither of whom seemed more appealing choices. Finally, he ventured, 'That Zabini bloke. What about him?'
She looks distracted when she glances up at him, hair falling into her face.  'Well, you are—sort of in charge—aren't you?  I thought you should know what was going on.'
One blustery day in March, he managed to escape Hermione's detailed revision plans and made his way to meet with Professor McGonagall, who was supervising the seventh year Gryffindor career counseling sessions.
'What, with you?' Harry demanded in a harsh whisper, never one to let things lie. 'Because what do you know about it, Malfoy? Who've
!” Remus snapped. “That will be quite enough.” He turned to Dumbledore, who was listening calmly, eyes on the parchment. “Albus? Perhaps we might alter the record slightly—to cover Draco’s more, ahem, personal admissions—and, unless you have any questions?“
'We'll trade off matches, of course,' Demelza said briskly; she reminded Harry a bit of Hermione. 'We're a bit late in the season for starting, but if we follow the regular year's schedule of games, we should have no problem. So let's see, Harry and Draco, you can start off, then Owen and Draco, then me and Harry, then me and Owen, then Owen and Harry, then me and Draco. How's that sound? Since it's almost November, we'll play the first game this weekend, and go on from there.'
Harry nodded, though he felt decidedly disconcerted. It was not natural to have enjoyed a Potions lesson. It had been pleasant. He had made it through the entire lesson without being yelled at, insulted, threatened, or having his potion evaporated, which was unheard of when Snape had been in charge of class.
'Good point,' Harry says.  'Besides, he doesn't seem to care much about defense, he isn't very good, is he?'
Harry still gripped his wand, feeling a surge of helpless hatred rush through him. He had come up with dozens of explanations for Tonks in the past week, in an almost desperate attempt to excuse what had happened, but here, with her before him, he only felt betrayed. “I don’t care,” he hissed. “I don’t want to hear it.”
'Tough luck, mate,' was all Ron said, in fact, when Harry was paired with Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson for a Potions project the next day. Ron himself was working with Hermione and Padma Patil, and could not keep the pleased grin off his face.
“Hey,” Ron said, from the other side of him, suddenly, “Harry, hey, isn’t that Tonks up there? What’s she doing here?”
Ginny hesitated, and then she blurted out, 'Do you want to go for a walk? We haven't talked in a while—'
'What do you mean, where've I been? I'm in your classes, Potter, I eat meals at the same time you do every day. I haven't gone anywhere.'
It might’ve been that he’d spent a full twenty-some hours alone at Malfoy Manor before arriving, or perhaps it was finally being away from Hogwarts, where Peeves might swoop through the wall with a cackle at any moment, but Malfoy wasted no time crawling into Harry’s bed. Possibly the Hogwarts bit, Harry mused as he bit at Malfoy’s jaw, because snogging in the Room of Requirement was one sort of secret, but here, Harry could feel the content, undisturbed thrum of the House of Black’s wards at the back of his mind, and knew Kreacher had been at Andromeda’s all evening. They were well and truly alone.
In Transfiguration, they began discussing invisibility; Penelope, wearing wire spectacles and looking determined to follow in McGonagall's footsteps as best she could, set them at work copying notes about the difference between Invisibility and Vanishing spells. Potions was equally demanding. By the time they arrived in the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom that afternoon, Harry's schoolbag felt as if it had been hit with a charm to turn all his books to bricks. At his side, Ron was lamenting at length on their decision to return to Hogwarts.
Harry was breathing harder and Malfoy actually looked scared. 'It's not just a word,' he hissed. 'It's part of something bigger, Malfoy, god, you're not fourteen years old any more, don't you know that? What happened under Voldemort, the Muggle-born Registration Committee, the persecution of them last year!' He thought about Mrs. Cattermole and realized he was trembling. 'Tearing—whole families apart—'
'No,' Harry says with renewed energy.  'No, he'd hide it somewhere only I knew to look.  Come on, Hermione.  Didn't you say you needed to get some things from Hogwarts?  For the headquarters?  I'm going with you to get those books.'
“Potter,” Draco interrupted him from the bottom of the stairs, his voice barely short of a whine, “the tap in the toilet just
“What?” said Dean, but couldn’t protest further, as he found himself with an armful of annoyed cat. Crookshanks scrambled to escape and left one long red welt on his arm. It oozed a couple drops of blood just as Crookshanks leapt across the compartment and curled up by the window, sulking.
'Wretched mode of transportation,' Malfoy mutters, though his voice is pitched soft, and Harry realizes he has never heard Malfoy speak this quietly.  'We ought to be allowed to get there any way we like.  Father would have found a better means of travel, that's certain.'
The train's last whistle sounded, and Ginny said in the following silence, 'Oh, this is stupid.' She gave Harry an impish smile, stood up, and plopped down on his lap.
'Still looks like a weasel hole,' Malfoy mutters, and Harry pokes him hard in the side.  Mrs. Weasley, hurrying over to great them, gives them both a curious look when Malfoy yelps.
“Well, I certainly hope so,” Hermione sniffed. “I shouldn’t think any professor at Hogwarts should be seen at such a place.”
Draco shrugged, wandering towards the fireplace to inspect an antique clock that stood forbiddingly on the mantel. “Only once. I don’t remember it very well, I was only three or four. My great-aunt fed me sweets. I remember a lot of dark rooms.”
And Ginny, arms folded across her chest and her head tilted in curiosity, said so casually that Harry thought for a moment she’d been possessed by Luna Lovegood: “Do you fancy him?”
“If you say so,” Ron replied, not sounding convinced, but luckily, he jumped into Ginny’s and Neville’s conversation upon overhearing mention of Fred and George’s joke shop, and Harry was saved from protesting further. He hoped Hermione wouldn’t start in on him next, but she was going over her returned Transfiguration essay with a small frown on her face, unaware of anything else.
“It’s like you’re channeling Hermione,” Harry muttered, and gave him a warning glare before Draco could even open his mouth. “All right, then, we’ll go.” He followed Draco from the room, straightening his robes.
He had thought more than he liked to admit about what had happened in that classroom, and the way Malfoy had stood in a hurry and strode out the door. For several enjoyable minutes, Harry had wondered if perhaps Malfoy was deformed, or humiliatingly small, and that was why he had been insistent that Harry could not return the favor. After all, Harry knew blokes who wanked together; Seamus's sessions were practically a nightly ritual, and once Harry had come across the Weasley twins masturbating in their bedroom, lying on their separate beds. George—or had it been Fred?—had actually winked and invited Harry to join them, then laughed when Harry stumbled from the room in a hurry.
“I’ve got to get to the DA meeting,” Harry told her pointedly. “’Bye, Cho.” He scarcely heard her mutter a goodbye in return as he pushed open the door.
'Excuse me,' Malfoy interrupts.  'You are talking about my father.  I am standing right in front of you.'
Pansy gave a self-deprecating laugh. 'No one else asked me and I wanted to go,' she shrugged. 'Besides, I couldn't let him look the fool, going alone, either. Come on, are you coming into the party or what?'
Harry had scarcely sat down at the kitchen table before the first owl swooped in, its talons clutching an acid green card that landed in Harry's lap and exploded into a fizzle of orange sparks that spelled out HAPPY BIRTHDAY! The display was so explosive that the owl took off at once, its feathers singed, and the card's envelope flew clear across the room to hit Ron in the chest.
They rushed around the corner, then, and drew up short, Hermione grasping his wrist in surprise. Outside the usual classroom, students were milling, and the classroom door was shut. Anthony caught sight of them and waved.
'That's nice,' said Harry, whose mind was already racing ahead. 'Hang on, will you? I'll be right back.'
Malfoy looked disgusted. 'I'm not your replacement Weasley, Potter. We have an arrangement, that's all.'
'How's the game?' Mr. Weasley asked cheerily when he came stomping in the door after work, Percy half a step behind him. He had gray hair at his temples, now, fine lines of stress around his mouth.
He left Remus sitting there with his lukewarm tea and his sad eyes, and Remus let him, which made Harry even angrier. He felt furious and desperate all at once, with nowhere to go, and he was even contemplating going back to Remus just so he could shout that he didn’t care one bit about Draco Malfoy, when he ran smack into Dumbledore.
Tonks chuckled. “Oh, there was a match! Heard the shouting from my carriage. I thought so. Shame I missed it.”
And he missed him, despite the fury that still flared when he thought of the things Draco had said to him, how Harry had trusted him. He missed the particular way Draco had of talking, the snide way he had of laughing. He missed kissing him. He missed practicing Defense with him and seeing the particular light of triumph in Draco’s eyes when he managed to hex Harry.
For a cold moment, Harry realized that in all that had happened, he’d forgotten about Draco’s mother. Challenge momentarily forgotten, he asked, “Your mother?”
expression. 'I'm only saying, take care what you eat and drink, double-check your post, things like that.'
Harry had to chuckle along with Ron. It served him right, after all; when it came down to it, Malfoy was nothing but talk. “Come on, Ron, let’s get back to it.”
'It's only twenty years,' Harry said before he could help himself. The dark robes made Malfoy look small, and Harry had the absurd and fleeting impulse to comfort him.
'You can't blame the girl, of course,' Malfoy carried on loudly, ignoring Harry's demands and Pince's angry looks. 'There she was, thinking you were finally returning her lifelong affections, and then you dropped her without a thought.'
“But who will teach Defense?” Hermione asked, at the same time Ron groaned, “Please don’t let it be Snape.”
'They are nowhere near my bed!' Harry said hotly, though as he said it, he could not help but imagine Ginny, splayed on Dean's lap over Harry's pillows, red hair spilling everywhere. He could not tell if the sharp ache in his stomach was anger or jealousy or—
It was cold but there was little breeze, and they huddled beneath a tree by the lake. The water was a murky gray, the surface shivering, and Ginny put her head against his shoulder. 'I like winter,' she said, smiling up at him. She was wearing mittens undoubtedly knitted by Mrs. Weasley, and her cheeks were pink with cold.
'Snape told me to come to you,' Malfoy blurts.  He looks flushed and desperate from struggling against Harry's spell, but he leans back as far as he can when Harry whirls on him.
She gave him an exasperated, if fond smile. 'I think I ought to go find Ron and Kingsley,' she said. 'If anyone can convince the Minister of Magic to break the rules, it's me. I'll see you back at Hogwarts, all right?'
Harry scowled. While he saw the sense in Hermione's argument, he agreed with Ron; he had liked the state of Slytherin before.
He went to Slytherin the next day. Astoria Greengrass pulled open the door with her wand drawn; she prodded him in the chest with it, demanding, 'What's your business here?'
“That’s certainly true,” Hermione said, frowning. “But who will lead us? Dumbledore? You know that some people will go into an outcry against him, call him a tyrant, say he’s trying to take over the whole magical world.”
“You can’t control your temper, yes, I’ve heard,” Lisa said dryly. “Do give it a try; I’d rather not fail Potions because of you, thanks. Now, be quiet, I need to take notes.”
A silver light bloomed from the end of Malfoy’s wand, much stronger than before; it looked vaguely like a dragon, perhaps, but Harry couldn't be sure. Even so, it was a great deal better than his previous attempt, and Harry found himself grinning for Malfoy’s sake.
'Shh,' Hermione admonished. She crept forward several more steps, then said a small 'Aha!' to herself, and pushed open a door to their right. Harry heard a loud whirring sound, undercut by a strange
'Well, I'd like a career in magical law,' Hermione said, then glanced at them, as if she expected them to be surprised. When neither was, she carried on. 'Someone ought to be fighting the system we have, it's outdated and oppressive, all these ridiculous laws that hinder unity instead of promote it! But first I think I'd like to work in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Charlie picked me up an application last week, and Professor McGonagall promised to serve as a reference.'
'If—' Harry starts, then pauses.  'Fine.  All right.  Good night, Malfoy.'  When no response comes, Harry sits there, not quite sure what to do with himself.  Eventually, he yanks out a blanket and tosses it in Malfoy's direction.  Malfoy tugs it over himself without looking back at Harry.
"Oh, I know you’re underage,” Harry said conversationally, “but in these times, Fudge is taking every precaution, haven’t you been reading the Prophet?”
“Got ter be some o’ his followers around,” said Hagrid. “Bu’ he isn’ goin’ ter jus’ attack Diagon Alley, yeh see, he’s got ter assemble his forces, so ter speak—"
He was dizzy with the suddenness of it; it seemed that one moment he’d been sitting in an armchair talking about her dad and the next, her fingers were wrapping around his cock, her breath coming swift and hot in his ear. “I, wait, wait,” he managed, and the next thing he knew, she had climbed off him completely. He felt even more foolish this way, still hard, his trousers left open and his breathing harsh.
'I don't care,' Malfoy said, his voice that cold and distant drawl Harry only fully remembered now. 'Get away from me, Potter, I don't care how awful it was for you, it doesn't matter!'
When they reach the back of the Burrow, Ron is sprawled on the grass, waving his arms at the sky; Malfoy is leaning against the side of the house, looking green and not quite able to stand on his own, mumbling to himself.  'Harry,' Ron exclaims, trying to sit up and failing.  He flops back to the ground.  'My best mate, Harry!  Come down here!  Come sit in the—in the grass!  Beautiful grass.  The beautiful Burrow grass.'
'Don't be ridiculous,' Hermione sniffs.  'I only think that if we're trying to make friends with him, we ought to at least stop calling him by his surname—'
'Oh,' Hermione says.  'Of course.  Well, if that's all—wait!  What did you say?  George!  Why haven't you put the Ears into wider circulation as spying devices?  What if we could turn them into something smaller, some way to eavesdrop on conversations further away?  Muggles have video recordings and hidden microphones, I'm sure we could—'
“Consider it done,” Harry said. “Come on. Let’s go in Quality Quidditch Supplies. I’m not visiting Diagon and not going.”
"What, that you kissed Chang? That you started your silly little DA right under Umbridge's nose? That you were once a short little boy in a robe shop? The whole world knows about you. I know about you."
He was late to breakfast. Malfoy glanced up when he walked in and didn’t stop looking until Harry stumbled into his seat.
'It can't be any worse than your dinners, I'm sure,' Hermione says mildly.  In his seat, Harry quickly turns his snicker into a cough as Ron sends him a glare.  Once, Ron had made a meal of tea and hard-boiled eggs, the only two things he was certain would turn out right.  In fact, Ron made so many eggs that they were eating the remnants for three days.  Even now, Hermione turns a bit green at the mention.
But in the months since June, there has been no question of whom Harry despises more.  'He has to let me break his wand,' he snaps.  'And he'll be watched all the time.  If he does anything funny, I'll kill him myself.'
'In Gringotts, like everyone else,' Zacharias says, scowling down at his unopened Butterbeer and reluctantly twisting off the cap.  'Listen, I didn't come here to be interrogated, Granger, and I certainly don't—'
'Be careful!' Mrs. Weasley shouted after them, giving Harry one last squeeze around the shoulders. 'Ginny, owl us straightaway when you get to Hogwarts!'
'It's still a lot of chocolate,' Harry said, his mouth twitching. Chocolate was easier to discuss than Dementors, or trials, or escapes from prison. 'Don't you feel sick or something? From eating all of it?'
For an instant, Harry felt the familiar thread of annoyance at Malfoy's inability to say anything outright. Then he touched the scrap of parchment in his pocket beside the Chocolate Frog card and his irritation faded. He followed Malfoy toward the doors.
immediately called to mind Lucius Malfoy’s escape, and if the conversation they’d just had was any indication, Malfoy would waste no time in leaping to his father’s defense. Nor would Malfoy think twice about insulting Sirius. It was just the way things were. He’d come to expect it; he couldn’t expect anything else from Malfoy, who lived to taunt him about these things.
This is what it would be like in a perfect world, Harry thinks one day, when Draco is off eavesdropping on the Head of the Department of Magical Catastrophes and his pretty young secretary. This is what I used to dream of, back then, tied down by the war and the sides we were forced to take. This is how it would have been, if Draco and I would have had the chance to be ourselves, and not two people the world hung upon. No pressures. No other loyalties. No
'Well, yes, I suppose,' Hermione said. 'They were, well, angry at first, but obviously they were glad that I was alive and that I'd come and found them.'
'Yeah, we'd be better off without his kind!' another boy piped up. It was plain that they had all recognized Harry, and yet he spoke up anyway.
Draco's eyes snapped with rage. "Did you know that Muggle-born wizards dilute the bloodline of Purebloods, Potter? Did you know that over forty percent of children from mixed descent are weaker than those of pureblood descent? Did you know that only four fifths of children from those mixed families are born with magic on average? They are slowly killing our magic! Did you know that, Potter? Of course you didn't. You only know what Granger tells you, and why would she tell you shameful statistics like that?"
Ron’s grin burst into full bloom. “Maybe I’ll get to hex Malfoy,” he said, sunning in the very thought of it. “See how
As the feast wound down, McGonagall directed the students to their respective houses, and the hall once again filled with students running every which way, Prefects yelling after them. For a brief second, it reminded Harry of the last battle, and he had to look away for a moment, the flames of the thousands of bobbing candles blurring in his vision.
The dream changed. Harry was no longer lounging in the grass of the Burrow, but standing in a dark, drafty room of stone, his hands clenching the back of a chair. “Soon we will strike,” he hissed, and his voice was high and cold. “Where are Jugson and Rookwood, are they in place?”
'Stop trying to redeem me, Potter!' Malfoy hissed. 'If you make me out to be good enough, you can reconcile talking to me, is that it? Tell yourself it's all right? Well, I did what I had to, and I would have done more, and I'm not ashamed of it. My family and I are alive, aren't we? So if I had to do it over, I'd take the outcome I know!'
that you were at Malfoy Manor fetching him back to Hogwarts, and I shouldn't have to always be running around wondering where you are, and I shouldn't have to feel like the fourth wheel when you and Ron and Hermione are all chattering on about things you've never told me. And you shouldn't have to, to remember to
“The Three Broomsticks,” Harry said, flushing without knowing why. Everything that had happened with Tonks seemed so far away, as if it had happened a year ago, or more. “I suppose I’ll see you later—I mean, you can come too, that is—"
from a Potions apprenticeship in Estonia, they had their own row, and Harry said in a betrayed voice he barely recognized, ‘And what about me, then?’
'Yeah,' says Harry, only vaguely surprised.  'We're going to use The Hog's Head again, did he tell you that?'
Malfoy straightened his robes, still looking shaken. “Potter just attacked me,” he said shrilly, regaining composure as he spoke. “He insulted my father and came at me with his wand—"
'You know, the little one,' Malfoy shrugged. 'Red hair, freckles, the one you snogged all over school in sixth year. Ring a bell?'
'Isn't it?'  She looks up at him, and her eyes are so clear and hopeful that Harry feels himself literally cringing.  'It's just, you're around them all the time, and I only see you every few weeks.  It's so unfair!  How come Draco Malfoy gets to spend more time with you than I do?'
“This isn’t a game, Ron! I cast it on Bellatrix, but it didn’t work very well. She said I really had to mean it. Well, if I would have known how to cast it, maybe she wouldn’t be loose now! Maybe she wouldn’t kill anybody like Sirius or hurt anyone’s parents anymore. Maybe Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t have got free in Wales. Maybe Voldemort wouldn’t be so strong.”
'Harry Potter is a great wizard!' Dobby cries.  'Harry Potter is a noble, good wizard and Kreacher will not call him foul names or Dobby will—'
'They aren't even talking right now,' Harry said; Charlie was deep in conversation with Luna, who had live butterflies alight in her hair. 'And I'm sure Hermione would rather be with her boyfriend than talking about Protean Charms with Flitwick. Go on, go rescue her.'
'I'll suck it for you,' Harry said in his ear and Malfoy outright groaned, at which point Harry remembered his hypothesis on Malfoy's deformed dick and fervently regretted the offer he had just made, as well as his overall penchant for reckless behavior. At least, Harry thought, from the way Malfoy was grinding up against his thigh, he certainly had something down there, and it didn't feel abnormally small, either. He was pleased until a second later he recalled that he might want the exact opposite, if Malfoy were going to stick it in Harry's mouth.
Malfoy looked furious. “My father is not a coward,” he bit out, enunciating each word. “He’s twenty times the wizard your father ever was.”
“Yeah, I try,” Harry said sarcastically, then quieted. They were strangely close, here; it would be so easy for him to step forward and brush his hand against Draco’s jaw, to press him against the wall and put his mouth on Draco’s. And he wanted to—he had always wanted to. But it was more complicated than that, wasn’t it? Or he would have stayed on Draco’s bed, wrapped his arms around him, and continued kissing him all afternoon.
His tone was more clipped and polite than Harry had ever heard it, and he shut the door so quickly that Harry had to dart inside.
The whole thing was quite chaotic. It was overwhelming for Harry, who had limited experience with the real wizarding world, even if he was starting his sixth year at Hogwarts. On the walls, posters for other bands glowed neon and moved wildly, gesturing to guests and dancing up a storm, which gave the strange impression of being surrounded by glowing, gyrating shapes. There was a band playing on a stage, though Harry couldn’t see them very well; all he could make out was the drummer, who seemed to be using enchanted drumsticks, which fizzed out colorful sparks every time he used them. From the way the crowd was reacting, they seemed to be quite popular.
'You don't mean that,' Harry said, horrified. He had been appalled that Hermione had considered Zacharias Smith in sixth year, but surely . . .
“Ngh,” Harry said, some sound of acknowledgement, while inwardly his mind was racing in circles. Eight o’ clock? That was nearly two hours away, and his palms were already sweaty. He’d never felt this way around Cho, not even when she’d kissed him in the Room of Requirement. Something about Tonks made him feel as if all the nerve endings in his body were about to be rewired.
After dinner, they all listened to carols on the wireless and sat by the fire, everyone's heads slowly drooping. Even Mrs. Weasley looked content, Harry thought, sitting beside Bill and talking at length about baby clothes.
“And he used to wear his mum’s cross for luck on every exam,” Ron remembered. “And that time he told Neville he wanted to be a Healer at St. Mungo’s, and Neville just glowed, only Seamus never knew why?”
'Oh,' Malfoy said. 'Yeah, Malcolm Baddock used to do that, until Snape gave him permanent detention for setting his bed hangings on fire by accident. You can't open any windows in Slytherin, see, they're all under water.'
For the first time, Harry did not mind feeling left out just after Ron and Hermione made up. It was actually a positive situation, as far as Harry could tell, as the two of them were wrapped up in one another, so much so that neither noticed just how many suspicious looks Ginny was sending him from across the common room, or how distracted Harry was.
“That’s fine,” Hermione said, speaking for all of them, and Tonks gave them all a familiar grin before disappearing into the next room. Harry watched Ron, Hermione, and Ginny all settle down on Tonks’s couch—the couch he’d sat on the night before, with Tonks close beside him—and swallowed uneasily. After a strange look from Hermione, he sat down in the armchair.
Harry barely managed out a “’Night, Ron,” before an enormous yawn overtook him. Any attempt at clearing his mind before sleep turned swiftly
“So they’re all in Wales?” Harry frowned. “But there have been reports of Muggles being killed even in London, haven’t there?”
'Potter,' Kingsley's deep voice boomed out. 'You have proven that insufficient evidence was provided, and the Ministry has granted Mr. Malfoy a re-trial. Ministry authorities will contact Mr. Malfoy soon.'
“One can never be too cautious,” Dumbledore assured him. “But if you are asking me whether dreams can be entirely trustworthy, they cannot. You must continue with your Occlumency, Harry. It is not simply about keeping him from your mind, it concerns whether or not he can ascertain if you are telling him a lie. Someday your life, and the life of your friends, may depend on your abilities.”
'Oh, why should you?' Ron demanded. 'That git threw books at you! If she wants Malfoy back at Hogwarts so badly, she ought to go herself.'
By the time Harry stepped back from the door, Draco had sat down once again in the chair by the window, his arms folded in impatience. His expression was cold and closed off. Harry thought he looked strangely small, sitting there, haughty and alone.
At long last, he finds the promised packet of crisps, along with a small stash of Chocolate Frogs, which he promptly dumps in front of Harry.  Happy for an excuse to ignore the stoat sandwiches, Harry seizes one.  He unwraps the frog and is halfway through eating it when he looks at the card.  It's Dumbledore, staring up at him with his long white beard, a small smile on his face.
“That’s not the worst of it,” Hermione continued, casting a quick glance over her shoulder and then looking back to him. “Lucius Malfoy led the attack. Aurors were about to re-capture him when Bellatrix killed four. She and Malfoy both escaped.”
It was late Wednesday evening when Harry trudged through the portrait hole, too tired to even smile as the Fat Lady let him through. It had been an awful few days, between Ron ignoring him and his final fight with Draco, and every time he thought of it, he was torn between fury at himself and the guilt that Ron had, perhaps, been right. All of this reflected on his abilities at Occlumency with Dumbledore, who had given him a handful of lemon drops, smiled down his nose at Harry, and finally just dismissed him.
Harry ignored him and pulled him closer. “I don’t think so,” he said, fingers curling around the thin bones in Draco’s wrist. He felt almost fragile. Harry said, half-smiling, “I thought you chose me, Malfoy.”
'And that's what matters,' Malfoy said, 'that it turned out all right?' His head was bowed; he didn't even look up. 'No, you know what, Potter, I'm not doing this. Get out of my house. I'm finished with Hogwarts and I'm finished with you.'
'Yeah,' Harry says, 'and he's got no use for friends who won't take orders from him, his only friends are the ones stupid enough to worship him . . .'
.” She saw Zacharias Smith giving her a look akin to skeptical disgust, and she said cheerfully, “Got to start somewhere, don’t we?”
“You can talk to him tomorrow, of course,” Mr. Weasley said, his voice sounding very far away. Harry nodded, a mechanical motion; he could not look at Hermione, whose concerned look was all too familiar, or Ginny, who was looking down at the table studiously, or Ron, whose expression of glee was swiftly morphing towards bewilderment. It was too late, however, for Mrs. Weasley, who immediately swooped down on him.
'Can so,' Malfoy mutters.  'That is not, that is not true.  You, Harry Potter, are a liar.  Oh, you smell nice.'
,' snaps Hermione, whom both of them seem to have forgot about.  The curse sends them both crashing to the floor, frozen as if they've been Petrified.  Malfoy has still got sticky cream in his hair and is glaring up at Hermione, who is standing over them with her hands on her hips.
If the moment didn’t end, Harry thought he might die. He felt unnervingly close to Malfoy. He wanted to touch his knee with his. Touch the thin, pale angles of his wrists. He wanted—
'Oh yeah, forgot about that,' Harry says.  He concentrates, and a minute later, Malfoy is thrown back against the nearest upright chair, several large ropes having wound themselves around him.  Harry can't help showing a small grin of triumph when Malfoy struggles and cannot move.  'Nonverbal magic,' Harry says casually.  'Someone wasn't paying attention last year, it seems.  Too busy working for Voldemort, were you?'
'You'll what?' Malfoy says, glancing over his shoulder at Ron, who glares at him.  'Wait, Potter, why are you going to Azkaban tomorrow?'
In the other room, Teddy began to bawl and Narcissa looked startled. 'A baby? I thought Nymphadora was your only child.'
'Ron,' Harry said urgently. 'You can't think she—likes him? She's in love with you. He's your brother. She's just trying to be nice—'
'Harry Potter,' he says, looking at his wand instead of Harry.  'Well, well.  I knew you'd turn up sooner or later.  It seems to me, the last time I saw you, you insisted rather rudely that you were—'
“Draco,” Remus said, sternly, before Harry could even open his mouth, “while you are in this house, you will respect Sirius Black, and that is final, or you will leave immediately. I don’t want to hear a single word against him.”
Ron chooses that exact moment to wake up, and he struggles to a full sitting position before mumbling, 'Whazgonon?  What about You-Know-Who?'
'You can't make me live with them,' Malfoy hisses.  'I won't, I won't do it, I'll go to the Dark Lord instead—'
'You know who the Secret Keeper is?' Harry echoes, slightly doubtful, at the same time Ron demands, 'Well, who is it then?'
The corner of Tonks’s mouth twitched a little, and she said, with a regretful look in her eyes, “Me too, Harry.”
” Malfoy said, scrambling to his feet. “Now piss off, Potter. We don’t need the likes of you lurking around here.”
'Bit hard to look out for them when there aren't any,' Ron said with a grin. Harry had to stifle a smile.
'If you're talking about me, Weasley,' Malfoy says just then, stepping inside, 'you'll have to take your little fantasies elsewhere, as I'm in perfect health.'
Hermione pursed her lips. 'Maybe Doge let Lucius go because he saw you at the trial, and you didn't make a move to condemn him?'
'Both of you, shut up,' Hermione's voice floated over from the next bed. 'If I don't get any sleep because of you arguing all night, I'm going to be very cross in the morning. Harry, you know what I'm like when I don't get my sleep.'
As if in mutual agreement to avoid that direction of conversation, both looked away. Malfoy said scornfully, after a moment, “You just want to spy on my flying, anyway, Potter. Because you know I’ll be leading Slytherin to a resounding win this weekend, naturally.”
Crumpling the ruined letter in his fist, Draco tossed it angrily at the wall. "Whatever, Potter. Now you know the truth. About my mother too, and how she’s abandoning me for the stupid holidays."
“Where’s Hermione?” Lisa asked, as Draco coldly shook the Ravenclaw captain’s hand on the pitch and both teams turned to mount their brooms. “Isn’t she coming?”
to be such rubbish at Potions that you can’t even scrape by with an A. Do you need my help or not? Because I’d rather not waste—"
'Full of advice when you don't want it, nothing when you do,' Ron muttered to Harry as Hermione strode off toward the doors. 'Come on, I left my Charms book in the common room, I've got to walk back. Anyway, if you ask me, Lucius Malfoy deserves a one-way ticket to Azkaban. If you go and tell the truth, they'll see that.'
He was taken aback as she turned on him. 'Um,' he said. 'I think you're acting a bit strange, Hermione, to tell you the truth. Why are you acting so jumpy?'
“The booksellers!” Hermione nearly shouted. Across the library, a group of frantically studying seventh years gave her a scathing look, but she didn’t seem to notice. “Oh, Ron, that’s brilliant!”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, very quickly, “I didn’t know anything about the attack, all right? I haven’t heard from my father since June. And then you said something, and I thought you knew about him, and I didn’t know anything.”
This resolution lasted approximately fourteen hours, at which point he ran into Malfoy near the Charms corridor.
"That's it, Malfoy," Harry shot back and surprised himself with the vehemence that had stirred at Malfoy’s words. He was sitting bolt upright now, hands balled into fists in the cushions. "That's just it. Your dad's coming back, isn't he? He’s out there somewhere and he’s coming back for you any day now, is that right? Then don't talk to me about missing somebody! Don't you think I miss Sirius? Don't you think I miss my mum and dad? Your dad is coming back, is he? WELL, THEY AREN'T!"
On impulse, he went to her and kissed her on the cheek, and her bushy hair got in his mouth. 'See you soon,' he whispered, and while it wasn't so dangerous, he didn't think, while there was little chance anything could happen, he still added, 'Keep safe, and Ron too.'
Harry frowned and stopped by the door. “Nothing. We just had an argument, it’s stupid. Stuff about Dr—Malfoy.”
''Arry!' Fleur exclaims before anyone else can move, swooping down on his chair and giving him a kiss on each cheek.  'What a pleasant surprise zees ees!  I 'ad not been told you were coming!  'Arry, zees ees my seester, Gabrielle!'
, he couldn’t escape. Turning, he expected the routine pity and anxiety that had colored everyone’s faces since they returned from the Department of Mysteries. However, what he found was Ron beaming up at him, eyes sharp with excitement.
,' she said, at which Charlie outright grinned, 'but while I happen to agree that you don't need a N.E.W.T. to stand up to the Dark Arts, you can't be saying that N.E.W.T.s aren't important . . . ?'
“What’s going on?” Harry sat down, looking curiously at Hermione. She was flipping through a thin manual on Apparation that she had received shortly before her birthday, but glanced up when Harry spoke.
Harry ran into Ginny that night after dinner, headed out of the Gryffindor common room just as he was headed in. She was wearing a brown Weasley jumper with a G embroidered in the middle, and her hair shone in the firelight.
“Potter,” Draco said, shakily, and then Harry slid his hands under Draco’s shoulders and up to tangle in his hair and kissed him again before he could say anything more.
Harry had scarcely dared to hope it was Lupin when Ron came barging through the door, panting. “Harry,” he exclaimed, pausing for breath, “would you believe it? Herm’s staying in the Prefects Car so she can talk about her bloody OWLs with Goldstein! Says she met him when we were at that sodding club. I didn’t see her with anybody, did you?”
Harry had to admit that, actually, he did like partnering with Lisa in Potions. She was more impatient than Hermione and more inclined to stamp on his foot whenever he opened his mouth to speak, but she’d probably saved him from detention more than once. Besides, he’d come to appreciate her ever-present sarcasm. “Yeah, but what does that have to do with anything?”
'You've seen dead people?' Malfoy exclaimed, with a surprising amount of hysteria for someone who had grown up in a world well-acquainted with ghosts.
Just then, Ron rolled over noisily, and Harry froze, one sleeve still on. The last thing he wanted to do was to talk about his evening, even to a half-asleep Ron who would probably be thinking more about the dream he’d just had. But Ron gave a strangled snoring sound and flopped over again, and after a moment, Harry, relieved, pulled off his robe entirely and dropped it on the chair. He just—didn’t want to think about it right then. Or ever, maybe. He was supposed to face Tonks in class. He was supposed to hand in homework to her, and practice Defense with her, and work with her on the DA. And she’d—
Tonks grinned at him wickedly. “As my good friend Mundungus Fletcher might say, ‘Nothing’s a crime unless you get caught.’”
“I’ve seen her wrists, though,” Hermione offered. “She rolled up her sleeves the other day, when we were making those potions for heat compresses. She doesn’t have a Dark Mark.”
“No, I heard from Padma that he hasn’t got any money left,” Hermione informed them both. “She said she heard the Slytherins weren’t so inclined to treat him like royalty now that his dad’s name’s sullied. Apparently, he’s borrowed Nott’s robes for a few Sickles. Did you notice at breakfast how they seemed too long on him?”
'It's the best you'll get,' Harry says.  'Take it or leave it, Malfoy.  You're the one who doesn't have a choice.  You're the one who came to me.'
'Yes, you've always set such a shining example,' Malfoy said sweetly. 'Going to the teachers for everything. Besides, I've told Slughorn, and by now I've given him twice his weight in crystallized pineapple, he's keeping a watch. Of course, no one can be everywhere.' Malfoy made a vague gesture towards his leg.
'Hermione knows best,' Harry says with utter faith.  'We could need those books later.  There are still two Horcruxes left to find, and we haven't destroyed the others.'
When Harry arrived back at Hogwarts, the moon was high over the trees and the castle silent. Everywhere was still as he trudged up to Gryffindor, through when he stepped through the portrait hole, he found Ron and Hermione awake and still bickering.
Madam Pomfrey was in a near-frantic state when Harry and Hermione peeked their heads in the door, and she motioned them quickly into the room. “He’s in the bed by the window,” she said briskly, arms full of several glass bottles and a roll of bandages. “Don’t be long, now, it’s getting late,” and she bustled off to tend to a still-unconscious seventh year with a bad burn mark on her face.
Harry was relieved for an interruption, but when Mr. Weasley wasn’t forthcoming about further details and Mrs. Weasley was still bustling around the kitchen, he found he had nothing else to say. “How have you been, Harry?” she prompted again, handing him a tall glass of pumpkin juice. To Harry, every word she spoke was a word she didn’t, which all came down to
scrawled lazily on the parchment. He looked at Malfoy across the room, whose head was bent in affected concentration. But Harry would bet he knew Harry was looking.
Malfoy glowered. 'We don't need your help. I don't know what kind of idea got in your head last night, Potter, but whatever it is, I prefer you as far away from me as possible, and as far away from Slytherin.'
It seemed for a moment as if Hermione wasn’t going to answer, she was so silent. Then, tears springing to her eyes, she said, very quietly, “Dennis Creevey, Seamus Finnegan, and Professor Snape.”
Harry stared at him for a long moment, and he had to repress a smirk. He couldn't stop himself. Here was Malfoy, so angry that his veins popped and his fists clenched, and it was all Harry could do to keep from laughing.
'Kingsley can't intervene with the Wizengamot,' Hermione was arguing loudly. 'He said so, I said so, isn't that enough?'
Ten minutes in, to everyone's shock, Lucius Malfoy pleaded guilty to every charge without looking up once, and ten minutes later it was over. A collective outcry went up when the sentence was declared—twenty years in Azkaban—and the witch next to Harry actually uttered a stream of curses he would have expected only from Ron. In the hubbub, she seized him by the wrist.
In his surprise, Harry nearly topples around the corner.  When he recovers himself, Mrs. Black's eyes are already shut.  Malfoy sticks his hands in his pockets.  'Excellent,' he says to the portrait.  'You have a pleasant day.'  He starts to turn towards the kitchen, and Harry draws back.
'You can't just say it in here?' Hermione begins, but at the look on Harry's face, desists.  As Harry leaves, he sees her point her wand at Malfoy's plate and mutter some sort of spell; the casserole at once splits into its separate ingredients.  Amused, he recognizes the spell as the same one she uses for blended potions.
'What I'm saying,' Charlie shrugged, 'is that you don't need an O in Defense Against the Dark Arts to fight them. Harry Potter hasn't even taken his N.E.W.T.s yet, and he defeated You-Know-Who with a first year spell. I know many of you fought in the Battle of Hogwarts last year, too, without a N.E.W.T. to your name.'
'I'm sorry,' Harry says, instantly realizing how Hermione and Ron must have spent the past few hours.  'I hadn't thought what it would look like, I just had to go.'
“Close,” Ginny answered, before Hermione could. “He gave her the password to Ravenclaw and told her she could use their library whenever she wanted. How’s that for romantic?” After a moment, she added, “Well, I mean, I wouldn’t want a library from Dean, but he certainly knows what Hermione likes, which is what counts.”
'Yes, imagine getting a package like that from Perce,' Charlie said from over Ron's shoulder, making Ron jump. 'No letter of explanation either, just a bundle of porn from my stodgy little brother. Hey, I thought I'd come down and reminisce a bit too, can I sit?'
, just as Terry Boot cursed him from the other side, and he was left as rigid as a mummy, covered in boils. Harry couldn’t help covering a laugh.
“I actually—I’d kind of like to get away, too,” Harry lied, glancing behind him towards the stairs. “It’s kind of creepy here, you know. Sirius’s empty house.”
“Nott?” Harry exclaimed, a mix between horrified and curious. The news that Draco had kissed another boy made his heart begin pounding double time. “But isn’t he with Padma Patil?”
Hermione pressed her lips together. “I was only going to say,” she murmured, “that I think it’s really good of you to work with him, Harry. That’s all. That is what you’re doing, isn’t it?”
The only brooms in the shed are the school brooms, full of dust and most with snapped twigs; they look as if they haven't been cared for in months, and Harry runs into several spider webs as he extricates the best two.
“What kind do you think?” Harry said, exasperated. “What kind of thoughts do you have about Anthony? I mean, it’s just a, a thing, I don’t really—it’s nothing to worry about.”
Harry almost feels guilty as Malfoy snatches back his letter, crumpling it protectively in his fist.  But it's Malfoy.  He scowls.  'Is there some kind of hidden message you're sending her?' Harry demands.  'Are you spying through Pansy?  Is there a code?'
'Excuse me, you've already got the world singing your praises,' Malfoy sniffed. 'Can't get enough, can you, Potter? I always knew you were a fame addict. You always want more.'
“I didn’t want to. I wouldn’t want to. But I would.” He looked at Draco, standing several steps from him, as if they were too painful to make. He said, tightly, “So what is it, Malfoy, me or your father?”
circumstances for your lesson. Surely the next time you face the Dark Lord, you can invite him to a more appropriate setting.”
The three of them exchanged glances, recalling their less-than-friendly parting with Griphook. Hermione opened her mouth, and Harry knew she was about to ask if he had talked to Neville about the Sword of Gryffindor in her absence. Luckily, at that moment a steaming platter soared toward the table, Kreacher trotting behind it with another tray, this one bearing tea.
Harry turned back to the sink on the pretense of refilling his glass, something catching in his throat. There it was again,
Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, Remus’s footfall sounded on the stairs below them, and Harry was forced to say quickly, “Good night, Draco,” before hurrying off to his own room. He wanted to reach out to touch him, to grasp his wrist, before they separated, but there was no time, and he went to his room feeling strangely dejected.
A moment later, the office was empty, and the only sign anything had been amiss was a pile of notecards on the floor.
In fact, he could hear Ron’s voice for himself. “That’s brilliant!” Ron would say, grinning widely. “What was it like? What was
'It's not my hair.  It's some ugly brown straw that Granger charmed on my head.  My hair doesn't tickle.'
Life went on, unbelievably. Everyone and everything sank back into disagreements and incantations, self-darning socks and new owls, old girlfriends.
“So will we,” Ron interrupted eagerly, “he’s been up to no good since we met him, him and his Slytherin friends! They’re always after Harry.”
'First of all,' Dumbledore says, as if Harry has not spoken, 'remember what I told you about keeping your knowledge of the Horcruxes quiet.  It would not do for a member of your DA to be captured and spill all your secrets to Voldemort at the first drop of Veritaserum.'
'Sure,' she says vaguely.  'I ought to tell Romilda Vane, I think.  Before she found out Hogwarts was cancelled, she was training every day on a broom.  Somehow, she got it into her head that you only like people who've played Seeker.'
'Er, no,' Harry mutters.  At his side, Malfoy is snickering, and he elbows him.  'Sorry, I have to talk to Katie, we'll catch up later, all right?'  He waits for them to leave before prodding Malfoy forward.  'Go on, then.'
“Tonks,” Hermione told him patiently, “is the new Dark Arts professor. Aren’t you relieved? After Umbridge, I was so worried! But Dumbledore knows what he’s doing. Now we won’t have to have the DA in secret and the Ministry won’t be issuing all these horrible edicts and we’ll . . .” She continued on, heedless of the fact that he had half-turned to look at the Slytherin table. From there, his eyes slipped to the table of professors and, sure enough, Tonks was perched on her chair, attempting to look interested in whatever Professor Flitwick was saying. Her hair was a shocking shade of pink and hung straight down from beneath her hat, curling a little behind her ears.
Malfoy gave a shaky laugh. 'I suppose I'm lucky that you were in the right places at the right times.'
Meanwhile, Pansy began acknowledging him every time she saw him, perhaps out of guilt or in some odd kind of mockery; it always sounded derisive, the way she sneered out his surname, usually as she plowed past him with Daphne Greengrass following in her wake.
Nearly half an hour later, Harry was gazing at the most expensive broomstick care kit they had when Malfoy and Pansy reappeared, Pansy's eyes unmistakably red-rimmed. Before he could say a thing, she seized him by the arm and dragged him behind a large display of Wimbourne Wasp figurines.
He wants to feel real, the way he does at this moment, as if he is not living in a world of paint and unsatisfying afterlife, as if he is not just one-dimensional and the creation of someone else, as if he is not made only of imitation and that even his love is a painted farce. He wants to feel as if he is living, and that he has a choice, and that he is not trapped within a picture frame the way he has been all of his life—both lives.
'Who're you forcing these on, then?' Ron asks, passing through.  'Kreacher?  Or are you going to send them off to Hogwarts for some poor, unsuspecting elf to find?'
'I don't—' Harry said blankly, and then Malfoy was on his hands and knees between Harry's legs and it hurt for a second, when Malfoy leaned hard on Harry's legs, and then his mouth was descending on Harry's cock, which twitched so badly Harry was not sure how he kept from coming right then and there.
Malfoy sneered at him. “I said now, Potter, are you deaf? What’s the matter, have you got to meet Weasley in Zonko’s to snigger like first years over some pathetic jokes? Or do you just wander around looking for people to give money to?”
Harry had gotten out of bed early to see Ron and Ginny off; Hermione had left the night before, with Anthony, to spend Christmas at his home. She’d kissed him on the cheek, wished him luck, and told him she would send him an owl. Ron had looked pleased when she’d done the same to him, though when he opened the portrait hole to find Anthony Goldstein waiting outside, he’d looked decidedly less cheerful.
“Mostly mended,” Ron shrugged. “I’m supposed to stay overnight so she can keep an eye on me. I’m probably the best off, considering who’s here; did you see Kevin Entwhistle? Whole body covered in burns. I’ll bet he was hurt the worst.” There was a pause, until Ron realized what he said, and amended soberly, “I mean, except for Seamus and Dennis and Snape.”
Harry wanted to clock him and had to clench his fists around the sleeves of his robes to keep himself from doing just that. 'Are you blind? What about Teddy? And you—' He paused. 'You know me.'
There was a pause and then Malfoy appeared on the other side, only half his face visible, one suspicious gray eye. 'What do you want?' he demanded.
'I just don't know what to do,' Harry said. 'We're going back to Hogwarts, and it'll just be—Charms and Quidditch and—'
'Sometimes you need to do it yourself,' Harry said. 'True. Hiding behind other people doesn't make you safe. It makes you a coward. But you also don't need to go it alone. That's not bravery either.'
Tonks snorted. “I’m the one who invited you, and you’re apologizing. Don’t be daft. What d’you want to drink? I’ll get you something, if you like—never been a fan of Ogden’s Old Firewhiskey, it’s got a bit of a bite, but I hear it’s a favorite—"
, Hermione?  You want to take a stroll around Grimmauld Place?  Maybe pop over to Diagon Alley and see Fred and George's new jokes?  We've got to find out—about the Horcruxes—'
“She threatened them with hexes until they gave it up,” Hermione said, as if Ron hadn’t spoken. “But the best part was, it’s some silly book about household spells. I’ll bet your mum has it, Ron.
“Oh, enough already,” Mrs. Weasley cut him off. “It’s this silly motorbike business again, which is quite ridiculous, as Harry won’t be riding it any time soon, and you, Ronald Weasley, will certainly never go near it, do you hear me now?” At Ginny’s laugh, quickly turned into a cough, she looked up sharply. “Nor will you, Ginevra, if you’d like to ever set foot in a Weasley house again!”
'Oh, it's you,' Malfoy said, as if they had just run into one another in the Prefects' bath. 'Well, come on, then.'
Doge inclined his head, perhaps not quite the stupid man Harry had thought him once. 'Be that as it may, we are in a time of peace. Surely we should put the past behind us, Harry? Put it away?'
The Hogwarts Express was hissing steam and all over the platform, families were calling out good-byes and last minute advice, but somehow everything seemed too quiet. After their frantic arrival and the bustle of boarding, not to mention a summer of hurried encounters, it was strange to be sitting across from Ginny in an empty compartment, and from the way she was fidgeting, Ginny seemed to find it strange too.
is not even needed; it swings open easily, and as he slips inside, he hears the sad, familiar tinkle of a bell over the door.  Fortescue, he remembers, used to give him free ice creams all the time.
'But Hermione said Dumbledore gave it to you,' Neville frowned. War hero he might have been, but his belief in Hermione Granger's ability to be right was absolute. 'It was in his will, she
Harry, who had read enough about residual effects from Memory-Altering Charms, looked at Hermione's sad smile with her charmed-straight teeth and mouthed, 'I'm sorry.' She gave him a one-shouldered shrug and got up to help her mother with the dishes.
Harry absently took a handful of them as he listened to Luna chatter. She was now talking about Freshwater Plimpies, or was it a vacation she had taken with her mother to seek them out? He felt so tired all of the sudden, like swimming in water with all his clothes on. And he had the sneaking suspicion that what he thought was peppermint was actually mashed potato.
“Why would I want help from a madman?” Malfoy sneered, trying in vain to retrieve lost dignity. “What is this, Potter, your idea of charity?”
“Then leave,” Draco finally sneered. “Or do I have to hex you out of here? I have nothing more to say to you, Potter. Good night."
Elladora was looking at Malfoy as if he were everything she wanted to be. Harry was suddenly very worried for Slytherin.
Katie glances from Malfoy to Harry and back, then says, 'Harry was always better than you, you little ferret,' then claps Harry on the shoulder and turns away.
“And here I was just thinking of all the possibilities,” Malfoy said impishly. “You’re ruining all my fun, Potter.”
Malfoy sneered. 'It's not complicated, Potter. She wanted you to fight for her, and you sat back and let her waltz away like she could be replaced with a snap of your fingers.'
“Want something to drink?” Tonks asked him, returning to her place on the couch, setting down the book that was spread on the seat. “Haven’t got much, but—"
The walk from Hogsmeade is a silent affair; Hermione leads the way, muttering to herself as she re-reads her list of books, followed by Ron, then Malfoy, and Harry at the back.  It's cool, but still autumn; the last leaves are lingering on the trees, rustling in the wind.  When they reach the heavy oak doors to the Entrance Hall, Hermione looks uncertainly at the rest of them.  'I told Professor McGonagall we were coming,' she says.  'She should be expecting us, she already told Madam Pince I could have as many books as I like.  Let's go, we've a lot of work to do—'
'Yeah, I bet you could make a better meal, too,' Harry says absently, stroking at her feathers.  'I don't eat mice, though.  You could try Crookshanks.  Or Malfoy.  I don't reckon he'd say no to any sort of food, right now . . .'
Harry glanced at Malfoy while he fixed his message to his owl. There was a quiet about Malfoy he hadn’t noticed before, as if something had been drained from him. Still, after his dream the night before, the very sight of Malfoy was disconcerting, and he tried to put those thoughts from his mind. It was easier now—Malfoy wasn’t naked and glittering in the moonlight, after all, and mostly just looked peaked and small.
All of the sudden, Harry's bite of pumpkin pasty was not going down so easily. 'Yeah,' he managed after a minute. 'Yeah, I, yeah.'
'How come I never saw these magazines?' Ron demanded as everyone around them burst out laughing. 'If they're such a family hand-me-down—'
'You would have found me on the train,' Harry continues, his teeth chattering, as if he hasn't heard a word Malfoy said.  'To make some stupid little dig at me or my friends.  You always did.'
Draco stared at him. Finally, in a voice tight with disdain, he said, “I don’t take charity, Potter. Haven’t you learned anything?”
‘Do you ever wish,’ Harry says once to Hermione, when she’s sleeping in their guest room after a fight with Ron, and Ginny’s off to Europe with the Harpies for a series of exhibition games. ‘I mean. Do you ever think that if we had parents, things might have turned out differently?’
Harry thinks he hears Phineas snort, affronted, and after a moment's silence, his query of 'Phineas?' yields no answer.  He relaxes again, but words swim behind his eyes, and sleep is impossible.
'But you made that brilliant bag of yours,' Ron argued. 'And you saved my life after I splinched myself, and you got us out of Luna's house safely, and you helped Harry with finding the Horcruxes and the Hallows and fighting the Death Eaters, and, all of it! You even memory charmed your parents! That should count for something, shouldn't it?'
Harry was mid-dress when Ron came in, and he tried to put his dream—and all the events of the night before—out of his mind, in case any of it showed on his face. Something must have come through, because Ron looked at him curiously.
Sounding, if possible, even more skeptical, Draco said, “It’s some Muggle contraption, isn’t it, Potter? I don’t trust it. Is this what you wanted to show me? Because I’m certainly not impressed—"
'I don't know!' Malfoy repeats loudly, his face pinched with annoyance and what might be a trace of fear.  'I never knew where we were, he never told me, it's all a blur—'
'Don't you have anything better to do than stand around eating chocolates and gossiping like a girl?'
with Tonks. He couldn’t keep on like this. Not with Death Eaters loose. Not with Malfoy’s father, with all of them, rejoining Voldemort at any minute. Not with his life in danger and the only way out to kill, or be killed . . .
'Potter,' Malfoy snapped again. 'Did you come down here just to look at me or have you something to say?'
'How many more adjectives do you have up that sleeve of yours?' Malfoy spat. 'Surely I'm richer? At least my hair doesn't look like a bird's nest.'
,' Malfoy shouted. 'I saw you at the Manor, and at Hogwarts, and—fine. I get it, all right, Potter?'
Harry wanted to point out that he had no desire to speak to Tonks in front of anyone else, before he could warn her not to say a word about his birthday, but Hermione was already hurrying off. Luckily, the strap of Ron’s bag snapped halfway there and all his books tumbled to the ground, so they arrived just before the bell and had no time to wave at Tonks, much less speak to her. Harry hid his relief and glanced around the classroom, which was buzzing with whispers. For her part, Tonks was provoking as many rumors as she could. Her hair today was still fluorescent pink, and she had several silver bracelets clinking around her wrist. She looked younger than ever, and rather than sit at the teacher’s desk, she was perched atop it.
'Nice to know you'd return the favor,' Harry said, then sent a pale shape streaking off up the corridor. Across the room, Myrtle was floating, looking almost regretful that she had alerted them to Malfoy's presence; Harry knew she would be all too pleased to have a fellow ghost to share her toilet.
'You ought to come around and chat with me more often,' Mrs. Black says.  'The brightest conversation I've had in a year is Kreacher.  "Yes, Mistress!  Right away, Mistress!  Shall Kreacher polish Mistress's frame?  Kreacher hates those dirty Mudbloods, yes he does!"  It's enough to drive one mad.  And don't let that stupid girl push you around.  She's a filthy, dirty Muggle.  And she ought to do something with that hair.'
"It's not playing fair," Harry says, and sees Draco's Slytherin smirk in his mind before it curls on Draco's lips. "And you cheated
,' Malfoy says, but as Harry gestures for him to go ahead, he flushes.  'Well—I didn't go to all the lessons—I was—'
“Harry?” She looked slightly worried about his reaction to what she was about to say but, nonetheless, plunged onwards. “Do you have—feelings—for—for Malfoy?”
For the barest instant, emotion flashed in Draco’s eyes, and he looked as if he were about to speak. But before Draco had a chance to react, a loud knock sounded at the door. Harry yanked it open to find Remus looking wearily down at him.
'Yes, I think once he was sentenced,' Hermione said hastily. 'I wanted to tell you, believe me, I did—'
“How are you feeling, Ron?” Hermione asked, as she had taken to doing every few minutes. “Do you want me to get you anything?”
“It means,” said Tonks, and deliberately pushed him backwards towards the wall, “that I don’t want to talk about You-Know-Who. So maybe you shouldn’t be thinking about You-Know-Who right now.”
The remainder of the summer passed without further excitement, the greatest agitation being the flurry of Doxies that had re-colonized the curtains, and the heat wave slowly subsided into hints of autumn coming, crickets all night during their weekend at the Burrow, some night breezes propelling the windows shut. Hermione managed to ignore Ron for five days, during which she furiously knitted eleven hats, and then for no visible reason gave him a sudden embarrassed hug after he got his OWLs and began talking to him again.
“Yes, yes, Master,” Bellatrix murmured eagerly, “all is in place, everything is set up, I’ve arranged it all—"
'But Mum and Dad aren't the same as they were at Hogwarts,' Charlie said. 'They've, you know, changed together. Though they're just as bad as Bill sometimes, to hear Dad, he calls Mum "Mollywobbles," did you know? It's enough to put me off my supper.'
“Good night, Harry,” Hermione said after a minute, though she lingered, frown creasing the area between her eyes. “Well, and Harry, if you ever want to talk about anything, you know, if you think Sir—"
we’re even,’ he said afterwards, when blood was trickling down his face and Harry had scratches on his neck and the assurance of a black eye the next morning.
'I've had Kreacher make up Sirius's room,' she said when they were once again standing in the entranceway; it was still a gloomy hall, but it smelled less of mold and more like wood smoke and tea, two scents Harry was beginning to associate with home, even if it were a temporary one. 'I hope that's all right.'
It was like exploring again, his hand curled around Draco’s hip, sliding upwards around his side as Draco sighed in his mouth, palming across the tautness of his stomach and up against his ribs. A whole expanse of warm, silk-smooth skin, and his palm brushed across one of Draco’s bared nipples, which made him shiver and breathe heavily against Harry’s mouth. Harry found it incredibly addicting, and did it again.
Neville ran a hand through his hair. 'But the next time a Gryffindor in need puts on the Sorting Hat, won't it just disappear again?'
"Malfoy," Harry said breathlessly, shoving the other boy off him and scrambling off the bed, "what are you doing?"
'What are you smirking about?' Hermione snaps, which is even further like Mrs. Weasley, and Harry bites his lip to keep the smile off his face.  'Well, go on, where were you, and what was so important about it that you had to run off without telling us where you were going?  We were worried sick, we thought Voldemort—'
'Well, there's a surprise,' Malfoy drawled. He led Pansy towards one of the brightly colored umbrellas, all of which seemed to have Heating Charms on them, from the circles of melted snow beneath their shade. If Harry didn't know better, he would think that Pansy was crying.
It’s good with Ginny. She follows Quidditch even more religiously than Harry and they spend half their weekends cheering over matches on the WWN, followed by lazy Sunday lie-ins and dinners at the Burrow. Hermione and Ron are finally both single at the same time, arguing incessantly while the Weasleys all make whispered background bets on when they’ll reunite, and it’s a relief to have someone to complain about it with, to come home from pub nights rolling their eyes at each other as they peel off scarves and cloaks, recounting,
'We're here now,' Narcissa said with a delicate shrug of her shoulder. She glanced around the dark entranceway, running one slim finger across the paneling. 'You know, I always loved this house. We used to spend all the holidays here, remember?'
Harry hadn’t been paying much attention and said absently, “The Slytherins will probably have a good laugh about it.”
Malfoy was already in the Room of Requirement, looking uncomfortable, as if he expected Harry not to appear. When Harry peeked open the door, Malfoy jerked in surprise, then glared warily at him.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck thoughtfully. “I suppose it depends how today’s lesson goes.”
'Yes, after his first choice, some Beauxbatons twit, turned him down, and Padma informed him she was going with a Weasley.' Pansy looked thoughtful. 'At least I beat out Daphne, she was sixth on the list.'
These people had died, Harry remembered. Michael Corner too, and Fred, and more. He had thought about how the Weasleys felt, missing their son, but he had given no thought to any friends Fred might have had, besides George. What about Oliver Wood, or Angelina Johnson?
," says a voice, stern and motherly and familiar all at the same time, and both of them turn to the woman standing before the painting tapping her foot. Harry has never seen Hermione look so embarrassed. "I'm holding a meeting," she snaps, flustered, and sends them splashing away with a look. The businessmen seated around the table with her look equally flustered.
'Oh, don't play high and mighty, you would have sold us out the same way,' Malfoy hissed. 'If the Dark Lord had announced that he wouldn't kill anyone if you'd only hand over all the Slytherins, you would have been marching us out of those doors, and not a single student would have stood on our side!'
'It helps with the Dementors,' Malfoy shrugged. 'Right? That's what Lupin always said. I couldn't have done a Patronus otherwise, there were so many of them.'
Hermione leans back on Harry's bed, resting her head against the wall.  'Maybe we ought to quit for now,' she sighs.  'Just tonight.  We're all too frustrated to get anywhere, anyway.  We can get takeaway and—and play Gobstones.'
And Harry had not stopped, even when Dumbledore had begged . . . he had gone on tipping the potion down Dumbledore's throat, promising him relief with each new cup . . .
'Oh, and by the way,' Hermione murmured, 'speaking of listening, Harry, I'd look out if I were you. I heard Romilda Vane in the common room this morning, talking about your break-up with Ginny. I know you think it's ridiculous, but you're a war hero, you're famous, and now that you're single, you're quite the catch. There will be thousands of witches after you, and not all of them are, well, all that scrupulous.'
But before Harry could answer, Ginny and Natalie landed with thumps beside him, and Ginny immediately seized him. “Harry, are you all right? You scared us so badly—we thought you were going to die—do you still have the Snitch? Oh, Harry! We won, we won!”
Harry blinked, his train of thought momentarily derailed. 'What? But you were jealous—with Hermione—'
"Ron and Hermione!" Harry exclaimed eagerly, shouldering past Draco. The owl was gone, but Harry found an abundance of presents among Draco's sheets that suggested more than one trip. He sneaked a guilty glance at Draco. "Sorry if they woke you up."
“Now hold on just a moment,” Remus interrupted. Moody’s good eye glanced towards him, while the other spun wildly. Even Draco glanced up, surprised, though he still eyed Moody as if Moody were about to attack at any time. Remus appeared to notice this, as he said evenly, “You already scare the boy, Alastor. You’ll remember that your impersonator had quite the year at Hogwarts. And we’ve all had a long night.”
“Because of him,” Harry shrugged, his voice still emotionless, “but you were right, Ron. I don’t know what I was doing. It was stupid.”
‘I am!’ said Malfoy, as Harry’s hand found his chest. Under his palm, Harry could feel Malfoy’s heartbeat rabbiting away. ‘Now what, may I ask? Shall we share dormitory gossip? Quiz each other on our Charms homework?’
'That's the one,' Harry said, relieved. He didn't know a thing about Nott, but he was willing to bet his Firebolt that Nott would prove less trying than Malfoy.
Harry had an idea of what would happen if Ron came to Grimmauld Place and found Draco there. It wasn’t a pleasant image for any of them, Harry included.
Hermione gave him another searching look, and then she reached across the table and gave his hand a quick squeeze. “I trust you. And I do think it’s good that you’re helping him, Harry, I do. In these times, we need any allies that we can get.”
They embraced, one of them—probably Andromeda—giving a little sob. 'It's been so long, Cissy,' she said. 'I thought we'd never see one another again, and I didn't dare talk to you at the Battle of Hogwarts, everything was mixed up and I was so distracted, my daughter, you know—'
Harry was quiet for a moment, resting with his chin in his hands and his elbows propping him up, eyes watching Draco silently inspect his book.
Ron chuckled. 'They did, too, did you know? I was with them in the Owlery when the Howler came. Bloody awful. I don't think those owls came back for days.'
Before he could pull his arm from her grasp, she gasped up in his face, 'Kill him, do it, they won't arrest you, you'll be a hero, do it now—'
,' Malfoy repeated, now frowning outright. 'You still haven't answered my first question, anyway. What are you doing here? What are you playing at? Quidditch and—bothering me—'
Behind him, the door clicked open. Before Harry could even turn around, a too-familiar voice said, “Expecting someone, Potter?”
He had never told Ginny as much, but he supposed he was, he had to be, didn't he? To be with her, those long days in the sun, wasn't that love? It was not as if
“So, look,” Jack said, sounding about as confident as Neville in Potions class, “we’ve got to win today, got that? We’ve
By the time Harry stumbled into Gryffindor Tower, it was beyond curfew, and he had to tiptoe into their dormitory, already hearing Neville’s rattling snores rising from his bed. It was never quite safe to trip through their room without a light, but he managed to skirt around the large dark shape that was Neville’s latest plant and to slip over the various assortment of clothes that had been strewn about and left there, all without waking any of them up. As he passed Ron’s bed, he heard Ron mumble, “I only eat the blue ones, I already told you,” but it wasn’t unusual for Ron to talk in his sleep, and he shrugged out of his robes with a sigh.
“More—physical,” Harry said hoarsely, as if the words weren’t his own. Draco looked a mixture between terrified and defiant, and without thinking, Harry reached out a hand and settled it gently in the material of Draco’s shirt. It was slippery in his fingers, and he tugged it forward, a little. Draco stumbled forward with it.
'Yeah,' Malfoy said, still not sounding very enthused. He rolled out of bed and went to stand by the window, peering out into the depths of the lake. It was still sunny—afternoon, Harry guessed, though he didn't know.
about some things you do, you never even asked me what I thought of you coming back to Hogwarts! You don't include me as part of your life!'
Harry thought with some regret of the book he had left in the Room of Requirement, now lost forever to the Fiendfyre, its original owner just as beyond reach. 'I've been, um, distracted, Professor.'
'I wouldn't even feed that to you,' Harry says to Hedwig, who hoots and flutters over.  'All right, all right, here.'  She takes the pieces of toast he feeds to her and nibbles at his ear affectionately when she's done.
'Oh, stop,' Hermione says, blushing.  'I don't want to be a partner or an investor or any of those things.  But I think this could really help the war effort.  I thought I'd pass it on, because we're so busy researching, and I wouldn't know the first thing about inventing something like this—'
'He does what?' Harry said, and then the rest of the words registered and he exclaimed, 'You did what?'
Harry glared at him. 'Will you hear me out? I know it hasn't been easy for you, coming back, and we sort of just left you to it. I wanted you to have this in case you need to contact somebody. That's all.'
It's more like a comedy of errors than a Quidditch game; Malfoy glimpses the Snitch first and, when he makes to shoot towards it, his broom malfunctions and stops so suddenly that he nearly pitches forward off it.  The instant Harry sees that he hasn't fallen, he goes for the Snitch himself, but his broom curves to the left and by the time he circles back around, it's gone.  Malfoy is across the field already, where his broom appears to be moving sideways.  Harry can see Malfoy flailing his arms in fury and can't help laughing.
“Walk by it three times while thinking about the kind of room we’ll need,” Harry replied, equally scornful. “If that’s too complicated for you, just wait.”
'A man after my own heart,' Mrs. Black chuckles.  'Looking out for yourself.  That's what I like to hear.  Regulus, he was too much of a follower.  He got what was coming to him.'
“Oh, shut up, both of you,” Ginny said, without much rancor, intervening before Harry could snap the same. “If you’re just going to argue, we might as well not even talk. Besides, we should be thinking about the attack. I’ll bet Mum and Dad know something, Ron. If we were just at the headquarters, maybe we could overhear—"
Trying not to flush at the inadvertent innuendo, Harry shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “I didn’t—I wouldn’t,” he tried, and then, in a rush, “I thought maybe you’d want to study Potions with me.”
Ron and Hermione both looked at him suspiciously, and Harry was terrified for a moment that they had both guessed about what had really happened between him and Tonks. “Like I said, I have to find more ink,” Hermione said, after a moment, and Harry let out the breath he’d been holding. Ron added, “I promised Seamus we’d go to Zonko’s, but maybe later.”
And that was how they ended up just inside the smoky entrance of a tiny all-ages club in London, Harry straining to hear anything Ron was shouting over the music. Ginny suddenly caught sight of someone and waved wildly until they could all make out Dean Thomas threading his way towards them through the crowd, giving them a wide grin in the pulsing lights. “Hey, Harry,” he yelled, and took Ginny’s hand, bending down to kiss her briefly on the mouth.
With that, he began to rummage through his coat's many pockets, in the process pulling out four keys, a suspiciously lumpy package wrapped in brown paper, a collection of rock cakes that looked as if they'd been in there since Christmas, a chipped old teapot, and a handful of owl treats. After dumping several balls of twine and a dirty pamphlet titled
One evening, he was staring off into space as Hermione read out a list of Potions ingredients when he caught sight of Malfoy, leaning back in his chair at a table not so far away, a girl Harry thought might be Astoria Greengrass draped all over him. As Harry watched, she leaned down to whisper in his ear, and Malfoy glanced up at her with one of his slow smiles. He looked pleased and Harry wanted to throttle him.
'I know, I've been there,' said Harry, which shut Malfoy up at once. He shrugged off Malfoy's shuttered look; he hadn't invited Malfoy along just to argue with him, after all. 'Well, cheers.'
than flying on a broomstick, here with his fingers clutching the handles and the streets of London spread out below them. Harry could feel Draco’s hands fisted in his jumper, the press of his knuckles against Harry’s ribs, and there was a faint tickle of warm breath on the back of his neck. He swallowed.
The girls left them on the second landing and Harry practically dragged Ron inside and dumped him on his bed before collapsing exhaustedly on his own and kicking off his trainers. He scarcely had time to process the night before he lay down in his clothes—just for a minute, he’d get up in a minute—and the next thing he knew, he woke up stiff and exhausted. It was still early, by the clock, and he sat up to see what had woken him just as Mrs. Weasley threw open the door.
Making his way towards the door, Harry saw the man lean forward and say something low to Tonks. He frowned, worried for an instant, but then glimpsed Tonks’s wand in her pocket. What was he thinking? She was an Auror. She could take care of herself. And besides, they sounded as if they were old friends. Harry was turning paranoid, seeing spies in every stranger he saw.
Harry gave her an annoyed look. “Maybe you should pay attention to your own reading instead of mine,” he snapped.
Hermione appears at Harry's side, almost glowing.  'Zacharias!  Come inside!  Was your mother the daughter of Hepzibah or Hannah, or was it Henrietta Smith?'
“We were actually talking about whether or not Professor Kothari is a spy for the Death Eaters,” Hermione said calmly, and when Ron glared at her, she sighed, “Oh, Ron, she’s got just as much of a right to know as we do. Ginny, Malfoy’s mum told him that she’d heard good things about Professor Kothari. That’s all. It could mean she’s the spy, but then again, it could mean nothing. What do you think?”
Again, Draco hesitated, as if he were planning to answer sarcastically and then thought better of it. In the end, his eyes tore away from Harry's and he watched his hands as he spoke. "I'd never had many real friends. My mother wanted to keep her only son as 'her baby' as long as possible. Excuse me for wanting to make some. I don't see why you keep harping on it. Get it through your thick head, not everything is about you, Potter."
‘I think there’s a danger in dwelling too much on the what ifs,’ Hermione said carefully. ‘They bear the weight of all we wish our lives were, and all reality can do is hope it matches up.’
“Well, well, somebody was up late,” Lisa observed in Potions, taking one look at him and raising an eyebrow. “What are you carrying in those bags under your eyes, Harry?”
“It’s hardly your business,” Malfoy retorted savagely. He shoved his owl out the window, as if in an act of defiance.
“Potter,” Malfoy said again, faintly, almost a whine. This time his face was white with terror, and despite himself, Harry felt a surge of horror at his own actions. But before he could do anything, even step away—
'—and the other day,' Cho was saying, 'Frederick lent me his new bottle of Fleetwood's Premier Pole Polish, it's called Liquid Silk, and you wouldn't believe how smooth the glide is after that. Plus the grip is better, because it's designed to enhance the magic worked into the handle, which combines wood fiber technology with slow-release shine spells in the anti-jinx varnish—I might go into broom technologies when I'm too old for the league, they're really interesting—anyway, he lent me his polish and I accidentally swapped it with Harriet's shampoo—'
It had happened again. He had been Voldemort, felt his displeasure, his skepticism, his eagerness to attack. But attack where? Moreover, Harry was sure that Voldemort had noticed him this time, his mind chasing back after Harry’s as desperately as Umbridge’s hand had grabbed for Sirius in the fire the year before. The thought made Harry shiver, though the room was warm enough.
'Yeah, I can't seem to stop following you around,' Harry said sarcastically. 'What are you talking to him for? Are you—about Remus? And Teddy?'
Remus gave him a thin, amused smile. “Harry, I’d love to talk about Quidditch with you any time. But I do know what it feels like to be betrayed by someone you love. And how alone you must feel.”
'Did he?' Andromeda murmured. 'He never told me that.' She tucked her arm around his; he caught a flash of Bellatrix in her profile, and then she smiled. 'All right, let's go eat.'
“And I’d rather practice Defense with someone who isn’t afraid to hex me,” Harry shot back. “Are you in or not?”
'She would have been, if you'd have made an effort, instead of lining up behind Umbridge,' Harry snapped right back, temper flaring again. 'Malfoy, I want Slytherin House to stay part of Hogwarts, or I never would have come to you in the first place. But don't you dare blame everyone
'No, listen. It shows you your heart's desire,' Harry shrugged. 'I saw my parents. All I wanted to do was to go and look at them, you see? But it wasn't like really being with them, it wasn't doing me any good.'
to protect, Potter, no matter how ruthless I had to be, and they would do the same for me, they would!'
'I don't think that's quite it.  She was upset that Malfoy supposedly died.  She kept telling me that I had been supposed to save him, that he had told her that I would save him.'
," Malfoy hissed. "Don't try to tell me how I should feel about my father! He's my father, and I miss him. And no matter what you say, he will come back!"
'You were stealing,' Harry says, but his mind is already racing ahead of him.  Harry had seen Mundungus, months ago, in Hogsmeade . . . he had been carrying a suitcase stuffed full of things from the House of Black . . . and Harry remembers, suddenly, that in cleaning out the drawing room cabinets, there had been . . .
“Tonks!” Ginny exclaimed, looking relieved. “Tonks, what’s happening, what’s going on? Have you talked to Lupin? Our parents? Is there—"
“I reckon I could afford it,” he muttered, frowning, “I’ll just—maybe Fred and George could lend me—"
'That's that, then,' Ron said, a bit too cheerful to be believed. 'Here, Harry, have some pumpkin juice.'
When Harry pulled away, Malfoy was still staring at him, eyes sharp and dark and furious. Harry felt a little stirring of triumph and, for perhaps the first time that night, smiled.
They were standing only a foot apart, but it seemed as if the entire country of Wales was between them. Harry thought that, in a way, it was.
the table as well, but aside from a few dust particles jumping halfheartedly off the surface, it stayed as beer-sticky and dirty as it had ever been. Harry was not sure whether to attribute this to the Hog's Head and its inherent grime, or the fact that Malfoy was pants at cleaning charms.
” This last bit was accompanied by a scowl in Hermione’s direction, and Ron poked him warningly in the side.
"Oh." Draco gave him a skeptical look, as if he had known that all along. "Well, don't let it go to your head. Ha ha ha. Your head."
Harry noticed that Ron sat with his back to the Slytherin table that morning, and from the way he was sitting, he seemed to be trying to block Hermione's view of it as well.
"What’s the matter, Potter, is the voice of reason too much for you? There's a war because of the Dark Lord, you self-centered prat, so do something about it, if you care so much! Or you can sit up here and snivel about Colin Creepy’s brother and not do a thing! I’m tired of your self-pity, Potter, go owl someone who cares.”
'—mental?' Ron finished. 'Well, yeah, Harry, what kind of sane person would let Malfoy put his slimy hands down their trousers? But if you're happy,' he added doubtfully. 'Are you sure he isn't using weird potions on you?'
Jimmy blushed. 'Oh, well, that's only because I wanted to be on Demelza's. You know. I thought she might give me a chance then. Brilliant girl, isn't she?'
Harry swallowed and something in his throat stuck. 'It's different,' he said with difficulty. 'I don't mean it like, like whatever it takes is necessary. I don't think people are expendable, or that they're—that their lives don't matter!'
There was so much between them, so many arguments, so many differences; in the end, it was simply easier to hate him. And it seemed that was exactly what Draco wanted, too.
The morning of 2 May dawned clear and peaceful, birdsong everywhere. They all woke early despite it being a Sunday, pulling on their best robes and trooping down to the Great Hall in a hush. Ron, in his nerves, kept clicking the Deluminator, whisking the light from the torches and then sending them fleeing back, making everyone in the vicinity jump in surprise.
Malfoy did, and they sat in speculative silence for a moment. Harry took a large swig and then he said,
Harry grinned back: he hadn't seen Ginny since his birthday, and with all the guests, they hadn't been able to snatch a moment alone together. Even now, Mrs. Weasley was watching them, and the instant she realized they were staring at one another, she said loudly, 'Ginny, come over here and look at this!'
“No, I want to,” Harry insisted. “Ginny’s great. I meant to get her something. Come on, pick one out.”
“No, I don’t.” Harry looked at him evenly. “Malfoy, I don’t. I’m not daft, I know who you are. I know who your father is. I know what you’ve done. I know you hate Hermione and Ron, and I know you’d rather die than work for Dumbledore. So don’t call me stupid.”
Silence falls between them, more sudden than Harry expects; Malfoy is staring at him with an unreadable look, and only when he looks away does he say, 'To protect me.'
They were still for a moment, eyes locked, Harry rooted to the spot beside Draco, Draco kneeling awkwardly on the bed with no emotion in his eyes, impossible to read. Time seemed to stretch on, unmeasured, holding them in place. And then, utterly conflicted, Harry turned and bolted for his room.
“Is that why you were around me all the time?” Harry demanded, his voice coming out cruel. “Thought I’d save you, did you? Thought maybe I’d protect you?”
'Also, I'll hex him if he does anything to you,' Ron put in, perhaps a bit too eager. 'I don't know how to turn people into ferrets but I'll bet Hermione can figure it out!'
, and she unrolls the long letter happily.  'Oh, good,' she mutters to herself at one point, trailing a finger down the parchment.  'Yes, I always said that was a bad idea.'
'Yeah,' Harry said. But he did not know how to explain the ragged veil in the Department of Mysteries or the arcing fall Sirius had taken through it, nor the way his parents had circled him in that cold graveyard and again in the Forbidden Forest, whispering their love and encouragement.
“My downfall as a true Marauder, Sirius liked to say,” Remus smiled as he sat down across from Harry.
Harry thought of the hope that had flared at the sight of his Patronus when it appeared by the lake, and how he had believed, so desperately, that it had to be his father. He thought of the way he had stared at the Veil after Sirius fell through, sure Sirius would reappear at any moment, that if Harry just waited a moment longer, Sirius would be there.
“You all right, mate?” Ron said, splashing water on his face. He looked up from the sink, mouth dripping. “You look a little pale.”
Ginny gave him a withering stare. “I wasn’t saying either of them could be the spy, Ron. I was only listing new professors. But it could be a student, haven’t you thought of that? There are loads of kids You-Know-Who could get a hold of, I’ll bet.”
Harry dreamt of water. He was under the tree by the lake, watching the lights reflected on the surface, but the sky was a lake too, full of floating stars. The grass was soft against his neck and he was watching stars slip across the sky, tiny swimmers striking out for the horizon, but at the same time he felt a sense of urgency itching against his thoughts, some unsettled feeling in the pit of his stomach. When he heard a noise, he sat up suddenly, and realized why. Wading through the shallows was Malfoy, his pale reflection wavering before him like a reverse shadow.
Draco hardly protested when Harry’s mouth found the juncture of his neck and shoulder, then slid up to plant warm kisses along his neck until he mouthed the skin just behind Draco’s ear and felt Draco surge up against him. It was all instinctual now, Harry’s fingers yanking impatiently at the buttons on Draco’s pyjama top, his mouth coming back down on Draco’s, which opened eagerly for the kiss. They were rocking against each other, the friction unbearable, and Harry thought distractedly how smooth Draco’s skin was—
'I'm trying to move on,' said Ginny again, 'and I think you should too. For real, Harry, not whatever sick arrangement you've got going with Malfoy. I happen to think that Cho Chang is a girly little crybaby but if you want to date her—'
“Oh, really?” Harry raised an interested eyebrow. “Because it seems to me you’re around an awful lot. In fact, every time I turn around, you’re right there. Ron even thinks that you’re stalking me.”
There was something charged in the air, some tautness to the conversation, that he was afraid to snap. But then, especially when it came to Draco Malfoy, he'd never been known to step down. "You were watching," he challenged.
In the first week, Malfoy runs into a suit of armor—'I swear it moved!' he yelps, when Harry finds him trapped beneath it—has two windows slam without warning on his fingers, and gets into a wrestling match with a wardrobe that tries to shut him inside.  To make matters worse, Ron amuses himself by agitating the bats until they fly at Malfoy's head.  Once they chase him out of the bath, clutching several towels around him and screaming.  Harry and Ron laugh so hard they almost choke.
“Sometimes the truth has nothing to do with what someone wants,” Draco said tightly. “And I want nothing to do with you. We’re through, Potter.”
“Inter-House unity, Harry,” Hermione said, as if he hadn’t been listening to a word. “Now that Umbridge is out of the way, it’s really important to start working on it, don’t you think?”
'And now I'm saving it,' Harry says, rather unkindly.  'How easily Slytherins can be bought.'  When Malfoy starts to interrupt him, his face going red, Harry presses onward, 'I can't promise what Dumbledore promised, I don't have the same connections.  I'll try, Malfoy.  You have to come with me, though.  If nothing comes of it, I'll let you walk free.'
'Hermione says we've got to go,' Harry agreed. 'Besides, I want to be an Auror, and you need five N.E.W.T.s for that.'
'And anyone paying attention knew you were up to something,' Harry snorted. 'Please, you're the worst person at keeping secrets.'
Harry looked around him. Further down on the bar, a group of witches were laughing uproariously and drinking from a tray of drinks, which spun wildly. The bartender winked at them and flicked his wand towards their glasses, which roared with flame. One of the witches caught Harry looking and gave him a saucy wink.
'It's hidden,' he said flatly. 'There are only three living people who know its location and none of them are going to tell. It's destructive, Malfoy, it causes war and bloodshed wherever it goes. You should know better by now than to wish for something like that.'
Harry remembers 20 October because it's the first day Malfoy makes an edible breakfast and, despite the fact that he finds a Bertie Bott's bean in his porridge—'Flavour?' Malfoy says hopefully—Harry has to admit that it tastes okay.
At last most of Gryffindor departed, and aside from a few small clusters of students gathered up and down the table, it was just Harry and Hermione and Ron.
'This is all of Hogwarts?' Malfoy breathed. 'Every room, every entrance? If I had only had this in sixth year—it would have been so easy—'
She looks up at him with pain in the wetness of her eyes, both admonishing and startled. "D-don't be silly, Harry. This is my career. I never would have been made Minister if so many competent people hadn't died in the war. I'm lucky, and I'm glad I was able to have a hand in reconstruction."
“She called Goldstein chubby,” Ron continued to snicker, folding the paper and sticking it into his bag for posterity. “Ha, he is getting a bit round, isn’t he?”
It was snowing steadily outside, and by the time Harry returned to the dormitory to pack, everyone else had gone. Neville and Dean had left him a scrap of parchment on his pillow that said, in colored inks, “Happy Christmas Harry!” with several Golden Snitches scribbled around the edges. In the empty dormitory, in which Seamus’s absence was even more pronounced, Harry was grateful for it.
The July heat waned at last and the weather endured for several days, but the warmth returned viciously just as the summer passed into August, and Harry’s sixteenth birthday dawned scorching and cloudless. It was his first birthday anywhere but Privet Drive, and the thought was conflicting—on one hand, he was finally with people who loved him, but on the other, the thought of Privet Drive made it difficult to breathe. He thought of his Aunt Petunia haunting corners for weeks, her face red and raw from so many tears. Sometimes he dreamed about her, and she always smothered him with her sobbing, beating at him uselessly with her fists.
'I,' he stammered, 'I suppose it's habit, we used to use that corner of the courtyard all the time, to talk about things with Voldemort.'
“YOU,” Uncle Vernon bellowed, the instant Harry stepped inside the house with Mr. Weasley at his back. “YOU—YOU MURDERER, HOW DARE YOU COME IN HERE? YOU KILLED OUR DUDLEY, BOY! UNDO IT RIGHT NOW! GET OUT YOUR THINGERMAJIGGER AND BRING HIM BACK, YOU HEAR ME?”
He felt weightless at the same time he felt as if a great burden were resting on his shoulders; something buoyant was brimming inside him and burned as it did. He had the leaden pain of grief dulling a place in his chest, and something prickling, something close to hope. He had no home, no family to speak of. But he had his friends. Someday, somewhere, he might have to die and, so doing, might fail a whole world.
“What are you staring at?” he snarled as he passed them, and though he was speaking to all of them, his eyes bored into Harry. Moody took him sternly by the elbow, then, and he jerked so sharply away that even Moody’s scarred visage screwed up in surprise. Harry watched the sad hunch of Malfoy’s back until he passed through the door.
"No, but Bellatrix was horrible," Ginny said. "But then, I can't imagine growing up here was very much fun. Sirius was lucky."
“You wouldn’t.” Malfoy’s lip lifted with disdain. “Didn’t you like Rita Skeeter’s article, Potter? I made sure to tell her all about how Granger betrayed you. Or did you get sick of her, was that the way of it? Her dirty blood get to be too much for you?” Behind him, two Slytherin girls giggled, and he smirked.
“You alluded to it, and as far as I am concerned, that’s the same thing.” Draco looked as if he were about to protest further, but Remus overrode him once again. “You may not be my student here, but you are my guest. I’ve heard that the Malfoys are admired for their gracious manners. I’d hate to be proven wrong.”
Harry lapped the pitch, keeping his eyes peeled for any sight of the Snitch, but he saw nothing yet, only Malfoy, speeding by on the opposite side, and at the sight of him, Harry’s blood boiled. He zoomed higher, passing over Ginny’s head as she dodged out of Malcolm Baddock’s way, and made for the Slytherin goalhoops.
The whiteness envelops him, stark and comforting, and the voices outside blur as he moves away from his own portrait and into the uncharted territory of the Ministry. Draco catches up with him just as Harry stomps into a painting of water lilies in a swamp. Harry sinks to mid-thigh in the mire, dark water sloshing cold and paint-like on his skin. He disrupts the lilypads and they go scattering, stems twining about his legs. Draco splashes in after him, as heedlessly unaware as Harry was, yelping at the cold. Water lilies stick to them, the petals daubs of white paint.
Ron had gone crimson and Hermione looked rather pink, but Harry couldn’t help grinning at Ginny, who looked pleased with herself. He had wondered exactly what had come of Ron’s revelation in Diagon Alley, but neither Ron nor Hermione had had the wherewithal to mention any new developments to him.
“You need to watch your temper,” Malfoy shouted through the wind to him, sneering as they rounded the corner by the Slytherin goalhoops and sped off on a curve, “I’d hate to think you would get so worked up about a couple of Muggles in Wales—"
Cho flushed again. “Well—she’s going out with Anthony now, isn’t she—and she told me about last year, how all that was a mistake—"
Harry snorted. “Malfoy,” he said, almost patiently, “your dad’s name will never be cleared. He’s a murderer and he works for Voldemort. There’s no way the Ministry’s ever going to let him go.”
!” Harry roared, but she dodged the curse and it hit the wall, shattering flecks of stone into the room with a loud ringing sound. Bellatrix let out a raucous laugh.
"I reckon she's still a bit upset over last night," Ron muttered to Harry. "Go on, what'd the Ministry send you now? Hope it's not another memo calling you batty, had quite enough of that last year."
“He hasn’t come since, though, has he?” Remus mused, cradling his empty tea cup. “It’s hard to say, Harry. It could be that he was trying to spy. Or he could have just been curious.”
“That is incorrect, Potter,” Snape hissed, then turned sharply to glare at the section behind Harry, where someone had giggled quietly. “How unsurprising. Ten points from Gryffindor. Perhaps a Slytherin might know . . . yes, Mr. Zabini, do inform us . . .”
'It might,' Harry insisted. 'You might get it, just tell me what it is. D'you want to be an Auror too?'
"Ministry owls!" Mrs. Weasley muttered, as Harry gingerly pulled the letter from his breakfast. "I keep telling Arthur, they need to do something about this! It's horrendous, the way they come in dropping things every which way, like regular old pets, they are! The Ministry, of all things! Official business!" She continued muttering as she stalked back to the sink and waved her wand imperiously. The scrubbing brush, which had been leisurely sloshing around the pan, began to spin so vigorously that Harry saw only a soapy blur.
'Forces me full of crystallized pineapple,' Charlie added from inside. 'Yeurgh, I hate the stuff. Hagrid, your rock cakes are better.'
The more it came back to him, the angrier Harry got. 'Gryffindor deserved that win, Malfoy! Ron and Hermione and I beat all seven tasks to take back the Sorcerer's Stone and prevent Voldemort from becoming immortal! Don't you think that's a little more important than a handful of points you got from sucking up to teachers all year?'
Harry had hoped to put off his first class with Tonks for as long as possible, so his appetite waned significantly when he scanned his schedule and discovered that Defense Against The Dark Arts was the first thing that morning. Ron, who was shoveling in porridge to Harry’s left, showed no such trepidation.
The fourth-year shrugged and went back to his conversation as Harry made his way across the room to a chair by the window. The day was still a brilliant, unfair blue, and if he peered closely, he could make out two figures that looked like Ron and Hermione, sitting by the lake. He watched for several moments to see if Ginny would appear and join them, but she was nowhere to be seen.
Malfoy returned to classes a day later, slipping out into the hallway during lunch, as if hoping no one would see. Unfortunately for him, Harry was waiting, a brown paper package under one arm.
Harry shuts his eyes for a second.  The sunlight is filtering down through the trees, and he can hear the birds singing; it is a perfect, peaceful day, and it reminds him of the afternoons he used to spend with Ginny by the lake, though he knew even then that the time was fast approaching when those afternoons would end, when he would have to leave behind the illusions of safety at Hogwarts and go to meet Voldemort and kill him.
Harry tensed, but Anthony was faster, and he seized Malfoy by the sleeve. “Don’t you talk about her that way,” he snapped, showing more emotion than Harry had ever seen from him.
'Shut up,' Harry said; he waved at Aberforth, who shook a blackened rag at him in what Harry took for a return hello. 'What do you want? Butterbeer?'
Harry realized that he had been so caught up in Ginny and other things that he had forgotten just how isolated Malfoy was, how friendless. All Malfoy's tormenting had actually overshadowed the fact that all Malfoy had were three tiny first-years who followed him around like ducklings.
He looked at Malfoy, this scarred and angled boy with ribs that still stuck out and a faded white skull scar on his wrist, who had thrust out his hand on the train as if Harry's friendship had been his right, who had blundered ever since. He could never seem to do a thing right; he was prickly on his best days. They had been in school together for nearly half Harry's life and unfathomably, the thought of the next year without Malfoy made something contract in his chest. He did not understand how Malfoy had become someone he wanted to keep seeing, but he had.
“There’s a prophecy there,” Harry explained, not quite looking at him. “It’s about me and Voldemort. It says that, um, I’m the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord. And that neither of us can live while the other survives.”
Rather than respond, Tonks slid off the desk and stood there, hands on her hips. “I get the idea you’ve had quite a variety of professors in the past years,” she said, “some of them awful. I know all of you passed your OWLs last year, but some of you—" Harry colored as her eyes passed over him—“are leaps ahead of others, so I’d like a general idea of how much you know. Why don’t you all partner up and we’ll do some demonstrations.”
'Fine, you came here to bargain with me to save you, then,' Harry snaps.  'I've said all right, haven't I?  I'll help you.'
Malfoy's eyes are still wild.  'You were just blithering on about killing me without a second thought, and now I'm supposed to believe you when you say I'll be pardoned?'
'Oh, just go talk to Cho,' Hermione mutters.  When Harry gives her a blank look, she rolls her eyes.  'I know this is bit above and beyond Ron's level of advice giving, but if you want to know why she came tonight, maybe you should just go ask her yourself.'
'Hi, Harry,' Hermione said, mistaking his bewildered look for exasperation. She had the grace to look embarrassed. 'Um, we've made up. We're sorry for the past few weeks, it can't have been easy.'
“How does it feel?” Remus asked him gently, when Harry went to his rooms for tea. He looked gray and tired, sitting there with a stack of essays on his lap, and something in Harry’s chest tightened protectively at the sight of him. “Albus thought I should know as well, in case you had any . . . questions.”
. Now who do we have? This second-rate school is run by Muggle-lovers who favor Gryffindor and you know it—"
Living as a painting is a farce of immortality. It's actually quite uncomfortable, as Harry feels at times that even the air he breathes is thick like paint, but he gets used to it.
Draco glared at him. "Oh, I'll bet you knew," he accused, "I bet you had a good laugh about it with Weasley, didn't you, Potter? Ha ha, Malfoy's getting what he deserves at last, that right? Ha ha, poor Malfoy can't buy a couple quills, he's got to patch up his robes, next thing you know, he'll be living in a hole in the ground, too . . ."
'Because they're cowards!' Harry shouted. 'Because they, they think it's all right to let more people die, for the good of society or a, a peaceful future—'
“Come to think of it, Potter, I don’t recall mentioning anybody named Sirius. You must be hearing things again. I was only inquiring after your dreams—"
After the meal, Malfoy poked through the house, nosing into old desk drawers and excavating small trinkets from the cabinets, until Harry got so bored with following him that he went upstairs to fetch the book Hermione had lent him about healing charms. On his way up from the kitchen, he heard voices and stopped.
“I was thinking,” Hermione said, catching him by the elbow when class was over, “maybe you could try talking to Ron tonight, what do you think? If you just tell him rationally—Harry?“
Even if he had been looking around for Tonks, he didn’t see her. Maybe she’d changed her appearance on purpose, he thought, which didn’t help at all. But then, he wasn’t supposed to be searching the crowds for his professor, of all things, and Tonks had a job to do.
“You don’t know anything about it,” Harry shouted, spinning to face him. “What are you doing here anyway, gloating?”
He had been eighteen years old for five hours now. Drowsy birdsong drifted through the open window, while the just-rising sun turned to gold the room's pale gray walls, as well as the inhabitants of the Muggle pictures pasted there. It was just the sort of muggy morning that, less than two months ago, Harry had never thought he would live to see again.
“I am not little,” Ginny interrupted sharply, having slipped back in without their noticing, “and you don’t know anything about it, Ron. Besides, Hermione and I are going with you.”
Andromeda shrugged; she stroked the arm of her rocking chair without thinking. 'I'm one of the only Blacks left. I think it's figured that out. We're growing on each other.'
'That is,' said Doge, 'that is, well, I suppose he is not a murderer, but a Death Eater, yes, that cannot be denied.'
“Wait,” Harry said, and shrugged off his robes, kicked his trainers off the end of the couch. “Here—sit up—" He helped Draco struggle out of his robes and then was tugged at the buttons on his shirt, until Draco pushed at him and said, “Potter,” exasperatedly, and undid them in a hurry. Harry pulled his own shirt off in one fluid motion over his head, and had barely dropped it before Draco pulled him down again, his skin warm under Harry, both of them warm, touching, moving against one another.
In response, Harry shoved him, and Malfoy shoved back, to the point where they both almost fell off and had to clutch at one another to stay on the mattress.
Malfoy looked similarly shocked, and he wrenched his robe out of Anthony’s grasp. “Get your filthy hands off me,” he snapped. “As if I’d want anything that touched that,” here he looked at Hermione with an ugly sneer, “anywhere near me.”
Harry swallowed hard, determined not to cry. Glancing down at the next picture, he saw Sirius and his dad play-fighting in the grass. As he watched, Sirius pinned his dad to the ground and looked up to wave triumphantly at him.
Harry glances over at him.  'Yeah,' he says.  'He said he was glad.  You know, we're not going to send you to Azkaban, Malfoy, unless you give us a good reason.  Dumbledore means what he says, and so do I.'
"Be more discreet?" she pleads, and Harry agrees, because he hadn't meant to upset her. He forgets sometimes that she's alive, because everyone else he talks to—like Draco—is dead already. After awhile, they settle into more mundane topics, and yet Harry cannot help but notice that Hermione is businesslike even in casual conversation. Perhaps she is, in her own way, also dead.
“Mum,” Ginny yelled out, “Ron won’t let me come with him to Fred and George’s shop! And he won’t let Hermione come either!”
Harry narrowed his eyes. 'After everything this year, after what happened? After I came to you, after I've told you time and time again that I would have protected you if you'd have just come to me at the end of sixth year—I would have, why don't you believe me?'
“I wanted out,” Tonks said, not looking at him. Her eyes were glassy with what could only be the beginnings of tears, and that made Harry angrier than anything else: that after this, she could still want to cry about it, that she was guilty enough to do so. Part of him wanted her to try and hex him again, to praise Voldemort in front of him. It would be easier, he thought.
'He either knows I'm safe or thinks I'm dead,' Malfoy says miserably.  'He won't come if that's what he thinks—he hasn't got any reason to protect me—'
Hermione refused to answer him, nor would she look at Harry, though later she was whispering furiously with Ginny. Ron was nonplussed, though Harry thought he had an idea what it was all about.
Malfoy's expression clouded in confusion, and then he gave a start of recognition and laughed, a sort of uncontrolled
'You should have!'  Pansy smacks him on the arm, tears still running down her face. 'You're supposed to be a hero, Potter!  You're not supposed to be incompetent and get people killed!  You unworthy little twit!'
“Which is exactly what I intend to find out,” Moody said darkly, giving Draco a suspicious look. Somehow, it seemed he’d acquired several more scars on his already terrifying face, and it lent him an even more menacing air. “It appears that Nymphadora Tonks was less trustworthy than we had thought.”
‘I’ve missed this,’ Ginny says contentedly as she settles against him, as if they had ever really had it.
Hermione's hand flew to her mouth. 'Oh, Harry,' she said. 'Harry, I'm so sorry.' She wrapped her arms around him, tight enough to suffocate, and for an instant it was all he wanted, until he really did feel as if he were suffocating. Ron thumped him on the back several times, his expression rueful.
Harry understood, after a fashion; he had never been the sort to care about expensive tastes, but he knew what it was like to keep up appearances. Malfoy might not be received warmly at Hogwarts, but he would act like he could care less.
Harry looked over at her, all former elation forgotten. He could tell that what Remus had told her wasn’t good news from the grave look on her face. “What is it?” he said again, more quietly.
Harry shrugged. In the shadows sometimes, Andromeda still looked like Bellatrix, but here she was in a swathe of cold sunshine and she only looked age-lined, old. 'Kreacher's made breakfast, do you want some?'
The portraits at Hogwarts always seemed happy. Harry wonders if he is the only one with such an annoyance at being half there after his body has gone. He doesn't want to still be thinking. He doesn't want to be sitting in his chair, chin in hand, staring out at the crying visitors to the memorial, wishing he were dead. Except he is already dead.
'We thought you were dead,' Hermione exclaimed. Though she wasn't flinging her arms around Malfoy or sobbing uncontrollably as she sometimes did, she sounded as worried as she ever had been about Ron or Harry himself, and Harry loved her for it.
Harry thought of his first day at Hogwarts and looked across the table where Nearly-Headless Nick was floating, eyeing Hermione's spotted dick with an expression of jealousy.
The students eventually quieted, more out of curiosity than respect. The classroom maintained its silence for a brief moment, and then Tonks swung her legs up beneath her and crossed them, Indian style. “Hem, hem,” she said, sounding exactly like Professor Umbridge, and then laughed at the startled and horrified looks on many faces. Her laughter was a shock itself in the quiet classroom, before a few people began cracking smiles. “I’m Tonks,” she greeted them, but no sooner had she spoken that Blaise Zabini raised his hand.
'And a great Chaser on top of it,' Harry says.  'Yeah, let's take a walk.  I haven't been around the Burrow in ages.'
“Absolutely nutters, that one,” Ron muttered to Harry, a moment later, as they followed her down the hall.
The end of August turned scorching, and in the heatwave, the days sped by. Their last evening arrived in a bustle of preparing their trunks and scrambling to clean, and before he knew it, Harry was sitting outside the Burrow with Hermione, watching the sun go down. Everything drifted quietly: the threadbare sheets drying over the garden like sails; Crookshanks stealing around the hedges after a gnome; Celestina Warbeck warbling,
Some insidious part of him, that had been bothering him since the afternoon in question, demanded to know why he hadn’t.
Ron gave a tremendous swallow and repeated, 'You're Head Girl! We're supposed to help the Prefects lead the first-years to their houses at the end of the feast!'
!' And with that she snatched the book off the table, hugged it in her arms, and marched away into the shelves.
Harry can hear Hermione and Ron laughing in the kitchen, cleaning up, and wishes he were in there with them.  'Malfoy is staying with us for awhile,' he says, careful on every word, as if saying them slowly will mean they are disconnected, separate from their meaning.  Neville, however, seems to gather their meaning without a problem.
Ginny toppled off Harry's lap and barely managed to keep herself from falling onto the floor. Dean stood in the doorway, looking a mixture of embarrassed and annoyed.
On the way out of class, Malfoy tried to trip him, sending Harry stumbling straight into Hannah Abbott, who squeaked. 'Sorry,' Harry muttered. 'Hey, Malfoy! Get back here!'
“Look, I did change my mind,” Tonks said, more quietly, when he said nothing. “I was worried, I found you—I was going to help you, I was—"
Was this why he was so fixated on Draco, then? Because he wanted to save him? But no, there was some surety in the way he looked forward to their Defense sessions; there was something about the way he knew the bitter lines of Draco’s mouth, even when he was sneering, even when Harry wanted to punch him for something he’d said. And if he were being entirely truthful, he’d seen it back in July, that night at the club, when Draco had tipped his head back and moved against Pansy and looked at Harry, as if he knew, as if he wanted to know. Jealous and furious and challenging, his gaze had been, but he’d looked at Harry and Harry only, and Harry had remembered that.
It was all a blur to Harry. He stared at Malfoy through the growing crowd. Malfoy’s pale face stared back at him, expressionless, and then Ron pushed him aside to get to Harry, and he was gone.
The circular office at the top of the moving spiral staircase is untouched, and Harry hesitates at the entrance, as if he might be interrupting something.  Dumbledore's silver instruments still whir; the Sorting Hat droops on a shelf.  Harry wonders, looking at it, when the last time was that Hogwarts did not open at the start of term.
It could have been Harry's imagination, but Malfoy might have flushed the tiniest bit at the word 'mutual.'
Malfoy yelled something but no sound came out. Harry had to hold him off while he struggled against him, shouting silently.
It was no place to raise a baby. Harry looked at the tub again, the way the tile was chipping, the claw feet, and he thought of Fenrir Greyback, and then of Remus, as he walked down the hall.
'You're lying,' Harry hisses.  He hasn't been this angry with Malfoy in days.  'He would have recovered!  He was the greatest wizard—he—you're lying!'
When they stopped, and Harry let his hand fall from Draco’s side, Draco’s fingers were still curved possessively around Harry’s hip. Harry flushed as they broke away and he turned to take the key from the motorbike’s ignition. It was better than speaking. He had no idea what to say.
‘Well, I’m sure you and Romilda will be very happy together,’ Hermione teased. ‘Seriously, though, Harry. If you’d just talk to her. She’s not seeing Dean. She’s been really unhappy, actually, and I think if you just talked—’
'We're trying to find out about Regulus Black,' Harry says when no one else answers.  'Mrs. Black is the only one who might know anything.  But she isn't talking.'
Malfoy stared at him. 'Everything comes at a price,' he repeated. 'How was I to know I could trust the old man? Better the bad lot you know than the bad lot you don't, right?'
‘With whom,’ Hermione said. She sounded absent-minded, mild, but eight years of friendship meant Harry knew the calculation behind her casual tone. ‘And I’d imagine he’s sleeping in his dormitory bed, if he’s noticed you aren’t.’
'Why don't you ask him yourself,' Pansy said, which would have been innocuous if not for the sidelong look she gave him. Harry glanced at Daphne and from the way she raised a delicate eyebrow, he knew she'd caught on. He was sure his face was crimson.
sometimes, and—' Harry scowls at Ron, who is apologetically mouthing something about Hermione, '—and, and fine, if you are, we'll throw in a cake.'
Hermione sighed and petted Crookshanks absently as she spoke. “We were right about Hay-On-Wye,” she whispered. “There was an attack this morning. He said that we probably saved a lot of Muggles, because the Aurors there were forewarned. But several Aurors and Dumbledore’s brother were killed.”
'The Weasel girl and the Muggle,' Malfoy drawled, apparently having caught the right glimpse over Harry's shoulder. Harry's blood felt hot, feverish. 'Sordid goings-on in Gryffindor Tower, are there? What, Potter, are you embarrassed? The future Mrs. Potter busy dallying with another—possibly even in your bed—'
'You don't act like it!' Ginny snapped. 'All right? That's what I was going to say. That you can say that but you don't act like it and I don't believe you really do.'
'Some other bint from Beauxbatons and that Ravenclaw you were drooling over, Chang,' Pansy whispered. 'Honestly, I think his father helped draw up the list, I never even saw Draco talking to those French girls. Probably why the little bitch laughed in his face when he asked her.'
“This is why she shouldn’t be allowed to listen in!” Ron exclaimed. “Gin, Tonks is a half-blood! She’s an Auror! Lupin’s been fighting You-Know-Who since the first time! He knew Harry’s dad!”
“She never wrote back,” Tonks assured him. “My mum kept writing, though. She said she was always closest with Narcissa. She tells me stories, you know. I think she gets lonely, sometimes.”
'At this rate, I'll never get Agrippa,' Ron groaned. 'Mind you, I don't pay much attention to Chocolate Frog cards these days, but I'm only saying, if it happened to come along—'
'Yes,' Harry groaned, 'God, Malfoy—' He felt like his voice wasn't his own. His toes were curling in his trainers, chest heaving for breath.
The subject was inescapable. Harry ran his finger along the dust on the banister, frowning. “Well, but, I thought,” he said, “you can’t just—Sirius’s house?”
Harry rolled over, sighing. He was getting distracted again, and he had Occlumency the next evening. How had he forgotten? The last thing he wanted was Snape to see his memories of the night before or, worse, his dream of Malfoy. He tried his best to clear his mind, but it was no use; his thoughts were dashing between the escaped Death Eaters, the way Tonks had grinned at him only one night ago, the scared, defiant look Malfoy had worn as he’d scuttled out of the room before Moody . . .
“And Dumbledore, he knows what’s going on,” Ron added, rather enthusiastically. “And my mum and dad, they’re keeping an eye out.” Still, he looked grimly across the table at Harry. “I reckon we better keep on with the DA, anyway.”
He was still waiting for Draco when, nearly a quarter of an hour later, Draco stepped inside the Entrance Hall, looking wet and furious. He started in surprise when he saw Harry.
'Now he's making threats, Harry!' Ron exclaims.  'What kind of idea is this?  I'm sleeping with my door locked.'
“I’ve changed my mind,” Malfoy sneered immediately. “I don’t want your stupid Defense lessons. As if I’d let you get near me with a wand.” Harry opened his mouth to reply, and Malfoy said quickly, “And don’t you dare hex me, Potter.”
'Please tell me the topic of your project by the next class period,' Slughorn boomed, bouncing a little on the balls of his feet. 'Now I'll leave you to it. Don't be afraid to be ambitious, boys and girls! The best Potions students are those who surprise me!'
In the resulting chaos, most of which is caused by Fred and George laughing so hard they knock over a long table of food, Hermione does a
Lights were going on all over Privet Drive, and across the street, some particularly loud neighbor shouted out the window, “It’s the middle of the bloody night, you hooligans! Go home!” But Harry had no time to pay attention to anything else, as Bellatrix was leaping to her feet, and before she could recover fully—
'Yeah, I'll bet he just wants our secrets!' Ron exclaims, mouth still half full, before Hermione can finish. 'Durmstrang's all about the Dark Arts, his headmaster was Karkaroff, don't you think it's all a bit suspicious—'
Harry studied the picture again; it was possible that it had been Pansy, but she had seemed so surprised at Harry's presence that it was doubtful. Someone else, then. He would not put it past Rita Skeeter to have him followed.
‘It was a difficult time,’ Hermione added, after Harry had been silent for a while. ‘No one came out whole. Not me, not you, not—’
'Harry, my boy, I must say you're off today,' Slughorn said when he came around, shaking his head in disappointment. By this point, Malfoy looked on the verge of choking with laughter, and Harry whirled on him.
He might be able to keep Voldemort out of his dreams with practice, but nothing kept out the nightmares.
He was achingly hard, the very idea of fucking Draco cemented in the back of his mind, and when Draco tentatively slid his right leg up and propped it on the back of the couch, thighs spread under Harry, heat flared tight in his stomach. “You sure,” he whispered hard in Draco’s ear, and Draco hissed, “Yes—Potter—" and Harry kissed him, wet, desperate, Draco kissing him back hungrily.
Harry waited until Ron’s head disappeared from the flames before he stood up and faced the stairs, arms folded. Sure enough, after a moment, Draco appeared from the shadows, one eyebrow raised. Harry scowled at him. “You were listening.”
“I liked you, Harry,” Tonks said tightly. “I didn’t want to hurt you, I told them that, and Bellatrix said if I just gave you the Portkey, that’d be enough—I thought you could fight her, you were strong enough—and you were—"
“With some of Slytherin, I’ll reckon!” he exclaimed, between mouthfuls. “Just wait’ll Tonks puts them in their places!”
The rest of their shopping went by without a hitch, and by the time they arrived back at the Burrow, they were too exhausted to make the last Apparition to 12 Grimmauld Place. Ron turned on a Quidditch match on the wireless while Mrs. Weasley bustled around the kitchen, reminding Harry suddenly of Kreacher at his most attentive, multiple pots of food and chopping knives at his command. 'It smells great, Mrs. Weasley,' he said, and she came right over to him and gave him a fond kiss on the forehead. It had been months, and still people hugged one another too long before leaving, or urgently whispered, 'Keep safe,' before realizing there was no longer the same danger.
'He's had a lot of chances if he wants to kill me,' Harry says uncertainly.  'He's had his wand back for months, and we sleep in the same room—'
“Excuse me if I don’t leap at the chance to get cozy with your happy little family,” Draco finally sneered. “I’d rather be a Hufflepuff than make nice with Ron Weasley.”
'Slughorn!' said Malfoy. 'Listening to him, it's worse than Binns except that all the stories are about him! Though I don't expect you mind, he's positively drooling over you.'
'You laughed when Draco was bounced around by that horrible Moody imposter in fourth year!' Pansy accused. 'And you set a snake on Justin Finch-Fletchley, you framed all my friends' parents and you nearly killed Draco when you ripped his chest open with that spell!'
'I'll give it back tomorrow, if you behave yourself,' Harry insists.  He feels suddenly like Malfoy's father and has to stifle a laugh.  Half-smirking to himself, he adds, 'But you have to be on your best behavior, Malfoy, no shenanigans from you—'
Harry's throat made a noise he hadn't known himself capable of, shooting right into Malfoy's tight fist and spilling over his knuckles, and for an instant the world went dizzyingly black and it was a miracle, Harry thought, that he didn't collapse bonelessly on the floor right then and there. He felt as dazed as if he'd just taken a Bludger to the head.
Harry didn't know why he felt torn between laughing and commiserating. It had been four years ago. How could it have been so long? He thought about Malfoy in fourth year, so pale and splotchy with anger, all angles and jeering laughter. He was forever flashing his Potter Stinks badge all over. He had been turned into a ferret then, Harry remembered.
Harry felt a stab of guilt. Ron had never really got over the fact that Draco had visited Grimmauld Place for over a week. “I didn’t see his letters, Ron,” he said quietly.
"I’m sure you think she's a whore," Draco snapped, without provocation, "some kind of desperate trophy wife, I'm sure you're just having a laughing fit over it."
“I’m sure,” Harry said impatiently. “Hey, that one sort of looks like Susan Bones’s hair, doesn’t it . . .”
'What?'  There's a strange mix of fear and excitement on Malfoy's face.  'He didn't—does he know what's been—'
The silence in the common room was deafening. Harry realized, after a moment, that this was Ron he was talking to, and not a Slytherin, who would have merely taken it in stride. He swallowed.
The air was cool for the end of October, and Hermione had her Gryffindor scarf wound around her neck, her cheeks flushed pink with the chill. “Oh, Harry, Ron, it’s cold out,” she said, as soon as they stepped outside and began making their way across the grass, still stiff with frost. “Ron, what would your mum say? You should bundle up!“
"Coming," Harry yelled back, stuffing his feet in his trainers without unlacing them. The back of one was crammed under his heel, and he wriggled his foot until it slipped on. He reached for his robes just as Draco stood up, startlingly close, and put a hand on his shoulder.
Hermione and Ron had to stay in the Great Hall to supervise the exodus of students, and Harry stayed with them, feeling as if it would be a very boring year indeed if he had to keep following the Head Boy and Head Girl around all day. Ginny stuck around as well, chattering to Charlie, though when the Hall was nearly empty she came over to them and slipped her hand into Harry's own. He glanced down at her, surprised but pleased.
'Malfoy Manor,' Harry advised the little owl, who hooted softly and gave Harry's thumb an affectionate nibble. 'Make sure you get it to Draco Malfoy, all right?' He had always been sure that Hedwig understood him, but now he realized how foolish that was. 'Go on, then,' he said, as his owl hooted once more and shifted on the windowsill.
After a short second, Malfoy said, 'Harper was rubbish, obviously, he wasn't worth the Galleons I paid him.'
Vernon Dursley stuttered, “What the devil—" and then, louder, “P-Petunia!  Petunia!” upon which his wife came running from the kitchen and promptly began to scream.
“But I never set out to change him,” Harry said softly before he could help it, realizing as he spoke that it was true.
. “Dudley?” he murmured, slowly, as if he’d been mistaken. He felt as if he were in a trance. “Not Dudley. Aunt Petunia would never let anything happen to her Dudley.”
“I’m sure the Ministry doesn’t look very favorably on the Malfoy name,” Harry continued cheerfully, “and, well, the Blacks don’t have the cleanest record in history either, do they, so your mum couldn’t do much there. It’s good to have friends in the Ministry, but you seem to have made the wrong ones, haven’t you? I heard Umbridge is still in St. Mungo’s and won’t be working for years, if she’s even allowed back.”
Hermione was right, Harry realized in a panicked flash, he did only like Quidditch players. No wonder so many giggling girls had turned up for Quidditch tryouts sixth year.
As for Hermione, he found her in the library after breakfast, sulking over yet another book. Before Harry could even finish asking her how she was, she started in, exclaiming, 'Honestly, he's suspicious of everything! How am I supposed to ever do anything? If that's what he thinks of me, maybe I
Living is an instinct, Harry thinks, as he watches Draco shiver and wipe away the droplets that have splashed on his cheeks. There is faint moonlight settling over them, cold and caressing, and the edges of him are blurred. Painted.
'What, it can't be worse than Lucius Malfoy, can it?' said Harry blithely. 'He was just a teenager, I mean, when he almost killed Dumbledore he was still sixteen, doesn't that mean—'
“Scared?” Harry demanded, his face throbbing. His voice sounded so strangled with anger that he hardly recognized it. “I haven’t forgotten that Cruciatus Curse, you know, Malfoy. But,” and here he leaned in as close as he dared, “the difference is that, me? I want to hurt you.”
Dinner at the Gryffindor table rarely passed without some sort of squabble, whether it was Ginny and Dean fighting and making up within the course of a meal over something nobody but Ginny and Dean could understand, Seamus inevitably offending somebody, or Ron flaring up over the topic of Anthony Goldstein, which was happening more and more frequently. Most of the time, Ron addressed these arguments towards Harry, as if they were in perfect agreement, which left Harry to nod occasionally or add a halfhearted, “Sure, Ron.” Hermione, for her part, ignored them.
‘You think Albus Dumbledore would have had good relationship advice for you?’ Hermione snorts into her tea. ‘Perennially single, reported to be pining for life over a Dark wizard he defeated decades before?’
Then Malfoy's leg shifted without warning and something gut-wrenching and electric shot straight to Harry's cock, at the exact moment Malfoy exclaimed, 'Potter, are you—'
“Okay,” he said, softly, and reached out to grab Draco’s wrist. He tugged him gently towards him. “Good. That’s what I thought.”
Sighing, Harry kicked at a fallen cushion on the ground. Just when Draco was beginning to become tolerable, too.
“Oh, Harry, don’t say that,” Hermione said gently. “You’re lucky that you weren’t. They were probably there for you.”
Harry whirled on his best friend. 'So I should leave him there to die, is that it? Get his soul sucked out of him? Is that what you'd do?'
“Funny,” Draco choked out, though his face had gone white. “I seem to remember you being the one who followed me.”
Harry said, “Hedwig,” dazedly, still shocked by his cousin’s sudden death. “I need—I’ve got Hedwig at the Dursleys, and my trunk, I—"
'His face looks as if he got on the wrong end of a Stretching Charm,' Malfoy says, and peers at Harry as if he's sustained considerable head damage.  'Will you carry me?'
Harry finally remembers to ask Draco why he had Harry killed. It doesn't carry the same importance now, doesn't hold the same rage, and Harry asks almost nonchalantly. Draco, however, looks pained at the question. Harry figures that Draco's been pondering the answer for the past ten years.
“She killed Dudley, didn’t she,” he blurted. “She knew about Privet Drive. She was there herself, I showed her my room, I—"
'No, I didn't mean that,' Harry said quickly. 'Well, I did, but it's no excuse. Look, forget it. Let's go eat.'
'Fine,' Hermione sniffs, 'then Exploding Snap,' which, to Harry's knowledge, she has never played either.  Ron points this out, and she gives him a disparaging look.  'Some people,' Hermione says, 'had better things to do in school than waste time playing games.'
'—corporeal, but the Minister at the time wanted to use a classification system based on encounters with death, so that they would be cast in with Inferi and sometimes the victims of the Dementor's Kiss—'
“Oh, I’m glad they canceled,” Padma said, smiling at him. “But Cho was so close, there! Still, it’s awfully cold out. We’re going to the kitchens to warm up, Harry, do you want to come?”
His blood was pouring out and Harry could not remember a single healing spell that Charlie had taught them.
, Harry thought wryly, even as he doubted it. Malfoy was full of whinging and threats, but Harry would bet he didn’t own a thing that could be considered Dark magic.
"I want to know if you'll follow me," he whispers, and slips out to his left—sideways, moonlit, like a flash of silver. For once in this twisted frame-to-frame existence, he is alive. He can already feel the heat, the fire. And maybe, for the first time since he opened his eyes to the dim stone of the memorial, since he felt the disconcerting feeling of waking in a world of nothing but paint, maybe he forgives Draco. He thinks he senses Draco behind him.
“No,” Draco said heatedly, “you have to stop doing this, people are starting to suspect something! Pansy saw you lurking around Slytherin on Thursday, she keeps demanding what you could want with me, and I keep telling her you’re just desperate for Potions help, but she doesn’t—"
“GET INSIDE,” Harry yelled to the man who had bought the Dursleys’ home. He looked more curious than terrified, but Harry shoved him backwards so forcefully that he toppled over the doorstep and stared at Harry as if shocked at such a display of violence. But Harry had no time for niceties, as Bellatrix was racing towards him, and as he held out his wand, more windows flared with light—
“I know,” Harry said, although the image that came to mind first was not Draco, wand out to hex him, but Draco, sprawled on his bed, lips parted, practically waiting to be kissed. “I—I’m being careful.” He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Like I said, I should’ve told you—"
Ginny rolls her eyes.  'Spain peaked half a decade ago.  Charlie'd know that if he stopped to think.  He's just got a soft spot for them because they were his team, back when he was at school.  He pays more attention to dragons than broomsticks, these days.'
Harry knew it was impossible to deny it; he was flushing too much to blame it on the fire. “I have, um, thoughts,” he said vaguely.
'Who says I want to help you?' Zacharias says immediately, folding his arms.  But Hermione is already leading him into the kitchen, talking like Flitwick at his most excited.
“Yes,” Malfoy said. He sounded very cold. “You do that.” It was clearly a dismissal, and just then he rounded the corner alone, his expression turning pensive just before he caught sight of Harry. “Oh,” he said, startled. “It’s you.”
Doge frowned. 'Only for Albus,' he admitted at last. 'For what it's worth, I—I was blinded by love, I only wanted revenge for my oldest, dearest friend. I'm sorry, Harry, I must say, I didn't know you felt this passionately about his sentence, I thought you'd be glad to see Dumbledore's murderer face the justice he deserves.'
Malfoy bats his eyelashes at Harry.  'Wouldn't you like to know?' he drawls, looking far too much like a twelve-year old girl.
Harry ruefully watched her begin writing, unsure whether he liked her or hated her. But by the end of the class, she clapped him on the shoulder after sticking her notes in her bag and said, deadpan, “Cheer up, Potter, I didn’t get an O either.” By the time he looked up at her, she was halfway to the door.
'Slow down,' Ron muttered to his plate of toast. 'What are you about to do, become Supreme Mugwump?'
There was a loud shriek as they collided with someone rushing in the other direction. Harry automatically reached out to steady the other person, while Hermione exclaimed, 'Sorry!'
“It’s so obvious, how could I have forgotten?” Hermione exclaimed. “Hay-On-Wye. They’ve got to be in Hay-On-Wye. It’s full of books, it’s famous for its old bookstores! And it’s so close. It makes perfect sense.”
She landed, twisted, half on top of a low table, one pale arm twisted behind her back; her face looked almost regal in repose, but Harry had no time to contemplate it, as his first thought was escape.
“I guess that makes you a real saint,” Harry said sarcastically. “I’ll bet Moody was real grateful to hear that one.”
Harry felt like taking his Transfiguration book, throwing it on the floor, and stomping on it repeatedly. Instead, he snarled, “I thought we’d agreed Professor Kothari was the most likely suspect.”
They were both careening desperately upwards, Harry’s right hand clenched tight around his broom as his left, closer to the Snitch, extended out to grab it—he was so close, Malfoy grasping beside him, his fingers grabbing desperately at the air—
A smile flickered over Narcissa's face. 'Mine too. He used to flirt with me all the time, when I was at Hogwarts and him still waiting to go. He was all of ten.'
He still thought about Malfoy, when rushing out of Potions or dozing off in Charms, and even over breakfast, which was the ultimate problem. He'd given up and wanked over it, but this only made it worse, as he thought about what had happened about twice as much as before. He was about at the point of finding Malfoy and demanding answers when Ginny came in the common room, gave him a nervous smile, and sat down beside him.
He heard a sound behind him and whirled, ready to confront Voldemort himself. Instead, Malfoy stood there, arms folded. Looking decidedly unimpressed, he said, “Where are you running to now, Potter?”
'Are we, then?' Harry said before she could regain her momentum. He still felt as if he had a block of ice in his stomach. 'Going back?'
'I'll be down in a moment. Let me finish my cigarette. Bad for babies, you know.' She took a drag and looked out through the windowpanes, shining and polished for the first time in years. 'I can't believe I'm raising another child. Alone, too.'
Before Harry knew what he was doing, he said in an unexpected rush, 'Something happened with Malfoy. And me, I mean. We, um.'
'But he knows a great deal more about the world now, I should think,' Hermione sighed. 'As do you, I hope. He's only reacting to you the way he did in third year because that's the way you're reacting to him. You can't tell me that the Draco Malfoy who teased you about fainting on the Hogwarts Express is the same Draco Malfoy whose father is in Azkaban, who was tortured and blackmailed by Voldemort, who is, at this very minute, going to school in a place where not a single person likes him—'
'Oh, come off it,' Malfoy says.  'You say you were there?  Then you saw him too, Potter.  He was practically dead already.  Even if I hadn't been there, I'll wager he would have been finished within the hour.'
Malfoy didn't answer, however; he was staring down at the map, as if he couldn't get enough. Harry was sure that Malfoy was calculating its use as a tool, but he couldn't muster any disgust; he was pleased that someone appreciated its value.
“I do like Pansy, she’s my friend. But I don’t go around just kissing all my friends, Potter. You haven’t noticed Crabbe and Goyle locking lips lately, have you?”
'Hey, I spent six hours reading that fat book about Britain's six oldest wizarding families yesterday,' Ron retorts.  'I reckon even you don't know the first wizard to win the Triwizard Tournament—'
'To think I used to hate this house,' she said when she saw him, tapping ash into what he was sure used to be a family heirloom.
'Draco was hurt!' Pansy screeched. 'When have you ever been nice to him, when have you ever tried to be nice to any of us?'
“No!” he shouted, sitting bolt upright in his bed, forehead feeling as if it were about to split open. The ache throbbed as he looked around dazedly. He was in Hogwarts. In his own bed. Safe. Far away from Wales, where Lord Voldemort was pacing, deep in conversation with Bellatrix Lestrange.
He sees Malfoy’s name in the Prophet sometimes, or on rare occasions, sees the man himself, across Diagon Alley, down the hall in the Ministry. Sometimes they nod at each other. Sometimes they don’t.
'Now we're even,' said Malfoy, his expression shuttered, and then he turned and pushed his way out of the stall.
in the Ravenclaw Tower? Of course, it’s not anything in comparison to the real library, but they’ve a whole room of books, and there’s this one I’ve been looking for on Artemisia Lufkin, I’ve been looking for ages. It’s fantastic. Anthony was just showing me.”
—and for an instant, hands on her hips, she resembles Molly Weasley so much that Harry has to stifle a smile.
“It’s not like I haven’t faced him before,” Harry snarled. “You wouldn’t know anything about it, Malfoy.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said scathingly, still half in the shadows, “are you thick? Hogwarts is the other way.”
Still, it was one of the best experiences Harry had had in months, he realized as they landed and purred to a halt back in the shed. He felt almost as if it were Sirius’s Christmas present to him; he felt closer to Sirius there, even if Sirius was gone forever, even if he was dead.
Harry instinctively folded his arms, hugging his elbows; he felt the shiver run through him, thinking always of Sirius. Cedric's body, sprawled in the graveyard; Sirius, arching back, forever. Every morning in the mirror, his mother's eyes. "Maybe you've forgotten why there's a war to begin with," he said tersely. "Me."
'Not my fault if you can't keep your eyes on your cauldron,' Malfoy said loftily. 'And if I recall correctly, you're the one who insisted on sitting next to me.' He slung his bag over his shoulder and smirked at Harry's side of the desk, which was still a mess. 'See you around, Scarhead.'
'It's not an us and them situation,' Harry insisted. 'I'm not part of some big group who's always on the side of popular opinion—I mean, look how many times Hogwarts turned against me, no one would even talk to me when they thought I had it out for Muggle-borns in second year—'
When Harry reached the familiar phone booth that served as the visitor's entrance to the Ministry of Magic, he informed the disembodied voice that he had arrived to see Lucius Malfoy get what he deserved. Accordingly, when his badge toppled out, it read,
'Really awful,' Ron said truthfully. He wiped his mouth with a shudder. 'The bite isn't even that bad, it's only the bottom part of her face, you know. But she broke her back in the fall. I didn't—I didn't know it would be like that.'
Malfoy is silent, too.  He turns his face towards Harry, slightly green.  'That could have been us, Potter.'
'It can't be easy to be in his position right now,' Hermione continued on. 'And you certainly aren't helping.'
Now that Harry thought about it, he remembered Michael's name being read off at the memorial service, and Ginny squeezing his hand tight. At the time he had not made the connection . . . he had been caught up in his own thoughts . . .
'Oh, don't you?'  Harry arches an eyebrow at him.  He says, 'I thought that was exactly what you did.'
Harry shrugged. They stood in silence for a minute, neither looking at the other. Ginny fiddled with the edge of her left mitten, where a string was trailing.
“All right,” Harry said reluctantly, looking away from her. He hadn’t known Dennis very well. All he knew about Dennis was that he was Colin’s younger brother and once had fallen into the lake. In fact, Harry had never paid him much attention.
'The truth comes out,' Malfoy said, nodding. 'Harry Potter, savior of the world, can't spare a hand to guide a slightly tipsy Slytherin.'
“What are you doing?” Harry hissed, heart thumping. For a moment, thoughts still on Tonks’s friend, he had thought it was someone who was after him. “Why are you here?”
The older woman smiled. 'Would you? He's been quite the handful this morning. Actually, if you'll take him, I might have a walk around. It's been some time since I've got a good look at the place.'
'With the shoulders of a gorilla,' Malfoy maintained. 'You're a freak, Potter, that's the only explanation.'
Sparked by fear into anger, Harry snapped, “That’s a real plan, Malfoy, go on and tell your fugitive dad about how Harry Potter cursed you, I bet he’ll be real proud of you then."
'Oh, his house is Unplottable, I already checked,' Hermione said. Harry was sure his face visibly fell, and yet in answer, Hermione beamed at him. 'But I think I have an idea.'
Harry felt heat rush into his face and, infuriatingly, his cock twitched with interest at the recent memory of Malfoy, on his knees, just like that. Perhaps it was a sign that he had been spending too much time getting off with Malfoy. He could barely remember his old fantasies about Ginny; they were all consumed by the reality of Malfoy's skinny fingers and his reluctantly eager tongue. Ginny was right, he realized, he ought to get a real girlfriend. Especially as Malfoy already thought he had one.
'Do you want me to be the girl Weasel?' Malfoy said. He said it so casually that Harry stopped straightening his clothes and stared.
Malfoy looks at him almost curiously, and Harry realizes that he has just spoken to Malfoy like he talks to Ron.  Before he can do anything, correct himself or push on or turn away, Malfoy says, 'Did you find anything?'
Hermione's eyes immediately took on that dangerous light they knew all too well. 'N.E.W.T.s!' she exclaimed. 'I'd nearly forgot, I have to start revising right away! If we're going back for seventh year, they're only a year away, and I'm so behind!'
Tonks was, for some reason, snickering. “I probably scared you half to death,” she snorted, having to stop and catch her breath. “Well, now I feel ridiculous. We can talk Defense, if you want.”
For an instant, Harry had the idea of approaching them, perhaps asking Narcissa Malfoy if she had received his letter. But before he could even attempt to squeeze through the packed rows, the court was called to order.
Regulus had ended up dead. For the first time, Harry wondered whether he had deliberately chosen it over the lifetime of service.
He stared at her. He wanted to tell her that he did want to talk about it, but to Ron and Hermione, and with Ginny he did not want to think about the past and all they had been through. She was the future to him, the long days he had scarcely let himself imagine when in the middle of a war. He thought of her for an instant, the way she had looked bent over the battlefield. Harry had wanted to go to her and have her lead him away, promise him all sorts of things that were not death or Voldemort, but he had not been able to choose her then. She was not the war, the terrible things he had done and known, she was everything else.
Mrs. Weasley appeared at the kitchen door, drying her hands on her apron. “Now, now, Ron,” she said, “that’s not nice, Hermione’s a guest here, you know. All three of you will go, and that’s final. As for you, Ginny—"
'Oh,' Malfoy said. He looked odd, perhaps even pleased, if Harry didn't know better. 'Well, fine then.'
'Are you joking?' Malfoy said. 'As if I would throw out something I put so much time into making.' On the other side of his chest, he'd pinned the Weasley Is Our King badge.
When the spell wore off, Malfoy squawked, 'Lord, Potter, you've gotten to the point where you can't even listen to people who won't agree with you!'
“You look like Draco’s mum,” she giggled, unable to stop even when Malfoy glared balefully at her. “What? She does!”
'Not on purpose,' Ginny said impatiently. 'But what if I asked you, what if I said, could you wait a few years, could you
'In here, Harry,' she wavered from around the corner, and he ducked into their tiny scullery in surprise, the door falling shut behind him.
Charlie guffawed. 'Nor do I, to tell you the truth. And Hagrid certainly doesn't, do you? Haven't seen Madame Maxine around in months. Well, cheers, boys.'
"I'm not," Harry said. After a moment, as if to prove his solemn interest in the matter, he said, "How old is Benjamin Wilkes, anyway?"
He had left no one behind, had left nothing to anyone, in fact, save the bottle of memories he had granted Harry. They were all gone now, Snape and the woman he had loved and her husband and his best friends, even Dumbledore was gone. Harry, and Teddy, and Malfoy too, they were the ones who were left.
Malfoy's eyes snapped open and they flicked immediately to Harry. 'Potter? What are you doing here?'
It was another several seconds when Harry realized that Ginny and Dean had been dating for nearly four months, far longer than Harry and Ginny had that first spring, and were in the dormitory alone. The full realization came as a detached sort of shock, sweeping over him slowly. He had not thought of her for weeks now, not since Christmas even, where before swift memories of her nimble fingers or her mischievous smile would come unbidden. But the thought of her, in
Demelza got first pick, Malfoy second, Harry third, Owen fourth. To Harry's shock, Demelza immediately shouted, 'Ginny Weasley, Chaser!' She gave Harry a wink as Ginny trotted up to them.
'Of course not,' Andromeda said, hurrying past Harry to greet the other woman. 'You're always welcome here. Oh, I've missed you!'
Malfoy shrugged a shoulder. 'She loves it. She has enough Slytherin pride for the entire House. She turned all her clothes green and everything. Not a bad girl, really.'
But what the Room of Requirement had given him was this, so perhaps he had wanted it after all. Harry sat down against the wall with a sigh and stared across the empty, endless floor, now burned black.
'I'll tell you someday,' he said wearily. 'Anyway, what Remus said, he told me he was trying to make a world in which Teddy could live a happier life. That's what I meant.'
‘It’s better with you,’ he tells Ginny, because he doesn’t know what else to say. ‘It’s different.’ So different he could never even begin to compare them.
A sudden thought of the prophecy flashed in Harry's mind, and he frowned. Kill or be killed. Survive or die trying.
Harry opened his mouth, but he could not think of a good reason Malfoy would want to return and shut it again. If he were in Malfoy's position, he wouldn't exactly relish a lonely year in Slytherin with no friends and plenty of enemies.
Draco looked horrified. “Potter,” he said, “I am not going first. Lord knows what kind of disgusting things you have stowed away there.”
Andromeda raised an eyebrow. 'I think Bella liked him best too,' she admitted. 'At least in the early years.'
Harry was already distracted by the posters on the wall, which loudly advertised old matches with snippets of the announcer’s coverage and the roaring of the crowd. He watched the Seeker for the Tornados make a victory lap around the pitch with the Snitch held high in his fist. Next to him, a recording of a recent match was looping, and he absently heard the announcer yelling, “And there goes Perkins for the Arrows—but here comes Falmouth! Looking none too pleased—and it’s a nice save!—And it’s Perkins, Perkins with the Quaffle as the Arrows lead sixty-thirty—“
'I,' Harry said, hollowed out inside. 'It's fine, Ron. She said she wasn't going to wait, I didn't expect anything.'
He arrived at Remus’s rooms in the afternoon to find Draco already waiting there, wearing a familiar sneer. He straightened when Harry got closer.
“I don’t mind if I do,” Dumbledore said pleasantly. He reached into his pocket and withdrew what appeared to be a Quick-Quotes Quill. “Ah, here it is . . . I believe Rita Skeeter introduced me to the use of these handy little things. With some exaggeration, perhaps, but Alastor will just have to accept it . . . Shall we proceed?”
'I don't want anything,' Hermione says evenly.  'I was only saying, you trust him enough to let him stay without the guarantee of Snape.  So I trust him enough to ask him about Portkeys.'
“Mum’ll kill me if I get another P in Transfiguration,” Ron muttered to Harry over the slow snores of the rest of their dorm-mates. “I don’t know how she finds out, but I reckon Ginny. See how
Seamus piped up also, having gained enthusiasm since the few meetings he had attended, to say he still had his Galleon. Several others at the table nodded to say they had also kept it.
'I know you can handle yourself!' Harry shouted. 'You're brilliant at defense and everyone knows your Bat-Bogey Hex is—'
“Oh, you should talk,” Ron snapped back, “you and your precious Anthony are taking them to Scrivenshaft’s, aren’t you?”
Tonks looked shaken at this. Despite himself, Harry felt a pang of guilt stab through him, which only made his anger flare all the more. It would have been better if he’d been wrong about Tonks all along. It would have been better if she had only pretended to like the Aurors, to be friends with Hermione. But she had. She wasn’t some Pureblood woman who joined up to kill Muggles. She was still Tonks, through and through.
The faint light from the party that seems to be going on next door is just enough for Harry to make out the words.  Still, he has to read them twice to make sure he isn't seeing things.
Hermione shrugs.  'I wasn't.  If we want him on our side, we have to get him to want it, too.  You boys, all you think about is violence and humiliation.'
The fireplace. Desperately casting around the room, Harry leapt for it. He had to think quickly. Where could he go? Not Hogwarts. That would only put Hogwarts in danger, and for all he knew, it could be under a full-scale attack. Where, then?
Ginny did not bother responding, instead muttering to Harry, 'I'll make Ron do it, he is Head Boy after all.'
For the first time in weeks, Harry's mind was not on Hermione's and Ron's argument when he entered the common room that night, so for a moment he barely registered the way they were curled up on the couch together.
Harry stepped inside after him, trying to keep the smile off his face, with little success. “Morning, Remus,” he said innocently, shutting the door behind them. It was only breakfast, and it had been a very good Christmas already.
Hermione stares at them for a moment.  As she turns back to the stove, Harry thinks he hears her mutter something like, '
'Your elbow's in my eye,' Harry snapped, and then Malfoy really did put his elbow in Harry's eye, and Harry yelled, 'Ow, Malfoy!'
'Eddie Carmichael was Professor Binns' favorite student, Binns even remembered his name, maybe we could ask him,'  Hermione continues, as if Harry hasn't spoken.  'Or the Grey Lady might know!  If we go to Hogwarts, I'll have to make sure to look out for her.  Orla Quirke said they once had a very stimulating conversation about the magic in the Hogwarts stones.'
'Perfectly,' Harry says, swallowing.  His wrist accidentally brushes the edge of the gate and a searing, cold pain shudders through his whole arm.  He flexes his fingers and they feel stiff, as if he hasn't used them in days.  'Two hours,' he repeats.  'I'll be there.'
'Then she knows what's best for her family,' Hermione said. Her tone was approving. 'Speaking of, how was Malfoy? Did you see him?'
'That we're what?' Malfoy echoed. 'Friendly? In your dreams, Potter. Now if you don't mind, as scintillating as this has been, I have a class to attend.'
Standing there, facing down Draco, both their wands held chest-height and their gazes locking, Harry felt torn between the utter pain of betrayal and his overwhelming fury at it.
'No they aren't,' Hermione insisted. 'We aren't. Mum keeps ringing me, but by the time I answer, she's forgot what she wanted to ask. Sometimes I wake up and I think Ron's arm around me is somebody attacking, and I shove him off before I can wake up properly, which makes him start fighting because he thinks I'm an attacker. Have you seen how many casseroles Molly sends Andromeda?'
“You can’t expect too much from him,” Remus said, setting down his tea. “You can’t go looking at the Slytherins as people you have to convert. Redemption is such a strange idea, like you must transmute someone from one thing into another thing entirely. You’ll find, I think, that Draco is who he is.”
'It wouldn't be difficult,' Scrimgeour says, in a tone that suggests that he is a reasonable man.   'I'd do the talking.  You'd just have to sit next to me.'
“It does that sometimes,” Harry said, beckoning him over. “Does it hurt?” He made the appropriate noises of concern as Draco stuck out his finger imperiously, until he couldn’t help it any longer, and laughed. “Oh, don’t be such a baby. There’s hardly a mark.”
'Don't you dare blame Sirius's death on our not being nice to that little—' Harry begins, just as Ron exclaims, 'Are you mental?  Kreacher hated all of us because we were either blood traitors or had Muggle blood, he wasn't going to change his mind no matter how nice we were—you see how he acts when you talk to him, he still calls you that M word, doesn't he?'
'I was just going to find Parvati, she's been stuck at the library with Hermione for hours catching up on last term's work.'
Hermione flashed him a knowing smile and Ron mimed vomiting behind a tapestry of angry trolls. Harry gave him an answering shove in the back and they went off laughing.
'He's the Minister of Magic!' Hermione interrupted, as if this were all the argument she needed. 'As for you, Harry, don't you remember the last time we all tore off on thestrals to go save someone?'
They stared at one another in the strained silence, dim light streaming in around them, until Harry finally said fiercely, “Yeah. I did.” He reached out and yanked Draco towards him until they collided and Draco gasped in spite of himself, already hardening against Harry’s thigh. Harry said, low, “And here I thought you’d forgotten.”
For some reason, Harry thinks of the way Malfoy had his head in Pansy Parkinson's lap that day on the train, at the beginning of sixth year, and how possessive her fingers looked combing through Malfoy's hair.  Then, he hated the smug, protective smile she wore.
