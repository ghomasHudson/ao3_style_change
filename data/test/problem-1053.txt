I honestly do not care whether or not you think it is my place to say this. You said you would like to get another letter from me, well, here it is. It is hard to miss, though a lot of things seem to be going over your head, Potter, but I am quite passionate about these things.
It’s always been an odd thought for me to be friends with a Slytherin, but… maybe I should have paid more attention to the Sorting Hat when it was trying to promote house unity. If we’d all made more effort at school maybe things would have turned out a bit differently. I can assure you that I won’t be asking for another therapist. I don’t think I’d feel comfortable talking to someone else like this.
“I didn’t murder him! He got poisoned by his ex with some potion he nicked off his wizard brother, hence me getting involved. Kinda fell for the ambiance of the shop while working on the case.”
“Okay.” Harry sniffed again and finally managed to pull Draco properly under the covers again. “I promise I won’t throw you out, Draco Malfoy.”
“They can join us for tea, later,” Narcissa replied. She held out her hand and Scorpius took it, eager to get out of bed. “That would be in two hours, plenty of time for a whole scala of activities.”
She vividly remembered the day she’d entered his room only to find several empty liquor bottles and a close to death son in there. He’d used his father’s favorite whiskey. Not because he wanted to end it, but because once he’d started he couldn’t find it in himself to stop. Everything had become too much to bear and he knew the alcohol could take it all away.
“No, I really liked Ginny. Gender isn’t a problem for me” Harry shrugs “But, after the war, everything was too different. I was too different, and she was too different. Everything was too scrambled, and I love her, but… not like that anymore. During the brief time when we dated, it was like there was no Voldemort, and no war, she was a silver lining. We couldn’t last. If there had never been Voldemort, we’d be right for each other. But we aren’t”
“It would be quiet,” Malfoy answers at last. “And there would be nothing to be regretted. There would be smiles, real smiles, those ones that people give each other because they want to, and not because they have to.”
Harry laughs at Malfoy’s answer, because it really is so like him, and laughs at his almost smirk, and laughs at the fact that they are both seventeen and it’s a Saturday night – and they are both studying in their room, trying to find something to say. Malfoy just stares at him, confused.
“Perhaps I’d think of this. Us.” Harry’s eyes widen “Not because you are that special, Potter, but because this feels like… a second chance.”
How am I supposed to breathe and live every day if you’re not here? How am I supposed to live in a world where the flowers grow with the rain that falls, but that rain and those flowers had never heard your laugh? How am I supposed to hold myself still, and don’t prevent myself from scattering all around myself when I remember that you aren’t here? It hurts me all over to realize that the air that fills my lungs every day comes from a world where you don’t exist.
“The Invisibility Cloak.” Harry replies and he watches as Malfoy’s back twitches and flexes under his pyjama’s shirt. He then shakes his head, he wasn’t supposed to be noticing something like that.
“Well, that shows its allegiance changed, again.” Potter grinned, and Draco said nothing for a while. That meeting had been too strange already.
We were at his house, it was warm, the light was dim but it felt comfortable, I was dirty and cold, he was there clean and warm, and he looked at me. He was so close. His thumb brushed under my eye, it caught a tear, my heart was swelling, he was getting closer…
Out of all the things Draco could have expected Harry to say, this one hadn’t been on the list. It might have been something that passed through his mind in the early days, back when being locked away in the Manor became too much, when he’d still had enough of an attitude to feel sorry for himself.
Revealing your name to me is a big step, but everything should be fine as these matches are made to be most beneficial to you by my superiors. They had a good reason to pick me for you and it does not have to change anything between us, except for that you can now talk more freely.
Draco moved away from Harry when he tried to reach out for him. He wanted nothing more than to be held, to be understood and loved and not judged for something that had never felt like a choice. But becoming a Death Eater had felt like the same non-choice as his later career had been, and he couldn’t expect Harry to forgive him for both. If he showed weakness now and Harry would reject him after getting to know the truth, his departure would just hurt more.
“You don’t have to know, okay?” Neville rubbed slow circles on Draco’s back, hoping he’d calm down soon because he actually felt better, not because he’d force himself to suck it up. “It’s nearly two am, this isn’t the time for discovering the secrets of the universe. It’s time for milky tea, ginger biscuits and some love.”
“You can go to sleep now, alright?” Harry pushed a sweaty strand of hair out of Draco’s face, getting a grateful murmur in reply. It made him smile. “I’ll be here when you wake up. You can just focus on getting better.”
“Um” Harry replies, and then he remembers something “Well, I used to have a crush on Cedric Diggory” Harry admits, pretty sure it’s the wine’s fault. He had never told that to anyone else, not even to Ron and Hermione.
“Ah, one last thing before you leave.” He said when she arrived at the door. “I’m looking for apprentices of wandmaking. If you or anyone that you know could be interested in that, let me know.”
Malfoy studies Harry with his very grey eyes, he keeps catching his lower lip with his teeth and then releasing it slowly, his eyebrows furrowed in concentration.
And we were true friends, and I never thought I’d enjoy being around someone as much as I did with him. Because perhaps I had always loved him, but I loved a thought, I loved a tiny scrap of hope and he was so much more than that. He made me laugh, and he made me love him in a way that I didn’t think was possible. I loved being around him, and I loved how he got me, and everything was so simple. Everything was so natural.
“Do you like being famous, Potter?” He says. Harry takes a while trying to figure out if that had really happened or if it was just his imagination, but as Malfoy raises an eyebrow he realizes that he’d better answer.
Harry took Draco back to his place, since the man didn’t seem able to explain where he lived. That suspicion was confirmed when not soon after arriving, Draco softly began to snore. It was quite possibly the most adorable sound Harry had ever heard, and he did his best to focus on it so his anger at Robards would seep away.
“I recorded myself,” Draco whispered after a very long silence. “Luna advised me to do that, when I feel like I can’t cope. I was doing so well, but yesterday evening…. At least tonight I had the strength to come here.”
“Well I’m still not a teddy bear.” Draco pouted, letting go of Harry’s hand and crossing his arms in front of his chest. “And remember the last time Scorpius got hold of one of Rose’s princess dresses and a jar of glitter?”
He’d finally gotten fed up with him and went on his own. Not that he’d gotten any further than the waiting room so far. Going to see Draco would make it real. In the end he even fell asleep in the waiting room, still no closer to leaving his spot. The longer he waited, the scarier it got. Death wasn’t funny. Jokes about it might be, but death itself, death of a loved one, it was frightening.
“It’s not my fault half of the stuff you say is less than intelligent, Potter,” Draco shot back, carefully avoiding the words
Suddenly, Luna’s serious gaze was replaced by a big smile. She pulled a piece of paper out of her dungarees pocket and handed it to Harry. “He’d love to get his book back, but you can’t send it to him, he’ll have to fetch it himself. I’m sure you can brew him something to make it worth the trip. You always smell so nice, Harry.”
“Are you feeling alright, Draco?” Luna asked when all chatter had died away. “Your energy is quite dark.”
He waited until the nurse left the room, granting them some much-needed privacy, and then he turned to Draco.
Draco laughed, caught by surprise by the sudden change of topic. “Yeah you did. Though you were nothing compared to Hermione. Sometimes I think I can still feel that hit on my face.”
Suddenly there was a smile on Harry’s face and a hand beckoning him to come closer. When Neville sat down, he was surprised to find Harry pull him into a hug, not caring that Draco was already in his lap and might wake up like this.
. But that was exactly the offer Astoria didn’t want him to make, so he didn’t. “I wish there was something I could do.”
She’d left again before either him or Harry could comment on the fact that she saw the pair of them as Scorpius’ dads. Harry clearly wasn’t sure if he could call himself that already, judging by the insecurity in his eyes when Draco looked at him. Draco wasn’t sure yet either, but now that it was said he rather liked the sound of it. “Would you-, I mean, is it okay if-”
It’s time for my apology too, then. I apologise for using that spell against you in sixth year, I apologise for punching you in fifth year and for letting Ron punch you twice during the battle at Hogwarts. I apologise for not shaking your hand in first year. I was too scared that being in Slytherin would make me a bad person - I know now that that’s not the case. I apologise for not making more of an effort to talk to you in that bathroom - I knew something was wrong and I made it worse. I’m so, so sorry for that.
“I know, son.” Mrs Weasley looked up, and to his relief her eyes were dry. “But when you’re old like I am, that’s not an easy thing to realise, or an easy thing to change. I’m afraid my blindness caused your son harm, so I came here to apologise, and to tell you that I am trying to change my ways. The way you treat Scorpius, especially under these circumstances… It showed me there’s a better way, I just wasn’t willing to see it.”
That was surprising, because of course he knew Harry’s heart was bigger and more forgiving than it should be, but he hadn’t guessed a thing about his colleagues. Draco wouldn’t deny having trust and paranoia issues, but he had been so sure that the fellow Healers had been polite to him and nothing more, had been sure that ‘care’ had nothing to do with it. Apparently, he was wrong.
Those early years had been the worst. He’d managed to escape some of it when a dodgy strip club owner noticed he could dance. A less dodgy strip club owner had seen that too, and Draco had optimistically left his old lodgings. Only he found himself back on the streets again after shifts, because he struggled so much to make ends meet. Once caught in the act in the back alley he got fired from his job and was forced to come crawling back to his old place. He didn’t know where else to go. This was the only thing he knew how to do.
“No.” Draco shook his head. It had never played that big a part in any of his relationships. He and Pansy had just shared a bed for a few years. Theo had mostly needed a comforting hug which was often paired with kissing, but nothing else. Draco wasn’t even sure if he could call that a relationship; It had never gotten official. And Astoria was usually too tired for it, which he now knew had been the blood curse awakening.
“Draco, look at me.” Harry suddenly sounded a lot more serious and stern. “Your son is in surgery, he’s getting the best of care and as soon as he gets out of there and wakes up, he’s going to want to see his father. And he doesn’t want to see this father, hyperventilating in a hospital hallway with tears on your face. He’s going to need a rock, and he’ll need
“Thanks.” Harry shot him a small smile, and had nearly turned away when he thought better of it and said, “And Draco, in case you can spare the time, you’d be more than welcome at the Burrow. Or my house, if you’d like. I reckon your son is about as old as my kids. And Molly would love having someone as skinny as you around to feed all her baked goods to. It would help to fill in the gap you know? It’s harder to miss someone when you’re busy.”
as Draco always called it. And Draco was the one to help him with all his classes, going on long and entertaining rants about goblin wars, myths behind the constellations and the beauty of a well brewn potion.
So my advice to you, if your house feels big and lonely, change it. Out with the old, with the memories of those dark days that keep you chained to the past, and in with the new, better present and future. If you have a family home like me, it might help to remember, if your family loved you, then they would want you to be happy. Their history should not be more important than your happiness in their eyes. And if they did not love you? Then sod them, then they do not even deserve to be remembered.
was the one who made that request first. You cannot just steal my question, Potter, that is not how it works. Honestly, you would think the Saviour of the Magical world had more than two brain cells, but maybe I should not have expected that given that fact that you only seem to know a single duelling spell.
At some point, probably around the start of the war, something had permanently broken inside of him. Ever since, it just made no sense to him that anyone believed him to be deserving of good things. It was why he hadn’t taken Dumbledore’s offer that night on top of the astronomy tower, because he’d been scared and so
“You alright there?” Harry frowned when he had to offer more than just moral support to get him out of the Healer’s office.
. That’s it. In and out. In and out. I’m not mad at you, it’s alright. You’re not a horrible parent, or a horrible person. Breathe in, and breathe out. I love you, Scorpius loves you, it’s okay.”
Draco’s heart broke, but he didn’t let that show on his face. Instead he smiled and sat on the edge of the bed, taking the hand Scorpius was offering him and squeezing it. His fingers were icy cold. “Hi, love. How are you feeling?”
“I’m sorry about her. I still haven’t gotten around replacing my friends with decent human beings.” Draco was so
“Dad, why is Uncle Harry crying?” Rose tugged on her dad’s sleeve, trying to get his attention. It was difficult, because her dad was very tall and she was not. All the grown ups were very focussed on the pretty pale man in the bed whose name sounded like Dragon. He reminded her of Snow White, only his hair wasn’t black.
He barely noticed it when Molly guided him out of the room, while Ron took Rose away before the little girl could witness his mental breakdown. And a breakdown it was. Harry simply did not know how to cope with the pain inside. It was like Sirius dying all over again but somehow now it was worse because the tiny spark of hope left in him amplified the pain. He almost wished Draco would just die so he could start grieving, at least he knew how to do that.
having that help. I have been too late before. I am not going to be too late again. It is why I do this whole anonymous letter program. If anonymity is what it takes to get people the help they need then that is how it will be.
“Oh hush, my love.” His mother chuckled as she interrupted him and strode forward into the room, taking a seat at the edge of the bed. “I do hope we can move past some of the pureblood etiquette that has kept our family apart for so long. I think we’ve both found solid enough ground under our feet to let go of some of the rules.”
“Of course you did.” Draco rolled his eyes. Harry’s memory was about as messy as his hair. If he hadn’t had him or Hermione, he would never be on time for anything ever again. “You do realise that I have a job, right?”
“Draco, my sweet darling, have you looked in the mirror in the past few days?” Pansy stared at him over the edge of her sunglasses. “I know you’re quite new to the gay dating scene, but even a tory can tell you’re a catch.”
“That implies that you would be the idiot if I weren’t, and I won’t stand for that, Potter.” Draco knew he was refusing to admit Harry’s point, but he was already such a mess with everything going on that he didn’t need this adding to it. Not that he didn’t feel his heart grow three sizes when Harry said that. “I just hope we’ll keep-, we’ll keep-”
With a soft click, the recording stopped. Neville couldn’t suppress a shudder. He knew Draco found himself horribly useless when his mental health got bad, but those words hadn’t sounded useless. They never did.
Draco sent a glare in Potter’s direction and shifted in his seat, preparing himself for another quick departure. He didn’t come here to have everything that sucked in his life pointed out to him. He could do that perfectly fine on his own, thank you very much.
“Did you have a good lie-in, Draco?” His mother asked as soon as he sat down. Despite the fact that they hadn’t done anything, the question coloured his cheeks pink. He loved his mother to bits but sometimes he wished she were a little less… good at everything. She’d guided her family through two wars on the wrong side and came out alive and more sane than anyone Draco knew, she was in full control of both her body and emotions, and she was insanely smart. Plus, he was quite sure she was a more powerful legilimens than the Dark Lord had ever been, though she’d never admit to that.
“Sorry.” Harry apologised. He even had the decency to look sheepish. “I didn’t really think about it. You just looked so tense, I wanted to make you relax.”
Harry had reached him now and gently pushed his hands away from the buttons. “Please, Draco. Ditch these things. Go back to bed. I’ll join you with breakfast in a moment. I’m sorry I didn’t leave a note or something, I really didn’t mean for you to stress this much.”
again. Though he hadn’t expected his encouraging words to make a very big difference, he had hoped they would steer Draco away from the edge for now. Away from that dark place. It hurt just to think about that not being true. He couldn’t imagine what Draco was
fight to fight. We’re just here to let him sleep and recharge, a therapist is there to dress him for battle, but he’s the only one who can fight this.”
wasting time writing to me). And, no offence to Sphynx cats, but ragdolls are much more beautiful (I spent a lot of time with a cat-loving neighbour when I was younger - oddly enough, these times have contributed bright threads to my tapestry, now that I think of it).
? Why do you care? Why are you making me breakfast?” He took a shaky breath, trying to calm himself down and failing hard. He’d ignored Harry, taken ages to reply to his letters, never made time for him, never did anything
Neville figured it had to be bad if Draco was this upset. Especially since the last few weeks his friend had seemed so happy. He and Harry had finally gotten over themselves and started dating, and as far as Neville could tell, both of his friends were very happy. But the Draco he had in his arms now definitely wasn’t happy.
was he grateful that Harry was still at his side, ready to catch him when he briefly allowed himself to break down and sob into the man’s neck. He clutched at Harry’s back, desperate for something to hold onto, desperate to block his emotions before the flood gates were fully open and he’d turn into a giant mess. Scorpius deserved better than that.
“Draco,” Harry sighed, putting a hand on Draco’s forehead. “You’re burning up. You’re not allowed to work this shift, and that’s an order. I’ll take you home once I’ve told Robbarts you’re sick. Now go take a seat in my chair, and you better have finished off my tea by the time I get back or I’ll be forced to take drastic measures, understood?”
“That’s not entirely true.” Draco could be wrong, but he thought he heard a small smile in Harry’s voice. “I hit you during that quidditch match in fifth year.”
quiet, though Draco didn’t notice, he was too lost in his own thoughts. He’d never said anything like this out loud before. Or at least not to anyone except his therapist. He thought his mother knew, but only because she read him so well.
“Maybe a little,” Draco replied, which coaxed a laugh out of Harry. “But at least we’re both equally messed up. That helps.”
“I’m sorry. I won’t touch you if you don’t want me to.” Harry looked ashen as he sat on the floor next to him. “But if there is anything I can do to help, anything at all, just tell me. Please. I hate seeing you hurt like this. And if this is because of your past, if you’re scared my friends are judging you because of your mark, I can assure you that they don’t. You’ve changed so much, none of them even dislike you right now, even though Ron won’t say that out loud.”
“I’m not thinking too much,” Draco snapped, before catching himself and reigning in his temper. Not that he was angry, he was just a little overwhelmed. “I just… I never thought about that at all. I just never realised that I… that I don’t really care for it.”
But in the end, all that pain and misery did lead him to a good place. It had led him to where he was now. Standing in a bookshop, signing copies of his own children’s books for an orphanage charity, with a very small looking Harry Potter in front of his table.
“Hey, there’s no need to explain, alright?” Neville opened his arms and Draco was in them before he could even blink. “And there’s definitely no need to apologise. You’re always welcome here. Even if I had been asleep, you can always wake me up. I hope you know that.”
“I know, Harry.” Hermione squeezed his arm again, her eyes shining with a mix of understanding and pity. He knew his friends still felt bad for the small neglected kid he once was and he hated it. They weren’t to blame and it was in the past. He’d rather they focused on people who were being mistreated
“You know, we don’t have to have sex, Draco,” Harry said, way too gently for a man who’d just been attacked with a pillow. “I’m quite content to sleep for another hour or so. This bed really is terribly comfortable.”
“That’s what I thought.” Draco once again tugged at Neville’s arm, and soon enough he found himself next to Draco and Harry in his own, now enlarged, bed. Harry was safely plastered against Draco’s chest, not unlike the way small children slept with their stuffed animals. Neville found it rather endearing, though he would never say that out loud.
“Yes. You.” Draco came closer and rested his head on Neville’s shoulder. He looked so exhausted by life that Neville wrapped him up in a hug, scared Draco might not have the energy to stay standing. “You’re not sleeping on the couch.”
He pushed the ice cream away from himself, sinking deeper into the couch. He’d probably fall asleep there, too tired to move even though the couch cushions would fuck with his back.
But Draco refused to listen to Neville when he brought up therapy, sometimes even flat out leaving until exhaustion drove him back. Eventually, Neville stopped asking. Not because he gave up, or because he stopped trying, but because he could see that the reason why Draco didn’t want any help was because it was imbedded in his brain that his nightmares were his own fault, and someone as proud as a Malfoy would never ask for help to fix their own mistakes. The cause of Draco’s problems was exactly the reason why he needed therapy, but also the reason why he refused to go.
“There is.” A smile pulled on her cracked lips. Astoria’s breathing was laboured, shallow, and accompanied by no good noises. They were talking about days now, possibly hours. In all likeliness this was the last conversation he would ever have with her. “Don’t devote your life to raising our son. Be strong for him, help him learn his way in life, but don’t forget yourself. Don’t forget to live. Go find yourself some happiness, love. Find yourself a new life and live it like there’s no tomorrow. That’ll make me smile from up above.”
“It’s really fucking stupid how well we fit together you know?” he eventually said after he finally managed not to melt. “Because we fought for all those years and I still don’t want to like you but you’re making that bloody impossible, you stupid speccy idiot.”
Harry didn’t answer. Or at least he didn’t right away. First he pulled back and turned Draco over so they were looking at each other again. And even then he bent down to kiss him before he spoke. “Draco Lucius Malfoy, I do not understand how anyone could ever dislike you the way you are now. And that includes you.”
The sound of footsteps ended next to his head, but Draco refused to open his eyes, scared to end this audio-only dream. He
“Only when I dress up.” Rose rolled her eyes. Adults could be so slow sometimes. “I meant him.” She pointed at the pretty man in the bed. “He is your princess. Like Snow White, only then with blonde hair. Sleeping Beauty works too, your Dragon is very pretty.”
Draco sighed, a nostalgic smile on his face. They used to do this a lot, back when they shared a dorm during eighth year. “So do I.”
I did not realise how important that was until my father’s love changed from seemingly unconditional to very conditional indeed. I will not mention what he has done, but to put it mildly, I would not lift a finger to keep him out of danger now, had he still been alive.
“Teddy, stop it.” Victoire halted, turned around and nearly made him collide with her. “I can see you fretting and beating yourself up about this and you shouldn’t. Whatever is going to happen to Draco… It will happen anyway. I wish there was something we could do, but there isn’t, so there’s no use in beating yourself up about taking a few minutes longer to go by bus. Besides, with your flying skills the bus will probably be quicker than going on a broom anyway. Not to mention warmer.”
Scorpius was already almost asleep while Draco brushed his teeth for him, something he did the Muggle way because Scorp hated the charms, so he carried him from the bathroom to the bed. Once tucked in Draco proceeded to sing a French lullaby his mother had taught him once. He knew his son was already asleep and probably didn't hear him, but it was tradition so he went with it.
Draco nodded and looked up. He felt his parental side take over, felt the tremor in his hands disappear. It was true, what Harry said. Scorpius needed him. He’d already lost his mother, had already been traumatized by too many prodding Healers before, and now everything was happening again.
“Oh god that was a marvelous day.” Harry snickered. “But I must say you looked quite good covered in glitter. And you did an excellent job convincing Scorpius to get rid of the dress and put on his pyjamas. I would call that fabulous parenting, not disaster parenting.”
“We had these parties when I was a kid. All the traditionalists in my father’s books came there. Hallow’s Eve, stories of ancient rites, death, chasing away evil spirits that turned into a muggle hunt. A contrast as stark as possible against what muggles call Halloween. My father and everyone else got drunk on wine and the power their families used to have, and then they got angry about having lost it. A mourning of the good old days.”
I do not know how much this analogy will speak to you, but it helped change my view on life, and it helped me realise that by moving on, my friends were not turning a page, leaving me to gather dust on a shelf. They are your friends for a reason, they want you in their lives, and odds are, they’ve run out of dark threads quite some time ago and are dying to add some colour, not just to their own story, but to yours.
His eyes darted across the old surface and he realized something. He really couldn’t do this alone anymore, he needed help. Of course, Snape had been offering him a lot of help lately but he only wanted to steal Draco’s glory. He wouldn’t offer Draco a way out, and maybe that was the help he needed. He could find his way through the mess of Room of Requirement, but he couldn’t see the way out of the mess that was his life.
Harry takes a while to answer back, but he knows that Malfoy is also hanging on to the silence he left. He has to answer how would his perfect day be, but he thought that Malfoy had already answered that for him.
“Friendship always meant people that had to laugh of my jokes and that were a bit afraid of me.” Malfoy says right after Harry finishes “It never felt enough.”
“I used to want to be a metamorphomagus,” Harry remembers. “So people won’t recognize me sometimes.”
Draco Malfoy, he could understand why. Garrick had been locked up in his cellar for months, but Draco had never been cruel to him. Scared eyes, brought him trays of food with generous portions and warming charms. Garrick knew that the Dark Lord was forcing Draco to use his wand to torture, but their cores could not be corrupted. He saw Draco grow thinner and weaker. One could lie to their family about their true nature, but could not lie to their wandmaker.
Harry doesn’t say anything, but follows Malfoy’s gaze. He suddenly realizes that Malfoy is wearing bright blue socks with yellow stripes, and they call out even more attention because Malfoy is wearing all black. Like he always does.
I dance around my room and I put my hands  on my own shoulders and I pretend that that’s you there, dancing with me, you run your fingers through my hair and I feel myself blushing. You touch my lips, and my closed eyes see how your green eyes lock with mine and they see how you smile. I always open my eyes eventually and when I do, all I see is the empty space inside my arms where you should be.
“I like to hear that.” Draco says, his eyes sparkling. Harry smiles. “Now, this touching honest moment is over.” He adds sharply, and Harry lets go of his hand.
“I don’t want to be an Auror.” Harry blurted over their argument. It was true, he had been thinking about that for a long time, but had never told his friends.
Potter was sitting in a corner table. Draco’s breath stopped for a second when he laid eyes on the familiar mop of dark hair.
With the wand firmly in his hand, Draco knew that that was time for him to do something he had meant to do for a long time.
You don’t exist anymore in this world. Everything around me is a void because nothing remembers you quite like I do, nothing has you anymore. Your picture is just a faint memory, and it mimics your smile and your eyes but it doesn’t have you in it anymore. You aren’t here. You aren’t here with me.
“I need a new wand. Mine was lost in the…” Her eyes were cautious. “Malfoy Manor. I have been waiting to see if the Ministry could retrieve it, but it broke. It appears that Bellatrix Lestrange tried to use it, but it broke off the first curse she tried to cast.”
That’s when Draco kisses him. His fingers gripping tightly on Harry’s shirt again, Harry brings him closer, their tongues meet, he can feel Draco’s tears on his cheek, and they are somewhere else. Yes, there is pain there. They still have the scars of a war they were too young to enter, they still have a past weighing on them, but that doesn’t seem to matter. They are together, and this is what matters. Having each other is what matters.
“You should play Quidditch!” Ron exclaimed. “I hear the Chuddley Cannons are holding tryouts for Seeker, they could at least have a little chance.”
He borrowed his mother’s wand the next day, hoping that he never had to do that again. The weather was a little chilly, he apparated in the windy hills next to the Manor.
They don’t speak again during that day, Harry reasons that he had scared Malfoy off by almost admitting that he had been watching him. In the next day, Harry decides it was his turn to ask a question and that was what he does when Draco is reading a book on the couch and Harry is finishing his Charms work.
so, it's finally complete! thanks for waiting this long, and i hope you all liked it. kudos and comments are always appreciated <3
“I really hope there isn’t another war, mother.” Draco replied. He knew she was just venting, there wasn’t so much to do those days. They were not imprisoned, but still it was weird to get out of the house. Many people weren’t as generous as Potter in their judgement.
The third smell surprised Draco. It was soap, but not an expensive soap like everyone in Slytherin used. It smelled like a cheap, common soap. He didn’t know anyone who would dare to use that kind of thing, he must have had screwed up the potion.
Harry would have thought that sharing a room with Draco Malfoy would be a nightmare, but it is nothing like that. The other boy is quiet and keeps his things neat – and never complains about the fact that Harry doesn’t. He doesn’t bother Harry with anything other than normal questions, like asking if he had done his Transfiguration work or if he has a spare quill to lend.
“Malfoy, good!” Potter replied, and his eyes were almost friendly. That surely was a look that Draco had never seen in Potter’s face, not directed to him at least.
Potter sighed and put his both arms around Draco and squeezed tightly. Draco held on more strongly to Potter, and the room was so silent that he could hear the other boy’s heartbeats. Draco started matching his breath with Potter’s. He closed his eyes, and his ears were only paying attention to Potter’s heartbeat, his lungs were only paying attention to Potter’s breath. And Draco felt calm.
. Life had been ripped away from you when you were too young, but even if it weren’t, it would be too early. You should have never gone away from here, you should have never left me with nothing more than your face printed on my brain.
Malfoy blinks his eyes and looks terrified when his eyes focus and he realizes that Harry is the one shaking him.
You were like a fluttered dream on my wildest fantasies, you and your sharp green eyes. You looked at me and I felt like I was trapped in the middle of a storm, but I never wanted it to stop raining. I never wanted you to leave me in the piercing drizzle that never stopped falling since you left.
You are born already with the start of a tale, a history from your family, from your parents and those that came before, and each memory, each event, every person in your life, all your emotions, they add a thread. Some threads are dark, some are almost as white as the blank background, some shine in the night, some are green like a forest in spring.
The worst thing was that he knew this horrid combination of being an intern while following classes and taking exams would continue for another three months. He needed more rest, more sleep, more days off and less pressure, but he wouldn’t get any of that and honestly he just didn’t fucking care anymore.
Now that we have the legalities out of the way, Potter, you idiot. I have made sure that the therapy side of your last letter landed on the desk of the colleague who will now oversee your correspondence. It did not sound like very light matter to me, which is why, as an I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-I-am-to-you, I am telling you now that the stupidly old age of twenty nine is way too late to be seeing your first therapist.
“Sure we are, love.” Harry smiled down at Draco before kissing his forehead, and Neville had to look away. The moment felt too intimate to witness. “We’re just as mean as you are, you big softie.”
“I’ll remember to ask if I can snog her husband next time I see Hermione.” Harry put the other bag on the floor and grabbed Draco’s hand. He didn’t do anything else though. What he did do was tilt his head and look at Draco thoughtfully for a moment. “Is it okay if I pull you onto the chair with me?”
It's short and not beta read because I typed it on my mothers mini laptop which is absolute shite for writing (I cannot even select more than a paragraph at a time. copy pasting this to ao3 was hell), but this is gonna be my only moment to write for a long time to come so its this or nothing
Luna gave a secretive smile and gestured to a cosy looking booth at the back of the cafe. “He will, I’m sure.”
“Stop making it so easy to wind you up, then,” Draco chuckled, and popped the piece of cake into his mouth. “This is high quality free entertainment, Potter. No student worth their brain cells would pass that up.”
“Hey! Wow wow wow wow, what do you think you’re doing?” Harry was out of his chair before Draco even seemed to know someone was talking to him. “You look like death. What on earth are you doing here? Get back in bed! Or better still, go to the hospital.”
He hadn’t, though, because no matter his cold exterior, Draco was nothing if not loyal and concerned about his friends. She distinctly remembered waking up in the maternity ward with Ron in the other room looking after their newborn together with Harry, while Draco sat right next to her, knitting away like he was giving Molly a run for her money. Draco couldn’t knit when he was stressed, his hands shook too much, which meant Hermione didn’t even have to ask about her child. The tapping of Draco’s knitting needles told her enough, which was probably exactly why Draco had been doing it.
“Well maybe that’s because wherever you go people get called out on their bullshit. Their quiet resentments, inability to apologise, lingering racism. And no matter how shit you feel about yourself, it’s never so bad that you don’t challenge people to debates when it’s needed. That’s something to be proud of, not something to feel ashamed about.”
As for the empty house, I have some experience with that. I live in an old family home, one that we only used during holidays which we only took before the war. It was never tainted by war trauma that way, but I still found myself dreading the empty hallways and old portraits as I recovered from my depression.
“Don’t you dare!” Draco snapped, rolling them over until he was right on top of Harry, glaring down at his stupid happy face. “Don’t you dare Harry James Potter or I swear I will-, I will-”
also on an extra note, if there is a character whose pov you miss or whose pov you want to see again, please tell me so in the comments! I can't guarantee anything, but maybe I'll be inspired by you!
Draco hadn’t known that at first, but once he caught on there was nothing he could do except beg the Healers to be gentle. His last name didn’t help grant his wishes, but refusing Scorpius his treatment would mean the death of his only son. There was nothing he could do but stand by and watch.
to write them down. Talking to a pet has never seemed silly to me either. Sometimes I used to think the only sensible conversation I got was with my owl. Certainly better than talking to a rubber duck - at least my owl reacted to my words!
pockets, especially not in the beginning, but at least he’d been warm and somewhat well fed. Not safe though. Never safe. Men were animals, and Draco didn’t understand how he still managed to fancy them. It was as if you lost your humanity once you were paid goods. Not a person, but a doll.
It will not change the truly dark parts, but bit by bit, what first seemed like a big black hole, will start to get some patches of grey, and here and there maybe even a dash of pink. The way you experience life and your past right now, the way you see your future, is not set in stone. It is a marvellous story filled with so many details it would take multiple lifetimes to have a look at it all and yet you experience all of that in just one life.
Wow. I thought I would have trouble with opening up to a stranger, but I think that it actually helps that I don’t know who you are. I’m sorry if that doesn’t make sense. I just wrote as I was thinking about it.
“I would just like to have what you have sometimes. That dive-in head first carelessness, not worrying all the time, having a supportive ex-wife, and a giant circle of family and friends to fall back on. Though I might just have ruined the latter a bit for you.”
Rose was ecstatic. Uncle Harry was smiling again. She hopped off his lap so Uncle Harry could sit on the bed. He looked very serious and focussed, which was all wrong if you asked her. The most magical kisses were gentle and light. Like the ones her dad gave her mum after a long day of hard work in the kitchen.
Of course emotions do not easily listen to reason, but you can shape them to be more useful to you. Take that anger and put it in a fiery speech to change people’s minds, instead of using it to defend those who were hurt with force, as that will only lead them and you into deeper trouble. Use the anger not to yank at the branches, but stick a spade in the roots.
I am, as of two days ago, officially no longer your therapist. I am also strictly speaking not allowed to contact you anymore, but given that our first contact did not originate from this therapy program, my supervisors have given me the green light to send you this. However, even though you did not sound like you would in your last letter, you are allowed to request a complete cease of communication to which I will abide without question.
I had, I wanted to pour my love all over you, but it didn’t work. It wasn’t you anymore and that tore me inside, because the smell I was feeling was only of ash and death and that wasn’t you anymore and those numb arms weren’t yours, those eyes weren’t yours, and you weren’t there.
“The first one, obviously.” Malfoy answers and he almost smirks. “I would like to keep my body young, fresh and beautiful as it is, thank you very much.”
It is Saturday night and they are both buried in books, the N.E.W.T. year is really exhausting. Harry keeps trying to find something to say, but his head feels empty and he always runs out of words when he stares at that silver-blonde head.
He had no family left. Would the tradition of the Ollivander family would die out with him? He couldn’t let that happen. He needed an apprentice. An heir. Someone to carry out with his work, his family’s work, when his time came.
Malfoy narrows his eyes and leaves before saying another word, and Harry forgot to tell him that the Cloak belonged to his father and Malfoy better take care of it, but he realizes that he doesn’t have to. Of course he will.
Then Potter raised his hand. At first, Draco thought he would slap him, but it turned out that Potter was actually just placing a tentative hand on his shoulder. It was pathetic, and Draco’s body jerked suddenly. His eyes met Potter’s and suddenly Draco flung himself on the other boy’s arms, his head reminding him that it wasn’t real, Potter wasn’t real, he had nothing to worry about.
When I first saw you dead I wanted to run faster and further as I could, but I couldn’t. My feet were anchors and they were pulling me down, dragging me to the ground, I lost all my strength and I had no energy to collapse. I didn’t want to see your body anymore, I didn’t want it to pollute my brain and I didn’t want to forget how you looked like when there was life inside of you.
“Yes.” Harry says, but he feels like he is fishing compliments, when he is actually curious. Probably.
“I… I don’t know.” Harry answers. “I’m usually not. It’s just that I’m not embarrassed. Some feelings I don’t want to hide.”
“I have been wondering…” Hermione started during dinner. Harry knew what she would ask, for she had been asking that question every day since they got the Hogwarts letter telling them that the school would reopen and would take all the students that wished to complete their education.
Potter stood still for a moment, but then he sort of patted Draco on the back and it was so unnerving that Draco started hitting him with his fists, but with his head was still buried on Potter’s neck and that was so stupid and Draco was feeling so tired and so drawn out of energy that he started sobbing.
Garrick had cleaned up his shop, burned the broken wands that were left behind – for it was too dangerous to have broken wands around – and resumed his wandmaking and thorough study of wands. With the war many wizards and witches had lost their wands and wanted new ones. Business was good and he had many wands still in stock, but something troubled him.
“Though I disagree with the latter, Potter,” Malfoy smirks “I would agree that you were probably the problem. You usually are.”
He thought of replying that they had house-elves to tend the gardens, but he knew his mother had not much to do these days. With a sigh, he handed her the wand and went back to ponder about Potter’s note.
“If only you could use Lucius wand…” She said bitterly. “But even his wand that horrible man managed to destroy. Next time there’s a war, we are staying with the people who don’t torture their allies.”
“Fine.” Harry says and by the tone of his voice it’s obvious that he doesn’t think it’s fine at all, he understands but he feels irritated either way and before he can think, he leaves Draco eating breakfast by himself, and goes outside to catch some air.
He had already testified on the Malfoy’s trial, and was probably the only reason why Draco and Narcissa weren’t rotting on Azkaban. He did even try to get Lucius Malfoy out, but it wasn’t enough.
“He said so when I went there to get my new wand.” She replied. “But still, Harry, I think you should consider going back to Hogwarts.”
“Draco…” He says cautiously. The other boy turns around, his eyes puffy and red, his hand clutching a piece of parchment. “What happened?”
Some people deal with the dead like they were slowly drifting away from them, and that makes the wounds heal, their tears dry. But it was never like that with me, because when I saw that you weren’t there anymore the universe sucked everything from all around me, you had left, you were suddenly gone and I knew that you’d never be back again. I knew that that bit of my heart that had been taken away in such a brutal way would never return, it would never be replaced by anything else.
“Oh...” Malfoy looks down, “I would want to… see how the N.E.W.T.s are going to be. I mean, what they will ask.”
But standing in the front of his empty cauldron was a boy with messy jet black hair. Potter. Of course it would be bloody Potter.
Malfoy’s laugh echoes through the room and it’s so alive and Harry cannot see his face because he is on the couch as Malfoy reads on his bed but it doesn’t matter – Harry can picture his face laughing and the tiny wrinkles that appeared around his eyes, and that dimple on his right cheek that Harry knew he would completely deny that it exists.
He shouldn’t think of Voldemort again, though, he was doing this to get his mind out of his inevitable failure, and brewing potions had always been something that relaxed him. Clear instructions to follow, he was confident enough to bend a few of them but he knew what path to take, it was clear and he knew exactly what was supposed to happen next –unlike his life.
You are everywhere for me now. I cannot feel any smell wondering if that isn’t your smell, because I never knew what it was. I wonder if you’d like what I hear, I know you wouldn’t like what I say. I don’t know which sights you’d love, or which ones you’d hate but you’re not there to tell me. So I make them up, and I make your voice up because I can never remember it just right. I talk to you when I’m alone and when I’m surrounded by people, but my brain can never mimic the exact amount of warmness and roughness that it had.
“Yes…” Harry says. “But I long for the day when it will be okay.” They don’t say anything else, just stay there, the warm winter sun tickling their faces.
“Friends, Potter?” While stretching out my hand, and I knew that if he refused it I’d crumble down, but I wanted that chance, and his brows were furrowed while he stared at my hand but soon enough it turned into a smile and when he shook my hand, I thought I’d leak from my fingertips.
Draco Malfoy, a hawthorn wand. Hawthorn, good with curses, the wand of a killer… or a healer. Unicorn hair core, the hardest to turn to the Dark Arts. If he hadn’t been Lucius Malfoy son, who would he be? What would he stand for? Would he ever raise his wand to lay a curse?
Harry had been watching him, trying to understand him in the last month. He doesn’t know why, but there is something odd about a Malfoy that doesn’t like to boost out his own name and how wonderful he and his family are all the time. Harry realizes that when Malfoy stopped talking, somehow his actions grew louder and he seemed different somehow. Like he had never been that bad.
“Draco, I am so sorry.” Harry whispers, and the truth is that he never liked Lucius, but he is Draco’s father, and Draco is crying, so why wouldn’t he care? “Is there anything I can do?”
“When Voldemort told me to kill Dumbledore,” Malfoy says “He gave me one year to do it. He said he was being merciful. I didn’t agree.” He takes one more sip of the bottle, seeming very tipsy now “I, in my complete panic, imagined I had one year left to live only, and I could either enjoy it as I wanted, or try to dread it, by attempting to kill Dumbledore. He spared me in the end, obviously. But during that year, I couldn’t stop thinking of what I would have done if I had chosen just to enjoy it thoroughly.”
“Tell me something you have dreamed of doing for a long time but have never done it.” Harry asks before Malfoy can say anything.
“I think… it’s not allowing more friends to die.” Harry breathed out “But I really wanted to say that it was winning the Quidditch Cup in the third year.”
“Friendship was something that I always wanted, because Dudley didn’t let anyone be my friend. And when I finally got it, I couldn’t let go.” Harry answers “Friendship is like being a part of something. Something special. And you are at home with them, even if you are far away from home. Even if you don’t have one.”
“It’s your turn to ask a question, Malfoy.” Harry says in the next day when he is absolutely bored and Malfoy is reading.
Harry realizes that he and Malfoy have three things in common. First of all, they eat the crust of the bread before eating the whole bread, but Malfoy prefers strawberry jelly when Harry’s favourite one is blueberry. Malfoy is also better at Charms than Transfiguration, Harry notices how he goes through all his Transfiguration work at least twice but finishes his Charms papers quickly and doesn’t take a second glance at them. He likes the second The Weird Sister’s record better than the others, like Harry. His favourite song is the one that Harry used to like the least, though, but from hearing it with Malfoy’s voice so many times, Harry starts to like it a lot.
Draco started breathing heavily. Potter shouldn’t be here, how did he get in? How did he even know that Draco was here, anyway? And then it hit Draco. He had asked for help, and the Room always provided him with whatever he wanted. Potter there was probably the twisted idea that the Room had of help, it was an illusion.
He takes Draco by the hand back to their room. It’s cold inside, he had forgotten the window open. He closes it and goes towards the fireplace to lighten it, and when he turns his back he sees that Draco joined their beds together. He meets a smirk on Draco’s face and sits by his side, under the blankets. He feels warm hands finding his, Draco gets closer, resting his head on Harry’s chest.
“Why do you still call him You Know Who?” Hermione narrowed her eyes. “He’s gone. You can call him Voldemort, you know.”
“What?” Harry mumbles back, tuning his eyes to Draco, who is completely unfocused. His glasses had fallen down on his robe, he picks them up and looks at the other boy intensively.
“Potter, you aren’t real. The room just made you up because I asked for help, so it tried to give me you.” Potter narrowed his eyes. This was annoying, they should just keep kissing. Then, Potter laughed.
The shoppers were a cheery lot, there were children everywhere, packing the street with their freshly bought robes and books. Hogwarts’ term would start soon, and he still didn’t know if he would go back. Sure, he wanted to finish his education, but he couldn’t stand more people avoiding and shooting him concerned glances everywhere he went.
I lost the track of days as he didn’t show up there anymore. I started wondering if he wasn’t just an illusion. I wanted to get my old picture of him back. I didn’t want to forget, but the lines that form his face were starting to get blurry and I couldn’t forget about him. Not him.
He hears a shuffling behind him and turns around to find Draco facing him. He looks oddly fidgety, his eyes are wide but staring at Harry.
At first, Malfoy doesn’t answer, but his breath grows quicker and Harry can’t hear the frenetic page-turning anymore.
“Would you really let me try your Invisibility Cloak?” Malfoy turns his head. His eyes look like hurricanes.
Hands that weren’t his grabbed my arm and took me somewhere else. Everything was dark, and it smelled rotten, and I wondered if I’d die then. Alone and cold like a hungry child, desperately grovelling, so small, so small…
Potter studied him and stood silent. The Room didn’t know how to mimic someone’s personality very well, because the real Potter would have never shut up.
They get closer, and they are too drunk, and then Draco make’s a small, whimpering sound. He rests his head on the crook of Harry’s neck, Harry lays back, the blanket is tangled between their legs, and they fall asleep.
I remember how I thought that I would have traded places with you anytime, because I am selfish and I would rather be dead than to feel that you aren’t here anymore. I would rather let people feel the pain of my death than to let myself feel the pain of yours, and I would rather let the world turn without me than without you.
“You haven’t answered your own question yesterday, Draco.” Harry reminds him in the next day when they are eating a very late breakfast.
“I’d pick you.” Harry answers without a second thought, and Draco widens his eyes and looks away. He does that a lot, looking away – and Harry grunts. He didn’t realize what that could mean, he thinks that maybe Draco is thinking that Harry asked him on a date, but it wasn’t that. If he could choose anyone in the world to spend time with, he would choose Draco. He doesn’t know why.
But it’s all that I have left, and I keep a picture of you that I cut out from a newspaper inside my pocket because it makes me feel safe, like you’re lingering all over my life. I feel you hanging on every silence and I see your smile everywhere. I know every line and every shape that forms your smile by heart, but I also know how much I wanted to have that smile to me, but never did. I love the dimples you had on your right cheek and that crooked front tooth. I love how your eyes sparkled when you smiled.
But I couldn’t take it anymore after a few hours and I broke in the room where they were keeping your corpse and I stayed there with you. I broke down, my head lowered on your chest, my hands grabbed you strongly but I didn’t have any more hope that you would open your eyes anymore. I held you with
Harry unwraps his arms from Draco’s shoulders, and uses his hands to wipe the tears from Draco’s eyes. They look at each other, and Harry’s eyes are met with cold grey eyes, framed by sharp light eyebrows. Draco’s nose is too angled, so is his chin and cheekbones. He looks too sharp, too angry, cold and distant. But he isn’t. He is so close, and Harry’s eyes can see how Draco’s features can be softened when you realize that Draco isn’t like that at all. He has a soft smile, and you can see his eyes sparking. Just like the sun coming out of the clouds after a storm.
I talked to your bones, when I went to see your grave. Surprisingly no one else had come to visit you that day, so it was just me and you. It felt like a personal birthday gift, and I felt like you were the one who would have arranged that. Your bones didn’t reply, but they didn’t need to. I didn’t want to hear anything from what they had to say, because being around something that had your life around it once… that was enough.
He looks away and they don’t talk during that day anymore, but Harry smiles when he sees that Malfoy has given him a present. A bright orange overall. There is no note, but Harry notices how Malfoy’s breath is uneven when he opens the package, and he knows it.
When he came back with Cedric’s body on his arms and telling that the Dark Lord had risen again, I held my breath, I knew what was waiting for me when I came home. I tried to warn him, I tried to get him back, to get him to me again, but of course he refused. That’s how it was supposed to be, everything about him made it impossible for him to ever want me – and still, I loved him. For every single thing that he was.
“Pick someone in the world to have dinner with.” Harry asks one day, realizing that he was missing their weird question time.
“For me? Well, I’m not sure, Mr Ollivander. I’m still figuring things out.” Draco said bewilderedly.
Harry wakes up in the next day with his head throbbing and Draco’s head on his chest, his hand gripping the fabric of his shirt. The sun probably has just risen, their window is open and it is very cold inside their room, the fire has gone out. Careful not to disturb Draco, Harry grabs his wand and closes the window, the curtains, and turns the fire back on. With his mind half-asleep already, he snuggles closer to Draco, not finding his touch foreign or strange, and before he can think, his lids are shut and he has fallen asleep once again.
“One: I have never fallen in love. Two: I have fallen in love before, but I have gotten over it. Three: I think I might be in love right now.” His eyes are glistening, he looks a bit mad. Harry doesn’t know what to say.
“I’ve also got plenty of those.” Harry replies “But I think it would be Sirius dying. I thought he had make it, at first, he couldn’t be dead, and then when it dawned on me… I…” He shuts his eyes “He was… like a father figure. Something I had always wanted.”
And Harry Potter, that intrigued him. He had seen Potter in the Diagon Alley a few times. Helping George Weasley with the shop he, now, ran alone. He had not sought Ollivander for a new one… perhaps the hawthorn wand was working well for him. Which was unusual as well, considering its previous owner.
Malfoy laughs and his laugh takes the whole room, it’s full and real but it only lasts a few seconds, because then he goes back to his book. Harry smiles to himself and they keep living on that ideal quietness.
“No, Potter, there isn’t anything The Boy Who Lived can do.” Draco replies coldly, getting his head up to stare at him. “You never liked him, my father.”
“I like my eyes, because they are what I have from my mother, my Patronus, because of my father and… I guess I like my Quidditch skills.” Harry answers, and Draco still has that mad look glistening inside his eyes.
He feels something on his shoulder, and he opens his eyes to see that it’s Malfoy’s hand. His gaze is deep, understanding, accepting.
“Thank you.” Draco said timidly, reaching out to get his wand back. When the wand passed over from Potter’s grip to Draco’s, he felt a tingle of electricity in his hand.
“Because…” Harry starts, but it seems so hard to say it, even though it’s true. Draco is so close, his eyes filled with tears, his thin body shaking, and Harry knows it. “Because
He turned his back to the cauldron, running his fingers through his hair tiredly. His eyes had travelled all through the scattering of things in the Room of Requirement already and those things didn’t impress Draco anymore. They made him feel suffocated, piles and piles of memories and things that mattered once but didn’t anymore, and they would fall all over him when he too became a thing that didn’t matter anymore.
But I didn’t die, and sometimes I wish I had died, when I saw him with the Weasley girl. I wanted that smile to be mine, and those hands, I wanted them with me, and I was alive but what for? I’d die soon enough and I wouldn’t have his hand on my arm anymore, and I was desperate, but then things eventually worked out.
Ollivander gave a small smile. “I should think so.” She looked curiously at him. “Wands are loyal to their owners. They can be won, yes, but there is a part of the previous owner that lives inside the wand. I believe that since you, Miss Granger, could never curse someone if Bellatrix Lestrange commanded to you, your wand refused to do so as well. Not very common, I know, but seeing as she had previously tortured you… I cannot see how your wand could work for her.”
Then, fire. I thought it would swallow me up, I thought I would die there and we’d all die there but he came around and he saved me and I had him in my arms finally, but it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t like that. I held him tight and I held tight to that moment, I didn’t want to let him go but I knew I should do as soon as possible because if I didn’t I might never let go.
When Harry wakes up in the next morning, he finds Draco’s bed empty. Their room is cold, the window is left open, and there is an envelope ripped apart on Draco’s bed. Harry picks it up and reads that it’s from Draco’s mother – but the letter is nowhere to be seen.
Harry likes Malfoy’s skin. The soft texture of it. It was warmer than he would have expected from someone with the cold demeanour that Malfoy has, but then again, so is everything else about him. He also loves his eyes, piercing, melting grey, that enveloped Harry as a whole. Malfoy is very smart, too, and he’s sharp in knowledge as he is when arguing with Harry – he’s impatient, and reckless, and explains everything a little too fast, information too scrambled, but Harry loves it because he can understand every single part of it. He loves Malfoy’s voice, it’s smooth when he wants to get what he wants, and hoarse when he doesn’t appear to care. Like the whole of Malfoy’s personality, it’s dual, everything about the boy seems to have two completely sides of it, but it all comes together in a way that makes sense. Harry loves how he gets Malfoy. After all those years of hating each other, all they needed was a shared room, and a truce, and suddenly- suddenly Harry was able to pick all the pieces of information he had collected about Malfoy through the years and place them together. He really likes how they look placed together.
I think I made my tapestry sound more bleak than it is really. It’s definitely dark at the beginning. My years before Hogwarts were miserable, losing my parents is something I can’t really remember, of course, but living with my aunt and uncle wasn’t a happy time. Being beat up by my cousin happened regularly, my aunt and uncle couldn’t have cared less and usually blamed me for it all. It was lucky that I could outrun Dudley if I had the chance, he couldn’t catch me on foot and neither could his friends. My time at Hogwarts is certainly the brightest part of my tapestry - almost every day spent there was enjoyable. Fifth year was a bit duller, I suppose, but still not as dark as the times spent in my aunt and uncle’s house. Sixth and seventh year were darker still, but there were bright spots in there - put there by my friends. I know that whenever I spend time with them, they’re adding more bright threads, so no worries there. I am going to fire call them as soon as I’ve finished writing this letter to ask them over for dinner - and I’ll mention redecorating the house too.
“Decent enough to tell you my name then. That friend of yours, I mean.” Harry put his hand through his hair, messing it up even more. Draco wished he could do that for him. Give him a legit just-fucked look, instead of a naturally tousled mess. Just when his mind began to drift off to places where it really shouldn’t be yet, the band saved him by starting a good, up beat song. “Wanna dance?”
“Maybe she’ll be more susceptible if you offer now.” Draco chewed his bottom lip as he eyed the kitchen. Lily had attached herself to Harry’s leg while James was trying to help him cook and Albus read the recipe. “It’s been a while since… you know.”
“Good morning, Scorpius.” Narcissa ignored his outcry and greeted her grandchild instead. “It’s snowing in our winter greenhouse. Would you like to pop on that new coat you got for Christmas and take a walk there together? We can have scones with jam and butter at the end as breakfast.”
