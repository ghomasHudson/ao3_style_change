Ron didn’t know what to say. He never did with Harry either, he joined Blaise, taking a deep drink. He wanted Hermione to say something. She always knew what to say, but she didn’t need to this time.
Clara patted Rey’s knee, as he hunched into the beanbag. “Mandy don’t.”
Rey looked up from his book to remark, but he forgot what he was going to say when he saw who was approaching their table. “Hey, hey.”
“Minerva, you’ve taught the lad, what are your thoughts?”
Molly scowled. They had meant to do this to Harry the whole time. They had planned for this. They were just adding the Malfoy boy due to the new information. She would be having some stern words the next time she saw the Minister. He nodded at her in recognition but was a peace with his decision.
“Right,” Hermione’s laughter slowed, “Harry and Malfoy said they will be joining us for 8
“Enough Ben.” Harry turned to see a man with two more girls and another boy, “Take your seat Ben.” The man stopped next to them. Harry glanced up at him. He had gray streaking through his brown hair and beard. He seemed kind, even while he was glaring at Ben.
Further down the same table, Hermione, who had never thought of Neville that way, paused and took note of Neville’s tall and toned profile.
“Oi, you two,” Ron called out, mock anger ringing over the conversations.
“Good,” thankfully the pat was lighter this time around and Harry could keep his feet. The Minister leaned towards them with a twinkle in his eye and sensing something was being divulged they moved in. “Make sure to be back early from lunch. You’ll want to be here before the place fills up and they start turning people away.”
Draco shrugged. “I don’t really remember. I think it was worthless. I only played with it when father asked.” Draco picked a black marker, “I don’t think it was a real game.”
year?” Pansy asked.
Violet closed her eyes. “Oh my god…oh my god. So they’re not just famous wizards with a drug addiction.”
“You’re welcome,” Minerva replied. This woman controlled their access to Harry and Draco, of course she made time for her. She hoped it was good news. Tawy started by asking about their plans for the 8
“But not that,” Ben spoke up, “not after what he said in group.”
Harry glanced at the deep emerald imbedded into black metal around Draco’s finger and the shimmering golden B floating within and would call that ring a lot of things, but little wouldn’t be one of them. “Ok, why didn’t the goblins say anything?”
“It was a mistake. He’s allowed those. He’s mine. I’ve had enough of losing people and I will not let you.” Harry growled, fine lines of magic, rippled from his hand and down his wand, red, crackling, and furious. The magic filling the room now toxic with rage.
He really wanted to go. It was where his parents had gone. It was also where his older brothers had gone. Well they weren’t really his older brothers, but he’d always thought of them as his older brothers, even after their marriage. Severus and Sirius weren’t really their names either but that’s all he’d ever called them.
Her smile was playful and genuine but there was steel and a protectiveness underneath that wasn’t and Charlie found his own laughter strained in reaction.
The whole place seemed to wait for Harry’s reply, the dull roar of a moment ago now a murmur. Harry felt his face redden, but the elderly man gripped his cane and Harry did not want to be blamed if the ol’man took a header, so he stepped up, “Yes, sir.”
“Is that?” One of the girls started but was hushed by the boy as Rey held the door and Ben hurried them along.
“What are you looking for?” Lucius demanded, parchment hanging from his hand.
“Nope.” Harry popped the p and bounced on his toes. “But you’re going to give us a couple joints and somewhere safe to smoke them and we’ll answer near about anything you want.”
Harry frowned and leaned against Draco’s side.
out.”
“Wait no!” Draco stood, wavering.
“It felt good to focus somewhere and just push.” Harry could feel the magic building at the thought.
Tawy smiled as she approached, “I’ve been looking everywhere for you two. You’re late for your session.”
“Worthy, love you,” Harry mumbled back, mostly asleep, but he turned to look up at him, blinking the sleep away, “Draco, what is it?”
“I love my parents.”
“Tea?” Headmistress McGonagall offered.
Pansy didn’t care, though she did spare a thought to when Potter got hot, but maybe it was Draco wrapped around him. She couldn’t wait until the song ended. “Draco!”
“Ah, well the wizarding world may consider you out of the realm of pediatrics; however, we of the medical community know better. We don't finish our growth into adulthood until 24 or so and magic continues stabilizing well into that. You’re in the right place.” She led him into a small private room, where she commanded the two Aurors to wait outside. They didn’t look happy, but they didn’t say anything to her either, as she shut the door and turned to him. “When was the last time you were in St. Mungo’s?
They didn’t even need to walk around the house, as the house elf offered a hand and within moments, they were taking deep breaths of lily’s and narcissus.
“Well they are who they are. They’re not exactly easy to talk to, the Savior and the Dark Lord’s personal torturer. Yeah, you ask them how it’s going.” Ben snapped back.
“Na, they’re the most important people of the Wizarding world. Basically, our version of religious icons, movie pending. And I mean that there are movies, cards, you name it all in their names.”
Then Neville Longbottom came over and gave Teddy a hug and it was everything he could do not to shout or do a happy dance. Teddy had had a poster of Longbottom in his room, brandishing his wand. Everyone knew Longbottom had led the Hogwarts rebellion and had killed Vortemort’s snake. He’d never thought to have this opportunity much less to be hugged and treated so warmly.
“Did Andromeda mention any of this to anyone?” Hestia asked.
Lucius looked down to the bloodless package opener, “Apologies, my darling.” At this rate he’d never get the blood he needed. He set the opener aside and leaned back against his desk. His body carefully hid the mass of research behind him, “Where are you off to?” His voice was barely bitter as he wouldn’t be going anywhere for some time.
“Who knew watching Death Eater’s get theirs would be so bloody boring?” Ron stretched as well, one of his arms nearly hitting the witch leaving the bench behind them. He apologized with a blush and pulled his arms in, watchful of the other benches clearing out around them.
“Move.” Draco growled, and Mandy jumped away.
“He destroyed it and punished me when I got upset. I never saw the nanny again. Mity, the house elf watched after me.”
Tawy scanned her list, “If the child wasn’t as powerful as he is. He would have died.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “You wish Potter.”
Draco looked to Harry, who shrugged. Draco sighed, “No point, sooner or later everyone finds out.”
Harry smiled. “Yes.”
“Thank Merlin,” the door slammed into the wall so hard that Tawy had to put up an arm to stop it from swinging back at her.
Ben jumped up. “What?”
Harry nodded. “He really was.”
“You do. You’re very scary.”
Harry looked away from the blade and to his other wrist, where his band blinked away.
She nodded with a still slightly concerned smile, “Fine. Let’s get a cab.”
Ella blinked, and whispered something to the girl beside her, before looking across the circle to them. “I don’t think I could handle the cruciatus hitting me.” She shivered.
Harry nodded, “that’s perfect. Does she have an auto?”
“That does suck.” Ben turned to Mandy. “Speaking of kicking, kick start another.”
“Hermione Granger-Weasley has a blog about trying to find you guys. Sometimes she writes letters to you on it, it’s seriously popular.”
He didn’t even shift from where he leaned against the headboard. Instead Draco ran his fingers through the dark strands of Harry’s hair. He marveled at how very pale his fingers were, like white sticks in black ink. He’d never been tan, but once he’d at least been healthy looking, another thing taken from him.
He’d spoken up for Narcissa but by the time the solicitors and Narcissa had finished, it had come off as something she and Lucius had planned. Heck, by the end of it, there weren’t many accusations that did stand. Lucius’ memory archive seemed to concentrate on the time just before and near the final battle, when he’d been little more than a hostage in his own house.
“What about your parents,” Clara started shyly, she glanced Harry, “or other family? Adults?”
Harry handed it over just as they emerged into the front part of the library and Tawy came through the door just as they slowed.
to say. Now they’re supposedly at a posh resort becoming best mates.” Mandy supplied. “Or something to that affect.”
“He knew they were hurting me. Dumbledore did nothing.”
Harry and Draco looked at her stonily from where they sat, nearly curled together, at the head of Draco’s bed.
George raised an eyebrow, “Come on Hermione, you don’t think Harry actually hates him? Not the way he tracks that kid.”
Harry smiled sadly. “My mum is the only person who ever loved me without that love being conditional. Everyone after her loved me with a reason, Dumbledore, because I was his great hope. Sirius and Remus, because I was all they had left of James. The Weasleys, because Dumbledore told them to. I’m not saying Ron doesn’t love me. I think he does now, but he was my first friend because he was told to be.”
Murphy waited them out. “You should both get one in mind. Something you think you’d be able to tackle, a starting place. You don’t have to share why it’s a trigger.”
They both reacted to the summons and stopped themselves from reaching for wands that weren’t with them. Ben leaned up against their table. He looked both excited and uncomfortable. He raised his hands. “Hey just a question, alright?”
Harry took the joint with growling frown. “Stop it. You’re nothing like them. You’re not, without you he would have won. So just
Draco smiled. “Indeed. Jenna said Channel has toiletries.”
Draco nodded and continued without missing a beat, "yes, sunglasses and shoes..."
Neville smiled, “Then we make the papers work for us. We make them send Harry and Malfoy to Hogwarts or risk looking like they’re holding the darlings of the Wizarding world hostage.”
Draco stared at him but then tried the drink, then another sip. Harry grinned as Draco drained the can.
Tawy cursed herself for not explaining better. She’d obviously fallen victim to the Malfoy iciness and hadn’t seen beneath to give him the reassurance he’d obviously needed. She grabbed a chair and sat before him and took his shaking hands. “Oh Draco, no one’s going to send you to Azkaban.” He didn’t cry and the tears that gathered in his eyes barely fell and those that did, he quickly wiped away. She could tell he was trying so hard to maintain his Malfoy shell, but between the potions and his overwhelmed nerves he was unable to completely push his tremendous feelings aside.
Harry rolled his as well. It looked like they weren’t going to outright say anything. He leaned in and whispered to Draco.
Ron dropped into his seat, “Bloody sickening.”
Mandy nodded. “Yeah, I told my sister as much. It’s fine, she has to go to the shops anyway.”
Teddy hated that he’d upset them so badly. It hadn’t been his intention but he thought they should know what they were walking in to. “Here and in the states it’s not as bad as it is over there.”
Harry glanced between Hermione and Ron, second guessing his decision.
“Guys-Guys!” Neville called out, finally hushing the crowd milling around the room. He pointed out the window he stood in front of, “look.” He held his ground, not allowing himself to be shoved aside, though he made room for his wife under his arm. He wasn’t surprised to see Hermione and Pansy at the forefront.
A hush came over the room as two solicitors entered through the double doors, one held the door as Lucius entered and behind him Narcissa glided in.
Romilda noticed their hands and the smile fell off her face like a brick, “Malfoy.”
Mandy grinned at Violet’s back. Finding and reconnecting with her half-sister was the smartest thing she’d ever done. No one made her feel as loved and cared for as Violet did and Mandy sincerely hoped she hadn’t brought her any trouble.
“Without question. Healer Robertoun was not here during our dark times. She doesn’t understand why we did what we did, all she sees is what it did to Draco and Harry.”
“They were totally bad-ass.” Ben said. He didn’t add that their bad-assery was very scary.
Tawy readied herself to tread carefully. “I have set up a time for us to meet with the Weasleys and a time to meet up with the Malfoys.”
“Shut up Pott-Harry.”
Harry rubbed his eyes and hoped Malfoy finished in the bathroom before they were both late. They’d only woken each other up a few times, less than 8, so Harry considered it a good night.
Harry read over his shoulder, “The Potter-Malfoy Chances Foundation.”
Mandy raised an eyebrow, “People are pissed?”
“Even thinking about it hurts.” Harry looked away.
Neither of them said a word. Harry imagined they resembled statues. Harry didn’t want to talk about earlier than a week ago and he didn’t want to wait alone while Draco did the same. Cause he would wait, in the hallway if need be.
“I’ve taken you out of the 2
Pansy looked to Narcissa, who waved a hand towards him. “She can’t say, it’s hush-hush and if she tells us, it’ll fall though. I must write him a letter.” She went to his desk and without care, he watched his paperwork scatter to the floor. “Quickly Lucius, she doesn’t have any time.”
He nodded as he drank more soda. “Okay,” he took another sip before Helen could take the glass, “can I buy this stuff somewhere?”
Ron scoffed, “Yeah, cause I care so much about understanding and helping Malfoy.”
Draco took the last of the joint from Harry’s hand. “Nope.”
“It was,” Molly agreed, “Wizards are living longer than ever. It’s not unheard of to reach 150 these days, so what’s a few more years added to the minority? At least they passed that temporary law. The one in which passing the NEWTS marked adulthood. They’ve passed so many new laws recently, haven’t they? In any case, I’ll be able to keep Harry and Ron for at least the year while they take their 8
Lucius sighed as he stood and took her hand. “Cissy,” he didn’t know how to tell her the many ways she could still (would) lose Draco, but he could spare her the pain today, “Give it a little more time.” And his Cissy had never been dumb, she knew.
Harry whistled lowly, skipping over the English manor, telling himself that hopefully one day he’d be able to explain it to Draco. “How loaded are you?”
really was evil, wasn’t he?”
Draco stared at him for a moment. “Alright.”
Murphy slid into Tawy’s office, key in hand and stopped short. “What are you doing in here?”
Tawy nabbed Helen at the door, hustling her out. “I’ll give you a few minutes Draco.”
year if you’re going back.”
Hermione grabbed his sleeve, “come on, we might find out.”
Judge Fumeurs nodded to woman, “The court thanks you Healer, if you would please announce yourself for the record.”
“Harry has an affinity for owls.” Draco said softly.
Ben frowned. “I kind-a thought it would be exciting, being mixed up with all those famous wizards. Calling them by name and tangling in their adventures. Thought it’d better than being kicked around by my dad.”
Harry didn’t look away from her as he said, “Draco, you pity her.”
“You make an adorable couple.” She looked over Harry’s shoulder, “Damn.”
“Doesn’t look at all evil, does he?”
People scattered, Headmistress McGonagall being one of the last to leave the Great Hall. She thoughtfully watched her students scatter and sadly closed the doors before she made her way to her office, where she was found an hour later by Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. The portraits had already told her what the students were tripping over each other to say. Harry’s things were gone, yes, she knew, the elves had also taken Malfoy’s. The portraits also told her the boys had left the castle. Hermione wanted to go Grimmauld place and since they were 8
“Longbottom, I think I’ve just fallen a little in love with you.”
Neville gasped, “No!” He leaned forward as Pansy laughed, “No, really?”
Harry sat back; braid held limply in his hands as he blinked. He had wondered why suddenly he could give Sirius a title when he’d been told he couldn’t. He’d thought it was because Sirius had been found not guilty of any previous crimes. He’d thought it was because of all the awards given to Sirius, and here it had been Draco. “Thank you.”
George darted forward and gave Harry a quick hug. He waved his fingers towards Draco, turned and apparated away.
“I will.”
Draco sat thoughtfully for a few minutes and then said softly. “Do you know what the first thing I did was, after I received the title?”
“Really? How dreadful. I think we’re a little old for that now.” Lucius and Narcissa rarely questioned what he did with his time unless they had demands on it. They never asked anything about his life and they certainly never wanted to talk about it.
HDHDHD
George raised his hand and waved a few fingers. “Actually, I might be able to add a few tidbits to that. Tidbits my mum kept from Ron, but,” he smirked, “she couldn’t keep from me. Maybe we should,” he gestured towards the empty classrooms around them, “this could take a while.” He took Ron’s deluminator from his pocket and rolled it in his hand, “We’ve got a lot to discuss.”
“They deserve to be remembered.” The remembrance of Sirius’ love was sometimes the only thing that got him going.”
Harry leaned over and pulled Draco back until their eyes met. “Lucius walked around a battlefield unarmed to find you and Narcissa lied to Voldemort’s face to protect you. They love you even if they are shit at showing it and have the parenting sense of a, Hermione what’s an animal that has really bad parenting skills,”
Mandy glowered. The one thing she’d learned about these two, they never knew how to explain any of the crazy stuff they did. “Still, more in someone else’s head than I’d want to be.”
Lucius nodded. He still seemed unsettled but resolute, “of course you’re right. Any advantage we can give ourselves we should.”
She stopped moving and stared at him in disbelief, “what do you mean? About what? About taking up with Malfoy of all people? I thought we were only on a break. I thought we,” her words dwindled off as she took in Harry’s face, “and you didn’t?”
“He had it in his mind to stay in the Black place, by himself.” Molly huffed. Harry stopped himself from rolling his eyes.
They’d gotten new furniture, looking around the room, Harry noticed a lot of new things mixed in with the old, it was different but nice. He sat on the new couch and brought Draco down next to him. Ron followed on his other side, while Hermione took the chair closest.
The next day fell right into their new routine. The kids didn’t sit any closer to them during the meeting, but that didn’t bother Harry. He could tell whoever got there last were stuck in the seats closest to him and Draco and would move their seats as far away as the circle allowed. He knew it amused Draco.
Harry grinned and Mandy’s eyes widened, by now she’d seen a million pictures of Harry Potter and in none of them had he smiled like that.
“Thank you my dear, thank you.” Narcissa squeezed her hands and even gave her a quick hug.
Mandy frowned, “who?” and then it hit her, “she might…maybe.”
Tawy bit off her smile as the boy was being serious, “no, I suppose not.”
“Always.”
He sat up and brushed some hair from his face. Tawy helped by grabbing the mass of white blonde and quickly made a messy loose braid. “There you go,” she grabbed his clothes, the well-made dress pants, the tailor-made white button down, the dark green tie, and ridiculously expensive robes.”
Neville grinned sheepishly, “And Malfoy of course.”
“My name is Healer Tawy Robertoun, you may call me Tawy.”
Harry ran his fingers through his hair nervously, “Um Violet, we’d like to pay for a cab, if that’s alright by you?”
She nodded, “He’s been subjected to the cruciatus curse so many times that we had to administer nerve regenerator potions. He’s damaged his vocal cords, but we were able to repair them. He’s had some vascular and neuron damage that were causing him severe and nearly constant headaches. The list goes on for some time as the child’s in a bad way but in the end, he’s suffers from abuse plan and simple. We’ve had to put him on a step plan to reverse the damage.”
Harry didn’t know where Draco had gone to, he had a 20 minute start, but McGonagall was in the Great Hall so he couldn’t have used her floo. He patted his pockets for the map, he had it somewhere.
She greeted Harry with a warm hug, thankful he didn’t refuse her. He’d been so angry the last she’d seen him. He didn’t seem angry with her now. As soon as she released him, he returned to the Malfoy boy as if he’d been drawn there. She finally acknowledged the last boy by dipping her head deeply, “your Grace,” let it not be said that they didn’t have knowledge of decorum.
Draco swallow thickly and took a deep breath, trusting Harry’s strength. He raised his eyes to meet Harry’s and started.
Neville didn’t look away from the window. “Yeah, alright. Let’s go Hermione.”
Ron scratched his head. “When did Harry learn to dance?”
The Judge interrupted, really not wanting to air the Ministries dirty laundry to foreign nationals, “Has been suspended from duties baring further investigation.”
She didn’t talk for several minutes giving them some time to transition. Once she felt they might be receptive she started the session. “We got a long week before us. Sessions twice a day, one with wand, one without. We’ve got a lot of things to cover during those times. So where would like to start today?”
“That’s only fair Mandy.” Rey told her.
“Mrs. Goyle, her sister, Greg, and his older sister, all dead,” Blaise announced, “And he left that. I told her we should destroy it.”
They arrived 15 minutes early and already the place was quickly filling with people talking, some with joyful excitement. The reporters buzzed in the background. Harry kept his head down as they quickly adjusted to the crowd and found the best seats they could. Moments after they’d been seated, Hermione gasped and nudged him. Harry looked to her but she nodded up and towards the walls.
Pansy’s words faltered. “What?”
Harry grinned and started his braid.
The elderly man grinned, “Well I’ll be, get up here sonny and bring your friends. I want to pay for the lunch of the young man who saved my great-granddaughter’s life.”
“Some reason?” Pansy shook her head but didn’t move away from Luna’s hand. “No, it’s Draco and Potter I’m telling you. The Ministry is up to something. Now that Draco has been sainted in the press and public, as powerful as he is.” Pansy shrugged, “well he’s worth something big now, isn’t he? And Potter is a powerhouse and the public’s darling and the ministry has them both.”
Harry didn’t wait for further invitation and headed towards the door. He could feel the spell release as he crossed over the threshold. He could also see the tell-tale signs of bored reporters turning his way.
“How did he do that?” Violet wondered, but neither Mandy or Harry had an answer.
Clara shivered. She remembered the wanted poster of Black and she’d seen Potion Master Snape once, his very walk had been fearsome.
The Judge announced, “The court recognizes Madam Andromeda Tonks.”
A younger woman behind the man said, “You might want to tell him whose great-grandfather you are Judge Bones.”
And when Harry felt raw and open, scooped out, every pain laid bare he added, “I was jealous when you hugged Pansy. She’s so confident and not fucked up and I,”
After the first time, the owner of the room hadn’t tried to talk to them, he barely looked at them as they left. Draco could tell people were looking at them and maybe talking about them. None of them actually tried to talk to them, which was the way he liked it. They made it back to their room, without having to speak to anyone.
Siri nudged his foot with his own. “It won’t bother us if you choose to go. We won’t be angry.”
Harry shrugged, “believe me or not, but he knew and
Ron blinked. “Huh? Why? We’ll only be gone a month.”
“Remember that evil wizard I told you about?”
Harry stiffened. “You’re arresting me?” The anger rose up. After all he had done for these people.
They met Mandy at the door, which led into a muggle meeting/visitation room. Mandy rushed forward to meet a tall blonde woman, who looked nothing like Mandy, but the woman greeted her with a hug. “Mandy!” She hugged her tightly.
Mandy stared and Ben, realizing he was doing the same, coughed. “Uh hi.”
“I guess,” he looked down to the hair clutched in Potter’s hands, “I don’t mind it.”
was supposed to be here. The Malfoy’s were there with their solicitor. Draco was speaking quietly with his mother. Mrs. Tonks and her head solicitor waited on the other side of the room. The Judge waited them out from behind his desk as everyone took seats or stood. Harry chose to stand in the back, thankfully Ron and Hermione stayed close. After several long minutes, Healer Tawy and Minister Shacklebolt joined them.
“Don’t you need stuff too?” Violet asked.
“Like flexing a muscle that’s been hurt and healing.” Draco narrowed his eyes in thought. “It’s our magic healing from being siphoned.”
Draco shrugged, “Not your finest moment. Though I suppose I had it coming.”
Ben took a drag. “That’s why I’m here by the way. My ol’man was the one with the problems and I’m the one they locked away.”
Teddy nearly chuckled and bit it off with a shake of his head. “Sev you are anything but the bad guy in this story. Bad boy, yeah, but people have made you into the icon of change. People love you. Shit Sev after the movie people got the death mark tattoo with your name through the middle in support of you.”
She grinned. “That was brilliant. I’ve never seen anything like it honestly. It’s so hard to believe you’re just 16.”
years, and because she knew they wouldn’t believe her when she told them Harry hadn’t gone there, she let them go check. She sent Ginny back to her common room. Several minutes after they’d left, they re-graced her fireplace and told her what she’d already had known. McGonagall allowed them to brainstorm in her office before giving them enough platitudes to get them to go back to their common room. She told them she’d contact Kingsley and anyone else she could think of and she would, but the fact was, if Harry and Draco didn’t want to be found, well. They were rich and magically powerful enough not to be found and large part of her thought they deserved to be free.
Harry felt the heartfelt smile bloom over his face, “You’re Susan’s great-grandfather,” he moved swiftly to shake the man’s hand even as he announced; “Susan is a brave woman, your honor.”
He took the drink and, not as trusting, took a small sip then a larger one. He tried to take another, but Helen traded it for another potion. “You can have more after this next set of potions.” Draco took the potion. She looked to Tawy. “We’re not really going to put him back into those stuffy clothes, are we?” She made a face at Draco’s expensive shoes, which had to be the most uncomfortable things she’d ever seen.
Harry blinked, shocked and hurt. He couldn’t believe Hermione would push him away, not the only person that never faltered when standing at his side. When she blinked, and he saw the tears in her eyes, he realized she must truly believe this would help. She wasn’t pushing him away this hurt her too. She leaned forward and hugged him quickly, “we love you.”
“When will I be able to see the Weasleys?”
Harry felt the stares of the whole group. Thankfully they had to take breaks from staring at him to stare at Malfoy. The kids of either side of them not so discretely moved their chairs further from them, which suited Harry just fine. He sighed as he dropped into his seat.
Harry nodded with pride. “Yeah, he is.”
“Oi!”
Harry grinned. “Yeah.”
Harry frowned, afraid Malfoy was right. “We’ll see.”
The solicitor nodded with an immediate look of relief and turned back to his cohorts, waving for one to go, the last turned and quickly went out of the room again.
“You’re divorced?” Harry asked.
“I’m getting angry thinking about it, which might not be a good idea.” Harry tried to calm himself and the magic that was starting to roar around him. Then something odd happened, Draco put his hand over his and Harry could breathe again. He took a deep breath and released it. “Thanks.”
Harry glanced to Draco, who still didn’t look happy, but it seemed like he had pressed it as far as Tawy would go right now. Harry figured he’d try again later. He glanced to Draco, who shrugged slightly. “I guess not.”
The man dropped his head, “No sir, I allowed myself to believe that there could be nothing wrong. I allow my judgment to be swayed by my superiors and
Harry hugged him gratefully. Draco hugged him as well but whispered, “Movies? As in more than one, who played us?”
Teddy swallowed thickly, “you’d come with me?”
Harry looked towards McGonagall as she stood again, “Harry, I think we,”
Draco looked him up and down. “Yes, totally.”
“How much pot?” Tawy glanced back at the room. That would certainly explain their inability to hold back, marijuana relaxed the constraints of magic. She knew that’s what caused it to be so very popular with these kids and why she was mostly unsuccessful in keeping it out. Though really it wasn’t a problem, sometimes even a help, allowing the kids an outlet and not letting their magic ‘back up’.
“And any upgrades you’d like.” Draco added.
Harry sighed, “can we stay home during breaks?”
Harry smiled sickly and tapped his head, “Oh but I do, Tom thought I’d enjoy his screams.”
“What about the cruciatus?” Ella asked.
“They are so freaking hot.”
Mandy stared at him but didn’t answer, none of them said anything.
“They must,” Hermione whispered back, but sounded unsure.
Fumeurs waved off the solicitor and raised a privacy shield, behind which they spoke furiously between themselves for a few moments before lowing it. “It is so agreed. The accused are found guilty and their custody of said child restricted. They are fined 5 Million gallons to be awarded to His Grace, Duke of Black.”
Shacklebolt slid a parchment across the Judge’s desk before standing beside it. The Judge read it and looked to Shacklebolt who nodded, then Healer Tawy, who repeated the gesture. Judge Fumeurs sighed, grabbed a quill and added his own signature, before waving his wand over the parchment. That seemed to be the cue everyone was waiting for as he lifted his wand the room went quiet. He glanced among them, finally stopping on Mrs. Tonks, “It is admirable what you ask to do Madam.” He looked to Molly, “You as well, Mrs. Weasley, taking young Potter in. However unnecessary, it is appreciated.
Tawy sighed. “I’ll be signing all your permission slips. The Ministry thought it would be best if we gave you both some space away from everyone else’s ideas of what was good for you.”
Harry nonchalantly watched as Malfoy looked his vials over as well and seemed just about as happy as he’d been that they weren’t labeled. They picked at their food in silence. Harry just wasn’t hungry. Just idea of being forced to meet other people. He pushed the food further away.
Harry wasn’t sure that’s where he wanted to go but, by the time he’d finished the thought, he was already there. He sighed and followed Ron in. Hermione leaned in, “Ginny’s not here.”
“I don’t even think Potter noticed till sometime the first day.” Draco added with a smirk.
At that moment Mandy believed everything, every crazy seemly impossible byline she’d ever read. She had to force herself to understand that these two were the same two she’d brought here. They just didn’t look anything like two ‘not so powerful’ wizards. No this was ‘The Savior of the Wizarding World’ and ‘The Dark Lord’s Torturer’ and around them the room tore itself to shambles. The practice dummies danced with the spells that hit them, each jerking with dark magic. A table against wall flew up and then towards their viewing window.
Harry blushed, but he wouldn’t back down. “Yes.”
Draco nodded, “welcome, you can keep that one, I’ve got tons.”
Well that was something. It wasn’t that they hadn’t had a good breakup per se. She had taken his refusal to get back together well. He’d been surprised how understanding she’d been. It was just going to take time before they were really friends again. Harry just couldn’t really be comfortable around her yet. Though he would have preferred that in comparison to what they did walk into. Molly hunched over her kitchen table with her hands over her face, speaking to Arthur with watery broken words. “What if it’s true? And we did nothing. He was the only child in the inner circle.”
Molly pulled herself together as more impromptu guests arrived. Harry noticed they were mostly former Order members. Some he was happier to see than others, still he greeted everyone who spoke to him. Poppy inquired about his health for several minutes, though it had 3 months since he’d been released from St. Mungo’s. He figured it might be 3 months more before she didn’t ask every time she saw him.
“Anything that kid needs well, you let me know, alright?”
He immediately paused, “yes, Healer.” She raised the shield. He put the green marker down and folded his hands over the sheet. “Should I move back to the couch?”
“Even the Hufflepuffs are tougher than that.” Harry added lightly. He tapped his wrist, “well that killed a few minutes. Wanna head to the next round?”
Harry glared up at the Healer. “What did you do to him?” He didn’t bother hiding his anger. This bitch had upset Draco enough that he was shaking.
Harry raised an eyebrow.
“Damn straight.” Harry nodded and took the deepest drag he dared to.
Lucius nodded. He had known what they were, he did work with muggle’s who were worth his business time, but wanted to hear this from Draco. They both knew what he was really asking, “those are muggle, are they not?”
Harry dropped the braid and threw his arms around Draco. “Thank you.”
“Well did he do it? Did your uncle use the crucio?” Ben asked Ella.
“Draco in a muggle club, the mind boggles.” Blaise remarked.
Tawy held up the papers. “I’ll get this taken this care of. Will you need a couple of overnight bags?
Harry shifted in the beanbag to take the joint Mandy offered before answering her question, “Yep,” he took a toke and passed it to Draco.
“We have need for a knife.” Draco said, studying Vane with a tilted head as he spoke calmly, “would you be the one to ask for such an item?”
Tawy sighed. It wasn’t a problem for
“They wouldn’t do that.” Clara said softly.
If possible, the Healer’s glare darkened further at the sight of his father, but she didn’t say anything while the Auror let down the wards and passed over a parchment. Isaacs quickly read it over, “the court has ordered the younger Malfoy to be examined by a healer.”
“So you two drew the short straw to meet us?”
Rey mumbled some excuse that he knew neither was paying attention to and ducked out.
Harry laughed, both at the thought and the idea that Ginny and Neville were parents. “I wouldn’t know. Teddy is as close as we get to kids.” Harry gestured over to Teddy, who was standing next to Draco, talking to Hermione and trying not to look star struck.
Harry smirked and held up two fingers, “Twice.”
Harry took in the beanbag chairs and the blankets spread on the floor. There was a make-shift low table with an ashtray and magazines. There was also a stack of snacks and soft drinks, Ben waved towards them. “People donate to get time. No one knows when this was built or even who did it.”
The woman paused and stammered. “Well, she’d be excited if I could tell her, which I can’t of course.”
Harry glanced at Draco, “Um, there’s stuff we should probably explain.”
“I am Barrister Heidi Killsmen at your service. By the time we’re done, not only will Ms. Granger be freed and able to leave, but so will her family, and a kola for your troubles, should you like.”
“Yes, Healer.” Draco nodded, but didn’t move.
Harry shrugged, unraveling the braid he’d just finished. “Draco’s the first person who I actually want in my head.”
“Not a glimmer,” Ron shrugged.
Harry’s good mood evaporated. “What? Draco?”
Hermione shook her head. “No, they did date, they broke it off. Actually,” she blushed, “I’ve been seeing a lot of Blaise since my divorce from Ron.”
Draco could tell more money had gone into Mandy’s one room than several other rooms combined. Somehow that was significant, Draco could tell that, but not why.
They nodded, and she moved onto Draco’s wrist continuing, “You’ll eat in the cafeteria today. Please go, don’t make me escort you. The staff will give you a shake with some nutritional potions. If nothing else, drink those. There we go,” she patted his wrist and didn’t seem offended when Draco yanked away. “Sorry about that.” She apologized as she backed away. She’d seen their breakfast tray and, though she was happy they’d taken their potions, she wished they’d eaten more. She hoped lunch went a little better. “Alright, ready to go?”
“Where do you think,”
“Huh, you didn’t get the Black house.”
“Ta, much,” Ron mumbled into his second coffee of the day.
Draco shrugged. “I guess not, if it was a little or it had been going on so long we didn’t notice.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “The Dog?”
He went back to the barrister’s missive and the folders they’d sent of likely candidates.  There was a chance even after Draco was released to Hogwarts, if they were released, though it sounded most likely, that he would not be able to communicate with him. It sounded as if there were hopes they wouldn’t be able to communicate Draco full stop.
Harry nodded and pushed the rest of his sandwich towards Ron, who joyfully dived in.
“Andromeda? How is she?”
Draco glanced around the small room. There was a single hospital cot with a table next to it, a small rolling table, a standing armoire and a couple of chairs. “I haven’t been,” he stood with his back to the wall next to the bedside table.
“None. Merlin’s beard. I could ask my sister.”
Draco frowned. “I think, okay I know, sometimes I acted worse to get your attention. I don’t know to handle shite Potter. I strike out when I get scared and I was scared for a long time.” He sighed, “fuck, muggles scare me. I don’t know anything about them, just what my parents said and that wasn’t right. I’m trying Potter.”
“I guess you may call me Draco.”
Harry shrugged, “Fine, a little stiff, but fine.”
Lucius bristled and the female Auror scowled at her partner, “if the parchment doesn’t say then we don’t know. Let’s not make this unpleasant. He will submit to the exam.”
Draco shrugged, his shoulders bumping into Harry’s forearms, “I honestly don’t care, I don’t have anywhere else to go, except the manor and I’d rather not.”
“Are still your parents,” Tawy leaned forward, “and Molly Weasley is still your friend Harry. We’re just allowing you both some time to do things differently.”
“What? Really?” She didn’t know what to say. Normally she’d try to talk someone out of marrying so young, but she’d never seen Harry so happy, and after everything he deserved some happiness.
Harry studied him momentarily before nodding. “Okay, that would be good. You can’t be slinging mudblood around everywhere, and I’ll try not to push your buttons.”
Blaise coughed.
Draco scowled at the blank faces around them, all seemly feeling the pressure but unsure what to do. “We need to destroy something.” He growled.
“And no idea what that might mean?”
“One of them would play at being a muggle and then me and the other would hunt the muggle down and give him a stinging hex.”
The iciness wasn’t surprising, unpleasant as it was, it was still better this well-earned anger than the mess she would have had with the Malfoys. Tawy pointed down to the two pictures, “Draco,” she moved to the other, “Harry.”
The one in front rushed forward, thrusting the parchment importantly to the Judge, who took it up with a snap of his fingers. He opened the parchment and quickly read the page, before his eyebrows wrinkled and he went back over it. Finally, he huffed and passed it to the judge on his right, before looking down to the awaiting solicitors, “we will hear her and allow her to proceed before the Malfoy case.”
Harry glanced to Mandy, who nodded, her hand up her sleeve.
Narcissa seemed confused. “Sets him off?”
Harry blinked back the tears. “Had you ever even met her?”
George just happened to know there was a particular closed group that met at 4 o’clock, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday. On Wednesday, at 4:45pm, George Weasley took a seat outside the Hogwart’s classroom he’d learned the group met within. He hoped this was the right step to take, without Fred he felt unbalanced and unsure. He second guessed himself, which he’d
Pansy closed her eyes and took several calming breaths, “I can’t, wait,” she dug into her pocket and handed Hermione a beaten and folded parchment, “Here, I just, this was delivered to my house, what’s this going to do to Draco?”
Violet shook her head at the dance floor and went back to the bar. Roughly 10 minutes later, she looked up from the drink she was making to see a tall ginger, looking rather lost and determined. She handed off the drink and went round the bar til she was close enough. “Oi!”
Harry thought Draco was just awkward because they were in a muggle place, turns out it was just the wrong place. They walked into Louis Vuitton and muggle or not Draco had found his people. The awkwardness faded to understanding and the assistants in the place knew one of their own, even if he looked as if he’d just checked out of a hospital.
He clicked the picture bigger and realized he did something wrong when Draco paled and Harry gasped. Harry stood, “why?” Draco took his arm and Harry grabbed his hand. Teddy was thankful they got a chance to see it over a pc screen rather than in life if this was their reaction. The statue was considered a symbol of the whole war. Robed figures, faceless due to their hoods, stood around the figures of Harry and Draco. Harry was kneeling, while Draco stood in front of him, wand pointed towards Harry, dangerous until you realized it was the handle of the wand and not the tip. The only colors on the whole of the white marble were the Gryffindor crest on Harry’s chest and the Slytherin crest on Draco’s.
Harry rubbed his face and cringed at the heat he could feel rising on his cheeks, “you heard me, we have a lot in common and I hate how they treat you.”
Harry folded his arms. “Magic.”
“Of course,” Kingsley replied calmly in response to Molly’s raising ire. He tapped the paper and made three copies, offering the first copy to Malfoy, who handled it to his solicitor. The second copy to Mrs. Tonks and then the last to Molly, who immediately keyed onto the document.
Harry shook his head, “No.” He reached his hand back to his left. “A little help, Malfoy.”
“And I thought my parents would have to?” Draco added in.
Draco couldn’t imagine it, but Pansy had mentioned they had joined a group. It was just a foreign idea.
Neville felt sick, he passed the paper over to Seamus, “can they write that? It can’t be right to tell the whole world.”
Harry felt Draco’s flinch and intervened before Tawy had a chance to answer, “I’d rather go with Draco, thank you.”
would even acknowledge that there
Molly sorrowfully turned to her once change. “Harry, if you’ve been siphoned. Perhaps this for the best. Just until you get used to things mind.” She wanted to tell him he could come home after, but she couldn’t even offer that. She didn’t know what they could do to fight this. She did know if she couldn’t get Harry to agree, the Ministry would take him by force and that would only strengthen their conviction.
“Harry would never forgive us if we didn’t,” Seamus laughed, as he opened a random classroom door for them to meet in.
“Draco, trying to be what they want will make you miserable and it won’t last.” He flew back from her and she knew she’d pushed too soon.  In for a gallon, she continued. “If they can’t love you as you are, does it matter if they love who they think you are? It’s not real.” He yelled in rage and pain and shoved back against the shield. The shield screamed and then went completely down. She thought it was Draco, but as Harry quickly crawled towards Draco, she wasn’t sure which had done it.
“Keep it.”
Harry was getting far more amusement out of Draco frightening these blokes than he knew he should be. He should’ve been trying to rein Draco in, but it was fun to watch and he wasn’t hurting anyone. Besides, even if no one else could see it, Harry could see the upwards curl of Draco’s scowl and who was he to ruin Draco’s fun.
The Dr.’s smile dimmed somewhat faced with Draco’s cold look. He coughed, looked next to himself, and brought forth a woman to stand next to him. “This is my consultant, Penny.”
Harry smiled sadly. “I learned the hard way. Sometimes you just gotta ask. Maybe there was a reason they stayed away but you won’t know until you ask. I don’t think she’ll stop loving you if you aren’t like them.”
He actually growled at her, “You owe me this and you’ll let me have it.”
Mandy opened the window and owl took off with a hoot. “She’s a real good flier.” She noticed Harry watching closely, “You don’t have to worry about her.”
“In the meantime, I’ve bought more owls. You can send them in mass now.”
“We need the space.” Ben announced.
“I agree, it’s not. I’m not trying diminish your question, I just don’t have an answer yet.” Tawy was calm, she waited, not adding anything else, while they processed.
“You’re different from them.”
Draco yanked his arm back. The idea of Violet, a muggle, a muggle he liked, who had treated him so nicely touching that thing made him sick.
Judge Fumeurs picked up his glasses and leaned forward. “We have found sufficient indication though medical analyses to conclude these boys are legally incompetent. They’ve been so twisted around by every adult around them they don’t know which way is up. The Ministry has the legal right to take them into guardianship within the confines of what is written there. Healer Robertoun will not give her ‘opinion’ on the state of their competence when questioned, but a professional diagnosis. The Malfoy’s parental rights have not been terminated as it stands right now, in the future, they may regain guardianship.” He nodded to Kingsley, who sighed heavily but removed several rolls from his robes and passed them out.
“To listen in on the Order but that was a little rip. Did Dumbledore teach you too?”
Tawy nodded. “And that’s okay.”
“Harry, Ma’am.”
Tawy allowed them to wander awhile. Draco explaining to Harry, when he couldn’t guess what something did. She took one of the seats by the couch and studied them as they spoke. She couldn’t believe these boys were once so hateful of each other they’d legitimately attempted to murder the other. They seemed so very content in the other’s company. She watched with interest as Harry grabbed Draco’s hand to show him something and not only did Draco not pull away, but when they stopped, he leaned against Harry, who smiled and kept talking. Very interesting indeed, this development could be only good.
However, all that aside, it still begged the question of what to do. Draco was not suited to become the next Lord of Malfoy, nor would he ever be if the information he’d gathered was even partially correct. This was a problem. They were certainly young enough to have another child and physically nothing prevented them. Nothing but Narcissa’s flat refusal. She had told him in the past she could love no other child but Draco and had never changed her stance. Draco would be the only child she would carry. There was a high chance she would kill any other child before birth to prevent the infant taking from Draco. There was a chance, though smaller, as he knew she loved him, that she would kill him to prevent him from giving any of Draco’s inheritance away.
Blaise batted Draco’s braid, as the other boy passed to take a seat, “That’s new.”
“We,” Harry paused, “need some place safe to um.”
Harry didn’t know which of them flinched harder at Ben’s description. He twisted his wrist in Draco’s light grip and grasped his arm whispering quickly. “Hey that’s not who we are.” Draco nodded but it pissed Harry off how all the humor had slid right off Draco’s face. Harry stopped himself from rampaging over. He was hoping one of them would say it was for sure weed. That he could get behind. Merlin knew if anyone needed a good high it was them.
Draco nodded. “Hopefully her sister will let us out.”
She sighed with a for-longed breath and let him go, blade in his hand, “You better go Harry, you’re blinking.”
He quickly stood and went to the door. Narcissa was not one to scream the place down without a damn good reason. She’d had to many reasons recently and none good, so he wondered what had befallen them now, as the doors opened before he’d even reached them and Narcissa rushed in.
She smiled. “Thank you. I’ve got a spare room, single bed, but I’m sure you two won’t mind that.”
Tawy scowled at the group. She couldn’t believe they were still here. Some people had little common sense. She didn’t want to say the group was obsessed and wanted to coo over them but that was basically what they wanted to do.
Harry looked over to Draco and wondered what he had to write about. Draco had been lying on his stomach across his bed for the last 20 minutes writing away. Harry was attempting to do the same, had even copied Draco’s position, but nothing was coming to him. He tapped his quill against the journal. It didn’t make the same satisfying noise a pen made. Harry sighed and looked to the other boy. He didn’t fully trust Draco, yet, but it was scary how much he already trusted him and how much he wanted to. They still fought a lot but even that was theirs. Blinking he turned back to his journal.
“We need to send an owl,
Violet looked to them. “Are these your friends?” She offered her hand. “I’m Violet.”
Draco couldn’t believe how nonchalant she sounded, like it wasn’t a big deal. She was still calm as if he hadn’t ruined any of her plans. She didn’t even raise her voice. He didn’t know how to deal with it, so he thought over the suggestion. He was sure they would do something no matter what he wanted or what he thought, and a dreamless sleep sounded better than most of the things he could think of. He nodded.
Harry took Draco’s hand and twisted their fingers together tightly, “They’ve already told the whole world about the muggles that raised me and my cupboard under the stairs. Of my starvation and pain, all there in print for everyone to read. I’ve learned that everything I do or that is done to me is everyone’s business. I’m not allowed privacy.” He shrugged, “I’m just numb to the whole thing honestly. Will they need us to testify? It only happened the once,” he glanced at Draco, “for each of us.”
“Yes, of course. You’ll be welcome to set up sessions with Harry and Draco as well, as often as you need.”
Harry smiled sheepishly. “Sorry. He’s spoiled.”
“Somewhere I can’t leave, somewhere where people are going to make it their business to tell me what to do.” Harry said lowly, comforted by the feeling of magic around him.
The atmosphere of the room stalled, everyone waiting, paused as the magic seemed to hold on the brink of a wave.
Draco smirked. “Yes Harry, the plum silk button down shirt and black on black monogramed trousers.”
Only Mother and Uncle Sev said they were ever proud of him and it had been a long while since either had even thought it, he was sure.
“Potter what you’ve got is your parent’s personal vaults. Like I have my personal vault from my parents and my inheritances. Then, when I claimed Duke Black, I also received the family vaults. If you had the Potter family vaults, you’d have a nifty little thing like this,” Draco waved his ring over his shoulder.
She smiled widely, “oh, it’s silly really,” but her eyes were a little wild and the girl next to her looked towards her with a disbelieving shake of her head.
“But I need to know if something happens to you immediately. We cannot allow ourselves to be used against each other. We need every piece of knowledge we can get. Even the smallest scrape of information we can pass between us may help us survive. We need to be able to move as one without outside communication.”
Next to him, Mandy puffed, “give it here, I’ll hide it.”
The woman following him nodded. “Of course, of course.” The woman behind her ran to get them.
“We’ll be fine,” Sev reassured him.
Harry nodded. Tawy looked to Draco. Draco’s mouth twisted in thought, his eyes trained on Harry. Several minutes, she waited while the blond seemed to struggle with what to say, finally his eyes regained focus. “It’s like I hold a string which connects me to him. I know if I need him, he’ll know it, if I need him to hear me, he will.”
Harry reached out and stopped Draco’s hands and held them as Draco continued, “Stop. Stop it. Draco stop it!” Draco froze. “Look at me,” Harry demanded, silent until Draco’s eyes met his. “It wouldn’t have hurt her. It doesn’t mean anything. Except as a mark of your ability to survive.” Harry rubbed his hand over the mark, soothing the red and scratched skin. He lifted Draco’s arm and kissed the mark, several times. Draco shivered, and Harry mumbled a healing spell onto the skin, sealing it with a kiss. “See it’s just a tattoo now.” He rolled Draco’s sleeves back up. “There, alright love?”
Draco scowled, “really Potter,”
Harry glanced at Draco’s band as they turned and took off down the stairs, sure enough red. He couldn’t believe they hadn’t noticed.
Harry nodded and said with quiet conviction, “We’ll be here, sir.”
“Out?” Draco asked, with a raised eyebrow.
The Judge to the left of Fumeurs scowled and bellowed out “that boy is facing some serious charges. The fact that his parents didn’t tuck in him at night is not going to exonerate him. People died.”
Molly recovered herself, straightening in her seat, “as long as Harry’s happy. That’s the main thing isn’t it? We’ll work on that Malfoy boy. I’ll have Harry bring him along for breaks. Poor child, what they did to him.” Molly shook her head sadly. “It’ll be a Merlin’s blessing to help him.”
Pens and markers were brilliant. Draco was determined to take some back to Hogwarts, quills be damned. Not to mention his designer muggle clothes. Draco wasn’t giving up his Louboutin shoes for Merlin himself. And now that he’d found them, they’d have to take his sunglasses from his cold dead hands.
Tawy scowled. She was not going to allow that woman in here and give her this opportunity. She tilted her head, “Black family magic you say?”
Harry’s eyes widened. “It’s never felt like this. Like,”
Hermione sighed. “You haven’t seen any of the blogs or writings at all, have you? Figures.”
Draco scowled, “My parents gave me to madman. Every other adult was insane and just as worthless, with one exception.”
Ella’s eyes locked onto the blonde in question, “really a Duke?” She tilted her head. He was so pretty but, “Na, still too scary. Does it mention Potter’s title? I know he’s to claim one or two, is one of them Duke?”
Everyone finally believed him, about damn time, but Harry’s eyebrows crinkled in confusion. He didn’t understand why this was important or even mattered but he glanced to Draco, who seemed to be thinking something out, and answered. “I knew I could.”
Charlie wasn’t sure how but Hermione and Ron had been halfway to the door before the knock had sounded.
“He called me pretty too, when he came to my dreams. Touched me, it felt so real. They said they couldn’t stop him. They just cared more for my visions than for me.”
“George?”
“Did they look alright?” He asked.
She shook her head and cast the bubble. “What are you drawing Harry?”
“Thank you,” She took a deep breath and hated her job.
Teddy shook his head amused and a little worried. His brothers might not be as ready as they’d thought. “I’ve got to get you on the net. You’ll freak. People have been looking for you two forever.”
Mrs. Tonks leaned back in her seat. “I see.”
The girl sitting next to Ben rolled her eyes with a scowl, “Maybe we should ask the experts. Potter, Malfoy care to share?”
The girl glared down at them, “what do you want anyway? We don’t have all day.”
Draco paled. That had been most unpleasant, and he didn’t think he could do it again. The very thought made his breath catch.
“Yes, met them, charming boys,” she answered, ripping the top off her muffin. She didn’t have to look up to know Murphy rolled his eyes.
Ben blinked nervously. “It’s not. We wouldn’t ask you to sit in a wardrobe.”
“Yes, anything. Just never leave me.” Harry grabbed his hand.
Harry hadn’t been sure what to expect, but this reminded him of Dumbledore’s office. He loved it and wanted to look over every piece.
“What was it like to kill someone?” Ben asked.
“Hey.”
Harry quickly agreed.
Draco snorted with a breathless laugh. “Really Potter. I’m a damn fine actor. If I hadn’t, you wouldn’t have owned the Elder wand and been able to kill that utter bastard.”
Ron pulled Hermione closer, as pale as his girlfriend, who said, “no,” with a horror filled voice.
Dr. Stride quickly interrupted. “Of course, we agree with Tawy completely, raised as you both were, in those environments certain things we can overlook.”
Harry looked through the box. “Wow, you must have every color ever, one’s that smell, one’s that stamp, mixed colours.” The box seemed never ending. He picked a marker, “here Draco look,” he pulled off the cap and then scribbled on the huge pad, “it’s for drawing and coloring. You make pictures with them.” Harry hadn’t seen one in years. He’d used some partly dry regular ones in primary school, but markers weren’t something he’d ever gotten at home. Dudley had them when they were kids of course but he hadn’t given them to Harry until they’d run out of ink. The pad of paper was far too huge to hold and work with the markers. Harry dropped the pad onto the floor in front of the sofa and followed with one of the marker boxes.

Rey looked up from his book. “Ben, they actually have
“Just us.” Harry replied, “Can we have some chips and soda?”
Mandy hefted her bag higher on her shoulder. “I bet my sister is already here. She gets here pretty early.”
Draco shoved the destroyed apples onto the tray.
“Dumbledore was Headmaster and Snape was at Hogwarts as well, all the children learned from them.” Molly spoke up.
Draco ignored her and turned towards the shocked Healer. “We want to leave.”
Blaise side-eyed Pansy and said, “We mean they love you, but they seriously lack the skills parents need.”
Harry pondered it, “likely, but not without Tawy asking about it.” They might get time with their wands every day, but it wasn’t time alone.
“Oh, I see, but they’re fun, aren’t they?”
Neither said anything for several minutes.
“You can hardly control the press,” Draco gave her a small smile.
Harry blushed while Draco grinned. “Really?”
Harry didn’t even identify who had called out, just that the whispers of agreement moved quickly around the room, but even they puttered off into shock when Harry laughed. He chuckled even as he said, “do you honestly think that Dumbledore didn’t know? Really? The man knew when you farted and you think he didn’t know Malfoy was working on the fucking cabinet?” Harry straightened and said in an eerie reminder of Dumbledore, “sometimes young Mr. Potter awful things have to happen and we have to let them so the next stage may occur.” Harry scowled.
Across from her, Ron swallowed his food quickly. “Who?”
It was then that Harry caught his first sight of Malfoy since the final battle. He smothered his gasp, though it wouldn’t have been heard over all the other sounds people made.
Harry nodded to Anthony, rather like he was thanking the boy for mentioning it.  “He also left Poppy the remedy for the necklace’s poison and since he’d been ordered to kill Rosmerta the fact that he didn’t, nor had her commit any serious crimes says something, doesn’t it?” Harry answered with narrowed eyes and, having no response, Anthony looked away, “Malfoy held someone under the imperius for a whole year and yet, never used that power on any of you.”
The Judges took a few moments behind their wall of silence to discuss the Malfoy’s sentences. Judge Fumeurs took a moment to send a court official out of the room. When they removed the wall and began the sentencing, it was pretty much as Harry figured, though Ron was seething.
“It doesn’t matter,” Romilda offered, “if you’re caught, it’ll only lead to me and” she shrugged, “it’s nothing I don’t deal with often enough. Just don’t hurt anyone with it. Promise me, Harry.”
“Then we do this now,” Harry was absolute, he put his hand over Draco’s, calming the twisting fingers.
Harry swallowed. “Did she first and then he?”
Hermione stopped with him, “Harry?”
Harry followed her to the upstairs hallway, he watched her pace, unsure of what she wanted.
Lucius scowled at the newest missive from his barristers. He didn’t want to settle. He wanted that rag’s building burnt to the ground. He shoved the whole thing aside and picked up the latest from his ‘friends’ in the ministry. It seems there were fractions, underling and hiding with the ministry's infrastructure. His son and Potter were in the middle of power struggles that would spell out the future for the whole Wizarding world and he doubted if they even knew it.
Harry shook his head. “Not like you,” He stood as Draco fused over him, pulling his shirt out, and unbuttoning it. Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair and Harry patted it down.
Harry waited for Draco to say something, but he didn’t. Harry bit his lip, unsure what to say. Draco sighed and needed both hands to bring his hair to either side of his neck. Harry closed his eyes for a second, pained at the sight of half-moon lines marking either side of Draco’s neck. He touched carefully, under his fingertips was the same feeling as when he touched his own neck. He’d never seen his before, but he imagined they looked exactly the same. He traced the half-circle on either side of Draco’s neck, curving around the bones of his spine. Harry pulled his fingers back. They sat quietly, staring into the room.
Ron looked across to Harry and the poor mate looked all upset about it. “Harry it just wasn’t meant to be. We’re still best mates, always will be, but as far as dating goes, we’re done.”
Harry gave her a tight smile for her support. Technically they didn’t even have to be here. Only Harry was routinely called in by the Wizengamot and they could always floo him in when they needed, but Harry didn’t feel right about not being here.
.” A can of soda exploded in the corner.
“I told them he was tearing my mind apart and all they wanted to know was what I could tell them.”
“Boys,” Tawy called out as she approached. She held out a pouch to each of them. “Quite a lot for one day boys.” She also handed Draco a card which he slipped into his pocket, along with the pounds.
Murphy nodded. “That would upset anyone, Ella. How did you handle it?”
Draco straightened, “Nor was mine.”
Harry shrugged. “No idea,”
“17, Henry,” she called back. Henry was old enough…well old enough. She rolled her eyes. “Right, I have to get back to the bar. Let me know if you need anything and I’ll keep an eye out for a tall ginger.”
Draco wanted to try sooner rather than later, “better to know now if we have to try something else,” he whispered to Harry as they followed the group towards the library.
Next to Ginny, Hermione shook her head, “Damn-it, why didn’t I just help him protect Malfoy.”
“I want to make it plainly clear, I had nothing to do with any of those movies.” Pansy threw out.
Harry sighed, relaxing. His hand brushed over the hair at the back of his neck, he bit his lip. He hadn’t shown it to anyone. But maybe…before he could change his mind, he leaned forward and pushed up his hair. His movement caught Draco’s attention and he felt more than heard the gasp the other boy let out. Then there was a careful finger tracing the half-moon scars on either side of his neck. Draco made a hurt noise that Harry barely heard over his loud breaths. The finger left, and Harry blinked fast before he turned his head to look at Draco.
Andromeda concurred and nodded to her head solicitor, who stepped up, “we contend any wrong doing on young Malfoy’s part is a direct result of the Ministry’s negligence.”
“First allow me to state for the record, the Auror involved with the child’s memory archive,”
“Yes.”
“What do you want?” Harry folded his arms and leaned back into his chair. Oddly enough he could show this trust because he believed Malfoy would back him.
Draco scoffed, but he blushed as he shut the door.
Harry couldn’t help but see his disappointment. “It wasn’t a movie. It was everyone you loved hurting. It was being so filled with pain and fear, every moment that they could die in front of you.”
Murphy nodded. “But you need the key. I got it, no worries.”
“Yep.” Harry nodded, the long white strands running though his fingers. “I’ll help keep it out of your way. I can learn lots of braids and stuff.”
Draco shook his head, “Me leaving you is
Tawy coughed and when the women looked at her, Tawy glared.
“How would I know? I was here during the war.” Ben shot back.
Neville shrugged, “I don’t think they’ll have a choice. Once Harry realizes it’s his only way out, his only way to see us. I think he’ll demand it.”
Draco wished he could think of something to stall but there was nothing for it. He followed Potter and the woman out. When they reached the hall, light blue arrows appeared over the floor. The Healer smiled, “They you go boys, your schedules are the same, so you’re set.”
“Let’s go talk to Mandy, see if we can’t figure something out.
“It’ll be very bad for us cause if anyone besides their friends see them. We’re going to have very large wizard problem.”
“Yes. I understand the sigil has something to do with marriage and that’s something they’d want.”
“Of course.”
Teddy was over the moon when he got his Hogwart’s letter.
Draco shrugged, “I’m going because Potter is. They can get stuffed for all I care.”
“You knew?” Harry asked.
“Hogwarts Teddy, we know you got the letter and we want to know, do you want to go?” Sev smiled to soften the hard question.
Mandy grabbed a hot chip, “Sure thing sis.”
Hermione scowled, “I looked it up during my short lapse of insanity, dating you.” She nudged him with a smile to take out a little of the sting.
Once the transfiguration was complete, at her age she couldn’t just throw herself to the floor as the boys had done. She watched for a few minutes. They were just so into their play. It was nice. She wondered how long it had been since they’d played at all. “Okay Draco, I’m going to put a privacy shield up for Harry and me. Please keep colouring and I’ll be right with you.”
Draco blinked and then slowly relaxed into the hold.
“I’m sorry Poppy, what was that?” Molly inquired to the whisper.
“Why are we the ones that always get the most fucked up shite?”
He nodded to the question, “I’m well.”
to protect Malfoy. The only reason Mrs. Malfoy lied about my death was in order to find him. Malfoy pretended not to know who we were, knowing it could cost him his life. He
Harry blushed. “Thanks.” Draco managed it without blushing, Harry was jealous.
Draco raised an eyebrow but he smiled and it wasn’t a sneer or smirk. He looked over Neville's level of fitness, “So do you.”
allowed a child to be put at risk.”
She believed him, whatever he was sorry about, he really was. She ached to comfort him, he looked so wounded, but she left it to Harry as he seemed to have the job well in hand.
Even their meetings with her changed, they no longer wanted her to shield them from the other. She hadn’t been sure about that, afraid they would hide or be unwilling, but it was the opposite. They seemed more willing to let her into whatever topic they were tackling that day.
Harry shuttered. “Thank you.”
Harry wanted to argue but decided with flash of thought that maybe Draco was right. Maybe he had been trying to give Draco the out he couldn’t have for himself. Damn they were fucked up, he shook his head.
Ella frowned, “I’ve just never seen anything like this. I’m not trying to, I don’t know, mean anything.”
Draco shrugged. “I know.”
Tawy didn’t give him the time to consider going back to comfort her as his sleeve was taken and she apparated them.
Fumeurs paused now, lowering the parchment and peering down to Draco.
“He spoke to the aurors, a lot, from what I understand.”
Once they got closer, Ron’s bluster lost its sail. Hermione, without thought, rested her hand on Pansy’s arm. “What’s happened?”
Harry found if he tapped the bracelet it would lead him though a menu and then give directions to where he chose. He brought them to the library. Malfoy was kind-a quiet and withdrawn. Harry didn’t know what to do with that. He didn’t like it. He picked a table towards the back and hidden in the stacks, hoping they’d be left alone. He carefully removed all the newspapers from the table, without looking at them. He grabbed a random book and sat, while Malfoy perused the shelves. Harry noticed that he didn’t wander far and not out of Harry’s sight, which he appreciated. Malfoy wandered back with a book about potion making and Harry couldn’t hide his grimace.
Tawy (giving Draco all of her attention) waved him off. “It’s alright. He’s just not awake yet.” Softer tone, “Come on Draco, you’re okay, let’s see those lovely eyes.”
“Mandy,” Murphy barked.
“Hello boys,” Tawy called out from her open office door, “let’s get an early start. Come along.”
Hermione gasped and reached up to him. “Please Harry no more,”
“No?” Ben asked, “but then what’s the hubbub about? He just threatened it.”
hdhdhdh
She looked to Draco, who nodded. “Much clearer, thank you.”
“When?” Draco asked.
Charlie heard the door and went that way, but mum beat him to it. He’d been hoping for Harry but Hermione was just as good. She bustled into the house like a wind of change. She gave him a hug that warmed his heart. Charlie followed her back into the living-room where she greeted everyone. Hermione saved Ron for last, wrapping an arm around his shoulders as she stood next to his chair. Charley didn’t hear her say anything but Ron trembled and turned into her. He watched as she was able to turn Ron’s hug of desperation into alright. It looked like a skill she’d perfected. When she turned back to the room, Ron’s chair turned with her, she sat on the arm, her arm wrapped around his shoulders.
Harry looked into the pouch, “not really. Plus, I would have to have it switched over to pounds.”
Draco’s eyes went distance for a moment and he sighed. “I have a lot of practice with Imperius now.” Though saying that seemed to weigh on him. “I throw it off, immediately if I don’t want it and sooner rather than later if I do.”
Stunned, Minerva leaned back into her chair. She blinked and took a deep breath, “we didn’t have a choice Healer Robertoun.”
“It’s real soda, try it.” He smiled, nodding.
“Mr. Potter,”
situation. They’re infamous,” The man shook his head as he looked towards the door, “looks like the press has found out.”
Mandy narrowed her eyes at them and leaned towards Ben, the two trading whispers. Rey closed his book and Clara inched her chair from the two empty ones, on the other side Ella did the same.
Tawy nodded to her, even if she hadn’t heard the girl approach.
Clara giggled. “I think you had better give it up Ella. They look entirely into each other. Potter hasn’t even looked at you. No matter how much you tighten your shirt.”
Neville grinned. “Boy, look at him, the spitting image of his mom.”
Andromeda’s anger staggered under her surprise, “they’re,”
Ron sighed, “Yeah George. I’ll back Harry.”
“He’s gone?” Molly asked, but it looked to Harry as if she already knew the answer.
Had Harry known about the camera taking the picture, he might have given a two-finger salute to finish the task. As it was, Harry was too nervous to wonder about how Draco looked sneaking into Gringotts two hours before they normally opened. Harry didn’t think he’d ever be comfortable in Gringotts again. He apologized to nearly every goblin that came close enough until Draco stopped him.
Tawy tossed the empty vial to Helen as she caught Draco and eased him onto the bed, “there we are young one. Looks like it’s been a far while since you’ve had a good sleep.” She lifted his feet and deftly removed his shoes before throwing the soft blanket over him.  “Alright let’s get started, he’s going to be groggy when he gets up. I want to give him as much time as we can before we take him back. Call in Vos and Sentez the more the merrier, tell them we’re doing a full workup.”
“We’ve got a problem.” Blaise sung another chair to their table, “read it.”
“It doesn’t work that way Draco. Explain it to me, I’ll listen.”
“He made me sit on his lap sometimes. When he called me pretty, my skin crawled and they told me not to upset him.”
Harry didn’t stop frowning. Draco resisted smiling, having a hero was a little embarrassing but it was also sort-of nice.
“Normally,” Healer Murphy began, “we'd start new members off with an introduction. However, in this case, I think we’ll skip that.”
She pondered while Helen traded him potions back and forth with the soda, “we’ll just put his robes on over the scrubs. He’ll be fine and more comfortable. He’s going to be too sensitive for those clothes anyway. Is that alright with you Draco?”
“She brings Mandy all her magazine subscriptions, how can she not know who we are?”
It was at that point Hermione and Ron came into the room, which ended the ladies’ conversation. Harry sighed and stretched as he let Ron ‘wake’ him up.
“That’s like the 50
People had started talking louder the moment they’d sat down. Harry could hear their names among the noise. “Do you think we have to sit here?”
time, she’s said to stay away from wizarding places.” They turned to see Mandy shaking her head, “Like my sister would take you to the middle of Wizarding London and sell you to the highest bidder.”
Neville turned, “Come on you lot, we’ve got to save the golden trio.”
“Got your bands here.” She held up two thick bracelets as she approached, “these will give you directions. Your schedules are programmed into them and arrows in the hallways will point you where to go.”
Draco nodded, “Perfect. Thanks Harry,” He ducked down and kissed Harry’s cheek, turning away as he stood. “One of the dark and one of the light. Also the matching toiletry bags and wallets.”
“If she’s on the floor up, how do we even go about asking her?” Harry figured the worst she could do was say no.
Harry shrugged. “I’m no master, not nearly as talented as Draco, but I can hold my own.”
Draco had always felt comforted by the shadow his mother cast over his thoughts, smoothing down his terror. He’d always attempted to hang onto his mother’s Imperius for as long as he could. He took a puff and felt his shoulders untense a little as he released the smoke. He glanced to Harry, who look heavy-lidded and rather comfortable.
The Judge’s chambers were more populated than Harry had counted on. He wasn’t sure why they were even there. Molly had some idea that they were called in to speak up on Mrs. Tonks’ behalf and ability to care for Draco. Harry wasn’t sure why that meant
Violet felt awful. She knew if they were in with Mandy that something horrific and traumatic must have happened to them and here she was grabbing at them. “I’m so sorry.”
“How are they?” Neville could barely wait until they were seated.
“You’re really going back?”
The male Auror growled and came into the cell with his wand raised. Draco absently wondered why, none of them had a wand nor was stupid enough to move against him. The Auror moved quickly, grabbing Draco’s arm harshly. He yanked, and Draco stumbled, as his parents spoke with fast clipped words. Draco couldn’t focus on what they were saying. The very thought of someone ripping through his memories shutting him down.
Harry stood. “Let’s go move some food around.”
Andromeda studied the pictures and twisted her fingers, “I believe, and I’m not certain, but the longer it takes to build the bond the deeper the bond.”
Mandy nodded. “Yeah, it’s usually not a problem.”
“While I agree, the ideals he was taught were harmful,” McGonagall paused with a sad sigh, “I believe Andromeda has more concrete issues. She never spoke to me, but I believe she spoke to Albus. I think he helped her as much as he could, as far the law would allow. Albus was very invested in Draco’s future.”
Harry shrugged, darted forward and kissed him. “Yes, because every time I see people get frightened, I remember you’re as hard to hurt as I am. You’re my equal. I pretend to be your hero, but I know if I don’t catch you, you’ll find a way to save yourself.”
Harry shook his head. “Draco we can’t shop all day. We’ve got to send the owl.” Since Mandy only had one owl, they decided to send it to Hermione and hope she could gather the others.
They all turned to see more reporters trying to mash in with the ones who’d been there since the beginning. The reporters ate their lunch where they worked, unwilling to leave and they were making it hard for the new comers to find places. Some of them even sounded foreign, French and American accents fighting with a London paper for a ‘prime’ place.
She waved a hand at the port key. “The Ministry.” A part of her wanted to lower her tone even if she knew the whole Burrow was furious with the Ministry and wouldn’t reprimand her.
It wasn’t as concise an explanation as she’d like but she thought it was likely as close as she was going to get. It was obvious the sigil didn’t have any immediate adverse effects or at least none they didn’t like or want. “Alright.” Demanding inquires would likely only cause them to pull away and influencing a sigil was not recommended at all.
“You never played the muggle?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m hoping the novelty would have worn off for them.”
Harry waved a hand.
Harry dropped his head onto Draco’s shoulder, “good.”
“Not by choice.”
Hogwarts (in conjunction with the Ministry) made the effort to ‘help the public heal’, by offering several groups, circles, and opportunities to make private appointments.
“Can you resist Imperius?” Rey asked, a little bolder with curiosity.
Tawy nearly swallowed her tongue and heard gasps of awe when Draco flew unaided. She thought the match nearly won when Draco launched an attack mid-flight, his expelliarmus disarming Harry. Draco caught Harry’s wand, though Harry’s wandless casting of the same spell had Draco’s wand shooting into his palm. Switching wands did not stem nor constrict the battle as neither boy seemed to be handicapped using the other’s wand. Tawy made note of this significant fact.
Draco added. “We weren’t important because of us. We were important because of what they wanted from us.”
She left and Tawy reached into her robes. “I know I told you to stay away from wizarding places, but just in case.” She pulled out their wands. “It’s against the rules but take them and only use them if you absolutely have to. The minute you use them the ministry will know exactly where you’re at. Things might get sketchy from there. Understand?”
“I don’t understand. I’m the bad guy, why?” Draco broke off and dropped his head onto Harry’s shoulder.
Clara giggled. “She just wants to hash out Potter and stare at Malfoy.”’
Draco just wanted this over with and wouldn’t have cared how he felt if it meant getting this done. He thought perhaps the sleepy feeling was actually rather welcome considering. It helped with the nervousness and made his fear rather distant. He stood slowly, thankful for Bear’s steady hand, “I would very much like to continue your Honor.”
They walked down the hallways, not even noticing the looks as they walked by, nor the people that thought to try and talk to them, walking by before most could form the words, and ignoring the ones that did. Their heads bent together, chatting softly.
Judge Fumeurs sighed unhappily, “Continuing onward, I wish your report had been of some surprise Healer, but unfortunately his condition is much as we had predicted.” He nodded to Andromeda, who nodded back with a look of vindication. The Judge straightened, “well let’s not keep him waiting.” He waved his hand and it was announced, “The court calls forth His Grace Duke of Black, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry took a gulp of Draco’s soda. Draco figured they had to be something like friends because he only thought of smacking Potter for a moment.
Harry’s grin widened to show more teeth.
There seemed to be no end in sight until Harry sent a spell that while not strictly illegal certainly toed the line of being nearly so. It sent Draco flying back towards a wall, which the boy flew out of, but had he not, he might have been badly hurt. The next spell of Draco’s wasn’t nearly illegal, it was.
All the times he had berated himself for caring about what Potter thought, about losing his chance at Potter’s friendship and this had been waiting for him. Merlin he was such a fucking idiot. “Potter listen to me. You can’t leave me either. If I let you in, if I do this, then you can’t, can’t leave me, cause if you do…well I don’t know,”
“I heard you,” Harry spun around to see Draco.
“Release him,” barked a razor-sharp command from the Healer, which froze everyone. She walked towards the Auror still gripping Draco, “I said
Ben moved a few feet away, where Ella and Rey were already giving them space.
Tawy nodded. “Alright, that’s a good place to start. You’ve taken the cure and so the connection has been severed. You are old enough now that you would notice if it were ever attempted again.” She could see neither really understood. Draco accepted her words with a nod and Harry seemed only to accept them because Draco did. She raised her wand and conjured a tube, allowing it hover. “Image that magic enters from the world and into you, threw a tube like this.” The tube alit with a golden light, “now imagine every magic user has such a tube, but the size is different for everyone,” the tube grew and shrunk as she spoke, “as you can see, that means everyone has a different amount of magic they can use at one time. Now, when a magic user turns 11 that tube expands to its final size.”
She smiled, and Harry was thrilled to let Malfoy talk for the both of them.
Draco swallowed thickly, mentally screaming at the idea of being forced to spend time with only his night terrors for company. He was powerless. The court commanded he do this and if he didn’t, they might put him in Azkaban. They might take the manor or their vaults or they might lock his parents up. He had no choice. He
People were really squirming now and several looked downright queasy.
Draco nodded, glancing to Harry, who wandered among the floating displays with a look of awe.
Harry walked in just as Hermione asked, “You got tons…of pens?”
“Really?” Ella replied. “I didn’t know if that was true. That’s so cool!” She smiled at him daintily, flipping back her long black hair.
Harry sighed, unable to remember a time when his wants had ever mattered and opened the door before he could change his mind. Thankfully Healer Murphy was already seated, and it looked like they were the last ones to show.
Ella eyed the table across the cafeteria. “I thought they were enemies.”
Draco glanced at Harry and decided fuck it. “Um, how did you,” he picked a lock of his long hair and starred at the end, turning it in his fingers, “how did you know?”
Tawy smiled. “Thank you. I’ll have the appointments placed on your bracelets. We can have some time together and separate.” Neither boy objected so she lifted the journals. “I’ve got one for both of you. I want you to write/draw in it at least once a day. You can write your thoughts, nightmares, your dreams, write some letters. No one will see it but you and me, and me only when I have your permission. I will not hold anything said against you nor allow you to be prosecuted for it. Just whatever comes into your head, it doesn’t have to be complete or pretty. Bring it with you to our appointments. Please.” She left the journals on the table.
“We’ll pay for the damages.” Harry slipped off Draco’s bed but stood next to it.
“Yes, an oversight that happens more than it should. May I eat my muffin now.”
“See something like this before then?” Ben asked, moving into the room that must be only slightly smaller than the one they stayed in.
Minerva leaned forward, “Molly, there will be no ‘working’ on that boy,” she set her tea aside, “Tawy made it very clear she would not tolerate anything of that nature. Also, I don’t believe Harry will be allowed to other student’s homes for any breaks. It would be best not to extend the invitation.”
Harry blinked. “What do you mean? I went in and claimed my parent’s vaults. The goblins didn’t say there was anything else.”
. Apparate to the manor. Run with his parents to Paris, where the Ministry would have no choice but to leave them be.
Harry shrugged. “Pretty much.” He just wanted to take Draco back to their room and take nap. Instead he resigned himself to whatever they wanted to know. He slumped back next to Draco.
The taller boy frowned, “What is it?”
Hermione rolled her eyes even as she grinned, proud of her other best friend. They might not be dating anymore but that didn’t change the fact that she loved him dearly and always would.
“And that isn’t going to change, shocking things are a part of their lives. They’ve accepted those shocking things as part of who they are. Even better they know those things don’t define them. I don’t see any reason to keep them here. Besides, as it was pointed out last staff meeting, their presence upsets the order here. Everyone is distracted, including staff. I’ve had to take away an unprecedented amount of contraband. Stuff smuggled in here for the sole reason of getting pictures or information about them and some of that from staff. The boys can continue their work in Hogwarts. At least there the staff and most of the students are used to them. Where there are more people actively attempting to protect them and not sell any part of them.”
Tawy asked some more questions or made comments but mostly just listened. She tapped his hand, when he realized he’d been quiet a little while and looked up from his forest. She smiled at him, “Thank you Harry. I’m going to talk to Draco now, you just keep working ok?”
Heidi smiled. It very much resembled a predator seeing dinner. “We were not retained by the Ministry and if they, and by they-I mean you, could have handle the matter, it would no longer be one. Hence, it’s my turn.”
Draco listened carefully at the library doors but heard no one. He opened the door slightly and slipped in, slid against the wall and closed the door softly behind him. He didn’t see anyone but had the sense he wasn’t alone. He’d learned to trust that feeling and didn’t turn on any lights. He used the dim light from the early dawn that streamed through the shear part of the blue curtains to look around. He moved around one of the long shelves and spotted the dance of a candle’s light against a far wall. Draco would have never seen it, had he been taller or hadn’t come just this way. He nearly left.
“Yes,” Tawy replied, her voice crisp with worry. She turned her eyes towards the floor where, between the two beds, the boys sat stonily.
“We talk about it,” Harry whispered.
“Healer Murphy mentioned some wand exercises.”
“They do look quite fetching on you darling,” Narcissa added her support, before calling to the house elf.
Hermione’s eyebrow crinkled in confusion, “Sir?”
Harry chuckled. “Hermione’s hair was never this long, but I like it, it’s calming.”
“Here you go,” Ella dropped the paper in front of Mandy.
Tawy nodded, “I need to know what you know of it.”
“Pot.” Tawy replied, heading back to her viewing spot.
Lucius dropped his head and looked away, “We think maybe he has his reasons.”
Neville snorted. “We’re parents hence gross.”
Harry recognized the voice and turned to see George bustling from around the building, the redhead waved as he ran up, “came in at the backyard, thought I’d missed you,” he huffed, “sorry.” He hugged Harry tightly.
“That will not be a problem. Also don’t worry about feeding us, we’ll take care of that as well.” Draco smoothly added.
“I think we’re done.” Harry stood. He reached out for Malfoy and was gratified when Draco grabbed his wrist and allowed himself to be pulled up. “Don’t ask things you don’t really want the answers to.”
