I dug my nails into the skin of Harry’s back in an attempt to make sure he got impossibly closer and he simply pressed me closer to him as he started to take my face by the curve of my cheek in his hand, angling my head up so he could press more of his soft kisses over the entire expanse of my face starting with my forehead then my nose and then to my cheeks and chin.
Harry and I had been busy with taking down Animadverto and getting me reacquainted with my new found skills by controlling my magic better throughout the process. Hezian had offered me the job after the Anidmadvero’s infiltration mission was a success.
I loved playing the card games my comrades set up during the parties, surely this spring break celebration would have that.
Harry gave me a frown as those eyes of his turned more into a ruby red in the face of his sudden displeasure.
The way my magic had a mind of its own in seeking out another’s with the intention of eating it whole for itself was something I couldn’t control, and I didn’t want to. It felt so fucking stimulating.
When the Gryffindor had tightened his hold around my neck at the same time he fucked his cock in a particularly cruel stab into me that brought me bodily up the table with a silent scream, Harry had brought his front a bit further down my back to tip me on my side, cock dragging deliciously out of inside of me with a burning embedding that left me
My body dragged up the marbled floor, mouth popping open to release a startled squeak and a hiss when the impact of Harry’s palm practically felt like a crack of lightning striking down into the ground, harsh and fast and fucking
a demon. And surely it had a master to call upon to keep themselves alive and be of use without said master killing them.
Staring down into the reflection of the wall to wall bathroom mirror in front of me, I let my eyes soak in the circular structure of the mark, a mixture of a dark tar black like substance and the beginning shades of an amethyst hue color mingling together with the caliginous tone. Designs foreign to any regular human eye circled, stretched, overlapped, and curved with one one another in a variety of cluttered lines within the etched sphere on my skin.
take slow deep breathes for me. Come on.” Harry spoke closer now, the shadow of his voice a deep rasp leveled out into a smooth fluctuation that had every tense line in my body immediately giving way and relaxing at the rigidity that was there just a few seconds ago.
I was supposed to go about this with Harry anyway, so the fact that the time for my dark magic to suffice came closer than intended was something I couldn’t stop from happening.
The guard reminded me of Goyle and he didn’t give me a sense of uneasiness, just cautiousness. “I’m Draco Malfoy. I’m here to give an envelope to Albon Trisko.”
I kept on rambling. A ball of suffocating tension filling my chest and aching there as I breathed raggedly against the wall with weakened limbs, the backs of my widened eyes burning with the sensation of forcing back the salty water that I could feel build up and start to blur the fast blinking of my nervous gaze.
And with that, I was lifted up easily from my waist and hauled onto the large plush black couch, Harry’s body above mine as my own bounced off the cushions slightly, my body jolting in pain from my arse pressing against the cushions.
Pushing myself up with a graceful flourish that I didn’t even expect out of myself, I straightened my back only to sneer down at the two men still sitting casually in their seats, voice cold and venomous as I hissed at them both. “You guys are a bunch of immature arseholes who get off on making other people look like fools. Give me the damn edibles,
I jerked back, my body’s initial reaction to such a quick movement causing the skin on my arms to rise in dread and awe as Harry leaned the sharp and handsome features of his face down to meet my gaze at eye level and raised the heart in his hand in the tiny space he created between our almost flush bodies.
The crowd surrounding us was doing nothing but staring on in a mixture of horror, peculiar interest, and muted hate.
To the front of the foyer, where the large entrance doors to the mansion resided, stood the tall, looming, lean and muscled figure of Harry Potter’s frame. His towering body blending into the dark of the mansion as the silhouette of his frame was unnervingly still, the pitch black strands of his unruly hair seeming to soak in the tenebrous air surrounding him as the eerie, terrifyingly beautiful glow of his ruby, emerald coated gaze hummed within the black of the night closing in on us.
Caetia, the git, clutched his fingers harder into the skin of my arm before abruptly pulling me with a simple flick of his wrist and elicited my body to be swept sideways in a half spin straight towards the bundled, sweat slick mass of people, my high heel covered feet stumbling over one another as my eyes widened in a burst of panic when I felt my front collide into a man unfortunately nearest to my clumsy person.
Both the Carbonou and the people that they had been feasting mindlessly on were flayed apart, the skin of their flesh having been burnt around the outline of their peeled back skin, introducing the display of their innards that had been spilling forth out of gouging holes that eerily reminded me of a beehive, all hollowed out although with their guts trailing through the indentations of their punctured bodies. Their insides were oozing across the floor in a sickening heap, spreading out around their scorched bodies, some limbs strewn about and torn from their torsos to leave a cesspool of rotting human meat and a river of crimson blood and pitch black liquid.
Hearing Harry, someone whom I’ve had an obscene crush on for the past good few years, tell me about my body, my personality, and talking about how beautiful I was in that lull, deep tone of a voice that the assassin had, made some weight that felt pressured upon my skin like an ungodly self hatred, sift away from the trembling of my limbs and release a little of its suffocating hold on my conscience.
I sobbed all over Harry like some sort of ogre, relinquishing my frustration with myself in a bout of cries. Harry still hugged me to him all the while as if I was the most precious and fragile thing he’s ever gotten to touch.
The stupid bodyguard I met wasn’t standing at the front entrance this time, but another one was, and I thanked whatever deity for that.
There was no news in the Daily Prophet about the so called “murders” that the fake Kingsley had told me about.
Whipping my bewildered gaze back up at Harry, I leaned back in shock, jerking on the spot at the sudden close proximity of the assassin’s body, closing in on me with a terrifyingly dark manner at the way his features seemed to morph into a sinister curl of the lip at his mouth, the energy of his body violent in the wake of his power seeming to slip out of his skin and spindling their way towards my own.
I willed my body to move, heat sufficing all along my already sweat slick limbs as I walked around the chair Harry lazed back in, gaze stayed on the man as I breathed out a trembling sigh while the singer’s voice rang in my flushed ears.
My lips opened wide to emit no cadence of a sound as my body jerked in Harry’s hold, electricity winding and shooting down into the pit of my gut as my mouth flapped silently in surprised, rousing wake.
Blaise must have noticed this, even when I barely let my annoyance show forth with both Pansy and him, they knew the small indications to my anger since I allowed it to bleed through my facial features around them to give them a warning about my simmering rage that could worsen if they kept doing whatever they were doing to piss me off.
The head brushed my prostate immediately and I spasmed on the spot, a weak wail ripping out of my mouth as shots of pleasure and heat went off like fireworks inside of my stomach, flesh heating up like a damn furnace as I tightened my legs around Harry’s hips despite how frail I felt at the moment.
Caetia, for once, let a smirk play across his gorgeous feature then, the flecks of his molten eyes shimmering with an unknown mischief that I couldn’t quite understand, as if he knew something I didn’t or just came up with a diabolical plan. It looked odd on the rather elfen like features of the boy. “Actually. If you want to go have some fun with a guy, go for it. You only live once right and I’m sure you’ll be fine. This club is very exclusive and won’t have anyone coming in that would bring potential harm to you.”
I dragged the top edges of my teeth over the wobbling flesh of my bottom lip, catching the skin and digging my teeth into the curve of my lip to drag it into my mouth in a nervous habit of mine.
When Harry turned left, causing the bike to lilt sideways, my breath whooshed out of me in frantic exhilaration at the notice of my body moving along with it, my right hand snapping off of the bottom of the handle to reach back with a hyperactive tendency and searched, within a millisecond, for Harry’s knee so I could ground myself with the knowledge of someone here
in blood, the hard set of his jaw tense and spotted with specs of ruby red, flecking over the sharp curve of his cheekbones. The fabric of Harry’s jeans and long sleeve black shirt were darkened in certain areas, catering to the knowledge the blood had seeped through the material with the way it stuck to the lean and muscled frame of the Assassin’s threatening tall body.
Shaking my head, I brought my head forward to look down at the bags of clothes Granger got me, hearing the soft grumble of my stomach and huffing out in exasperation.
in agony as the demon forced my body to fall forward onto my stomach while the demon’s front pressed forebodingly against the line of my spine.
And the Gryffindor seemed to know this with the way he reacted. When I grabbed his knee and made my back bow like a rubber band with my bum squirming further against Harry’s hot cock unintentionally, my groin throbbing in adrenaline coveted arousal, the assassin’s chest shook with a subtle
I avoided Harry’s eyes with my own as I watched with avid interest how my feet shuffled about with nerves, the pulse of my heart pounding within the hot of my ears.
Harry released a put upon harsh sigh of defeat, features still set into a look of hard stone as he narrowed his eyes down at me in trepidation.
The party was placed within the hidden walls of the Gryffindor’s rooms. One of them being at the tip top, right above Granger’s dorm room.
“Hey man, I didn’t know he was taken. Your boy came in here with a white band and-” The brown skinned guy had his face pulled into an expression of cringing defeat and stress, lips pressing tight together as the line of his body went stiff with worry.
Kingsley slumped forward towards me, his mouth gaping wide as his limbs went noodle like and his body lurched sideways like a puppet without its master, thudding against the hardwood floor at the front of my feet as the heavy brightness of his eyes shifted into that of a dull shadow.
I saw from out of the corner of my eyes Granger’s lips tip up into a wry smile while Weasley nudged her frame with his arm wrapped around her. Granger replied with her voice soft and steady. “Don’t leave the room unless Potter is here. He has the key to the penthouse suite and we don’t want you walking out of the wards we put around the place in case of anyone potentially trying to harm you. See you then.”
“It’s been a long few days actually. I don’t think I've even slept for more than four hours without something interrupting me from doing so. I really am exhausted,” I murmured, giving Granger a chagrined smile.
I stood shocked, my mouth set into a neutral line except for the widened set of my eyes as I took in the the colorful celebratory decorations, quiet shocked for once at the abrupt invasion in the Weasley home that I thought would just be a small gathering of just Harry, Ron, Hermione and their kids to congratulate both Harry and I in taking down Animadverto together a week ago.
I had to keep myself from flicking my tongue out and suctioning my mouth around the long length of Harry’s smooth fingers while the need to ground my hardened prick and wiggle my bum to feel more of Neville’s hot hand and muscled legs was high as I tried to calm the beating of my heart and my harsh breaths.
WARNING: There is going to be the threat of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault in this chapter. But no rape. If you are uncomfortable with reading it you can always skip or not read the chapter, I don't want my readers to get triggered or uncomfortable, but it is up to them to read on.
Harry’s one, heated finger, was persistently crashing into my prostate, and I was becoming a wanton mess of dysfunctional moans and squealing as the vertebrae of my spine ground itself across the slick stone floor of the staircase with every inhumanely quick shove of Harry’s finger into my arse.
Harry brought down two plates from the shelves above my head, the movement causing his groin to nudge up against my bum and press me harder against the counter, a gasp leaving my wet mouth.
for me to say my next words, as if he has always been waiting for me to utter our intoxicated perdition. I said it with Harry’s hand around my throat, his body against my own, and his lips attached to my flesh, my tone reckless and oh so
I, on the other hand, what with having a large amount of interaction with Dumbledore’s death, was cast aside.
with a muffled intimidating growl that shuddered straight to my pulsating cock and had me tip my head back at the exact moment I came right then and there, my vision turning bright red and consuming me whole.
Blaise blanched at me from where he sat, the skin at the corners of his eyes crinkling as he narrowed his brown gaze down at me into a look of utter strained discontent. “Pansy was looking forward to helping you choose out an outfit tonight. You know how she loves it when you dress down. You’re going to make my damn girlfriend upset here if you don’t go. If you’re worried about looking good for the party, don’t be. I’m not gay but I know a pretty boy when I see one and trust me, you’re way
And having to be near Harry for a given amount of time was surely going to make my mind incapable of handling such a thing when I’m so fucking obsessed with the damn assassin!
“It seems you’re going to have to do a lot more than just go to the bank and hand us the money over, Draco.” Hezian’s voice filtered through the cloud of my thoughts then, causing my head to snap back towards Harry’s boss with a my brows furrowed in a look of confusion, my eyes catching the blue of Hezian’s as I stared back at him with my own silver gaze.
Well, I mean … the fact that I’ve got people to protect me felt nice, but it didn’t make matters easier with the thought that wizards were coming after me to murder my arse.
As long as I got to play a game of blackjack, then it should be worth it to discard my homework for a moment.
Ever since, BDSM had been something that I was truly interested in even though I’ve never experienced it myself. And I couldn’t really do anything about it since my reputation of being an ex death eater and a Malfoy to boot always made anyone think twice about associating themselves with me. How could I even get into the BDSM scene when no one wanted me, physically or mentally.
I whimpered out loud under the assault of Harry’s full dark attention, my face falling into a pained pathetic grimace.
I breathed out my shy whine into the quiet noise of the room, cheeks flushing as I realized the pure
I dropped the front of my forehead against the wall, mentally slamming my head into it from remembering how wrecked I became just a few moments ago from Potter's touch.
The fucker decided to swing his other arm sideways to catch my right thigh in a brutal punch that left me staggering on my own two feet, giving him enough leverage to snap his head out of the sudden weak grip of my fingers as I found myself falling sideways, my vision turning into a quiet blur while I felt the spine of my back collide against the cool floor with a steady drop.
The demon was too overloaded with power for it’s own good to think fast enough with all the energy it had.
I felt the right of Harry’s hand slide into the disarrayed strands of my pale locks at the back of my head, the long strong of his fingers splaying out as he gave a soft scratching motion over my scalp in a messaging fixation, slow and bringing about a weight that settled over my head and making me feel comforted and safe as I sat in Harry’s lap.
Here's the long awaited chapter. Sorry for the wait and delays, forgive me. But the story is still ongoing and not ever going to be dropped. Thank you to those who have been reading my story and giving me support and as well loving my work. Now go on and read. The next update is still yet to be pronounced because I have another story I'm working on. So an update should be coming sometime in October. And then plan to post up a new story and then an update shall appear for Tenebrous. Sorry for the delay, I hope you all understand!
“I’m what you would call a ‘Sinister’ as you Wizards like to name us. We’re one of the first demons to walk the earth and eat conduits of dark magic, but we do have our own names. You can call me
been wanting this for s-so long!” The last of my desperate words were cut off by the screech of my own voice when Harry held me immobile with his death grip to ease his finger out of my hole but with a blindingly fast motion that I couldn’t grasp onto with the prominence of my human mind, rammed his finger straight into my spasming pucker to drag the heat of his smooth appendage teasingly against my insides and smash into my prostate with malicious precision.
And he had a good reason staying, practically, in the middle of nowhere. People were nosy, especially when it came to the “Savior”.
for you. I will end up killing you if you and I grow more physically attached to one another. You will be the end of me, and I to you. I will push my entirety into you, the darkest, most vile parts of me and that will be your demise. We can
After the war, there was some part of me that liked helping people, the most human of my side needing to aid those in need of it. I had some good in me, very little of it though. And there was the cruelty that I couldn’t contain. So when I stumbled across an assassination program by simply asking nefarious criminalized groups of wizards on the run from those who hunted them about the people who came for them, I found my job and indulged in both the savior and damning thing that I was.
Kingsley lunged at me, a growl emitting from his throat. “Since you won't’ tell me, I’ll fuck it out of your sweet arse then.” He went to snap out his hands to grab at my shoulders, the action significantly fast, my mouth popping open to let out a gasp as I scrambled backwards from his touch, head spinning from my own swift reflex.
Black and red spots fired off behind my blurry vision, the breaths that had once rushed out of my lungs now a dull and weakened exhale. My chest shook beneath the onslaught of the now numbing pain plaguing my body, mind wandering ceaselessly away from reality as I started to blink in and out of my consciousness.
There were people in the same outfits like the floor above me, except I could tell which one’s were the submissives, dominants and versatiles with the color bands around their thumbs. I caught sight of the chart of the different colors of bands connecting to their specific person on the glass counter where Yevsky stood. White meant observer. Silver meant submissive. Crimson meant dominant and Azure meant versatile.
And I felt the heat soar back up into burning heights as it flooded my system and made my groin tingle in the warmth spreading over it and down my suddenly trembling thighs. My prick was rising with the filter of blood gathering there, my eyes getting large as I breathed through my nose to try and keep myself calm beneath the dark gaze of the Gryffindor’s.
I didn’t mind it, hell, people had the right to dress however they wanted to, but I was taught to keep barely any skin from showing and I preferred it that way, comfortable with my shield of clothes.
Furrowing my brows, I let my head drop back, the hair tie around my messy bun suddenly too much with its embrace circling over my blonde strands and causing my temple to thrum with an incoming headache.
Sucking in a sharp breath, the wavering of the air in my lungs stuttered as I rolled the flesh of my bottom lip into my mouth and looked up at Harry from beneath the pale of my lashes, a burn of embarrassment and exhilarated nerves flooding my system as I watched the way those crystalline eyes of the assassin’s dragged down to the way I brought my lip between my teeth.
“Shut it, Blaise. I can’t go. I have to make finishing touch ups on that potions project assignment tonight before I have to turn it in. So you and Pansy are going to have to go without me.” My tone had a breathy finality to it, decisive and blunt in the way I stared blandy back at Blaise, the game console in my left hand swaying slightly from where it hung in my almost limp grip precariously.
Harry stood absolutely still, the large of his body lax as he stared ahead with the red brown of his gaze seering into the large desk that Kevera settled behind as the goblin watched the debacle going on before him with a small smile of content severity.
My cock perked up in interest at the heady sensation, but a certain stricken terror overtook my conscience thought along with the burst of arousal.
it. Unless you want to drain that person of their dark magic for yourself and then have me kill them and take the rest of their magic for myself?” Harry’s voice dripped like sin from his upturned mouth, an ominous peaked interest intoning heavy in the deep rumble of the man’s voice.
The mess of my hair created disheveled wisps of blonde strands all over my shoulders, having produced a pale drape over my eyes and covering half of my face as I let a small tilt of my lips form, curving upwards to display a capricious shy yet vixen like grin.
Murmuring incoherent words beneath my breath, I padded barefoot across the cool wood of my floor, the tips of my fingers playing with the bottom hem of my shirt as I paced from one end of my apartment to the other, trying to figure out what happened between Potter and I. Why wouldn’t he tell me anything and why was someone faking to be the head Auror of the Ministry of Magic? Why was Potter going around killing people like he’s done it before, with no remorse or hesitation?
I simply watched Harry beneath the stricken round of my eyes, mortified at the notion that everyone I’ll be coming into contact with in the damn club will
” Draco’s words were cut off when I whipped his body down towards my hips in time with a sharp upward thrust of my pelvis against his arse. Princess’ once limp hands flew up in a staggering pace, the wet of his sweat dripping down the curve of his spine as I watched his red mouth mumble out rasping moans that grew in crescendo, rubbing his cheek against the ground frantically as he shook his head in disbelieving, overwhelming pleasure as his lips turned liquid in there sudden lax fissure. The slender of his shaking fingers snapped back behind himself to nestle the blunt of his erratic nails into the flesh of my hand that kept tugging his left leg away from his other, splaying him so fucking wide just to watch his pretty hole contract deliciously around my still ramming cock.
“That was rude.” Blaise stared at me blandly, the shade of his coffee hue smooth flesh practically glowing beneath the sun’s light spilling through the large floor to ceiling windows of the area we settled in, shimmering and brightened over the unblemish of his skin. The buzzcut of his umber tinted hair suited his tall muscled frame that loomed over the small, slim shape of my dainty figure.
It felt like the voice seeped into the very marrow of my bones so it could settle there and fester, directing itself straight into my mind.
Maybe Blaise wanted me to go to Astringent in hopes of making fun of me, to make jabs at how I lived my life now compared to his luxurious living, and most definitely would mock the way I look and my lack of intelligence even though I got better grades than the fool, helped him with his schoolwork, and graduated just like him.
The Slytherin seemed unhinged with the way another laugh shot out of his widened smile as he kept digging his way into the demon’s opened stomach with his bare hands and kept tearing at it’s intestines and fleshy meat one after another with quick successions.
Of Harry and what he was capable of. I was in fear of the way this man could break me, physically and mentally, but … I also craved it and liked the darkness that Harry carried around with him because I’ve lived with such terror my whole life, so it was a
Zereth stood shocked at my actions, the demon blinking down at the obvious hole that I created in his right side that led out to his left, large and unmistakably hurting as the traces of their black blood flooded out of their body almost like a waterfall.
“I need you to bring this edited manuscript draft to its author. The customer called up saying they were nearby and I said we would bring the papers his way. His name is Albon Trisko and he’s going to be in that famous nightclub a few blocks from here called
When the balls of my feet clashed with a leveled ground, my knees buckled the slightest bit, the air rushing past my lungs as I swayed from side to side, the wave of dizziness filtering through my head.
Instead, I heard a significant squawk of agony and wrenched my eyes open to stare down at a writhing, fallen vampire sprawled out over the freezing floor with his body twitching in a series of shivers. The curve of his jaw was dangling from its hinges, swinging back and forth with each violent shake of his paralyzed shape, grunting and giving out choked screams that had the entirety of the town looking on with gaping mouths of horror and confused awe.
Letting my hand drop away from Kikue’s, I made it apparent about my wanting to leave the presence of the host of this house and Harry with the way I had my eyes trail up to the second level of the mansion, my mouth opening once again to reiterate my intentions as I could feel Kikue watching me with open curiosity. “If you don’t mind, I’ll be leaving your company to search for Caetia.” My words came out breathy and quick but eluding with amicable manner.
I won’t let it get too far, and I’m sure Harry wouldn’t because he was so damn adamant on making sure that we would never be together.
am that object. Every sinister emotion that the death eaters felt were being fed into their dark magic, all the
The assassin’s jaw ticked hard, the muscles in the sharp of his cheekbones tightening and tensing in rapturous cruelty, eyes growing dark at the irises as the red and green seemed to pulsate together to create an almost pitch black gaze that gave nothing away, unpredictable and ominous.
Weasley always showed his emotions on his sleeves, his hot temper something that was rather amusingly shocking to me whenever he would snap. The redhead grew into having enough patience to not immediately fall into his old habits of pummeling into someone if a small insult or even a look was taken the wrong way directed towards him. But the Gryffindor was an open book with his feelings, face churling with words he couldn’t quite speak out loud with having the sudden lack of vocabulary in the face of his discomfort.
The Assassin looked down at me, brows raising up in a subtle gesture of a question as he intoned lowly to me. “I feel not a thing.”
Harry’s emerald eyes were trained on the boy snuggling up to him as I stood, motionless, with my heart plummeting into my gut and my throat closing up on itself with a heavy ball lodged up in my esophagus.
Harry had a mass amount of dead death eaters' dark magic mingling in with his own that literally fed off of emotions and energy, mostly the bad ones, and the
No one knew for fact that I killed Dumbledore, which I didn’t thanks to my godfather, Severus, having killed our headmaster in hopes of keeping me safe since I had refused to kill that old geezer and would be put to death by Voldemort if he found out that my mission wasn’t successful.
with me instead of the thoughts that surely were flooding his closed off brain from the mere mention of explaining how he came out to have this sort of job.
I squeaked out loud from beneath the hum of the music when my chest fell into the man before me, my eyes turning into large alien saucers when I felt the cool wet form of his skin rubbing up against the revealed flesh of my own peeking out from the rise of my top from the sudden shuffle I was put into with my body.
And Draco embodied the purest of someone that I wanted to see fall apart and get put back together, one piece by one devastatingly breathtaking piece.
But before I could wiggle my bum in hopes to get Harry to fill me up some more with that delicious hot prying tongue of his, the man had abruptly released me.
The air became drained from my very being, a conclusion starting to formulate in the weak of my legs and arms, my eyes drooping with a dead tiredness that felt like heavy lead in my veins, flooding and cluttering my esophagus with a teasing, malicious touch.
I didn’t have much time to think about what Harry was saying, because next thing I knew, Harry had moved in on me a blurring motion, releasing my neck swiftly to shove his shoulder into the fluttering of my stomach, causing me to give out a high pitched cry as I felt one of Harry’s warm hands slide up into the ripped slits of my leather pants to wiggle his four fingers into the torn fabric and cup the bare skin of my arse as he let his thumb reach around and press itself with a bruising force into the clothed flesh between of my inner right thigh.
I pressed my lips together, chewing on the insides of my cheeks as my body swayed to and fro with the turning motions of the motorcycle, taking both comfort and cautiousness in being near Harry for such a long time.
Being held under Kikue's critical eye made me hunch in on myself as a nervous tremble started at the curl of my fingers. But I still kept the blank character I held onto like glue upon my face.
A thunderous scream erupted from one of the creatures, like a disgruntled battle cry as it made a twitch of a motion towards Harry’s person, the bundle of its muscles bunching up like a strung up ball of rubber bands. But before the Carbonous could even move one of its deformed legs a centimeter, Harry let out the most hush of a snicker, so careless and easy and
The now clean tufts of Harry’s black hair was ruffled about over the arm of the couch, his lids lowered appealingly over his darkened green red eyes that scanned a book he magically conjured up that had a sci-fi cover, avidly reading and completely in his own world.
“When I tell you to do something, you do it. I’m not going to say it again. Give me a lap dance.” Harry’s deep monotone of a voice snapped me out of my haze of thoughts, breaths rushing out of my parted mouth as I looked up at the man from beneath the pale fan of my lashes.
You’re alright. Nothing is going to hurt you and I. We’ll get through this whole thing and figure out how to deal with this new found information about you. I’m not going anywhere, and you aren’t either.
But I do need to figure out what was happening to the dark magic I have in terms of keeping Draco safe and sound around me.
. Guess I’ll have to teach you another lesson.” The way Harry spoke with a low, rough grunt made the eerie calm he carried around with him seem to jostle and become ready to part and reveal the vicious, sinister air that I was
Harry watched me for a moment, his eyes wandering all over my face before he settled for looking up at the high ceiling instead of at me before he gave out a fast low response.
Leaping out of the mound of ruffled sheets on my bed, I disentangled my legs from around them so I could stumble on the soles of my feet as I tried to gain equilibrium with the sudden fast motion of my body so early in the morning. The harsh thudding of my confused heart slammed against my rib cage in a fit of nervous warmth at the thought of my skin being marked.
That potion I had let Harry inhale was one that centered around making someone sexually enhanced and charged. Like viagra but the drug effects flowed through every inch of your blood stream instead of just straight to your penis. It’s official name was the “Sex Enhancer” potion. I used this potion because of the side effects that it brought with it, which was fatigue and delirium which would do well to confuse and make the people drowsy in Animadverto’s facility. I just put a dollop of the drug induced potion into my own for that sole reason.
I remember specifically how Krum decided to “accidentally” push me down the Hufflepuff's set of stairs that led to the first level of Hogwarts. I didn’t attend the ball because father thought that it was useless and pathetic of me to associate myself with wizards below our level and forced me not to go. I had been minding my own business with my nose in one my potions textbook that night before I heard Krum yell out at me about being a pansy little bitch from beside me out of nowhere and found myself being shoved violently down the set of steps before flipping out my wand and casting a spell to hover my frame above the steps before my body would be damaged beyond belief.
In the end of every kill, there will be a shadow that follows, something cold and confusing and dark.
I found myself clutching my towel with the line of my back and arse smacking against the grey slate walls, the cool of the surface over my towel and the sudden stop of my retreating movements making me squeak out in a flush of crimson red.
My magic seemed to have a one track mind when it came to Draco Malfoy, and it was to cause the pretty boy to either go into his own dark manifestation with a helping hand or to drain him of the life force he carried around within that slim body of his.
How was I going to be kept out of harm’s way when Harry and the others are supposed to fight at the same time? And why does Harry not want me to speak around a Carbonou? The Gryffindor made it sound like if those creatures heard me, then I’d be in even more trouble.
with the way the red seemed to have spilled like the spreading of crystallized, blood stained diamonds over the jade of his eyes.
With my breaths coming out hard and chopped, my eyes whipped up to meet Harry’s as he let out a scoff before gripping my waist hard enough to leave crescent moon shapes of his blunt nails into my skin and letting the front of my frame slowly drag its way down the length of the assassin’s hard body.
I sat precariously atop of Erus’ hips, the bare flesh of my inner thighs touching the assassin’s low slung jean covered powerful legs. The man was shirtless, showing off the sluicing corded muscles of his abs and the sharp lines of his defined hipbones, having leaned his back against the headboard of his large California King sized bed as I watched the way his hard torso contracted against the smooth of his bronze skin, biceps and triceps relaxing and tensing with each inhale Harry took from the black charcoal etched cigar perched between the long strong lines of his middle and index finger.
Harry released my left asscheek to slap his free hand once again across my bum, palm colliding with my cheeks so viciously that it made my hips sway and jerk while my mouth dropped open to emit a breathy whimper. I felt the muscles in my thighs quiver from the strain of using them to attempt to hold myself up as Harry assaulted my asshole with his tongue in continuous strokes, his lips forming around the rim of it in a wet hot caress as he gave it a dirty kiss and a wet suck that almost had my eyes rolling to the back of my head.
The assassin’s clothes were ripped at the seams, showing patches of the scarred flesh he gained that day or so at the torn material of his dirt stained blue jeans and dark green, ratted T-Shirt.
Granger and Weasley, who were closest to Harry, seemed to have dropped to the floor in awash of others blood and in their own sacks of human passed out flesh. During the time I focused on Harry, it seemed like right when he released the sinister of that black substance from his body, his friends couldn’t handle its potent energy and collapsed.
happens, I want you to apparate inside the building and call out for me. I’ll find you immediately. And maybe I can have you drain someone of their dark magic to appease your own if anything were to go wrong for us to use that to our advantage. But we need to focus on getting the mission done. Do you understand me?” Harry’s words came out in a dark murmur, too quiet to be heard from Hezian’s position but enough for me to pick up with how close we were to each other.
The Gryffindor let out a hum, contemplative and rumbling like the crashing of rolling waves against the most Onyx of rocks. The hand curved around my bare arse pulled me up the wall with effortless ease, dragging me up the length of the flat surface even more so than I already had been to cause my feet to dangle below me, my broken cry of surprise and azure flecked fire gathering in my groin.
Of course Harry wouldn’t leave his mansion unlocked. The bastard is paranoid about everything and because he’s an assassin, he probably put up one of the most intensely intricately designed protection spells around his home so no one would be able to get in.
I was forced to look at the way the demon’s jaw unhinged to accommodate for a bigger meal, the sound of it's jaw cracking as it significantly stretched it's maw like a damn snake had a broken keen escaping my mouth at the same time Zereth released a heavy breath across my face that made me want to throw up.
Go on and read to thy heart's content, lovelies! Remember to check out my tumblr: reimcai for special updates and sneak peeks as well as a look into how I envision my work.
I looked up wearily over to the table next to us, taking notice that it was the one that had my knock-out potion. My poor wand was discarded a good few feet away from Harry and I on the floor in the ruckus of our movements, having moved from the table I was working on and onto the ground without my noticing.
“Tell me you like me again.” Harry’s demand was laced in a threatening order, the tone a no-arguments-allowed that rendered me clawing the blood stained tint of my fingers into the floor as if they were the flesh of Harry’s back that I imagined digging my frenzied nails into the way I wanted at the moment but with his cock in my arse all the while.
I let out a tiny keen as I breathed out a wet gasp when the tip of my tongue slipped back out of my agape mouth and circled around the top of Harry’s finger, the smell of cigar smoke and warmed honey intoxicating my senses. The lashes of my eyes pressed softly across the tips of my cheekbones, a sort of serene bliss covering the whole of my frame as I tasted the stygian musk of Harry’s finger, an embarrassing whimper leaving my mouth in a garbled whine when the assassin abruptly snapped his hips forward and pressed his lower half against my own at the same time my tongue went down to flick across the heated skin of Harry’s ring finger.
I felt the pale of my cheeks start to fill with a rush of shamed warmth, mortified at the thoughts that bombarded my mind at the mere idea of Harry getting visibly angry and losing his eerily calm and tethered demeanor by my disobedience. The simple notion that I could be the person to make the Golden Boy, who never seemed to lose his cool composure, get angry and show some sort of emotion other than a void, made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end and my flesh break out in heated goosebumps.
That’s when my heart decided to slam itself against the the inner walls of my ribcage and cause my breath to stutter in my lungs.
There was no sort of expression shown across the chiseled and defined set of Harry’s features as he stared at me with his head tilted towards my direction and his lips hovering over Kikue’s pale throat.
My want is not an aspect that my hands can brush effortlessly away in an attempt to shoulder it past my cavity.
Draco must’ve gained the upper hand once he had sat atop of the demon if he were fighting it before I arrived. Assuming how powerful the Slytherin had gotten, the moment the pretty blonde got a good handle of his magic and newly found powers along with that sharp witted brain of his to help bring about the odds on his sides, he had gotten the demon to be in a vulnerable spot fast enough to deal a great amount of injuries to them to render it immobile.
The Gryffindor looked out towards the cave, expression blank as he replied in a quiet rumble of his smooth voice. “I’ve constantly been hounded by people since I was young. I like my solitude and the quiet, something that I didn’t get much when I came to Hogwarts and dealt with being the ‘Chosen One’ and all. When I was a child, my aunt and uncle, the abusive bastards they were, kept me in a small room beneath the stairs and it was quiet with no people around in there. I guess you could say I grew up used to it and liking it. It’s a comfort for me. And I don’t want anyone in the Wizarding World bothering me like they always do whenever I’m out and about. So I figured the place where I stay should give me a peace of mind. No one knows where I live, except, well, you now.”
And the two people were staring at me with cautious glares that made me want to snap at them for their rudeness.
Bidding the redhead goodnight along with Ron who came into the living room briefly to say goodnight as well, I didn’t remember much after my head hit the pillows and I fell into a deep sleep.
My vision was clouded with an array of purple and red, the colors playing hauntingly in the back of my skull and popping in combustion in front of my eyes that strayed upon the way Kikue kept lifting his leg up like a two time hooker and grounded his pelvis up against Harry’s, his lids closed in utter pleasure at the feel of the assassin’s hard body pressed along his front.
The pleasure kept climbing higher in my spine and spreading out like wildfire over my groin from the rocking motions of Harry’s cock tauntingly brushing against my quaking hole, the heavy punishing slaps from his other hands on my thighs, and the sheer press of his body and breaths pushing against my flesh.
But before my fist could slam into Potter, his fingers had blearily snapped up during my movement and I was stopped from Potter’s grip around the small of my wrists, his long fingers digging into the delicate bones and his hardened grasp causing them to rub against one another, halting my actions.
I would be sitting in front of Harry, where my bum would be pressed up snugly against the assassin's groin where he would have his legs settled on each side of my parted thighs.
“You made the potion in the span of a day basically. Now that’s damn well impressive, Mr. Malfoy,” Hezian voiced with a tone of fascination, leaning forward in his seat and looking more alive and less agitated than he had a few seconds ago.
“Learn to have this switchblade on you at all times.” Potter suddenly stepped back, making me jump when I felt my knife being dropped into the space between my spread legs.
.” The Gryffindor’s voice shook then, with a powerful cadence that held more than one note of a voice, a series of disembodied, shadowed pitches all coming together at once and filtering throughout the whole of the room that made me scream out in confused fear and arousal, my widened eyes blinking up at the sight of Harry’s lids lowering and his mouth curling up into a vicious drawl of exaltation and brutality.
I tried to snap my head from side to side in an attempt to force the demon’s lips off of mine, but the damn creature was intent and determined to keep kissing me.
“If you don’t want to get raped by me, then you should kill the man and take his energy like I said,” the demon taunted, voice rasping mockingly out of it's mouth as I struggled beneath it's weight with my eyes watered in shame and dread.
Harry gave an exaggerated sigh, letting the fingers of his hand over the couch flick heedlessly for a quick beat of a moment, the assassin’s face turning into that same look of utter cold indifference that made me want to either climb him like a tree or hide in the nearest hole away from him.
With the charcoal blade of the knife gleaming beneath the fluorescent light bulb swinging to and fro above my head in the pitch black silent room, I brought my arm down, bending the elbow as I gave the seizing man a once over with my eyes, finding my lips turning up into a nasty snarl as a rumble of a growl emitted from my throat in an almost resonating maliciously delighted sound.
Harry rose a brow up at me then, the enticing shape of his lips twitching in thought as gave me a look of open curiosity while he let his hand splay out over the entire meat of my right thigh to grasp it in the large shape of his palm as he easily lifted me up while he practically pulled me fully into his lap now.
“I’m sorry I knocked you out, but like … the potion worked!” I smiled down at Harry in my state of glee, having chosen to stand up with the energy suddenly buzzing inside of my skin despite my limbs screaming out at me to bloody well
My friends gave me their accent and I was off, slipping my way through the crowds as I walked to the opposite side of the room, down the long third hallway with doors lining the walls on either side of my body, some left open a tad bit while others were completely shut.
Without further delay, I knelt down to shove all the papers that fell out of the envelope when I had dropped it on the floor back into its folds, my hands visibly shaking from the heat I felt coating my cheeks and inside of my gut, unnerved and hot all over.
But whenever I’d look over at Harry in the large room now out of pure curiosity in seeing what the assassin was up to, I’d get distracted by the sheer presence and appearance of the man himself.
Harry leaned back against the kitchen sink, mimicking the tilt of my head in a mocking manner as he stared back at me with the harsh lines of his face catered into a neutral countenance. “Why so curious? Did you miss me that much?” Harry’s voice turned into a deeper cadence, taunting and burning through my flesh.
If Krum was here, I would actually give him a small praise for the set of moral codes he created in his club.
I grappled at the Gryffindor’s knee some more to keep myself grounded, not wanting to wander off into the jumbling mess of my mind.
“Granger should be here any minute-” Weasley’s words were cut off when the sound of Granger popping in through apparition magic echoed in the vicinity of the large area. A few bags at her feet.
Harry scoffed as he exited the room. “I’d like to see you try.” His voice came out low and taunting, tone settling deep into my bones and nestling there with a heavy focus.
What the hell did I do to Draco to make him feel disconcerted?! Sure, I abruptly left him with Hezian and Cho but I trust them to not lay a single hand on what's mine, and they know not to.
Twisting my body to the side, I gazed back at myself through the floor to ceiling mirror propped up against the wall of Pansy’s dorm room, pressing my lips together as I let my pale gaze sluice down the length of my frame.
“Well, I’ll be damned. I like how the sweater looks big and fluffy on you, it accentuates how small of a dainty person you are. And those jeans do good with it.” Pansy cheered me on as she clapped moronically in front of me, her gaze lifting up off of my outfit to flash me a genuine smile, a white row of shiny teeth that complimented well with the lovely crinkles at the corners of her dark eyes that gleamed with appreciating mirth.
The doubt grew more inside of my chest, chaotic and confused, as I sharpened my focus like a fine knife, turning it into the tipping point of a needle as I told my magic to
That was Zereth's own stupidity for not thinking much about the possibility of a wizard killing it after they were feeding them more magic to gain more power off of.
And I shouldn’t be so entranced with the fact that Potter was taking down a creature without even lifting a finger.
I stabbed my fork into my sausage, standing up and watching Harry from beneath my lashes as I pressed the tip of the meat against the flat of my tongue, my eyes fluttering shut at the taste of the spicy food exploding over the open of my mouth before letting my teeth clamp down over the meat to tug a piece off, chewing and savoring the flavor.
, Princess. What I want you to do is breathe and let me cuddle you,” Harry intoned lowly, the underlying threat rumbling deep in his chest as his voice dropped so viciously that it made my body grow lax all of the sudden in the face of my hysteric emotions, taking his subtle command to calm down into my body almost immediately.
My mouth was a stream of quick words that I couldn’t quite hear through the white noise bursting forth in my ear drums as my prick started to, shockingly, fill up with my pulsating blood and harden once more, prickling with pain in having another round of arousal fill it once more while Harry plundered into me with such great force that I had to snap my hands up and lay the palm of my sweat slick hands against the ledge of the stair above me to keep from knocking myself out with how my head was practically banging itself against the ledge from Harry fucking into my body.
The two didn’t see my magic coming since I was the only one that could visibly see my magic do its work, it was translucent, almost like glass to anothers eye, so it did well to keep itself hidden when I really wanted it to.
My hole fluttered around Harry’s appendage, his dick settling deep into my gut before he slowly dragged it out of my arse, making me writhe over the table in a frenzy at the feeling of my walls clenching around the Gryffindor's cock, the impression of his prick burning and filling me up wonderfully.
Harry made a minute shift, my thighs having spread out on each side of Harry’s waist and brushing up over his clothed torso. The warm sensation made my back arch up into the Gryffindor unintentionally as the infuriating man went to bounce me up and down once more over his arm, a quick intake of air loud between the two of us as it escaped my mouth.
“Y-yes?” I managed to breathe out, watching as Harry became abnormally still, a dark enitity before me as he let the glowing embers of the red of his eyes pin me to the spot with cruelty forcing itself down onto me enough to let me shrink back from the demand oozing out of the man before me, cock twitching excitedly at the look.
“You were taking too long.” The hot brush of Harry’s breath playing over the cool skin of my neck right below my left ear had made me give a spasm of shock and brutal titillation, my breathing picking up its pace as the pulse in my cock ticked in time with the quick tandem beat of my heart.
When Harry nodded in assent towards Krum, the Bulgarian’s brown gaze shifted away from the assassin to watch me in the low lighting of the hallway, eyebrows lifting in an arrogant fixture and lips pulling back to show me his pearly white teeth. “You’ve grown up to be such a sweet, cute little tart. I mean, you’ve always been one but your arse has gotten even more plump and those lips are a fucking sin. I bet you’d look
I don’t care how clean the floor looks, it’s still a ground that people walk on and leaves traces of filth the human eye can’t see. I could be sitting on germs right now.
Kingsley glared down at me, taking a step forward as I took one step back to keep space between us, his closeness making my skin erupt in unwanted goosebumps. “Trisko was found with his neck sliced open, naked on a bed. And Jazine was found lying on the floor behind the counter with a hole in her chest and her heart missing. I find it odd that the people you conversed with are the ones that were murdered. No one else was with them that night.”
With a heaving breath, I whipped my gaze away from the Gryffindor, swinging my right leg over the side of the bike to hop on off of it and onto the ground with obnoxiously weakened limbs, my knees knocking together in a quick succession from the sudden energy drained away from my legs.
Harry knelt his head down more to let the warmth of his breath tingle the part of my mouth, that melting crimson jaded gaze of his travelling down my face to watch the trickle of my saliva trail out of my mouth and down my neck in a sloppy, curving, wet manner.
To my left, I could make out the bartender’s black station table, made up of granite and stretching for a good ten feet length across the dance floor and barricading itself against the left wall. People weren’t sitting at the bar, all out on the dance floor as they swayed, rocked and breathed along with the heated music.
My chest shuddered at the sluicing throb spreading out beneath it, my heart thundering achingly against my rib cage as I took in Potter’s words with a stabbing hurt that I couldn’t help but feel.
Peeking out to the side of my pillow, I caught sight of my alarm clock displaying red numbers in the dawning darkness of my room.
But I was wary of my control over the power I gained and cultivated. Of how it would end the life of the one person I was so infatuated with because my own damn magic wanted to see me suffer and feed off of it if it was to destroy the person I felt most attached to and cared for.
I opened my mouth to retort but Sirius spoke again before I could make a sound. “Ah, you even blush like a whore. No wonder Harry-”
The lid had eased itself forward into the ceiling, unhooking itself from its wall and croaking open to reveal a sliver of pale moonlight that sunk its way through the small cracks of the entrance, a ray of light flooding through the dark fluorescent glow of the tunnel.
It was then that I felt like if I stepped down the stairs and followed Harry, something would be taken from me, forcefully and without any warning, encroaching quickly and inevitably consuming and the air around me.
I let out a whine, high and breathy, out of my mouth when the scent of Potter’s body blanketed me while the warmth of his bare fingers skimmed over the curve of my waist, skating in between the hem of my jeans and top as the blistering heat that Potter’s frame eluded blazed against my bowed back.
“Why do you call your Gryffindork friend by their surnames? You used to call them by Ron and Hermione …” I was always confused as to why Harry would call his best friends by their last names rather than their first like he used to. It felt off and detached on Harry’s end. And neither Granger or Weasley seemed to mind either.
the giddy grin in Blaise’s voice as he chirped happily from beside me, the corners of my eyes catching the damn guy bouncing up and down on his seat in barely contained excitement at my conceding declaration. “Yay! We’re going to have some fun tonight.”
My father and mother left a tremendous amount of money when they both died and I haven’t went anywhere near their different accounts considering that I didn’t want anything to do with them, even after death. I had this notion that if I were to use the money my parents left behind, then I would be in debt to those two despite their lives having been long done for. And it made me feel like I was just another one of those rich spoiled brats that wanted their dead parents money when in reality, I had to do chores and behave just as much as any other child that wanted an allowance from their parents when they were alive. I also wanted to earn my money, not be given it.
My chest shook as I tried to even my breathing out, letting my heart slow in it’s hysteric pace while I did my best to keep from letting my magic get out of control with my raging need to kill the motherfucker behind me in an instant.
My brain couldn’t quite catch up to my body’s response to the burst of pain and burning rage that festered in a dizzying rush throughout my frame. In a jolting movement of my limbs, I drew myself down the length the man’s thigh that slipped its way between my legs to shove the apex of my right knee straight into the stupid guy’s groin, my action swift and tethered in its weighted push.
The Gryffindor’s tone was sluiced with indifference, toneless and cold. It made a shudder race down my spine from his daunting voice.
“I’m your boss Harry, and if I want Draco to do something else in exchange for his safety with my protection, then I have every right to do so.” Hezian’s voice pitched low as he looked towards Erus’ way, his jaw ticking as the muscles there tensed, his eyes shifting into a look of stern fortitude to cover up the fine tremor in the length of his arms in the face of Harry Potter’s unnerving red green stare.
I nodded, pressing my lips together after having another piece of waffle as I rasped out my words quietly. “They have to. They’ve known you since you were little. Grew up with you. I can tell that they love you, even if you aren’t with them as much as you were before. Don’t be too harsh on yourself, Harry.”
Kevera clicked his tongue up at both Harry and I as he dangled the keys in his hand with a shake, voice bored in the sudden business like attitude he now attended to. “Follow me then, Mr. Malfoy and Malfoy’s boyfriend.”
I was already treated like nothing by my parents and hated by a good amount of people from the wizarding world. I didn’t need to be treated as such in the bedroom and in a relationship. Sure my parents gave me what I needed when I asked for it, but they didn’t treat me with any sort of love a child should have and they pretended I didn’t even exist when Voldemort was alive.
Here is the new chapter! Read on. And I promise, there will be more. The updates will be sporadic, but there is still going to be new chapters haha, so stick with me here. Thank you!
It felt like they both now wanted me to get into some trouble, but not to the point where I’d end up being left in a ditch somewhere.
Just as I was about to bring my legs up into a quicker rhythm to break out into a sprint, I felt a hot hand grip my hips in a biting clutch that seemed to embed themselves into my hip bones as I was roughly spun around with my breath wheezing past the riotous pump of my lungs.
Everything that just happened was starting to fill my brain with dread, confusion, anger and inevitable warmth that sprawled over my groin mockingly.
?” Harry’s voice was rough, the low timbre rumbling throughout the space we shared in a deep tundra, soothing and intimidating as if he too, had just woken up.
But since I had been announced as having been a death eater and was involved with Voldemort and the cause of Dumbledors passing, no one wanted my help in potion producing ever since.
They were using their magic combined with their weapons and physical attacks to make the impacts harder and more lethal as well as their quickness in movements.
No one cared what I did, most sneering at me behind my back when they thought I wasn’t aware of their presence with malice and chattering lightly about how I should have been sent to Azkaban with my Father or killed on the spot.
“Harry! Put me the hell down! I-I can walk by myself.” My voice was high and shrill in my panicked mortification, my shoulder pressing into the hard line of Harry’s abs and strong chest beneath the onslaught of his shirt, the already slow beating of my heart quickening again from the press of Harry’s body against my own.
Despite the shite that I’ve done in my past, I didn’t like having to do the things I had to. I was only trying to help my parents in anyway I can and I was a stupid teenager that did eveything in their power to protect said parents from dying at the hands of the Dark Lord.
Neville gave a chastising low sound out of the corner of his sinful grin, amber eyes glinting harshly as he picked up the bag of edibles meant for my person with a swipe of his hand off of the table only to bounce the bag indifferently in his palm up and down while peering down at me. “You still didn’t get it, Draco.” Neville intoned in a low mumble.
When the security guard goblins were done assessing Harry for any potential dangers, they were left with nothing but happy smiles in result of “Devin” being a none threat to the bank, ans since there wands took out Harry's new identity's magical signature to get information, fake ones, on his background, it seemed they were content with what they seen and thought "Devin" was a none threat.
I barely heard the static sound of clapping and wolf whistles crescendo and descend in various resonations throughout the entirety of the room.
As Harry nipped at my bare shoulder, teeth pin pricking there as he bit me harshly enough to make me whimper in pain and heat, I released a breathless moan.
When the magic started to heat up like risings flames sparking in the midst of a quiet forest, it felt as if invisible probing fingers skimmed past the low hitch of my jeans, making my skin quake and my chest constrict with the halting oxygen in my brain and lungs from the the sinful touch.
I cried out some more, knowing that I had created a monster of myself and didn’t mind as much as I knew I should have.
Harry lifted up and off of me, only to reappear right in front of me as he crouched down at his knees and put his elbows over his muscled thighs, relaxed power latent and brewing in his stance as the Gryffindor’s handsome features shifted into a look of stygian devilish intent, mouth turning up into a lazy grin.
And hell, Sirius was dead as far as I knew and now that he wasn’t, the man deserved to be called by his first name, to be recognized as his own person again.
I felt like the weakened prey that I was with Harry holding me still with his mere, ominous presence and threatening, heated possessive touch.
Sirius, who had been standing beside Caetia silently for a good five minutes, finally spoke up, his words low and somewhat thunderous as those black eyes of his trailed down the slope of my figure, lips pulling up into a snarl that caught me off guard. “If anyone so much as touches you without your permission, you come straight back to this room and tell me who it was. I will not have my cousin molested and Harry will be able to tell if anyone touched you so be extra fucking careful or else you and I will both be killed by the hands of the Chosen One.”
The vampire stumbled from the harsh push and went to touch the black trail of his blood that seeped from the splitting of his flesh on the side of his face where he was grabbed at moments ago, groaning out in pain.
Nearing the first set of large space the stairs catered to, I whipped my head around, my wand gripped tight in my hand, to see Harry’s frame shrouded in darkness at the bottom of the staircase, my body jolting on the spot as my mouth popped open to release a strained, pathetic squeak out of my lips when a strike of lighting and the grumbling of thunder suddenly burst forth and echoed throughout the entirety of the mansion.
I shook from where I was pressed up against the wall, teeth grinding together now as I tried to gather up enough courage to voice my wrong doings. I knew I wasn’t a saint, I’ve killed many people before for the sole purpose of trying to get my parents to love me. I’m not a good person and I was hypocritical for calling out how Harry wasn’t a good person either.
Whipping my hand up as Harry finally closed in on my personal space like an all consuming Stygian prominence, I spread the width of my fingers out and snapped the skin of my palm across the assassin’s face, the slap a profound crack against the flesh of my hand and Harry’s right cheek, the force of it harsh and stinging my palm but doing nothing to make the Gryffindor’s head twist the other way.
The Assasin had his moment of being dumb like I had. He should have looked at the tube and it’s label before inhaling any sort of potion given to him. He probably trusted me enough to not make a mistake.
Krum let out a sigh, acting nonchalant, although I could see the tremor in the man’s arms that were crossed over his wide chest, clearly revealing the nerves he produced with the way Harry spoke and the intimidating presence of the Chosen One. “Of course Harry. Draco and you can stay in the guest rooms at the back. The people who come and go here won’t bring you trouble, of course they’d try to talk to you because they’ll be star struck, but they have nothing to gain with trying to pick a fight with the most powerful wizard.” Krum’s response shook in his tones, just barely.
Harry had kept picking at the worst of my nerves and insecurities, calling me out on my lack of mental strength whenever he could and even though I liked the humiliation the assassin made me feel like the freakish, kinky twat that I am, I couldn’t let him touch me anymore than he already has because that would only give me false hope that I couldn’t bear to have when I know the outcome would be horrible.
I lifted up my own hips from the wall in an attempt to grind my pelvis against Harry’s, but the man let out a chuckle, sweltering and volatile, as he snapped his lower half forward to jam me tight against the wall and keep me still with the heavy pressure of his frame crowding into my own.
Then Potter dropped his leg out from between my legs, only to thrust it back up and cause my arse and cock to bounce up and down off of his thigh, the pressure on my cock turning into bursting proportions as the push against the bottom of my genital and arse produced my back to curve forward and into the wall, my head falling back from the rush of pleasure playing over and inside of my skin.
I sucked in air through my mouth as I felt the material of my shorts rise up the tops of my thighs at Harry’s tug on my body, the curves of my bum pressing against Harry’s right thigh, heat boiling in the pit of my gut as I took in what Harry had said with an elated heart.
Here's another new chapter for ya'll. This one is going into a more darkened path and I love the build up of the story and it's descend into madness (just a bit). Draco is going to go through some things in the next chapter and Harry is going to be furious. But we'll see how things turn out aha.
My breaths were coming up faster from beneath the awning of my chest, heaving with oxygen that I inhaled with a quick draw of the purse of my lips, eyes drawn to the vehicle tilted sideways the slightest bit from the kickstand it rested upon, the asphalt of the road old and worn out with its fading markings.
My breath whooshed out my mouth when Potter lifted one foot and stepped over Kingsley’s body to crowd in on me, my body jerking back in surprise as I fell back on my arse with a harsh impact and hissed out at the pain sluicing up my tailbone from the sudden fall. My back jarred against the side of my bed, spine colliding with the plush of my mattress as my body was forced back from Potter’s trek towards me, his jean covered cock right at the part of my lips from the way I had to tilt my head back until the back of my skull touched the bed and prevented me from escaping Potter’s sudden invasion on my space.
The entitled stuck up redhead surprisingly loved to party and with her magical skills, she had created a room without any of the professors or headmasters having a clue about it. I knew this for the sole purpose of hearing Pansy talk about the get togethers Granger threw throughout the year. And as expected, the spring break celebration was going to be held in that Gryffindor’s self created room.
Thank you for everything. Please feel free to leave a comment. And remember that I'll be working on other stories as well so look forward to those!
inside of him, puncturing my way over his prostate as he shook like a fawn on his upraised weakened knees and curled toes.
There was a picture of Harry, when he was young, all calm and collected but with the tiniest of a smile as he stood in front of a glass case that shown an array of motorcycles behind it, the machines out on display with at least a twelve year old Harry all beaten, battered and bruised at the flesh with his face swollen and caked in flecks of dried blood in front of them.
Harry, who was to the left of Neville, watched me with that unnerving gaze of his, the emerald dewy green shade of his eyes similar to that of a pine and seafoam green mingling together to create a naturalistic and enticing pierce of a scheme, blinding in the eerie illuminate shade of his jaded, observant gaze. The gleam of his stare was a contrast to the bronze color of his flesh, smooth and unblemished with the softest olive tone, making him look almost like a god of war. His body damn well sure suited the title of a “god” with the lean and perfectly toned muscles of his frame, tall and foreboding in the intimidation that he emitted from the sinews of his hard body. His shoulders were wide with long strong legs and thighs, the angular cuts of his jaw and cheekbones something I could hurt myself on with how defined they were. The curves of his mouth the definition of sin.
My retreating steps were prevented when the assassin spoke up then. “Are you done throwing your tantrum?” His voice was laced with a bored drawl that made me want to run to the nearest hiding space or snap at him to get some sort of reaction out of such an emotionless man before me.
“Stop moving.” Harry spoke with an undertone of a demand, clear and evident in the low cadence of his voice, salacious and reminding me of hot milk and melted chocolate, dark and tempting and rough.
I took another bite out of my sausage, prickling the end of my fork continuously against the edge of my plate as I nodded at Harry’s explanation. I could get where Harry was coming from, with the impending worry about what the wizard world would think if someone they looked up to or put in high regards didn’t get what they wanted from them. Harry being with Ginny was a big deal, and I guess Harry didn’t want to disappoint those who wanted the two together. That was similar to how I tried to do as my father told me to so I wouldn’t disappoint him since Lucius thought of me as someone who was far above others.
Caetia turned a profuse red at my words as he gave me a stuttered response, Sirius smirking like a Cheshire cat now. “Ah y-yes. And also, I work here … as a stripper for the third level of the club, the Dancing Hall, so to say.”
The man that had grabbed me earlier, stood stalk still as I struggled about in Harry’s grip, but he wasn’t looking towards me, no, the dark hue of his brown eyes were trained on a spot above my shoulders, behind me.
I let out a huff of air, the sound interrupting my train of thought. I felt my chest tighten at the mere memory of having to go through the same horrid event for four hours straight until Snape came bursting through the bathroom and broke my mind out of the spell.
“It seems to me that you don’t know how to even use them given how easily I caught you when you were practically running away.” Harry responded with a low, bored drawl, husked and without any emotion as he looked straight ahead, green red eyes focused forward and hard at the edges.
“I l-l-like you, Harry.” I spoke through the heavy, shuddered breaths of my throat that was being held captive by Harry’s hot, branding hand. Gathering up the nerve to peer up at this domineering man from beneath the tear stained wet of my eyelashes, a pink tinge caressed my neck and cheeks as the large of my opal gaze timidly met Harry’s.
With the way Harry’s body shuddered brutally with the cruel rise of his chest as he sucked in air through his teeth hard enough to fornicate a vehement hiss out of his mouth, I
Harry simply turned his head towards the now broken small lantern and stared at it for a few seconds, only to tilt his head my way once again, agonizingly slow and covetous like in its disturbingly observant manner as the assassin raised a dark brow up at me and the shape of his mouth curled more into a carnal smirk.
And so, both my mother and I were left alone since one of the people from the Golden Trio had spoken up on my behalf and Narcissa’s.
I hope you all have enjoyed Tenebrous as much as I enjoyed writing it! I'll be updating another chapter soon.
Before Harry could speak again, I spoke up, my voice neutral although I felt the exact opposite way as my heart pounded furiously against my chest and the apprehension in my body festered within as I looked over Hezian’s way again. “I’ll be okay. As long as Harry goes wherever I go, then I’m sure I can do whatever it is you want me to.”
I turned my body to face Zereth, looking up at the demon from beneath my pale lashes as I stood my ground, breaths calm and collected as Zereth’s massive body closed in on me.
I didn’t care that I sounded like a child that had been given Christmas to every day as a gift. I was
Confidence brewed up inside of me when I saw Harry’s gaze grow almost pitch black while his mouth parted the slightest to release a warmed breath over my smiling lips in a soft shudder of a grunt.
The pretty boy was still unconscious and breathing, stuttering in his gasps of air, as he lied across the stone floor, blacked out and oozing out my cum that spewed out around my cock and his hole.
My skin buzzed with energized longing, my bare arse sticking out as Harry pressed me further into the table by lifting me up while pulling at my arm behind my back. The action caused me to cry out at the slight prickling pain in arm’s tendons from Harry’s tug before I was pushed onto the table again at the same time the Assassin snapped his lower half forward to cause my feet to skitter across the floor and make me rise up on the tips of my toes only for them to be left dangling a breadth off of the ground now by his motions.
Harry many times. Well, even three months ago he had that delicious cock of his shoved deep in my pussy-”
Harry’s fingers were still pressed into the slit of my ripped pants, his hand gripping the whole of my right arse cheek from beneath the material, skin on skin, as the man shoved his way into my space, fast and rough.
exposed figure, I resisted trying to huddle in closer to Harry's warmth to prevent myself as being seen as even more of a damsel in distress than I already was. And I was going to get nowhere near the man with these damn clothes!
I was vulnerable, with only a towel to cover up the burning wet of my body, and the fact that Potter saw me naked a few seconds ago making me want to crawl out of my own skin in mortification and nerves, an anxious tremor producing in my jello limbs. My feet slipped across the polished floor, mouth popping open to release a shuddering gasp as I practically scrambled away from Potter’s encroaching figure, dark and harsh.
The shirt covered up my mark so I didn't have to worry about anyone catching sight of the emblem etched into my flesh.
It carried an animalistic tremor in its sound, emitting a frequency that quaked in a screeching pitch of hungered delirious
“How am I supposed to test if my potion works?” I spoke out loud for the first time since we had gotten here, my brain having been stuck in my tasks enough to forget to talk.
The Assassin’s gleaming red green eyes demanded me to start moving now with the way his gaze burned me at the same time he raised his dark brow up at me to gesture his command for my dancing to start.
The boy has exposing clothes that I do not have enough confidence to wear. My mother ingrained it into my head that people who wore clothes that shown too much skin were just a bunch of sluts and of course I don’t think that about people who do go around wearing those kinds of fabrics but there was this unusual fear of going against my mother’s words and becoming a horrible, despicable person for it.
Perhaps I could go out for a little walk and get some fresh air? Potter told me to forget about everything, and thinking this much for the past day was making my head throb, an insufficient buzzing headache settling at my temples.
I watched with widened eyes and burning cheeks as Harry reached up again to snatch the container of coffee cream above my head, his bottom half rocking slightly into my arse and making my hands snap down to grab ahold of the edges of the counter, meek whimper escaping from my open mouth. “
“Run along now.” Neville spoke up, his tone harsh and without emotion as I looked back at him from beneath the disarray of my pale hair and wet lashes, Neville’s gaze giving nothing away in the amber flecks while he stared down at me.
I leaned back a little to distance myself from the man’s figure, my mouth forming into a line of perpetual indifference as I kept my tone monotonous without any hint of an expression crossing my unflinching features. My pulse was set into a fast rhythm from having to be so anxious at the situation I found myself in.
I would enjoy it because my magic was going crazy with the thought of drinking in this man’s dark magic and the fact that the wizard had killed his family only made my moral ground shaky with the notion that I’d be killing someone who deserved it.
So I lived by myself, tried making money through one job after the next after graduating from Hogwarts with a letter of congratulations from the new Headmaster, my potions teacher, Severus Snape.
All these people were going to see Draco’s arse moving about in synchronization with the sultry music heavily pounding against his pale skin. People were going to ogle at the way Draco’s long legs would be skimmed with a wet sheen while that shoulder length, soft white hair of his got more mussed from moving around too much.
It wore nothing else, their large bare feet planted flat across the cemented floor as they loomed dangerously near my suspended body.
A tiny moan, moist and keening from the quivering of my mouth and the rattling cage of my chest through the working tandems of my overwhelmed throat, spilled out, high and rapturing in an ashamed arousal from hearing such a dirty thing come from Harry Potter’s mouth.
And now, as I feel the energy of my magic coalesces around me in electrifying sparks, there is that same doubt nestling in the pit of my gut of what I knew was to come about my actions.
The Assassin had given me dark blue tight yet comfortable jeans to wear and paired it off with a flimsy white short sleeve top, the clothing light and airy enough to move around in and not get in the way of my work. My simple black converse shoes squeaked softly whenever I walked over the pristine linoleum floor, the sound irritating to my ears but something I could handle nonetheless.
Harry had visibly gotten off of the drawer he had sat upon, resting his own two feet onto the ground before rushing to me in at least four long strides as the furrow in his brow showed the open concern he had for me. The bare muscles of his chest and arms rippled with every step he took my way, my heart thudding so loudly in my ears that it felt as if drums pounded within my head as my boyfriend neared his bed where I sat impatiently for him.
The Gryffindor, too out of it to even notice what was happening, easily inhaled the potion’s smoke through his nose, the disturbingly lifeless dulled colors in his dazed eyes staring at me with confusion and weariness right before he fell forward with his eyes shutting closed closely after, bringing me down with him as I gasped out in shock when I felt my back smack against the floor.
I squealed out loud, tipping over as I felt my body become weightless and snapped my arms and hands out to collide them over the flat, smooth granite of the stairs when I felt the whole of my front press roughly flushed against the large space of the step. I found my forearms  resting on the surface of the stairs my body sprawled out over as my fingers dug into the ledge of the next step, my hair going every which way in my field of vision as a hot and hard line of a tall body pressed tight against my back.
The distant sound of a buzz ricocheted off the inner walls of my skull, reverberating throughout the entire space of my mind, out of my ears, and around the solace of my head. The noise grew distinctly louder with each fast thud of my heartbeat pulsating with the thrumming of my blood in my veins.
of a chastising sound that made my skin tingle at every pore that my body carried as I yelped significantly high with my mouth popping open wide as the assassin suddenly shoved the whole length of his middle finger straight into my hole.
Hey guys! It's a me! So, this chapter is going to be a literal two part chapter. The first part is called "The Chase" but in Latin "The Fusce". I wanted to do this because I felt like this was the best way to go for this particular chapter. There's some smut in this one, but the second part of the chapter will be filled with just sex. I had to gear up for it because Harry has to live up to his sexual prowess in his own violent and filthy way and it will take at least two parts of this chapter to show how bad Harry is. And poor Draco, the Blonde is going to be crying and not walking by the end of this whole two part chapter.
And I shamefully let my body override any logical thought as I released a needy moan and wiggled my bum cheeks against Erus’ dick, the heaving of my chest rising and falling in time to the rapid beating of my heart as I trembled beneath the man above me.
That’s when I saw the shape of Harry’s pitch black wand in the right of his relaxed hand, the bottom stem of his ominous wand gangly and silky smooth to the touch and sight, catered between the lax of his long, dexterous strong fingers.
Not only because of Harry’s demand that I found myself walking towards the bike he sat on, but I also did what I was told for the mere fact that we were still both in danger from being so close to the club underground and how Animadverto and those Carbonou creatures could be coming after us any moment now.
Shaking off my impending thoughts, I raced on out of the door, knowing my time was running low or most likely
My stupid prick started rising up beneath Potter’s dark gaze and I wanted to smash a baseball bat into my skull from getting hot and bothered right now.
The Gryffindor probably knew I was getting aroused at his display of magic powers. And he knew I was only interested in him.
I needed Potter out of this bathroom before I tried to do anything stupid like beg the man to spank me just like he threatened to do with me or attempt to slap my palm across his gorgeous face. The next words I spoke were rushed and trembling with rage and arousal, voice begrudging and pitching in high and low octaves consistently. “Yes. I Understand. I’ll behave.”
“Moremoremoremore!” I was screaming around the pathetic mewl of my shattering gasps and weak voice, the burning in my hole decidedly ebbing away enough to let the brilliant, terrifying bliss overtake every logical thought in my brain and every nook and cranny in my body as my frame dragged up and down over the floor from the impact of Harry’s defined hips puncturing against my own with such a cruel slam that I was starting to hyperventilate in overbearing pleasure.
Kikue stared up at me with the wide of his eyes, his pupils dilating in a terror streaked countenance at the way I spoke so tonelessly and without care as I sneered down to him.
Glancing at the open entrance of my bathroom, my frown curled down further over the curve of my lips, hearing an echo of silence except for the rustle of the towel I pressed and swiped down the slick of my skin.
I was growing impatient though, sliding my frantic hands into the buttons of Harry’s long sleeve to haphazardly rip the fabric away from his torso, buttons flying and fabric tearing as my seeking hands slid over the contours and hardened flesh of the assassin’s abs with a slutty moan escaping my mouth and into Harry’s.
“Let me go. Fucking hell, Harry! Why did you go off and kill that vampire? There was no reason for such an act-” My straining voice was halted by Harry’s words.
Once when I was scrounging about for clothes in any store that would allow an ex death eater in, I came across the night club. It was a long stretch of a building, rectangular in its length and about four stories high. The building was made up of black marbled walls, a block of shimmering stone that drew in the sun’s essence and made itself glow from its shadowed position from other towering building in front of it.
And it was never satisfying when I fucked others. Sure, I came, but it wasn’t into a pretty little Kitten that I’ve imagined pushing my cock into various times throughout the last two years of Hogwarts up until now. I constantly imagined those that I’ve fucked as Draco.
The veins in Harry’s neck were prominent, the chords of his muscles tensing and relaxing as the sharp line of his jaw grew taut, a storm brewing in those irreverent eyes of his.
Giving a short abrupt nod towards Weasley and not even sparing him a single glance, I simply apparated to where I could
as the Slytherin girl’s arse cheeks spilled through the grappling fingers of her lover’s. Blaise had a look of pure bliss and content cross the handsome splay of his features, letting Pansy nuzzle her face into the crook of his neck as it looked, from my point of view, like he was carrying a child with the way Pansy’s legs hooked around his waist and her arms folded around the back of his neck.
“Poor thing.” That was the last phrase the weird guy said before he left me here, in the streets with a dumbfounded expression. There was no sound of the man’s disappearance, the whole of his body seeming to have vanished from my line of sight like he was popping in and out of existence, no noise following his departure as he vanished.
thing.” The boy’s dark eyes ran down my body and back up in a fast observation before continuing to speak again. “You must be another one of Harry’s friends, Draco right? I’m Kikue, Harry’s friend as well.”
“Potter. Stop, come on, just leave the guy alone.” All my anger dissipated with the knowledge that I could get someone killed any second now. My voice came out in a breathy whisper, a quivering hitch in my tone that shown the anxiety crowding within the tremulous hot and cold emotions in my body.
It wasn’t like I had to get up early anyway. I had no work because it was the weekend and I was trapped inside of this small studio for a good couple days before I was expected to show back up at my job.
Harry immediately situated himself into the open V of my thighs with his right, large one, making sure to keep his one finger pushing in and out of my hole with each collision of his appendage against my prostate constantly and giving no relent or break upon my quaking person.
Princess.” Harry grumbled his low words into my left ear as he took my earlobe with the clench of his teeth clamping over the sensitive flesh there and gave it a biting scrape as he sucked it into the slick warmth of his mouth, his sinful tongue teasing along the skin and making my lower half convulse on the spot from the light-headed heated sensation.
Potter was with Trisko. Was he dead? Kingsley didn’t say anything about Potter. Maybe Potter left the vicinity after having sex with Trisko before the murders happened. I highly doubt the Gryffindor was dead with the simple fact that Potter was powerful. His wandless magic that was shown last night displayed his strength.
I tipped my chin up, nose in the air as I urged myself to not look toward Harry, feeling him watch the both of us interact in his quiet, overwhelming observation. “Don’t give me any nicknames. Let’s just stay out each other’s way and we’ll get along
“H-Harry … what did you do j-just no-” My words were interrupted by the squeak leaving my lips when I felt the rush of warmed air closing in on me, Harry’s figure disappearing from my sight for a given second before reappearing, looming and consuming the space around my person with an inevitable proximity.
It seemed one of the students had been eavesdropping on mine and Pansy’s conversation because the girl to my right wearing only a bra and panties with a pearly white toothed smile flashed our way raised her red solo cup towards my person, giving me a cheeky grin. The crystal blue of her gaze shimmered with that hazy drunken film shadowing over her eyes, black hair mussed in their short strands while she husked towards me in a slur of words. “Weed is being provided in the second to last room on the right down the third hall across the room here! Have at it, Malfoy.”
I yelped when I heard the vampire yell out in a pig squealing pitch that had my knees shaking as I brought my large gaze back down onto the creature and watched in dawning dismay as the vampire’s clothes ripped at his torso to show the tearing of his gut, gushing out a string of intestines that had pushed at his skin like they were alive, wriggling about and puncturing through the flesh to rip away the man’s stomach in a squelching mutilation.
Caetia let out a light laugh from the part of his mouth, a tinkling bell like chime in his tone as the flesh on the corner of his eyes crinkled with a given lightness that made me furrow my brows down at him in annoyed fixation as my lips twitched with the urge to smile placating like.
Squeaking out soundlessly in giddiness, I pushed the rest of my body, feet first then head, into the open window and jumped rather noisily onto the sleek marbled, grey and obsidian flecked floor of the mansion, my wet figure slipping about as I fell to my shins with a harsh impact and a grimace in response to the abrupt but quick pain prickling the fall induced within my legs.
Potter wore a black military waistcoat vest, dark leather fitting to the lean and muscled frame of his tall body. The short sleeves displayed the shifting portions of his muscular arms, biceps flexing with each calming exhale he breathed out through his flaring nostrils as he brought the long of his arms back to tighten his fists beneath the creaking leather of his boxing, finger cut off gloves, and whip his hand forward to slam them into the crevices of the bag,  causing it to swing forwards and up, it’s chain link creaking and rattling from almost unhinging itself from it’s connection.
The Carbonou’s mouth was only a sliver of a breadth away from my upturned face, my gaze wide and frozen as I watched the creature open its mouth to reveal the sharp jut of its endless rows of razor edged teeth and release a rotted, heated breath across my forehead.
I was in a chaotic stream of emotion. One made up of anger, of relief, of worry, and the undeniable sensation of a wicked desire swirling dangerously low in my gut from what I came across once I finally tracked Draco’s barely visible energy with my own magic and found him hidden beneath the slums of London at last. Entrapped by a demon nonetheless.
“So your magic is all sorts of excited over my own magic and what I am. And having my thoughts grow darker over the past few years had slowly awakened my blood inheritance. That’s so … f-fucked up. Why didn’t my parents tell me?” I mumbled out my words, lips barely moving as I nibbled profusely on my bottom lip, eyes wandering every which way while my brain tried to work around the news that was invading my every thought process.
I snapped my eyes up to stare at where our hands were curled together over his heart, my breath leaving my lungs as my brain seemed to glitch for a good few minutes while my body grew warm and the flesh on both my neck and cheeks went incredibly hot.
“Right. Yes. I’ll be glad to come over now. Harry, shall we?” I hated how my tone came out into a shaking high pitch, blush spreading further over my face as I looked up at Weasley with a sheepish smile before looking over at Harry with a look of pure malice.
The pit of my gut felt queasy and my rage simmered heavy beneath my skin, waiting to come out and attack anyone who decided to be talkative to me today.
Huffing out in dismay, I found my fork hiding beneath the kitchen sink, causing me to sink low to my knees with a snicker of annoyance as I went to put my hands on the ground and bend to push my hand beneath the tiny slip between the floor and the sinks cabinets, attempting to grasp the fallen fork.
But I’m guessing since Harry knew I was going to be going into his mansion, he let the shields down for me.
The club was packed, bodies swaying from side to side to the soft hum of the music as members writhed against one another in a series of shortened, moist breathy moans or groans that seemed to filter throughout my bones in a rattling heat.
The heat and strength that I felt beneath my figure from the two men I laid across over had made warmth singe down into my prick like an incoming storm, my cheeks turning red as I spluttered and floundered my hands and legs about in my attempt to get off the two Gryffindors as fast as possible, my senses going on overload at the scents, heat and sensations of Harry and Neville around me.
Krum’s footsteps made light dust from the earthy floor mystify around each slow step he took towards Harry and I, dark hazel etched eyes sliding back and forth for my person to Harry’s and his handsome sharp features glinting off the lights floating above our heads. Krum looked the same, that cocksure smile branded on the tilt of his lips and body reminding me of a boxer’s build, stocky and a little short but still a couple inches taller than me. He packed more muscle though, the Bulgarian lad looking as if he was on steroids with the way his muscles bulged against his obscenely too tight shirt. The light mahogany strands of his tousled hair reached past his shoulders, making him look like a fucking cavemen in that nest of dark locks with his prominent gruff beard.
Harry pressed the flesh of his bottom lip on the skin below my ear, dragging it down as he let the row of his top teeth catch on my neck along the way and scraped them over my throat, the sharp jab causing my breath to stutter in my mouth and my head to fall back in shuddering delight.
I assume if Kikue knew my name from Harry telling him somehow before or after all that murderous mess that happened, the host would know Caetia and the others who were apparated here by Harry.
I said that out loud, bloody hell, I thought that I said such a thing in the safety of my own head, but it seems that my mouth had a mind of its own. It was a reflex. It was something that kept festering in the back of my mind that I’ve tried to cease into disappearance out of shame and wrong depravity.
People of all genders came at each other like trained fighters, jabbing against each other’s weak points as human bodies flung together with a series of pained gasps or huffs of straining breaths. The clashing of metal clanged around the surface of the area, my eyes tracking the varying shapes of sharp edged weapons being thrown across the room with steady glides in rather precise attempts to cut one another up.
Furrowing my brows, I looked back towards the cave, the heels of my shoes wobbling from their sinkage into the sand below me. “
That’s when an idea occurred to my mind, something arranged in petty vengeance and stupid vulnerability that had me doing what I was going to so I could show Harry that I wasn’t just another notch on his post if he so bloody well thought so and to think twice about leaving me without so much as a thought.
Scrambling up onto my feet, legs jello like, I placed the fork down on the counter and spoke up with a hysteria laced in my rushed words. “Guess I win the game! You didn’t answer my question. So, I’ll-uh … I’m gonna go watch some muggle TV. The Discovery Channel’s got great shots of animal habitats that I love, so yeah, I-I-I-”
Trying to steady my breaths and stop the quivers raking all over my terrified form, I heard the inevitable sound of footsteps, heavy and slow, getting louder by each passing minute as the footfalls came closer.
I didn’t think twice to lean my head down to kiss Harry’s gorgeous smile, my own cheeky grin softening into Harry’s lips that quickly formed to fit against my own, the heat of his breath whooshing into my lungs as I breathed him in shakily.
The man’s stricken gaze and sickeningly pale expression shown the terror his body was being held under from looking at the Gryffindor behind me. I assume he was watching the way the assassin’s eyes turned an illuminate crystalline emerald film and a disturbingly alluring red shade that caused initial frozen fear within the harsh tremors barricading the blonde man’s form.
I was pretty sure that the Gryffindor knew of this about me with how we had taken Potions Class together in our Eighth Year. I was always quiet and liked to be left alone when we were assigned to do anything with the physicality of potions.
I can see where Hezian’s characteristics  saw him fit to be a boss in an assassination establishment. The blonde man literally gave no room for arguments and gave sound words that was understandable, hard and collected.
“Want to feel what you’re little girl felt when you decided to rape her?” My voice didn’t sound like it belonged to me, the tone cruel and monotonous all the while a resonation of all the other dark magic I kept with my own echoed out of my mouth with it.
Sparks fired off of every nerve in my frame as I squirmed, liking the feeling of having Harry continuously slam me back onto the table with his sheer strength, my goal to purposely rile the man up enough to pound into me even
I jutted out my bottom lip in aggravated apprehension, my eyes narrowing up at him as I released my death grip on the bathroom sinks edge to wrap the towel around the whole of my shaking body and the swelling of my cock at the sight of Potter.
The woman flicked the mass of her beautiful hair behind her back and watched me beneath the perfect arch of her mascara dipped long eyelashes, critically eyeing me. The glare of her burnt orange tinged eyes elicited the need to cover myself up from the evident judgment she exuded towards my person. “I don’t think you’re pretty enough-”
Caetia let out an appreciative whistle, the sound high and loud within the confines of the area we stood in, causing my blush to deepen into dark blood red proportions. “Nice, your legs go on forever, it’s wonderful. You’d make a lot of bank if you became a stripper.” Caetia’s voice seemed to perk up in excitement at the words he just spoke out.
“O-Okay. I’ll kill him,” I whispered hoarsely, my sobs quiet as I quickly felt Zereth’s weight lift off of me at my given obedience.
Wrestling out of my clothes, I shoved on black pants that form fitted to every dip and curve of my waist and long legs, the fabric a comfortable fixture of thin leather that was easy to move around in. The boxers I wore underneath were a silken navy blue that felt more like boy short panties more than anything, but they were nice to the touch nonetheless so I kept them on.
you. I’ve liked you since the last two years of Hogwarts up until now and after. But I can’t … I can’t
The presence of their figure had my body coiling in on themselves as a sharp throb pulsed its way into my groin and chest, spreading a burning surge of warmth that enveloped the entirety of my aching body.
I didn’t even bother to protest with Granger, but instead, blurted out the only thing that could get the attention of the Gryffindor causing the strain on the vampire trembling on the ground like a fish out of water.
I watched Harry with a small smile curving the corners of my lips, my head angled down slightly so I could observe the way the Gryffindor’s breaths came out in steady increments along with the slow rise and fall of his bare muscled chest. I could make out the small contented smile gracing his provocative lips as he stared up at me from beneath the dark fan of his lashes, red green eyes gleaming feverishly up at me as I took in the defined shape of his cheekbones and strong jaw in transfixion.
The texture of the wood in my hand was fine and the perfect amount of weight in my hand that shook with shock and elation that seeped into my bones at the feel of one the most precious belongings to my person having to be in my hands once again.
The panic about the information Harry was giving including the revelations about what my body was capable of in the face of the assassins magic during sex, had my ears ringing with an adrenalized, anticipated buzz clouded with heavy anxiety.
But words were spilling forth from my quaking mouth before I could stop them, my response automatic to the orders Harry given me. “Okay.” My words were jilted with a rasp that had the pitch of my quiet whisper heightening and lowering in different sound intervals, wavering and hot and scared.
I wasn’t going to tell my cousin that the whole purpose of my wanting to get out this guestroom was to go downstairs and watch people indulge in their sexual needs with a more rougher play and to satisfy my own fascination of a harsher form of sex.
He’s got the figure of a seductress and is the epitome of enticing desire. His beauty was something that was untouchable with his cute pert, aristocratic nose, creamy skin with a flat stomach, a slim form, and a curvy arse.
My rambling of words were muffled by the long and warm fingers of Harry’s that kept pushing against the flat of my tongue and down my throat, consuming the entirety of my mouth with the musky taste of his appendages. My own saliva kept gathering around the edges of my stretched occupied mouth to slip its way down the curving red of my flushed cheeks as the back of my skull kept banging against the surface behind me from the
alluring as those red green eyes of his glowed within the shadowed hues of the night surrounding us while he stared me down. “You’ve got wit. You’re strong minded and stubborn, but endearing and beautiful in the silent strength you wear within and around your delicate body. You’re unpredictable, a curious little kitten that uses his claws when his buttons get pushed to the brink of his carefully constructed control. I like the challenge you bring. I like the way you act bitchy but in reality, are a sensitive being that really just wants everyone happy in their own way. So
Despite the predicament I found myself in, my prick had grown hard, blood pumping fast as I felt my flesh grow fevered at the prospect of Harry’s words and what was surely to come, panic rising high in my throat as I released an astonished mewl, my face resembling the color of the stark red pertaining to a Gryffindor’s scheme.
The head Auror of the Ministry of Magic seemed to tense up as his hard gaze went slack for a minute, the amber flecks of his eyes seeming to create a dazed sheen of copper while they flickered over the entirety of my body with a heavy focus.
People that looked to be around their mid twenties and thirties mingled together over the polished black sleek stone floor, breaths hot and heavy as the air they breathed went into one another. Bodies were slick with sweat, hair matted to their necks, shoulders, and foreheads as they moved in sync against each other to the beat of the music, lost in their own world as they sighed, moaned and whispered to their partners.
The assassin flicked his tongue out to run it along his bottom lip, white teeth peaking out as he gave me a brutally rugged smile that was filled with sinister charm.
“Your boy pussy is sucking me in so good. Greedy and needy for my cock. I’ll turn you into my toy, Kitten. Fuck, you’re beautiful and sexy and
I stared at Harry with a dawning sense of terror then, my heart plummeting into my chest at the way the Gryffindor’s words were taut and vicious, demanding and ridden with an eerie calm compared to the tensed lines of the man’s body in front of me. “I-It’s not a
This was news to me. Trisko and that bartender, Jazine, were both found dead at the nightclub right after I left and that didn’t settle well in my stomach. What made my worries worse was how it was weird that the people I associated with last night, were the ones that ended up dead.
you on the tip of my tongue with all of that magic and energy you’ve gathered. I’ve conditioned you well enough,” Zereth rumbled towards me, the heated breeze of their awful breath fanning over my face and almost making me gag on the spot.
“Granger said that both of you will go shopping for clothes tomorrow after you get settled into the new place. We can’t risk you going back to your dingy apartment and getting killed just because you want your clothes, Malfoy.” Weasley’s voice came out in a low husk, calm and reasonable to say the least.
My stomach dipped with heat then, quick and unrelenting in its sharp stimulation at the sight the Slytherin shown.
I jolted when Harry let out a disgruntled noise from the back of his throat, only for him to murmur down towards my flushed form with a look made up of neutrality. “Apparating now.”
People who did wrong in their lives, like kill someone innocent, rape, abuse, and torture just because they’re bored, needed to die.
Sliding my gaze back towards Granger, the redhead simply pressed her lips together and leveled her gaze with mine, her body fully turning to face towards my own as I twisted around to face her head on.
Harry continued on with his response as I chewed softly on my waffles with some jam, letting him speak as he crunched on another piece of bacon, watching me with the intensity of a hawk, observing my reactions to his words and causing me to squirm over the counter top with the jaded, blood red of his eyes boring holes into me. “I’m sure they know that I’m doing this to them on purpose for their safety. My magic doesn’t hurt them when I’m not around them as much and when I act like we’re not that close to each other.”
My clothes were sticking to every nook and cranny of my body, the short of my skirt becoming second skin over the shape of my inner thighs and the curves of my bum, outlining the ridiculously perky flesh of my arse for all the world to see, my embarrassment rising into a self conscious shame as heat sufficed over the pale of my cheeks.
Harry wore black fitted cargo pants with pockets lining a couple inches on the sides of both his thighs, the strong of his thighs pronounce and the muscular set of his legs showing beneath the dark material that matched the black T-Shirt he wore, the fabric light against the toned hard rock of his abs and displayed the bulging muscles of his lean arms. Harry’s shoes were black as well, combat formed and giving off this sort of presence that was similar to that of a panther, all predatory and dark and silently deadly.
Sure I wasn’t a fan of people in general, but that didn’t mean I hated everyone. I wanted to help those who have been wronged, and prevent anything like Animadverto’s intentions from happening to them.
Alrighty guys! This chapter had to be cut a little short because I had written a lot more than this before everything was deleted on my stupid old lap top. I decided to give you half of the update and thought that it was a good chapter in itself, although short. The next update most likely be an equal length, but with a little bit more. I thought it was a good idea to make this one the way it turned out to be. It was fun, it was dark and there's going to be a lot more fucked up things to come, this is just the start.
The blonde Slytherin was a reality that I could fathom. The boy was someone I could touch, taste, and smell. Draco was a clarity in the muddle of my mind that I was grateful for. While at the same time, he was someone I couldn’t understand. He felt at times someone who was beyond my reach and comprehension, one minute the boy was pure gold and the next he was made up of cold steel in the way his emotions fluctuate.
There was a subtle, single beat of a harsh and pregnant silence before Harry’s voice sounded out into the open air and over the space of my neck’s flesh, deep and inhumane as his domineering gaze bored into my eyes like he was trying to burrow himself inside of me and invade every nook and cranny of my being, his lips turning up to one side to reveal a salacious, downright filthy grin that shown a depravity and perilous sinful allure, all
Water started to build at the corners of Draco’s bright, blurred gaze, welling up and spilling down the slopes of his cheeks as he sobbed out his ecstacy, arse slapping soundly back against my hips that quickened in their pace to chase my own orgasm that kept climbing higher and higher to the point where I snarled, demonic like and containing the multiple resonance of all the raw magic inside of me that paced back and forth within my body like a caged beast, the sound slamming against the spacious walls of the mansion surrounding us.
Eyes the color of amber and hellfire stared back at me. The unearthly burnt orange glow of their gaze peered down at me, rendering me speechless as I took in the sharp lines of its cheekbones and hard jaw, lips black like the substance dripping from the tips of their horns. There was complete cruelty in the apex of their features, a look of utter boredom that could rival Harry’s own nonchalance.
The rest of the man's body was laid out over the ground like a crumpled puppet, his open neck soaking the floor in a pool of blood.
I wanted to get a reaction out of Harry for my reckless actions, I wanted to get under Harry’s skin and make him punish me. I wanted to create some mayhem because something was going on inside of my mind and body and I didn’t know what it was but I knew my mental and physical aspects were taking absolute pleasure in the chaos I was creating inside and around myself. Sure, I wanted to do this to get back at Harry for leaving me with Cho Chang and Hezian but what I really wanted was to make Harry get angry and see what the results would be.
I yelped out of shock when the demon snatched my head forward with it's fingers and slammed their lips onto mine, my chained wrists rattling about in my dismay as the demon’s mouth form fitted against mine and moved in a slow exploration that left only a sense of disgusted dread in the pit of my gut.
I perked up at the sound of Hermione’s voice, my chest filling with a warmth that I hadn’t realized could be a result from hearing the women that I thought would have despised me for the rest of eternity.
Still trying to put up a front, I let out an indignant puff of air, pursing the plush of my lips to give away a mocking pout up at the Assassin as I gave a petulant response in turn to Harry’s words. “Fine.”
My hands rattled the chains as I jerked them from the uncontrollable shivers that threatened down my back and up as I was suddenly encased in the full cooling temperature of the creature’s body that was now only a foot away from my dangling small one.
This story is going to be ending soon. I've moved on to other fics that I've been wanting to work on and I've been wanting to wrap Tenebrous up for a long time. This story, which I hold so dear to my heart, is very soon coming to an end in just a few more chapters. At most three or even less.
Black garter belts connected to the sides, back, and front of my thighs all the way over my calves and shins to disappear beneath the top hem of my blood red pumps that gleamed beneath the lighting I stood under. My long hair was left down to flow in a messy array down the length of my shoulders and back. The pale strands of my hair seemed to shimmer in the light, its color almost silver with how white my locks were while they framed the delicate lines of my face in a tousled manner.
aren’t like them. You aren’t depraved of morality … your magic is blanketed in a mixture of purity and darkness. And since you’re older than the other conduits, it seems you’ve gained a lot of power unknowingly from other dark creatures through the years you’ve lived,” Zereth murmured, it's eyes giving nothing away except a flicker of curiosity before the demon inhaled sharply through it's nose as if it was scenting me.
I kind of stared some more at him in bewilderment, most likely drooling at the sight of the man himself like the same time I first saw him in the outfit he wore for the night at his house before we came here.
With the way Zereth has been eying me as if I was some sort of buffet, I knew my time was coming up for him to suck up all the energy I carried within my body.
If I wasn’t so damn busy trying to finish up a potions project assignment that our new professor, Mr. Klington, gave to my class last bloody fucking minute, I would have already signed up on that paper.
My breath stilted in my throat then as my Adam’s apple bobbed against the object wrapped and clasped around my neck.
When I walked out of the door, I had closed it briskly behind me, the fresh crisp air of the night seeping its way into my lungs and freshening up the tension in my shoulders. I breathed in the scent of pinewoods and fresh grass belonging to the spring air that mingled within the forest surrounding the house. Cicadas sounded throughout the entirety of the woods along with the occasional twitter of a bird or owl hooting aimlessly into the moonlit darkened sky.
I could make out Neville and Luna gossiping with one another near the food table while Harry’s other old school mates just went about their business.
The Assassin settled back in a relaxed confident manner into the wooden chair, the powerful stretch of his long legs spread apart to display the prominent bulge beneath the dark material of his jeans as he rolled up the long sleeves of his shirt to his elbows and placed both his forearms over the arms of the chair.
It felt like I was getting myself into a game of predator and prey. I just had to be the sneaky little snake that I was born to be as and escape the intimidating and overwhelming lion that would seek me out if I was to be found. Harry was the hunter. I was his unknown target.
I didn’t notice the tears spilling down the flushed skin of my cheeks until liquid started to gather at the corner of my lips and slid down the stretch of my throat as I swallowed continuously around a large, aching lump that felt lodged and stuck there as I hiccuped around a whimpering sob that struck through the buzzing noise in my ears.
my lungs working faster and faster with each slight shift of Harry’s chest against my back, the light caress of his cock over my arse making my breath wheeze past my parted, astonished lips.
Harry gave a sharp grin then, vicious and perverse as he watched me down the line of his nose with the glow of his red green eyes. “Peaches. The white kind. They smell bloody delicious and taste just as good.
The redhead was causing stress on his body for the sake of making me not hurl by the end of the day from going through another quick work of a simple apparition technique.
I stood next to Harry as I felt like a chastised child while Harry looked for all the world, bored. The Assassin had his hands in the pockets of his jeans as he tilted his head at Hezian with a quirk of his brow, laid-back and calm despite having had his cock up inside of me a good twenty minutes ago.
“Oh great, just what I was looking for.” Potter murmured into my ear with the heavy rasp of his voice. I felt Potter’s hand run along the side of my hip where my switchblade was shoved into the front pocket of my jeans where I hidden it behind my coat when I decided to go out walking.
In the palm of my hand, in the deep suture of the roughened skin where this obnoxious mole covets, is the shaded beginnings of the tracing to my breakage. It is there that I couldn't cover the small tremor, the spec of control shaken and lost in the haze of my desecration, that shown my repression and the somber I've bathed myself in willingly.
Potter disregarded my existence by sliding his peridot eyes away from my own large ones and shifted his tall frame the slightest bit to let my bottom lip drag horizontally across the heat of his clothed cock in a light brush, enough to let my chest heave up and down from the erratic pace of my heartbeat and my thighs to quiver from where I sat.
So Lucius’s and Narcissas’s money was untouched by my hands up until now. I sort of had a plan to give the large amounts of cash over to charity cases, orphanages, and to countries that needed the money for food, water and such other living expenses that I had the privilege of having while others didn’t. I wouldn’t be using the money, I’d be giving it away to those who needed it.
And when I did, I figured I needed a really good explanation about what’s going on, because being surrounded by a crowd of people decked out in black armored uniforms really made my whole life even more complicated.
I’d never put Harry in any intentional harm and I had enough confidence in myself now to get us out of any sticky situation.
Harry said he was meeting up with friends. The assassin didn’t say anything about going out to find someone to shove his prick into.
“Fine.” Harry’s voice was a low noted grunt, fast and blunt as he gave me a sharp slight nod my way in an ascent to my plea, his shoulders loosening from the way he rolled his shoulders back in a minute shift, muscles flexing beneath the taut of his tan, smooth flesh, powerful in the way the cords relaxed from the stiffness they were currently put under.
Looking down at myself, I jerked back in surprise and stricken befuddlement when I saw a series of curving, curling black ink connected in endless sort of intricate designs, as if they had been engraved into my flesh with the way the ink seemed to have sunk into my skin, creating a falsity of an uprising of the drawings, but looked to be that of ancient written language, imprinted on my flesh.
With my new found magical skills and Harry being the bad ass that he was, we took in many of Animadverto’s people and saved all those they took as their victims in their morbid plans of turning them into dead fuck toys. There were no casualties. I was quite proud of that despite my magic kind of sulking over not having killed anyone. Harry got the same sentiment from how his magic felt too.
The Gryffindor could switch his mannerisms and emotions quickly without hesitation and that in itself was unnerving.
Like the Gryffindor had heard my thoughts, Harry had let the lids of his eyes open slowly, the long black of his eyelashes hanging low over the sudden pure, blood red of his glowing gaze, consumed by the crimson color whole like the floor we stood on.
He looked a little worn out but seemed fine by the way his hands trembled but his posture straight laced and looming.
Hello lovelies! Here's the chapter you have all been waiting for, this one is sort of slow but it's here to build up some plot and I have a knack for dragging things out between my future couples. I like making my characters suffer because it's so much sweeter when the time comes for Draco and Harry to finally get somewhere with each other *grins*. Next update will be next weekend. Hope you like this chapter! Please feel free to comment or ask any questions, I love them all.
Draco was only wearing jeans and a loose long sleeve black top, the clothes unfamiliar and fitting to him rather shockingly perfectly. The fabric did well to accentuate the slim curves of his hips and long limbs even as he jerked his body this way and that way as he dug his way into the demon’s body to rip apart their insides with fastidious movements.
The Gryffindors' walls had slid open inwards, revealing its signature set of it’s spiraling staircase that lead up to the house's main common room, the illuminate soft burnt orange glow of their lanterns blanketing the set of steps as it neared the top.
With a nod towards Caetia, my voice came out shaking in its exhilarated nerves, tone feverish and ardent, a sound that I rarely shown to anyone but myself outside of the emotionless mask I wore all the time. “Okay. Let’s dance and
Looking through the mirror to catch Pansy’s dusky, chocolate hued, attentive gaze, I let my lips curl up into a mischievous grin, small and rather acute although showcasing some of my excitement for how well the jeans fit my arse.
From then on, the whole “get money from my parent’s safe” plan went smoothly and was pretty boring given how stern Kevera was and how he shushed Harry and I whenever one of us tried to talk with each other or when I made an embarrassed or flustered sound when the damn Gryffindor decided to pinch my bum and nipped at the bottom of my earlobe with a dark chuckle that made me grow red and hot and bothered within a nanosecond.
“Ah, well, that’d have to be green. The crystalline kind. In depth and strikingly calming to the eye.” I answered Harry’s question with a small lilt in my voice, a tiny smile tracing the curl of my mouth as I let my fingers run down the length of Harry’s cheekbone to the underside of his jaw, slipping them through the thick locks of his dark hair at the nape of his neck, playing with the short hairs there.
And I liked seeing Draco unable to move from beneath me. Stuck. Forced to take my cock like the slut that he is for me.
“What do you want in exchange, because surely, you wouldn’t want to go through all this trouble just to keep an ex death eater safe and sound. What do you want from me, Hezian?” I spoke with a finality in my voice, pitch coming out in a steely tone as I looked into Hezian’s odd blue hued eyes.
A sniding, malicious remark resounded inside of my head with my own thoughts that I couldn’t help but push forth out into an acknowledgement.
And Harry continued to speak, his voice groaning low in self deprecation as his illuminate eyes flicked down to my lips, the shadow of his eyes further darkening as his snarl tipped up some more to reveal the pristine whites of his gnashed teeth. Animalistic and
And then his eyes met mine, the heavy laden scorch in his shadowed green red eyes pulsating with each cruel breath he took, his pupils dilated and almost taking up the entirety of his gaze like the shadowed strands of his unruly hair.
The pain mindling with pleasure had my head spinning and my arse absentmindedly backing up against Harry’s snapping pelvis as I released a yell from the part of my mouth, my lungs collapsing in on itself from how the Assassin was pushing my gasps from out of my throat. His cock was relentless, pushing into me with a brutal fixation as he shook my frame over the table, the rough pants that passed his own mouth caressing over my cheek as I was left to rest my head on his shoulder and just take it.
“Sir, I think you’ve got the wrong person.” I whispered it lowly to the both of us, licking my bottom lip in an anxious flick of my tongue while the man’s beady, black eyes narrowed in on the movement with a leer.
I couldn’t help the splutter of my mouth in indignation, tearing my gaze away from Harry’s as I felt my body heat up under the Gryffindor’s. I clenched my hands into tight fists repeatedly, pressing my lips together to keep myself from screaming out in embarrassment.
Turning my head back around, I squeaked out when I found my face only a few mere centimeters away from Harry's, the cigar out of his mouth and placed between his fingers as the intoxicating scent that he carried waft towards my person and his warmth enveloped me whole, rendering me immobile.
And with the way my groin buzzed with renewed warmth, it seemed, to my utter terror, that I was turned on.
” Harry’s groaned out his words in a deep tone as he dragged my limbs towards his lower half while at the same time shoved his cock rapidly up and
And Kikue was spluttering on the floor like the prissy bitch that he was, the dark of his eyes narrowed as he struggled upon the floor in the midst of his scramble to get back up and most likely rush after me like a linebacker.
I squealed when Harry had suddenly let his other free hand come around to grasp the slender line of my bared throat, the apex of his heated palm pressing against my Adam’s apple, digging his fingers into my neck with a comforting squeeze and stalling my blood flow.
Harry knocked his teeth against my own as he went back to kissing me, mouth fucking me with his tongue and making me taste myself. He tangled his tongue with mine, our moist breaths heating between the both of us as we breathed each other in as if we were both starving for one another.
. I want you to stay where I want you to while Weasley and Granger arrive and help them out with the killing. I sent a mental link call towards them with my magic so they should be apparating here soon enough. I can’t apparate out of here because those creatures, which are called “Carbonou”, have strong scent tracers embedded into their skin, they can smell my magic which they are meant to track for, hunt, and kill. So we’ll just be followed unless we kill them first. Which I plan to do.” The assassin’s voice lowered into a dark lull, coaxing and heavy in the words he emitted out loud.
Harry’s voice lowered into a deep timbre now, his tone shifting with a harsh cruelty in the disconcerting nonchalance of his words. “These children of both elf and wizard were commonly known to be targeted by demons that were called ‘Sinisters’, a name that fitted them quiet well. They’re fucked creatures, as bad and powerful as myself. They were the first demons that had come from dark magic. And they love to
I didn’t know if the girl gave me the right information, given she was drunk off her arse, but an adventure was calling out for me and I was sure I would find some weed at some point in the party while I’m here.
And as I watched the back of Harry’s head, the obsidian chipped strands of his hair seeming even darker than the Stygian of the narrow staircase, I shook, breath halting in my working throat and my chest tightening with burning dread and overbearing heat.
With my arms trembling like they had their own earthquake rumbling in the depths of my nerves, I looked over my shoulder with the watery hue of my gaze, capturing Harry’s eerily enticing glow of crimson and peridot green that shown a wicked satisfaction in the way I bit down on my lip and held back the muffled whimper trying to rip its way out of my mouth when I couldn’t catch the violent swipe of Harry’s hand coming down over my arse again, that sadistic smirk playing across the curve of the Gryffindor’s provocative lips.
My body whipped up into the air, my breaths wheezing passed my lungs in a shocked outburst as I was hefted up and over broad shoulders like I was merely a piece of paper, heaved up and perched over a familiar muscled wide shoulder as my flesh grew hot from a simple touch that inflamed me from the inside and out.
on my own keening whimper, ripping my mouth away from Harry’s so I could watch his face as I went to wrap my hand around Harry’s girth to stroke up and down, his cum making the slide smooth as I rubbed at the tip at the same time I twisted my wrist in a smooth motion that had the assassin’s lids lowering and his mouth part on an exhale of a shaky breath that fanned my mouth.
As Weasley and Granger fought off the creatures barging towards them with a blood thirst that were displayed across the upturned sneer of their downturned, long snouts, one going down after another with the magic and shots being procured upon them as intestines, limbs and red spewed every which way, it was Weasley that yelled out to Harry this time. “Fucking hell, Harry! Now!” The redhead's voice was husked in a quaking drawl, a panic and tiredness coveting his words.
Even though Harry told me to keep quiet, I couldn’t help but babble as I looked up at the assassin’s face, the set of his succulent lips hard lined as the jade and sangria hue of his eyes stared forward, all composed and heavily focused, handsome in his concentration. “W-why can’t we just apparate on out of here-”
, enough is enough. I’ll take your cruelty and the kindness I know you carry around deep inside of that vicious heart of yours, so fucking explain to me what the problem is and we’ll
I stared up at Harry, the pale set of my lashes fluttering softly as I tried to not give into the urge to push myself further into the couch in hopes of having the furniture swallow me whole in the face of my ashamed embarrassment as well as my own vulnerability.
“You’re just petty that I got the man you couldn’t have, so don’t take your anger out on me. And I don’t need to put myself into a low life of a position that deals with giving all sorts of people, mostly bad ones, weapons to go around killing each other to make myself ‘useful’.” My voice was quick, breezing past the part of my lips as I stared blandly back at Chang from where I sat.
Harry had given out a threatening growl that shook the length of my back as his chest vibrated with the sound, his mouth nearing my ear as he bent his head down to let his teeth graze the shell of my ear to elicit a broken moan to bubble up out of my throat when he shoved his hips into my lower half again.
I didn’t even really put much thought into the fact that I was going to try and kill him of all things!
I didn’t have a wand to cast a stinging hex at my boss in retaliation for treating me like complete shit.
I got to the point where I only remember the moment I got Zereth to fall backwards and land on their back after I hit them with my magic straight into their chest in the middle of my fight with them. Then the rest of my memories were a static timeline filled with blurred images of blood and guts and the sound of tittering laughter that seemed to keep coming out of my mouth.
I was both scared and turned on. I had no idea how to handle the combined emotions that left me quaking in Harry’s arms.
.” The man’s words came out in a slow mumble, the light of his eyes staring me down as I tried not to flinch away from the man’s sudden closeness.
The man watched me from where he stood at the bottom of the stairs, a slow uptick on the side of his succulent lips rising into a salacious, downright
The magic was sinister and rapturous, coveting the whole of my body as I sucked in a surprised gasp and stared, wide eyed, at the way Potter released the air from his lungs in an appallingly leisure like motion, the heavy jade and red of his eyes brewing with shadowed hues as the Gryffindor traced the way the coat ripped down the length of my arms and fell in a heap at my feet with his gaze.
So originally, this chapter was longer and I decided to leave a good portion of it out and put it as its own chapter because really, it is. This update will show you guys a little more insight on how Harry and Draco's characters are and introduces some new characters, mwaha. Next update is really going to be a roller coaster ride, so bear with me! Thanks for the support and hope you guys are liking the story because I have so much fun writing it!
Potter let out a hum, low and assessing as his eyes seemed to draw in the expression of my face, watching and observing with an unnerving focus. “Not like there’s much to see, so don’t get all defensive. Besides, I only came here to tell you that Granger is waiting for you.”
The line of my forehead between my brows were creased, the sides of my eyes crinkling to display an agonized pinch as my gaze swept down over the length of my bare flesh, the slopes and dips of my gangly figure a creamy pale that were such a contrast with the brand etched into the side on the bottom of my back, a little above my right arse cheek.
When I made that one push against Harry’s shoulder, I said something that I knew I shouldn’t have, but the assassin was making me go out of my mind and my stupid crush on him made me feel like such a pathetic git that the only response to my emotions that I could come up with was being a complete prissy bitch.
Shifting from one foot to the next, I sucked in the water of my bottom lip as I turned my head away in an effort to keep Potter from seeing the frustration on my face.
But my father caught me and told me to stop being ridiculous. Lucius told me that I shouldn’t care for Harry like that.
As if just realizing that there was another person with Harry, the boy unlatching himself slightly from the Gryffindor's tall, fit frame with a tiny shift. The boy's arms still hooked around Harry's neck as he turned his body in my direction, his prick poking against his panties as he raised a brow up at me. The cocoa shade of his eyes gleamed as he pursed his lips my way and spoke with less enthusiasm then he had when he talked to Harry a couple seconds ago. “Now aren’t you a
up into the air, the ache in my knees throbbing as I felt them slip over the granite of the steps in my wet state and become spread out into a filthy sprawl.
I watched, my mind dizzying in perfunctory inappropriate haven, with the large of my eyes at the bulge of Harry’s lean muscles in his arms straining and tensing as he reached around me from both sides with his hands. He gripped my wrists with his long fingers, wrapping his hands tight around them, and bringing them up to nudge my limpet hands over the bottom of the handles belonging to the bike.
“Ngh!” I murmured around a broken whine, my mind hazy and left to soak in the sensation of my punishment as the pain and pleasure mingled like the fusion of a drug in your system, warm and heavy, comforting in the dizziness.
After watching the Discovery Channel for two hours straight when Harry had left me to go mingle with the folks in the club, I decided to take a nap that lasted about another two hours. And now that I was awake and my usual grumpy self, my annoyance at having being kept in my room reaching tremendous levels, my skin felt as if it was itching with a sort of hyperactive awareness of my deep
I heard Granger let out a cackle of enjoyment when I leaned back at the sight of the creature coming at me full force in an blurry instant, closing my eyes for a perpetual bite or a beat down. But after a few minutes, there was no feeling of scratching or the ripping of my flesh.
The Gryffindor’s features were set into a look of severe concentration, provocative lips set into a near frown as his illuminate gaze stared past me to the nearest wall behind us, brows dipped in contemplation.
It both made me and my magic happy, so it was nothing jarring to my personal psyche, not anymore at least or not as much as killing used to affect me.
I’ve heard about Harry having to live with his horrible family when he wasn’t in Hogwarts as a child. Even though I didn’t say much on it, what with having the same situation as him in dealing with my own family, I always thought that it was wrong for Harry to be in a house with such disgusting people. No child deserved the abusive treatment Harry got. There was a time once where I stood in front of Dumbledore’s room and was about to come barging in and telling him to take Harry into his home instead of sending him back off to his godsawful family.
I whipped my head towards Harry, brows nose diving in displeasure as I let out a huff of frustration, stepping closer to the Gryffindor who was not looking at me like I wanted him to so I could get his full attention forcefully.
The guest room that Krum let Harry and I stay in for the next two weeks was huge. The singular term “room” should be turned into a plural phrase since there was more than one room in this large space. The place was decked in pristine dark Mahogany wooden floors and walls with the tiniest golden trims lining the bottom, top and sides of the walls. Once entering through the large area, the place opened up to a living room covered with plush dark furniture and a flat screen TV that took up practically half the wall to its left. There were two walk in entrances on each side of the living room that catered to mine and Harry’s separate rooms.
What made things more worse was how I saw everyone in the room veer their curious gazes over to where Harry and I stood, eyes observant and dark, some widening with shock at having to see
Once again, Sirius had laughed like a baboon when he saw my balance struggle on the heels I was given. It was my first time wearing such things and I was seconds away from seething expletives towards my cousin if not for Caetia snapping at his boyfriend to keep his mouth shut on my behalf.
“You forgot a spot.” The deep timbre of a familiar voice sliced into my hazed thoughts, rumbling and filling with a low deceptive murmur that made my body jump about two feet up into the air as I let out a significantly high pitched, broken squeal in my surprise.
But was this the way that I wanted Harry to touch me? The assassin had clearly said that this was a punishment, to teach me a lesson, but did Harry think of this as anything more than disciplining the bratty Malfoy that he knew since we were young?
The Assassin lurched forward, the movement fast enough to make my words halt in my throat at the pure animalistic want construed into his face, gleaming eyes digging into my gaze as if Harry was trying to puncture his energy and the entirety of his mind into me with a cruel ferocity.
Bloody hell, my insecurities on top of everything else that I was in ferment over was not helping the nerves rioting in my veins at the moment.
Even when the pain on my arse grew in tremendous ache, I didn’t want Harry to stop spanking me like the brat Harry and I knew that I was.
I know what Harry was saying was vital and unmistakably important to the both of us, but I  completely ignored his warning about the bad consequences that will occur if we physically got intimate with one another and focused on Harry simply
Harry and Sirius must have used his magic very covertly for me to not sense it and for any of those creatures not to as well.
And the man was most possibly death’s relative or maybe he was the Grim Reaper, keeping to himself although carrying around this harsh prominence. He had this sharp bluntness to himself that made him untouchable in the eyes of others, careless and making trouble everywhere he went while carrying an attitude that made him look down on others, rivalling Harry’s own egoistic personality.
The assassin thrusted the heat of his long tongue in time with the shoving of his finger in and out of my spasming hole, the shivering of my frame turning into short bursts of twitches and spasms that had my whines growing hotter and higher in their intonation as I shook across the floor.
“Full offense here, but playing Mario Cart beats going to a dull party anyday.” I let my mouth form fit around my words, tone soft in the neutral hitch of my voice, complacent and uninterested to fornicate my boredom towards the subject of conversation we were having.
The boy spoke up above the loud thrum of the music, the chocolate hue of his eyes gazing up at the assassin beneath the fluttering of his dark lashes as a sly smile curled his lips, mischievous and provocative. “I’m happy you decided to come on over and bring your friends! I haven’t seen you for a while, Harry.”
when you went down on your knees to grab that stupid fork, you arched your back like the kitten that you are and wiggled your arse so lovingly. Such a
I shifted from where I stood, trying to alleviate the warmth I felt between my thighs, mouth slightly parted as I took in Potter’s hair. It was messier than ever, mussed up and pitch black in their tousled and disheveled strands, reminding me of the dark beginnings of midnight and ink, soft and silky looking. The shadowy locks of his hair were similar to that of the darkest depth of the ocean, smoky tinged and deafeningly onyx in its wake.
What it was … yes – that's what  “it” was. “It” was collected into this sort of closed off chamber that I’ve shuddered and stitched together in deafening silence with these other mentally unstable and shame ridden impressions.
The woman before me was outstandingly beautiful, her auburn hair falling down her back in spiraling strands at her curving, small waist. Granger wore pale pink slacks with cream colored high heels and a silky white top that shown off her goddess like figure. Doe brown eyes stared back at me as I suddenly felt very inadequate next to her.
With the line of my spine propped up against the headboard of Harry’s bed, I shifted slightly to make sure that my butt wouldn't become numb from how long I've been sitting, it having been for at least a good few hours.
I was panting, glaring down at Harry with the opal, cobalt hue of my eyes as my neck and cheeks were stained a ruby red.
Then I was being lifted up and off Harry’s shoulders to be slammed into a wall, the air currently forced out of my lungs at the harsh impact jarring my spine.
Sweat formed on his forehead as I slowly jerked him off, his dark brows furrowed as he watched me with his now messy black hair falling into his eyes,  peering at me through the dark curtain of his locks. His gaze glowed like a damn demon in the darkness of the night.
Harry didn’t reply to Granger’s words. The Gryffindor stood with blood rising up to his ankles as the muscles in his shoulder blades and abs rose and fell in deep relaxed breaths, as if he was trying to keep a hold of his composure as his jaw flexed in cruel concentration.
I decided to tell Harry about everything that had happened as the assassin listened quietly to my word vomit in my explanation of what Zereth had put me through. After having explained what happened while Harry had been searching for me I decided to apologize then at the way I watched Harry’s face contort into a look of anguish at my words.
“Draco? Hey, are you okay? Look at me.” The light delicate pitch of Caetia’s voice broke through the haze of my crashing hysteria, my head snapping up in the direction of Sirius’ boyfriend’s voice as I heaved in a large breath that seemed to sting in the depth of my lungs.
I watched in hushed shock at how Draco’s brightened magic seemed to encase the entire room in its basking light, glowing from out of his pores along with the multiple demons’ and dark creatures’ marks on his body burning an illuminate amber. The atmosphere seemed to pulsate with his power, a raw form of pure chaotic energy that made my ears ring with the significance of his brilliance and my eyes burn with his glaring light.
creatures, most of the times against their own will because they would talk to them through mind meld and get them to lose their own sanity enough to martyr people for a creature or demon’s gain. The two children were made into becoming killers, powerful ones with the help of whatever dark magic the demon or creatures would give them and their own, and they didn't mind because of how they grew up without any love or affection. They were conduits for dark magic and given that elves loved to initiate themselves into the dark arts, the parents probably wanted to give their offspring a handful of that fucked magic.” Harry raised his brows then as he stared down at me with an unearthly intensity in the glow of his emerald, blood red eyes, causing my breaths to halt in my lungs as I tried sorting through what the assassin was telling me.

good to revel in the pain and pleasure that the penetration induced inside and outside of me. Especially since it was being done, not by myself as I always had done, but by someone whom I’ve imagined doing this to me for years.
Curling the hand that was outstretched towards my neck into my shaking palm, I brought my arm back down to stare, dumbfounded, back at my reflection.

Harry’s house carried a sinister enticement to it that made my body break out in tremors, of both fear and excitement.
, you’re alright. It’s going to be okay. You’re safe and here with me and I’m not going to let anything hurt you. You cry all you want. I’m sorry for not getting to you sooner, Baby. You’re alright now. You’re strong. You were such a good boy,” Harry spoke out to me in the deep vibrato of his voice. His breaths tickled the skin of my cheeks as he dipped his head down so he could start placing open mouthed kisses along the slope of my neck. The heat of his breaths mingling into my exposed skin had my breaths quivering as my cries died down into soft exhales and stutters.

My head was pinned to the wall behind me now, the back of my skull resting against the surface as my breaths quickened in heated rupture. I swallowed around a dry throat, my Adam’s apple bobbing as I tried gulping oxygen into my lungs with a feverish build from the swift need to gain back the breaths I lost in the wake of Harry’s touch.
Sirius stared at me with his mouth in a line of perpetual discomfort, the first time I’ve ever seen him show such an open, conflicted expression since I’ve met him. There was a long stretch of silence that passed between the two of us, my heart beating harder than usual at the rousing emotions of fright and dark excitement at what could happen if I was caught by Harry and how much
