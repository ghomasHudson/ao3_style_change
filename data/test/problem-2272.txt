Mr. Weasley was a good guide, walking him down the street and pointing out interesting facts about things Harry had never seen before. At some point they ended up stationed in front of the Brooms, a heated discussion on what the hell Quidditch was. Harry tested out how safe he really was and deliberately argued albeit gently against a few points that had Arthur brighten.
Of course! The sword and the stone! Merlin had helped the four build Hogwarts—he slammed his forehead on the rocky floor at the next hit on his back. He could feel the blood drip from his skin, hot and sticky to his face as he looked back up at what was hopefully a magical sword meant for a muggle to wield. It could only help, and with his clothes soaked there was no way his poppers were going to work now.
The house was empty unfortunately, the estate itself locked down till the Muggle sentence would be passed on the Dursley family soon. It was a loss Bella would mourn. All the best things you had to fight for and this was only the first step. Sure, a brutal muggle death would have held her for a bit, but hopefully she could just impart what she was going to do to her disgusting brother and his misfit family on all the available furniture. This just had to give her an opportunity.
Finally, after a moment and the cool air had a chance to attach itself to the both of them a sudden poking at Draco’s entrance had him snap his eyes open to look down at the out of view hand. A flexing of muscle along arm reflected the sudden shift in pressure as the finger began to swirl around his hole’s muscles. Sucking in a breath he felt the pad of the digit slip in just at the surface and rim the spasming ring. The stroking coaxed him to relax slowly and the finger slipped in.
“Malfoy.” The other sighed, the sound of defeat clear.
Draco laughed; the sound made his heart soar. “He looks like he likes you.”
“Alright, do you think that did it or do we have to pollenate a lot of them?” He turned to Draco who was now attempting to copy him with a bit of reluctance.
“Don’t you ‘just a legend’ me! The cornerstones are the runes that hold up the school, magically bound power of the three houses keep it together without Slytherin when they got scared, he would try to bring the castle down to kill the muggle-borns inside.”
“Sure.” He simply took a few grateful breathes as he helped cover the mandrakes feet and it almost seemed to exhale in thanks as it curled inward.
“I sense your assumptions about me. I haven’t done this either. I can only guess how we’ll be crucified for this later let alone how it might manage to work out however long we do this.”
Kreacher was fast to bring the two boys’ mugs of hot chocolate as they stumbled the rest of the way into the room and found their little perches to sit on. Hedwig glided in to fling herself into the tree, it didn’t hold her well and it sunk a bit, but Hedwig was nothing if not stubborn. Her presence made up for the lack of Tom and Nagini some. Grandma Walburga’s frame couldn’t be moved since it had been charmed, but Harry was pleasantly surprised to find a similar frame now hung on the far wall where her and who he assumed was Orion Black sat together talking quietly.
“Goodbye Harry Potter.” He went to leave somewhere he could use the portkey.
“I’m seriously considering your old offer to just hide out with you at Grim’s. I’ll go back and he’ll just be mad at me for everything the whole time I’m there.” Draco sounded tired as he spoke, the rush of fear having zapped his strength when it had left him.
“What makes you think I don’t want both!”
“That’s a wonderful idea Harry.” Hagrid beamed as he pulled out a slice of cooked chicken breast. “Come er’ Hill we got a nice bit o’ gobble for you.” Hagrid cooed and the dog’s eyes bulged before he sprinted into the half giant’s leg.
“What!” Dolores screeched, cutting off when Fudge gave her a stern look.
Draco helped keep him busy and awake till they had him in a bed in the Infirmary being looked over. No one noticed the little green beetle that scuttled away and out the front doors.
Thank you for reading this with me, it's strange to basically daydream with subtitle everyone else can just read over your head whenever they want, but it's special to have you here.
“It wouldn’t be my place to tell his story and I would like to retain his trust as much as I’m sure you’d be accepting. For now, why not just try to make friends with the boy. And word of caution, go easy on the magic around him and don’t push him on it.” Arthur ruffled Ron’s hair as he tried to promptly escape.
“About what?” Remus was holding Draco up and he could tell, he hauled the young man into his arms and brought him into the sitting room.
“You are right Draco, you wanting to be around me isn’t wrong and wanting to stay friends with them isn’t either. This times just more personal right? More important to you? If their worth it they’ll be happy knowing you care so much about what they think.” Harry reached over to grab his hand. “I don’t know what else to say about it.”
“Poor dear! Traumatized! A tragic outcome to a—”
Sirius looked like hell when he rushed out of the bedroom, pulling on clothes as he went, hair knotted and unbrushed. Tom walked into Harry’s room where Remus was going to grab the requested sample of his scent for Tom, Sirius following after them. Aside from the extra clothes on the floor that obviously shouldn’t have been there and warranted a discussion with the two young occupants later nothing looked amiss.
“Why would you say that? It has a picture of a very lovely tree.” He holds up the box and the pieces inside jingled around making Harry snort.
“Did I just hear what I think I just heard?” Hermione asked in a low voice.
“Then it’s settled. We’ll be back by three or four. Before it gets too late to waste time. Meet up at the square first so we aren’t crowding that grump’s front door.” Draco nodded and the group seemed satisfied as they started to split off in their own directions.
“Are you going to come with us?” He asked hopefully.
“Draco, let me go, I have to go to the bathroom.” Harry worked to pry the other boys fingers off.
“It’s alright Draco, I can take statements from you at any time. We can just do bits every other day if you want. That’s already a lot to file away, so thank you.” Tom gave him an excuse before lifting over a plate of fudge squares.
no beta we die like men! I had no idea how I wanted this to go until yesterday and I'm still not sure. Here we go anyways.

Harry was bouncing on the balls of his feet as he made his way through the different compartments and open seating of the other wagons. Three tries and he spotted the snowy blonde hair he was looking for tucked in a corner with a small group surrounding him. He had meant to say something, to call out, but when he heard a rather loud boy beside Draco he froze.
Narcissa had planned to wait. To wait till the mud bloods had come back to school. She knew Bella would have wanted that, but things going how they were it was far more pressing to kill Albus. For all she knew it would take until the students returned to find what she needed.
“Gee I wonder why.” Draco joined in to help Harry since he was clearly unable to form sentences at this point. “No one ever lets poor Moody have any fun, huh.”
“I think you’ll find it is, we are the guides and the protectors, it is as you said! As long as I live this existence it is my right!”
“Yours is not so bad either. Now, once the child services investigate and find your living conditions unacceptable, you’ll be held at a representative’s home till they can call the meeting discussing removing the Dursley’s custody and then afterwards the adoption I mentioned. Understand?”
Sirius and Remus were partially trying not to look at their new son and the rest of their minds were dedicated to fidgeting in worry now that they had him back. “What could have possessed you to do something so dangerous?” Again, Remus was the more put together of them and spoke first. Sirius gulped his sudden nerves; another wave of adrenaline was primed for a fight or flight situation this just wasn’t.
“I bet I can handle more than you.” Harry challenged with an ember of excitement in his eyes as he let Draco close in on him.
“We’ll be back an hour before its time to head back, maybe sooner? Early dinner at the pub again?” Harry raised his hand to call for the vote, earning Crabbe and Goyle’s immediate approval.
“I’m glad he’s doing better. I was a little worried when I noticed he was here.” Draco conversed, his mind split between action and talk distractedly.
Draco choked on a sob of need as he opened up wider. The stretch burning a little and then quickly turning into not enough, barely soothed by the continuous glide of the member going deeper till he felt the base hit him like an unwanted wall that stopped the sensation. That was until the new part of himself started to recede as Harry slid out before thrusting back in. The satisfying punch to the inside of his gut pushed all his other feelings and thought out as he fell into the rhythm of pure need. He whimpered for more and Harry pounded in harder as best he could. Draco’s back slid up on the sheets and dragged back down when he was grabbed by the hips, the movement was throwing them and the bed around and Harry did his best to keep momentum as he rammed into Draco’s prostate again and again.
“The honeymoon over already?” Pansy seemed to speak for everyone. Crabbe and Goyle looked pissed but let Blaze keep them back for now.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—” He was gasping and it was impossibly difficult. The two men recognized a panic attack when they saw it and Draco wasn’t stupid, just inexperienced.
“Like I need a reason to sit next to my own cousin at dinner? I couldn’t care less about your little muggle problems.” Draco scoffed, smiling when he got a laugh.
“You wouldn’t have almost died in the storeroom…” He murmered under his breath so gently Harry almost didn’t hear it.
The route through Surrey’s was split into numerous different paths. Harry had waited till he was at the bottom of the area before hopping off the bus so he was relatively close to his destination. He worked his way up the incline of the dirt path to England’s highest natural summit point. Leith Hill.
Remus was out of bed first, he had soothed Sirius back to sleep before his insomnia could take root again. Whoever it was, if this was about Sirius’ informant work, he hoped it could wait till morning. When he made his way down to the front hall, he noted the chill of the floorboards and cast a fire in the fireplace with a flick of his wand and a silent spell. Whoever this was had their hidden address, making letting them in an easy decision since it was undoubtably safe. He didn’t notice the two shadows sneaking behind him to catch a peek as he opened the door.
“Ron!” Hermione chastised.
“Yes sir.”
For now, he settled for throwing his legs back blindly to try and catch Draco between them in the laziest way possible. Draco swatted at him as they wrestled, out of the room and back to Remus and Sirius they caught sight of Kreacher laying out supplies on the coffee table in the sitting room.
“What if everyone on a team went after the snitch though? Then even an open goal wouldn’t matter.”
Hopefully this is starting to look like a story now, I'm writing the fourth chapter right now and wondering how much legalese I should research. I also need to make a proper name for Cho Chang since it's two surnames and not a real Chinese name. Apparently translaters gave her the name Zhāng Qiū, but I want something that has importance in the story so I can expand on the idea that china's wizarding world would have a lot of Divination and name meanings would be given through that because both are such an important aspect to Chinese culture.
If some foul play here and there helped him get to where he was who was he to complain? It was their faults for being so bloody easy.
“Agreed. We can divine properties from ordinary things by using a solution on them, so let’s just pick up whatever looks interesting.”
“Yes.” He answered for a moment till he could make out a few soft laughs swept along by the wind. “Malfoys take care of their own.” He echoed his father’s lesson. “You are my own. Nothing can change that now, even if you told me to mind my own business I wouldn’t anymore.”
Thank you for reading again, I'll never get tired of saying that at the end of these. You are a special bean, each and every one of you and I'm glad I get to give back to this community as much as I've taken by making this. I'll see you all next week.
They had saved the Head Master form a tragic end and they would do the same for Hogwarts. If they left it as is there was no telling when the cornerstone would be found and used, no telling what would become of Tom’s soul. Tom, the very man he now felt an unwavering debt to for giving him his family. As much apprehension as he continued to feel at putting himself in the line of fire it seemed an inescapable part of himself that was taking shape into something truly unstoppable.
The sound of footsteps was gone ages ago, but the imminent feeling of danger never wavered. It was the wisps job to pull him towards a place he needed to go, the term loosely coined as it was, meant it was now trying to get him to move again. It had a different idea than hiding and after Gellert was out of sight it seemed content to continue.
“You have to take it Albus, listen to me, you need it. Please, please take it love.” He felt tears prick at his eyes as Albus once again looked on in some kind of confusion. “It’s not time for you to die yet.”
The two adults of the house had forgone the talk of forcing the two kids into their own beds for their morning nap, that would count as their rest for the night they missed, on account of them looking like they needed the closeness. Sirius and Remus kept a window open for an owl, and the floo in the corner of their eyes waiting for news on Albus. The two sat down nibbling some well-earned breakfast.
“Okay, I get what you’re thinking now.” Draco started riffling through the pages now, skimming through the definitions of different beings’ affinities.
“These kids really need to get over it.” Harry shook his head exasperated at the ever-familiar shock on people’s faces as they saw him. “I’m not doing anything worth this much concern.”
“No, what happens. Oh no, don’t tell me—”
“You’ll have to talk to them eventually. We don’t know what they’re going through until you ask.” Harry finally dropped his quill to stare Draco down.
“What does my precious child see in you? I thought Bella would have taught him better. That Mudblood wasn’t good enough for her and you aren’t good enough for my baby.” She punctuated with another hit of her spell, she was catching her breath now, voice a bit more composed like her usual self. “Did you really think something disgusting like you, with no magic, no soul—could ever be enough for us?” Another strike.
___________________________________________
Suddenly they were in some kind of onyx subway station. People everywhere, not bothering to glance his way as they shot out of green flames or jumped in them and incinerated. Harry stared wide eyed trying to understand where he was.
“It used to be a small upper-class home before, when the area was being made into a village. Original everything, like most of Hogsmeade actually.”
Harry stared into space for a long moment, of all the things to say. “What did you do?” He whispered; a look of terror spread on his face. Draco watched him like a hawk at his reaction.
“And you’re sure you can handle more?” Draco quirked a brow at him, deflecting from his own nerves.
“I still do not want you associating with this Black heir.” He spat the words with disgust. “You are better than that and it puts you at a disadvantage. You must keep close to your friends and maintain an image fitting of a future Lord. This is an order. Whatever this is, it will end here.”
With that in mind it was time he started experimenting.
“Are you two really in love like the paper said?” She was looking at them like they were the most interesting thing in the world. The rush of embarrassment was only intensified with the number of other eyes and straining ears on him.
“The fuck you look’ in at? D, think you gave him a concussion?” Piers laughed.
“Ha ha, very funny. I just wanted to tell you that I think you’re really great okay!” Harry blurted out loudly. He threw his head around to look away in embarrassment.
Harry was leaning hard into Draco, arms weakly clinging around his neck and shoulder where he could grip his white button down. He had managed to stand, incredibly, after receiving what the boy had described to Draco as a horrible death curse. Draco still had to half carry him at the least with one arm though.
“Some people are going to be investigating your treatment, I also talked to a relative that wants to adopt you. I trust them, and they would take care of you.”
Thank you for every hit, kudos,comment and consideration you give this work. I can't hardly wait to start a new one in the future. For now though my Unus Annus resolution will keep going even after the poor dorks that motivated me to finally do this. May Unus and Annus rest in pieces and their legends live on in us all.
Remus shushed him and Tom came out of the other room to watch the seen in worry.
“What are they saying at the ministry?” Remus seemed to be taking charge of this discussion, the dark silhouette of Black hovering a bit behind him with a grave look plastered to his face.
It was true that although he’d dried off, he was still loose enough to hasten up a bit and Harry obliged him. He shoved his second finger in and scissored them apart as he shifted his cockhead to the entrance. Its precum was drooling off in thick droplets now. He pulled out to use his wet hand to slick up his shaft as he pushed inside with the velvet tip.
Before long he found Gellert, looking through every scrap of paper on a table in the war room like his life depended on it.
He had Albus and they had never talked like this. Despite the fact that no one could know about them with the current world’s challenges even in the magical world it was such a non-choice it made him grit his teeth. It was a bitter moment, something he was not by any measure prepared for at this point. He could only hope the rejection he would be forced into giving would not sway the girl’s tenuous views as a pureblood.
“Are you excited Hedwig?” He turned to her to pet the puffed-up chest of feathers she presented him with. He’d never had a pet before, would have been terrified of something Dudley could kill, but Hedwig was safe and he reassured himself of that as he spoiled her with treats.
“She wouldn’t need a written riddle to know her own answer, but she was always artistic about her puzzles which is why there has to be a clue as to the answer. I think you have the right idea.” Albus encouraged them.
Draco listened in mock disapproval as his father would have wanted. He had returned home in a state and Draco wasn’t too guilty at the joy it instantly gave him. Harry was safe. The thought was enough to almost ruin his act as he listened happily to every little complaint of how things had gone.
Tom had managed a scent spell on Cotton, one of the stranger ones, the little owl nodding its head into his hand as he stroked her chin and between her eyes as payment. Big eyes fluttered up at him as he watched her relax. Now he just had to find the corresponding recipient based on what he smelled. The best part? No one could detect what he did because it was already done and had no lingering signs like a trace spell. Ruddy had once told him it was his blood hound magic.
Beside him a mangy dog trotted over, matted black fur did nothing to fill out its figure. He leaned over to pet its head. The big eyes looking up at him made him smile, dogs were something special, they could tell your intentions with a sniff and if they saw you were good, they loved you. It was probably the very reason the Dursley’s hated them, Vernon called them barking rabid mutts.
Pomfrey watched with satisfaction as her patient relaxed and the young wizard sat on the other side of the bed where she stood followed, shoulders slumping and eyes drooping as Draco finally allowed himself to let go of his tension.
“Promise.” Harry felt strangely exhausted, just thinking about it made him want to flop back down on the mattress. “It was all a bunch of rubbish anyway; it was like I was still in bed and waking up and people were upset and then you woke me up.” He mumbled.
Harry licked his lips nervously. “No one cares what happens to me Draco, when uncle Vernon finds out you tried to ruin his reputation, I’ll be more than locked in a cupboard. You have to take it back. Please.” He walked over and shook Draco’s shoulders madly; the blonde could feel the heavy tremor in the grip. “You don’t know me, we’re not friends,” he teared up,” take it back. Please, Draco you have to.”
As he stumbled, he reached out but couldn’t feel the walls, panic rose up and when he tried touching his face or hands, there was just… nothing. There was nothing there and a part of him wondered if he was even moving despite the subconscious knowledge that told him he was. It was just another trap, he had to remember that, but with so much of his life in the dark with no way out this was in all actuality a literal nightmare.
“Draco wanna fight the winner?” He laughed over to the Slytherin who stood once more with his friends. He looked more like himself again, like when he was with Harry alone, it was a relief.
“It’s just a formality.” Draco waved away.
The muggles would burn them, draw and quarter them with the growing list of new inventions they came up with daily now with the growth of their church. The wizards would shun and curse them for the abnormalities even their own kind could not look past yet. But neither cared, if anything the fact that they sinned made the act all the sweeter for they damned themselves and each other in their shared embrace. They would live to see the world change in so many ways, while they traveled hand in hand as witness and protector.
“It felt like one by the end didn’t it?” Draco whispered back avoiding his godfather’s eyes.
Harry watched Draco clenching and unclenching his fists. The weight of his and everyone else’s wands was heavy in his pocket.
It was as Draco was about to knock that they heard a resounding set of bangs from the front door downstairs that froze them in place. Panicked and huge eyes darted to look at each other. They heard feet coming up to them from the other side of the adult’s door, now awake. They were about to wake them anyways, but the fact that something else had, made them feel scared of being caught. Without thinking Harry had pushed Draco into the alcove that held a tall potted plant and the outline of where a picture once hanged.
“My parents died, I live with my aunt and her family...” Harry wanted to say it but stopped, sensing the hesitation Draco simply fixed him with a gaze till he continued. “I live in their cupboard; they hate me and say my parents deserved to die. Dudley and his friends like to use me as a punching bag. I don’t have anywhere to go...” a few tears leaked out by the end and he trailed off. That was his life.
“Let me in! Remus! Let me in Remus!” He banged and cried out.
He was staring into nothing, just fiddling with his hands, the reality of his situation had never been like this. There had never been a time when he was more afraid of something than his own death. Now he wasn’t even being given the time to really think about what had become of them, there was more important things to attend to.
“Anything for you love.” He answered by sweeping the tips of his fingers along Albus’ lips and jaw with an impish grin of his own, knowing just how it muddled Albus in the lab when he distracted him so.
“May I ask why you had him come back Mother?” He tried as best he could to sound neutral.
“I don’t know if she’s going to move it now.” He fought to keep talking over Remus’ attempts at soothing him.
“The first thing you should know is that his mind has been altered.” Tom’s frown tensed as he listened. “It took me some time to find the origin point and it appears to coincide with his infatuation with Narcissa Malfoy during their school years. I believe he has consumed some deviation of a love potion that has remained undetected long enough to cause some permanent damage to his brain and will leave scarring in his mind even after healing it at St. Mungo’s. The other problem is that he is missing important gaps in his memory from recent events as well as points before his mind was influenced. Some may be recovered by his subconscious if they still exist but the chances are slim.”
“What news?” Harry asked and Zabini was the one to grab a newspaper out of their things to shove in their direction.
“But Kreacher is our house elf.” Harry argued, he thought he had something over the situation. He deflated as soon as he saw Draco wasn’t deterred.
“Oil—” Draco gasped out, a hand flying to the nightstand to grab blindly for the drawer handle. Harry hummed back as he continued to devoir his lover’s lips and tongue that fought for speech.
“Harry is safe Sirius. Look at me. That’s it Dear, You’re safe with me, here with me. Stay with me Love.”
“Bet I can find more stuff than you.” Harry sang before running off to the edge of the brine that foamed where the current tide receded before sloshing back out.
“Lucky!” Harry ducked forward to pick up the treasure delicately.
It was that moment Harry realized he couldn’t move. A new fear of whatever was next to his ear out of view made him open his mouth to try and get Draco’s attention, but nothing came out. He felt the point of a wand at the vertebrae of his spine, stabbing into him.
“Gee thanks.” He crinkled his nose disapprovingly at his friend before getting to work. “So, how’s having a son going?” He asked sarcastically as he handed the sock over to Sirius before the man shapeshifted into his dog form, a common sight as he lived in it when he worked. The black snout snuffling at the article of clothing without giving a response.
“So, you met before Ron?” Hermione asked.
“There am lots o’ things like that.” He answered lamely, expecting a quick smack.
Draco furrowed his brow as he turned his resting head over in the other boy’s direction. He had that look on his face again, the one that said he had an idea and knew he would win.
He fiddled with the small vase of flowers he’d grabbed on impulse when he was told everything. The ones he remembered Lucius plucking petals off of in herbology years ago when he was still Severus’ Lucius. He’d said he liked the color, shiny pale purples and almost blues. He sat it down in the best place he could on the small table, feeling stupid for how fussy he was being, every old feeling he’d thought he’d finally mastered and stuffed away had flown right out again when Tom had rung the second time.
It wasn’t just humid anymore, it was damp, musky and now there was no mistaking that rotten bitter taste that caught at the tip of Harry’s tongue and made a nerve in his face twitch. The sound of soil being scuffed by boots and his sneakers surrounded him as they hung back at the entrance.
“Fine, you may be as unexceptional as any other muggle or mud blood, but at least you are pleasant. There are very few people that do not annoy me or try to pretend, your easy to read and pay attention when I talk.” Draco couldn’t help a blush as he glanced down at Sirius who was watching.
He had come to a rather drastic decision about his muggle that he would have to stay true to despite the conflict between his family beliefs and his loyalties. Regardless, it was both the Malfoy and Slytherin thing to do. Lucius had brought their family name out of the mud after their great-grandfather had made a show of his banner standing with Grindelwald, and Lucius’ father’s association with the death eaters that he had to continue to honor even now. The man had no preference short of putting their family first. Taking care of your own was the lesson Draco was taught at a young age. Now it was time to put that lesson into practice.
“They pray on me no matter what. Who are you?” He asked rubbing a wet trail off his cheek.
Albus discovered his work when he was forced to take drastic measures. His followers had gone on the hunt, seeking any and all soldiers that crossed their path in a desperate and rage filled attempt to stop the war one last time. Suddenly he was the blood covered monster the ministry had painted him as. He decided to commit himself to the actions he had once took so long ago in their own fights and wars. He tried to take control of the muggle himself. So many died, it was only the start. The war to end all wars began. The living joined the dead in thousands each day and Albus was not the same, Gellert was not the same.
They pasted the grounds keepers hut, puffing warm smoke from a fire out of its crooked chimney. A giant man with a kind smiled waved through his window at them as they passed. He was their teacher for magical animal care and Harry had helped him till the garden patch to grow the huge pumpkins that they had harvested for October and November’s pies before. It was reassuring that he lived so close to the forest line, like it meant that it was safer than he’d been warned. Harry was getting excited.
Harry fell with a scream of surprise that lasted too long. Hitting freezing cold water, the shock of impact sucked air from his lungs and the bubbles dancing on his body as it struggled to the surface against his clothes weight was disorienting. Gasping as he breeched the surface the pitch-black of the cave was lifted by a soft glow from the water simmering against the curved walls enough to help him see. His chin kept dipping below the water and making him sputter. The taste of clean water made him wonder if this place was connected to the lake after all.
“How much do I need?” He asked Snape as Hagrid kept Hill at bay.
A lumos cast into the air in front of them didn’t do much, the darkness stayed, the only thing keeping it from feeling like an empty void was the faint sight of cramped walls either side of them like the hallway they had come down. Somehow though, the light did nothing to brighten those walls that clung stubbornly to the dark.
__________
“No, I’m saving it! Can’t you see they can’t be trusted?”
A wobbly voice croaked forth from his pale blue lips, “I’ll—b—back as soon—n as—s I can.” He said back to the bankers that had dragged Bellatrix out for them.
“Perhaps it was! Perhaps we could let them run about when it did not affect our part of this earth, but now they have to be penned or they will overtake us. Our way of life will end, how can you be so complacent?!” Gellert accused now as he yelled back louder.
___________________________________________
Yes, yes, he was clearly ungrateful. Dudley had stayed to watch the whole thing with a smile till Aunt Petunia shooed him to school. At least he was grounded and shoved into his tiny storage space where no one could hit him. If there was one thing uncle Vernon cared about it was reputation, no ward of his was going to walk around looking abused just because he was.
“I’m here.” Harry assured him and Draco nodded.
I'm so excited to flesh out Harry and Draco now that they are finally getting time together in the story past introductions. I've wrote ahead about two chapters now and it's working out really well. Despite that I still feel like I'm short changing everything, then I look down at the word count and I'm like no, no, this is going to go on forever if I actually could make it longer than it is. My word file is 115 pages right now. I have 437 story concepts and drafts still sitting in my phone's notes I still have to get through. Some might not be good, but that doesn't mean I won't be doing stuff on this site for like the next fifty years just trying to get that done.
Harry gathers up Nagini’s front half to hug to his chest as he watched the crowd before him take their seats. On the open floor sat a set of chairs and Tom led him to them. Taking the seat in the middle Harry relaxed as Arthur came to take the spot to his left and Tom to his right, creating a wall, warm shoulders touching his. It was once they had settled and the snake he’d been diligently petting found her place that he finally found himself take a breath.
They ran through the brick pillar in the walkway between platform 9 and 10 and onto the wizards hidden part of the station. They started bounding over to their friends who had all clustered together at an entrance to the train as it poured a steady stream of white steam from its top, fogging up everyone’s vision. Hermione and for some reason Goyle had positioned themselves against the trains red side and with hands out were helping the short younger years up onto the steps safely, lifting their luggage up for them to take.
“Ah—Actually that might work unless they get penalized… We’ll have to bring that up at dinner, maybe the fam will have a counter point to that.” Arthur checked his watch and with a laugh at how long they’d let their walk get he had them floo together into the Burrow.
“You mean she was in love with… Tom?” He guessed and was given a nod by the man.
“So, it was true!” Hermione yelped and threw a hand over her mouth to stop her voice as they all looked at Harry who stayed undisturbed. “Ron told me, when he went to get you.”
Laid bare against a tree was an impossibly old corpse, mummified and chained up by countless vines that worked the poor dead stranger two thirds into the tree along with what he barely recognized as several of the things he’d just run from. They looked like… Mandrakes. Giant Mandrakes like nothing he’d ever seen.
He found the oil after rolling his hand around in the drawer and worked to undo it with one hand as he continued to rut. Draco felt the loss of both hands and the body above him lifted for a painful second. He arched his back up to keep contact until Harry was falling back down on him, forcing the blonde’s legs to spread wider and he hiked his knees up to hug Harry’s sides in approval.
“Are you okay Harry? You were shaking and making choking sounds in your sleep.” Draco was rubbing up and down his arms, a horrified look on his face.
“Oooh, I like that, say it again?” Harry fluttered his eyes as he broke character.
It was the start of twilight when the doorbell rang. If anything, everyone was excited at the prospect that Tom had visited and they were all at the door to open it. Instead, everyone but Harry froze at the stranger who should not have been capable of finding their home.
“Ni—gi.”
I hope I didn't reveal the dreams too soon, I feel like Harry needed a good reason to break his promise to stay out of trouble again and this was it. Having the dreams explained a little and making sure that there's no confusion about Harry not having any powers was important to clarify. With the knowledge that he can trust and fully follow the dreams now we can justify new information and leaps of logic that can help me get to the end of this fic. We have one more big fight I think.
Everyone waited for Moody to finish his ranting like he always did, some had seen it too, but it took a few seconds for Harry to rub his eyes and look back up. A small field, circled by hedge and trees they had blindly followed Sirius through. Now in front of them was a ring of people tied up with a few in particular attached to something that was decidedly not a tree like the rest of the forest.
“They emit the smell of spoiled meat to attract bugs.” His tone was serious, like he was debriefing another officer.
“I won’t lose you again. Tell me you are the one who badgered me every day back then.” Severus was begging as calmly as he could. His hand was shaking as it traced Lucius’ face.
It was the night of his worst dream that he woke to find Albus holding him tightly in their bed. He had been screaming, the gas had choked his lungs, the fire burning flesh, metal piercing through his shattering bones and bleeding body. It was hell made real like nothing before, even compared to the dreams proceeding the first world war where he’d been so many men with their limbs sawed off with nothing to stop the pain.
“The master has arranged for,” Kreacher seemed at a loss for words as he gestured to the items.
“Thank you.” Harry slurred up to her where he lay prone.
“No offense taken.” Draco barbed back just as lackluster. “He was the only person I’ve ever known that didn’t fight back. I didn’t know what else to do. I still don’t. What I have to be for him contradicts everything I’m supposed to be. Honestly, my father had more than a few choice words for what happened at Gringotts.”
“Roody has suppressors in place for certain memories and pain from back with. Bellatrix and all that. Mother did something to it and influenced him when his mind—you know. That’s what Tom said. He’s going up to the Nurse too. Sirius is fine because you have Roody’s wand.” Draco smiled. “Wizards are bloody useless without their wands you know.”
“One more time Draco, are you ready? I’m going to show you how much I love you.” He said, resting his forehead against Draco’s neck. Only looking up once he heard a gentle voice.
“To pet dogs? If his goal was to deter me from trouble Snape did not think this through.”
The nervous feeling in everyone’s heart or throat settled. Not calmed, but settled, like when you left a spider in the house and then lost where it went. It wasn’t in your way, no trouble, but as much as you wished it wasn’t there and hoped it wasn’t; you never got over the thought that it was still right there and all too close. You could tell everyone felt it, from the sweat of one man’s brow to another’s paranoid scratching as they searched. The only warning anyone would get if something was amiss would surely be if the ceiling overhead started to crash down on them suddenly.
What do all of you want to see out of this story anyways? What were your expectations when you started reading? I can't remember exactly what I wanted, I just kind of watered the seed and let it grow out of control, you know?
The day went on like that, Draco had gotten a similar necklace and had brought their sea glass down from the room so Remus could help add them. The difference was he was given bracelets with focus stones to held him cast spells faster with more power. It was clear the amount of worry and love had gone into the gifts they were given. Harry was already determined to never take them off for anything, he promised to them in his head as he ducked his nose below his sweater collar and hugged himself tight in the soft material.
“I got it.” He said a little louder.
“Say, do you think maybe it’s everyone else that needs to change, since we have already?” Harry mumbles to himself.
The wisp does its job and good things happen.
He couldn’t hear the Minister’s gavel as it pounded the desk before him, or see the Dursley’s as they were escorted in to testify along with the memories that the counsel would review as a first hand source. The sensitivity of the minor in question taken into account as he was kept from the immediate trauma of facing his abusers directly. That did not mean there would be no unpleasant experiences today.
“Oh, you didn’t have to.” She fussed in embarrassment, running her thumb along the cup handle.
So, he sat on the swing in the park crying and bruised as was custom recently thinking how the moment of true peace was worth the slap in the morning from his uncle and accusation by his Aunt Petunia who would liken him to his mother for staying out. He wondered in that moment as he thought of his dead parents if maybe he should have died too back then and if that’s where all this was going anyways why he shouldn’t spare himself more pain by letting go of life early.
“Yes, please. I’ll give it to you to give to her before we leave. Thank you.” Draco’s voice scrapped at his throat from where it had been agitated from crying, the sensation a tickle below his Adams apple that sung to him when he swallowed.
“I have reviewed the aforementioned documents and swear under perjury that all I say is the truth. The Black family head and his spouse have requested guardianship of Harry Potter and have registered all pertinent information that prove they are suitable. I have audited this and do here by agree they are an appropriate candidate for adoption.” Tom said as he took out the file and began to outline all points of the documents for the record.
“Ron.”
“Thank you so much Zanna. I’ll return him as soon as I’m done.” He watched it already start to tug lightly in the direction of the door.
“You didn’t tell me where to go!” Harry yelled back exasperated.
“Friends… I suppose.”
“Like I said, don’t worry. We can do baby steps you big baby.” He teased and Draco pushed against Harry’s side in protest. “Just, look I know you didn’t want to go home before school started; if something happens, even if you feel like you can handle it, just skip out and come hide with us till it’s time to end break okay?”
The villa on its own was like most places an Auror walked into, unassuming, because what would one expect? For the floorboards to ooze, fiery lakes of lava surrounding the fence line, no, the worst evils were often hidden. Lying in wait for the right pray to wander too close before realizing their mistake. It was in that spirit that the Death Eaters had circled them before pulling free the cloaks and illusions that had concealed them after Tom had been welcomed in.

Draco whispered to himself as he brandished his wand. The wisps of magic coiling around the wood like a spool as he readied his spell. He had to assume this wouldn’t be all she needed and he pointed his toes to the cover of a metal safe that had been wheeled out onto the floor and left there.
“Shouldn’t be long, I’ll be alerted as soon as their here. I assume we’re going to need them for more than just Narcissa.” Tom spoke grimly.
“Who do you think denied my petition—The man never lets my initiatives pass the damnable snake.”
“Pfft, that’s what, two months from now? Two and a half? The lovey Gryffindors really got to you, huh.” Draco smirked.
“The dealings of Fae, Otherkin, Death and Demons.” Harry smirked triumphantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sirius is helping isn’t he, what leads do you have still?”
“They have told me to take Harry Potter back into custody. I should apologize in advance that I may have implied that I had no means to reach him.”
“Hello Kreacher, I would love to have you help. Would you like to come see me off with Sirius?” He asked gently.
“I’m going to assume a lot. I only ever saw this one flower in the whole room, it’s probably really important to the mandrakes if it’s the only one that can do this for them.”
Before he could reply the door slid open and a wavy-haired girl already dressed in school uniform came in. She took the seat next to Ron without a second thought. Once in place she nodded towards Harry who just raised his brows in question.
“We’ll have to call Tom over, seems he and Albus have been a theme in this turn of events. It would be best to keep them in the loop.” Remus stood and walked off to make the call.
(See the end of the chapter for
Too soon it seemed, the time for the hearing were here. Arthur had seen his face after informing him and with a hug had said he’d be staying until they were over. “And don’t forget you are very welcome to come over any time. I have many son’s my boy, but none of them I have had the courtesy of meeting as a man before a son like I have you.”
Four long tables stretch the length of the room and seated the full number of students in the school, they were all color-coded with banners and small trimmings along the student’s uniforms. Along the opposite wall to the entrance they lined up at was a raised table full of older people he assumed were the teachers. A stand had been placed in the middle up those few raised steps to allow an old bearded man a stage to speak from.
They had been going down the list just waiting to finally catch up to her and a little part of Tom, perhaps vindictively, wanted to really…really maim this woman. She had hurt the closest thing to a son he had ever had and probably would ever care to have and he hadn’t even known the extent until their Lucius incident recently. Now he was at least as angry as he had been at Bellatrix all those years ago when he had thought he had lost Albus. She was trying to make it all happen all over again, once had been enough.
Silence filled the space between them for a long agonizing moment. “Do whatever you want, I don’t rightly care.” Severus grouched.
“No! I made him stay here.” Draco pulled away to look up at his Uncle.
He ran up to his room and grabbed his backpack, everything still inside and sighed in relief as he took stock of exactly what he had.
“Then what is going on with you huh?” Harry crouched down below the vines of moon drops to reach Draco.
She turned away to walked over to the lounger and Draco let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding. He had thought for a few times there he might have no choice, but to stun his own Mother. The confrontation was so surprising he just knew it would take quite some time to find the energy to cry over this development. Things had been looking so much better for them, or so he thought, since he’d been in the papers helping to catch Bellatrix. In retrospect it was incredibly lucky that his mother’s love for Bellatrix did not outweigh the sense that he was her son and was also loved or he wasn’t sure now just how she would react to seeing him.
“Fuck.”
Hitting down on the back alley that lined the back of the street’s housing he turned himself to the road that led to the bus stop. With no floo available he’d just have to get there on foot. He had the pass he’d gotten when he was with the Weasley’s and waited for the late-night pickup at the corner. There weren’t a lot of options for him, places he could get to fast this way. Luckily Muggle Britain was small and full of historical sights he could use to direct him to the magical territories they pointed to. His first stop, hoping it would house the creatures he sought, was Surrey Hills. A landmark, a veil, to the other world he now called home as much as Grimmauld Place that sat snuggly on the fence line.
“But he’s so old. If he was going to come back, he would have done it years ago right? Don’t you think it’s time you thought of following his lead for a change. Seems like that was the lesson.”
The final vote and Harry's new life are about to begin. That includes the consequences...
“I’ve been mapping out the next row of elements we had listed but I’m having trouble sorting them into a graph that makes any sense. Gellert, would you mind getting me another sample of the ammonia.”
“Peekaboo!” Bellatrix jumped out in front of him with her wand poised. It was slow motion in his blurry vision. Squinting at her did nothing to clear the image and he just had to hope he was fast enough as he essentially quickdrew one of the twin’s party poppers in turn.
“They’ll give us hell about how he’s muggle and it’s not their jurisdiction, how Lupin’s a werewolf, how you don’t meet ‘certain conditions’ like you’d expect and probably a few other weak excuses, but this could work. And for this boy, Harry Potter, it has to.” It was decided.
The day went pretty great, ending in the pub where apparently being close to seventeen was deemed good enough and the Slytherin’s cheered in pure joy. The man grouched about how one of the teachers, probably Remus, had asked him to in order to choral them safely.
Tom watched as Albus aged before his eyes. His hair losing color and skin seeming to die into a weak and thin layer with thick cords of veins peeking through. Bellatrix had taken Albus’ youth, and by her deluded thinking removed Tom’s reasons for wanting the other man. When it wasn’t enough—
“Of course, thank you for coming.”
“He was attacked. I lifted the curse but you should check him over.” Tom said from his other side.
“You’re Zanna correct?” He asked as he sat down in the velveteen chair.
“Not anywhere you’d see, just pushing. Let’s not talk about him.” Harry fidgeted and blushed as he thought of one of the things that had got him through the week. “What did you do before you came to talk to me before?”
“You couldn’t wait for me?” Tom huffed in exasperation, Nagini slithering past his feet to make her way to Harry in concern.
“Maybe you wouldn’t have to.” Remus thought of Draco, he would most certainly be willing to help in this matter.
A fight had broken out from there with the young girl screaming and crying, the final jab in his heart was when she’d said, “The only reason you don’t want to is because your stupid muggle blood is fogging your head! If you were a real wizard, you’d want me!”
“They are founding principles of the pureblood houses. Ours, Crabbe and Goyles respectively. It means history and legacy. Those before us made all this and we are meant now to maintain it. I was only maintaining our family with my actions father. You may not be able to openly support squids and other liberal movements in order to retain your supporters, but now it is public knowledge that a Malfoy helped to resolve a terrorist cell and protect innocent victims.”
Remus stood over the two of them and rested his hands over their heads gently. “I suppose we’ll just have to teach you self-defense so you never get hurt like this again without us.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dumbledore moved from the perch he had to take out a simple wooded stool and someone brought out an old brown witch hat, pointed at the top just barely after what looked like years of use. “This is the sorting hat; it is a very special enchanted garment from the times of founding Hogwarts. It may seem like any other hat, but isn’t that the point? You may look like any ordinary child, but each of you has a sparkling soul inside. You will be given a dorm and a group of other students with like minds to grow with, to compete or relay on. Just remember that these houses are meant as a tool to help you find yourself, not divide you from others of difference. I was once a Gryffindor and I will say openly to anyone who asks that I have and will always love a certain Slytherin I was blessed to know for almost all my adult life. It helps to guide you to those with talents you may be lacking in and I still learn new things everyday being with my partner.” The older man was speaking dreamily and it was clear he was floating off to his own world from all the reminiscing, a man in a dark robe that covered almost all his skin, face obscured by loose hanging black hair, took hold of him and lead the headmaster back to his seat.
“Don’t forget to letter Sirius about this as well. I’m sure he would want to be in the loop.” He smiled pleasantly as he sipped the tea he’d made for them. “I’ll see you in class, don’t worry about making time this week since you’ll be very extra busy. Severus has to stock up on burning wheat hoppers and other ingredients from the turn of the season since it’s started to frost so much today. He could certainly use the help.”
He was heavily downplaying the almost death and he felt a little bad for that, but they had finally lapsed from yelling to looking at him with plain horror or doom. It wasn’t better, but it wasn’t yelling and Harry wasn’t fond of yelling. He could admit the thought that Zanna had manipulated him into everything he did was a troubling notion. It went to show just how cut off from each other the world of wizards was from other kinds of magical people.
Shoes hit the sand and sunk in an inch before they began to wade through the soft dry dunes till, they reached the flat wet sand still dark and shiny from high tide. The slap of feet hitting the hardened surface reminded Harry of fresh cement. Looking down he watched his weight push the absorbed sea water up to cup the soles of his shoes.
with no spirit before. The Weasels always gave a fun fight, but this...
“I can tell you have something else to say.” She rested her head on her hands, elbows digging into her knees.
This would not be the last time…
“So why don’t you just leave?” Harry furrowed his brows at the stories end.
I would like to give a proper spotlight to this and I'm not sure how well I'll do, at the same time this is a key feature of Harry in this story and it needs to grow more and the only way to do that is by having him interact with these groups and have them developed. The gap between human and magical beings must be questioned, and the symbolism of a muggle being the one to extend a hand and how that allows the reader to project onto him is something I'm suddenly really excited to think about. I'd been wondering how to start the 16th chapter up to this moment and typing this out is actually helping to give me new motivation.
“Don’t be.”
Harry wanted to keep fighting over this, there was no way he was leaving Draco alone, but if he had someone with him even if it wasn’t him specifically it was the least he could ask for. He wasn’t happy about it, and his tightly sealed lips indicated as much. Draco took it for what it was, an admittance of defeat and as much permission as Harry was willing to give on the matter. He left as swiftly as he could before either of them broke in conviction.
“Fair enough, but I think I might just treat these ones closest, while we all work at it, they deserve it.” Harry ducked his chin between rising shoulders, a sheepish look playing along his features as Roody slapped him on the back.
“The vultures are probably trying to decide how to pick out my eyes.” Draco argued nervously.
Before long, the castle was in the distance, a backdrop to the open wood platform where the train stopped. Trees lining a dirt road to their destination. The abrupt halt, dislodged and woke Harry from his peaceful slumber. The school year was about to begin.
“Sounds like a good shot then.” Draco got up to leave, he looked down on Nagini and shook his head before going for the door. As he heard Harry getting up to follow, he turned around to push him right back into the bed. “You stay.”
“Why won’t you just die?” She yelled and threw an unforgivable somewhere beyond his sight. Draco rushed forward to see what she was aiming at, dreading the answer.
“That’s a wind spirit Harry! It flipped over to that and you just thought it was destiny? That thing led you to it!” Draco yelled, with him being on him the close proximity did not make that pleasant.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So you’ve said, yes.”
“Dobby, he’s a good one even when he’s scatterbrained he only ever does his best.”
“ha…” Harry looked over at the entirely unhappy occupant of the desk who he’d accidently disturbed. “Thank you Griphook.” He smiled broadly at the deep frown that looked back at his.
“Does this make you my second or first friend ever?” Harry’s smile grew.
“Draco, just ask to use some treats.” Harry laughed as Draco chased after an excited looking fearie dog.
“Magic mirror, don’t look in them.” He said weakly as he herded Harry away from them. His pain mixing with the lingering warmth of phantom hands made his attempt at composure worthless, but Harry thankfully didn’t press it.
The day was upon them. Harry had been fussed over by Molly who had insisted on brushing his hair for an uncalculated duration of time. Now he was sitting in Arthur’s office with the Auror’s who would escort him to the court room once it was time. Jitters shook him as he clutched the gifted sweater Molly had made him—the first real piece of clothing that he owned—that fit him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Show me proof of this life debt, I’ll have my banking lawyers go over it for me.” Harry bumped Draco’s shoulder.
“Then we best get looking for Mrs. Malfoy, hadn’t we? Everyone makes such a huff, but the worst that can happen thanks to knowing more than we arguably should is we postpone opening the school for a bit longer.”
The muggle audibly gulped as he shifted the next finger in and began to scissor the entrance open, watching it snap back into place when he pulled out to add a third.
They raised eyebrows at that. “Someone’s been breaking curfew.” Lupin crosses his arms. Right, teacher.
“Fuck off, we all want to know what the bloody hell is going on. We all thought that article was fake as hell or meant to get your family in a good position, no one thought that—”
The family is all gathered and it's time for a calm before the storm.
Without needing to wait for more questions Harry shuffled his sleeves up to reveal sets of bracelets with their own symbolic leather knotwork and protective stones. They had done their job just like Sirius and Remus had hoped they would. His Christmas presents hidden along whatever limb they needed to be on under his clothes. He had been lucky the Mandrakes didn’t seem to mind certain protective and concealment charms or he may have forced to remove them.
“What?”
Soon enough a snake head slunk forward into his view on the floor along with a pair of smartly shined black dress shoes.
“I’m going to though, sorry about the noise.”
It was a few days into Solstice, Christmas Eve looming, that he was greeted by Tom and Nagini. He invited them to come to Hogwarts to spend an evening with Albus and see what they helped accomplish before the other students came back after break. This had the four flooed into the head master’s office where a small dining table had been set up for their arrival.
It was when he entered the grandly crafted space that his eyes traveled down the long dining table for his house and caught the sight of a hunched figure, black hair hiding his features, but it was undeniably him.
By the time he could let himself relax Albus took in the sight of those coming out of the panic and those who had finally collected themselves. Harry was holding Draco tightly; they were both taking in deep breaths and the rest for their part seemed to have come out better. Tom was quiet, though that was not unusual for him when faced with negative emotions of any kind.
“No one is their parents Sirius.” Harry interjected. “Dad. God that feels strange. We are what we choose for ourselves. That is why you’re my Dad, but we will never be our parents.”
“Alright. None are specifically for finding anything as I can see, but there is some that can try. I suggest we start with what we know and go down the list if we get desperate. Some of these creatures would want to eat us alive or tear us apart as payment, a likely scenario if we don’t even really know the object we need, it gives them room to negotiate price or bring back something equally vague. Although, there are a few safe options…” Draco said as he poked the delicate illustration of a Brownie. The familiar image of big eyes and tattered clothes made Harry light up.
“You don’t think they thought of everything already?” Draco found himself asking in exasperation.
“Yes.” He answered seriously and knocked into Harry’s side. “That was the best.”
“Actually, I was just going to warn you about the ever skid wax I used on that part of the floor!” He tore for her as her unsure footing gave, tackling her to the ground. He almost got a hold of her wand before she grabbed his glasses and he had to fall back.
“Shit.” He exhaled as he realized the mandrake like creature that had him was touching skin. The oils were going to kick in soon.
“And don’t go doing anything that could get you hurt either.” She huffed.
“The damage to the walls especially is straight lines and anything held seemingly lacks markings from a duclaw. Distended as a thumb or not there should be one no matter the kind of werewolf.”
“Not good at all. And I wouldn’t trust these two.” She turned a gaze at Crabb and Goyle with a raised eyebrow.
“Stubborn bastard as always.” Severus slouched and shook his head, his black hair swishing like a curtain against his jaw. Lucius just stared at it; he was crying again.
“Come on, aren’t you mad what she wrote about you? That bitch said you were in love with a fuck’n muggle rat!”
“Hello.” He said lamely through his constricted throat. The scratchy sound making Draco look at him further down his nose.
“Thank you.” Tom’s usually dulcet tone was scratchy and rough as he lumbered in.
A full grid of sand and shells later and they had a variety of water based, weak ingredients. The earth, brine and rock components of the sand being the prime amongst the list.
“What?”
She had confessed on the off hours where she could wear a dress, it was dusky and beaded, her hair done up in pleats with her face painted and lips a bright red. She looked like a black widow spider in Tom’s memories now.
When they rejoined the rest of the group everyone was wise enough not to mention how the two looked like they had been working in a coal mine and only just managed to escape their indentured servitude. The mix of ash, dust and soot covered both of them enough to tell anyone that looked that they had been up to something.
“You really don’t have to.” He told him down the hall.
“Moody? Worried? Why I never. Next thing you know he’ll start tolerating us and you know what happens then.” Draco whispered back conspiratorially, both fully aware of Moody’s perfect hearing.
“Draco?” Harry called out and choked when he didn’t hear anything, it was like every sense he had was cut and jammed away in a box he flailed around to find with no success.
“Sounds like a trip to the glass blower at Nocturn’s entrance.” Draco mused.
“It’s quite alright, if nothing else you may have tired her out some.”
Hufflepuff's secret garden
“That is the weakest—Hey—I’m sorry.” Harry was a little disoriented when the body next to him moved away, not for long though.
“It not up to date yet, we have to do some cleaning but we did do up your room already just in case—you know.” Sirius fumbled as Harry looked around.
In the hall Tom quickly cast a privacy shroud over them as most did in their line of work, just one more crowding the hallway in their little bubble. Evette was straightening her back, finally able to catch her breath and looking sternly forward at him with her report lining itself up in her mind.
“Everyone, maintain position and push back!” Tom Yelled over the din of other noises as he directed the group to move through the opposition, a large round barrier held together by every Auror and teacher present looked like a big raindrop racing along the ground. Looking up Harry watched the giant fists of stone slide off them, the light blue film of protection between him and being crushed was unlikable at best and he reminded himself of what it would have been like if he’d tried to do this alone like every other time before.
“Not that you ever did.” Harry teased through a forced smile. “Draco… I kind of love you.” Harry curled in on himself after letting it out, trying to hide from the irreversible decision.
We are about to have a proper look at the second ship of this fic and I hope you like it.
Another strike hits his back and Harry was dragging himself bodily away as he choked on the new wave of pain. What spell was that? He didn’t know, couldn’t think.
“Now that just won’t do.” She tsked to herself.
“I’m going to tell Tom on you!” Harry put on a deliberately childish voice.
“I’m sorry Mother, I won’t get hurt again.” He said seriously as he rubbed his temple. He didn’t expect the frown that dug itself out of her porcelain face the next moment.
Nagini had been his companion since he left the orphanage and was taken to Hogwarts, in moments like these when he was reminded of what scared him, she was always there to keep him out of his own head. Maybe he should have given himself some actual time to calm down rather than taking care of everyone else. Though when nothing seemed to happen, he slowly relaxed, his heart that had been beating painfully loud in his ears simmered down to a throb.
Not long after he was left behind the short crowd of children swarmed in around him till, he was overrun up to the waist in first years. The chattering and discord only small children are capable of on field trips began.
His eyes were still a dangerous shade of yellow where there should be white, the same for his nails. A deep pain came with each contraction of his lungs as they refused to work. A stabbing pain in his kidney, appendix, liver, and every other organ permeated and could only be described as organ failure. His heart wanted to stop and for clutch seconds before the Brink elixir it had, now though it felt like it wanted to bust apart. His abdominal muscles spasmed and he was visibly shaking.
A new problem comes to disrupt the Black home's peace.
“I’m not going to say he’s fine now; it will take a number of years if not the rest of his life to recover from the mental abuse he endured. He may never be ready to be given full custody of you again nor do I expect him to pursue it. Don’t assume that is abandonment from him, he is uncertain and may not ever trust himself with your care again and that is just one of his reasons. He understands his affliction is no excuse for the pain you’ve endured at his hand. You have also been through abuse and loss; your own feelings are just as important. You are still allowed to be angry with him, to resent him or anything else you may have bargained with yourself to put aside. He intends to work through it with us. He’d tell you the same if you ask him.” Severus had answered every question with conviction and without false niceties, it was that way of talking that always eased Draco’s mind.
“That would be counterproductive, but I see your point. Any other requests while I’m out?” He teased. When she was having a proper conversation, Harry had to admit he didn’t exactly dislike her, which was kind of nice. This had actually helped him through his panic attack.
“This’ll do the job. Nothing like a wisp to guide a folk where they need. Can’t promise it’ll take you to the place you want, but just keep letting it lead the way and you might get lucky.” She jeered proudly. “My favorite little helpers I might add.”
The man at the desk straightened, his long fingers moving to cradle the Owl to its perch before opening his new work. He hummed as the information he read reminded him of darker times. The sound calling forth his familiar.
“Yes Maim.”
“I want you.” He peered down into gray eyes.
“Well I hope you have better aim elsewhere.” Draco huffed in a mocking tone that made Harry smile again as he watched Draco lay back and pull his legs up.
The cane. The single hits that reminded you for days after with a bruise every time you sat or slept that you’d done something wrong. It was just tradition. His father was traditional. It wasn’t a problem. Ever since that mirror he’d just been a bit shaken up is all. He ran slender fingers along his wand hand absently where he could recall the sting burning his entire back hand. It had never occurred to him just how much he’d been hurt in his life; it had been so easy to forget them.
“Yes, I suppose I do. To have someone understand once more…” He said in a sad wobble, but as well timed as it was in his voice it sounded utterly genuine. Unease in Harry’s gut stayed.
The other boy sat stock still and Draco huffed in frustration as he had to throw an arm over his shoulder. He was doing it again; he was ruining himself in front of everyone for this stupid muggle who needed him. His words weren’t going to mean much to cover up his new allegiance if he had to literally go back on them the same day in front of the same people he bluffed to. Dammit, how was he supposed to be clever and plot things like this? Honestly it was like Harry just over road any other concerns. He’d just have to take the beating eventually, but he’d hoped to avoid it at least for a while.
The next room left everyone apprehensive. Hufflepuff or Slytherin, they wouldn’t know which trial it was till they were in the middle of it. Tom had insisted on going in first to be sure, Pomona Sprout the head of Hufflepuff pushing her way to the front of the group to get ready if he needed her. The only way through, the only way to find out way to set of whatever trap laid before them.
“Thank you so much. Say thank you Hedwig.” Harry tickled the owl into hooting along with him to Kreacher. The older man would later look back on this memory and describe it as surreal when he would write to Remus.
“well, he did save me from a bad person like the paper said. This is my cousin Draco. He helped me get adopted.”
“Wait!” Draco rushed to stop him even as he thrust up into Harry’s grip. “Not yet.”
“For you to set the Dursley’s house on fire?” Harry quirked a brow.
Harry had frantically pressed his lips closed and began signaling to Nagini as she sniffed him out happily. She blinked up at him in amusement as her little hatchling tried to tell her to stay quiet. Silly thing, she knew Tom would not stop him from listening in, he had always adored such chaos. Though it was true he had started to rethink his methods after learning how Harry had run off alone after what Tom had told them last time. After pondering this she gave an imperceptible nod and was rewarded a smile for her effort. She would just have to tell Tom later then.
It was like a fog lifted the moment the man was out of his sights; Lucius seemed to straighten and compose back into his former self and turned back to the street in mild discomfort. A new rush of need to check on Narcissa outweighed any other thoughts at the moment.

“It’s the middle of the night though.”
“He is the key…”
Harry sat at the swing next week as the Stars came out, the Dursley’s blissfully unaware. He looked out to where he hoped, no he knew, Draco would come from, and then he did.
“Can I try?” The muggle’s hands seemed to take control of Draco’s body to push his lower back in to make Draco bare his neck as a result.
They were rushing for the boundaries of the Alley’s wards to apperate away. Tom had to act fast and he ran after them full tilt. The first he was after was too fast, gone the second his foot stepped over the boundary line.
“Unfortunately, it does. More unfortunately I might know what she could use it for.” Tom swept his gaze over all of them. “I assume you’ve all heard a little something about a local Hogwarts legend, the Cornerstone.”
“Welcome to the misfits club kiddo. Feel good?”
Albus for his part was already high as a kite with the amount of hallucinogenic oil the mandrake roots had rubbed into his wrists and along his midsection where his button up had been snagged and pulled open. The rest of the others that had come running were all circled around the giant plant and tied along their own trees respectively.
“What was that you just said young man?” Albus whipped around from where Harry was muttering with Draco.
“Why?”
“On it.” Sirius patted the two boy’s heads before running forward, his body doubling over into a familiar fluffy Animagus form. He sniffed at the ground as he ran, the front half of teachers and Aurors sprinting after him into the dark. The people left closed in around themselves and a thought occurred.
“What is it master?” a hiss called from below as a giant snake began to coil up his leg.
“Good night Harry Potter.” He smirked.
“Harlech Castle! Now! Now!”
I thought it might be worth putting it somewhere easy for people to read. Thank you for taking the time to get this far in my writing, I try not to think about the reality of people reading my stuff as much as I try to let it encourage me to keep going. Thank you thank you thank you!!!!

“I don’t hear you getting ready.” Ron yelled through the door. It was the only thing that helped bring Harry back to life. The promise he wasn’t alone. That help was just a thin door away. That people would come looking for him if he didn’t keep functioning.
“Why? Did something happen to Roody I should know about?” He furrowed his eyebrows.
“—Oh, just that, if there had been portraits, they wouldn’t have seen the construction like you didn’t. I was—” Harry stuttered.
The entrance banged open, the metal of the doorknocker hitting the frame startling the blonde man. It was a strangely foreign sensations in Lucius only growing at the death glare that stared back at him.
The way there was easy enough, it was when he had to diverge that he felt truly unsure. The wooden stairs up the steeper area was solid and he could see the structure in the distance, a black outline of the gothic tower, Prospect House. It was marked as the compass he needed to use to find his gateway. Both Nagini and him spun to circle around the tower, leaving it in their periphery as he looked for the next indicator.
“You said you’d do anything I asked.” He pouted before losing his composure and doubling over. “I can’t do it!”
“I have to say I’m relieved,” Arthur remarked as he patted Tom’s shoulder. “It’s a good job we have people like you, old man.” He teased.
“That’s okay Dobby, shhh don’t be sad, you’re okay. Stiff upper lip for me. Do you know where Lacy takes the boxes?”
“Draco.” Harry’s smile was wide and open like nothing Draco had ever seen. He had no way of knowing he’d just made a wish come true.
“Think we could both fit on the way back?” He finally asked up to the blonde.
“Where is she? Or should I just follow the—” Another string of insults wafted down the hall and Harry snorted as he went to where it was coming from.
“Nagini why didn’t yo—” Tom started looking around his feet and sighed loudly. “Bloody babysitter, I’ve taught her bad habits.”
“This is Hermione, she’s my housemate and um…” His cheeks painted themselves a soft pink as he fumbled over introducing the two. Hermione’s eyes crinkled in amusement at his attempt before thrusting a hand out in Harry’s direction.
“I thought it would help to lighten things up after the story since it really did have to be resolved with you two before my well-meaning students rushed out and got killed.” Albus winked. “So, the mission my dear boy if you will, is to eat our meal backwards I think.”
“Don’t bother blaming yourself over something that I’m not mad at. You didn’t do anything wrong because you didn’t mean to. Now can we actually enjoy picking literal ghost fruit or do I have to start beating you up?” Harry let his knees hit the soggy mossed ground to reach over and pull Draco into a hug as he nodded.
“If you let me stay,” Harry looked around frantically for an excuse. He caught himself on instinct looking at what he hoped would work. “I’ll clean the whole reception area? —Before and after!” He said loudly enough that a few other Goblins turned to watch the show.

“Young M-Master Malfoy, what can D-Dobby do for the master?” The elf choked out, overexcited.
“Well this isn’t good at all is it? How about the clothes, looks a bit off.” He started softly.
“You don’t think this is a bad idea?” Ron looked at her unsure.
Draco couldn’t stay hidden at Grimmauld place forever till school started term. He had gone back reluctantly a few days ago when a house elf in a doily dress had popped in to retrieve him for his mother. Harry had smiled at his higher than thou attitude and hugged him tight, Draco’s hands at his shoulder blades were warm and reassuring.
The newspaper that morning had been a clear disaster, stating belief over fact as always, but with the clear backing of actual accounts taken by none other than Rita Skeeter. No one knew how that women got what she knew, but it was always something secret or meant to be held from press for a reason. She made almost all the stories she covered risk the careers or even lives of the people she wrote about, that energy was why she was the most infamous and well-known writer in any platform in the British magical community. This time it was about him and Harry, a thought he’d been trying to keep out of his mind till now.
No one stayed on the grounds unguarded as they searched in teams. Teachers were already back if they had even left at all. Students that had stayed for holiday were escorted out and held at host homes or friends for the immediate future. Hagrid searched the forest as best he could and Filch grumbly as ever followed his cat wherever her nose led her. Despite all the portraits and house elfs looking about as extra eyes no one saw hide nor tail of the rouge Malfoy.
Draco was freaking out. He couldn’t stop looking at all the potential dangers and imagining more that could hurt the other boy since his talk with Severus. He was feeling skittish at the possibility that Harry would be injured because he wasn’t good enough, fast enough, know better. He’d messed up so bad and the other boy didn’t even know. He had to take care of him, he hadn’t managed anything noteworthy when the muggle had faced Bellatrix and he needed to be good enough to protect him from what came now. He thought of Remus, the defense against the dark arts classes he taught. He thought of Moddy and his dueling classes. Whatever they ran into he had to be the one to handle it. It didn’t matter if Harry could take care of himself, he was supposed to keep him safe so he wouldn’t have to take care of himself.
“What? What is that?” Draco asked weakly.
“What about at least?” Harry asked, a bit unsure at his try at humor. A pause between reply had him readying an apology for ruining the conversation again.
“It’s Christmas, get up lazy snake.” His muggle said cheerfully from where he’d thrown his head back through the door frame before disappearing out of sight again.
Albus was flush with a new look of anticipation as he didn’t let up, not simply letting himself be outdone as he was twisted into place. He was tiring by the time he found himself hogtied by something he wasn’t sure was physical or magical.
Still, his mind stuck and began skipping like a record on what he could see. Replaying the dream over and over, little bits flipping around as he tried to get it right. It was there, right past Draco. He had walked up to the door where the screaming was coming from. Harry had been so focused on the voice behind him, the pain, but there had been something in front of Draco. A door. A slightly opened door. There was something there…
“He helped me pick the kind of glue we’re gonna use.”
They made their way to the train platform; Harry had been frazzled by the hidden area. Sirius had delighted in coming up behind him and placing his hands over Harry’s on the luggage cart before making them run full tilt at the brick column. He laughed as Harry squealed in surprise.
“I was taught a lot of things based on tradition and status that served mostly as a hindrance. My life’s problems were a different matter and I had only ever focused on what would affect my family negatively, not what my family’s affect on others were. Despite those things, being told you can never be wrong and looking at a crying girl you’ve hurt with your own magic should have been my first clue that not everything you’re taught is correct. I was wrong, and I’m sorry. I don’t expect you to forgive me in any way as I would not if the roles were reversed. However, if anyone asks or you try to repeat my words, I will utterly deny that this happened.” Draco crossed his arms and turned his head to stare out the window to signal he was done.
“I’m afraid I’m here for more urgent matters. Have the potions been helping, the little one said you’ve been remembering things better now. I was beginning to worry that the condition would get worse. Less wondering?” he cupped the wrinkled face before him.
Draco shook his head as he stared down at his lap.
Draco had never felt more awkward in his life. He didn’t do anything worth thanking, it was a rare kind of thing. He shuffled his foot. It was getting late anyway.
“Yes, what about you?” Draco plastered on his best drowned cat impression, teeth glinting like he was ready to bite; where the other two stopped and assessed the threat Harry just burst out laughing. He started to punch at Draco’s arm repeatedly till Draco’s façade broke in favor of defending himself. “Hey, this is abuse! You all saw!”

“The jury will convene for their vote and I will call final vote in the courtroom momentarily.” The minister stated as men and women stood to file out into an adjacent room.
The rest of their time was spent retaliating against the twin’s pranks and Harry following along with Ron like a duckling as he learned. It was easier to take all the change with someone to buffer it all and remind you that you’re not in trouble, that you have permission, even if it was for the most basic things. Ron had never felt so wanted or needed.
He was convinced that someone had to be Dolores. Only so many suspects existed and they had to have been at the hearing to know about anything that had happened. She made her play; her move was to separate them and Harry taken out of Tom’s and his new parents hands posed danger to his life. Everyone was worried about the wrong monster here.
“And you were speaking so properly just a moment ago, calling me love. Are you trying to earn a punishment so soon?”
“Ready to go if you are?” Pansy looked between them both uncaring.
“On the case of prejudice, I would like to remind the court to not make harsh decisions based of stigma. This will be an ongoing case for me and we will have monthly reports on this minor’s wellbeing and access to basic needs. Do not deprive this boy the chance at a family on the idea that it is not the right one without giving him the opportunity.”
Every hit or injury Draco had ever had was visible, painted over him like they had never gone away. Clothes gone he threw a hand up to clutch at his shirt where a deep bruise covered his chest reds and purple. The others behind him just as morbidly hurt. The mirror showed the pain they had endured physically and he couldn’t be sure it didn’t do more. It was horrible to witness the naked forms of himself and his companions in such a state but he couldn’t look away from the side view he had of Harry, the litany of slashing red stripes across almost every inch, cuts and even a bone shard sticking out of his arm as it rested at his side casually.
“Butter Beer actually, low alcohol content version, just to keep the taste. Apparently, they are considering a version kids can drink to trick us, the bastards.” Draco looked over at Crabbe and Goyle trying to outdrink the other. “Probably the best idea they’ve ever had honestly. Just don’t tell them that.”
__________
“We’ve met.” Draco nodded as he sat down.
Strange. Abnormal. That’s what they’ll call you. He thought to himself, a fear that this secret could be sniffed out ran up his spine with a gust of wind.
Ron had the cusp of a spell about his wand before he was intercepted from his usual routine of throwing the tough invaders over their old fence. He stalled as the Jumpy boy he’d hauled along for chores stared him down.
Her voice traveling down to where a small scuffle of the argument cut short to travel towards them. Sirius stomping into view as a smaller hairless being followed, a deep frown and bare thread cloth all that adorned him. He stopped and seemed to force calm into himself when he saw Harry, a tick of worry that he might scare him.
“That won’t happen, but I’ll remember.”
“Bellatrix would be angry if she gave it back even if it was to save her. Draco said…” Harry looked over to Draco who gave him silent permission. “He said she was acting different when she talked about Bellatrix, like she would do anything for her and not in the selfless way. If that makes any sense.”
“Whatever you’re on about you better say it faster.” Draco shook his shoulder.
Harry gasped in horror, “I said don’t tell me.”

“Was this when you and my sister—?” He gestured vaguely. Harry nodded silently. “When—wait so, you, when you, ha! What did she say to that exactly?”
She answered with a shout down the hall that made him jump. “I called for him.”
“You sound like there’s anything new to know about it. Magics been around for forever, longer than science. Fact, curtesy of dad, the development of muggle technology and science was spearheaded by alchemists. In other words, wizards. If there was more to it don’t you think we’d have seen something change by now. The fact no one’s seen an advanced Nome society should prove that.” Ron shrugged. Somewhere along the line his indifference or rather uninterest had faded as they discussed the possibility. Hermione would have been proud he was just paying attention.
“Slytherin had good reasons though.” Goyle spoke through a mouthful of pasta.
After all that work, Hogsmeade was a beacon light for some well-earned off time. The Slytherins had protested the two’s plan to separate once they got free of the wards. Hermione just grabbed Ron and wished them luck.
He watched the blue swirl of essence inside the bottle as it danced around. There was something “other” about it. Albus’ youth had been something incredible to witness separate from his body when they had recovered it, but that had been a piece of him. This felt like he was looking at his whole self, like his eyes were the things separate and looking at himself from a distance, like he’d been piloting his body from far off until now.
“You better be. I know it’s exciting to have someone who you can show all this to, who finds everything you do fascinating. Who you want the approval of more than others, but the way to do that is to be careful. He needs you to be careful. There are other things you can do, and if you want to do potions, I implore you to use one of the lab rooms next time.”
“I’m afraid I must impart some new knowledge of my own as well.” Albus’ eyes drooped in apology. “You see, the threat may be worsened by a new bill passed this week. It’s been in the works for some time because of Harry actually.” That caught everyone’s attention.
“Draco Malfoy, and you? Do you fight back?” Muggles fought with their bodies like barbarians, it explained the marks.
“This is Nagini, she loves the children we take care of. I am obligated on her behalf to ask if she may look after you and if you would be interested in holding her. I should say being climbed though really.” He tried to joke but he sounded a bit awkward for all the composure he’d shown till now.
“What?” The blonde looked like he’d been struck upside the head.
“Me neither. Go faster, I need—I need—” Draco pumped his fist roughly and pushed the palm of his other hand onto the weeping head to grind into it. Harry suddenly bit down on his clothed shoulder to stifle a wrecked scream as he came.
“Hufflepuff was supposed to be the easy one.” He choked out between gulps of air.
“I get hand me downs from Dudley, sometimes Uncle Vernon.” Harry muttered. This was hard.
Filch ended up catching them and sending the two to Snape for detention for the equipment they had stolen for their secret project.
That night Snape stopped Draco before he left for the Slytherin dorms.
“I don’t think I can last.” Draco bit out as he coiled tighter in his core.
“Sounds like a plan partner.” Draco smiled back.
“Same thing I did tonight, took my friends out drinking.”
“That the schools in danger. That all the students are going to be there when it happens. Narcissa’s still missing with Tom’s soul. What could she do with it that could cause an explosion though?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He imagined Harry feeling everything he did as he used him from behind. He felt himself grow steadily more wet as his swollen cock throbbed and Harry egged it on as he set a brutal pace, taking what he wanted almost like he was starving for it and couldn’t stop. Like Draco had no say anymore, but to give himself and he didn’t have to think about the consequences. He could just let himself be fucked into the ground till he came.
Rita was focused on Harry as he flashed his light on different mandrakes and watched the vines that made up a part of their form shifted away. He had kicked one with no result and tossed out a small rune stone from his pocket that one of the mandrakes had reached out and taken before going back to what looked like sleep. Finally, what really surprised her was when Harry pulled out a match box and held a small flame up to one of the things, it choked out an attempt at a scream before he quickly put it out.
“Alright then.” He exhaled in a puff of self-made fog as he started to wade through the environment.
“That’s wonderful Mister Potter, many first time apperator’s throw up. Take your time.” Milton said as he guided Harry to a bench.
Shapes and shadows were cast in deep blacks against every lumos and the sudden image of a midnight jungle left the impression that anything could be hiding among the foliage ready to hunt them. Except this was magic and Harry knew whatever lashed out was most likely to be the very plants surrounding the silhouette standing out at the edge of their vision, alone, outside the safety of their circle and every step away she took from them was another he held his breath as they watched.
“She said Bellatrix would get out and live with us.” He forced out harder than he meant to and the room chilled with silence. “My Mother, she keeps a whole room for her in our house I never knew about. That’s not what makes me really scared though, it’s that she acted normal. Like everything was the way it was supposed to be and I was the wrong one. Like the fingers on her sister’s shelf made sense. Like the lady that used to hex and curse me into a bloody pulp in practice after Death Eater meetings was the most important thing in Mother’s life when she’s only ever treated me like that.” He was gulping down air, hyperventilating as he rushed to say everything he could stand to.
Harry fumbled against the pounds of muscle Nagini had tangled him in before he walked forward. All eyes stared down at him through the low flickering candlelight that edged the walls. An almost iridescent spotlight paling Harry’s skin to white as the people he looked out at were blinded from his sight to nothing more than shadow figures.
“Not to worry, I’ll see her coming a mile away even in this shit basement.” He scoffed in that gravelly voice of his.
“Yes Harry?”
The crowd was silent around him as he returned to his seat and he clung to Nagini and leaned a bit more into Arthur’s shoulder who reached out to pat his leg.
“Wisp helped me.” He scrunched up into his shoulders defensively.
“Oh, you mean your new cousin Harry. Fond of the rat, already are you? I’m surprised, for all the Malfoy’s failures I hadn’t thought one would actually shame their blood purity. I suppose I’ll been doing my sister a favor then.” The statement punctuated by a wall of knives appearing and flying at Draco.
“We were worried after the news.” Pansy said before flipping her hair out of her face, giving off an uncaring aura.
What house was this, which founder? Ravenclaw was done, so that left Gryffindor, Slytherin and Hufflepuff. Harry just couldn’t calm enough to think about it. He wasn’t okay, he didn’t want this and it wasn’t going away. A second became a minute and what felt like hours in his mind before anything changed. When it did it hurt like hell.
Harry laughed as Crabbe and Goyle kept trying to reason with him about how Slytherin was right. He just listened and then talked them through it like Draco did when they didn’t understand the new math algorithm, it was oddly pleasant. How the muggle managed to make things so easy or at least look like it was almost intimidating. Apparently that talent included turning Slytherins to his side of things. The same could be said of their magic classes, how he’d been coming up with ways to push what he could participate in. It was only a matter of time before he ran Snape down to let him duel in the new sparring dark arts course, he was helping Moody set up. The two older men had been strangely chummy about the prospect of finally getting to make a fight club of underaged children since Dumbledore signed off on it.
