a little, and then activated a repelling charm. The reporter –a short, portly man with a staunch red mustache and a bushy frown in green tartan robes, was unable to proceed into the shop. He opened his mouth in protest, but his splutter was lost; he was pulled back into the
Teddy answers before him. “Dad’s going to a single dad club, so me and grannie have a sleepover!” he states, rather satisfied. He slurps some more hot chocolate.

It doesn’t take long for the daily influx of mail starts to arrive. He files away some interdepartmental memo’s, but frowns as the little pile of non-standard sized mail starts to add up. A sense of dread fills him. He had warded his apartment against anonymous mail, including a filter for curses and spells –not a superfluous concern, it had turned out-. While the ministry held off all influx of anything truly dark, it didn’t block malintended letters; after all, complaints were necessary to the proper functioning of many a department. Draco steels himself, and reaches for the first one. He halts when he feels the prickling of magic at his fingertips, and takes out his wand. He settles down to checking each and every one of them.
, her go-to person for a department that was
“I wasn’t aware, mrs. Picklewilly.” Her eyes narrowed at him from behind her bejeweled spectacles.
Malfoy dropped his chopped onions and carrots in a large pot, and a sizzling sound immediately followed.
“Help me paint the picture here, Potter. Is it something dirty?” he smirks.
“Dare I ask?” he grinned.
“Potter! That’s Mildred!” Malfoy exclaims, but Harry is already moving towards the window to let the little owl in. Attached to her little leg is a scroll, addressed to Teddy and Harry both.
The day passed, the amount of treacle tart dwindled some more, and just before closing, the amount of reporters had as well. They would be back, Harry thought, or lie in wait elsewhere. The ministry, perhaps.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, it wouldn’t
“Fine.
And so the article went. Draco swallows audibly, and looks up at Lawrence, who is clenching his fists.
“Don’t, Draco. It’s awful”. She pleads. But he’s seen regardless; there no mistaking that those were the papers everyone was secreting away earlier at the department.
He inwardly cursed, and sat down to read, leaving Neville’s letter for later.
“Even if it did, does that still not make me a murderer? Isn’t my soul more torn than even Malfoy’s?” His voice is almost a whisper, hoarse. Lawrence looks pale, unsure. All the fight seems to have left him.
“Yes. I’m sure you need to go into
“Not aware?!” she took his arm. “Come on dear, you look a bit ill, let's go and sit down.” And without ceremony, she dragged him by the arm, into her shop, dustpan still in hand, and promptly deposited him into a floral patterned armchair next to a cramped table with a flowery teaset on. “I’ll make us a nice, strong cuppa”. And she was off, waving her wand at a kettle stuck between two porcelain vases, holding limp flowers. Harry sighed, and let himself be served tea and biscuits –not as good as Hannah’s, although not nearly as bad as the stale fruitcake Mrs. Figgs had always served him, and sipped his earl grey.
“Oh, how clever you are, dear. I suspect it does.” Harry wracks his brain.
“I know you can keep a secret, Draco. I just don’t think Harry would want me to share”.
Harry felt his jaw drop again. “What?! Am I selling you blackmail flowers?”.
“Dad?” comes a voice from the doorway. Harry’s heart sinks. Teddy had woken up from the scuffle, and he’s in the doorway, barefeet, clothes rumpled. He needs a pepper-up, badly.
And if he couldn’t really care about messes and spills and groceries, it was probably still fine, as long as Teddy was fine. That was the priority. And Teddy
“Nasty rumours are going around” she says, indignation creeping in her tone. Harry raises a bushy eyebrow. “And before you ask, they’re not about you, dear”. She interrupts his asking. Well, that’s a relief then. He breathes out. It seemed however something that affected Mrs. Picklewilly personally, if she was so unamused by such a salacious topic as was spreading like Fiendfyre. He waited, eating another little praline that she’d brought out before. It was quite the spread today, and he wondered if she’d been planning this little lunch. He was a little irritated at having another person in his life fussing with him, but he was also a little charmed. It was rather surprising that this little old lady had such seemingly genuine concern for his life, enough to do so. With a huff, he thought it was rather like Malfoy, just forcing his ‘care’ on him, without his consent really, and with strange motives, and he wasn’t able to refuse properly. Unlike with Malfoy however, he thought Mrs. Picklewilly had no ulterior motives than just stuffing him with more food and satisfying her need for company and gossip. Mrs. Picklewilly takes another sip, then almost bangs down her cup on the saucer, and it winces.
“Can you help me get him to bed?” asked Potter, looking a bit lost.
Her large brown eyes turn to the door, narrow perceptively.
“Be a dear and put them on my desk over there.” He didn’t even make it a question; full of condescencion. Before he turned to the desk, Edcombe plucked out the card, and froze.
“Hey! I thought we were having a conversation!” Harry exclaims.
? Me, the lowest of Death Eater scum, how could they not see it?” he spits at Harry derisively. Harry stands, angry, his magic flaring, cresting against Malfoy’s.
for your assistance?”.
Harry can feel Malfoy looking at him.
“Yes, it is rather creative. His appeal is to the legality of pureblood supremacy at the time of his crimes.” She adds conversationally. Harry stares at her. He doesn’t really know what to say. “And as it was a collective charge, if they want to retrial on grounds of only a part of the accusation, they’ll have to retrial the whole thing, starting with reinstating him as Lord Malfoy, the accused.” Oh
“Aunt Andromeda is coming over?” Malfoy suddenly says, in response to Teddy’s innocuous question.
been exciting, and reaffirming. He’d lived for the compliments Marcus gave him at work, making him feel validated, important. He’d made him feel like he made a difference with his work, and that that was enough. No pesky politics like Hermione tried to drag him into; just him and his wand, his gut instincts, and his partner. Nothing too complicated, but still thrilling. Marcus showed his care for Harry in making sure his Auror uniform was neat, in brushing through Harry’s hair in order to tame it a bit. He’d also taken over a lot of the paperwork, knowing Harry hated it, and joked about Harry’s chicken scrawl making it ‘illegible anyway’. Sure, Harry’d regretted that Marcus never really stayed over, but that was better for Teddy. Marcus had understood, agreeing immediately, and aside from basic toiletries and a spare change of robes, never left personal items at Harry’s, never made to move in more. It had seemed respectful at the time, but Harry still thought he would’ve liked him to protest more. To make more of an effort. He frowned in his tea. It was exactly as Marcus had said this Saturday: he hadn’t even remembered what he’d left at Harry’s, like it hadn’t mattered at all. That had stung, a lot.                       A movement behind the shop windows draws his eye, pulling him out of his depressing musings, and he sees Mrs. Picklewilly waving at him. He dregs up a smile, and she gestures that he needs to come over for his lunch break. He nods aquiescence, and she leaves, looking satisfied. After he’s helped an elderly wizard pick a lovely bouquet of peonies for his wife, he closes shop for lunch and steps into
here, just let me!”. They grinned at eachother.
“God,
his face no doubt displaying what he thought of it.
“As always, thank you, Draco”. He nodded curtly, and checked his pocketwatch –a silver Black Heirloom, coming of age present from his mother’s inheritance. Just gone twelve.
Because surely, while his mother

The cafe I described actually does exist (Next/underneath St. Martin-in-the-fields, in London), although I took liberty with the menu items.
And so, Sunday roast was eaten, and to Teddy’s delight, Mrs. Weasley whipped up a quick chocolate mousse cake upon hearing the happy news, although she did lament their unmarried state, yet again. Mr. Weasley had even taken a picture on his iPhone for the occasion, and it had only taken him half an hour to do so. He was utterly chuffed. Monday passed, included maths, and Harry had helped Teddy with his calculus exercises when he had gotten home. The whole week would be lovely, and unremarkable, and he felt more like he had a grip on his life again. That was, until Thursday rolled around.
article. He had read it in Hermione’s office, while she pursed her lips disapprovingly. He'd felt repulsed by the malintent. He suspects Hermione is the one who gave their staff one of her “I will burn you alive with fire” looks when they had started their Savior gossip today. Which is why no one dared show it overtly, or gossip about it. Thank Salazar, because the article, well, it
and while the shop was still secure and its customers surprisingly loyal, he had still managed to be photographed in Diagon when he had stepped out to have tea with Mrs. Picklewilly.
to talk to Potter.
“Alright then”, Harry replied, picking them up and doing his best to bind them together into a nice looking bouquet. He was silently grateful that Neville had insisted on giving him a flower-binding course last Saturday afternoon because he “wouldn’t see his delicate blooms mishandled in his typically Harry-way”. Harry had rolled his eyes at that, but was relieved when the bouquet seemed to turn out well.
“What is the fuss on the street about, then?” he asks. Mrs. Picklewilly looks like she’s swallowed something unpleasant. Something not pickled, perhaps.
Ministry, as if he wasn’t part of the Wizarding community. In a sense he wasn’t, of course.
, reading the little note with a self-assured nod and a little hum of confirmation.
“Is he cute?”. Draco refused to splutter. Very well.
After having given Jasmin a smile and encouragement to keep up with her excellent work –and could she forward that article on nationality and self-realization, please? He checked on other witches and wizards in his department.
“That doesn’t mean it’s any easier, sweetheart! I still miss dear old Dick every time I look at my jars of pickles, or when I accidently crack an egg too many for breakfast.’’ She smiled slyly “and of course, it’s much colder at night too”. She winked, and Harry managed a shocked grin. “So, we need to make a plan, so that you don’t wile away in that smelly herbal shop of Neville’s, and get yourself a decent husband.” She stated decidedly. “Not that he’s a bad florist, although I must say that when I was but a young witch, there was a florist here on Diagon Alley that - ”
“Children’s magic grows much like children themselves; their magical core is tied to their life force, maturing during puberty, then stabilizing. Sometimes they instinctively know how to channel it properly, in the earliest of wandless magic. Sometimes they don’t, hence the occasional burst of accidental magic.” Harry hummed.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this one, as it is significantly longer, and a lot happens. It was necessary however, to move the plot forwards.
“Do you always ask so many questions? Or are you on an undercover Auror mission, hiding between flowers?” the corner of Draco’s mouth curled up. Would that that be the truth, instead of him pining away in Neville’s shop and trying to hold his act together. “no? Perhaps you’re trying to keep away your many fans by means of dirt and mandrake? I’m sure it won’t fool anyone, Potter”.
“Now, Edward,-” he started addressing Teddy, who cringed at the name
“Is grannie coming over soon?” asks Teddy, sipping his hot chocolate like it is the most normal thing in the world. Perhaps it is, given the frequency Malfoy has come by lately.  Harry is yet to sip his, even though he knows it’s not poisoned and it smells lovely. Again, Malfoy is being weird, making hot chocolate.
Draco sniffed, angled his chin upwards. “You were
“I’m not sure you should know of these matters, Potter. They require some
auror”, “Hard to be with, until nothing’s
. They had plans to start on basic muggle science in the year before they were due to go to Hogwarts, and Harry was secretly looking forward to pouring over those books again. He had always had good grades in primary school, and science was one of the only classes were the teacher had actually giving him compliments.
The Wizengamot had granted his father’s reinstatement and re-trial by a small margin. A small margin, that Potter, blast him, could have swayed, had he deigned to be there. Draco felt his resentment grow. He didn’t want Potter to come to his aid yet again, but he still blamed him for this mess. Stupid Potter, with his perfect inheritance and his perfect house and his perfect little family, none of which Draco had now. He couldn’t even access his trustfund, which was in his name, because it was conditional on his being traditionally bonded. He had to scoff a little at that. Father had probably known about his
“Mhmm,” Potter says, and nods.
They’ve not spoken about it since the day Potter showed up at his, drunk and wanting his hair pulled and his face covered in Draco’s spunk.
“Want to kiss you,” Harry says. And kiss him he does. Draco realises as Harry puts his tongue into his mouth, with very little ceremony, that the weird feeling in his mouth was a teeth-cleaning charm. The cheeky sod.
For what it’s worth (not much, Harry’s still dead), the stone is exactly what Draco had ordered, and seeing the carved
All Draco remembers is the thud of bodies hitting the floor, the crack of bones breaking, the echo of fear and desperation and death.
“Sorry I missed you earlier,” Harry says, polite as always, because they’re always being heard in events like this, whether they notice or not.
It strikes Draco so intensely, every single time, that Draco always follows suit within seconds, no matter what. Harry comes panting, his mouth open wide, eyes shutting tight. He comes with a low, long cry and with long stripes of come painting his own chest or Draco’s or their fists.
He raises an eyebrow in a question.
Harry reaches a hand out and touches Draco’s chest. Draco is wearing a long sleeved jumper but he recognises the pattern as Harry traces it. Collarbone to nipple. Top rib to belly button. Navel to hip.
He can’t help but keep spreading Potter’s cheeks open, making him wince in expectation, but never following through. Potter gasps when Draco slaps his sore arse and then whines when Draco digs his nails in just a little too hard.
Not long after Potter is begging, little hiccoughs falling from his reddened wet lips. Draco rolls his hips back and forth, relishing in that feeling of fullness and just how hard Potter is inside him.
Draco isn’t often lost for words. In fact, he doesn’t quite remember the last time he didn’t have something rude or self-deprecating as a quick answer to something. But he truly doesn’t know what to say. He just looks at it, between them.
Potter does.
By the time Neville and Astoria arrive, Draco’s already outside lighting the bonfire. With the babies in the trustful hands of their future godparents, I step out into the garden with the wicker basket that now has the water Fleur brought and the juniper branches.
It’s easy enough to keep desire high that way. Those who have had him know how good a fuck he is, those who haven’t yet wonder if luck has come to knock on their door every time Draco walks into The Attic.
Potter isn’t nice to Draco at work. The scowling and sad smiles are long gone, though. He’s not nice, but he’s not…
Draco leans back against the pillows, and makes no effort to start undressing, which only makes Harry more desperate. “Let me guess, then. Mavis found my note, Ronald almost popped a vessel, you played protective husband with a thirst for blood, set up a false trail and came running to me.”
They go running, eventually, even though Draco hates it. He fucks Harry against the shower tiles when they’re freshening up after and Harry laughs and makes a joke about muscle soreness and Draco realises this is his life now. This is how the world has decided to reward him for his mistakes, which makes no sense whatsoever.
And he’ll die and won’t ever get the chance to tell him, to kiss his handsome, stupid, precious face, and it aches — it hurts almost as much as that spot just to the left of his breastbone where the Curse had hit, where he was profusely bleeding from not long ago.
Draco was jealous, at first. But, apparently, if it makes Harry
Draco cleans Harry’s wounds with the most care he has put into any task since that fucking Vanishing Cabinet and wraps Harry in a blanket, strokes his hair until sleep takes him.
Harry smiles a lopsided smile and watches, pupils dilated and mouth watering, as his husband finally,
There are only so many times he can hear Draco refer to himself as
“I am dying,” he thinks.
It isn’t the first time Harry Potter’s raised voice is heard by everyone in the bullpen. If all goes well, it won’t be the last either. But it’s still a shock, because Harry is all smiles and jokes and unbridled kindness. You’d think that when it came down to it, it would be the Head Auror that snaps and shouts at everyone, but it’s always Potter that loses his cool.
Draco Apparates into Andromeda’s garden as the pale blues of dawn melt into pinks and yellows and oranges.
Draco shrugs. “Pansy has an alcohol and loud music dependency. I couldn’t handle her crying on my sofa, so I sacrificed myself,” he lies comfortably.
“It’s okay if you don’t want to,” Harry says.
“You didn’t
He’s about to leave when a familiar voice says, “I hoped you’d be here.”
I wake up to Draco shaking my sweat-damp shoulders.
“You sure?” Harry asks.
I was on baby duty last night, which means I get a couple hours in the morning and Draco sorts breakfast. There isn’t one thing out of place, so it isn’t that. The bread is sliced and waiting for me to throw a toasting charm at it, and the coffee is brewed, perfuming the whole house. There’s freshly squeezed orange juice and slices of fruit on a little platter. The kind of shit they have in films — I refuse to believe this is how normal people have breakfast, even if it’s how my husband makes breakfast. How he has made us breakfast for the past four years now.
“I am dying,” Draco croaks out.
Draco rolls his hips against Potter and Potter moans again, low and gravelly,
He waves his hand over the boat, vaguely towards the sleeping forms of my friends, and it’s only when he speaks that I realise he’s doing magic.
I find myself thinking.
“I know, darling. Me too.”
The piece of parchment the unfamiliar owl delivers to Draco at a truly indecent hour reads,
“Wanna fuck me?” Harry asks, then, eyes mischievous and joyful.
“What are you doing?” Draco half-whispers, heart beating loud and fast in his chest, heat rising to his face.
“Getting this over with,” Harry says, a smile dripping with mischief.
He gets up and pulls Potter closer to the sofa.
isn’t one I’d say I possess. But right in the moment, I suddenly become much more my mother than my father.
Draco is falling backwards before he has time to even think about anything, his wand clanking noisily seconds before he joins it on the floor.
“No, they don’t. Not with my maniac husband on the case,” Draco says, and finally, finally lowers his hand to cup Harry’s hardness through his boxers.
I’m biting through a slice of peach when he finally speaks up.
They’ve done this before, of course, that one time at the club. Draco hasn’t forgotten. Draco wishes he had, but it’s all he thinks about when he wanks. All he thinks about when he closes his eyes, really. But that was a year ago. And they’d never discussed it after that night. Just because it happened before it doesn’t mean it’s something they do.
“They’ll never fire you, Golden Boy,” he says, as he grabs a knife from the kitchen counter and starts slicing the cake. “You don’t have to worry.”
It’s suddenly hard to think, hard to focus. The moment my eyes get a glimpse of the scar behind the dark damp curls, my breath catches and I freeze on the spot. I don’t know how long Greg and Vince will stay asleep for, it’s not like I have ever had the reason or opportunity to use spells on actual people.
“I never killed anyone,” Draco retorts, defensively, and runs his hands down Harry’s sides, nails digging in just so, making Harry let out a small gasp.
Harry kisses him, almost shyly, then says, “hello.”
Draco loves him just like this. Half asleep, a little restless.
Draco is aflame. The war is over and fate has decided he’s allowed to live. Live to tell the story and, most importantly, live to roam free as if he’s deserving of it. Redemption is worthless and overrated. Forgiveness is the word of the day, of the month, of the year. He hears it so much and so often his ears bleed. Draco discovers quickly that other people’s forgiveness doesn’t mean that much when he can’t forgive himself.
“But—“
“Harry—“
Draco runs the dull side of the blade against Harry’s neck and he moans. He runs it down Harry’s shoulder, all the way down his arm. Draco knows how that feels. Just the knowledge that the blade is that close, is enough to have one’s skin break into goosebumps. The expectation, the thrill. The cold of the steel against the warmth of the skin.
“Wanna suck you,” Potter says, lips wet.
like that.
Without prompting, she starts, “I see. He hasn’t actually explained anything to you, has he? That wicked boy.”
A revolution.
“Yes?”
He doesn’t say anything — we usually don’t in the morning — but throws me one of those smiles of his and I’m done for. He could be about to tell me he’d killed someone, and I’d melt like the butter I’m currently spreading on my toast.
When Harry threads his fingers through Draco’s he knows they’ll be alright. He’ll be alright.
“Any issues?” Draco asks, eyes never leaving Harry’s hands, watching him shed his waistcoat, and his shirt, then his watch, his boots, trousers and socks.
He really doesn’t fancy getting kicked out of one of his favourite Muggle clubs for indecency but there’s no way he’s stopping this — not when it might be his only chance.
Narcissa comes through the Floo halfway through Saturday, carrying the most gigantic wicker basket I have ever seen. It looks older than life itself, like it’s about to disintegrate.
“More or less,” he says with a shrug, climbing onto the bed and over Draco for a kiss that Draco never allows him to deepen enough to satisfy him. “No dead bodies, no Obliviation required, this time,” he says against Draco’s lips.
“Fuck, Potter. You’re a little cockslut, aren’t you?” He says, because his filter has gone out of the window the moment Potter’s eyes lost most of their green sparkle to the black of his blown-up pupils.
“Astoria,” he says.
“More,” he asks.
I don’t know if it’s the lack of sleep or this whole ceremony thing appearing out of nowhere and into my life, but I suddenly feel the familiar prickle of tears behind my eyes.
“Potter,” Draco whispers against Potter’s neck. Brings his hand from Potter’s pocket and grabs his chin roughly, squeezing his cheeks between thumb and forefinger. “Do you like the feeling of that around your neck?”
“I sent the owl on its way when you got through the wards. Some bullshit reassuring Ronald we’re both safe, there’s no one to apprehend because you lost your cool
Harry decides not to tell Draco yet about the destruction of the land in Yorkshire, even if he knows Draco will be pleased his father’s possessions are gone.
It is an absolute disgrace how quickly Draco is ready to come whenever Potter is near. How he’ll come in his pants like a fourteen year old, or how he’ll lose his cool after the mere hint of Potter’s breath on his crotch. So he says, “stop.”
The wand slides out of my sleeve seamlessly, with ease, as if it’s been waiting for this moment all its life. All my life. All our lives. It feels comfortable to hold, just like it did when I was six, when my mother made it for me. Hawthorn, ten inches, unicorn hair. I still remember the way my heart had leapt inside my chest at hearing my mother say “unicorn” outside of a fairytale context. Unicorn, like something that exists just like myself and her.
I do, Potter. I’d be a lousy secretary if I didn’t. And, much as it pains me to admit, Granger’s my friend. Though you’d never hear me say it about Weasley”. He cleared his throat, and pulled himself upright again. Oddly enough, Harry felt himself lean forwards a bit.
Draco blinks at it as it blows up and vanishes. The Mailwizard looks positively delighted at the little display. Draco turns a raised eyebrow to him, displaying an unaffected manner.
Over the years they had come to accept that while they were very different women, they were both loving mothers. They now had tea every Monday, and Teddy loved Mrs. Granger’s muggle fairytales and children’s detective stories, which she brought with her when the kids were around for homeschooling at the Burrow. Unfortunately for Teddy, she also insisted on bringing them maths and biology homework, which Molly heartily supported, once she found such education lacking in her
, and what a boatload of trouble that has been!” he exclaimed with an indignant air. “And I kept thinking, who would send weird and smelly bouquets with odd Latin phrases for Godric knows what reason? Merlin, only figures it would be you! HA” he thurst a hand through is hair.
However, this chapter took me a month to write and I seem to have forgotten all of what I've written before. If there are any major inconsistencies, please tell me so I can fix them. Updates for now, will be there when they'll be there. Hopefully every month at least.
Then he wondered, looking at the pleading child in front of him, why he was protesting so hard. He had taken care of Teddy for years; kissed his scrapes better, taken him to the play park, held him when he had nightmares. Sure, he wasn’t great at all the “real adult” stuff; the cleaning up, setting strict schedules, or even getting him to eat proper food. But then, he thought, Sirius hadn’t done any of those things either, and Harry had still wanted, so desperately, to be Sirius’ family. To live with him, in this very house. Hell, he might have wanted to call Sirius
Oh shit. This was one of those conversations again, wasn’t it.
rather clever, Edward”. If possible, Potter glared harder at him. He was losing the getting-dressed discussion, badly. With a put-upon sigh, Potter turned towards the kettle.
“Marcus? What are you doing here?” he asks. Marcus is already taking the last step up, and slips past Harry’s slighter form into the hallway.
Raising his eyes back to Malfoy’s face, he noticed a pink blush spreading over his nose.
“Slow down, Granger” he interrupted her, and grasped her hand to squeeze it in comfort. She took a deep breath, gave a weak smile. “Sorry, I know I can ramble on”.
She would not want to intermingle overtly with muggles, nor much see the real point of Squib integration into Wizarding society, but she didn’t herself see her own ‘superiority’ as a pureblood Witch as a reason to exclude others on purpose, or more, try to exterminate them like Voldemort had tried.
Harry didn’t exactly know what the Boggart had turned into for Teddy, but he had an inkling. He could well remember Molly’s Boggart, in this very house, showing her her family, dead. Molly had woken to Teddy screaming in a panic, Victoire running up the stairs already to get her. Teddy had been so frightened his magic had tried to shield him from the threat, but, not having an outlet, had turned into itself. It was comparable to an autoimmune reaction, only magical, and acute, Hermione had explained to him in Mungo’s. Harry had immediately taken hold of Teddy and apparated into the Emergency Ward, where Teddy was seized and brought to Spell Damage. Limbs and magic splaying everywhere, they had had to strap him down to get calming draughts down his throat, before they could set up a sort of wizarding IV fluid; it had no tubes, but required precise incision, for which Teddy needed to be still. At that point, Harry had been pushed out into the hall, told to “Please wait, Mr. Potter”.
, Mailwizard Fawcett,” he adds drily. The wizard eyes the other fluttering mail a little hungrily.
Draco do anything” she said calmly, and accepted the cup of coffee from Sanaz, who had returned. She sat down, leaned forwards curiously.
Clementia Beauregard was a formidable witch who, due to an unfortunate marriage and oldfashioned laws, had lost her own seat on the Wizengamot. Madam Beauregard could be gruff, but her sense of fairness and justice were her main motivators, and he thought Jasmin would do well to learn from her. Her beaky nose -not unlike the late Professor Snape's, was capable of sniffing out legal fallacies like not other, and she had survived both wizarding wars to come out with a complete lack of patience for uselessness and inefficiency. Groveling was utterly beneath her. Draco had immediately liked her, even if she called him ‘young Malfoy’, still, after years of working directly under Hermione. Hermione had said she was like Headmistress McGonagall, only without the tartan robes and a mouth full of legal-speak.
Harry stayed in the same room he’d always been in; the Astronomer’s Room.
Sirius saw memories flash by of himself, barely sixteen. Hiding in pubs and sleeping under bridges until James rescued him. How much he cried when Euphemia hugged him and called him her son. James standing up for him when they all sneered at the runaway. Being given a
“The war is over. It's been done with for a while now. We've finished our mourning and moved on - well, most of us have. " She smiled apologetically "We've grown. All of us. And I believe so have you. What matters is that you’ve realized your mistakes. And that you’re trying to better yourself. Right?”
"Fine," he rolled his eyes. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Now move over, I want to be the bank."
Draco points at a group of stars. “There’s your godfather. The brightest star in the Canis Major. Some might even call it the dog star.”
The pillow is unfairly soft – for something made of Hippogriff. Harry’s been considering  getting a few of them for himself. And Dean, seeing as the man used it more than Neville did.
“Even when I know that I should be calling it a fork it’s- it's hard alright?” Then he looked up, blue-grey eyes like broken glass. “But I
Narcissa went on. “We barely… He… It was Bella. She said they were playing. The marks of the Cruatius curse said otherwise.”
Malfoy didn’t seem to notice. “Mudbloods and their naming systems.” He said offhandedly.
Ron looked pretty impressed when he high-fived Harry. Dean on the other hand… Maybe a Quidditch match with Ginny wasn't such a bad idea after all. She would probably have more mercy on him than Dean.
that struck his heart though. Someday could mean tomorrow, but it could also mean thirty years later. Harry didn’t think he wanted someday to come.
At that moment,  Blaise Zabini crashed into them.
“Hey!” The boy rasped. “Give it back. That’s my supper.” He made a grab for the loaf of bread but otherwise didn’t put up much of a fight. He was too tired for it, it looked like.
By the time dawn rolled around, Sirius was too exhausted to move.
“You can’t bring him home yet,” Their fingers intertwined, foreheads pressed together. “Look after him, find out what he’s doing out here.” Remus was right to worry.
Moony smiles sadly. “Love might leave, even if it’s right, but it always, always comes back.”
Potter shrugged in lieu of a response. Not going to give Draco the pleasure of a banter, eh?
A trip back home, and then he was padding back to the alleyway again. Lighting shook above him as pellets of rain damped his coat. Not even that could shake his resolve now.
Draco interacting with muggle appliances is my favourite thing ever so I just had to, okay? Even if the toaster thing's kinda common.
"Maria just found out Jacques was the guy pulling all the hate mail out form her letters and-"
“I’d like to, yes. But I’m not sure how.”
“Merry Christmas.”
So much for making amends.
Draco smiled at him, eyes still closed. His hair was tousled and there were marks on his cheek from the pillow. Draco’s silk pyjama shirt had come unbuttoned halfway through the night, probably because Harry was too busy blushing to check if he’d buttoned them right.
“Of course. Yes, you can go first while I err…”
I'd love to hear if you like this perspective. I love Draco as a character, although he's not as snarky inside as he seems on the outside, to me. I also can't wait to see Draco interact with Teddy. I have some scenes planned... if you want them?
“Malfoy, if you don’t want to see Andromeda, I’d suggest leaving before she gets here, in like, half an hour” he said, not unkindly.
Clearly Belby liked to kiss and tell to his new lover, Edgecombe, about what had displeased him so much about Potter –especially in the bedroom.
“How long have they been here?” He asked, speaking up so Neville could hear him, feeling already tired. His stomach was grumbling unhappily, having forgone breakfast.
“Why this, all of a sudden, Ted?” he asked cautiously. He looked Teddy over, his honey-coloured hair, his pale, thin face. Amber eyes turned to him, unsure. Harry’s heart clenched.
“How vile”, he sneers at the magazine in disgust, and Hermione huffs again.
I mean, 8 chapters until a decent convo is already quite long, and I don't want to wait until chapter 20 for a kiss, right?
. Leaving the sink for a bit, he quickly moves to the hallway, where he had seen some dustbunnies when entering earlier. Flicks of his wands clear the dust, and the boots in the entryway line up neatly, clacking their heels together. He leaves the mirror on the wall above a now gleaming dark side table, since that is done better with a decent rag the Muggle way. He doesn’t dare move towards the sitting room next door, but he can still do some more in the kitchen. Within minutes, the carpet beneath the table is dustfree, the little sofa backing the wall has its cushions fluffed, and all the dinnerware is back in its proper place.
Harry cleared his throat. He didn’t know what to say.
“Alright! Thank you. There, now, sleep well, Andromeda.”
But Harry was unable to. Unable to forgive Malfoy for so many things, because when he came home, he had little Teddy, who was crying and had nightmares and hated loud noises for the longest time. Teddy, who was growing up in Grimmauld Place because Death Eaters had killed his parents. Grimmauld Place, which was his because Sirius died at another Death Eater’s hand; Draco’s aunt.
much.
“Oh shush, that’s not true! To be fair, I don’t even really know how he’s coping. He’s always running around and smiling like he’s dealing, and meanwhile he’s getting skinnier and grown a beard!” she exclaims, exasperated. Draco laughed.
Da dum! More plot, there you go!
“Looks good. I see that you are integrating the research from Montréal University as well. ” He hummed a bit, and handed it back. “How did you find the muggle statistics?” he inquired, giving her a small smile.
Fennel:         Flattery
Draco tunes it out, humming here and there, and eating as quickly as he can without being impolite. The betrothal situation has been averted, and he suddenly feels very tired. He doesn’t notice his mothers bright, fond eyes.
“That’s right,” says Neville neutrally. “Draco’s my friend, as well. I think he’s told me about you, actually”, he says. The young man surveys both Harry and Neville, then the empty shop, and seems to come to a decision.
“No, of course not, Harry. But I trust Draco, you know.” Hermione said, seriously now.
truly awful.
“I’m sure I don’t make that much of a difference, though.” He muttered. Mrs. Picklewilly pursed her lips disapprovingly.
, or else he wouldn’t have testified for him at his trial, let alone allow him around Teddy. He wasn’t a murderer, a willing Death Eater. What he was, was an annoying, spineless
He finds himself telling her about the single parent support group, and Healer Lindsay. He feels her eyes on him, but he carefully skirts the whole Malfoy debacle. He knows she has tea with him as well, and he’s not up for discussing the weirdness that is Malfoy at his house, cooking up a storm and telling Teddy fairytales about constellations. She nods and ‘hmms’ at appropriate intervals, and she seems very interested in who he’s met at his support group, and he belatedly realizes she wanted him to ‘find a good husband to settle down with’. He stops abruptly, and tries to scramble for a new topic. His eyes land on the stack of newspapers next to her till.
His eyes bulged. “So LONG?!” he whined, “I will be
“Wouldn’t
“Now, young man! You need to get changed, before Ron and ‘Mione get here, okay?”. Teddy, still twirling, yelled “I knooow, I’m going, I’m going!” and bounded upstairs, no doubt picking out yet another eye-wateringly bright outfit. But Harry couldn’t complain, since he was the one buying Teddy all that he wanted, however ridiculous. And it wasn’t like he had any fashion sense himself.
“Harry?” came Teddy’s small voice. It tore through Harry’s heart.
He had come in the next day to get a brief explanation, get decked out with chocolate pecan turtles made by Hannah, and had simply started tending the shop. Cleaning, watering, reading up on his basic herbology skills. Talking to the babbling begonia's, softly stroking the white velvet lilies. While he wasn’t able to help out much with the medicinal plants or more dangerous one –yet, Neville came in nearly every day just before closing to check up on them. Three days a week Neville assisted professor Sprout at Hogwarts, having accepted an apprenticeship with the goal to take over from her in two years. All in all, he had only had half a week to twiddle his thumbs and ignore letters from Robards. To feel the gaping hole inside him grow larger and larger. Keeping busy helped. If not for the press still harassing him when he stepped out on the street about his and Marcus’ breakup, and the sleepless nights, he could keep up the pretense that he was fine. Especially in the week of Teddy’s birthday. He just simply
“She’s trustworthy, if that’s what you’re asking” he says a bit tersely. “And no, I don’t make it a habit to concern myself overly with Potter.” He scoffs.
“Yes yes, you firedrake”. He laughs, and steps out quickly for some chamomile tea, making a mental note to get some pregnancy-safe calming draughts. They’d need it before long.
“Would you like a coffee, mr. Potter?”
“Would you like some help, Mrs. Picklewilly?” he asks politely, seeing as she was now perching it precariously on one of her overfull spindly legged tables. The cups rattled alarmingly as she bumped the tray.
Unaware of Harry’s turmoil, Teddy happily hummed to himself as he gathered his schoolthings.
“Ex-Aurors can’t arrest flower thiefs, though, I heard” he jests. Harry can feel a smile tug at his lips.
Harry shook his head. “Not at all, just be careful”.
“Shut up, Malfoy. It’s a support group thing, I got a reference from St. Mungo’s” he answers, willing himself not to look more embarrassed than he already does. Man, today can hardly get any worse. Then he remembers, Malfoy doesn’t actually have an accord with Andromeda. As far as he knows, he’s in for yet another awkward meeting. Which would be amusing, but it might hurt Andromeda, too. Better check, actually.
And so they decide that Mrs. Picklewilly will start plying Potter first, and Hermione and Weasley would have him over for dinner a few days after that, so the information could have had time to set. According to Hermione “Harry needs to reach that conclusion on his own, or he won’t do it”. Stubborn prat, Potter is.
, he reminds himself.
“A bloke named Shelly, I remember”
Well, ex-Auror, officially, but he still had all of those skills. He could transfigure his face into someone else’s, so he wouldn’t be recognized. He could, and then he would be just another delivery Wizard. But his Gryffindor courage, and hell, his
It suddenly clicked. “It’s Thursday today!” he exlaimed.
! Not to me, not to Ron.” She took a deep breath. “I’m just so
“I didn’t know you were such good friends, actually”. He sits down to more tea. He’s made it blacker this time, and Malfoy looks at it rather despondently.
you, dear”.
Thus, Draco muses, as Wizengamot member Rattlesby drones on about the importance of pureblood rituals at Easter, they will not win. Blaise had recently informed him that Rattlesby lost a considerable fortune dabbling in the trade of magical creatures –potentially the illegal kind. And, as the meeting draws to a close, he decides he’ll put his own little feeler out on the others, just to wipe the smirks off their faces. He’s sure Lawrence will find something, dig long enough until something nasty shows up. They’re purebloods. Draco knows as no other how many horrible little secrets can be hidden by a good name and a sheen of tradition.
“I… feel the need to concern myself with his wellbeing.” He ventured. He looked askance at Hermione, saw her mouth form a skeptical line.
Hermione had grown up, and had become the bigger person. She had had it in her to forgive someone who had done everything in his power to make her life, and that of others like her, impossible. Ron had seen it, and had decided to learn from it.
“During the trial, he’s allowed to exercise all of his rights as a true Lord in the Wizengamot.” She finishes, voice small. Draco swallows audibly.
“My ex-wife is Muggle” he said.
, you know. He doesn’t let on, but resigning from the Aurors! And I can tell he’s not eating properly.” Draco nodded. Potter was fast approaching “peaky” looking, if not “post war harried and starved”.
“These are for your mother, then?” he asked, not able to contain his curiosity any longer.
Harry laughed as the man blustered back, looking supremely aggravated. The next reporter, a young witch with blue braids and revealing violet robes tried, and failed again. Silently shrieking, she fell back on the street, looking outraged. The reporter after that, a thin, pale wizard with floppy blond hair, held his camera in his outstretched hand behind him, and came furthest inside the door, before he too was repelled again outside on the street.
. A three-piece, teal suit, the waistcoat embroidered with
“Do you now, mother? Very well, let me tell you about this new research we have set up concerning muggle education…” and so he went on, talking through what the department was working on, especially relating the missed opportunities for Squibs by enrolling them in regular Muggle education.
a hypocrite, seeing that Potter had likely shagged his way through half of wizarding Britain, with his Savior status, but he could work with it. Embarrassment was as good a start as any, he supposed.
*Allium's meaning (as many of onion/leek type of plants) is patience, humility. Malfoy's unsure of his position, and while he's not completely sincere in his intentions towards Harry, he so very much wants to be included in Teddy's life. He just needs a chance, and a little more time. Also, how can there be a dinner table without floral ornamentation? It's uncouth, that's what it is ;)
“And you did?!” Malfoy yells back, but he looks like he feels ill as soon as it slips out. Harry instantly deflates, falling back in the chair.
“Oh, I know. I’ve seen the snack drawer.” Draco waves a dismissive hand, still grinning.
“Tell me, who are these for then?” he asked, as he added some leafy greens to buff it out a little.
“He’s running a slight fever
“In here!” he answered from the kitchen, and quick footsteps brought Teddy bouncing into the kitchen, straight to the refrigerator.
He heard some furious whispering behind him. With a 'pop!' the toast jumped out of the toaster and he braved facing them again. He placed a piece of toast on his own plate, buttered it and spread it thickly with two types of jam. He then cut it in two, and popped it on Teddy’s plate, next to his eggs and beans. “Thanks Haz,” Teddy croaked, and set to eating. He felt Hermione’s gaze on him, and looking over, her eyes were soft. He smiled at her.
they decided to marry, not in any way apologizing for her daughters' lack of household skills, and being
Meanwhile, I received so many lovely comments, and they lifted my spirits enormously. I am overflowing with gratitude, and I will get back to every one of you as soon as I can. I prioritized writing a new chapter first, however.
“Marcus, stop!” Harry yells, and quickly advances on them, pulling Marcus bodily from Malfoy, who gets pushed against the table, which makes a loud screeching noise as the legs scrape against the floor.
“I have a new little job for you, if you’re interested.” Swallowing another bread mass audibly, Lawrence turned his sharp brown eyes on Draco.
“Potter, good afternoon. You’re still here, I see.”
… he doing here?!” Marcus demands, his chest heaving. He looks furious.
“Oh. Why does he need courage?”. Draco glanced at Potter. Reeled him in nicely, didn’t he? Now, push him over the edge.
“Correct”. Harry says, putting down his tea, and scratches at his beard. It was getting a bit too long, these days.
, he was sure, meant friend. At least these ones weren’t blackmail flowers, then. He couldn’t care less about those for Edgecombe. If he dared, he’d put poison ivy in it, and curse it to spit on his face. Unfortunately, he was certain it would cause Neville to lose his business, and he didn’t want that.                                                    After putting aside the last order, Harry leans over the counter in Spectral Sprouts, feeling tired. His eyes follow the pair of witches, barely out of Hogwarts, who are debating between a Witch Basil plant for their flat-share, or a Regrowing-Tomato plant. He might try to convince them to get plugs for both at the price of one full-grown plant. A little more work, but a budget friendly option. He rubs his face, his beard was getting longer.
“I have never had parents, Lawrence. Neither has Neville, because of the first war.” Neville nods at him, eyes serious. He sees Lawrence flinch a little, as if the comment brings up some memories of his own.
“I bet you didn’t make those choices, though, did you?” Lawrence spits out.
With a screech of his chair, Potter jumped up and launched himself at Teddy.
, a Black relative. He really couldn’t leave it alone now, could he?
“I know! I just need some flowers, imminently!” He exclaimed again, slightly frantic, looking ready to stop Harry physically from throwing him out. “I was held up at work and I really need to bring flowers to dinner to placate mother so she’s -” he started rambling, before stopping himself abruptly. His blush deepened, and he coughed awkwardly. Harry snorted again.
, he thought. They were indeed toeing the line with the Statute of Secrecy, but that was why they employed Madame Beauregard, who had given them the exact parameters in which to work. And a stern gaze complete with approving nod.
be more specific, Lawrence”. A small, horrific smirk was beginning to form on his narrow, tan face. Oh no. That meant Lawrence had scented blood. No use for it now.
“Just me, Malfoy.” He sighed. Grey eyes found his face again.
. But apparently Edgecombe's pureblood pride extended only so far as his vanity allowed him; had wanted to show himself better than the Savior.
“Neville asked me to check on you. Hermione too, for that matter.”
“We see this occasionally, with kids that either have strong uncontrollable magic, or suffer from trauma.” He briefly glanced at Harry, hesitating a little. Harry inclined his head so the man would continue.
care. It wasn’t just because he knew the boy was a distant relative. But it was also Potter, who was supposed to be living as the great hero, the winner of the war, and he was so obviously struggling. Sitting in front of him in threadbare clothes, looking tired, his house an utter mess and his godson sick. And some
“What are
He did this sometimes, sleeping in what to him was still Sirius’ room. He hadn’t changed it much since. Surely Sirius would both laugh at and scold him for leaving up the posters of scantily clad muggle girls, the Gryffindor banner, and the frankly disturbing amount of David Bowie posters. After the war, when he was finally ready to face the house, this was the last room he was able to enter. Then, after Ron and Hermione had helped him clean the house, forcefully took down Mrs. Black’s portrait (Hermione had contacted old Professor Flitwick, who had advised her to try the charm he had used to remove the Weasley twins’ swamp), and redecorated the main living spaces, he had finally dared enter it, with vague ideas about making this his own bedroom. But he couldn’t touch it, even after all these years. He’d emptied out all the drawers on the desk, the closet, only to put everything back the way he found it. Everything, from old letters Sirius had written to Remus, to his father, little doodles, bits of twinkly wire, discarded projects, it was all valuable to Harry. The only connection he had left to those people he was afraid to forget. The house itself was a living reminder of it, the magic sometimes as jittery as his previous master, energetic and chaotic, a little dark. Less now, after years of having Harry as its master.
set Malfoy on me!” he accused.
” the headline proclaimed, showing Marcus exiting one of his favourite restaurants, holding the arm of some guy Harry had seen around the Ministry before, but didn’t know by name.
“They’re a recent addition. Custom frame and everything, I figured it was some fancy modern art.” He waves a dismissive hand. “What do I know of art? Some of it looks just like that!”.
He thought the worst had been over, with his breakup splashed all over the news two days after Marcus had left Grimmauld for the last time, smiling apologetically, leaving Harry on the doorstep feeling like he had been caught by an ambush on an easy Auror mission. By his own partner, for crying out loud. He had no idea how all of a sudden, everyone had known about their breakup. At that point, he'd only told Ron and Hermione that the two of them "weren't doing so well".
“You’re not supposed to direct personal mail to the Ministry, Malfoy,” Mailwizard Fawcett said, pretending nothing was amiss, while more Mail was starting to cling to Malfoy’s aura. Draco clenched his jaw.
“Yes, your little Squib pawn, ready for action’’ he spits out, and Draco winces.
His mother gives him a small smile at the flowers, and kisses him on his cheek. “You’re late, darling”, she says. Her lips are pressed together in disapproval, but she takes his arm and leads them to the dining room, handing over the bouquet to Tippy to put in a vase.
than enough. Mrs. Picklewilly was right; Potter had a seat –
Utter shite.
. And all of them will be staring, like they had when the previous newspaper articles had dropped. They will be chuckling, whispering ‘oooh, look at the poor little Death-Eater’, and follow him with their greedy little gossipy eyes. He suppresses a shudder.
“You know who that is?” Potter’s eyes shutter a bit. Oh no. No, better keep going. Come on, Draco!
know, they are carefully crafted messages with a clear purpose”. Potter looked at him disbelievingly.
floor. His territory, and he watched it like a hawk. Would protect it fiercely too, which it would come to soon, when their newest plans would be presented.
“You talk about Harry with other people?”
Hermione gave a startled laugh.
“Thanks” he said. The Healer took a deep breath and set his shoulders.

on VCR. His thoughts kept drifting off to Marcus, seemingly already moved on, and his toothpaste, still on the shelf in his ensuite bathroom. A mint-coloured reminder that apparently, Harry couldn’t compete with unattached, unscarred and polished purebloods. “Haz?” Teddy asked, turning to face him on the couch on hands and feet. He had his clawed socks on, and they were scratching the blanket he put over them.
, not with Hermione keeping an eye on him.
. Harry?”. Harry pulled himself out of his increasingly depressing thoughts
Neville’s shop was a small little shop at the east end of Diagon, and the smell inside was just incredible. As soon as you stepped inside you were enveloped in the scent of a wide array of flowers, herbs, and ozone. While not all that light inside the shop itself, it had a wonderful little greenhouse in the back where it was always sunny and warm. Harry took his tea breaks there. That was another perk of working in Neville’s shop; all the different tea brews he could sample, all of which were sold in the shop themselves.
. Based on
A lot of things had changed after the war. Not just wizard-society’s sense of security, cohesion, and pride, but equally, the relationship between the Ministry and Hogwarts. A new wave of cooperation and democratization had slowly crested. While Wizengamot members still decided on educational decrees, school governors had been replaced by a real, muggle style PTA, who served as a check on Wizengamot reforms. Membership was free, Wizarding ancestorship not required. Yes, a lot of things were different. Better, even.
Neville sold all sort of beautiful, magical and non-magical flowers, plants, and in the greenhouse in the back, magical herbs for potions and medicine.
“Don’t presume I need your help, Malfoy” he bites out in a low voice.
“Oh, I don’t really.  Just, satisfy my curiosity, Potter. Granger and Weasley have certainly managed, well on their way actually.” Harry looked up in suprise.
He felt undeniably nervous. What business had he, to be standing here in front of the Black ancestral home, between the dilapidated garden hedges, the creaking gate, and in front of the dark wooden door with a gleaming, golden doorknocker. The doorknocker he had been trying to find the courage to actually
The baby’s breath was enchanted to sing a variety of songs, and customers were able to choose what songs they sang. Malfoy nodded appreciatively.
Andromeda is not as surprised as he thinks she ought to have been, at the news that Malfoy is at Grimmauld. She positively smirks when he reluctantly relates how Teddy as asked him to stay for her stories. “Very well, then. I will mind both Teddy and my little nephew,” the Black blood prominent in her tone. “I should like to see what has become of Narcissa’s boy” she grins, dark eyes sparkling and making her look younger, even in the unflattering light of the flames.
Malfoy has now entered the hallway, and a snort alerted them to his presence. “Then why does it
Harry's still sad, Teddy's being the cutest kid, and there is some good news to be had.
Want a little teaser?
“Potter doesn’t cook?” he frowns. Teddy cocks his head. “He cooks breakfast. And cereal.”
And so, the morning went on, Harry and Neville drinking tea and watching the reporters trying, and failing to work around their restrictions. While still wracked with guilt for bringing this on Neville, it was also remarkably satisfying.
“That appears to be so. And?” An insistent blush was trying to creep up his cheeks. Oh
He hears Blaise’s raised voice, and he Goblin’s stern response. Not unsympathetic sounding, however. Nothing could be done. He left them to it, and stood to leave.

“I don’t know what I expected, honestly” he muttered under his breath, and moved to the door.
“Well, then you should call me Draco, Teddy”. Teddy nodded seriously. Draco smiled at the boy. He thought he could like his cousin.

“Just here to help, Potter” he replied calmly, despite his own worry. It was
“…I don’t understand, how can you still trust him after that?!” came the angry voice from the boy. Neville notices Harry in the doorway to the sunroom and gestures him to come in.

at Malfoy.
He debated not going, but what was he going to do at home all day? Alone? Teddy was going to go to the Weasley’s; he didn’t want Teddy to miss school. He’d just take his wriggling worm-stomach to the shop, then.
“You know this man right? He has cinnamon rolls! We can eat the cinnamon rolls, right Harry?” Teddy’s hushed voice was clearly pleading in Potter’s jumper.
The oatmeal was cooling down and rapidly congealing, and soon enough it
Hermione turns this way and that, looking slightly awkward standing in front of the mirror in pinned-up robes.
Standing on a little step, Teddy was beating eggs furiously with a fork, bits having already flown into his currenly fuchsia coloured hair. His eyes were his own honey-colour, and with his scruffy play-clothes, he couldn’t look more like the incarnation of both his parents.
He was handsome, with long dark hair, looking tall and athletic, and quite frankly, pureblood. Whether it was the cheekbones or the expensive looking robes, he looked much more polished and refined than Harry could ever dream to be.
“So, that’s a yes?” Teddy asked, a bit squeaky. Harry stroked his hair again.
He can see the instant Malfoy spots him. He visibly pulls himself together, taking on the sharp, coldly distant appearance he displays to the public. It’s a little unnerving, seeing the two side by side.
I'm overdue, and I know it! So, my rewritten draft for my thesis was rejected, and I have to tweak it AGAIN. Hopefully it'll be accepted then. Apparently I don't write 'aggressively' enough. Sure, I generally want my argument to sneak up on you, and not charge ahead like a bull.  Well, f that, and here is a chapter full of hate and tension.
Still setting the scene, no Draco in this one, sorry!
“And you should see what it’s doing to Harry! Especially after that horrendous article in Witch Weekly! He doesn’t even!-” she gained in volume, opening the curtain with far more fervor than strictly necessary.
Teddy had already finished his and was going over to Malfoy to check on his curry making process, fascinated by the stretching dough for naan. He watched them for a moment, interacting naturally. Malfoy talked to Teddy like he was an adult, although without all the sneer and double entendre. Malfoy was lowering the hob to a quiet simmer, and it seemed that at least all the preparatory work was done. A flick of his wand had a timer floating over the simmering pot, set for the hours until dinner. Apparently curry making was a long process. Teddy was excited about it, something he’d only had for take-out, and loved, if it wasn’t spicy. Malfoy was assuring Teddy it wasn’t spicy, since he wasn’t used to it either. It was strangely adorable, and it made him reluctant to ask Malfoy to leave. After all, if Teddy was okay with it, perhaps it wasn’t all that bad.
He doesn’t notice how she looks at him with plans swimming in her head as she kisses him goodnight.
The reporter obviously triggered the monitoring charm on the doorframe, which
He hears the voice exclaim a high pitched “oh!” and the door opens immediately, revealing the pale form of Teddy Lupin. Not in pajamas, but in another curious ensemble. Draco finds he can appreciate the red corduroy pants and purple starry t-shirt, which is complemented by purple buckled boots not unlike the ones elderly Wizarding folk seem to favor. Teddy is smiling at him, even if he looks a bit peaky. While he knew that Teddy was a metamorphmagus, this seemed to be his unmagicked self. Perhaps a side effect from the potions?
to make him listen. This is too important, it’s just- ” she clenches her shoulders together. Draco cocks his head. He’s unsure whether to include her into what he knows of Edgecombe. Judging by the disastrous conversation he had witnessed between Potter and Belby, there’s not a chance of them getting back together, but obviously Potter wasn’t over him. At least not so much that he wouldn’t be hurt by more news and rumours involving his former lover. It was one thing to be left for someone else, but quite another to be left for a real piece of scum, and still deemed lacking. He decides against it. He’s not sure how to use the piece of information yet, and is sure that without it, Hermione will prevent him from disclosing it,
Potter frowns and glances over
More ferarum: the mores of a beast; sex in the manner of beasts (I think we can all figure what that is pointing towards)
“It is green and has yellow mushrooms! He looks dis-GUS-ting” Teddy giggles, and he looks like he hasn’t been ill in ages, happy. Draco laughs too. How opportune, really, since it’ll give him time to start dinner before Potter throws him out.
” in cheery orange lettering. At Draco’s surprised look, Harry laughed. “You’re not the only one Hermione drags to that shop to eat carrot cake with, you know”. Draco laughed despite himself.
“Sleeping sachets, Malfoy”. Malfoy gave it a derisive sniff, his delicate nostrils flaring.
“Godric yes, any day now, and blaming me for it.” He smiled fondly, obviously besotted. Draco tried very hard not to be jealous. While he didn't really want a pregnant wife -Merlin knows his mother would have jumped at the chance-, Neville and Hannah's sweet domesticity did stir some tender feelings in him. Which he subsequently tried to squash, since even reformed Death-Eathers couldn't have such things. He gave Neville a genuine smile.
, it said, followed by a floo address, and interestingly, a Muggle phone number. “You have a phone?” he asked, a little surprised. The healer was definitely looking a bit embarrassed now.
here, Harry?” Teddy asks a little angrily. He sounds betrayed. Harry sighs. He doesn’t want to go into it, with his child.
“Thank you, chap!” he exclaimed upon seeing Harry’s transfigured self behind the large bouquet. He eyed the apron. “Spectral Sprouts, eh? Isn’t that where Harry Potter has fled to? You know ‘m?” he inquired.
“I just asked you if he was sick!” Marcus responds, defensive.
“I don’t think I’ve had a proper lunch since Hermione discovered it, honestly”
“What?” asked Malfoy. “Am I not allowed to have tea before starting dinner, like a common house elf?” he sneers.
“Good” he took another swallow of wine, the bottle given to him by Hermione. It was quite pleasant actually, nothing sour.
Hermione asks Draco a question, and he gets an interesting proposal from an unlikely source.
“I’m just worried. In another month, they’ll all know and see, especially if I’m wearing robes like this!”. She was right, the deep red robes were gathered artfully around the waist and remained tight in a fashionable drop-waist style. Her stomach had only the slightest curve, nothing remarkable yet. But in five weeks that would be noticibly different, at the Annual Ministry Function for Magical Cooperation.
head. He half expected a protest from Teddy that he was too old to be babied, or cuddled, or whatever, but it didn’t come.
father, was he? How could he be so central to Teddy’s existence? After all, he was still just Harry.
Potter looked at him, considering. He seemed to decide to take him at face value.
I rushed it, because I'm going away for a time at the end of next week and wanted to upload something before leaving.

He would never let Molly, but maybe he could let Andromeda.
At five, and in the years since, Harry had brought up the subject of Remus and Tonks often, no matter how much it hurt him. He wanted Teddy to know his wonderful, brave parents. When the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts came around, and Harry couldn’t sleep regardless, he and Teddy curled up in Sirus’ room, and look through what little pictures he had of Remus, and the wealth of pictures of Tonks he had been given by Andromeda. He would tell stories about them, as much as he could bear, so Teddy would know them. More than he had every been able to know, as a child, about his own parents. He was certain Teddy knew he
they knew Malfoy to be, as children, though. Sanaz nodded again in understanding.
So, here he stood. He had managed to pilfer the last two cinnamon rolls from the Muggle bakery in addition to a hideous monstrosity with whipped cream and strawberries which he imagined children might like, and het set out to Grimmauld Place. He was sure the girl from the bakery had laughed at him when he had ordered the cream
“oh yes, he does.”
“Teddy” he mutters, and he turns to the stairs, leaving Malfoy in the hallway. He finds Teddy sitting on the top step, leaning against the dark wooden bannister, looking mutinous. He finds the Pepper-up, and gives Teddy a small dose, before they both go downstairs.
“Are you just going to state the obvious?” he smirks. Malfoy stands up, and starts cleaning his own cup.
In sleep, Potters face is slack, but he looks even more exhausted. His grungy grey t-shirt has slid to the side at the neck to reveal a too-bony collarbone. His beard is wild, his hair even wilder, and he has pushed his glasses askew. Draco sighs, tries not to feel concerned, or sorry. They haven’t really had a conversation yet, but it hardly seems the time to start one. You can’t really charm a tired person into being agreeable. Or at least, Draco never could. And definitely not with Potter. He huffs, a little indignant, and puts the mug down carefully on the little sidetable next to the couch. He then casts a stasis charm on it, and cautiously removes Potter’s glasses to set them next to the mug. Potter looks so young. And he’s a
She laughed at him, and he could see behind the fluttering elderly lady she portrayed a clever Witch, not nearly close to retiring in any sense.
“Well, I didn’t buy cereal, actually” he admits. He had intended to bring them some healthy dinner foods, things that would make Potter less pale, maybe wean Teddy off the pastries. Trying not to sound too much like a boring adult he states:
While their cooperation had sprouted from grim-faced determination to start over and a shared vision for a better wizarding society, they had become fast friends. Since working together, they had managed to introduce a new curriculum for Muggle Studies, and a Wizarding Studies class for all muggle-borns in their first year, equally open to wizard-raised children. Hermione had claimed it would have helped many a student navigate their world more easily.
in the right place.
“ ’Mione I got your owl already you don’t need to-”
He looked up from Neville’s letter when another owl tapped at his window; it was Ron and Hermione’s barn owl, Spook. He took its letter, which read in Hermione’s script;
Nescis, if I remember correctly, is to ‘not know’; I meant it to say; you know not discretion.
“Well!? Aren’t you opening it?” Malfoy prods urgently. He’s hovering over him, and smells strongly of raw onions.
“We have different shifts, actually.” He answered curtly. “Have a good day”, he said politely, and with a nod, left. By Godric, if people started to remember the name of Neville’s shop, they might have to figure out some new ways of keeping the nosy-parkers out. Though it might be excellent for Neville’s business. He made a note to bring it up when he got back.
. That couldn’t mean anything good, least of all for him.
if Teddy wanted to call him dad? What a small thing to ask for. What a precious, unexpected gift. He sighed.
He signed it with his initials, and handed it back over. Potter –rudely-, glanced at the little card. He flicked his eyes up to Draco’s.
“The shop-owner across the street from Neville? The pickle-shop woman?” she looks slightly bewildered. Draco nods. “What does she have to do with our bill?” Draco leans forward.
The sudden stillness in the space unsettles him. Neville had gone, and now Potter, too.
Hermione had struck up a friendship with a girl from the bakery, who turned out to not be a girl so much as an Aunt of two little boys, a little younger than Teddy’s age, and they were passing a football on the field. Sanaz was getting them all coffee from a nearby stand. She’d also gotten them some strawberry creampuffs in a bulky Muggle cooler, which Harry was silently eyeing.
“I killed a man, you know. People tend to forget” he finishes. Lawrence looks confused.
He’d taken one look at the lovely, blushing, frilly robes wearing Miss. Rosewood, and removed himself from the restaurant. It wasn’t as if he rejected them for merely being female; they couldn’t do anything about his preferences, and he would maybe set them aside for family's sake –although he hadn’t decided on that yet.
“You want a card with the flowers?”
“Listen, I don’t know who you are, but I’m not here to council anyone on Malfoy. I hardly know him”. Harry grumbled, immediately on the defensive. He’d wrapped his hands in the cloth, and had covered the unpruned fangs with another,  lest it try to attack him or his customer. The young man’s mouth pulls into a straight, severe line. He looks at the countertop angrily.
“Sure, Drake-o” Lawrence grinned, and took his arm. Frowning, Draco apparated them to an apparition point just behind the National Portrait Gallery. Close by was their usual café, set somehow charmingly in the crypts of a Muggle church. The atmosphere had always reminded him of the wine-parties in the Malfoy Manor winecellars, and too, of the subterranean coziness of the Slytherin common room.
“Ooooh, you brought food!” Teddy exclaims, when Draco puts down the bag on the table, huffing. He was still hot, but smiled at his cousin. He definitely looked better than last time, although that wasn’t saying much. He hears an enormous crash coming from upstairs, followed by even more curses. Teddy glances up, grins again.
“Oh. Well. Oh. How unfortunate. Well then.” She starts, fidgeting.
Lawrence cannot accept that he's been so tricked by Draco, and goes to find answers to what he considers to be the only reliable source. Of course it has to be Harry, right?
But he’d also not forgotten what Malfoy’d said about corruption and backhanded deals in the ministry. Had he really closed his eyes to it? Had Marcus been wrong, in saying the Aurors should remain neutral in political reform? He felt uncomfortable even considering it. With all that had happened with Teddy, he hadn’t thought of Marcus that much, but after Malfoy’d left the first time, he’d started thinking.
At the same time, the excitement of the Aurors was in part also due to the romantic attachment he’d had with his partner. The adrenaline rush after a raid was excellent fuel for explosive chemistry, which made him feel dunk on the excitement, on being with Marcus. Then, after the excitement calmed down, he felt guilty for leaving Teddy for days at a time at Andromeda’s, when he knew he couldn’t be home. Moreover, Teddy wasn’t his exuberant naughty self around Marcus, making Harry choose between his child and his lover, and well, there was only one answer there, wasn’t there? Still, despite what an arsehole he seemed to be now –and Harry refused to believe he’d hated Harry that much, now, it
, too.
Harry stood up to help her in her robe. “If it is too much, use your phone, alright? I’ll come get him immediately”
’ below it, Ron’s wide scrawl stated ominously;
“Nothing wrong with wanting to make amends, is there?” she said pleasantly, and started unpacking the Muggle cooler. Harry was starting to fume. Why was no one taking his side? It was weird, Malfoy coming by.
Their meeting ended, and Jasmin smiled confidently when she left them. She was doing so well he wanted to introduce her to Lawrence: they would be formidable at pulling threads and finding out things. If only he wasn’t afraid he would corrupt her completely, he would’ve. But he could only deal with one nosey-parker in his personal life. If Jasmin ever got confident enough, he was quite sure no one’s secrets would be safe any longer, and that just wouldn’t do.
? If he could manage breakfast, he should be able to manage simple dinners, as well. He put the thought aside, and focuses again on the child besides him.
“Really? And you have no ulterior motives to dinner with me?! I find that hard to believe, after reading
“Of course not, dear!” she exclaimed, rattling the spoon in her cup. Seeing the look on Draco’s face, she winked at him saucily.
Rhododendron: Beware, I am dangerous
“Welcome to Spectral Sprouts, what can I –Malfoy?!” Upon seeing his new customer his welcome faltered. A silence fell, and he was sure he was gaping.
He set his tea down, and tapped a few appointments with his wand, so they’d show up highlighted and on Hermione’s personal planner. He proceeded to send a few memo’s to his undersecretaries, and then got up to visit their research department to check on their progress with regards to 'wizarding citizenship'. It was all part of their new project. Their main researcher was a young, bright Ravenclaw, just graduated from Hogwarts. She came highly recommended, and Draco secretly thought of her as a naïve, young Hermione. Strangely enough, Hermione didn’t like her would-be clone. Draco secretly thought it was because she didn’t like anyone competing with her own bookishness. Although he’d never dare say it out loud; that was what Ron was for, after all.
“It’s okay if you have questions or doubts. But don’t feel like you don’t know your friend, because he hasn’t explained his whole past to you.”
. He felt a blush spread over his cheeks, and hoped his beard hid it.
He’d lose this apartment too, if he lost his title, since it was purchased using the family vaults. He stupidly hadn’t thought to get his own vault, since it seemed superfluous at the time. As if he
Instantly he felt inadequate, just looking at the man. His throat closed up, and he put his cup down to keep mrs. Picklewilly from seeing his hands shaking.
“Will it affect his metamorphmagus abilities? He loves using them, you know”. Harry smiles a little bit, thinking of Teddy’s recent outrageous haircolours. The Healer smiled at him. It was rather attractive, even if he looked tired.
“It’s a working night for me anyway, mother. I need to guide Hermione to the right people. A date is superfluous.” He took a little cucumber sandwich, popping into his mouth. Lovely, that. The manor elves -freed, and rehired, of course, were rather excellent cooks. His mother raised an eyebrow.
“Yes, Malfoy. What do you want?”. He put down the pruning tools in his hands, lest he be tempted to stab Malfoy with them.
He bursts into tears, tea forgotten on the table, the photograph cradled to his chest.
it was that kind of conversation, then.
Blaise Zabini
Malfoy sits down for some semi-awkard tea with Harry. Neville has some wonderful news to share, which results in the inevitable fight between them. Although, maybe it's not the usual blond git, that is truly the enemy here.
In front of which stood an awkward looking Draco Malfoy, grocery bag in hand, frantically muttering to himself.
“Now, I wouldn’t normally discuss details with non-family present, but…?” he glanced at Harry, gesturing to Ron and Hermione. He nodded.
Malfoy steps forward rather forcefully, pushing Harry to the side and opening the door. “I reckon you need help getting out, Auror”. Marcus looks like he was just made to swallow something slimy, but stepped towards the now open door. “I would say it’s been a pleasure seeing you, but it really hasn’t.” he adds politely. Marcus tries to lash out again, this time using his fist, but Harry grabs his arm, his reflexes still fast. They lock eyes, blue meeting green. “I see how it is” Marcus spits at him. Harry doesn’t trust his voice. Marcus wrenches himself loose, and disappears through the door.
“At least you know me, and still want to be my friend” he whispers. He feels his eyes burning. Brighid hoots dolefully at him, and he strokes her feathers for a long time.
“Ehm, what news, mrs. Picklewilly?” he asked tentatively, although his stomach had dropped. He had given up his subscription to The Prophet years ago, because it would only put him in a bad mood, and he didn’t want to be grumpy around Teddy every single morning. Unfortunately, it also meant he had to find out things written about him when getting to the DMLE, and being stared at for reasons he didn’t know then, yet. While Mrs. Picklewilly wasn’t nearly as intimidating as being stared at by the entire Auror department, her shrill voice carried, and if she knew something, it was only a matter of time before the entirety of Diagon Alley knew.
“Couldn’t agree more. I’ve something else I need to ask you, too”.
“It is not funny, Potter”. Ah, he had called him by his name. Another point for Harry.
. He grumbled. He really needed to go. He couldn’t show weakness to the haters, couldn’t let the conservative sharks smell his distress.
As usual, I have no beta, so all mistakes are my own. Please point them out so they can die a silent and painless death.
“I think you should go, Malfoy. You see, we’re fine. Tell Hermione that.” Potter raised himself up, the neckline of his shoulder again falling off one shoulder.
“Ah yes, I remember you were truly
, of what bothered them, if they had an opinion on certain matters in society, getting his feelers out for things to use for their next campaign; a connection, a weak spot, a chance for lobbying. Today, when they saw him approach, some flurry ensued, papers put away before answering his greetings. He noted it, but chose to ignore it; it'd come out anyway. Tucked it away for Hermione, later.
It was go-time.
Harry grumbled. “forceful indeed” he muttered under his breath.
Draco nodded, but didn't laugh.
Victoire and Teddy had decided to play hide and seek in the house, keeping quiet so as not to wake Molly. Teddy was good at hiding; he had quickly learned to use his metamorph ability to blend into his surroundings, and loved stretching himself. Harry knew of this, and admired Teddy’s talent, encouraged it even. Then, Teddy had the clever idea to hide up in the Burrow’s old attic, the one that had housed the ghoul, above Ron’s bedroom. It turned out, the Ghoul had since left, and a new, more ominous resident had taken up space there. And it had found Teddy.
But indeed. He should go and rescue his own dignity from Lawrence sharp eyes, especially concerning his feelings towards Potter. With a nod, he left her sitting in her chintzy armchair to meet Lawrence on the street, flowers in hand, smiling like the cat that got the cream.
“Take a deep breath, now, come on sweetheart.” And Potter led Teddy through some deep breathing. Eventually, after several minutes, the curls turned brown again, and Teddy slumped against Potter. Frankly, Potter looked like crying too, stroking his godson’s back. Draco stood uselessly.
, Potter.”
Having put Teddy to bed after, he went down to sign up for the single-parent support group.
“Hello mister Draco” Teddy greets him politely, and moves back to let him enter. He steps through the front door and feels the flicker of wards when he’s admitted. Curious. Potter could’ve easily kept him out by locking the wards to him. “Hello, mister Teddy” he winks at the boy, who grins back.
Already dreading the carrot cake and what other odd plan she must have concocted, he followed her out and to the muggle bakery she so loved.
, they’d better be prepared to get burned.
“And?” Lawrence prodded.
“Why haven’t
“You’re absurd, Malfoy”
“Will there be a next time, then?” he asked. Did Draco imagine it, or did Potter look rather…curious at the prospect? Draco tapped his fingers on the table lightly.
“Hmmm. You might need a nap, Ted.” He murmured, much to Teddy’s displeasure.
“Well, you know this whole thing with Marcus and that stupid pillock he’s dating now,” Draco suppressed a sigh.
“Come see Teddy, Molly made three cakes! THREE!” she couldn’t seem to contain her baffled excitement and Teddy was pulled from Harry’s grasp, soot staining the rug in the living room. Molly bustled in, wearing an apron and her greying red hair a messy know upon her head. She smiled widely upon seeing them, and hugged Teddy on his way to the kitchen, wrangling him from Victoire and kissing him happy birthday.
, Slytherin as I am, waste my time on things that are useless frivolities?” he leaned in to Potter, bracing his forearms on the till. He was close enough now to get a whiff of Potters smell, and his nostrils flared. He smelled, for lack of a better word,
Yet a lot of his friends either had chosen to have children, or were well on their way. But then again, Melany had Parvati, to lean on, to share the burden. Granger had Weasley, who padded all her chairs and stacked her desk full of snacks. Neville had Hannah, who doted on him and made him feel secure.
“IN HERE!” came back, in Potters voice. Potter came out –dear Merlin, the beard was getting just as wild as his birdsnest of a hairdo. He had dirt above his eyebrow, and he looked a bit sweaty. No dark smudges underneath his eyes though; he looked rather healthy, for a change.
“But, Teddy, I’m
, he had no doubt.
“I did not speak with her long enough to pass judgement, mother”. He keeps his hands still, knowing how much his mother hates his restless fidgeting.
“That’s the one that really got you, is it?”. Potter rubbed his beard, failing to hide his grin.
“Is there any way to expedite the process?” he asks apprehensively.
“You know mrs. Picklewilly?”. He was nearly done binding the flowers together, but this little line of conversation was too interesting to let go of.
The door to the room they had taken Teddy into had closed, automatically warded, and soundproofed. He couldn’t even
He wonders if this was his life now: just always being tired, disappointed, and worried. He drags himself from out of the counter to help the witches, and then vows to make himself a strong cup of tea. No biscuits, of course, as Hannah was still recuperating. Not that he was hungry, after such a food-filled weekend. As he lets it steep, he muses about his time in the Aurors. Of course he was exhausted then, too. While Auroring was different from being a Hit-Wizard, there was still a fair amount of dueling and running down criminals involved, especially in the Dark Arts Crime department, of which he and Marcus had been part. At the same time, it had been exciting, and the hands-on approach had been satisfying. Yes, paperwork afterwards had been a drag, as had been investigations that didn’t seem to move forward. He’d never been all that patient, even if he’d gotten better at it taking care of Teddy.
. The whole blissful family life that I imagined you’d have with your very own redheaded Weasley”. Harry sighed. Of all people to ask him such a personal question, it had to be

Larkspur: fickleness
“No problem, Granger.” She smiles back, albeit a bit strained. He narrows his eyes.
“But how will concerned citizens contact your department?”  the Mailwizard questions, full of faux concern.
“Christ, stop it! Marcus, calm down.” He takes his arm, and drags him to the hallway. Teddy is standing at the top of the stairs, hidden by shadows, but Harry still knows it’s him. Kids were never as sneaky as they thought they were.
towards him while he murmured to them.
“Go, go!” gestured Potter, behind the flowers, and Neville was gone, Apparated in his apron, still clutching the little bird.
Malfoy snorted inelegantly. “If you would have paid any attention, Potter, I wanted to express my extreme disappointment in someone. Although it looks like I might have to buy you the same bouquet”.
“Eh, Malfoy?” Malfoy turned and looked at him again. “Are you

Leaving the reporters where they were, they went into the back, where Neville put the kettle on, and they settled down. It was much quieter in the back, between the more tropical plants, furthest from the storefront. Two cups of strong tea and a frankly disturbingly large piece of treacle tart later (Harry was suspicious of a plot to get him to eat sweets, if not other things), Nevillle and Harry had decided to put up a ward around the side of the shop to keep the noise from outside out, and a sort of screening around the doorpost for any and all recording material; Harry had thought of the Muggle anti-theft gates at stores, and modified a monitoring charm from his Auroring.
He works Harry open in  comfortable silence, only cut by Harry’s little gasps and the squelch of the lube. Draco loses his edge when he finally thrusts into Harry with a breathless, “fuck.”
And that’s how I end up spending the rest of my morning listening to Draco explain how Saining rituals actually precede Christianity and what they consist of. I have another round of toast and another coffee and happily concede that it does make sense that there was never time for a Saining for Teddy, and that Hermione would be the kind to just make people godparents without the fuss of a ceremony.
“Is this what you wanted, Potter? Is this what you came here for? You want me to keep you, I know. To use you whenever I want, isn’t that right? Your arsehole, your mouth, your prick. All mine. Like your orgasms. Mine. Mine to have, mine to control.”

cw: implied sexual content
I approach the net and look down, but can’t tell anything out of the ordinary from inspecting it. The usual, under the rippling water – bright shimmery scales. It gets increasingly obvious we can’t go on like this the further we go. I pull on the net once, then twice, three times. I am not weak, not by any means – you don’t really get a chance to be, in this life, but I can’t haul it, can’t even bring it slightly closer to the surface for a better look. Whatever is stuck in the net, it’s bigger and heavier than the loads of fish I’m used to pulling all day long.
“What about the Latin?”
Their tea is nearly cold at this point, and Hermione starts nibbling on some cucumber sticks she takes out of a plastic container. They tick off a few more items on their list –Hermione will go for the form fitting dress robes, after all-, and they make a plan on how to ply some more neutral Wizengamot members –Draco has already a list of flowers and little attentions planned-, and Hermione brings up the last syllabus modification.
I admit, I'm so tired that I am sure there will be mistakes in this one, more than in previous chapters. I apologize.
Neville had left just before noon to have lunch with Hannah, who was due in a matter of weeks, perhaps days. He had even trained their little owl to perch on Hannah's shoulder indefinitely, so that it could take off to find Neville at a moment's notice. It was hilarious, and adorable.
Beneath the thin veneer of anger he was hallow. It was like someone had extracted his insides with a large ice-cream scoup and misplaced them somewhere else. A pressing headache was growing at the back of his skull. Maybe it had all been stashed there, cramped in the back of his head: all his insides, his feelings, his horrible ability to care too fucking much about all of it. About his fucking starry ceiling and the peachy kitchen cabinets, a colour he had lamented endlessly and loved secretly. Fucking Muggle central heating, that made all the rooms equally comfortable without having to light fires. He would miss all of it. And where was he supposed to
one of them.
“So, you’re really cooking for Teddy?” he can’t resist asking, still disbelieving.
, hoping to see Potter and ask about his cousin, and be done with the matter. Instead, he had found Neville, who was feeling rather shaky. Turned out, Hannah had sent a truly ordinary owl to him asking him to pick up more flour for her continued baking efforts. Literally, false alarm. He had apparated home only to find an exasperated Hannah I the kitchen, who shrieked at him that he should read letters tied to Mildred first before overreacting and apparating all over the place. Neville however, had turned his pleading brown eyes to Draco, and asked him with a trembling voice whether he had heard if Harry and Teddy were alright. And, upon hearing that Draco had no idea, had asked “if you couldn’t go and find out” and “if anyone was good at finding out things, it would be him, wouldn’t it?”. Good
I will never understand it, but Draco takes less than ten minutes in the bathroom to shower and get ready and comes out looking like the most beautiful creature in the world. I could spend ten hours in there trying to get my hair to cooperate and I could never look like that. It’s infuriating, how beautiful he is. Just more proof I really am punching.
“Sorry, Malfoy,” he says. And then, still only a few inches away from Draco, “I thought you said you were tired after training. Didn’t think you’d be out.”
He stops along the way to say hello to a few people but otherwise, crosses the room straight in Draco’s direction, which is unusual. It’s no secret Draco and Harry are friends. It was speculated for a while, back in the day, when Draco first helped the Auror Department with a tricky potions case, but it died down surprisingly quickly. Draco was in good terms with most of the Gryffindors and it had all gotten rather easy once Blaise and Ginny got engaged. So Harry talking to Draco at a public event like this isn’t new, but it’s still weird to watch Harry make such an obvious beeline for him.

“Stop. You’ll hurt yourself,” Harry says, and pushes him back down. Gently,
Draco relishes in every gasp, every hum and every whine, but is surprised at how well Potter takes it all. Draco knows it has to sting like hell now, even when he slaps a little higher or a little lower from the swell of Potter’s round arse, but Potter only whines, the whole time through, thrusts forward against Draco’s legs and lets out the odd “fuck” or “Malfoy.”
I’ll start with my father. Make my way closer to Riddle.
even though you put in the paperwork for a year-long sabbatical.
“I don’t think… no matter how much wrong I’ve done, I don’t think we’d be here, if I hadn’t.”
Harry’s hand dives into the cotton tote bag, fishing for a little while, and brings out a box. He slides it over the table and Draco’s breath catches and he blinks very, very slowly.
“What is a kidnapping if not a non-consensual holiday?” Draco says, dismissively. And then, “I know, love. You did good, though. You’re so good, Harry.”
It’s as much of a blur as our own wedding. I’m starting to realise I’m just not good at big emotions, at these big moments in life. Maybe because they make me think of what could have been, of what has been lost, of those who never had a chance to be here for all of it. I wonder if I could have had this with Teddy. Teddy, who’s now taller than me.
If Adam — or was it Alan? Aiden? Arthur? — hadn’t placed the small pill on Draco’s tongue less than half an hour ago, or if Draco wasn’t on his fourth (fifth? sixth?) shot of tequila, things might have been different. But there’s the pull of recognition. The pull of being seen the way no one sees him. The pull of looking into Harry Potter’s bright green eyes is like looking into a mirror that sees darkness but still
“And now, the entirety of the DMLE thinks you have been kidnapped and are in fatal danger.”
Harry just wants to be loved.
And Draco would cry if he had the strength, he would say yes to all those plans and more, but he focuses on the feeling of Harry’s magic sinking into his body and he holds on, just like he was told to. He holds on, even if he doesn’t know exactly to what. And he thinks maybe he’ll get lucky again, and he’ll stop picturing himself dead like he’s been doing his whole life. Harry’s magic feels like love, like poetry, like cascading words of affection whispered into the space between his ribs, it feels like hope. And Draco holds on and thinks to himself, as loud as a thought can go, “I am
Draco knows all Harry isn’t saying.
Approximately ten minutes after the loud crack of Apparition echoes through the entire fifth-floor of the Ministry, breaking through all the wards, every single person in the DMLE knows these facts for sure: The Head Auror has been kidnapped.
Draco notices there’s still something at the bottom of the bag when Harry pulls out the square white box, but he doesn't say anything. Harry flips the top open on the box so Draco can look inside at the brightly iced cake that reads
She clears her throat at the threshold, nervous and most unlike herself, and all eyes are on her immediately. Harry flashes her a charming kind smile and says, “Mavis, my dear, is my husband using you as an errand boy now, getting you to fetch me? That’s too low, even for him, the lazy fucker.”
He does it a few times, all over Harry’s body, before he carefully flips it around and cuts a small line down Harry’s upper arm without blood.
Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen, it was more constant. It was the heavy burn of the Mark settling on his arm, it was the feeling of all his organs lighting up in pain and his bones breaking under Crucio after Crucio, it was the sounds of Nagini slithering outside his bedroom door at night, the sickening thud of death, the unsettling screaming, his aunt’s shrill nails-on-chalkboard voice, Greyback’s growls. A neverending chant of “I am dying, I am dying, I am dying, I am dying” inside his head.

Potter is stupid enough that he thinks it’s a genuine accident when Draco walks into his path and Potter has no time to stop himself from slamming face-first into Draco’s chest.
“Do you want to come?” He asks Harry, a little after.
And that’s what I’m looking forward to.
“Do you want my hand?”
He tells me to steer the boat away from the coast, and despite my best instincts I do as he says. This is it now. There’s no going back. For better or for worse, I’m at the mercy of the man they used to call Harry Potter.
