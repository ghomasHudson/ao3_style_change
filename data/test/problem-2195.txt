“I think—and hear me out on this, I know mum’s going to disagree—but I think we would be better off loading up on the cocktail hour and having a bit less for dinner.”
Malfoy laughed delightedly and said, “Do you know, I thought the same thing, but he seemed like a nice bloke otherwise, whereas I’ve a track record of being a judgmental arse, so I was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.”
“Well, I did say it was transcendent, didn’t I?” Malfoy’s lips quirked up and warmth exploded anew through Harry’s chest, and he laughed again, helpless.
… By Sunday, the grass was churned up and they were sun-pinkened and dusty from head to toe. Harry’s hair had reached unprecedented levels of dishevelment, while Draco’s was plastered to his face. The first year, Draco had insisted on retreating back to the tent to cast cleaning charms on himself but by now he leaned into it,
He tipped back in his chair as the third track started, stretching and sending a form flying into the memo box.
Sometimes Harry felt she lived to torment him—yet another way she reminded him of Draco. Draco was the reason they had Cassie in the first place. Last winter, he had come home from a grocery run with a dirty, terrified kitten in his arms, proclaiming
?” Draco sounded delighted; Harry shuddered to imagine the many ways he was planning to torment Pansy with this information.
The last Friday in August, about a month into Harry’s rotation, Malfoy mentioned a show that night—a local band, some university kids. Malfoy had played their CD a few times in the office; it was loud and aggressive, raw and unpolished. Harry didn’t think they would be making it big anytime soon, but he liked them well enough.
, and only Draco had known it was coming, so while the elderly witches in the back were dabbing their eyes with their handkerchiefs at Potter’s fervent declaration of commitment to extracurriculars for underprivileged children, Weasley had snorted half a flute of champagne out of his nose and Pansy had shrieked so loudly that she actually flung herself under the table in embarrassment.
Harry didn’t consider himself a particularly adept gift giver. On Draco’s birthday, he usually paid for everyone’s dinner and bought Draco drinks all night; if there was a good show coming up, he would get tickets for the two of them. Solid gifts, but not exactly anything to write home about. Gift giving was an art form, he knew, and not one that he excelled at. Draco, on the other hand, adored gifts and always managed to find something thoughtful and precise. Last year, Harry had been talking about upping the size on his gauges, and Draco had bought him the most stunning pair for his birthday, onyx with malachite fractals. They were simple, but the quality was exquisite, something he never would have splurged on himself. Draco had rolled his eyes when Harry said that and replied,
Harry scoffed. He stalked towards Draco and rounded the desk. He closed the laptop; taking it out of his hands and placing it behind him. He took a deep breath to settle his nerves. “I can explain.”
One morning, Ron pointed out how long Harry’s hair was getting, sending Hermione off on a rant about professionalism. She also said his new look needed to match his new wardrobe. That was the one thing Harry was not looking forward to. The last person to cut his hair had been his Aunt Petunia and that had not turned out well. Harry scowled at Ron, who mouthed “I’m sorry” back at Harry.
Harry began to walk Draco back towards his bed. “I don’t and I know you don’t either. You said it yourself, you love me. Now, can we please forget about tomorrow, just for tonight?”
. Hole lubed and prepped, Harry threw a leg over Draco and sunk down on his spit-slick cock. They moaned in unison and Harry leaned down to kiss Draco sweetly before starting to ride him. The whole bed rocked with their movements, the headboard hitting the wall with every slam of their hips.
Hermione was the first to notice the absence of their two charges. As she was drying tears of laughter, she glanced over at the table, now cleared of its contents by staff.
After Hogwarts, Harry had received multiple job offer letters, but only a few of them stood out to him. He had already replied to the Aurors with a “No, thank you.”
One night, after the town had gone quiet and Sheriff Dumbledore had wandered home, Harry decided he’d had enough. He had barely gotten to speak to Daisy and his patience was wearing thin. He waited for her outside the Inn, hidden in the shadows, until he heard the back door squeak and a dark figure emerged. He grabbed a thin wrist and pulled, but to his surprise it wasn’t Daisy at all. It was Malfoy.
Harry groaned and pushed up from the bed, then threw a pillow at Draco before pulling on a shirt. "I'm a bloody professional. I didn't attend the French Culinary Institute and struggle to become one of the country's premier pastry chefs just to be outdone by a crusty house-elf who spikes his biscuits!"
He turned just in time to catch an armful of Daisy, who had leapt from the stairs. She grabbed the back of Harry’s head and pulled him into a hard kiss, all sticky lips and hot breaths. They were startled apart by a shriek from somewhere inside the Inn, harsh breaths clouding the air around them.
He was down to his last three choices: pediatric medical school for St Mungo’s, Muggle Studies Professor at Hogwarts, and finally, the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects with Arthur Weasley.
Harry started to get out of his seat and Draco clamped a hand onto his arm with a scowl. In an instant, there was no trace left of the two lovers except a spinning coffee cup and a half-drunk tea.
Draco noticed Harry's pupils were blown wide and almost completely swallowed the bright green irises. He was startled into dropping his feet when Harry grabbed the chairs’ armrests and pulled. Harry sat himself down onto his desk and situated the chair between his legs, effectively trapping Draco with no escape. He looked up and a bolt of heat went through him at Harry self assured smirk.
Draco's hand was outstretched, waiting to shake Harry's. "That's all I get?" Harry cried, his body aching for more. "A bloody handshake?"
intrigued. Please explain to me why you were looking at kinky porn during work hours.” Draco had his feet up on the desk and was leaning back in Harry’s desk chair.
With a creak of the cupboard, Kreacher appeared next to the kitchen island. "I vanished them, Master Harry." He began mumbling about fresh cinnamon and tinned biscuits as he climbed back into his nest.
“Good,” Harry rested his head back on Draco’s shoulder, as the first seconds of the new year settled warm in his bones. “That’s what I’m counting on.”
Of course, Potter was completely, almost maddeningly comfortable in his body, inhabiting himself with such abandon and enthusiasm that Draco really wasn’t sure whether much instruction would be necessary, on his part. But eventually, he lifted his mouth from Potter’s neck to ask, softly, “What do you want to do?”
was my payment.” He waved over his shoulder and slid away into the night. Harry’s happiness overruled the impromptu kiss so he let out a whoop and ran for home.
Harry climbed off Draco and slid to the side, murmuring a cleaning spell. Draco rolled over and dropped a kiss on Harry's forehead.
Draco grabbed Harry's hand and dragged him towards the bedroom. The door slammed shut and a sleek arctic fox Patronus appeared to trot off towards Draco's work.
Voldemort called for a duel with Harry in 24 hours, High Noon the next day, in exchange for leaving his town alone. Harry knew this was his chance to take down his parents’ murderer, to avenge the fallen in this war. He knew his life was going to be cut short and he wasn’t going to waste his last moments with petty assurance. After spending the day with his adoptive family, the Weasleys, he ran to find Daisy. Using a disguise, he was able to sneak up to her room only to find her crying and alone.
Harry swore at the ceiling and sighed. "That was one time, ONE, and I only used the premade biscuits because I was exhausted and Draco wanted to try them." He smiled fondly at the memory of Draco jumping at the cans pop.
Draco’s thrusts became erratic and uneven. Harry came first, shouting Draco’s name. The clenching of Harry around Draco had him coming soon after, groaning with reverent pleasure.
That was Harry's cue to throw some taunts towards Kreacher because there would be no aphrodisiacs added to the cinnamon rolls this time. No magical cheats allowed.
"And finally," Mel announced, "they must each make three desserts that they think will be Draco's favourites. Any three sweets will qualify, as long as they fall into the parameters set above. Draco will be the final judge with Professor McGonagall's input, and whoever bakes his number one favourite will be the winner."
Daisy deflated and walked over to him. “I know Harry, but I cannot see any harm come to you. I love you, ya know.”
Shock permeated Draco’s face until anger and embarrassment took over. “Wh, wha, WHAT?! You knew the whole time?!”
Harry barely had time to slam his laptop shut before Draco caught him mid-research. “What is it this time Malfoy?” He tried to keep his tone as even as he could, but it still came out high-pitched and slightly breathless.
“Noooo. Don’t go. Stay here. Or run away. Don’t go to the Dark Load, he plans to kill you and go back on his word.”
Draco let out a little hum as he began to cut into each dessert. Minerva took a bite, but Harry had eyes only for Draco.
Since Harry was living at Grimmauld Place, he decided to stay there and spruce it up. Kreacher fought tooth and nail when Harry tried to remove the Black matriarch's portrait from the hallway, however once the painting was permanently covered and placed under a silencing spell, Kreacher was happy to help Harry tidy and redecorate the house. With the living space feeling a bit lighter and more comfortable, Harry decided to move onto the next task; his wardrobe.
Harry’s tiny smile of indulgence did not put Draco at ease. “That is not my name right now.” Harry held up a finger to stall Draco when he opened his mouth to answer. “Since this is our first session I’ll give you a second chance to be my good boy. Now, what color?”
“Now that’s something you will only dream about Weaslebee.” Draco winked at Ron who promptly gagged.
Draco let out a whimper as Harry’s words and magic swirled around him, leaving him naked and breathless. Silk ropes danced beautifully in the air before wrapping around Draco’s body, effectively restraining him in the chair; spread eagle and waiting.
"I think that beats a Hollywood Handshake any day," he heard Mel say as the door closed behind them. And Merlin, wasn't that the truth?
“You’re so fucking tight, pet. Uhhhh.” He bottomed out inside Draco and stopped to catch his breath before he exploded.
Her rage boiled at his stupidity and her face became an alarming shade of red. “Do not give me that! You should run, get as far away as possible. You don’t need to die.”
"Kreacher, you first, please," Mel said, and Kreacher snapped his fingers, the desserts disappearing from his table and onto the little table before Draco.
Harry was perhaps not the most observant man on the planet, far from it, but right now, he couldn't misinterpret the look Draco was giving him. “Um, I can buy you lunch...to make up for taking all morning. And maybe when you get off work, dinner too?”
He'd done it. It was four gruelling hours of sweat and mini-catastrophes, but Harry was nearly finished. He was putting the final dredges of cocoa over the top of the Tiramisu when Sue yelled, "Time's up! Step away from your cakes."
He heard the telltale sign of the Floo coming to life and immediately extinguished the connection, locking it for the night; he was not dealing with this right now. Harry left a trail of clothes behind him as he climbed the stairs for a hot shower, leftover flour dotting the floor.
kiss, I knew. And I knew you had reasons for presenting yourself this way, but I don’t care. I still want you, woman or man, doesn’t matter.”
Draco's face fell. "I told Pansy. I was grinning like a loon at work and she poked until I told her." Draco sighed. "I didn't realize she was going to tell everyone else."
Ron laughed heartily, loud enough for anyone to hear over the music blaring through the charmed speakers. He wrapped an arm around her, speaking into the crook of her neck with a grin on his face. He looked like he was about to kiss her, like he wanted to do more than just kiss her. "You need to let loose, Hermione. Have some fun, live a little, et cetera, et cetera."
"I'm going to stop you before the compliments you paid me are outweighed by the following insults." Draco shoved one bundle of the paperwork he was carrying into Harry's arms and then quickly bowed to the mirror, his voice sounding tight and a little higher pitched than normal. But when he passed Harry into the short corridor that led to the common room, he could see a light blush dusting the backs of the pale man's neck and ears. "I trust you too," is all he said before the mirror closed behind him. Harry didn't have time to squeeze through after he finally came to his senses.
Her eyes shifted from Harry's to Ron's, her lips pursing after a sip of her drink. "Well, you see Harry," she said, returning her cup to its saucer. "Ron was actually going to come over to mine this year."
"Wizarding families tend to pick a place and stay in it, as I'm sure you're aware," Draco began explaining. "The homes that wizards build have magic within them-- in their walls, in their foundations, in the land itself-- and over time, if lived in by a bloodline long enough, can grow sentient. They develop feelings and habits and such just as any other wizard would. And if a member of that family leaves or passes on, the house loses some of its magic."
Silence. Long and brutal silence-- with each second, Draco's fear for the poor house grew exponentially.
When he awoke, drool dripping onto his pillow, tie knot digging into his clavicle, the room was pitch black. Harry was panting hard and his heart was thumping as though he had just run a mile, and he wasn't sure why. Another nightmare, he presumed. Probably the same one he'd been having for a few months now, but could never seem to remember.
"As long as I'm with you, you can go anywhere you like," Harry shoved his hands in his pockets, looking at his feet while he walked. "Well, anywhere besides Knockturn Alley and places of the like."
"Potter." Standard greeting. Standard setting. The conversation didn't earn the strange looks from the two love birds that it received.
The people around the boys were dancing, pushing into them. It was nice, the contact with other people, though unintentional. Harry didn't touch other people— or get touched by other people— often, besides Hermione, and Ginny when they were a couple. Touching Ron was nice too, almost in the same way. But it felt nicer for some reason, more secure. Ron was strong, not like, body-builder level, but as fit as Harry was. And he smelled so damn good. Like pine, peppermint, and something distinctly... masculine. Harry leaned close to Ron's neck and breathed in deeply.
Suddenly, the trolley beneath Harry's grip hit a crack in the cement of Platform 9 3/4, causing it to jostle rather unpleasantly. Harry stumbled, and the cart ran over someone's heels. He heard a small yelp and the scuffing of shoes on the pavement.
"I'm just saying," The subject's eyes smiled behind his half-moon spectacles, "I only ever see you in between the hours of ten and three. When do you sleep?"
He was trying to make this difficult on purpose, wasn't he? "Grab your books. I need your help with something."
Both the elf and Harry turned to Draco, eyes wide in surprise. He’d commanded it so quietly, but the authority in his voice had not wavered. He looked at Kreacher unnerved, eyes half-lidded. The way he held his resolve filled the air with tension. Kreacher shied away from his gaze.
Harry woke up to snow on the third Saturday morning of December. It had been snowing lightly on and off for the first half of the month, but earlier that week, a blizzard finally hit, and the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were blanketed with a thick layer of the stuff. The windows in the busy hallways of the castle were frosted around the edges and there were snowdrifts halfway up the glass on the main floor. Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny navigated the packed halls with confidence, used to the yearly chaos of leaving for winter break. Ginny and Harry walked side by side, trunks and bags and Pigwidgeon’s cage towing behind them.
Potter rolled his eyes, head following their motion and lolling to the side. "And interrupt their 'couple time' together? Yeah, no thanks."
A small snicker is heard from the corner where the writing desk sat. Leaning against the side of it was a smug looking Kreacher. Draco shot him a look, but said nothing. The elf immediately stood to attention and bowed, mumbling quiet apologies.
Suddenly, there was a loud crack to his right, signalling the return of the house elf. Draco immediately breathed in the smell of black tea as Kreacher passed him a cup. "Thank you," he said, folding his long legs under him as well as he could in the narrow armchair. Kreacher bowed, then turned to fix Harry his cup.
"Yeah, but like, what about our rules?" Harry stared completely dumbfounded as Neville laughed at something Nott said.
He tried to focus on his surroundings to ground himself. Ron was snoring deeply and he could hear the breathing of who he assumed was Dean and Seamus as well. He propped himself up with his elbow, hissing at the pounding at the back of his head. He didn't feel very nauseous though, so he closed his curtains, tugged off his trousers and undid his tie and button up, and attempted to go back to sleep. But as soon as his head hit the pillow, he knew that wasn't going to happen. He allowed himself to lay there for a few minutes, praying for sleep to take him before he sighed and got up, deciding to get some tea from the kitchens. That's what he always did when he couldn't sleep, drank a cup or two of tea. It never got him to go back to sleep, but it did settle his nerves. So he tugged on some pajama bottoms and made his way out of the room. Since he wasn't used to the new layout, he tripped over a trunk and a pile of books next to Seamus' bed (or at least he assumed it was Seamus' bed... he couldn't tell in the dark.) on his way. Muttering a string of curse words under his breath he made it out into the hall. Holding his foot with one hand, he leaned against the cold, stone wall and cast a quick tempus.
"Book of Potions, if you must know." He saw Potter nod out of the corner of his eye. Eyeballing the page, skimming for anything relevant to long-term side effects, Draco sighed. He couldn't focus with the feeling of Potter's eyes on him. It felt dozens of spiders crawling under his skin. Draco felt his face flush as he let out a small "hmph" and brought the book back to his spot at the table. Tucking it into his book bag, he saw Potter watching him to his right.
That wasn't really an answer. Draco hummed, finishing the last translation on his problem set. "I take it that Granger will be helping you with the ward raising business, then?"
Dean leaned on Seamus' shoulder. "Parkinson decided to throw a little eighth year get-together tonight after curfew. Gonna be some drinks, apparently."
"Are you sure it can last till Christmas, Kreacher?" Potter looked stricken. Maybe he actually did care.
EDIT: Thank you for all the sweet comments and kudos. We broke 2000 hits within two days of this A/N-- that's absolutely wonderful, and certainly brightened my day. I love you all, and please stay safe this holiday season (Happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas, and Happy Kwanzaa-- and any other holidays you may celebrate <3).
"Kreacher believes so, but the magic will have to be stronger. Master Harry will have to enlist in the help of his friends or the Ministry of Magic to rework the wards after experiencing the grief and emptiness of late."
It was the kind of thing Draco typically said with malice, but to both him and Potter's surprise, it had a lot less bite to it than usual. Almost like, does he dare say it, a
"Hey, Chosen One," Pansy drawled, cleaning out a glass at the makeshift bar he was sitting at. Two dressers from one of the girls' dorms must have been Locomotor-ed into the common room and filled with most-definitely illegally conjured alcohol. Though Harry was too buzzed to care, if he was being honest.
“Surprisingly, not.” Harry frowned and turned back to Draco’s defence work. “Every time he talks about Hermione to me, it’s like he’s talking about being in love with my sister, you know? It’s just a little strange, is all. I don’t think I’ve gotten used to them dating yet, even though we lived together over the majority of the summer.”
After making sure the passage was properly concealed, Harry made his way to Malfoy's side in front of the mirror that was the door to their common room. Neither of them bowed to it, staring at their own reflections. It was strange seeing how different they both looked, especially how different they looked
They stepped into the foyer and Harry bounced a little on his feet as he walked. “We could take a trip to Diagon Alley, if that’d be helpful?”
So instead of allowing the nightmares to come, he drank Wideye potion constantly-- kept it in a flask on his hip. The effects have been mild since he started drinking it about two months ago. If he went too long without it, Draco got shaky and light headed, but it was nothing he couldn't handle. Draco's biggest issue was that he'd been building up a tolerance to it-- slow, but enough to where he's had to brew a stronger potion. Draco had heard of this sort of thing, read about the condition in some healer textbook in the Malfoy library. Potion Abuse, they called it. Draco knew that it could get bad, that he was slowly approaching the Point of No Return. But it was fine. He was fine. Draco could handle it for a little longer, a few more weeks and he'll have gone so long without having the nightmares that they'll just... disappear.
"It's alright." Draco Malfoy's voice was calm and steady, but his eyes gave him away. He seemed anxious, like his brain was in the midst of a fight-or-flight dilemma. He looked the way Harry felt all the time now.
for Crowley's sake; he wasn’t the man's keeper. It was not his job to intrude on personal affairs. Now, if Potter invited him to do so, that'd be a different story. But regardless, Draco knew he shouldn't take on more than he'd already agreed to. He had his own demons to battle. Taking on Harry's problems as well as his own would do more harm than good, and he had grown enough as a person to recognise that.
“Hullo, Harry,” Luna bowed her head slightly in greeting. Her short, curly hair bounced with the action. She’d cut it into a pixie cut at the beginning of summer, and it was now down to her chin. “Happy Christmas.”
Ron tsked back at his girlfriend. "You know that we don't start classes until eleven tomorrow, right?" He earned himself a displeased look from Hermione. He gave her a small, teasing smile. "That's plenty of time to drink some hangover cure and get on with it."
Draco chuckled. Harry shook his head and laughed along, the weight from the room dissipating with it.
Harry woke up late the next morning, hangover hitting him like a freight train. His head was pounding and he nearly vomited upon sitting up. But when he finally managed to stay in an upright for more than three seconds, he caught a glimpse of a vial of clear liquid sitting on his nightstand, labeled with a kraft paper tag reading "Pick Me Up Potion (H. Granger)". Harry downed the potion like a shot, desperate for the frog in his throat to be relieved and his headache to be cured. The potion took only a few seconds before Harry could feel it start to kick in. First, the stomach ache was gone, then the headache, and finally the potion got rid of his horrid morning breath, leaving his mouth minty fresh. Harry sighed; although the effects of last night's drinking were gone, Harry still had no want to go to classes, or even breakfast for that matter. He sat at the edge of his bed, eyes cast on the ground until a pair of olive stockinged feet appeared before him. Harry looked up to find a one Neville Longbottom, smiling, cheery as ever, even at seven o'clock in the morning.
"Alright." Potter's face revealed that he was a bit unsure of what Kreacher meant by "discuss it... with the house" but Draco kept his mouth shut.
Harry nodded. "I get that." Although their roommate assignments were the same as they were in Gryffindor, the rooms themselves were completely different. The walls were covered in a deep purple wallpaper with some kind of shiny, Victorian-esque pattern. The beds were stiff and felt like they were new— Harry missed the old, magically preserved mattresses that were stuffed with goose feathers and smelled of frankincense in the Gryffindor tower. Lying on the new bed felt like lying on a stranger's. "We'll get used to it, though," he said eventually.
“We will be owling you more information on resources in this time of need. You should receive the pamphlet by the time you arrive home, or by the time you return to your common room, if you are staying here for the holidays. Please do not hesitate to contact any of the staff if you are in need of anything. It is our number one priority to be here for our students, and we truly and deeply care about each and every one of you. We all hope you have a holiday break filled with love and whatever joy you manage to create with those you love. Thank you.”
Harry must have drank more than he thought, because he'd reached the giggly stage of drunkenness; the point where everyone and everything is utterly hilarious. He tittered at Ron, looking at him fondly. "'Kay, Ronny."
Alright, I think I've rambled enough about this! Again, I'm so sorry about NSWAS-- but who knows, maybe I'll pick it back up later. And until then, look forward to all of the new content I have coming! Sending love and well wishes.
Harry and the rest of the group sat down at the Gryffindor table, except for Luna, who drifted back to her spot at the Ravenclaw table. Draco, surprisingly enough, sat at his own house’s table, making idle small talk to a tired looking Blaise Zabini and a grinning Pansy Parkinson. He was dressed nicely, as always, with a maroon sweater over a white button up and beige chinos. He looked good, except for the eyebags under his eyes. Harry was growing evermore anxious about Draco’s lack of sleep, going so far as to consider alerting Madame Pomfrey about it. He wouldn’t, though. He could never betray Draco’s trust like that, especially since their relationship was so fragile to begin with.
"G'morning, Harry!" Neville greeted, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, as Harry drew back the curtains of his bed.
"Oh, no reason." He decided not to bring up his troubles with Grimmauld Place. He'd just have to spend some extra time in the library to figure out how in God's name he was going to save that house.
Hey everyone! I've missed writing so much. Please enjoy this new chapter, and make sure to read the end notes for some important updates and info. Thanks guys :)
There was something left unsaid, but Draco didn’t pry. Six years old? A six year old shouldn’t be let anywhere near an open range or knives, or even a practice cauldron for that matter. And to teach themself to cook… that was just outright child endangerment. But come to think of it, Draco had no idea of Harry’s family. He knew Harry’s mother and father had died, but besides that—
Hermione patted his arm gingerly and smiled, her own eyes misty. “We’ll always write to you, Hagrid.”
Draco had walked over to a framed painting on the wall and was viewing it with a strange look in his eye. “That would be lovely.”
She smiled at him, softer than before. "Thank you, Potter. But you are also drunk, and I'm on my way there, so I don't think it's quite fair to make judgments at this point."
It was sleeting in London. Harry loved the cold, but sleet was the worst. Hail, snow, and rain all in one? No thank you. He and Draco were lucky enough to be able to apparate to Grimmauld place, so they thankfully didn’t get too covered in the slush. Stomping off their boots, the two boys lugged their trunks into the foyer. They shrugged off their travelling cloaks with shivering hands, and as Malfoy took off his boots, Harry called for Kreacher to get a fire going in the lounge.
And finally, thanks for reading. Comments and suggestions are appreciated-- kudos as well; they let me know that you guys actually want more of this story, haha. I hope you enjoyed this new chapter. If you did, please keep an eye out for more of my content!
For one, it was increasingly obvious to Harry that he was, in fact, at one point or another, maybe a little bit obsessed with the git. He had the faintest memories of staying up until the break of dawn staring at the Marauder's Map, waiting for "MALFOY" to appear in tiny font, along with even tinier footsteps, revealing his exact location. He also remembered going down to the Quidditch Pitch in his invisibility cloak to watch him practice, and even following Malfoy back into his common room afterward to make sure he wasn't plotting or whatnot. But Harry had always told himself that he was doing it to protect his friends, his fellow students, his
"The only places I'm allowed to travel back and forth from are Hogwarts and my home-- and even then the Ministry tracks my every move." Draco pushed his shoulders back, refused to let go of his pride, even when there was so little of it left. "They see me as an ex-death eater, Potter. They aren't going to let me walk free just because wizard-kind's saviour asked politely."
Draco chuckled and continued on. “Things are probably not so cheery and perfect with the new couple as they seem. I’d just give them the time and space they need to figure out how this new dynamic is going to work.” He paused, picking up his quill to resume Harry’s runes work. “But if it’s really bothering you, Harry, I suggest you—” (Potter looks at him with wide eyes. It was rare that Draco called him by his first name. The blond pretended he didn’t notice the heat rising in his cheeks as he continued.) “—bring it up to them. Probably the Weasel first; He seems like he’d be more comfortable talking with you about his love life.”
He peeled his work gloves off and threw them on the bench with perhaps a little more force than was necessary, unstrapping his vision-magnifying headgear and smoothing his hands down the front of his robes.
“Oh just shut the fuck up,” Draco snarled, pushing him back down and straddling his hips. “I don’t want to hear another fucking word out of you.”
“Good. Ron made ziti. They grilled me about why I haven’t dated anyone since Meg… do you know it’s already been like a year and a half since I dated Meg?”
“It’s quite a good deal for you, Hermione,” Draco continued undeterred, “You and your future children will be well fed and cared for while you’re busy dragging our entire legal system into a new age of enlightenment.”
Harry couldn’t let Draco out of his sight. It was taking all of his self-control to stop himself from pushing Draco up against every nearby surface and snogging him senseless, so instead he found himself hovering by Draco’s side, enthusiastically shaking his colleagues’ hands and standing a bit too close so their shoulders brushed. He even brought Draco around to hobnob with the high-level bureaucrats he normally detested talking to. Draco, of course, charmed them utterly (and Harry saw how they wrinkled their noses when he first walked up, the utter twats), easily following even the most boring discussions of Ministry political minutiae, and being generally brilliant. Harry couldn’t stand it for long though, and he placed his hand on the small of Draco’s back, leading him over to a group of Aurors in the corner by the bar. It took Harry a few moments to realize that he hadn’t dropped his hand once they’d started talking, and he was just standing there, touching Draco in a way that was so familiar, almost possessive, and he clenched his jaw against a sudden spike of arousal and his fingers tightened involuntarily. He felt Draco tense, and then, slowly, he relaxed into Harry’s touch, and leaned
“Right,” he said, deflating further. ”Well then, this is a bit more awkward than I thought it’d be…”
Harry grinned. An enemy of Rita Skeeter’s was a friend of his. “Yeah, we’re queer,” he said, “just not with each other.”
Harry stared at him for a moment, then dropped his gaze and dragged it slowly back up to meet Draco’s. “You haven’t got anything to say to me? No
“Have we, though?” Asked Greg, passing a joint over to Harry, “Have either of you gotten a head up the other’s arse yet?”
shirt with a skinny black tie. The sleeves revealed most of Malfoy’s arms, baring the full sleeve of ink covering his left arm, tattooed tendrils of fire licking over all the exposed skin. The whole thing was an unfair assault on the senses, and Harry couldn’t be blamed for standing in the doorway gaping, until Malfoy looked up, frowned, and threw the scroll aside, straightening up (and he
, rolled up. And that was odd, since the December edition wasn’t supposed to come out until Christmas Day. As he unrolled it, a free scrap of parchment drifted down to the floor. He picked it up. Scrawled on it, in Harry’s truly horrendous handwriting, was a note:
“Happy?” Draco sniffed. “I thought so too. But after we all went out last weekend, I think he felt, I don’t know, threatened? It’s been building… He never was very comfortable around everyone. He said the way we interact with each other isn’t healthy. All of us, mind, not just you and me—I know everyone’s going to say he was jealous or something, but it wasn’t just that. He said everyone interfered with each other too much.” He scoffed, but it came out a bit wet sounding. “He was getting distant. It’d been going on for weeks, now. I think I wasn’t as fun for him, anymore, once I came with a whole life, wasn’t just—” he gestured at himself, chipped black fingernails, skinny jeans, “An edgy shag, you know.” He hiccoughed once and Harry caught his hand, squeezed.
Draco spat out a mouthful of beer. “Potter… did you just— are you planning to rickroll the audience?”
Harry took another step closer; they were close enough to touch now, but he didn’t reach out just yet.
Weasley what karaoke even was, had thus far refused to sing, getting steadily tipsier until Weasley serenaded her to the tune of
“All right then! I think that’s enough catching up for one day. Why don’t you get situated at your desk—” he gestured into the corner at a small, rickety thing, “And I’ll brief you on what we’ll be handling this week.”
“A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of,” Draco continued, earnest as anything, “You wouldn’t get this from any other guy.”
“Bastards,” Harry chuckled, nosing against the top of Draco’s head, “Lucky we’ve gotten so good at ignoring them.”
He handed it to an exasperated Glenlivet, poured himself another scotch—a double—swallowed it down, and crawled into bed. The next morning, he woke up that unfortunate combination of ravenous and nauseous. An owl he didn’t recognize swooped in with his morning post, dropped a scrap of parchment and swooped haughtily back out again. With a sinking feeling, Harry scrambled to unfold it. A single line of neat cursive stared at him:
“Oh, leave him alone!” Draco threw an arm around José’s shoulders, pressed a kiss to his cheekbone. “José is very health-conscious, you know, it’s probably why his skin looks better than all of yours.”
and turned down every opportunity to pull and by the end of it, all I could think about was bringing our takeaway back here and stuffing ourselves and getting stoned with our cats like a couple of old spinsters…” He looked earnestly at Harry, forehead creased with concern, “Harry, what if I’m
“You know,” Seamus whispered conspiratorially, “There’s one foolproof way you can ensure he gets laid tonight,” he waggled his eyebrows.
“In any case,” Neville plucked the joint from Draco’s fingers, “What we all really wanted was the dating. The sex stuff was,” he waved a hand, smoke trailing through his fingers, “secondary.”
“Not just you,” Draco exhaled slowly, “We’re getting older, you know, people are settling down or thinking about it—they think we should be thinking about it too, I suppose.”
out of his mouth. “And then you summon me here, play this frankly bizarre muggle joke on me that I don’t understand in the slightest, and then you proposition me?
When Malfoy emerged, Harry stared at him mutely for a couple of seconds before realizing that his mouth was hanging open. Then he had a slight panic.
“God,” Harry choked out, “Brave? I’ve just been an idiot who couldn’t see what was right in front of him. At least you have a whole—” he waved his free, pizza-holding hand haphazardly, “—narrative, whereas I’ve been stupid for years with no excuse—”
Walking next to Malfoy through muggle London, stoned out of his mind, Harry let their shoulders casually knock together. Everything Malfoy gave him made him feel so calm and easy, and Malfoy looked so peaceful in the hazy twilight, and Harry wanted to thank him, he wanted to touch him, maybe try to express how he was feeling, or try to hold Malfoy’s hand, or—wait, where
Draco turned back toward the sea of riotous, drunken faces, enthusiastically welcoming the prospect of a rousing rendition of Scrawny Muggle Ginger's greatest hit; Draco supposed they were all familiar with the prank. He faced Harry again and narrowed his eyes.
in a surprisingly velvety baritone, at which point she had gone scarlet and veered into spectacularly drunk, swaying precariously in her seat and burying her face in Weasley’s neck when he returned, looking more self-satisfied than anyone with that many freckles had a right to be.
Harry hummed and sat down, raking his hands through his hair and propping his elbows on the counter, resting his chin in his hands. He worked late so often that he had become used to watching Malfoy run through his closing routine. He liked it, watching Malfoy putter around the shop, straightening the merchandise and locking the cases, counting the coins in the register and setting the wards. There was something soothing about Malfoy’s languid movements, the way he hummed along with the music playing softly in the background, swaying as he worked. Malfoy seemed so at ease here in his little shop, so content, and the pride he took in his establishment was obvious in the careful way his long fingers handled everything he touched. Seeing it made Harry feel at ease too, content by proxy, and, if he was honest with himself, a little proud of Malfoy, although Harry didn’t have any right to feel that way. But it made him happy, nonetheless.
Harry’s skin tingled where Malfoy’s spells touched him. He wasn’t sure whether he even liked Malfoy, exactly. He was still sharp and prickly, standoffish, most of the time. He was nitpicky, always griping about Harry’s impatience and lack of finesse, shouldering him out of the way at a site to demonstrate how to disentangle the threads of a curse
Draco always was rebelling a little bit against his upbringing and he got a kind of savage pleasure from making the upper classes squirm when he stalked into a room in a perfectly-tailored suit, crisp accent falling from his pierced lips, thoughtfully perusing the wine list with his lacquered nails.
“Near death experience,” he gestured to Draco, “Causing you to realize the true extent of your feelings for him,” he gestured back at Harry, “Hospital bedside confession of love,” motioning at their clasped hands, “Classic stuff, really.”
The second weekend of December found him at his wits end, curled up on Ron and Hermione’s couch with his head resting in Hermione’s lap and Ron sitting on the floor in front of him.
, he said. The full experience eschewed healing charms as well, so Harry was sporting a vivid black eye from the pit at The Used, while the fair skin on Draco’s arms was blooming with faint purple bruises. They capped the weekend with Fall Out Boy at the main stage, shoving each other gleefully, singing their throats raw. Filthy, aching and exhausted, Harry looked up at Draco beside him—Draco, who was always beside him—and thought, not for the first time,
“You’re never going to give me up?” Draco asked, grinning like a madman, sliding the ring onto Harry’s shaking finger.
made it through that week, that I’d welcome an interruption to my work, so that you could have a laugh at my expense?”
Ron guffawed, “Bet you’re right mate. I mean, what Harry, other than Oliver you’ve only had that mystery wizard, right?” He frowned, “Is that what happened? Was he all weird about you being Harry Potter?”
am—” Luna sat up on her knees, swaying slightly. Hermione snorted. Ginny had put an underwater charm on Luna’s hair and the luminous strands swayed around her face like a hypnotizing, benevolent Medusa. “I think we’ve been granted a collective wish,” she pronounced, “It’s extremely rare, you know, and very powerful…” She peered around the circle, wide eyes like two huge full moons in her face, shining in the flickering pale light. “If we all wish the same thing, our wishes link up—the power of the communal intention runs through them to become greater than the sum of their parts.” A solemn nod. “The universe will manifest something truly remarkable.”
“I won’t be long,” he exhaled shakily. “You said— you wanted to suck me off or you wanted me to bend you over the desk—” Harry nodded, and Draco gritted his teeth, “Pick one.”
Harry laughed again, warmth bubbling up in his chest, “Leave off, Ron, it’s a holiday—can’t we get one night of peace from any of you?”
“Right,” Malfoy’s shoulders twitched with an abortive movement, a shudder harshly suppressed. He stepped back, unlatching the door. “Shall we?”
. He snapped his attention back halfway through Malfoy asking why Harry hadn’t been at the pub quiz and found himself saying, “I was breaking up with Oliver.” Malfoy’s brows knitted together for the briefest moment before he smoothed his face into something resembling placid concern, offering his apologies and well wishes, to which Harry simply replied, “It’s alright. He talked about quidditch too much.”
When Potter finished practicing, he threw all the parchment onto the floor and hauled Draco up over the arm of the sofa and knelt behind him and thanked him
. And Draco had brushed his thumb over Harry’s knuckles gently and said, soft, without looking away,
“You were brilliant, mate,” Seamus clapped him on the shoulder, his drink sloshing. “You looked like you were going to heave up at first, but you really pulled it together. I even cried a bit, you know…” he popped a deviled egg into his mouth.
“I’m sorry—” Malfoy cleared his throat, swaying back infinitesimally. “I’m sorry about the time I broke your nose.” He grimaced. “Least I could do, fixing you up this time.”
“How sure—” Draco paused, still so quiet, Harry could barely hear him. “I’ve worked so hard for this, to have you in my life, Harry, your friendship means—” he swallowed, “—it means more to me than anything. I can’t— I can’t lose you.”
came thudding through the speakers. Draco struck a pose, a hand on his hip thrown jauntily to the side, a sultry gaze turned on the assembled drunkards bobbing their heads to the beat. He took a deep breath in, and then—the music changed. The bar erupted in whoops and cheers. Draco whipped his head around to see Potter clutching the microphone stand as he swayed, mouth gaping open with soundless mirth.
Upstairs, they shrugged out of their pajamas, and Harry drew Draco down on top of him, kissing him sweetly and arching up into him. “Draco,” he breathed, “I want— if you want to— I want you to fuck me.”
“Look!” Luna’s voice cut across the moment, high and clear, “A star shower!” Twelve heads turned skyward,
Blaise arrived first, of course, sweeping imperiously through the floo, trousers pressed, shirt crisp. When José showed up a few minutes later, they settled instantly into the easy camaraderie of wealthy, tall, good-looking people recognizing an equal at the top of the food chain. It was Draco’s inheritance, too, and he could hold his own with them if he cared to, but it had long been clear that he didn’t quite fit there anymore. Once he had covered himself in tattoos, and pierced up his face, and worn ratty muggle clothes and smeary eyeliner, and spent his weekends brawling with strangers on beer-soaked concrete under thudding speakers—well, he had pretty decisively rejected his inheritance. One of Harry’s favorite things was watching Draco schmooze with the upper echelons at posh events. The dissonance between what he had been bred for and what he had chosen was stark and apparent and sparked a little fire in Harry’s chest every time.
“It certainly is… a situation,” Hermione smirked. “Honestly, I’m curious what he’ll be like outside the office. And you haven’t hexed each other’s bits off yet, which I truly thought was a possibility when you started with him. Maybe it’ll be alright? I mean, goodness knows you’ve taken a liking to this music of his, blasting it all hours of the day and night,” she rolled her eyes in mock irritation. “Just keep the focus on that. Don’t try to talk about anything else—in fact, you probably won’t need to talk much at all, since, you know, a band will be playing. Loudly.”
Draco would have thought that they all spent enough time in muggle clubs since the war to have at least a passing familiarity with the biggest hits, but Harry kept saying he didn’t know the words to any songs. They only settled it when Hermione waved a hand dismissively and said,
Harry looked over at Draco, huffing a disbelieving laugh, “We really cannot get a moment of peace, can we?”
“Merlin,” Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically, “What would be less offensive to the Savior’s tastes? The Spice Girls, perhaps?”
Draco pulled him into a hug, squeezed tight, said into his ear, “Yes, this is incredible, thank you so much.”
“Honestly, I’d thought the universe would be a little less cliché, but whatever works, I suppose,” he shrugged, leaning against the foot of Draco’s hospital bed.
Harry sat in the bed for a few moments, knees drawn up toward his chest, breathing heavily. He wasn’t embarrassed—he and Draco were far too good of friends for that. But he was a tiny bit unsettled, just by the shuddering intensity of what he had felt those few dense, dragged-out moments. He thought back to his last conversation with Ron, twisting his hands in the duvet. He had actually felt, for a brief, precious instant, that everything would be fine—good,
“They’re going through the honeymoon phase,” said Hermione, “Let them have their fun,” she elbowed Ron, grinning wickedly, “Don’t you remember what that’s like?”
He shook his head, reaching out to squeeze José’s forearm. “If you must know, we’re exceedingly happy together, and I certainly have not contemplated whether he is
” and Potter mouthed down the back of Draco’s neck and kept at it, slow and steady until Draco was hot and shivering, incoherent, pressing his face into the sheets and whimpering. And when he managed to form the word “please,” Potter breathed over the shell of his ear, “Could you come just like this? Just from my fingers?” Draco whined and nodded violently. “Fuck,” Potter groaned, drawing himself back upright. “I could too. I could come just watching myself do this to you.” Draco made a high-pitched sound and bucked back furiously. “But I won’t.” Potter withdrew and Draco gasped, writhing desperately. “I’m going to come inside you.” He added a third finger.
Harry looked over and shrugged. Draco returned the gesture, feigning nonchalance, as if he were indifferent to Rihanna, as if he hadn't been listening to
Harry looked around helplessly as a chorus of affirmative voices rang in his ears. “Come on!” He cried, “You lot are supposed to be our friends! You can’t do this to us!” He turned beseechingly to Draco giggling beside him, “What are you laughing at? They’re going to sic the— the power of the communal intention on us!”
They landed just inside the doorway of Draco’s flat—he’d thought it might be a bit presumptuous to apparate them directly into the bedroom—and Potter stumbled slightly. Draco steadied him, hands around Potter's biceps.
Harry tore into the sandwich, making an uninhibited noise of blissful gratitude at the hot pastrami, the spicy mustard and the chewy rye bread. Ron was going through a bit of a deli phase—he’d started curing his own meats and pickling various vegetables—Harry had no complaints.
“D’you see them staying together, though?” Neville pressed, and Harry had to take a very deep breath and sip on some water before he responded.
After, they dozed off and roused, showering together and dressing in pajamas—Harry had quite a collection of flannels that Draco was only too happy to snuggle into, and as he shrugged into a particularly cozy number, he popped his head out the top to see Harry looking at him with a dazed, silly smile, eyes shining in his face. Harry led Draco down to the kitchen, where he proceeded to make a full fry-up which they both dug into ravenously. They spent the afternoon under blankets on the couch, talking quietly and watching the snow fall outside, Harry occasionally reaching out to touch Draco’s face disbelievingly, Draco sometimes breaking out into giddy laughter for no reason at all.
“Alright, me next, me next,” Ginny demanded, sitting up and swiveling around to pin Harry with a fierce gaze, “I wish that you two would get your heads out of your arses and realize how perfect you are for each other.” She held up a bottle of champagne to toast and took a large swig straight from the lip.
Draco finished the article, then put it down, then re-read the whole thing slowly, then re-read the bits about himself twice more, then strode down the hall and flooed Pansy. She appeared immediately, wringing her hands.

“And?” She looked at him, wide-eyed, beseeching. “What do you think? Is it alright? Do I need to change anything?”
Just last week, he had been with Ron to the tailor for a robe fitting (they had brought Draco too, who was really the only useful one in that situation). And Harry had insisted that he and Draco handle all the wards themselves. The wedding would be outside at the Burrow, of course, and Harry and Draco would be spending an entire day warding the property, keying in every individual guest and keeping everyone else out. The media had been frothing at the mouth for years awaiting this wedding, and reporters were liable to be camped out along the borders, hoping to catch a glimpse of guests on their way in or out. Harry didn’t trust their privacy with anyone else. For Britain, this was the War Hero Wedding, but for him, it was the first two people he had ever felt truly at home with, making a home with each other. Once, he had said that to Ginny and Luna, quietly and a little tipsy, and Ginny had smacked him in the arm and said
“No, I just, I haven’t seen you in a while and I saw your door here and thought I’d say hi. That’s it, really…”
Draco came out after a couple of minutes, swaddled in his own robe, cheeks pink and hair damp. He pressed a hot mug of tea into Harry’s stiff fingers. Harry blew on it gratefully, letting the steam cloud his glasses. Draco bumped their shoulders together, and Harry leaned into his side. He didn’t need to say anything.
“Is this really a holiday?” José asked, frowning. They were sitting around the wrought-iron table on the back deck at Grimmauld with Greg and Neville, who had come over after work with some new strains in honor of the day.
Now, the late-night snacking round had commenced, and they had retreated outside to the stargazing dome Hermione had set up in the back garden. Like a soap bubble perched on the grass, clear and cozy, the shimmering, translucent shell kept the winter wind out and the body heat in. Pillows and blankets were strewn over the musty old rugs Harry and Ron had dragged out from the drawing room earlier that day. Hermione had woven light-pollution filters and vision acuity charms into the dome’s surface so that, like a reverse fishbowl, they could see out with perfect clarity—the night sky winked down as if they were in the farthest ranges of the highlands rather than the middle of London. Floating glass baubles filled with pale blue flames lit the space with a flickering, iridescent light, like they were underwater, or out among the stars. The air was hazy with smoke and buzzing with the languid, intimate chatter of the come down, the banked embers of a raucous party, riding out the tail end of the night in a tangled heap of limbs.
it—he whined again, louder, a shivery feeling bursting under his skin, the fog starting to clear from his mind and his muscles and then—his hips jerked, he rubbed up against Draco and god that was—wait a minute, what was happening?
Potter’s eyebrows flew up, “At your— No, Draco, it’s not meant like that, you’re supposed to laugh too— Oh bollocks, this is not turning out—” He stepped fully into the conference room and shut the door behind him, dropping his voice to a whisper, “I thought you might appreciate a
“Hermione mentioned that we’ve had an extremely stressful week in the Department, did she?” Potter nodded. “Therefore you thought, just when we’ve
At home, Harry went straight for the liquor cabinet, skipping dinner. He poured himself a tumbler of scotch, then another, then another. His head swam, and there was a dull ache growing behind his eyes. He sat at his desk and took out a quill and parchment.
), short-sleeve, white button-down shirts with little badges on the pockets, and equally tight black trousers with shiny boots and a belt equipped with various accoutrements, including what the package had assured him were real, functioning handcuffs. A cute young bartender had been eyeing him flirtatiously and giving him extremely generous pours, so by the time Harry was two drinks in he was already feeling a bit warm and fuzzy. He was chatting with Seamus and Lee, both of whom worked in Magical Games and Sports, when a sudden movement from the floo in the corner caught his eye. A tall, lean figure was unfolding gracefully and turning to survey the room—Harry’s jaw dropped. It was Draco. His hair had been charmed a bright, shimmering red-orange, with bits of the natural platinum showing at the tips, and it was slicked back on the sides and teased into a pompadour on top. His eyelids were painted like a sunset, and Harry was certain he was wearing blue mascara. He had glitter on his cheekbones, for Merlin’s sake, and a bright scarlet lightning bolt painted diagonally across his face, edged in electric blue. But that wasn’t even the worst of it. His lithe frame was swathed in a clingy jumpsuit of some shimmering silver fabric, with electric blue and scarlet pinstripes to match his face paint. It was almost cruel—the neckline was cut like a suit jacket, with a crisp lapel, leaving a deep V of torso exposed and—Harry gulped—there was glitter along his collarbones too, and down his sternum. Seamus and Lee’s voices faded into a distant buzz as his feet started moving across the room of their own accord.
“Ok, well there was a song on it, about having a best friend and thinking they weren’t right for you, but then realizing you might be maybe a little bit in love with them? And when I heard it, it kind of hit me, you know? Like I always thought love had to be this huge thing, that it would wallop me over the head and transform my life. It never occurred to me that love could be… everyday, that I might already have it. It didn’t seem possible that I wouldn’t have realized it.”
By the time Malfoy had swept the last surface and secured the blinds, Harry was starting to feel a pleasant tingling radiating from the base of his skull, down his spine, and out into his limbs. He blinked, looking at Malfoy across the shop with what he hoped was a normal, pleasant smile. He wanted to be smiling, since he felt fantastic and he wanted Malfoy to know that; but alas, he felt
Pansy rolled her eyes and went back to watching the most awkward, and, dare she say it, most adorable, first date she’d ever seen.
Harry’s house had become a safe place for most of his friends, and eventually, others began to show up. Even the Slytherins popped by once in a while. The day he saw Draco Malfoy on his front step, Harry almost slammed the door in his face out of surprise.
Upon apparating back to the flat, Harry had vanished their clothes. Draco had moaned and dug his nails into Harry’s shoulders, bracing himself for the inevitable assault on his neck. Harry lifted Draco and deposited him on the bed, peppering his body with kisses and bites.
He startled at a hand on his hip before he was pulled back into a hard twitching member. "Good morning love. Have a good dream?"
“Describing all the things I want you to do to me once we get back to your place? In great detail, I might add?
"Deal," Draco agreed, looking entirely too pleased with himself. As well he should, Harry supposed. He was going to have entertainment
“Well, that’s alright, then. Want a cuppa? It's cold outside and I owe you an apology as well.” Harry widened the door and gestured for Draco to enter.
Harry growled and shoved Draco’s arms back against the wall, pinning him there by his wrists. He stepped back to take a look at Draco’s face, but didn’t relinquish his grip. Harry spotted a mark on Draco’s cheek and another dark spot on his collar that looked suspiciously like lipstick. “Dammit Malfoy, you too? Why has everyone else had her, but I can't get near her? What good is being the Chosen One if I can’t even be with the one I love?”
Draco, whose eyes closed halfway in that way he did when Harry truly brought him pleasure. "Oh, Harry," he murmured, and Minerva cleared her throat.
He pulled on his jeans, his back to the bed so he couldn't see Draco's expression. The silence, though, was suspect. He whipped around.
“Ron’s right, Harry has no shame, but he’s usually well-behaved in public.” Hermione had a slight blush across her cheeks.
“Very good, pet.” Harry descended upon him like a vulture, devouring every inch of him until he had his fill. Harry swallowed his dick whole and deep throated him so thoroughly he thought he was going to pass out, tears leaking from his eyes.
Ron threw his hands up defensively, placating Harry. “Alright alright, don’t get your knickers in a twist. Just making sure you two don’t kill each other. It’s not often Malfoy yells my name.”
They eventually moved over to the couch to try out different positions. Now Harry was dick in hand and preparing to penetrate Draco when he stopped. “Color, Draco?”
They’d run into each other multiple times a year, somewhere around town - Diagon Alley Saloon, Hogsmeade Inn - but otherwise avoided each other. Every time they met it would come down to a duel: gun, fists, didn’t matter. One time it was a drinking contest. They were always competing, always trying to beat the other.
Harry shook his head firmly, “Oh no, I’ve got you in my house and I’m not letting you go until January, at least.”
Over a few more drinks, Potter shared his anxieties: the invasive nature of the press, the upending of his own expectations for his future, the fact that he had no idea how to go about living this new life, now. Potter had been with Weasley since the end of the War, and of course
Harry had told them he wanted to talk, and he knew they’d noticed how distracted he had been over the past few weeks, the itch under his skin. He took a deep breath.
“I mean it!” Blaise exclaimed, hand to his heart. “I need to know if his intentions are pure or if he’s only with you for that fine arse of yours.” He lifted an eyebrow at José across the table, who sputtered into his glass of water.
“To be fair, though, you never once thought that about yourself either, so maybe you’re not the best judge…” Ron smirked.
He was still standing like that a few minutes later, pretending to listen to Draco and Susan discuss the theoretical underpinnings of shield charms, when an inter-departmental memo descended, knocking Harry in the head. He unfolded it and groaned, bumping his forehead against Draco’s shoulder.
“Ok, it’s—” Harry ran a hand through his hair, “When Motion City Soundtrack put out their new album—”
“What about sixty-nine?” Seamus called out, snagging a champagne bottle from the air and taking a hearty swig.
Sometimes it felt unbelievable to Harry, that they had all ended up together, this motley crew of Gryffindors and Slytherins (and Luna). It had been he and Draco who brought everyone together; the others hadn’t really had a choice. At first, they had circled around the bruises and grudges, wary, wounded animals. But one night, Ginny looked Pansy straight in the eye and asked her why she had been such a fucking cunt. Everyone started screaming but somehow it ended in hysterical laughter all around. Nobody circled the bruises after that, they just poked at them, incessantly and mercilessly until they settled into the type of friendship where nothing was off-limits—a complete lack of healthy boundaries, Hermione said. Draco called it an understandable response to shared trauma. Now they were the poster children for post-war reconciliation. Seamus looked to be nodding off on Dean’s shoulder while Dean chatted with Blaise and Luna, and Ginny and Pansy were passing a bottle of champagne back and forth, shrieking with laughter about something Harry was sure he didn’t want to know. On his one side, of course, was Draco, and on the other was Ron, leaning back on his hands, long legs splayed out on the rug and bracketed around Hermione, tucked against his chest. She took a long drag on the joint she was holding and passed it up to Ron, fitting it between his lips as she exhaled a cloud of smoke around their heads.
Draco attempted an eye roll. “You’ve no idea how long I’ve been ready for this exact scenario, Potter.”
Harry clenched his teeth against a sudden panic welling up his throat. If he said Malfoy, he would have to tell them the whole story, there was no getting around it. Hermione would scold him, and he would feel even more terrible than he already did. But more than that, she would ask him
"Alright," Malfoy said, clearing his throat. "The ministry sent the paperwork we both need to fill out in order for me to stay with you during break, and I must say, it's--"
He drank to Harry, welcoming him into his home and breaking bread with him. To welcoming him into more than just his home. To walking him to class. To helping him with his Defence work. Knowing how he takes his tea. Sitting with him in the glow of the fire in the early hours of dawn. Asking him for advice and sharing the intimate details of his life with his formerly sworn enemy.
Potter smiled a little at that and sent a shrug Draco's way. The way they were sitting, interacting with each other, was familiar to Draco. The light bickering, the slow smiles Potter sent him, the now relaxed posture-- it was the same routine they'd had for the past few weeks. And for some reason, Draco could never get over one of Potter's famous half-smiles without feeling like he was about to burst into flames. Luna's voice filled his head as Draco tried to ignore the slight flush he felt coming on,
"I–I was talking to—" The train's whistle interrupted him, and Harry hadn't even gotten his trunk on board.
"And did you ever realise that the house was sentient?" Draco's voice wasn't brash, nor were his words filled with ill-intent. He simply wanted Potter to see things his way, the way any wizard with a basic understanding of magical homes would see things, and arguing with the boy certainly wasn't going to get him there. "Did you ever notice the house adjusting to your presence? Did you ever notice the small quirks that came with it, things you couldn't move or couldn't fix because it seemed like the house just wouldn't let you?"
"For the love of— Ron, get him to bed before he hurts himself." She was about to turn away when she hesitated. "Harry, just, please try to actually get some sleep tonight. I'll bring you some Hangover Cure in the morning."
He smiled wide, squinched up his eyes and nose and everything. The whole nine yards; the kind of smile he doesn't normally show. "Yup!"
Ron was smiling back at her. So he'd known and not even bothered to tell Harry. Neither of them had. Well that was just
Harry stepped away with a grin. As Ron and Hermione said their goodbyes, Harry felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned only to find a pale face with wide blue eyes smiling wistfully at him.
The air between them was still for a moment as the boys did their work. There was something so peaceful about working together in the light of day. It was a different kind of peace than the one they found in the early hours of dawn in front of the common room fireplace.
