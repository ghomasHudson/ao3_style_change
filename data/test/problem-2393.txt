T: She did, and I loved her. But I loved her as I would a sister, or a close friend. There is only one man who owns my heart, and I fear he hates me.
H: When you're back to get me out of here.
H: No, I made it happen.
He fiddled with the steak knife he'd grabbed from dinner, the pointed end breaking his skin.
"So Tom, what about Snape?" He was met with a raised eyebrow.
"Of course," he nodded, and after a few seconds had a small pot of whitish salve in his hand. Narcissa took it and applied it to the girls ear, wiping at the blood.
"Harry, you're okay, yes?"
He suddenly turned, and was faced with a rather large hole in the wall. The inside was rather damp, puddles of sewage water every few feet.
Narcissa took her, placing her across her lap and in her arms.
Harry nodded, and continued walking. There was many turns, and smaller tunnels. He was exploring for a good hour in the sewage system before he came to a door, old stone crumbling and covered in moss. A quick whispered open had the door rolling out of the way, to reveal a mostly empty room.
Harry snorted, "Oh, I am much more than extraordinary, professor."
H: I didn't run too far, I got bored and stopped. They got bored pretty quickly and left, but when we got back Uncle Vernon was mad I didn't let Dudley "play" with me.
The blonde boy seemed to physically mature in front of him. He shuffled away and squared his shoulders, sitting more elegant, and Harry couldn't help but notice how beautiful he was.
Harry and the rest of first year Slytherin's had a further thirty minutes until lunch. Harry and Draco wandered off from the group, to a set of mostly unused toilets (in Slytherin territory of course).
Before his eyes a scene unfolded; he was standing, holding Draco close to himself. Tom had one hand on his shoulder, and the other was interlocked with Severus'. To the left of Tom stood Bella, with a dark haired boy against her chest, his hair wild with black curls just like his mother, yet his eyes a vibrant blue. Harry quickly realised that it must be her son, he briefly wondered what the boys name was. Lucius and Narcissa stood close, and everyone looked overly happy.
Harry felt panic rising in his throat, when he saw Draco's plan devising above his head. Harry was glad he could trust Draco.
With shaking hands, he dipped his finger into her chest, walking to the mirror. He wrote the words out, and they dripped into the sink. Impressed with his work, he felt himself shudder with relief.
He sat up in his room, and got changed. Some black robes, quite similar to those of his head of house. He sat cross legged on his bed. He had two and a half hours.
"Dont worry, I'll talk to professor Snape and I'll get in contact with your daddy." Harry smiled, and Draco flushed even more, "Don't tell anyone I still call him that please?" He whispered, rubbing his eyes. "I won't. Now, onto the subject of Mr. Teddy." Harry said, and Draco nodded. "Is he at Hogwarts?" To that Draco shook his head, "I didn't want to be made fun of." Harry scooted up so he was sitting next to the boy, "Its okay, lots of the people in our house have comfort items. Some similar to yours, some a bit stranger, and some even more child like. Our house is full of diverse people, Draco. Having your teddy would be okay." Draco looked relived, and he nodded. "If you get in contact with my dad will you ask him to bring him?" He whispered on a meek voice, to which Harry nodded too. "Of course. Now, I can't bribe your father to stay Jere with you every night, but I think you'll be okay. And if you ever get too scared I'm always here." Draco nodded and laid down.
So after three slices of jam on toast, he plastered a smile on his face, "Hello!" He spoke with a light tone, setting himself beside Ron. The boy looked up slightly alarmed, mouth full of food.
It swung open, and Severus stood there, tall and brooding.
The lightbulb going of in the pudgy boys head was obvious, "Am- Am I?"
In the morning, Harry acted cheerful. He went to breakfast, but made an excuse of finding a new book he wanted to read. He once again entered his mind.
Harry was cooking a big English breakfast for his so-called family, Tom had informed him his letter should be arriving soon. Perhaps in a few weeks at the latest. The boy could barely contain his excitement.
H: What??! Why did you only tell me now??
"I will have contacted your parents by this afternoon, I will run by with the dates after dinner. Good day children."
Harry had done some thinking. He had overreacted, and really ought to say sorry, but was too prideful. Instead, he took off to find Percy. The students were due back soon, in a week's time.
The dummy was plain white, as adding colour to the cloth wasnt something Harry thought of doing.
Snape was astonished, and watched as Harry read the time, "Blimey, I think I best go to bed." The time read half one in the morning, and he nodded to them all, "Off to bed. Boys on the left girls on the right. Goodnight students." The professor received an array of replies and everyone was in their dorms.
Harry nodded and didn't turn to Draco until the door had closed behind Severus.
"I never had a motive for you." He countered and Draco gave him the famous death glare, his childlike face not removing any form threat.
"There's not loads, because we have to be careful for when our dorm mates come back, but it's something." Harry started unpacking the bags, all bar one, and let Draco have a push around.
"Now, the rest of the things, I think, are for you when you're small. Is that alright?" Harry sat the resized bags on the bed, and watched Draco eye them.
T: I'm unsure. I shall correlate with my other piece and see.
H: Morning Tom,
Tom snarled, once again, and stepped down. "Out of my sights. We will continue this later, young man."
"Of course! How?"
T: Oh lovely. You are aiming for Slytherin, correct? Because if you are Gryffindor I will not teach you of the Dark Arts any longer.
"So, you have a younger sister?" Harry asked, finally decided to start on the subject that had been the reason for this friendship.
Harry felt the panic begin to rise.
"I'm not sure, sir, he needed help finding you." The previously quiet boy spoke, tone respectful.
Fluffy was there, drooling. The two looked for clues, well, after they got over their shock. Harry was in awe of the oversized dog with three heads for a little while longer. Once Tom spotted the trap door the dog awoke.
Harry walker beside him, "Can I please have my hand back? I feel like the Draco in this situation."
Weasley, Ronald
H: How would I remove your soul from the book without damaging it, Tom?
H: ...
He had also acquired himself a snake. She was very beautiful, midnight scales with flecks of blue and purple. She was venomous, Harry knew that. She said her previous owner only wished too breed her so she bit him, he wasn't a speaker after all.
They ate a decent meal, and Draco got talking to his friends. He told that he was severely homesick, to explain his childish behaviour. They bought it.
"Worse how?"
Hopkins, Wayne
"I'm assuming Bill and Charlie are your older brothers?" At that Percy nodded, "They'd have to be interviewed first, made sure they weren't in on whatever your parents had going. Now, Karkoden as well, did your mother or father, ever hit you, berate you or purposefully make you feel unworthy?"
"Miss Ginny Molly Weasley, please come to the stand. You may also bring someone for comfort, not permitted to talk."
Harry smiled, "It's okay, darling. You don't need to put all of your daddy's friends on there. You said it was just family, yes? And thank you for putting me and Tom on there, sweetheart."
Tom hadn't mentioned it, and had ignored his questions when he asked for help when it came to it.
H: Yeah, that's him.
That shut the old man up, and Narcissa continued on with the testing. She handed both children small daggers, and placed glowing paper in front of them. "Now, slice the palms of your hand and dribble some blood on the parchment, exact measurements don't matter. Once you are finished, I have a potion to close your wounds."
Finnigan, Seamus
Soon enough Snape came around, handing out their timetables and Harry was anything but outraged, "All our classes with Gryffindor? Professor you're insane! Absolutely bonkers!" He exclaimed, standing, not noticing the feared looks the rest of the school gave him for speaking to Snape like that.
But he was so sweet, nobody would ever suspect him for anything.
(See the end of the chapter for
And so off Harry went, to de-weed the garden again.
he simply replied, hand shaking.
"She usually checks over the astronomy tower at two in the morning, but seeing as that is no longer your plan, she checks the bathrooms by the great hall at midnight."
"So, emotional abuse, yes?"
T: Yes, I believe so. We all thought your mother would be out of action for months after your birth and would want to stay with you, but with the help of my dear Severus she was up and running within a weeks time, it was in fact your father who stayed behind and looked after you. He brought you to a few meetings, and your mother dubbed it an annual time for everyone to play pass the baby. It was rather amusing. Although I must say Lucius looked more tired than the rest of us and we were running around setting villages on fire and such.
Harry nodded his acceptance, and soon the two were on their way.
The mentioned boy didn't look up, but hummed.
"I'm by the end of the stalls uh- behind them? I'm sorry." A tear rolled down his cheek, and he was extremely proud of his acting.
The Tom in the diary mentioned doing something else, like figuring out what was below Fluffy. Harry said he'd do it at some point.
T: You're being uncharacteristically kind. What are you doing? Who is it?
Inside the darkness, was a man chained to a chair. He was dashingly handsome, with slightly curled locks of chocolate brown hair and blazing red eyes, a sadistic smile on his face. He was gaunt, skinny and sweaty. His clothes hung loosely and his feet were bare. Despite this, Harry found himself weak at the knees.
They were informed that Karkoden would be brought in for a further conversation later, but that they were free to do as pleased while the evidence was viewed.
"No I didn't tell him your names - Oh! Harry has like weird magic. He like, knows everything about you by just looking at you for thirty seconds." Draco explained messily, nuzzling into his fathers robes. "Legilimens at such a young age?" Lucius asked, but this time Severus responded. "No, he knows every inch of my life more or less and I felt not one prod at my shields." He said, and Harry nearly laughed as all four of them looked at him with bewildered looks, "Its.. its a muggle thing." He sniggered. This talent he had, (he called this the Sherlock Holmes talent) he had since he could remember. This was something that bewildered Tom, and had dubbed him a rare type of Seer.
Severus was pale, "Let's go and see if I can make Harry better then, shall we?"
"No. We were in hiding, war and all that. She was born on the floor, and a healer came by the day after. Said she was fine."
Draco spluttered for a moment, "I don't believe you could be a cold blooded murderer. You always have a motive, for everything you do."
As for Harry? He just wanted to find out if Snape and Tom used to shag or not.
Tom shoved Harry down on the sofa, "What the fuck did you do?" He was practically shaking, and Harry was glad it was physically Quirrel and not the real thing. Tom only swore when he was seething, so Severus took a step back.
"That's a bit strange. How come you remember all this, anyway?" Harry was struggling to hide his smile. This was going perfectly.
Harry and Severus were soon back on school grounds, and Harry asked to have a chat with him. Severus agreed, and soon they were in his chambers having a spot of tea.
"Very well. We will have your information later today."
Harry, still exhausted, ended up being half carried by Severus. He noted the aurors guarding the bathroom, which woke him up completely, although he acted as if he was still tired. Severus sat him next to Percy, and Percy instantly pulled him close. It was clear to Harry that the prefect had already been told.
"It is impossible for you to sort a child from that distance." Dumbledore began, "Can you not feel the power radiating off the child? He is stronger than the Riddle boy!" The hat fought, Dumbledore motioned for the sorting to continue and he watched the boy with interest, as he puled a diary from his pocket and started writing. It was strange how he sectioned himself from the students, not daring to even go near them. There was something very, very strange about this boy.
H: No Sir,
Christmas had been uneventful. He only got Draco a present, but had left it at Hogwarts. A necklace holding an emerald. It was simple.
The professor snorted and crossed his hands, "We all did. He loved me too, once upon a time. Why are you asking?"
He was hugged until he couldn't breathe, and soon enough they were all called back into the court room.
Severus chuckled once again, and Harry decided that he liked the sound, "We are approaching mother care, and if one woman asks me when my child is due I will use your for potion ingredients."
"Try me, old man." Harry snarled, getting up. He was twitching at the fact that he couldn't see Tom's thoughts.
He got more grumbles but he also got a nod, and the two sat up.
Once in his dorm room and he had picked his bed, the overly smart boy changed quickly. When all the other boys were asleep, he heard quiet crying from Draco's bed. Harry instantly knew what it was and made his way to the blondes bed. "Hey Draco? Is it alright if I open the curtain?"
He had no idea where his girl was, but started by checking his dorm. Obviously she wasn't there.
Hagrid.
Draco explained he had a nightmare and got scared when he couldn't find Harry after a lot of coercion. Harry held him, and promised he wouldn't go anywhere without telling Draco first again. Soon they both nodded off to sleep, Draco with his thumb bobbing happily in his mouth.
Harry was a little teary eyed, "Well, they really told you everything, huh?" He received a nod, "And thank you for everything you said. I guess I never thought of it as family. Just.. people I cared about, I suppose."
"Right, well crap." Severus replied.
Tom, bewildered by the explanation, pulled Harry into his chest, Harry seized up even more before returning the warm embrace. "Tom?" He spoke into the cloth of the others cloak, before being let go. Tom cleared his throat and gave a rare smile, before deciding to walk back to Quirrels classroom. Harry followed closely.
Harry's sobbing became more audible, "I-I didn't mean to! W-wasnt my fault!"
"I'm stronger than you, don't get yourself into something you can't get out of."
He handed the book to Severus and walked across the room to spend time with Draco.
When their uneventful knock landed on the door, and Dudley rushed to open it, Harry felt a sudden urge to let his magic loose, so he did. It enclosed the whole house soon enough and everyone stood stock still, looking around for this unmanageable source.
"It does. I'm unsure of sleeping arrangements, but I believe I'm to go to Slytherin tower with you." Percy turned on his heel, once again, to the twins who stopped dead in their tracks.
H: Yes sir.
Harry and Draco, after eating their dinner, made their way back to Slytherin common room. Just after leaving the hall, though, they ran into a couple of redheads. Draco instantly tensed, and his grip on Harry's hand tightened.
Koden nodded, and Harry patted his knee, "Do you want me to come up?" And at his friends quick nod, they both walked up towards the stand, Harry standing as proud as the three adults previous.
Harrys head flicked up, and a twinkle was evident in his eye, "Would you help me kill someone? Also, what may I call you?"
H: When are you free? So we can assess the situation, I mean.
T: Oh right, apologies. Well, we were looking for him, hoping that at his whole eleven days of age he'd managed to escape, or that the aurors just dumped him. But to no avail. The bond was telling her that he was alive, but we just didn't know where. She could feel his pain, and we vowed to kill everyone who dared touch him.
Harry nodded, he would have to ask Tom of he knew anything like that later on.
T: No, you wouldn't. But we will find him, eventually.
Straw, as the crow was now called, was tucked up under Draco's other arm when he was informed it was bedtime.
S: Your son?
Lucius nodded, "Of course," He stopped himself abruptly and it was clear to Harry and Tom of the 'My Lord' that almost slipped out, "What is this other investigation you wish to launch?"
"Here he is!" Harry exclaimed, handing him over. "Would you like to be my friend?"
"Excuse me, Professor Binns?" The ghost turned to him with what Harry assumed was a smile. "Yes, dear boy?"
Harry nodded, "Is there a chance you could be adopted? I'm not trying to upset you- but Ginny had to be due term when she was both in order to survive, and that's impossible with you."
"Yeah well that was when I was trying to convince everyone I was an innocent child. Clearly, that didn't work." He huffed, shoving his hands in his pockets.
H: I know, but please?
But won't he take you from me? I don't want to loose you!
Now Narcissa looked, she could see the obvious signs. "Of course minister, I'll have her for as long as needed. I'll start on medical scans in Severus Snapes rooms."
Boot, Trevor
T: Severus?
However currently, all the children and adults were waiting in the potions masters quarters. Soon enough it would be time for the trial, and everyone besides Tom and Neville were going.
"Join Tom."
The two were seen walking down the hall, Draco clinging onto Harry for dear life and skipping slightly.
The two made their way to Slytherin common room, and jogged up to their dorm, slipping off their shoes and jumping onto Harrys bed. Snape stalked in a few seconds later, "What are you doing?" He asked, glaring, but it held no malice. "Draco here feels ill and I am companioning him in his recovery." He drawled, a smirk ghosting his lips as Draco lay down. Snape smirked, "Very well, however please try to attend at least one lesson today, and attend meals. My first period is free, would you like me to call your father or mother?" Severus asked, "Yes please, Sev." Draco said, his voice light, almost excited. "Come down to my office as soon as you can, its the portrait of the lilies down the hall to the right." He said, turning sharply on his heel.
"I'll leave you two to it. I'm going to do some extra potions work with professor Snape if you need me." Harry waved his goodbye, and Ron got a sour look on his face.
Once Harry was settled in his own bed, practically asleep, he felt slight movement around his feet. He peeked up, to see Belladonna.
"My name's Harry. Do you want to be friends?"
Thomas, Dean
Harry got his book back from a half asleep Draco and sighed, "We have dinner soon, kiddo. Nap for a bit then we have to go, okay?" Draco nodded and promptly passed out.
A few minutes later, three eleven year olds are dragging Percy in the room, looking alarmed.
H: He hit me and told me I was a freak. But I didn't even wince. I'm getting better, aren't I Tom?
"I'll be fine. I'm with a trusted adult, and we both know you could beat all of them in a fight at once."
A masterpiece, and a perfect heir, that's what.
"You aren't a normal Wizard. Bellatrix couldn't have children. Lady Magic granted her with a single child, you. You are incredibly strong. You are perhaps the only direct link from lady Magic since Merlin."
He was still in pain from his beating a few days ago, but hid it well. He had a barely noticeable limp and his grimace was hidden so well you couldn't tell it was there.
He quickly made it back to his shared dorm, just for a teary eyed Draco, clad in wet pants and holding a stuffed bear to pop up in front of him and grip onto him. Harry muttered a quick cleaning charm, just as a one off he reminded himself, and shuffled them both over to his bed assuming Draco's was wet.
Careful Harry, you're evil is showing.
"Do you want to go down there, professor?"
This is where stuff stops making sense. Welcome to the shitstorm that is my mind.
T: You are welcome. Now off with you!
Harry smiled wickedly, "Oh if only."
T: Why did you think I had such dates on my diary? For aesthetic?
He pulled out a small card, "This, mister Potter, is a Goblin Card. They work on Muggle cash machines, and are linked directly to your account. Some magical stores have machines you can use these on but not many, which is why we don't often advertise them. The Wizards who can afford them are generally not interested in the Muggle world."
Harry kissed the side of his head, "Anything for you, my sweet. Now," Harry reached across to the bedside table where Draco's dummy was, and handed it to him. "Why don't you sit here, hm? So I can talk to Severus."
He closed his book, and mentally noted to talk to him tomorrow, turning his attention back to a now sleeping Draco.
When Harry gently slipped his hand into Draco's, he was met with a smile and a slight squeeze from the other. He took this as a positive and laced their fingers.
"Well they are all family!" Hus voice lowered, "the death eaters, Harry." He piped up again, "they're all family! But maybe they can go on a different paper. I just draw Rabastan n Rudolphus."
Let me know how yall are liking this? Idk I still don't like this fic
H: Yes, father.
"There's a giant snake under the school. I made friends with him."
"Draco, love? I have something for you." The bright sparkling eyes looked up at him, and when he showed the dummy he broke out in a grin, his thumb dropping.
Rounding a corner, Harry spotted the tell tale Gryffindor cloak swishing around a corner, and he jogged to keep up.
He tiptoed towards the great hall, shaking. He wasn't sure if he was scared or excited, but slipped in before his professor. He situated himself by the drainage system, which was tucked away in a corner. He gently pulled the seal away, and whispered down the tunnel for Atlantes. Just as his head was at the entrance, Harry heard McGonagalls tell tale tapping of her shoes. She entered the bathroom, checking each stall.
They climbed into the dingy boat and Hagrid used his umbrella to make the boat go faster. Harry was confused, but let it go. They climbed onto a motorbike and whizzed off.
"Hiss stairs, and this will lead you out into a bathroom. To get back in hiss open."
H: Blood-boiling curse?
H: Fuck off
T: Good Boy. What did you do to make them stop?
He replied simply before adding,
H: Hey Tom? Belladonna mentioned large snake. Care to explain?
His letter came today. The 24th of July. He stuck it up his shirt and gave his uncle the rest of the letters before the old man banished him to his cupboard. Harry was ecstatic. He ripped it open, reading the contents quickly. He stuffed it under his pillow and opened his diary,
Harry noticed the man stare down the dark alley, the one he knew to be Knockturn. Tom had told him he would take him down there, but to never go without a heavily trusted adult. It was dangerous, especially for children.
"You know, despite you being the insane bit, you're still surprisingly like Tom. I feel like he exaggerated things. You don't seem that bad, and quite considerate."
He pulled Bellona out from under his oversized, ripped t-shirt and let her bathe in the sunlight, making small talk. She quickly fell asleep and Harry decided to talk to Tom, when a girl with bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth opened his compartment door,
Rivers, Oliver
T: What is your name?
Harry quickly decided he was never letting evil Tom loose in his mind, "But what was that, when you spoke in my head? Were you controlling me?"
He popped it into Draco's mouth, and cuddled him. "Now, I have some other things in my bag. You don't have to wear them if you don't want to, but I think they could help you. Do you want to see them?"
"What did you do to her?" Molly screeched, and Narcissa stared at her husband for help, right as Molly reached out to slap Narcissa.
H: I know, you've explained parseltongue before, remember?
D: Hello, I'm Draco Malfoy. I think you might've known my parents.
After an awkward encounter with a too stuttery professor Harry was in Diagon Ally. He was very Happy to say the least. They went to Gringotts to get money and the rest is history.
Harry nonchalantly flicked a page of his book, "Do what, darling?"
He can't take me away, I promise. You're stuck with me forever. You have to do as I say. Give me some magic in case I need to step in.
"Now now, I really don't think this is necessary. Do you honestly think-"
Narcissa sighed, "I suppose we'll have to go to the courts. But I promise all of you will go somewhere you want to be."
T: I have no idea my child, now isn't it about time you slept?
Severus stood up and back, momentarily reaching for his own wand, when a little cry was sounded out behind them.
"You are normal, Harry. The world's perceived notion of normal is not a correct one." He looked up, placing his book down, "I know you're struggling. We all are, and I know you can be a little mad sometimes," he shot up a silencing charm, and a strong one at that, "but I also know you're a caring boy. You act much too old, but I can't imagine what goes on in your head. You're full of love, but you're also traumatised. And well, also a little bit insane, but your family still love you. We are your family now, Harry. Things are hard, but know that I will stand by you. The Malfoys, Tom, Severus, me, Ginny and Kode, we all love you. Just warn me at least next time you plan on murdering someone, got it?"
He walked over, reaching for his wand, (which wasn't there- he had to remind himself he was in his own mind and not his body). Once he reached the darkness, it seemed to absorb him. Harry would be lying if he said he didn't panic for a small while.
T: Harry no. It a difficult curse and it could backfire on you. You have to mean in when you say it. Want to cause true pain.
H: Thank you, can you tell me more about magic?
"They told you?" Harry hissed, slightly put out, slumping behind the older boy.
For now, he just had to trust him, because he would never hurt him.
H: No, whats that? I'm five now.
Harry nodded, "Thank you, Tom. I've left some excess magic in here for you, grab it when you are weak. I won't give you any more."
The two dug in, Harry's dinner consisting of steak pie with mashed potatoes and carrots.
D: I'm probably gonna go sleep now. Bye, Mr. Riddle.
H: It was okay I suppose, boring.
"Yes."
You should kill someone else. I'm bored.
Severus looked up, anger slight on his face, "How do you know that?"
Harry lifted his chin and kissed the corner of his mouth, earning a grin.
And with that he shut the diary, pocketing it.
T: I shall try my best. Now sleep.
Harry clutched onto his professor, and by the time they had left, Harry decided he was most definitely never going alone, even once he was grown.
Harry huddled in closer, "Its a really special diary, okay? You know Lord Voldemort, don't you?" Draco nodded, "He's a bad man." Harry smiled, "Yes, well he might be a bad man, but this is him. He's stuck in this book. Well half of his soul is, the rest is just sort of scattered. Anyway, I'm trying to help him, and he teaches me things, that's why I'm so smart."
He nodded sharply, "That's the reason I'm chained. Before I was just trapped in the darkness. I used so much power doing that, that your mind protected one of us, I'm not sure which. Probably both. I can now do nothing. I could probably change a thought if it was already bad, but nothing more. I've chipped away at your sanity enough now, that you won't need as much nudging."
With a quick nod, all of the children finished their impromptu lunch.
"Ah, I do believe you are right. Draco does seem to love dear Harry, doesn't he?" You could hear Tom's smirk, and Narcissa did start laughing as Severus started bluffing.
"I understand." He stood and pulled Harry close, "I'm so sorry, darling."
"We want to know why Potter needed you. Anyway, what were you talking about? Why do you need to watch him?" The two switched with talking, and stood tall. Harry saw Percy weighing his options.
He then pulled the sweets out, and set them in a pile. Draco was handed a box of Muggle chocolate, and was eating it at an alarming rate.
"I think I'm gonna sleep now." He said with a yawn and Harry smiled, "Me too." He set his personal alarm and went to sleep. That night started the blooming of a most precious relationship, a one of a kind
He heard her click her tongue, "Really?" She turned the corner, and Harry wished he could of saved her face of surprise for the albums.
"A professor. Kill a professor. Make it look like an accident, and break wont go on too much longer." His eyes were dark, and downcast.
"Thank you Mr Black. You may go back to your seat."
He grabbed his work, but before leaving he spoke to the small snakes, "Anything?"
"I do! I thought daddy told you for when I came to school?" He held his arms up expectedly, and Severus lifted him onto his hip, "Your mother said you had stopped regressing as far and would be fine without me."
Lucius strode with power, and stood tall. At a nod, he recalled a story much similar to his wives, "I was not present during the initial meeting, as my wife was. After the incident I was called to Hogwarts to help with the situation, at which point my wife was conducting basic medical exams. Through their stay with us, both children have shown severe signs of abuse, with my nephew confiding in me. I am willing to show those memories in a private viewing, for the members of court only."
Severus sat beside him, "I won't ask questions, I'd just like to give you a look over, see of I can reduce any scarring," he spoke quietly, and Harry nodded.
"No. It needed to be something that would put the while school on hold, for a long while. Did you see how long it took for them to grab that troll? We barely had half an hour!"
S: I've missed you too
Harry nodded, "Yes, let's go find him, hm?" Harry grabbed Karkoden on his way out, lifting Draco onto his back. He was so glad Draco was small.
Harry didn't dare make a noise and did his best to not wriggle too much as whip after whip landed on his back painfully, mercilessly. He could feel the blood, but the pain was almost numb to him. He looked down as he blinked back tears and traced the words that were curved into his lower stomach. He'd screamed until his throat was raw when those were being put in place. Just a simple five letters, F R E A K, they held memories, the word and the carving. They were put in place about four months ago and his uncle was continuously reminding him of them.
The boy nodded, "So, what, we just go and check it out?" To which he receives and sort of backwards nod. He jumps up, "Alright then, let's go. Filch is on the seventh floor currently."
Meanwhile, back in the living room, Lucius was almost hysterical himself. "I don't know how I feel about my little boy becoming a homicidal maniac."
T: Harry, talking to snakes is a very special gift, you may be the only person in the world that can talk to them.
Nothing seemed out of place; nasty memories stored in locked jars and happier ones in book form on a shelf. He paced around, pieces of his life sorted about the room.
Harry nodded to that, "I sure as hell know that feeling. It's like, to my aunt and uncle my cousin can do no wrong but I'm the scum of the earth."
"I haven't heard of that spell yet, it isn't in the first year curriculum. Are you a first year? Oh, I'm Hermione Granger by the way." Harry felt like letting Bellona have a go at her, as she took the seat opposite him. "It is in the fourth year curriculum, I am a first year and the names Harry." He didn't feel like giving away his last name.
"Yes, please." He whispered, people staring. The professors glare didn't seem to ward them off.
"Need him?"
H: I should think.
Ron sobbed, and sobbed. It was too much. He had a family that loved him. He couldn't care less if they were death eaters or not.
T: You'll figure it out. Lunch ends in ten minutes, get your lover boy and devise a plan.
"No one is darling, but at the end of the day, he has chosen the many he wants to follow, even if it is years too early. I'm just wondering how long it will take for Harry to mark him, if he hasn't already." Narcissa spoke, subconsciously running her hand over her own mark.
H: Tom
Piers was coming also, and his mother was running late, much to the annoyance of Petunia. Harry was finding it quite funny.
It looked old, the stone walls crumbling. Part of the ceiling was leaking, and the same puddles of water were dotted about, amoung many bones.
With words of encouragement, the minister called Draco up.
"My name's Percy. And your hair is lovely too." He received a grin, and soon they were knocking on a big Oak door.
"How wasn't it your fault? That wasn't an accident, Harry."
Lucius finally decided to fill him in while Narcissa was calming the small girl, "When it was revealed that Karkoden was himself, Molly started screaming about Narcissa cheating the system. Both children started crying, so me and Narcissa stepped in as parents. Dumbledore got cautioned and Molly and Arthur got told to take Ginny home, but she freaked out. Molly tried to grab her but Narcissa stepped back, because she was carrying her, and then Molly tried to slap Narcissa, but cut Ginny's ear instead."
He turned his back so the man could purchase his beverage, and picked up an assortment for him and Draco. Soon, they left that store also.
Ron was getting mildly upset, "I suppose. Makes sense as to why they don't live me as much as everyone else. Why do you care, anyway?"
"When can I see daddy again?" Draco piped up, and Harry turned to him, "I'm not sure dear, I'll talk to professor Snape and see, okay?"
"Dumbledore, if you attempt to disrupt this procedure again I will take you to court on the base of perverting the course of justice."
"There is many ways in and out. She is sleeping in one of the drainage pipes." He hissed helpfully, and Harry searched around for her. He couldn't find her, and supposed she was in one of the higher up ones.
Narcissa casted some necessary scans, and thankfully it wasn't the worst abuse case she'd seen, but still considered abuse.
H: I already told you, I can make people hurt when they are mean to me.
"I think he was exaggerating some, he realised he fucked up and back tracked. Tom, that part of his mind was weak. As you said, it feels dead. There is no way it could of possessed Harry to murdering someone and leaving that message on the window, in her blood." Severus pointed out, and Tom nodded.
Both boys were grinning, and Percy finally asked about his little sister.
Harry still used a Muggle pen for Tom for convenience in situations like these.
H: That still weirds me out you know? Why would you even do that?
The snake circled him, "You did not disturb me, it has been decades since I've spoken to a human. I was under the impression Tom was deceased." The snake finally settled his head by Harry's side, and Harry sat down. Even the snakes nostrils were high above his head.
Severus stilled, "You've had contact with him?"
Hagrid bought Harry a snowy owl as a birthday present and he had encountered Draco Malfoy, how wonderful. He went to the Apothecary to get his potions ingredients, got his robes, books and finally his wand. The experience had been... one of a kind.
The trip to the apparition point was a quiet one, Harry surprisingly managing to keep up with Severus' long strides. The actual apparation did make Harry feel quite sick, and he had to grab onto the taller man to keep his balance. Severus let out what Harry could only assume to be a noise of concern, before helping him to stand upright. He cleared his throat, patted Harry's shoulder to which he received a bright smile and started his trek towards the bank, deeming the child well.
Goldstein, Anthony
"They're for Draco," he spoke, turning to look at more women's clothing. Severus nodded, and after he'd picked more things out, they walked towards the checkout.
And so, the three were soon in Severus' office. Draco was mostly zoned out after Severus had mentioned he would contact the Malfoys, fiddling with a handkerchief.
He wandered aimlessly for awhile, narrowly missing teachers such as Snape and Filch. He came across an abandoned classroom which held just a mirror. He ignored the inscription on the top and simply decided to stare into it. He could feel the magic pulsing.
Harry hugged back, still crying.
"Who are all these people, love?"
Draco, now a little less upset than earlier, decided that it was his absolute right to sit in Harry's lap and loudly whine when he got to engrossed in his book and stopped petting his head. Harry found it cute, and continued the petting and reading.
"That pleases me. Who should we kill? Our first duo murder." Harry turned his head to meet Draco, and Draco tuned his so they were nose to nose.
Percy nodded, and everyone relaxed, Narcissa casting basic diagnostic charms, getting similar results on Percy to Ginny, but more physical results on Koden.
"Sev'rus! Need your help,"
"Well I'll come back later. Which is the quickest way out?" He heard Atlantes move, and walked alongside him.
Harry, thinking quick, grabbed his wand and shot up the only protection spell he could remember over the Slytherin side of the class; praying it worked.
The minister nodded, and Narcissa turned and sped out, Lucius and Karkoden not far behind. Luckily, Lucius had managed to grab his wife's medical case.
The boy gasped, eyes watering, "Is.. is that why my mum and dad, uh, Alice and Frank were attacked?"
"Words are quite hard to cover over, because of their distinct shape. I can try, though. May I ask, what tool was used to create these scars?" He began working through his medical bag, pulling out various potions and salves.
"What's the plan, Voldy?" He asked, strutting into the black cloud. The man looked even more sickly.
Fudge looked at the Malfoys, "My apologies miss Malfoy, this is terribly unprofessional of me, but would you mind looking after Ginny? I believe Arthur needs to see a mind healer."
T: No
D: Really?
Ginny immediately looked up, bursting into a new bout of tears. Percy rushed and grabbed her from Narcissa, and he calmed her within five minutes.
"Do you want to know what I got you?" Harry murmured into the smallers' hair, to which he received a grumble, "You didn't have to buy me anything!"
After they were alone, he'd slowly get his answers.
Severus couldn't help but smile a little bit as he noticed the boys excitement, the little excited bounce he did as they entered the bank.
Most nodded towards her, and Harry plopped himself back down by Draco. The two chatted, but Harry felt the tension rising in the adults.
While Draco was sleeping, Harry decided to go for a shower. He gently moved himself from the small boys grip, standing up and stretching. He noted the boys unpadded bottom, but didn't want to risk waking him. He would deal with the wet bed sheets.
"No, they won't. But we'll get her out, and once she's better you can bet she'll never let you go again."
The boy didn't reply, curling in on himself.
Harry fell asleep with a fuzzy feeling in his stomach.
"Of cours, mister Evans. I have just finished my breakfast, would you prefer to talk in my office?"
Dudley made a beeline for the snake, a boa constrictor, that was happily sleeping. "Move you stupid thing!" Dudley screamed, banging on the glass, so hard it shattered, with a lot of help from Harrys magic, "Leave, quickly, you magnificent beast." Harry hissed to it as Dudley fell into the water, and off it went, hissing a "Thank you, young speaker." On his way out.
Harry's face was blank all through the speech and walk into the Great Hall, until the hat started to sing and he merely raised an eyebrow. The names were slowly called, and he stood patiently. Finally "Potter, Harry!" was called and people started whispering and craning their necks to look at him, Harry strolled to the stool, and sat with grace. The hat was about five centimetres from the top of his head when it yelled, rather abruptly, "SLYTHERIN!" The entire hall was in pure silence, "Alistair, I think you may need a check-up-" Dumbledore started, before he made eye contact ith the raven haired, green eyed boy, "You're right, he does," Harry turned to the hat, "You were too slow." He walked over to the table clad in green.
S: This is fine, perhaps some other time? I'm a little bit overwhelmed.
With everyone filing out to rejoin in half an hour, Percy stood hugging Lucius. It was a sight to see, and Lucius wouldn't usually show such a display of affection in public, but the boy clearly needed it.
H: Hi Tom.
The boy seized up, "You... You killed her." The shaky whisper fell into Harry's robes, and he was replied to with a kiss on the head, "It will all come to light soon, Draco. Hush."
Lucius nodded, and made a note on a small bit of parchment Severus had handed him.
"Until I need to no longer." Harry replied, and pulled Draco into a hug. "I'm sorry for upsetting you so," he kissed Draco's head,
Charlie was next, of course, with a similar instruction. He stood slightly nervous, "I was aware our mother was not the nicest at the best of times, but I was never subjected to any form of physical abuse. I am willing to supply memories of verbal abuse, and the ways she spoke about Ro-" he coughed a little, before continuing, "Pardon me, Karkoden." With a nod, he left the stand.
H: Sorry that I'm eleven, dad.
They made small talk, which neither boy nor man was used to, but it seemed to work. Harry was a child Severus didn't hate. He almost acted grown, without the snobbishness that came with it. He was a mix of child and adult that Severus could deal with.
When lunch was starting, the two boys took a little stroll towards the hall. Harry lead Draco the long way, just so he could marvel in his beauty for awhile longer.
Fudge nodded, and then called Harry up.
He didn't even offer the sofa. Nice.
"Nev, can I call you that?" At a nod of confirmation, he continued, "Trevor is a toad and he really needs a good life outside with lots of space. I'm sure he loves you, but being handled and indoors must be making him sad."
Draco went to the bathroom and then sat on Harry's bed to do homework with him. They spoke of minimal things, mostly just Draco asking questions and Harry jotting down bits in the weird book of his, or, his diary.
"She's lying! She obviously faked it! Charmed the knives!" The woman was shrilly screaming, and both children were crying at the commotion. Narcissa worked on calming them both, while Dumbledore and the minister were defusing the situation.
After they sat down, Harry grabbed his hand, "You did so well. I'm proud of you."
Harry gently shook Draco awake with a quiet,"Its time for dinner kiddo," to which the smaller boy rolled over with a yawn and sat up, "Kay, Harry." He mumbled and headed to the bathroom to clean up before the meal. Harry pocketed Tom and made a mental note to talk to him about the stone later.
The boys head snapped up after approximately three minutes, tears gathered in his eyes, "You mean?"
The small boy was still upset, even as Harry walked him into the bathroom, "Draco do I have to wash you like I do the little kids at my old school when they get cuts?" He warned at his new friends reluctant tone to get into the shower. He simply crossed his arms, "I'm assuming your father usually washes you?" He questioned a little softer to which he received nod. "And in the bath?" He added to which he received another nod.
Ron looked like he had been slapped. "Yeah. I know it. It- I'm not sure. It feels like it should give me butterflies, but it makes me feel sick at the same time."
But, unlike they expected, Severus replied, calmly, with, "I am afraid, Mister Evans, that this was not my doing. Professor Dumbledore required all Slytherins and Gryffindors be partnered up to sort house rivalry, and all Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs partner together because they could learn valuable lessons from one another." Harry turned sharply on his heel and stalked up to the head table, "Are you trying to kill your students old man?" He sneered, "All of you know each class will end in some sort of disaster, and there will be at least four people in the hospital wing a lesson." He said, his voice getting progressively louder and more threatening.
Tom, instantly calm, dropped to his knees to be at eye level, "I'm sorry for yelling love, who's in your head? Can you talk to me?"
After Harry and Neville had pulled away from the others, they found a secluded alcove away from the other students.
H: I've had an eventful morning. Have fun.
"Well, once Percy gets here, I plan on giving her a diagnostic scan, I can't do it with her on my lap. They Severus I'll need your help if anything is severe, but she shows signs of abuse. I'll need to talk to Kode as well, see if he was subjected to it as well or just Ginny." Narcissa finished, "Actually, do you have a quick salve for me to put on her ear? I don't want it to get infected."
Severus creaked open the dormitory door, Harry's snores evident from across the room. Severus gently set Draco down, and made his way to Harry. He was still shirtless, and Severus' heart plummeted. He hoped what he was hearing was wrong, but it wasn't. He just hoped it wasn't too late.
"Lucky guess. Finish your food, we only have ten minutes."
T: Oh by the way Harry, I split my soul a few years before I was killed, by you, and I keep in contact with my other pieces of soul.
Neville notably jumped, and stuttered out a reply, brushing hair from his forehead.
There it was - the nickname - again. Harry fell asleep with a smile on his lips and Bella wrapped around the diary in his grasp.
He ultimately decided he would, but was still nervous.
He avoided Filch, and within half an hour he was gently knocking on Quirrels door. It was opened, and he was welcomed inside. The turban fell and Harry was left face to face with his so called father.
Harry nodded once again, focusing on the chains length. They all lengthened, and the man stretched.
"Do you ever think I'll be able to be normal?"
The snake blinked, if you could call it that. "I killed a girl so he could put himself in that diary."
Severus nodded dumbly, "The scar is almost gone," Harry looked over a said his thanks, "You know where Tom is?"
T: You may.
Draco nodded, set his two friends and blanket down, before running to give Harry a hug. Much to the little boys surprise, Harry laid him down and reached beside his bed. He pulled out a nappy and other necessary items. Draco huffed a little, but otherwise let it happen.
"He didn't seem to think he needed to, no. Would you like me to request their acceptance?"
Harry nodded, "Sounds like a plan. Who?"
Once they were back in their dorm, Draco had flopped onto his bed and grabbed his dummy, two stuffed animals and blanket, before climbing into Harry's bed.
"What is that book, Harry?" The small boy asked softly, peeking over at it. "It's a diary." He said curtly, "Have you finished your essay yet?" He asked, snapping the book closed after he wrote something. "Uh, no." He mumbled, "Chop chop, back to it." Harry smiled, and pet Draco's head, as he finished his own essay.
Boot, Trevor
Harry bit his lip, when he came across an equation he couldn't answer, "The lizard saliva would cancel out the poppy seeds do the calming draught would have no effects at all, leading the consumer into a state of panic, unless... unless you added root of elder, but it would stop it barely, and the consumer would still be in a state of unsure panic, possibly boiling in a golden cauldron but that could counteract the wild mushrooms, turning the entire potion into a deadly poison." Harry mumbled to himself, growing more frustrated as he went. The other two looked at his strange,
"Stolen? Who would steal babies?" Ron was looking up again, wiping the tears off his face.
After Harry and Draco, along with the rest of their year, had grabbed their bags, they made their way down the twisting dungeon corridors to the front of the Potions classroom. Once they were let inside, and the Gryffindors were all late, besides the one Granger girl, Snape had deducted a total of thirty points from Gryffindor and had given that exact amount to Slytherin.
They all watched on as Narcissa walked with grace, leaving Ginny gripping Lucius.
The blonde nodded excitedly, and Harry leant down and grabbed one, with a pack of crayons, from under his bed. A quick charm later, and the book was floating in front of Draco's face. The charm was modified so Draco could turn the pages and draw in the book without accidentally pushing it away from himself.
Percy wrinkled his eyebrows, "Charlie would probably take the twins, and Bill might take Ginny at a push, but I don't know about me."
"I'm a horcrux?" Harry's knees did actually go weak, and he dropped to the floor.
He often asked Lucius if he could see his mother, but was always met with a negative response. He continued asking, although he was scared of Lucius a small bit, his want for love was stronger. Luckily the man was patient, and understood his want for his mother.
H: Everything.
The younger of the two, thinking quickly, shoved Tom behind the door and stepped out to the other side, making sure whoever was coming couldn't see him. Once they were close enough he realised it was Snape, and just as he went to push the door open, Harry stepped out in front of him.
When Harry's alarm went off three and a half hours after sleep he groaned and got up, cracking his bones and flattening his hair before walking over to the smallest of the dorms bed. His senses were over come with the stench of urine and Harry gently shook his new friend awake, "Come on Draco, you need to get cleaned up." The blonde blinked himself to the land of the living and sat up, sniffling. Before the water works could start, Harry hoisted Draco out of bed and called the elves to clean it.
He pulled the diary out, and maneuvering himself as to not wake Draco, began writing.
Three hours later, Harry was gently shaken awake. "Harry, we're all required in the great hall, come on." Severus whispered, helping the boy out his slippers and night gown on.
He looked at Dudley's watch, and just as it reached midnight he said: "Happy birthday Harry." Just as there was a loud banging on the door. Uncle Vernon came down, holding his rifle in is chubby hands. Then a man, (could he call him that?) Knocked down the heavy door, and came in holding a pink umbrella.
S: Of course I do. I never viewed us as apart.
Harry pulled out the strange book, standing on his knees as it was less painful. He opened the front cover and was tracing the date in the corner he hadn't noticed, "Mus' be a diary then," he guessed quietly, his voice shaking unevenly. Slowly, one by one, his tears cascaded down his already tear stained cheeks and onto the old paper.
"Yes, mister Potter. Thank you."
Harry was extremely grateful for this.
Draco looked unsure but nodded, "Can try?"
"I can confirm that Ronald Weasley is in fact, Bellatrix Blacks son." The minister announced, and that is what set Molly off.
The boy, now Zachariah, nodded. "Thank you."
T: What did you do about that, hm? Did you let them better you?
"Well then indeed. Now, stage your attack tonight. In the common room, by the entrance, there is snakes imprinted in the walls. Talk to them, and they will tell you her route. When she is somewhere more risky, say, a window, simply trip her out. Strategically place some rocks. The spell Mundet Tactus will destroy DNA. Don't get caught, and it will simply look as if she fell out of a window."
Crabbe, Vincent
Harry let him explore for a moment, before he noticed his fingers reaching for the closed packet of dummies. "Do you want one, sweetheart?"
Entwhistle, Kevin
"Well that one was created with a camping switch knife," he briefly looked over himself, "The others are a bit blurry, I dont remember much. A lot of them were probably done with a belt. The big patchy one on my left arm was hit bacon grease." Severus looked at it briefly, it was horribly discoloured and the skin was uneven.
Severus nodded, "The only rule is we must go on the trip before the other students return. I must request that we go sooner rather than later."
"Yes. They stole you from your cradle, and Bellatrix was already stricken with grief from loosing her own son, she didn't want that to happen to anyone else."
"Children," Narcissa spoke, "I'm going to pick some shopping up, I'll be no more than thirty minutes. Please dont make too large of a mess while I'm gone."
H: Tom
T: Ah is it young Draco again? He is quite sweet.
"What is it?" He snapped, looking up with dark eyes.
He looked like he was having an argument with himself, and Severus was a little worried. Before he could utter his concern, though, Harry snapped his head up to him, "I'm fine professor. Let's continue shopping."
Harry simply stood up, and dragged Draco into the bathroom to go toilet and brush his teeth before tucking him in. Draco spent the next two hours getting out of bed, and going over to Harry's bed, just to be out back in his own bed.
Severus quickly shook his head, "That is no place for you."
T: Oh?
There was a small break, Severus was simply smiling.
Corner, Michael
Nott, Theodore
"Draco? I have a few, ah, questions."
After stepping up, he spoke quickly, "I don't particularly know what allegations are being made against my mother. She always seemed perfect to me." His voice was full of confusion, and Molly half heartedly smiled at him. He was off the stand as quick as he was on.
Harry nodded, respectful of his superiors, but couldn't help a sarcastic, "Yes, my lord." As he walked past.
Harry was back in his seat quickly, and Tom calmed down.
Draco looked tired and he was shaking terribly. Harry had forbade him from gelling his hair back, as it can cause headaches and ruined his hair, so he looked a bit of a mess. Harry tried to help Draco as much as he could while still acting discreet. And Draco thanked him.
Percy nodded, a sad smile. "Well I'll make sure to tell them thank you. Is there any word from my older brothers?"
"This statement will be slightly different, as will Miss Weasleys, as these two children are younger, and the point of abuse. Mr Black, do you recall much from your younger years?"
The boy walked with pride, but Harry knew he was quaking in his rather small boots.
"There is no dark and light, Draco. The light is just as evil as us, but in different ways. I personally would benefit more from the dark side, and I despise the light side because of what Dumbledore did to Tom and me. There is murderers on both sides. At least all of my killings have a motive."
Draco let out a small smile, "Mother agreed that it was a good coping mechanism. She called it age regression, if that helps you understand any. So I only became small around my parents. Father was scared, when I came to Hogwarts. He thought I wouldn't cope, because I had never been in my correct mind for more than an afternoon, so I acted older and stronger for him. Mother never agreed with him coddling me anyway and she said Hogwarts would be my lesson. My way to grow up."
Harry cuddled up to him, in an attempt to make himself as inconspicuous as possible.
Soon they were sat in a small coffee shop, Harry with a hot chocolate and Severus with a black coffee. He had also shrunk all their bags down.
"I don't have to prove myself to you, boy." Tom snarled back, and it became clear to Severus and Lucius that they should probably evacuate.
"Is that your logic thing, then?" Harry seized up at the question;
"Oh Perce it was amazing. There was enough food for everyone, and we got presents!" Kode started blabbering, "Oh! And Uncle Lucius let me help him set up my mum's new room for when she gets back, so she can get better."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'll take you all out for ice cream after, okay?" Narcissa whispered as she was picking up the plates, and received multiple grins.
It was a growing possibility.
"Why, of course. She is around here somewhere. It is safe to look." The snake sounded almost posh, and Harry almost asked if Tom gave him etiquette lessons.
T: The Malfoy spawn?
"He'll give you extra lessons if you ask for it. He's quite a chill guy, but when there's thirty kids in one potions classroom, he's on high alert. Its a very dangerous situation. And if you give him attitude in class while he's trying to make sure you all survive, he'll be pissy with you out if class. He's a butt man, yes, but he's alright if you hold your tongue."
He could wonder later, right now he had a Snape to deal with.
"Yes. Please do not kill me. Tom has asked me to visit you, and I also am on a quest to find my young snake, Belladonna."
T: Its a school of magic, and you're only five? You're writing skills are amazing, although it does explain the less than adequate handwriting. I shall simplify my writing as much as possible.
The potions shop was the one they spent most time in, unsurprisingly. Severus shrunk both their belongings as they were leaving.
It was two hours of mostly nonsense before a ministry official came to grab Koden, and a further forty five minutes before he came back, red eyes and all.
Tom closed his eyes, mouth curling into a snarl. "I'm the bad bit. The insane bit. Of the soul, I mean. When you rebounded my curse, you split my previous soul, or what was left of it. You extracted the bad, but you could not control me once I had left. So I simply stuck onto you. I've been trapped here ever since."
T: No, you want to try out curses for giggles. It is dangerous, boy. I will practice them with you when you are older. We can kill those muggles together.
"I don't think Draco is, sir."
The four adults continued their conversation, and Harry laced his room, screaming some. He didn't have great control of his emotions.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded.
Harry grabbed an apple and ate the entire thing greedily, he had to eat the core also, hide the residue. Next was a cheese slice, before he couldn't stomach anymore. When he told Tom of this, he was quite mad.
Harry gaped, "Well then."
H: Since when have you cared about me going to bed on time?
Well, that was a long list. He could get rid of a few,
"We're going to be okay, Draco."
T: Oh, I do believe I have. Why didn't you tell me of this sooner?
He replied after a moment.
H: You mean you'll get me out of here?
Harry pulled his shirt off just as he was in front of the mirror, not taking much notice. He happened to glance at himself, and something peeking above his trouser line caught his eye. None of his scars bothered him, besides this one. Well, possibly the one on his forehead, but not in the same way this one did.
As soon as they were located, the four were going to head back to the castle, however Harry did notice a little chubby blonde boy, looking slightly lost.
"Harry?" The nervous boy asked, his toad struggling, "Do you... Do you think Trevor likes me?" He looked down, the frog eventually breaking free.
Harry was happy to hear that they got along, though. Karkoden was happy to help the younger two, and rather enjoyed playing the big brother role.
The two followed him in, and once safely shot inside, Harry shot up silencing wards.
A small voice in his head said, and Harry schooled his features. He felt his diary vibrating madly in his pocket, and could feel Quirrel-Toms anxiety and confusion through the door.
"I'm here to help you." Severus could already tell this situation was going to turn sour, but still, he kept his voice soft, but stern.
Harry nodded, reeling his magic back in slowly. "So, how do we kill ol' McGee?"
Harry nodded positively, "May I have one?"
H: Sorry I was too busy learning the history of our world.
"Dont you? I think you're too scared. Too scared to become evil." Harry tool a brave step forward.
H: They just took him? How is that allowed? Do you know what happened?
"While at your residence, how were Miss Weasley and Mister Black treated?"
Harry nodded. He had heard their names before, probably whilst talking to Tom.
"Ah, is there anything we could do, so Karkoden could see her? It's clear he wants to." Harry stared over at him for a moment before turning back to the adults.
H: I'm going to burn this book I swear to Merlin.
"Then I met you. I had never felt safe around anyone else while being small, and then you were there, and suddenly I was small in front of the entirety of Hogwarts." He finished with his head in his knees, that had been pulled up to his chest somewhere through his explanation.
"We may have to launch another investigation after this one. I still need to do some searching but alas, I don't believe I'm wrong." Harry's voice was hard, and slightly sultry. Or as sultry as it could be while he still had a reasonably high voice of a child.
"Hello beautiful, I'd wondered where you'd got to." He hissed quietly, bringing her up to his pillow.
He checked around the dungeons, getting unimaginably lost. Every corner looked the same.
"Why are you buying clothes much too big for you?" Severus asked, his tone low.
"Sir, I've had contact with him since I was five. Why do you think I'm so smart? Sure as hell didn't learn that from my relatives."
It was now December, and soon after the incident, Molly Weasley was charged with child neglect. She was sentenced to five years in Azkaban, although Lucius wanted her to go for more. Dumbledore got off unscathed, much to everyone's annoyance. Arthur was sadly still admitted to St. Mungos, and they were looking in to see who had been drugging him.
As they were walking down the street, a sickening voice sounded in his head, "Off for a little stroll with a filthy half-blood, are we?"
Draco, looking defeated, nodded, "I thought, maybe, we weren't on the dark side?"
We're finally getting somewhere, folks.
"How do you know that? This is Lord Voldemort, after all."
T: Well met Harry, for I am Tom Riddle, Although I would of assumed you would have realized.
Harry pulled his legs up onto his chair and crossed them. Tom raised a nonexistent eyebrow and started in his smooth tone, "Dumbledore has not told us much. We know he is hiding the stone, and he needs the professors help completing the traps. I doubt they will be too hard as he expects you to grow into your hero complex and take on the course."
After getting basics down, transfiguring cups and wash cloths, he looked over at Draco, and saw the thumb in his mouth and set on making a dummy from a cloth. It took about two hours, and his magic was exhausted afterward.
Neville looked up at Karkoden, and nodded, "It's nice to meet you all."
Harry shot up and pulled the blankets to cover his upper body, "What do you want?" His voice was shaking, and his shoulders trembling.
"Hi guys!" He grinned, "this is my new friend Neville, and his toad Trevor. Neville, you might know Percy, but this is Karkoden and Draco. They're my other friends."
However, he found he was unable to grasp it now he was awake. He glared at his sleeping snake, and grabbed his diary, muttering a quick lumos.
Harry was okay with that. And then, not shortly after that's when Harry started asking about the Dark Arts and if Tom would teach him about them. But Tom didn't want to corrupt the boy, at least not yet. Sometimes it was hard for the man, or diary, to remember that Harry was only six. But he had matured so much, and he would stand up for himself, hit the bullies back and do as he was told, but not let the Dursley's push him about.
Goldstein, Anthony
H: Yeah, some girls were crying because they got scared, it was quite hilarious.
"Is he your lover boy?" He was ignored, as were the rest of his questions.
T: That was accidental magic.
Harry turned to Draco, "Well, at least they know I'm insane."
Charlie and Bill were nearby, and Harry nodded. The twins were quite excited, but before they knew it, they were in a private court room, away from them.
"Nigh' 'Arry." The smaller murmured, practically asleep.
"It's not just Voldemort, making you kill, is it?"
Harry and Draco made their way to lunch, sitting down at Slytherin table. Harry nodded to Quirrel and Snape, before turning to his lunch, where he and Draco had salad and a sandwich, matched with pumpkin juice. The small chatter at the tables was overtaken by that of Gryffindor, but they were quickly ignored by Harry.
"It's fine. I knew you weren't light, I knew what I was getting myself into." He mumbled, gripping onto Harry.
"I was eaves dropping on my parents when Severus flooed them. Are you okay, though? Severus did say you were hysterical."
Alright, you prick.
Harry accepted, and Severus felt blown away; he was not a wealthy man and that was extortionate.
"I'm sorry to ask, but did she, or anyone else, ever touch you inappropriately?"
"Okay darling, would you like an activity book?"
Harry was quite proud of himself for fixing it up, and Draco was transfixed, completing a dot-to-dot.
Severus looked astounded, his brow still crinkled as the waitress brought their food. They spoke their gratitude and got back to conversation, on between bites.
The diary was like it was almost thinking, and Harry wondered if he spelt it right.
"So I'm just stuck with you telling me to kill people, then?" Harry was growing to enjoy this man's company- he usually took to calling him Voldemort. He was completely seperate from his Tom.
Karkoden Thomas Black shone in bright green light, a shining line if white leading to the Name Bellatrix Black, in the same white. Her family tree was glowing beneath her, faded.
Was the short reply he gave, wiping his eyes. The light was on again now too.
Harry didn't feel that much remorse for his parents, after all, he was five and thought they were worse than his aunt and uncle.
Harry pulled out two rings from his breast pocket, displaying them on the table. Severus' eyebrows shot up, taking in their appearance. They were plain black, but he could faintly see the engravings, and the magic seeping from them was obvious.
Severus turned sharply, "You are giving me the impression that you have seen mister Malfoy beneath his underclothes, and a deeply hope that your haven't. I may have to seperate you."
T: Oh yes. Surprise honey, I adopted a child.
Don't forget the spell.
Click
T: Is that sarcasm I sense? I have raised you well.
"You're too smart for you're own good, Draco. Tom has no idea it was planned, and I don't think he'd be too happy with me either. I needed a distraction."
"Come along, Ginny." Molly's tone was harsh, and the girl cried harder, "No! I don't want to!" She sounded almost hysterical, and turned her wet sad eyes too Narcissa, "Please don't make me go,"
"Well- not with my real mum, if that's what you mean. I remember being really little when Gin was born- but that's it. Mu-Molly wasn't overly nice for a while, mostly mean to me, things like, forgetting to feed me or locking the door when I was in the bathroom, but it got worse when I was about four."
"I'm unsure on which charges will fall on who, Dumbledore or Molly. So far we are looking at child neglect and possibly abuse if the evidence adds up, which Narcissa thinks it may because even if not physical abuse both children are clearly emotionally scarred." At this his wife nodded along before he continued, "Also kidnapping as Koden wasn't legally signed over, as well as the drugging of Arthur. Once an investigation has been launched I shall update you." It was clear he was talking to Harry, but everyone nodded.
H: Tom, I've spoken to Ron, (Bellatrix's child,) and heat crying now. Anyway, after he's stopped, what do I do?
T: It is very complicated, you know?
Harry shrugged, "Does the name Karkoden mean anything to you?"
S: Yes, Tom?
T: Please visit him some time, I don't believe he's seen anyone since about nineteen forty six.
"Do you want to hold my hand?" The man muttered, it was in a sarcastic tone but Harry knew it was a simple way to ask if he was alright.
T: That is a possibility. Good work, my child. Now, focus on a the other boys your age and see if you can suss out Bella's child. Neville's name would of been Zachariah before he was taken.
"What is it, Draco? I didnt think you still regressed this far." His tone was stern but not unkind.
H: Perhaps, because they blocked him like Bella's baby, that's why he's so bad at magic? They blocked him too.
H: He's not my lover boy!
"Mhm. Wake up time." He wiggled a little bit and Harry sat up, pulling back the covers and hopping out.
The light suddenly went off and Harry jumped, hearing many electrical bangs, and he dropped the book in his lap. That's when he heard it, the thump, thump, thump, of his uncles feet. He instinctively shoved the book under his cot and pretended to be sleeping.
"I have always been here, chipping at your mind. I was never strong, I would never be able to do anything unless you let me. I can change your thoughts, here and there. I can persuade you when you're in a bad mood. But I have little control over much."
Harry interrupted, "They killed her?"
Severus was all too glad to feed them. Percy didn't know everything, but he did know that Severus was working in league with Voldemort, and he thought that Harry contact with him too.
Luckily, Percy cane to his rescue. Sort of.
A few seconds later he popped back in however, "Also, make sure Draco has his teddy." And then he left again.
Harry shook his head, "There was a few times, when he was overly angry. My cousin never stopped, but all they really did was kick me, and cause bruising. He never caused me severe pain." Harry stiffened slightly, "Besides, right after Hagrid took me to Diagon Ally. He was really angry after that."
"Not sure you can. Once he's absorbed the rest of his soul, I suppose he might take me back. At the end of the day, you're only a little bit deranged with me here because you have your whole soul. He fears that if he takes me back, he'll go insane again." The man slumped back, but the craze in his eyes was evident.
Harry nearly collapsed, honestly. "You're Tom? As in, Lord Voldemort?"
Stop bothering me. I have to rest.
"Possibly. She had been deceased for about five months, so it's possible they did. We never checked her cause of death, because her parents just wanted to bury her. We left them to it. Although there is also a chance she escaped and froze to death. It was snowing at the time, and she was simply wearing a dress when she was taken. However, in my lesser followers, on my outer circle, I must say hundreds of children were taken. Every child who was even suspected of being a death eater than went to Hogwarts was never seen again. Slytherin house was only a quarter of what the other three houses were for about ten years. Younger children often disappeared from their beds, with their bodies showing up later. Any child over the age of two was killed. It is also the reason I have such a little following left; most people ended up killing themselves after their children were taken."
"That's okay." He nodded, and his voice was undeniably higher, which made Harry smile.
They sat in silence for a few moments, before Neville spoke up again, "That was Ron, wasnt it? Is it true that he's Bellatrix's real son?" His tone was tight, but curious.
Draco still looked solemn, so Harry sat behind him with his arms wrapped around the boys waist.
"Seven and a half months apart. She was born early or something."
"The dog - Fluffy - is Hagrids. He's meant to be protecting something but I couldn't see what. I need to pay a visit to Hagrid, I think." Tom nodded, slightly bewildered.
Harry, instantly knowing what the stakes were, nodded, "Come on Draco, let's go and find Percy. You know the nice boy who helped you find Severus?"
The Weasleys were all at breakfast, and Harry wasn't sure if it was a blessing or curse. He decided the easiest way to go about this was to put on a big smile and go to introduce himself. Apologize for his behaviour on the train, and start talking to him.
"I'm a death eater child." He gasped out, choking on his tears.
Harry slumped, he had his answer so he supposed he had to answer his professors.
Harry had took in his options, and ultimately decided he'd like to work alongside Lord Voldemort, but had no wish to become a Death Eater. That when Tom told his with slight relief he was on the Dark side, too. And in fact the one and only Voldemort.
But instead of ushering Draco or himself into a stall, he slid down onto the pristine floor. Draco naturally sat next to him and rested his head on the tallers shoulder.
T: If you say so. Now sleep you insufferable brat.
The two looked around, and Harry asked if they could pop into a little clothes shop. He didn't care for the name, but Severus agreed. Harry grabbed some things for himself. Resizing his pyjamas and wearing his uniform even on the weekends was getting old.
She made quick work of flooing everyone back, sending them in pairs. No need for any accidents.
"Someone who will cause an uproar, but not keep classes cancelled for much longer. Even I want you to get Zachariah in with the rest of you death eater children."
Voldemorts eyes seemed ever redder, and glazed over. "McGonagall. Get rid of her, and I'll be fulfilled. I'll even help you with things he won't."
"That would be a good idea. We can do that, yeah?" And they both nodded, Neville loosening his grip, and Trevor happily hopped away.
H: How the fuck am I supposed to get to you after curfew? Merlin.
"Oh no darling, you don't have to be sorry, come here," Harry dropped his wand and the blankets, holding his arms out for Draco. Severus could see the full extent of his injuries, and he was blown away.
"What did she do? Was she too Muggle? Did she get an answer correct that you didn't? Those arent things you murder someone for, Harry!"
The man rose an eyebrow, "I do wonder how you know all these things about me, mister Evans."
Just as Narcissa stepped through with Ginny, Draco grabbed Harry's collar, tearing him off the seat. His cup clattered to the ground, smashing.
T: Let's not discuss my sanity, child. We should be free tonight after curfew.
There was a blanket with a stuffed crow, a handful of dummies, a sippy cup and a baby bottle, as well as a few activity books with crayons and pencils. Draco looked around in excitement, quickly grabbing the blanket and rubbing it against his face.
He added as an after thought.
"You fucking owe me one, big time." Draco growled, "How did I do, though? I hope I didn't fuck anything up."
T: Sleep well young one.
Harry sighed and looked between the little boy on his lap and the concerned professor at the foot of his bed, "Yes, I'll let Severus help me, love."
Harry used to deal with the smaller kids at school, he was only mean to the people that were mean to him, and he liked children anyway. And right now Draco was reminding him of a very fragile three year old. He cautiously pulled the smaller boy into his chest, and stroked his hair, "Its alright, come on, let's get you out of those wet pants. They gotta be itchy huh?" Draco nodded still crying and Harry pulled his boxers and pyjama pants down in one. He lifted the now naked boy out of them and into the shower, which was charmed to be the perfect temperature.
Severus inspected them, "Why do you have two pairs?"
A little ways down the hall, he bumped into a perfect. Draco knew his face, it was just a little blurry, "Malfoy? Why are you out?" The older boy asked, he had curly red hair, and his face looked a little pinched. Draco almost asked if he had to go potty.
"Yes I do, Dumbledore. Children, please present your hands."
Percy's ears went red for a second, "Uhm, she still wets the bed, so-" Narcissa chuckled, and waved her wand, "I've dispelled the contents. She'll be fine."
Harry brought Ron up into the Slytherin dorms, and sat at his desk. "Neville is Rabastan LeStranges son, I'm not sure of his mother. His real name is Zachariah. I am biologically James and Lily's son, but have been, ah, adopted."
Harry sighed softly before looking up at four worried faces, "I have business to attend to, but I shall be back soon." He says politely, bowing and turning for the door, when Draco said, his voice concerned, "Will you be safe?" And without looking back Harry drawled with a smirk, "Safe? What does that mean?" And he whisked out the door, following the weak link that was Tom Riddle's magic to Quirrels classroom.
"Do you,"
"Yes professor, I greatly appreciate it."
The minister ordered Molly to be cautioned, too, and Arther did nothing to help.
Once Draco was clean and dry, he sat up and Harry made quick work of getting him dressed and brushing his hair. Harry quickly did the same for himself while Draco played, the once forgotten rings jingling in his pocket.
T: Oh so he is, then? Make me beautiful grandchildren.
Harry got his book back, and Binns declared the end of class thirty minutes early.
"Why didn't you talk to me sooner? I've had the diary since I was five, I've known about you that long!" Harry felt himself getting angry and quickly calmed himself.
"Uh, w-well, she uh, she wasn't nice. She'd yell and throw and hit me. Her nails scratched me a lot." Narcissa gave a comforting squeeze, "I dont- I didn't have nice clothes, and I didn't know how to clean myself. She'd yell at me for not doing things that she never taught me how to do."
Draco grinned and nodded, scooting off the bed, to grab his friend as Harry repacked the bags and shoved them under his bed.
"But why did someone have to die? If the troll didn't kill her, why couldn't you just blow up part of the castle or something?"
"We can talk about that during Dumbledores trial. Is that all?" Harry could feel Tom's anger, and sometimes feelings transcended.
A member of staff, and Harrys aunt were fussing over Dudley, while his uncle and a different member of staff were fighting, or discussing in a loud, angered manor, over who was at fault. And how much Vernon would have to pay.
Harry fell into an angry sleep. He had left Tom and Bell in his cupboard, not realising they were going so far. He hoped he got to retrieve them.
The yelling ceased, and Dumbledore was cautioned. Molly and Arthur were given a warning and told to go home.
"Oh, just since three this morning, then?" He said, a smirk playing at his lips. "Nah I'm just messing with you." He chuckled, almost a rumble. "Well Mr Evans, have a seat." Severus gestured, "Of course." Harry nodded, and took a seat. Then the blonde woman spoke up, "Draco dear wont you introduce us to your new friend?" She asked, Draco huffed, "Don't worry darling I'll do it." Harry drawled again, "Harry Evans, formerly known as Harry Potter." He said, "Don't look shocked. Also no need to introduce yourselves." He said lightly, smiling, "Oh? Has Draco spoke of us?" She asked, resuming her self control.
H: Okay. Goodnight Tom.
H: She named him after you?
Severus nodded, turning his attention to the boys arm. "If you aren't on Dumbledores side, who's side are you on?"
"Harry! You better?" He shuffled over so Harry could sit on the bed with him.
T: That is no way to talk to your father young man!
"I have clearly done a number on your mind, haven't I?" Tom murmured, and Harry grinned.
As the clock struck quarter to twelve, he readied himself. He gripped the knife tightly, his wand tucked away safely. He left Belladonna guarding the diary.
Lucius looked like he was about to cry, and Narcissa looked like she was about to start laughing.
"Tom?" Severus tentatively asked.
Draco laughed madly, falling onto his back from his sitting position, "Well, I suppose our murdering spree can start a little earlier. Hey, you may even be able to convince Tom to join us."
Still, he and Draco, and their other dorm mates ate lunch peacefully, laughing and making fun of Gryffindors and Mudbloods.
"Mr Potter," Harry tensed at the name, "You were the one to reveal the truth to Karkoden. How did you know?"
A week had passed, and Neville was accepted into the group rather quickly. The Malfoys had agreed to start the cleansing after they had some more proof, but with the Longbottoms insane, it would be a bit harder.
"Sorry, yes, Father."
Later that night, when he had been dropped off at the Dursleys and relocked in his cupboard, he relayed it all to Tom,
Naturally Harry went into the sweet shop. Severus huffed and followed behind; he was attempting to discreetly buy himself some chocolate. Harry wondered if the man was aware he could read minds.
"I'll resize them at Hogwarts. That was one of the first charms I learned, resizing. Very nifty." He murmured.
Harry had sent the letter off three weeks ago, and Lucius had come almost immediately. He got all the information, and sorted it in a way as to not make it look like it came directly from the dark lord. He soon went and spoke to the minister, who decided it would be looked forther into before accusing the Weasleys of anything.
"Thas Tom, silly. Oh oh! I forgots all daddy's friends. Oh Harry, there's not enough space."
Severus nodded, "What can we do to help?"
Harry was overcome with curiosity, and stepped in, cringing at the water splashing over his shoes. He trudged on downwards, further into the tunnel.
Harry took great pleasure is showing Draco the clothes, mostly soft jumpers in light colours. The suit was also a favourite, and Harry made quick work of resizing it.
H: TOM
"Bloody hell!" He exclaimed, taking out his potions study book and note pad, figuring it all out before consulting Tom, who explained and told him he was right in his theories, and the potion was in fact very hard to brew. It took exact precision. Severus Snape, one of Toms former followers, was the only person he could recall that could brew it without it having negative effects. It just turns out that this Snape person was due to be his potions professor. Harry was ecstatic about that. However, he may hate Harry quite dearly.
Percy nodded, and Draco dropped his hand, "Bye Per'y!"
It was a stupid question really.
"What, mister Evans?"
"That you have! Although, I must say I appreciate it. Do you want to know what else this has enabled me to do?" At a nod from Tom, Harry blinked, closing his eyes for a little longer than usual.
He smiled, "Goodbye, Draco."
"Ah, on the Longbottoms. I have reason to believe Neville may be the missing Zachariah LeStrange."
Harry nodded, "So you want me to do it?" And Tom nodded back, and then the bell went, "Talk through the diary!" He hissed before Quirrel wrapped the turban back around his head, "Off you go Mister Evans." He said, no stutter as his eyes faded from red to blue.
Ron was amazed, "So, who is Neville really, and who are you?"
Once inside, they were met with Arthur, Molly, Dumbledore, Ginny, Minister fudge and two other ministry officials. A few moments after getting situated, a tall woman stepped through the fireplace. She was wearing all white, her hair pulled back neatly. It was Narcissa. She smiled warmly at her nephew, and opened her medical case.
"Sort of. Charlie said he's gonna come down, for the twins, but Bill hasn't replied yet. They think he has something to do with the abuse so they're going to forcibly bring him down either way. Charlie is going on trial too. Dad is gonna send you a letter cause you may have to speak as well."
And with that, Harry left his mind, with a new plan.
Neville let out a sad little huff, "I think I'm going to let him go. I don't even really know how to look after him."
Nothing registered until two shaking hands wrapped around him, and the guard of a dummy pressed against his shoulder. Harry turned a little, and was met with Draco's worried eyes, "s
The man laughed, "I am trapped here, and you are having a large effect on me. I was weak and almost dead for many years, curled up almost as a foetus. I sent out bad signals as much as I could, and it's almost as it some of the bad trapped in this fraction of soul, is now part of your soul, not mine. I was worse than he told you when I had my own body."
The crying stopped and Harry heard rustling, meaning Draco was wiping his face. "S-sure." He croaked and Harry pulled back the curtain, sitting down on the rustled sheets. "Whats wrong?" He asked softly, after all Harry still had a heart and he still cared. "Nothing.." The boy denied, fiddling with his fingers, a nervous twitch Harry instantly picked up on.  "Its okay, you can tell me. I wont tell anyone. I swear on my magic." Harry said even softer, moving to cross his legs and sit facing the boy. They both knew the promise wouldn't do anything, but it was fun to pretend, and it set Draco at ease too.
Harry scoffed, and scuffed his shoes against the stone hallway. The rest if the evening was uneventful, and Harry sat with Atlantes. They devised a plan, and Belladonna had finally joined them.
T: But first, sleep. Goodnight.
H: I NEED ANSWERS
T: Goodnight my child.
Back in the rooms, Ginny was still crying however. Severus was still confused.
"I don't know, I just do. I remember it scene by scene, as if I'm living it again."
He held both their hands, and felt them trembling. He had to be strong, for them if no one else. With laced fingers, they both shuffled up to him.
Lucius then stepped through with Karkoden, who was still slightly weak.
Narcissa pulled a hysterical Ginny onto her lap, and Lucius sat with Karkoden, soothing him.
Here little Harry sat, tears staining his cheeks. He was only five, but his uncle had giving him a beating a grown man would complain about. But Harry knew if he started complaining from the safe, dark confides of his small cupboard under the stairs his uncle would come and grab him by his hair for round two. So he stayed quiet, silent sobs that shook his entire being barely escaping him.
"You say that Tom, but how much has he been learning from the small occupant in his mind?" Severus asked, sitting straighter.
Draco looked up at him with wide eyes, "You're goin'?"
Many of the students were crying, even a few of the Slytherin's. Harry really did wish that he could pretend he didn't care, but Draco was one crying.
"Besides Minerva's body, was some... Writing on the wall. It read, 'The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened,' if any of you have any clue what this may mean," Dumbledore faded out as Harry felt, very clearly, TomQuirrel glaring at him.
"I dont need your help!" Harry's voice was raspy, but his face was twisted with anger. "Get out!"
Harry didn't think he could become any redder, "No! How- how would that even work? We're both blokes."
H: Yeah a Slytherin, not fucking James Bond. Filch is a fucking monster. And his darned cat.
Once they got back to their common room, Harry ushered Draco back to their dorm where Draco would have a nap and Harry would spend the two hour time span studying and talking to Tom. After a little while Harry woke Draco up and got him dressed again, the smaller boy being decidedly happier that he had woken up dry, an Harry thought naps might have to be a daily occurrence as Draco was less grouchy now. Although that could just be because he saw his father and got very little sleep.
His cupboard door was open and his uncle reached in and grabbed him, dragging him by his aching arm, banging his head on the door frame on his way out, "Owwie!" The small boy whimpered, his eyes shooting open. He could hardly see his uncles face in the pitch blackness of the hallway, but Harry knew he was angry, very, very angry. And of course it was Harry's fault, it always was.
Harry had a sadistic grin, "That sounds amazing. Of course I will."
"McGonagall isn't the first person he's killed."
He was on his way back to the tower with Draco now, as Snape had dismissed the class to clean up the mess.
Finch-Fletchley, Justin
Harry lifted his head, "Y-you." His voice was broken, and Tom's (or rather, Quirrels) face dropped.
H: My family say magic isn't real, well my parents are dead, but my aunt and uncle say so.
"Well they're everywhere. Uhm. Kinda big, and lots of them are white." Draco knew something was wrong, "There was one on his tummy, and it looked a bit like letters."
"Yeah, that's it."
He barely listened to Dumbledore bumble through telling the students that McGonagall was dead, although when he sat down to state the fact Harry perked up some more.
"Well, she'd throw things, like everyone else said. She liked hitting the side of my face with her spoon, or scratching me. Sometimes she'd pinch me until I bled."
Harry nodded, "Did you... Love him?"
Draco gently shook his head, "I don't feel small anymore. And you didn't really pull me, I was teetering anyway, because I'd been small for so long."
Once they were finished and Draco was cleaned, Harry made his way towards his head of house, Draco following behind.
As much as he hated muggles and Muggleborns who brought dirt upon their world, he liked their clothes.  Wizards were too old fashioned.
Harry, despite Vernon's words no longer hurting him, couldn't help the tears that blurred his vision as he traced the word. It was glaringly white and jagged, although the texture of skin no longer felt different. There was simply a dip in his flesh. He remembered when it was red and raw, still bleeding. And all the scarring it did. It hurt to touch for months.
Ron agreed, "It's like that with me too, but with all of my siblings. It's almost like I'm the child they didn't want."
After Severus, Bill was called up. All the adults seemed to be going before the children, although the way he was called up was somewhat different, "William Arthur Weasley, please come to the stand and discuss your experiences with your mother."
Now, Harry knew it would probably be a pureblood family, and well known to be light if this was anything like Neville's. And so, he rewrote the list again.
