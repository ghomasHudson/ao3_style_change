Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he kept silent and stared at the fire.
Humming into the embrace, Harry ran his hand down Draco’s toned stomach. Then Draco nuzzled into Harry’s neck again.
Pansy and Blaise had reunited with Theo, who still sat with Ernie, who, by the looks of it, had become Pansy’s new victim of torment.
Draco smiled before he looked back out at the lake.
“Walk with me?”
He slowly rose from the couch and headed to his dorm.
Harry stood up quickly, having caught on to Draco’s insinuation, but he swayed as he stood, apparently very tipsy.
Hermione shook her head as Blaise and Draco laughed.
‘To Draco,
Ron laughed as Hermione hit him again.
“I think that’s a great idea Ron,” Hermione said warmly.
Harry turned to look at him fully. Clearly an expression of confusion upon his face.
Harry shot Ron a mean look as his best friend tried to look innocent.
Once again, Harry felt gobsmacked.
“Really?”
Harry couldn’t stop moaning. The feel of Draco rubbing up against him from behind was easily the hottest thing he’d ever experienced and he very well thought he could drift to heaven right then and there.
And now, as Harry lay there, he finally felt complete, unburdened, relieved.
All the bitter memories of his childhood suddenly forced their way to the forefront of Harry’s brain. He involuntarily gripped his forehead as if in agony. All those years he should’ve been with his parents, with his Godfather, and yet he was stuck with a family who never wanted him. And surely enough, his thoughts reverted back to his parents, and the longing ache he felt toward people he never had the pleasure of knowing was rising once more in his chest. The reality that he was robbed of a good and pure life. His insides felt like a scar he thought had healed but were suddenly sliced open again. His breathing came in pants and he felt tears fall down his cheeks again, barely away that he was crying because the memories seemed to overwhelm him.
“Goodness gracious Potter...Well I must say that’s a marvellous idea!”
Not a moment later, Draco, with his arm still firmly clasped around Harry’s waist, had shifted the brunette toward the desk beside them.
Harry looked at her. Luna had done this so many times since he’d known her and yet he still felt astonished at her wild sense of knowing and straightforwardness.
Harry spluttered at his casualness, “So what?!... So we’re just gonna keep doing whatever it is we’re doing and pretending like it’s normal-”
Draco hummed in pleasure as he began to lay back on Harry’s bed, Harry following his movements.
Harry ran cold. He didn’t want to go there. Not tonight. Not ever. He hadn’t meant to say it, he just slipped up.
“Oh! How is she these days? Honestly sometimes I feel like she just should move in here, she’s one of us, anyone who thinks otherwise is a daft-”
She made her way into the compartment looking so content, Harry actually felt envious. Neville followed in after her and then Ginny finally made her way in and plonked herself next to Harry.
Now their topic had drifted to cautious territory, and Harry had begun to think that this was the moment that he should come clean about his feelings for Draco. Even though they were in a pub packed full of people, Harry felt like it was just he and Draco, and his heart felt full.
Harry read the letter that had just been delivered by Teddy the owl. It was early in the morning and Teddy’s tapping on Harry’s window had woken him up from a light sleep, filled with dreams of apples, broomsticks and swirling colours of platinum blond.
“It’s alright professor,” Harry said suddenly bold, “Even if you hadn’t put me up to this, I probably would’ve done it anyway.”
“Is it Cho?”
Harry was sighing into Draco’s mouth, still so appalled at himself and yet pleasantly surprised that this was really happening.
He sat down quickly, trying to gather his thoughts again despite being left utterly gobsmacked by his old Headmaster.
“Why is Malfoy next to you?” Ron demanded. “Are you hurt?”
He stalked down the dark corridor of the boys dormitories, and then out in the Slytherin common room where a handful of students were hanging about before breakfast.
On Friday afternoon at lunch, the eighth years were discussing Dean and Seamus’s new notice they’d pinned to the noticeboard: Eighth Year Party in the Room of Requirement. This Saturday at 9 PM.
Ron shrugged, “She seems fine. I mean, it’s like George said, it hurts, but Fred wouldn’t of wanted us to sulk around. Coming back to Hogwarts fell at the right time for me and Ginny, and opening a store fell at the right time for George. We’re dealing with it, but we’re being productive at the same time.”
The boys ignored her and started singing on the floor.
“Like I don’t deserve their acceptance.”
The same lemon, soil, grass and parchment scent wafting around him.
A short while after, Harry saw Draco leaning against the wall next to the food table, a small glass with amber liquid in it, looking totally peaceful.
“Wow he’s handsome Mummy!”
“Hello everyone.” An airy voice spoke from behind Harry and he knew exactly who it was.
Draco moved his way up to Harry’s jaw, before tilting the brunettes head back with his hand and leaning down to kiss him.
“You’re mental.”
“Fine. Leave. I don’t care.”
Harry’s grip on the blond’s hair tightened, “It’s true Malfoy. Don’t deny it.”
“Potter! What the hell are you doing here?!” A seventh year Slytherin called out to him.
Harry hastily reached behind Draco’s neck and kissed him senseless, wondering if it was humanly possible to fall any deeper in love with the boy above him.
Harry reminded himself of this truth as much as he could, it provided him reassurance and comfort, as Sirius often did anyway. But as for Harry’s numbness, the only real emotions he felt these days aside from his anger, was …. No, he really didn’t want to admit it, Harry couldn’t be in love with Draco Malfoy.
Her large eyes sparkled, “Thank you Harry Potter.”
After what felt like hours, Harry finally heard the footsteps of Draco walk up the stairs.
Harry paused and swallowed, “I did...but-”
“You’re beautiful Draco.”
“I’d just like to say thank you to all of you for your cooperation this term,” She looked around at them all with kind eyes, “The younger year levels have been so appreciative of your mentorship. And, more importantly...I’ve seen a real change in all of you. From what I can see, you have developed new friendships beyond that of your own Houses, and I believe that shows real maturity.” Harry saw her eyes begin to water. “Well...happy Christmas,” She said before she hurried off, blowing her nose into a tartan handkerchief as she went.
“You’re doing it again. I can see it growing bigger in your eyes.”
Draco shone that infamous smirk, “Why am I not surprised you’re still in your robes?”
Pansy, Blaise and Theo fixed their stern gazes upon Harry. Draco standing behind them looking apprehensive. Until he placed a hand on Theo’s shoulder, and his three friends turned to look at him.
And then Draco let go of Harry’s hand and slid his palm up Harry’s side.
“You two,” she eyed Draco and Harry, “Have rooms right next door to each other. Draco only sleeps when he has someone sleeping next to him,” She giggled, “I can put two and two together you know.”
“Merlin…McGonagall’s done all this for us?” Ron asked.
“P-please,” Harry’s voice was hoarse as he sniffed and wiped his nose on his sleeve, his eyes still staring at the book in his hands, “Don’t f-feel bad. I-I’m sorry for being such a prick.”
Suddenly and most expectedly aroused, Harry felt stuck once again; not wanting to move, but also facing the increasing reality of his boxers tightening with every passing minute.
The rest of the eighth years looked between each other, stunned.
“Are you OK?”
So obviously, they all had a long way to go before they could, in Pansy’s words, ‘play happy families.’
Harry found himself plainly staring into Draco’s eyes, utterly perplexed.
I don’t talk about Remus much, the pain of his loss is still raw, but I’ll tell you stories about him in due time, he was a great man.
“So,” Draco said in a low voice, “Have you thought anymore about what this gravitational pull between you and I might mean?”
Hermione and Ron scooted up along the booth seat against the wall, as Pansy sat beside Hermione, and Blaise pulled up a chair beside Draco.
Harry lowered his head and kissed Draco softly on the shoulder, and then lingered there for a moment before resting his head upon it, unable to look at Draco because the reality of him leaving was really beginning to sink in now.
“Like that do you Potter?”
“Lavender!” She said loudly, her eyes wide.
Blaise and Draco broke out in a fit of giggles. Harry couldn’t help but laugh as well as he stood beside Hermione looking down at them in front of the fire.
Draco’s eyes widened at him.
It was now Thursday morning. Harry and Draco had slept in Draco’s bed every night since their return to Hogwarts. On Tuesday night, Harry couldn’t find a reasonable excuse to knock on Draco’s door, and Draco hadn’t knocked on his door either, so Harry took the hint and tried to sleep by himself.
About fifteen brooms flew out of the shed. A few of the kids screamed but then each of the brooms turned and lay next to each of the first years.
“But you’ve done enough of that?”
He swallowed cautiously, “Alright here goes…” He turned to look at Seamus, “Seamus, when you admitted you loved me in the Room of Requirement, I was glad. I’m sorry I’ve taken so long to tell you, but I’m telling you now, that the feeling’s mutual.”
“Look, we just wanna know if you’re alright!” Ron said defensively, “I know you’ve been having bad dreams but-”
Suddenly nervous, Harry sought to break the silence.
“Yes Harry. We did. I woke up and laid next to you for half an hour or so before I realised you probably wouldn’t be waking up any time soon, so I went down to breakfast.”
love you!” Potter said, throwing an arm around Draco.
“You’re so
“He’s right,” Pansy said, much to Draco’s amazement. “You don’t have to give them any details. Just tell them about how happy you two have been together for the past three months and put a stopper to the nasty rumors about you having been
“What? No! I …” Harry’s eyes widened and he hurried to explain before Draco cut him off.
“Harry, I think we’ll have to carry him,” came Weasley’s voice.
Draco’s mind was completely blank for only a moment longer before a river of memories came pouring back into his brain, making him helplessly grab for the edge of his bed in order to steady himself.
“Malfoy,” Potter interrupted, dark eyebrows raised and a small smile tugging at one corner of his lips. “Don’t you
“What? That was not what you expected to hear, was it?” MacMillan sneered, coming closer still. “Did you think that I’m here to apologize to you because he told me to? You think I’m afraid of him?”
And now, every time he looked at Harry, he wanted to take his hand and tell him that he hadn’t forgotten. That it was simply impossible to forget, because those words were forever laced through every fiber of his heart. But how could he? This Harry didn’t remember that. This Harry didn’t
Potter looked up again, his fingers still busy stabbing Draco’s prostate with every movement.
Potter was dressed exactly like Draco; the same brown leather sandals with straps curling around his tanned calves all the way up to his knees, the same plain white, sleeveless toga, and the crown of green laurel leaves resting on his messy black hair. The only difference between their costumes was the short, purple cloak pinned to Draco’s left shoulder that indicated the superiority of his character’s rank over Potter’s.
This was how it had started, since the moment he had stepped into Platform 9 ¾ to take the train to Hogwarts for Eighth Year. And Draco had thought that either the students would get tired of tormenting him and drop it eventually, or he would get used to it after a while. But the bullying and the name calling only got worse and worse, and tolerating it got harder and harder.
“No, we do. We absolutely do,” Draco ran a hand across his face; he wished the ground under his feet would just open up and swallow him down. “Pans, I can’t believe I didn’t realize…
“Draco, don’t do this.” Pansy sounded pained. Betrayed.
Weasley – in his surprisingly fashionable vampire costume – was the first person Draco spotted in the crowd.
“Whoever did it, I like them. They’ve got balls.” Pansy sounded almost proud.
“That is very admirable, Harry,” Draco’s mother nodded. “But I guess I shouldn’t have expected anything less from the Savior of the Wizarding World.” She put a hand on Harry’s shoulder before turning her attention to Draco once again. “How about you, darling? Have you decided on what you want to do yet?”
“Mother!” Draco turned around, beaming at her.
,” Draco muttered under his breath.
the one daring
And they were all here; almost every person that Draco had ever cared about in his entire life. He wished that his father had been a part of the ceremony too, or that Vince could be here to graduate with the rest of them, but even without them, it was still one of the best days of Draco’s life.
“Okay,” Harry said, pushing off the shelf and taking a step closer. “But just so you know, Ginny’s not my girlfriend.”
“I had a headache,” Draco said way too quickly, like he had rehearsed it in his head a thousand times. “I needed to rest.”
Once inside the common room, Draco excused himself almost immediately; making his way to the boys’ dormitories and closing the door behind himself. None of the other Eighth Year Slytherin boys were there yet and the dormitory was empty except for Draco. So Draco dropped his disguise; his face crumpling with all the emotions he’d felt that day that were threatening to tear him open from the inside out and crawl their way out of his skin.
“Yes.” Pansy answered, looking straight ahead.
. Draco stabbed his fork into the roast chicken on his plate, shooting daggers at the back of Potter’s head. That arsehole was
!” Potter said, suddenly alarmed. He shot forward in his hurry to snatch the parchment before Slughorn could pick it up, and his elbow knocked over his cauldron, spilling its contents all over Slughorn’s robes and sending the poor old man to the ground.
He opened the box and stared in amazement at the mesmerizing liquid shining behind the tiny glazed solitaire of the ring.
?” Draco stopped walking, suddenly feeling overwhelmed by all the doubts and helpless questions he’d tried to suppress all day long. “Why would you even want someone like me
Before Draco can say anything, the sound of a person clearing their throat startles the both of them out of their shared moment. Potter looks up and over Draco’s head at the person and then quickly lets go of Draco, taking a step back.
“Unhand me, you
out a dusty old stool and sat down; Potter did the same. For a few seconds, there was utter silence .Draco could tell Potter was making up his mind – or maybe he was gathering up his courage, but that was too unlikely for someone as brave as Potter – before he finally started talking.
“It has, indeed.” Borgin gave him an empty smile, showing off his disgusting yellowed teeth. “Tell me, how’s your father doing? The house arrest must be really hard for him. Poor man.”
, Potter. Stop!” Draco panted. “Please, I’m too close. I can’t hold it back.”
“So, what do you think?” Pansy says expectantly, nudging him with her elbow.
“For the showers!” came a few weak, half-arsed replies, and Draco already knew this would be a losing game.
“Yes,” Harry tensed against him. “He was annoying me,”
, I love you so much.”
Draco sighed in exasperation. It had been like this all day. Potter just casually showed up, kissed Draco and then left him desperately wanting
“C’mon.” Potter let go of his waist to take Draco’s hand into his own, practically dragging Draco behind himself towards his friends at the Gryffindor table.
“Draco,” Harry turned around, still holding Draco’s hand. “Hey, look at me. We’re not going inside the room where everything is hidden, okay? That place was destroyed in the Fiendfyre. But there’s more to the Room of Requirements than just that place. Do you trust me?”
“Liana?”
“No, no I can’t fall sleep.” Draco sobbed, but his eyelids were already falling shut against his will.
“No, of course not,” Draco hurried to explain, only just remembering that Harry was a perfectly nice person who was now his friend, and Draco was the one acting like a selfish prick. “No, I’m totally happy for you. I am. You two look great together,” (he had to force that part out) “and not gross, definitely not gross. I don’t know why I said that,” Draco sighed in defeat, letting his eyes fall shut. What was wrong with him? “It’s just … I was really exhausted after the game, and I just wanted to get some sleep.”
“Harry…” Draco managed in between kisses. “Harry, please…”
“Do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow, Malfoy?” Potter crosses his arms over his board chest so casually, like he didn’t just take Draco’s breath away with what he just said.
“Watch where you’re going,
Love,
“Wasn’t me.” Draco felt the need to make it clear, even though he knew that Pansy was probably already aware.
“I think I’d be okay. That’s the best kind of closure I could hope for, anyways.” He shrugs, momentarily thrilled by the idea of kissing Potter.
“Alright,” Blaise shrugged. “It’s just extremely out of character for you to keep him waiting, you know.”
Harry chuckled softly against Draco’s lips and they kissed as he worked Draco opened with his long, thick fingers, scissoring and twisting them inside Draco and making him helplessly moan into Harry’s mouth. Harry’s cock was still very much hard and leaking against the inside of Draco’s thigh, but he was apparently getting more pleasure out of watching Draco jerk in desperation for him than actually fucking Draco.
“Neville can be
“And what conclusion did you come to?” Draco sneered. “Am I trying to assassinate you? Is it all a part of my big plan to resurrect the Dark Lord? Please, enlighten me, I’m curious to know.”
“The ancient Greek lovers?” Pansy said, appearing beside him out of nowhere, her fancy Celestina Warbeck’s robes swirling around her feet. “Merlin, that’s the nerdiest thing I’ve seen all year. And I’m friends with Hermione Granger now!” Pansy squinted at him and her eyes widened. “Is that mascara you’re wearing?” she shouted. “You

this??? And how was Draco supposed to be happy in it if all of his fundamental problems and mistakes had followed him here?
“Cool!” Potter smiled that damn smile and kissed Draco on the forehead. “See you, then!”
“Holy shit.” Pansy suddenly sits up and drags Draco out of his thoughts once again. “Draco, I might actually have an idea.” She crosses her legs on the sofa, turning to him completely. “What if you got to kiss him?”
Draco had put a lot of thought into it. He’d spent months researching different programs and reading dozens of catalogues about various training courses. There were a lot of jobs out there. He could become a Potion Maker, or a Fashion Designer. He could work for the Ministry as an Unspeakable or a Curse Breaker. He could even join the Auror program alongside Harry. Those were all great options for him, but none of them had felt
“You sure? Cause you don’t seem to be in any condition to wait that long,” Potter lifted one thick eyebrow at him.
“Oh, right. Sorry.” Weasley muttered, scratching the back of his head sheepishly.
“Yeah. Nice try, mate,” Blaise patted Draco’s shoulder on his way out of the boys’ dormitories, murmuring to himself “Honestly, like I don’t know he’s just trying to make me say it again so he can relish on hearing other people call him his
Draco sticks his chin out, holding his ground. “Of course you do. You think everyone is in love with you. Why shouldn’t you? You’re the bloody Savior himself, after all.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco said into the silence after a few minutes of running his long fingers through Harry’s mass of sweat-damp hair. Harry sighed.
“And it’s a good idea, to apologize to the people you’ve hurt. It means you’re taking responsibility for your mistakes and it’s admirable,” Potter took a step forward, his green eyes searching Draco’s face. “But at the end, do you think you can forgive
You got lucky that that bastard MacMillan is a complete
And that was all Draco needed to throw him over the edge again. He buried his head in Harry’s neck as his orgasm hit. And Harry was right behind him, crying out as he filled Draco up with hot sprays of his come.
! We’re Eighth Years for fuck’s sake. These kids are supposed to look up to us,” he threw his hands out. “Now they’re just going to laugh at us for the rest of the school year!”
When they’d started Eighth-Year at Hogwarts all those years ago, Harry had thrown himself in his schoolwork and lessons in order to distract himself, and without all the Voldemort-related bullshit to weight him down – as old Slughorn put it – the Evans genes had kicked in. By the end of the year, he’d had his options fully open for his future career. And since Draco and Harry had been dating for a few months by then, Draco had convinced him to turn down his offer at the Auror Program and start training with him in St. Mungo’s instead. It had been the second best decision of his life after marrying Harry. Harry was an amazing Healer.
As soon as he stepped inside, he headed straight for the nearest shower stall with his chin in the air, taking his duffle bag with him so he could disrobe and then – once he had showered – put on new clothes inside the privacy of the small stall.
okay? Do you want me to make you some Calming Potion?”
“Professor, can you stand?” Draco heard Potter say, his own heart threatening to jump out of his throat with adrenaline.
At that promise, the last remaining thread of Draco’s control busted, making him come hard and endless to the feel of Harry’s fingers inside him. He let out a helpless cry, clenching the white sheets in his hands as he sprayed hot come all over his own torso.
.” MacMillan hiccupped, face wet as tears ran down his cheeks one after the other.
, you’re so tight,”
“Wha…” Draco narrows his eyes at him suspiciously. “Is this some kind of a sick joke?”
“No it wasn’t,” Potter lifted a large basket of dried beetles. “Which makes me wonder; you’ve been trying so hard to stay out of trouble for the past couple of months. Why would you suddenly decide to get yourself
“Oh hell,” Potter muttered, “What now?”
Draco sat upright. “What? As in,
Draco’s hands are falling limply on either side of his body; fingertips itching to bury themselves inside that unruly mass of black locks and feel its texture. But he can’t bring himself to move them. He is already feeling to many things for his poor heart to handle. The pressure of Potter’s lips on his, his tongue in Draco’s mouth, his arms around Draco’s body and the cool, pleasant scent of him filling Draco’s lungs are already far more than Draco has ever felt before. He can’t take more without losing himself entirely.
!” Draco sniffed.
was what Draco had been begging for, after all. Because just like that, his eyes rolled back on his skull, and he was coming, painting his own bare chest and Harry’s hoodie with white ribbons of come.
Draco looked away, “I… Not when you’re like this. I don’t, I don’t want to take advantage.”
“That’s Harry’s business,” Hermione interrupted him with a fixed look at Parvati.
“You know we support you Harry,” Hermione said kindly. “But that was very rude of Pansy, Harry’s got to sort these things out on his own,” She said fiercely looking at Blaise.
The blonde then moved his hand to cup Harry’s throat. He looked deeply into Harry’s eyes as he grazed his thumb along Harry’s jaw.
Dean was smiling at him, as were the other eighth years as Harry plonked down in between Parvati and Ron, throwing his head in his hands.
Draco’s head was lying on Harry’s pillow, his head turned so it rested on Harry’s shoulder.
“Your house is cold.”
Harry’s thoughts broke abruptly as he found himself back in the compartment with his best friends.
“Quiet please!” Harry yelled feebly. He heard Draco giggling behind him.
Ron, now looking extremely put out, reluctantly took the pen from Hermione after she’d signed her name, then signed his own, and passed the pen to Harry.
“Relax Potter,” Draco chuckled, “I’m joking.”
“That’s wonderful Luna,” Hermione said kindly.
Harry knew all too well what he was talking about. He smiled and said, “I know exactly what you mean.”
“He’s the last person in the known universe that I’d think you’d end up with mate, but, looking back, at all the dumb stuff we got ourselves into over the years, one things for sure that if you’re friends with Harry Potter, you gotta learn to just go with it.”
Hermione sighed.
Draco then broke away from Harry’s neck and looked at him, his eyes darkened with arousal. Harry stopped his grinding and looked back at Draco in earnest, utterly mesmerised by his gaze.
Hermione stood behind the couch where Ron and Harry were slouching comfortably. She tugged on Harry’s robes behind his neck attempting to pull him up.
Draco yielded under his gaze, resting his silver blond head back onto Harry’s pillow and looking up at the Gryffindor with arousal and smugness.
When Harry and Draco arrived at the eighth year table, Blaise stood clapping Draco on the back.
Harry’s eyes widened and felt a rush of arousal course through his boxers at the revelation that Draco had actually fancied him in the past.
“Thanks Harry.”
“I guess that means Draco finally got his wish,” Blaise said through his cackling.
In the past, Harry just thought it was the obligations of their rivalry bringing them together so often, but now he was sure there was something more to it. Perhaps they were just trigger happy teenagers that found thrill in beating each other up, but Harry had no reason to beat Draco up this year and yet he still felt himself wanting to be near the blond. Blond, Harry thought to himself. Draco’s hair seemed to have lost its strictness, it had formed soft waves and parted softly around his face.
“Madam, I mean no offence but I am a Ministry official and this will have to be reported. Mr Malfoy here has a record, he’s on probation. I’ll need to speak with the Headmistress.”
When they’d gotten in the shower, Draco came up behind Harry again, and Harry moaned loudly at the feel of Draco’s bareskin against his own.
“You need me…?” Harry whispered.
“Teaching is a privilege Ron.” Hermione said fiercely, “In fact, I think all three of us should sign up for Defence Against the Dark Arts. We’ve been through more than most wizarding adults and I think McGonagall would prefer if we took the subject.”
“Fight back you coward,” Harry hissed.
Harry, now painfully hard, shifted so he was straddling Draco’s hips. Draco welcomed the position as he continued to kiss Harry’s neck.
When they bid George farewell, Hermione checked her watch.
Harry couldn’t hold back his satisfied grin at Draco’s admittance. He sat back and straddled Draco, running his hands down his chest and stomach.
“You look immensely happy Harry. I feared that what I had put you through would have tainted you forever. Somehow, even as a painting, my heart hurts to think of it.”
Draco walked over to Harry’s bed and sat. Harry followed him, sitting beside the blond and reaching out to hold his hands.
Harry felt a sudden rush of gratitude for his old Head of House.
Only a few seconds later did Harry’s hips buck and he was coming into Draco’s hand.
Harry shrugged, “OK. If that’s what you want.”
“Massage.” Harry said simply. He must be crazy, he thought to himself, but then again, it was nighttime and he was literally sitting in Draco’s bed.
“Yeah. I think he got quite lonely. Sometimes he’d come down in the middle of the night and we’d speak through the door.”
Harry cut him off, “What are you going to do with Draco?”
“Harry you feel so good.”
“Merlin...Why didn’t I think of that?”
He came back the moment, realising that it was silent, everyone looking at him expecting him to say something.
“Oh please Potter it’s only a bit of fun. Don’t have me thinking Gryffindor’s are soft. Besides,” She suddenly got to her feet, Blaise following suit, “If we’re all gonna sit together and play happy family, you’re gonna have to get used to our wicked sense of humour. Come on Theo, Draco.”
“I didn’t say who!” Harry said frustratingly.
Harry then reached forward and fumbled with the fly of Draco’s jeans.
“So what do I owe the pleasure Potter?”
Harry raised his eyebrows in a knowing look, “I suppose I could’ve guessed that.”
“Oi! Harry! Get over here!” Ron yelled.
“Need I remind you that, that same git saved my life last year, yours as well! He could’ve easily ratted us out.”
“I have come to the realisation that I have a uniform kink,” Harry murmured into Draco’s back.
“He’s not on probation and he doesn’t have a record, so he’s just got a few detentions with McGonagall.” Draco answered looking at Harry.
Harry choked, that should not have turned him on. They turned simultaneously under the Cloak.
“Figures you two hadn’t picked up a Prophet in the last few months.”
“Oh! Right. Yeah. Yes. I do.”
“It’s OK,” Harry said. “And I appreciate you being supportive. I don’t really… want to end it, but I haven’t any other options have I?”
There he was, Draco Malfoy, apparently having returned from the library with a pile of books in his hands.
“Is that what your Dad told you was it? Him and Voldemort having a nice little chat over tea about how they’re gonna kill me?”
“Er- So how are you professor? What’s it like being a portrait?”
“I ran into Ron and Hermione. Sorry.”
In Harry’s drunkenness, he fell forwards into Draco, his head falling onto Draco’s shoulders. Before Harry pulled away, he revelled in Draco’s scent, the aroma only making him more delirious with euphoria amidst his intoxicated state.
I think of you all the time, and like you - sleep only comes when I do (haha, pathetic pun I know). But you are definitely the last thought I have at night. You and your blond hair. I miss your scent. You smell like parchment, lemon, soil and grass.
“Harry...It’s OK, you’re OK,” Draco whispered into his ear.
Draco then reached up and draped the Cloak over both of them, then clung onto Harry tightly so as to keep them concealed as possible.
Draco giggled, “Alright Roonil Wazlib?”
“I guess I’m just going to have to get used to your constant state of oblivion,” Draco rasped and Harry could feel his breath ghost across his face.
Draco chuckled into his neck. And then Harry turned to reconnect their lips, his fingers coming up to tangle in blond hair.
“Yes.”
Harry’s heart was racing. He watched the Ministry wizard lead Draco and Blaise up the main street toward the path that takes them back to Hogwarts, feeling a pressing urge to run after Draco.
Thank you for all your comments, they're very encouraging :)
The silence went on, aside from Blaise’s chuckling. Harry sat there helpless, silently begging for Hermione to step in and save him once again from his increasing mortification.
This often amused Harry, that Dumbledore would always be finding something to do and people to visit even as a mere painting.
Draco gripped Harry’s shoulders and kneed him hard in the groin.
“You’ll like my pillows then,” Harry gestured behind them, “I only just found them like this before you came bursting through my door.”
Harry blinked. He was back in the common room. Warm heat from the fire flushing his cheeks. Ron looking at him dully.
Draco shrugged, “Probably just cop a howling from my probation officer. McGonagall’s owled my Mother. That’s the part I feel the worst about. I felt like I was doing OK, and I was doing OK for her sake. When she hears this she won’t be pleased.”
“Shall we take this outside?” The man asked Draco.
“And she doesn’t mind that you’re not with her for Christmas?” Hermione asked.
Blaise and Ron were hysterical as Harry flushed.
“You know, I was actually going to be in Slytherin.”
Blaise laughed, “Yeah, Chosen One jumped on Draco like his life depended on it.”
But this letter had to get to Draco, so Harry fed the owl some of his chocolate that his room had magicked (funnily enough it was the same chocolate Lupin used to offer him) and he reopened his window and watched the owl fly into the night.
“I er, I’d like to say something.”
It had gotten to 11 PM by the time Harry, Ron, Hermione and Pansy went up to their rooms.
“I was thinking about Luna,” Harry interrupted him.
You’ve always been an enigma to me Harry, but that’s why I find you so addictive.
The two girls flung their arms around each other as more claps and laughter ensued around the table. Harry cringed slightly at the sappy sight.
Harry looked around at them properly now, and he noticed, with a jolt, that the Slytherin’s were no longer sitting at their designated end of the table.
“Pansy?”
“Yes.”
Before I work myself up again, I try to remind myself that Hermione’s studying to become the Minister of Magic. She reckons that change can only be made from within. So I try to have faith that by the time we’re older, these dumb acts of pettiness won’t exist.
Draco reached for his wand on the side table and cast a wordless Cleaning charm upon both of them before he chuckled, “I don’t think I’ve ever come in my clothes so much in one term.”
“If that doesn’t work Finnigan, I have ample supply in my bedroom,” He winked at Seamus, “And I’d be happy to oblige… So long as that’s cool with everyone?”
Draco sighed, “Because, I had someone else in my bed with me.”
He returned to kissing Draco’s lips. Draco gripped Harry’s hair as the brunette dug his tongue into Draco’s mouth.
But this had become one of very many nights, and once again, Harry found himself completely lost in the moment.
His friends laughed, before turning away from him and continuing their way down to the dungeons.
Harry returned his grin.
“What?!”
Harry huffed out his annoyance, before finally letting Draco’s hand free.
“Yes Harry I’m sure. I only know Occlumency.”
Seeming again to know what Harry was thinking, Draco turned to look at him with knowing eyes, “I’ll be alright Harry.”
Harry chuckled feebly, “Yeah, I suppose.”
Draco had his white button up school shit on beneath his vest, his green tie looking immaculate, and over the top draped his Slytherin robe. His white hair was roused in that same sexy way that left Harry dizzy with desire, and his black trousers and shiny shoes only accentuated Draco’s toned legs.
“Well, when you’ve finished your staring competition, feel free to join us, we’re gonna play a few games.”
“The only thing that would’ve made that hotter,” Harry murmured into the blond’s skin, “Was if you wore your Slytherin tie in the shower.”
“There’s bad people in every house,” Harry said suddenly, thinking of the twat Zacharias Smith from Hufflepuff and Peter Pettigrew being in Gryffindor.
He sat down between Seamus and Lavender. Then beside Lavender was Parvati, then Neville, then Theo, then Blaise, then Pansy, then Draco, then Luna, then Hannah, then Padma, then Ernie, then Justin, then Anthony and then finally, Dean closing the circle next to Hermione.
Harry turned to her aghast.
But Harry seemed to notice that Blaise’s uniform was unconventionally untidy too. This was strange, as a prideful Slytherin, Blaise had always taken his appearance seriously.
Harry gripped Draco’s hand, forcing him to look at Harry, “Draco I’m fine. I want to.”
‘To Draco,
Draco had just lined up his body at an extremely sensitive position for both of them and their kiss broke as they gasped and groaned.
“It’s no trouble at all Luna, you’re practically one of us.”
“Yeah?”
Harry’s eyes kept glancing toward the door, waiting for what felt like years, for Draco to enter it.
When Ron finally caught his breath, he said, “OK! OK, me next! … Never have I ever, kissed a boy!”
Draco winked at Harry before abruptly getting up and heading to his door.
The stillness of the autumn air felt so good against Harry’s skin as he flew higher and higher above the pitch. The peach tinged sky was reflected beautifully against the lake and the castle and for miles he could only see the lush greens of the Forest and the Scottish landscape. It was a spectacular sight, not to mention Draco also flying in and out his sight to only add to Harry’s dreamy view.
Suddenly feeling vulnerable and naked, no longer protected by the daring atmosphere of the night, he now felt unsure of what to do. What if Draco woke up in horror? What if he was hurt to see Harry leaving? Not likely. What if Draco woke up abruptly and pretended like nothing happened. Nothing really did happen of course, they only fell asleep next to each other.
Harry ran his hands through Draco’s soft waves as Draco kissed Harry softly and tentatively.
Harry still couldn’t move. The other eighth years who were catching the Hogwarts Express back to London had arisen from their seats too.
Draco remained crouched over. But not a moment later had he twisted his foot behind Harry’s calf causing Harry to stumble backwards. Draco seized his opportunity and shoved Harry hard. The brunette fell to the cold stone floor and Draco jumped on him, straddling Harry and punching his chest.
“It’s been weeks,” Harry breathed.
At this, Draco was up from his bed. He pushed Blaise hard that the boy stumbled backwards, but continued to laugh in earnest, and then Draco strode toward the bathroom and slammed the door behind him.
Harry, Hermione, Ginny and Luna had half carried, half dragged Ron, Draco and Blaise back to the eighth year common room, after Harry and Hermione realised that there seemed to be no official end to their Christmas Eve Feast. They politely excused themselves from the drunken state of their teachers, who were still singing raucously and dancing around the Great Hall.
“You know what? I’m glad you guttered him. He deserved what he got. I would’ve done the same thing, no question.”
“So Draco tells me you're straight? Or so he thinks.”
Blaise didn’t answer, but Harry felt the boy’s arm reach behind him and clearly pass a bottle of who knows what to Ron from behind Harry and Draco’s back.
In the afternoon, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Seamus and Neville were sitting in the eighth year section of the library, trying to fit in some homework.
“Um, I don’t know if you’ve heard, but you and I are the new Quidditch mentors.”
He tightened his hold on Draco, persistent on not letting the moment end. He felt the blond’s body fall back into Harry, stirring. And then Draco slowly rolled onto his back blinking his grey eyes open to look at him.
Draco fixed him with an expression that was a mixture of challenge and plead.
“What did you two talk about?”
“What about Ginny?”
“Yes but-”
But so far Ron hadn’t detected anything suspicious about Harry’s behaviour, instead, the red head was looking at the list of the newly appointed mentors for each Hogwarts subject. The notice must’ve been put up overnight.
“Malfoy.”
“Is that why you were enemies?”
Ron shrugged, “Come ‘ere, I’ve just about thrashed Neville-”
“Harry,” Draco whispered.
Of course, appearances did play a part. He still thought Ginny was absolutely beautiful, and her fiery personality only made her more attractive.
“So who was the better Seeker Draco, you or Harry?”
Harry then reached up, grasping behind Draco’s neck and roughly pulling him down into a kiss. It was urgent and fiery, as if they both needed to let off steam and this was the perfect way to do it.
Harry paused for a moment, looking at her.
Harry felt sick, as he usually did whenever someone addressed him like this.
“Are we still talking about career plans?” Blaise asked, smirking into his cup.
“Prick.”
“It feels less empty now that you’re in it though.”
They broke apart but then Draco nuzzled into Harry’s neck and began to suck. Trailing kisses along the line between Harry’s ear and his shoulder. Draco gripped Harry’s head pulling it back so as to allow himself more access.
Draco’s eyes flashed at his words. Harry watched the sharp lines of his jaw clench, not sure if it was out of anger or determination. Draco looked back down at his wand and twisted it between his fingers.
“What I’m trying to say is, I have feelings f-”
Harry chuckled as he reached between them and cupped the bulge in Draco’s pants.
“It’s OK. I can handle myself. You guys go on.”
Harry noticed that whenever he’d had a particularly good day with Ron and Hermione, most likely at times when the three had left their DA meetings, when he’d meet up with Draco that evening, the Slytherin was cold and passive-aggressive.
“I suppose it’s better if we sleep in the bed tonight. My neck’s been killing me all day.”
Harry hummed into the kiss.
Not a moment later, Harry heard footsteps running up the staircase outside his door. He turned, and as his pulse quickened, his door flew open to reveal an adoringly handsome, platinum blond Slytherin standing there, dressed in jeans and a long travelling coat. His face was clear from the cold, with a small pink tinge on his cheeks, his hair, somehow looking effortless and falling slightly into his intoxicating grey, sparkling eyes.
When I woke up in your bed today, your green rug on the floor had turned to crimson, how do you explain that?
Before Harry could finish his sentence, a young, dark haired man about George’s age had appeared behind him and Draco, and had grasped roughly on Draco’s collar, pulling him back as if to pull Draco off his chair.
“Wha’ ‘Mione! We’re all friends now aren’t we?” He hiccuped again, “We’re all open and accepting, right Blaise?!” He called down the table.
The two had been making out for little over an hour, but every time they seemed to be getting more urgent, one of them would pull back, so as to tease and prolong their feelings of need and urgency. Arousal practically bubbling through their veins.
“I’d say you’ve suffered enough already Draco.” Harry said seriously.
Ron scoffed through his mouthful of cake.
“Mmm.”
“What?” She said, wiping her mouth on her sleeve, “I loved Lockhart!”
Harry’s hand came up to grip onto the back of Draco’s neck as the blond kissed his shoulder.
He was definitely drunk, all Harry could smell was Firewhisky.
Harry exhaled his frustration.
Harry continued to kiss along the blond’s jaw and neck, until the rise and fall of Draco’s chest began to slow.
“Does everyone know how to play?”
Harry beamed.
He smirked at Harry, who was still very much coming down from a near faint. His chest was rising and falling rapidly.
Ernie practically spilt his drink all over himself as the rest of the eighth years giggled.
Harry began sucking on Draco’s throat.
“I love your eyes Harry.”
Blaise also drank his shot, unsurprisingly. But Ron was looking at Harry half amused, half disgusted, “A uniform kink? Really mate?”
“Harry, Malfoy, why aren’t you dressed for Hogsmeade?”
Harry’s eyes stared at the exit door as he felt Hermione approach.
He had removed himself from the Cloak but Draco remained invisible beside him. When the portrait flew open, Harry motioned the Slytherin to follow him, his heart thumping in his chest as he heard many voices chatting animatedly within the nearly full common room. This was madness. It was only a little time after dinner so of course everyone would still be lively and awake.
“He shouldn’t be too much longer-”
“Yeah, which evidently makes me your superior Roonil Wazlib.”
Hermione waved her hand and cast a wordless cleaning charm over the three drunken boys. Then she, Blaise and Draco moved to help them up. Hermione grasped Ron’s hands as she pulled him to stand. Blaise ducked under Seamus’s arm and helped him up. And then before Harry could contemplate what was happening, Draco was lifting Harry up, his grip under his elbows.
“No I don’t, but I’d like to change that, if you’d like to?”
As Pansy and Blaise began to walk away from the table, Theo and Draco suddenly stood.
When he finally looked back at Harry, all he said was, “Thank you.”
Harry dug in his pocket and pulled out his Snitch, the one he caught in his mouth back in first year and the one Dumbledore left to him in his will.
Harry felt everyone’s eyes on him.
Draco.’
“Harry,” Draco said firmly, “I had to go through that, to get to where I am today. You couldn’t have helped me then, I wasn’t ready. I didn’t know what I was doing, and I didn’t know who I was. Please stop blaming yourself.”
Finally resolving to give in to his infamous recklessness, Harry thought maybe, because he was so hard and leaking already, that perhaps if he just palmed himself through his boxers, he’d come quietly and then be done with it.
They were nearing Christmas, and between waking up in a cold sweat with his scar prickling, and running through the castle to meet Draco, Harry’s body temperature seemed to be fluctuating constantly.
“Potter! What the hell?” Blaise demanded.
As Draco turned to leave, he stood next to the seated Harry, and placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder looking down at him, “Well, I can tell you that I’ve worked out what your so-called ‘gravitational pull’ means between us. When you’ve managed to work it out, let me know.”
When they broke away from each other they heard the door to the common room open behind them.
Harry choked again. Draco Malfoy, pureblood prince, knowing who David Bowie was. It was unheard of.
“I’d take Dreamless Sleep as Mother suggested but, as you put it, it’s a cop out.”
“How are you?” Harry asked as she pulled away.
“Yes Potter,” She fixed him with a stern look, “I can allow for a fifteen minute absence, but an hour?! I’m sure you’re both aware that your absences don’t go unnoticed.”
Hermione looked at him kindly, “Who knows Harry? Perhaps when all this is over, you two could come together properly.”
When the seven of them had arrived in Hogsmeade, all of their hair was swept and sprinkled with snow.
“I hope I get to play Chaser one day!”
“Draco! I know you’re in there! I just checked your room.”
“So Dean and I went up to the Room at lunch to try it out,” Seamus said quietly. “It worked. There was everything we needed.”
Harry hummed, still dizzy with the heat and intensity of this entire moment. When Draco pulled away, Harry saw a glow upon Draco’s face, his eyes were still dark and mesmerising, there was sweat on his forehead and his hair was messed up. He was irresistibly sexy, handsome, stunning, beautiful. Harry was at a complete loss for words as he just gazed into the blond’s enchanting features.
“You’re an enigma Potter.”
“Not like that Potter! Merlin. I just meant that whenever Pansy or Theo or Blaise came to stay, they’d just sleep next to me and I was able to get a whole night's sleep. Sometimes Mother slept in my bed too.”
Draco, avoiding Harry’s eyes at all costs, began to follow his friends out of the Great Hall, looking completely miserable.
“Course not,” Harry said at once, propping himself up on his elbow. “I’d say I have a hundred scars from the past seventeen years. You just get used to them I suppose.”
Ron, having apparently overheard their conversation, turned. He squeezed between Harry and Draco and threw his arm around the blond’s shoulders.
The night was going well. Everyone seemed content in each other’s company. The music still blared loudly and Neville, Dean, Blaise and Draco had joined in the dancing with the girls. Draco and Pansy held hands as they spun each other around and Harry had to keep reminding himself to stop staring before he felt his pants getting uncomfortably tight, his arousal only deepening by his drunken state.
Ron clapped the blond on the back, “You’re an alright bloke you know tha’?”
“And it all worked out in the end...And people I’d never thought I’d be friends with, well, we’re friends now, and it feels great.”
“Thanks mate!”
All the others eyed his shirt. Harry, who rarely looked in the mirror before leaving his room, only just realised he still wore Draco’s emerald Slytherin T-shirt. He thanked Merlin inwardly that Pansy didn’t happen to be with them.
When he broke away, he said, “I’d like to have a shower now, if that’s alright with you Potter.”
“It’s not a hotel Ronald. It’s a school. And just because we won the war doesn’t mean you get to stop working for the rest of your life.”
He felt once more as though he were stealing moments from another person’s life. Harry had only really ever known struggle, if it weren’t for Ron and Hermione, he doubted he would’ve actually made it this far.
“Never a dull moment with Harry Potter,” Charlie said smiling.
“‘Mioneee, why I can’t sleep with you.”
“Copped one of Fred and George giving me the finger! How do you suppose that works?!” Ron said.
Draco’s pride was too strong for him to sneak into the Gryffindor dormitories, so it was always Harry sneaking around in his cloak at night times, heading to the dungeons. Otherwise, due to Harry’s infamous nightly walks of the castle, the two had chosen designated areas where they met in secret, obscured by the shadows and hidden amongst the nooks and crannies of the ancient stoney architecture.
“Blimey what’s happened to the Slytherin’s?” Dean asked.
Before he’d barely finished the sentence, Hermione flung her arms around his neck and Ron clapped him on the back.
Eventually, Harry noticed that it seemed to be the Slytherin’s that were doing the most work toward befriending the students from the other houses. It had become, in Harry’s mind, another one of those unwritten rules where the Gryffindors (apart from Hermione), Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws sat back and waited for the Slytherin’s to come to them and make the initiative. But this was an unwritten rule that Harry simply couldn’t abide. Draco had put himself out there so much for Harry’s friends, even though Harry had no idea why (he secretly hoped Draco was doing it on Harry’s behalf, but he and Draco still hadn’t had that conversation). But nevertheless, Draco was really trying his best, like Ron said, to show that he was sorry for his years of bullying through action rather than words, by being open, by helping Hermione and in turn, accepting her help. Because of these gestures, Harry resolved from then on to make more time for not only Draco, but the other Slytherin’s as well.
Draco chuckled, “I didn’t know you were a Bowie fan.”
Draco reached out under the covers and took Harry’s hand.
-----------------
Harry risked a glance at Draco, who seemed to be determinedly avoiding any eye contact from Ron, as if expecting the redhead to strike at any moment.
“I’m not saying anything. I just want you to be honest with yourself.”
Draco brought his hand up to grip Harry’s hair, his hips bucked up into Harry’s as came.
Harry knew that his best chance of escape was to leave right now. Nobody beyond Draco’s bed hangings seemed to be awake, the dorm was still quiet and relatively dark. And yet, Harry found himself completely immovable. Entirely stuck on the spot, with Draco’s hand in his own and the warmth of his body flushed up against Harrys.
Harry just shrugged in agreement. Hermione knew everything.
There was that raspy voice. And Harry instinctively ran into the boy’s arms.
“No,” Harry said into Draco’s shirt, “Please don’t let go.”
“Thanks Hermione,” he gave her a warm smile.
Ron and Harry broke away from Hermione and Luna as the two went to join the other dancing girls.
“Why?” Potter crossed his ankles, peering curiously at Draco. “Don’t you want to see if it works?”
“I know.”
Draco had been terrified. He thought Potter might’ve been terrified, too, but then again Potter wasn’t terrified of anything. He’d proven that time and time again.
“There’s only one way, so we must be,” Theo answered from ahead, but he didn’t sound too confident.
“In Luton?” Lovegood asked brightly.
“Yes, clawed feet.”
She frowned sympathetically. “Greg saved you some macaroni in case you get hungry later. He feels horrible.”
it was Harry Potter. What other Harry could it possibly be? How many Harrys were in the world? Draco only knew of one off the top of his head, and that one just happened to also be the only Harry that mattered. The only Harry that seemed to ever matter. He didn’t shake Greg, though, partially because that would be unfair to him, and partially because Draco didn’t think he could move if he tried.
“Are you throwing rocks at me?”
“You’ll have to ask her that yourself. Now would you please let me in so we can get this over with?”
“Hm,” she grunted, leaning back and stirring her drink with her tiny plastic straw. “I might have a theory, but I can’t be sure without knowing more. It’s not likely.”
Draco was pale and washed out under the moonlight, luminescing gently against the stirring black background, and his small, twitching smile seemed to make him glow even more. Harry liked it when he smiled. “Very much so.”
“I know you well enough,” Harry assured, tilting his head slightly to press a kiss into the fabric of Draco’s shoulder. Then, remembering the words that had been rattling around his brain for nearly a year, he added, “It only takes a moment to decide you love something.”
The look Theo gave him had been exhausted and beaten down, like all the life had been drained from his body. “We can’t report them to MLE if MLE are the ones sending them.”
“Shakespeare is far,
Pansy sat in the chair opposite Draco, looking far more graceful than he probably did, crossing her ankles and leaning on one elbow so she looked carefully casual. That left Greg and Theo to take the couch, though they didn’t look too pleased about it—Greg looked as white as a sheet as he sat down in the space next to where Lovegood was perched, sloping sideways so he didn’t accidentally bump into her.
Draco tugged on his hand, sticking out his bottom lip. “Five more minutes.”
“I’m Luna,” she said when she finally reached them, holding out her soft, pale hand to shake Theo’s. Theo looked terrified, but he shook it anyway. “It’s nice to finally meet you.”
Draco was stricken.
If the house looked similar to Harry’s from the outside, the inside was an entirely different world altogether. Whereas Harry’s kitchen was cluttered with over-eager houseplants, hanging copper pots, and cheerfully patterned crockery, Malfoy’s was practically a wasteland. The counters were empty and coated with dust, smattered with small circular rings where water glasses or mugs must have been set down at one point. The dining table was home to one meager-looking fruit bowl that didn’t hold any fruit—only a ring of keys, a pile of loose change, and a crumpled takeout menu.
“Right. Our whereabouts.”
Potter, the git, looked down at his hand, then back up. “At your window, actually.”
he thought fuzzily.
“What do you think?” Pansy asked when Draco stepped through the arched entryway to the kitchen, knuckles white over the strap of his rucksack. There was dust on the dining table, dust on the countertops. Dust everywhere he looked.
Around the corner, there was another set of stairs—less rickety, but just as dusty as the ones in the basement—that crawled up into where he assumed the bedrooms were. “Phoebe?” he called, then sagged in relief when he heard the telltale click of paws and the jingle of metal dog tags. She appeared at the top of the stairs and whined happily when she saw Harry, bumbling down them ungracefully and nearly slipping on the hardwood. “Stupid animal,” Harry said affectionately, rubbing her mane and mussing up the fur around her ears. “Let’s get out of here, shall we?”
“Oh, good! Where—”
“Draco,” Hermione repeated softly. Her hand came up again, touching his shoulder and rubbing up to his neck comfortingly. “You’ve been side-eyeing him all evening. What’s going on there?”
Draco asked shakily, “Is everyone else inside?”
“Easier said than done.”
Taking a deep, meditative breath, Draco turned away from the clearing and began heading down the beaten path that led to the ravine situated a few minutes away from the house, where Pansy liked to have a swim on occasion. She was insane for doing so in the dead middle of October at seven in the morning, but every time Draco bugged her about it, she claimed that she ran “warm-blooded” like the rest of her family. He never bothered pointing out that every human being on Earth ran warm-blooded.
On the far edge of the clearing was a house not unlike the one they were staying at, though it seemed a fair bit less run down. The paint wasn’t chipping and the roof wasn’t sloped in the center, and the backyard was well-manicured and fresh, looking much more healthy than the one across the property line. Draco wondered bitterly why theirs couldn’t look like that.
“Pardon?”
Harry followed his movement and looked back towards the bar, where Luna and Ron were engaged in some spirited conversation together and Parkinson was holding onto a ruffled-looking Nott with one arm and a flushed Draco with the other. Harry's eyes couldn’t help but linger on the latter; his button-up shirt was wrinkled and untucked, his hair mussed up. Harry’s heart thumped loud and hard against his ribcage, but he looked away before Draco could see him looking.
“I’ll take the trees over here?” Luna asked, dragging her ladder past Harry to a small grove facing East.
“Normal times,” Harry promised. “No more one a.m. non-emergencies.”
“Confused about what?”
“And you’re not subtle.”
“I’m not your responsibility.”
Pansy raised her eyebrows. “Should we go?”
“Like I said, I’ll do my best,” Harry said lightly, nudging him out of the way so he could get a better look at the sequence of runes. They starkly contrasted with the grimy brick compartment they were set into, pulsing faintly with light and casting odd shadows on the cobwebs in the darkened corners. It was true that Harry was absolute pants when it came to rune magic—especially given that he hadn’t dealt with any since he moved out to the countryside—but as he looked closer, he managed to recognise a couple of the more basic symbols. Hermione would’ve been able to translate the entire thing just by looking at it, but unfortunately that wasn’t an option right now. “Can you translate that first sequence?” Harry asked, slipping his wand out of his sleeve and tapping on the top line of runes.
Draco shrugged. “I’m making you dinner.”
“The dog!” Pansy said, swinging her feet off the table to get up and peer out through the square window of the back door. “If we’re going with Theo’s ‘hypothesis,’ then she probably belongs to the wizards next door.”
“What are you gonna do,
Draco was shamelessly ogling at Harry as he passionately talked about his future plans, trying to restrain himself form pulling Harry aside and snogging him senseless.
Potter smiled at him, reaching into the pocket of his trousers. “Oh, actually I have something of yours,” he pulled out a polished piece of hawthorn wood out of his pocket.
“But it’d happened while Malfoy was still in the Hospital Wing.” The boy argued.
Draco stared at Potter’s outstretched hand. His long fingers, his square nails, the beautiful outline of the veins under his tanned skin.  He’d wanted to take this hand for so long. He’d dreamed about it, and he’d been rejected once. He wouldn’t miss his chance again.
Harry finally pulled his mouth away with a loud pop, his lips shiny with spit and Draco’s come from his previous orgasm. He knelt between Draco’s legs and shoved his boxers down to his thighs. Draco’s mouth watered at the sight of his fully erected and leaking penis.
Draco could feel the hair on Harry’s body stand on end as he put a hand on either side of his hips and wrapped his wet lips around his cock.
. His mind helpfully supplies.
“You didn’t have to intervene, Potter,” Draco said, fighting to keep his voice even. It was so hard for him to look at Potter without recalling that one, blissful day that they’d spent together; one that
“Come on, people. There’s no victim and nobody needs to be sorry for anybody, okay? It’s just a game. No big deal”
Hey everyone!
Six days.
Blaise turned around, eyebrows raised. “Your goofy boyfriend. Who else?”
“No,” Potter straightened and cleared his throat, face still red. “Sorry, Professor.”
“Just taking a walk,” Draco shrugged.
could not bring a coat with you in a cold weather like this just so it wouldn’t ruin your look,” Potter shook his head, reaching into his Mokeskin pouch and pulling out a soft, worn-out piece of clothing for Draco.
“Shut up, I’m perfectly fine,” Draco sniffed, his teeth clattering together.
He knelt beside his bed and pulled out his trunk from under it.
Draco turned towards the source of the noise to find Potter and Weasley each bent over their own cauldron, shoulders shaking with laughter.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “We dated for a couple of months back in Sixth Year, but it didn’t work out for us. We’re still close friends though, but not together anymore.”
“What is there to say?” Draco tries for the coldest tone he can muster. “It was a stupid game you morons had decided to play. I had nothing to do with it.”
that the other team wouldn’t use up all the hot water. He suspected that his nose might actually freeze off if he didn’t get a hot shower in the next five minutes. They were passing the Hufflepuff locker room when Draco saw MacMillan’s lanky figure – broom in hand and still in his Quidditch robes, looking angry – storm out of there and away.
Potter rolls his eyes at him again but this time, the bright emerald orbs are sparkling with mischief. “Fine.”
“Thanks but I think I’ll just stay here. I’m not really in the mood for Hogsmeade.”
?” Draco asked, certain Blaise had mistaken him for someone else.
“Pardon?” Draco asks, confused.
“Yeah,” Draco’s mouth twitched in a small smile. “See? It couldn’t have been you, then. And it’s not your fault that Weasley chose this job either, love. It was
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy.” Borgin gave him another bow and said nothing else about the matter like Draco knew he wouldn’t. He was about to pay Borgin a fortune for the items, after all. And as far as Draco knew, his father was the only one left who was still willing to risk the purchase of dark artifacts from Borgin (Where did he even hide those things anyways?). He was not a costumer Borgin could afford to lose.
“There you are. Pansy’s been waiting for ya.”
“Keep whom waiting?” Draco tilted his head.
“So what? He could have sent some of his friends to do the job for him.”
“Draco,” Pansy’s voice is gentler now as she puts a warm hand on his, and squeezes. “I don’t think that’s how he thinks of you anymore. Things have changed so much in the past few months. You’ve saved each other’s lives, he’s spoken up for you in your trials, you’ve apologized for everything and he’s accepted it. You’re not rivals anymore, Draco. For the first time, you actually have a chance with him now.”
“You seemed to have enough problems to deal with already, so…” Pansy shrugged.
Standing in the middle of the room in utter confusion, Draco caught sight of his own reflection in the mirror and had to do a double take. He looked…different. More
“So, what do you think?” Harry asked, brushing the pad of his thumb across Draco’s jawline.
“Seriously?” Blaise asked, dark eyebrows raised.
Draco looked into Harry’s eyes, gulped down his fears and nodded, not even surprised anymore to realize that his answer was genuine.
Potter’s eyes widened in a mixture of surprise and fury but just as he opened his mouth to protest, he was cut-off by Pansy who stood beside their desk, looking between the two of them with a suspicious look in her eyes. “Potter, do you mind? You’re in my seat.”
He popped open the tiny glass, closed his eyes and before he could think twice about it, he held it up to his mouth.
“So,” Harry stepped closer, rubbing his hands together for warmth. “You’re going home for Christmas?”
Draco’s breath was coming in short and shallow gasps. He stood there for several seconds, letting the shock of what he’d just remembered wash over him. He had broken his promise to himself and taken the Sweet Agony. And if the potion had truly worked as it was supposed to, it could only mean that at the moment, Draco was in an alternate reality with an altogether different – and by the looks of it,
“Captains, shake hands please!” Madam Hooch gestured for Potter and Greg to step forward.
Draco blinked his eyes open, sitting up on the sofa he’d fall sleep on waiting for him to return. He’d been worried, Draco remembered as the drowsiness wore off.
moaning. He cannot blame himself.
Draco pursed his lips. At least the other team was just as bad as them. He rubbed his hands together for warmth, his breath forming tiny white clouds in the cold December air.
“Yeah, I think it’s amazing.” Draco tells her, trying to sound like he’d been listening.
“Professor I really need to go, I’m late for class. I’ll catch you later. Sorry. Have a great day!” Draco is already halfway across the corridor from Slughorn and shouting at his direction. He doesn’t hear Slughorn’s response over the pounding of his heart in his ears as he pushes people out of his way to DADA class.
Since the Eighth Years were not allowed to join their houses’ Quidditch teams, McGonagall had permitted them to assemble two teams of only Eighth Year students to play each other, Gryffindor and Hufflepuff in one team, and Slytherin and Ravenclaw in the other. There was even a match scheduled for them in two weeks. But as far as Draco knew, the number of Eighth Year students who actually knew how to play Quidditch wasn’t even enough to form a single team.
“Good day, Harry,” Draco turned around, walking away from him and out of the library.
“Hi,” Harry replied, gaze bright in the churning darkness. He was fiddling with the sleeves of his coat, tugging at them in a way that was almost nervous, except he was Harry Potter and Harry Potter didn’t get nervous.
“Very rare. They aren’t found in real life much, only in children's books or old wives’ tales. But I think it’s one of the only ways to explain her behavior.”
chair. “Parkinson’s here too?” Harry asked him, voice laden with malice. “Did you happen to bring the entire Slytherin dormitory with you, or did you just hand-pick the racist ones?”
“I don’t know. I guess not.”
Then—as if this day couldn’t get more unimaginable—Lovegood smiled earnestly and asked, “Would you boys like to come in for tea?”
“He’s—” The words felt sticky on Harry’s tongue, and all he managed to get out was the word, “Alley.”
Harry’s eyes flicked back to Draco’s, and then their eye contact was so intense that Draco almost wished he’d look away again and make it stop.
Potter’s face did the thing again; a dark, bashful shade of red bloomed across his cheeks and the bridge of his nose. He looked down at the table, twisting his mouth with apparent frustration. “Magic.”
Suppressing another eye-roll, Harry adjusted the tip of his wand and began murmuring a low string of syllables that wasn’t exactly Latin, but sounded eerily similar to it. It was something Germanic that Hermione had taught him years ago, and it sounded a bit clunky coming out of his mouth, but he didn’t have the energy to care. He just wanted to get this over with.
“I’d really rather not.”
“Come to bed. It’s late.”
“Is he really a national treasure?” Greg wondered out loud.
“Obviously. That would be stupid of you, and even if you’re a piece of shit, you’re certainly not stupid.” She leaned closer, lowering her voice. “Don’t let him tie you up in knots again. We’re not sixteen.”
“So?”
Draco blew air through his nose and closed his eyes. It felt like there was a hole in his chest. “I never thought I’d see him again.”
“Muggle clothes,” Draco had sighed as she drew back, casting a forlorn look at his obnoxiously red uniform shirt. “I came straight from work.”
“Yes,” came the stiff answer, this time from Malfoy himself. He wasn’t meeting Harry’s eyes, staring intently at the knotted wood table instead. His knuckles were nearly as white as his hair. “They’re anti-Apparition. We didn’t know other wizards lived around here.”
“What?” he said incredulously, not quite believing her. “Six a.m.? But, how did you know—?”
Harry laughed faintly, then turned to pick the apple hanging red and glossy right in front of his nose as Luna started off towards the next tree. It was true, he supposed. A little dirt had certainly never hurt him.
they said.
Luna looked up and around at him, bracing herself on the stripped wood, hair falling into her eyes. “No!” she called back.
“Do you think Malfoy’s attractive?”
“Excuse me?” Harry replied, nearly hitting his head on a branch.
Draco studied the wood above his head; the boards were splintered and sagging, but not in a neglected way. In a well-loved way.
“That color does look nice on you,” Luna pointed out blithely from behind Harry. “But we really should get going, now. Ron and Hermione have most likely arrived already.”
Draco nodded.
“What?” Harry’s eyes were wide, and he was slowly pulling away now, which was not Draco’s intention at all. “I can take it off, if it’s bothering you.”
A short, silent beat passed, like everyone in the room but Luna had inhaled sharply at the mention of Narcissa Malfoy. “She… does,” Malfoy answered slowly, fingers curling over his armrests as if he was bracing himself for something.
“Come to have a swim?” she called from below as Draco hauled himself up the edge of the ravine, one foot planted on a large, dented boulder that stuck out over the water. She was bobbing around in the alcove across from him, her dark, choppy hair pulled back into a mini ponytail to prevent it from getting wet.
“They’re here,” Luna answered loudly, pointing over Harry’s shoulder down the skinny marble-topped bar. “Over there, at the end.”
“Shoes are oppressive!” she called back, and really, Harry should’ve expected that, but he shook his head anyway. If she stepped on any mushy fallen apples, that was her problem.
“You’re pretty unforgettable,” Greg blurted, apparently shocked out of his stupor. His face turned as red as the apples nestled in the trees, like he hadn’t meant to say that out loud.
“Is that what’s happening?” Harry asked flatly.
“Ignore her. I’m getting them a cab.”
“You’re disgusting,” he told her kindly.
“Yes,” Potter said, looking pained. “As long as you give my dog back, yes.”
“Exactly.”
It was then that he noticed the cylindrical container tucked in one of Draco’s elbows—a container that looked exactly like the one Luna had sent him. Draco cocked his eyebrow knowingly.
“With where you are.”
He supposed it was also weird because he’d only owned Phoebe for a few months, and she hadn’t really felt like
“I know,” Harry had replied, and it sort of felt like his own heart was breaking as he said it.
Draco’s spoon clattered, splashing his freshly-ironed shirt with milk. “He’s done
“We need someone to fix the wards,” Nott said stiffly. “We—we can’t do it ourselves.”
“Hermione,” he shot back, mimicking her tone.
Harry shook his head, holding up his hand to stop her. “I’ve got room. ‘S no bother, really. Are you staying, Lu?” He twisted to look over at Luna, who had just returned from dancing and was slurping zealously at a tall glass of what looked like either lemon water or vodka. Hopefully lemon water.
Pansy came up between the two of them and rested her sharp chin on Draco’s shoulder, arms settling around his waist, short hair brushing roughly against his cheek. “Home sweet home,” she declared, the words rolling off her tongue dully.
She nodded vehemently, but the action almost made her keel over into the opening of the henhouse, so she stopped and steadied herself. “Yes, please!”
“Can I go get her?”
To his surprise, she wasn’t in the foyer when he pushed inside, and she didn’t come running when he called her name up the stairs. She also wasn’t in the kitchen, or the living room, or the bathroom, or the backyard, and Harry felt a beat of panic thrum through his chest. He scanned the orchard and called for her again, but there was no movement other than the slight rustle of the trees in the mild wind.
“I… yes.”
Ron and Hermione left before noon the following day—far too soon, in Harry’s opinion—but not too soon for Ron to make an entire breakfast spread complete with pancakes and French toast. “The only suitable cure for a hangover,” he declared with a flourish of his spatula, earning an exasperated look from his fiance and an excited clap from Luna.
A beat passed. Then, hesitantly, “What if I told you I could give your magic back?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, trailing off as Draco finished knotting his laces and stood up from the stairs, swaying. He steadied himself against the balustrade.
Standing at the foot of the porch, amid the stalks of grass and the overgrown beds of swaying white wildflowers, was Draco Malfoy, bent slightly at the waist and petting Harry’s dog.
“Why would Luna put you up to this?”
Harry scoffed to himself. “Do you? That’s a bit hard to believe, given our entire bloody history.”
“Draco,” she said again, harsher this time, lifting her chin. “You’re as much my responsibility as I am yours. We look out for each other, don’t we?”
“I’ll go get her dish,” she decided, standing up and stretching wide. There was a large smudge of mud streaked across her ankle below the cinched part of her makeshift trousers, and while it didn’t seem to be bothering her, Harry shot a quick
It was hard. But it was also inexplicably, unfathomably easy, and he supposed that was the charm of it.
“Of course you did,” Harry said, rolling his eyes and running his hands down her head to ruffle the part below her neck. She was a purebred Shetland sheepdog with long legs and light, fluffy fur that stuck out around her ears and down her back, colored grey and brown with specks of white splattered across her stomach. She wasn’t young, but she certainly wasn’t old, and Harry had owned her for about the same amount of time that he’d owned the house. “Daft dog. Are you hungry?”
“You should be.”
“Liar.”
jumper. “I think, maybe, you should do it again.”
“Not as much as I thought I would,” Draco said truthfully, picking up his spoon again and swirling the remaining broth around at the bottom of his bowl.
Finally, the mounds of greenery began to clear and the canopy above slowly got thinner, yellow light beginning to permeate through and make patterns on the leaf-coated ground. Through the trees, Draco caught a glimpse of a flattened meadow surrounded by an extensive crop of apple trees, bright and tall compared to the bedraggled oaks and sunken ferns of the woods.
Harry thought. “‘M fine,” he answered fuzzily, and then he heard a rustle of clothing and felt Hermione sit down next to him. “Nauseous.”
Draco decided halfway through dinner while sitting through a suffocating bout of silence, Potter refusing to meet his gaze across the way as he poked quietly at his meal. Potter probably didn’t even remember the alley incident—he’d been more drunk than Draco was, after all.
“Where have you been?” Harry exclaimed when he saw her trotting towards them from the North corner of the orchard, brown tail wagging and pink tongue lolling out of her mouth. She answered his question by loping forward and shoving her head under his hand, eager for attention.
“Mm,” Draco mumbles into the pillow, incoherent. “Straight people.”
“I’m not hungry.”
“It’s Saturday, remember?” She leaned back on her palms, a corner of her cardigan slipping down her shoulder. She was wearing about fifteen or so necklaces, silver and gold clashing together and glinting around her neckline. “I came to help you with the orchard, like always. And to say hello to the little ones, of course!” Her back straightened suddenly, expression eager and hopeful. “Have they opened their eyes yet?”
Draco’s eyes flashed, before he jumped off the desk, “What did you tell them?”
“Oi!” Blaised yelled from the back of the pack. “You might wanna check if Draco’s hurt!”
It was just past midnight and he’d only just finished his excruciating Occlumency with Snape. His clothes were soaked in sweat, with his invisibility cloak draped over him as he ran down the darkened castle stairs towards the Slytherin common room.
“Well, I’ll admit,” Draco said, his heart slamming itself against his ribcage in anticipation. “This
“Hey, Malfoy.” Suddenly, someone sat down beside him and Draco – being caught in the act of eavesdropping – couldn’t help but feel a sudden jolt of guilt and discomfort in the pit of his stomach.
“I definitely do,”
?” Pansy shouted, flinging her arms around violently to keep the angry insects away.
After a few seconds of staring, Draco finally managed to turn his attention back to his potion. He carefully stirred the now steaming liquid three times clockwise and five times anticlockwise. The potion was starting to change color to dark orange when another burst of laughter snapped Draco’s focus away again.
” Draco swallowed, cradling his suddenly burning cheek in his palm and looking up at the grayish sky to avoid Potter’s gleaming gaze. It had started to snow.
Draco gives her the closest thing to a smile he can manage and spends the next five minutes absentmindedly looking for his DADA book in his backpack before Pansy finally pulls it out for him.
“I didn’t know it back then, or maybe I just didn’t want to admit it but,” Potter looked back at him, the ghost of a sad smile on his lips. “When you refused to identify me for them in the Malfoy Manner, even though you knew it was me, I … that was when I forgave you.”
“Malfoy, don’t be so stubborn, you’re visibly shivering,” Padma Patil rolled her eyes.
“Yeah, probably,” Potter said with a soft chuckle. “Oh, you have a …” Potter reached out and brushed the pad of his thumb on Draco’s frozen cheek, making the breath catch in his throat. “There was a snowflake on your face.”
, Draco,” Harry groaned as he moved, the deep sound mingling with Draco’s whines and echoing around the small room. “So good.”
“But I
” Harry said firmly – instantly – making Draco’s stomach flutter with butterflies. “You know I would have.”
A shadow moves at the corner of Draco’s sight but he barely sees it because his heart is suddenly back-flipping behind his ribcage when Potter bursts out laughing at something Finnigan just said. An open laugh, with a deep, delighted sound roaring out of his chest and his head thrown back in mirth, which gives Draco a clear view of a lightly tanned, strong neck and a tantalizing Adam’s apple and he’s just so, so fucking done with this shit, when…
“Okay,” Draco said in a flat tone, head held high. “Anyway, I have to go now,”
Chamber of Secrets???”
” Pansy sneered. “But I’m gonna pretend like it was. It helps soothe my urge to want to slap some bloody sense into you.”
“Miss Parkinson, I think Mr. Malfoy is right. He needs to rest. You should go now,” Pomfrey intervened. “You two can talk about this once he’s discharged.”
?” the second girl titled her head at him. “If you so much as point that wand at any of us you’ll be sleeping in Azkaban tonight. You think we don’t know that?”
Draco.
“That’s actually a good idea,” Granger nodded. “I know you two wanted to be subtle about the whole thing, but this might actually get Rita off your back.”
Draco looked down at his frozen hands. He was shivering, but it didn’t bother him.
“What?” Draco’s eyes go wide at that, whatever Pansy is thinking cannot possibly be a good idea. “Shit, Pansy. I thought we were talking hypothetical. Whatever twisted idea you’re having right now, please forget it. I can’t have him know how I feel!”
“Mate, it’s already past eight. Aren’t you going to get dressed?”
“Think about it Justin.” He heard a girl say. “It
Draco mentally slapped himself. What was he doing? He was supposed to be talking to Potter and making things better, not to further piss him off! Otherwise what was the point of all this trouble?
Draco swallowed, taking a step back.
“No, please.” Draco shook his head. “Not in there.”
Oh god, what has Draco done? What’s he gonna do now?
right now!” Draco said, covering his mouth with his hand.
Potter smiles into the kiss before deepening it further and Draco can only hold on tight, giving all of himself to the man who is kissing Draco like he’s the only one on god’s green earth who matters to him.
Draco was gripping the headboard so hard his knuckles were white, his back arching off the bed with a loud moan as Harry lifted his thighs to press a firm lick across his crack.
?” Draco hissed, fighting to keep his voice down.
Wait, that’s not how this works! Potter is not supposed to ask Draco whether he wants to be kissed by him! The whole point of this plan was for Draco to kiss Potter
“Really?” Potter raised his eyebrows. “Don’t you need it yourself?”
“What is that?” Draco asked, unable to take his eyes off of the ring.
“Does it work for you?” Draco asked, not wanting to show just how much he cared about the answer to that question.
“It was a total
“No, wait…” Draco called after him, but Potter’s tall figure had already disappeared around the corner.
Harry sighed again, his eyes opening and his shoulders relaxing a bit. He leaned in and rested their foreheads together.
Draco turned his head away, unable to look into her pleading eyes for a moment longer. He had seen. He remembered everything. “I’m really tired.”
when he wants to,” Potter shook his head with a board smile.
Draco was hugging himself tightly, praying to
“What makes you say that? Of course I do,” Potter sounded offended.
“Wow, I’m sold,” Blaise deadpanned, standing up. “Come on, people. Let’s go win this thing. For the showers!”
“Harry, we’ve got to take him to the Hospital Wing,” said Hermione Granger.
“I don’t know how he is since I’m here at Hogwarts with you, in case you haven’t noticed. But isn’t he at the Manor? Where else is he supposed to be?” Pansy frowned. “Isn’t that how a house arrest sentence works?”
Draco hates to wonder.
“We’re doing this for
yes,” Draco said, winding a leg around Harry’s torso and adjusting himself so he could push down on Harry’s fingers.
a good Healer too,” Draco said in a matter-of-fact tone.
“No you’re not. At least not anymore, and that’s enough for me.” The words sounded so honest when they came out of Harry’s mouth, like they were pouring right out of his heart. “And I never said you were perfect. Neither of us is perfect, Draco. We’re flawed, but we complete each other. We don’t have to be perfect individuals to be perfect
“You don’t need to worry about me, Pans,” Draco told her. “The Manor’s my home and they are my family. I’ll be okay, I promise.”
sure. The day that he’d left the Manor for Hogwarts four months ago, he’d been certain that he never wanted to go back to that place ever again. But so many things had happened in the past few months, which had taught Draco that running away from his past could never be the answer for him; if he wanted to change anything about himself, the first step would be to accept the person he used to be. And Malfoy Manor and his family were a big and inseparable part of that person.
He was ten minutes early for Charms, and the classroom was mostly empty except for a couple of Ravenclaws who didn’t even look up from their books when he entered. Draco threw his bag at the foot of a desk in the back of the classroom and sat down, crossing his arms on the desk and resting his forehead between them. He could still feel a dull pain in his chest and the start of a headache on the back of his eyes.
Becoming a Death Eater had been the gravest mistake Draco had made in his life. Draco was certain that if he were to be given a chance to make only one difference in his past, he would have turned his back on Voldemort and refused the Mark. How was it possible that even here, in the supposedly best version of his life, Draco still bore that hideous brand of disgrace?
“I’d think twice about that, Parkinson,” a third girl said threateningly. “Do you think you can take all of us by yourself?”
“No,” Draco said desperately. “You’re making me sound innocent. I’m not innocent, Harry. I’m not some perfect, pure-hearted kid who’d tragically fell victim to the hands of bad people. I’m one of those people myself.”
“It’s not really out of generosity, Malfoy,” Potter shrugged. “It’s because I simply don’t have the emotional strength to hold grudges against people anymore. I’m just too tired for it.”
Now Draco was pissed too. “Because – as always – you’re meddling into something that is clearly not your business, Potter!” He hadn’t realized he’d been speaking loudly and moving his hands around until he found himself in the center of everyone’s attention and he immediately regretted it; clearing his throat awkwardly. “Great,” Draco said, lowering his voice so that only Potter could hear him. “Now you made me look like an idiot.”
“Goldstein, you moron! What are you doing? You’re supposed to protect the fucking hoop!” Draco shouted at his team’s Keeper who had neatly thrown himself out of the Quaffle’s way, but his words got swallowed by the delighted cheers of the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff audience. He sighed and closed his eyes; this was by far the worst game of Quidditch Draco had ever been a part of.
Hermione grabbed his hand and squeezed it beside him.
They rolled simultaneously to face each other. And as Harry gazed into Draco’s grey eyes, he no longer knew what he felt. It was as if, by staring fiercely at each other, they were both trying to silently convey their feelings, because they were both either too proud or too afraid to really voice the truth. Harry reached under the covers and reconnected their hands. It was a while before either of them spoke. It seemed that the past year was finally catching up with them and they were realising mutely the mess they had gotten themselves into.
Harry spluttered, but before he could respond, he turned to see McGonagall bustling into the office.
“First Malfoy sleeping on Harry, now Zabini offering us drinks!” Neville said.
When Ron and Harry returned from the common room, clad in fresh, dry, warm clothes, Harry saw that Blaise had joined Luna and Draco.
“Yes you do,” Harry said sternly, his green eyes glaring at him.
“You were always a restless idiot...And I was always looking for a fight...We were the perfect match.”
Harry let out a breathy laugh as he shook his head slowly, “God, it all seems so dumb when you look back at it.”
That night in the common room as Ron had just stalked up the stairs to bed leaving Hermione and Harry by the fire, Hermione spoke.
Notably, Ron looked entirely put out; his head resting on folded his arms face down on the table.
“But best be off now, I have a feeling we’re late for breakfast.”
Draco and Harry kissed for a long time. Their hands roaming delicately between one another. Their passionate and fiery magic intertwining. It's residue laid bare on their bodies.
Draco chuckled against Harry’s jaw, “Trust me. There were plenty of times when we’d been fighting and I’d have to rush back to the common room for a quick wank.”
“Here,” and suddenly Draco had taken Harry’s teacup out of his hand and placed it on the side table. Draco then waved his wand and Harry felt the wetness from his tea that had soaked into his school shirt instantly disappear.
The blond sat up swiftly beneath Harry’s weight, and before Harry could react, Draco had gripped Harry’s collar with one hand bringing their faces close together. Harry gasped, and then Draco’s head was beside Harry’s ear, his breath caressing the tanned skin of Harry’s neck.
Draco stalked toward the door.
---------
Harry didn’t need to be asked twice. He leant down in a flash and reconnected their lips, the two of them moaning into the kiss.
“We know you like to walk the castle at night Harry, but Ron said he’s heard you leave your room almost every night for the past month.”
Harry frowned, “Right sorry.”
“Dare.”
“Right. Draco, why did you let me in your room?” Harry said before he could stop himself.
He rubbed his eyes and then looked up and everyone surrounding him.
The chatter around the table immediately subdued. Ron, Dean and Seamus looked between Harry and Pansy with eager grins on their faces.
“Now get inside, leave your brooms in the Entrance Hall and get to dinner before it’s all gone.”
“To be honest I don’t remember dreaming much at all after that.”
“Then why have you been avoiding me?!”
When they all had taken their seats again, countless silver platters mounted with all kinds of food filled the table.
“Yes Harry.”
Harry suddenly felt guilty. Ron’s parents had gifted him something so generous, he knew he should visit them on Christmas Day.
Harry, I can’t express enough how much Teddy reminds me of you. I already know he’ll be in Gryffindor, I’m sure his father will be happy about that :)
“Well done mate.”
Harry wrapped his arms around the Slytherin, and they stood, simply holding each other for what felt like eternity.
Harry had received many gifts; ‘A Teacher's Guide to Defence Against the Dark Arts,’ from a smiling Hermione, a brand new Slytherin T-shirt from a cackling Ron, a new set of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes products from George, a large tea mug adorned with the letter H on it from Hagrid, which he’d evidently made himself, and a gift voucher to Eeylops Owl Emporium from Mr and Mrs Weasley, attached with a note that said:
Harry spluttered and choked. He was hunched over between the brunette and the redhead.
“Draco, how did you know-?
“Yum,” He smiled.
Harry couldn’t help himself. He came up behind the boy as Draco checked himself in the mirror, and snaked his arm around his middle.
“Stop calling us kids. You’re only two years older than us!” Ron said indignantly.
“We know this is a sad day for you Harry, but I thought I could do more than just be with you this year, considering we’re no longer distracted by a brew of Polyjuice Potion or Triwizard Tournaments.”
To Draco’s confusion, Weasley and Granger don’t look shocked or disgusted by what’s about to happen in the slightest. The two of them only share a brief glance; a strange, unnerving smile forming on Granger’s lips.
“Goddammit Goldstein,” Draco swore.
“Morning, Harry,” Draco answered impassively, putting the heavy, leather-bound book about the history of charms back on its shelf.
“Didn’t think so,” Potter murmured smugly before turning Draco around and capturing his lips in a hot kiss. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut as he leaned into it.
decision to make.”
“What do you think, Malfoy?” Weasley called, snapping Draco out of his head. Draco quickly looked away from Potter, his mouth suddenly very dry.
“Yes. The potion needs to complete its process, so I’m afraid Mr. Malfoy is going to have to spend tonight here in the Hospital Wing.” This was Madam Pomfrey. Draco’s eyes fluttered open.

“Merlin, another accident and the man would earn his own private room in Mungo’s labeled:
Potter’s eyebrows draw together in a thoughtful manner, he’s not laughing anymore. “I don’t think it’s that simple, though. You didn’t kiss me just for the sake of it. I think you kissed me because you like me.”
“Only
Draco narrows his eyes at her suspiciously, Pansy’s black eyes have the same evil twinkles they always have when she is about to get people in trouble. “What are you saying?”
he was Harry Potter’s boyfriend? How was that even possible? What kind of a weird, utterly mental reality
Borgin immediately recognized Draco, falling into a deep curtsey. “Young Mr. Malfoy! How delightful it is to see you here once again. It’s been a long time.”
Harry nodded, taking off his glasses to rub at his red-rimmed eyes. There were always emergencies at St. Mungo’s, but some were worse than the others. This had obviously been one of them.
Draco was walking the hallways of the Third Floor, looking for Pansy. They were supposed to meet there after class, but he couldn’t find her. As he rounded one corner, he heard what was unmistakably Pansy’s voice, though he was still too far away to hear what she was saying. He took a few steps forward, but stopped when he saw Pansy, cornered by a group of Ravenclaw girls who didn’t seem friendly at all.
Kudos and comments are welcome!

“I know, right?” Granger returned, shaking her head. “Why can’t they just leave you guys alone for a while?”
A huff of humorless laughter escaped Draco’s lips. “Can’t you see, Professor? This will never end.” Draco’s fists were clenching the fabric of his trousers. “We’ve fought in different sides of a bloody

“Merlin, you’re fast. I’m glad I saw you here. I was hoping to talk to you about your last week’s essay. Do you have a minute?”  Slughorn is slightly out of breath.
“Nothing,” Draco shook his head, trying so hard to suppress his excitement, Salazar-
“So what, Potter?” Draco spits out, he hasn’t felt this humiliated in a long time and he’s certain that his face looks as red as a tomato. “Congratu-fucking-lations, you got it. I wanted to kiss you once just to know how it’d feel, so I did. Happy?”
” She spat out before walking away and storming out of the door.
Draco puts a hand on his heaving chest, trying to even out his breathing before he walks inside. He can hear the sound of students talking inside the classroom. He takes a quick peek but can’t see anything from where he’s standing. “What are they doing in there?”
Draco’s eyes darted to the jar of buzzing Glumbumbles on Pansy’s desk. If he was going to do it, now was the time.
Pansy gives him a toothy grin of pure slytherin evil and suddenly stands up. “Then don’t forget to wear your raspberry lip mask tonight before bed, darling. Because tomorrow somebody’s going to be kissed by their crush.”
“Happy graduation, darling!”
They stayed like that for an unknown amount of time, both panting until their breathing evened out, and then Harry slid his cock free, carefully helping Draco up into a sitting position and pressing sweet, light kisses all over his face.
“Mother!” he protested. She wasn’t supposed to tell Harry about Draco’s weekly, detailed letters of how their relationship was going.
(By: Rita Skeeter)
They ran inside the castle and up the stairs, occasionally stopping for long and messy snogs against a wall, and when they were running again, Draco couldn’t feel his feet hitting the ground under them, like he was weightlessly floating a few inches off the floor, and maybe he was.

“Potter, we were just…” the girl hesitated, searching for words.
“Well, as much as we might not like it,” Pansy shrugs. “Dare’s a dare. Blaise did his, now you do yours.”
“MALFOY!”
“Come on, let’s go,” Potter murmured against Draco’s lips after he pulled away –
, Ginny, you’re not supposed to just barge into the boys’ locker room!” Weasley protested loudly.
Draco’s hands slid between them, pulling impatiently at Potter’s belt buckle and undoing his zipper. “Off. Take that shit off.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat as his eyes landed on a gigantic skeleton of a basilisk – too enormous and creepy to be a fake – lying on the ground beside the stone statue of Salazar Slytherin at the far end.
“And you’ve got the passion,” his mother added, her eyes glinting with pride.

“I’m not,” Potter said, taking a step forward. “I don’t love you
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Potter said, tucking the wand back in his pocket.  They sat in silence for a few minutes, Draco internally repeating Potter’s words to himself with childish glee –
“I’m fine.” Draco said, murmuring an apology and rushing to help the girl with her books.
“Malfoy! Come in, we have an empty shower stall.” He waved Draco over casually.

Draco yelped as his clothes disappeared with a snap of Harry’s fingers and was immediately lifted onto the desk, Harry slotting between his pale legs.
was how he really looked at the situation. And then, even more surprised as to why he hadn’t realized it sooner.
“Of course I am,” Potter said, emerald eyes filled with warmth as he looked down at Draco. “I already told you. You don’t have to wear it but if you want to, we’ll do it together.”
“So, ummm,” Potter cleared his throat. “Now that we’ve… cleared things out, how do you feel about helping me end this stupid old rivalry once and for all?” Potter leaned forward and offered up his hand. “Friends?”
Draco turned around spontaneously, checking if the Weasley-girl or some other Gryffindor lass happened to be standing just behind him, but there was no one else around.
It was all going to be okay.
“Pretty fun game, huh?” Potter smiled at him. How did he manage to look so good and unbothered by the cold when Draco himself could no longer feel his nose and his words were starting to mingle together by the numbness of his cheeks?
, why didn’t you tell me?”
Draco took a deep breath before answering. This was it, this was his chance. “Potter, I know that my actions in the past have been incredibly unacceptable,” he forced the words out, his throat tightening with shame and shiny drops of sweat forming on his forehead. “I’ve never missed an opportunity to insult and humiliate you and your friends, and always treated you like the enemy even though you’ve never done me wrong.” Draco felt like a hand was clawing at his heart, he fought to keep his voice even. “I wanted to tell you that I was wrong, and I’m sorry.”
Draco, if you try to hug me, I’ll curse your skin full of acne!” she threatened.
Potter frowned. “I would never agree to an interview with her. If there’s one thing that Rita knows, it’s how to twist people’s words into whatever rubbish
wizard and isn’t even powerful enough to use magic to tie his own shoes.”
Draco frowns. That doesn’t make much sense. “Why are you standing out here, then?”
“I think that if you want to lay claim on someone,” Draco said, raising his voice over Harry’s groan of protest. “You should do it properly. Come on, Potter. I get this feeling that you can do far better than just a kiss.”
“He’s just doing his job, babe.” Harry lifted his head to give him a tired look.
“Blaise Zabini steals the Quaffle from Thomas in an impressive move and is off towards the opposite goalposts. Wow! He also manages to avoid a Bludger from his own teammate Padma Patil that … I’m not going to comment on …”
“Would I do this if I didn’t like you back?” Draco pushed him back a step, shoved his pants down and unceremoniously, dropped to his knees.
Harry grabbed Draco’s arse again, forcing the round cheeks apart with his thumbs and pressing his spit-slick tongue further inside Draco’s hole. Draco screwed his eyes shut, his toes curling with pleasure.
“Is that why you beat him up?” Draco said, raising an eyebrow.
“W… what do you mean?” Draco stuttered, feeling his defenses rise back up. Had he misinterpreted Potter’s words?
Harry gaped at the implication of Draco’s word. “You don’t mean …”
,” Draco said again, at a loss for words.
It was a small bedroom with a queen size bed taking up most of the space inside. Draco walked the few remaining steps of distance to stand by the edge of the bed, running the tips of his fingers on the soft, plain white sheets.
“Oh, you’re doing it for
to be tongue.”
pity me or I’ll gouge your eyes out with my bare hands,” Draco spat at him, his breath coming shallow with the force of his sudden outburst.
“Malfoy I…” Potter tilted his glasses up to his scarred forehead, rubbing his eyes. “You’re forgiven.” He said simply, and Draco’s heart missed a beat.
at me and walks over to tell me that the other houses are going to throw a big Halloween party and if we want to join them, they’d be happy to have us! Can you believe that?”
Draco pushed his hand away, taking a step back.
, and the decisions it can drive people to make. War’s not a pretty thing, but we’re not at war anymore. So I think we should stop acting like it.”
, now??? What near-impossible, one-in-a-zillion alternate reality was this? And the fact that his Dark Mark was still perfectly intact made the situation all the more confusing. Maybe Potter was…playing with him or something?
In the next step, Draco had made himself a list of all the people that he thought he owed a
After the War, the Ministry had taken all their house elves from them and now the only living creatures inside that enormous manor were Draco, his mother, father, and the occasional Ministry employee coming in to check on his father.
Draco opened his eyes with a long gasp and shot up to a sitting position on his bed, breathing heavily. He’d had the strangest dream last night, but he couldn’t remember what it had been about. Waiting for his mind to catch up with his body, he checked the tiny clock on his mahogany nightstand.
; Draco noted with disappointment. “We’re already late.” He wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist – making his entire body stiffen with surprise – and led the way.
– before Potter spoke up again.
“Gryffinpuff is immediately in possession of the Quaffle, we have Parvati Patil heading straight for the goalposts of the opposite team. Nice job, Parvati! Didn’t know you had it in ya! – oh! Holy … an angry Bludger is flying towards her from no other than the Slytherclaw Beater, Padma Patil, her own sister! Damn, the Patil twins are showing some real skill today! The Gryffinpuff Chaser dodges the Bludger but – oh, are you KIDDING ME? – she drops the Quaffle just like that.
“I think you should start calling me Harry now.” Potter tells him, running the back of a knuckle on the soft skin of Draco’s cheek adoringly.
out?! And what do you think he’d do? Blush and say yes?! No Pans. Best case scenario, he’d think I’ve gone crazy and owl the Mangu’s to send healers; worst case scenario, he’d think I’m definitely up to something and owl the Ministry to send Aurors. Either way, I don’t think he’d even believe me if I told him how I feel, let alone actually considering going out with me.” He looks down at his hands and his voice falters. “Have you forgotten who I am? I’m a former Death-Eater, Pans. And he is the Savoir himself.”
“Young Mr. Malfoy, sir, you have your father’s sharp eyes and his special knack for spotting the rarest of dark artifacts.” Borgin sounded triumphant, like he had meant for Draco to see that. “This ring is a few centuries old. It’s a valuable heritage of a family who shall remain anonymous, sold to me due to the owner’s desperate need for money at the time.” Borgin held up the velvet box carefully in the palm of his withering hand. “But that is not what makes the ring so special. This ring contains the only remaining drop of a potion that its recipe is believed to be destroyed and lost forever.
Draco just stared at him, his palm holding the warm golden ball possessively. And he tried, he really tried not to lighten up like an obsessed twelve-year-old – he was supposed to be pissed, for Merlin’s sake! – but the helpless smile that was tugging at his lips was impossible to hide.
“Back in Fifth Year when I lost Sirius, I…” he gulped, looking down at his entwined hands. “I couldn’t help blaming myself for his death. My godfather had died because I was too bloody stubborn to learn Occlumency and stop Voldemort from manipulating my thoughts. And the weight of that knowledge and guilt on my shoulders was driving me insane.” Potter took off his glasses, putting a hand over his eyes.
.” Draco felt weak with nausea all of a sudden. “You don’t understand, Harry. We’ll never get to be together again. I’ll never get to kiss you again.” Draco’s voice broke with sobs and he pressed his face into Harry’s chest. “Harry I can’t…”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked, equally as confused.
,” MacMillan shouted in his face, making Draco squeeze his eyes shut. He let go of Draco’s collar and took a step back, clutching a hand over his heart and sobbing uncontrollably. And Draco staggered forward with the force of his violent coughs.
But the beautiful fantasy floats away just as easily as it’d come and Draco shakes his head briefly, trying to clear the fog out of his mind and the feeling of sinking ships off his heart. “That’s…” he breathes out and a huff of humorless laughter escapes out with it. “It’s still not enough. There are things that people just can’t forget. Even people like Potter. He might have forgiven me but I doubt that he’d be willing to actually… be with someone whose aunt was responsible for the death of his godfather.” Draco clutches the edge of his book so hard his fingertips go white, the words scratching his throat as they come out of his mouth.
“Again?” Draco said. “Is he okay?” and without waiting for him to answer: “Are
When Draco walked out of Borgin and Burkes that day – the velvet box safely tucked inside the pocket of his trousers – he promised himself that he would never use the potion. That he’d only bought it to give himself the satisfaction of knowing that
So if only for the sake of his friends and the people who cared about him, he was going to get back on his feet again. Draco was miserable, and life was shite, but that didn’t mean he should be weak too. If he was going to survive this – and for the first time in a long time, Draco found himself actually wanting that – he had to make peace with his past and accept it as it was; no matter how dark or awful. And in order to do that, Draco needed forgiveness.
He slows down a few paces away from the classroom door. Goyle is leaning against the stone wall beside the door like some kind of a bodyguard. When he sees Draco, a sheepish smile cracks up his goofy face.
Now as soon as the class is over, Draco is practically flying out of the classroom – head buzzing with anxiety and excitement – and throws himself inside the nearest boys’ bathroom he can find. He checks his hair, making sure a few soft blond strands are falling into his left eye. Renews his perfume. Tidies the collar of his white crisp shirt. Clears his throat and smells his breath. Checks his hair again.
“Yeah, it looks pretty bad.”
“And I knew that if I could see Sirius again, he would tell me that he didn’t think it my fault. I knew that he wouldn’t blame me, but still I couldn’t forgive myself, and it was slowly killing me,”
And it’s all Draco has ever wanted.
look just a little bit different from that creepy old storage.”
“A question,” Harry replied, shrugging one shoulder. “A promise, if you want it to be,”
“So, according to Headmistress McGonagall, the winning team is the one that gets to use the showers first,” Terry threw his hands out. “So I don’t know about you, but that’s enough motivation for me, because it’s freezing out there and we’re gonna need hot water.”
?” Millie answered. “She’s right, what’s up with you today?”
“Oh,” Draco said, uninterested. “The party you’re throwing in the common room tonight?”
Potter bends Draco’s body back on the arm he has around his waist – knocking the air out of Draco’s lungs – and then it’s happening.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco was in the mood to tease him some more, but at that, he changed his mind, the evil grin on his face shrinking into a fond little smile.
The sound of Pansy clearing her throat drags Draco’s attention from Potter’s retreating figure and the self-pity he’s feeling at the moment to Pansy’s face and he instantly regrets looking at her.
Harry finally slid his fingers out of Draco and murmured a spell into his damp, sweaty hair, lubing himself up. He positioned the head of his cock against Draco’s arsehole – both of them grunting at the touch – but hesitated there, his lust-blown eyes searching Draco’s face again.
“For Salazar’s
Draco turned his back to them, having a strange feeling like he’d just suffered a heavy punch to the guts. How could he have been so stupid to let himself
, somehow.
When they finally broke the kiss – their lips still touching when they spoke – Draco opened his eyes to a set of magnificent emeralds melting away all his sorrows and regrets.
“Potter, I…” Draco started, but the words died in his throat as his eyes landed on a head of shiny black hair leaning over the Gryffindor table, looking down at something on the table over Granger’s shoulders.
asked for better. At this point, Draco cannot really tell if he is moaning or not. His mouth falls open on its own accord under the firm pressure of Potter’s lips and when Potter pushes his tongue inside, Draco is sure that his soul is flying right out of his body and he wouldn’t ever recover from this. Maybe now he
“Why?” Pansy asked; her fists clenched at her sides. “Why did you stand up for us, Potter? Is it really
The musty door of Borgin and Burkes gave a loud squeak when Draco pushed it in and stepped inside the dark, old store. The entire place smelled like death, and everything in the store was under a thick layer of dust.
It was a bad idea.
He didn’t know how much time had passed – he must have zoned out – when he heard a couple of students settling themselves down behind the desk in front of his.
,” Draco hissed. “Don’t stop.”
“Wh…?” the girl gaped at him, suddenly nervous. “But they’re the
“Is there a problem, Mr. Potter?” Slughorn asked with a small frown.
,” Harry grunted, face bright red. “I just wanted you to … consider me.”
Draco lets out a startled laugh. Pansy doesn’t at all seem to be kidding. “Have you lost your mind? Me, asking
,” Harry said in between kisses. “You like me back?”
Draco gaped at him, aghast. The sheer amount of sorrow and heartbreak that was radiating from MacMillan was probably enough to send Draco to his knees had it not been for the hands pining him to the wall, crushing his windpipes. How did MacMillan even live with it?
“Bastard,” Draco muttered to himself as he readjusted his abandoned, half-hard cock in his trousers before stepping out of the small closet and heading for the greenhouses.
“So,” Potter says when they finally break away. “Should I take that as a yes?”
Draco’s attention caught at the mention of his own name, his senses sharpening and dragging him out of the sweet realm of sleep. The two of them probably hadn’t noticed Draco sitting just behind them – too caught up in their heated conversation.
, yes!” Draco moaned involuntarily, making Harry smirk and lean back over him. Harry brought Draco’s knees to his chest – bending him in half – and positioned himself between them. He pressed a light kiss to the instep of Draco’s foot and murmured a wandless spell against his skin, lubing himself up before burying his cock, in a long and steady thrust, all the way up Draco’s arse.
Hope you guys have enjoyed reading it so far!!!
“And most importantly,” Harry said, his face cracking up with an enormous grin. “You look amazing in white.” He squeezed Draco into his side with the hand he had around his waist. “That sounds brilliant!”
! Listen to me, Jesus!” Draco shouted, making Harry blink at him and fall silent.
“Harry!” Teddy howled, letting go of Andromeda’s hand and running towards them.
“That’s not what I meant!” Potter was easily irritated (what a surprise!). “I was just curious is all. Why do you always have to be so impossible, Malfoy?”
“Thank you, Mother,” said Draco, needlessly straightening his spotless, ironed, dark-green graduation gown.
“So, what did you do about it?” Draco asked, his voice almost a whisper.
Harry flicked his fingers and all of Draco’s clothes disappeared, making him feel extremely vulnerable for a second before Harry turned him around and captured his mouth fiercely into his own. He put both his hands on Draco’s arse, kneading the round flesh before he lifted Draco off of his feet – making him gasp into the bruising kiss – and threw him on the bed, climbing in right after him.
“De…de…” Slughorn gasped, “Detention for you too, Mr. Malfoy,” before he passed out entirely.
Potter would think he was up to something.
The corner of Potter’s mouth lifts up in an amused, almost invisible smile. “Do you want me to kiss you?”
Pansy took in a sharp breath. “Draco…”
,” Draco let out a loud whine as without further warning, Harry pushed inside him with a deep thrust.
He threw his duvet off and got to his feet, stretching his arms. At the same time, he realized he probably shouldn’t have. His palm quickly moved to his injured chest, waiting for the inevitable pain. But nothing happened. Draco poked his chest carefully, but the injury seemed to have all but completely healed over the night.
Harry stepped even closer, pressing their foreheads together. He cradled Draco’s cheek in his hand and bushed the tear away with the soft pad of his thumb.
“I don’t care about everyone.” Potter’s tone is serious at he looks right into Draco’s eyes when he says it.
And for the rest of the class, Draco can’t focus on anything but the delicious buzzing of his lips and the distant taste of mint and coconuts and
McGonagall was right. He
When Harry pressed in a long finger alongside his tongue – almost sending Draco over the edge – Draco hissed and pulled at his hair, overwhelmed.
Draco looks around himself at a classroom full of eighth year students who look like they have just witnessed the most interesting spectacle of their lives. When have all these students arrived, anyway?
“What?” Draco sniffed; pretty sure the tip of his nose had gone pink from the cold.
, are you?” Potter asked, voice dangerously calm. “Did I ask you to?”
Potter clicked his tongue stubbornly, refusing to get up for a second before he finally gave up.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Did I disturb your creepy ogling session?” Pansy crosses her arms. “I called your name several times, Draco. You can at least pay a little attention to your surroundings as well when you’re fantasizing about screwing the Golden Boy.”
There was utter silence for a moment, before a loud buzzing noise started as the Glumbumbles flew out of the broken jar and then the whole class broke into a fit of shouting and running away from the insects. Draco – frozen in place by the shock of what he had just done – slowly lifted his wide eyes to where Potter, equally as shocked, was staring at him with his eyes bulging out of their sockets.
“What are you doing?” Blaise was looking at him through the mirror with a confused-looking frown, adjusting his green and silver Slytherin tie.
Draco’s eyes fell shut on their own accord, his breath escaping him in a soft huff as Potter brushed the tip of his tongue against Draco’s own. Draco’s hands came up to rest on Potter’s biceps. Potter’s mouth was hot and welcoming, and Draco had no idea what was happening or why, but he bloody well knew that he didn’t have the strength to pull away from this if he wanted to.
“So, me and a bunch of others are going to Hogsmeade after class to smuggle in some Firewhiskey for the party tonight and then set up the last of the decorations, and I know you need to take your time to get ready so I won’t ask you to come with us.” Potter rolled his eyes at him good-naturedly. “So, I think we won’t be able to hang out today after class. But I will collect you at half past seven for the party. Okay?”
for something as personal as my romantic life?” Potter clenched his jaw in annoyance. “How convenient!”
“What do you think, Potter?” said Draco, finally managing to pull Harry’s jeans down to his thighs and cupping his hardness over the fabric of his pants.
when you go all angry-kitten on people, but maybe don’t start a fight with anyone tonight, hmm?”
Weasley snorted loudly. “A team that

for Potter to keep something of his.
!” he swore again as Draco’s fingers slid under the elastic of his pants. “That maybe you didn’t feel the same about me.”
“Sometimes, when a patient dies and I can’t save them, I get this awful voice at the back of my head telling me that I should have joined the Auror training,” Harry said, absently stroking Draco’s back. “That maybe if I’d become an Auror, I could do a better job at helping people.”
. What was he doing? This wasn’t even his real life. Draco would go back to his own reality in less than 24 hours. He wouldn’t be here for the interview anyways. “Okay, fine,” he opened his eyes again. “Fuck it. We’ll do the interview.”
! I’m so sorry.” Potter sounded horrified.
“I don’t know, you tell me.” Harry bumped their noses together. “You’ve been the one at the receiving end of my displays of affection for the past three month.”
After the game, Draco and the other Slytherclaws – dammit Weasley-girl – headed for the Ravenclaw locker room to wait for their turn in the showers. And to Draco’s surprise, none of his teammates seemed to be disturbed by the fact that they’d just suffered a rather humiliating defeat. There were only arms around shoulders and easy laughs and light punches to each other’s biceps as they picked their way out of the field as a team.
When he read the words on the parchment, he didn’t bother to write anything back. He didn’t even spare another glance in Potter’s direction. He just gathered up his things and walked straight out of the library to go and sign up for the Quidditch team.
Draco had already stripped off his jacket and tossed it – along with Harry’s – somewhere in the hallway outside the classroom, and now his impatient fingers were blindly working the button of Harry’s jeans as he pressed bruising kisses all over Draco’s bare neck.
“Before we really got to know one another, we always saw each other as the enemy. We were kids, Draco. We didn’t know any better. We were raised by people with opposite beliefs and morals and were never really given the chance to choose our own paths. We never got to pick the rights and wrongs for ourselves,” Potter said, throwing his hands up in frustration. “But when you started visiting Teddy with your mother during the summer, and you and I started actually
“I…” Draco swallows hard and closes his eyes, trying to think about it. Would he rather kiss Potter once and face the reality of him not wanting Draco back – could he truly take that without falling apart? It is one thing to know Potter doesn’t want him but another thing to actually hear him say it – or quietly watch Potter from a distance for the rest of his life and just as quietly; wonder?
Guyssss,
. There was no sign of the dark bags under his eyes, his skin was as pale as always, but instead of the soulless white of the past few years, it seemed to be glowing with good health. He brought his hand up to his face, lightly touching the flush of soft pink across his cheeks with disbelief. He hadn’t looked like this for so long, that he’d forgotten he even could.
of who you are or what you’ve been through, Draco. I love you
Even as he was sucking Harry off, he still had a hard time believing that it was actually happening. That this was really Harry – in his arms, in his mouth – and that this time, there were no conditions to it. They didn’t ever have to stop if they didn’t want to, because they had all the time in the world. And even if he woke up alone the next morning, he knew that Harry would be thinking about him and the night they were about to have together. Harry would be thinking about
“Hey, tell that voice to shut the fuck up!” Draco said, taking Harry’s head in both hands and lifting his tired emerald eyes to look into his own. “You are plenty good at what you’re doing. You’re one of the best Healers we’ve got. You’re great at performing Healing Charms, your magical core is insanely strong so you can detect magical injuries and heal them faster than anyone else, and most importantly, Harry, you
Draco shrugged. “To tell me how much he loves me and to ask me out on a date. You know, the usual stuff. Are you still mad at me?”
At breakfast, when he’d looked over at the Gryffindor table out of reflex and their eyes had met, and Harry’s lips hadn’t formed that beautiful, bright smile at him any longer; Draco had reached for every last thread of his self-control to keep himself from falling apart.
“Hmmm…no,” Harry decided, shaking his head with a frown. He leaned beck and without further delay, swallowed Draco’s cock whole.
,” Draco was lost in pleasure, already on the verge of his second orgasm. And by the looks of it, Harry was too. “Harry…”
wants them to say.”
“And you,” Potter is shaking with laughter now, emerald eyes sparkling with mirth. “You alone were a whole other story. Honestly, you slytherins are not as good at deceiving others as you think you are.”
Draco wrapped his jacket around his shoulders and walked out of the Hufflepuff locker room without a backward glance.
“I’d have chosen
Draco’s roaming eyes landed on Potter’s floating figure on the other side of the field. Potter didn’t even seem to be trying to look for the Snitch. He was just leaning back on his Firebolt and watching as the others totally embarrassed themselves with what Draco suspected was an amused grin.
Harry slid a finger inside and instantly groaned as Draco clenched his arse around it.
And he and Potter were actually getting along. They had talked again a few times, Potter telling him about the time he’d spent on the run and Draco talking about those awful nights of him guarding the dungeons of the Malfoy Manner – it hadn’t been easy, he’d had to force the words out of his mouth and his voice hadn’t stopped shaking all the while, but Potter had sat close and listened, and when he had finally finished, it’d felt like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
“Mr.Malfoy!”
I wouldn’t put it past him to do these kinds of things.”
“I’m saying what if – and it’s all hypothetical – you two kissed once. I mean if he does like you and just doesn’t know it yet, he’d find out like that. But if he doesn’t, at least you’d know for sure and you wouldn’t have to …you know… wonder.” Pansy gives him a shrug that she’s obviously trying to hide her excitement behind.
! We’re Achilles and Patroclus!”
“Look, if you are naive enough to actually think you’re helping anyone with this behavior, then think again. But if you’re just hiding behind my name to justify your awfully inacceptable actions, then I’m going to have to report all of you to Headmistress McGonagall right now.”
“I still think the two of you should do an interview to talk about your relationship once, and be done with it,” Weasley suggested, before shoving a spoonful of oatmeal into his mouth.
“Potter?” Draco said hesitantly. “What are you-
appreciated❤
“You can’t expect things to get better unless
Draco rolled his eyes in a bored gesture. “Since when do I have to explain myself to you, Potter? You’re not the boss of me.”
