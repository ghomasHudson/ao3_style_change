Harry kissed and sucked his neck harder, then slowly licked up Draco's jawline reaching his ear, he whispered "I can give you whatever you want"
Harry cast the wrist ties away slid his arm around Draco's back, pulling him up and spinning him onto his hands and knees. Draco was panting at the sudden movement, he looked down at the sheets beneath him and felt a wave of gorgeous shame at letting himself be used. He slowly positioned his legs wider, feeling awkward at exposing his arse for Harry
"We were in charms class and you sneaked in under your invisibility cloak and started giving me a blowjob under the desk" Draco smiled, Harry cocked his head excitedly "Then I kept moaning and moaning so you dragged me out to the corridor and bent me over the stone staircase and we fucked"
"I like to... dominate" Harry said, apprehensive about Draco's reaction "Spanking, degradation, humiliation... it's my kink..." he kissed Draco's neck "and I'm not doing any of that with someone who's not ready to endure it, understand?"
"There was one night... I fell asleep in his arms. I just felt so loved. I've never felt like that before. Everything in that moment was so perfect.  They way he held me.. and kissed me... that's more than just a causal hook up..."
Draco remained quiet. He pushed himself up from his elbows until he was kneeling on the bed beside Harry, looking across the room at the floor. He was still naked, and hot and sticky. He cast a silent cleaning spell and pulled his knees to his chest. Harry kneeled beside him, noticing his lack of enthusiasm
"Very soon" Harry stroked down his jaw wrapping his hand around the Slytherin tie that hung from Draco's neck. He tugged on it forcing Draco to face the floor as he leant into his ear "I think you'll look good wearing a collar and lead, don't you agree?"
Harry hadn't taken in a word of that. He hadn't really been paying much attention for the last hour in fact. His mind was occupied with thoughts of Draco, who just so happened to be sitting three desks in front of him and Harry thought even the back of him looked bloody gorgeous
"Right..." Ron spoke, completely unconvinced by Harry's sudden change of heart "So it wont bother you that I saw Draco kissing that boy out the back ten minutes ago?"
Harry was irritated now. Biting his tongue to stop from snapping. Why was Malfoy antagonising him? And why did he have to do it in the showers of all places?
Harry stood back up and cast a cleaning spell over himself. He walked across the room grabbing various items of clothing, climbing into his sweatpants and pulling on his t-shirt. He leant down by the mirror to fix his hair and glasses, catching sight of Draco who was still sitting in silence, obeying his commands to not move
"Quiet, Slut. You're to be fucked, not heard" Harry bit, grabbing the back of Draco's head with one hand and forcing his mouth down onto his hard, leaking cock
Harry pulled out his wand and pointed it at the floor in front of Draco. There was the sound of a quiet pop where a black leather collar and leash appeared in front of him. Draco's mouth dropped open and his cock stiffened instantly.
"Harry!" Hermione interrupted, irritated that the conversation continued to flow back to the sex "I understand you're hurting right now but you have to accept that whatever it was that you two had is over"
Pansy and Blaise both nodded in agreement, tears were welling in her eyes too seeing her best friend so broken. Until now Draco had never shown much interest in others, his attitude toward girls was almost indifferent. For the first time she was seeing the pain that consumed him. He was falling in love, and it broke her heart to see him so hurt
Harry closed his eyes shaking his head. He felt so ashamed when he heard himself out loud "I'm horrible for even saying that I know". Draco didn't respond "But what we have is so amazing. Learning boundaries and growing and trying new things. It's incredible Draco, what we have right now feels amazing"
"I'm shit? Potter you couldn't even see the snitch when it was right in front of you... that's just embarrassing really-"
"Feelings" Draco stated, feeling his heart hammering in his chest "Why won't you just admit that this is more than just casual sex"
Draco stared at him with wide eyes, his lips parted as he panted heavily from the mixture of arousal and shock. It was Harry Potter doing this to him, of all people. Harry Potter making him hard, making him squirm, making him come
"I know" Harry bit "But this is crazy! It's us! It's you - who hates my guts and ridicules me at any moment he gets and its me - who can't stand your twisted views and your pathetic superiority! How can we actually work together?"
Tom nodded. It made sense. Force a change on someone and release it near a town to increase the belief that werewolves are dangerous.
Hermione nodded unable to say anything for her mouth felt dry. She had many questions and didn’t know where to start.
“Don’t give me that crap. You think that you can reel me in on some forged paper. I’ve never been with HIM, I’ll never be with HIM and there is nothing you have to say that will change my mind about staying.”
On the other side of those flames was a regal sitting room richly furnished in silver and bronze. A regal woman sat on a settee embroidering. She glanced at the fireplace when she saw the fire spurt.
Two weeks after they’d arrived at Hogwarts they received a letter from their Uncle telling them that their parents had been in a car accident. His uncle then went on to say that he would not be taking them in.
“It has come to my attention that a Muggleborn student of your is not really muggleborn, and quite possibly other ‘muggleborns’ as well.” Lucius stated.
Albus stared at James in shock, “But Peter was terrible with memory spells. How could he perform them to a point like that. And why do we all remember Tom being a dark lord if he really wasn’t one?”
Everyone looked up and saw Severus standing there with his arms wrapped around Remus’ waist and young Conall clinging to his hand. Lily stood up and walked over to them. Together she and Severus helped Remus to an unoccupied chair.
Lucius stalked over to them and snatched the mirror from Sirius’ hand, “I don’t have time to argue with you, get everyone together and use your portkey. If you are not here within the hour all of us are storming the castle.”
Umbridge snarled at him, “You were supposed to be watching them, you little fool. When did you last see them?”
Fenrir shook his head, “Those that were taken were our children and carriers. Most of the Dom’s were out hunting when the attack happened. My own mate was among those taken.”
“Lucius Malfoy had all the Muggleborns and Muggle raised children presently in Hogwarts tested with the Heritage Potion. Every single one of them came back as being blood adopted by muggles that was approved by the Minister for Magic.”
Making her way down to the dungeons, Hermione knocked on Snape’s classroom door. Grateful that it was a Saturday she heard him say ‘enter’ and she went into the room.
“You really think that they’d do all this just to get you to join them? And by them I mean these… Death Eaters?”
Madame Pomphrey just stared at the pages, just now beginning to realize that things are not as they seemed. “What does all this mean, Mr. Malfoy? Who would steal all these children from their rightful families?”
“We did NOT give you up. You were stolen from us the night you were born.” Rodolphus stopped her words and looked Hermione in the eyes. “The mediwitch who helped birth you also stole you from us. She put a gollum in your place and we never knew until much later.”
“A stasis spell, Gellert was very good at them. Possibly when he found out he was pregnant he placed a very strong stasis on the growing child. After I defeated him, he must have prolonged the spell as much as he could. Then possibly the strain became too great and the spell collapsed causing the child to continue it’s growth.” Albus said breathlessly.
Gently she pricked her finger and let a drop of blood fall onto the parchment. With bated breath they all watched as the paper seemed to sink into the parchment. Then suddenly words began to appear on the paper. None of them could believe their eyes.
“If you want to meet her ‘Mione then go right ahead. They should be at Malfoy Manor by morning. Tomorrow is a Hogsmeade weekend and we can slip away quietly. Dad gave me a portkey…”
He felt a hand on his shoulder pushing ham back down and a gentle voice in his ear, “Shhh, Sev, it’s ok. Remus is safe and you child is safe. Your at Malfoy Manor.”
“Miss Granger, I do not have all the answers. There are others who have more knowledge on that day than myself. Now, if you would kindly remove yourself from my quarters I have my next class to prepare for.”
A few minutes later she burst through Hagrid’s door startling Fang from his slumber. Hagrid was nowhere to be seen.
“Let’s wait until we are all gathered together. I think that the adults can explain things better.” Hermione said.
Snape looked up from the paperwork he’d been grading and sneered at her. “Top shelf left hand side.”
Tom nodded thoughtfully, “That could be worth a shot. Severus, only three of us here are proficient in Legilimency. I will let you into my mind and you try and see where the block is.”
They room waited with baited breath for a few minutes until a voice could be heard through the mirror, a voice that many in the room recognized but was not Harry.
Draco was on the floor in front of him leaning on his legs. The blonde too had not left his side except to see his parents. The couch next to them held Remus and Severus with their son curled in Remus’ lap. Harry still was shocked to see the two of them together, with a child. Surprisingly Fenrir Greyback stood behind Remus. Harry noticed his hand twitch, almost as if the man was wanting to place it somewhere.
Sorry this is late, and so short.. I'd been sitting on this chapter for six months.. I'm not really happy about it, but I had to get it out so I could keep going. Hope you guys enjoy it. K
Across the room Fenrir Greyback was watching over his cub and grandson. He knew what Remus was going through. The pain of not being in the presence of ones mate. When he’d first realized that little Tala, the young cub who’d trailed after him as a teenager, was his mate he felt such joy that he’d howled to the mother moon. When his mate was pregnant with their first child he had strutted around the camp so full of pride. And when that cub was stolen from him he raged and screamed at the injustice of it. Now his cub is back, but without Tala by his side his joy seemed shallow. She would want to know that her little Moonfire was alive.
Immediately Severus found himself being drawn into a memory. Ignoring it he pushed past a barrier and came to Tom’s memory reservoir. Right away he noticed something off about the place. There was a haze about each memory, the usual haze that came with false memories as seen from a pensive. He knew that the true memories were still here, but were blocked by something. It was not a true Obliviate, more like a blanket of sorts to cover the true memories.
One thing she did know… She will be paying a visit to her adopted sister and that man she called a husband…
Lucius gave a small start. He was sure that he’d kept his features in his usual Malfoy mask. Obviously his distress bled through just enough for his Lord to see.
Remus noticed his cub in danger and threw himself a Umbridge. They collapsed in a heap on the floor, Umbridge shrieking for her men to ‘get this filthy animal off her’. They converged on them and one of them produced a knife from within his robe, it flashed silver.
When Harry awoke in the morning he was greeted with the sight of his boyfriend asleep next to him, the blonds hair in disarray from sleep. He smiled and leaned down and placed a gentle kiss on Draco’s lips. He lay back down and snuggled back up to the other boy, closing his eyes.
Lily tried to hold him down as he struggled to stand, “Sev, he’s right here, he’s fine. Let me have the child Sev, I’ll take good care of him.”
The dark haired woman lay back on the bed panting in exhaustion. After twenty hours she could push no more.
“Don’t get up Kelston, I need some answers.” Lucius said as the man began to rise. Kelston slumped back into his chair as the couple took the empty chairs on the other side of his desk.
“Sixteen! My baby is sixteen years old! I never got to see him grow up. Why? What did Peter hope to gain from all this? Did he raise Harry? Has he corrupted my baby against us?” She began to wail and Tom sat there flummoxed. She was wailing over lost time with him here in the room, the man who killed them, at least in his mind he killed them.
Tom cleared his throat, “If you are referring to Black then I have no idea where he might be, as for what happened… I’m not so sure any more. Either my memory is faulty or you two are really dead and this is all just a bad dream.”
Remus closed his eyes and opened his senses to the surrounding area hoping to catch Severus’ scent. He stood there taking in all the scents, filtering out the werewolf smells and house elves immediately. There, the subtle smell of peppermint and coffee.
“There’s more, and your not going to like it, Siri.” She sighed and pulled more pages from the table, “Lucius and I tested all the Muggleborns. All of them, Siri. None of them are really who they are. You need to see for yourself.” She handed the stack to him.
Lucius sighed, “You might want to come through, Albus. What I have to tell you cannot be said through the floo network.”
Lily smirked at him, almost reminiscent of a Malfoy, “Goofy, you really think that he’d be talking to us when both the boy’s parents were out cold? He was a little traumatized himself too you know.”
The arrival back at the Manor was rather anticlimactic. Greyback’s pack went to one of the large ballrooms for the families to reconnect. Severus and Remus gathered their son and disappeared into their rooms. Tom dismissed the rest of his people to recover their strength.
Remus was cut off as the front door was blown off and men came storming into the room. Before either of them knew what was happening they were disarmed and bound. Severus cursed at being so outsmarted. Then a woman came in and Snape sneered at her in disgust.
Draco stopped him by placing a finger to Harry’s lips, “Yes, you are. You are very gorgeous and sexy. Anyone who tells you otherwise is blind or stupid.”
Albus/Gellert are Lily’s parents, Bella/Rodolphus are Hermione’s parents, Fenrir/Tala are Remus’ parents
“Yes, I’m here about your case. And this is a magical matter, as your DB is an undercover magical operative.”
The lord gave a derisive snort, “Albus Dumbledore does not just disappear. He cares too much for this school and it’s students. He will turn up eventually. In the mean time… Fudge is becoming insufferable. It is time to have him removed. Kingsley, I have the utmost faith in your abilities.”
Healer Kelston Jorgens was just finnishing some paperwork as the two Malfoy’s came into his office. He gave a start at the look on the man’s face.
“That is a very good idea. And it will not raise any questions. Do you have enough potion and parchment?” Dumbledore asked.
Bellatrix pulled back and looked into Hermione’s eyes studying her, “Were you treated well by those muggles?”
James turned to Tom, “So if you don’t know what happened that night, then you probably don’t remember what had Sirius so excited.”
Lily pulled Harry into her arms, “It’s going to be OK Harry. You never have to return to them again. Your father and I will not allow that.”
“I was worried, love. What were you…” He stopped as he noticed something. Harry followed his gave down. He heard Draco sigh, “I thought we were past this.”
“Severus told me that you two were alive and I had to come down and see for myself.” Remus smiled at his two long lost friends.
Ron Weasley knelt next to his mother awaiting their Lord’s arrival. Delores Umbridge stood near the fireplace as the floo activated and a cloaked figure stepped out. Umbridge gave a deep curtsy as the person sat in the Headmaster’s chair.
For the longest time he’d thought that Greyback had wiped out his entire family and left him an orphan and a werewolf. Now he’s told that he has a family… father, mother and siblings. Although he may not have a mother soon if Greyback’s pack wasn’t rescued soon. There was no telling what the Ministry will do to so many werewolves.
“You have four days Miss Granger. On Tuesday at the lunch hour I expect you to be down here with the completed project. We will then test the paper at that time. Understood?”
“Then just a little over a week ago I was told that there seemed to be no Muggleborns, that children from Dark families were being taken and put with Muggles to raise. Last night I attacked Azkaban and freed all my followers and we found you two in a remote cell, catatonic.”
Pairings: Hermione/Blaise; Harry/Draco; Side Pairings: Bella/Rodolphus; Lucius/Narcissa; Severus/Remus; James/Lily, Tom/Sirius (and some other surprise pairings)
Very slowly Harry nodded and began a long story that began just shortly after he arrived at the Dursley’s. Of when he was five years old and being told he was supposed to make dinner. His burnt hands and the beatings afterwards. Of when late one night Vernon was drunk and came into his cupboard and started touching him in his private places. The smacks across his face when he tried to tell his aunt what happened the next morning.
Draco smiled, “How can anyone sleep after such a sweet kiss like that and that delectable body of your snuggled against me?”
He needed to write his father to find out what’s happening with the Board of Governors if they are allowing Umbridge to run the school.
Severus clung to Remus’ hand shaking with relief. “Thank you… all of you…” He turned to survey the room and his eyes widened as they landed on Lily and James. “You really are here!” He said in shock, then collapsed into a faint.
“They take care of us, give us mates. Are you to be my mate?” She began to circle him, her nose sniffing the air.
Delorus Umbridge gave a small smile at the bound men and sniffed, “I would have expected better of you Snape. A werewolf? How disgusting to contaminate yourself with a halfbreed.”
Lucius sighed and called for a house elf, “Mopsy, please inform the household that Headmaster Dumbledore will be arriving here shortly and have tea sent here for everyone.”
Remus stood, nodded to those in the room and left. Sirius watched his best friend leave with a heavy heart. He didn’t see what Remus saw in the dungeon bat but watching him mope around was the most heart wrenching thing he’d ever seen of him. He vowed then and there that he would get Snape out and reunited with Remus and their son.
There was a knock at the door and he went to answer it. Poking his head out he saw Mrs. Malfoy standing in the hallway.
“Bad, he woke screaming for him to stop, that he was good…” Draco snarled, “When I get my hands on that filthy Muggle…”
That last shook him. He never imagined that he would ever have any type of family. After his mother abandoned him at the orphanage and his father rejected him he felt bereft. Now he wasn’t even sure that his memories of all that was even real. Did he really kill his father’s family? All those children in the orphanage?
Sirius laughed outright this time, “Don’t let him hear you say that, he was the best Auror in our year. Nothing scares that man… except Lily.” And Sirius gave a small shudder and whispered, “She scares me too.”
“If there is any from Fenrir’s pack still there we will release them and send them back to the Manor. We will go at dawn tomorrow when everyone is waking up. The guards will be tired from a long watch and will be lazy. Bella, no torture please. Stunning spells only unless other options are needed. Lucius, please make about two or three dozen portkey’s and disperse them to the others.”
As they came closer to the prison a chill permeated the area and many black cloaked figures came their way. He was prepared for this. He pulled out ofhis pocket a talisman and held if aloft letting a trickle of magic flow into it. The dementors suddenly stopped as if frozen and allowed them to pass.
When she met Vernon Dursley, the muggle seemed so slimy and vile that she feared her sister was under some spell. But Vernon was just a muggle and couldn’t do magic. When Tuni was around the man was all sweetness and could do no wrong in her sister’s eyes. But the one time Lily was alone with him it seemed as if the vileness seeped out of his pores and she’d fled to James’ arms. Her, a powerful witch, was afraid of some slimy muggle.
Loud jeering broke out at the Gryffindor table and Umbridge screeched, “Silence! This school has been completely lacking of late, and I will have it brought to order! Now, you are all dismissed to your classes. Anyone who dawdles will receive detention!”
Lucius glanced up from where he sat, “Remus has been stabbed with a silver knife. He’ll need an antitoxin.” Narcissa ran from the room to get the required potion, returning minutes later and handing the potion to Lucius. He immediately poured the contents down the werewolf's throat, rubbing his throat to encourage swallowing.
Colin Creevey gaped in wonder at the room that was provided for him and his brother. If just a week ago someone had told him that he would be in Malfoy Manor as a guest, he would have told that person to go see Madam Pomphrey.
Lucius sneered one last time at the pathetic fool and turned to his wife, “We need to find out who else knew, and we need to test all the muggleborns in that ten year period.”
“Mother stop pestering him. We only have a short time here.” Draco pulled Harry away from his mother and proceded to exit the room, Hermione and Blaise trailing after.
Bellatrix Lestrange sat on a sofa sipping tea with her husband and brother-in-law. As the door opened they turned to look. Bella froze, her teacup halfway to her lips, then slipped from numb fingers.
Ginny moaned as the man above her thrust in one more time and then stilling as he came. He pulled out, got up and dressed.
Focusing his power on a single point, a weak spot, he sent a blast of raw magic at the wards. Within seconds they shattered and alarms blared throughout the compound. Tom smirked, distraction underway.
Draco tilted Harry’s face up to look in his eyes, “This doesn’t help, love. It only makes it worse.”
Fenrir sighed, “Most of them are stolen pups from various packs, the others…” Fenrir ran a hand through his sandy blond hair, “Rogues I suppose… when a pup is stolen from its pack they lose their connection to the unity of the pack… the younger ones seem to be lucky as they haven’t had as long with us, whereas the older cubs go crazy with the lack of pack unity. The ministry has been stealing cubs for fifty years and claiming that they are bitten children of families that were wiped out.”
“Lily had just put Harry to bed when everything happened. Peter struck rapid fast, faster than I’d ever seen him move and had all of us stunned. After that my mind seemed like it was locked away from the rest of me and I couldn’t do or see anything. Then we woke up here. That’s what I remember.”
Harry finally found his voice and glared at Draco, “You didn’t tell me you were related to Sirius.” He said accusingly.
“Extra Credit? What do you need to do an extra credit assignment for? You’re already at the top of the class.” Ron exclaimed.
Fenrir nodded, “There are definitely wolves here. Too many to just be one pack and I can’t tell if any are from my pack. Let’s go back and see if the others have found anything.”
The youth nodded, “Yes sir. Do they know that we are not their children? With the Ministry behind all this they’d have access to the Obliviators and could modify memories of births.”
“Yes I believe I do. We can make the announcement at lunch and have the students report to the hospital wing just before dinner.”
Gellert clung to Albus, tears streaming down his cheeks as he cried over the loss of his child for the second time. All this time and he assumed that the child was living a normal healthy life, and now he learns that his daughter was dead and he was not there to protect her and her husband.
Of when he was six and he was knocked down the stairs by Dudley and broke his leg and his aunt threw him in his cupboard with no medical treatment. Luckily his magic healed him or he would have never been able to walk again. Of when he was ten and Vernon made him suck him off then beat him for vomiting afterwards. When his Hogwarts letters came he had a small reprieve because they thought that the house was being watched.
Fenrir gaped at the man in surprise, “Bite? I’ve never bitten a child! That goes against the werewolf code. Moonfire is my cub with my mate Tala. I don’t know who told you those lies but it is the truth!”
And he turned back to the sitting room where Narcissa sat clutching the pages he threw at her. She gave a start as he sat on the opposite couch from her. Sirius just ignored her, waiting for Lucius to return.
Sirius just grumbled and left to take a shower. James shook his head and followed his best friend. “We’ll be back once the coast is clear. I don’t need another milk bath.” He gave Lily a peck on the cheek and left.
It’s been two days since he’d learned of his parents being alive and they’d not left him alone since. Draco had been especially difficult to avoid. Two days without cutting left him at a breaking point.
“The Creevey boys? Why them? Granger I understand, she’s my cousin, but why those two crazy Gryffindor’s?”
“What is the point of it all? Why make the Wizarding world believe that there are muggleborns?” Tom mused.
Twenty minutes later Fenrir and Tom apparated to a small wooded area on the outskirts of the Ministry facility. Right away Tom could feel the wards on the area. They felt strong and well tended. This place was definitely not abandoned.
No, she couldn’t think like that. Too many eyes and ears. Maybe it’s possible to get a message out to someone.
“Come on, Harry. We need to get to breakfast. Someone will question where you’ve been. We gotta get up.”
Draco’s shoulders slumped, “I will always be labeled a Death Eater, so long as I bear His mark.” Draco pulled back his sleeve on his left arm. In contrast to his alabaster skin the Dark Mark stood out in black on his arm.
Narcissa gave a wan smile, “No, there are many more. Lucius and I secretly tested all the muggleborn and muggle raised children. All of the muggleborn children are those stolen from dark families.”
Tom shook his head then drank the next potion. Once again nothing happened. Ten minutes later after all the potions taken Tom glanced around the room.
It was dark out across the water as they made their way to the giant building in the middle of the ocean. Most of them rode brooms and the others came in a boat able to carry away those they liberated.
“Very well, Miss Granger. When you are ready I’ll have the venom for you.” He looked at her, “Are you sure you won’t need anything else on the list?”
Tom groaned and sat up when he heard Lucius’ voice. “What are you doing here? You were supposed to wait until I called you.”
Tom cast enevarte on Lily and she awoke with a gasp. She looked about wildly until her eyes settled on Tom and she began to cry.
“He would not tell me, said something about retrieving something of value. Do you know what he was referring to?” Lucius sat next to his wife just as Mopsy returned with the tea tray and biscuits.
After four days of grueling work it was done. Hermione sat back and breathed a huge sigh if relief. The potion was done.
It had been three weeks since Harry, Hermione and all the Muggleborns disappeared too. Neville was sure that Ron knew what was going on as he seem more furious than concerned. Neville just hoped that Voldemort didn’t have them. He hoped that they were all ok.
The door swung open and Fenrir Greyback stepped into the room. The two men regarded one another for a moment and Greyback sneered, “There is something different about you, My Lord.”
When Potter comes back down to the kitchen, this time clad in his auror robes and uniform, Draco is already pouring him a cup from a plain cream mug. Draco then slides him his cup as
“These are my shifts. Work within them. I don’t want to see you when I get back.” And with that, he brushes past Draco, leaving the door open for him.
“Master Malfoy needing his breakfast tea? Mippy will get Master his breakfast tea.” The elf gives Draco a once-over with his misty blue eyes and disappears with a crack.
Truth be told, he doesn’t know how to cook. But he’s amazing at potions. Cooking and potions are similar to each other, right?
People were all over the place now, the centre of the room filled with students singing at the top of their lungs and dancing carelessly, boys in the corner downing shots and playing drinking games, some girls crying, others kissing
Harry came closer, keeping an eye out for passing students "Draco, I never planned for it to go this far... I thought we would hook up once and move on"
Draco cried and groaned through each spanking. Desperation was coursing through him knowing he wouldn't last much longer.
Draco woke up the following morning still curled into the sheets. His hair had flopped over the pillow and he scrunched his eyes as the morning light invaded the room. He stretched his arms a little, rolling onto his back but feeling something solid against his side
"Ah! I'm.. such a naughty Slut, Master" Draco whispered, shame and embarrassment and arousal seeping through him
"Relax darling! It's just a little pick me up! Nothing serious" she smiled, pouring the sparkling punch into her glass "Trust me, tonight is going to be a-mazing"
"I know that" Draco cut him off, the uncertainty in his mind kicking in. He felt almost disappointed "But.. this feels a little more intimate than just causal sex, wouldn't you agree?"
Draco entered the prefects bathroom later that day, he peered round the door to see Harry leaning against the stone wall, arms folded and feet crossed
"That's it, Draco. Feel me stroking you nice and slow" Harry soothed, kneeling between Draco's spread legs. Both of them were completely naked, Draco lying on his back with his wrists bound to the headboard above him with silk ties.
"And you will be punished" Harry leant in closer to Draco's ear from behind "For being my filthy, little whore"
Harry pressed his lips and smiled "I guess so" he took a slow inhale and closed his eyes "If he's  happier moving on then I'm happy for him"
Harry brought his hands down against his body, caressing from Draco's shoulders all the way down across his back to his hips. Draco melted under his touch, as though his skin was tingling beneath Harry's fingers. Over the peaks and dents of his toned back, Harry stroked one hand across his arse before cracking it down across his flesh with a jolting smack
Even Blaise, who usually kept to himself, didn't mind the gawping looks he was getting from everyone around him as they checked him out on his way past them. He winked at one girl and saw her blush into a fit of giggles
Draco looked back up to Harry after several moments. His smile faded to a distant look, knowing what was coming
"Can we talk? Somewhere more private?" Draco asked, he still had the usual sharpness to his tone but there were nerves underneath too
"How do i know you're not judging me for my desires? I get my kicks out of degrading people, making them feel humiliated and worthless. How do I know you won't spread that around the school, tell all your mates, poke fun at me for it?"
"I opened myself up to you! Do you have any idea the position I put myself in for you?! I've been so vulnerable, allowing you you see my most private fantasies, sharing myself with you and trusting you!"
Side note: I know some of you may wonder why some characters personalities seem a little out of character compared to the real story. Honestly, I've already written a story on here that included all the characters being true to the original HP books so in this story (and other stories going forward) I want to alter some of them slightly otherwise I'm just writing the same characters with the same personalities all the time and that's no fun!
"You're nothing to me" Harry whispered in Draco's ear from behind. His trousers and underwear pulled down exposing his hard cock that he pressed between Draco's thighs
Harry kissed the tip of his nose and pulled back, looking into Draco's glassy eyes "What are you, Draco?"
Harry smacked his arse hard and grabbed his chin in his hand, holding him in place "What do you call me?"
Draco let out another incoherent moan, desperate cries of pleasure muffled into the sheets feeling Harry touching him in all the right places, reminding him of his degradation, of where he belonged
Draco jerked himself away from Harry and turned back to the door "My heart isn't safe here. I can't be here.."
Blaise furrowed his brow and shot a look at Pansy who in return reciprocated the look "So no different than usual then?" she smirked
"Your eyeliner is fucking hot" Blaise commented, admiring Draco's look "It pairs so well with your all black outfit too"
Draco slowly opened his eyes, feeling the sticky cum that was covering his face, neck and stomach. His lips parted, gaze dropped to the floor. He had no words to say, unable to bite back with his usual Malfoy bitterness as he was naked and useless, on his knees covered in Harry Potters hot, wet cum. He had never felt so degraded in his life. Shame was pouring through him and there was nothing he could do
Draco shot up. He was still in his bed, still in the same position in fact, but it was the middle of the night, and Harry was no longer in front of him
He could see the candlelight flickering in the reflection of his emerald eyes. His hair was soft to touch, naturally messy but even more so as Draco ran his fingers through it. He noticed Harry's strong jawline, with the hint of stubble appearing through his tanned skin. His face constantly resting at a smile, he looked calm and content and Draco envied how confident he was compared to himself
"Fuck" Harry groaned "Look at you.. gorgeous slut.. I'm gonna cum.. I'm gonna cum in you" Harry felt his cock pulsating as waves of pleasure blinded him, he was overcome with total euphoria, screaming Draco's name and gripping onto him hard, his nails digging into Draco's skin. "Yes Draco! Oh Draco!!"
He was hot and sweaty, cheeks flushed red and scruffy hair falling over his forehead. His arms were still behind his back, his hard cock still twitching against his body, covered from top to bottom in a mixture of Harry's orgasm and his own
"Fuck! Oh God!" Draco cried, both his arse and cock being stroked by Harry "Y-you're gonna m-make me.. cum"
Harry smiled looking down at him "Look at you, so helpless for me. So exposed. The things I could do to you right now while you're bent over begging for your hole to be fucked". Draco's moans were becoming wilder, the dirty talk did all sorts of things to him. "What would everyone say? If they knew you were a filthy little cum-slut? Getting on your knees and bending over for Harry Potter... what would they say, Draco?"
The centre of the room was home to two large black leather sofas and coffee table, which sat beside a huge stone fireplace with an elaborately carved mantelpiece, where the flames flickered generously behind the metal grate, feeling like the only source of warmth in an otherwise cold environment.
"That's it, Slut. Take my h-hard cock. Take it. Good boy. You're d-doing so well" Harry praised as Draco groaned, cursed and begged underneath him
It wasn't even the sex that he missed, not the kink or the fetishes, not even the pleasure. It was feeling Draco's beautiful body under his fingers. Nuzzling into his neck and smelling the subtle cologne and musky scent. Kissing his soft lips and feeling him smile into it. Those memories hurt the most.
Everyone else was holding their breath, watching as Draco's eyes shot open as Harry whispered in his ear. He had no comeback and remained silent
His eyes were fixed on Harry's, taking in every reaction as he withdrew his mouth slowly, teasing the tip with his tongue before going down deep again. He could see Harry's legs beginning to tremble and his eyes fluttered with the intense pleasure building up inside of him
"You we're really good, Draco" he kissed his shoulder and watched as Draco looked out past him. His face was knitted in a frown with what looked like regret
Harry entered the Great Hall the following morning and sat down at his usual bench surrounded by his friends. He peered across the room to see Draco, looking like he hadn't slept a wink. Harry's eyes kept darting from the blonde, to the table below him, to his friends and back, making sure no one caught him looking.
"Good boy. I want to see you cum, Slut" Harry said, and Draco looked at him for reassurance "I give you permission to cum" Harry cast a spell and the spread bar vanished, Draco's arms fell to his side, one hand moving onto his cock desperately
"Relax, Draco. I wont tell anyone that you're a kinky little cum-slut that loves getting on his knees for me" Harry joked "But I will shut you up in the hallway if I have to"
"Fuck! Potter!.. fuck!" he cried. His cock pulsated in Harry's hand as hot cum shot across the sheets beneath him. Harry smiled to himself seeing the Slytherin totally weak at his mercy, panting and moaning his name beneath him
"Honestly.. when we started this I just wanted to get one over on you. Wipe the smug look from your face. But.. what we're into.. you being submissive, me wanting to be in control. It's like we're a perfect match for each other.. sexually, I mean. I honestly thought we would just make out once and be done but... here we are"
"How can you say you have feelings for me when all I've ever given you is sex? You never made an effort to get to know me, the real me. You just assumed that I would never change my ways, that you were too good for me, the thought of dating me was ridiculous to you"
Draco moaned as Harry thrusted deep into him, he was grinding down on his hips, holding him in place against the wall. The pace was picking up, Harry slamming harder and faster as Draco let all sorts of noises escape him. Moans and begs and cries of pleasure. Wincing occasionally at Harry's thickness but in total bliss at the pleasure pulsating through every pore
Then, almost in sync, they both reached up to undo their ties, Draco pulling at his rather violently, glaring murderously at Harry.
He sat down and pulled out his quill, thinking it might be a good time to get ahead on his Charms homework, when he heard Pansy Parkinson giggling behind him.
As they passed the lake, Harry prayed for the Giant Squid to reach out and drag him into the depths. Anything was better than this torture.
He strode in as confidently as possible, hoping if he acted like nothing was out of sorts, no one would question him on why he was nearly half an hour late.
He’d already tried taking it off, to which McGonagall hadn’t threatened to take even more points from Gryffindor and seeing the disastrous morning that Harry had already had he didn’t want to test his luck.
“Are you quite done, Mr. Potter, or would a few extra points from Gryffindor house put an end to that show you’ve got going on over there?”
There was a dead silence as they all stared at him and the conspicuously not-Gryffindor tie he was wearing.
Harry mumbled something incoherent into his pillow as he tried to find the blankets to pull around himself.
But eventually the bell rang and it was time for Harry’s moment of fate. Down to the dungeons and into his doom.
They were supposed to be in the Great Hall eating lunch, and if a teacher caught the whole lot of them just loitering around there’d be hell to pay.
Draco sighed with relief as he opened the door to the History of Magic classroom and found that Professor Binns had not noticed his absence.
Even Hermione of all people was tagging along behind everyone, reading a book as they walked and Harry tried shaking them off.
Nothing but pure and utter glee shone out from the girl’s eyes as she glanced down and back up quickly, whistling quietly.
“What?” Harry asked, suddenly agitated. Then he spotted Hermione out of the corner of his eyes, trying to suppress her laughter as she pointed at her collar, and it was at least several more moments before Harry remember, girls don't wear ties at Hogwarts.
By the time afternoon classes rolled around most Slytherin and Gryffindor students were positively buzzing.
“Wait!” Draco shouted after him. Harry spun around wildly, before being hit in the face with something. His hands immediately shot up to catch it and found his glasses.
The Gryffindors had taken as long as they had because Harry was looking for any excuse to double back to the tower.
Draco remained frozen, trying very, very hard not to let the rage he felt for his boyfriend at the moment to show on his face.
“Umm…” Harry stammered trying to push through. Denying it was useless, he wasn’t as clever as Draco, he wouldn’t be able to come up with a remotely convincing lie on time. Instead he grabbed around in his memories as he tried to come up with the name of any Slytherin girl. He had to know some of them, but in his panic they had completely fled his mind.
At this point the whispers had slowly spread out across the classroom until every Slytherin was surreptitiously staring at him, and the red and gold tie around his neck.
But at this point everyone was far too invested in figuring out the identity of his bedroom partner to care much for other consequences.
“I would sooner die.” He said, reaching up and starting to undo the knot, fed up with the whole ordeal. Just as he was tugging the horrid red and gold thing over his head, ready to sacrifice as many house points as was necessary to put an end to this, Professor Flitwick called out to him from the front of the class.
“Oh, for the love of Merlin, you’re all trying to kill me.” Harry had groaned loudly, trying not to imagine the hell he’d be put through when they saw who was wearing a Gryffindor tie among the Slytherins.
His face feeling distinctly hotter, Harry shook his head no and slid down into his seat as much as possible.
Blindly he grabbed at the clothes he’d been wearing yesterday, hoping he wasn’t putting them on inside out as he couldn’t really tell without his glasses.
These were always Harry’s favorite kind of mornings, the steady rise and fall of Draco’s breathing under his head as he snuggled into his chest, the warmth radiating from his body as he held to him tightly.
“I. Noticed.” The blond said tersely as he reached up and crammed the Gryffindor tie over his boyfriend’s head as roughly as possible, before tugging on the end harshly, as if he were trying to strangle Harry with it.
Harry bowed his head and hurried over to his seat, dumping his bag beside it and taking a moment to catch his breath. McGonagall continued with her lesson as he tried to fix himself up as discreetly as possible, noticing he had done up the buttons on his shirt wrong. He tightened his tie around his neck and fixed his collar.
He spotted Draco, standing at the front of the classroom, face as red as the tie around his neck he should not have been wearing.
Harry leaned up and pressed a short kiss to Draco’s jaw, the boy stirring from his sleep. His arms tightened around Harry a brief moment before relaxing. He ran his hand up the boy’s back, his neck, settling on the side of his face, which he pulled close to his own.
"Would they shame you, Draco?" Harry asked teasingly, feeling Draco twitching beneath him "Would they laugh at you? Call you a filthy whore? Tell you what you are?"
Harry sensed Draco's awkwardness, and kissed his cheek gently. He cast a cleaning spell for him  and slipped his hands around his waist, their bodies pressed together but his head still pulled back slightly allowing Harry to look at Draco clearly
Draco struggled against the restraints. He was totally exposed for Harry, naked and bound on his knees and his cock was aching for more. He needed more. He was just a cum slut and an object for Harry to use.
"Ah! Fuck! Ohh!" Draco gasped, clenching his eyes shut and dropping his forehead to the wall. He bit his lower lip to stifle the cries of pleasure and pain
"Whichever part makes you smile like that" Harry caressed his cheek "Sorry about the nail marks by the way.." he added, grimacing as Draco lifted his arm to inspect the scratches Harry had left on his skin during his intense orgasm
Harry had never been in the Slytherin common room before (that Draco knew of anyway) and finally here he was. Draco thought of how easy it would've been to get Harry into his bed now, only a short distance away, lock the door behind them and fuck all night. Nobody would even hear their cries of pleasure above the music anyway. It frustrated him that the one time Harry was actually here, was the only time Harry was no longer his
He sucked down hard on Draco's pale skin, leaving harsh marks across his neck up to his ear. Draco cried out softly, closing his eyes as Harry caressed him, owning him
Harry slid his arm around Draco's waist pulling him back but Draco's eyes remained on the floor, he couldn't let Harry see him break. He felt the shame stinging his chest from the vulnerability, embarrassed at putting himself out there and being shot down
Harry hung his head back, tongue in cheek. He wasn't about to start an argument now. Especially while he was naked
"Did you sneak back into the school or something?" Harry asked pulling George into a friendly hug, exchanging pats on the back, he was totally dumbfounded by their appearance but thrilled to see them
Malfoy didn't make eye contact, but there was a smirk on his face. Harry hated admitting it, but Malfoy looked good in just a towel. His body was pale and slender, his arms and back toned slightly. He was in shape, most likely from the Quidditch, and his long legs carried him gracefully as he walked
They entered the common room as if they owned it, which by now after seven years, they felt like they sort of did. All eyes darted to them as they stood at the top of the steps that lead down to the seating area, they were like the mean kids of the school, the popular ones, once they arrived, the party really got started.
Harry couldn't help by smile smugly, feeling pleased with himself "I think your erection spoke for itself really..."
They lay in silence, both sweaty and flushed with lazy smiles plastered across their faces. Draco closed his eyes and savoured every moment of what he'd just felt. For the first time, he didn't feel the shame. Harry tilted his head to the side, looking at Draco lying so peacefully
He ran his fingers through his hair which he had grown out more than previous years. Still short on the back and sides but far longer and scruffier on the top of his head, strands of platinum blonde bouncing from his fringe and falling loosely over his forehead, forming loose and messy curtains above his brows, his usual side-parting and slicked-back style were a thing of history
"Maybe" Harry twisted his mouth. He supressed the feelings that were growing in his chest, unable to place what it was exactly, but he knew he wanted to be around Draco all the time, to look after him, make him smile, give him everything and more. Draco was important to him, and yet somehow that scared him. Getting hurt by him was not an option. "I don't see any reason to pressure ourselves. We don't have to label it. Let's just enjoy the amazing sex we're having"
Draco blushed seeing Harry looking his way. They hadn't spoken since their last encounter and tensions were growing. Harry tried to distract himself with his breakfast, pouring cereal into the bowl and completely missing, sending wheat puffs everywhere
Suddenly Harry was caught off guard by the sight of Draco entering the great hall. He walked in with his head down, trailing behind Pansy and Blaise before taking a seat at their table. Blaise handed Draco a cup of coffee which he cupped in both hands, sipping cautiously before he finally looked up and caught Harry's gaze
Harry brought his hands up to Draco's cheeks and grabbed him in a hard kiss, their lips biting and sucking one another. Draco was flushed, hot shame rising through his chest at not only climaxing in front of Harry, but coming undone just from a little dirty talk
Draco looked out past the crowd and locked eyes with Harry who was across the floor, absent-mindedly watching Draco enjoying himself. Harrys expression stopped when he realised Draco was looking at him, kicking himself for being caught but he couldn't pull his gaze. As though his thoughts could penetrate Draco's mind, he looked at him with eyes of longing, and Draco felt the pit of his stomach drop. He so badly wanted to forget Harry but it was impossible. His mind was filled with every memory of him, every emotion
Unbreakable vows were a little bit extreme, but Draco wasn’t mad at Potter and Weasley for playing it safe. But still… Draco couldn’t shake off the feeling of fear and dread. Because at the end of this, Draco is going to have to leave, he’s going to have to punch out. As if Potter could read his thoughts, he walks over to Draco, placing his hand on his shoulder. Draco leans into his touch by a fraction of a fraction of an inch. The electricity that was caused was enough to send a shiver down his spine. Draco looks up, his eyes bore into Potter’s, his eyes asking, ‘what of my mother? Will she be okay?’ Potter gives Draco another squeeze on his shoulder, the touch feeling more affirmative.
When Draco gets to the building, he gets the feeling again. The one from yesterday evening, when he saw the figure. He looks around cautiously, un-clasping his leg pocket for quick access to his wand as he crosses the street to his job. He makes it through unscathed, and he then enters, immediately going to the employee area to punch in. This time around, he doesn’t see Helga or Darren. Not seeing Darren isn’t a 100% bad thing, but Helga’s pretty cool. After Draco punches in he then exits the building towards the nearest apparition point, this time his wand is at the
Draco glances at Potter for a moment, and shakes his head. He turns his back and goes back into the kitchen to finish cooking. Slightly annoyed that Dinner suddenly became lunch
At this Darren lifts his chin and raises his head slightly, so he could look down at Draco a little. He pauses for a beat, the tension in the room thick as buttercream. Darren sighs, and relaxes. Draco lets out a small breath he didn’t even know he was holding.
Without a word of response, Draco leaves the kitchen to check on the rooms, and maybe go outside for some fresh air. He goes upstairs and checks the rooms that he has access to. When he sighs in relief at the clean rooms and an even cleaner bathroom. He goes back downstairs, where he can faintly hear the hushed conversation between Weasley and Potter. He can hear little bits and pieces, like “He could be an asset” and “She’s not even British, but Belgian”. Whatever they’re talking about must be intense. Draco puts on his cloak and announces that he’s going to go outside for some air. He shrugs when he doesn’t get a response back, the hushed conversation is way more important.
And it’s just Potter, who has an amused look on his face and… is that Weasley? Of course it is, he knows that mop of red hair and freckles from anywhere.
Rocks began to build in Draco’s stomach, he gave Darren a wide eyed stare. He feels the air leave his body, he feels himself leave his body, a twisted form of astral projection into deep fear and anxiety. He feels himself come back just as quickly as he left, with one word lingering on his lips:
Narcissa walks to the young man, and she puts a platinum necklace on him. It was bright, sparkles glinting off of the delicate chain like a kaleidoscope.
hairs on end. He signs the paper and gives it to the man, who gives him a warm smile that made Draco flush.
34 weekends and 67 week days? Who does he think Draco is? A calculator? Draco does some level of mental gymnastics to figure out how long that is, and he’s settled at 3 months.
“You’ve already done it.” The man replies. “Here’s your contract.” He then turns the paper over to face Draco and hands him the quill. Draco takes a look over at the contract.
Darren pulls out a large manilla folder that is stuffed with papers. He pulls a small stack, and he hands it to Draco.
Potter then turns his back to Draco and stretches as he walks away, his deltoids and latissimus muscles flexing. It made Draco’s mouth a little dry. Draco shakes himself out of his potter-induced trance and he goes back to the pantry, getting the arabica coffee grounds and getting the coffee started
When he leaves his room, he walks downstairs and back to the front years, where there is a ministry worker lazily looking at the haulers but he fixes his posture and demeanor when he sees Draco. The worker looks extremely uncomfortable, like he doesn’t want to be where he is. The worker straightens his like green robes and hands Draco a paper, the deed to the estate. Draco conjures a quill and signs his rights to the house over to the ministry of magic.
The room was thick with tension, and Draco takes a deep breath, taking in the floral scent of the house, the little fragments of dark magic that the curse breakers couldn’t rid of. Even though he hates the idea of selling any of their properties, she was right about the manor. It hasn’t been home for a while. And even though the idea of selling the manor was painful, it was necessary. They’re Malfoys, after all.
When Draco checks his watch, it’s about noon. Funny how time is, it’s slow yet it goes by so fast. He tugs his coat closer to his body, and he lets out a breath that becomes a puff of smoke in the chilly air. He walks down the wet and broken cobblestone path to the nearest apparition point and with a dizzying twist, he’s gone.
What used to be full of books and childhood toys is now either moved out or packed up, waiting to be hauled away by the movers. Draco looks around, his chest burning a little from the emptiness. He noticed that his old Hogwarts trunk wasn’t packed with the rest of his things, so he shrinks the trunk and puts it in a box with his childhood possessions. He magically seals the box shut and stacks the box with the other pile of boxes that are meant to be picked up. He checks his closet for clothes that might’ve been left behind, but all he sees are empty shelves and hangers.
Helga is a beefy woman, Draco surmises. He takes in her large, sweaty olive-colored arms. The angry, bushy eyebrows, and the mole on her lip.
Draco gave the entire building a final once over. He shuddered, following it up by pulling the drawstrings on his cloak a little bit tighter. He makes his way towards the rotting wood door, walking up the sabby steps, mildly surprised that they even hold his weight. Draco looked at the rotting wood door, hesitating. Should he do this? Is this his only option? Initially, he was going to walk away, but the door opened and he was pulled in.
“We’ve got no money left.” Narcissa says calmly, her pale hand rubbing circles into Draco’s hunched back.
The smell was the first thing Draco picked up on. The main office of Holly Maid smells like mold and drywall. In fact, there was drywall chipping everywhere and there were piles on the floor. Draco could also see some rat droppings, and dust up to high heavens. The establishment was filthy, but what other choice did he have?
Potter, Weasley, and Draco all enter back into the house, with a little bit of a scuffle between Draco and Ron. Instead of going to the kitchen, Draco sat himself down on the immaculate couch and crossed his arms, his fingers tapping against his forearm expectantly.
As Draco is cooking, the smells of lemon, garlic and shrimp fills the kitchen and it smells godly. The sizzling of the shrimp is oddly music to Draco’s ears. He casually leans against the edge of one of Potter’s counters, watching the juices in the pan sizzle and pop, and from the corner of his eye, he sees some movement.
I've been thinking... maybe I should go on a short hiatus? I don't know if I should call it that honestly... I want to write chapters 9-13 and then post them weekly, instead of spending a week or two writing only one chapter. Hopefully writing gets me out of the block, and all 940 of you can have more consistent updates.
It took a while to find a realtor who will work with Draco and Narcissa. Most, if not all realtors based in Diagon Alley turned their noses up at the family, even though they were offering a high commission percentage. So, they had to look a little lower. Using what small connections that the Malfoys still have, they found a realtor based in… Knockturn. He was a shady man, who dressed in coal black robes, grey slacks, and a black petticoat. He kept his eyes hidden with his grey fedora, decorated with a bright green feather. But he knew what he was doing, and with time, he sold a villa in France. That was enough to keep him on.
“The deluxe package is 34 weekends worth of cleaning and 67 week days of assistance to the client. This includes being a nanny, going grocery shopping on their behalf, cooking, what have you.” Darren replies matter-of-factly.
Darren laughs, which breaks up the tense energy in the room. Draco returns the curious glare, and that causes Helga to squint her eyes even more, making her look like a buttered roll.
Nothing in it is bad. It states the percentage split, the exit clause, which is a clause stating that you have to give two weeks notice and void your last check. Nothing that sends Draco’s neck
“Yeah, all house-elf owners have to register their elves. I know this, I still own an elf.” Draco cuts Darren off with a quickness. Darren sighs once more.
Too bad it was most of the furniture. As Draco sees the movers magically haul the first batch of their things, he turns to his mother, whose face was twisted into a deep frown. He knows that this had to be hard on her as well. Even though Draco lost his father, she lost the love of her life. And now they’re both losing the place that they called home. Draco watches his mother enter back into the manor grounds, almost in a trance, as she pushes open the grey oak doors. Draco follows her inside. He watched her run her pale, slender hand up the polished staircase, he watched her run her fingers through the bookshelf, her blood red nails raking the surface of the time worn first editions. All the while Draco was watching, he saw the look of sadness and longing in her face.
Draco ponders on the numbers. 80% is a good percentage… And in due time, he’ll be able to slowly buy back all the items he pawned. And shoot, if he goes at it hard enough, maybe he can buy back his home.
“Have a good day at work, love.” She says, kissing him on the forehead, a gesture that Draco happily accepts.
“Wow,” Ron says, his face turning red from holding in his… laughter? “Who knew there’d be a Malfoy in the kitchen!” I guess his own words must’ve  tickled him, because at this point, Weasley is cackling at Draco’s expense.
Draco couldn’t help but give Darren an incredulous look. The man stole his wand, gave it back during trials, and left. The man sliced his chest open, the man saved his life. It would be absolutely awful if he didn’t know him.
Client information? How did Darren even get info on Potter? Draco takes the stack, and he looks at several pages. Grimmauld place… isn’t that his Ancestral home? How did Potter acquire it? A thousand questions swirls in his head as he reads document after document. He knows where Potter lives, skin allergies, food allergies, all of it. Very detailed. After a while, Draco slides the stack back to Darren, who takes it from him, his fingers gently brushing against Draco’s. It made a shiver crawl down his spine.
“We will not be needing your ‘connections’.” Draco says, cutting this man off. “Sell this Manor and sell it the right way… the legal way.” he finishes, sending the realtor a sneer.
Another 6 pager! And this time it isn't worthless fluff. Things are picking up now... what do you guys think might happen? Let's talk about it! And constructive criticism is always welcome! :) Chapter 8 coming soon ;)
“Put the pieces together Malfoy!” Darren exclaims. “Why do you think you needed to learn basic self defense?”
Draco tears his eyes away from the green and blue, and he looks at the floor for a moment. Then a memory comes into his head.
“Were you the one watching Darren and I?” Draco asks, and Harry confirms this by scratching the back of his head.
“I remember when you were a babe you once turned your father’s hair blue. Blue as the sky.” She turns to Draco. “His face… he looked like he wanted to pop and hug you all at once.” Her eyes welled up with tears, but they didn’t spill from her delicate face.
Draco digs at his dress pants for the brass key. He hands it to the worker who inspects it with a careful eye.
Potter stops drinking his coffee mid-sip, and raises his eyebrow. He puts the cup down, and looks at Draco.
From this comment, this caused Draco to tilt his head and narrow his eyes slightly. Of course he caught on that this isn’t a regular maid service, he didn’t think they would need to know how to fight.
Draco gives Ron an incredulous look. Then he shoots a quick glance at Harry, who shrugs his shoulder. Classic.
“It happened here in this room. Your Hogwarts letter, when your father gave you your watch… it all happened here.” She blinked and a fat tear rolled down her face, collected at her chin, and fell onto the dark wood flooring.
ready. When he gets there alright, he then imagines Grimmauld Place, and with a quick tug he’s gone.
The interior of Holly Maid was that of night and day. Where there was cracked paint and moldy crown moulding, is replaced with smooth baby blue walls and a warm, open space with plenty of light coming in from the clean windows. Draco takes himself to Bates’ office. He knocks the hardwood door and takes a seat. Darren opens the door and gives Draco a warm smile.
“You… you should go and double check your room. Make sure all your stuff is packed up. I’ll be okay.” Narcissa says, and she leaves Draco, going to other parts of the manor to grieve the memories that lie there.
“You know what? Don’t worry about it. Someone’s gonna teach you some basic cleaning spells. Malfoy, isn’t it?” The man says, waving his wand to produce a quill and ink.
It was a painless affair, moving in. With the elves that they had left, the movers, and Draco, the Malfoy pair moved in comfortably. Draco takes a once over at the living room, placing his hand on the matte white wall. The brown rattan couches and loveseats matched perfectly with the white animal fur carpet. And the brown coffee table brings it all together. The elves really know their interior design. Draco leaves the living room, and goes up into his room. He insisted that he would unpack his room on his own, but the boxes were stacked around all haphazardly in his little room. Some were even put on top of his bed and stuffed in his closet. Draco lets out the most weary sigh, and he walks to his bedroom window. His grey eyes look up to the moon, and in the stillness of it all, he cries.
“Let me finish. Since the SPEW act was put into law… there are some people who would benefit from various cleaning services that’s a bit under the table.” Darren says cooly, leaning back in his chair.
“Think of it as getting some of your money back… they way they threw that 300,000,000 million galleon fine,” He tips his fedora. “Sure beats life in Azkaban and the Dementor’s kiss, though.”
Draco then puts his cloak on and he exits his home, the Holly Maid building forming in his mind as he feels the tug and pull of apparition.
“Here, have a seat.” Bates waves his wand and conjures a nearby chair behind Draco. Draco gives him a curt nod and he takes a seat.
“No!” Draco exclaims, jerking his body from the emerald green couch. “We will not sell the Manor. Over my dead body.”
Potter sits on the barstool. Potter’s strong, large hands encase the mug, and Draco notices that there is no band. Isn’t he married? What does that mean? Why does he have wedding photos?
When Draco comes back from his shopping excursion, he walks into the house with two large bags, with leafy greens peeking from over one bag and another is just full of cans and tightly wrapped meats and fish. Draco makes his way back to the kitchen, setting the paper bags on the counter and he begins to pull his ingredients out. Since he knows that Potter comes home way past the end of his shift, he’s going to prepare his dinner now and pack them up for later. Draco decided that he was going to make a light shrimp scampi, a recipe that he found and wrote down while he was shopping. He pulls out his 1lb bag of shrimp, a couple of lemons, red pepper flakes,
Draco opens the satchel and lo and behold, it’s grocery money. As Draco is counting out the galleons, he hears the front door open and close. With Harry out to work, he can go shopping, and maybe tidy up around the house.
“Mum,” Draco says, raising a hand to her. “We don’t have any connections, and I would rather eat Crup shit than to see you work a menial job.”
Training was… not too bad. Draco learned both magical and muggle ways of cleaning. How to properly cast a scourgify, how to fold towels, clean toilets… Draco learned it all and he caught on well. Now the ‘self defense’ portion… that was a joke. Draco had to learn and master non-magical self defense. And that was grueling. He didn’t fully grasp on how to defense from the behind, and ended up getting flipped (multiple times) by Helga. After several brackium emendos, and half a bottle of pain potions, Draco was ready to finally deal with a client.
Draco can feel the rage pool in his stomach. Never did he think he would sell his house to the Ministry. But if it’s needed, it’s needed.
Draco is severely confused; how could Darren not know the type of relationship he had with Potter? Draco had his suspicions when he was hired off the bat, maybe Darren didn’t know his place in the war? No, that’s impossible. There is no running from what he did. But still, it’s odd that he doesn’t know.
Potter doesn’t say anything. Instead he takes another sip of coffee and gives Draco a look, like he’s deciding if he should give him the money or not.
There was a black, tornado-like swirl that moved around the office. It settled at the empty chair that lays on the other side of the desk. Once the smoke cleared out, there is a man, with slicked back hair, deep brown eyes, and pink lips. The cloak that he wore is absolutely immaculate, with lace trim and a satin finish.
“I can sell a couple of heirlooms… some old clothes. That can get us by for a little while until I can get us going again.”
“I’ll go out to Diagon, see if I can get one from there.” Draco says. Narcissa gives him a wary look in response, and he shrugs it off.
As Draco was letting everything sink in, a barn owl entered from a window, a letter clutched in it’s claws. It flies over the desk, dropping the letter and giving Darren an expectant look. Darren opens one of his desk drawers for an owl treat. He feeds the owl, who in turn gives the man a slow blink before flying away. Darren once again opens his desk drawer and pulls out a small golden letter opener and with a swift movement of his wrist, he gets the letter cleanly open. He pulls out the parchment from within and he reads it over. Draco, who is still as a statue, has enough mulling over, and his alarm raises when Darren gets up from his desk chair and paces around the room, his fingers combing through his soft, brown hair as his deep brown eyes scan each word. At the end of the letter, Darren is at the window where the owl flew from, and he turns to face Draco.
Someone is in the house. Wand at the ready, Draco moves himself from the counter and slowly makes his way towards the entrance of the kitchen. As he gets closer and closer to the figure, he notices that it isn’t just one person but two. On edge, Draco braces himself and he jumps out, his wand pointed at the two would-be robbers-
Draco sighs into his hands, trying to take comfort in the slight gesture but isn’t able to. Feeling weary, he leans against his mother, and she switches from rubbing circles to patting his soft platinum hair.
Draco’s blood ran cold. The Ministry? The Ministry’s the reason they’re broke! This man… this man is talking about selling their house to the same institution who put them in this predicament! The realtor feels the change in the room and he clears his throat.
“A knock would suffice next time, Potter.” Draco remarks, putting his wand away. “I have to go back in the kitchen-”
When Draco returns to the main office, this time a little worn out and sore. Darren gives Draco a smile, taking a seat in his office chair. He puts his elbows on the desk and rests his chin on the back of his hands.
“It’s not sellin’,” He tells Draco and Narcissa one afternoon. “Tha house has too much history, and that history’s still… fresh.”
“I’m curious Mister Malfoy… you’ve never once asked about our clientele…” Darren narrows his dark brown eyes, piercing into Draco’s silver eyes.
His mother was of course wary of Draco doing such menial work, but she can’t really change his mind on the matter. But the daggers that she sent to Draco as he went down stairs with his breakfast tea was enough to send a chill down his spine.
Draco straightens his posture and he takes confident strides to his mother, where he envelops the woman in a loving embrace and feels her body shake as sobs wracked her body. While only a few minutes had passed, it felt like hours to Draco. He lets up the embrace with his mother, and she wipes her eyes with the excess fabric that bell-bottom sleeves provide.
“Of course I’m going to do it the legal way you git,” He started, not being bothered by the glares sent from both Draco and Narcissa. “I’m saying I can use my connections from the ministry to get this house sold.”
“You had me worried! I was scared because of you!” Draco snaps, and Harry’s face becomes clouded by guilt. Ron kisses his teeth.
“You should probably get going,” Darren says, clearing his throat and turning his head. Did he feel that chill too?
“Make some coffee on the pot will you? I’ll be back down in a few minutes or so.” Potter says, yawning.
“A shady man who sent someone after me!” Draco exclaims. “I’m in danger! Why would I risk my life… my mother’s life to snitch on you two?!” He says, getting up and the pink returning in his face.
And like a pair of puppies, Potter and Weasley come running down the stairs and barreling in the kitchen, their bodies a blend of burgundy and red. They take their seats at the barstool and Draco hands them forks.
“Yeah, sure. It’s my job to do that.” He replies. And a brown satchel was placed on the counter, and Harry gets up and leaves, leaving behind his finished coffee mug.
Darren raises his eyebrow, but lowers it. He must’ve realized that he never actually went over how the maid packages worked. Darren sighs and he does a little stretch.
Draco turns his head slightly to look up at his mother, whose features are soft and understanding. Draco sighs and he sits up.
Harry hadn't really considered his feelings much, in fact he was so invested in indulging in the kink aspect that he hadn't given it much thought
"I said-" Harry forcefully grabbed his jaw, yanking his head up to face the mirror "look at yourself" he ordered, and Draco winced seeing his reflection
Harry gradually joined him, sitting carefully beside Draco on the bed. He slipped his hand over Draco's and linked their fingers together. He then turned to face him
Draco's faint smell of cologne that always lingered on his soft skin as Harry kissed every part of him
"Don't worry about it" Draco chuckled "It's fine. Besides I kinda like you leaving your mark on me... it reminds me of the hot sex we just had"
Draco looked around to make sure they really were alone before speaking "I thought about showing up late but figured you'd have your way with me regardless"
Harry looked up at Draco with is mischievous smile, gliding his tongue across his teeth seductively. He planted gentle kisses across either side of Draco's thighs, holding him against the wall with his hands. Draco moaned out as he then held his tongue in front of the tip, making Draco wait painfully for his touch
Harry faltered. He did have feelings. Strong feelings. It was all too conflicting and confusing and he was too scared to admit it. He felt like a coward, watching Draco open up and take the pain head on while he kept himself hidden, denying what was there, realising Draco was stronger than he could ever be
"Bizarre, I know" Harry smiled, shaking his head at the absurdity of it "But we want the same things and we've already seen what I can do to you... so why not?"
"Mmm.." Draco groaned, tugging against the leather straps that were digging into his wrists. The spread bar was cold as the metal rested on the back of his shoulders, across his lower neck, his hands spread out at his sides above him
"Exactly. You're nothing to me. You're pathetic and worthless and a disgrace. I should just cum on you and leave you here ready for next time"
Harry tugged on the leash causing Draco to moan out "Come on, I want you to look at yourself in the mirror" He lead him over to the wall, Draco couldn't bare to look at himself he felt so ashamed. He crawled on his hands and knees behind Harry
"Ohhh, someone wants to be fucked, do they?" Harry said in a patronising tone, looking down at him like filth. Draco dropped his head and gasped feeling Harry's slicked fingers circling his hole "Tell me why you want to be fucked, Slut"
The two of them were fucking hard, and it was hot and sweaty and messy and everything they'd ever wanted. Draco was getting weaker, his arms starting to falter unable to hold himself up in front of the mirror
"Or cake hate!" Pansy teased "C'mon Draco, he's cute, dressed well and clearly showing an interest in you... if you don't snag him up I will"
Harry slumped against the table, dropping his head back with a resigning sigh, feeling even more confused and desperate than before
"Will you show me.. next time?" Draco asked "I really loved what you did before.. when you spanked me"
The pinnacle of his entire look however, was the subtle smoky black eyeliner. It wasn't overdone, just enough to accentuate his stunning silver eyes, contrasting his pale complexion and shining hair perfectly, blended softly around the sides but still dark enough to be enticing
His heart was hammering his chest with each step forward. Everything had fallen into slow motion, it felt like an eternity as he drifted closer toward Draco, everyone around him was alive with the music, the air so thick with the flashing from the fireworks and heat of the bodies they might as well have been underwater
Draco was whining in arousal now, his cock pressed against Harry's groin. Harry looked down with a smirk, enjoying Draco's desperation. "You're not allowed to cum, are you Slut?"
"Pity. I'm surprised you haven't found someone else to satisfy your stingy sexual appetite. Have you not found another poor soul willing to drop to their knees for you for a no-strings attached fuck?" Draco retorted "That's all you want isn't it?"
Harry slowly pulled out, feeling his cock slick against Draco's backside. Draco winced in the moment but watched as Harry cast a cleaning spell and rolled onto his back, sliding in beside Draco
He picked up the collar and unfastened the clasp at the back, pulling it around Draco's neck and clicking it back into place. He tightened the leather around his neck, just enough for Draco to feel it dig into his skin and held the leash that attached to it. He stood back up, looking down at the blonde who was at his feet
The music had miraculously gotten louder and Fred and George had sent a magic flare up to the ceiling causing a strobe light effect of continuous mini fireworks to explode above the dance floor. Harry had to admit, it did look hypnotic seeing the dark room filled with different colours flashing and twirling in all directions above them
Draco stayed still for a moment, still bent over leaning against the sink as Harry pulled his trousers back up and fastened his belt
"Wh-what's wrong?" Harry paused, and dropped the paddle as soon as he heard the word. His heart sank as he moved over to Draco, still laying into the sheets, avoiding Harry's eyes. Draco clumsily moved position, bringing himself back up to sitting on the bed, wincing at his sore backside
Draco pushed up from the bed and walked over to join her in the mirror, straightening out his outfit one last time. He was wearing an oversized black silk shirt, with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and half the top buttons were undone which teased his toned chest from underneath, subtle silver chains hung loosely around his neck, matching the rings on his fingers.
There was a large, round bed at the back, covered in silk sheets and mounds of soft pillows. The room was dimly lit and cosy. Harry kicked off his shoes and pulled his t-shirt over his head, his unruly hair bouncing in all directions. Draco thought he looked cute as his brunette curls flopped over his forehead
"Good boy, Draco. Swallowing my cum like the obedient little slut you are" he slid his two fingers under Draco's chin, tilting him up to meet his eyes, cum still dripping from his parted lips. He knelt down to meet him head on and Draco watched as his pleased expression suddenly switched to serious "Don't think I'm done with you yet though... you fucking whore"
Draco nodded reluctantly and did as he was told. His cock was already rising, the heat of Harry's dominance arousing him as usual
Draco felt his cock stiffen instantly as Harry's cock pressed into his groin. They began walking backwards, still locked in a passionate kiss, arms caressing and legs intertwined until Draco hit the back wall and Harry held him their with his body.
Draco began making his way back to Harry who caught him off guard by pouncing onto him, pushing him against the wall. He forced himself onto Draco's lips desperately and caressed up and down his torso, feeling the bulge in his pants growing tremendously. Harry then kissed up to his neck fiercely
Draco turned on his heel but said nothing. His expression was plain, almost unbothered which stung Harry a little
Harry sped up, tasting Draco so sweetly in his mouth, feeling his body trembling under his touch. He began to suck harder and watched as Draco reached the edge of orgasm through cries and moans of ecstasy
Draco was on all fours, his back arching up as Harry demanded. He hung his head beneath the arms holding him up while his shoulders pulled back, his shoulder blades poking through the milky skin on his back
Draco held his tongue and glanced back at to the crowd past her shoulder to check they were still alone before whispering "We've already had the forbidden potion in your room now this! I don't want to end up in the hospital wing tonight!"
"Please... master.." Draco writhed beneath him, his eyes wide as he witnessed Harry's orgasm and felt him climaxing hard inside of his hole
"Ohh poor Draco.." Harry mocked, crouching down to Draco's level but the blonde still couldn't meet his eyes "You're such a mess"
Harry shrugged a little, placing the words together in his mind "What we've been doing.. you're enjoying it, right?"
Draco clamped his eyes shut and bit down, masking the curses under his breath as Harry slowly pushed inside of him. It was painfully tight, especially with his knees against his chest, he felt so open and exposed for him compared to previous positions "Fuck! Harry!"
"Get on your knees and show me your tongue" Harry ordered, tugging on the leash again. Draco scrambled up, his cock dripping threads of cum between his thighs
Neither of them spoke as they both regained themselves, melting back to reality together. Harry gradually let the mask of dominance slip, opening up a safe space for Draco to recover. Draco navigated the emotions running through him; pleasure, shame, lust, humiliation, longing.
"Are we getting wrecked tonight, boys?" Seamus called, swigging his drink and bouncing to the music "I think so!" he necked the rest of it with wild eyes, grinning from ear to ear. The other boys joined in with their cheers, buzzing with adrenaline as the music blared out, vibrating through their bodies. Harry downed the rest of his drink hoping to feel the effects of calm washing over him
Harry sucked Draco's lower lip before dragging his tongue up his jawline and onto his neck where he nibbled his ear and whispered "Is this proof enough for you?"
Harry allowed his friends to leave them be before slowly approaching Draco, checking the hallway was empty before opening his mouth
Draco walked across to the door and opened it, checking there was no one outside. He turned back to see Harry, who was still kneeling on the bed naked, confused at his eagerness to leave. He met Harry's eyes and with a wistful smile which masked the shame burning into him and walked outside, closing the door behind him
"Doesn't it" Harry smirked "Unless you're planning on recreating your sex dream then by all means, Ill meet you in there". He sat back up and reached down the side of the bed, picking up the unfinished pancakes that he'd left earlier "Besides, we can get whatever we want in here" he grinned, stabbing his fork through a strawberry
"What's wrong? What's happened?" Blaise asked, but Draco remained silent. He peeled Draco off gently, holding him at his shoulders and looking deep into his puffy red eyes with an expression of both worry and sympathy
He smirked at the sight that lay before him and began fisting Draco's cock harder as Draco tugged against the ties, eyes closed and panting desperately. Harry was touching him in all the right places, sliding his hand up and down feeling his foreskin slipping back and forth over the head of his leaking cock
"Please don't walk away from me, I want to be here for you afterwards. Making sure that you're okay. Making sure you're not hurt"
Draco was still smiling wickedly which was winding Harry up more "Poor Potter! How terrible for you not getting your way like you always do" he rolled his eyes
Malfoy tested the hot water with his hands first, then slid them through his hair which was its usual shade of platinum blonde, short on the back and sides with a careless fringe that fell over his forehead. Harry felt his chest flutter a little at the sight of the Slytherin half naked, dropping his towel as the water crashed over his body.
and in that instant Harry forced a lubricated finger straight into Draco's tight hole. Draco yelped out at the new sensation. He threw his head back, gasping
Harry began caressing and clawing all over Draco's skin, leaving his marks and he scratched onto his back "oh fuck!" Draco cried as Harry slammed into his prostate. Draco brought his arm forward, biting down onto his forearm, to stifle the screams and moans of pleasure.
His slim legs fit gorgeously into a pair of black cropped trousers and Italian leather shoes, his shirt half tucked in and out loosely fitting his slender frame.
Harry then reached around from behind and began stroking Draco's throbbing cock causing Draco to yelp at his touch, ecstasy rippling through him
Harry climbed off the bed and walked in a circle around Draco, who felt ridiculous being in that position while Harry remained fully clothed above him. Draco's eyes fixed on the floor, feeling like an animal being watched, his cheeks flushed and hot
Draco thought for a moment, then smiled as a tray appeared on the bed beside them. There were two plates filled with pancakes, covered in an assortment of bananas, cream, syrup and strawberries. Draco eyes lit up and Harry adored how in that moment Draco looked so cute, filled with excitement over food
Hey lovely readers! Sorry it's been a while, I barely got a chance to write last week but I hope you enjoy this chapter. The next chapter is also written and I'll be posting it very soon! :)
"You did so well" Harry whispered. As he leant in to kiss his neck, Draco pushed up from the bed and collected his clothing from the floor. Harry could see the redness across his arse cheeks, his skin blotted from each strike of his hand "Draco?"
Draco shook his head and Harry waved his wand making a mirror appear on the wall opposite. Draco moaned as his eyes met the reflection. Naked and hard on his hands and knees, the collar pressed around his neck like an animal
"Yes, you do Harry" Draco huffed, still smiling as a way to keep the tension low "I ask you time and time again what this is, and you make it very clear that it's not a relationship"
"I need it. I can't be strong all the time. My family have always held me to a ridiculously high standard, my friends all look to me as a leader. Sometimes... I just want someone else to be in control"
"You know you want it" Harry finally whispered in Draco's ear causing him to shudder at the sensation. Harry then bit down on Draco's neck
"I feel so disgusting" Draco whispered through ragged breath. His voice cracking as Harry saw his eyes glassing over with fresh tears
Draco swallowed another wave of humiliation as he inhaled slowly and parted his lips. Harry smiled, bringing the tie down and forcing it across Draco's mouth, tying it around the back of his head making sure it was tightly held in place, but still loose enough to be comofortable for him. Draco moaned instantly, biting down on the fabric and feeling it force his lips apart, unable to speak, only soft cries and whimpers escaped him
Harry was sat beside Dean and Neville, engrossed by something in Neville's textbook. He was glad Harry was distracted, it allowed him more time to fixate on his perfect features that Draco missed caressing so much
He pulled his knees to his chest and began fidgeting with the hem of his jumper "I... I... think I did something really stupid.."
"You're a dirty, filthy animal" Harry spat, pulling down the waistband on his sweatpants and reaching for his cock
Draco remained on all fours patiently waiting for Harry to begin. He could feel Harry's hands caressing his skin that sent shivers through him.
Harry groaned and cursed under his breath, dropping his head back in ecstasy as his climax filled every fibre of his body. As the orgasm settled over him, his breathing was heavy and his face flushed. He reopened his eyes and looked down at Draco on his knees
They repositioned, Draco laying over the bed, his arms stretched out in front of him, his legs spread apart. Harry had laid out the implements in front of Draco as a reminder of what was coming. Draco stifled his moans of pleasure as the hot arousal filled every inch of him. He loved being in this position, especially for Harry
"And so Freddie sent an owl to McGonagall asking if we could visit you and Ginny for the Christmas break"
"As hard as I'm gonna spank yours?" Harry smirked. He loved how easy it was to get under Draco's skin
Draco looked at Harry for a moment, wanting to trust him so completely. His lips were parted slightly and he studied Harry's face, finally seeing him properly for the first time
20 minutes passed by while Draco remained on his knees, which by now were painfully sore and red, his naked body getting colder. He moaned quietly under his breath, a combination of discomfort, shame and pleasure running through him. He adored being on his knees for Harry, he'd never felt such degradation and he craved every moment of it. Left to stew in his mess like an object, tossed aside by Harry for being so useless. He could feel the heat still pulsating in his groin
"You call me, Master!" Harry smacked his arse hard and Draco cried out suddenly. He pressed forward, grabbing Draco by the back of the neck and forcing his head against the wall so Draco's cheek was pressed into the stone. He leant forward into his ear "Don't you?"
"Y-yes Master... I'm just a.. pathetic... worthless cum-slut.. for you" Draco whimpered. He scrunched his eyes shut letting his head lull back, the arousal alone was making him weak
"You're still really awkward around me, aren't you?" Harry probed, smirking at how Draco always went quiet when the conversation got soppy
"Mmmph!" Draco moaned biting down on Harry's shoulder as Harry slammed into his prostate. Draco's knees were almost beside his head now, folded in half.
Draco looking longingly into Harry's eyes as he handed over all of his trust and submitted to Harry's every need
He panted and cried through the gag, jerking beneath Harry feeling the sticky cum stripe the sheets below him. Harry panted and grinned, wiping the sweat from his brow, looking down at Draco coming totally undone beneath him, his arse still gripping Harry's cock tight as his whole body spasmed with pleasure and tensed over and over
Draco, in his bewildered state, couldn't help but catch a glimpse of Harry's cock, hanging between his legs as he marched over. His body was slim but toned, with golden skin and slicked back hair. Malfoy had never paid any attention to him like this before, but now he was interested
"Open your mouth, Slut. I want you to taste my cum" Harry bit, jerking his cock in his fist, panting through moans of pleasure. Draco opened his mouth obediently and Harry felt his orgasm riding through him
"Ooooh am I winding you up?" Malfoy teased, grinning at the shower wall imagining Harry getting red faced and angry
As they reached the top of the steps, Draco turned back around and caught Harry in another heated kiss, caressing his cheeks before stepping back. "I do belong to you" he whispered in Harry's ear before taking his hand once more.
Draco moaned desperately, feeling the tie across his mouth wet with saliva as it dripped down his chin. He tugged against his cuffs and pushed back, begging out for more as Harry's orgasms triggered his own. His cock twitched beneath him, hot cum shooting from the tip as he cried out, gripping tightly into the sheets feeling as though every part of him was alive
"Good Slut" he bit down on his exposed neck and pulled out his fingers "Would you like to feel more?"
He sucked and licked gorgeously, caressing the shaft and teasing the tip, moving up and down all the while watching Draco beg and moan and gasp underneath him. Draco fisted the sheets, arching his back to push himself deeper down Harry's throat
Harry scowled at the table, biting his tongue. He plucked the clump of butter from his lap and wiped it on his plate
"The Slytherin Party? The one they host every year at the end of Winter term?" he beamed, surprised that the others weren't as excited as him
Harry bowed his head fumbling through his mind to find the right words to say "I-I'm sorry that I upset you"
There was a long silence that filled the room. Harry stroking Draco's hair while he lay with his head on Harry's chest, surrounded by the warmth from both their bodies pressed together
Draco thought for a moment. His mind was conflicted on whether or not this was the smartest decision to make, but his heart wanted this, he wanted Harry. He wanted his touch, his lips, his cock. What Harry had done to him in the last two days was like nothing he'd ever felt before. He was all he could think about in the last forty-eight hours
Harry pushed slowly, feeling the resistance against his cock but the slickness allowed him to feel as Draco was stretched. Harry's cock sliding into his hole gradually, the feeling of being filled and stretched overwhelming him
"Oh shut up" Draco nudged him. Harry placed his coffee down beside the bed and rolled over so he was on top of Draco, his knees either side of Draco's thighs. Their lips met instantly in a passionate kiss as Harry caressed his hands over his torso and up his neck, pulling him close. Draco moaned between kisses, which Harry planted from his lips to his chest and everywhere in between
He felt his cock release inside of Draco, riding waves of pleasure feeling his cum shooting into him. He grunted under his breath, jerking as the climax washed over him. He was hot and sweaty, panting out of breath. The moment his orgasm finished he broke into a grin, wiping the sweaty strands of fringe out from his eyes and brushing it back through his hair
