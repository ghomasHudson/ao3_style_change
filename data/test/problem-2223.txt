“Please, find your places, it is time to begin.” Grinholt said to the assembled. As the three split Grinholt could not help but think that in those three he was seeing a new generation rise.
"Ninety percent, try one hundred percent, name one Albion house that is not sworn to an ancestral house of Albion." Pansy snapped. "You can't because there isn't one."
"To House Potter I give my final offering." Neville spoke giving the remaining food on his plate as offering and once more shocking those behind them. "The House of Potter has long honored my own house and for that I give it thanks for standing both beside my brother and for aiding him in his time of need for that I thank thee and give thee honor that the House grows and prospers still in all that it does."
"It should, that why we decided to make it an Albion fund and open to all the empire. The ministry can't legally touch it without the support of at least 25 houses from outside Albion of equal standing to house Potter and with every house that adds their name to the protectorate list, that number grows."
"The law is to specific, it catches to many things, the main thing that Heir Potter, is talking about is when it gives the definition of what consists of the band meetings, it's both to stringently worded, as well as being to openly worded, and able to be used in almost any situation."
“Bill, can you shed any light on what Harry might have done while in the bank today?” Inquired Albus.
"It has happened exactly four times since the inception of the Sorting hat and the leaving of the founders." Said Harry as the hall went deathly silent not even Minerva calling out the names of firsties. "The first time heralded in the war of the shadow mages, which ended in the placing of the eleventh seal, the second was the black war which ended in the pacing of the last and final 12th seal, the third warned of the death of our last king and the rise of the traitor, The last and final warning was in 1927, it spoke of the threat of Grindelwald." said Harry Potter.
“They will remain, this, after all, will be covered by their vassal oaths, I do believe.” Answered Harry.
"Lilly Potter nee Evans you are my mother and your sacrifice has never been forgotten. I may not have been raised knowing of your sacrifice, but I understand now what a sacrifice it was, and for that I live my life in honor of that sacrifice. May I make you proud." Harry spoke again giving a sacrifice from his plate again.
"That is enough Mr. Potter, these lies and accusations have gone on long enough, your Parents would be very ashamed of the man you have become. Furthermore, I don't know where you got such a ridiculous thought that Grindelwald was about to attack but I will not have you spread such rumors around…" She was interrupted by a boom from outside.
Beyond words at this point Marvolo was only answering with spell fire at this point as most of the battle had stopped around them watching the impressive display of magic. Now he finally answered, "I will be King, and all of Albion will bow before me, that brat of a boy most of all."
"Potter," interjected Ron before anyone else could speak. "They already have been titled by the Royal house; they are the commanders of Albion's armies. They have if I'm doing my math right already achieved the 1800-year requirement for the title, I don't know about the vault part for the title of Utmost Noble though."
“Wow,” Said Harry as they entered the bank and where quickly ushered through the arching doorways and winding Passages to Sharptooth’s office.
“Well now that does change things, what seems to be the issue, besides the Daily Prophet, as their smear campaign is sanctioned by the minister I cannot do anything about it.” She asked.
Harry read this letter twice as well, Alomar had gone on to tell stories of living in the palace the pains of having to deal with his disgruntled older brothers and the constant manipulations and maneuverings he had to immerse himself into to maintain the position he had. This Harry could understand, slipping the letters into a secure pocket of his close he turned to Neville. "Well how does spending Christmas along the Nile sound Neville?" Harry asked offering the portkey to Neville.
Suddenly the orb goes black, and a hazy, ethereal crystal-clear scene can be seen, a castle far more giant than Hogwarts appears, with a large city surrounding it, the image plays over the city before focusing in on the castle itself. As this happens, he sees a blurry of two people, one an older man he looks much like his grandfather with key differences he couldn't place. The man holds the hands of a child, that has the Malfoy blonde hair and other vital features that mark him as a Malfoy. They stand in front of a statue of 3 men fighting side by side valiantly. The little boy looks up and pointing at one of the men, asks, "Grandfather, who was he, and why do I look like him?"
"We will do as we have always done be obedient but mindful of the people, reminding our king that he serves more than the noble's." At the incredulous look he received Neville said. "There's not really much we can do, we are bound to the king's throne."
But the magic hesitated, some of those that surrounded it would wake with this, others he was sure his boy would waken if only to aid in the current situation. Responsibilities came with these lines, would his boy be strong enough to carry all of them? It hesitated a moment longer before remembering the memories he had searched through earlier, his boy had faced both a basilisk and a Dragon, he had faced down lords that refused to see the power of his house in his eyes. He would fulfill his responsibilities and surpass them, of this the magic was sure.  With that decision made the magic of house Potter activated the one safeguard all Olde houses had. At that moment the clock struck midnight, and it became July 31, 1995.
“And what all are you looking for my lord?” Asked Corsair as they started walking, they arrived at the Menagerie.
Abraxas smiled, "That is delightful Draco, in preparation for that you must take my teachings carefully, for it will mean the return of the court, and each country will vie for them to have the favor of Albion's King. You will need your knowledge to circumvent them and to keep the king's favor. Now finish your breakfast; it is almost time to go."
Artemis cut in answering, "Grindelwald spoke of house secrets that not even house Longbottom knows. The fact of the matter is that house Potter, like Le-Fay, like Black, like Malfoy, and so many other houses, has magic that if used against Grindelwald would end this war.
"What do you know of the legacy of your family, of the family magic, of the history of your lineage, of your power in our world? What do you know of our traditions of our victories of our defeats? Do you know of anything of the family, of your legacy of your responsibilities in our world?"
It is from these letters that I learn of much that has happened to you, and of the many decisions you have been forced to make. I agree with my grandmother that I would like to meet you, and perhaps exchange a few letters before we meet. If grandmother believes you are important to Egypt's future than you are a friend I need. In this I have also enclosed a few of my own secrets that we may stand on equal terms…
"Interesting, last I had heard that specific Potter Grimoire was locked down, I will have to hear the story behind its reopening from you at some point in time, in the meantime you have given me plenty to do, with your call last night and now this, I best get back to work." Andromeda said with I smile before signing off. The sudden absolute silence from the rest of the hall caught Harry's attention as he too turned to the doors where Lord Le-Fay and his entourage walked in, Harry turned back to Ignatius political grimoire only partially keeping an ear on the entering lord. As the heirs of many houses that had been trying to cozy up to Harry for weeks now practically prostrated themselves before Marvolo Harry took little notice beyond watching Artemis taking down the names of those that did.
"I am showing some respect, I haven't declared blood feud between our houses, what Dumbledore has done to the house of Potter was unforgivable. I am showing the exact amount of respect he deserves." Hermione harrumphed and returned to her book. "I changed the 1 percent retainers fee to 4 percent and made it tiered, so if he returns the dividends of house Potter to matching that of when my parents were alive within the next year then he will receive a 6 percent commission. If he managed to double that he will receive 10 percent. I set that up and then gave him access to only 10 percent of the family fortune. He's since then halfway returned the percentage to what it had been, in the few weeks since the trial. I then gave him access to 25% of the Potter wealth to invest; it will work well for me I believe."
“Ok, let me start at the beginning then, as you don’t know what happened.” Tonks said. “but before I start that expand your mirror and allow me to link in a few other mirrors. It will be easier if we can all explain at once, rather than you receiving pieces from all of us at different times.” After Artemis, and the rest of Harry’s house had all been linked in and most of the Royals had left, Tonks motioned for Artemis to begin.
“Peace young heir, he to feels a draw to you and like me and most Potter bearers requires more than one bonded, trust me Draco he has enough room in his heart for you as well.”
"You have your answer then, House Potter declines, as the contract was not signed by a proper head of house the contract is not binding and will not be honored by House Potter." Harry answers not taking his eyes off of the Prince.
"Blood locked takes a single ritual to possibly unlock. Blood rites however are not your standard ritual, they have severe consequences of not fully passing them. Even if you pass blood rites, the magic may still take punishment from you." Harry paused as something came to his attention. "My apologies, I realized something, continuing, all houses above Noble status, or about 1000 years old have developed family magic that if not properly handled can kill you, as such the magic of the family comes into play and will test you during this rite, if you fail this test in any way, shape, or form, you could lose your magic. Even if you pass the test you may not gain the full power of the magics of the house, even if you gain the title of lord."
"You are aware of the standings of the Ancestral Houses of Albion. You are also aware of the division of vassal when it comes to the houses are you not?" Ignatius quietly and calmly replied.
"Enough Delores, my dear boy it has been brought to our attention that you have led a student plan to skip not only classes tomorrow but all classes until the convening of the next Wizengamot session. My boy inciting such a rebellion has not helped unfortunately I have no choice but to have you and anyone who aids you in this scheme of yours expelled." Dumbledore stated smiling sadly at Harry. "But perhaps this will remind you to listen to your betters my boy."
"The betrothal was never ratified by the head of house Potter, Alexandria's signature on said document means nothing as you are well aware. Therefore, nothing in that document is applicable to house Potter." Harry interrupted rising from his seat to stand before the assembled party.
“Very well, watch him but this caveat changes nothing we will watch and wait and continue moving our people away from Britain.”
"I am loathed, to correct a teacher as they are to now better than me but as Lord Longbottom, stated on the train, and I quote If the charter had been removed then the founders magic in Hogwarts would have faded Hermione. No more hat, no points system. None of it, Hogwarts can't function without the charter in place. The castle itself would transfer back to Peverell Lands if the Hogwarts Charter was removed. So unless you are declaring the school closed until the Headmaster and board of Governors can work with and furthermore locate the heirs of Peverell, and the founders, to establish a new charter for the running of Hogwarts I do believe the Hogwarts Charter stands. Furthermore I believe the unsaid statement that it could only be repealed and a new one put into place by a sitting monarch which we have not had in over five centuries, as the last one was ratified by a sitting Monarch, the issue is moot point Heir Potter's point stands." Stated Heir Zabini.
Harry had just finished writing the last name onto his last letter of the third group, when the bell signaling the end of second period rang. He quickly grabbed his books for both Charms and Transfiguration and headed for Charms class.
“The Britain Gringotts clan was recently found to be dishonorable and half of them were put to death on Grinholts orders.” Harry answered.
“You Sirius Orion Black is at this moment accused of the murder of Peter Pettigrew and 13 muggles how do you plead?”
"It's not a loophole like you are thinking. The problem with this law is that it's to precise, not that it is not precise enough. So the original wording of the decree is "All Student Organisations, Societies, Teams, Groups, and Clubs are henceforth disbanded. An Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club is hereby defined as a regular meeting of three or more students. Permission to re-form may be sought from the High Inquisitor (Professor Umbridge). No Student Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club may exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to have formed, or to belong to, an Organisation, Society, Team, Group, or Club that has not been approved by the High Inquisitor will be expelled." (JKR OOTP Chapter 17)"
“Well, Minister, as when I arrived at 7 and was informed that the location was still as my letter prescribed in Madame Bones’s office. Where I have been seated for the past hour waiting for her arrival as seen by no less than 6 ministry Aurors. I also have the welcome desk’s security guards certificated document to prove the fact that I was told it was in Madame Bones’s Office. Therefore, I was not late; you merely started early and are required to begin again Minister.” Stated Harry emphatically.
"Very well, from all reports I've received from around Albion, very well indeed. A few unexpected surprises one of which I need to speak to you about." Sirius answers.
"I said as it stands you could not use the family magic; you don’t know-how. I did not however say that you never would. First things first, tonight is the night before your 15th birthday, tomorrow you need to go to Gringotts and ask for the Potter Account Manager. Tell him that you wish to invoke the last of line clause and take up the Potter Lordship. As you're under the age of 17, you won't be able to vote in the traditional Wizengamot, but you will be able to place a proxy there to vote for you. This will give you access to the family accounts, of which you can then request the family grimoire, ritual items and the rental of a ritual room for an hour to set up for the ritual of awakening. The ritual of Awakening will allow you to have partial access to your family magic so that I may begin teaching you. Time and other things will make it stronger. After you have performed the ritual, you will return to your account manager and ask first for a full inheritance test, a legacy test, and an abilities test. After this, and only after, are you to put the Potter headship ring on and any other heirship rings you may gain. But before any of that I need to instruct you in the proper ways to address and deal with the Goblins."
His Aunt glares at him as she says, "I have Book club this morning, and I want those chores done before it's time to cook dinner. Vernon's having guests over, and I need help cooking it."
All this information did nothing to help Harry's confusion and with so much to remember, Harry had to take some time off from his learning. Little did he know of the trouble threatening to stir, caused by a simple decision made by the family magic of a dying line. Inside Hogwarts numerous devices began to flash and make high pitch whistle, and shrieks before falling silent and still. Inside the Department of Mysteries, in the heart of the Ministry of Magic, an orb, long forgotten in the oldest section of the Hall of Prophecies, glowed again and spoke.
"It is surprising how easily you put that together Potter but enlightening none the less. Those are the reasons I am here. The teachers needed informed as this information will be in the papers this morning and will cause panic among the students."
"Well yes, of course House Emrys held around about a third of all vassals sworn to the ancestral lines which was required for a Most Ancient and Most Noble House to have for the first at least quarter century of being of that status. Somewhere usually after a house reaches that status the house magics takes a big jump in power and the aid of an ancestral house can stabilize it so that it doesn't affect the family overall magical status as bad. House Le-Fay held around half, and Evan Shade held the rest. Though Albion was considered unbalance because of this, it always seemed to work for our people's."
As the magic sorted through Harry’s magic and his memories its fury and rage grew. It found an heir strong enough to wield it without the rites being performed. But that said child was unable to as he knew nothing of said magic. He knew nothing of the history of his house, knew nothing of his houses’ power, nor its position or duty. As this heir stood now the house of Potter would fall, its responsibilities would be lost, its political and social power would be taken by others, and its history would be lost.
The kings letter was illuminating when the meat was enquired about, was informed of the stipulations behind the sale and informed of the reasons why it could not be sold to him. He had immediately launched an investigation and discovered that the British Goblins had been colluding with several wizards and had ultimately committed treason to the crown, the treasonous Goblins where being hunted down. However this left gaps in Gringotts Britian‘s upper management therefore, Ragnok’s son Griphook and several other Goblins wishing to join a new clan and have a greater opportunity for more wealth, where given permission to do so, with Griphook as the new king of the British Goblin Clan. As the gravest of these errors had been done to the House of Potter, the house was offered in recompense a few free services and the gift of an increase of a further 5% ownership of Gringotts which surprised Harry as house Potter owning any shares of Gringotts’s at all had not been on the reports he had received.
“Lord Le-Fay is many thing Narlfist, but I will not answer to Lord Le-Fay any time soon. Lord Potter, it is well to see you, I wish it was under better circumstances.” Grinholt said coming from beyond the doors of the Goblin chambers in the inner bank. “I had a meeting with Narlfist, as such I was already here and had yet to leave.”
"He did not ask to be insulted Lord Fermar, he asked you to point out the place where blood purity has any precedence in Albion law and the answer as you are well aware is nowhere, as you well know, blood purity does not matter in Albion laws. Your simple brain merely can't see that this boy has outmaneuvered you and so many others' hard work at keeping power to yourselves." Madame Delacour says as she enters from the back. "You nor the ministries can do anything to cite the house of Potter for this fund, they are merely ensuring their job of protecting the people is fulfilled to the best of their ability. The magical guardian set up has been broken for some time, seeing something broken they have endeavored to fix it.
3.	The headmaster of Hogwarts is to have no contact with these students at any time without either a direct parent, or the Potter proxy, or the Potter head of house present.
The house of Potter having had its manor attacked for several secrets the house had over a century earlier, had created a duplication charm set, so that the moment the main copy was damaged in the family manor seat, a new copy was created in the family heir library at the secondary house which had at that time been in Britain. This had meant that as the other Roman had scavenged and fought over the few remaining partial texts of Rome's magical tomes. The Potter family faded into the background making said tomes, and their very existence over the years a family secret. Over the years they had also purchased and collected many tomes that had not fared as well in the fires and had suffered the passing of time. They had restored these tomes and added them to the Potter family Library so that even though such tomes only accounted for less than a quarter of their Roman magical manuscripts they were known to have one of the largest collections of Roman magic in the world.
"Overwhelmed, our enemies have been plotting a long time and have far more experience at this than me though and Alexia says I haven't even seen the appearance of my true enemy yet." Harry answered starting to become a little frantic.
"Well over all I like it, but we've made some waves in the Wizengamot and shot down a few laws that Malfoy's section wanted passed. That's put a sort of target on our back's. This will only increase it. I would watch the paper's closely, I think that smear campaign against you Harry will start up again, but it won't be as obviously against you this time. And that's just from our ministry. Durmstrang has some students from Russia who are going to want in on this to. So, we'll have to consider the ramifications of that as well."
“Dementors! Harry get down, let us handle this” At which point Alrick and Corsair both cast patroni into the sky, after the dementors are driven away Harry and company are driven up the drive where they they were greeted at the door by Jossey the Head House Elf. “Master bes back. Master bes ready for a tour of the family home. Wes works all night and all mornings to get housey clean.”
"Ok, I assume this is more of a step towards challenging the headmaster over me, but I see how it could affect me as well. Onto full school matters, I will need a new letter for the deputy headmistress in the same vein as the last one, with Professor Umbridge's title and name along with Snape's title and name, the current one is being challenge and it would be more legally binding if it had name's and title's if I am correct."
However, though the two in front of her bear the same markings, they were dressed in a more stylish but in far less lavish apparel. Curiosity got the better of Harry, so he stayed watching the room, those who figured out who he was nodded to him respectfully but gave no other outward evidence that they knew who he was or that he was their head of house. Watching Alexandria was angering for Harry. She was cruel and spiteful it seemed to everyone in the room except her immediate family, and even then, the two youths from earlier were exceptions to the rule. Quickly accessing the family magic, he was told that they were both strong bearers, but they though old enough to carry (A bearers carrying age was 13.) Health wise they were more akin to Harry. It told Harry that the dishonor paid went much farther than skin deep. But more than that it was how she spoke of him, her nephew she had never met calling him a shame and a disgrace to the family, consorting with mudbloods and half breeds. She spoke of many things but mostly disparaging of both his parents and grandparents’ decisions, whether it be in business or the path of the House. She criticized that they had fought on the wrong side of both the war with Grindelwald and with Voldemort and how Grindelwald would have been such a better King, than the Ministries they had to deal with. This caused Harry’s anger to spike thinking of his last lesson on family history.
"I understand Pup, I'm not quite sure what I can do but I will think of something I do have a Wizengamot meeting in about an hour I can bring it up then, in the meantime is there anything else pup?"
Disclaimer: If you recognize it, it's probably not mine It all belongs to JK I'm just playing in her sandbox a little. I do read a lot of Fanfiction so if you see anything else you recognize I may have accidentally incorporated something.
Draco spoke again "I suggest you and your friends leave heir Macmillan. You are no longer welcome here." With that, the group left seeing that they were very outnumbered.
Looking to his friends and not wanting to disobey Draco summoned and elf that was then sent to inform his father and grandfather that they were needed. The two men were quick to arrive along with a few others that Lucius and Abraxas had been in a meeting with.
“I would love for you to be my dad Sirius, but James is dad and I feel like you should have your own name, not Dad, I don’t feel comfortable with that yet, but maybe something like Paddy. A mixture of both Daddy and Padfoot.” Harry tentatively answered.
"Now I am well aware you have not read chapter one however with so much to cover we cannot waste todays lesson period more than we already have, therefore turn to lesson one in your books, pull out a sheet of parchment and listen as this will be part of your homework due as usual next Monday."
“Wh wh who are you and how did you get in here, get out I say, get out.” Shouted Vernon turning to face the man, his face taking on a purple tint.
“Ugh, I do not understand for one moment how either of these two are related to me. If I didn’t know better, I would say your mothers lied about your paternal parent. You two are nothing more than a disgrace to the family. Clean this up heavens knows once I have control of this family again the first thing, I’m doing is casting the two of you out of it.” Sneered the woman. She was dressed finely, and you could quickly tell who she was and who her children and grandchildren were. They all bore distinct similarities in the hair and in the eyes. Most were dressed in finery that did not exactly fit in with their surroundings, nor fit with their own bodies.
“You young heir are impressive I now not what the test for Emrys was but you passed it quite easily. Which shall you brave through next?” Silas said.
"When the day of reckoning came Charlus Potter first fought with two of Grindelwalds lieutenants before going head to head with Grindelwald for over two hours. If Charlus hadn't taken a friendly fire spell to the back," here Mathews glared at Dumbldore, "he would have won that duel, but instead a worn and tired Grindelwald that had been hunted for over two months with no rest by Charlus Potter faced a fresh and ready Dumbledore. You Brits seem to think that Dumbledore won that battle on his own strength, but I was there, he didn't. I'm not saying he couldn't have, he just didn't then. Dumbledore took Grindelwald in and was hailed by the British as a hero, while Potter faced charges and dishonor from his own countrymen. In mainland Europe, where the long arms of Albus Dumbledore never reached, we knew what the house of Potter had done. It may not be known why or what Grindelwald was after when he attacked and killed the Potter house, but we knew what the Potter's had done, in retaliation. Charlus always seemed to have some clue, no doubt given to him, from seeing his father's last moments but we never knew for certain." A voice from the back answered.
"They shall be placed at the ICW headquarters and around the ministries. As those are the places most open to attack."
"I am Donavan Krum you all my call Professor Krum. You are all my fifth through seventh year students. Because of scheduling conflicts all of you were forced to give a usually scheduled free period for this class as such we will be having the 5th through 7th year tutoring session Tuesday through Thursday during the last period of the day. I will not be altering or changing my curriculum between your grades, I will be training you all the same, as such all of you will be able to sit your NEWT not by time May comes but by Yule break hits, for one simple reason. Can any of you guess."
The Dark Lord Voldemort sat imperiously upon a throne in the ancestral home of House Slytherin. Over the years as the house had been without a head or heir to maintain and keep the family magic active, the house-elves had slowly died off until too few remained to keep up with the manor, at which point it had begun to fall into disrepair. Though the estate had fallen into a semi-state of disrepair, the return of an heir, who had found Salazar’s loophole in claiming the family magics so was also connected to said family magics, meant it had slowly begun to return to its former glory. With his fall (as he had not claimed the magic by blood rite) it was not a full claiming but a partial one, slowly growing in power. He silently contemplated for a moment on possibly performing the bloodline Rite, as, despite its chance of death, it could also give him full rights and access to the Slytherin line, which would, in turn, allow him to formally claim the Slytherin house Lordship and resume the generation count for house Slytherin’s ascension.  He did not see where this could go wrong. It would be something to consider and to research. However in the meantime, he had other things to deal with. His spy stationed at Potter house had said that he left the sanctuary of the wards today. But no one had been able to inform him of what the boy had done in Diagon Alley because the foolish spy had arrived after the boy vanished and had left before he reappeared.  He needed to get his hands on that prophecy and the best way to do that was to get the boy to do it for him, but access was an issue.
"If you allowed me to finish." Said Minerva crossly. "I would have told you that the orders are now name specific, I received this, this morning." She handed Umbridge the letter. "Not even your new title breaks that order. Secondly as Mr. Potter was not being rude in correcting you in his address, he had every right to say what he did." Turning to Harry. "Mr. Potter do, watch your step I will be watching you; you will not be abusing the rights given in this letter. I will not hesitate to place you in detention if I catch you even a step out of bounds."
“Ok,” says Harry “will this work he says as he closes his eyes and focusses a moment on changing his hair and eye color.”
Harry turned from the kitchen towards the entryway even as Petunia set to answer the door. “I’ll get it, Aunt Petunia,” Harry offered.
Harry rose from his room and after getting dressed entered the shared living. He quickly greeted the people there and thanked both the dowager queen and the Pharaoh for their gracious hospitality, as they left Alomar stayed.
"Marcus is different, and a story all his own." Harry answered pausing by the doors to the ballroom. "My great-grandfather Charlus, had believed that each of his immediate blood brothers died without issue, during the war with Grindelwald. That wasn't true, his younger brother, Marcus, was seeing a witch at the time of his death, unbeknown to him or his siblings he had sired a son, that went to Hogwarts listed as a muggleborn, after being adopted by a muggle family. His age made him younger than my aunt, but older than my father. He graduated, several years before my father entered Hogwarts, but waited several years to settle down. He married the year the last blood war ended and sired Marcus in late 1981. He perished a month before Marcus's birth, in a murder that is still unsolved today. After his birth his muggle mother remarried a muggle, and neither treated Marcus properly." Harry explained.
"I have every right to declare blood feud just for what she did in her capacity of heiress while our houses were still aligned. Mercy stayed my hand, I suggest you reign your houses heiress in before my mercy runs short." Harry interrupted.
For the first time in 20 long years, Abraxas Malfoy had returned to England. Though most of the ICW seats belonged to individual countries, within the larger Magical Empires, as few monarchs still ruled, of the 300 seats on the ICW council 215 belonged to individual nations. A further 15 belonged to different guilds and such within magical society. That left the 32 ancestral seats, and the 10 royal seats. That left about 28 seats on the ICW that belonged to individual houses. These houses had strong international presences that required these seats 3 belonged to British families of Longbottom, Potter, and Malfoy seats.  At 25 Abraxas had dubbed Lucius well trained, and with the death of his beloved wife Melody, he left the Isles. He had gone to both focus on the International political scene, the ICW seat, but most of all to mourn his late wife without the constant memories entrapped in Malfoy Manor.
“Firstly,” states Harry, “it is Heir Potter, before any contest, I bear the ring of my house,” he holds up his right-hand fingers spread. “Secondly I do indeed have a defense. But first I have a question, for the Ministry. Where was the Patronus cast?”
“I may not like it, but no doubt will have to get used to them, I trust your judgment, and if you do well I may make you my exclusive tailor, I do however have one request, make my robes maneuverable in I don’t want robes that restrict how I move. I would also like some battle robes if you don’t mind made from Dragonhide at least the first set, if I brought you Basilisk hide could you fore that into battle robes?”
"No, not to the last one, some of these families need certain traits to inherit. I've seen both my parent's tests, I have houses on mine that weren't on theirs." Harry interjected.
"The wards of Albion pass in much the same way, however, instead of passing whatever tests the ward stone sends at you to claim them, you have to pass the tests assembled by the very magic of the land. There is a reason Arthurs grandson not his son became the second king of Albion. Ultimately it is the land that chooses its kings, and Arthurs son failed the test of the land, of Arthurs three grandsons only one past the tests of the land." Harry answered.
"Well, it could be loss of magic, which in our world is a pretty big deal, it could be the loss of a limb, it could mean that you can no longer use an entire branch of magic. A young man about fifty years back, the last muggleborn to perform the rite before the ban, attempted to claim a house whose family magic was runes, he himself was already well on his way to being, a runemaster. He partially failed the test and was unable to write in anything except runes for the rest of his life. He died in a runic explosion shortly after his son was born, while trying to write a paper on runes to finish his mastery, his son won't even touch the lords ring for fear of it happening to him. A very likely things considering when the family magic lays a punishment like that, it can pass through several generations. These generational curses are one of the biggest reasons why blood rites has been all but banned in the isles, that and the chance that if you fail to provide an heir for the lines you took blood rites for your own birth family could go extinct without an heir."
"Thank you Madam Delacour for that explanation, you look astounding as usual. I assume you have brought the WWN as well with you to explain the requirements to be a protectorate house?" Harry asked.
"Unfortunately, due to one too many incidents with previous professors that will not be possible. My orders from my head of house is that the Headmaster, the potions master, and the professor of DADA are not allowed to oversee any, detentions for those belonging to house Potter." Answered Harry.
3. All marriage, betrothal and bonding contracts regarding the new heirs of these lines, must be signed by said head of the protectorate house and the new heir.
Harry was then looking down at the paper and was a bit surprised by what he saw. Where it had once said non-heir for the house of Black it now said Heir. "Sirius it changed!" He exclaimed.
"Mr. Potter," a new voice spoke from behind them all as Madame Bones, the Minister and an entourage of various other Lords and Ladies followed. "You have no right…"
"Enough we can discuss this at a later time I assume you all came to help out, then let me give you your assignments, Viktor, Harry's group has finished the Northernmost wing and started on the easternmost wing you join his group when they return for another body dump as to the rest of you…" Smith gave out assignments to each one who had come with Marvolo and Dumbledore, even those that had come to merely gawk and see, such as the minister and Umbridge.
“Very well, let us begin after all time is money. We at Gringotts have finished both the traditional accounting is done after the transfer of headship, and the items returned by the call have been sorted and accounted for, which would you like to cover first?”
If the Basilisk is larger than expectations these numbers may need to be reevaluated. However, we would like to confirm the first auction to be on Wednesday, August 9th.
Thursday morning Harry and Neville returned to school at the same time the papers did, walking into the great hall, and having the school go silent around you, Harry decided, was rather unnerving. Sitting down next to Hermione, Ron and the other Gryffindor of his year he asked. "Days Greetings all, so how bad is the article?"
Albus Dumbledore sat in the headmaster's office seething as the other professors gathered around. He knew that with the new professors added he would not have his regular control of the school. As lords, they knew the Hogwarts bylaws, and much liked tonight would not be afraid to call him out when he overstepped his bounds. With Harry's new independence that would be troublesome. he would have to adjust his plans, his manipulations of the boy would have to come from other people. But who from that would be the question. The ministry being against him would only help him.
“Do you all remember what I said when I gave Lord Le-Fay the first test of the heirships?” Harry asked.
Harry spent most of Monday reading, going over the Potter finances and dealing with the basilisk eggs.
"Thank you, for illuminating that little bit, Heir Potter. Heir Malfoy, you may continue." The professor said.
Secondly was that although internationally Potter Industries had not taken a hit at all, after the unveiling of the return of the Ancestral house of Le-Fay, the same could not be said here in the Isles, as Lord Le-Fay seemed to be holding its outside Isles properties at the same level they had been for the past few generations. In the Isle's it seemed the house of Le-Fay wished to claim as many businesses of House Potter as they could, by either running them out of business or by forcing House Potter to hand them over. In that Harry and Sirius were both being run ragged putting out fires both politically, and economically, for the businesses both owned and associated with House Potter.
"From the West we call the element of Earth will you please now join us?" with that he set the bowl in the western section of the circle, and placed the candle that had been sitting there in the bowl before then lighting it. The two then turn away from each other and knelt back to back and Neville placing his last bowl he had on the floor in front of him, placing a white candle inside it and lighting the candle then spoke
Taking a second to pause Harry continued. "I called you for that first test as decided by both I and Lord Longbottom. Instead of coming to see me as asked, which considering your position and my responsibilities as head of the black knights and recent events you should have, if you are seriously considering becoming king of Albion. This test would then have been done in privately and the results registered with the magics of Albion, as you however instead chose to insult and belittle me, instead the test will take place here in front of everyone and your results and the reasons for said results will be public."
“I fail to see him as a threat, he will fall in line like the rest when I rise to Kingship, you I can see will not, this will be a right and proper lesson for you of what will happen should your line continue to subvert mine.” Marvolo answered.
“I can say that Britain has much of that mentality as well. The Wizengamot has become more a place to embarrass and twist the laws to your advantage than to protect the people.” Neville answered, though he was reluctant to do so, even after this short of time, he could see the chemistry between the two. A server brought both Harry and Neville the morning meal as Alomar explained to them much of the current climate in the court.
“So, Harry what’s the story, the rest of it, you started explaining something before whoever that was interrupted and shut you down. What’s the story, and how does it tie into why Grindelwald went after the Potters?” Sirius asked. The other students looked at him. “Were any of you either listening to the Wizengamot meeting or have a clue about what was said. At the shake of their heads Sirius, and Neville recap what all had been said.
"To this day it is unclear why Grindelwald acted as he did, why he attacked. It wasn't unusual for Grindelwald to go after families, to go after houses but this, but what he did that day, it was different. At the time I was a senior auror, we were called in after the deed was done. At that point I had considered myself a seasoned Auror, but upon apparating in even I was sick. It was called the Potter massacre for a reason. Of the over a thousand people who had been there none survived. House Potter was left only to those that had left for the rite. Henry Potter, Charlus's father and the then Lord Potter very obviously was killed last and it showed. But he wasn't the only one who had been tortured, all those that had been at the picnic, had been brutally slaughtered from the youngest to the oldest."
“Thank you King Grinholt a word in private please, it is not that I do not trust my companions, but this is not personal business.” Grinholt nodded and despite Alomar’s and Neville’s request to wait a moment Harry followed Grinholt and Narlfist to a private room. Upon entering Harry turned and pulling a blade as in a voice colder than ice: “My aides and Sirius Black all gave Gringotts messages to pass onto me that were never passed on. Messages that where passed straight to Griphook, now I find it hard to believe that considering you and Griphook fully know my full inheritance and titles if I go through a full blood Rites ritual not a partial a full blood rite what I can claim. I find it difficult to believe that you would not be able to see treason in your own son yet you placed him in direct contact with me, furthermore you put him in charge of the search for other traitors.” Harry took a deep breath before continuing.
“I assume as the godson of the current lord black you know how to contact the head of house Black?” asked Lord Percival.
"I am well aware of that McGonagall however, I am no longer simply the Defense Professor, I am now the High Inquisitor as such I am allowed to place Mr. Potter in detention with me."
AN: Sorry it's been a while, my muse has been difficult, to say the least. Jumping through half a dozen new plots, and refusing to let me focus on this fic. Reading through some of your comments however has caused my muse to sit up and take notice of this story again. perhaps it will let me finish it now that I've gotten at least a chapter written on the other ideas, though I have no idea if they will ever actually get published. Here is chapter 23, I'll try to get chapter 24 out before the middle of September but I'm moving into a new apartment as well so it may not be posted until the end of September. As always Read, and Review.
"Detention Mr. Potter, my office 9 o'clock, and I do not care what the Hogwarts charter says I will not be allowing and silly wand waving in this classroom. All you need to know of defense is the theory behind the spells not the spell itself." Responded Professor Umbridge.
"You can't do that, that would mean skipping her classes. It doesn't matter if you take extra tutoring lessons you are still required to attend the classes taught by the professors." Hermione snapped back her anger getting the better of her.
"We have however gotten away from the point" said Filius "the charter is still enacted then. I fear after tonight if we do not brush up on the details of the charter, we will find ourselves under scrutiny from the student as to our rulings and guidelines. May I suggest you all brush up on what it says."
In the case of any inheriting a seat on the Wizengamot High, middle, or low, they are to be given into the hands and training of a Protectorate house. See Page 5 for the list of requirements to become one. The protectorate house ware then charged with training said heir to fully meet the standards set by Albion law. Or for ten years which ever is the shorter time. In exchange for this training and protection the protectorate houses will hold the proxy for their Wizengamot seat for that time and enable's them to form sign and enforce, betrothal contracts.
"Understood Professor," Harry answered. He glanced up at Umbridge's face and mentally decided to get tutors for both defense and Potions next time he spoke with Sirius.
“Now you see here boy you can’t just go running off whenever you like the old man said…” Vernon spluttered.
"Charlus Potter left the ritual room at Potter manor, where he had just finished the rite that they had been away for and walked into the next room only to have the head of house ring appear on his hand. It's called a violent transfer for a reason, it knocked him out for two hours, while it showed him the last hours of the previous head, as is customary when the ring goes immediately from one head to the next in such a violent manner. When he arrived at the scene, my men had been there for three hours, and Charlus Potter was infuriated. His five siblings, and parents had all been in that field, and now at 45 he was now beyond his wife, and son the last of the main Potter branch. Of the previously over a thousand strong Potter family, only about twenty remained after that day." Mathews stated his eyes gaining a far of look.
“So, what you are saying is that Dumbledore has been stealing from me and giving my money to other people,” stated Harry both surprised and fighting with himself to control his anger at the news.
After a minimum of 12 physical hours of blade training a week, Harry was starting to see the truth in this as he was rapidly improving beyond even Draco's level, who had a had a professional tutor every summer since he was 8. Despite that Draco still loved to spar with him, which was starting to confuse Harry. Draco had once acted as if he hated getting bested by people in anything. Now he seemed to take it as a personal challenge to get better. When Harry asked about it, he only answered: "Before I had my dad looking over my shoulder on everything, I had to be the best or I was punished for not being the best. Now I don't have him looking over my shoulder all the time I can let someone else be my equal without it being a bad thing or being punished for it."
Harry closed his eyes to count to ten preparing to have this argument with the headmaster, when Sirius spoke up before he could. "Albus I am completely amazed that you managed to hold onto your position as head of the Wizengamot considering you seem bound and determined that the rights and honors of the elder titled houses do not exist. I wonder if you are merely going senile or simply being obtuse."
"Good Morning everyone I understand that this is a bit early for all of us it is only now going on 7:30 AM however Sirius called and said he had important news and that Alexander needed too speak to me of a few matters. I'm sure Griphook has financials to update me up on among other things. I figured as Neville is our main ally in the Wizengamot to allow him to sit and if anything else he can give me the view from the magical raised. Sirius you first."
“What would a Malfoy have to do with house Potter, you have been enemies for decades.” Marvolo asked, not quite understanding the silent fear he saw in the eyes of Abraxas Malfoy, and Mikhail Zabini.
"It's a fact that he has to live with, he's the one that called the rights of ascendancy to be in play. Besides our tests are only to prep him for the last test." Neville answers.
"I am I feel he will not be pleased with my information, but it is something he needs to be made aware of." Answered the younger man.
“Well, there is an opening, but the cost difference of doing the rite at the Memphis branch will not be refunded.” Draco nodded at that. He had figured as much it cost generally about twice as much to have this rite done here in Rome rather than at most of the other branches.
"Good to see you again Viktor, sad to hear about the quidditch thing but if it's not your dream it's not your dream." Harry responded. "What brings you to England, I mean aiding my allies and I in learning adequate defense skills is admirable but hardly warrants the attentions of the heir of one of the strongest Bulgarian Albion houses."
“My name is Raphael Aaron’s, and this is my wife Lacey, and our children Cadmus 19, Ciara 17, and Antonio 15. My Brother Joseph and his wife, unfortunately, has also passed, their 3 children, Jovani 17, Silver 15, who is also a bearer, and Mason 13. My Sister Alicia, and her husband River, and their two children Sierra 19, and Joel 16.”
Draco and his Godfather entered the shop of one Serenity Collins. They were told to wait in the seats by the receptionist at the desk. A few moments after Serenity showed her last customers out and asked what they were here for.
Harry and Neville shared a glance before Neville answered, “I believe that would be lovely, any specific attire needed?”
"Now Mr. Potter this crime scene falls under my jurisdiction, you can't just…" Smith trailed off as he looked down into Harrys eyes. Normally Harry's eyes were green, when he was angry, they sort of glowed showing off his own power. Smith looked into eyes that didn't sort of glow, they shone with power, they shone with the might of house Potter, but in their depths shone another power, one that Smith felt was judging him, judging him and finding him wanting for something. These eyes reminded him of the stories he had been told of the war with Grindelwald, more specifically the fire that had shined in Charlus Potters eyes as he had hunted Grindelwald, and those who knew the full story, had no doubt that it had become a hunt. Those eyes those reminded him that the Potter house had the sole power and right to tap into the wards of Albion and wield the Power of house Pendragon, if only for brief moments, when acting in the line of their duty. Smith, stood down, "My apologies my Lord please continue."
"Hermione was very interested in the celebrations to take place tonight, and as you weren't at school you missed a chance to see Dumbledore spitting mad. Professor Malfoy is hosting a Samhain celebration on the Hogwarts grounds and any and all students are invited. When he announced it at lunch Dumbledore's masks fell, his anger was felt throughout the hall. The ICW investigators still at the school also reprimanded him for it, saying it wasn't very respectable for him to lose his temper like that."
Voldemort sat thinking over the words his right hand had spoken of. "You have to remember that prophecy only has power when people believe in them, most predictions are self-fulfilling without any input from us as individuals." Had he given the prophecy power by believing in it? Could Potter not be the threat he believed he was?
“They are just some common bloods we chose to bring along, an obvious mistake.” Said Selena Ivanoff with a glare to the direction of the two of them. “I promise they will be appropriately punished for this, my lord.”
As such the entirety of the upper year Gryffindors heard Harry's tirade at 8:30 when the Daily Prophet was delivered. The paper had an entire 2 page article belittling Sirius's sanity and his "foolish belief in lies sprouted by liars". The paper went as far as to call Sirius insane for calling both Dumbledore and the Ministry out for "mistreatment" of students and not following an "archaic and outdated charter".
"I am neither your boy nor have I given you leave to use my personal name Headmaster, what is it you that you wished to discuss?" interrupted Harry.
This sudden reintroduction of battle to the field had been the key that Grindelwald needed, it had broken the ranks of that he and his classmates had created to defend the castle. Looking around as he ducked, weaved, dodged and returned spell fire Harry was beginning to lose hope, even Marvolo's marked were being pushed back. With every minute that passed the defenders were being pushed back towards the castle, without the wards Harry could see little chance of victory. Harry looked to his right and immediately broke into a run seeing Neville pinned by two older lieutenants of Grindelwald's army that had fought in the Grindelwald war. Pushing Neville out of the way, he barely missed being hit by the spell that had been sent at Neville himself.
“Wonderful, well I will see you all on the 10th.” She said as she escorted them back into the waiting room. With that, they exited the Alley and apparated back to the manor.
AN: My apologies for the late update, I just got internet at my house. 1st thing this chapter shows our first jump and contains the train ride to Hogwarts. I will not be writing this fic as a daily day by day fic. Including all the little details of all that would frankly take up too much space in a fic that as I just finished Chapter 20 last week is sitting at almost 100,000 words. This means that some things are just going to happen off-screen, like Harry's continued lessons with his guardians, classes, meetings with Sirius, and such things.
"No, actually he's not, being too serious actually. As heirs there are certain specific things that we are taught from a young age, decorum, politics, manners, and such things. By time we reach Hogwarts depending on you status in the world, other things are added to the mix, things like law and governance. One of the very first things I was taught about making laws, was to be precise in what you wanted, but not to precise as to leave loopholes for someone else to attack." The seventh year Slytherin answered.
“As a bearer depending on the locations and identities of your runes and the number of your Lily’s you may require more than one Consort Lord, or in terms you may better understand, you may be required to take multiple husbands, to stabilize your magic. I’m not saying you must, just that you might be forced to consider it. A bearer’s magic is just as strong as any other witch or wizard but their core’s magic is denser. We hold more magic because we pack more into a smaller space. Bearer’s also carry multiple children far easier and have them more often. We also store the magical essence of those we share ourselves with inside us. This allows our magic to give us heirs to our husbands lines, even if the father has long passed, or after he has left us, this ability enable’s us in many ways call them back to us.”
“Well it does seem that the Potter family has been blessed, my name is Aliya Mercier nee Sirencee, this is my husband Marc, my three children Lucas 16, Adrian 14, and Jean-Marc who is 12 and a bearer.  Next, to me, we have my brother Alexei, and his wife Anabella, and his 5 children Catherine 13, Maria 12, Serenity 11, Marc 11, and Alexander 9. We then have my two cousins Marcus who married Andrea, and now has 1 boy Carlos 3, and Claude, who married Almería and have a little boy 2.” Aliya pointed to each child and adult as she introduced them. Harry smiled and began to relax as the other to smile. He had proven himself capable, now it was time to honor him.
He is brought from his musing by his fireplace going off with request for someone to floo in. His mind lost in thought as he mindlessly approved the request. There was no doubt that those two dragons that Alistair had spoken of had finally opened an eye, they weren't awake yet but would be all too soon. No, he wouldn't move against them, not yet, let the ministry and Wizengamot allow them to sharpen their claws, it would allow him, to tame their fire when the time came. Dumbledore was drawn from his thoughts as his floo once more went off and the ICW head of Investigations stepped out requesting the presence of several teachers as well as students. The severity and grief on his face had Dumbledore immediately complying. Dumbledore quickly sent massages to the students knowing that the mood Mr. Smith was in would see him in hot water if he obstructed the man's work in any way. As the men waited for the others to arrive, Dumbledore patiently waited hoping this would not be a repeat of what had happened on Monday. Albus shivered slightly remembering the pandemonium that had brought. That had been a nightmare of Epic portions that had reverberated throughout the week, in both the school, and the social and political fields. When the door open and in walked, Neville Longbottom. Draco Malfoy, Abraxas Malfoy, Lord Le-Fay who was staying at the school, Lucius Malfoy, several other teachers, and Harry Potter, Dumbledore only marginally relax understanding the tensions in the room.
Grindelwald looked around at his gathered men with a smile. "Lord Le-Fay is a fool and has handed me my long desired victory at long last. With his return all I need do is wait for him to open the wards of Le-Fay Castle, or for the location of the old Potter Family seat in Italy to be revealed and I will have the last required key I need to open the twelfth seal and finally have enough power to claim the throne of Albion myself. Celebrate and spread the news my faithful, for in a week I shall leave this place, and leave nothing but ice, rubble and blood in my wake. But before we begin Alexandria Ivanoff, what is the boon you wish of me for the information you have brought me."
"In the wizarding world a house or the family that you are born to, is critical. As a culture the wizarding world, treasures our past, as we treasure the actions and responsibilities of our forefathers. In wizarding society, we show this by giving respect to those that paved the way for us to be what we are today, we give them honor in many ways. The titles a house holds, can be reflected in how old they are, and how strong monetarily.”
"Well, yes, but the price that he asked was steep, and furthermore almost impossible for me to do at this time. Urgg, I was hardly raised to deal with politics, let alone politics with the Ancestral houses."
Alrick answered. “Yes, well we would like to speak with Madame Andromeda Tonks, with a matter of her picking up a case and possibly becoming the head law wizard for a family.”
That prompted Harry to think about other surprises that had occurred throughout the last 3 weeks. After the trial it had been revealed that Harry was indeed staying at Potter Manor. This had brought him to have several different visitors, from Madame Bones Regent of house Bones on his behavior towards Susan, to other members of the Wizengamot wanting him to support their bill. Letters had also become an issue as Dumbledore saw now to off center Harry and remove the mail redirect ward on him. This had prompted Harry to receive a couple thousand letters, all at the same time. The elves and the guard were still working together to sort through them, isolating the malicious ones, and preserving the nicer ones. This had prompted him to also publish several apologies in the newspaper for not answering to mail, after a slandering reply calling him a liar over it, Law Wizard Tonks had stepped in and shared the memories of Harry receiving his first wizarding letter, and being undulated with letters a few days before. The prophet had printed parts of these memories, only to escape full out lawsuit.
"High Inquisitor unfortunately neither the detentions nor the points will stand. As to the detentions all students under the banner of house Potter are forbidden from having detention with you, Professor Snape, or Professor Dumbledore…"
"Well, not a whole lot actually, the article didn't get any space until page 4. No, that article was rather tastefully and artfully done, I think the article you are looking for doesn't actually have your name in it at all."
For Harry the next two days passed much quicker. With Mimsy there all his inside chores were done by her, and she made sure he ate and was fed as well. As Aunt Petunia was out most mornings, he was able to pretend that he was working on inside chores all morning, while actually being in his room going over all that he had learned the night before, or completing his homework, of which at this point he had more than half done. He had learned a lot in the past two nights including that for advance study of the Potter family defense magics he was going to have to find a place to practice away from everyone else.
"The second and third do not come into play for me as my parents are dead. The fourth is the rights I had to do alone and unaided as again my parents are dead, and unlike Susan I have no immediate family close enough remaining alive to simply turn to, to aid me in performing those rituals."
Disclaimer: If you recognize it, it's probably not mine It all belongs to JK I'm just playing in her sandbox a little. I do read a lot of Fanfiction so if you see anything else you recognize I may have accidentally incorporated something.
Suddenly from behind Harry towards the doors, he had entered in a voice said. “Albus Dumbledore, Witness for the defense.”
"How much would the damage be Lucius." Abraxas calmly asked his son, waving on his to teaching assistants to begin his waiting class.
As he finished dressing, he added proper bearers’ attire onto his list of things to do today, but he suspected that that job would require a trip to High street as Madam Malkin’s would hardly carry such materials. Nor would she be able to craft robes fitting his station her shop just didn’t have the proper materials. Thinking of his now longer hair as well, a trip to High street would be necessary for more than one thing.
I Nefertiti Ramses do hereby cordially invite you Haldris Potter and a single guest to celebrate the solstice with I and my family.
“No headmaster, the Dark Lord has not changed his plans. He still intends to go after the item hidden in the department of mysteries before doing much else. There have been discussions made that he may break out of Azkaban.” Answered Severus Snape.
“What did some other royalty invite you to spend Solstice and yule, with them? Seriously saying no to a Malfoy invite will not help you politically Harry.” Daphne scolded.
“Well, we are hosting the annual Malfoy Winter Solstice Ball at the manor, and I have a few trips to Diagon Alley planned as well as a possible trip to Rome planned, but nothing to specific. What about you Daphne?” Draco answered.
“Understand what yet father?” Alomar asked from behind them as he approached. Harry turned to greet Alomar before the heir ring on his hand shifted with a flash of light freezing most in the room behind them. As Harry reached down to the Black ring he stiffened before screaming in agony as he passed out, captured by the memories of his godfather’s ring.
For you see the fourteen-year-old wizard that lay fast asleep in the spare bedroom of Number 4 was not normal. Even among wizards he wasn’t normal, the many adventures that took place each school year were testament of that. The boy who slept in this mundane home had over the past four years, met many new people and learned a bit about his place in the Magical world. Tonight, though that would change. Tonight Harry turned fifteen, and unknown to him this birthday was a signal of change. For tonight something would change, something that had nothing to do with his parents' death, nor the scar that had spawned the title boy-who-lived. For unknown to Harry, as the magic of his mother's sacrifice that night had wrought a change, magic of a sort connected to his father would mark this change.
Harry read through the letter once and then read it through again. The crown prince of Egypt had only been crowned recently; it had caused great controversy as he was not the oldest of his father's almost forty children from almost a dozen consorts. Alomar had been one of the youngest of the king's children, but he had proven himself well, outmaneuvering his siblings to gain the favor of the people if not the court. His father saw this and when the time came to choose an heir, he was chosen much to the dismay of the other heirs and of the court who had thrown their support behind other older princes. Harry supposed it would not be bad to have further allies in the greater international world. Picking up the envelope the letter had come in Harry paused, the envelope was heavier than expected. Lifting it Harry, emptied the envelope finding the two portkey emblems that the letter had spoken of, but also came another few pieces of parchment. Opening the parchments, he found another letter.
“In October 1991 there were 1500 galleons withdrawn by Albus Dumbledore. They were also deposited into separate accounts 700 Galleons were deposited in Albus Dumbledore’s personal vault, 200 into the personal vault of Severus Snape, 200 into the personal vault of Molly Weasley, 200 into the personal vault of Ronald Weasley, and 200 galleons into the personal vault of Hermione Granger. This continued until August of 1992 when you withdrew 150 galleons, and there was a 1,350 galleon withdraw by Albus Dumbledore. They were also deposited into separate accounts 300 Galleons were deposited in Albus Dumbledore’s personal vault, 200 into the personal vault of Severus Snape, 250 into the personal vault of Molly Weasley, 200 into the personal vault of Ronald Weasley, and 200 galleons into the personal vault of Hermione Granger. In September of 1992, there were 1500 galleons withdrawn by Albus Dumbledore. They were also deposited into separate accounts 500 Galleons were deposited in Albus Dumbledore’s personal vault, 200 into the personal vault of Severus Snape, 200 into the personal vault of Molly Weasley, 200 into the personal vault of Ronald Weasley, 200 galleons into the personal vault of Hermione Granger and 200 into the vault of Ginevra Weasley. The last has been repeated monthly until now. Every Month but August in 1993 you withdrew 250, Dumbledore withdrew 1250 and deposited 200 into his own account and 250 into Molly Weasley’s. In 1994 you withdrew 150, Dumbledore withdrew 1350 and deposited 250 into his own account and 300 into Molly Weasley’s
"Grindelwald said that if Harry used the full magics of house Potter against him, he wouldn't be alive, what was he talking about?" Marvolo questioned.
“Enough!” Said Harry as the magic in the room grew oppressive and cold, he paused allowing a chance for others to speak. “Lord Abbot, Madame Bones all alliance’s between our houses are at this moment broken, all contracts are null and void. Your heirs have attacked the heir of another and you have spoken nothing of censure, I will not align myself with houses with no honor. As for your allegations, I suggest for once you take a good long look at the Hogwarts rumor mill Ladies. Your lives weren’t in danger third year as Sirius was after a rat not you, and I did not enter the tournament last year. Bartimaeus Crouch Jr. did as he confessed to doing so before he was kissed by order of the minister. Odd considering I thought that order could only be given with the permission of the Wizengamot.”
“So, to was Charlus Potter but one man. It is not his age my dear daughter in law but his status. If he is expelled this morning, the Wizengamot will have told every lesser noble and commoner that the power of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Houses is gone. That the family magic in our veins does not matter. In time Harry James Potter will grow up and if he is made aware of his station before Morvolo gets to him, even if he is expelled today he will return, and he will destroy the ministry for what they have done. Lucius and the others may have forgotten, but I have not, in time that boy will have the power to temporarily control the wards of Albion.” Abraxas said stress evident in his eyes.
“Not know but you may be able to in time.” Alomar answered. Harry sat as the air went out of him. Neville just stared at Alomar. Who continued, “I understand that it may not be as well known overseas, but I at least thought it was understood that Dementors are not natural creatures, they are servants of death.”
"You would, technically they should not be challenging it but I fully understand that the ministry is not fully following there own laws only the laws of Albion specifically spelled out I am still working with Alexander in going over all laws put in place since the last king but it's been almost half a millennium so that's quite a few laws and bills to go through. It's a work in progress it will be several months before we have full reports for you. I'll let Sirius continue and speak of this more later." Answered Andy.
1.	If any of these students are sorted into Slytherin, they have the right to request a resort at any time.
“Yes, they have, and have been stored in the appropriate rooms within the Potter family vaults.” Answered Sharptooth. “Excluding, of course, goblin-made items.”
"A courtship is not final, it is more of a time of testing, to see if the two of you are compatible, he learns of your house, you learn of his. Usually a courtship comes before the betrothal, it's sort of like dating but more heavily monitored and more publicly announced. Though it usually also comes with a period of magnanimity or exclusiveness as you are a bearer that would not be expected of you." Sirius answers Harry unsaid question.
“I just don’t get it. Harry sacrificed so much to protect their children and they are still attacking him. With them not able to actually attack him, they are attacking those under his protection. I had no idea about the bearer law but trying to bind Arsenio, Artemis, and the others, to men that they aren’t choosing and trying to bind Harry to someone as well. It’s insane, Sirius.” She ranted angrily.
“Ok, my grandfather Fleamont died early in the war, why was the garrison's not used against the dark lord? Harry asked angrily.
“It was cast about a block from Number 4 Privet drive as you very well know Mr. Potter.” Glared the Minister.
"Not exactly but close, I am called a guardian, and I will not be the only one you have. I will teach you, as will others, in your dreams but we will also watch you in your waking life and expect you to honor your family's legacy by putting our teachings to good use. We can give advice, as we can also guide you in other things." James responds.
Harry follows the goblin through a doorway to the right, and through a few twists and turns afterward. He doesn't bother trying to memorize it, knowing that a Goblin will have to guide him every time he wishes to meet with his Account Manager. As they come to the office, he sees a gold sign hanging on the door. Sharptooth – Account Manager – Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter. The floor spins beneath him as he steps inside and makes an attempt to steel himself, knowing his next steps can either honor his line or dishonor it.
“There is no trial record for one Sirius Orion Black. I have here an order of transfer for the accused to be placed in Azkaban, and the documents for a kiss on sight order. I have no trial transcript.”
The man across from him on the left spoke, "Well as to the change I can't say, but he is the reason behind the shakeup behind the Goblins here lately. I had Britian Gringotts completely under my thumb and now I'm back down to scratch because the fools challenged Potter on something, and he pulled an ace out that revealed their duplicity to the High King. They are now being hunted by the other clans. I am however pleased that I did manage to get a few plants into the new clan. One particularly high up that gave me some information I would like to share with you privately my lord." At Grindelwald's nod the reports continued once more.
“As such, head of house Potter, I at this moment remove from your care and reprimand into my care, your children Artemis and Arsenio Ivanoff from henceforth they shall be Potters as head of house, so I have spoken so mote it be. Furthermore, I find you Alexi, Sofia, and Adrian unfit parents and remove your remaining children from your care. As I do not see that they have been adequately trained in what it means to be a Potter, I do not take them into my house.”
Sirius pulled his copy from the secure mail box "Well, I assume as you had the test done before I was officially able to claim the black headship mine would have said heir so, you couldn't be classified as heir when you first did the test. Part of the reason this test is so expensive is that the parchment self-updates, as time moves forward. They all do." Sirius looked from Harrys face back down to read the documents Harry had sent him. "Harry you don't have the call for several reasons. firstly your blood locked heir of an Albion Ancestral house, they don't carry the binding oaths of magic to the royal houses, they aren't sworn to the crown, even if they had sworn the oaths to the house before they were ancestral, it's part of the magic of the title. Secondly it may be blood locked, but you still have the pendragon inheritance." Sirius looked up studying Harry's face, it was slightly stony, more determined. "You don't want it, I get that; trust me I do. It's going to be a mess if you claimed it as you then have to deal with all the different messes spread out between all ministries of Albion. I get it pup, however don't let this out you will be swarmed and there will be those that will crucify you both because you were chosen for the title and because you don't want it."
"I am not your boy Dumbledore, and you would not have served as head of the Wizengamot for over a decade and a half if you did not know the basic laws prescribing the rights and privileges of the upper nobility and their vassals especially when it comes to the heirs."
"Moving on pup, the minister has come up with a new educational decree number 24 that makes her High Inquisitor over Hogwarts; it basically gives her the power to review all the teachers already there, make any curriculum changes she wants and all that fun things. It is the ministry's newest version of trying to mimic the kings Master's of education council head, which was voted on by the educators of the time."
Now to your last question, a Horcrux is one of the vilest pieces of magic known to man. It is the only piece of Black Magic a human can cast without a bloodline gift. It is magic that through murder, rips the soul apart and anchors a person to the mortal plane. The day he came after you, the Dark Lord must have accidentally made you a soul container for his Horcrux which the Rite of Awakening purged as the family magic would not allow a thing like that to touch them. While in you it was draining your magic and as such, blocked specific gifts of yours.” Sharptooth questioned.
"Not as well as the testing, but well none the less. It is very interesting how many people overlooked, the requirement of being a fully upstanding citizen, and clear by right of veritiserum of all high crimes, such as being an accused follower of a dark lord/lady. It seems people saw the word Voldemort instead of the word dark lord/lady and thought that Grindelwald and the one or two others we've had didn't count."
The Minister blubbered incomprehensively for a moment. “Very well Harry James Potter you are hereby charged with the breaking of the underage use law, along with breaking the statute of Secrecy.”
"I'm sorry why is that so important, and who was that at the ministry Harry? He seemed to scare you, that's why I almost went for my wand."
"Hermione it's ok I completely understand as a muggleborn there are a few things that even our professors are restricted form telling you due to the Wizengamot's current laws, as your protectorate guardian however the Wizengamots laws don't affect my guardianship, only Albion's law does. As such I am cordially inviting you to a gathering in the bearers' dorms tonight for all those under my protectorate guardianship."
Late last Wednesday the DMLE was informed of alarms going off high and low at Azkaban Prison. The once thought to be impenetrable fortress suffered a massive breakout last night that saw 10 Aurors dead and another 10 suffering in the critical spell damage ward, at St. Mungo's hospital. Of the almost  three thousand and five hundred prisoners in Azkaban serving various sentences. Over half of them have been officially declared kissed as of this morning. See page 59 for list of the dead. Others remain at large, such as Rodulphus, and his wife Bellatrix and his brother Rebastan Lestrange remain at large. See an updating list of those that are still at large on page 72. Among the guards of Azkaban, the dementors where missing from their posts and the ministry has advised that you call the Auror's office immediately if you see either the escaped convicts or feel a sudden flash chill as that is the chief signal dementors approaching.
Harry belatedly realized that her and many of the other teachers of the school had never done anything to reign in the students through action or deed. He watched many of the transfer students throughout the rest of the school and realized that many of them openly glared at the teachers throughout the day as the teachers were even less helpful to them, then they had been to Harry. Harry made up his mind to once more contact Sirius, they had a few things to discuss. During lunch Harry slipped away to an abandon classroom to call Sirius. He informed him of exactly what had happened over the last week.
Harry woke the next morning and pulling on some traditional Egyptian morning robes slipped out to the upper balcony attached to the bedroom that had been chosen for him. From the balcony he took in the view of both the city and the surrounding countryside. Hearing Neville calling his name he walked back out through the bedroom to their shared living room area.
"As I told Miss Granger, Mr. Potter Dumbledore is in meetings and cannot be interrupted." McGonagall answered my question.
“Harry, there are other issues to that though to. A guilty sentence of treason can only be pardoned by five ancestral houses or the royal family of the kingdom in which the sentence was cast. Even if it was proven wrong, at the very least he would be forced to spend the remainder of his days in Azkaban serving out his sentence.” Neville reminded everyone in the room. “And besides even if you could find five Ancestral houses it would only stay the sentence for five years without a Royals intervention.” Harry heard Neville’s words and stopped for a moment to settle his racing mind, as Neville continued. “Besides for blood-rites it would be safest to seek out the Goblins and it’s unknown at this time if they can be trusted.”
Thank you for replying to my letter, I know that the past few days have been trying. You need not fear your visit here, my son is aware of house Potters new ranking, but I have already informed him as to the House of Potters continued allegiance to Albion. He was most disappointed but made the promise that I requested that he not try to persuade you to Egypt, it would not work and would later cause irreparable damage to a house he will need in the future.
"Then take what was said with a grain of salt and forget it." Interjected Narcissa, as she, Lucius and the dark lord finished their breakfasts and started to leave the table. "Your grandfather will be taking you to the station your father, and I have duties we must attend to."
"Not what the law means, no it is the laws literal translation, which is just as valid, and would be used by at least one teacher that I know of at this school. The fact of the matter is that I regularly gather with Pansy and Blaise, Grandfather. I have taken to regularly attending the tutoring session I have with house Potter and its allies. I regularly have a Saturday evening Business meeting with Theodore Nott, Heir Potter, and about a dozen other elder heirs so that we can all learn some better business acumen from each other. I won't support a decree that goes against everything you and father have taught me since birth. You were the one who said I needed to start listening and paying attention to what others are saying about me as the heir of house Malfoy, what does this say about house Malfoy when half the groups he participates in are denied reformation such as the business club for the mere point that Harry Potter heir to the House of Potter's name is also on the roster. It shows that we the elder houses in Britannia have finally allowed and permitted something to come between our ranks to the point that you would allow a bill to pass that endangers our own heirs. Right now, I am ashamed to call myself a Malfoy."
"You understand that as a bearer, I am expected to have more than one consort?" Harry asked, at Viktor's nod Harry continues. "I Haldris James Potter due hereby accept your request of courtship. May our houses learn much of each other." Harry then pulling up his sleeve extends his arm to a now kneeling Viktor who takes the armband from Harry and places it on his upper arm. Gently pulling his sleeve back down Harry blushes as a camera goes off.
“Transfiguration, Charms, Potions, usually those are the skills that go hand in hand with the defense family gift, Runes, and Arithmancy usually are the tools of the masters of Battle Magic. I see by your face I have stumbled onto something, it does not surprise me, I was already aware of the original Potter family gift being that of Battle Magics, no the surprising thing is that even though the gift has shifted the family has retained its ability with runes and arithmancy.” Alomar paused as the curse breaker Harry had been talking to ran to another one and they both came back over and began discussing things with Harry.
“I cannot say I am surprised; Runes are almost an additional gift for your family, come this place is going to get busy and we will wish to be inside during the heat of midday.” Alomar said before leading them back to the palace. From there the three splits up as Alomar had princely duties to take care of and Neville and Harry had duties to attend to as well. The rest of the day passed quickly for Harry and Neville and it was with knowledge of the daylong celebration the next day of Alomar’s ascension to Prince that they retired early.
Since the group consisting of eight people could not gather in the school to complete their homework, they headed outside and sat in three groups, near each other but still within hearing distance so they could do the project.
“A pleasure to meet you as well, Prince Alomar, I am…” Harry was interrupted before he could finish his introductions by a young lady from another table.
Inside Neville’s mind something drew to him as his dreams changed he found himself standing in a room, it was circular and covered in vines. Behind him, he heard a voice “Hello, young Neville.”
"Have any of you actually seen any of my grades from the first part of the second semester of first year. For that one semester I was ranked fifth for the entirety of the first years. Transfiguration in particular I was ranked as twelfth overall for highest transfiguration grades in all seven years. At the end of the second semester I had dropped to a solid A grade point average and had dropped to below the middle of my class range listings do any of you know why?"
“But you are here at the call of all high ranking noble houses, and as mine was Ancient before yours was, I can say that I outrank you and most other nobles in this room and have the full ability to call forth this body if I have grievances to address with it. Do I not? Harry asked.
The invites to the first auction went out on Saturday afternoon. One Wednesday Harry woke to a letter from Ragnok, the manager of the Rome branch and High King of the Goblins. Traditionally each goblin branch in each country was under the authority of a specific Goblin clan who’s head was called king. With almost over 200 branches worldwide the over 100 clans had one or two branches apiece. Ragnok as High King headed the Rome branch as the Camelot branch was locked down. From the Rome branch all the fees and costs were set for all Gringotts. Though the British Gringotts itself did not have to worry about the Dwarf or Nome banks the other Gringotts branches and Rome as the head branch did as most countries did not have the treaties the British Goblins did. Many of the European Branches only relied on the Albion treaty of 1018 to hold the Goblins, to their word. In that treaty the Goblin’s where given the right to bank in Albion but not exclusively and part of the Bank would be owned by the Pendragon line, along with the Goblins being forced to swear fealty to the Crown.
“So, I did.” Draco looked around he saw on the walls so many more vines, vines that he could undertake the rite for an gain their power but looking down at the Emrys ring now sitting on his finger, Draco thought of the story the old man had told before making up his mind. “None,” at Silas shocked look he continued. “if I made power the strongest thing in my life, I could challenge every vine in this room and still not be satisfied. I would leave this room and become no better than Lord Le-Fay and my father who have hardened their hearts to reason and have focused their eyes only on power not seeing the consequences. I would make myself an enemy of a man that I love and that, that, is not what I desire. I desire to give our world peace again, to serve a just king that will think of others before his own desires. I want the house of Malfoy to be able to stand proud of their heritage, I want my sons to say that they come from an honorable line. No, I am done I have claimed what will be mine, the others, the others can be left for future descendants, their power is not mine and I desire them not.” Draco answered and the room went white and he closed his eyes again.
“Very well let's start here and then we’ll head over to Horizant Alley to get the rest of the things you’re looking for.”
"You know an extra perk of having the fund be Albion wide," at their blank looks Harry continued "the rules of guardianship for protectorates follows the Albion laws as well, not the ministry's as such the forbidding you to tell those not in the know of Blood Rites does not apply." The three talked through the night before they went to bed so the younger two could rise early to return to Hogwarts for Thursday Morning classes.
"Grindelwald's greatest desire was to see the throne at Camelot, or the death of every ancestral line in the world if he couldn't, he never achieved either before he was imprisoned by Dumbledore, its why that prophecy is classified as broken. Did it come up in your search Harry?" Sirius asked from the doorway. He looked a bit haggard as he entered and took a seat.
"I will not however be grading on the content of your class notes, however I do expect for you to have at least six inches by the end of this double period. I will encourage discussion from your peers in this class, as long as it is kept civil. Do not be afraid to ask questions, I am a pureblood lord, just because a term is known to me does not mean it will to our first gens, or our students that were raised in the mundane world. However, be courteous, I do not wish to see that hand waving in the air. Light the tip of your wand and then raise it into the air."
Draco sat up and looked around the spacious bedroom. Looking down he found himself in rich robes far more akin to his grandfathers ICW robes than his school robes. He turned as a knocking on the door caught his attention.
Harry had been expecting to be placed in the Beginner or Experienced groups but after a few duels with his classmates and accidently disarming Viktor, he had been placed in the Trained category. After tutoring that night Harry had approached professor Krum and asked him "Why did you place me in the trained group I've never been trained to use a blade, disarming Viktor was a fluke."
"Now, Lord Potter be reasonable, it is one boy's happiness, for Britain's continued good grace with Russia, please reconsider." The minister asks.
Late into the evening Harry found himself on a balcony watching the festival in the street below, getting a breath of air, when he was approached.
"I believe a visit to the library would be in order, after dinner tomorrow night we will be having our first session." Stated Donavan Krum.
Sirius looked forlornly at the bed in the Potter castle infirmary where Harry laid. Without Harry being conscious they couldn’t move him from the manor. It made Sirius feel frustrated. Harry had faced Grindelwald alone, he had summoned the troops from dragons moor to him in a powerful way, but he had nearly killed himself doing it. It made Sirius angry as a father he only wanted his son protected, but due to Harry’s upbringing, he was used to having to keep things to himself and only being able to rely on himself. Because of this he rarely shared his full plans with anyone else. Sirius was determined that when Harry woke, he and Harry would be having a long discussion about keeping him safe from harm. And how his safety was as important as others after all he was the last of the main line of Potters.
Ron who had accompanied his brother had apologized to Harry but both Harry and Bill could see the strain on the friendship between the two boys. Harry lamentingly set it aside as they had just grown to distant with all the changes Harry was making in his life. He mourned for the change in his friendship but also knew that his new friends, and Neville would be beside in ways that Ron could not.
“A Lord's duty is vast and is full of strenuous responsibilities. As a bearer, you are male and qualify for the lordship, and are expected take up those responsibilities. However, in this day in age, you will also be looked down upon as weak and needing to be cared for. Most don’t remember that we have to be strong enough to both wage war and mother children and in doing so bearer’s historically when they have headed family or even ruled Albion itself those houses and Albion were blessed and prospered under their guidance.”
"The question of "What house/s of the rank they had been assigned would ascend to the next tier first," but they never turned anything in?" Abraxas asked incredulously.
"What was who talking about?" Neville asked, as Marvolo only picked him up high off the ground, beginning to cut off his air supply, as his collar cut into his throat.
House Potter has not collected on debts owed for quite a while, and this has allowed a buildup that would gut the finances of Lord Le-fays vassals. As said tax was our due wage to maintain the Moor and the Army, and set by the king, the ministries can't forbid us from seeking answer to the tax."
Harry woke up on Monday morning and headed down to breakfast meeting several of his friends in the Great Hall as breakfast began at 6 AM, classes may not start for three hours but Harry had always been an early riser. "Good morning students I hope you have your homework done." Said Professor Sevine walking by. As the students passed Harry watched for Professor McGonagall needing to give her the updated letter from his "head of house". It was the same as the first but instead of merely saying titles now said professors actual name as Professor Umbridge had been given an additional title as well and could theoretically use it to give Harry detention. For some reason Harry's magic recoiled at the very thought.
"We will hear the most recent two and the rest we will take copies of to listen to on our own later, and before you protest, I am well aware of the full rights of the elder houses. As these prophecies were found by a blood trace, they pertain to us in some way as such we are entitled to copies to refer to at our pleasure of all the prophecies listed." Harry answered him after confirming this with Neville.
A few simple spells had them at the feet of the giants, but after that that the real trouble began. Giants were ridiculously spell resistant, so every spell Neville and Harry sent at them either bounced off or did very little damage. For their spells to have any real affect they had to put far too much power into the spell. It was only by casting spells on themselves that Harry was finally able to get up far enough on the giant's body to use his sword to properly kill the giant. Neville seeing it work for Harry attempted the same thing with the other giant and succeeded. It was a single sharp cry from the direction of the school that caught Harry and Neville's attention next.
“This was continued on the 1st of every month in the years 1982 through 1990. This only happened the first of the month in 1991 for January through July. In August 1991 there were 100 galleons withdrawn by you and a further 1400 galleons withdrawn by Albus Dumbledore. They were also deposited into separate accounts 800 Galleons were deposited in Albus Dumbledore’s personal vault, 200 into the personal vault of Severus Snape, 200 into the personal vault of Molly Weasley, and 200 into the personal vault of Ronald Weasley. In September 1991 there were 1500 galleons withdrawn by Albus Dumbledore. They were also deposited into separate accounts 900 Galleons were deposited in Albus Dumbledore’s personal vault, 200 into the personal vault of Severus Snape, 200 into the personal vault of Molly Weasley, and 200 into the personal vault of Ronald Weasley.”
"To truly understand you have to break them down into three groups, High, Middle and Low. The High ancestral houses are different. And I don't mean different as in the way that every ancestral house is different, they are not like or even akin to most of the other houses. The biggest thing about them is that, we don't even know how old they are, it is not public knowledge, nor is it know their family histories, these are the house mentioned in myth and legends. With such age comes power and knowledge that is hard for the other houses to compete with. It is said that their magic feels old as not even the tombs of Egypt feel old." Harry paused here and Draco Malfoy spoke up.
“Oh,” Draco said exchanging a look with Neville who shrugged. That was not how agreements with the goblins ended.
"Now you are my fifth year Gryffindor- Ravenclaw class, as Mr. Weasley said you have more than a few free periods in your schedule's. You may wish to slack and go flying, play games, nap, or other such activities in these periods. While here at the beginning of term that may be perfectly fine, by mid-October you will find that it will not work. You are fifth years this means that at the middle of next May you will be taking the OWL exams. Between now and then you will have, usually, a weekly essay assignment for each of your classes, and at least for my class a monthly group or partnered Project, as such you will need those extra free periods for Homework, and for spell practice."
"Sirius, I don't think a single teacher has actually fully read the charter, Bullying runs rampant throughout the entire school. The teachers have done nothing to stop it. If something doesn't change soon Hogwarts is going to shortly face ICW educational reprimands."
"Perhaps if you ask him the Potter brat could teach you a thing or two about wielding the family magics, they do know a thing or two about them, after all they are a great mystery to the ancestral council." Grindelwald comments back a smirk running across his features as he riled Marvolo up some more. "Oh, the vaunted title of ancestral is finally yours, and all the power that comes with it, yet you the head can't even use the family magic enough to silence one man and his army, and you expect to be King? How much damage truly did blood rights do to you, that this is all the power an ancestral head can muster, it's no wonder your forces are struggling under the power of a boy. But then considering the house he hails from, that is no surprise."
As Peter left, Severus walked in and up to the dais on which the throne sat. “My Lord, you summoned me.”
“Our kings are chosen by the land, the Ramses were chosen by the land, almost two millennia ago, over two millennia before that another house was chosen to rule these lands. The earth knows what its people need, she cares for us and is our mother, she doesn’t raise men to be king for no reason. You have battled my daughters words all day, but if the magic of Albion chose you over all those others their must be a reason. I see that reason, it is the reason that from the Hittite, to the Mandarin, to even Japan, your last name is both a curse and an honor, they all desire your houses power to stand at their sides, but curse you when that power is used against them. The power of house Potter is known to them, and they feared most of all, the day that an Albion daughter would bind herself in marriage to a Potter son, knowing that with every instance, it gave the house of Potter one more tie to throne. For some of us, it is unsurprising that a child of your house would be named Albion’s next king.”
"Enough all this talk of the fund is nonsense; the minister will silence it within the day and house Potter will be reprimanded for trying to undermine the ministry. Return to your seats." Ordered the High Inquisitor.
As Harry walked into the Ritual Room, he was almost overcome by nervousness. Traditionally, he would have been eleven, walking in here with his father by his side, a parent who was familiar with the family magic and could aid him in this ritual. Of course, it would also be done in one of the family seats as well. But here he had to do it alone by himself. It was infuriating Harry as he slowly realized what it was that Tom had tried to take away. While he stood in the doorway the significance of it all finally dawned on him. He was the last of the Potters. It was both his job and his duty to return the family name to its former prestige and honor through deeds and work to leave a legacy behind for the children he would someday have. His heart clenched, overwhelmed that by doing this ritual he would earn a further connection to his parents but also gain responsibility as well. Pulling himself from his morose thoughts he took in the appearance of the room he found himself in.
"I have three here, Vernon, Marge, and Petunia Dursley nee Evans, registered for this list as of 1979 for attacking Lilly Potter nee Evans, Petunia's sister after being informed that she was carrying the next Potter heir. The attack was so bad that she was placed in St. Mungo's for a week, and almost lost the next heir Potter no less than four times in that week. Said muggle's only answer for the attack was that she had deserved it for daring to attempt to bring another" she choked on the next word "freak into the world. Bring consideration forward with Miss. Evans over possibly erasing the memory of our world and her from her sister and brothers-in-law's minds."
"Hermione, it is not cheating we are all working on the assignment and doing the work. None of us however see a point in extra work that isn't going to matter as we start DADA with tutors next week. And as such we will not be in her class any longer." Replied Neville.
Professor McGonagall opened the letter and quickly scanned it noting only the names in addition to the title's had changed but having been briefed by Albus last night she understood the necessity. "Well Mr. Potter it certainly looks in order I will give it to the headmaster and a copy to Delores this morning."
"You have no right to object to anything the headmaster says," sneers Professor Snape. "10 points from Gryffindor for doing so and a further 10 points for not wearing the correct uniform as well, I suggest you look at your own attire before commenting on the attire of others, Mr. Potter."
"Now many of you are wondering about the second white board. These boards you will take with you along with the endless journal I had each of you buy. The board contains your text to read over for the next week it is your homework to transcribe it over to your journals every week. Eventually as we move forward, I will give multiple texts in a week, but I can only send 1 text at a time to your boards it will be your job to transcribe the previous text before it clears, and the next one is given."
"I'm sure you were pup however we have some new things we need to talk about, Krisp got back this morning with his report from the ministry. He wasn't happy, and you aren't going to be either."
"Perhaps taking you through the path up can help." Draco interrupted. "As a muggleborn you join the rank of over fifty percent of the populous in being a commoner. Now say a commoner wishes to ascend to the noble class. The first question would be is he/she part of a house. If not he/she needs to create a house. The creation of a house means that he needs to marry someone, not of the noble peerage, and not already part of a house. If he/she marries a daughter or son of a noble house, or a house at all then he forms a new cadet line for that house." Draco continues.
Harry opened his eyes not to find himself in the meadow that Michalis seemed to favor, or in the combat room that he had learned his guardian James favored. Instead, he found himself in an office, a very familiar office much like the office he had in the manor. This Harry thought was the Potter family study, but looking closer at some ofthe finer details, the books on the shelves, the people in the photographs, Harry realized it was a study, but not the study at the manor just very similar to it.
Harry walked into the great hall the next morning slightly frustrated, wondering if his actions the night before had been right but Marvolo seemed content to wallow in his power not realizing that there was more to being king than just power. Harry had no doubt given the right circumstances Marvolo could be a great ruler but at this point in time he was too caught up in his own power.
"From the East we call the element of Air will you please now join us?" with that he set the bowl in the eastern section of the circle and placed the yellow candle that had been sitting there in the bowl before then lighting it. The two then turned to face the South and Neville spoke.
"A fortuitous response as no doubt that would have been a way for the Ministry to slander young heir Potter in the prophet otherwise. As for your addressment of him, I believe in the Wizengamot he quite clearly stated that he was to be addressed by his status, I suggest you do so." Abraxas said.
Later after the Weasley brother’s had left as to not call attention to the fact that Sirius was not at Grimmauld Place. Harry spoke with Sirius over both the Potter Lord Heirship status and the Blood adoption.
The news of a full audit being done at Gringotts had broken the next day and had taken attention off of Harry. But it had been in those days as he had been learning of his family’s place in the world that Harry and Sirius received a visitor in the form of the newly name Lord William Weasley. The ring had rejected their father years before but had accepted Charlie as its master. Upon being briefed by the goblins over the matter of Molly’s, Ginny’s, and Ron’s vaults, he had inferred that there was one for Hermione as well. He had escorted them to the bank, and it had been cataloged by the goblins that although both Molly, and Ginny had entered the vaults created by Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione had not. Ron had quickly after being told authorized the return of the money to the Potter vaults as Bill had done the same for Molly’s and Ginny’s noting the spent amounts and speaking to Harry of it.
"Arrogant as always Mr. Potter, well you won't be getting away with it this time, you'll be expelled for certain." Snape spoke glee evident in his tone.
“Grab hold of me, Harry,” said Alrick as the four apparated to High street and into another grand adventure.
“Well, then we are both in luck as I have indeed taken not just the heirship ring but the Lordship ring as well. By rights of the last of line clause and am at this moment also emancipated.”
After the impromptu interview with Rita Seeker, Viktor asked Harry out on a date scheduled for the next Hogsmeade weekend which was in two weeks the first weekend in October. Sirius and Donavan Krum both noticed the glare that Draco sent Viktor's way at the end of the night, as Viktor escorted Harry to the dorms.
Harry's eyes snapped to the front as Professor Malfoy spoke as he had finished with the seventh years. "The boards have now reset, please find your seats." After the class had assembled and everyone had found their seat he continued. "On each of your desks is two linked white boards, one has your name on it, yes there will be assigned seats so please no complaining they are final. Those white boards will also have the name of the your year partner that you will have to work with on all weekly projects occasionally on the projects you and your partner will be paired with another group or two depending on the project but going over your schedule that would only happen about once every month or so. If you are not in your seat, please find your correct seat now." Said their professor.
"You are aware that Lord Le-Fay won't leave you two alone after this. He's going to see this as a challenge." Theodore Nott drawled from his place by the fire as the group of four entered the room, the group used for the club meetings.
“Indeed, Lord Potter one does not merely order to see the High King of the Goblins.” Narlfist echoed. “Anything you need speak of can be spoken of to me. I am head of the Egyptian bank.”
“A filthy half-blood like you has no rights to…” The man in the back that had spoken, stopped, as the temperature in the room dropped.
“No pup and I admit they could have changed, but I believe you would have better luck looking to the American, French or Germanic cousins, I know the family distance is a couple generations larger, but they are family. I can't believe I’m going to say this, but Draco Malfoy will be far better friends than them, he at least offered a handshake, they would turn their nose up and treat you worse than he ever did for the simple fact that you are James’s son. I know you don’t want to hear it but masks up pup, just until we know for sure where everyone stands, who else of the cousins that you invited are here?
"If you are considering it, I suggest you talk to your father about the consequences of failure, you could gain considerable power from it, or you could lose quite a lot as well."
Harry and his group quickly went on the defense, giving time for the students that had been on the grounds against Harry's advice, time to escape back into the castle. It was several moments after that before the death eaters were able to mobilize in any form to protect the school, despite Harry's best efforts the school was not prepared for this attack and now a battle would have be fought to defend it, with Harry at the head his group went forward moving from a defensive position to attacking the incoming Russian troops never moving far beyond the entrance to Hogwarts, to properly defend against the incoming men.
"Harry James Potter that is the second time you have you have threatened blood feud against someone, first Dumbledore, now Hannah I am beginning to understand what Dumbledore means when he says you are ill-prepared for your lordship threatening such things. Blood feuds are simply justified murders of rival families in bygone eras, you have no business bringing back the practice. You ought to be ashamed of yourself Harry." Scolded Hermione.
"Among all those responsibilities, I also have to oversee many of the business aspects of the house, and personally write letters of permission to every adult member of a cadet branch of the House for every job change, for all the votes that are cast for the house etcetera, on top of also going through every vote and law proposed by Wizengamot and the ICW as in all but official capacity to those bodies I am the head of House, and must give authorization for every vote. Even then I have also just added a whole new slew of children and families I'm to provide for until another house can stand as protectorate for them, among all my other responsibilities. So, no Miss Ameria, my answer of "I don't have time between my House responsibilities, and all my other classes" was not a joke. At this point I've already quit quidditch and received all of your censure from it as well. Moreover, for your information I never told anyone anything about what we talked about yesterday, but there were enough patrons in the hogshead, that any one of them would have told, now will people allow me to actually sit down and eat breakfast and perhaps read the paper for a moment so that I can actually understand why you all seem so concerned that I told something." Harry finally snapped, ranting and putting all his responsibilities out there for people to see. Come on this was common knowledge to most people.
“Consort Malfoy, a fine day to you and the days greetings, what has awakened your ire?” Abraxas Malfoy asked. “The last time I remember you being so angry you gave my grandfather such a tongue lashing that he voted conservatively for the rest of his days.” He said continuing and cluing in a few others.
A few tried before Draco raised his hand. "The trails of knighthood are at the Winter solstice, and the Summer solstice. If you can pass the trials, you automatically receive a mastery in Defense against the Dark Arts."
This is your notice that the dwarf clan of Switzerland, have finished our preparations for rendering the basilisk. When you are ready please send the beast with several elves and we will begin the rendering process. From the memories you sent us, we have assumed that this Basilisk is approximately 40 to 50 feet in length and approximately 10 feet in diameter. Taking this into consideration we recommend that once the serpent has been rendered. That we separate the auctioning of this beast into several different auctions. A minimum of at least 10 auctions, by our estimations, as to not oversaturate the market.
"Of course, now how about you students finish eating as I explain the other safety measures in place." With that Madame Delacour went through step by step the document that outlined the fund and the usages of the fund.
Lord Zabini merely snorted from behind them all before speaking, "the message isn't for you, Lord Malfoy. Rumor has it that the Evan-Shade Potter grimoire is more than a simple grimoire passed down from generation to generation. It doesn't carry the usual family rules, secrets and spells. That grimoire if the stories are accurate contains the exact plans, thoughts, and maneuverings of Ignatius Potter, the man who single-handedly carved out and secured the Potters both Dragon's Moor and the position of chief Commander of Albion's armies, but also ensconced them far enough into the politics of house Evan-Shade that three centuries later, they were the only house to free themselves from vassalage to that house without consequences. Even the house of Slytherin has not done that."
"Delores, as far as I am aware your fifth year class just started, what have these students done that they needed escorted to my office. I have just started a meeting with these fine gentlemen?" Asked Dumbledore.
“I was not aware your father had passed or that your family had grown weary of using the Michalis’s Office, Heir Calmir.” Said a woman from the open doorway behind the secretary’s desk.
Harry watching Neville run to aid Viktor and the student, began to search the battlefield attempting to locate Grindelwald, it was time to end this. Finding him, Harry weaved through the other combatants. Cutting down soldiers and deflecting spells as needed to get to where Grindelwald was facing off with both Marvolo and Dumbledore. As he got closer to the fight, he began to see very clearly that Marvolo, and Dumbledore where losing the battle. Arriving at the battle he had barely enough time to tackle Marvolo, taking a spell that neither Marvolo nor he could properly defend against. Rising Harry reached up to dislodge the two inch in diameter icicle that had lodged itself a few inches into his shoulder, from the spell that he had taken for Marvolo. "This has gone on for long enough, Grindelwald, surrender now and I won't execute you as my house's magic is screaming at me to do. Surrender and I'll let you live out the rest of your life in a comfy prison."
“Enough, I have had enough of your bickering for the day be gone from my presence until the celebration on the morrow be gone.” Xerxes said, and the guards standing forward were quick to escort the glaring bickering women away.
“Very well Potter investments are making 20 million a year but that is down from the 50 at the time of your parents’ death, due to market changes and we have not been allowed to access the family vault to properly manage your investments.” Sharptooth stated.
“Merry met and may your gold ever increase Lord Potter, there is much to do today, so please be seated will your guards remain in the room for our meeting or do you wish for them to wait outside?” Sharptooth asked.
“So, what you are saying is if there was a lord Peverell then they could return my godfathers soul to his body.” Harry asked quickly.
“That may be your opinion Xerxes, but Alomar has proven himself capable, and the decision was our fathers, not ours.” Serenity said before continuing. “Now before you continue shall I remind you that the streets have ears, furthermore I am with Grandmothers guests, I would think you would want to make a better impression on them.”
"Yeah Ignatius taught me about the Potters position and responsibilities in the Empire, I'm beginning to understand a bit more of why the house magic was so insistent I cast my aunt from the family. We were protectorates to the crown, family really, we trained them in the art of war, we shared some of our house magic with them even. It's help me understand why my dad's journals talk about growing besides Neville's dad and being raised as brothers but that there was always the feel of one missing."
“Wait full blood rites as in more than four houses on his inheritance sheet. He does know that more than one failure in a full blood rite means he will die right?” Draco asked
Today however was finally Saturday, a Saturday without meetings or homework to catch up on. It was also a Hogsmeade weekend, and Harry and Viktor were going into town to celebrate later with many other students that needed a break from classes. Being November 25th, many students had begun to review for the winter exams that would take place before they went home on the 15th of December. With it also being the second to last Hogsmeade weekend before break many students were also looking at Christmas presents for loved ones, family, and friends. Harry was rather relieved, in potions the project they were currently working on in groups was there winter final, in defense the final was simply to take the knights test given on several dates over the holidays, his other classes, would be far easier Harry had no doubt but was studying none the less as his comments about his grades a few weeks before had angered several of the teachers who had begun to challenge and belittle him in classes, before being severely reprimanded for it by the ICW board still in the school.
“Well, that was unexpected.” Harry said before laughing as Neville too couldn’t hold back his laughter. Neville and Harry moved on after that, escorted by Serenity for some time, Harry was focusing on pushing her words out of his head, it couldn’t be that bad, could it? The power of the king wasn’t that vast was it?
“Except that the next lord Peverell will be a bearer and have stronger ties to Albion than he will to us. I may not be able to say more but I can say this: Grindelwald will wish Charlus Potter had been allowed to give him his death by time that young man is through with him. He will change the political climates of all the empires and lead our people as a whole through the trials that come after the convergence point.” Nefertiti answered him.
"Ok a few questions, magically connect, I understood the emotional connection but magical, I'm not familiar with that? Secondly why hide it? Thirdly I feel like there is a bit bigger of a reason for you not wanting to pay out of your trust fund than just being a snob." Harry asked.
She carefully followed the boys up the stairs and to the Ancient Runes Classroom before shouting "Harry James Potter what are you doing, this isn't your class and besides if you were taking Ancient Runes now you would be taking it with the 3rd years, now go back to doing your history homework, you don't belong in this classroom."
Tuesday night saw Harry enveloping two scared thirteen year old boys into hugs, and just holding them, letting them draw strength from his magics. Artemis had gasped seeing Marcus, understanding dawning within as to what he was. Harry had only motioned for silence from his house. The boys had finally settled, into Gryffindor and Harry had retired for the night.
Arriving there he was greeted by the sight of five black knights. The black nights where called such as they were the king's hand through his commander that gathered information, committed sabotage, and the other underhanded duties that went into protecting an empire and its people. Because of their affiliation with the shadows and darkness, and their all black attire people had taken to calling them black knights, as they were also assassins as well also numbered among the most deadly men in the land, they were trained from the age of 8 solely at dragons-moor and everyone was a ward of house Potter. Harry quickly received their reports.
“Enough Knarlnock, you have shamed us once more be gone with one of the other guards will take your place, I will deal with you later. My apologies Lord Potter but I know not of the incident of which you speak. I am Narfist head of the clan that operates here in Memphis.” The intruder answered.
“It was simply is one of those things that students are supposed to get naturally curious about or some such nonsense.”
"Why are you telling us this?" asked Minerva in annoyance. "I doubt you have deigned to have us aid you in the cleanup, so I fail to see the reason for our presence."
Ron from what he had been told had spoken to Hermione of doing the same and she had refused. Stating that Dumbledore had given it to her and that she had a right to the money. After that and her subsequent outburst, Bill had had both her and Ron tested for any and all Potions and spells in their systems and on their personages. They had both come back positive. Ron had quickly at Bill’s prompting undertaken the ritual that would remove all said spells and potions. Hermione had refused on the basis of all Rituals being dark according to Dumbledore and that they should be outlawed.
“Let me finish, you know in muggle primary you study things like history, and I had always been fascinated with Rome. I never knew that Rome almost fell before it truly grew to shine.”
“Trial Transcripts are immediately duplicated and filed by the royal magic inherent in the Magic of Albion, they cannot be misplaced. However, I need not tell you that minister as you were informed almost 18 months ago as to this fact and ignored it. Which is why house Black through House Potter has now levied a case with the ICW.”
"However, Seamus for example is different and has the more normal circumstances with his Mum not having final say as her head of house still lives. Her father…"
“There is nothing I can do, my hands are tied. The ICW cannot interfere in the workings of the Ancestral houses, the other houses have to guard against them themselves. As Lord Le-fay supports this, as the lord of an ancestral house he has the right to stay the kings law, in this instance, he would have to answer to the king or the head of the house they belong to for it, but it is in his rights.” Nikodemus answered.
I look forward to your visit and welcome you to the Court of the Nile. May it feed you and bless you, despite the secrets held beneath her shores.
"Why didn't you and Professor McGonagall just discuss it maybe you could have recovered your grades or something?" someone asked.
To which Harry winces. Everyone knows the sentence for thievery was death, but he composes himself. He has nothing to hide and so confidently replies.
"Miss, Granger I will forgive you for questioning my liege's honor this once, in honor of the fact you are a first-gen. In the future, if you challenge the honor of my liege I will put you in your place." Said Tyler Potter.
“He speaks the truth Narlfist. Blood Inheritance marks him as Heir of house Pendragon, our oath stands to him. Grinholt turning to Harry bows and says. “As my liege so commands so shall it be done.
"I don't exactly have my key," Harry stammers, having learned the night before just how bad that was.
The boys responded positively before retreating to the library for a joint study session, leaving the adults to argue.
"The I sincerely hope I did not just hear you threaten an underage heir with Azkaban, considering I'm here to personally investigate exactly what happened there ever so recently. As the ICW's international courts have ruled that your investigations were inconclusive and incomplete at best or your ministry sabotaged, and downright impudently ignored the evidence at worst, considering the report on my desk this morning said that the blame rested on the head of Sirius Black, when I was with him for the convening hours both at the time of the attack and at the time of which he would have required to use a time turner or polyjuice."
"Now I understand that Binn's mostly lectured straight from the book, I will not, I will be expecting you to have read the next chapter of our book for Monday's class. We will then spend Monday going over what all you need to know in the chapter and Friday mornings class we will be having open discussion of the different things we have covered in said chapter and tying them into previous chapters. I will have that time open for you to ask questions."
"I'll be dealing with Russia no doubt sooner than later, the recent letter regarding Artemis notwithstanding. On to other matters, I know that you and Andy are also working through recent laws passed by the Wizengamot since the last monarch was on the throne any severe one's we need to immediately deal with before it comes back to bite us?" Harry asked.
“That boy has all but signed the death warrant for the house, a death warrant I tell you.” Her words echoed in the hall, as the footsteps of several youngsters did as well.
"Regulus my brother, in life we were not as close as I would have liked, but you were still my brother by blood. Things would be different if you were here and I hope you understand the path I am guiding the house of Black down. You will always be remembered by me and mine." Turning away and towards the crowd Sirius addressed them now. "I have many more to thank however due to time constraints and the amount of people here we ask that you only call on three people this night as we do wish to cast a full circle as well tonight. I thank you for coming and ask that you enjoy this Samhain feast. The circle is scheduled to be cast at ten, enjoy." With that people got plates and approached the fire, Harry and Neville as tradition dictated waited until last. Spending the hours watching others honor and thank those who had gone before, while talking quietly to each other, and to others, until shortly before ten it was there turn.
