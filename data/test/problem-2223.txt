"You're acting as if you aren't upset that he attacked you," Harry noted.
"I promise, I'll look into it," Harry pressed.
“Macnair. Walden Macnair.”
Draco crossed the room with two of his wide steps to snake his arms around Harry’s neck. “I hope you mean for the better.”
“For waking me up last night,” Malfoy huffed before flicking his forehead once more.
He’d walked in on quite the sight. Draco and Hermione were huddled under blankets with clutching cups of tea in front of the drawing room fireplace. They were closer than Harry had ever seen them – other than the time Hermione slapped him across the face. They almost looked like friends now. The moment Draco had seen Harry, he’d launched towards him to envelop him in a hug which was preceded almost instantly by a slap across the chest.
“She talked about you while
Harry was still too shocked to be offended. “You’d actually help me with my studies?” He scanned the boy. “There isn’t a catch, right?”
“The term you’re looking for is shagging,” Pansy said.
When going off to Hogwarts, he had decided to leave the book at home so no one would notice it. However, when he returned that year, his hiding spot was empty and the only thing to welcome him home was a curt conversation he had to have with his father. In addition, Dobby was revoked from having anything to do with Draco. He had become Lucius’s personal elf, not that Draco really cared. Dobby had been the only one to know about the loose floorboard under his bed where he hid it. He must have squealed.
Harry shrugged. "Maybe one."
Harry's thoughts had a short run before he frowned at his friend. "What do you mean 'might have been?' It sounds like Skeres is guilty."
“Just give me five minutes, okay? And make sure to pronounce it properly.”
"Malfoy didn't kill Fred!" The second the words came out of his mouth, Harry knew he’d gone too far. This was not the day to say that name.
“She’s mad. I’m fine,” Harry snarled the moment they gained their footing once again. They had just returned from the hospital after Healer Sow ran several tests and advised that Harry should remain out of the office for a few more days. Draco wasn’t too surprised by this verdict. It was hard for the body to heal from potent curses without sufficient rest, and coating his insides with liquor was likely not expediting the processes.
“He looked at me like that too. I can’t… I don’t trust you.”
Harry simply didn’t know how to go about things. Having Narcissa’s approval was reassuring but approval for what exactly? Harry and Draco had never actually had a proper conversation about it. He considered telling Draco what Narcissa had said but he felt that wouldn’t end well. He couldn’t see Draco finding comfort in them talking behind his back.
The scoff which followed was enough answer at that hour. Malfoy made his own derisive sound and continued up the stairs.
“No, you aren’t,” he urged, earning Draco’s attention. “The pictures were taken out front. Whoever took them knows where you live.”
Robards didn’t reprimand him this time. He let out a long sigh. “And I regret not taking you seriously but there is nothing I can do about it now. We’ll just have to do what we can to clean this up.” He picked up the paper and began to fold it back up. “For now I’m putting you on light duty. I think it would be best if you stay in the office as much as possible while this sorts itself out.”
With a strange turn of advents, being surrounded by dark witches and wizards was probably the most comforting part of his day because nothing changed. Walking down the dark, crooked street with the current news was no different than any time before. Everyone glared just the same.
"Well," Malfoy said, earning Harry's gaze, "I, for one, don't think you're anything great, certainly not a hero." A smile broke out across Harry's face before Malfoy could finish, and he found it climbing onto his own face. "You're always welcome here if you need someone to remind you that."
Frustration, and a bit of curiosity, got the better of Draco. Harry would be gone fifteen to twenty minutes. He had plenty of time to take a peek before he got back. Maybe there was something simple Harry was simply too tired to see.
Draco’s face fell. “Bother me? Why would talking about a girl bother me? Did something else happen?”
She rolled her eyes and plopped down onto the sofa beside Harry, her arms crossed and lips pursed. She shook her head. “I don’t know whether that’s sweet or idiotic.”
“Please,” Ron croaked. Draco drew up to his feet. He never thought he’d hear that word come out of a single Weasley’s lips. “It’s Harry.” Draco’s heart stuttered. He took a step towards the door. “
Madam Pince looked startled when she spotted Draco enter the library almost twenty minutes early. He offered his usual greeting and she returned it nearly automatically, though still appearing slightly taken aback. He didn’t bother himself with the matter, his feet already dragging him back towards the Muggle-Fiction section.
Harry opened his mouth to speak before shutting it again. The cautious assessment in Malfoy’s eyes was clear. He wasn’t just talking about quidditch.
He turned his head as if he meant to look at her but couldn’t force his eyes to do so. His gaze lingered on the sleeve of her blouse. “Nothing you would be proud of me for.”
“Ron, I–” Harry started, but Ron waved him off.
Something about Malfoy’s expression changed, but Harry couldn’t identify it, only that it felt like he had said something revealing. “You…like me?”
He also wouldn't put it past the Dursleys to have purposefully shielded him and, more importantly, their own son from any hint of that lifestyle. Hogwarts itself obviously wasn't the most diverse place. He wondered about Seamus and Dean a few times, but he always had so much going on that he couldn't ponder it for long.
It didn’t help that it was still difficult to look Ginny in the eye. Things had never quite felt the same since he returned. They had both decided to call it quits unless something changed. Harry had the feeling nothing would, and the look in her eyes told him she knew it too.
“They really have no idea what’s wrong with him?” Hermione urged.
Harry wheeled around to send a harsh glare. When Malfoy only smirked in response, he punched his foot. Malfoy gave a short kick, but it was enough to nearly knock Harry over.
The light turned on, illuminating a mostly empty fridge except for a few bottles of beer. Harry pulled out the bottles and searched for a best-by date – they were only two months out. With a shrug, he put the bottles on the counter for later and gestured to the inside of the fridge. "Regular food goes in here." He popped open the freezer, which hissed and crackled. There were some peas and TV dinner trays there. "Anything you want frozen goes up here. It makes it last even longer." He closed both doors, then pointed at the stove then the microwave above it. "Put it in here or here to warm it back up."
“Clearly you don’t know me as well as you think, then, Malfoy.” He leaned forward and picked up his mug, flicking the used teabag into the bin beside the door. He stirred lightly and took a sip.
Harry told himself it would be the last night. He’d have to go back to the house after that. He survived there for three years; he could manage to keep going.
“Pansy!” he snapped, but she only smirked at him. He deflated. She was the worst person to try to insult. She loved getting people riled up far too much, and insults were only proof she was getting under your skin. “Don’t talk like that when he wakes up,” said Draco. “I beg of you.”
“Shut up,” Draco spat. He rushed to his bed and hurried to yank the curtains shut around him.
Harry gritted his teeth. Everything in him wanted to throw up his wand arm or lunge across the room and simply finish it the muggle way. Only one thought kept him centered enough to drag his feet away. Draco was waiting for him in the Great Hall. That’s all that mattered. He would get to Draco, and Zabini’s taunts would go away, and he would be fine.
Malfoy ignored him, silently shooing him off towards the door. Malfoy unlocked it before they got there, and Harry stumbled out. He paused at the entrance, turning back to the blond. "Well, er, goodbye."
“Please, Malfoy,” his voice cracked. Ron cleared his throat, making a harsh sound like gravel crunching, but his eyes were still glossy. “I can’t lose another brother.
A sigh left Harry’s mouth, but it was too much for him to hold back his smile. “I know. That’s why I told you that you wouldn’t like it.”
Harry sighed. “I guess we’re really bad at hiding it if everyone keeps figuring it out.”
you. I don’t believe any of it anymore. Every kind gesture anyone has ever done for me was always to get something from me. Zabini wanted sex and protection. My father wanted me to do his bidding. My friends wanted to use my name. Everyone leaves. Everyone hurts me. You can’t say those things. I couldn’t stand it if you hurt me too.”
“Right…” Draco picked up the thick piece of leather and shoved it in his pocket. “I’ll be right back.” He started out the door. He could feel the resistance in his body as he crossed the threshold for the second time in twenty-four hours, but he shoved past it.
Malfoy stepped slowly towards the door. He didn’t want to frighten Harry, but he was, despite his best intentions, scared of what he was about to see. He pushed gently on the door.
Both men's attention snapped to her, their eyes wide. They both untangled themselves and took half steps away from one another. "What?"
"I'm fine. I just want to relax."
He hadn’t noticed he had stood until Hermione had spoken. He looked down at his friends. “Second-floor girls’ lavatory?”
Draco glanced down at his sleeves then back at Harry, a cool, innocent expression smoothing his features. “What I always wear.”
“I’m fine,” Draco repeated. His voice was small and weak but he appeared to be sincere. Fine was not a synonym for happy.
They set up their plates and were soon sitting down to eat again.
Harry straightened, a silent apology in his eyes.
Harry frowned. “Why would I tell you if I was?”
Harry continued to look at the snitch he’d been tossing, not turning his face towards the boy sitting on the edge of his bed. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Even in their hooded state, Malfoy saw Harry’s eyes light with mischief. His fingers moved, twisting at the shorter strands at the nape of his neck. Malfoy only barely managed to cover up the shiver that ran down his spine.
Saying Harry was crazy was one thing. Insulting Draco right in front of him was crossing a line. Harry dropped his arms and lurched forward. Everyone jumped back in alarm, seeing the rage in his eyes. He likely would have committed homicide had two sets of arms not suddenly grabbed him and pulled him back.
Harry lowered into it slowly, feeling the hair on the back of his neck rise as he did. This chair wasn’t for him. George seemed to pick up on his discomfort. “She’s the one who pointed out that Fred would have clobbered me had he seen me moping like I was. We put a lot of effort into getting this place up and running, I couldn’t let all of that go to waste.”
The sweet innocence slipped off of Draco’s face as he rolled his eyes. He began to fiddle with the buttons. “Fine, if you’re going to make a big deal about it.”
The boys had been bobbing side to side around the furniture like opposing magnets. Before long, they were on opposite sides of where they started, and Harry had mistakenly backed himself into a corner. Malfoy finally broke free and started towards him. Harry went for his only defense, which was grabbing Hermione by the shoulders and using her as a shield. This seemed to slow Malfoy down as she still held her wand, though now down towards the floor.
Before he could make a decision, Ron plopped into the empty chair, facing his father on the other end. “I think everyone rather see my handsome face, mum.”
"Why would Terry attack you?" Ron questioned.
“Threatened you?” the words came out like a curse. It was a lie. It had to be. “Why would he want to threaten you?”
There was no harm in checking. If he recalled, no one had failed to turn in their paper to Slughorn that day. They could have simply rewritten the original, but Draco could only imagine what a disaster a
Harry huffed, straightening up again. "Well, I guess I need to go back to Grimmauld. I'll be right back."
“Dray, Dray,” Harry cooed. He held Draco’s wrist, keeping him from walking away from the sofa to ‘fix’ something else. “It’s fine. Everything looks great. Sit.”
“Teddy,” Andromeda called sharply. They both snapped their heads up towards the woman. Her lips had thinned but her expression was otherwise smooth of any true disdain. “Come here.”
Harry grabbed his shoulder, tugging them both to a halt. He pulled Draco around to face him. “I’m checking on a
All of Harry’s muscles eased instantly. He tilted his head at Draco. “Oh, okay. What’s wrong with that?”
It was a sparse area, filled mostly by previous students and their childhood stories. Draco knew none of them, none except for
“Mhm,” Harry hummed. Jacob shuffled over to the table, tugging the jacket over his arms as he went. “Well, I came to do what I planned. I’ll be off then. I’ll be back in a day or two.”
He wondered...
Draco suddenly looked scandalized. “I do just fine without you while you’re at work. You do realize that not everything revolves around you, Saint Potter, right?”
“That’s what I said!”
Draco had been doing so well with keeping his temper in line. It drove him mad that Harry interrupted their time together to continue to do the work he'd just spent a majority of the day doing. It was worse when Kreacher popped into the flat in the middle of the night to deliver a message from the Auror Office, usually that Harry was needed at once. At the very least, these were rare events before but with whatever this case was, it was almost always one or the other each night. Harry barely got enough sleep to even function properly.
“Well, that’s why you came back for your eighth-year, right? To get to be a teenager without Voldemort hanging over your shoulder.”
She gestured him closer as she pulled out her wand. “If you’re going to continue taking care of this one, then I suggest you learn it. Come here.”
Teddy’s eyes widened. “The one Grandma doesn’t like?”
Harry nodded slowly. He surveyed her features. It was a coin toss of whether she’d ask for his autograph or slam the door in his face. He couldn’t imagine any witch or wizard in the British Isles hadn’t heard the news of Harry Potter’s sexuality or who he was snogging. Then again they appeared to be fairly remote out here. Maybe there was a chance.
“Fattening me up, Potter?” Draco muttered, ignoring the bowl of mashed potatoes Harry was trying to offer.
After saying their farewells to Kreacher, they started towards the apartment. They decided to take the long way back. This meant passing Allure, the gay club he used to pass every night and tried to pretend he didn’t notice. He didn’t feel self-conscious about looking at the rainbow flag above the door this time though; if anything he felt a short burst of pride in his chest when he glanced at it.
“No, I’m quite enjoying this,” said Malfoy.
It was so quiet, so still. He was certain Draco knew something was coming because there was no way he couldn’t hear Harry’s heart. It was now or never. “Ron told me something today.”
This time, what pulled them away was the nearby sound of money changing hands. They both pulled apart and looked around. Susan and Parvati were begrudgingly dropping sickles into Hermione’s hand.
“Notice what?” the pair echoed. They were looking up at their audience, Malfoy somehow having caught Harry’s wrists in a vice grip.
In no time at all, they arrived at Park Row. Malfoy perked up when he began to recognize the buildings around them. "See, it wasn't that far," said Harry.
Malfoy did not win the quidditch match, but it was damn near close. He kept insisting that Harry had cheated, even after they had washed up and were nearing the castle entrance. “Only someone who already has a bird’s nest for hair would risk going through the trees like that,” claimed Malfoy.
It was a quaint little house. There was enough space to move about but nothing that was too difficult to maintain on their own. Kreacher occasionally popped by to do the cleaning if he was feeling generous – Harry figured it was just his excuse to get away from the kids when they were feeling rambunctious. The ground floor was mostly made up of the sitting room and the kitchen. Upstairs there was a bath and two bedrooms – one for Draco and Harry and one for Teddy.
She rolled her eyes. “I told you I was going by their flat to check on Harry. He was asleep when I got there, so I told Malfoy to call me when they heard more.”
Potter shook his head. “No, maybe it was something from the twins’ shop.”
Her eyes showed a clear message, “Do I stop this?” Of which, Ron could not answer since he looked just as confused by his best mate’s giddy grin and his playfully bouncing partner.
It was so incredibly unlike Malfoy Manor that thinking about it too hard might have given him whiplash. He wondered what his life would have been like growing up with the simple change of backdrop. To see familiar smiling faces when he walked through the hall instead of scowling portraits that never withheld their disapproval whenever they felt it. He couldn’t even fathom his mother hand making something for him, not when they had house-elves to do the sewing.
Draco stared at the page for a long time. He couldn’t believe he had written all of that down. He was half tempted to tear it up and throw it away. However, he never planned to reveal his identity and it felt cathartic just putting some of his thoughts into words. What harm could it really do?
Everyone in the room looked at Ron with wide eyes. Why did it feel like they were being accused of something scandalous?
Of course, he hadn't been expecting to be alone. Things had gotten rough between him and Ginny after her brother's death. It was understandable. Harry could still feel a pang in his chest when he went past the darkened storefront of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Not to mention she still had two years left at Hogwarts, and long-distance just hadn't been working for them - it did make things awkward when he visited the Burrow, though.
"Are you working on anything specific?"
Friday after work, Harry was hurrying to get his desk relatively cleaned up so he could hurry home and change. He didn't move fast enough, Ron catching him as he stuffed a few files in his bag. "Hey, mate."
Harry pursed his lips, trying not to smile. He handed the cup back, looking up at the ceiling to avoid Malfoy's knowing eyes. "It's good, I guess."
Draco’s eyes sparkled, his own lips curving up. Harry closed the distance. In an instant, another happy memory was created within these walls. Pain really didn’t mean something wasn’t worth saving.
He nodded. “Draco told me.”
He pointed at the clock over the stove. “Aren’t you late for something?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so dramatic. When did I ever give you a scar?”
Draco waded through the books towards Harry. He looked like a sleepwalking man, his gaze glossed over while his brain worked a million miles away. “What if whoever took them tells someone else or someone recognize is it?”
Draco straightened. It was likely some sort of ploy. He simply wanted to get Draco’s attention so he could say something snide, but the chance that it was true ate at him. He peaked out from the curtain, just enough to see Zabini’s face. It was always so hard to read Zabini. It’s one of the reasons it was so easy for him to lie. “What did you do?”
Draco stuffed his hands into his lap, guarding them with his knees. His chin was raised high, his eyes locked with Harry’s bed as if he was still sitting over there. “You want to know what happened between Blaise and me?” he hissed.
“Hate to break it to you, but you aren’t interesting enough to be in my dreams.”
Before they could get into any deep discussion, they heard a gasp from the kitchen. “Cissy?”
A long grueling sigh pushed out of Malfoy’s mouth. “Fine.”
He started to rush to the kitchen but she grabbed his arm, pulling him back. "No, no," she said through an odd combination of tears and laughter. Before he could question her, she pulled him into a bone crushing hug.
"Heather," she said, noticing him looking for a nametag. "My name's Heather."
"Bye, Kreacher," he called over his shoulder and faintly heard a response before closing the door.
“Metamorphmagus, really?” Malfoy exclaimed. “Those are so rare! I’ve never met one in real life. I always assumed it was a myth. That there were some witches and wizards who were really good at Polyjuice potions.”
Draco’s arms, which had gradually been loosening in his comfort, suddenly tightened. Harry bit his lip. He could hear what that meant without words.
, Harry thought to himself. It had taken far too long to get Malfoy to trust him this much. He wasn’t supposed to have a motive. That’s what he promised. He couldn’t live with himself if Malfoy thought he’d done all of this just because he wanted to sleep with him. He never intended that. It wasn’t as if he knew for certain Malfoy was even into blokes.
“Again?” Harry asked, flabbergasted that Zabini had the gall to sneak someone in two nights in a row.
Harry eased a bit but he still didn’t feel quite right. Something was still off. “Then what’s wrong?”
The last two words circulated in his head the most.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I learned it from you,” Harry teased, sending him a mischievous smirk.
Draco chuckled. “That good?”
Harry scoffed aloud. “Ron and Hermione would never let them give me painkillers. They think I’d get addicted.”
Ron tilted his head thoughtfully. “Hm, tough call. It would have to be tied with a cross Hermione.”
Harry grinned and reached up to mess with his hair.
“Discipline?” roared the man.
There were several people in his Ministry that Harry would have gladly testified against. Dolorous Umbridge was one of them. Sadly there had been no proof that they had broken any law nor purposefully intended to cause harm. Hermione nearly had a hernia after hearing that one. Ron swore she slept with a law book beside her for two weeks, trying to come up with a way to catch that woman. None prevailed, but Umbridge did have enough sense to skip off out of the country after that.
“Yeah, that’s why you two are always arguing.”
The witch didn’t respond. She wouldn’t even look at the muggle. Her eyes were on the window, a sneer on her lips as she watched people walk by.
“First being an Auror and then the drinking. I was going insane. I’m sorry I overreacted at times, but if something happened to you...” He had to swallow his emotions in an attempt to keep his voice still. “I don’t think they would even let me into the funeral.” The tears finally fell over his red cheeks.
In his favorite, usually absolutely abandoned, part of the library stood a person. Not just any person either, it was Harry Potter and he was holding a light blue book.
She nodded solemnly. His silence was answer enough. “There are many doctrines I was raised to believe in. For all my life I have supported them. That is until my son was threatened. I defied my husband’s wishes to find help for our son when he was sent away with an impossible task; I lied to the Dark Lord and aided in losing the war so that I may see my son again. For my child, I will defy every belief I once held dear. All I want is to see is him happy and healthy and if you can do that, no matter the way in which it comes about, then I approve.”
They burst into the house. Mrs. Skeres nearly dropped her cup of tea when they came rushing into the sitting room. “What’s going on?” she demanded.
“That actually sounds sort of nice,” Hermione admitted.
,” Andromeda interjected sharply.
Harry leveled a look on him. “And those are the types of comments we won’t be making.”
Malfoy let out a long boisterous breath then pulled it all back in again as if he was summoning every ounce of calm he had left. Harry was curious if there was any left. Or maybe what it would take to get him to completely forget about his anger and start laughing.
“Fine,” Harry groaned as if Draco was asking him to do a heavy load of chores.
“She really wants us to visit her,” Draco sighed as he carded his fingers though Harry’s messy locks. Narcissa had sent her monthly letter which held the usual update on how she was doing and asking how Draco was and ended with an artfully written plea for them to visit her in France.
When the tea was ready, Harry managed to talk Draco into sitting out on the balcony with him. They watched in silence as the sun rose over the London skyline. The soft chirp of early morning birds gradually turned into a low hum as the city began to wake.
“Hya, Harry,” Ginny greeted with a small wave. She snapped her head away from him when the contents of the sauce pan she’d been stirring began to let off a sizzling sound.
He yanked the paper from the file which had Skeres address. “If Draco comes down, cover for me. This won’t take long.”
“Because it’s Malfoy,” Ron snapped. “He doesn’t know anything about loyalty. He couldn’t even be loyal to the Death Eaters. I’m not letting him get away this time!”
The rest of the week followed a similar routine as well as the next. The weekends called for some changes. Ron and Hermione invited them over for dinner on Sunday and it went shockingly well. Harry had never noticed before how similar Hermione’s and Draco’s interests were. For a heart stopping moment, he thought something bad was going to happen when they got into a heated discussion about the morality of time turners but when he and Ron tried to intervene, they both received vicious looks for interrupting such a riveting debate.
Draco closed the door and waved his wand at the latch, putting a few extra magical locks on it as Harry had suggested some time ago. "Same one as yesterday?" he asked, joining Harry at the table.
Harry looked up. He pled silently for Draco to let it go. This only seemed to resign Draco more. “You said I could ask anything,” he pressed.
“That’s why I’m here,” Harry stated. There was no point of acting otherwise. “Is Terry here?”
was happening,” Draco admitted. “Just mutterings. Something about how she should have listened to you. She should have taken your offer.”
They remained in silence for a long moment, their eyes locked. Harry thought Draco was going to ignore him but he watched as the mask slowly crumbled away. Draco’s eyes softened and gradually filled with remorse. His bottom lip trembled almost imperceptibly. Finally, he opened his mouth and a breath shook out. “What- What did he say?”
“All right, I’m going, see you in five.”
She leaned inside as if something was holding her hips outside the door. She glimpsed at a clock. “No, I think not. I don’t want to be late — owl me when he wakes, though, if you don’t mind. I’ll give you the address. Do you have a quill and parchment?” She scribbled the air like she already had the quill.
“Oh, we can’t have that,” Susan chided from beside her.
“Just give me the dates and I’ll be there,” Harry assured. He stepped up to the desk and dropped a single piece of paper in front of his boss. “That’s not what I wanted to talk about though.”
This story is great because I don’t remember writing half of it. I swear I only write this in the middle of the night, jotting down notes into my phone; half asleep on the computer when I should be in bed; or when I’m so frustrated with homework that I just angrily write between assignments. They are just so addicting to write about.
Harry cleared his throat, pulling Malfoy's attention back to him. "So, what happened if you didn't do anything?"
Harry snorted, taking hold of his hand the moment he began to turn out of his seat. “What type of losers do you take us for? Do you think we’re just going to reject you in public because of what others think?” His voice might have been a little louder than necessary, but it was sufficient. Harry’s grin doubled when he caught Zabini’s glare in the corner of his eye.
Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.
Harry let out a sigh. He walked back to Draco and cupped his shoulder. "You know, Roberts is always telling me how we need more informants." Draco perked up. Harry had to restrain a smile at how quickly that worked. "He says I play too rough, so they never want to help us out later."
Harry sighed, his eyes falling back to the door. “They did. I just wasn’t listening. I was too busy getting pissed over Ginny.”
Zabini swallowed. “Well, not everyone is the perfect golden boy.”
Harry put a hand over his mouth the keep from bursting out with laughter. It didn't work well. Malfoy glared at him. He tried to choke back his chuckles as he started to look around.
Harry shook his head. “No, I don’t. I don’t want you to be ashamed of your scars, I don’t want you to be alone, and I don’t want you to be afraid to be who you are.”
Harry frowned. There had still been a part of Terry’s story that didn’t add up: How did Goyle have Draco’s information at all? If Draco didn’t consider them to be friends then he wouldn’t have given him his private address. “You wouldn’t happen to have access to personal files, would you?”
Draco momentarily forgot about everyone else in the room, including Harry. All he saw was one of the few people who had ever left the Black family and lived to tell the tale. He leaned forward onto his knees. “May I ask you something?”
Robards made a gruff noise, picking up his reading glasses. "Prove me wrong, and we'll see."
Harry started to push himself off the bed when his heart was thrown into overdrive. “Or you could stay.”
Maybe Draco was right. Perhaps people just had the implacable ability of always making the wrong choice when it came to him. Chosen One or not, Harry was clearly not an exception.
“I don’t want to see you hurt either. Why do you think it drove me mad that you wouldn’t let me help you? You’re all that I’ve got, Harry. Physically or emotionally, it hurts me to see you hurt.
"Let's eat," Harry urged, eager to have a reason to stuff his mouth.
Pansy was having more and more trouble hiding her grin as she watched him trip over himself. They were acting awfully strange for a pair of ‘friends.’ It was almost as if they had just been caught doing something they’d been trying to hide. Draco didn’t need Legilimency to know the woman’s thoughts. He sharpened his glare, but she merely smiled wickedly in return.
"How?" Malfoy began to stab the rice with the connected set of chopsticks, his furrowed brow, and jutting bottom lip, making him look like a picky child pocking at their vegetables.
Robards waved his hand. “Miss Granger told me. I’m glad you didn’t kill him. I sort of need him.”
Paint me in trust
Harry shook his head profusely. This was why Malfoy wouldn't believe him. Of course, he'd given up on the system. No one gave him a reason to think otherwise. He hated that Malfoy was right. "Where's Robards?"
No matter how Harry was starting to feel, he would stay silent. He had to, even if it hurt. He couldn't scare Draco away. For once, he'd have to demonstrate some sort of restraint.
"I told you so you could relax. You've barely slept. You hardly eat. Please, just wait until after dinner. Take a shower.
Harry lowed his own voice giving a small shrug. "Draco isn't really a muggle name."
room,” Ron amended. “Why was Malfoy in
It wasn’t all bad. Slughorn even allowed them to use the classroom after hours to have a quiet place to study, although Harry noted the professor’s apprehension towards leaving Malfoy alone with him. Thankfully, his Chosen One reputation held enough water that Slughorn gave in. If anyone could handle a surprise attack from a former Death Eater, then it had to be the Boy Who Lived, right?
“Master Harry?” asked the elf as he padded into the room. “Kreacher wasn’t expecting you. Master always goes to Malfoy’s after work now.”
Malfoy showed off one of his famous sneers though it didn't look as arrogant as it once had when they were children. "And why do you think I did anything?"
“Want to go for a walk?”
He dropped back down into his chair. His eyes snapped back to Malfoy, then down to the book he’d been about to open. Harry pushed to the edge of his seat to place his elbow on Malfoy’s chair. “What are you reading?”
Harry shoved the bowl closer. Draco rolled his eyes but took the serving spoon nonetheless. The looks from the other side of the table were noticeable, but neither Ron nor Hermione commented. If Harry hadn’t known better, he might have thought they looked relieved.
Harry felt something trail down to his own chin, but he barely considered it. He reached out to grasp Draco’s face in both of his hands, sweeping his thumbs under the other man’s eyes.
Harry frowned. “I was at Ron’s party.”
“Which is why we’re the only eighth-year prefects.”
Just as he once never thought he could be friends with his childhood nemesis, Harry now never thought he could actually hate him again. Not after he'd seen the excitement in his eyes when Will & Grace came on. Not after he'd seen him laugh at one of Harry's bad jokes. Not after he'd seen him cry when he thought about their past.
“I think you’re stubborn and like to run away from your problems.”
them?" Malfoy repeated. Harry gave a small shrug and nodded, taking another silencing bite of his dinner. He could feel Malfoy's eyes scanning him, even as he tried to focus on the steamed vegetables on his plate. "You mean like a house-elf? What else did they make you do for them?"
Neville was dusting twigs from his hair, his smile stretching from ear to ear. “I can’t believe this was the way to get Malfoy back all those times.”
They rushed to the side, nearly knocking over the healer trying to attend to him. Hermione got there first, taking Harry’s hand in hers. “He’s squeezing my hand, he’s squeezing my hand,” Hermione exclaimed. “Is that good?”
“What!” Draco was on his feet. Horror filling his wide glassy eyes. “I would never!”
“Aye! You’re my help.”
He paused and waited for Draco to say something, anything. Draco wouldn’t even look at him. His eyes were on the carpeted flooring of the hallway, his gaze so far away that it seemed like it was in another world. When he saw he wasn’t going to get anywhere, Ron pushed off the doorframe and stood straight. “Hermione’s at his house now. I need to go back. Please, just think about it.”
"Mistress just wants her house in order," Kreacher spoke up.
When it seemed he could find no clear evidence that he was speaking to an imposter, he spoke again, “Why don’t you ask your Weasel?”
She turned and instinctively began to pat herself down in search of what she might have forgotten ― that was the only reason he would stop her. But Draco had nothing in his hands. He glanced back at the bedroom door and waited for a second, only for silence to greet him in return. He stepped out into the hall and closed the door gently behind him.
Harry had been far too solemn to just be talking about the food. It hadn’t gone unnoticed by Harry that Draco had stepped out of his comfort zone several times in the past two days without a hint of hesitation, and he was doing it all for him. Harry was incredibly grateful. If only he could have focused on that longer.
“What happened to him?” The silence was punctured again by Draco.
“Because I was hoping you’d forget, and
“Actually,” a small squeak came from Draco’s elbow, Professor Flitwick had appeared, likely making sure Draco wasn’t threatening anyone, “Mr. Malfoy has given you quite good advice. Sometimes the most powerful magic comes from a gentle hand.” With a mild wave, icy blue light shimmered out of the professor’s wand followed by a placid stream of water that fell into the bucket they’d been working around.
Malfoy shook his head. "Pansy wouldn't tell anyone."
He yanked the curtains shut again, but Zabini did not coax him with words this time. The light returned almost as quickly as it had vanished, now with the silhouette of the other boy standing in the middle. “Draco.”
Draco had a horrible feeling he did know his stranger better than he thought and had done something to them in the past. It wasn’t farfetched. He used to think himself untouchable with Crabbe and Goyle at his side and his father willing to do just about anything to keep his record clean. His father would always scold him after but it was never the same way he would if he caught Draco reading a muggle book or admitting that muggle-born Granger had done better than him in some class. No, his father’s scoldings when he did something ‘wrong’ were practically encouragement compared to everything else, and above all, at least he didn’t ignore him.
Harry sighed long and hard. He forgot how obstinate the Slytherin could be. He looked around the room; nothing looked out of place as far as he could tell. "Alright, whatever. Just don't go out too much for now, okay?"
Harry’s fingers had stopped moving but they lingered on his arm. Draco didn’t move it, only bowing his head forward instead. He felt so drained. He hadn’t had to be around so many people in a long time. He pressed his forehead against Harry’s shoulder. “Can we leave?” he mumbled quietly. He’d been dying to ask for hours but he didn’t want to ruin Harry’s day.
She gave a little huff but turned away nonetheless. Once the witch was finally gone, Draco brought his eyes back to the letter.
“You haven’t…told anyone, right?” Draco asked carefully. “Not Ron or Hermione?”
Did he not expect Harry to be there? Would he turn around and flee? Was he only coming down to tell him that he and Zabini were together again and he should give up?
Harry dropped down into the matching chair beside him. He leaned forward on his knees in an attempt to get into Malfoy’s eyesight. “Is there another type of pitch I don’t know about?”
It took several reads before Draco processed everything they had said. It felt strange to see his own name written in that sharp, heavy scrawl. It didn’t appear they had made any connections but they did seem strangely paranoid.
When they began to settle, they both picked up their food again to resume eating. The previous tension had lifted. Ron swallowed down a few more chips before speaking again. “I’ll talk to ‘Mione, maybe we can all have dinner or something.”
“Right…”
“You’re absurd,” Malfoy huffed as they walked back to the locker rooms to get cleaned up. Harry needed a shower the most; his pants up to his calves smelling like giant squid.
was Voldemort on the back of Quirrell’s head, and how is it my fault he attacked us?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Please, I just had some extra knowledge. I’m no healer.”
“Luna?” a voice called in a stage whisper, attempting to go unnoticed by Madam Pince. “Luna, where did-” They stopped abruptly as one of the Patil sisters came into view. Her eyes landed on Draco, and in a flash, a scowl formed on her face. “What are you doing talking to him?”
The original sentiment had gotten lost. Hermione and Draco were now debating the historic and spiritual significance of the characters and their connection to the old religion. It was the most Draco had spoken all afternoon.
stunt! We all nearly died, you included.”
Draco snorted.
Harry’s smile brightened, and he bent forward to kiss his cheek. “I love you.”
Harry left Draco in the kitchen with the house-elf to go up to his room. He really shouldn’t call it his room anymore. He hadn’t spent a night there in months. The building still felt cold as he walked through it but it no longer felt like it was out to get him. It was just an empty shell full of good and bad memories alike.
“I, er-” Harry stumbled back into the bedroom. “I’m gonna get dressed.”
A wave of his wand shut off the lights, and he began to get comfortable. “As an apology.”
Hermione, Neville, and Draco hadn’t noticed the conversation in the kitchen as opposed to those who were closer. They were in a heated discussion about a book Neville claimed had misleading title –
Draco finally snapped his gaze up. "Oh, come now, you can't cut the iconic Potter bird's nest. That would be sacrilege."
"Oh," Harry turned back to the files. "That's fine. I won't be here most of the day anyway."
Teddy nodded with his whole body.
"Far from home,
Finally, Harry stepped back. He should have done something else. He wasn't sure what he could have done. Draco's words had just shocked him; they didn't offend him or anything like that. Draco wasn't going to believe that, though. Harry had to continually assure him that he even wanted to be there. He wasn't going to just not overthink something like this.
Zabini nodded slowly. “Yes, that is what I told my mother.”
Draco’s face did not relax, but he finally looked back down to his sketchbook, picking up his pencil again. “When will you stop being so ridiculous?”
Zabini backed away, his head shaking slowly, instincts to retreat outweighing the pride in his eyes. “You have no idea what you’re talking about, Potter.”
The same smile appeared on Draco’s face though there was a glint in his eyes. “You never asked a question.”
The next day, Draco arrived at the library as usual, right after his last class. He was running a little late since he had taken the longer way around from Charms after nearly walking straight through a gaggle of Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors. There was no way he would have made it through without at least one hex thrown at him.
Harry nodded half-heartedly, not looking up. Ron gave him one last odd look. He didn’t know what it was but something felt off.
His eyes went back down to his own portrait, starting to trace up from his own gold thread. He didn’t get far, his gaze catching the dark spot between his mother and Bellatrix. Malfoy knew whose face was supposed to be there without reading the name below it.
Draco turned his head, but Harry could only see a sliver of his eye. Draco studied him for a brief moment before turning his attention back to the tapestry. He traced the gold thread between his own portrait and his parents’ with a feather-light touch. “I love my parents,” his finger followed the ribbon with his father’s name, “but they are the ones who taught me that loving something does not mean I should allow it to hurt me. They tried to teach me arrogance, which they called pride, but what I really learned was respect. I learned what happens when you listen and follow someone who does not have respect for you in return.”
"So, you were their house-elf!"
Longbottom glared at Draco for a second longer, then looked down at the textbook. After a moment, his eyes shot open wide, a small gasp jumping out of his mouth. Without a thought, he snatched up the chopped-up petals Draco had offered and dropped them into the cauldron.
If anything, Draco wished she’d spend less time in the library. She was one of the last people he wanted to notice him. He hoped deep down that Granger, as well as Weasley and Potter, had forgotten about his existence there. If they forgot, then maybe the others would also, and then he’d finally be able to leave the library every once in a while.
“Yes but his counselor makes it sound like he was doing much better at the end,” Hermione urged. “Why would he snap back all of a sudden?”
Once again, Harry’s words had caused everyone to go still. Everyone except for Draco. He was used to hearing these types of thoughts from Harry. It didn’t frighten him or make him feel sad; he just knew he needed help.
Both Ron and Harry frowned. “What is he doing in there?” Ron demanded.
“Sorry I took so long,” said Harry, “I needed to get that last file notarized. Hey, ‘Mione.”
Hermione giggled beneath him and let her arm drape over his chest. “Yes, he’s ours, Malfoy.”
She looked away from the magazines on the coffee table she’d been feigning interest in. When she saw all of the alarmed eyes on her, she raised a brow. “Please, we all see it.” She let out a short, mirthless laugh. “They were holding hands all through lunch.”
Ron and his companion nodded and they shoved Goyle out the door. Robards followed them out, Harry right on his heels. “You know,” Robards said as they walked through the Atrium, “I could fire you for this. Do you know how many regulations you broke by going after someone like this? You’re supposed to be on leave, if something happened-”
There was no way in hell Harry could talk Draco into coming here or even just bring him past. He would have a panic attack just looking at the queue going inside the relatively small building. Harry could go in alone. He wasn't exactly sure what he'd be looking for. Maybe a sign. Perhaps someone who could replace Draco in his dreams.
“Dr… Draco…”
Ron’s mouth dropped open, his eyes bulging as they flicked between the two and finally landed on Harry. “They’re the same person!”
A blister of heat pounded through Harry’s chest. He disregarded magic all together and shoved hard. Zabini stumbled back against the opposite wall. Harry stalked forward. “You got him drunk just so you could use him?”
George nodded heavily, pressing his mouth into a thin line. “Suspected, yeah. You two weren’t very subtle.”
“You bumped into me,” Draco snapped habitually, already seeing the accusation in Potter’s eyes.
And then he came to a stop. He stared.
So many times in the past, he had stood there and stared at that door for hours. He had told himself to get up and go out and not let the world scare him anymore. It seldom worked. It hadn't been until Harry started showing up that he stepped over the threshold without having to spend hours psyching himself up. However, he was pretty sure he had just ruined it.
Harry didn’t notice his own wand slip into his hand, but he held it in a white fist. “Afraid of you?”
Draco’s heart was doing flips as he read the last paragraph.
Draco finally tore his eyes off of their hands to meet the other man’s gaze. His eyes glistened, his grey irises appearing like melted silver. It knocked the breath of Harry’s lungs. “Don’t walk out like that again, please. I don’t have anyone else,” he whimpered. “You, Mother, and Pansy, that’s it. The rest left me or died, and the ones who died probably would have left, too. No one wants to be friends with a Malfoy who’s fallen from grace.”
He heard clinking in the kitchen and walked out of the hallway towards the sound. Malfoy stood over the sink, cleaning up dishes. "It's okay, I just remembered that we're out of clean-" He looked over his shoulder at Harry. "Merlin's beard, Potter!"
Malfoy's legs shook as he made his way out of his bed and out into the hall. He stared at the door, wondering if he'd sufficiently taken up enough time getting there to bore whoever it was so they'd leave.
Harry kept his wand up as he inched closer. “Really? Terry Skeres tells me differently.”
"No, they do, but no one really uses them as names."
“Like I said, you’ve fixed all my problems. I’ve actually been thinking about it for some time. I just assumed you two were already together.” He smiled. “It appears I still have a chance.”
"Yeah, that's it," Harry praised.
Malfoy made a short sound of derision, “Sod off, Potter. You aren’t into blokes. It would ruin your perfect image.”
It didn't help when Harry would just shrug it off either, refusing to even consult a certified healer. He said Draco was better at it anyway. While flattering, it didn't make Draco like it any better.
Thankfully, despite the firm chill in the air, no snow had settled and therefore gave them room outside to for everyone to spread out. Harry got out of Molly’s way in the kitchen and went to join the others. He was delighted to see Draco fitting in well already, stood with Hermione and Audrey likely in some rapt discussion about a book.
When it looked like he had the hang of the movements, Harry let go and sat back. Malfoy's brow was furrowed with intense concentration as he slowly moved his hands towards the food. He opened the chopsticks and managed to pinch them around a piece of chicken.
Harry’s shoulders eased as he realized just how tense he had gotten. “Right, well, I know what it’s like to be without your own.” He tapped lightly at his own wand hanging loosely from his pocket. “Yours wasn’t all that bad though. I think it liked me.”
Draco nodded again, this time faster and with more certainty. He leaned down and closed his agreement with a kiss.
Harry had tried kind gestures the last two times. However, now they knew each other better, and sharp words always worked for them. “Malfoy, get your scaly arse over here.”
Teddy’s small brow furrowed, and Harry could almost see the wheels turning in his head. “Are they good wizards?” Harry’s mouth fell open then closed again like he was a fish out of water. Now he really didn’t know what to say. Teddy continued, “Grandma cried when she got that tea tin. Why would good wizards make her cry?”
They quickly picked up right where the left off before. Harry rolled onto his elbows to hover over Draco, not breaking the heated kiss. Draco’s fingers became twisted in his hair, tugging him closer. Their bare bodies twisted together. As their bodies began to take over, Harry left Draco’s lips to kiss up and down his neck.
“Demeaning manor?” Harry repeated. “You mean
Draco shrugged. "I had to. He was pushing sedation potions on her to ease the pain, but it was only speeding up the processes. Honestly, someone like that shouldn't even be practicing."
His thoughts caught up with his surroundings before he could make a stupid half-asleep mistake. He was in Draco's flat, in Draco's room. He sat up abruptly, looking down with wide eyes at the sleeping man beside him. He wracked his brain, trying to separate his dream from reality.
Hermione sent one glance towards Malfoy, quizzical.
“And your bedhead looks nice.”
“Harry…”
Malfoy would have usually chased him. However, his heart was fluttering far too fast for him to even comprehend standing.
The man who had tormented his family for nearly three years, who had littered his family home with bodies, and who struck fear with his very name was finally dead. It hadn’t been grand. The myth did not match the man. His body had hit the floor like every other person he had killed, feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snake-like face vacant.
“Wait, wait!” Draco urged him. “It’s Pansy.”
Harry shook his head and closed his eyes again. “I’m an idiot.”
“And do you go by Professor Potter-Malfoy?”
Harry scrambled to his feet. "I should go," he muttered. He left his half-eaten plate on the table and was halfway through the apartment by the time Malfoy was able to force his limbs to move.
After breakfast, they returned to the Common Room. Hermione was urging them to start on the homework they had been complaining about the night before, but Harry was still nursing his hangover. He slumped onto one of the couches across from Anthony Goldstein, who was also methodically massaging his temples.
Harry broke away.
Draco gave a short snort. “Yeah, I know, or I wouldn’t have had to heal you again. Honestly, do you know how to not get punched?”
“Why do you need to be nice to the Ferret anyway?” Ron interjected. It earned him a very sharp look from his girlfriend. Ron was quickly on the defensive, “What? Wasn’t he nice enough keeping his family out of Azkaban?”
She pulled her head back into the house and went back to the counter, muttering to her daughter about the men in the family. Ginny hummed and nodded along.
“No one’s blaming them for everything, Harry,” Hermione urged. “We supported you in helping them. Narcissa helped you, and they wouldn’t have been safe in Azkaban with everyone else who had been convicted.”
Harry returned his glasses to his nose to examine Draco’s face. He wasn’t as good at reading features as Slytherins—or Hermione—but he could sense genuine concern. Could he manage a lie? Maybe not a full truth. “Sorry,” he muttered and dropped onto the edge of the bed, finding some interest in the sheets. “I’ve just been thinking about some things.”
Robards assessed his sincerity for a long moment before finally giving a stiff nod. He wordlessly gestured to the chair in front of his desk.  Harry sat down.
Dumbledore was an idiot. He was a horrible, absurd man. And yet, Draco had seen the urgency in the Dark Lord’s eyes when he tasked Draco with killing Dumbledore. If the headmaster was such a fool, then why was the Dark Lord so afraid of him?
“You’re whimpering isn’t what woke me up, Potter,” Malfoy said shortly. Harry was so knotted up from his nightmare that he would have likely snapped had Malfoy not gone on, “I already told you. I get them too.”
When this didn’t persuade Pansy anymore, Draco groaned. “Just try it.”
The moment he was out of Zabini’s sight, Draco felt the atmosphere loosen. He began to sway as if the pressure he had just been under had been what was holding him up. His eyes darted in the direction of Harry’s room. Could this wait? Should this wait?
“Why does it matter?” Malfoy answered Harry’s half question with his own.
Using all of the willpower he could muster, he leaned his head back to put at least a little distance between them. “That means we have to move.”
"Okay, well, pick one for dinner tonight," Harry suggested, mildly amused by Malfoy's sudden spark of interest.
She stood up. “Ronald,” she pressed harder. “I know you don’t like it, I don’t either, but he needs him. Harry’s never even told us he has,” she gestured to Kreacher, not sure if the word he used was right but not knowing a better one, “fits. He needs help, and we aren’t enough. Ron, don’t walk away from me!”
Hermione straightened and for a moment it looked like she was going to jump up and give him Draco a hug as well. She shifted in her seat, debating if it was called for or not. As Draco eased into the room, she decided to stay seated but the concern remained on her features. “We came to check on both of you,” she said. “How are you, Draco?”
Harry retorted almost on instinct. “I could ask you the same thing.”
“You’re a saint, ‘Mione!” was all that Harry got out as he flew past her and the unlocked Common Room door, not having to waste his time with a password.
Harry chuckled and saw Ron give a faintly amused eye roll. “Yeah, Healer Sow just told me. They’re getting the paperwork ready now.”
“Okay, let me have it,” Harry sighed.
Harry lifted his chin. “I considered it. No one would look into it though and from what I could find, no one in Public Records brought up any red flags. None of them had any direct connection to the Malfoys or deaths in the family during the war.”
A low laugh fell out of Zabini’s mouth. “I don’t know what he’s been telling you, but I was never the one who had to bend over.”
“But if you wanted to, you could, even from Public Records?” Harry questioned.
“I asked Harry not to tell anyone,” Draco spoke up. He didn’t want to get Harry’s best friend even more upset with him. “I didn’t want people like Macnair finding out.”
Harry smiled at this. He had known how hard it was for Draco to do such a thing in front of him. It wasn’t like flying. It wasn’t meant to be something to be shown off. Sketching was how he turned off his busy thoughts and let some of the walls of his compartmentalized brain fall. He trusted Harry enough to be around as he did it.
She pursed her lips, considering a retort but deciding against it. She fixed her bag on her shoulder and unnecessarily patted down her brown business robes. “I’ll be off then.”
The conversation went on to talk about the events of the previous year. There were many heavy parts, and Harry did not mind when Draco’s fingers began to dig into his trousers to keep from caving in on themselves, nor did he comment when he took a swig of whisky. No one was comfortable remembering the screams of the children being tortured. The Carrows were embedded deeper into everyone’s mind than Voldemort, although they appeared to equally horrify Draco.
“Oh Harry, you’re supposed to sit at the end so everyone can see you,” said Molly. Harry looked between the empty chair and Draco beside him. It seemed an awkward distance away and he didn’t want to give up his current spot to anyone who would make Draco uncomfortable.
Harry snapped his eyes back up to the redhead. “He won’t hurt me.” Ron scoffed and looked away but said nothing more, feeling Hermione’s quelling gaze.
This couldn’t be happening. This couldn’t be how it ended. He didn’t even get the chance to explain. He didn’t even get the chance to try.
“No, no,” Draco shook his head violently, “that’s not what I meant. I mean, we can’t do this,” Harry still appeared confused, “at all!”
“You both come down here, too?” Harry asked as he automatically sat beside Malfoy.
Draco’s jaw became slack. Harry quickly looked away returning to tracing the dark mark. “I’ve always wanted a home, an actual home. Not a townhouse, not a flat, not a cookie cut suburban. A home,” a ghostly smile flitted across his face like was thinking back on a memory, “cluttered and lived in with a garden and trees.” The memory appeared to sour as he realized it was a dream, not a reality. “It’s all I’ve ever wanted.”
Cobris stepped forward. “Look, mate, I have a cousin who was put under a love potion. Nasty stuff that is. You don’t know it’s happening though. He swore up and down that he was fine until we forced him to St. Mungo’s.”
“Yes, you have.”
The rustling of the bag brought Harry's attention back.  Malfoy had picked up the takeaway and was glaring mildly at Harry even as he said, "Well do you want to eat inside then? It's the least you could do really, you always bring so much. How much do you think I can eat?"
“Wizarding or muggle?”
I just want to say that I love Ron. It always bothers me when writers make him into such a jerk about Draco and Harry's relationship to the point where I stop reading sometimes. That isn't what's happening here. People are still bitter about the war. There is bound to be tension, and it has to be worked through before anyone can move forward.
What really threw Draco off kilter was Harry’s last, uncertain attempt one day. After work he took a shower as usual only when he emerged from the bedroom, he only had a towel around his waist. Harry caught how wide Draco’s eyes had become and Draco mentally cursed at his own legs as they became jelly. He grabbed the counter to steady himself, deciding not to finish walking to the sofa as he planned. “Wh- What are you doing?” Draco tried to keep his voice level. He barely managed to keep from stumbling over his whole sentence.
Draco yanked his hand away. “What? No! That’s stupid.” He started to get to his feet again. “Why would I think that?”
“And that’s been part of his whole life. He’s never had a single break. What if he just doesn’t know how? What if when he finally does take a break, it’s permanent.”
Malfoy’s mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water until he finally settled on, “And that doesn’t bother you?”
"I hate you," Malfoy said as meticulously as possible, but there was absolutely no malice in his tone. And, the longer he stared at Harry's smile, the harder it was for him to resist the one growing on his own lips.
Harry's regular voice returned with one last gargle of his throat, and he began to explain. "My aunt and uncle hate magic." Malfoy straightened like a board. "They don't care much for anyone who practices it either ― me included."
"I thought you said you don't leave the apartment much. How do you eat if you don't even know how to cook?" Harry's eyes feel to Malfoy's body, and it answered his question for him.
Draco crossed his arms. "I think I have a pretty good guess at the very least."
Harry got up a few steps before Malfoy was up on both feet. The words flew out of his mouth in a rush, desperate to call Harry down, “I don’t want to be there because he’s not alone.”
“He’s not all that used to people being genuine.”
In an instant, Draco’s face blossomed pink. He twisted his face into a sneer and attempted to ignore his pounding heart as he started to beat the pillow under his head into softness. “You’re ridiculous.”
Somehow, Harry couldn't imagine a set of parents not getting along. He was fortunate in that area, at least. Even Vernon and Petunia had always functioned as a cohesive unit.
“What’s going on?” Ron questioned.
so much?” Draco asked, likely intending it to be conversational. Harry’s answer cut off the head of any casual discussion.
Nonetheless, he continued to tug Draco into the other room. No one was there as expected. They sat on the sofa together. “Now what is it that has you pulling me around?” Draco demanded once they were finally still.
"Or I will," Harry sighed.
Harry’s furious gaze landed on Malfoy, and he took a threatening step forward. “Leave,” he thundered.
The silence that followed was all-consuming. Harry was still rather deep in thought, and he could feel both of his friends watching him. Finally, he looked up again. “But the rest of it, you’re both okay with?”
Narcissa kept her eyes forward. Her mouth became thin. “He can be a harsh man. Draco has a tendency to be overzealous when trying to impress him. He is one of Draco most avid supporters but also his greatest critic. That’s how all parents are though, aren’t they?”
Ron smiled at this but it only lasted a moment. “But, you did actually like my sister. You weren’t just using her.”
Harry had to forcefully resist opening his mouth to call for help. He knew it wasn’t real, but his body trembled nonetheless. He clutched at the front of his uniform, pressing the metal buttons into his palm, desperately hoping the cold metal would replace the ghostly memory of a limp elf body in his hands.
“I wasn’t!”
“How’d you know that?”
Draco didn’t want to mention losing. He didn’t want to say that for so long he would give anything not to lose just because he was terrified of his family’s fate if they did. He never thought the Ministry would think Azkaban would be good enough for everything they helped cause. Surely his mother, father, and self would be given a Dementor’s kiss.
A slow-growing smile lit Harry’s face one more. He started to come up with some witty response when it all abruptly fell away.
Malfoy got up as well, reaching desperately for Harry. Malfoy could feel his chest beginning to tighten already. He wasn't sure what line he'd crossed, but he couldn't let Harry leave like this. "Wait, Potter," he pled. "Please, don't go."
In the end, he took Hermione's advice and attempted to improve his lot. He gave the elf a room of its own, though he rarely spent much time there, and an allowance that Harry was pretty sure he just used for groceries. Nevertheless, he did seem a lot happier.
“That’s very good,” said the middle-aged witch on the other side of the cot. She hovered her wand over his head, the end budding a small, white light. “Hello, Mr. Potter. Can you hear me? Do you know what happened to you?”
Draco’s hands slid over Harry’s chest. He gave it a soft push and Harry moved with it, allowing him to move them backwards. Harry soon felt the bed just below the back of his knee. Draco’s hands moved down, beginning to tug on the bottom of his shirt.
No sooner had Harry trekked up to his bedroom - the same one he and Ron had shared once upon a time - and slumped onto his bed, then did his brain cells unanimously chant "Fuck it," and he went down to the kitchen.
Draco noted the rush in the person’s scrawl at the last sentence as if they were scared of offending. He barely noticed any insult, too busy worrying his lip over the mention of the Battle of Hogwarts.
Draco sighed like it was the most annoying thing he had ever been asked to do in his life. "Yes, Potter, I'll be an anonymous informant."
Narcissa’s instinct was to argue but her eyes flickered to Harry. She supposed that wasn’t a lie anymore. He did appear to be okay now.
"Knowing you, you probably did without knowing it."
Draco poked only one eye out from under the covers. Harry was sure that if Draco was any good at wordless, wandless magic, Ron would turn into stone. He might have even been near to making a breakthrough in his abilities if not for hearing Harry’s snort.
They watched as the head of the Auror Office swept down the hall. Even exhausted, he looked like a force to be reckoned with.
Harry couldn’t find voice to answer that. He opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water.
Harry turned towards him, one hand going to Draco’s knee as if gently urging him to remain still. “I just need you to know that I care about you, and I’m not going to let what others think change that.”
He nearly wanted to jump up and hug Professor Vector when she let them all out early for the day. Instead, he saved the energy to bolt for the door.
That was her fear. Normal Harry didn’t equate to a healthy Harry.
Harry would like to say he was surprised to see someone else was up but most of the eighth-years were apart of Dumbledore’s Army and all but two had been present for the Battle of Hogwarts. Lack of sleep could not be exclusive to the trio.
Anyone not already at the table began to migrate over. Molly, Charlie, and Ginny started to levitate at least three dishes each ahead of themselves.
“Then be quiet.”
George raised his brows. “You haven’t read it?”
Teddy nodded enthusiastically not unlike Draco had seen him do several times when talking to Harry.
It would be easy to act like he didn’t. Only, that was a lie, and lying to Malfoy just felt wrong now. It was strange but true. Besides, it wasn’t as if he had said anything especially embarrassing. It hadn’t been much worse than anything he had said to Ron or Hermione before. They were both well aware of his affinity to compliment or cling when he had too much. Ron would typically spend the following week repeating whatever he said simply to torment him. Malfoy doing that wouldn’t be a big deal.
Draco took a step forward.
Harry’s shoulders fell, his thought of retaliation dissipating. He hadn’t even considered how hard it was for Malfoy to sleep before waking him up. “Sorry about that.”
He could see the outline of Draco’s form. The longer he stared into the darkness, the more his features began to come into definition. He focused on his lips. Was it so bad that he wanted to be able to kiss him? “Everyone knows.”

Nonetheless, he wouldn’t turn down her company. With his hand still in hers, he turned his head back towards Draco. “So, does this mean you’re some big shot healer now?”
,” Malfoy mocked.
“Nothing happened other than us finding who’s been leaking all of our information the media.” Harry patted his boss’s back with a mocking smirk. “I’ll even let you take some of the credit.”
Without waiting for her to make a decision, he marched out of the room. Harry could see that she was going to try to talk him back, but there was no point. He reached for her hand, slowing her. “It’s okay, ‘Mione,” he assured. “You tried.”
Neville only continued to chuckle, waving back over his shoulder as he kept walking.
Malfoy tore his gaze away in favor of glaring at the lesson plan on the chalkboard. “It doesn’t matter.”
The laugh which issued out of Harry’s lips startled Draco. He frowned. “Why are you laughing at me?”
Draco’s eyes slanted towards him. “What about the Weaselette?”
The years must have begun to give him some amount of wit because he instantly tried to throw the door open again. Harry was faster. He pulled out his wand and sealed the door with a wordless spell. It snapped shut with a loud bang. Lenny yelped and jumped away from Harry.
Never one to ignore a mystery, Harry stood up.
Harry stood, taking both of Draco’s hands before he could stumble away. “I’m saying these things because they’re true. You can trust me, Draco. I would never intentionally hurt you.”
“Ginny? We decided to keep our breakup permanent after all the battle highs wore off. She’s not really in a good place to be dating, and I… I didn’t know what I wanted.”
“Yeah, right, sure.”
"I'll admit," Malfoy left the counter across from Harry to pull something out of the cupboard, "I've fallen asleep on that sofa more than once." He came back, placing a bottle of honey between them. "It's no four-poster king, but it's certainly comfortable. If you ever have trouble sleeping at home, you're certainly welcome to it." He began to pour the honey into one of the cups, slowly stirring in the sweetener.
Harry was trembling from head to toe. His wand was held only inches from Zabini’s eye. “It doesn’t matter what he thinks of me,” Harry’s voice shook. “If I’m not the one he wants, then fine, but
"Why don't you peruse it?"
“You were there, too,” Terry spoke up. “You didn’t enjoy it. We could all tell. You weren’t like Crabbe and Goyle and some of the others.”
“Well, I was only really keeping it from Zabini and your friends,” Malfoy dropped onto his usual bed. “Besides, it doesn’t matter what others assume, right?”
Harry froze in the doorway to consider Draco’s question. Harry could still remember the look on Ron’s face from the day before. He didn’t think he could keep this from him now. “Define anyone? The Weasleys already assume, what’s the harm in telling them?”
Ron looked utterly offended. "Yes, Harry, believe it or not, I do know how to do my job." Harry opened his mouth to apologize, but Ron went on. "I might not catch as many big fish as you do, but I do know what I'm doing – without forgetting procedure. He's doing mandatory counseling like everyone else we've found in similar situations. Is that sufficient for you?"
There was a decent-sized line outside for a Thursday night. This muggle club always drew an impressive crowd, especially since it consisted only of blokes. Occasionally they'd have big events, and the line to get in would wrap around the block. Harry didn't think there were that many gay men in England, let alone just in London.
Except for the slap across the face their third year, Granger was not one who was quick to physical violence. She didn’t appear angry, only a bit uncomfortable. She wasn’t harmless ― certainly not ― but she was at least not meaning harm at the moment.
"Because I'm the poster boy for Death Eaters," Malfoy snapped. "If it's not the Dark Lord himself, then they picture my family and me. People are furious that I got off."
“What’s this?” Pansy inquired as they cleared off the table. She had picked up one of the Macnair case files, beginning to flip through it.
Harry was going to agree, but he could feel his eyes begin to burn. He was on the ground, his back pushed up against his bed, but he still felt vulnerable. He knew what he really wanted more than anything.
She twitched a single brow. “Yes, that is what I assumed I was doing. I think you are certainly qualified to do so.”
"You know what, this is comfortable," Harry claimed. "I think I'll watch some shows like this." He tried to reach the coffee table for the remote but ultimately had to sit up briefly to get it. Malfoy took the advantage and sprung up as well.
“We could leave them,” Harry suggested. He noted the frown on Hermione’s face behind Malfoy and wrinkled his nose only slightly, hoping she got the message.
Harry also managed to start talking Draco into coming with him, Ron, and Hermione to Hogesmede on Saturdays. They typically ended up at the Hogshead. At least Ron and Harry could be entertained with pub games and leave Draco and Hermione to nerd out about whatever new magical theory of the week.
“I wouldn’t call me his favorite. He’d actually raised me only so that Voldemort could kill me at the right time.”
“Come on.” Hermione looped her arm with his. “The others are waiting too. Neville just got here as well. We’re only waiting for Dean, Seamus, and Andromeda now. Luna might be coming also but her response was sort of vague.”
"You cooked
want me?”
Harry shrugged. “I have a little at Grimmauld every once in a while, but it’s never much. I just haven’t felt the urge to lately. I told them it was ridiculous.”
Harry did not look at him. He pressed his lips into a firm line and started to toss the snitch again.
“I love you,” Harry said in a rush before he could be cut off again. “I love you,” he said again, louder. “If you don’t feel the same, fine, but I need you to know how I feel. I need you to know that you are capable of being loved.”
If those words had not been a confession, then Harry was not sure what could be counted as one. Nevertheless, Draco’s brows pulled together, and he shook his head so minutely that it likely would have gone unnoticed by anyone other than Harry. “I don’t care what others think,” Draco said. “But I can’t tell what you’re thinking. Everything you just said could be a lie.”
This was the first time in ages he was leaving the house without Harry at his side. Not only that, but he was going to a high-traffic, wizarding place. People would certainly recognize him. People would undoubtedly hate him.
Malfoy watched the other man's face, seeing as it grimaced at distant thoughts. He had a feeling he knew what Harry meant. It once took copious amounts of sleeping draught to keep him in bed at night though he had run out of the ingredients for it ages ago ― it's what he'd been trying to make on his dresser.
He looked like he was about to keep talking but Harry couldn’t restrain himself anymore. He caught Draco’s lips with his own; and, like tasting the fruit of one’s labor, it was the sweetest kiss he’d ever tasted.
It wasn’t long before no one could muster out another grueling account. Lighter tales began to blossom and prosper. There was never any truly joyful moments to recall, but they did talk about their minor wins, the way the professors were silently supporting them, how the ghost and portraits had aided in reconnaissance. There had been a lot of turmoil, but they had overcome all of it in leaps and bounds.
"I haven't learned anything new in a while," Malfoy admitted after succeeding in getting a piece of vegetable in his mouth. "I've kind of missed it."
“We’re fourteen; we can go where we want!”
When they watched
For Pansy being so against coming to the muggle café, she was incredibly reluctant to leave. When they finally got her out, they went back to the flat. It was decided that they’d play a three-person game of exploding snap ― a dangerous proposition since it only added to the chances of cards exploding, but it also added to the excitement.
Upon returning to Hogwarts, Draco had made a promise to himself that he would keep his head low and devote himself to his studies. That was his only purpose for being there after all. And he had kept this promise for nearly a month. So much so that he rarely left the library and he was already beginning to read ahead of lesson plans.
Harry’s heart was pounding through his chest. A warm feeling spread over his whole body, but all he could do to show it was smile. “Yeah, yeah, that helps a lot.”
“Who?” Ron demanded. Harry couldn’t make his mouth work, floundering for any bit of sense. Ron’s eyes narrowed. “It’s Charlie, isn’t it? You’re always staring at him.”
There was something challenging in Malfoy’s hard eyes. A silent taunt of, “Prove me wrong.” Harry might have recently been trying to get past their childish feud but it wasn’t that long ago that they were trying to kill each other. Getting under each other’s skin was simply second nature and they would both say or do whatever was necessary to do that.
Malfoy nodded and raked a hand through his hair. “I know. It’s confusing me, too. He’s never really been one to be petty before.”
Who was the real him? He couldn’t answer that before, but now he was beginning to know that person. He was the one who doodled birds and flowers in the margins of his notes. He was the one who made paper cranes that could fly as high as he wished he could. He was the one who wrote all of these notes and sent them off to Wonderland. And, that was the person that his stranger liked, the real him.
It wasn’t just the better sleeping that was hard to give up, though. He also liked waking up to Malfoy making them tea on the weekdays, or Harry spending the time on the weekend to make them breakfast, or watching the news together as a learning source to teach Malfoy about muggles. Above all, he would miss just having someone he always knew was around ― someone to come home to and who could easily distract him from his workday.
Malfoy’s eyes flitted from the floor to the wall as if suddenly now deciding to admire the architecture of the castle. “You really don’t want anything from me?”
His heart skipped a beat.
No one else would expect to see Sirius Black sitting at the end of the long dining room table reading the Daily Prophet as Remus Lupin handed him a cup of coffee. They wouldn't be on alert for Fred and George Weasley to take advantage of reaching the age of seventeen and running amuck with 'perfectly legal' magic or using their experimental Weasley's Wizard Wheeze products on unsuspecting bystanders. They wouldn't stop and think the low thud of the furnace on cold nights was Alastor Moody's wooden leg hobbling through the house, arriving with news. They wouldn't pause at one of the closed doors and think that Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, and the rest of the senior members of the Order of the Phoenix were on the other side having a meeting he wasn't supposed to walk in on. No, this place would be a blessing to them, not the constant nightmare it was for Harry.
The house-elf bowed his head and got to work.
Her original intentions faded as she looked around. Everything was so white and modern. So un-Malfoy-like. Her eyes lingered on the only door in the hall. “One bedroom?”
He threw down enough for the tab and a tip, then slid off the barstool. He wobbled a little and had to grasp the counter to get his bearings. The sharp jolt in his thigh told him that his lack of coordination hadn't been from the drinking, though the bartender gave him an apprehensive look. He'd gotten into a bit of a scrap with their suspect that day, but he didn't bother going to the infirmary. He'd gotten hit with far worse before. It was likely just a pulled muscle.
Draco's eyes flared, but the redness of his cheeks began to spread to his ears and neck. "If you're referring to that ruddy hippogriff, you know full well that it could have killed me."
All of the tension he hadn’t realized had been balling up into his shoulders suddenly fell. He toed off his shoes at the foot of the bed, then launched himself onto the empty spot. Draco didn’t even look up from his book, turning the page before speaking, “How was it?”
He couldn’t help but wonder if anyone else had ever touched it before besides Harry, himself. Was it another thing that only Draco was privy to, like seeing him in the morning without glasses? Ron and his other roommates from Hogwarts had likely seen that before. But had anyone else woken up to it beside them? Maybe the Weasley girl. Had she touched his scar as well?
He would likely kill for a vial of Dreamless Sleep right about now.
Harry’s smile stretched into a face-cracking grin. “Was that better?”
Draco had always felt so much hatred towards the Weasleys. He hated their red hair and their hand-me-down robes. He hated how loved they must have felt growing up.
Malfoy held up his arms, pulling his knees closer to block his body. "No, no, tell me," he was barely speaking, laughter falling out of his lips instead. "I like hearing about you not being good at something."
Passing the club was really the most interesting part of his nights. After work, he'd shed off his robes, take a shower, dress into muggle clothes, and go to the bar until he was intoxicated enough that he hoped he'd get a good nights' rest.
“Apparently I do because I keep coming back for more.”
There was no way he couldn’t feel Harry staring. Harry could certainly feel Hermione’s flickering glances. Stubborn git.
Something cold and deep shook through Harry. So many times, he’d thought of dying but never of the funeral, never of what would happen after and who he would leave behind. Why had he been so stupid? He always knew he was capable of hurting the people around him, but he never considered that he could hurt them by not being around.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Idiot,” he said in the most loving way humanly possible.
I know you said that you'd give me another chance
Gradually, Draco began to ease into at least a slight degree of calm. Just as he began to lean more into Harry there was as sharp knock on the door.
“Hermione!”
Harry surveyed the room for any other occupants but found none. “I was looking for someone, Greggory Goyle?”
To Harry’s surprise, a smile crooked his mouth though it did not meet his dull eyes. “I’m fine, Harry. I just needed some time to myself.” He finally turned around to face him. “Back to the Common Room, yes?”
“Oh, er-” Draco stood in the doorway like a deer in headlights. He was debating whether to simply do an about-face and leave without a word or try to power through. Mid-decision, he noticed the sympathy in Harry’s eyes.
He gestured to the room. “Send an owl if anything changes. I’ll deal with the minister and the press.”
Harry sighed by took the mug nonetheless. He stepped to the side so he wouldn’t risk spilling the hot liquid on Draco but maintained a hand on the small of his back. They sipped quietly together. The only sound was the chirping of birds outside the kitchen window and the crackle of the fading fire in the other room.
That appeared to silence the pair. They climbed the steps of the passage into Diagon Alley. “See you later, Piggy Potter,” said Eve in a singsong voice as they passed her on the corner. Don’t forget about my offer.”
"Has Master had lunch? Kreacher can make-"
“I can reasonably classify that as family,” she said. “Besides, my shift is ending soon, and I would feel a lot better if I knew someone was here who won’t give in to your complaining.” She jabbed an accusatory finger in Harry’s direction.
“We heard,” said Ron. He could still recall the drop in temperature in the room when they had heard it over the wireless. It was as if a dementor had floated into the burrow. Kingsley was midsentence when there was suddenly a fuss behind the scenes, then someone had said a little too loudly, “Potter’s at Mungo’s.”
"You said it yourself, Harry. There's no such thing as an ex-Death Eater, just one's that were too slippery to be caught."
He shook his head sharply, side to side. “I don’t believe you.”
As Andromeda had said, the whole Weasley clan was there, even Percy. The one who wasn’t present was Ginny ― thankfully though not surprisingly. Harry was pretty sure he had heard that the Harpies had a game this weekend. A few former Order members like Hestia Jones, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, even Angelina Johnson, were also there.
Draco was maintaining a narrow-eyed glare on Harry as he grumbled, "Yeah, because it's not my name."
"Then why-"
His gaze became glazed and distant. "If I hadn't healed half of those people who showed up at the manor, a lot of other people wouldn't have been killed. I saved lives but only so they could take another. I’m sure a lot of your friends died that day because of what I did.”
“Yes, and?”
, perse. I was just sort of expected to figure it out. My aunt showed me a few of her favorite recipes when I got old enough to handle them."
Draco became flushed. It increased when she gave him a tight squeeze – for once not fearing that she might break her own son. It was a longer hug than she normal gave. Draco had to be the one to finally pull away. “Please, come in.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Thank you, Potter. I’m glad I’m not ‘terribly’ bad.”
That had been a mistake. Harry knew it had been. He had promised himself that he’d wait, that he wouldn’t push. Draco had already given him a second chance; there was no way he would get a third. He had just ruined everything.
Dozing off right then would be easy. Harry might have done so had he been with Ron or Hermione; however, it seemed like such a waste. Curiosity pricking at his chest, he opened his eyes just enough to peer up through his eyelashes. With dark feathers around the frame of his gaze like a dream, and sunlight filtering down through the sparse leaves, he watched Draco. He watched the crease form in his brow when focusing on a detail. He watched him stop altogether and stare blankly at the sheet for several long moments. He watched his eyes sparkle when the image started to come together. He even watched the way his hand moved, all muscle and tendons and yet as smooth and white as the finest marble.
Harry reached forward and took one of Draco’s trembling hands from a styrofoam box, earning Draco’s gaze. “Thank you.”
He started towards the door, grabbing his cloak off the hook. Draco followed. “You promised you’d stay with me!”
When Harry went for another attack, Draco ducked out of the way and grabbed his own pillow. It wasn’t long before they were in an all-out war that spread even to his own bed. It turned out that the Hogwarts pillows were feather fluffed and were capable of making quite the mess.
A smile split across Harry’s lips. He pulled on their connected hands, leading Draco forward as he leaned down. “I love you,” he hummed, pleased by how his tenderness made Draco light up like a tomato.
He dropped down into his chair, continuing to sort things out. “I’ll let him know.”
“I can’t believe we’ve been missing this,” added her sister.
The next morning, Draco woke up to find the spot beside him empty. He wasn't surprised, but he was disappointed. The bed felt unnaturally cold when he was alone.
“No, you’re just going to go out to get more liquor, and that isn’t going to help you either.”
He glanced up at the apartment. The light inside against the growing night provided the perfect spotlight into Malfoy's living room. It looked like Malfoy was reading on his couch.
"When is his trial?"
"You aren't getting out of a meal because you feel like being a hero," Draco insisted.
Harry sighed as he pushed off the dresser. He knelt onto the bed, moving close enough to hold Draco’s face in both of his hands. “Not everyone’s first instinct his revenge,” he said softly and pressed a gentle peck to Draco’s lips. “They’re my friends. I trust them all with my life, I
A slow, almost Cheshire-like grin broke out across Harry’s face. “You’re still
Draco’s breath picked up. His eyes were covered with shimmering glass. He was trying so hard to keep his emotions in check.
When they first arrived in France, they spent the first few days at Lorena’s townhouse in Versailles to visit Narcissa. Harry didn't know what to think of Lorena at first. She seemed just as cold and severe as Narcissa. They even seemed to have similar thin features which made Harry think they were related in some way. Their differences started with Lorena’s dark, pixie haircut and ended at Lorena’s acidic wit and unfaltering innuendos. It was like meeting an older Pansy Parkinson.
Harry took his warning seriously. There were several muggle cleaning supplies that ended in disaster if they were mixed, he couldn’t imagine what magical ones would do. He stopped trying to fire at Goyle and instead began throwing up shields to protect the supplies.
The group of Aurors crowded around a desk quickly jumped apart. Cobris shunted paper behind his back. Harry narrowed his eyes. The mass of witches and wizards shifted uncomfortably under his gaze.
He knew the answer. Because it was Draco. He didn’t lie to Draco, not anymore. He had asked him a question, and Harry had answered the only way he knew how.
Sometimes he thought he was really getting to understand Malfoy, and then he would do something that threw it all out of whack again. Why wouldn’t he even look at him?
"Because he is! That's why I testified for him."
Harry’s whole body went rigid. He stared at Ron through wide eyes and a gaping mouth. However, thinking back, he couldn’t act as though he’d been particularly careful. Maybe he’d been partially hoping someone would pick up on it, just to gage their reaction. He slowly closed his mouth again and swallowed. “What- How do they feel about it?”
He tried to let go of Teddy but the child clung on tighter. Harry had to forcefully push him off with his other hand. Seeing the pain in his godson’s eyes, he tried to ease the emotional blow by running a hand over his head. “I’ll be back. Stay with your grandmother.”
A warm wash fell over his body. Harry meant to say he didn’t know what he was talking about, but lying to Draco was far too difficult. All he could manage was opening and closing his mouth.
“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of the cubicles. “Don’t… Tell me what’s wrong… I can help you...”
He lowered his voice again. “I don’t know. I just don’t want him to hate me again.”
“Almost never anymore since my boss told her off for distracting his employees,” Heather piped in, sliding a look at the woman.
"Good," Robards looked back down. "I need those reports from the Knox case on my desk by this evening, and I don't trust Weasley to stay concentrated for that long. You either, if I'm honest, but two heads are better than one."
Malfoy released his wrist momentarily. Although Harry did not remove his hand, his eyes watched very closely as Malfoy began to pull up on his left sleeve. Malfoy took the hand once more, and Harry flinched when his fingers glided over the dark mark on his wrist. The skin was smooth. The ink was faded as if worn from many years in the sun and not only two years old.
No one expected the honest answer which came out of Malfoy’s mouth. “He keeps trying to touch my hair.”
Malfoy’s brow bunched together. He dropped his eyes to the book once more and then ticked a glance at Harry out of the corner of his eye. “To do what?”
Harry flinched at his bright voice. “Hey, Dennis.” He didn’t wait around to see if the boy had anything else to say, afraid that others would flock him if they thought he was in a chatty mood. He’d been caught by that more than once.
He was still thinking about it when he got to work Monday. Thankfully, he and Ron were sent out for patrol duty which didn’t require much concentration.
Draco was a bit stilted by hearing his given name from Hermione Granger as well as the worry on her face. He stepped slowly towards the table, hesitating behind the chair beside Harry. “I’m okay. I haven’t had to deal with it as much as…” He trailed off, his gaze falling to Harry.
Andromeda laughed at the long sigh that left the man’s lips. “Yes, I have a few upstairs. I’ll show you.”
Many heads turned. It was a common effect whenever Harry went anywhere with high wizard traffic. It was the main reason he stopped coming to Diagon Alley or the Leaky Cauldron unless he absolutely needed to. However, usually when people looked at him it was with awe and gratitude. Now he received scornful looks. Parents with their young children quickly tugged them away. Elderly witches and wizards glared without mercy.
Heather’s brow crinkled. “You mean our most popular?”
“If that will get you there, then yes,” she said to Draco as if he’d been the one to ask. “I miss my son. I don’t like thinking about you all alone in this apartment.”
“Night, ‘Mione.”
They spoke for a while longer. Draco stayed silent for most of it, remaining leaned against the other side of the cot.
Malfoy swallowed hard, trying to bottle up as much courage as he could. He crossed his arms, picking at his sleeve under his folded arms as he tried to appear calm. "Actually," he leaned his hip against the counter, looking down at the menus as well, "that café looked really nice. I wouldn't mind that." As much as he didn't like leaving the flat, he would much rather take his chances outside to spend time with Harry than sit around by himself.
She offered her hand, which he shook. "Nice to meet you. I'm Harry." After introducing himself, Harry gestured to Draco, "And that's Dra…ay?" He barely stopped himself, his eyes going wide as a realization occurred.
Hermione and Ron shared one of their measured knowing looks. The one that always made Harry feel like a child whose parents’ talked with heavy concern behind his back.
Heather was his ultimate rescue. She appeared with their orders, handing the boys their usuals and placing something with an extra amount of cream and a fancy chocolate drizzle in front of Pansy.
“Why didn’t you come sit with us?”
She waved a dismissive hand. “I won’t, I won’t.” Her eyes skimmed over the apartment. “Honestly, I might try to beg him to stay, myself, if he ever considers leaving.” She turned her scrutinizing gaze to Draco. “You actually look healthy. If I knew getting you a boyfriend would help you this much, then I’d have found you one ages ago.”
Harry’s body ran cold, his eyes darted to Draco. However, he did not find what he expected. Draco’s cheeks were flushed, but it was difficult to tell if it was from embarrassment or the steady drinking. Harry hadn’t been keeping track of him. “No, I still hate him,” Draco hummed.
“He wanted to talk to me about you.”
Malfoy rolled over and elbowed Harry’s chest until he finally sat up again. Air gushed out of Malfoy’s clenched teeth as he sat up as well, pushing his back up against the headboard. “Really can’t handle the idea of someone ignoring you, can you?”
He didn’t even make it to his usual seat before he opened the book.
For a flash, he got his hopes up and thought it was Harry.
“Does it really say that in there?” Harry snapped.
Harry turned away, staggering towards the sitting room. “It doesn’t matter how.”
When he got into a view, they found another person with him. Pansy stood with a quill and a pad of paper in her hand, a firm glare in her eyes.
Harry had heard Hufflepuffs speaking of the great advice Cedric Diggory gave in their common room as well as more than few prank ideas that had come from the metamorphmagus in the portrait beside him. All of the portraits shuttered when she and Fred Weasley from the Gryffindor common room spent any amount of time together. McGonagall threatened to close up passage between portraits after the great portrait prank wars of 2002 when after Marauders had been immortalized in their own portrait together.
Ron shrugged, but there was still an amused light to his eyes.
The faces around him were too stunned to give a response, including Malfoy. Harry took the opportunity to grab his wrist and pull him away. “Come on. We’ll be late for Charms.”
Draco stood from the sofa, his eyes scanning Harry's body up and down for any wounds. The other man stomped back to the dining table, throwing his bag down so hard that they were liable to get a complaint from downstairs.
Harry began to shove Malfoy out, but the yelp of pain that came from the other man made Harry recoil. His breathing began to worsen again as he looked down in horror at where he’d grasped Malfoy’s arm.
“Draco and I are going to the Burrow for Christmas Eve,” Harry said, “but we can invite her and Teddy over on Christmas day. I usually visit them anyway.”
“You entered rooms like someone had released doves behind you.”
Pansy had stopped messaging him as often after her last visit, and his mother only sent an owl around about once a month. He did, however, have new resources at his disposal. He found out that he hated talking on the phone after calling Hermione. Merely waiting for social interaction and listening to that dreaded dial tone was absolutely stress-inducing. He wasn’t about to starve himself, though. He had survived too much to end up in a grave like that. Friday evening, he gave in and picked up the phone.
“Ready?”
Their stares seemed to double somehow. None of them would say a word, and Draco wouldn’t look away from the bucket that was nearly filled to the brim.
Relief spread across Harry’s face but it only made Ron appear more hurt.
"Well, it's not fair, is it? You don't have any embarrassing baby photos in the bath or stupid clothes your parents put you in."
Harry started to tell her to give her their usual, but Pansy interrupted. “Give me whatever is your best.”
“Okay.”
He didn’t care. “If this idiot had listened to me earlier, then he wouldn’t be here at all. He’s not getting out of it a second time.”
Draco stopped attempting to keep his face composed around Harry a while ago. He blushed madly as the corner of his mouth began to quirk up. “You are insatiable.”
Harry abandoned the stones and settled in the knot of roots beside Draco, lying almost flat to the ground so he couldn’t peak at the sketchbook unless Draco wanted him to. “Maybe I need more sleep since someone is keeping me up with their snores.”
Harry looked up to meet his eyes. “Why does it matter why I’m nice to you now?”
When they were done, Draco took the plates and ordered Harry to take a shower. "If you don't get in that shower right now, I'll finally fulfill that fetish of yours and get in the shower with you. However, trust me, I won't make it pleasant."
Malfoy agreed, picking out a random box and sitting down. Without a second thought, Harry broke apart a set of chopsticks. He was about to start digging in when he noticed Malfoy frowning at his hand. "What?"
“Hmm…” Draco pretended to consider it.
“It’s your day,” Ron lifted on shoulder in a short shrug as he pondered the contents of Harry’s desk, “if that’s what you want then fine. Mum just wants you to be happy.”
He snatched the files before Draco could. “Those are confidential.”
“If they ask for a reason?”
“Good morning, Cissy,” Harry greeted.
It was obviously not the first time he'd seen Harry like this. It happened every once in a while. He'd go silent for a bit. The thing was, Draco knew he, himself, did it as well.
“I know. That’s why I brought you here.” Harry’s eyes dropped down to Malfoy’s chest. “Please, I need to see.”
Tense silence hung off of her words. They warred silently with hard gazes and straight lips. Harry finally gave in.
A sigh left Harry’s mouth as he sat back. “They need time to heal. It hasn’t even been a year yet.”
Harry returned to folding another one of his shirts. “I thought we could do that proper traveling thing you were talking about.”
“And that’s relevant because?”
Hermione crossed the room in the three large steps. Ron right behind her. They both dropped onto the bed on either side of him. They wrapped their arms around him in a tight embrace. He tensed. Then he finally let everything out.
“Carrow?” Ron repeated. His eyes darted between the three Auror’s in the room. Had he missed something while he was gone?
“What? You barely drink.” Draco tried to think of a time when he remembered Harry ever drinking around the flat. They had wine a few times a week, but it was usually only one bottle that they shared.
Harry’s immediate response would have been, “I wouldn’t know,” but he held his tongue, he knew it wouldn’t come across well. Instead, he nodded politely.
“No, he called me earlier,” she explained. He eased for a second and then tensed again. It wasn’t the hot, tight burst as before, but something strenuous which knotted his muscles and made him look down at his lap.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Pansy hummed, placing a gentle hand on his shoulder. “I could tell you really wanted to spend the day with him.”
Of course, he never had the best habits to begin with. Sitting and watching the television for hours on end was likely not the best for him. He couldn’t make himself do much more, though. As much as he kept telling himself to forget about Harry, it simply wasn’t happening. It didn’t help that Harry’s stuff was still there. He should really clean that out.
Malfoy shewed this point away and went on, “And when we served our detention, that thing only attacked us because you were being nosy.”
Zabini was at a loss for words. All he could utter out was a pleading, “Draco,” as the blonde turned away.
Harry threw his hands up in the air, groaning loudly. At least one thing hadn't changed. Malfoy was just as difficult as he'd always been.
Malfoy nodded slowly, never moving his eyes. “Which is aggravating since it’s so damn drafty in here, and warming charms start to feel muggy after too long.”
He got to his feet ― the brush of his hand against Draco’s thigh as he pushed himself up, not being the accident it seemed. “Then let’s go to bed.”
The grumble turned into a whimper. Harry blinked through the darkness, trying to adjust his eyes to the lack of light. He could see the outline of Malfoy’s body under the covers and how badly it trembled. Harry took a step closer and could suddenly hear Malfoy’s shaky breath, occasionally interrupted by more groans and whimpers.
Draco rolled his eyes, proceeding to sit on the squashing armchair as if it was a throne, throwing one leg over the other. “I’m not a child, Potter. I can handle myself just fine, thank you.”
Ron gave a small conceding nod. “If you insist.” Ron sighed as he got to his feet. Hermione was still sitting and staring unseeingly at Harry.
Harry frowned. He opened his mouth to say something along the lines of ‘don’t be ridiculous’ but fell short of actually speaking the words. The longer he considered it… “Yeah, sort of.”
“But you left for-“
Ron finally followed his gaze. He straightened. “Mate,” he spoke warily. “Maybe I should stay.”
Harry followed his lead and began collecting essentials off the counter. “I’m can’t go back.”
The boy’s back went rigid. He hesitated, either because he feared he might have offended or that, perhaps, Harry would offer something else. He turned slowly. “What?”
Harry shot a hand in the direction of the plant-loving boy. "See! Who needs an infirmary when we have an herb savant right here?"
“Put him there?” Draco repeated. Of course, that’s what they’d assume. Draco had to be the source of all the bad things that happened. It was always his fault. “I didn’t do anything to him!” he snapped. “It was Macnair, not me.”
Draco followed her gaze. He was grateful that he closed the door behind him on the way out. Harry didn’t like wearing much when he was drinking ― yet another reason Draco was slowly going insane. “We make do.”
Harry looked at the peephole. "It's Harry," he said uselessly. If Malfoy was looking through the hole, then he'd clearly gotten that much. Harry rubbed the back of his neck. "I brought some food for you. I figured since you can't leave for a while, you might need something."
They had been back at Hogwarts for less than a month and it was actually all quite stifling. The adoration from the younger students. The pity in the eyes of the professors. The world outside watching with baited breath to see how the war worn students were going to make it through the year.
A frown pulled on Harry’s face as he watched the boy scurry up the stairs.
,” Hermione pressed. “It has not been proven one way or the other. There’s no right or wrong answer to it.”
Draco stilled. He frowned at his boyfriend, studying the tick of his jaw. “What did you do?”
“He trusted that you wouldn’t.”
“But you don’t make the same mistake twice,” Malfoy countered, his eyes becoming much more alive when snapping to Harry. It made him strangely happy, and it showed with his smile.
The previous weekend, when Harry had taken Malfoy shopping for houseware, they had stumbled upon a small corner café that appeared relatively peaceful. After a short walk ― and the use of Malfoy's far better sense of direction ― they arrived at the English Rose Café.
Draco’s and Harry’s mouths fell open simultaneously as they turned a look on one another then back on the girls. “What do you mean?” Harry pressed. “All this time you thought we were dating?”
Hermione’s head swiveled around the room. “Where is he?” She looked to Harry with sudden alarm. “He is here, right? You two didn’t break up over this?” She appeared genuinely concerned and it warmed Harry’s heart.
There was more silence, but Harry imagined Draco was smiling as much as he was.
Before Draco could even processes his words, Teddy’s cyan locks began to fade to platinum white. It mixed strangely with Harry’s green eyes which he still adorned.
Hermione and Ron became slack-jawed. Sorry wasn’t a word that Harry
“Enjoying the view, Draco?” Harry pulled on the shirt but purposefully stalled in buttoning up as Draco’s grey gaze roamed.
“Wow, Pans, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you in love before,” Draco teased mildly.
In honesty, Draco knew he shouldn't be surprised. The Macnair case was likely the only thing keeping Harry going right now. If Draco wasn't so worried about Harry's safety, then he might tell him to just go into work if it meant he'd perk up a bit.
However the manor, and even a nearby paddock not much unlike this one, felt far more constant, each made of ancient stone. They were cold and hard and likely to outlast anything he did by thousands of years, never to be moved unless by pure force. That was very much unlike the pliable wood he leaned against or the lopsided Burrow which swayed ever so subtly with the wind. It was soft and uncertain but also alive with possibilities to continue evolving and growing.
Though it appeared Draco had some reservations about the matter, Harry wasn’t about to deny the woman. “All right, Narcissa. You can call me Harry then.”
Draco started shaking his head and tried to look away. Harry didn’t allow it for long. He slid his fingers into the hair at the nape of his neck, where he knew Draco liked to be touched and pulled his gaze back. “I’m sorry,” Harry repeated, trying to put as much undiluted sincerity into his voice. “If you ever need me again, I’ll be there.”
Hermione stayed perfectly still, not sure what was going on. She could feel the weight in the way he moved. He fidgeted with his sleeve and appeared relatively small even though he was taller than the woman. “Does Harry… Does Harry have a drinking problem?”
When they arrived in London, Harry had sent a letter to the Weasleys to assure them that they’d arrived. He’d also mentioned that Narcissa had come but was staying at Grimmauld during the party. Of course, Molly Weasley had too much compassion to let that stand.
The momentary panic he felt at seeing unfamiliar surroundings faded quickly when a pointy-faced blonde came into focus. Malfoy stood in the kitchen, busying himself over what looked like two cups of tea. "Good morning, Princess Potter," he crooned.
That was the wrong thing to say. Ron's worry doubled. "You didn't have that checked out at the infirmary."
Ron dropped his arm again, heaving a sigh as if this was a great inconvenience. Harry knew he was really just upset that Malfoy made a minimal amount of sense. He should have considered that.
It was a quaint place. When they opened the door, they found several high-top tables spread around the room, only one of which was occupied. A comfortable sofa and two armchairs were pushed underneath a set of windows. Several university students crowded around the area as they fussed over a project, their coffee mugs strewed about in dubious places.
It appeared Slughorn wouldn’t have to know either. When he flipped the same page as before, he once again found a piece of parchment stuffed into the binding but this one was smaller, just enough to scribble down a note.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She married a muggle-born,” Harry answered. “Walburga Black didn’t like it when people disobeyed the family ideals.” He gestured to another splotch with the name Sirius underneath. “She did the same to my godfather after he left the family.” He pointed at another a little further up. “And his uncle for helping him.”
On paper, the last three months were a dizzying dream. They were full of hotel room sheets, ancient buildings, and cities overfilling with life. In reality, they were probably the hardest and most rewarding months of either of their lives. Not only did they burry themselves into cultures – muggle and magical alike – but they ventured into deeper places as well.
Harry ground his teeth. Zabini’s words were sinking in. In truth, his bout of anger was not only because of the implications of Zabini’s seduction method.  “He thought I was going to save him?”
Ron lowered himself closer to Harry, dropping his voice. "Hey, 'Mione's been pestering me to introduce you to Mary, that pretty blonde she works with. How about we take a break and go down there later?"
Had anyone ever known the real him? Did he know the real him? At the start of this term, he likely would have said no.
Everything was immaculate. The only thing out of place was a book on the coffee table, which almost looked purposefully askew. There were no colors. It was all white or light wood accents. The only semblance of personality was the floral painting hanging on the wall over the television, and Harry had a feeling Malfoy hadn't picked it out.
Harry shrugged. "A few that my mum and dad took but after," he skipped over saying what happened to them, Draco knew, and he didn't want to sour the mood, "no, not really."
There was a weight deep in Harry's chest. It attempted to keep him from leaving. He knew he had to, though. There was a maniac on the loose, who he might be able to stop. Confusing emotions aside, he couldn't stay just because he wanted to be with Draco.
The image of Skeres standing over a bloodied and battered Malfoy pounded in his mind. His stomach twisted. The thought echoed Harry's memory standing in a similar position of Skeres as Malfoy bled from a dozen cuts on a Hogwarts' bathroom floor.
“Hm?”
Another flash of fear darted across Goyle’s face. He tried to subdue it but masking ones feelings was apparently not a Slytherin trait. “I didn’t take those pictures,” he grunted, frowning at the ground to avoid Harry’s eyes. “That was someone from the Prophet.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Oh, how dare I worry about you? What a terrible person I am.” He looked back at Harry with a mistrustful glare. “Don’t take too long. I’ll come drag you out if I have to.”
Malfoy flinched at the name. Harry noted that the disdain on his face was far greater than most who heard it. Typically it was distant contempt, filtered by never having met the man. To Malfoy, it looked like a personal affront and Harry supposed it was. “Maybe that’s why you came back, but you shouldn’t assume for everyone.”
"I saw the cauldron in your room," Harry commented, watching Malfoy pour the red wine he had pilfered from Harry's wine cellar the other day. "Are you working on potions again?"
“Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed. He was supposed to be going to Malfoys right now. He couldn’t just skip, not without warning him. He didn’t want Malfoy to see him like this, though.
“You know,” Draco spoke in an even tone, trying to keep the badgers from scurrying away, “if you didn’t hold your wand in such a death grip, it may not feel so choked and blast out like that.”
The ghostly bitter smile on Harry’s lips fell. He could see true hurt in his friends eyes as he said this.
Harry shook his head. “I apparate home every day. The only times I haven’t were when I left Grimmauld and that’s still warded to high hell, and I’ve never come across a wizard in that area. Someone had to know they would find us there.” Harry looked back down at the image of him and Draco kissing. “They must have been following us all day.” He remembered the few chills he had gotten that day and written off as his hyperawareness. He should have trusted his instincts.
To his great relief, there were no signs of distress when he got to Malfoy's door. He knocked like usual and called, "Food's here," before grabbing one of the many boxes off the top for himself and going back to the stairwell. He slumped back onto the bench across the street and began to eat.
Harry froze. His hand still had a vice grip around the wooden railing but the sound of his blood pounding in his ears was fading. He glanced back at Malfoy over his shoulder. “Oh.”
The smile fell. Zabini assessed him in the way Harry was now beginning to realize was a very Slytherin trait. Only a second passed before the light turned on in his eyes. “He told you.”
Malfoy waited until they were out in the hall away from prying ears before he said, “Potter, your test scores really are abysmal. You don’t even have the excuse of someone wanting to kill you anymore.”
“Nothing for now, just… There’s nothing to say. It’s private.”
Relief once again spread across Ron’s face. “Oh, okay.” He didn’t answer Harry’s question. For a moment, Harry was going to drop it but Ron’s features once again began to twist. “So is it like…just a casual thing between all of you?”
“That’s why you’re nice to me?” Draco said the words aloud as if testing them. “You don’t want me to feel the way that you did?”
It was official; Harry was trying to kill him.
They were barely settled at the table when the elf came back and instantly started on dinner. He actually looked pleased to have work to do. Draco and Harry talked a little, but they were mostly enjoying each other’s company.
Draco sat down first, and Harry copied the motion beside him. Draco tried to talk to him about what they should watch, but Harry just nodded politely, his eyes watching the television screen but clearly vacant.
like him?”
Harry frowned. A visitor? Ron and Hermione were his only usual visitors. Anyone else would have sent a letter in advance, and only former Order members knew how to find his house without directions, of which there were few left. The Minister? McGonagall? Molly?
Harry’s smile lowered into a devious smirk. “What, Malfoy? Did you only want me to call you pretty again?” That same delicate-sounding word once again out in the air hit Malfoy like a dagger to the chest. Harry reveled in it. “I didn’t know you were so vain to need to be complimented all the time, but as your friend, I guess I’ll do my duty.”
Draco shook his head instantly before dropping his forehead against Harry’s. “I needed to hear it.”
The ire in Harry’s eyes subsided.  “Okay, good point.” He’d been only addressing the second part, hastily scurrying around the first. “Come on, Malfoy. It’s not raining and it’s going to start getting cold soon. I need to get out of this stuffy castle and Ron’s off with Hermione today.”
“How is he?” Ron asked, once again surprising Harry with how sincere his friends sounded. “I heard about Lucius showing up. Did you tell him?”
“‘Mione?”
For a moment, sadness filled him when he realized which memory was the dream. Then sense finally snapped back. He couldn't be having dreams like that, not about Draco, especially not while sleeping next to him. Thoughts like that would just ruin things.
"It wasn't. I'm staying by choice." Harry started to question this, but Malfoy spoke over him. "Obviously, there's a problem here because the only people who know I live here are my parents and the Ministry, and we made sure that it wouldn't be on the public record."
Harry resisted a response, only pursing his lips and looking away. There was a breathy and somewhat unsettled chuckle beside him, but he didn’t bring it up again.
However, before long, Harry was beginning to wonder if he had made the right call about bringing Hermione and Malfoy together again.
Harry slowly lifted his head. Malfoy was in a ball on the ground as well, his back pushed up against the wall as he rocked back and forth. He had thrown his wand on the ground, holding his head between his knees as he looked upon Harry with wide, fearful eyes. "I didn't mean to," he said through sharp, quick breaths. "I'm sorry. I can't. I can't." He shook his head violently, continuing to rock.
Malfoy was sitting on the sofa with intentional poise, his legs propped up on the cushions and a book in his hands as he tried not to check the clock every five seconds. He was failing. He couldn’t help it; Harry should have been there by now.
That thought had crossed his mind before. It was a hope he'd hung onto for several months after their breakup, but he eventually gave up. They were too similar in their grief. They both threw themselves into something else – anything else – just to make it all go away. For Ginny, it had been Quidditch. For Harry, it was being an Auror. He was aware of it; he didn't need Hermione and Ron's interventions to tell him that. It didn't make him stop, though.
Harry couldn’t lie to his godson. “Yes.”
"I just didn't realize you could actually cook," Malfoy urged. "I assumed you were just winging it and assuming it wasn't that hard." He was about to put more in his mouth but paused. "Please tell me you actually learned this somewhere, and it's not just one of your many natural talents."
“And when this gets back to the office, you’ll be out of a job with me,” Harry snapped.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded slowly, “but you said you didn’t want to hear them.”
Harry observed his pose, pushed back into the farthest corner with his knees up to his chest, almost exactly how he had found him the first time. He almost looked scared. “Is that why you won’t sit close to the fire?”
Harry could only swallow.
“Granger!”
“Well,” she looked at the clock, “it will be in about fifteen minutes.” She watched as both young men became incredibly deflated. “You know, the definition of family can be very grey… I overheard someone saying you two live together, is that right?”
The tension in Harry’s chest lessened seeing the other boy’s wide, sparkling eyes. “Yes, of course.”
Seeing an easy out, Draco took the child’s offer and allowed himself to be guided to the frosted garden.
Harry let out a loud groan into the pillow.
“Fine, what if I did?” Harry snapped. “What if I was in love with you? What would you say?”
The urge to argue was there, but Harry snapped his lips shut. They had just mended one disagreement. He didn’t want to start another.
Harry frowned. He felt Teddy’s small hand tighten around his fingers. “Why not?”
When he heard a door clicking, he automatically assumed it was one of his neighbors. It wasn't until he heard the plastic bag rustling that he spun around.
She pulled back to arm’s length, raising a brow. “Really? That’s not what Ron’s said.”
. I mean, I remember Malfoy Manor. How can you go from that to this?"
He stopped at the open doorway as if a shield charm had been put up. The warmth in his chest became hot, and his muscles tensed, his lungs suddenly beginning to burn too hot to get a good breath.
Even as Harry sat cross-legged on the floor with a chessboard between him and Ron, Malfoy sat on the couch behind him, knee pressed up against his back. Harry didn’t mind at all, not even appearing to notice what his backrest was. Or maybe he did since Malfoy kept leaning forward to whisper something in his ear.
“Well, I suppose we’ve each gotten at least one punch in at Malfoy, so this is an even way to end it,” Ron said with a sigh.
“I’m not drunk! I’ve had two drinks.”
"You do realize it is a big deal, right?" Malfoy urged. "You're Harry Saint Potter and a bunch of
Malfoy took a small sip from his mug. “Thank you,” he said once more, this time his voice far more earnest.
Harry nearly dropped Teddy. He and Draco looked at each other with wide eyes and then down at the child between them. He really did look like their child right now.
The eighth-years were not in a tall twisty tower like the Gryffindors or Ravenclaws, or underground like the Hufflepuffs or Slytherins. They’d been housed just off of a lesser used corridor―previous guest quarters according to Hermione. It was small and cozy, and the second floor, where all of the bedrooms were, had an open balcony over half of the common room. The fireplace was not visible from the boys’ side but Harry could see the warm glow of light floating up to the ceiling.
“In other jobs, sure,” Robards agreed with a nod, “but not in this one. I would have thought, given your history, you would understand that.” He smacked the locked drawer of his thick, wooden desk. “I have all of my people’s loved ones on file – their jobs, their habits, everything. A lot of dark witches and wizards would love that information because that’s how you properly threaten an Auror.
Draco bobbed his head and spoke with polite gratitude for the invitation. He wasn’t sure if he meant it yet. His eyes darted across each of the room’s occupants. Charlie and Molly were making attempts to smile. Ron looked as exasperated and mildly concerned as he had the last time Draco had seen him. The rest of the occupants barely hid their disdain.
“Himself in a mirror,” answered Harry, simply. “It’s why I have to continually compliment him, or his ego will flatten entirely.”
“He’ll be okay. He just needs to heal up, and everything will be back to normal.”
“I’m not going to hit you,” Malfoy scoffed.
"I can't just sit on this." Harry slung the bag over his shoulder. "Macnair could be killing someone else right now." He started towards the door, not even considering that he was still in muggle clothes.
“How about I don’t smother you with a pillow and we call it even?” Harry shot back sharply.
That crooked sort of grin curved Harry’s face, the one that always came about when he was having fun teasing Malfoy. “Just remember, you asked for it.”
Harry’s smile began to fall. He wasn’t sure if he had just accidentally started another argument or not. The meaning was clear enough. Being in that house likely had all sorts of risks only a few months ago.
Harry shook his head and flapped his hand at them, trying to pull on a casual smile. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll be right behind you. Go on.”
There was a moment of silence and Malfoy did not look up from the thin book in his lap. Harry began to wonder if he had not heard him somehow when Malfoy spoke. “The quidditch pitch?” he spoke softly as though he was asking himself a question about something he’d read.
He nodded but was still visibly distracted. “Yes but this place is a mess. We have to get it cleaned up before she gets here.”
“If you don’t want me to deck him every time he gives you a dirty look, then yes.”
“I–“ Malfoy’s train of determination had run off course. He blinked and gave a small huff. “Force of habit,” he grunted, looking away again.
She fell quiet again, her thoughts becoming distant but her gaze still flicked around the room. Harry wanted to ask more questions but he was overly aware of Draco only a few meters away. The tea was soon prepared and Draco joined them, levitating three mugs ahead of him.
“Where are your parents?” Harry barked at the boys.
“Yes, including you many times.”
because I’ve always wanted the same thing.”
Draco started to move as if he was going to give up his seat which made Harry give him an odd look. Draco glanced towards the door, apparently content with leaving so he could talk to his friends. Harry didn’t let that thought linger. He dropped onto the ground like Ron and pressed his shoulder into the side of Draco’s knee. Draco glared at him but eased once again.
Ron shrugged. "We don't know that for sure ― Terry isn't talking. It might have been self-defense. I wouldn't put it past Malfoy to strike first. He did it enough to us back in school."
. It wasn’t likely he’d get it anytime soon. Slughorn barely acknowledged anyone with the slightest trace of Death Eater connections and Draco certainly had a few of those. The idea had mostly just been some sort of wishful thinking, something to keep his mind occupied with some kind of goal.
"If you give me a list, I can go down to Diagon Alley and get what you need tomorrow," Harry suggested.
“Honestly?” Hermione asked quietly.
Harry’s head tipped to the side, his eyebrows pushing together. “No, I’m used to that. I don’t like
At the very least, Zabini seemed to be staying out of the way lately. Harry couldn’t help but feel a stir of delight whenever he spotted the snake eying them. He was also pleased that everyone else seemed to have finally gotten bored of bullying Malfoy. All things would be going well if Malfoy would just open up a little more.
His eyes found bushy hair and a tight expression. Hermione Granger.
“Believe it or not, I’m actually quite content right now. All I’ve ever wanted is a normal school year.”
Draco stiffened when heard the names. When he saw the attached bodies going to greet Ginny with hugs, he quickly pushed back into his seat in hopes to go unnoticed. It seemed to work. He watched the Weasley women interact with the pair out of the corner of his eye. He remembered what Harry had told him about them. They were together. He wondered if it was true that the Weasleys were okay with it. By the warm smiles on the women’s faces, it appeared to be accurate.
He tried to go about his days regularly. Work kept his mind busy during the day. It also kept his home life at ease as Draco maintained his title of informant - together they solved twice as many cases as a whole team of Auror’s could in one week. At first, Ron was bitter now that he knew where Harry was getting his information from, but he quickly began to accept it, even relying on it occasionally - asking if Harry could run his own theory’s by Draco.
Ron scoffed again. "Yeah, trust me, no one's forgotten about that."
As expected, when he arrived at Cobb & Webb's, he found the owner standing in front of the broken window of his shop pointing his wand at two boys who were likely fourth or fifth years. Harry was never the best at diplomatic situations but he tapped into his training and managed to calm the situation. Seeing that the damages could be fixed with a simple repairing charm, Harry was able to get the boys out of trouble with the owner but he would still need to talk to their parents.
“I’m warning you, Zabini!”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I’m fine,” he huffed. He crossed his arms over his chest but it appeared more like a self-hug rather than confidence. “You don’t have to check on me like I’m a toddler.”
Malfoy’s shoulders relaxed. That made more sense―in a muddled Gryffindor type way. His eyes found the lightning-shaped bolt etched just behind his fringe, and he wondered for the first time how much he hated it.
But Harry was sinking again, his dark thoughts almost visible as they clouded his eyes. “Harry,” Malfoy said again.
Harry was only partially paying attention. His eyes kept flicking over towards Malfoy, who had taken up his usual position across the room. Harry was hoping he would look up so he could attempt to convince Malfoy to join them, but the boy’s eyes were glued to his book.
Laughter fell out of Harry's mouth before he could stop it. Malfoy sat up quickly. He glared daggers at Harry, now offended by him. Nevertheless, Harry spotted his reddening cheeks and could tell he was embarrassed about being ignorant about something.
“Thanks.” He began to pull his arms through the sleeves.
Harry never thought about that before. They were barely around each other near the end of their relationship, so he never really got to see her reaction to that. "I don't know what she thought of all of that. We just had a lot to deal with on our own. We both had some healing to do after everything."
Ron scoffed. “Yeah, okay. Like Charlie, right?”
“Hey, back away slowly from the electric stove,” Harry ordered. “Haven’t we been over this?”
"What about for yourself?"
If someone was his nemesis, it had to have been Voldemort, right? Malfoy was just Malfoy. Arrogant and bigoted but still Malfoy. Only he wasn’t anymore, at least not the way he used to be. Perhaps some of that burned off in the fire before Harry had reached him.
"Don't tell me you're cooking for Kreacher again," Ron said, wrinkling his nose.
“Hey, Harry,” she greeted as they both stepped around the sofa for a quick embrace. “I’m sorry I wasn’t expecting you. We don’t have anything planned for dinner.”
Ron’s jaw was set as he eyed Harry. “Then I’ll find another job.” He stepped around the sofa towards Harry, lowering his voice to keep Draco from hearing. “Haven’t you figured out after all this time that we do this together, even if it’s defending Draco?”
“It’s okay, Potter.” There was a sense that Malfoy meant more than just accepting the apology for waking him, but Harry ignored it and walked past him.
Instinct said to restrain Malfoy first. Auror training noted that Skeres was the current hostile threat and should be the one that was contained first. Harry's throbbing head refused to let him make a decision, so Ron made it for him. He threw a body-bind curse at Skeres first before tossing a rope tying jinx around Malfoy.
The smile on his face said otherwise, and Harry was more than happy to have caused it. “Yes, I did. They are all losers if they won’t even talk to you.”
Draco drew in a heavy breath, letting it fill him up till he stood tall. “I was only wondering if there was something I should know but, if not, I’ll handle it.” He glanced back at the apartment door. “He has a checkup today. I’ll call you with the results.”
“You are the one who what’s us to get along, right?” Hermione added, looking pointedly at Harry.
There was silence. Harry felt his heavy assessment once more, but this time it was over quicker. “I would think not,” he spoke indignantly. “Everyone gravitates towards you. You must have been quite the popular child.”
“I despise you,” Draco deadpanned.

Harry took one of the button-ups from the wardrobe before turning back to the other boy. Nothing appeared to have happened. There was no reason for a malfunction, and yet Draco had gone very quiet. His mouth was slightly open, hanging off the last syllable where the last of his thoughts seemed to have also left off. The only part of his expression that gave any explanation was where his eyes were.
Harry's hands came down on the table before he realized he'd moved his arms. Malfoy jumped at the loud bang. Their silverware trembled. To Harry's great horror, Malfoy had pushed himself into his chair, his eyes wide as he trembled.
“We should have at least been head boy and head girl then,” Ron grumbled.
"They're chopsticks," Harry explained, trying hard to swallow his laughter. "Some muggles use them to eat with." At least that answered the question of international cuisine in the wizarding world.
Draco hardened. He smacked the hand away. “I know it was all a lie. You just wanted my name to protect you.”
“Yes, I think the roast still needs some time in the oven,” spoke Molly. “I’ll see how everyone is doing.”
It wasn’t unusual for Harry to grow stiff suddenly. He was still trying to be less paranoid outside of work. Draco’s presence always helped. When he saw no one watching them other than an unhappy elderly couple on the front terrace of a restaurant across the street, he sighed and shook his head. While their skin was fairly wrinkled and pale, neither were Voldemort coming back to kill him. He turned back to Draco. “I’m fine.”
but it didn’t last.
Conversations ebbed and flowed, naturally changing between topics and who was adding their opinion. Draco didn’t add anything of his own. He had become preoccupied with spying some ash still in Harry’s mop from Flooing to the Burrow. He started to pick it out detected but he didn’t expect Harry to lean into his touch or for him to lull his eyes so much. Was he trying to be obvious? He gave a quick pinch the root of his hair. Harry claimed retribution by pinching Draco’s ankle. Draco stomped his foot following it with a kick to Harry’s thigh.
“Don’t apologize,” Draco said in the same hushed tone. “We both knew they weren’t going to greet me with open arms. It’s okay.”
Harry didn't sleep on the sofa again. For the following weeks, they shared the bed and the bathroom and the wardrobe and everything. The nightmares didn't cease, but they were manageable now, both of them comforted with the knowledge that someone was just an arm's length away who could help them through it.
He began to slowly lever his eyelids open. Another groan escaped his lips.
Cool fingertips brushed the underside of Harry’s wrist. He looked down to watch as Malfoy’s hand wrapped around his wrist, giving him a proper anchor. The realization that his former nemesis was the one currently holding him to his senses was enough to pull him down, but he still didn’t let go.
“You looked at the Prophet, didn’t you? I told you not to. They always over-exaggerate things, and you don’t need to worry about that right now.”
Harry sat down in the very spot he was looking, keeping his hands in a tight grasp. It worked for half a second, Draco watching the movement then trying to look away, but Harry leaned with his gaze and tried to maintain it. “I’m not scared of you,” he implored.
He spun back to face her. “You’re right,” he admitted. “You’re also right that I don’t like it, but,” he glanced up at the ceiling towards Harry’s room, “I hate this even more. I refuse to invite Umbridge over for dinner, but,” he heaved a sigh, “I guess I can handle Malfoy.”
Harry took his hand from the curtain, brushing the dust against his jeans. Draco was leaning against the doorframe with his arms crossed. “Just about how much has changed.” His eyes skimmed the old room which he once shared with Ron so many years ago.
Harry raised a brow. “It’s just a cup of herbal. It’s not even that good; Hermione just broke me into it. You don’t have to thank me twice.”
Despite the very clear voice of reason in the back of Harry’s mind―that always had the infallible ability of sounding like Hermione―he could not bring himself to regret that day in any way. Possibly, he should have chosen his last words a little better. He had never been very good at choosing his words though, being declared a war hero wasn’t going to change that.
It was that damn case. No one had to tell him. Harry had been obsessed with it before he even came in and somehow convinced Robards that it was Macnair who was doing it ― he wouldn’t even tell Ron where he’d gotten that intel from.
“I still won every time, though, didn’t I?”
He rather hurt Malfoy's feelings than risk physically hurting him. He still couldn't look at Ginny the same way after the time she tried to calm one of his panic attacks by hugging him. He broke up with her the next week ― he almost started vomiting when he heard her tell Ron the bruise on her arm was from a rogue Bludger.
Malfoy’s eyes were the size of bludgers. Harry couldn’t help but chuckle. “I’m fairly certain all of the girls in our year have a pool of when we’ll hook up.” He propped his elbow on the back of the sofa, dropping his head into his hand. “I’m not surprised since I have made it a habit of mine to call you pretty when you’re annoying me―which is a lot.”
“He’s still our friend; of course, he needs us,” Hermione urged.
It was already the last few days of November when Draco entered the library on a Monday. He gave Madam Pince his usual, polite greeting which she had started to return lately, finally graduating from the curt nod that had first replaced her shushes.
“Oh shut it, Auror Potter, I know the rules,” Pansy urged. “We’re allowed to tell our significant others if they are muggles as long as we are prepared to clean it up if it goes wrong, which it didn’t. I only told her a few days ago, I haven’t gotten around to filing it at the ministry.”
Harry sighed and dropped down onto the opposite couch. “I’m sorry. I didn’t even think about it–“ He stopped. “Wait, if no one else is in there, then why don’t you unlock it yourself. There’s nothing disturbing to see.”
Malfoy looked down at him out of the corner of his eye. Something wrung his insides, and suddenly he wished very desperately for Harry to get up. He swallowed hard, attempting not to look at the other man. "I never called you cute."
Harry agreed with a smile before pulling him back for another kiss. With every touch, their pleasant steadiness from before quickly dissolved into fast lust. Clothing became forgotten on the floor and for once, in many years, both men allowed themselves to be happy without guilt.
Draco grabbed both of his arms and pushed him back into the cot. “You’re staying here,” he demanded.
“I haven’t seen you in months,” Harry wined. “Besides, we only have a week before Andy drops off Teddy for the summer.”
Draco rolled his eyes. He wanted to ask if Harry typically held Ron’s hand like this but he didn’t want to start a conversation he wouldn’t be able to finish, not here of all places.
“Malfoy,” Harry pressed.
Suddenly, Harry deeply regretted sending Draco away. He could feel the dread already beginning to claw at his chest. What had he just done?
Most of the Auror's had to be out of the office by now. They were likely at home with their families and trying to wind down for the day. Was Harry planning on showing up on their doors, asking if anyone would help him track this lead? Draco wouldn't put it past him. He could tell Harry was ready to pursue this, even if it meant going on his own. He really hoped Harry wouldn't be that stupid. It was Harry Potter, though.
Harry studied the man. He could always tell the twins apart but it had become more apparent now. George had lines that were now unique to his face alone: The hint of frown lines on his brown and ever present dark circles beneath his eyes. And while he’d always been the more rational one, Harry had never seen him as stoic as was then. “Are you upset?”
"Sorry I'm late, the queue at the store was insane," Harry called into the flat as he entered. He went straight to the kitchen, dropping the plastic bags on the counter and beginning to take stuff out.
Harry, of course, did not listen. He caught up to Draco and matched his gate. “I need some too.”
Draco turned towards the table by the door then handed her a pad of paper and a pen. She stared at it. “Oh! You press the top,” Draco instructed.
This cracked Harry’s stern eyes. His brows knitted together. Zabini collected this information like he was feeding data to a machine and adjusting for effectiveness. “You did save all of the wizarding world,” Harry scoffed, and Zabini quickly smoothed over it as he went on, “and you let all of us go. You saved us from fighting our own family members. Of course, I didn’t have any there, but the sentiment remains.”
It wasn’t as if he was a mean drunk or that he drank a whole bottle in one night. He was just so restless that he seemed to need something to sedate him. However, once he was sedated, he’d usually become very quiet and stared blankly at the television or out the window, or he’d have a panic attack that Draco would have to talk him down from.
The old name stirred Harry just enough. He began an attempt to struggle, testing the restraints on his wrists and twisting his hips. However, any thought of escape ran away instantly. All his thrashing seemed to do was light up their points of contact and send something warm to his stomach. Either he would stay right where he was, or he would do something stupid. Enough time spent forcefully shoving his mind towards reason—thanks to Hermione–he decided to stay still.
He lifted his leg and was inches from kicking Harry away had Harry not jumped back in time. There was a triumphant smirk on his face that Malfoy would love to wipe away. Something else did it for him.
Malfoy lit up at this, the way he always did when talking about Narcissa. It was always the easiest topic to bring up, especially when Malfoy was having a particularly hard time sleeping.
Harry took this as his best response. “Are you going to join us or keep frowning at your book?”
Ron nodded at this, and it appeared he’d been appeased until his eyes narrowed. “You didn’t fancy any of my other siblings, right?”
“No, I’m going to sit in here and eat like a heartbroken girl eating her lunch alone in a cubical.”
"No!" Harry snapped without thought.
Malfoy kept up the mask of long-suffering, but Harry could see the twinkle in his eye, and suddenly Harry wondered just how badly he would regret this.
“Oh, so that’s you sober? Merlin, help us.” Malfoy’s eyebrows lifted as he was having difficulty not looking up to peak at Potter’s expression. From the few smothered chuckles around the room, he had a feeling it was good.
“You wouldn’t like it,” Harry answered.
"If it wasn't left behind, then I don't have it," Malfoy claimed. "As far as muggle things, at least."
“Really?” Harry stopped tracing his arm, becoming distracted. “You don’t seem like a country style man?”
“Potter?” Malfoy’s voice had come out on a whisper, but it startled Harry like he’d yelled the name.
.” He scanned Draco’s face like a healer assessing injuries. “Are you okay?”
Draco’s gaze flickered over him. More truth had come out of Harry’s mouth than he would have liked, but he was confident he would find no lies. Draco’s shoulders softened. “Don’t make it sound like you drugged me. I knew what I was doing. I should be the one saying that to you. I know I’m not exactly your type which is why I don’t understand why you were letting me do it.”
"Need me to call ya a taxi, sir?" asked the bartender as he watched Harry hobble to the door.
It was cramped and cluttered and would have driven his own mother crazy – he was having trouble not getting up to tidy a few things himself. However, it also looked like a home.  An overflowing basket of knitting supplies sat at his feet, what was possibly a scarf was half started and crumpled on top. Pictures with smiling faces littered any free space available. He found considerable interest in the grandfather clock which was useless if one wanted to know the time, however it was very informative as to the whereabouts – or rather the status – of the Weasley family members such as whether or not they were at home, work, or in mortal peril.
“It was convincing, though, wasn’t it?”
"Yeah, after I practically held you down!" Draco closed the bit of space between them to grab Harry's shoulders, keeping him from looking at his paperwork again. "If you haven't caught him yet, then you aren't going to catch him tomorrow. Let someone else worry about it for one day. Please, stay."
Ron pushed off the wall. “Well, that doesn’t sound like something that should be on the streets. Someone should inform Robards.”
Before long, bottles of firewhiskey and Butterbeer were being summoned up from the kitchens and passed around. Harry sat snuggly between Hermione and Neville on one of the couches, all of them listening to Justin Finch-Fletchley complain about History of Magic and their dreary ghostly professor.
"Healer Sow seems to like you," Harry mused, changing the subject.
He pulled the kettle off of the stove and began to pour the boiling water into two waiting mugs. Harry buried his face into Draco’s neck. Beneath the various potion ingredients which lingered on his clothes, he could smell their shampoo and that crisp scent that was purely Draco. He sighed, content. He was home. “I rather have something else,” he purred.
A slight noise slipped out of Hermione, and Ron stiffened again. They shared one of their looks of silent conversation, and it lasted far longer than any in the past. Harry was just about to jump up off the bench when they finally looked away.
“But he did,” George said calmly, completely unfazed by Harry’s outburst.
He clapped a hand onto Harry’s back and started to guide him to the large orange building at the end of the road. “I should go back to the office,” Harry said quietly.
“Oh bugger off all of you!” Malfoy snapped.
Before his lungs could begin to ache, Harry finally looked away, dropping his gaze back down to his hand, which was still rested on the dark mark.
Ron rolled his eyes. Draco looked back at Robards. “He didn’t have any help?”
“Arse,” Harry huffed and it really was just like old times.
Harry could not have hidden his giddy smile if he tried. “Come on, Malfoy. I swear I saw something in it.”
He went to take another swig of his wine but found that he barely had a whole sip left in his glass. He grabbed the bottle from between them, cursing under his breath when it nearly slipped out of his slippery palms. He was about to try again, but he felt a cool hand over his. His eyes snapped up to Malfoy. For a moment, he was going to try to shoo him away so he could do it on his own, but he thought better of it and allowed Malfoy to take the bottle from him, pouring a second glass for Harry and topping off his own.
Harry attempted another smile, this one wider but appearing just as painful. “I know.” He made a pathetic attempt at stretching his arm to reach the other man. Draco sighed and moved closer until Harry was able to touch his wrist. He pinched Draco’s sleeve, using only the tips of his fingers to play with the frayed ends of the sweater that resulted from Draco’s constant picking.
Draco looked up. His light eyes shimmered, peering at Harry with painful innocence. Harry’s already troubled lungs suddenly began to malfunction even more. It seemed to be playing a joint prank with his heart because he could feel his chest clench.
“Yes, sir.”
“Don’t act like you don’t absolutely love it.”
She blinked twice, then sighed. “Okay.” Ron offered his hand to help her up, seeing that she was still deep in thought.
He nodded. “We go to a cafe every Saturday and I occasionally go along to the shop, and Harry is a decent cook. I’m okay.”
Harry shook his head but couldn’t restrain the smile on his face. With one last fleeting glance at the names on the wall, he proceeded to his chambers.
formulated paper would look like.
“Who’s there?” barked Kreacher from another room as Harry stumbled out of the fireplace.
With his uniform and his toothbrush in hand, Harry met Malfoy back down in the kitchen then apparated them to Malfoy’s flat. Harry never felt so relieved to see such bland surroundings.
“Things are always attacking you.”
He pulled his wallet out and pulled out the folded piece of paper. Sure enough, in Robards' rushed handwriting was Park Row. Harry spun around, looking at each building until his eyes came across the building number written on the paper.
Harry's eyes widened with panic. He spun around to look at the kitchen. "Oh! I'm so sorry, Mrs. Malfoy. I'll do it right-"
Are you just out of love?
The door banged open. Harry and Lenny spun towards the sound. A bulky man in the same gray dungarees as Lenny rushed into the room, pushing the door shut behind him. A string of curses rushed out of his mouth on a whisper. “Lenny, I have to go-”
He hadn’t entirely forgotten about it but his plans were minimum to say the least. “Honestly, I was just going to spend it at home. Maybe take the day off.”
He looked back at the boy leaning precariously close to him, this time feeling more solid. “Must we?”
“I love you, too.”
There were things he wasn’t proud of anymore.
Harry rolled his eyes but took a sip nonetheless. It wasn’t nearly as good as any of the brews they had at home ― of which Harry was beginning to get used to.
Malfoy's hand stopped, mid-stir. He looked up with an uncertain jitteriness in his eyes. "Only if you want to," he said quickly. "I'm not saying you have to move in."
“Fine,” Harry sighed. He placed his mug on the coffee table, allowing it to steep. “You can keep me company then.” He gave the clock a fleeting glance although he didn’t concentrate enough to actually read the numbers. “I probably won’t be going back to sleep anyway.”
If it meant they could stay in this moment forever, Draco would cast any spell or take on any curse. Especially if it meant the next day would never have to come.
“She’s very supportive,” Harry defended quickly. “All of the Weasleys are, really. Hermione and Ron always ask how Draco is in their letters.”
“Look, I’m not asking you both to be friends with him. I’m just… I don’t know, I want to help him. He doesn’t really have anyone, and I know what that feels like.” They both sat back, making a pair of affronted noises. “I mean before I met you two. All I had was my cousin, and he was horrible, and he made everyone else act horrible, too. I can’t just let that happen right in front of me.”
Ron sighed. “Honestly,” he pressed, “a few months ago, I’d probably say yes, just because it’s Malfoy,” he added quickly, seeing the unsteady look on Harry’s face, “but he’s not the same. Or, maybe we’ve finally just gotten to know him. He’s not as bad. So, it’s up to you.”
“He was in love with my mum.”
The blush on Draco's cheeks became even redder as his eyes widened to the size of bludgers. "What? No! Of course not, those were just examples."
In addition to Slughorn, Draco had decided to try to get Madam Pince to soften towards him. She was the person he saw the most, other than maybe Hermione Granger. He didn’t even try to fool himself into thinking he could ever appease Granger.
The executioner… Walden Macnair. He had a tattoo on his chest. Draco brought one of the photos closer, squinting his eyes at the wrist of what he was pretty sure was a woman. It was a round open shape, like an unfinished drawing of a keyhole.
“Potter.”
Harry glared at him harder than he ever had in his life – which was saying something considering their past. He was trying to will him to shut up about it without having to risk an unsteady voice. Sadly, Malfoy had practice ignoring such looks.
It had been two years since the war. Things were good. Ron and Harry were Aurors, and Hermione was still fighting for house-elf rights, now from within the ministry as part of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. It was everything he had wanted for them after the war.
,” Ron lamented as if Harry had forgotten that particular fact.
“I only got Narcissa and Draco off,” Harry corrected. He made sure to keep his voice as low as humanly possible and hoped that now was not the time Malfoy finally decided to look up―or that he could read lips. “Lucius still has another year before his case is re-evaluated.”
He cleared and scrubbed the whole flat in one evening. Harry attempted to get him to settle down when it started to get later but he would continually get up to fix something else until Harry just gave up. By midnight, Harry simply grabbed sleepily muttering Draco and took him to the bedroom. Without any ulterior motive, Harry held him throughout the night. For nearly an hour, he could feel the other man still buzzing to get up and do something but Harry refused to let him skip out on sleep.
“Is that Harry?” a familiar, muffled voice came from the other room. Soon, two heads were popping through the doorway. “Harry!” Thankfully, Harry knew that bushy hair without having to look at her face, not getting the chance before she threw her arms around him. “I feel like it’s been so long!”
“Then put on proper clothes.”
Nevertheless, Harry decided to walk to the flat after visiting Kreacher, taking the longer route which went past Allure. The club hadn't changed in the last few months, its rainbow flag still flying high. Men were just beginning to queue up outside as the evening grew closer. Its patrons hadn't changed much either. They were still unique in their own way; no one fitting perfectly into the stereotype that was shown on the television.
“We got detention because you couldn’t resist telling on us.”
“Wait, you’re still it!” Maggie called after him.
Kreacher looked a bit offended that Harry was going out once again but not at all surprised. Harry didn't linger on it. He jumped up the stairs to the second floor where his room was and stripped into some muggle clothes.
The moment Harry was out of sight, Draco’s perfect posture fell aside. He shrunk back into the chair. Ginny watched carefully from the kitchen. She’d never seen Draco Malfoy look so…fragile. She couldn’t believe something as simple as Harry’s presence could have altered it but that seemed to have been the case.
“Oh, yeah! Of course.” Harry moved out of the way, allowing Malfoy into the room. He was just about to close the door when he noticed Dean passing by with a wavering smirk and a curious eye.
“Oh, right,” Draco crossed his legs under the covers. “Well this is how I always used to sleep and in that week you were gone I realized how much I missed it. Besides, you’re right, it has started to get a lot hotter. You don’t mind, do you?”
He had sat down before he opened the book today but he noticed something nearly right away.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine. Do whatever you want, but I suggest reading the directions.”
A long sigh left Ron’s mouth. He shook his head, not able to even mutter a response. Harry got upset if an innocent got a nosebleed they didn’t have before he got there. If this girl died on this day, it would wreck him.
“I was just trying to be nice,” Harry urged once more.
In the beginning, it wasn’t too troubling. The first night had actually been a great test of Draco’s will more than anything. Drunk Harry Potter lost many of his inhibitions and therefore became shameless about his hunger for touch. It was never anything obscene. For the most part, Draco found himself squashed into the corner of the couch with Harry pressed against him, their hands intertwined.
What did he do in all that time? The thought of staying two consecutive days in Grimmauld drove Harry mad. Harry might not be a big people person, but at least he liked to feel the sun on his face or stop at the pub to listen to whatever sport was in season at the time.
Thankfully, nothing got on the 'expensive' sofa before he was brutally attacked. Malfoy pulled up the cushion from behind his back and tried to defend himself. The pair of men wrestled for several minutes. Laughter and taunts were ringing in the air. It stopped only when Harry began to fall off the sofa. Malfoy was no help, trying to speed up the processes.
The boy who the elf stood beside began to move as well. A green light flashed across Cedric Diggory’s handsome marble face. For a moment, Harry was standing in that graveyard again, looking down at Cedric’s dead body beside him.
She scoffed, her eyes lingering on the door. “I would normally say otherwise, but I can see you’re well taken care of.” Her eyes flitted back to him. "In more ways than one."
This time both Harry and Hermione gave him a hard look.
His hair still mussed and practically calling out to be fixed properly, he dropped down beside Harry. It was only when the hand that was still in his own gave a squeeze that Harry finally looked away.
He scoffed. “I’m sure you have. You’re probably good friends considering how many Death Eaters you know.”
Ms. Craft’s eyes flitted to the grandfather clock at the end of the hall. “Barmy, is it that time already? The kids haven’t had lunch yet.”
Harry frowned. It didn’t look like nothing but, for once, he had no urge to upset Malfoy. It was quite amusing seeing him wriggle about.
He was about to put the letter and the book back but stopped abruptly. He had nothing else to do really. It was unlikely the stranger would return to this book now, but why not. It was something to do.
Malfoy smirked. “See, I told you I knew you. You’re far too boring to like blokes.”
“Where are you going?” Teddy called from behind him, pulling out from among Ron and Hermione. “Can I come with? I just got here.”
Before Zabini could open his mouth again as he planned to do, Harry spoke, “Shove off, Zabini. No one was talking to you.”
“Wait, Harry!”
Molly came to the rescue before it could get out of hand. “Teddy, dear, would you like to help me add the last touches to Harry’s cake?”
Andromeda appeared to consider his question for a moment before giving a stiff nod.
He watched as Draco pulled open the drawers of his dresser. “Do you think I’m stealing his clothes too?” He went to the wardrobe and threw open the doors. “What about his Auror uniform? Do I have some evil mastermind plan for that? Does it require his toothbrush because that’s in the bathroom too?”
"Her and your father?" Harry asked, popping open a box to check what was inside.
Malfoy’s hand began to loosen and Harry felt a bolt of panic through his chest. He dropped the sleeve to grab onto Malfoy’s arm instead. “I don’t have any ulterior motives, I swear. I just want to put the past behind us.”
