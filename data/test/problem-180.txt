Draco did as Potter said. Took a quick shower and then dressed warm for the trip. He was wondering whether he should tell his father about his arm or not. A Unicorn was involved here. He should be careful with this information.
It was about an hour past bed time and Potter hadn't joint him in his bed yet. Draco stood up and entered the White Room. Potter was lying in the bed.
"Out." Draco looked back at him.
"Yes." Draco rolled his eyes and resumed walking.
Draco didn't like his mother's smile and her words. She had to be on to something. He looked at his father and Lucius gave him a pitying look with a touch of resignation and a bit of horror. Draco swallowed his meal with effort. His mother was definitely on to something. Had she threatened Potter? Anything? What?
"Well…you can…" Draco bit his bottom lip, looking hesitant.
"Out where?" Potter put the sweet back into its box.
Draco was very, very curious about all of the sudden interest his former enemy was giving him.
"I-I'm not riding that thing!" Draco refused, "Why not fly with broomsticks? O-or Apparate there?"
"Um, h-he hit me?" Potter stared at him, frightened by the blond's murderous eyes.
"Ah, Potter, Malfoy. Did you need my assistance?" McGonagall asked.
I know. I'm suck at bed scene.
"What? What did I do?" Draco pulled the boy off of his neck and studied Harry's face.
"Oh, it's nothing, Darling. We just chatted." Narcissa smiled innocently. "He's a good boy, Draco dear."
"Potter, I want a word with you." Draco stood up.
"Okay." Potter replied, eyes glued to the Death Eaters.
Draco sighed and walked into the Secretus Prisma, where the sixteen students of the Eighth year lived. He couldn't talk to Potter about it in their common room without risking being heard by the rest of the Eighth-years.
"My eyes!" Lucius cried repulsively and dashed out, probably to the master suite to wash his eyes and curved into ball hiding beneath the sheets.
"Very good, then." McGonagall nodded and Draco and Potter walked out of the headmistress' office.
Hasty steps echoed through the corridor. A familiar sigh caught Draco's ears and he stepped out of the darkened alcove before the entrance door of their new chambers.
"Hm?" Draco caressed the boy lying against him.
"What? When did he move here?" Slowly so as to not waking the dark-haired boy, Draco turned his body fully on his right side. He eyed the messy dark hair before his face. Thinking about it now, Draco knew the boy must have moved to his bed sometime in mid-night, most likely because of a nightmare.
Bloody hell! He had Harry Potter in his arms! In bed!
Both boys entwined together. Bodies were dancing like snakes, bending against each other. Moans and gasps echoed alternatively between kisses and frictions. Naturally, in brief moment the acts built physical reactions; a result of pent-up emotions they'd repressed for too long. Draco manoeuvred their bodies so he was now hovering Harry.
The conversation was interrupted by the other two of the Golden Trio peering out their chambers.
When he was back to the bedroom, he heard a soft knock on the door. Draco opened his door but saw no one. Then something pushed him backward and it shut the door.
"Oh, drop the formality, Harry. What are you doing here?" Minister Shacklebolt walked beside Potter, behind Draco who was leading the group toward the Manor.
It was a sweet addiction, forbidden pleasure, feeling Harry inside, connected as one. As Draco's movement accelerated in its speed, pressure and depth, their bodies danced together, forgetting the world and only them were exist. Paradise sensation in every sensory promised them that it wouldn't be their once nor last time to do such intimate act together.
Potter tilted his head, looking at Draco's face curiously.
"Um…yep." Potter kept walking.
"Here." Draco handed Potter the Quidditch magazine.
"That's not it! I just don't want to have an…argument with her. She- she's Ron's sister." Potter added softly, "Her family been nice to me."
When they arrived at their chambers, Potter turned his body fully toward Draco.
Draco checked his pocket watch. It was six in the morning. He had Charms at nine. He could have visited the library before Charms and do the research, but he didn't like to waste his time for it. Unless…
"I was waiting for you until two in your room, but you didn't show up. And you didn't take your lunch at the Great Hall." Potter waved the map again. "So, I was looking for you with this and found you in the forest."
They both stared at each other.
with his wand. The cave wasn't that deep, but it was narrow. They both had to duck their heads.
"The ring, Potter." Draco answered in annoyance, rubbing his forehead.
"I need it back. My mother's wand isn't really…compliant to me. It doesn't give the desired result when I use it to cast complex spells."
Three hours passed and Draco still couldn't sleep. His mind kept replaying Potter's horrible memories. Why had Potter never reported the abuse? Did his friends know about it? Did Dumbledore know about it? Mr. Hero, always keeping everything to himself, didn't he? Draco remembered when Potter said that he liked being in Draco's arms. Now he understood that it wasn't a playful statement. Potter never had someone to comfort and protect him ever since he'd been left with his Uncle and Aunt. It was always the other way around for the boy; he was always the one to protect and save others. Other people's wellbeing were his priority.
"Well, I grabbed it from his hand when we tried to escape from the manor." Potter said.
Tuesday passed with a successful 'avoid-each-other' mission. So did Wednesday.
"Potter, we're Malfoys. We do show off." Draco smirked at the gaping Potter. "Besides, it's enchanted so it can only carry sustenance-related things here."
Render box/bless box: made up magical box. I'm so fancying the Vanishing Cabinet.
"I…I…we better get back to Hogwarts. It's almost dinner time." Draco turned around and began to walk toward the castle but stopped as Potter tugged his sleeve.
Oh, and a self note; Draco would forgive Blaise and Pansy if the book they sent him comes in use today.
"Here, try this one." Draco offered the dark-haired boy his truffles box.
Potter sweat-dropped.
"W-what matter, Malfoy? Can we talk later? We're about to miss breakfast." Potter tried again to reach the door.
"How did you know that I was here?" he asked the dark-haired boy instead.
"I can borrow my father's wand." Draco stared down at the emerald eyes. He noticed that they were only several inches below his. So the dark-haired boy had grown now. Potter's view line which had been on his pointy chin was now level with Draco's mouth.
"How did…When…" Draco looked down at his leg and his tailored trousers were none to be found. He noticed Harry had also lost his jeans.
"You can have one of my other beautiful rings, Potter, if you want. But not that one. It's…ah, supposed to be for my…uh…intended one." Draco scratched an imaginary itch on his forehead to hide his blushing face from Potter.
"All right." Draco raised both his hands. "Not taking lunch?"
Draco raised his brows and the Gryffindor took it as a yes. Potter slipped on Draco's left side. Since Draco sat at the very edge of the seat and the other Slytherins always made a space with him, Potter squeezed between Draco and a fourth year Slytherin boy. A plate popped before Potter and the boy proceeded to serve himself a dinner.
DRACO MALFOY
'Tomorrow' came and Draco had to try his best to keep calm at breakfast.
"You're not alone, Harry. Well, not anymore now." Draco kissed the boy sweetly. "I know you live alone at Grimauld Place. Look, Harry, I have the whole left wing of the manor to my own. And after living for seven years at Hogwarts dorm with loads of annoying companion every single day, I kind of…feel…it's uh…" Draco was well trained in diplomacy and negotiation. Why the bloody hell was it so difficult for him to tell Harry what he wanted?
Draco stood frozen. All eyes focused on him and then fell to his cauldron. A pair of Seventh year Hufflepuff boys even had the bravery to move toward his desk and check the content of his cauldron.
Draco blinked.
"Later, Potter. I'm in hurry now!" Draco passed the boy and saw Potter walk beside him.
"Good night, Potter." Draco slipped beneath his covers and turned to his side, facing the wall. Didn't bother to close his curtain manually.
"Nonsense! Need I remind you, Potter, that you are different—I mean you are a special case. You've been under the Dark Lord's control for almost your whole lifetime, but you killed him. Now you should have the right to lose control and do whatever you want. So bollocks everyone else!" Draco hissed. Draco thought that the other boy would get mad or deny everything he had said, but instead Potter giggled. Giggles that then morphed into full-blown laughter.
!" And, again, a huge silver shadow burst out of the tip of Draco's wand, fading away in seconds.
"What is it? Malfoy, are you all right?" Potter asked in a panicked voice.
"Come on, they're harmless." Potter waited for Draco beside the Thestral.
years house was plain without any of the Hogwarts Houses' attributes. The only entertaining decoration was the clear glass prisms, in the common room and the hallway, that refracted and dispersed natural light into waves of crystal-clear illumination. Exactly the lighting concept Draco fitted to his private cottage. Draco wondered if this floor had been used to keep Hogwarts guests. The elegant prisms decoration really was an impressive sight.
"I'm so sick and tired of them wanting to talk to me about the war and I'm a hero thing and..."
"Nobody should know that I can fix your wand."
As soon as he got to his room, Draco wrote to his parents about his wand and other things.
Draco returned to his room when dinner was eaten. He'd just wait for Potter to join him there and then he'd ask him what had happened today.
The silver Wyvern flew around the stunned boys before vanishing.
Draco heard a
Draco walked straight to his room, leaving a pouting Potter to his friends in the common room.
"All right then, if you want to be useful, allow me to change your appearance…a bit," Draco said to the Elder Wand. He must look really stupid talking to a wand. Draco breathed in deeply and closed his eyes. He started to think about his own wand. The shape, the color, the texture. He opened his eyes and whispered a charm.
"No. It's just that, he's been gone since last night. He wasn't in the Great Hall at breakfast, so we visited his room but his cold bed told us that it wasn't used last night. And, um, since he walked out of the Great Hall right behind you last night, we thought maybe you noticed where he was going after dinner?" Granger bit her bottom lip, obviously worried.
"Don't forget to wear your warmest outfit tomorrow," Potter told the blond. Draco raised his eyebrow, but Potter gave no elaboration to his words. Potter put his glass on the desk, beside Draco's. The Gryffindor touched the parchment with his wand. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," Potter whispered. At once, thin ink lines began to spread from the point Potter's wand had touched. Then the empty parchment showed them their chambers. Potter sighed at the map.
Draco widened his eyes.
"Hm? Why would I do that to my own son? And why are you asking? Is there something you're hiding from me, Draco?" Narcissa raised her eyebrows.
As they began the class, Draco noticed most of the students couldn't cast their
"I can ask for any food I want, Potter." Draco grabbed a delicious looking green apple.
"Potter, wait! Don't be so hasty! One of them is an Auror. What makes you think that if the Minister sends Aurors here, there won't be other Death Eaters among them?" Draco hissed. He walked toward his father and handed his wand back to him. He then released his mother from the spell and handed his mother her wand.
Walking toward the dungeon, Draco took a long route to the Advanced Potions classroom, avoiding crowded hallways. There were a lot of students who looked at him as a traitor and an ex-Death Eater. Many of them blamed him for the death of people who contributed to the battle. Be it on the good side or as Death Eaters.
"Potter your neck is cold. Why are you not wearing the scarf?" Draco frowned at Potter. At those words, Potter clenched his jaw. "Potter? What- where's my scarf?" Draco knew the difference between Potter's annoyed frown and confused frown, and that had just been anger. Potter averted his eyes from Draco's and the blond sensed magic beginning to bubble from Potter's body.
Draco smelt something fishy. He wanted to read Potter's mind, but he had promised. So he slipped under the covers and joined Potter.
"Incredible!" the open-mouthed Professor Dakarrt exclaimed, staring at Draco's
"Is your blood poisonous?" Draco asked the Unicorn.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes, but they were stuck onto that emerald gaze. Those green eyes were staring at him in awe and admiration. Draco tilted his head, searching for the meaning of those expressions. What made the other boy looking at him with such obvious emotions?
And in the next moment, they were flying up into the cold air, faster than on a Firebolt.
Harper marched past him, brushing Draco's shoulder with a force that caused Draco to trip and bump into the window glass with a hard thud.
, leave the detention and transfer eighty points from Gryffindor to Slytherin." Draco heard protests from the Gryffindors, especially from the Weasleys. None came from Potter.
"W-what? I haven't even said the incantation!" Draco's brow furrowed, looking at the Elder Wand as if it had done something wrong.
"But it happened to Hermione and Ron. They couldn't have been pretending that I hurt them." Potter lifted his head abruptly. "I'm…damn it! I can't control my magic when I'm mad. It's leaking out from me. I hate this stupid magic! No matter what, I always cause harm to everyone around me. Why does this all have to happen to me? I just want to be normal! I'm tired, Malfoy. I've had enough." Tears were threatening to fall from Potter's emerald eyes again.
"Oh, Merlin, I'm sorry! Malfoy, I'm so sorry I didn't meant to—" Potter released Draco's shoulders and stepped backward. He looked completely panicked and was staring at Draco in horror. With a deep crimson face, Potter ran away from Draco.
Potter gasped.
"Perhaps if you spent a bit of time really paying attention to his wellbeing, he wouldn't have to feel abandoned and avoid you." Draco told the two of the Golden Trio in contempt, then stood and left the common room for his own room. He knew his words would trouble Potter, but he didn't care because he was angry with Potter's friends. And whereas he had been in a great mood all day, he was suddenly in an acidly foul mood.
"What did you say, Potter? I didn't catch it." Draco leant forward unconsciously.
"What?" Potter was surprised, apparently didn't think Draco would be that desperate to try it himself.
"What the hell is happening with my arm?" The flow of the cold water didn't soothe his skin.
Today's class ended at four fifteen. Draco hoped his eagle owl would be back by dinner.
When they arrived outside of their chambers, Draco stopped Potter.
And they both laughed.
"Hm, well, how about we do it together?" Draco suggested.
Draco stepped forward and took the three pieces of his wand and the velvet green pouch. He put the pieces into the emerald green pouch and left in silence. Potter saw him walk back to his room, which was at the far end of the boys' side of the chambers.
The dark wizard with his wand on Draco grabbed him and then the four intruders began to Apparate, with Draco siding-along. But they couldn't Apparate because of the manor's wards.
"What's that?" Draco asked.
When Draco arrived at his spot in the forest, he wasted no time in starting to practice his
Or maybe he shouldn't try to do damage the legendary Elder Wand.
Now that hurt Draco. Especially the repulsed look that Potter gave him, though he tried to hide it.
"Oh. I'm sorry I didn't know… Oh Merlin, does she know? Is she mad at you?" Potter resumed taking the ring off of his finger and Draco had to grab his left hand to stop him.
"You healed!" Draco exhaled in relief. A second later he felt something hard nudged his back. He looked back and
"I don't know. I didn't see her!" Potter was trying hard to stop blushing.
Draco was startled when Slughorn made a comment about his brewing.
At the mention of relatives, Draco reminded of the cruel muggles that had violated his Harry in his childhood. He would search information about the muggles and make a malicious visit in the future.
"Right." Draco felt himself flush. "My personal belonging…"
A sudden silence took Draco's attention from his plate. He looked up and saw the cause was none other than Potter walking toward Slytherin table. More specifically, toward where he was seated.
The former headmaster's portrait was asleep in his armchair. He opened his eyes after McGonagall called him.
"I see you have your point, Malfoy. Well, in your condition, I know it will be difficult to find you a wand. Have you talked to your Head of House?" McGonagall asked. She gazed to the sleeping ex-headmaster portrait, Albus Dumbledore.
As planned, Harry Apparated outside the manor gates at eight sharp where Draco had been waiting impatiently. Immediately Draco grabbed Harry and Side-along him and Disapparated to his cottage before his mother spotted Potter from her window.
"Oh, thanks!" Potter gratefully took the offer.
"Potter, wait!" Draco ran and gripped Potter's arm. A shock came over them both. Over Potter, because Draco had approached him and touched him. And over Draco, because Potter's magic was creeping along his body, making his stomach flutter and causing tiny bite-like sensations on his skin as he touched the Gryffindor.
"Just go! Hurry, before the headmistress puts the castle on quarantine!" Potter encircled Draco's waist with his arms.
Draco felt something heavy on his thigh and something squeezing his right arm.
"Come in, Potter." Draco opened his room's door for the bewildered boy standing before him. Hesitantly Potter came inside the room. Draco threw his bag to the desk. It landed with a mild thud. He proceeded to free himself from his robe and then opened his trunk and pulled out a box the size of a Care of Magical Creatures book. He hopped onto the unoccupied bed, which was near the desk and the door. He put the dark wooden box on the bed in front of him where he sat with his legs tucked in.
As he arrived at Hogwarts, Draco walked straight to the headmistress' office and told her about his activity of the day, and of the next. Though he had been checked up by the Head of Aurors and the Unspeakables and was protected against the effects of the dark artefacts, he wanted to make sure he didn't bring any harm to Hogwarts and asked the headmistress to check him again. After they were both certain he was clear from any dark magic, Draco visited the Great Hall for dinner. He was glad to find the students were so busy talking about their visit to Hogsmeade that yesterday's issue didn't arise. He spotted Potter at the Gryffindor table, looking agitated. What now, Draco asked himself mentally. Returning to his plate, Draco ate his dinner with intent; he'd spent so much energy at the manor without break that now he was starving.
"What do you mean you didn't have enough food when you were little?" Draco stopped tapping his fingers.
"So, Harry, how have you been?" Dumbledore's portrait made no movement in his armchair.
"I am so a hundred and seven percent sure and ready. I want you, Draco." Harry held the boy above him tight.
"Come up, Potter! Let's play one on one!" Draco yelled from the air.
Potter turned his head to Draco and looked up at him, smiling like a fool. Draco looked down at him, lifted one of his eyebrows elegantly, and then smirked back at Potter.
Potter was his rival, check. Potter was his…enemy? Okay, check on that because of his father. Potter was an insufferable git, check. Potter was stupid, check. Potter was naturally charming, check. Potter had beautiful eyes, check. Potter with his rosy cheeks and red lips. Potter with his attractive shaggy, messy dark hair. Potter WAIT A MINUTE!
"Do you want to go for dinner?" Draco eyed the dark hair boy. Potter glanced at the map. "Right." Draco put away their magazines and took the bless box – as Potter called it – from his trunk and then returned to bed. Draco smiled when he saw that Potter's eyes were gleaming with joy.
"They said we are all grown up now. I understand that they need more time alone. I don't mind at all. I've told them. But Ron keeps saying that I was selfish because he said I got spoiled and got too much attention from people around me my whole life. He said I couldn't expect them to always be by my side to look after me all the time. I didn't want any attention, Malfoy. I don't want it at all. I never demand anything from other people. I hate that people thought I was fragile. I hate all their fake admiration and care. I'm not that stupid and that blind that I'm not able to see that they only see me as a tool to keep their Wizarding World safe, Malfoy, I don't understand…I…" And Potter broke into tears.
"Then why not destroy it?" Draco asked again.
"It's mid January, Potter, if you forgot. Of course it's cold. Especially when you're not wearing any outers." Draco blinked. It was as if he'd only just realized the dark-haired boy's condition. Draco studied the Gryffindor, checking him up and down. Potter wore only a brown T-shirt with green patterned flannel and a pair of black jeans. Nothing more. But Draco had to approve that the clothes complimented the dark hair's emerald eyes and his unruly dark hair.
"Er…I'm going to the Quidditch pitch. Bye, Malfoy." Potter left before Draco had a chance to inform him that it was snowy outside.
"So, we will go somewhere tomorrow, right? When will we go?" Draco asked Potter.
He had a new wand.
"I don't want to give it another reason to be violent, Potter." Draco vanished the plate nonverbally and then pulled out a plate of a big piece of treacle tart from the box.
"Er….yeah?" Potter bit his bottom lip. Draco resisted the temptation to roll his eyes.
Potter's emerald eyes were really beautiful.
and the room was illuminated brightly, Draco's heart almost jumped out of his mouth. He calmed down as he stared at the emerald eyes and recognised them quickly as Potter's. Draco inhaled deeply and exhaled hard a few times until he was completely calm, though his body was still shaking.
Harry labouring breathes, inhaling and exhaling closed eyes. Slowly, his grips on Draco were loosened and opened his emerald eyes on Draco's silver ones. "I'm ready."
"Stop, Loopy! Tippy, please come to Hogwarts and inform me if other Death Eaters attack the manor again." Draco asked his house-elf.
!" Draco stunned the three dark wizards. "Father, are you all right?"
Taking a big breath, Draco raised his wand. He began to make spiral movement with his wand right above the cauldron. Vaguely he heard the class hold their breath as he did so. Draco whispered the incantation word while moving his wand.
Tch, they must be covering Potter now, so he couldn't confront him, Draco thought. How predictable.
"But what does that mean, Professor?" Potter voiced Draco's silent question.
"Potter," Draco spat the name, "How you managed to not see me ever with your glasses is beyond my logic."
with wide eyes. "In a single week, Malfoy! And I've never found this creature in corporeal form before!"
It was freezing cold outside, especially in the flat, empty spaces, where winter winds could have frozen an owl. Draco wrapped his dark green robe tighter about his body, his eighteenth's birthday present from his parents.
." Potter stood waiting in front of him.
"Can I come in?" Draco tried to make his voice steady. The boy before him looked a mess. Draco started. When Potter just stood there and didn't let him in, Draco pushed the other boy gently and stepped into the room. He noticed that the room permitted him to enter without its owner's approval. Had Potter set the ward to let Draco in, just like what Draco had done to his room to allow Potter to enter his room? "Tell me what happened."
Draco glanced at Potter, waited until Potter glanced back at him and then Draco walked toward his room.
"Night, Malfoy." Potter bid softly. He took off his shoes and put his spectacles and Draco's scarf beside the pillow, and then slipped under the covers.
"Uh, I guess I need to get ready for the next class." Potter bolted up and ran out.
"You ran away from your own room. To my room," Draco dead panned.
"You have plans today, Draco," Narcissa said, more a statement than a question, as she buttered her bread.
Saturday morning came and Draco forgot all about Hogsmeade. But that didn't matter anyway. He had planned to practice the Patronus Charm. He had to master it today! Or tomorrow at the latest. He had a lot of good childhood memories. Like, their parents reading him books before bed when he was toddler. Or when he got his first cauldron, a birthday gift from his father when he was seven. Or when he got his first broomstick and his father installed a Quidditch field at the back of the manor for him.
Draco watched what their
"All right. Have your breakfast, Malfoy." McGonagall returned to the Great Hall.
"Changed my mind. Minus breakfast and lunch is more than enough for me today."
Draco turned in his mother's direction. A wizard with an Auror robe wrapped around his body. The Auror pointed his wand to Draco's mother.
"It's been acting weird. When I tried to break it, it didn't crack even a bit. And then this morning I used it to repair Mrs. Malfoy's broken wand with it. It worked. And then when Malfoy tried to break the Elder Wand, it went berserk. It stung my hand when I held it, and it reduced Malfoy's broken wand to ashes. It kept shaking then. And then Malfoy took it and it stopped. We don't know what to do with it, Professor. I was afraid it would do damage if I just left it. So, we brought it here," Potter explained to Dumbledore's portrait.
"What is there to talk about? I'm busy, Granger. I-"
"What?" Lucius looked at his wife and son. "Are we expecting company tonight?"
"Not you, Potter. You are…" Draco shivered in full excitement and bewilderment. His eyes flickered as he continued and said, "An exception." Draco didn't give Potter any chance to speak. Soon as he finished his sentence, he pushed his tongue passed Potter's teeth and into that hot cavern; proceeded to stroke that addicting tongue of his.
," Draco said. "Nobody in this class, save some ex-members of Dumbledore's Army, is able to create a corporeal
"Oh." Potter relaxed. "I slept there until I was eleven. Malfoy are you really all right? You look like you've just seen a Dementor."
Draco was once again alone in his room. Potter had gone back to his own room with Draco's favorite scarf. The blond didn't ask the boy to give it back.
to send a message to Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister for Magic. Draco stopped Potter before the
Draco hoped nothing bad had happened to his wand.
"About what?" Draco gave her a questioning look.
"Potter, you DO have my wand, don't you?" After disarming Draco at the Malfoy Manor, Potter had mastered the blond's wand and used it during the Battle of Hogwarts. Since then, Draco had found that Potter was quite fond of his own wand, and he must be keeping Draco's wand somewhere in his trunk.
"Professor," Draco called out, "I believe I have the right to demand compensation from her."
around them before he asked the dark-haired boy's permission to tell McGonagall about his plan to fix Draco's wand.
"Of course. No more restriction for Eighth Years, I see. Potter, my wand." Draco raised his hand toward Potter.
"Thank you." Draco saw Potter give him a smile that looked sincere.
Draco's fingertips touched the spot where Potter's finger had touched him.
As he arrived in his room, Draco slammed the door closed, hoping that the Gryffindor boy couldn't override Hogwarts' magic and open his door. Draco then took off his robe, unbuttoned the cuff of his shirt and rolled up the sleeve. The skin on the Dark Mark's scar was crimson; including the mark itself, flaring an even deeper red. He hoped Icarus would return immediately to deliver a soothing vial he'd requested from his father.
"Er…I haven't thought about that…" Potter said sheepishly, now scratching his neck.
"All right." Draco released his grip on Potter. Once again, he caught Potter flushing and biting his lip.
"I set her free when I was seven." Draco raised his eyebrows, watching the uncomfortable Gryffindor.
"Oh, come on, Potter. You had treacle tart two days ago." Draco smirked when he saw Potter surprised that he knew exactly his thoughts.
"All right?" Potter leant down, offering his hand to Draco.
"Why do you always cause me problems, Malfoy?" he nearly shouted, looking hard at him.
"What?" Draco lifted his eyebrow.
"I'm fine Hermione. Tell you later." Potter nodded to her and resumed his strides.
he'd created.
"Oh, my uncle never gave me food unless I'd done everything they'd ordered right. If I got lucky, sometimes I'd get a meal in a day. Oh, hey, are they really peacocks?" Potter was now looking at the albino peacocks in the yard outside the window.
Draco and Potter walked toward the Great Hall leisurely. In Draco's case, he felt reluctant to gather with the whole body of Hogwarts. He always took a seat at the edge of the table, near the entrance doors. Coming in first and escaping just at the right moment to avoid unwanted attention. And when he could, he would skip meal times. Chocolates and sweets from his mother were enough to keep his form and remain nutrient-fulfilled. What about Potter? Draco knew the Boy Who Lived Twice didn't like the attention the world gave him. He could see all those gestures of discomfort in Potter when crowds were fussing over him.
"Draco, I think you forgot one thing," Narcissa spoke out.
Potter circled the bed and then took a seat before Draco, the box nestled safely between them.
They both arrived ten minutes late and graciously Professor Slughorn allowed them to enter the class.
Potter stopped beside Draco.
He needed to find Potter now!
At the end of dinner, finally Potter's-gang-minus-Potter had all gone and Draco stood up.
"I love you," Harry said in clear sound. Draco could feel his smile on his chest. "And I'm really hungry now."
"Miss Weasley!" shouted Professor Dakarrt. "What exactly did you think you were doing to another student! Detention tonight, Miss Weasley! And if I catch any of you having any act of impoliteness to others, the Headmistress will hold the responsibility of your detention!"
From afternoon onward that day, Draco locked himself in his room. He actually craved for socializing. But with whom could he do that now? Millicent could be an enjoyable company as she was almost like Pansy; entertaining, minus meany and bossy and nasty and cunning. Too bad Daphne clung to her side all the time. Draco just didn't really like her. She was always flirting with him. So, Draco ended up doing his Ancient Runes essay after he'd taken a shower, had a dinner from the Render box two hours later and then continued his study of the apothecary papers. Tired of reading after three hours, the papers finally finished, Draco went to bed.
"I want to see it!" Weaselette was pulling Potter's finger. "Take it off!"
When Draco finished his box, he unwillingly took out the apothecary papers and read them for two hours. A knock on the door took off his focus on the papers. He stood up and opened it but found no one.
"Don't you ever, EVER, say something again about me to everyone!"
"What? It can't be. He was marked!" Harper stepped closer to see Draco's arm.
"Well, Mr. Harper. I suggest you master the charm first before taunting others. And I suggest you clear off your cruddy mind before casting the spell. A dull light is not good, Harper. Continue, class!" Dakarrt clapped his hands and the class soon resumed the lesson. Some mocking giggles from other houses were heard around the class, causing Harper to turn as red as a tomato.
"I never really hated you either, Malfoy." Potter's emerald eyes meet Draco's warm and silver ones.
." Then Draco opened his eyes, and an enormous silver Wyvern erupted from the tip of his wand.
Draco heard the strain in the Gryffindor's voice. He spotted the Weasels and Granger not far behind them. The two boys walked fast, in silence.
"How long will she be waiting for you out there?" Draco stared at Weaselette's label.
"But that's unfair!" Harry protested one night. Draco had made a deal with the boy. A deal that Harry would only be allowed to sleep in Draco's room if he read a book of any NEWT subject for an hour every day. He could sleep in Draco's bed if he studied for two hours (unless he had nightmares). And he would get a nice snogging session with Draco if he could answer at least seven questions out of ten from him correctly.
"What?" Draco took a step backward, trying to stay far from the angry wand.
"Harry, my boy, would you mind telling this old man how you mastered the wand?" The portrait leant toward Potter. Potter blinked in confusion, but told the portrait anyway.
"Ah!" The portrait leant back against his armchair. "I believe there has been some misunderstanding all along, I see."
After what seemed like an hour practicing to no avail, Draco was starting to give up. He didn't know what was wrong. He had thought hard about all his Quidditch memories but still it didn't affect the charm. Draco was lowering his wand, feeling defeated, when he felt a warm body press lightly against his back and hands on his hips.
As soon as he was in his room, Draco banged his head on the door.
"I might be wrong, but I think that's none of your business, Weaselette." Draco stepped forward.
"Professor?" Draco called inquiringly after a few seconds of letting his Wyvern run around the class.
Draco straightened and then put his hands on the Elder Wand, ready to snap the wand in two pieces. Or maybe into more than two.
"What is going on here? Harry?" Weasel walked toward the centre of the crowd. At the mention of Potter, Draco spun around and walked to the crowd.
"Ha! No wonder you felt cold." Potter stretched.
"Harry!" Weaselette called out to Potter who was running toward Draco.
Draco sighed hard. What was to be expected from the conqueror of Dark Lord? he mumbled in his mind.
"Oh." Draco remembered his mother told him about the late Nymphadora Tonk last year. "And you, Harry, where will you stay?"
"It's been hurting as hell since Tuesday. And then last night was the climax." Draco stared at his arm.
by the Dark Lord at the manor. Killed by the Dark Lord because of his own idiocy.
"Potter. Thanks for the help." Draco opened the doors. "Though, you're not much help at all."
"But it can't be taken off his finger."
"Ron, I…?" Potter stared at Weasel in confusion.
Potter took a bite of it.
After checking each space on the ground floor, Draco walked smugly to an empty space on the piano room and then another wave of magic sparks brushed the air upward and formed grey-wooden spiral stairs. Both boys went up to the first floor.
"Hmm, maybe I should read the new edition of Hogwarts: A History. Who knows what else lurks along with the newly-revealed hidden chambers in Hogwarts." He proceeded to the bathroom.
"Seriously, Potter, why are we doing this? Is what we are searching for a wizard's place?" Draco started to feel numb. "This is ridiculous! How could you not know where the-"
"Oh, no. She's fine. We just talked about…stuff. About Hogwarts, Grimmauld Place." Then Potter added in a very low voice, "Me, you."
"W-what?"
"Harry?" Granger was holding the door.
"I can guess your life must be very simple, Potter."
"Um…dunno. Just…gonna walk around I guess. Need some fresh air." Potter looked away.
"W-what" Draco was taken aback.
A moment later two plates of delicious finger sandwiches and vanilla glazed apple cinnamon muffins were served before the two boys. They ate merrily.
"Yes." Potter confirmed.
with it."
"I love you, too."
"You saw—"
Merlin, Salazar, and whomever other great wizards ever existed, just great. He didn't want to have dinner at the Great Hall tonight.
"Honestly, Harry, you don't know him? He's the greatest potions master ever live in England!" Draco's eyes popped up.
A magical string once again whirled out from the wand's tip and twisted each of the pieces, trying to unite all pieces into one stick of a wand. The magic string, however, soon dimmed out and was gone. Pieces of the wand lay motionless on the ground.
Draco put his bag on the desk and freed himself from his robe. His attempt to lie on bed was interrupted by another sharp pain in his arm. Draco rolled his left sleeve up and the skin glared deep red as if it was burnt. Draco was holding back not to scream. It was so painful and hot. He darted toward the bathroom and ran cold water on it. The cold from the water didn't soothe the burning mark, but the cool sensation on the skin around it helped distract Draco from the pain slightly until it subsided. It took him about ten minutes in the bathroom. He dried his arm and rolled down his sleeve back down.
"Ginny pulled it off me and then threw it and…" And then she stomped her big foot on it. That was what Potter's magic was saying as it swirled around them restlessly.
"Mr. Malfoy, hold your step!" McGonagall called him from the staff's table. Draco turned to see the headmistress walking toward him. "Follow me, Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall walked out of the Great Hall, Draco following closely. When they were outside the Great Hall, the headmistress stopped and turned to talk to him.
"Oh Harry, I'm so sorry. I didn't….oh!" Granger sobbed in her hands.
"Long ago? How long ago?" Draco narrowed one of his eyes.
This time, their kisses were full of desire and intense emotions. The kisses were so full of want yet lingered in a string of connection to each other. They took their time exploring their true emotions and feelings and transmitted them within kisses. Kisses that were all and everything in eyes closed, because they felt them by heart.
"How about now?" Draco asked the dark-haired boy.
"Harry," Draco whispered into Potter's ear, and instantly the Gryffindor looked up at him with wide eyes. "Good. You're awake. Now get up!"
"Fuck the wait! I've been waiting for too long. So I won't pass this chance to have you. Draco, I. Want. You."
"What's this?" Potter read the title aloud: "World of the Dragons. What is it about?"
When they returned to Draco's wing, the blond yanked Potter into his room and threw the boy against the doors.
"Shut up, Weasley." Draco pulled Potter closer. "Come on, Po- Harry. I'm starving." And Draco dragged the other boy to the Great Hall along with him.
"Good luck with your NEWTs, dear." Narcissa hugged Draco and then kissed his forehead. And then she walked up to Potter and hugged him briefly, "You, too, Potter. Now, off you go."
Professor McGonagall had officially become Draco's favorite teacher that night. Though, Draco felt annoyed by the glare Weaselette directed at Potter for the whole dinner. But that wasn't important and definitely not worth his time. Instead he watched the dark-haired boy eating treacle tart eagerly.
"I don't want it, Potter! If it will bring me to death!" Draco bored his eyes into the wand on the bed between him and Potter.
"Um…I don't know. They're completely random. But I guess…yeah, it's not specifically them. Just me fighting bad wizards and sometimes…I dreamed that I was left alone by everyone…" Harry looked down.
"Get off of me, Tenebrus!" Draco yelled.
Draco studied the boy. Oh, he must be scared that Draco would see his ugly memories.
Again, a deafening cry came from the white Unicorn. Draco went pale.
Potter froze by his slip and Draco was startled by the words.
"He's faster than broomsticks, and I can't take any chances of being tracked by Apparating," Potter said patiently. "So, hurry up, Malfoy. We're gonna be making a long journey."
"See, it's supposed to be clear aquamarine!" said a Seventh year boy to his partner who looked sheepish.
"Sorry." Potter lowered his head.
"I said I'm fine!" Draco yanked his arm from Potter's grip and walked hastily toward his room, leaving Potter behind.
Losing support for his body, Potter lost balance and gravity pulled him down to the ground, bottom first.
"Enough! Don't waste time. Let's get him to the place and do the ritual." And the dark wizard nudged the tip of his wand into Draco's cheek.
Draco's eyes lingered on the dark-haired boy's Adam's apple's motion. And then slowly his silver eyes averted up toward the emerald ones which were wide opened.
"What?" Draco frowned, confused by the boy who was vibrating with laughter.
"Ah, the bless box!" Potter cried as Draco sat on the unclaimed bed and put it down between them.
"Yes, Master Malfoy, Sir. Loopy will punish himself for hiding." A second later Loopy was banging his head on the hard wall.
"My pleasure!" Potter bowed dramatically, one arm thrown out to the side, the other tucked in against his chest.
Harry Potter came into Draco's view.
"After Malfoy disarmed you, I took Malfoy's wand at the Malfoy manor. So the Elder Wand's ownership fell to me. Then Voldemort took it from your grave and he used it to AK me, but the spell counterattacked him and he died." Potter explained shortly but accurately.
"All right. What did my mother do to you today?" Draco leaned over Potter so the boy wouldn't turn away.
Draco gave the Ministry's owl a treat while he wrote a short reply, explaining that they could only transfer the artefacts from the Manor under his supervision. Therefore, it would be done on Saturday, when Draco was free. After the owl left the Great Hall to deliver his reply to the Ministry, Draco caught Potter giving him a questioning look. Draco lifted an eyebrow and gave the other boy a "not telling" face with a little smile. He broke eye-contact on hearing some squeals from his table. He looked down to the sixth year girls sitting at the other side of the Slytherin table. He rolled his eyes and sighed before standing up, and left the hall for the Charm class. What was wrong with the girls – especially the Slytherins – these days? Whenever he was around, they kept doing those stupid girl-things like gasping, squealing, blushing, stuttering, and Merlin knew what else. He knew he was awesome and perfect. But honestly, was he that irresistible that the girls had to gasp like they had asphyxia? It was getting worse this year than it had been before.
Draco scowled, but in truth he was very impressed by Potter's perceptiveness. He had only just figured it out after Potter had asked him the question.
"How did you know the password?" asked Potter, tilting his head to see Draco.
"And where are you going to?" Draco raised his eyebrow.
"And he will stay here with Draco until they return to Hogwarts, Lucius." Narcissa told her husband calmly, and shushed him when Lucius protested. Draco didn't understand how his once arrogant father could submit so easily to his wife now.
"Yes, I was looking for that. Now, if you don't mind I'd like to have it back, Harper." Draco waited for the boy to give him his bag.
There was nothing he could do in the common room, and since he definitely not intended to join the others, Draco walked to his room. He took a seat on the chair, pulled out a parchment from the desk drawer and dipped his quill into the vial of ink beside it.
"Let me see you cast your
"Are you expecting me to sit on the ground, Potter? Are you out of your mind?"
"Eighty points, Mr. Malfoy?" Professor Dakarrt took Draco's proposal into consideration. He seemed to be reluctant to agree.
"No. What are YOU doing here, with Malfoy?" Weaselette stomped toward the boys.
Potter tried to touch the wand again but the wand still refused its master's hand. With both hands, Potter forced the wand into his grip. With a grimace and moving quickly, Potter shoved the wand back to the crack. They heard a rattle sound from the crack and the next second, the cave shook mildly. But in seconds, the shake increased and without a thought, Draco fetched the wand from the crack and the shake stopped.
"She asked me if I liked you and I said yes." Potter answered quickly, closing his eyes.
"Put it down," Potter told the blond. Draco put his mother's wand on the ground. Then Potter pointed the other wand to it. "
"Of course he is. Your mother interrogated him the whole day." Lucius said and choked around a mouthful of food as his wife stomped hard on his foot.
"Um…you've been missing for two hours since the class ended." Potter scratched the back of his neck.
That was what Draco hoped for Potter to tell him anyway.
It took them until four thirty to finally empty the dark artefacts in the dungeon. There was only one object left. Draco brought Potter to the entrance hall, and holding a sealed box given to him by an Unspeakable, finally freed Potter from his ownership, instructing him then to take off the necklace and put it into the box. When the Ministry group finally left the manor, Draco spun onto Potter.
"Potter, that sounds suspicious." Draco furrowed.
"Harry!" Weaselette called.
"Harry! Ahh!" Draco buried deep inside Harry and the wondrous feeling and acknowledgment of claiming Harry completely brought Draco beyond to the white world and he collapsed on top of Harry.
"Tenebrus, will you get your head off of me? I need to go to the castle." Draco patted the Thestral's head from below hesitantly.
"Good night, Draco."
"You want me to stay with you." Harry straightened his body. Eyes sharp and straight to Draco.
"Um, P-Potter?"
"And what did you tell them about the house-elves?" Draco stood before Potter, only a foot away now.
"Probably. I believe the Elder Wand could fix your wand if it wanted to." Potter glanced at Draco. "It's a powerful wand, after all."
"Can I uh, go too?" Potter rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.
The incantation was called out and then from the tip of Draco's wand a mist of silvery light whipped out. After the silvery mist had disappeared, Potter spoke again, not moving from behind him.
, he didn't care. Potter gasping in delight. Potter burying his face into Draco's neck. Potter sleeping peacefully in Draco's embrace. Potter kissing him. Draco kissing Potter.
"I was practicing the Patronus Charm." Draco bit his tongue. Why on Merlin's name had he told Potter the truth?
"What are you doing in the forest anyway?" Potter brushed the dirt off his jeans.
"I didn't bring food here, Harry. So if you're hungry we must go back to the manor." Draco told the boy sat beside him who put his head on Draco's shoulder and playing with his ring. Draco himself was stroking Harry's hair. He liked putting his hand through the smooth dark hair.
Right as Draco's lips left Potter's skin, a knock on the door was heard. The next sound was Granger's voice called out. The two boys stared at each other.
Draco made a face, but soon enough he too was laughing freely. He would have gotten punished if his mother had heard the word come out from his mouth.
"Let's hurry. It could take a lot of time." Potter resumed his walk.
and he glanced to see the time.
' attitudes.
"Let me try it." Draco raised his hand toward Potter.
"What about it?" Dumbledore portrait asked.
"Are you kidding me, Potter? How can I come out there and show to the world that I have the Elder Wand in my hand? It's like 'Hey look, I own the Elder Wand. So come and kill me if you want it!', you daft git!" Draco pressed his fingertips to Potter's forehead. Potter grabbed Draco's wrist and lowered it from his face.
"You must attach to him an object of your personal belonging to complete the ownership, and I believe your scarf won't do." And though Narcissa demanded no explanation as to Potter wearing her son's scarf, she raised a meaningful eyebrow at him.
"We're not—"
He checked that the color was a perfect aquamarine like it was supposed to be. The next thirteen minutes he waited, leaning against the stone wall. His hands slipped inside his trousers' pockets. Draco took the spare moment as an opportunity to observe the class. Some pairs were still struggling with the bluegrass, some others looked confused by the directions in the book. He even noticed Granger's frustration and complaints to her partner about the right color of the liquid. And then his eyes fell to Potter. It looked like the boy had trouble with the brewing as he was tugging his hair every few seconds. Sweat drops trailed down from his face. Potter was checking the formula on the book while nibbling his bottom lip. Once in a while he had a debate with Thomas with his hand pulling his already messy hair. Draco's hand itched to bat the abusing hand.
"Potter, I don't know how you could manage to live as a wizard. We live in the world of magic. In case you weren't aware, magic can fix anything, including your eyesight."
"Use it. Return your mother's wand to her. I'm sure she needs it after all." Potter shrugged.
"Potter."
"Well, like Mother said, let's enjoy the holiday." Draco stood up and walked to the backyard. He took a Firebolt and a Nimbus 2001 from the broomsticks room and handed the latter to Potter. "I like the sky in spring."
Potter gasped. Draco liked that gasp. He put the plate before Potter, eyes gleaming.
"It's about Harry." Granger cut him.
Draco put his lips to Harry's. Closing eyes, feeling each other's heart deeply. Hands and legs and whole part of bodies sway drunk in harmony with the novel level of pleasure. Breathe was forgotten. Taste of paradise took their spirits high. The need of feeling content inside that could attain by the most intimate contact two persons could engage.
Saving the Gryffindor any discomfort, Draco pulled himself backward. He flung the strap of his bag on his left shoulder.
Draco didn't know what that was, but it felt really good. And he wanted to feel the sensation. He moved experimentally above Potter, but when he didn't get the effect he expected, Draco moved his body forward a bit until their hips were positioned at the same level, and then he tried to move again. This time he felt that pleasant sensation again. He heard Potter gasp. Draco looked down. What he saw added to his pleasure and to his desire for the boy beneath him. Potter was moaning, eyes closed, mouth open, face flushed. Draco lowered his head and planted a kiss to Potter's parted lips. The Gryffindor opened his eyes and stared up at Draco. Potter's hands stopped their movements and grabbed Draco's shoulders, pulling him down. When Draco had fully lain back against Potter, the dark-haired boy kissed him slowly and gently.
Potter inhaled Draco's scarf, lingering still around his warm neck. The innocent gesture stirred something inside Draco.
The next morning Draco woke up facing the wall. When he tried to stretch, his back touched something solid and warm. Draco snapped his head to see what was behind him, and found Potter's back.
"Ouch, Harry." Draco arched up, trying to bring his porcelain skin away from the nails.
Potter slipped his hand into his pocket and pulled out a tiny green garment. The boy then casted
"Let go!" Draco tried to free his arm from the dark wizard's grip. At that moment, the spell binding the petrified house-elf broke, overridden by the elf's powerful magic.
"She was very annoying. Always popped up loudly in my potions lab. She made me ruin the brewing so I tricked her to have my gloves." Draco stared at the emerald eyes intently.
"Er…right." Potter reopened his trunk and digging into the base of the disorganized trunk.
. The bright forms of a stag and a Wyvern hovered above them. The
"Why?" Draco waited patiently for the answer, but he never got any from Potter. "Um, Potter, you're talking about fixing my mother's wand, right? If you really able to fix a wand, why didn't you fix my shattered wand?"
(See the end of the chapter for
The last thing he heard vaguely before Draco slipped into slumber was Harry saying the three words to him.
"Yes." Potter stopped. "Right, I forgot. I don't know if this will work for you, but just trust me okay?"
"What what, Harry? We're not that clueless, you know. What with you sneaking into his room all the time." Weasel rolled his eyes.
"Why did nothing happen to you?" Potter frowned.
"It's time!" One dark wizard raised his arms up.
Draco narrowed his eyes. Something had definitely happened with Potter and his friends.
"I'm fine, Professor. There's something we wanted to ask. It's about the Elder Wand." Potter clenched his hands.
"Fine. I'll give you a chance to fix it." Draco moved to take his wand but was stopped by Potter.
Draco looked around the class. His eyes fell on Potter. The boy and Granger were assisting the professor to teach the class. Potter had been able to cast his
"Come here, Potter." Draco turned to his side and put his arms around Potter, who had already wrapped himself around Draco the second the words had left the blond's mouth.
"Well, I'm all right, aren't I? They're just weak and they overreacted. Daft people," Draco scorned. He hoped Potter hadn't noticed his previous shiver when the boy's magic had touched him.
"Mm…no. I didn't bring one to Grimmauld Place. Have plenty enough clothes there." Potter purred at the stroking on his hair.
Draco sighed for the seventh time. It was almost curfew and yet the one wizard he was waiting for still hadn't returned to the common room yet. He disliked being made to wait by anyone. He was sure Potter had no detention or Merlin-only-knew business tonight that would take up his evening.
"Mother! What exactly did you say to Potter on Thursday?" Draco finally asked his mother.
"Come on, Harry." Draco walked toward the house. He saw the other boy was following him behind, wide eyed and looked speechless. As they approached the house, the transparent wall exposed the living room on the right side, kitchen and the dining room on the left side, and a space with a grand piano in between. When they arrived at the entrance house, Draco opened a pair of glass doors and invited Harry in. Transparent glass walls were installed from the face of the house to the left side of the house, while the right side and the backside of the house were covered with blurry glasses walls. The whole impressive ground floor interior was designed in white with prisms installed around for the lights. Draco saw thin green rings of iris on Harry's eyes.
"But—" Potter moved one step backward, only slightly separating from Draco, since the Slytherin's arms were still anchored around Potter. Potter blinked. "You're…okay. Really, really okay! I don't understand. Why…How?"
Draco opened his door for Potter and the boy walked in. Draco then locked his door and casted a silencing spell – just in case the Weaselette decided to check every room to find Potter.
In this situation, and with the prospect of stealing points from Gryffindor, Draco could calm his anger quite easily. He concentrated on Potter – it was annoying for Draco, really, why it should be Potter of all happy memories he had – and when the warm feeling in his heart arose, he called out the incantation.
Draco thought about his childhood's happy memories. Slowly he felt the tense in his shoulders loosen.
He wrote to his father asking about the progress of his planning and plotting in taking over the Malfoy estate from the Ministry. His father had transferred all of his assets to Draco's name during the war so the Ministry couldn't seize them. But the Ministry hadn't given up in seeking a way to take control of the Malfoys' funds yet, and were using his father's condition as an open opportunity. And as he was of legal age now, Draco had full possession of the Malfoys' power to save their belongings from the corrupted Ministry staffs. And now he had to struggle alone, making correspondence with his solicitors to make sure his plans worked as he wanted.
"No." Draco lied.
"Patronuses are magical guardians, remember? Generally, they take the shape of the animal with whom you share the deepest affinity. So, in my case, my family protects me. I'm a Malfoy, and-"
Potter was still looking into Draco's eyes with his frightened ones. Draco wasn't sure if the boy was fully conscious and aware that he had awoken, or if his mind still lingered in the nightmare. Oh, bugger the animosity, Draco pulled the trembling boy into his embrace. Instantly Potter encircled Draco's neck and buried his face deeply into it, still sobbing with labored breaths.
Thinking that he didn't want to lose what was probably his only chance to fly out of Hogwarts' grounds, Draco signaled for the Thestral to take off. A second later, the beast kicked off the ground and diligently carried them to the manor.
"Oh! That! Merlin, Malfoy! I thought Voldemort came back to live! I-it – your arm – you – bloody hell you scared me to death, Malfoy!" Potter sat straight on the bed.
"It's dinnertime. Do you want to go straight to the Great Hall or do you want to go to your room first? We still have one hour before dinner tables are cleared." Potter clutched his wand still.
Draco loved numbers. They were absolute truth in the universe. Despite his sadness for the broken wand, he enjoyed the Advanced Arithmancy class very much that day.
Potter lowered his body and grabbed the Elder Wand from the ground, only to have his hand get an electric shock.
"Don't you dare do that!" Potter sat up abruptly. "Promise me, Malfoy!"
Draco awakened with something tickling his neck. His eyes snapped open when he felt something nuzzling against his chest. His whole body was warmer than usual. He looked down and had messy dark hair on his nose. Draco smiled and buried his nose into the hair. It smelt of apple and fresh meadow.
"Nothing. Let's continue walk. We're close." Potter nodded his head toward the west wing where their chambers were. "So, what did the headmistress say?"
Draco sipped his tea while Potter enjoying his dinner. Draco always found Potter eating like a starving man. It really was starting to annoy him. He should teach Potter table manners someday. So when Potter finished his dinner, Draco took the chance to ask.
"I know what you're thinking, Malfoy. So let me make this easier for us. We can walk together, Harper would think twice to hex you again, and nobody gets near me if I'm with you. It's a win-win solution," Potter said firmly.
The 8
After brewing for sixty-six minutes and six second, it was time to stir the potion with wand movement. Hopefully his wand would cooperate with him. For once, it did, and Draco was unbelievably relieved. When he looked around, he caught Potter's eyes. The said boy averted his eyes swiftly to his own cauldron when Draco caught him staring. Draco raised his eyebrow. How long the boy had been staring at him, was the first question to come to Draco's mind. His eyes lingered on the dark haired boy for a few seconds before he returned his gaze to his own cauldron.
"Do you really like it?" Draco asked when Potter rolled the ring around his finger. He watched the ring be slowly pulled to the tip of the finger and felt a pang at Potter's sadness. "I didn't ask you to give me the ring, Potter. Yet." Draco said quickly before the ring had slipped entirely from Potter's middle finger.
"Well, Potter, I should go back to my room now." Draco waited until the other boy stood up as well.
"Conceal it." Potter suggested.
"Mr. Malfoy?" Shacklebolt called. "Is there something wrong?"
At six o'clock they had dinner in the master dining room with Draco's parents. The whole time Lucius gave annoying stare at the ring on Harry's finger. Narcissa and Draco ignored him though and they talked conversationally about Draco's and Harry's training programs. When the dinner ended, Narcissa took Draco and Harry to the Receiving Room and talked about the Grimauld Place.
Talking about cool, Potter wasn't wearing his robe. Draco felt significantly disappointed at the lack of his green scarf on the dark-haired boy. The blood drained from his face as Draco realized he had just laughed freely in front of everyone. Bloody hell! Draco set his stoic face back to his face. However, when he took a glance down at Potter's face, he soon forgot to regret having displayed an emotion. Potter looked very pleased with the laughing Draco.
Potter didn't comment, because they were now only inches apart from each other's face. The Gryffindor looked like he was having trouble breathing. Draco looked down at the dark-haired boy, and Potter looked up at the blond. Draco remembered that he had something else to say to Potter but he couldn't think straight at the moment to recall what it was. For a second, Draco asked himself what was he at, but the question was forgotten the next second. All his attention was on the emerald eyes he was staring at. Having a chance to see them this close, Draco admitted to himself how beautiful those eyes were. Though now they were just green rings around the black, dilated pupils. So green, like his favorite color. So Slytherin.
Draco tried his best to make his question sound light. He knew it was a sensitive topic for Potter. Potter's expression darkened. He looked away. Knowing that Draco wouldn't let it go until he got an answer, he gave a big sigh and bowed his head.
. Since it was their first lesson in the charm, even a flyspeck of silvery-blue puff from the tip of the wand was considered an achievement. Harper looked aghast at the demand. His face was pale. Glancing at Draco who was still glaring coldly at him, he gulped and then raised his wand to cast the charm. Harper began drawing circles with his wand and called out the incantation. A vague string of dull light gathered from the tip of his wand for a brief moment, but lasted not even half a second before fading away.
"Well, ours is changing to that," the partner defended himself.
"Mm, it's Sunday. I wanna stay in bed all day," Potter mumbled, flopping onto his stomach.
"He's looking for trouble." Potter stood still beside Draco.
Magic still swirled around Potter. Draco didn't know what was going on, nor did he know what to do.
Draco checked his pocket watch. He'd been buried in that book for hours. Turning his head to look to his right, he saw that Potter had fallen asleep against the headboard. The book had slipped from his hands and fallen on the bed beside him. Draco considered waking him up and telling him to reposition his body and lie on bed properly, but when he saw Potter's face, sleeping in such peace, Draco couldn't wake him.
"Tenebrus!"
"Potter, are you so ignorant of this thing's use?" Draco snatched Potter's wand from its master's grip and pointed it to the startled boy. "
"Ginny, stop it!" Weasel moved toward his sister and yanked her hand from Potter. "That's enough, Ginny! Go to your room, now!" Weasel pulled her forcefully outside the corridor.
"Try again!" When Potter saw the confusion in Draco's face, he positioned himself back behind Draco, and put a hand on Draco's hip while the other raised Draco's wand-hand. "Try it again! This time, try harder!"
"Cool." Potter smiled wide at Draco and wiggled his eyebrows up and down. Draco laughed at the implication.
Harry followed Draco straight to his room. The rest of the night passed with random talk and ended with Harry sleeping in Draco's arms.
"What…" Draco's head was blank, he couldn't process what the dark-haired boy was saying.
"Wait! I'm coming with you!" Potter patted the Thestral and it crouched down to let Potter climb behind Draco.
"What do you mean? They never wanted anything from me." Potter sat up on the bed.
were doing in confusion. A second later his Wyvern moved and flew beside the stag and then they flew away and vanished. Simultaneously Draco and Potter glanced at each other from the corner of their eyes. Caught in what he'd hoped to be an inconspicuous move, Draco couldn't hold himself and chuckled. Potter followed, and soon enough they were both laughing out loud.
"You did it! It—it's…a…" Potter stammered.
"Thank you. Professor, you've heard about my mother's wand. I can't find any substitute wand at the moment, professor. Attending wand-work classes in this situation seems…non-productive if I may say so, " Draco said to the point.
"No, there… Here," Potter leant forward and then gently brushed the sugar powder just below Draco's bottom lip, swept from the corner of Draco's mouth with Potter's thumb.
"What the bloody hell is Potter telling her?" Draco stared at Potter trying to make eye contact. The dark-haired boy finally glanced at him and raised his eyebrow. Draco kept staring at him, as if accusing the other boy with just his stare.
being casted on the door.
"Harry, I…" Draco wanted him so much. To please him, to make him smile and laugh, hold him, be with him, claim him, take him. He wanted to say it to Harry, but he felt very exposed if he did so. Even before he voiced it, Draco felt himself exposed already. His body felt cold and hot at the same time. He felt exposed literally. Draco blinked few times. He looked down in few seconds and then looked up at Harry.
"Here is the letter, Master Draco. Is master Draco needs anything else from Tippy?" The house-elf goggled him.
"I planned to be a potions master." Draco slowed his chew of the muffin.
Draco awakened in the middle of the night and whimpering in pain. His left forearm felt as if it was being burnt by a Fiendfyre flame. It hurt so much that Draco couldn't hold the pain in. He bolted up and screamed in his bed.
"So Draco unwillingly handed you his wand." the portrait asked again.
"There have been words, too," said another girl. She pushed away her friend who was sitting between her and Draco, "that they were looking for revenge from the traitors."
"Tempting, Potter. Very tempting." Draco sat beside him, pointed his wand at the boy's forehead, and casted
"Potter, you sound very insistent to fix my wand." Draco saw Potter flush. "Oh, I see. Guilty feeling of a hero complex of yours."
"Not the way I thought you'd wake me up." Potter mumbled against Draco's chest. Draco loosened his arms and leaned backward to look at Potter.
"Oh, please, Potter. I didn't kill the white horse, if that's what you are thinking." Draco rolled his eyes. "I was in the forest on Tuesday. And then I saw the Unicorn. A branch jabbed into its leg. So, I helped a bit and when I pulled out the branch, the blood poured onto my arm."
"Hm?" Potter answered drowsily.
"P-Potter!" Draco didn't dare to move.
When they came back to their common room after that day's classes, Draco saw Ginny Weasley sitting on the couch.
Draco was bored. He was really bored! There was nothing left for him to do. He had finished all his potions and alchemy books. He was starting to get tired of hiding in his room. Flying was off the list. He wasn't on the Quidditch team. Therefore, there was no broom access for him. Should he study the Malfoy Apothecary papers then? Draco casted Tempus; it was dinnertime. He was so lazy to face everyone tonight. Guess dinner with another box of sweets was on the card then. He sighed and took a box of Rosewater-flavored Turkish Delight. Oh, Potter would have liked it. The dark-haired boy often chose it over other assortments.
"It's all right. You're awake now." Draco held the boy, trying to comfort him. He didn't tell Potter that it was just a dream again, because Draco knew it wasn't. From the boy's state, the nightmare seemed more like a memory, or a reflection of the loneliness that was Harry Potter.
"Oh, did you see his gob smacked face when he saw your wand?" Potter giggled into Draco's ear as they took the same desk. Draco flushed. Not because of anger, but because Potter had spoken so close to his ear. Draco almost shivered.
Without stopping their kisses, Draco felt Potter loop his waist with his strong legs. Potter pushed Draco down harder with his legs, his hand roaming onto the other's body. Draco was starting to feel numb from his arms beneath Potter; he moved slightly to allow the blood to rush back into his arms, and, when he did so, created a pleasurable friction between his body and Potter's. More specifically, where their southern body parts brushed against each other. Both of them gasped aloud at the sensation.
This Thursday passed without any incident for Draco. At mealtime, Potter joined him again. It seemed the dark-haired boy was still avoiding his Gryffindor friends.
Potter, who was opening his trunk, was surprised by the voice and practically jumped, closing his trunk in the process.
"What do you mean you can't fix it now? All you need is raise your wand, cast the charm and fix my wand." Draco made a face at the smaller boy.
"Secret, Potter." Draco whispered back. The boy's pupils were dilated. Draco was pretty sure his were, too. "I want to see your
Potter kept laughing out loud and Draco let the boy laugh until he'd lost his breath and stopped. When the boy finally sobered, Draco lifted an eyebrow, demanding an explanation. Potter only grinned at him in return. And before Draco had time to voice out his question once more, Potter's warm and plump lips were on his again. This time, it was Potter's turn to demand an open mouth from Draco. Granting it, Draco opened his mouth and instantly Potter was devouring his mouth. Feeling somehow like the whole event were crazy, Draco laughed into Potter's mouth. He felt Potter smile within kisses and a battle of tongues began.
"Why don't you try it to my wand?" Draco looked sharp into Potter's eyes.
"Come on, you can do it! Heal yourself!"
"Oh, for Merlin's sake!"
He opened his mother's letter and read it. Draco read it twice before he rolled the letter and put it inside the drawer.
After a moment of silence with blissful nothingness in his mind, Draco's ears caught persistent knocks on his door. Standing up from the chair, Draco checked his face on the mirror, making sure he was presentable. Draco walked toward the door. He opened it and found Potter standing before him.
Draco smiled at the boy's attitude. The blond positioned himself next to the dark-haired boy and started to read the potions magazine.
"I'll ask Aunt Andromeda to move there with Teddy." Harry saw Draco's furrow at the mention of Teddy, "Teddy is my godson and he's your cousin's son, Draco."
"Well well, if it's not the mighty Malfoy. Not gonna fight back, are you? Oh, yeah, I forgot. He has no wand," Harper sniggered to his minions. The three of them laughed.
"Potter, what is that?"
When they arrived, the Ministry group was already gathered outside the gates and judging from the taps of feet, they'd been waiting since eight o'clock.
"Who is he?" Harry turned his head to the side, looking at Draco.
"Minister! Good to see you, too." Potter smiled widely.
Draco yawned. He opened his eyes and stretched in bed. He stared up then sat up. He reached from beneath his pillow and pulled out a wand. His new wand. Draco stared at it for a few minutes. He still couldn't believe that finally,
"She refused to leave. Kept banging her head on my potions cabinet, broke some rare ingredient jars. Before she caused any more damage, I allowed her to stay at the manor and serve me." Draco left out the part where his father punished him because of that and he didn't get ingredient supply for a month.
"Uh…" Potter glanced at his two friends, "Okay."
"What?" Harry tilted his head a bit. Draco had the urge to roll his eyes again if only it wouldn't hurt his eyes.
"Tch, trouble, more trouble! Malfoy, drop the ward!" the Auror ordered Lucius.
"Thanks." Potter lowered his head and took the toast.
Draco got into position. He took a deep breath and started to cast the spell.
"Dumbledore! He owned it in his lifetime, so I think he'd know what's happening with his wand." Potter nodded in agreement.
"Never expected more from you, Potter," Draco spat, understanding well that Potter was avoiding the Weaselette. Again. "Can't handle a girl, can you, Potter?" Draco returned to the papers on the desk.
When Draco lay in his bed that night, he heard Harry grumbling in the other bed and then the curtain around the bed closed. Draco prayed that tomorrow Harry was in a good mood and had a sharp memory because he wanted to kiss the boy so bad!
"Oh, don't worry. Thestral is fast. I've rode once to the Ministry Department in no time. Up!" Potter waved his hand toward Draco.
At dinnertime that night, Draco got a letter from his parents, updating him about the captured ex-Death Eaters. Draco still felt uneasy with all this, but he reassured himself with the fact that her mother had her wand back and that he had ordered the manor's house-elves to paid attention to his parents' safety. Draco looked up from his letter and saw Potter was saying something to Granger. The bushy haired girl looked at him oddly.
"Oh my God, you're serious." Harry's eyes widened, his mouth opened wide.
At eight o'clock sharp Draco left Hogwarts and walked a few feet from the gates, away from the crowd of students, and then with a soft whoosh he Disapparated to the manor. His mother had waited for him in their entrance hall and accompanied Draco for breakfast. His father was already in the dungeon, waiting for the Ministry team.
"Yep," Potter said shortly.
"Seriously! Who would be that stupid enough to hex Harper? He's nasty and everyone knows that!" the other boy's friend asked.
"Oh God, yes! Yes, Draco I want it! Oh God I love you!" And then Harry froze for his slip tongue. "I mean, I— I'm so happy it's just an expression—"
and searched the boy's childhood memories. When he pulled out of Potter's head some moments later, Draco felt highly nauseated and wanted nothing more than to empty all the contents of his stomach out onto the floor. He fell onto one knee, suddenly fighting it hard to keep his balance.
"Yes, it is." Draco wouldn't tell him that it had its twin at the manor's kitchen and both were connected. Since the beginning of this term he made requests for Tippy, his personal house-elf, to provide him with various foods into the box.
Draco tried again. This time he closed his eyes as he thought, letting images come and go through his mind at a speed that made them all blur into one. Potter smiling. Potter laughing. He didn't know why it had to be Potter, but Draco didn't care. As long as it brought him a corporeal
, and sighed at the time. It was fifteen to nine. Draco glanced at Potter and saw the boy staring at the time.
When morning came, and both boys were awakened from their sleep, they didn't panic in each other's arms. Potter's face was hidden against Draco's neck. They let some minutes pass without motion, enjoying their warmth against the cold air of the winter morning. Draco didn't want to move from his current position, but eventually they had to get up. Detaching himself – though reluctantly – from Potter, Draco slipped out of the bed and grabbed his wand below his pillow. He casted
"No!" Draco jerked his right arm free from Potter.
They took the stairs toward Headmistress McGonagall's office. When they arrived at the gargoyle, Draco and Potter stared at each other.
They arrived at the Manor's entrance hall where Narcissa was waiting. Lucius was nowhere around.
"So, you mean the precious thing to trade is…" Lambert glanced at Shacklebolt.
"Potter, are you all right?" Draco was about ten feet away from the other boy.
" Were you following me? How did you find me?" Potter asked her back. He looked displeased with her.
"Potter, can you really fix my mother's wand?" Draco asked to the point.
"Harper said he didn't see the person." The boy shrugged. "But you know what the weird part is?"
' appearance increased.
"Well, Harry? What do you think? I promised you something nice and I just fulfill it; a tour of my grandeur cottage." Draco wriggled his eyebrows to the stunned Harry.
As they arrived at the Grand Staircase Tower entrance, Draco smacked the back of Potter's head and walked inside.
Now, where did that thought come from? Draco pinched himself mentally. Slowly, he removed his hand from Potter's lap, brushing his warm legs in process. Draco's hand stopped on the Elder Wand. Draco grabbed it without breaking eye contact with Potter. He raised the wand and pointed it to his trunk.
Potter was staring at him in silence. After a moment had passed, his small voice broke it.
"No. I…" Malfoy's name was banned from wand shops. His father couldn't lend him his wand because he needed it to protect the manor from the loyal ex-Death Eaters. Plus, his father's wand was also on house arrest for a year along with its owner. Draco didn't want to remind her about it.
Then Draco heard Potter laugh, really loud. His body vibrated against him.
At midnight that day, Draco was awakened by another sharp pain on his forearm. He hadn't tried the soothing vial his father had sent him. Draco took the vial out from his trunk and popped the lid. He poured the blue liquid three drops as his father had directed on his note and then smeared it on the red skin. Draco waited for some time.
Draco averted his eyes from her and finished his breakfast in record time before excusing himself and running out.
The magical creature spread its big bat wings and then lowered itself to the ground. Draco took it as his cue to climb up the Thestral. The Thestral rose and Draco almost lost his balance. The skin of the Thestral was bit slippery. He understood now why Potter had to hold its mane when they rode it yesterday. When the Thestral was about to flap its wings, Draco heard someone shout. He looked forward and saw a dark-haired boy running towards him.
Without Potter even saying anything, or Draco approving, the dark-haired boy was at his side the whole day.
Knotting his tie, he still had half an hour before breakfast ended. As he walked out of the room, he noticed the place was deserted. It seemed that all other Eighth years had gone to the Great Hall. When he was about to open the entrance door, he heard a rustling sound and the next thing he knew the door flew open and slammed into him, pushed by a male student.
Harry stopped breathing. He blinked per two seconds at Draco too many times.
"I miss flying." The voice startled Draco.
Draco gasped.
"Nothing. Just said ex-Death Eaters attacked the manor. That's all." Potter averted his eyes. "And, er, a bit about the house-elves."
"Potter, if I could share the small bed at Hogwarts with you, surely there's a lot more room for you in this massive bed!" Draco stared at Potter wide-eyed in disbelief.
"Well well well…" a male voice mused from a shadow.
After the seventh movement, he turned the movement counter clockwise and began to chant the incantation for the second time.
"Father, how did they come in?" Draco asked his father.
"Oh, yeah, that. Can't tell you. You'll know it tomorrow." Potter mimicked Draco's movement.
"Of course! He stole it from my hand." Draco frowned. Suddenly the room felt warm.
Without another word, Potter climbed into Draco's bed, laying on his side at the very edge of the mattress. The two closed their eyes, and not five minutes later Draco's snapped back open to take in the sight of Potter clutching himself tightly. Dealing with this boy was turning out to be incredibly tiring.
"Merlin, that's awesome! No wonder you were missing a lot at meal times! If I had one, I wouldn't want to get out of my room unless for classes! I'd be quite content with this box in my room." Potter swallowed another piece of the sweets and gazed at the wooden box dreamily.
"I don't need to do it for him just to show him that he's wrong." Draco glared at Potter, silently telling him to shut up. That boy really needed some sort of emotional control. And honestly, even if Draco tried to cast it, he was pretty sure his anger would never let him create one. At this moment, he wanted to throttle Harper and then choke Potter and then
So after he changed into his clothes, he put his mother's wand into his pocked and walked out to the Great Hall. After breakfast, he intended to go to Hogsmeade, and from there, he would Disapparate to the manor to hand his mother's wand to her himself.
"I thought you wanted to be an Auror?" Draco put his body to his side facing Harry.
He casted Tempus to see the time, and reasoned that he would owl the letter tomorrow, as his room didn't have a window to call his eagle owl, Icarus. He secured the letter into the drawer and decided to read the new released book of Advanced Level Alchemy before sleep.
"Y-you're okay.." a low voiced statement from Potter.
"You gave it to me at the manor a couple of months ago, right?" Potter grinned at him.
"Relax, Malfoy. It won't bite. Go try ask it yourself." Potter sounded like he was enjoying the scene, which was upsetting Draco even more.
"Wait, Potter, is that…isn't that Ginerva Weasley label on your door? What is she doing there?" Draco looked up at Potter.
Draco woke up two hours later feeling so revived and content. He stretched his body, pressed him even closer against Harry. Hand that was nested beneath his shirt scratched his back with its nails.
"Now, Potter. I need you to stay sit in this sofa until I'm back here this afternoon." Draco watched Potter for any sign of obedience, but the boy's face remained completely slack.
He sighed. How would he brew potions without his own wand? After he graduated, he planned to be a potions master. It was more of a dream actually. His passion toward potions had been nestled in his mind since the first time his father took him to the Malfoy Apothecary headquarters when he was seven. And then he'd found his father's alchemy book on his father's table at the library after they returned to the manor.
"Draco?" Harry called against Draco's bare chest an hour later after they made another brilliant love.
The next time he opened his eyes, Draco was clutching Potter's hands while the boy spooned him from behind. He released Potter's hands in self-embarrassment, then pulled out his wand from beneath his pillow and casted
"You said that as if you have enough experience to compare. Who was it? That Weaselette?" Draco scowled as he watched Potter's face scrunch up when he said the girl's nickname. That pleased Draco somehow, despite the nausea that the thought of Potter kissing Weaselette brought him.
"I wasn't even aware that he'd moved from his place, mother." Draco stood beside the sleeping Potter.
"Um…the sooner the better," Potter contemplated.
"Potter, let me in." Draco called out to Potter. "Potter, if you want to get free from the unconsciousness, you have to let me in." The door opened and revealed Potter who was sitting with his knees folded against his chest. The cupboard was so small that Draco wouldn't fit inside, so he knelt outside.
"Er…about that…She insisted to talk to me. So, um, I…" Potter rubbed his neck sheepishly.
They passed that Wednesday morning lazily in Draco's bed against each other. And beneath the cover, Draco finally realized that Potter was only wearing a T-shirt and boxer.
"Ugh. I hate Apparition." Potter slumped before they both Disapparated to Hogwarts.
"I'll tell you about it tomorrow. Look, Malfoy, I'm sorry about what happened. I shouldn't have yelled at them." Potter lowered his head.
"Uh…" Potter frowned as he thought.
Once they'd arrived at their common room, Draco took a seat on an armchair in the corner of the room. Potter took the other armchair beside him, their seats separated with a coffee table. Mandy Brocklehurst and Lisa Turpin sat on the rug in front of the fireplace. At first they sat staring at Draco and Potter, judging how bizarre it was that the once-rivals could sit together in peace. Draco summoned a silencing bubble around him and Potter.
"Don't you want to visit Hogsmeade first?" Draco heard a grunt so he decided to try something else.
"Go away, Malfoy!" Potter shouted in harsh voice.
"It'll get used to you eventually," Potter said, sounding almost like he was trying to convince himself.
the class.
"Right. Thank you, professor." Draco left the Great Hall toward the Headmistress' office.
to the object. The shrunken object returned to its original size and Draco stared at his green cashmere scarf. There was the clear dirty imprint of a foot on it.
"And what happened to your room?" Draco gave the dark-haired boy a withering look.
Draco had to close his eyes. The high speed caused the wind to deafen his ears and forced him to close his eyes. Draco tightened his arms around Potter's waist as it was pretty difficult to keep balance on the beast's slick back. He couldn't see where they were flying to.
in amazement and from the corner of his eye he saw Potter stick out his tongue at Harper and grin at him. Draco held back the urge to roll his eyes and smack Potter's head simultaneously.
"Nooo. He found Harper petrified. Apparently someone hexed him with
"You should ask someone to put her down, someday, Potter." Narcissa sighed. "Enjoy your remaining holiday, boys." Narcissa left them.
"Your friends were looking for you." Draco sat on the bedside and poked Potter's shoulder.
"Um, do you remember how it got on your finger?"
Granger shamefacedly moved behind Weasel, hiding her reddened face.
"Of course." McGonagall turned her head to her right and looked at the portrait on the wall. "Albus?"
Draco and Potter arrived at the Thestrals' clearing in the forest at noon. As they climbed off of the Thestral, the creature tucked its head against Draco's silver-blond one.
Draco walked grimly to his quarters. He was sure that by lunch today, word would have spread Hogwarts-wide. As he arrived on the ground floor, Draco decided being alone was all he needed now. So instead of walking back to his room, Draco wandered toward the forest, his favorite escapade place. Somehow, it was secluded from the outside elements, even from extreme weather. When rain poured on Hogwarts badly, it only drizzled here. And when Hogwarts was veiled in white snow, it was a mere light snow beyond the trees. All in all, the hidden spot was cozy despite the winter.
"At one point we would say it to each other eventually and until then I know it would get us sore and dying. So I'm making it easy for us and save a great time by saying it now. And when I say it, I mean it." Draco looked deep into Harry with his piercing eyes. Harry looked as if he wanted to say something but he couldn't manage to form any words from his mouth as a tear gathered in one corner of his eye and then it fell down on his rosy cheek. Before Draco's brain processed a reaction to take, his arms were full of the Gryffindor boy, sobbing into his warm neck.
"Apparate straight to Hogwarts." he mumbled, and Draco suspected the boy was returning to his sleep.
"Makes it easier, father. Can find him and smack his head spot on if he wanders around the Manor." Draco glanced at Potter who was sitting uncomfortably beside him.
"Er…Ginny's there…" Potter blinked rapidly.
Draco walked into the Great Hall. It was eight thirty so the hall was half emptied now. He took a seat at the empty space at the Slytherin table, as near to the Hogwarts Staff table as possible. He took a chocolate pudding dessert as he looked around. Potter wasn't to be found anywhere in the Gryffindor side. Draco frowned as he saw Granger and the Weasels were there. It was a very unusual sight. Thinking about it, he rarely saw Potter with his friends since they returned to Hogwarts. Draco also noticed that Potter wasn't often seen around at meal times in the Great Hall.
Oh Mighty Merlin and Great Salazar with his other three Hogwarts founders and Bloody Baron! Harry Potter had just kissed him! Harry. Potter. Had. Just. Kissed. Him! Oh Merlin oh Merlin, what should he do? He'd never kissed anyone before. Nor had he ever been kissed on the lips – mostly because he would not let anyone get that close to him. Oh Merlin what should he do? When Theo kissed Pansy, she kissed back –not an image he wanted to remember though. So should he kiss Potter back?
"Draco, how did Potter get the Labelleza Dormit necklace in the first place?" Narcissa asked.
Generously, Draco walked Harry to his bathroom and compliantly accompanying him in taking leisure shower and made them experiencing their first art of fellatio toward each other in the large Jacuzzi. After they got dressed, they walked downstairs and sat on the living room, enjoying the sea far across.
"Well, what with you stupidly entered the Triwizard Tournament. I literally panicked and almost ran to you when I heard father talking about the plan of bringing you to the resurrection of the Dark Lord. But mother knew and she held me from running to you." Draco scrunched his nose. He raised his eyebrows when he saw Harry made a big O with his mouth.
"You mess with him and that's my business." Potter raised his eyebrows on Harper's wand.
"Are you all right?" Potter reached for Draco hesitantly. When Draco let him approach, Potter sat beside him. Draco was staring forward with empty eyes. He wanted his mother. As he felt Potter's left arm timidly wrap itself around his shoulders and pull him close, Draco didn't resist the urge to drop his head onto the Gryffindor's shoulder.
"Why, Draco dear, mind your manners. We're in the middle of dinner." Narcissa admonished.
Draco rose, letting Potter's hands slip from him entirely. He climbed off the bed and took a seat on the chair, steadying his heartbeat.
Imito Respiciofors: made up transfiguration spell. To transfigure object into something the caster thinks in their mind.
"Er…right. I guess I'll take a training program to be a healer." Harry turned his head back and stared up to the canopy.
A tap sound came from inside the box and Draco opened it. Potter ooh-ed when Draco pulled out two glasses of a green juice. Below the glasses were assortment boxes piled up. Draco handed one glass to Potter.
Draco took his pajamas and walked to the bathroom to change and brush his teeth.
"Fetch me the Book of Potions and Physiology from the Manor's library." Draco ordered.
Oh Merlin! Centaur? But centaurs didn't have that kind of voice, did they? Draco swallowed. What if it was…a Hippogriff? Nah, those were further away to the east side, near Hagrid's hut. So was it just a normal horse then? But Draco never saw normal horses in the forest.
"The Malfoy crest!" Potter cut him enthusiastically. "Haha, how appropriate, Malfoy!"
"Yes, professor." Draco said emotionlessly.
"Er…I like it better like this." Potter looked everywhere but at Draco.
"Malfoy! Merlin, don't surprise people inside the castle!" Potter put his hand against his chest. This side of Hogwarts castle was novel for him. Who knew what kind of trick the castle had for students.
"Tomorrow, Saturday, are you going to Hogsmeade? The headmistress has allowed us all to visit again." Draco turned his head and watched Potter who was lying on the other bed. The boy definitely looked sleepy.
"AAAAAARGH!"
A cry deafened Draco's ears. He looked down at the Unicorn's wounded leg and saw the impaled branch prodded the flesh deeper, silver blood flowing even faster now. Without a thought, Draco whisked down and stroked the crying Unicorn, hoping to calm the magical creature. He heard a whiff behind. Oh no, was the beast planning to eat the Unicorn? It looked like a kind of carnivorous beast. And because the Unicorn was wounded, perhaps the horse-like skeleton beast smelled its flesh and blood.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So, have you thought about it, then?" Draco murmured against Harry's head.
"I am Lord Malfoy; the head of the Malfoy household now, Potter." Draco glued his eyes to Potter's.
"I'm- I'm fine, Malfoy. I'll sleep here." Potter answered without looking at him. So Draco climbed on the bed and yanked the cover back, rolling the boy to face him.
"Yeah, mate, but you don't have to do a favor for the ferret. Come on." Weasel pulled Potter by the wrist.
Draco walked back toward the Auror and pulled the Auror's left sleeve.
"Now, gentlemen, you know ex-Death Eaters are out there. I didn't allow any students to leave Hogwarts this morning. How are you going to explain yourselves?" McGonagall sat on her chair before the standing Draco and Potter.
The gleam on Potter's eyes soon faded as Draco opened the box. Draco didn't like that look on Potter's face. He didn't want to disappoint him.
They sat at Draco's usual place and began to fill their plates with lamb chops. Millicent stood, walked up to shoo away a sixth year girl who had been sitting beside him, and sat in her spot.
"Why does your magic leak? I didn't know magic could leak from a wizard's body."
"I was talking with Malfoy," Potter said briefly.
"What?" Potter stared at the scarf, then to Draco, then to the scarf again. Draco rolled his eyes. He shoved his scarf to Potter.
"How can it be? What kind of wand is that?" Draco stared at his mother's wand. Looked as good as before it was broken.
"Freezing hell! Potter, where are we?" Draco unconsciously stuck his body from head to toe against Potter, seeking warmth. His heart was beating fast; must be because of the highness.
But for now, Draco felt content with Potter's company.
A moment later, the house-elf reappeared in front of him and gave him the book. Draco dismissed her, then took the thick book to his desk and opened it at the page he had previously bookmarked. At first, he read the book angrily, but as time went by Draco's foul mood diminished and he ended up enjoying his read. By the time he'd finished the Heart chapter, it was over dinnertime. With a sated sigh, Draco put the book away and took a shower. After he got dressed, Draco demanded an Apple pie to the Render box for his dinner. Done with his pie, he lay down on his bed, and, staring up at the canopy, folded his arms underneath his head.
"I say, if I can create a
"Yeah. I think I've lost my mind. That's what everybody always says to me. So, sit down, Malfoy, and eat. That, or would you prefer to eat standing?" Potter looked up at Draco, lifting his eyebrows while biting his sandwich.
Potter was gazing into the air. Draco let some time pass in silence, and when he felt it was enough, he put his hands on Potter's shoulders and squeezed, saying his name softly. The boy averted his eyes. Draco sighed.
That morning, Draco dreamt about dragons. The dragons embarked into the Wizarding World and tried to conquer it. The dragons were throwing the wizards and witches orange candy floss, and anyone who was touched by it was burnt. Then a ball of orange candy floss was flung on Draco. The ball hit his left cheek, and he tensed, expecting warmth and pain, but instead the ball brushed down to his jaw line. Then the ball bounced up again to his cheek and stroked down his face. Blinking his eyes rapidly, the action pulled Draco back into the real world. When he opened his eyes, Draco was staring straight into Potter's emerald eyes, a warm hand planted against his left cheek.
Thank you for reading this fic.
When he arrived at the Receiving Room for guests, he saw his mother was there, studying Potter.
Guiding his slick member, Draco was gently entering Harry in low velocity. With trained control and patience, Draco waited for Harry to adjust with his sized member, then slowly pushing deeper inch by inch until he was fully buried inside. The grips on the ring of muscle and his shoulders tightened, almost cut his circulation.
"Nope, thanks." Potter clutched his robe tight.
"It's fine. You're cold." Draco put his hand gently on Potter's to stop him from disengaging the scarf from his neck. Draco's hand lingered far too long for appropriateness.
"Since he helped me at the Manor. Just a small thanks, that's all."
"Draco, I heard what happened. Are you serious?" Millicent whispered to him.
"Harper." Draco smirked deviously. This was going to be a beautiful Sunday.
At first Potter seemed surprised by the act, but then he quickly recovered from the shock and kissed back. He slipped his hands around Draco's neck, and slyly one of his hands moved up and buried itself in Draco's silky blond hair. Draco never let anyone but his mother touch his perfect hair; he would normally hex anyone who dared to do so, but when he felt Potter's hand on his hair, Draco found that he liked it. It sent tingling sensations through his body. His stomach fluttered and some other foreign pleasant feelings rushed down his every cell. He pushed Potter until the boy was laying on the bed, Draco on top of him, kissing breathlessly.
"Did it bring you bad dreams?" Draco kissed Harry's temple.
"What made you think that I'm not happy? And why does it bother you?" Potter turned fully to him. The blond could feel the boy's eyes boring into his head. From the shuffle sound beside him, Draco could guess that Potter was leaning toward him and would remain in that position until Draco deigned to look back at him. Giving up his cowardice, Draco finally faced the other boy.
A loud ring echoed inside Draco's head. It stopped when he awoke and opened his eyes. Five thirty, the alarm he'd set told him. He inhaled deep. Potter was still sleeping. Draco had to return to his room right now before other students got out of their rooms and caught him walking out from Potter's room. He shook Potter gently to wake him up, and five minutes later the boy was finally awake enough to reluctantly release the blond from his embrace. It was adorable; Draco had to admit it. He dropped a kiss on Potter's head and then walked out to his own room.
"Hi. Um, sorry for the push." Potter stood beside Draco.
." a whisper said near Draco and he saw Potter. The Gryffindor had just canceled the Disillusionment charm on himself.
"Watch your back, Draco." Millicent patted Draco's back and returned to her previous seat.
"You're so wrong by saying those words now." Harry leaned into Draco's hand as his tears were brushed off by Draco's thumb. "You should say it so long ago so I wouldn't have to feel alone and hurt."
"Awesome!" In a single motion Potter jumped onto the bed, legs folded, and planted the magazine on the space between them, already engrossed completely in it.
"Oh, Draco dear." Her mother hugged him.
Potter cast a silencing spell on the door. Then the Gryffindor threw himself and his bag to the unoccupied bed as though he owned the room. Or the bed. Draco felt his jaw had dropped, so he quickly schooled his face again.
"Oh, Merlin, sorry! I was in hurry, I thought everybody has already left." Potter corrected his spectacles position and looked up.
"She only kissed me twice. It was a mistake, really. I shouldn't have carried on. I thought that was what I wanted. That she was the right…" Potter finished his sentence with a dismissive shrug of his shoulders. "What about yourself, Malfoy? Oh, right, I forgot. You're the Ice Prince of Slytherin. Of course you had more than enough experience with…with…these things."
"Er…accompanying Draco…?" Potter directed his words toward Draco, and Draco knew that the boy wanted approval from him but he would keep quiet.
"What?" Potter replied, looking confused.
"Better go now." Draco said huskily and when he turned around he was so surprised by what he saw that he very nearly choked on a lungful of air. There before him was his mother standing impassively, staring straight at him. "Mother!" Draco shrilled.
Draco waited as Harry pretended to think hard. He narrowed his eyes however, when Harry mentioned the Weasel family. He knew that the boy was teasing him. But to just think that Harry would live under the same roof as the Weaselette, it made Draco's stomach fluttering in panic. He grabbed Harry's hair and pulled down, brought the boy's face upward and hissed against Harry's lips.
Draco was really confused with the Boy Who Lived Twice in his arms. Though he didn't know all about the Gryffindor, he had started to understand a little more every day about him. From the outside, it looked as though Potter was a bad omen. Wherever he went, big problems always occurred. People around him would get into trouble and end up hurt, and then the whole Wizarding World would demand that responsibility fall on him to fix all the damage and make everything better again. Did they, even once, think that the truth was they were dropping the entire Wizarding World's burden onto a boy's shoulders, only using his name as the Boy Who Someday Must Defeat the Dark Lord? They were practically abusing him! He was just a boy, and he was alone! They never cared nor were aware of his wellbeing and fear.
"I don't swing around and offer myself to random people, Potter! I have no desire to get involved with such animalistic activity. There's a reason they call me the
"Oh God, 's good." Potter ate a truffle while staring at Draco with his glassy eyes, so touched by the deliciousness in his mouth. "It's a magical box, isn't it? Looks like it's too small for all these boxes."
"Come on. Let me help you." Potter looked at Draco expectantly. Draco hesitated but then nodded. Potter released his sleeve.
"Why? What would possibly hurt me?" Draco looked around and saw nothing but Potter. Ah! Understanding came to him; Potter was warning him from his own wild magic. From the state the dark-haired boy was in, Draco could tell that Potter was losing control over his powers. Why? How? Potter started to walk away, startling him.
"Shut up, Malfoy! Harry?" Weaselette crossed her arms over her chest, demanding an explanation from Potter.
The sound of the scratch of the quill on parchment was lulling to Draco's ears. He didn't realize it until sometime later when he'd fallen asleep by it. Draco opened his eyes hours later, possibly in the middle of the night. He must have fallen asleep while he read the boring papers. He thought the sitting position against the wall, wearing his body out, might have woken him up. But as his awareness returned, he realized that that wasn't the cause of his awaking. It was a cry in his room. Then he remembered Potter. Draco grabbed his wand and lightened the room. What he saw and heard before him broke his heart.
"Merlin! It's seven already! Have we really been reading for two hours?" Draco blinked.
"Your left hand tenses. You keep clenching it for the past half hour." Potter studied Draco's face.
"Oh, you stupid idiot Gryffindor!" Draco ran fast to chase the dark-haired boy. In only a few seconds he had caught up with him. Draco pulled him hard and Potter's body collapsed against his, left hand buried into a mess of dark hair, and with a harsh grip Draco pulled Potter's hair. He forced the Gryffindor to look up and crashed their lips together. Again, it was only lips to lips touching but this time Draco held it long until he felt Potter's frantic heartbeats slowed down. Draco opened his eyes, seeing the closed eyelids of the other boy. Slowly, Draco reduced the press of his lips on Potter's until they were just inches away. Potter opened his eyes then, gazing into Draco's silvery eyes. Draco wanted an explanation but knew that the other boy would detach from him and run away.
"A wand?" Draco's brow furrowed in confusion. "Whose wand is that?"
Walking towards breakfast today should have been enjoyable because he had a wand for today's Transfiguration class. But Draco frowned. On the way to his table, all the students in the Great Hall were staring at him. Some were whispering, following his steps. Then he saw a Daily Prophet on the Slytherin table. He read the title of the article of the front page.
"What's that, Harry?" Weasel, with his ugly scrunching face, looked at Potter in disapproval.
"Wait. Potter, why did you cast the silencing bubble?"
"I'll be in my room." Draco looked down at Potter. Ensuring Potter with his eyes that if he wanted him to stay, he would. Potter nodded and Draco walked toward his room. His ears caught some of their conversation.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry…!" Potter kept shaking his head. It seemed that the boy wasn't listening to Draco's words.
Only half the seventh year students of his year had returned to Hogwarts to repeat their term and have a proper graduation. Draco had returned with his two other fellow Slytherins; Millicent Bulstrode and Daphne Greengrass. Too bad Pansy transferred to Beauxbatons and Blaise and Theodore transferred to Durmstrang. If not, they could've ruled the Slytherin House this year.
"Hey!" Potter followed, entering the common room with a flushed face.
. If the boy was having a nightmare and he intruded on his head, it could turn out a mess. So Draco returned to his room.
"There will be no next time for this, understood? Now get back to your chambers." McGonagall shook her head. "Oh, Mr. Malfoy," Draco turned back to look at the headmistress. "Do you have your own wand now?" McGonagall asked.
"What do you think?" Draco asked back.
"Your propose is?" Harry's pupils dilated and he opened his lips slightly.
Another house-elves appeared with loud cracks.
The Thestral puffed loudly and it lifted its head from Draco.
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Potter blushed and started to write. Draco shook his head. He took his own papers and stood up.
Draco looked up to the sky and noticed it must be past lunch and he'd missed the beginning of his Advanced Arithmancy class this noon. Checking his pocket watch, it turned out that he still had a chance to attend what was left of the class. It was nearly one. Rolling his sleeves back down to the wrists, Draco sighed and walked back to the edge of the forest. Draco brushed any dirt on his robe and tailored trousers off before setting out back to the castle.
"They're on the floor. Wands on the nightstand." Harry pointed at the gathered garments while his head tilted to the nightstand and then devoured Draco's mouth once again.
He took a deep breath once, and exhaled. Eyes staring through to the darker side of the forest. Slowly his body glided down until he landed on the damp ground, legs folded against his chest. His arms embraced his knees and Draco dropped his head on them, broken and crying.
. It was twenty to eight and he jumped from the bed, awakening Potter in the process. Draco dashed for a hasty shower and dressed. Five minutes before eight, he walked out of his room and got stopped by Potter at the common room.
"Potter, that is really utter nonsense. I don't know and don't care what and how people reacted to your magic before, but I'm completely okay with it. Literally." Draco put an emphasis on that last word. Potter looked at him. And then eyed him from head to chest, where their bodies untangled from each other's.
"Good night, Malfoy." And Potter watched as Draco walked away toward his own room.
"It's not! I saw Granger's also had the same color as ours. Let it proceed to that color and be patient!"
His arm!
"So, is he the reason for Daphne's foul mood?" Millicent turned her head to see Daphne who was staring at him, and if looks could kill, Draco would have died a good few times already.
"It will disappear when the mission you gave it is accomplished…" Potter's eyes were glued on their
"I'm fine." Lucius put his arm around his wife's waist.
"All right, I have it in my trunk. Let's get it then." Potter walked back toward his room.
The now-perfectly-healed Unicorn was staring back at him. Once again it brushed its face to Draco's body and then hopped into the forest within.
"Don't you dare!" Draco looked at Harry threateningly and the brat grinning widely. He felt Harry looping his arms around his neck.
"Ouch, Malfoy!" Potter ran inside to catch up with the blond.
"Bloody hell!" Draco and Potter cried in unison.
"If anyone tries to cause harm to Master Lucius and Mistress Narcissa, you help Master Lucius and Mistress Narcissa to stop them." Draco commanded the house elves.
"Yes, you see…it's not that easy." Potter scratched his head. "Saturday. I can only do it Saturday. We'll talk about it on Saturday."
It was the second week of the Easter holidays in April of the year. Draco was burning a book in his room's fireplace. During the first day of the holiday, Draco had written letters to Blaise and Pansy about Hogwarts and his progression on his potions formula. Draco also wrote them complaints about how insufferable Potter was during their Eight year. Instead of telling him about Durmstrang and Beauxbatons, in return Blaise and Pansy Owled him a copy of the Male Lovers Guide and told him to practice the book with Potter. At first Draco had wanted to throw the book straight to the fire, but curiosity could kill the dragon, too, as Pansy had said once. So he'd kept the book and this afternoon he had just finished reading it, his face burning. He hoped his face would have returned to its usual paleness when he attended dinner with his parents that night. He made a mental note to give his two friends filthy retribution someday.
"You-! You don't deserve to live, Malfoy!
"Oh, this is Tenebrus. The best trained Thestral in Great Britain!" Potter proclaimed proudly. "Come on, we're gonna ride it."
"Er…so what's this?" Potter blushed.
Silence engulfed them completely.
"Yeah. Of course you are." Potter laughed. Damn Merlin if that didn't make Draco relieved and warm inside. Draco cleared his throat. He hoped he didn't blush.
Draco, obviously displeased by the disturbance, decided to postpone his questioning of the boy wonder.
"I doubt it can fix it. Your wand's damage is helpless," Potter said.
After dinner, a warm relaxing shower had awaited Draco in his rooms. And when his body touched his bed, it was an auto-call to the land of dreams. Exhaustion was supposed to bring him no dreams, or at least random meaningless dreams. Apparently it didn't work with this mix of exhaustion and contact with dark artefacts at the Manor. After a long time devoid nightmares, finally they decided to visit Draco that night. Killing acts, curses, tortures, the spine-chilling act of the Dark Lord toward him; they were terrorizing Draco in his sleep. When the
"Hey. Um, you're going back to the chambers, right? Better walk then. It's really cold outside." Potter initiated the walk by moving first, followed Draco.
"How is it, then?" Potter looked at Draco. Of course, Draco turned his head away. There was no way he was going to tell Potter he'd failed to cast a
Draco blinked. "Mother, you haven't been spying on me, have you?"
"Potter! how did—"
Draco sighed. New trouble. As if his problems with the ministry weren't enough. Ah, to think of it, he still hadn't touched the Malfoy Apothecary papers. They consumed a lot of time to study. But Draco didn't mind because he liked the apothecary.
"It's all right. You were dreaming, Potter. You're awake now. It's all right." Draco put his hands on Potter's body. The boy was trembling.
"What?" Potter blinked at his best friend.
Tractura Vesania: made up potion. Draught of Insanity. Causes the drinker temporally lose their memory before memories mixed creating completely false memories, thus falls to insanity. The cure is three-fourth-time brewed Elixir of Life simultaneously mixed with Peace.
"No." Draco grabbed the letter and walked to his parents. "Mother, father, I'll send them to the Ministry with Potter. Snippy! Loopy!"
Fifteen minutes later they arrived at the Hogwarts gates.
"This, your stare, your question, your frantic actions. The…magic." Draco spoke the last word cautiously. A long pause, and then Potter spoke.
Draco stood without saying anything. He didn't want to speak and nor did he know what to say to his former enemy. Potter looked uncomfortable and uneasy. Draco was just staring at him. Not glaring, just staring, as if he stared at the empty air.
"How long can I hold it before it disappears?" Draco asked Potter as he watched his
"But you'll want it back eventually." Potter stopped pulling the ring.
"Oh, I'm sorry." Potter bit his bottom lip.
"The Elder Wand is unique. Unlike common wands, it has its own mind. Sometimes I myself couldn't understand it. It acted of its own accord. Such a naughty wand, don't you think?" Dumbledore portrait chuckled and then returned to his slumber.
Scratch that! Why in Salazar's name would he even consider to kiss back in the first thought?! Oh Merlin. Did that mean he liked Potter? What?! But he was a boy. They were both boys! Should he kiss Potter back? Why had Potter kissed him? Did Potter like him? Was he allowed to kiss Potter back? He was not a girl, so it would be okay to kiss him, right? He wouldn't demand marriage and take over Malfoy's fortune in the future, right? Of course he wouldn't. Potter was a boy so he wouldn't force him into intercourse and then get pregnant and demand marriage, right? There was no potion for same sex couples to acquire a baby. But there might have been a Dark spell for that… Oh Merlin, what should he do?
Insane. He must be insane! He must have swallowed some of the Tractura Vesania draught when the accident happened at class. That's why he'd been acting so out of his own logic reasoning this entire time. He'd just had the impression that the Unicorn had thanked him and now it wanted him to thank the other beast. Draco rose on his feet and timidly raised his hand to the black horse-like beast's head and gave it a light pat while saying thank you. Again, the skeletal beast cocked his head while keeping his eyes on Draco's and then walked away, disappearing between crowded trees and bushes.
"Potter, why do you always eat like it's your last meal?" Draco's finger was tapping the table.
"Yo-" Draco's word was cut by the bark of none other than Potter.
"I think it's too cold to walk to the Great Hall for breakfast." Draco gestured for Potter to sit on the bed. The bless box was settled in the middle of the bed.
"You – the scar! When you blacked out, the scar turned into ugly black smoke and then it vanished in the air!" Potter took Draco's left arm and stared at it.
"Do you have treacle tart in the bless box, Malfoy?" Potter asked while lifting a fork of the dessert toward his mouth.
Now Draco was starting to understand that Potter would call him by his first name when he was half unconscious.
"Tippy!" Draco shouted, summoning his personal house-elf. A loud pop echoed around the room and the house-elf appeared before Draco.
"Mother?" Draco tilted his head, looking at his mother in confusion. He had done everything right. Or hadn't he?
"You can have it." Draco looked down at Harry who finally looked sobered.
He walked to the black pitch of the Quidditch field. Draco looked around but couldn't spot Potter anywhere. Perhaps the boy was lying when he said he would go here.
Since it was afternoon, Draco enjoyed the time with a thorough body cleansing.
Draco counted minutes as the boy in his arms kept crying, fighting and struggling to get himself free and Merlin only knew what the boy would do next. Meanwhile, Draco had to suppress the biting sensation on his skin as Potter's magic swirled and crawled around them.
Draco took Potter to the White Room, which was located right beside his own room. The White Room was supposed for his intended but Draco didn't give a damn at this point for he was still in shock. After bidding the other boy good night, Draco entered his own room and got ready for the night.
"Professor McGonagall."
"Right, Apparate straight to Hogwarts, then." Draco nodded to his mother.
"What?" And then Draco felt a push on his body. Next, the door shut. Draco thought it was Peeves, so he called out to the poltergeist. But when he turned his body, he choked at the appearance of Harry Potter in his room. "Potter!"
Draco ran toward the forest as quickly as he could, before the Headmistress ordered Filch to close all the entrance doors and sealed Hogwarts.
"I'm a freak and a potential risk, isn't that what people think?" Potter looked up at Draco. His face was hard.
"Yeah. Me neither." Potter hunched, burying his face into Draco's scarf. Draco found the gesture adorable.
When Draco invited Potter for breakfast, they were both sporting blushes on their faces. After breakfast, Draco gave the other boy a clean shirt because his mother wanted to meet them this morning. With the help of Tippy's tailoring spell, Draco's black shirt easily fit Potter's smaller body. They went to the Receiving Room where Draco's mother awaited.
charm for the first time. How the hell would he be able to produce a
!" Harper shouted, and Draco fell to the floor. He threw Draco's bag hard to the petrified Draco. He kicked his senior and then the three seventh year Slytherins stomped out of the class.
"I'm the head of the Malfoy. Not the head of the family." Draco rolled his eyes.
Suddenly he heard a harsh whizz behind him. He turned his head to find a huge bat-winged horse-like thing with a skeletal body and a face with reptilian features. Its empty white eyes stared down at him, ten feet away.
"Avoiding your girlfriend, Potter?" Draco smirked at him.
"Er, need some peace." Potter gazed at Draco and blinked.
"What the hell!" Draco pulled his arm away harshly. He saw the Weaselette's face turn red as she stood, stunned in place. Potter dragged her away from Draco and then walked back and stood beside him.
At breakfast, Potter joined Draco on his table once again. During the meal he asked Potter to cast
That was when things went wrong. His wand made a little spark on its tip. The liquid started to float in a spiraling movement then suddenly burst up and toward his wand. In reflex, Draco released his grip from the wand as the silvery liquid covering his wand fled up.
"How come you haven't—Merlin!" Draco opened his eyes so wide they hurt. "You haven't started it yet? Potter, the work was given last week. Seven days ago!"
"What?" Draco started.
"You…like me?" Draco stared down at Potter.
To entertain himself, Draco decided to enjoy the light reflections on the chambers' windows by sitting in a black armchair in the corner of the common room, observing the inhabitants. When he entered the common room, it fell silent. Eight students currently occupying the common room stopped their activities and turned their heads toward Draco. He raised his eyebrow elegantly in return and the group returned to their own activities.
"I think I'll just go back to my room. I'm not in the mood to take a chance for another hex." Draco clenched his jaw.
McGonagall sighed.
"I couldn't. I've tried to break it but it wouldn't break. So I hid it here. Somewhere people wouldn't find or think of." Potter shrugged.
"Move with me."
"Oh." If possible, Potter's face reddened deeper than before.
"So, what is it?" Potter lifted his spectacles.
"What?" Draco saw no Death Eater mark scar on the arm.
"Want to tell me what this is all about?" Draco asked, not once letting Potter go.
"What happened? Did Harper attack you again?" Potter sounded angry.
"Feeling better?" Draco whispered softly into Potter's ear. The boy against his body nodded weakly. Draco loosened his arms to see him. He unlocked one of his arms from Potter and raised his hand. He grabbed Potter's chin and forced the boy's face up to look at him. His thumb brushed off a trail of tears from Potter's red cheek. For a moment, they stood staring at each other. Their faces were too close to each other's; Draco could feel hot air from Potter's breathing. Potter was blinking at Draco, holding his breath. At the many blinks he got, Draco lifted his eyebrows in question.
"Potter, did you sleep on my bed?" Draco looked down at the dark hair boy.
"Potter, look at me. Potter!" Draco replaced his hands to Potter's head and forced the boy to look at him. "Potter, tell me." When Potter tried to look away again, Draco gripped his hair and the boy's eyes were back on his. He inhaled a faint scent of spring.
"Nothing. Just…stuff." Potter said.
"Yes." Draco hesitated, but gaining his courage finally asked, "Um, Potter. Want to join me for lunch in my room?"
"Tch, I would have said that in our fourth year if I could." It was Draco's turn to blush and averted his eyes away.
"Very well. You better start it now. I want all this to end as soon as possible." Narcissa stepped back a few steps to make room for her son.
"Malfoy."
" Draco and Potter cried in unison.
"Me? What is wrong with me? I have everyone fussing over me the whole time and all I see is that it's The Boy Who Live they're looking at, not me. How would it feel to you if you had those kinds of strangers around you? I just want to be alone, just with you two is enough, but you both seem so busy with your own…things. I…the point is, you're the ones who are withdrawing from me. And Ginny, please, don't act like I'm your boyfriend. I've always see you as a sister. So, please, can you all leave me alone for a while? I just want peace for once in my life." Potter dashed out of the field.
Draco tidied his messed blond hair. Oh, his precious hair. That Thestral would pay for it!
The gears in Draco's head clicked into place. He remembered now.
"Yes, Master Malfoy, Sir." Snippy grumbled.
"Oh. You're good in potions." Potter looked up at Draco. "Ah, you have a…sugar thing on your face."
"We better take this to someone and ask what to do with it." Draco told Potter at the same time.
"You're still here, Potter," Lucius said as they ate the main course. "And still wearing your ring, Draco."
"Ow, Malfoy!"
Something like the stomping and writhing of an animal. Draco turned his head to look behind him, through to the deeper forest. His eyes widened, sharp with alert. There! It writhed again. He inhaled, put his ears in higher at attention and heard a whinny voice.
"Are you okay?" Potter's words startled Draco.
Draco was staring straight into Potter's eyes, but the other boy seemed oblivious at what he had just said. This was the second time Potter had slipped and called Draco by his first name. Draco gave the boy one last blink before he resumed their walk toward the Manor. As they arrived at the dungeon, Draco told Potter to stay near the door and to not touch any of the dark artefacts. Potter's protest that he'd come to help and not just watch them was ignored by Draco.
"Potter! Calm down! You didn't hurt me! Calm down!" Draco tried to calm Potter, but he was panicking inside. What would his mother do if he were having a panic attack?
Arms folded on the desk, Draco stared at the empty air.
"I…I did it…" Draco stared down at Potter. "I created a corporeal
They stopped a few feet away from the Great Hall.
"Can a wand behave of its own will?" Draco kept his eyes on the Elder Wand.
"Something happen?" Draco asked the fifth years. The girls turned their heads towards Draco. Some gasped and some blushed.
"Take me," Harry whispered into Draco's ear and kissed him, pushing down the blond.
Draco didn't need another thought and doubt to appear in his brain. What he needed now was Harry. The boy was right; they both had waited for far too long holding themselves. They fit together. There's nothing to doubt about. They'd have each other right there and then!
Remorse because he knew then that he – and the whole of the Wizarding World – had thought wrongly about the Boy-Who-Lived's princely life.
After a moment far too brief, Potter sighed in defeat.
"Oh." Now Draco understood.
"I was joking, mother. I'll free him as soon as the work at the dungeon is finished. Just so he won't do anything fool again."
Should he give up his life dream just because of the fact that he possibly wouldn't ever have a wand to use again.? No wand masters wanted to give him wand. Malfoy's name was banned from wand shops of the Wizarding world.
The Patil sisters and Hannah Abbott sat on the fluffy rug before the fireplace, obviously gossiping about something. Neville Longbottom and Susan Bones were talking about Herbology. Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan and Michael Corner were discussing something that didn't sound interesting. He noticed the Golden Trio weren't around.
"I thought you wanted to be an Auror?"
"Harry! What are you doing there with Malfoy?"
. He had to succeed today, because he was sure that Monday the DADA class would be at it again, and he didn't want to be humiliated again by Harper if he still wasn't able to cast the protection charm. But although he had practiced hours and focused his mind, he still couldn't make a string of light come out of his wand. He didn't understand why he couldn't do it. Was he picking the wrong memories? Could it be that all the things that were happy for him weren't actually categorized as happiness? Thinking about it now, he had always lived kept in darkness at the manor. Not to mention that he had been Marked there. Was that the cause? What if he took other memories outside the manor that categorized as happy? But what?
"Potter, are you going to spell it out for me or should I use
"I don't know where else I should go, Draco. I don't have any other relatives," Harry said in husky voice.
"Excuse you?"
Draco stopped midstep. He looked back at Potter. Had Potter just called him Draco again?
Draco raised the robe's hood and covered his head.
"Just random things about the war." Harry shrugged.
Draco stood and stared at the pieces. A minute later he moved his eyes to Potter.
"This morning Shacklebolt sent me Auror application form to Grimauld Place. He sent one to Ron, too. He said we don't have to take the test and are welcomed to join the Auror training straight." Harry said below Draco, buried his face into Draco's neck.
Draco concentrated again on the Quidditch memories he had, and then said the incantation. Nothing happened. He tried again, but still his wand deceived him.
"Uh, it is your wand…"
, Potter." Harper sneered. He smirked widely when the class murmured about the validity of the information, some accusing Draco of being a Death Eater.
"M-Malfoy?" Potter's voice was so small. His hands loosened and slipped from Draco. Draco wanted them to keep touching his skin and hair.
"Wow. Where did you get this? Wait, is that…" Draco leant closer to the map. "Merlin! Potter, the moving labels are – it's our names!" Draco pointed at the left side of the Hogwarts map. More specifically at Draco's room in their chambers. The map was showing the fifth floor of the West wing.
"Potter, I don't understand why you didn't correct your eyesight. Those spectacles are so annoying!" Draco eyed the round spectacles in distaste.
"Sweet Merlin, no! I cannot imagine living with another person in one roof! Seeing their faces every day, sleeping with them every single night, talking with them on daily basis, and then you have to socialize with their family and friends. Imagine the trouble! Ugh!" Draco shuddered.
"I guess we'll have to keep to the bless box then," Draco sighed. He couldn't stop his smile, however, when he saw Potter's face light up at the mention of the box. They walked toward Draco's room and this time he called Tippy to serve them the appropriate dinner. And when they finished their dessert, their stomachs were so full they could nearly have managed not having meals the next day. Speaking about tomorrow…
"Potter, wake up."
The twilight beautifully painted the Hogwarts' sky. The winter air breezed frigidly. The boy beside him flushed in the cold wind, hugging himself tightly, and leant into Draco's space.
"Potter. Control yourself. Calm down." Draco gripped Potter's shoulders. He bore his eyes into Potter's emerald orbs until finally the boy had calmed down, then drew his wand and casted a cleaning spell on the scarf. He took the soft material from Potter's hand and laced it back around Potter's neck. He gave a genuine smile to Potter. The Gryffindor's eyes widened.
He saw what looked like pieces of Hawthorn wood in Potter's hand.
"Meet your father at the library tomorrow to discuss about the Apothecary, Draco. Now, get back to your wing, boys! No more compromising situations of yours beyond your wing in the future." Narcissa gave the boys scrutinising glare before she left the room without waiting their replies.
"Good. No Thestral or Unicorn." Draco pulled out his wand from beneath his sleeve. Gathered all his concentration and required memories, Draco began to practice the Patronus Charm. He wouldn't stop until he succeeded to cast an incorporeal
Harry was. The innocence was clearly shown in every way of Harry Potter.
Draco and his father began to rip the wards from the artefacts to release their family's claim over them, and then handed them to the Ministry group. Several long and tiring hours later, one of the Unspeakables told them to stop working. When he got the attention of everyone, the Unspeakable pointed his wand at Potter. All heads turned toward him; the boy was holding a necklace, sleeping on his feet.
"Can I join you?" Potter asked in a mild voice.
Draco returned to his walk and, Salazar, for the third time, he encountered Harper and his two minions on his way to the chambers. With a nasty touch of a jinx, Draco's bag flipped upside down and the contents fell down to the ground.
Draco scowled, knowing Potter's intention to watch him practicing his
"Malfoy…can I…can I stay in your room? This place reminds me of the…" Potter looked as though he were struggling to say the words. What had happened at the Manor last year, yes, Draco got it.
Draco looked down and then Potter's lips were on his.
"Come in, Potter." Draco opened the door wider.
After he enjoyed his breakfast at the Great Hall to the last minute in peace, Draco walked toward the forest. The morning was a chilly one. Draco reached up to his neck to tighten his scarf and his cold fingers touched only the garment of his black turtleneck shirt. The corner of his mouth curved a bit and he put his hand back down to his side. A self-reminder; he should buy a new scarf.
When kisses broken by the falling Harry to the deluxe bed because of Draco's eagerness to the body-connection, they didn't stop for long before Draco flung onto Harry and repeating the previous act in their new position. Slowly, Draco felt one of Harry's hands moved to his front and touching his buttons and because he couldn't and didn't want to think, he let Harry unbutton his shirt and took it off of him. Draco felt Harry's hands on his bare skin and he wanted to touch Harry's skin, too. Unceremoniously Draco took off Harry's flannel and T-shirt and threw them somewhere to the floor. Shoes were magically taken off of their feet. Their hands were roaming each other's body. Mouth creatively exploring other's body. Kissing, biting and licking every inches of the skin. And when it was Harry's turn to be on top of Draco, the silver-blond hair boy gasped and raised his upper body as he felt a touch of wet tongue on his bare thigh.
"It is." Draco lifted his eyebrow elegantly.
They were in the courtyard now, leaning against the big pillar in the farthest corner from the doors to the entrance hall. Draco was hiding in the shadow as best as he could. Since the DADA class ended, words about its events had spread around Hogwarts. It had even reached the ears of the professors – and all thanks to the boy before him. Draco had lectured Potter about it, plus about his utter lack of self-control, emotional control, anger management and tact. Being Potter, of course he'd apologized the whole time. Draco wasn't sure if the younger boy had even listened to him at all.
"The person who hexed him took Harper's robe! The guy was as white as sheet! You know how cold it is in the dungeon in winter," the boy told them and the three shuddered.
"We should go to Madam Pomfrey! Come on!" Potter tried to pull Draco out of the bed.
"How long?" Draco stepped backward.
"Mm, this is good. Malfoy, you lucky git." Potter chewed the sandwich like a starving man.
"Fourth year?" Harry cried astonished.
The hands of time showed that it was nine already.
Draco woke up feeling sticky and exhausted, but it was all forgotten as he felt contentment. He opened his eyes and smiled. He lay on top of sleeping Harry, sticky with the boy's cum on his stomach and chest. The boy wrapped his arms around Draco. He nuzzled into Harry's neck and breathed Harry's scent and slowly Draco raised his pliable upper body up gracefully, using his right elbow as leverage. He looked down at sleeping Harry, bringing his hand up and caressing the boy's face in the most possibly tender fashion he could do. The tip of his index finger trailed on the line of Harry's face, through the eyebrows, down to nose, and then lingered on the red lips. That lips which had just been officially his new addiction over sweets. Harry's lips were the sweetest thing Draco had ever devoured. A wet tip of tongue lapped his finger and then pulled it into the hot cavern. Draco smiled at the mouth.
The both of them walked out from the West wing toward the forest.
They played and flew around the Malfoy's land until lunch called.
"I think it's mad," Potter whispered.
They arrived at the manor at three o'clock in the afternoon and headed straight to Draco's dining room to have their very late lunch.
"Are you positive you were
"Potter, you didn't bring your trunk with you?" Draco asked as his hand kept stroking Potter's hair.
"What else did he do to you?" Draco hissed. His face was only inches away from Potter's.
"Harry! What are you doing at the Slytherin table?!" Ron Weasley broke the silence with his roar.
"He said he'd take dinner alone at my wing, mother. Perhaps he was unwell. He looked…off." Draco's brow furrowed.
"I can see rosy spots on your cheekbones." Potter pointed at Draco's face.
Warning: this chapter is unbetaed. Beware of grammar error.
"Potter," Draco greeted. He hoped he wasn't blushing, remembering their previous encounter in the forest.
Thursday, however, Draco and Potter had to have an interaction at Care of Magical Creatures class. Hagrid had decided to have the class in the forest. In the middle of the lesson, without invitation Tenebrus stepped out from the inner forest and toyed with Draco the whole time. Finally judging that he'd had enough of a laugh at Draco, Potter eventually helped him to chase away the creature, since no other students who could see the Thestral dared to be close with the magical creature. Hagrid himself had been enjoying the show for the duration of the class, explaining that he'd never seen Tenebrus play with other humans besides him before.
"Master Draco needs Tippy. Tippy is honoured to do Master Draco's order." Tippy chirped, bowing deeply.
"Why, young Malfoy, of course we need you for the ritual to work. We need the chosen one to be host for the Dark Lord's soul." The Auror moved his wand toward Lucius.
"Thanks." Potter turned toward Draco and took the parchment.
"So? He's a Slytherin. Of course Filch would find him in the dungeon!" one of the boy's friends commented dryly.
"Potter." Draco waited until the other boy finished putting all the cards back into their small cardboard box, and said, "About the ring…"
A long time later, Draco felt Potter's breathe even. He said the boy's name in a whisper, and when he got no answer, he peeked and saw that Potter was asleep against him. Slowly, so as not to wake him, Draco moved Potter and laid him on the cold bed. When Draco drew back from him, the boy slipped his arms to the other's waist and then pulled him down. Managing not to lose balance and fall on top of Potter, Draco put his left arm on the bed as leverage and then carefully lay down beside the boy. Pulling his wand from inside his sleeve, Draco took off their shoes magically.
"W-what?" Draco looked at the four wizards.
"Yeah?" Potter stopped on his way to the hallway.
"What?"
And then Draco realized something. Why was he kissing Potter? Why was he kissing a boy? He'd never been interested in girls nor boys before, so why now, and why Potter of all people? This was so strange. His heart was beating too quickly. His body was warm and tingling. His focus was only on the softness of Potter's lips, on Potter's warmth, on everything that was so completely Potter.
Right at that time, the pain suddenly scourging the burning skin and the extreme pain brought Draco down into blackness.
"What, Harry?" Ron Weasley came into view, with his girlfriend Granger, "You keep avoiding us, rarely join with us, but you have time with the ferret? What the hell is wrong with you, Harry?"
Potter blinked.
"All right. Let's go then. It's so cold here!" Potter rubbed his upper arms up and down in a quick motion.
Draco blushed.
"'Mione, I was just…around." Potter managed to say between two great gasps of air for his lungs.
"They're on the way." Harry returned to Draco and kissed him but shoved immediately by the blond.
!" Potter put his hands on Draco's shoulders and shook him.
The blond rose up and bent over, embracing his folded legs and sobbing over his knees. He could feel himself trembling hard from the dreams. And when he felt a warm touch on his shoulder, Draco practically jumped back into the wall.
"Ah, did the Dark Lord not tell you? He had planned to make you his apprentice. Such a talented wizard you are, could be powerful if you wanted to work your magic. What a shame, wasting such a potential, Draco. Not good for the Dark Lord when he possesses you later." The Auror eyed Draco.
"Did you watch me at Great Hall times, Potter?" Draco was shocked by the Gryffindor's indirect confession. Potter seemed taken aback by this.
"The ward let you in because of the ring!" Draco hissed and let go of Potter. "What I do with you now?"
"I'll take care of it," Narcissa cut him off and waved her hand, "To the main entrance hall, boys."
Finished with his breakfast, Draco slipped his wand beneath his sleeve and put on a black jumper.
"Your fingers are cold," Potter stated matter-of-factly. "
"Should I use you? I don't know if I'll get a new wand in the future. The possibility is… Should I really use you?" Draco stared blankly at the wand. Contemplating the nearly non-existent chance of having a new wand in the future, Draco took his mother's wand and pointed it to the Elder Wand.
"What the fuck?!" Weaselette stared down at the Malfoy crest-shaped emerald. "It's the Malfoy crest! Why are you wearing Malfoy's ring?" She crushed Potter's fingers hard in her hand.
"Thank you, Professor." Potter smiled at the headmistress.
"Malfoy!" Potter greeted him.
"I… don't really like it there. Anyway, have you talked to the headmistress about your wand?" Potter made eye contact with Draco.
"Don't leave. Please. Just…" Potter whispered into Draco's neck. That pleading voice was broken and heart clenching. It made Draco extremely uncomfortable, he was watery-eyed.
"What! You're mad!" Potter yelled.
"I don't think she will give up and return to Gryffindor Tower." Potter threw his upper body on the bed.
"Well, don't you know what they are?" Potter asked back.
"Oh, oh, I mean we're friends now… Something like that. Now I'm going to sleep. Night, Malfoy." Potter pulled the cover and got back to sleep.
"Potter," Draco greeted the Gryffindor as the boy stood beside him.
"Well, when I dueled Voldemort, he threw a killing curse with the Elder Wand. The curse hit the wand and, um…" Instead of continuing his words, Potter offered the broken wand to Draco, bowing his head, unable to meet the blond's eyes.
With a flick of a wand he took from the nightstand, he answered Harry's lusty gaze. If the gasp came from Harry's mouth was any sign, it meant Draco's well-memorised cleaning and preparation spells worked. Draco raised his body to see Harry's face properly before he experimentally put his middle finger to the rim of Harry's bottom and tease it. A reflex gasp and hands gripping Draco's shoulders encouraged the blond to gently inserting his finger through the slick ring of tight muscle.
"Er…it…is…" Potter glanced at Draco from the corner of his eyes.
Before she noticed the absence of his favorite scarf that was always on his neck on cold days, Draco excused himself and walked out of the Great Hall. When he was back in his room, shortly after he'd closed his door, he heard a knock on the door. Draco opened the door and saw Potter standing before him, his breath short.
"What the hell, Potter?!" Draco tried to push the Gryffindor away but he held his hand.
At one point during the trip toward their chambers, Draco confused himself by thinking, what on Merlin's name was he doing, acting friendly to Harry Potter? His ex-archrival! The boy who annoyed him to hell! The Gryffindor who always haunted his head! Merlin, he must be desperately alone that he talked with Potter now!
"Um, sleeping?" Potter opened his eyes, staring back at Draco who was holding himself back trying not to hit the boy in the head.
"I have a better idea. Come on." Draco manoeuvred his way back toward the west side of Hogwarts.
Morning came and Draco found the Gryffindor boy was still sleeping peacefully. He had noticed lately that Potter's nights contained a distinct lack of any nightmares. Good for the both of them then.
"What the hell! You!" The Auror pointed at Tippy, "You disobey your master's order to stay still! Lucius, you can't even teach your house-elf to obey you? You're a disgrace to Death Eaters!"
"I…I took it from the floor when it slipped off from a jug and fell…" Potter mumbled, tugging sheepishly at his hair.
As he arrived in the Great Hall, the big room was in a ruckus. He walked toward the Slytherin table and took a seat in his favorite spot. He turned to his left and watched the fifth year girls talk over an article of the Daily Prophet they were holding.
"I'm afraid I won't be able to, mother." Draco glanced at Potter.
"Of course I'm serious! I never ma—" Draco's word was cut off with a huff as Harry threw himself against Draco and hugged him so tightly.
"Oh, stupid boy." Draco climbed off of his bed and opened the door that connected his room with the White Room.
"No one to watch your back anymore, Malfoy? Tch, pity." Harper kicked Draco's quill.
"That was amazing, Malfoy! I had to try several times before I could conjure even a non-corporeal form! And you just—you just—" Potter stuttered behind Draco.
Draco made an inexplicable face, and told Potter to sleep because they had to wake up early for the train to Hogwarts.
"Oh, slavery. Just what he needs, mother. I'll be glad to grant it." Draco moved to point his wand at Potter's chest.
"Dunno." Potter shrugged.
Draco stood up with a shock and his body froze, eyes wide open, choked on his own breath.
A knock on his door brought him to awareness. He opened the door and saw Potter fidgeting on his feet.
The Elder Wand transfigured its appearance into Draco's former Hawthorn wand shape.
Draco and Potter approached the portrait and stood a few feet before it.
Draco jolted backward. He had never gotten an erection from touching someone before. But then again, he'd never actually touched anyone like this before. Draco panicked, and he excused himself to take a cold shower and told Potter to do the same because they had breakfast waiting. When Draco finished dressing, it was nine o'clock already. He summoned Tippy and asked if his parents had been upset by his absence at the breakfast table. Tippy told him that his father demanded his presence but his mother told him to leave Draco alone. After that, Draco asked Tippy to serve him and Potter breakfast in his private dining room.
"Of course it's my concern, Malfoy! You are my student!" McGonagall seemed shocked. "How about your parents? Have you told them yet?"
. A dizzy spin later, he was inside Potter's mind. Draco blocked himself from the floods of memories inside the other's head and focused to find a particular spot where Potter might be hiding away. It didn't take Draco long to find the place. At first, he was ignoring it, thinking that it was just a memory having slipped into his block. But the place appeared again and again everywhere Draco searched, and eventually Draco found himself standing before a cupboard below stairs. What an odd place to choose as a shelter.
Anger, at himself because he pitied the boy, because he had caused the boy affliction, because that old Dumbledore knew about yet let the Muggles' torture go on – whatever the torture was –, and because the boy kept it to himself. He wondered if the Weasel and Granger knew about it. Now he really understood why purebloods despised and lowered Muggles. Muggles were worse than Death Eaters. And as if all that wasn't enough already, the discovery that Harry Potter was a Horcrux, that he was actually the Boy-Who-Lived-to-Die, somehow made Draco's heart stop beating. Was that what guilt felt like? Yes, he thought so. That's why he decided to return to Hogwarts and didn't join Blaise and Theo in Durmstrang. It was all because of this boy. Draco had determined to make it up, all his guilty feeling toward Potter, by staying in Hogwarts.
As the lesson began, Draco delicately brewed the Tractura Vesania, a N.E.W.T. level potion. If he might say, the potion should be classed as a potions master level as it was one of the few sophisticated potion ever invented in the Wizarding World. Well, so far. When he became a potions master, someday he would create potions that were so much more complex.
Draco took the hand without hesitation and pushed himself up on his feet. He checked his robe and made little gestures to brush any existent or imaginary dust. He saw Potter take his bag from the cold floor and handed it to Draco.
The only option to know what was happening was by going to library and looking up a book about Unicorns. No way was Draco going to go to the infirmary and let others see the scar of the Dark Mark on his skin. So he took a quick shower, got dressed and grabbed the robe folded on the chair. He searched for his scarf but then remembered where it was. Draco smiled.
"What?" Potter turned his head to see Draco.
"Uh, yes." Potter grabbed two Death Eaters. Draco followed, grabbing the other two for a side-along Apparition.
"Potter, you don't sound convincing." Draco stomped the snow. He was started to get tired of walking.
Draco watched a matching smile spread across Potter's face.
"Potter," Draco greeted the other boy. "Avoiding someone?"
"You cold? Want me to warm you?" Potter pulled out his wand.
The same thing happened, exactly like before. Draco tried again and this time he shouted the spell louder. Same thing happened with no avail. Draco closed his eyes and inhaled deep. He looked at the pieces of his wand and tried the spell he had used for the Vanishing Cabinet.
"Not specifically about the Dark Lord or the Death Eaters?" Draco turned Harry's face to look at him.
It might have been his imagination then, but his ears positively heard the door click open. Afterward, soft footsteps were echoed around the darkened and empty classroom.
"Malfoy, can you hold my wand for a moment?" Potter stopped at the cave's stony wall. Draco took the shining wand, watching Potter slip his hand to a small but wide crack on the stone wall. A moment later Potter's hand reappeared and was now holding a wand.
"Is that why you can't go to Hogsmeade with us tomorrow? Because you'll be with fucking Malf-"
He must have fallen asleep. The light around him was brighter and warmer than before he'd arrived. What time was it now? He still had Advanced Arithmancy classes today.
"I don't snore!" And Potter left his room.
"Is she even in her office now?" Draco asked Potter.
"And how you did you disarm Draco?" the portrait asked.
Draco and Potter were welcomed at the entrance hall by the headmistress.
"Potter, just say it's a map, 'cause I know it is." Draco rolled his eyes and moved to join Potter on the bed.
"Wyvern…" Draco finished Potter's sentence in an awed whisper.
Arrived at his quarters, Draco locked himself in his room. He pulled out his mother's wand and put it on the desk before he sat on the chair. Should he write a letter to his mother immediately, or should he report this to the headmistress first?
Were they having a staring contest now? Because Draco didn't know what he should do or say next. He hoped Potter would initiate an action first. As if reading Draco's mind, Potter moved. He pressed his lips again against Draco's and this time, Potter teased the other's lips with his tongue. Draco gasped at that and Potter used the opportunity to slither his tongue into Draco's mouth. Draco let the other boy explore him. Being a fast learner, a moment later Draco mimicked the gesture. He brushed Potter's bottom lip with his tongue, eliciting a small gasp from the younger boy. Then Draco slipped his tongue into Potter's mouth, stroking the boy's tongue, teeth and the ticklish palate. A moan of pleasure came from Potter. That did something to Draco's lower body parts. Afraid that Potter would notice the excitement of a certain organ, Draco broke the kiss and separated their bodies. His hand on Potter's hair slipped down to his neck. Potter's cold neck. Draco glanced at Potter's neck, and then pulled the boy's jacket open a bit.
"Malfoy, since when are you that generous?" Granger narrowed her eyes. She must have smelt something suspicious.
"What? It's fine!" Potter furrowed.
"Mother, it's—"
"Wh—" Potter cleared his throat, "So why is she still at the manor?"
"Harry, my boy. Ah, Draco, too." Dumbledore eyed them from behind his crescent spectacles.
"I don't know. But after the war, I still have nightmares." Harry looked far away to the sea.
Draco released Potter's wrist and then cancelled the silencing bubble secretly. Draco scoffed at Granger, and when he heard Weasel ask him why he'd been gripping Potter's hand, Draco gave him another scoff.
"One of the sisters," Draco corrected. "It wasn't specified which of them it was."
"Did you not learn from school to not touch dark artefacts with your bare hands, Potter?" Lucius mocked.
"I don't know, Draco. I'm still haunted by the war. Maybe I get traumatized, so better avoid anything involving fight." Harry removed his folded arms from under his head and put them around his torso.
Potter bolted backward at the voice and the sudden appearance of a blond head out of the shadow.
Draco was about to free himself from Potter when he felt the said boy stretch against his body and yawn. The arms encircling Draco's body were tightened. A second later, the boy went still. Draco counted until eleven before Potter raised his head up, very slowly. And then their eyes met.
." Draco pointed the wand to the pieces.
Draco inhaled deep, blinking up at Potter.
"What are you doing, Potter?"
Draco put his scarf back on the bed, waiting for Potter.
"The…what…Ring…Oh, yes." Harry answered slow, still transfixed by the house apparently.
"'Kay. Ready?" Potter pulled out his wand from his pocket.
. Before the ex-Death Eaters could shake off the surprise of the two boys' appearance, Draco disarmed the dark wizard who was casting the unforgivable curse to his father. Potter did the same to the other two dark wizards.
Soon the two of them left the cave and Potter summoned Tenebrus, then they left the freezing rocky mountain. The Elder Wand was nestled peacefully in Draco's pocket.
"Harry! Where have you been?" Granger lunged onto Potter and gave the shocked boy a crushing hug.
"Um, I'm quite comfortable like this." Potter glued his eyes to the box.
Potter stepped backward, swallowing audibly.
"Potter, I'm already late. It's not a vacation or a play. We're dealing with dark artefacts." Draco moved toward a safe area to Disapparate.
Draco's sleep that night was interrupted by a persistent knock on his door. He casted
He pulled out his notebook and a thick Potions Ingredients book from the drawer. Since he'd returned to Hogwarts, he hadn't been able to get furniture support from Potions Professors to experiment with his formulas. Not since his godfather Snape had died… As a result, he could only theoretically check and investigate the ingredients' effects for his formulas. Tonight, he'd planned on rechecking the effect of a half-inch long Dragon Root when mixed with various drop-amounts of forest-green serpent poison, in a brewing process of under 121˚C heat. Draco pulled out a novel from another drawer and tossed it to Potter.
"This is where we're gonna fix your mother's wand. Now, get down and start searching the cave." Potter climbed off the Thestral and told the beast to wait.
unwilling to hand Harry your wand, Draco?" The portrait's eyes twinkled.
"I'll ask you once more, Potter, and I swear I'll enter your mind if you don't tell me right now what my mother asked you!" Draco put his hands on either side of Potter's head and looked down at him.
"This!" Weaselette shoved a folded parchment to Potter. "What are you two doing here?"
"Hi, Malfoy. Um, can I come in?" Potter looked to his side, looking very ready to step into Draco's room.
"Potter, exactly what are you doing here?" Draco eyed the other boy as he balled the Invisibility Cloak and shoved it into his bag. "And bringing your bag."
. "Why is yours still there?"
"What?!" both boys cried in unison.
All eyes were now moved to Harper, waiting for him to cast his
after an entire day of practicing it. "Let me see it."
Potter squeezed Draco's arm in his sleep.
"Take a seat, Malfoy." McGonagall nodded to the armchair before her table as they arrived in her office.
"Um..Malfoy?"
"Ahh!" Suddenly Draco felt a great pain on his left forearm. It felt like a thousand needles thrusting inside his skin. He clutched his left wrist hard.
Potter blinked; his eyebrows rose. He brushed Draco's bottom lip with his thumb.
"Since when are we naked?"
yet."
"I pulled you out from it when you got cursed by the necklace."
"What do you mean can I see them? Of course I can see them! You don't have to use spectacles to see the…the what, anyway?" Draco said, agitated by the question.
"Dumbledore said that when I was completely freed from Voldemort's presence and influence, my own magic, which had been bound by his dark power the whole time on a subconscious level, finally broke free. So, since I'd never used it fully before, it had accumulated and now it just…explodes. And since magic is connected to strong emotions, when I get upset it triggers the magic – drives it wild."
"Congratulation, Harry!" Draco applauded and smirked when Harry rolled his eyes.
"Yes, this morning." Draco looked down at the dark-haired boy. He caught a glimpse of green fabric hidden beneath the robe, looped around the boy's neck. Draco blushed as he recognized it.
Unlike the ground floor, the transparent glass wall on the first floor was covering the front part only. The other three sides along with the floor were fully decorated with mosaic. There was a pair of glass doors on the glass wall to reach the balcony outside which was decorated with blossom ivy. The interior was combination of pastel colours of white, grey and green. It was more luxurious than the ground floor and more personal because the whole first floor was the master suite. On the back side was a pair of grey-wooden doors that connect the room with the exclusive en suite bathroom. It was designed with outdoor concept where two sides of the walls and the roof were glasses. You could see the backyard from there. And the backyard itself was as breathtaking as the whole house. Various flowers were planted in a unique pattern and in the centre ground was a pond aside the green apple tree.
When Potter raised his wand to dismiss the silencing bubble, Draco caught his wrist.
"Professor McGonagall?" Potter called out.
"Let me see." Dumbledore's portrait said.
"P-Potter! Why does it keep doing that to me? Get it off of me!" Draco stuttered. He didn't want the same thing that had involved a hippogriff in his third year to repeat here.
"It's beautiful!" Potter beamed, lifting his right hand and staring at Draco's ring.
"Think the Dark Lord would be stupid enough to mark his spy in the Ministry, Draco?" the Auror said in angst.
. But that wasn't counted. They were common students, expected to be slow at casting such a high enchantment. But he was Draco Malfoy, always the best and fastest of all. They'd been through half the class period and Draco still couldn't conjure anything. Sweat trailed down his face. He started to panic, but he wouldn't show it on his face. What if he couldn't cast the charm? In frustration, Draco threw his wand hand down to his side, clenching his jaw and looking down with cold eyes.
"Yeah."
"Malfoy! Wait!" Potter tapped Tenebrus as he arrived.
"Oh, right." Draco remembered the distrust of the Malfoy name still instilled in the Wizarding Britain.
The tip of the Elder Wand sparked flames and then his left arm was tugged as if the wand itself were pulling it. Draco released his grip on the wand and it fell down to the ground. But it wasn't over yet. When the wand hit the ground, precisely three inches from Draco's broken wand, the flame sparkle shot toward the pieces and before Draco and Potter could blink, pieces of Draco's wand burnt into ashes.
"Draco, it's only for a moment. As soon as all the work in the dungeon finished, you'll get it back again." Narcissa waved her hand. She was really starting to feel uncomfortable with all these outsiders inside the Manor.
Draco noticed the long silence that followed.
Looking at the senior Malfoy, and then at the junior Malfoy, Potter hung his head.
Draco skipped Charm. At noon he intended to take lunch in the Great Hall, hoping Icarus returned with a letter from his mother. Unfortunately, his eagle hadn't returned yet. Draco put the half eaten green apple down on the table and walked out of the hall.
"I'm fine. Just tired." Draco took a step back. "Right. Let's call it a night. To your room, Potter."
"See you tomorrow. Good night, Potter." Draco nodded, showing Potter he understood.
"Did this happen when you tried to break it?" Draco whispered back and saw Potter shake his head. "Hurry, put it back into the wall!"
"What the.." Draco couldn't believe a statue was ignoring them. "Scottish Fold!"
"Why do I have to submit to you? Explain 'submit'."
Draco chuckled. He liked making Potter delighted like that.
"Well, um…I really don't want to see Ginny and I think she was on her way here so please can you let me in?" Potter said in a rush.
"Wait, Malfoy. What was that artefact?" Lambert, the Unspeakable, stopped Draco.
Oh yes, the Slytherin enjoyed the look of surprise on Potter's face. Jaw dropping, eyeballs nearly popping out of their sockets.
"I see. Very well, Malfoy. Go owl your parents and until we find a solution, I'll inform your professors that you are dismissed from any wand classes. But I suggest you attend the classes for the theoretical lessons, if not to participate in the wand practices. Now, out you go."
Draco congratulated himself for Harry's success in passing his N.E.W.T.s with satisfying results. In the Great Hall, he gave Harry a big smile as the Headmistress called out the names of the students who passed NEWT. He received a smirk from Harry when the Headmistress announced Slytherin as the receiver of the House Cup of the year.
"Yes!" Potter said eagerly. The boy's face lit up and he grinned like a fool.
Draco didn't hear the rest of Weaselette words as he closed his door.
It was unexpected, but Draco wasn't surprised either, when he opened his door and found Potter lying on his stomach on the bed.
"That's the only way to get you free from the curse of the necklace. By submitting to me, I will own you." Draco understood Potter's frown at once again having to be under someone else's control. So Draco talked to him again and convinced him that he wouldn't do or ask Potter to do anything, and that he would free him after he woke up. With a hesitant nod, Potter stepped out of the cupboard and they both pulled out back to reality again. When they were back to the Receiving room, Draco ordered Potter to put on the necklace, and then it disappeared from view.
"Harper," Draco spat.
"No. Potter, you have avoided this before and I am hazarding an accurate guess that you will avoid me again later. So, now, Potter, for the last time, I ask you to give me back my wand." Draco was now staring the shorter boy sharp into his eyes. Potter swallowed.
As one, the dark-haired Gryffindor and the blond Slytherin casted their
Draco watched the whole time Potter talked and he saw the Gryffindor had clenched his fists. He also noted that Potter's low voice held anger and a hint of shame.
As Draco heard the whispered charm, warmth immediately embraced him. He gasped in appreciation. He saw Potter's face turned red. Draco wondered if the charm was so strong that its effect radiated out of his body, causing the dark-haired boy to have a touch of the warmth that tinted Potter's rosy cheeks to red.
"Your platinum hair glows in the dark, Malfoy. It was easy to spot you there," Potter said as Draco stood two feet before him.
