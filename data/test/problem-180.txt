"I love you, too." He replied to the now-empty room as he finished getting dressed and slowly made his own way to lunch.
Harry felt Draco's needy hole clench tight around him as his lover orgasmed. It tipped him hard over the edge and not long after he was filling Draco to the brim with hot cum. His own orgasm was so powerful that he went blind for a moment before he collapsed on top of his now sticky boyfriend. When he could move again, he pulled his still semi hard cock out and watched with satisfaction as his creamy jizz leaked out of Draco's gaping and used hole. After he looked his fill, Harry cleaned both Draco and himself with a quick scougify before pulling the covers over them and falling asleep while holding him close. They woke up several times that night only to make love again before cleaning up and falling asleep again. The last time was in the wee hours of the morning. When the first light of dawn touched the sky they fell asleep for the last time that night.
Now, Harry was stuffed and tired. Even better, he felt truly at ease for the first time since he left Draco at the train station a month ago. The Weasleys were great, and he truly had fun with Ron and the twins, but he had missed Draco so much. He had felt like a piece of him was missing for most of the summer and now, with Draco back by his side, he felt whole again. Draco chose that moment to suddenly plop next to him on the bed, startling Harry in the process.
Draco readily complied, swiftly removing his fingers and plunging his entire length deep into his lover. They moaned loudly in unison as Harry's heat wrapped tightly around Draco's thick shaft. Draco was in heaven, nothing could describe the feeling of being balls deep in his Harry as he begged for more. Draco set a punishing pace as he thrust hard into his lover, stabbing his prostate on every thrust. Harry was almost sobbing in pleasure and soon he could only barely hold himself up as he continued to take his boyfriend's long cock. He was calling Draco's name in between moans and he didn't care how wanton he sounded.
"It's okay, Draco." She replied to his silent angst as she put a comforting arm around his shoulders. Encouraged by the physical contact, Draco made his decision.
"What time's it?" Harry replied groggily in a deep sleep-roughened voice. It was a tone that never failed to shoot directly down below Draco's proverbial belt.
Draco woke slowly the next morning, pleasantly sore and warm, in his boyfriend's arms. Harry was still peacefully slumbering so Draco took the opportunity to lovingly gaze at his boyfriend's handsome face while it was free of worries. He was so breath-taking and he loved him. Thinking back to early that morning, he could barely contain his joy at the knowledge that Harry loved him back. He never thought that his attraction would've ever been returned much less his feelings for the dark haired boy next to him. It felt like a dream as he continued to watch Harry's every expression. He even found the way his hair had managed to stick in every direction as he slept adorable.
"Can you please be nice to the rest of my friends? I really like you and I would really like them to like you as well. Please?" Harry looked up through his eyelashes at him and he was lost.
After a few pumps Harry seemed to become impatient. He roughly kicked off his pants completely and, after casting a very familiar lubrication charm, reached behind himself to push a finger into his hot hole. He groaned loudly then continued pumping his cock. Soon, he added a second and then a third finger. His whole boy was flushed and he was panting and moaning with abandon. Draco couldn't tear his eyes away from the erotic sight. Technically he knew he should leave him to it, but the sight of Harry Potter thrusting three fingers in and out of himself while wanking his impressive-sized cock was making Draco harder than he ever remembered being in his life. So Draco stayed and watched his rival become more and more undone as the minutes passed.
"Because I'm in love with Harry Potter." He whispered, hoping not to be overheard by the house elves. They would tell his father if his father asked them.
Draco enjoyed the sight of the sexy guy in front of him flushed from desire and furiously pumping his cock to a fantasy that was presumably about himself before a whispered 'Draco' gave him the opening he needed.
"Invisibilia mihi." Draco whispered while pointing his wand at the door. The door went completely see-through, but only for Draco. Harry would still only see a solid door and no one else that happened to walk by would be able to see inside the room either. The spell was a good tool for spying.
"Okay, Cissy. Please call me Harry." He replied. Draco was pleased and yet again amazed by his mother's hosting ability. She could immediately tell how out of place Harry felt and knew exactly how to make him feel more comfortable.
"So...um, Draco?" Draco just looked up at him and quirked an eyebrow in question. "Would you...I mean to say...Do you want to be my boyfriend?" Harry asked quietly as his face flamed in embarrassment. Draco looked so surprised at the question that Harry shrank back, preparing himself for rejection.
"We only really use that area of the house for entertaining. Business dinners and the like." Draco explained as they walked. "The area ahead is where we actually live." Draco watched Harry's expression closely as they entered his family's dining room. The room was much smaller than Harry had seen from the manor so far, and much more intimate. It was still beautifully decorated but only had a six person table instead of the twenty person monstrosity he had spied through a door on the way there. Draco's mother had the house elves prepare a light lunch as it was near time for it, which was already on the table waiting for them as they entered.
"Baby, it's time to get up." Draco said loudly. He had figured out the first time they slept in the same bed that Harry was a rather deep sleeper and wouldn't hear anything below a loud voice next to his ear. A leftover, Draco assumed, from years of having to try to sleep through his 'family's' shenanigans over the years. At the sound of his voice, Harry grumbled cutely before barely cracking one eye open to look at him.
His muscles turning to jelly, Draco unceremoniously collapsed on top of Harry after his orgasm. Harry was the direct opposite of angry about it though, as he just wrapped his arms around the blond haired man until he had the strength to move again. Draco settled next to Harry when he regained the ability to move and they basked in the glow of their time together for a few minutes. It was when Draco made a moved to get dressed and leave that the fact that they hadn't mentioned any change in their current relationship occurred to Harry. He sat up on the bed before getting Draco's attention.
"What do you want Harry?" Ginny asked in a hostile tone. It was the first time he had ever heard her speak so harshly to anyone and it took him aback a little.
"Umm...well...I just wanted to say sorry. This..." he motioned back towards the Great hall "...is why I turned you down. I already knew I had feelings for him." Harry replied honestly. Her tears just started to fall faster.
"I..It's nice to meet you too, Mrs. Malfoy. You have a lovely home." Harry replied as politely as he could.
While Draco watched, Harry laid down on the bed and pulled up his shirt. Draco blushed as he saw Harry's naked and leanly muscled chest for the first time. Harry then started to caress his own chest, pinching and toying with his nipples occasionally before his hands wandered all the way down to unbutton and unzip his school pants. His hand then slowly dipped inside and grabbed his sizable erection. Draco heard a soft moan as he began to pump up and down and felt his face turn scarlet. Apparently Harry Potter came here to wank.
He looked up at his fair haired boyfriend in disgruntlement before instantly calming as Draco ran his fingers through Harry's hair. He always loved it when Draco did that. He loved it when Draco touched him in general. Harry sighed in contentment and gave Draco an adoring look that Draco just couldn't resist. He leaned down, capturing all too willing lips in a slow and heated kiss.
"Yeah!" Pansy interrupted "It wasn't easy to keep you away from Harry long enough for this to work and everyone else contributed to the decorating and snacks." A chorus of 'Yeah's followed her remark, which only made Draco laugh happily.
So it was with a heavy heart that Draco bid Harry goodbye (with a long and lingering kiss) before they exited platform nine and three quarters. He physically hurt when he watched the man he loved leaving with a tubby mustachioed man that seemed to have a perpetual scowl on his face. Draco watched him until he could no longer see him before turning away, only to find his mother directly behind him and gazing at him knowingly. Draco paled in fear before relaxing as his mother smiled and enveloped him in a tight hug. They then found a secluded corner of the muggle train station to disapparate home.
"But why?!" She wailed loudly. "We're meant to be together, Harry. It's just a matter of time! I knew you were shy and a bit slow on the uptake, but I thought you knew that!" She started sobbing uncontrollably into her hands. Harry was at a loss. He had no idea how to comfort her or even if he should, and absolutely no idea what he should say.
"You remember that present I mentioned?" Harry asked and Draco nodded in response. Harry stood so his steel-hard cock was in full view. "I'd like to give you this, if you'll let me. It's okay if you don't though." Harry continued nervously. Draco was shocked as they had never really talked about switching before, but the thought of Harry deep inside him undeniably turned him on more than he thought it would.
Harry felt like he would never be able to stand again. He was so blissfully exhausted that Draco had to wash them both as it took all Harry had to continue standing. Draco didn't mind though. He was happy as long as he got to be near Harry. After they were clean, Draco dried them both with magic before tucking his sleepy boyfriend into bed. He laid next to him after extinguishing the lights, pulling him close and whispering words of love as they both fell into a deep and peaceful slumber.
Draco moaned loudly as he was being penetrated. Harry had done a spectacular job at opening him up as all he felt was pleasure. He threw his head back in ecstasy as Harry carefully entered him. When he finally bottomed out inside him, Draco was impatient for him to move. He appreciated that Harry was trying not to hurt him but he was so far gone into his desire that he just desperately needed to be railed as hard as Harry could.
"He's a hot git." was his only reply before Hermione saved him by reminding everyone of the potions test later that day. Everyone groaned and started to lament their lack of studying over the last few days and Harry ate the rest of his food in peace. He shot her a grateful smile before catching Ginny getting up to leave out of the corner of his eye. Excusing himself, Harry quickly followed her out of the great hall.
"I know." Narcissa stated. Draco just gaped at her with his mouth slightly ajar. She laughed in response. "You've only obsessed over him since you met him. He's all you talk about over your holidays and I've noticed that you haven't written anything about him in your letters recently. I also saw the way you looked at him at the train station."
"Tell me, my answer to your question depends on your answer to mine." Draco said. Harry sighed in defeat before answering.
"Never, my darling boy. I'm so proud of the young man you've become." She hugged him tightly. Love for his mother swelled in his chest and he squeezed her in return.
"Cum again for me, my love." Draco demanded in a tone that brooked no arguments and demanded compliance. Harry's weeping cock obeyed before his mind could even process the words and he painted the shower wall in sticky white spunk. Draco followed soon after, rapidly filling Harry's used hole with his own jizz. He could no longer hold back when he felt the inner walls of Harry's ass spasming as he orgasmed.
"I have a boyfriend." He said past the lump in his throat. His mother nodded in encouragement and he continued. "I really love him, mom. It hasn't been very long that we've been together, but I know that he's the one already. I want to spend the rest of my life with him." He looked directly into her eyes as he said the last part. Draco desperately wanted her to know how serious he was.
Harry shook his head in reply before returning to his task. Soon he inserted a magically lubed finger into Draco. He only moaned in response and thrust his hips back against the digit in attempt to take more. Harry smiled in response and carefully worked him until a second finger could join the first. He added more lubrication occasionally and soon a third finger joined the other two. Draco was a panting sweaty mess by the time this happened. He was now begging Harry to put his talented mouth to use around his leaking cock. Harry just shook his head before removing his fingers from Draco's ass. Draco suddenly felt empty, and he didn't like it. He looked down to find Harry looking lovingly up at him.
Mostly Harry just wandered the neighborhood during the day. He had the presence of mind when he was picking up his school supplies last year to convert a little of his money into muggle currency so he could buy food from convenience stores or cafes. It made it much easier as it meant he didn't have to go home at all during the day and the Dursleys weren't complaining so much when he was there because he had very little interactions with them.
"Yes! Draco, I'm cumming!" Harry cried out almost instantly after he felt the digit finally enter him. Draco smiled around Harry's cock, but didn't let Harry pull out of his mouth. A few seconds later, Harry blasted rope after rope of hot cum directly into his willing boyfriend's mouth. Draco swallowed all he gave him eagerly. There was so much that he could barely keep up, but he didn't let any escape.
"But mom, it's not that simple." Tears started to silently fall down his face. He wiped them away in irritation.
After Harry squirted his last drop of cum, Draco promptly rose and turned Harry around. He then bent him over, telling him to brace his hands on the wall in front of him. Harry did so obediently. He knew what was coming next and despite already cumming, he wanted it. He wanted Draco to fill him up. Immediately Draco pushed two lubed fingers into his tight asshole, making Harry moan in renewed lust. He worked Harry hard, adding a third finger moments later and stretching him as quickly as he could without hurting him. The time apart seemed to have made him tighter than usual and Draco couldn't wait to pound into him. It wasn't long before Harry was begging for Draco to replace his fingers with his cock.
"She asked me out a few months ago, but I turned her down because I don't like her like that. It didn't help that just before she asked me out I figured out...nevermind. All you need to know is that we aren't together and never have been." Harry said.
As for Draco, he was great. He finally had the man who had made him realize he like men in his bed and on his arm. For the first time in his young life he was truly happy. For every meal they met in front of the Great Hall so they could chat and hold hands before they had to separate to their respective tables, and they spent every weekend together. Draco had met Ron and Hermione 'officially' during this time as well. He apologized for his past behavior and while they weren't best friends immediately, they were well on their way to being acquaintances at least.
"So," he said loudly, startling Harry out of his fantasy. Harry's faced went pale and he looked terrified. "You jack off to fantasies about me, huh?" Draco continued. Harry sputtered, attempting to deny the accusations.
"Call me Cissy, " She replied. "As crazy about you as my Draco is, we should be on familiar terms, no?" She smiled warmly. "And don't worry, the private rooms are much less uppity." She said with a wink. Harry immediately relaxed and returned her warm smile with one of his own.
Draco had known that he found Harry attractive for a while now. He also knew that he, by his own nature, had absolutely no chance of getting into his pants. The fact that he thought Harry was straight was a big factor in that assumption, as well as the fact that he was supposedly dating the Weasley girl. She had been telling everyone she came into contact with that she was dating Harry Potter. Still, Draco found it suspicious that they were never seen together.
"Since when did you even think he's hot? It was only a couple days ago you called him a git." Dean retorted. Harry shrugged again.
Harry knew that her behavior was bad, but having seen how the Weasleys treat it as her being young and silly he had also started to treat it that way. Knowing Draco was being harsh to protect him had softened his stance enough that he could try to see it through Draco's eyes. Of course he would be mad when someone was being so awful to his boyfriend. If someone was spreading similar rumors about Draco, Harry would be livid. Harry bit his lip in thought as he tried to formulate a response. He looked into Draco's stormy blue eyes and made a decision.
"Oh Harry, you feel so good inside me. Pease, baby, I need you to fuck me hard." At those words, Harry's control completely snapped and he reared his hips back only to slam them back into the tight and previously virgin hole of his sexy boyfriend. He slammed into him over and over until they were both drenched in sweat and Draco was almost sobbing with the need to cum. Still, Harry ploughed him until he himself was close to cumming. Then he grabbed Draco's weeping dick and pumped him in time to his hard thrusts. A few seconds later, Draco cried out as he came hard, painting both himself and Harry in thick ropes of sticky white jizz.
"I figured out that I was attracted to guys. More specifically I figured out that I was attracted to you. Happy?" Harry grumbled while looking down at his lap.
Finally, Harry seemed to be close. His hands sped up as his moans became more frantic and broken. There were now words occasionally thrown in with the groans, and Draco was surprised to learn that Harry Potter was fantasizing about someone fucking him as there were a lot of 'please' and 'more' and 'fuck me's thrown in between his panting. This realization made Draco even more turned on as he wondered who the lucky guy was.
"Please Draco! Fuck me. I need your thick cock stretching me open now!" Harry almost screamed in frustration. Fingers felt good but they weren't enough.
"Okay, I understand where you're coming from, and you're right. Her behavior was terrible and you were justified in how you handled it." Draco looked shocked at the sudden turn of events which made Harry chuckle again. "Can I make a request though?"
Draco takes a sip of tea, forcing it down past eggs and toast that are suggesting they might make a reappearance.
and marry a woman. But… he wouldn’t… and finally Abraxas, my grandfather was born.” There’s an odd tremble in Draco’s voice.
someone… and you don’t want to tell me… I only meant that you don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to.”
“Do you know the answer, though, Malfoy?” Potter asked. Draco still thought the hand on his shoulder felt nice, warm and comforting.
Draco wonders what in hell Potter’s done with his house elf… “Where’s Kreacher?” he asks abruptly, still holding the wall for support.

“A spatula. My aunt… she would have hit me with the flat part, I think. But I was struggling and…” Harry shrugs a bit, “well… she caught me with the edge. It bled a lot.”
“I’m sorry, love. Male pregnancies can be extremely unstable. It just wouldn’t be safe… not until we know for sure what’s going on.”
He says it in that off-hand way that he uses when he is avoiding saying something that is truly terrible. He says it in that way that makes Draco want to storm over to the Dursley’s house—Draco’s take the trouble to learn where it is—and torture them with the most vicious, most excruciating, Cruciatus curse he can muster.

Slowly Potter brought his head, his lips, to Draco’s neck and gently kissed the topmost point of the scar. He pulled back slightly, his eyes flicking to Draco’s, and when Draco didn’t respond with anger or horror or anything really, Potter brought his lips back to his neck, just a little lower and kissed again. Potter’s lips slid down the scar… down Draco’s neck, across his chest, over his stomach… inch by inch, Potter used his lips and tongue to kiss… caress… almost
, all right? I just… I just wanted to be able to get something to eat. It’s been days… I had a coffee yesterday… but before that… I don’t know. I just thought…”
Draco is there, at the coffee shop, studying. His exams are coming up with the speed, and apparently the force, of a freight train… making him testy. The dark circles under his eyes rival Harry’s. He has his notes (color coded!) spread out on the table before him, and he is nibbling at the end of his pen, looking like they very opposite of the Draco Malfoy he knew and hated from his Hogwarts days.
Harry’s own hands drop back to Draco’s feet, gently ghosting up his ankles, his eyes never leaving Draco’s.
“Well, Zabini and Parkinson were never Marked so… Zabini went to the States, New York, I think. But it might have been Boston, or even Chicago. And Parkinson went to live with a great-aunt or something. In Tokyo.”

Finally Draco can’t take it anymore. “Everything is wonderful, Harry,” he says at last. “Thank you.”
Draco allows himself to be led up the basement steps and up two more flights of stairs, past dark and dusty rooms. By the time Potter stops, Draco is trying desperately to hide the fact that he is winded and in pain. There are black spots dancing before his eyes.

“Draco… that was…” Words have escaped him. “I… I… I didn’t know you could play,” Harry finishes lamely.
He carefully wrapped up the tiny, animated, jewel-encrusted dragon, ignoring the fact that it was snapping at him.
Malfoy is still holding his hand. “You’re going to have to keep that bandaged for a couple of days, or Adelle will get suspicious. It was bleeding like a war wound.”
Harry finishes tightening a bolt and carefully places the wrench back in its box. He wipes his hands on a greasy rag; Draco couldn’t have said whether the hands or the rag is getting filthier from the exercise.
that Luna is not touching him, but he finds himself being moved—like a small boat on a breeze—out of the crowded kitchen and into the quiet of the garden. There is a bench, and Luna shepherds him to it and sits beside him, her should almost, but not quite, touching his.
Slytherin house rather enjoyed keeping track of their fights, some of which were epic. Harry joins him as Weasley shouts that if boiling pasta and heating up jarred sauce constitutes cooking then ordering takeaway does.
For a moment he just looked at the locket, tracing the ugly “S” with his fingers. He didn’t try to open it.
As the notes drift from violent to exquisite, wisps of oxygen begin to find their way back into Harry’s lungs. He watches Malfoy take a deep breath. He feels a tear drip off his cheek and splash down onto his collarbone.
sorry… for all of it. I’ll do whatever you want. But do we really have to… to… fuck? What if I really did just want a quiet night in, watching the telly… and wanted you to join me? Would that be enough?”
“A living hell? Come on, Draco. Don’t you think you’re being a little melodramatic?” The corners of Hermione’s mouth turn up a bit. “I mean I know his aunt and uncle didn’t understand magic… and that they were very strict. But it’s not like they beat him… or… or starved him!”
Draco leans into Harry… trying to decide if he feels better or worse than he did the day before… trying to decide if it even matters…
“I went to the coffee shop this morning. By myself.” He thinks sounds a touch petulant. Like a toddler who is of the firm opinion that he can dress himself.
Weasley never goes noticeably pale, but sometimes his freckles stand out more than usual. Now they are practically leaping off his face.
Somehow Harry took the attack that made up very worst moments of Draco’s life, looked it briefly in the eye, and then simply pushed it aside, giving it no more attention than it deserved. And then turned around and gave Draco the all space… all the gentle support… to feel everything
friend than his father’s; he was a Seventh Year, Head Boy, top marks, excellent family connections, the undisputed king of Slytherin house the year Draco first came to Hogwarts. He had already achieved every goal Draco had set for himself.
“He’s not going to leave,” Harry says, using the tone he perfected post-War, the tone that brought immediate results, the tone that insured that Draco was able to stand beside him now and was not rotting away in a cell in Azkaban. “He’s here with me.”
Harry to test the theory. Part of him is terrified of what he will learn if he does. None of it matters… Harry won’t do anything until he is positive Draco is ready.
that escaped with the music, tucking them back into the calm exterior that he wears, Harry knows for certain now, like armor. “I don’t have a piano… anymore.”
Draco dropped the glass, which shattered on the floor, as black spots swam before his eyes. He clutched the Dark Mark, biting back screams.
As his orgasm tears through him, painting them both in sticky ropes, it leaves him sobbing and choking on the word he can’t say:
“I did, as a matter of fact,” Draco says. Victoire is not an impolite child, and she is utterly silent as he responds. It is a relief to hear his deeper voice. “Miss Harding told me. She says you’ve been working very hard.”
The scar ended at Draco’s hipbone and Potter stopped, kneeling there for a moment or two, his hands circling Draco’s legs, looking completely unsure.
Normally, he thinks coffee shop normally smells amazing… bitter coffee and behind that sweetness—chocolate, of course, and vanilla, hazelnut, and raspberry—all held together with steamed milk. There is a gentle medley of perfume and cologne carried in and out by the patrons, the constant note being the spicy jasmine scent his boss, Adelle, wears. Then, subtle and almost unnoticeable, is the books—all used, littering the coffee tables and jammed on a rickety bookshelf, just waiting to be read again—with tastes of cigarette smoke and sunshine hidden between their covers.
Draco pulls on the drawstring of Harry’s pajama bottoms and slips his hand inside. And Harry’s eyes pop open, startled.
She showed him how to spread a handkerchief out on the ironing board, how to mist it gently, how to smooth the wrinkles out with his fingers first.
Harry is required to leave a urine sample. Then O’Brien draws some blood, takes some invasive swabs, and ask even more invasive questions. She looks into his eyes and ears and throat. She listens to his heart and lungs and takes his blood pressure. She pokes at him with her cold hands.
Harry still doesn’t like to cook, but he had discovered the joys of bread-making. And a loaf of warm-from-the-oven bread, along with a pile of fresh greens, will turn even the simplest bowl of soup into a delicious, hearty meal.
“No.” His eyes drift from Charlie to Draco and he feels his face lighten into an almost-smile. “I’m staying here.”
They lie in bed as the nights grow shorter and shorter… making gentle love with hands and lips. Flannel gives way to thin cotton and Draco’s whole body aches for Harry’s touch.
When I could convince myself to go out, I would drink myself almost blind and then go home with… whoever would have me. I’d fuck them and be out of their beds before dawn.
“At the Manor…,” Harry says, his voice heavy, “you didn’t save me because it was the right thing to do… or because you thought I was destined to save the world. You saved me because I’m
Potter stares at him, disbelief and uncertainty scrawled across his face. “I still want you to hurt me,” he says.
His lips brush Harry’s… softly at first, then harder. Harry feels himself gasping, feels Lance’s tongue, sure and demanding, inside his mouth. A firm hand on his hip pulls him close and Harry can feel Lance, hard against him, through his half-buttoned trousers.

Harry as he dries him carefully. Harry as he helps into soft flannel pajama bottoms and one of those stupid Muggle why-shirts, or whatever it is Harry calls them. This one is ratty and smells like Harry.
“Please! Please, don’t hurt me!” Malfoy’s wand clattered onto the flagstones and he pushed it away. Deftly, Ron pocketed it.
He reaches out gently running the backs of his fingers down the side of Harry’s cheek, barely touching. Harry doesn’t stir.

He walks her every day, finding himself straying farther and farther from his little sphere, until he knows the neighborhood—and even some of the people in it—fairly well.
Harry’s quiet a moment, his smile slipping off his face. “I almost wish I hadn’t joined the Gryffindor team.” His voice is almost too soft to hear. “I mean I
Potter opened his mouth for a moment, then closed it. Suddenly Potter’s bright green eyes met his own, almost as if asking a question.
He wears tee-shirts and jumpers when he can get away with it… and when he can’t, he buys shirts and dress robes charmed to be wrinkle-free. The charms barely function, but who, really, is going to care if the Savior of the Wizarding World’s clothes look a bit rumpled.
. Harry, just keep holding him. Draco—” Draco became aware of a hand gripping is un-Marked wrist, and how her voice became utterly soothing and utterly confidant “—I need you to move this hand, that’s it, I’m going to take care of that, but you need to keep still….”
of it… that’s okay!” The words burst from Draco causing them both to jump. The lights flicker again.
Sunlight is streaming in the windows of Grimmauld Place when Draco opens his eyes. Harry is beside him, his eyes closed, black lashes resting against golden skin, the blankets twisted horribly around naked arms and legs. Draco props himself up on an elbow… just enjoying the chance to watch Harry sleep.
Dolores Umbridge (who for all of the Dark Lord’s reign, was claiming kinship with the ancient pureblood Selwyn family and is now claiming to be Margaret Thatcher’s third cousin, once removed) cleverly turned the idea of—to use the polite term,
The boy didn’t seem to know where to place his eyes and they flicked from the ground before his feet to the Dark Lord and, on occasion, to where his parents were standing—Lucius, passive; Narcissa, her legendary composure failing her, her arm tightly in her husband’s grasp—with the waiting Death Eaters.
pyjamas—he sleeps in his boxers and a tee-shirt if it’s warm, or baggy sweats if it isn’t. Tonight he’s wearing sweatpants so large that I expect he has to hold them up when he walks, and a faded, threadbare Gryffindor tee-shirt that is at least one size too small. It makes him look so fucking fit… and like a lost child.
A part of Harry knows she’s only crossed the room… that she’s picking up her book… settling in before the fire… He doesn’t look. He
He lies to his mother about his eating and sleeping habits—they don’t exist, but he assures her that he sleeps soundly and that he’s eating well.
His hands shake as the smell of the steaming milk twists its way through his nostrils—he wrinkles them, but it’s no use—and up into his sinuses.

That thought slammed into Draco, causing his breath to come in sharply, but he pushed it away. He refused to think of that Death Eater now… because whatever

He’s not Victoire’s teacher—that’s a Miss Harding. He teaches the older children. In fact, he’ll likely be Teddy’s teacher next year, Andromeda says.
He expected the Mark to be raised, to feel it rough against his lips—but all he feels is the softness of Draco’s inner arm.
The garden is overrun, but the heady smell of blooming flowers is thick in the sultry nighttime air. It’s not really dark, and the sky is rich velvet blue, speckled with stars.
“Oh, I think he minds a little. But he always comes back to me, so I guess he doesn’t mind too much.” A wink. “Besides. It’s just a hook-up, right? It doesn’t mean anything.”
His shoulder aches a little, his arm is at a funny angle… his hand is holding something. Another hand. He moves his thumb, a soft, sweeping motion against the hand, and several long blinks later, it squeezes back, reassuring.
“If you’ve already filled out the form, Mr. Potter, you certainly don’t need to fill it out again.” Smile. “In fact, if Mr. Malfoy, here, can confirm your identity…”
Harry likes him, admires him, maybe, and he can’t help but wonder if this Malfoy is even new at all… was he always there, and without Voldemort insuring that they were born enemies would he have seen it right away? Would they have been friends?
. You could never be. And I’m coming back after class.” And, almost as if he knows Harry is opening his mouth to object, he adds, “I’ll play for you.”
Potter’s smile returns. Genuine and full. “Yeah. Sometimes people go out to a special theatre to see them… but you can watch them at home, too. I like that better, if I’m being honest. Do you want to pour the wine while I set this up?” Potter asks, standing up.
The children of the Death Eaters and their sympathizers were remanded to the custody of the newly formed Reparations Company, Incorporated… for a period of time to be determined by the crimes of their parents. They were stripped of all legal rights—stripped of their very
“I thought you would be… gentle,” Malfoy says, his voice still disconcertingly soft, his eyes looking anywhere by Harry. “I thought I’d be safe with you.”
have a uterus, do you? In a male pregnancy the baby grows in a special… womb… fueled by your combined magic. If you try to separate it too soon… Harry, you could
“He would have found you,” Harry said with certainty, not letting go of Draco’s hands. “He would have brought you back…”
When the light was at its brightest, a small bowl of gruel appeared. It was tepid and tasteless, and Draco, trembling with the effort, ate every last bite.
, and so much better than the little cot he’s given by the Company. When he wakes, Mockridge will be gone, but breakfast will have been ordered, and Draco can take a leisurely,
“It’s just…” Harry pauses, the desire for honesty and the desire for privacy… and maybe even the desire to not upset Draco… are clearly at war with each other.
Draco looks up in time to see that Mr. Ainsworth is holding the door, and tipping his hat to a sea of bouncing red curls.
“Can I move now?” Harry asks, his voice ragged. “Because I really, really want to kiss you right now.”
roses now and they curtain over the garden bench in the purest white and the most passionate red. Here and there a rose the color of first love blooms, whisper pink.
The fire is all around me. Hot. It hurts to breathe. And Harry Potter is flying towards me… reaching out for me… his hand closing around mine.
The table is clean at any rate and I watch as he opens the sack, pulling out cartons of rice and curried lamb, chicken masallah, beef vindaloo.
“I thought you’d be back for this,” he says, his voice is gravely and pleasant. “You’ve read the first two, I take it?”
An odd, soft look crosses Harry’s face. Two tears fall. He leans his face into Draco’s hand, and more tears fall.
Weasley eyes him suspiciously. “Cross Stitch? Isn’t that a kind of sewing? I mean, Hermione knits sometimes, but…”
I let Draco lead me inside. The walls are stone and polished wood panels, and even though this is technically a Muggle school, I can feel the magic tingle around me.
“Why would you want a motorbike?” he asks instead. “Those things are death traps.” He rolls over, pinning Harry underneath him. “You’ll get killed.”
The sun is out now, but it has been raining for three days and the garden is overrun with weeds. The garden is in a bit of a lull at the moment. The flush of springtime and early summer blooms have faded and the dark jewels of autumn flowers have not yet begun.
… because of me… and they gave me the money anyway. I gave that to Fred and George so they could start their joke shop.”
“I mean… that other stuff… I could definitely do without. But the glitter’s… kind of…” Potter’s voice trails away into almost, but not quite, inaudibility, “hot.”
“If that’s what you want. But, just to be clear, are you comfortable with me discussing anything—your medical history, any results I might discover,
“Phineas, will you please inform Kreacher that I will leave Draco’s things in the front hall within the half-hour,” Severus said, folding the last few items and binding them neatly into a bundle.
Draco’s playing something soft… something light… and his hands move up and down the keyboard teasing out a melody that reminds Harry of a friendly creek tumbling over stones… of the way the sunlight would dance on that water… of early fall leaves drifting down, becoming little boats…
He is strong, but the hands are stronger. With horrifying suddenness, he finds himself face down, the hard stone of the floor digging into is cheekbone.
“Another time… maybe the soup kitchen, or a pet shelter, or to the old folks home, or to a school that needs volunteers, or to the pediatric ward in the hospital… some of those kids are
In the post-Voldemort world, it isn’t enough that the Dark Lord is dead… and that the worst of his Death Eaters will die in Azkaban. It doesn’t matter that the term “Death Eater” is thrown around so casually as to have caught an alarming number of Slytherin House alumni and pureblood families in its snare… sometimes with no evidence of ever having associated with the Dark Lord or any of his followers.
“I asked Kreacher to bring us something to eat. I didn’t… I didn’t think you’d want to go down for dinner.”
Lucius Malfoy will die in Azkaban. Malfoy Manor was burned to the ground, ostensibly to destroy the remnants of dark magic that lingered in the walls—in reality, it was simple revenge. Narcissa retired to a small Black holding near Paris.
You are my godson! You are the closest thing I will ever have to a child of my own! How could you possibly think…?”
“The others?” Draco asks. He never saw anyone else… but there must have been other people who worked there.
Emotions flit across Harry’s face… concern… respect… fear… others Draco can’t quite discern… jealousy, maybe. Harry’s eyes are wide, open to him. With a little probing he could probably find out. But he doesn’t.
Draco allows himself to exist only in the space between Potter’s hair, silky under his fingertips… and Potter’s fingers, gentle on his cheek… and their hands, intertwined again.
Around the cabin, the snow melts and the little creek rages through the valley. Harry’s nightmares fade. The days lengthen and Harry spends his time hiking and helping Charlie to chop firewood for a winter he knows he will not spend on the mountain.
Malfoy gives him a rare smile. “Hermione helped me get all the papers I needed to enroll in the course.”
“Thank goodness! We were starting to worry,” the face attached to them says. Adelle. “You’ve been asleep for almost three hours.”
But the idea of him being tortured… The anguish in Harry’s eyes told him this was torture, true and sadistic, and
Except for the occasional spark of rage that goes as quickly as it comes and usually leaves a tragedy behind it… he feels nothing.
“They hated me.” Harry doesn’t sound particularly bitter, though Draco certainly thinks he should. He decides to let it go.
And if suddenly Harry’s clothes all lose their rumpled look… well, both he and Harry pretend not to notice.
He goes to the market and returns with piles of fresh vegetables. The kitchen always smells like spices.
In his thoughts, fuzzy and barely in view, there is a child, maybe more than one, who he loves and spoils with cream buns and teaches to fly…
He feels raw and naked and more fragile than he has… maybe ever. It takes him a while to realize: the fog is gone. It disappeared in the night, like fog does after wind and a heavy rain.
Draco picks up the book… the girl’s face has captivated him. But he’s also almost afraid to open it. The girl, with her dark hair and green eyes, looks terrified.
Harry sits back, feeling suddenly and inexplicably better. Malfoy hands him a damp paper towel to wipe his face.
He Floos into their flat with only moments, really, to get ready for yet another Ministry gala, which is just part of dating Harry Potter.
Charlie’s body is muscled and golden and lightly dusted with hair the color of sunrises. There are freckles… and so many scars: the shiny patches of healed burns on his hands and arms, raised lines that Harry can find, even with his eyes closed, and dozens of spots of silver that disappear when he blinks, or when the light from the fire shifts. Charlie’s body is strong enough that it can rise above him, supporting itself for hours while Charlie kisses him, while he moves slowly inside him, reducing Harry’s whole world to a touch… a taste… a soft groan of pleasure.
“I know what I look like,” Malfoy says, with almost no bite at all. “In the past forty-eight hours, I’ve had three midterms and two twelve-hour placements, the last of which was more like fourteen because one of the
Charlie doesn’t try to make him speak… but he touches him gently, his shoulder, his cheek, his hand, as he walks past.
My hands are shaking. My breath is coming short. My heart is quivering in my chest. Maybe he doesn’t really want anything to do with me. Maybe he only came over yesterday because he thought I wouldn’t be able to take proper care of Victoire.
A small pop signaled the return of the house-elf. He had a pile of fluffy towels under one arm and a huge bowl of broth in the other.
expected Potter to throw him out onto the street… but he had, honestly, expected to be tortured for information. He had expected rage, pain, humiliation… and certainly incarceration. Still, he had come because
Running into old classmates at work… How one of the children from the pediatric ward Harry visits seems to be responding well to treatment… The Cannons and the fact that they are second-to-last this year, a dramatic improvement over the norm…
Time freezes like that, him a step below me. Victoire asleep in her room. Dirty dishes waiting in the sink.
Draco managed to eat the soup, and even a little of the fish, but, hungry as he was, the heavier courses were beyond him and he merely pushed the food around on his plate.
Draco can feel the sneer falling from his face. He hesitates a moment, and then whispers a price that will buy him, maybe, a couple of days’ worth of meals.
But Draco cannot go with him. He doesn’t even really wish he could; he is done with things that hurt… and holding a sick child… a child that might die… that’s not a pain he’s willing to accept. Not even for Harry. Not even for the child.
“You just disappeared… and I never got the chance to say… I have to tell you that I want you… that I just want to
He likes the old man. Mr. Ainsworth, a Muggle, obviously, grew up working in the bookshop… before inheriting it from his father. He has no children—only a nephew, studying marine biology, who comes in occasionally to help.  Mr. Ainsworth is soft-spoken, refers to Draco as “my boy” as if he means it, and plies him with tea. He doesn’t talk much.
Draco moves slowly. Carefully. Harry’s eyes are emeralds, dark and uncut, light glinting off the raw edges.
“Oh, that’s rich, coming from you,” Harry says, pulling on schoolboy sniping to get him through the exchange.  “I don’t suppose you’ve looked in a mirror lately.”
Technically, Draco is trapped. Shelves rise up on either side of him; his back is to the thick stone of the castle wall. There isn’t even a window.
Suddenly Draco finds his arm firmly in Potter’s grasp… there is a swirl and the nauseated feeling of Apperating unexpectedly, that can
“Maybe. It might have something to do with the lash… or that no one was allowed to help me tend them…” Malfoy’s voice fell away.
Draco isn’t even sure what he’s asking for. To be fucked by Harry Potter? Maybe. To have Harry Potter sweep in and set everything to rights? If only that were possible.
Without quite meaning to, Severus found himself reaching for the boy. He was trembling, and he leaned into Severus’s touch in a way that alarmed the older man deeply. Last year Draco had been a fox in a trap, snapping at the hands that tried to help him. Now he was passive.
, sharp and raw, in Harry’s voice. He doesn’t turn around. He can’t bear to see the look on Harry’s face.
Harry and Malfoy had been antagonizing each other since the day Ron had met them both on the train to Hogwarts. And yet… Harry had cried real tears at the idea he had nearly killed him that day in the bathroom… and again when he told him how Malfoy had lowered his wand that night on the Astronomy Tower.
“Hey… Draco…” He says his name like an experiment… one that turns out rather well, apparently. “Draco, it’s going to be all right.” His words are soft… warm. “It’s not for much longer. That’s why I came; your trial’s scheduled for tomorrow.”
I’m starting to think that my messy hair is not, in fact, the fault of nature… but rather some deficiency on the part of my hair management skills.
“I’ve wanted this…,” Draco whispers the words into Harry’s mouth, softer than Harry can possibly hear them. “For so long. Longer, I think, than I ever even knew what
“Are they all right?” Victoire asks, her voice trembling a bit. A fair bit of her previous poise seems to have abandoned her.
Hermione kisses his cheek. Hugo, holding his mother’s hand, regards him solemnly. Rose is all bounce and giggles; generally if Hugo wants something said, he simply waits until his sister says it.
Charlie’s little cabin is at the edge of a wide valley, surrounded by tree-covered mountains and in the middle of the dragon preserve. It’s a two-day walk from anywhere. A shallow creek, slow and sandy, wanders through the valley.
I’m not sure if he dropped his hand, or if I flinched away from his touch. There is space between us now, and when I meet his eyes, he looks wary. He might be blushing a little.
“All right, Mr. Potter, as far as I can tell, you’re perfectly healthy. All your swabs came back normal… though, of course, I’ll be sending everything out for further testing, but I don’t really expect the results will give me any cause for concern.
With an unhurried slip of tongue and teeth, Harry releases the finger. “Then you’ll add another finger, and it might burn just a tiny little bit, but it will feel
Draco doesn’t have a mirror, but he knows he has worn countless faces. Countless, because he refuses to count them.
… alive in the moment. He isn’t looking ahead to a future filled with pain and fear and death, no remembered screams haunt him from the past. He feels only Charlie’s fingers cupping his head, his thumb gentle on his cheek, his tongue sweeping into his mouth bringing with it the sweet taste of stewed meat and sage and nutmeg.
“So,” Harry asks, his voice artificially bright, “do you think you will play Quidditch? Professionally, I mean.”
Once he became a child and Draco prayed to any god who would listen that he was adequate… that the child whose body he wore was—and would remain—untouched. Because Draco could handle what a child could not.
helping someone. Maybe even in a way no one else could.” He thrusts the market bag at her. “I don’t like oranges.”
Draco is thirteen… shouting at Potter, wanting desperately to hex him. He takes a deep breath… and another… and he’s twenty-eight again and Potter didn’t ask for this.
“Mmmm…” Harry is doing something indescribable with his tongue. “Then take your pants off. It’s my turn to be selfish.”
“Harry… the things they’ll say… They’ll say that I’ve imperiused you… or that I’m blackmailing you somehow… that you would never be with… with someone like me unless you were forced… or confounded. They’ll say that I’m lying to you… using you to keep out of Azkaban…” Draco can hear his voice shaking.
Draco kisses him, long and loving, his tongue sliding slowly against Harry’s, his hand, tender now, in his hair. “You know I will,” he whispers. “Always.”
He looks up, his eyes still replaying the nightmare that woke him as the firelight shadows dance across his face. He doesn’t say anything. Maybe he can’t.
The next day he stands in the doorway for a good five minutes before finally stepping out into the sunshine. The air is chill, but the sun is warm on his face, its light yellow. The weeds that are hindering the growth of the daffodils never stood a chance.
Harry was still holding him tightly when Draco felt a tremor move through Harry. “Are you okay?” he asked.
Potter let out an odd little snort and Draco thought of all the times, especially in the last year, when he had felt Potter’s eyes on him. He thought of all the times he was almost
know how to take care of Teddy… how different can it be, really? Quite a lot, actually, I think. “I have Teddy sometimes. In fact, I thought you could sleep in his room.”
In some, twisted, way Draco cannot help but feel that he should be grateful to the Reparations Company, Incorporated… because, realistically, the post-Voldemort world has no place for him—a second-best seeker and unwilling Death Eater with a flair for Arithmancy and conversational French. With his father in Azkaban, the Manor and all the money gone, and his mother…
As soon as they got back to Harry’s flat, Draco cast the diagnostic spell. He had barely said the incantation when the spell flared a bright, glowing pink. Pink for pregnant.
“Harry! Harry! Look at me!” Draco captures Harry’s face with urgent hands. “Look at me, love. We’ll figure it out, okay? We’ll figure it out.” He wipes Harry’s tears. “It’ll be okay. I promise.”
Draco snorts. “Okay. And I appreciate it—I do. But now tell me the real reason. The reason it was the Order of Merlin money. One hundred thousand galleons is way more money than necessary… if you were only trying to give me a safety net.”
The boy relaxed again, and Severus was glad he had not followed his last—quite inappropriate—train of thought.
that was always there, a treasure trove of imagined delights being saved for when they were just a little older… just a little more ready… It turns his stomach now—as surely as it would turn Blaise’s.
“I just want you to take me to that hospital in France, where no one knows who I am, so I can just get rid of it. I don’t want this!”
“You didn’t lie to me,” Harry says at last, his lips still against Draco’s. “You’ve never lied to me. I didn’t… I didn’t ask the right question.”
when it came to Occlumency. Where Severus had shields and false memories to keep an intruder at bay, Narcissa’s memories, real or unreal, floated to the surface like silk in a breeze, one liquid memory after another, so that it was impossible to hold onto any specific memory long enough to scrutinize it.
“I’m glad... I’m glad you were here tonight.” Potter turns slightly, towards Draco, brushing his thumb, lightly, over his wrist. “I just wanted to say… I didn’t expect… this is going to sound so stupid… but just staying in and watching that film… with you… this was the nicest evening I’ve had… in a really long time.”
world isn’t really like your uncle’s world. Not really. We go out together all the time… to the cinema, that restaurant. We hold hands and one cares.”
in the darkness, but he could see a small mat with what looked like a blanket folded on it pressed against one wall. Next to it stood a small pitcher of what Draco could only hope was water. His mouth felt dry as sand and his throat was raw.
. Harry hadn’t even told Hermione and Ron yet—at the thought of their faces, he felt a sudden plummeting in his gut, like being dropped from an elevator shaft.
He realized he was still holding Malfoy’s wrist. Malfoy felt warm and solid in his grasp. His gaze, ever mercurial, burned into Harry’s own.
"Skeeter then just goes on to insult Kingsley for the rest of it," said Hermione, folding the paper. "But it's interesting, isn't it?"
Malfoy crashed into the desk behind him, toppling over it and landing solidly on the ground with a heavy grunt. His wand flew cleanly into Harry’s left hand.
The potion they were brewing today was difficult: in class, Harry had been left with a cauldron full of charcoal and the odour of burning plastic. So, it was with extra care that he worked now, attentive to the board and his textbook. But the entire time, uneasiness played in his stomach. He was on guard for Malfoy to do
The flames caught up with them. They illuminated the vast lake—and Harry saw, just below him, the golden snitch.
Narcissa Malfoy lay swallowed by her bed, a vast sea of gold and Prussian blue. Her white-blond hair fanned on the pillow, framing her head like a cloud.
Harry ignored this. “Well, you’re not hopeless, Malfoy,” he said critically. “A little slow with your retaliations maybe, and you get flustered easily.”
Malfoy smirked. He put down his quill. "What's this, Potter?” he said slowly. “A love note from Weasley, perhaps…?"
He shoved his wand into his pocket and strode around the corner. Filch scooped up Mrs. Norris and hobbled after him, wheezing and croaking threats.
. I think I heard Boughbranch talking to someone—some bloke, a professor I think—about turning you in to McGonagall.”
Harry considered Malfoy, deeply intent on his homework, nothing but a silky blond head and hunched shoulders.
But, of course, they both were never much for rules. Malfoy, in particular, seemed to have a certain disregard for them.
Harry glanced pointedly at the book cast to Malfoy’s side. It looked ancient; stains marred its cover, and moths had eaten away at its spine so thoroughly that cotton threads poked out at all angles.
“Don’t pretend you don’t know Ginny’s name,” said Harry, “and Malfoy—I think Boughbranch is onto you.”
The haze began to clear. Slowly, the figures took shape, and Harry saw a familiar woman in an unfamiliar room.
Yet again, Harry was growing irritated. It was too much to ask, apparently, that Malfoy act like a decent human being for more than a couple of hours.
But to Harry's surprise, a laugh broke across Malfoy's face. The sight was foreign without any of its signature contempt.
—” shouted Malfoy. The desk split into two. He ducked as both halves crashed against the wall right where his head had just been.
Emboldened, Harry continued, “So…she just left you behind? Isn’t that a bit, I don’t know, selfish?”
"So, Polyjuice Potion," said Harry, tapping his quill thoughtfully. Malfoy eyed it in irritation. Harry stopped. "It uses lacewings and leeches, but Wolfsbane only uses leeches?"
As time wore on, Harry sensed Malfoy growing restless. Harry’s mind, too, started to drift...but then he snapped it back into place. No way in
Sighing, Harry turned to Malfoy. He waited, raising his eyes to Malfoy's grey ones, which suddenly sparkled.
“You’re pureblood too,” countered Hermione, “and I think the Ministry would have suspected Narcissa Malfoy if she were actually guilty. I mean, they released her the same day Lucius was murdered. And the Ministry
Gryffindor had the pitch for practice. Ginny looked particularly fierce, shouting orders and whizzing around on her broom like an angry phoenix. The first match of the season against Slytherin was approaching.
"Order of Merlin, First Class..." said Malfoy quietly, grey eyes never leaving Harry's. "And all those other medals...you must be proud, Potter."
Malfoy rested his head on his hand. His gaze held Harry’s, quiet, deliberate. Then he turned back to his textbook as if nothing had happened.
"He's—a—po-et," said Malfoy slowly, enunciating each syllable. "They're a kind of a writer, Potter, only they write little chopped-up sentences."
She looked apologetic. Harry gauged the tall boy as he bumped Ritchie Coote with his shoulder, snickering.
Harry frowned. Something nagged him. That day in Charms, before he’d discovered Malfoy’s secret kneazle, a piece of parchment had fallen from Malfoy’s bag. Upon it had been an old text, which had read the words—
Malfoy seemed like he knew how ridiculous that sounded. Frustrated, he sighed and smoothed his hair. It didn’t work—it fell like silk across his brow.
Harry had liked Ginny. And when he’d kissed her, he’d felt that monster in his stomach purr, as though finally satisfied. But with Malfoy, the monster in Harry was never satisfied—it was insatiable. He tried not to think about what that meant.
The kneazle was sort of cute, thought Harry. Its fur was so black that the only features Harry could see were a small, pink tongue and two large, golden eyes.
Harry felt jittery, anxious, hot and full of steam. Yet there was nothing he could do but sit there, his head on the table, his breath humid against the smooth wood.
Parvati gave him a look of ultimate condescension. “Why else? Whoever killed Lucius Malfoy...is coming for
Malfoy ducked into Armour Gallery. No one ever went there, save for Filch and the odd student who cleaned the armoury during detention.
“Really, Potter, I have to ask how you and Weasley made it in here,” continued Malfoy as if Harry had spoken. “Granger’s help, I suppose. I wonder, are all the Weasleys this useless?”
“Well…” said Hermione slowly. “Before you Recall an object, it was Vanished for however long you intended. But Apparition is near-instantaneous, isn’t it? So, anything that will have spent enough time in this ‘void’ to experience it either has no consciousness, or it can’t tell us what it experienced, because it isn’t human.”
Harry wondered what would happen once his flimsy lies stopped working. The situation felt tenuous; at any moment, it could all come crashing down.
The kneazle paused in front of the locked door. Over its shoulder, it shot Harry a look that was unmistakably plaintive.
Harry headed for the storeroom. Cod liver oil was nowhere in sight. The idea of asking Boughbranch (or worse, Malfoy) repelled him, so he just grabbed plain old fish oil and hoped for the best.
Boughbranch eyed Harry. He hoped his expression didn't reveal that the assignment had completely slipped from his mind.
"What's happening with Harry?" came Hermione's voice. She had finally lifted her nose from the parchment.
“Aw, Potter, you worried for me? That’s endearing,” said Malfoy. “Anyway, one look at Roman and you’d know that man doesn’t owe anything to the Ministry. Besides, he’s...an acquaintance.”
"Don't smoke or do, I don't care," responded Malfoy indifferently. "Just don't be prat for once in your life, and keep it to yourself."
“All I’m saying,” Ron interrupted, “is that we don’t know anything for sure about that family. And that besides the Ministry, the only people who saw Lucius Malfoy’s dead body—are Narcissa and Draco Malfoy.”
"Wrackspurts," replied Luna seriously. "We've got an infestation at Hogwarts. I’m afraid the situation is quite grave."
“I mean…” said Malfoy. He looked contemplative. “It’s about how much men are responsible for their own actions.”
It disturbed Harry to see Malfoy so flippant about his father's death, even if his father had been a heinous Death Eater. Harry thought of Mrs. Weasley, of her warm brown eyes, and of her apron, which always smelled like cinnamon. He thought about Sirius's laugh, Ron's smirk, and Hermione's anxious brow.
“Maybe,” said Harry. He looked sidelong at Malfoy. “But would you be having this conversation with me two years ago?”
Remedial Potions took place again on Wednesday night. Although Malfoy was in Harry's other N.E.W.T. classes, Harry rarely paid much attention to him. Malfoy was usually content to sit at the back of the classroom, sullen and superior.
He shook his sleeve back over the Mark and glared at Harry. Malfoy seemed uncomfortable under the scrutiny. But he was defiant all the same.
Harry grimaced slightly. “That day…of the battle. When I went to meet Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest—” Malfoy flinched, but Harry hardly noticed; his heart was racing. “—I was alive, but she told him I was dead. After I’d told her that you were okay. If she hadn’t—I don’t think I’d be standing here right now.”
“Save it,” said Malfoy. He glanced up at Harry, whose heart froze. Malfoy’s eyes were wet silver. “Get my bag.”
In the dungeons where they’d gotten high, and Harry had rolled Malfoy’s sleeve back; in the dungeons when they’d dueled, when they’d
In fact, Harry was so preoccupied, he’d completely forgotten about his meeting with Professor McGonagall until Hermione brought it up during lunch.
Harry hadn’t realized it at first, as the voice Roman had used that night had been so different—low and urgent, not at all like his composed, calculating tone in class. Still, even at the time, Harry had thought that the voice was familiar; that was why he’d told Malfoy it belonged to male professor, and that Boughbranch was aiming to turn Malfoy into McGonagall for stealing hellebore from her stores. As hellebore was a controlled substance, that would certainly lead Malfoy to expulsion—maybe even probation violation. And that meant Azkaban.
chose what he thought was the winning side. That’s what people with half a brain do. He played his cards wrong is all, and he paid for it. You want me to apologize, Potter? To beg for your forgiveness?
Covertly, Harry glanced over his shoulder at Malfoy’s potion. He didn’t want to come back here any more than Malfoy did.
The milk in Harry’s cereal shot up his nose. When he finally emerged, spluttering violently, he saw Hermione’s contemptuous look.
Feverishly, he imagined a steel wall sealing his memories; he tried to suppress one thought in particular, but the more he tried, the clearer it became…
It was a strange feeling, making Malfoy nearly laugh. Harry wrapped his stinging thumb in a cotton scrap.
The snitch’s wings beat uselessly against his clenched palm. Below him, he heard a loud curse. He looked down at Malfoy, indignant and severely windblown.
"She's my best friend, watch what you say," snapped Malfoy. "Anyway, use your fucking head. Do you really think I'd be asking you if I had any other option?"
Uneasiness consumed him. In class, he found himself glancing at the door with alarming frequency. In the hallways, he’d turn, wary of a tall, pale-haired figure (Zacharias Smith shot him a perplexed look when Harry jumped at the sight of him).
A gust of hot breath, like a laugh, grazed the shell of his ear. Darkly, Malfoy chuckled. He trailed kisses, open-mouthed, down Harry’s throat. In the deafening quiet of the cramped storage closet, broken by Harry’s harsh breaths, the wet
"Bye-bye," said Luna absently, carefully tucking the seeds into the soil as if putting a child to bed.
Wanting nothing more than to Vanish the note (and yet itching to read it), Harry unfolded the parchment. In handwriting he was getting to know far too well, it said:
Harry pinched his cheeks red, letting the pain warm him. He exchanged a look with Ron, who rolled his eyes and frowned at the chessboard between them.
Malfoy appraised him. After a pause, he said, "Who knows. Something that won't make my dear father curse me from his grave. Or, seeing as he's already rotting…"
From his left heel spread an itching, burning, prickling sensation that began to worm rapidly through him. First his left leg, then his right, his torso, his arms, fingers,
Of course, he'd never say it, but the real reason Harry hadn't seen much of Hagrid was that Hagrid always wanted to
Harry watched the kneazle curl its strange tail around the suit of armour's ankle. "Depends,” he said airily, “on what that hellebore is for.”
Malfoy passed the pipe to Harry. The embers stayed magically lit, sparks dancing within their glass prison. The moment seemed surreal, like an unusually vivid dream Harry would have during an afternoon nap.
*In this story, 7th years have classes alongside 8th years, since both years are taking the same N.E.W.T. coursework.
Malfoy’s ears were ever-so-slightly pink. But when he spoke, it was without a trace of embarrassment.
With the start of December came the castle’s Christmas cheer. Hagrid lugged gigantic trees, magically magnified, through the corridors; Professor Flitwick carried piles of wreaths and baubles so tall he was often mistaken for a small tree himself; and even Professor McGonagall was spotted humming carols while shooting wads of gum into Peeves's throat, silencing his cackling.
A pause, then giggles, then the sound of footsteps receding down the corridor. Harry heard the boy say, “…two schoolbags and only one Potter, did you notice? There must have been someone with him…”
Harry held his breath. This was the moment where Malfoy ratted him out, told Filch that he’d been with none other than Harry Potter.
A phantom blush heated Harry's face. Instead of responding, he said all at once, "Not very smart of you to put it on that tosser stationary. Really, Malfoy,
Harry had never felt proud of being better at things than his friends. Well, that wasn’t exactly true: it felt good to beat Hermione at defense, and Ron in Quidditch. But he knew they were better than him at many other things, so his pride never lasted long. But he felt definite satisfaction at Malfoy recognizing that he was better than him. At two things, in fact—Defense and Quidditch.
Smiling slightly, Malfoy said, “Well. I suppose that if I’d died, I wouldn’t be able to see your face right now.”
"You don't know that," replied Harry, somewhat testily. Luna's colorless eyes felt like a magnifying glass. "So…Parvati?"
Realizing what he’d said, Harry flushed. He felt as though he had just given too much of himself away.
The three stamped snow from their boots and squeezed into the hut’s warmth. Inside, a welcome fire was sputtering merrily. Fang lay at the hearth, his deep snores rattling the wooden walls.
"I'll be heading to the Headmistress's office, then to my chambers," she added. "Considering the library's closed, you two may stay here to work together if you'd like. Certainly, you, Potter, could use Malfoy's help...I've locked the storage cupboard."
how to do it,” retorted Malfoy, vehemently crushing cloves. “You most likely blew up your cauldron again, no surprise there, but this old bag wants me to brew what I’ve missed in class. Don’t know how this is meant to help us pass our N.E.W.T.s. It’s positively paleolithic if you ask me.”
If Harry blushed any more, he would melt, be nothing more than hot ooze. Desperately, he opened his mouth to tell Malfoy to fucking
Hermione started, seeming to realize that she'd been staring at Harry peculiarly. “Um, do you mind, Harry…?”
After a moment, he rolled his sleeve back up his left forearm. The Mark was exposed again, stark under the blue light. Harry realized it wasn’t black at all, but badly faded, mottled and ugly.
With a familiar dread, Harry poured his brownish sludge into a glass vial. It looked distinctly chunky.
Suddenly, Peeves stopped in midair. He flipped upside down, poking his head between his legs. An evil grin split his ugly face.
Rubbing his eyes, Harry looked up. Hermione was clutching a slip of parchment, Potions book splayed open on her lap.
“Yeah well, I didn’t, so shut up about it,” said Harry. “No one cares about how much you hate Muggles or how filthy you think they are either.”
The following afternoon found Harry, Hermione, and Ron near the lake, huddled around an orb of conjured blue fire.
“No,” said Hermione softly. Her eyes followed Harry’s. “Imagine finding out about your father’s death this way. The
“Right,” he said. He couldn’t help but feel a little guilty, especially when Ron had ink all over his face.
and the wizarding world’s greatest, most notorious sorcerer was vanquished,” said Malfoy. He chuckled derisively, then composed himself, remembering that he was meant to be playing nice. “Please, I’m not a
“And this?” Harry’s lips brush his, then trail his jaw to nip gently where neck and jaw meet. “And this?”
Draco shakes his head, putting on his drawing room drawl. “Really, Potter, I am tragically out of shape…”
“I suppose I have you to thank for these as well?” he said, indicating the trousers and the Slytherin sweater he was wearing. The sweater was warm and familiar and made him feel… safe somehow.
“Sir should be taking these to Miss Hermione. Miss is studying too hard… Miss is not eating enough.”
She smiles up at him. If she knows he is lying, she gives no indication. Narcissa Malfoy sits at the head of the table, looking every inch the gracious hostess… not like her husband is in Azkaban… not like her home is overrun with Death Eaters… not like she is terrified.
Draco takes a hasty sip of tea. It’s sweeter than he normally likes it, but the sugar coats the bitterness of remembered taste and pulls the fragrant Assam to the forefront. He takes another sip, slower this time. Then another.
The second time Draco sees one of his clients, he is at the market with Granger, debating with her the merits of oranges versus grapefruits as a breakfast fruit. The man is across the way, his cart piled high with the sorts of boxes and packages that are no longer allowed in the Grimmauld Place kitchen.
“You still think pretty highly of yourself, don’t you Malfoy? Well, come here. Let’s see if you’re worth it.”
… what he sees. The heat of the fire reflected in my panicked face. My hand reaching out for him. Our fingers brush, but don’t grasp. I’m falling. I can smell burning—fabric, for now. I’m still reaching for him. I’m screaming, but there is no sound.
. Your shirts come off their hangers looking like they were stuffed, damp, in a sack and forgotten about for weeks.”
Draco hissed and black spots were speckling his vision before he was done, but he managed to wash off the blood and the filth from being imprisoned for… he still didn’t know for how long. He slipped on grey slacks that had once fit him perfectly and were now threatening to slip off his hips. The touch of his shirt hurt. Ignoring this, he did up the buttons. He was somewhat surprised to find that his wand was lying on the nightstand and used it to dry his hair.
himself that he hadn’t known… but he had, hadn’t he? Like he hadn’t known what the Sectumsempra curse would do… but he had
He needed the support of Harry’s hand to get in, though, and was grateful to find it, strong and gentle, right where he needed it to be.
“A film?” he says, dropping down beside Potter. “That’s like a photograph, yes? But it moves without magic… and tells a story? I’ve always wanted to see one.”
Harry doesn’t sleep, but stays… watching the fire… his fingers wrapped around whatever earthenware vessel he has most recently been handed. The cabin is dark, its windows tiny, but sunlight streams in when Charlie opens the door.
He picks up another, smaller box, presses a button, and the screen on the wall jumps to life. “Sorry, do you… not drink?”
With Ron and Hermione right behind him, he reached the hall just in time to see the spectral Albus Dumbledore sweep down on what appeared to be a pile of rags that had landed in the front hall.
“Not to panic, dear, but a trans boy… anyone with a uterus… can get pregnant if they’re not careful.”
be shocked to see him there… with Harry. And he can’t quite believe that they do not know where he has been for the past three years… but they never say a word. They are polite, friendly even, and Draco is grateful.
Ron had been raised on the idea that there was no such thing as a reformed Death Eater, as a noble Slytherin…. But Ron had also heard Kreacher’s tale… how Regulus Black had drunk that potion and died a truly horrific death… alone in a cave… on the
Had they been waiting for him to leave the drawing room alone and slightly sickened by the antics of the Dark Lord? Had the attack been motivated by lust… or retaliation? Draco can’t recall anyone he has, personally, slighted but there are a great many people angry with Lucius Malfoy at the moment.
Draco was trembling, and Harry caught his arm. “He won’t do that again,” he said, almost harshly. “I won’t let him.”
Molly Weasley wanted him to move into the Burrow. Ginny Weasley wanted them both to move into Grimmauld Place, and she started picking out curtains and wallpaper and hinting about wedding dresses and nursery furniture. Percy Weasley had a mile-long list of projects he wanted Harry to consult on.
Draco doesn’t move or turn his head, but he knows Harry is watching. He feels the tingle of magic and the dry dog biscuits become something squishier and smellier and probably a lot more enticing to a hungry dog.
It’s almost as if we haven’t spent our entire school careers hexing each other. It’s almost as if I don’t have the Dark Mark, black on my arm.
Harry’s hands stop sliding over Draco’s perfect body… the body that was his when he was playing Quidditch almost every day, the body that had enough to eat, the body that didn’t have a scar slicing across his heart. The body that Harry remembers making love to.
Potter takes the bottle from Draco, pours the wine, and, his eyes intense and oddly bright, hands Draco a glass. “To your first film, then,” he says, bringing his own glass to chime gently against Draco’s.
“I… was wondering… if you’d… like to come over for dinner again. Tonight? I really wanted to cook for you…”
O’Brien laughs. “History’s all about the teacher, that’s for sure. My teachers at school were pretty awful too. It’s part of why I studied nursing! Anyway, like I said, it could be stress, but my money’s on a virus. You know the drill, Malfoy. Take him home, put him to bed. Lots of chicken soup, tea, and rest.” She
Harry inhaled deeply and said, in a voice that was very nearly matter-of-fact, “A few drops of dittany in the bath, do you think?”
Draco Malfoy was cleared of all charges, and Harry, personally, returned his wand and shook his hand as flashbulbs went off around them.
Draco slips a finger down the waistband of Harry’s pajamas, and brings it back out, glistening with milky fluid. He tastes it and it is musky and bitter and brilliant.
Harry is cupping his head, running his thumb gently across Draco’s cheek. He has no way of knowing that he is pressing on a very nasty bruise. Draco isn’t entirely sure that the bone is not cracked; he knows some of his ribs are.
Every time he drank, the pitcher refilled itself. Perhaps he hadn’t been left here to die. Draco put his head back down.
“Oh, Harry, you don’t,” she says, her voice and expression softening as she puts her arms around him. “You need your own space, just like we need ours.”
. He wasn’t looking for clues, or doing anything constructive really, but rather searching for memories, however slight, of his mother reading these stories to him. He had gathered that she was almost as much of a bookworm as Hermione; surely she would have read to him, even if he had been too small to understand.
“It’s all right, Victoire,” Draco says, his voice soft. He’s knelt in front of her. “Harry’s here to take you home. Your mother had to go, quite urgently, to France to see your grandparents.”
Draco picks up his coffee. “You’re leaving because of me, aren’t you?” he says quietly. He’s overheard him arguing with Harry about it. “Because Harry’s right—there’s lots of room… you don’t have to…”
children died at the hands of Death Eaters… while the children of the Death Eaters still walked free…
The sign on the front gates is the only thing that can truly be said to be finished. It’s purple and reads
Harry runs his hands down Draco’s back; Harry is feeling the lithe muscles of Draco’s former self, when in reality the muscles have been replaced with prominent ribs and a few new scars. It still feels good. Harry’s hands grip him by the hips and pull.
Almost hesitantly, as if he isn’t sure it’s real, isn’t sure he can really touch it, he picks it up. Magic thrums through him.
Thank you for reading! As always kudos, comments, and constructive criticism are very welcome and greatly appreciated! ~Blessings
Draco opens the note again, sprinkles a little silver-gold glitter into it, and refolds the parchment. The owl watches him, carefully, with wide amber eyes.
Most days Harry gets through work… and grabs some takeaway from the Indian place near his flat. He’s finding that when he’s not nauseated he’s starving… lamb vindaloo… chicken madras… the hotter the better… which doesn’t make any sense at all, but he’s
Hugo disengages himself from his mother and ducks behind the counter. Draco knows that if he looks, he will see him sitting down with Lisbeth’s head in his lap. They are the very best of friends.
“Don’t be. Please. It’s okay. Don’t be sorry. We’ve got time, Draco. We’ve got all the time in the world.”
of the things I did. I should have known that St. Mungo’s wouldn’t have anything to do with me.” He says it carefully, as if the words—or worse the person saying them—might shatter. “I thought about joining Mother… trying to see if L’Hopital des Anges would take me… But
“My mother used that spell…,” Harry said, sounding awed. “I remember… when I was little and I cried, she used that spell… I thought I couldn’t remember her at all… but I do.”
At some point Draco finds himself tucked up under Potter’s arm. At some point their fingers become intertwined.
They sit in the corner and eat and laugh and drink coffee. Draco does share his chocolate cake with Harry. Of course.
One of the things he’s noticed is that Malfoy’s eyes change color… dark to light to dark again… Harry’s not sure how or why. They’re dark now, like a black you can see through.
Draco didn’t respond. He just pressed his face further into the bed and held on. He tried to remember to breathe.
“True,” Granger agrees. “But they don’t owe her a ridiculous sum of money. They have set hours, access to healing potions, even the ability to refuse clients. And they can talk. Not to their clients, apparently, but to each other. And me.”
“It’s not supposed to hurt, Harry.” Softly. Gently. “It’s supposed to feel good… Maybe we should just…”
The moment stretches… until finally Malfoy speaks, softly, almost unwillingly. “I don’t… I don’t let people fuck me. I’ll suck someone off if I have to. But I don’t… fuck.”

In the daylight, his eyes are lighter, with flecks of blue and even lavender in them. I want to say something. To apologize… explain.
With a final, vicious thrust, Macnair grunted out his release. “I used to dream of making you scream and beg,” he said, the words rasping against Draco’s neck, “But this… this might be even better.”
Draco can’t read Harry’s expression: on the one hand, the heated look he is giving Draco is making his own blood warm and his cock perk up expectantly, but on the other… Harry looks as if he fears Draco is going to start shouting and cursing things at any moment.
“I can’t refuse a client… I can’t displease a client. If you turn me away… it doesn’t matter why, really. They’ll punish me.” Draco’s voice is small.
“How the mighty have fallen,” Potter says as he toes over Draco’s cup. A few coins tumble out onto the pavement.
“Kreacher is not sorry. Kreacher lives to serve Harry Potter and the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black. Master Harry and Master Draco is needing each other.”
The look in McNair’s eyes as he circled him, like Draco was prey, sent ice twisting through his belly.
Relief twinned with disappointment floods him. The same emotions, he thinks, flash across Potter’s face.
Draco can feel Harry’s heart beating through their joined hands. He can feel the barest whisper of his breath, brushing against his own. It occurs to him… as slowly and as suddenly as the moment when night becomes day: Harry is not going to touch him without his permission.
I’m not going to be able to look her in the eye and tell her, “No,” no matter what it is that she wants to do.
, I know.” His head drops to his hands as a wave of remembered screams, some of them Hermione’s, wash over him. Taunts… the smell of blood… the sounds begging… the empty sound of a body hitting the floor…
Draco rings the front door bell at exactly six minutes to six. He is carrying a sack full of the warm, mouth-watering smells of Indian spices. He has a bottle of wine tucked under his arm.
He tries a curry recipe which turns out rather well, and a few pasta dishes. He thinks he will have to remember to ask Granger to find him some more cookbooks, ones with lighter dishes, ones with less meat and more spices.
Draco drags his fingers over Harry’s too-pale skin, concentrating on every tiny shiver, every moan Harry gifts him with.
the accident, but both Mother and Father are doing well. Technically, Mother has been released, but Father needs one more blood replenishing potion, so they’re keeping him overnight. Mother wouldn’t leave him, of course, so they’re both still here.”
His eyes, bright and green and pleading, look up at me. There’s not a lot of light, but I can see the teardrops glistening on his lashes.
Draco could argue with Harry about who the real hero of the Second Wizarding War was… but he doesn’t see the point; Harry will never believe him.
Often when he reaches out, Draco flinches and the hand doesn’t land. But sometimes he freezes… and he is frozen now, Finnegan’s hand resting on his shoulder, as he laughs about
He was trying to open a carton of… something… and the knife slipped, cutting his hand rather badly. Which is how he’s found himself, seated on a bench in the park around the corner from the coffee shop, his hand being cradled between Malfoy’s.
Draco’s heart is pounding, but the frantic rhythm seems to be the exact opposite of terror. “Yes?” Draco hears himself say.
Rather than disappearing, the form of Dumbledore momentarily became more solid. “I know, my dear boy. I know,” it said, before fading away like smoke.
“You don’t want people talking about you, but you also don’t want to hide the fact that your boyfriend used to be a Death Eater?”
He takes the mug Weasley hands him. Cappuccino. Perfectly brewed, perfectly bitter, perfect foam. In his favorite rainbow mug. He takes a sip. Perfect temperature. “Thank you,” he says.

want to tell you…” And then Draco says nothing. Harry’s hand is steady, but Draco can feel his own trembling.
The glass tinkles, an inappropriately cheerful sound, as it hits the floor. The wine pools on the uneven stone. Harry wants it to look like
It’s not the baby he doesn’t want… though as much as he’s decided that he strongly dislikes Healer Mitchell, Harry thinks he’s correct—he is far too young to start a family… but rather the idea that

A chill creeps up Harry’s spine. He pulls the duvet even higher. He does know that Wizards can’t catch any of the STIs that plague Muggles, so the oversight, if there was one… and he is becoming aware of some fairly convincing evidence that there
She’s smiling at him. “Now, I have something I want to say, and I do apologize if I’m speaking out of turn, but I’ve been watching you these past few weeks… and, well…  dear, is there any chance you could be pregnant?”
He feels the sharp tingle of a cleansing spell and hears Potter murmur the lubrication and preparation charms. And then—
They eat quietly, the only sounds being the occasional scrap of cutlery on stonewear, the gentle ring of a wineglass being set down. He knows Harry keeps glancing at him, Draco’s doing it too, but their eyes never meet.
He watches Potter bustle around the kitchen: putting on the kettle… using soap and a cloth, rather than his wand, to scrub out a pan and wash a few plates and forks… fumbling through the icebox in the corner of the room. He sets the pan on the stove and places sausages in it. Draco finds himself almost
“Shit, Malfoy, look at yourself. I have never seen anyone… Do you have any idea how fucking strong you are? Tenacious. Stubborn as shit, maybe. You survived a fucking war. And then that house of fucking
But Victoire is still screaming, the sausages are burning, and almost every horizontal surface in my kitchen is covered with a dirty dish or a breakfast ingredient when Draco steps through the Floo.
“We’d have to get a bunch more books, though. Kids’ books. Hermione’ll have ideas, and so will my mom. She loved to read to us… when she could get us all to sit still. Which wasn’t very often.”
In the morning, Draco waits until everyone leaves, Weasley and Hermione for work, Harry to do his magic tricks for desperately sick children, then he, quite alone, marches out the front door of Grimmauld Place.
Harry doesn’t have the right words… Instead he sits up a little, bringing his mouth to Draco’s. A kiss… another… he runs his tongue along Draco’s lower lip… “Is this okay?”
He looked at himself in the mirror, completely unimpressed with the reflection. He had always thought he had had higher cheekbones and more chin than were strictly necessary… but had also always thought that the pointiness suited him. Now he just looked gaunt. And exhausted.
He did what he was told. If he didn’t, something painful happened to him; if he did, something painful happened to him anyway.
— into a very lucrative galleon-making scheme. With a few well-placed opinion pieces in the Daily Profit, she and her cohorts (lately of the Muggleborn Registration Committee, but who’s
The household settles into a routine: Weasley and Granger go to work, Harry goes wherever he goes, Draco works in the garden, drinks those god-awful nutrition potions, and takes a lot of naps.
He is fully seated in Harry, trying to stop himself from coming right then from the heat and the tightness and the look of awe on Harry’s face.
“I was so scared,” Harry whispers. “When we heard about Theo… and I couldn’t find you… I didn’t think you had the money for your reparations payments either…. And I knew you weren’t in Azkaban. I almost couldn’t look for you, afraid that I would find you swinging in an attic somewhere…” Harry is gasping for breath, and Draco fists his hand into his hair and clenches their joined hands together so tightly it hurts.
Draco pulls Harry closer into his arms and presses a long kiss on Harry’s forehead… on Harry’s scar.
Draco bites into his toast and bits of orange-flavored bitterness spark against his tongue. Well, they have, haven’t they?
“Eloquent, as always, Potter. But, maybe you could let me in now? It’s colder than a witch’s britches out here… and I am wearing rather substantially
“Malfoy, do you want to… erm… borrow something… else… to wear? I mean that… outfit… doesn’t look like it’s… very… … warm.”
Both the Wimbourne Wasps and the Chudley Cannons invited him to play starting Seeker. The Daily Profit offered him a job at the paper. Countless people wanted to write his biography.
Charlie’s fingers are calloused, rough even, but his touch is gentle as he lifts Harry’s chin, forcing his gaze away from the fire and into aquamarine eyes.
Harry feels the collision of the past and the present like an actual earthquake and makes a small noise… that is completely swallowed up by Charlie’s mouth on his.
Draco lets himself take a deep breath and let it out slowly before raising his head. “No,” he says, unwinding himself from the blanket. “Thanks. But… I have things to do.”
“Lovely. For the moment, why don’t you come along with me, too, Victoire?” she continues. “You can help me keep track of everyone.”
He opens his eyes to the orange glow of a fading illumination charm… and the peacefully sleeping face of Draco Malfoy.
into Charlie’s touch. He presses his forehead into Charlie’s and breathes in the feeling of feeling safe and cared for… sunshine, leather, singed fabric. Nutmeg and sage.
“Good. ‘Cause I want to feel your arms wrapped tight around me, and this…” Harry raises his hips into Draco’s, “…pressed tight up against me.”
Then the three of us sit on the bed and Victoire spreads out the drawings. They are surprisingly good, and each comes with a long and convoluted story.
“You can change in my room if you like,” Potter says. “I’ll just find you something… erm… warmer… to wear.”
Draco takes a deep breath and drops Harry’s hand, taking a step away. A step towards the water. “They’re probably even right.”
. Harry marvels at how hands… how a body that is so strong… so battered… can be so gentle. And so sensitive. It can tell… from a hitch of breath, a flutter of a heartbeat, when it’s pleasing Harry… when it’s not.
laws. I think she may have entirely shredded the concept of human decency… but she didn’t break the law.”
Draco makes a small noise. He is completely unsure if it is due to Harry’s tongue hitting the particularly sensitive spot just under his jaw… or the mental image of Harry in tight leather pants that his imagination threw, almost violently, forth.
There are a lot of empty shelves… presumably once full of dark books now confiscated by the Ministry.
“I know… Shhh… I know… And I know that you think that that other man… Harry, he doesn’t know… anything. He doesn’t know…”
A bright shaft of sunlight streams in through the drawing room window and lands on one of the stylized peacocks woven into the Oriental rug. He never told anyone… but when he was very young he had named each of them: Morganna… Salazar Slytherin… Hecate… The sunbeam is illuminating Harry Potter.
Harry brings over a cup of coffee, setting it down carefully, before resting his hands on Draco’s shoulders. He squeezes, working his thumbs into the knots that have formed.
I ran into Draco Malfoy in an uninteresting little Muggle pub. It was early in the evening and he was sitting at the bar nursing—of all things—a Carlsberg.
Draco has never seen Harry come so hard. They are both coated in sticky ropes and little tears prickle the corners of Harry’s eyes. Draco’s own orgasm roars up from the soles of his feet, from the bottom of his
His words are cut short by Harry’s mouth, and Draco finds himself leaning in to a very through kiss. Harry holds him tightly, and just for a moment, Draco allows himself to relax, to melt, even, into Harry’s arms. He feels the knots in his shoulders slip away, feels the tension in his forehead release.
Draco pulls his leg out from under Harry’s… and immediately wishes he hadn’t as blood, wielding pins and needles, flows back into his leg. He stands up anyway, tugging on Harry’s arm.
At first Harry objected, concerned that Draco would catch a cold, or actually freeze. The look on Weasley’s face was priceless. “You’re a Wizard, Harry. Cast a bloody warming charm!” he said.
Elladora has a selection of beautiful people to choose from—Muggle movie stars, body builders, emaciated models—but many people bring their own.
Potter’s eyes are green lakes about to burst their banks. He blinks and two tears trickle down his cheeks.
Fortunately, Grimmauld Place’s wards extend all the way to the bottom step of the stoop, so none of the Muggles passing by on the street could witness such nonsense.
“There was an accident,” I say. “And your grandparents were injured. Your mother didn’t have any details when she left. I expect she’ll let us know.”
He’s supposed to be a surprise… a present, he thinks, but not a birthday present… so Draco knows he’s not expected. But that’s no reason to leave a person… well, a
Ignoring Ron’s warning, Harry took a cautious step closer… and the rags shifted a little, revealing themselves to be a wrinkled and rather filthy traveling cloak covering a skeletal figure… with platinum blond hair and the grey eyes Harry had been searching for.
forgotten. If he had remembered, he probably wouldn’t have arrived in the kitchen barely dressed, limping slightly, and sporting at least two obvious love bites.
He insists that they are too young to start a family… that they are impulsive… reckless… That male pregnancies are difficult… irresponsible… unnatural…
“Will you tell me about the time you, Uncle Ron and Auntie ‘Mione rode that dragon? Please? For my bedtime story?”
The rain that had been holding off all afternoon gives up… throws out a few warning drops… before beginning to fall in earnest.
“This is one of my favorites,” Potter says. “I wasn’t really allowed to watch television growing up, but my cousin did all the time. But this film,
to ask. He is told to be quiet as Healer Mitchell tut-tuts his way through the examination, without once looking Harry in the eye.
Draco’s relationship with Harry was inevitable. His relationship with Hermione is something he’s worked on. His relationship with Weasley… well he’s just going to leave it as one of the mysteries of life.
into the distance. There is the night sky, black, and Draco finds himself searching for stars he knows… even though the words warned him that the story is taking place in a galaxy far, far away, and quite some time in the past.
Blackness pressed tangibly against his eyes. He shut them. Pain and terror and anguish combined into a gritty sort of exhaustion that held him to the floor.
Draco is bolder in the theoretically public space that is the common room. He finds himself rubbing against Harry, the friction perfection. He reaches down, grasping Harry through his jeans, and Harry moans, low in his throat.
When Draco pulls back, he is crying again and shaking and not sure if he wants to keep kissing Harry… or to run away and hide forever.
When Teddy abandons him for Harry, she simply holds out her arms and pulls him close. “I’m so glad to finally meet you, darling.”
Draco Malfoy, throwing all his influence against convicting him. Kingsley was furious, but Harry was beyond caring, and, as Harry suspected, Kingsley was not willing to stand against him.
Draco put his head down on the flags. It was just too much trouble to hold it up at the moment. He wasted a few moments trying to find a way to lie that wasn’t pressing on one bruise or another… before giving it up as a bad job and just let the pressure build.
And the feel of those fingers on his back, erasing pain he didn’t even know he still carried…. Potter blinked and part of Draco wanted to just lean forward and kiss him. If those fingers could bring relief to those cuts on his back… what else could they heal?
There are roses blooming along the fence and the sounds of happy children coming from the schoolyard.
over there. I do love that book! Dear,” she says, patting Harry’s hand one more time, “you need to make an appointment with your doctor.”
“You remembered,” I say. And suddenly I want Draco’s hand back on my shoulder more than I want to take my next breath.
It fits comfortably in the palm of his hand, slightly fuzzy, and warm. Incongruously warm; it might be the only warm thing in the whole prison. And it’s like holding his own little bit of sunshine.
Harry doesn’t do things in half-measures and he doesn’t now… and he kisses and caresses and strokes his way
Harry feels the corners of his mouth turn up a little, imagining a young Draco, still pointy, but soft-eyed in the way that Hermione gets when she's researching, pouring through the ancestries in the Manor library... looking for information about his personal star-crossed lovers.
The illumination charm has faded; he can’t see Harry’s face any more than Harry can see his. It’s a promise whispered into the darkness.
Draco only really laughs when he’s with Harry. But he smiles; it is almost like a laugh… but quieter.
to you? I mean… you must have done accidental magic sometimes, and that was probably kind of scary for someone who had never seen anything… And I just want to know if they treated you… I don’t know…” Draco finds himself speaking very quickly, his words starting to tumble over one another. He takes a deep breath. “I just want to know… if they were kind…”
“Well, don’t work too hard, dear,” the woman says, taking her coffee and giving him an encouraging smile.
Clothes slide away as Draco’s fingers and lips brush every inch of Harry… every muscle, every scar. Some of his scars are new.
to survive… ever again… To anyone. Least of all me.” Harry pauses a moment before going on. “If you wanted you could leave here and still work for Mr. Ainsworth. You could go to be with your mother in France. You… if you don’t want to stay here… if you don’t want to stay with me… you have enough money to go… wherever you want.”
at his job. It would seem that the skills he honed as a child—to observe and then exploit his classmates’ weaknesses, the skills that made him such a loathed schoolyard bully, translate rather spectacularly into the ability to assess and then grant his clients’ desires… often before they are even aware of them themselves.
They’re new, purchased especially for tonight. He shouldn’t have… they were hideously expensive, but just
all right. I stay very still and listen… but the only sounds I can hear are proper nighttime noises—the soft rustle of the house elves moving about the Castle, cleaning and setting things to right; the rickety sound of the wind moving through the trees in the Forbidden Forest; the grunting snores from Longbottom in the room next door.
By the time Harry returns, Draco has made a credible attempt at eating his soup. It’s thick and golden, and with Weasley lounging against the doorframe, Draco can bring the spoon to his mouth without spilling any.
He kisses the tender skin, nuzzling gently, moving softly, tenderly, down Draco’s arm… trailing kisses… to his wrist. He places one final kiss on the palm of his hand.
didn’t kill Regulus,” Granger said kindly. “Regulus found out that You-Know-Who had done something terrible… really, really horrible, actually, and he died trying to set it right again.”
“All right. Thank you. I’ll stay here then, help Gabrielle get Mother and Father settled tomorrow, and be home in the early afternoon.”
He gestures wildly, and Draco wonders how a movement so violent could also look so heartbreakingly helpless.
The woman, whose expression suddenly reminds Harry of an unsettling combination of Professor McGonagall and Molly Weasley, shifts her gaze to Draco.
It’s an uncomplicated dinner—just chicken, roast potatoes, mushy peas… and an apple crumble with real whipped cream.
. But if you’re with me… they’ll say the Hero of the Wizarding World shouldn’t be with a Death Eater.”
He feels tears prickling the corners of his eyes before his conscious mind recognizes the song. The first time he heard it, he cried too… trying to keep his back to the coffee shop, trying to hide the hot tears trickling down his cheeks, tears he didn’t quite understand, from Adelle and the coffee shop patrons.
The rug in the library, once a grand Persian rug, is now worn and moth-eaten in places and Draco runs his finger over the rough threads.
Draco is trembling with the effort of staying still, of not pressing further into Harry before he is ready, of only moving his hand, tracing the contours of Harry’s face. His thumb passes over Harry’s lips, and he thinks Harry kisses it.
Weasley’s right; it isn’t far. It’s actually closer than the market… but turning the corner off the street he’s accustomed to… is difficult—an observation Draco keeps to himself.
. Everything about this evening has just felt right. I was missing something before and didn’t even know it.
Sometimes he tells himself that it’s because he loves his job—and he does!—but really it’s because he wants to be seen as someone other than

“I… know… This one needed to be arrested, though.” Weasley’s voice holds an agony that causes Draco to open his eyes. “He didn’t always pay for it, Malfoy. There were a couple of rentboys, Muggles, one of them died… you know Muggles aren’t as strong as we are. And there was this model—he’s only seventeen fucking years old—with
Draco is struck by the sudden urge to defend him. “His wife died. She was a half-blood… and got some type of cancer. Usually magic destroys cancer, but sometimes it just feeds it. She was tired one day and went to take a nap. The next day she couldn’t get out of bed. She died three weeks later. There wasn’t anything anyone could do. He came to say goodbye.”
The kitchen is immaculate. But more than that, the kitchen is in the process of making a very elaborate breakfast. A plate, piled high with cinnamon rolls, sits in the middle of the kitchen table beside a huge bowl of fruit. Sausages are frying themselves by the stove. Even as Ron watches, eggs are marching out of their carton, cracking themselves, and falling gracefully into a bowl.
“I’m lying,” he admits. “They won’t judge you for your ironing charms, Harry… they’ll judge you for… for
The fingers tasted disgustingly—and enticingly—of pickled herring and Draco was appalled to find that they reminded him of how very hungry he was.
Draco nods his thanks. “All right,” he says to Weasley. “Let’s get to it, then. Fiction, obviously. Something romantic, I think.”
might have been. He is pain and fear… like a monster under the bed… or an illness. He isn’t a person that’s dead or in Azkaban… or even someone who’s still walking free. He doesn’t have a face… or a name. Draco isn’t sure he wants him to.
“It’s three o’clock in the morning. Andy wouldn’t thank me for that.” There’s a slight sardonic edge to his voice. I think, maybe, his nightmares are releasing him. Slowly.
“It’ll be easy to warm back up, Malfoy, if you get hungry later.” she said. “It’s pretty good cold, too.”
The kiss is demanding. Almost violent. Harry is both giving something and taking something away… like waves on a beach; old things are swept away, new things are left behind… leaving the beach
Thank you for taking this journey through Draco's recovery with me. I have been reading, and very much enjoying, all your comments. Thank you so much!
Draco picks up Harry’s hand and interlaces their fingers. “You don’t have to do this alone. Whatever
Draco’s fingers abandon Harry’s nipple and trace lower, unbuttoning Harry’s jeans, slipping his hand inside.
The screams changed to sobs… great wracking sobs, and Draco found himself clinging to those arms like a lifeline. The arms wrapped around him, holding him tight.
Severus smiled. “I’d wondered about that,” he said. The boys were together now… just as Dumbledore had hoped.
Sometimes he pulls me onto the back of his broomstick. He reaches back, holding me close. I can smell him—he smells like sunshine and wood shavings—even above the smells of the fire.
He still refuses to count the number of clients Elladora sends him, but he is sure she is sending him more. And they are almost never gentle.
“Someday it will be a witch or a wizard… or a Muggle-born child… and then it would be different. Even if they
The Death Eater’s hand was disarmingly gentle as it passed over his collarbone, up his neck, and along his jaw. Suddenly, and without warning, Draco found a pair of fingers thrust roughly into his mouth.

. They love me! Maybe they were a little…unnerved… sometimes, but…” She stops a moment, really looking at him. “What’s this about, Draco?”
Draco thinks that speeding along country roads, holding tightly to Harry’s waist, is better than flying. Better than anything, really.
at Draco. “Mr. Potter, I’ll phone you if those test results tell me anything new. If you’re not feeling better in a week, come back in. All right?”
It’s unreasonable; he’s walked down the hall where he was attacked dozens of times. Since. Maybe even a hundred.

“Sleep well, Victoire,” Draco says, making sure the covers are pulled up tight. Fondly, he brushes back her hair.
“Your mother’s been to visit a few times. I’ve owled her and she should be arriving soon. Then we’ll all have tea.”
He watches him a long time, maybe falls asleep again, and then sees eyes, the swirling grey of the fog at sea, blinking slowly at him.
ago. He’s been home to sleep, which isn’t quite the right word for it, and to shower and to eat a bit.
“He enjoyed being a Death Eater too much,” Draco says sadly; Vince would have ended up there, too, had he lived. “But the others…”
owl… but even though he doesn’t have to, and even though he’s ancient, he is still willing to carry Draco’s mail.
Draco doesn’t know his attacker, and it is possible—unlikely, but possible—that his attacker doesn’t know his victim.
Draco’s eyes are dark, and they meet mine with a smile that looks lost and hungry and peaceful all at once.
“Did you sleep well?” she asks, that same ripple now skipping through her voice. She turns back to the pancakes, but he thinks he catches a glimpse of more-rosy-than-usual cheeks.
Malfoy snaps down the lid of his travel mug. “I know,” he says, giving Harry a tired smile. “Thanks.”
The form is uncomplicated. I write down the address on my Muggle driving license, which Professor Hastings peers at. Then he peeks up at Draco, who is still standing beside me, and gives a bit of a smile.
Draco leans over him, relacing their fingers, his other hand running over the other boy’s brow, jawline… searching his eyes. “I love you,” he whispers, before dropping his mouth to Harry’s. He kisses him… probing… sucking… caressing… making Harry moan… before moving down his jaw… his neck… Draco trails kisses and tiny nips across his chest, down his ribs, and Harry lies there, shivering a little and whimpering and arching into Draco’s touch.
Draco is concentrating on not vomiting on the floor… something at which he is succeeding… only because he has literally
“I think he had kind of a rough day. He was worried about you…” Weasley is frowning. “I’m going to guess that you weren’t just in bed with a nasty cold, right?”
Harry pokes around in the cupboards for a few moments… before deciding he’s not really hungry. He has a glass of water instead. He lies down on the couch… but decides that he’s not sleepy. He wanders around the room for a few moments, picking things up and putting them down—not really tidying anything—before lifting the lid to the piano and picking out, one handed and with mistakes, the notes to
More dancing. The man held him close. “Let me take you home,” he whispered, his almost-beard rough against his ear.
The cottage isn’t occupied yet, or even truly habitable, but it is already hosting a near constant stream of visitors. They
Draco shrugs. “That wouldn’t be right. I made a contract. They made a contract. Everyone knew what they were getting, what they were giving.”
“Transfigure the chair to make it sort of a recliner, Harry,” Weasley suggests, his voice low. “And leave the curtains open.”
“Maybe not here.” Harry’s lips are soft on his. “Or here…” Harry nibbles down his neck and Draco moans, tilting his head a little, until Harry’s mouth finds the perfect spot.
“Yes, sir,” Draco answers. “Bill Weasley was there a few years before us. We were year mates with his brother, Ron.”
permission from all his potential partners will last quite a while—the compulsion to have a strong preference for sheep, probably not as long. The interim should be amusing though… or, maybe the man will just wait it out, sheep not being exactly plentiful in London.
Charlie leads the way along the creek and up into the mountains, the trees are beautiful, all dressed up for fall. Harry simply follows, the dry leaves rustling under his feet, the sun warm where it brushes his face.
If Jamaica somehow manages it, though... Blaise will be thrilled; he has a special place in his heart for the country his mother still calls home.
“I asked Kreacher to sort out of some of Regulus’s old things for you. I thought they might be more comfortable for you than….”
Suddenly Harry is beside him, holding him tightly. “Just breathe, Draco,” Harry says, sounding far away. “I’ve got you. I just need you to breathe.”
"I know." Gently Draco twists his hand free and brings it up to cup Harry’s cheek. “I love you, Harry.”
It was his grandfather’s, the pieces carved from moonstone and jade. “That’s where my grandfather taught me to play.”
From what Draco gathered, the man from last night had discovered his wife was cheating on him. He wanted to exact revenge on her and found Draco, wearing his soon-to-be ex-wife’s body, to be a reasonable substitute. Draco’s throat is raw from screaming and, though the vagina the man tore into doesn’t even
Harry is dreaming… about the coffee shop. About Draco Malfoy. About Adelle and her perfume which is sharp and cloying and circling around his head like something out of the cartoons he used to watch, peering over Dudley’s shoulder, pretending to be cleaning, when he was young.
Draco was safe… and in the one place the Dark Lord couldn’t reach him. And the Dark Lord was blaming Macnair for Draco’s disappearance….
Draco feels a wave of grief at the mention of his former Head of House. How he respected—maybe even loved—that man! He remembers how hard Severus had worked to protect him. Draco’s life would have been very,
“Even so,” he says, still scrambling to compose himself. “No one should grow up feeling unloved. My parents had a list of faults a mile long… but they loved me.”
“I don’t know if I should…” I’m looking up the stairs, as if I can see Victoire’s door from here. “I don’t want to be…
Harry is clad only in boxers and a shirt that is so ragged and so threadbare that it can scarcely be called a shirt. “Am I?”
This new Malfoy seems to always be on the verge of exhaustion, running off some sort of inner strength made up of a quiet tenacity, sedate optimism, and an awful lot of coffee.
. The trousers and vest need attention.  And the shirt has rows of tiny buttons, pleats that are damn near ruffles, and, the fiddliest collar he’s ever seen. Merlin only knows how long it will take him to iron it properly…
“Your boss… she is your boss, isn’t she? … just told you to take me home and put me to bed.” Looking coy isn’t really Harry’s strong suit, but he gives it a go.
“No, it’s not wrong,” Draco says softly. And then just holds him… letting him cry, letting him scream, even letting him stretch the jumper out, probably beyond hope of repair.
…and he thought of his life’s blood seeping onto the floor, feeling himself growing cold… and feeling that Harry Potter had, actually, saved his life.
Potter’s asked a question… and now he’s watching… waiting. For Draco’s answer. He’s wondering if he will feel the brush of Draco’s lips on his own.
Nothing like the hesitant, questioning kiss it was before… but the furthest thing from demanding. Potter’s mouth is giving and giving and
The boy just pressed his forehead against the headstone, tears running down his cheeks, blood running down his back and didn’t scream.
out loud. For almost three years his only conversant was himself… he hadn’t bothered to censor his thoughts, they were one of the few things he actually owned after all; and, of course, he hadn’t had the ability to put them into audible words.
It had taken months, with Draco flooing over every night at Rose’s bedtime. They had started slowly… with Rose only reading a word here and there. By the end of the book she was reading pages at a time.
There are three separate slashes carved into him… by Harry. The top one, a little above his heart, is the shortest. The middle one is the deepest, a wide –pink-and-silver scar, raised and hard, crossing below his heart. The bottom one is the longest—it sliced through the unprotected flesh from just below his ribs to the opposite hip. That was one that came closest to killing him, opening his stomach, nearly spilling his intestines onto the bathroom floor.
Draco also has a penchant for shirts with fiddly collars and cuffs and will not even entertain the notion of going anywhere looking like anything less than perfection.
Victoire pronounces Teddy’s room acceptable and unpacks the bag Fleur sent over—laying out a new blouse and tights for tomorrow. And setting her pink stuffed dragon, Claire, on the pillow.
He places another bit of squishy, smelly meat into his hand. A moment later she is back, taking the treat before retreating… not all the way back to the wall this time.
Harry feels like this is something that should bother him, but usually he just curls up on the couch with a knitted blanket that clashes with everything. Even itself. Molly made it for him… Ron delivered it to him… at the coffee shop. Harry knows it’s killing them, but Ron and Hermione have been very respectful of the space Harry still, so desperately, needs.
Then he sits down, reverently pressing his fingers to the worn keys… and notes begin to float out of the piano in little skips and starts and gentle cords. Harry watches as Malfoy’s hands dance up and down the piano.
Severus frowned. “I’m afraid not. In his infinite wisdom, the Dark Lord feels that you are benefitting immensely from your current situation. To be blunt, he told me that as soon as term starts I can fuck you ten times a day if I like, but until then, your arse belongs to Macnair.”
Harry’s cock is hard and already weeping and fits into Draco’s hand like it was made for him. He runs his thumb around the head and Harry groans.
They watch through the happily ever after, and then the credits, as Potter calls them, and eventually the telly goes black and quiet.
Ultimately, though, Healer Mitchell is forced to admit that Harry is currently healthy and that the baby seems to be growing on schedule and not doing Harry any permanent damage. He sends Harry home with a list of potions to take daily and an appointment card for the following month.
They are quiet for a while, the typical city sounds, distant, the hum of the bees in the roses, gentle.
The man saw Draco… and just for a moment hard flinty eyes lit into foggy grey ones. The average man on the street might not have known what that look means, but Draco knows.
She must have known where he would send Draco; she had brought him the locket, after all. But Severus hadn’t told her… and Narcissa Black Malfoy was an absolute
“That must be…” Malfoy stopped, as though words failed him. “What… what did you see… when you saw me?”
He remembers all the days and nights in his cupboard, and then in his tiny bedroom at Privet Drive, weak and listless… he hadn’t known
Draco lets out a soft sob and Harry just holds him, running gentle fingers across his back. When he pulls back a little, Draco isn’t shaking quite so badly. He reaches up to trace Harry’s cheek. “I won’t let go either, Harry.”
Her name was Elladora, she’d said, and she was offering him a position in what she called a house of pleasure. He hadn’t expected it to be pleasurable for
Draco sits, wishes he hadn’t, and then stays put because standing isn’t really an option for him at the moment.
Draco thought it was too hot. He also thought that he would get into that water even if it were boiling. If there was anything in the world that would make him feel clean again, it
Draco’s guards release his bindings. And he slowly makes his way over to where Harry Potter is standing.
Weasley’s arms catch him, wrap around him, and Draco holds on tight. He presses his face into Weasley’s shoulder… until he finds the strength to hold himself upright again.
“They never tied me up.” Draco sounded utterly perplexed, though Harry wasn’t sure if it was because
“I’m so sorry.” Harry’s next breath comes out hard and fast… but his words are soft: “I could say it every minute of every day for the rest of my life and I will die never having said it enough.”
Malfoy meets his eyes, stubborn for a moment, and then Harry watches his resolve crumble. “All right.”
Outside the wind has died down to be replaced by a light rain. Draco can hear it, pattering softly against the living room windows.
Draco can play chess with Weasley, or check an Arithmancy proof with Granger, or even just sit, reading, on one end of the couch while Potter flips through a Quidditch magazine on the other.
“I’m looking for you, you know,” Harry says quietly. “Even if it’s only so you can slam the door in my face… I have to know.
Suddenly all the fierceness in the woman fades away and she looks utterly benevolent. “I can see that, dear,” she says. She stands, picking up her coffee. “I think I’ll just sit by the fire and read a bit. I think I see
“It’s for you. If you want it. It’s going to be a home… for witches and wizards who’ve lost their families… or whose families can’t take care of them. Muggleborn children, especially, who’d otherwise be raised in orphanages… or with relatives who hate them…” Draco promised himself that he wouldn’t cry. A lie. “But it’s for anyone, really. No one should grow up in a home where they aren’t loved.”
Fog smells crystal clear… and the smell doesn’t mix with anything else that might be there—always at least two separate smells. At Charlie’s cabin, he could smell fog… and the hopeful smell of freshly turned earth.
“You’ll leave when you’re ready, Harry,” Charlie whispers, cradling his face in the way that makes Harry feel as though he can float. “You’ll not leave a moment before that, or stay a moment longer. Do you understand?”
asleep and now he isn’t. The room is dark, he is safe, and the covers are holding in all the warmth that is Harry. Draco’s hand is resting on Harry and he finds one finger twisting, absently, in the slight fuzz that’s gathered in the center of Harry’s chest.
He moans appreciatively as the man thrusts into him… and tries to pretend that the man isn’t too sweaty… too hairy… too much smelling of stale garlic and expensive aftershave.
Harry is collapsed, more on him than next to him, and his beautiful eyes, laced with tears, are watching him. When Draco meets them, they hold his eyes… and Draco holds Harry’s back.
Draco was still feeling dizzy, and achingly hungry, and was fairly certain that the fact that his hand had at some point become clasped in Potter’s was the only thing keeping him upright. But…
