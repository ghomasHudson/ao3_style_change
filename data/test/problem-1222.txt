Jabbing his wand at his hair, he put it back up in the pompadour, mussing a few pieces up around the front. “Middle ground. I can find middle ground.” His wards shivered and a knock came at the door, making his jump and yelp. Hands shaking, he walked over to open the door.
Draco cleared his throat, tracing a swirl on the Formica tabletop with one finger. “I really only plan on working. I send Teddy’s gifts over by owl so he can open them on Christmas day.”
The second his hand wrapped around the little golden ball, it popped open. Inside was that day’s note.
Draco had pale grey slacks and a blue sweater, both accentuating his coloring and long, thin frame. The sleeves were pushed up almost to his elbows, something that Harry knew rarely happened when he was around anyone. “You’re late, Potter.”
Laughing, Harry opened his letter.  “Next, we have an owl arriving with house decorations. I have house decorations. They did that this morning.” The tapping at the window alerted them that the owl was in fact there, and once he had a treat and the box he brought had been enlarged, they found candles, ribbons, tinsel, wreaths, tiny village houses, a train. “The inside of the house. And the bottom of the letter has a recipe for gingerbread. Okay, then.” He handed the letter to Draco. “You said baking was like potions. We’ll work in here.”
“An empty picture frame, and pink and blue yarn? Why would you?” She suddenly noticed the grins on her son and daughter-in-law’s face, how Ron’s hands covered Hermione’s stomach as he held her against him. Yelling happily, Molly stood so quickly her gifts went flying. “You’re having a baby?”
Harry laughed, sliding his hand under Draco’s so that he was the one touching where the Mark had been, effectively stopping the movement of the sleeve. “I plan on it. I had to make sure the case would survive so I know whether to verbally or physically flay them alive.”
Draco smiled at him, a proper smile, no hint of a smirk, and Harry felt his stomach and heart switch places. “First, your work is not the same as mine, and second, you said you had a difficult day.” He shrugged, swirling the noodles using a fork and spoon and taking a neat bite. “If talking about it would help, I’m here to listen.”
“Made contact with the subject? You mean me? I’m the subject?” His hands began to shake, and he set the paper back on the coffee table.
“Cho!” She stopped rambling as Harry cut in loudly. “I have no issue with you and Ginny dating. I never did. Why would you think that?”
Harry looked a bit ill at ease at that comment. “I mean, we’re not running about monitoring your every move or anything, but we do pay attention to who seems to have changed for real and who’s faking it because it’s fashionable to do so.”
“Um…yeah?” Draco looked around the seating area then leaned to peer out the windows as much as he could, expecting to see the area surrounded by Aurors or staked out by former DA members, all ready to attack or arrest him for daring and be out and about in a muggle area. That was preposterous, though. He’d been having dinner at this restaurant every Tuesday for months, and no one had bothered him, yet. Tuesdays were their quietest nights, and he always had leftovers for Wednesday, which had been his long day of travel and training with Horace.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, I guess I just keep getting caught up in my head. Not the best habit for an Auror, huh?”
By the way, totes forgot to mention that the song title comes from the Vince Vance and the Valiants version, not the Mariah Carey one.
owl didn’t hurt so much. No one was standing next to this owl and looking at Harry with expectant eyes, eyes that asked if he was ready to move on, move past, get over. For once, someone saw his pain, validated the hurt that still existed where his first real friend had lived, and said that pain was allowed to stay as long as he needed it to. That the memory of that first friend was allowed to stay.
Harry blushed, portioning out pie for everyone, realizing he’d left the four vases and whatever note came along on the table that morning, having forgotten them completely during the day’s events. “They. Um. A friend?”
With a broken shout, Harry’s hips jerked, his release coating Draco’s hand, hip, and stomach. He dropped down along the blond, wrapping his arms around him and hugging. Smiling, Draco let himself be hauled close, snuggling into Harry’s chest.
“Please tell me you laid into whoever messed that up with every bit of pissy sass you used on me?” He started to tug his sleeve down.
Some emotion Draco couldn’t understand passed over Harry’s face, and his wand clattered the floor before he hauled the other man into a kiss.
A few minutes later, Draco entered, unwrapped his scarf. “I got your letter, Potter, I’m supposed to be at work.
Harry snorted, shoving her into the floor. Another roar of laughter echoed through the Burrow, and Molly walked over and took Little Fred. “Knock it off and clean up, you all. Dinner will be on the table in five minutes.”
Harry flushed and nodded, fingers carding into and tugging at his hair for a moment. “Yeah. I, uh. I’ve been wearing it a lot. I never meant for things to go as far as they did.” He flinched and shook his head. “With the case. I mean. I wanted things with you to go that far. Farther. As far as we can go, really.” He seemed to realize that his words weren’t necessarily soothing Draco, and shook his head. “I thought it was stupid when they first assigned you to me, asking to check out that you were safe. Obviously, you’re not a threat to anyone, not anymore. I don’t understand why some of the higher ups can’t get that through their head. It’s why I volunteered to take your case.”
Harry was stunned to see his Aunt Petunia’s handwriting in the book, several pictures of her and his mother as children and teens.
After work, Harry showed up at Draco’s with a bottle of Ogden’s and an overnight bag, making Draco smirk when he opened the door.
“Me, too.” Draco’s voice dropped, fingers stroking over the warm curve of Harry’s cheek. “And I want you to know that I’m not ashamed of you. Or of myself. I worry about their reaction, but I’m not ashamed of us. That’s not what this is.”
Harry laughed and nodded. “Arthur, why don’t you tell Draco about what we’ve done to the bike. He’s a bit nervous about it.”
Harry and Draco weren’t able to see each other much over the next few days. Draco started the next round of testing for his potions project, and Harry ended up being sent out with a small group of Aurors to bust the toy-scalping network they’d been tracking before Christmas. He made it back the night before the big game, though, and sent an owl to Draco right away to let him know they were still on to watch the match and to have lunch with the Weasleys. He also asked Draco to meet him at Grimmauld and apparate to the game together.
Harry swallowed hard, coughing as he did, unable to meet her gaze for a moment, then nodded. “Thank you. I’d like that.”
He nudged Draco toward the stairs and went to stoke the fire, but when he turned back around, Draco was still standing there, face streaky and mottled red. “Draco?”
Harry was pacing in his flat an hour before time to meet with Draco. He’d dressed nicely originally and even fixed his hair, but he’d run his fingers through it so many times that it quickly looked a mess again. He wanted to just rush to Draco and beg for forgiveness, but he knew it would be important how he handled. That it was important to show he trusted and respected Draco, which meant waiting until the time Draco specified. Finally, the clock chimed six. Nerves taking over, Harry adjusted his shirt and smoothed his jeans before stepping into the floo and traveling to Hogwarts.
Harry felt his body relax as he released the breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding, the same choked, sob-like sound from the morning repeating. Then, he’d nodded at the bird and left.
His mind continued to wander to blond strands that looked like silk, eyes that changed from silver to blue-grey depending on the lighting, questions of what color those eyes turned when aroused. If they went dark as the pupils blew wide or became paler as skin flushed.
Draco scowled and shoved back, accidentally knocking Harry into Walburga’s portrait. Harry grabbed at the cover to keep his balance, revealing the screeching image.
“You already know it’s a girl?” Harry looked over, noticing that Hermione’s stomach barely even curved enough to notice. Had he not known she was pregnant, he’d have never guessed it. “It is not too early to tell?”
By the time he clocked out, he was frustrated, had a gash through one eyebrow from the training course, and was running late. He wasted about one second thinking he should reschedule with Draco before tossing that idea. He floo’d home long enough change into pressed slacks and a dark green button down and cast a cleaning charm over himself, then apparated to lobby of Draco’s building. The old hotel had been refurbished using wizarding space to create flats. Running his hands over his hair to flatten it, he crossed to the elevators. He paced the confines, shaking his hands and blowing out a hard breath.
Walking home, he realized it was probably politeness that led Potter to say such a thing and was, thus, unlikely to happen. It was nice, though. And he was still smiling.
Less than a week later, Draco ran into Potter at his favorite breakfast diner. Potter was stretched out in Draco’s usual booth, two plates piled high before him, and was nursing a steaming cup of coffee. He grinned when the two made eye-contact, waving Draco over.
The sound was more of a hiccup than a real whoo, and Harry spun around, wand drawn, to see the smallest, fluffiest owl he’d ever laid eyes on sitting atop a small tree next to his desk. The little thing puffed up as it realized it had been noticed and fluttered its wings, wings that looked too tiny to actually carry the animal anywhere, and the pushed one little leg toward Harry, almost toppling off the tree as it did so.
Sirius looked from his fiancé to his godson then back to Draco and nodded again. He pulled Harry out of the way when Draco motioned them aside and pulled out his wand. “It won’t do any good to blast her. I’ve tried. Depulso. Incendio. Nothing works. Just damages the wall.”
“What? I’m not going to sugarcoat it. This is too important.” Sirius turned his attention back to Harry. “He’s who’s hurt. And you might hurt, too, but his pain needs to come first because you’re who messed up.”
Harry frowned, reaching out to grab Draco’s arm as he started to stand. “Why aren’t you coming with us? I want you to come with us.”
Grinning, Harry nodded as the waitress left. “Bacon is the best breakfast food. It’s one of the few things I deign worthy of cooking without bitching.”
Harry ran though the days in his head. “Eleven. No, ten. Day ten. Ten traditions. Do I even know ten traditions?”
Draco somehow went numb from head to toe while also feeling himself shake all over as he watched Harry step out of the fireplace. His dark skin had a paler to it, and there were dark circles under his eyes. His hair seemed to stand out from his head in all directions, almost as if he’d attempted to yank it out before arriving.
until Kreatcher called him for dinner. Sitting on the table was charred fillet steak and a wine bottle.
Harry nodded, rendered mute by seeing Draco on his knees. His fingers sifted through the soft blond strands, careful not to tangle since they were still damp.
Draco pulled the other man’s hand away. “Be glad you’re good looking. Fine.” He faced Hermione again but didn’t let go of Harry’s hand. “In fifteen minutes, I can help you with that.”
Not much of a wine drinker, Harry lifted the bottle to read the label, but Domaine de la Romanee-Conti meant nothing to him. He popped the cork and poured a glass, thinking Malfoy would probably understand the significance. The robust flavor was nice, though, and it paired nicely with his steak, even to his untrained tongue.
His words cut off as Harry took his arm. “I don’t understand why you wouldn’t think I’d like you.” Realizing how his words sounded, how they might be taken, hell, how he might be meaning them, Harry felt himself turn just as red as Draco. “I mean, we were both pawns in someone else’s war, just on different sides. It’s not like either of us had much choice in what we were told we had to do.” He dropped Draco’s arm, laughing without any real mirth behind it and stepped back to lean against the counter. “Innocents shouldn’t be punished for the plotting of others, right? We were innocents, just kids. I’d like to think who we really are, underneath all of that, is who we are now.”
It was storming when Draco apparated onto Harry’s doorstep. Lightning split the sky, thunder rattling windows, as Draco knocked, unsure anyone would even hear him. Harry opened the door a few moments later, though.
Malfoy shrugged, hands sliding into the pockets of his back slacks, his outer robes hung over his arm. “I don’t do much for the holidays, usually. Tend to work.” He cleared his throat. “Most the rest of my department has a family at home.”
Draco thrashed on the bed until Harry used his bulkier mass to hold him down, making him whimper as a fresh burst of arousal flood through him. Then that mouth, that sinfully sarcastic mouth, wrapped around him, making his focus splinter and hips lift.
“You love them.” He grinned as she nodded. “No, I actually have another favor, I guess. I was hoping to bring someone over for dinner.”
The man huffed out a breath, muttering for Harry to remove his elbow from his stomach and sit still.
As if on cue, the redhead in question barged through the door, apologizing for being a bit late, but he’d sent food home to Hermione. He stopped and looked from the broom to Harry then back, grinning, “Awww, mate, you shouldn’t have.”
Draco gave a strangled laugh, fingers digging into the small of Harry’s back. “Go sit down before I change my mind.”
He could hear Draco swallow before taking a breath and turning his head to look down his body at Harry. “I want you to make love to me.”
There was a thunk, and he looked up to see Potter had dropped his broom, a strange, twisted look on his face, as if he, too, were suddenly back in the room. He stepped forward and drug Draco into a tight hug, face buried against his neck, shockingly intimate and similar to how Draco had clung to him all those years ago. “I know. It was hard for me, too, but I had the Weasley’s to fly with, to remind me. I hadn’t thought that you’d….I didn’t think about you. The real you and not the school bully. I’m sorry. I should have known. We’ll fly some more, just us, before we play a game with the others, okay?”
Blushing, Harry shrugged. “I figured we ought to be officially dating before I gave you a gold ring.” He ducked, looking up at Draco through his fringe. “Next time?”
Harry laughed so hard he doubled over, hands on his knees and wheezing. Draco was about to ask if he was all right, when he straightened, cupped the blond’s face, and pressed their lips together. “You’re amazing, you know that? An asshole but amazing.”
Draco felt a matching grin form on his own face. “I can make sure my lesson plans are all done before you get back.”
“Fuck, you’re going to kill me, Potter.” Draco’s voice was high, thready, and he arched to press closer.
“The someone that gift is for?” She smiled at him, it widening as he nodded. “Of course, my sweet boy. You’re my last unpaired child, and that just won’t do.”
“And wandless. Been practicing more and more of that, in case it ever comes in handy on a mission.” Harry shrugged. “Aurors do a lot of wordless practice, sneak attack sort of thing, and most of us can do basic wandless work, summon our wands back, but I thought, what good is that if you’re still being attacked from all sides? Or there’s two, and one takes the wand while the other fires some hex at you? But I can’t push to have others do what I can’t. I started with simpler things, like levitation and opening and closing doors, the kind of first-year stuff we learned in school.”
“Technically, my having a family box means I can go to any game I want. If you’d like, we could all meet up and watch the Magpies play the Kestrels at the end of the month.”
Eventually, he sat on the couch and noticed that there were papers and quills strewn across the coffee table. He remembered that Harry had mentioned having paperwork for his job to do the night before, and, not wanting to pry, Draco started to move a file folder to cover the papers. Until he noticed that several of the pages had his name on them.
“Never.” Harry nipped his lips, pushing him back against the desk. “I’ve wanted to kiss you for so long. Wanted you for so long.” Harry’s lips found Draco’s again, and he moaned as he felt the other man’s hips buck into his. Shifting, he slid one thigh between Draco’s and rolled his hips, both moaning as their growing erections rubbed against one another.
Draco groaned and covered his face, his words a rush. “I mean. I was a little busy in high school trying not to die, and since then, the whole former Death Eater thing. I’m not really someone most decent people want to be seen with.”
Harry let his mind drift over all the different men he’d gone to school with, narrowing them down to quidditch players who worked on his floor, but his mind kept going back to the same one. He grinned at how he’d managed to shock and flush Draco that morning, but he’d meant what he said. He did enjoy the time with him, and he wasn’t ashamed to be friends.
Draco shook his head rapidly, looking as if he still didn’t believe Ron was saying yes. “No, that’s fine. The box is big enough your whole family could come along.” He blushed suddenly. “Not that I’m trying to brag or anything. I just meant.”
Draco straightened as Harry crossed the room, cupped his face, and dipped his head to kiss him, nipping his full lower lip. “Please owl me if that changes? Please?”
The two played board games and built houses from Legos all morning before deciding to go out for lunch. Bundling up, the sleet having turned to actual snow overnight, they headed out to their favorite fish and chips place, Teddy chattering the whole time about what he wanted for Christmas and how cousin Draco had taken him out to by grandma a present. Harry felt his face heat at that, knowing he hadn’t even done his own shopping, let alone thought of helping Teddy with his.
Sirius Black never expected to be happy. Once he realized he wouldn’t follow his family’s belief system, he’d resigned himself to survival and then rebellion. James threw a wrench in that plan when he took Sirius in as family, and Remus further complicated things by teaching Sirius to love.
The owl looked up at his cough-that-was-not-a-sob and fluttered back over to the desk, poking around a candy dish before pulling out a peppermint chew and hopping over to nudge it at Harry. Without thinking, Harry opened the treat and popped it in his mouth, grimacing when he bit down and remembered he hated peppermint, how strong it was in things like this, but the owl was watching him, so he dutifully finished the treat, smiling as the tiny thing fluffed and hooted happily, giant eyes squinting shut, when he swallowed it down.
Hermione waved a frustrated hand at Ron, wiping her eyes with the other. “This from the man who was too afraid to come break up you guys kissing because he might say something wrong or see something he shouldn’t, so he sent his pregnant wife to do it.”
Draco smiled at how this conversation mimicked the one from the night before. “I know. I just feel like I should tell them in person and not send a note saying I’m skipping lunch to make out with my boyfriend.”
Potter re-appeared, a drink and large order of naan bread in hand, and dropped into the booth across from Draco. “So, this place good? I’ve heard of it, but this is my first time trying it.”
“I did have a secret for getting around undetected, gift from my father and his friends during their time at Hogwarts. I’ll have to show the next time you’re over.”
More than a little confused, Harry collected his package and ice cream then went to sit down. “There’s no way he…” But when he opened the package, there were a pair of black socks with gold lightning bolts decorating them and a note.
“He works here, doesn’t he? She? Dammit.” He sighed then laughed. “It’s hard having a true love you don’t know if you’ve even met. But you couldn’t have gone farther than this floor without help, and whoever they are, they saw Davies bringing your things back yesterday.” Harry scrunched up the left side of his face and chewed his lip. “Can you take a letter for me?”
Harry watched as Draco’s wand swished in one hand, his other hand hitting buttons on the stove and sliding in the pan of bread, amazed by the ease with which he combined wizarding and muggle behaviors. In moments, bowls of spaghetti bol were steaming on the table, the wine sitting between them.
Today's chapter is a little short comparatively, but I liked how it went too much to fuck with that. I may miss a day coming up, holidays with the family and all, so my bad in advance. I'm definitely committed to completing this, though.
“Letter? Run?” Harry groaned and rubbed both hands over his face. He hadn’t set an alarm to run today, having wanted to sleep in and enjoy the high from last night. And he hadn’t look for a letter while heading downstairs to answer the door. “Accio letter.” It zipped into his hand, and he tore it open.
“Whatever our feelings on Draco’s past, we love Harry. We should trust and support him enough to at least give this a shot.”
Draco grinned. “I may or may not be one of the people funding the broom and thus have some inside information.” His smile faded as he lifted the lid to the box he’d just unwrapped. “This is. Harry.” In the box were a set of potions utensils made with unicorn horn handles and two silver cauldrons encrusted with emeralds, one collapsible and one self-stirring.
Sirius laughed and walked over to crouch in front of Harry, clapping him on the knee. “Look. We’ll figure out a way for you and him to see each other again. But you need to think about what you’re going to say.”
Once back at Grimmauld place, Kreatcher already had shepherd’s pie in the oven, so Harry set the table and got everyone drinks while Draco helped Teddy out of his winter coat, gloves, and scarf. Remembering his thought from the night before, Harry poured himself and Draco glasses of wine rather than getting his usual beer.
“How did someone even get into my office?” His brain seemed to snap back on as he spoke aloud, and he dropped the missive on his desk, sending spells around the room to test for danger, but no. Everything was in perfect order minus the owl in the…. “Is that a pear tree?”
Teddy and Harry began untangling the lights, and Draco sorted the ornaments into piles only he seemed to understand. Soon enough, the three of them had everything on the tree, but it seemed to lilt a bit to the left.
“You’ll eat your words. This Saturday. Seekers game. Just us. If I win, you have to come to our next pickup game.” Harry poked Draco in the side. “And I know you’re just teasing me to avoid admitting you’re afraid to come.” He grinned, tossing his dark hair back out of his eyes. “It’s fine. I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t. I’m not blind to the people around me and their feelings, and if I thought it would be an uncomfortable time for you, I wouldn’t mention it.”
Smiling, Harry cupped Draco’s face, leaning forward and pressing his lips against his cheek, kissing back toward his ear to murmur. “I don’t want our first kiss forced and in front of Teddy. Not our first real kiss, at least.” Letting go of Draco, noting that the flush on his face had gone splotchy and he was biting his lip, Harry trailed his thumb over Draco’s jaw, tightening his hand briefly to squeeze the side of his neck, then stepped back. “What would you?” He stopped, Teddy already asleep in front of the fire. Harry laughed. “Guess I’ll owl Andromeda, tell her not to worry about him.”
Harry felt a rush of longing along with a twinge of jealousy at the idea of anyone hooking up with this secret person, but he promptly squelched that since he didn’t know who the person in question even was. And really, how could he be jealous over someone he only knew through gifts? And notes? Wonderful notes full of understanding and secrets that made him ache for…someone? And wasn’t that really the problem? He wanted someone he didn’t know and was also starting to want someone he did know but was pretty sure he couldn’t have.
Harry grinned at Draco, that same stubborn lock of dark hair falling into his face, and for once Draco didn’t resist. He just reached out and ran his fingers through the unruly curls, brushing it back out of Harry’s face.
They all headed toward the lift, Ron and Draco discussing how the quidditch match had gone the previous weekend.
The little elf popped into the living room, bowing, her large green eyes moving from one man to the other. “Dibby to collect Mr. Potter’s bag?”
Draco sniffed and went back into Harry’s arms, leaning against him until the room turned chilly as the fire started to die down.
“Like hell I do.” He face flushed red, then he sighed and shook his head. “I love my mother, and I do my best to spend time with her, even though that house still gives me nightmares, but my father.” He shook his head. “My father put love of blood above love of blood, if that makes sense.” Harry nodded, and Draco continued, somewhat hesitantly. “I’m tired of defending myself to him. Defending why I refuse to further the pureblood agenda, or any other of his agendas. Defending being gay, having an actual job, reconnecting with Andromeda and Teddy, the people I spend time with.”
He stopped. Close himself off. Maybe he’d closed off too much. Closed out too many. Picking up the letter, he almost accio’d a quill to respond when he remembered Grinch was still in the office, a note left for the elves to please keep his food and water fresh as they took care of the office. The owl had looked up as Harry had prepared to leave the night before, but when Harry made no move to collect him, he’d hopped over to his tree without a sound.
Draco’s brows raised as Harry handed him the glass, gaze darting to the bottle. “Domaine de la Romanee-Conti? I wouldn’t have thought myself worth that.”
Blushing, Draco looked over as Harry poked his head back inside, tugging the sheets up over his chest, but the brunette just walked over and kissed him. “I’ve got breakfast started, if you’re hungry.”
“Let me get my broom. Would either of you mind if I asked the other potioneers? A few more are off, now.”
This time, Harry interlaced their fingers, lifted their hands, and kissed Draco’s palm. “I trust you.”
Harry stared at the perfect, precise script, reading through it three times before feeling like anything had sunk into his suddenly thick skull.
“Not on this trip, no. I was too afraid that Harry would steal them.” Draco winked at his boyfriend, his tension easing with how well their relationship seemed to be accepted by the two men who’d come to mean as much to him, if not more by this point, as his own family.
It took a moment, but then Harry started and pulled his hands away, twisting to lay alongside Draco rather than on top of him. “Oh! You’re a virgin.”
Harry was always pissed if someone interrupted his work with no warning, though, and he didn’t want to piss Draco off this early in their relationship. Or at least what he hoped was a relationship.
With a groan, Harry dropped his face into the crook of Draco’s neck, losing his rhythm as he simply thrust until his own orgasm hit.
Draco stared for a moment, looking at Harry, not the clothes, then strode across the room and kissed him hard, tongue battling for entrance then dominance.
Harry coughed, brows dropping low over his eyes, and he shook his head and straightened his robes. “No, I shouldn’t have.”
“I expected more of me, too.” Draco sighed, and shook his head. “I suppose I’ll need to practice, since I’m playing against you in pick-up games.”
Scrubbing his eyes, he practically walked over someone else as he reached the lift to head to the atrium and floo home. Someone tall with white-blonde hair and who smelled like sweat and cedar and rain, but the clean kind of rain that left everything refreshed rather than the dirty sludge still falling outside. He barely registered Draco Malfoy was who he’d just barreled over in enough time to stop himself from burying his face in all that pale hair and breathing in that scent.
Draco laughed, the sound high-pitched and too sharp. “No. I don’t suppose I was supposed to.” Standing, Draco paced in a circle, holding up his hand and backing away from Harry when he tried to step closer. “Don’t. Just don’t. I’m a case? This was all a case.”
“So, you can wandlessly and wordlessly summon things to you and close doors?” Draco’s voice was a bit hoarse, and Harry felt his lower body jump, remembering the last time he’d made Draco sound like that.
Sirius nodded. “My mum burned me off the family tapestry, but legally, I was still a Black. I was able to access my part of the family fortune once I turned twenty-one, and this was what I wanted for my birthday.”
Draco snorted. “You think my family would have stood for such creatures in our precious flower beds? And any food gardens like this were kept far away from where I could be exposed to them. I went berry picking once. A wife of some diplomat father was schmoozing took me and their kids. My fingers were stained blue and purple, and I thought mother would have a heart attack.”
Draco’s mouth twisted, curving upward to one side. “Damaging the wall is my goal.” He pointed his wand and fired off several careful aimed blasts around the portrait, leaving half a dozen holes punctured almost completely through the wall. Everyone stayed quiet as he continued to stand stock still and study his work. After several long minutes, he laughed. “She’s stuck to the wall, but the wall isn’t stuck.” He turned and took in the confused faces of the others. “The wall isn’t repairing itself. It’s just a wall.” No one seemed to catch on. “That means, you could rip the wall out around her portrait.”
Lunch out had turned into dinner with Seamus and Dean. While Seamus couldn’t be near a cauldron without setting it on fire, he was a whiz at baking and was trying and failing to teach Draco. Most nights they met up, Draco would be thrown out of the kitchen to talk about books and politics with Dean while Seamus struggled to salvage whatever they were making.
He’d just settled down with his first cup of tea and the stack of tasks for his section of the department when the little bird flew back in, all but landed in the cup, and sent tea splashing all over everything.
Teddy shook his head, speaking around a mouthful of greasy potatoes. “No, we bought your gift, too. And for Aunt Cissy.”
“Why? Why is it so important to you?” Draco’s voice was soft, hoarse, pitched so low Harry couldn’t have heard him had he not been so close.
Draco smiled. “I’ll make sure you learn how this year, so you can surprise her by teaching her again next year.”
“You got an owl? I thought you refused to get an owl.” Ron froze as he started to set the food down, apparently realizing what he’d just brought up. “I mean, I’m glad you’ve… Uh. He seems cute?”
Remus placed his hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezing and smiling down at the young man. “Then, let’s figure out how to get you two speaking again, let you tell him that. Knowing you love him, that you feel the same, will mean a lot.”
“Yes. I can’t very well show up in yesterday’s t-shirt. The woman is probably already going to go apoplectic when she sees me. I ought to at least try, and my best clothes are at my house.”
Draco was bright pink again. “I never actually did anything. I mean, Aunt Bella didn’t try to go after Tonks, and Remus always kept her protected.”
That same twist of strange twist of Harry’s face happened. “Never. I never want to hurt you.” With a pop, they were upstairs again, falling onto the bed together, a tangle of lips and tongue.
“I…I just can’t, Grinch. I’m not….” He sighed and looked over. “I can’t.” He hadn’t expected the owl to understand, could all but see the want to go with him radiating off the animal, but Grinch had simply stared back for long minutes before hopping over to his pear tree and hooting once more.
Finally, Teddy launched himself at Draco’s legs but was too small to knock the man over. Giggling, he looked over at Harry, calling for help.
Harry pulled back, making Draco whine as he’d been tugging the two of them toward the bed. “I don’t want to rush you. I know you don’t trust me again, yet, and I don’t want to hurt you.”
He flooed to his parents’ house for their regular lunch meeting. His mother and father were waiting as he exited the floo, looking as if they expected something between a riot and full-blown war. In fact, he’d not seen them look this serious since the end of the Second Wizarding War and their trials.
“Hey, hey, hey.” Harry pulled Draco’s hands away and kissed his nose. “I’m not mad or taking the piss or something. It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with being a virgin, and you don’t need to defend yourself to me. It just means I need to be.” He waved one hand in a circle. “Nicer? Slower? Not an asshole.”
The redhead was shorter than him but strong from her career as a Chaser, and she grabbed his arm to stop him. “I don’t care. The two of you are miserable apart, and I miss my friend being happy.”
“You know. Usually you have one stocking for each person in the house. I didn’t need twelve, when there’s only me.”
Harry’s thigh nudged between Draco’s, and he arched again, hips twisting at the friction he felt. Harry ground his own hips back down, and Draco moaned and whined when he felt that the other man was just as turned on. His moan turned into a string of babbled curses and begging when Harry continued to rub them together, mouth assaulting its way down to suck one nipple into his mouth.
Harry had been called away from his desk before he could respond, forced to sit through his mid-month meeting with Robards and the other heads of office while that letter and all its implications burned through his mind.
Harry laughed so hard he almost spilled his coffee and had to right his tray before continuing to read.
Harry didn’t set his alarm the next morning, and though his body still woke him fairly early, he managed an extra hour of sleep before making his way downstairs to breakfast, wondering if he could convince Kreatcher to make more of those cinnamon rolls from yesterday. He stopped cold when he reached the kitchen, though, the heel of one hand still pressed against his eye as he scrubbed the last of sleep away. Harry had remodeled most of Grimmauld place, getting rid of the cobwebs, elf heads, and portraits of Walburga, but he’d kept a few items that reminded him of what had happened here. One of those was the long table he and the Order sat at while planning during the War. He often sat at the same place Sirius had, placed his hands where his godfather had in an attempt to still feel close to him.
Hermione passed a gift to Molly, before exchanging a look with Ron. Harry paused in opening his current present and watched as Molly unwrapped hers.
“Come back to my place?” Harry’s words were murmured against Draco’s mouth, making Draco shiver as he nodded. With a pop, they apparated back to Harry’s house.
“It’s a snitch.” Settling his glasses on his face, he saw he was right. Darting around his bedroom was a golden snitch. Harry laughed, grabbing his wand to silence his alarm before jumping up and chasing the little golden ball around the room. He was winded by the time he caught it, but he was still laughing, far happier about starting his Monday than he was before.
“I thought the stirring stick and stuff matching your wand would be, I don’t know, at least cool, if not somehow helpful.”
Draco shook his head, holding tighter to Harry when he made a distressed noise and started to pull back. “Using that sort of potion isn’t trust. Not for real, and I want real trust. I won’t lie. It’s going to take some time to really get over this. Tonight helps, but it’s not perfect. Not yet.”
Harry’s eyes were drawn to Draco’s lips, full and a deep pink from the cold. He swallowed hard as he felt the urge to kiss Draco and see if his lips were as soft as they looked. Before he could follow through with that urge, though, Teddy dove on top of them, dumping an armful over snow on them both.
“No!” Draco’s head snapped up as Harry started to pull away, and they cracked foreheads, both cursing in pain then laughing. “I didn’t mean for you to leave. I just, I suppose I’m awkward. I don’t mind you staying. I’d…I’d like that.”
Draco nodded, face warm as he kissed Harry again. “Of course. And maybe we can talk about how I tell my parents? Talk about how you told your family?”
“Look, I never liked you when we were younger. I think I always kind of knew you and Harry had some…thing between you, and Harry was ‘supposed’ to be mine.” She snorted. “God, children are stupid.” She shook her head and grinned wryly. “Anyways. I didn’t know Harry was told to talk to you. I honestly thought he’d just bumped into you and fallen back into obsession and circling around you again.”
“Harry.” His head snapped around, eyes narrowed, not sure why Draco refused to use his given name. That damned brow lifted again, and Harry crowded into Draco’s space before he could respond with his usual snark and sass. “Call me Harry.” Draco’s eyes went wide, pupils dilating, and Harry realized they were both breathing far too hard for having stopped flying several minutes ago. “Call me Harry, Draco.”
Growling softly, Harry gripped Draco’s hips and pulled him close again, lips slanting over his. “I hadn’t expected, hadn’t meant.”
Draco tugged the slacks and pants down, gasping softly as Harry’s cock sprang free. “I’d say that’s not fair, but since I get to appreciate it, I’ll go for thank you.”
He yawned as he walked into his office, waving his wand to start some tea, the stopped cold in the middle of his office. Hands shaking, he swallowed heavily and crossed to his desk, lifting a letter in a familiar, barely legible scrawl.
“I know. I want to. Need to taste you.” His fingers worked at the flies of Harry’s slacks. “Let me?”
Draco froze the second Harry’s lips touched his, sure he must be dreaming. They did not just kiss in the middle of a crowded street like they did this all the time. Like it hadn’t upended Draco’s entire world. Like this wasn’t everything he’d known he didn’t deserve from the moment he realized how vile his family’s beliefs, the belief’s he spouted as fact, really were back in fourth year. “Amazing asshole?”
He took his time in the tub, lingering over the food and wine before washing, enjoying how the water had been charmed to stay warm no matter how long he stayed in. Once out, he wandered back to his bedroom with just a towel wrapped around him. And there was the fifth snitch, darting around his bed. He dove forward, grabbing it before it could get far and falling into the bed.
They were waiting for their godson to come over with Sirius’s second cousin….and Harry’s apparent new boyfriend.
He hadn’t been sure things would return to normal after Azkaban and the second war, but here he sat in the drawing room of 12 Grimmauld Place with Remus’s head in his lap as he read and his fingers wound loosely through the honey-colored curls that framed a scared, age-lined face. Nothing had ever looked so beautiful or felt so right.
The woman behind the counter smiled and shook her head, “No. It was left here in expectation of you.”
“Whatever it’s going to manifest.” He smiled back up. “I’m fine. Really. Mum asked the same thing this morning, and I told her just what I’m telling you. Go. Give Andromeda and Teddy my love.”
That night, Harry came home already planning on sending Draco an owl to come over for dinner only to find a package and note on his table.
“Basically.” Harry flushed, rubbing the hand not holding Draco’s over his face. “Would you feel better if I asked specifically?”
So sorry to be a day behind! My family is an eight-hour drive from where I live, and between packing and the trip, I wasn't able to finish on time. Here is day eight, though, and I will continue with day nine tomorrow. Thank you all for reading and your patience!!
Sirius grinned as he caught on. “Then, she goes to the attic with the elf heads we removed from upstairs.”
Sirius coughed and scrubbed at his burning eyes, twisting his head to the side as he focused on keeping himself under control.
“They said you were still here. I wanted to invite you to mine for dinner. I’m making fish. Heard it went well with white wine.” He winked.
Laughing, Harry tugged the blond up to kiss him. “Yeah, okay.” He stroked Draco’s cheek. “I think it fits, though. All the red and green together. Happy.”
When the reached the Ministry pitch, the others were already there, George included. Since there were only twelve of them, they decided to play without seekers, Harry and Draco ending up Chasers on the same team. Within minutes of starting the game, it became obvious they were the force to beat. They flew in sync, years of flying against each other letting them know how the other moved, when to dodge the other’s dive.
“Fuck, Draco, I’m not going to last.” He could feel Draco laugh, the sound reverberating up his throat and through Harry’s dick. His head fell back, muscles going taunt, and lights burst behind his eyes. “Draco!”
She laughed as they reached the back door, and Molly stepped up to take their coats and hug Harry. “Food is going on the table as we speak.”
He tied the letter to the bird’s let. “Off you go.” Grinch looked at the letter and back at Harry. “Go on. Take it to whoever sent you.” The bird sat down and looked back at the letter before titling his head as far to the side as it will go. “I promise, I won’t follow you. I’m not trying to cheat, or whatever. Just, take the letter? Please?” With that Grinch popped up and flew out of the office.
Then, when Minerva reached out to ask him about his aptitude with potions and whether he wanted to pursue that, he began an apprenticeship under Slughorn.
Harry smiled as Draco just gaped at him from the doorway. Waving his hand, Harry slammed the door, the close of it smacking Draco in the ass and jolting him into the room. “Come on in. Get comfortable. Pull up a plate.”
They laughed, Harry letting Draco’s feet slide back down as he panted for breath from excitement. “Well, I did have to show off, right? Everyone’s golden boy and all.”
Harry could hear the pout in Draco’s voice, and he fought the urge to smile. “I know, but sometimes, I really hate being alone.”
Harry laughed, kissing her forehead. “Yeah. Yeah, it is. Can we go eat and enjoy our very gay love lives?”
Draco knocked his tea cup over, though it was at least mostly empty. “Me? At the Weasley house? I don’t think so Potter.”
Ron also took a little time to come around to Draco’s presence, but almost like a switch flipped, he one day started acting like they were best mates and not former enemies. Draco and Harry were actually on their way to meet Ron for lunch at a café next to WWW.
Harry’s morning was uneventful, as far as mornings had been going. No snitches fluttered around his head when he awoke. There were no flowers on the table, other than the lilies. The sunflowers had been moved to the living room, the roses were in his office, and the larkspurs were next to his bed. He floo’d to work and did not dally around the atrium for an extra five minutes hoping to see a flash of blond hair. And when he stopped by the potions lab to see how things were, he was not disappointed to find out that Draco had the day off.
Harry groaned, mouth latching tightlhyonto the pale skin as he shoved his jeans to his hips and pulled Draco back against him. With a whispered lube charm, he wrapped his hand around them both, groaning again at the feel of Draco’s cock pressed against him. “Ride me.” Draco moaned, hips jerking as he started to roll his hips into Harry’s. “Just like that, baby.” Harry bit his way to Draco’s ear, murmuring. “I want you to use my body until you fall apart for me.”
Harry laughed harder, wrapping his arm around Draco and lounging back. “So, I have years of you showing me up to look forward to?” He felt Draco jolt next to him, and his face heated as he thought about what he’d said.
Draco snorted, gaze glued to where Harry was touching his left forearm. “You know why I don’t call you Harry?” A bit stunned at the change, Harry should his head. “Because it lets you get close, and I’m terrified of that.”
Taking a breath, Harry met Draco’s gaze. “I was assigned to check you out when my superiors found out you were hired at Hogwarts, and I did run into you on purpose because of that. At first. But I really liked being around you, liked you, and by the time I fell in love, I’d forgotten why it all started. I was so happy with the now. And I’d like the chance to prove that to you.” Harry held his out. “If you’d let me.”
“I thought.” Harry swallowed and closed his eyes, face scrunched up in concentration. “I don’t want to push you. You don’t have to. We don’t have to.”
Draco laughed and shook his head. “No, but I suppose you’re just as excited about Teddy’s gift as he will be.” Harry paused for a moment, realizing both of them were in the children’s broom section and both planned to buy for Teddy. Before he could speak, Draco touched his arm. “Relax, Pot—” he cleared his throat. “Relax, Harry. I know how important it is to you to get him a broom. I wouldn’t take that from you. I’m looking for a learner’s cleaning kit to compliment it.” Harry smiled, head tilted to the side, and Draco flushed, looking down and away. “Mother always said that it was custom in the Black family for a godfather to buy the first broom.”
He felt like the grinch, but he hadn’t the heart to steal anyone else’s joy in order to try and create his own.
“I’ve got yours under the tree.” Grinning, Harry kissed Draco and tugged him inside. “Come on. I don’t want dinner to burn.”
Harry’s smile somehow seemed to get bigger. “Gods, you’re perfect. You know that? Go see your parents. I’ve got some paperwork to finish up for work. I’ll see you tomorrow, though?”
When his alarm woke him on Saturday morning, bright and early for the daily runs he demanded of himself, he snarled and contemplated throwing a well-aimed incendio at it. As he rolled to quite the sound, though, he noticed a tray next to his bed. Kreatcher knew he wouldn’t eat until after he returned from his run, so the plate of food under a stasis charm was highly out-of-place. Sitting up, Harry removed the charm and groaned as the scents assailed him, pulling the tray into his lap. It was piled high with cinnamon rolls, bacon and sausage, and fresh fruit, and when he tried the coffee, it was perfect. Just the right temperature and the right amount of milk to take the bite out of the bitterness. Even better, when he allowed himself a small taste of a roll, he realized that rather than being regular cinnamon rolls, they were flavored with…
“Teddy, no!” It was too late, though. The snowball hit its mark, smacking Draco in the side of the head. Harry froze as Draco stopped, head turning. His scarf was up around his mouth, hat pulled low, so it was impossible to tell his reaction. Just as Harry started to apologize for Teddy, Draco launched forward, tacking the little boy to the ground and tickling him, making Teddy squeal with laughter even though he probably couldn’t feel much through his thick jacket
Thus, Draco found himself pacing his living room on Saturday night. He was dressed in dark charcoal slacks and a matching waistcoat over a blue-grey button-up, an outfit he knew emphasized his coloring and how lithe his body was overall. He was still nervous, though. Harry had said to look nice, but he worried he looked too nice. What was nice according to Harry Potter’s standards?
“About tonight. I know it can be difficult, all the reporters and stuff who circle me, and since you’re not out.” He shrugged. “I just don’t want you to be uncomfortable.”
Potter laughed again, running a hand through his hair. “I usually go for a seven, minimum. Give me a minute to grab my order, and I’ll join you. Yeah?” Without waiting for an answer, he was off to get his food.
Harry groaned and pulled Draco into a kiss, hands running over his body. “You’re going to be the death of me. I swear.” He pulled back running his hands through his own hair, still wrecked from sleep and the previous night. “Okay, I can’t impress you if I burn your bacon. Go away so I can focus.”
Draco put his coat on and collected his things as the others left. “Thank you, Potter. For dinner and, well, for everything.”
Teddy made a show of finishing his bite before speaking again. “No, he said I didn’t have to get him something since he’d be at work on Christmas, but Grandma says I should.”
“I don’t care why it set a standard, it did.” Hermione nodded and added a third helping of chicken to her plate.
Draco was quiet for a long moment, and Harry turned back to look at him. “I, uh, I wouldn’t have thought I was someone you’d like. Not after.” His face flushed, and he ducked, running a hand through his already mussed hair. “No matter. I’m glad you’re indulging a bit. You’ve earned a little happiness.”
Draco’s own broom slipped from his shaking fingers, and he couldn’t answer. All he could do was nod and wrap his own arms around Potter. Harry.
Later that night, Minerva caught Draco as he slipped away from the Great Hall without eating, again.
Draco nodded. “I was. I’ve been afraid to lose them because I lost a lot of people during the war and stuff, which I know was my own fault, but I don’t have much left.” His voice cracked, and he had to clear his throat. “I was afraid of being alone. I’m not afraid of that anymore, though. Not now that I have you.”
to go in, but I want to go check the project. That’s why you always see me on my days off. I enjoyed today, too.” He hesitated a moment, then leaned forward to kiss Harry’s cheek. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Harry.”
“You reminded him, um, her. Them. Of me, huh? Does that make you a grinch, too?” The owl hooted again, wiggling a bit as he settled himself down in the middle of Harry’s blotter. Sighing, Harry waved his want to put the tree next to the window then transfigured a cup into a bowl and aguamenti’d some water into it. “Allright, Grinch. You have until Christmas.”
Grinch landed on his shoulder as he made it downstairs, running late due to getting lost in his thoughts, so he used the floo rather than walking as he preferred. Draco was arriving as he did, hair perfectly coifed back off his face. Harry wanted to run his fingers through it, muss it up, and he blushed.
Harry kissed him again, shaking his head and guiding Draco backwards. “No shouldn’ts. Just us. What we want.” His teeth raked along Draco’s jaw, and he nuzzled back to the sensitive place under his ear, the one that made the blond whine, all high-pitched and shivery. “And I missed you, too. These damn clothes, that damn bed. It wasn’t warm with you anymore.” He caught Draco around the waist, lifting him and tossing him back onto the bed. “I’ve been sleeping on the couch.”
Her smile widened slightly, and she nodded. “You simply ask them to visit and give them your floo address. Just, don’t let them run too wild around campus once students are here.”
Though his team lost that game, Seamus invited Draco out for lunch and shopping later that week. By the time Draco had been joining Harry and his friends for Quidditch for a few weeks of regular quidditch games, they’d become quite close. In fact, Draco actually felt quite at ease with most of the circle. He’d even started to think of a few of them as his own friends. Acquaintances, at least. Maybe whatever was between the two.
When Draco’s wand buzzed to let him know his lunch hour was up, he and Harry both jumped, having not thought that much time had passed.
Draco waved a hand. “No, no, we were horrible to our elves. Mother saw them as servants, father treated them as less than human, and I grew up thinking that was normal. I shudder to look back on it, now, but I’m not going to shy away from admitting we were shit.” He shrugged, left hand twitching to make sure he shirt sleeve was still down.
Draco paled, reaching over to clasp is left arm where the pale pink remnants of his Mark still existed. “Evan Rosier’s nephew, correct?”
“I honestly don’t know that he’s ever spoken to me, so that’s not too hard.” Harry looked at Draco, tie discarded, shirt unbuttoned the top few, sweat making it cling to the narrow planes of his chest, his pulse pounding against the hollow of his throat. Harry wondered what that hollow would taste like. If he’d be able to feel Draco’s pulse against his tongue. He cleared his throat as he realized he was starring, turning to look back where Lee and Alicia were still chatting. “So, yeah.”
He wondered briefly if he should do something other than sit at home and drink, be more proactive than wallowing in his own self-pity, but it was a Thursday and he’d been splashed with cold water on his way to work and yelled at by a father for not making sure some new broom toy was available on time, as if he had any control over that, so he thought some wallowing was due. He’d worry about the adult way to handle holiday loneliness tomorrow.
“Liar. Come on. I’m starved, and this place is great. Plus, we’ve only got about fifteen minutes before Hermione starts ranting about work again.”
He nodded, taking a sip of tea. “I did. Horace finished up the last school term and is taking the summer to find and move into a new place. I’ll start moving my things in August, make sure I have all I need for my lesson plans.”
“I’ll be okay.” Draco turned and headed for the stairs, arms crossed tightly across his stomach. He stopped just before he reached them. “Just, maybe don’t take too long?”
“I swear, I was just as shocked as everyone else when I spoke Parseltongue. I didn’t even know it was a thing until Hermione explained. Of course, there’s a lot of things I didn’t know until Hermione explained them”
“Up-upstairs.” Draco yanked at Harry’s faded Canons t-shirt, pulling it over his head so that he could run his hands over his body, whimpering at the sight of tawny skin and defined muscled covered in a dusting of curled dark hair.
“Kind of. Frustrating. We almost fucked up a really important case, and just.” He sighed, squeezing. “Thank you.”
Grinch came back as Harry locked up. No note. Harry just laughed again, petting the little bird and heading home. He was disappointed that he didn’t see Draco on his way out.
Harry hadn’t slept well. He’d spent most of the night tossing and turning, wondering who was writing to him.
A second brow joined the first, Malfoy’s lips lifting as he brows did. “That so? I’m in the midst of a project that I needed to check on.” He reached up to pet Grinch, gently rubbing the backs of his fingers over the little owl’s chest, his fingertips ghosting lightly over Harry’s cheek as he did. The little owl preened and fluffed, and Harry felt like he did the same, chills running down his arms at the brief touch, static filling his ears.
Draco’s vision blurred as he realized this was a list of the times he’d been with Harry. He heard the crash of his cup slipping from his fingers and onto the floor. Heard a shout and the sound of feet running, looking up to see Harry stumble to a stop just inside the room.
They road to the atrium in silence, but not the awkward silence of two men who couldn’t speak to one another, as Harry would have expected. More the comfortable silence of two people who understand that both need a little calm at the end of the day.
Harry grinned. “So, I can hold your hand after we arrive and stuff? Are you okay with that kind of PDA?”
The next Saturday, Draco got off work just as Harry was going to lunch. Harry smiled as he Draco poked his head into his office.
Potter’s face lit up at the mention of his prize, but he shook his head, “If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. I mean, if you’re not flying anymore.”
Draco’s knees gave out and he sagged into Harry’s hold, their lips clashing again. Harry gripped one of Draco’s thighs, hiking it up around his waist and rocking them together. In response, Draco mewled and dug his nails into Harry’s shoulders, head falling back against the wall with a thud.
Draco smiled and kissed Harry’s cheek. “I don’t think it’s difficult to date you at all. And I’m not out to my parents, but I’m not exactly closeted. My friends know. Your friends know. Your godfathers know.” He frowned and squeezed Harry’s hand. “I’m not trying to hide us, or you, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
If Ron was surprised to be addressed by Draco Malfoy, he hid it well. “We’re good. Louder than ever with all the kids running around, now.”
Harry gripped Draco’s hips, lips slanting over his on a broken moan, and Draco knew he hadn’t imagined anything. They were just as hot, just as fast.
The darker-haired man grinned, winked, “New Auror classification system. Waffle guys are good guys.”
Harry nodded, lifting his hand and kissing his fingers. “No problem. I’ll ask tomorrow, set up a day.”
Harry starred at the other man, shuddering, having not realized how much he wanted someone to speak to when his days were like this. “Someone almost fucked up the Rosier case.”
Draco never looked up from where he was clearing up his trash. “I’m off tomorrow.” Harry wondered if he’d somehow been wrong about the signs when he continued. “You could come by mine, though. After work. I mean, I sort of owe you dinner, right?”
Draco’s smirk became a full grin, and he nodded. “Remus has the better selection of indie bands, but Sirius’s first editions are to die for.”
“You love me?” His voice did break, but he didn’t care. He wasn’t shattering. He was thawing. The breaking was just the ice he’d encased himself in to survive the last few weeks.
Sirius merely grimaced and nodded, struggling to cover the portrait again. “Bellatrix sounded just like good old mum.”
All those years, Harry had hated Draco for having what he didn’t, for having the parents and the house and the gifts. He’d seen how Lucius had bought brooms to get his son of the quidditch team, how Narcissa had sent treats every week. Comparing that to the Dursley’s denying Harry’s existence when it suited them and ignoring him the rest of the time, Malfoy seemed to have a charmed life. He supposed there was more than one way to make someone feel like a burden rather than a child, though.
While Harry understood that lilies were his mother and that red roses meant love, the other two, especially he ones he couldn’t identify, confused him. He knew they must mean something, his admirer had yet to do anything without careful thought and planning. Flowers had always been Neville’s thing, though, and this wasn’t something he wanted to share yet, even with a good friend.
Moreover… “Is that my shirt?” Draco wasn’t sure if he’d meant to ask that question, but he suddenly realized that Harry was wearing the same grey button-up he’d left when he’d apparated away over his tee.
They were both laughing and covered in snow, Harry taking longer than normal with making snowballs to give Teddy a more even chance, when he heard Teddy yell.
Tugging Draco against his chest, Harry nuzzled his hair, kissing him. He started to reach for the other man’s fly, but Draco stopped him.
Ron laughed and nudged him. “I know what you meant. I’ll ask the others, but Harry and Ginny get a bit overzealous.”
Harry snorted with laughter at Draco’s deadpan, looking over to catch the other man grinning back at him. He bumped their shoulders. “Come on. Let’s pick our gifts. Are you on lunch or off for the day?”
They spent most of the afternoon at the Burrow, sitting in front of the fire and telling Draco stories of the trouble they all got into as kids.
Draco had been taught loyalty his entire life. Loyalty to family and the family’s name and reputation. Loyalty to their beliefs and status. To their slurs and prejudice. Then, when his family’s lives were threatened, he was taught loyalty to the Dark Lord. Had it instilled into the marrow of his bones through hours of the Cruciatus Curse mingled with Aunt Bella picking through his mind, all while his mother and godfather stood and watched. He’d learned to nod and agree and repeat what was said to him and stop throwing up while watching others be tortured before him.
Harry kissed his way up Draco’s body as the blond man collapsed against the bed, panting for breath. His engorged shaft pressed against Draco’s hip, so he reached down, wrapping his hand around that thickness, thumb rolling over the head. Harry groaned and thrust against Draco’s fist, and he twisted his wrist every time the other man’s hips pulled back. With a moan, their lips met messily, sweaty bodies undulating into one another.
Remus heard the break in Sirius’s voice and tugged him up into a hug. They’d talked about how hard Azkaban had been. How Sirius’s guilt had caused him to feel responsible for their friends’ deaths, for losing time with Remus. He’d accepted the sentencing because he didn’t think Remus or Harry would ever be able to forgive him for failing to protect James and Lily. However, his memories of them all and his hope that they were happy had been what kept him going. Both men still carried more guilt than either could truly vocalize.
Harry leaned in, nodding his head to draw Draco forward, and the blond barely thought before leaning in, too excited about being let into one of Potter’s secret conspiracies. Almost like they were really friends meeting for food on purpose. “Cast iron skillet, turn it way more than you think you need to, and pull it off when it looks just dark enough but still feels to soft. It’ll firm up while it drains.” Harry leaned back. “I also like to sprinkle it with a bit of seasoning at that point, too. Sort of let it absorb and drain and harden up.”
“I love you.” Harry pulled Draco close, kissing him briefly. “God, I’m so in love with you. And I’m so sorry. I’ll never do anything like this again. I swear.”
“There’s another letter, Uncle Harry!” Teddy climbed up at the table and pulled the letter over, opening it. “It says we need to write a letter to Santa and make milk and cookies to leave for him.”
This chapter is also a bit short, so I'd normally have combined this one and the previous. I wanted to keep the two separate because of following different POVs. Hope no one is too angry at the shorter length!!
Narcissa placed a hand on her husband, as if to restrain him. “We thought you dated that Parkinson girl in school? And the older Greengrass daughter?”
Draco flushed, gaze darting to the two older men who both grinned as they watched them, and muttered, “Wish you’d thought that in school.”
Draco choked on a bit of tea at the words ‘harden up,’ quickly wiping his face and nodding along. “I’ll have to try that. In the morning. The technique I mean.” Draco felt how flushed his face had become, silently cursing his fair complexion. The waitress returned with his food, however, and he focused on thanking her and setting up his utensils.
Potter was still as nimble on a broom as he’d been during their school days. While he was broader, now, his lower center of gravity seemed to allow him to mesh with his broom, the two moving as one. Draco had hoped his long, lean frame would give him a speed advantage, but alas, he was wrong. Dead wrong. They ended up playing three seeker’s games, and he lost each one spectacularly, huffing and puffing by the end of the third. Apparently, having barely been on a broom since fifth year actually put him at a disadvantage.
“Come on in. Dibby is just finishing dinner. I got caught up in work, so I asked if she wouldn’t mind.”
“Draco, no.” He reached over, taking the blond’s hand. “You’re welcome anywhere I am. And if you’re not welcome, then, neither am I. If you want to come, you can. It’ll be fine.”
Wiping his eyes, he read the letter again. He didn’t deserve Harry’s love, didn’t deserve to belong to someone so wonderful, but somehow, it seemed that he did.
The entire house roared with laughter, even Harry. Ginny bounced over to fall in his lap and hug him, and he squeezed her. “I hate you.”
Draco shuddered as he watched Harry unbutton his jeans before crawling across the bed and over him. “I’ve been sleeping in your clothes, but they don’t smell like you anymore.”
Upon check out, Harry got another package of socks, and he did a quick inventory. “Yeah, that’s seven.” Opening the package, he laughed when he saw the potions-themed socks. “Perfect for opening with you, huh?”
Draco stepped back, shaking his head. “No. I’ve already been away longer than I intended.” He nodded a bit stiffly at everyone and turned to leave.
Harry chewed his lip, leaning back in his chair and adding this note to everything else he’d learned about his admirer. “Grinch. Note?” The owl looked up from where he was pecking at this food, quickly flying over as Harry scribbled a note, asking what position the other man played. The response came quickly.
“I love you, too.” Draco’s voice broke on a whine, and he arched, squeezing around Harry’s fingers. “Please, Harry.”
They continued to joke back and forth until the game started. The Bats had the better defense; their Beaters moved almost as quickly as the Chasers, blocking bludgers with machine precision, and their Keeper was a brick wall. The Arrows had the better Seeker, though. Best in the league.
As it became known that he had honestly changed and was truly trying to help, he’d been contacted by his cousin, Sirius Black, and the two championed the fight for werewolves to be treated as equals, arguing that their mistreatment and lack of resources was often what caused them to engage in crime. St. Mungo’s now housed the RJ Lupin Ward, where lycanthropes could go to get Wolfsbane and rest safely during the full moons. It was also working toward more innovation in potions to help with management of the condition.
The rest of the night went smoothly, with them eating and then working on a puzzle until Andromeda arrived to get Teddy. If she seemed surprised to find Draco there, as well, she didn’t show it, simply reminded both men they were invited to Christmas dinner.
Smiling, Draco carded his fingers through Harry’s hair, scratching gently and sending chills down his spine. “Should have known you’d understand. I have to get ready for work. I, uh, I have time for breakfast, though. If you’d like?”
Harry laughed, asking about Draco’s day, what was planned. He wasn’t due in for another couple hours, but that would give him time to go home, shower, and change.
Hermione nodded, digging through her bag for a notebook to scribble a note to herself. “I’ll look into him. Thank you. I’m guessing I’ve got your support, too, since you’re who funded the bill’s start?”
Nott scoffed and walked away, broom over his shoulder. Draco glared at him, kicking the heel of one shoe against the ground. “Ignore him.”
Draco swallowed and nodded. “Waffles.” Harry laughed, nodding politely to the waitress who brought Draco his usual cup of earl grey, asking if he wanted his usual breakfast. “Um, no. I, uh, I’d like to try your…the waffles?” Harry laughed harder as Draco asked more than stated his order, handing over a menu opened to the waffle page. Everything sounded very sweet, but he pointed. “The rhubarb and custard waffles. Please. Side of bacon.”
Harry had spent his lunch hour at his desk, writing and revising more letters than he cared to admit, trying to figure out what he should ask that would let him learn about who was writing him without forcing the other man’s hand. Finally, he sent Grinch off again.
“I mean, if I don’t, my parents will ask questions about where I am.” He felt Harry tense next to him. “I don’t want to hide us. Remember?” He kissed Harry then huffed, annoyed with himself. “I just need to figure out how to tell them.” He sighed, eyes burning. “You’d think I’d have this planned already, with how many years I’ve been hiding.”
Harry’s shoulders relaxed and smiled. “That sounds great.” He tossed his trash into the can and waved his hand, unlocking the door and letting it open. When Draco’s breath hitched, his smiled widened. “Oh, by the way, do you know a way to get rid of Furnunculus when Finite Incantatem and the usual creams won’t work? Apparently, Oliver annoyed someone who can create super solutions.” Draco’s eyes rounded, face suddenly paler than normal. “Let me know if you do. I’ll pass it on. See you tomorrow night.” Grinning, Harry waved and headed home.
The tree man walked up then, motioning to the living room where the tree was up, and several boxes were scattered around it. “All done. Rest is up to you. Happy Christmas.” He pretended to tip a hat and walked off. Harry followed him out just in time to see the decorators leave. Turning back, he saw his house decorated in more Christmas lights that he thought existed in all of England. There were also inflatable reindeer and a Santa. A snowman, a set of angels, and a Grinch. Laughing, Harry shook his.
He spent his morning in and out of the office, accompanying small groups of Aurors to various stores on Diagon and Knockturn Alley in order to calm angry groups of parents who had attempted to purchase their children gifts, not always through legal channels, that had yet to arrive. By lunch, he’d been punched in the side of the head and had two Stinging Hexes sent at his back for telling people they were not allowed to duel shopkeepers for not having the correct lifelike baby doll.
Harry grinned, his head cocked to the side and a thick lock of sweaty hair falling in his face as he looked up at Draco. “Yeah. You did.”
Harry’s head snapped around, but he kept his hold on Draco when the other man tried to jerk away. Teddy stood in the door, fidgeting.  “Yeah, kiddo. It should be done. Did you wash your hands?” He nodded, and Harry released one of Draco’s arms, letting the other linger long enough to squeeze lightly. “Great. You and Draco go ahead and sit then. I’ll get it out and refill our glasses.”
Remus laughed and cried at the same time, nodding. “I’d have said yes then. I’d have said yes when we first met back up. I’ll say yes until the day we die.”
“No.” Harry wrapped his arms around him, tweaking his nipples and making him cry out. “But I plan on trying out some Slytherin silver on every flat surface in here.”
Their lips met, heat blooming. Draco pulled his wand out to wave it at the kitchen while muttering a stasis charm before pushing Harry toward the bedroom. Harry kissed Draco again, fingers working at the buttons of his shirt, pausing as Draco tumbled backward onto the bed. Kneeling on the bed, he finished removing the shirt, lips trailing over Draco’s throat, chest, down his stomach.
Harry looked up as Ron shrugged and walked inside, Cho coming over to meet him. “Are you coming to tell me it’s okay for me to date Draco, too?”
“He lets me borrow those.” Every bit of old Malfoy pride and glee was back in Draco’s voice at once again having something to hold over Harry, but there was no malice this time. Only pride that he was allowed something so sacred, something precious to Harry’s inner sanctum. “I currently have Queen’s debut at my place. They one autographed by Freddie himself.”
He found the blond man leaned over a cauldron the was billowing thick green and purple smoke and making the entire room smell like old cabbage and lavender.
Molly seemed to fall over herself to hug Draco just as tightly as Hermione had outside. “Oh, goodness. You’re too thin. Harry, have you not been feeding him?”
Draco flushed, scowling and crossing his arms. “You did, but that doesn’t mean you’ve asked me on a date.”
Remus merely raised a brow over his shoulder, still moving toward the kitchen. In seconds, Sirius was whining again and following the other man.
The tiny bird bounced around Harry’s desk, nudging at everything, then flew over to a filing cabinet and did the same. Like he was learning the office. Like he wanted to learn it. Like he wanted to be so good at whatever Harry might ask of him.
Sirius sat up and cupped his boyfriend’s face, kissing along his jaw. “Hey. It’s okay. It was a scary time, and we were so young. We both made mistakes, both tried to do what was best for everyone else because we didn’t think we deserved what we had.” He smiled as Remus lifted his head, eyes watering. “I’ve never blamed you. I promise.”
Harry kissed him again, the press of lips growing heated for a moment. “Okay. I have to go, or I’ll be late, and you’re worth it, but then I’d be kept late.” His words were murmured against Draco’s lips, more small kisses between each muttered statement.
Harry grinned, his own cheeks seeming to pinken, though Draco was sure that just his imagination. “I’m glad.” He wrapped his arm around Draco and hugged him against his side as they walked. “I’ll let them know for next weekend.”
“I don’t doubt that.” There was a moment of tension, the others obviously worried Draco would fall back on snide comments. He’d been turning a slow circle, taking everything in, but as he finished the move, he faced Molly with a wide grin. “It feels like a real home. Why would you change that?”
Calling for Grinch, Harry scrawled a note to Gringotts, sending 2,000 galleons each to Dragon Defense and Protection Foundation in Hagrid’s name, Werewolf Aid, Support, and Protection for Lavender, Wizarding War Memorial for Colin, Wizarding Pride Project for Dumbledore, and Quidditch for Healing Foundation for Regulus before finishing getting ready for work.
Their lunch continued with quiet conversation about their time at Hogwarts and growing up, hands brushing throughout, feet and knees pressed together under the table.
Draco smiled at how uncomfortable Harry looked. Biting his lip, he reached over and took his hand. “Well, if we’ve been dating a couple months, then, would you like to go an actual date this weekend?”
Harry smiled and took a step forward. “So did Sirius and Remus. They all like you, Draco. Really like you. They didn’t fake any of it.”
Eventually, the two woke again, lounging wrapped up in each other until Harry’s stomach growled loudly. Laughing, they finally made it out of bed and down to the kitchen for tea and toast, trading kisses as they talked.
“I don’t care. You look hot in it, and I’m sure Molly will appreciate you not dressing like a hooligan.”
A few days after accepting his position at Hogwarts, Draco sat at the small Indian restaurant down the street from his flat. It was owned and run by muggles, but that meant he didn’t have to worry about anyone spitting in his food or on him. Though he’d worked hard to rebuild his reputation and the expectations of his family, apparently, it took more than seven years to repair generations of damage. He might not like it, but he understood. The bell over the door jingled, and he looked up to see an all-too-familiar mess of black hair enter. Before he could figure out how to hide under is table without being obvious, Potter was at his table, smiling.
Harry was grinning by the time he finished the note, both at how this person found a new way to show how well he knew him each day and at having another treat to look forward to. Well, seven treats, really.  Harry double checked his shopping list as he finished his ice cream before heading out to Gringotts and then Flourish and Blotts for Hermione’s gift. While there, he was given a second package with more socks, these decorated in various magical creatures, like hippogriffs, thestrals, and nifflers. Next was Twilfitt and Tattings for both Andromeda and Molly and his third pair of socks, these with snitches all over them. At Quality Quidditch Supplies, he picked up Ron’s gift and a pair of socks with Ford Angelia’s all over them, making him laugh hard enough several patrons turned to look at him. The socks at Eyelop’s Owl Emporium, because Grinch needed a gift just as much as anyone else, he had socks with mermaids and dragons. And at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, the socks had fireworks. However, when he popped into the Apothecary store, there was no package.
Molly didn’t even flinch. “Sweetheart, we didn’t mind one bit that Percy brought a him home or Ginny a her, and it doesn’t bother us that Charlie has not interest in bringing anyone but dragons. Besides, I know more than you think. If you like this young man, I trust your judgement. Why not bring him over that first weekend of January, start the year off right?”
Fifth came another package. Unwrapping it, Draco gasped as soft, dark rose sweater unfolded, note tucked inside.
Not liking that in the slightest, Harry shifted, bumping Draco again. “Last night was fun, by the way. We should do it again sometime.” It felt like the air was sucked out of the elevator, and Draco said nothing, a muscle jumping in his jaw. Grinch hooted and hopped over to Draco’s shoulder. “I know Teddy enjoyed it, too, and we are all family. Maybe we could do something else with him before Christmas. Oh, you were right, by the way. They were larkspur. Turns out, it’s the flower of my birthday month. Sunflowers are for Leos, too.”
“You should come play. Help us put this one’s ego back in it’s place.” He shoved Harry in the side of the head, and Harry elbowed him, the two quickly dissolving into a wrestling match.
“Come along, then.” Both Harry and Draco started as Ron spoke, but he simply shrugged and kept talking. “We’re just going to the taco truck downstairs, since I’ve gotta meet ‘Mione for doctor’s appointment.”
“No, no, that’s exactly why.” Draco nodded, motioning to himself. “His family went to pot after his father’s death during the first war. It was just him and his mother, who didn’t support the whole pureblood thing as it turned out she wasn’t actually one herself. Hidden affair led to her being half-blood, you see. Anyways, Voldemort turned on them, and they lacked the money necessary to rebuild their reputation. He’s managed to work his way up in the Ministry, though, and if you gave him a chance to put his name on something so big, especially when that connects him to your name.” Draco shrugged. “Slytherin’s know a good thing, know what will get them ahead, but we’re also willing to put in work to achieve our goals.”
Harry hugged Draco tighter, thinking back to the insane mess of his office versus the boy who never had a hair out of place or wore anything but the best. “Well, we could get a gnome.”
He’d also distanced himself because of that. From the Weasleys, afraid they would only see the empty space at the table. From Andromeda and Teddy, worried he would just be a reminder of the child and parents that weren’t there. From his friends, scared seeing him would just bring flashbacks of flying curses and cold tents.
“I joined the Inquisition Squad because I was a prat. That’s all there is to that. I wanted to get under your skin.”
“For about five minutes, actually.” Ron laughed and handed him his takeout container. “You like this person, huh?” He cleared his throat. “You know, you can tell me, tell all of us, who it, who he, is. We won’t judge or anything.”
Ron tapped Draco’s arm with the back of one hand, wiping tears of mirth from his eyes with the other. “We’re going to play some quidditch with Bones, Terry Boot, Michael Corner, Alicia, Lee, and Davies. George is thinking of coming, but he needed to check with Ang, first.” He shrugged, “Apparently, it’s not so nice to leave your spouse home with a new baby without warning.”
Laughing harder, Harry bumped his shoulder into Draco’s as the entered the lift, it packed at this time so the ended up squeezed together to one side. “I won’t argue that. I’m keeping at least one coffee shop in business.”
Still yelling, Molly pulled her into a hug, dancing them in a circle. George smacked Ron on the back, grinning. “You old dog, you. I knew you had that cat with the cream look, lately.” Ron’s face was darker than his hair, but he nodded.
Lunch started once the first batch were in the oven, Molly piling Draco’s plate high like she did Harry’s that first summer he was over. Hermione continued discussing her plan, and Draco made several comments about who she could speak to in order to strengthen her backing.
Harry coughed hard, the sound echoing like a sob, and clamped a hand over his mouth. He’d forgotten that want to prove himself. After years and years of being forced to, being asked to save the god-damned world, over and over again, he’d forgotten what it was like to just
“Any time. And I really am glad you’re happy again. I know how hard Cedric’s death hit you, both of us.” Harry shrugged, smirking. “I’m pretty sure he’s how I figured out I liked guys and girls.”
“I’m mad because one drooled all over half my face in an attempt to do just that,” he muttered, shaking his head, but she just laughed harder and walked off.  Harry lifted the edge of his robe to scrub at his face once more, as he unlocked his door. Ron had offered to bring over chicken masala and naan for lunch, and Harry wanted to straighten up after Grinch before he arrived. The little bird was always getting into things, strewing quills across the floor, batting around pieces of paper. Honestly, it was like having a cat with wings most days.
Harry nodded jerkily. “Thank you, baby. Are you okay going upstairs while I put everything up, or would you rather us go together?”
Finally, Draco’s body quit shaking, and his breathing evened out. He mumbled, “Thank you for understanding, Harry.”
Draco sneered back, “Maybe if you’d spend more time looking out for the Quaffle instead of staring at my ass, the whole team wouldn’t have to depend on me catching the snitch to win.” He waited until the other man made eye contact and winked. “I know I’ve got that skinny boy physique you like so much.”
Hermione spun around, and Draco yelped and ducked behind Harry. “Look, unless you’re the one close enough for her to hit, shut up.” Harry rolled his eyes but grinned, noting that Hermione absolutely glowed at the praise for thirteen-year-old-hers swing. “And honestly, I believe her. It’s her body that’s growing the baby, and women’s bodies have all sorts of crazy intuition about that sort of thing. Why can’t she know what she’s having?”
Harry set the book aside, summoning tissues and making himself a pot of tea. He wiped his eyes and sat back down, flipping a page. There were several pictures of the marauders throughout their Hogwarts years, and as McGonagall had said, Sirius was far less confident at first. His hair was shorter, clothes always neat and orderly, and he never smiled. Soon, his grins rivaled his father’s, uniform became less tidy, and his hair steadily grew longer. There were also several pictures of his father and Sirius in their quidditch gear.
“No, no. Let me finish. I’m pretty sure Draco is why you’ve been happier, and I want you to know that that’s okay. Not as in I get to decide what’s okay for you and what’s not, but I don’t want you to think you need to hide it or him because of us or from us. I want you to be happy, we all do, and if Draco makes you happy, be happy.” He shrugged, smiling. “You’re my best mate, another brother. You’re our family, and if you like him, we’ll give him a shot. Besides, he seems like an okay sort of prat, nowadays.”
Harry smiled and kissed Draco, fingers tangling through his hair. “Mmm, boyfriend, huh?” Draco blushed at the slip, knowing they hadn’t talked about labels, but Harry just waggled his brows. “I like the sound of that.”
Harry stepped closer to him, arms around his waist. “That moving potato thing?” Draco nodded. “That’s a gnome.”
An hour later, most of Harry’s house looked like a Christmas catalogue had thrown up before being buffeted by a tornado, but Teddy was pretty proud of what they’d accomplished.  The gingerbread was also done, and that scent of that sweet, spicy cookie made everyone join together in the kitchen.
“Enough!” Harry’s face was bright red, and he fidgeted in place. “I guess some stuff slipped my mind, okay. I’ve just been enjoying us being together.”
Harry nodded, “I’ll be at work part of Christmas, too, but you got for me. We should go get him, Draco, a gift, then. Before we go home.”
Hands shaking, Harry set the letter aside, looking at the second sheet of enclosed paper. It was official letter explain that the star at the listed coordinates was officially named Potter. He didn’t realize he was moving, just heard the crack of apparition and found himself in Draco’s lobby. Forgoing the elevator, he took the stairs two at a time, jogging down the hall and banging on the door, panting for breath.
“All right, all right. I’ll read it. But then, you and this.” He waved his hand. “This tree thing are going home. Wherever that might be.”
Harry flushed and nodded, tossing the green shirt aside and pulling on the tee then Sirius’s old leather jacket. “So, I kind of wondered. Well. I wanted to meet here to talk about.” Harry sighed then sucked in a breath. “I know dating me means getting swept up by my chaos and people following and staring and wanting pictures and stuff, and I wondered if you were okay with that? I mean, if we go out today and act like we’re going out. Hell, we’re going to have people talking if we go out as friends, I know that, and I’m sorry if it bothers you, but if we act like we’re dating, they’re going to say even more.” He ran his hands through his hair. “I’m happy to be dating, and I’d gladly tell the world that I’m dating you, but if you’re not comfortable with that kind of attention…” He trailed off as he noticed Draco’s cheeks turning brighter as he started to smile.
“Oh god.” Draco shuddered, body pliant as Harry turned him, nudging him back onto the soft bed. “Strip.”
He started laughing, doubling over as his laughter turned to tears. He’d known Potter, or Harry, now, as he demanded, would figure it out. Even as Draco had lied to himself that he would be able to pull this off without being found out, he’d known Harry would figure him out, known had figured him out days ago. He supposed he wanted to be found out, though. He’d been nursing this crush, this love, this want for so long, he was ready to see what happened. He’d never allowed himself to imagine this would be the result. That his gifts would become dinners and kisses and nights in each other’s arms, that he’d know what Harry sounded like as he came. He could still taste him when he closed his eyes and focused.
Harry laughed and shook his head. “No, but it does limit how high the flyer can go.” Draco nodded in approval before getting the correlating cleaning and storage kits, the two heading up front to check out. “Since you’re on your lunch break, did you want to get food together?”
Though Harry had agreed to keep the little bird, if you can call not arguing with a letter agreeing, he hadn’t been able to bring the bird home. Instead, he’d sent his assistant to the pet shop for a cage, stand, supplies and seed, and had set Grinch up with a little home and all the necessities at the office. He’d refused to make eye contact with those big golden orbs while he readied himself to go home late that night, but the tiny whoo as he’d opened the door had stopped him.
The next letter arrived as they were finalizing the sticking charms to put up the last of the stockings.
Draco’s keening cry went straight to Harry’s dick, and he struggled to catch his breath as he fought cumming just at the sound. Tightening his hand, he rolled his hand over the heads of their lengths, squeezing the way he’d learned Draco liked. Draco’s breathing turned choppy, hips thrusting against Harry’s, and he leaned back, arching his body to press closer, move harder.
Nodding, she dragged him back toward the house. Dinner was even louder than usual, the puppy barking and circling everyone’s feet, kids chasing after him to play. The food was even better than Harry remembered, and George managed to sneak three different Wheezes into everything. Once everyone was so full they could barely move, they all moved to the living room to pass out gifts.
An hour later, Teddy was worn out and tucked into bed, two Christmas stories read, and Harry was on his way back to the office. Draco was in a different set of clothing, his hair wet, and a healed cut over his left eye.
“No, had.” Cho giggled and set down what she was holding, a fluffy black puppy with giant paws stumbling into the living room. “His name is Hairy Pupper.”
Harry was still grinning when he arrived home to find lunch waiting. Steak and kidney pie, his favorite, and treacle tart pudding for dessert. Grinch circled the house, exploring every nook and cranny as Harry ate, then followed him around as he set up the stand and showed Grinch where to sleep. His bird’s unending energy levels reminded him of his godson, and Harry quickly floo-called Andromeda, asking if he could collect Teddy the next day.
Harry nodded again, studying the purplish shadows under Draco’s eyes that proved he was tired, even if he hadn’t said it. Smiling, he leaned forward and brushed his lips over Draco’s cheek. “Thank you for tonight. For everything. I’ll owl you tomorrow?”
The owl hooted and flew a circle around the office, reminding him of Pigwidgeon back when he first arrived. Harry smiled without meaning to and opened the letter, spelling it to its correct size and adjust the thing metal frames on his face.
Harry pointed at the bottom. “Maybe the, uh, thingie? Whatever that is that it’s standing in. Maybe that’s off?”
Draco entered Gimmauld Place just behind Harry. The sitting room was empty, but they could hear a tea kettle whistling in the kitchen and a voice called out, “We’re in here.”
They linked arms and side-alonged to their assigned check point. The crowd went a bit quiet as they arrived, and Harry felt Draco stiffen. He grabbed his hand and smiled, “Come on. I want snacks.”
Harry’s fingers yanked harder on his hair, and he nodded, mouth curving downward. “Yeah. I was afraid you wouldn’t get a fair shake from some of the others, and I didn’t like the idea of you having this taken away from you over what you did as a kid.” He sighed and dropped his hands, sliding them into his pockets. “That wasn’t the right thing to say, was it?”
Teddy squealed as he saw Grinch, darting over to look at the little owl, and Andromeda stepped in to give Harry a hug. “It’s not problem. It gives me some time to do a little last-minute shopping and wrapping.”
“It was exceedingly lonely to be Draco Malfoy. Everyone was supposed to be pawn, someone to use. Makes it a bit hard to have true friends and people you can trust.”
“I-I think I need to go home. I just. I think I need to go home.” Harry took a step forward, but Draco stepped back, holding his hand up. “I’m not mad at you. I just. I don’t know.”
Draco laughed and pushed him back. “No being late tonight. I don’t give a damn if you annoy Robards.”
“It’s a hard to fix someone’s trust when you break it. James was angry with me for a long time after what I did, even though I’d never actually meant for anyone to get hurt. I ran my mouth out of anger, not thinking Sniv—Severus would take me seriously, but I almost got someone killed. Worse, almost got someone killed by the person I loved most in the world and by betraying their biggest secret.” He paused, guilt laced thickly through his voice. Remus stepped up and ran his fingers through Sirius’s hair, and after a moment, he was able to continue. “I know you’re upset, you feel bad. But Draco fell in love with you, and before you start trying to explain away hurting him, you’ve got to realize that kind of love is different. It’s leads to a different kind of pain and needs a different kind of understanding. Apologizing for hurting someone who loves you.” Sirius audibly swallowed. “If you don’t feel the same, it’s not right for you to force him to see you again, not when there are other ways to go about this.”
Harry cupped Draco’s face and kissed him, stopping the negative train of thought. “I don’t like it either. Haven’t since before I even went to Hogwarts. I listen to classic rock to wake me up. Queen’s ‘I Want to Break Free.’ It was Sirius’s favorite.”
It hadn’t been so hard at Hogwarts, with Ron and his yearly Weasley jumper, and he still spent Christmas Eve at the Burrow, still got a yearly jumper. But since their school days, his friends had mostly settled down, built families of their own to spend the actual holiday with, and he either had to intrude on that or spend Christmas alone. Hermione and Mrs. Weasley both claimed his as part of the family, as did Andromeda and Teddy, but he still felt like he was slotting himself into someone else’s celebrations. He’d taken to working through the actual day of Christmas in order to keep from facing that, but this year, he only worked a half day. Which meant half of Christmas Day alone. In Gimmauld Place. With no decorations and no carols. No cheer. No Who-Roast-Beast. Just him and some Firewhiskey.
Harry’s hands were calloused, rough, the nails short and blunt, and he touched every bit of Draco with them, scrapping in a way that contrasted the hot, smooth bob of his head as he sucked Draco deeper into his mouth. Then, those fingers slide down Draco’s cleft, swirled over his hole, and he whined, body clenching. Harry just continued to rub, though, teasing. Draco’s hips bucked upward, whines turning to cries with each roll of his body. Harry suddenly pressed his thumb to that spot just behind Draco’s balls and used his other hand to tug them.
“Come on. You head upstairs and wash your face. There’s a headache potion in the cabinet if you need it. I’ll put everything up and meet you there.”
“Yes.” Putting away the box and tugging Harry closer, Draco crashed their lips together, hands sliding under his shirt to flatten against his back.
“Draco, Santa isn’t real. At least not for muggles. I’m sure there’s a wizard somewhere that crawled up and down chimneys passing out gifts.”
Harry had sent owls, come to his flat, even reached out to Minerva. He didn’t want excuses, though. Didn’t want apologies, even if they were honest, because that wouldn’t undo the damage. He’d lost the last tie to his family, lost friends that he wasn’t even sure he’d ever actually had, lost his heart. Just how much of this last summer had been a lie? Draco blew out a long breath and scrubbed his hands through his hair, letting his head hang.
Draco smirked over his shoulder. “I am excellent at everything to which I apply myself.” Harry choked on his next sip, and Draco chuckled. “The spaghetti bolognese is done. I’m putting the garlic bread in, now. It doesn’t have the same crisp when left under a stasis charm.”
Hands shaking, he sat on the plush couch that took up most of the living area of his flat and stared at the letting that his owl had just brought him. Snitch perched just behind Draco’s shoulder, the golden barn owl surprisingly quiet instead of demanding treats, as if she realized her owner’s emotional state. He hadn’t been this nervous since the trails after the war ended.
Harry had laughed at that, gaze running down Draco’s frame. “I don’t think you need to worry. You seem pretty naturally lean. You could always start joining us for pick up quidditch games, if you want.” He grinned, leaning closer to Draco. “And if you think you can still keep up with me.”
“What did you call me?” Harry hadn’t known his voice could drop that low, take that tone, but he stopped moving both hands as he spoke, smiling when Draco keened again and full body undulated into him.
There was a heady beat of silence before Harry made a high-pitched sound of frustration. “Really? That’s it? I only had to ask?”
She moved forward, squeezed Draco’s arm, and honestly smiled at him for the first time. “Yeah, he was a dick about the whole thing. Harry doesn’t know how to hide his feelings, though. How to fake them. Harry’s always been one to rush headfirst into everything without thinking, but he can’t fake what he feels.” She shrugged and let go of Draco, kicking the dirt. “I was worried about you, what you felt, because I could see how hard he was falling for you. I didn’t want you to hurt him.”
Harry looked from Draco back to the bottle and laughed. “I knew you’d know what it was.” His grin widened when Draco blushed. “I honestly don’t know much about wine, but I liked it.” He shrugged. “I’m learning to enjoy things I like, share them with people I like, rather than.” He trailed off, looking around his house. “Well, rather than just being unhappy, I suppose.”
Draco flushed as he caught Harry’s eye, but not from pride or exertion this time. “I think I’m ready to join your friends, if you really think they’d be okay with me.”
Draco tried to smother his laughter, but he ended snorting and doubling over with it as Harry dropped his head to the table.
The rattling of the doors opening jarred Harry out of his musings, and he looked up to see Malfoy holding the door, gesturing for him to go first. Clearing his throat, Harry shoved his hands into his pockets and exited. He could feel the heat of Malfoy following as they crossed the atrium, still smell him, and he paused for a moment to breath deeply before reaching for his pinch of floo powder. Looking over as Malfoy stepped up to the next floo over, Harry took in the sharp lines of Malfoy’s nose and jaw, the shadow beneath his angular cheekbones, wondered if he’d grown into his own face quite so well and blushed, coughing again to hide his embarrassment at his own thoughts, even though no one else could possibly know what he’d just questioned. “Um, have a good, uh, a good night, Malfoy.”
“I swear, the day you told Snape not to call you sir. I’m pretty sure I gave myself a hernia trying not to laugh.”
Walking over, Harry hugged his boyfriend. “I love you.” He felt Draco freeze in his arms, and he nuzzled his temple. “You’re so amazing, and I’m so amazed that I get to be with you.” Stepping back, he cupped the blond’s face. “I love you.”
“You do that every time.” Draco paused and looked up. “You always thank the staff, even when they bring something for someone else. And you set up your fork and stuff all fancy-like.”
Harry was smiling when he arrived at work, and even though he was sent back out to the Alleys at least a dozen times throughout the day, working through his lunch break, he continued to smile. Furthermore, it seemed as if each of the scrimmages with angry parents and panicked shoppers seemed to go more smoothly, end with less fuss and fight.
Harry laughed and joined in, Teddy soon yell-singing along the handful of words he picked up on. Draco grimaced and teased them for not matching pitch and often being out-of-time with the tune. He learned the lyrics faster than Teddy, though, and he started whispering them to the little boy a line ahead to help him yell out more.
He could feel more tension in Draco’s body, knew this wasn’t something he’d done often, too nervous about letting people close considering his past. Smiling, Harry teased the head of Draco’s cock with his tongue, slowly sucking it into his mouth and taking more and more down as he started thrusting his finger deeper into Draco. When the tension melted into desire once again, Harry added a second finger, rubbing them over Draco’s prostate then scissoring to open him up. By the time Draco was back to murmuring a mixture of curse words and pleading, Harry was aching with want, but he carefully added a third finger first, wanting to make sure his boyfriend was fully prepped.
Draco looked thinner than Harry remembered, gaunt, but his pale hair gleamed in the soft light of his professor’s chambers as Harry stepped through the floo. Harry wanted to rush forward, hug, touch, assure himself that the other man was really near him again, but Sirius had warned him not to do that, to let Draco guide how they proceeded.
It was a beautifully delicate scarf in teal green with silver woven throughout. As he looked closely, though, he realized the silver was in the shape of a constellation. His constellation.
That day after work, Ron once again met Harry in his office. Unable to resist the pull of his new broom, Harry had sent out an interoffice memo setting up a pickup quidditch match. He and Ron were shoving each other back and forth, trash talking one another about how the game would go, when Draco stepped out of his office.
Okay, the semester has started, and it's HELLA crazy, so I'm ending this piece here. I have some others that I'm working on, though, and once I get a few chapters written and/or outlined, I'll start posting one of those. Thank you everyone for the sweet comments and kudos and reading!
Draco made a noise somewhere between a whine and a groan but nodded, putting his coat on. Once all three were ready, Harry picked up Teddy and stepped next to Draco, the two of them reaching out to take the portkey. With a squeeze and jerk from behind their navels, they found themselves in a snow-covered park next to a horse-drawn sleigh.
Harry dropped his bag next to the front door and toed off his shoes. “You know the house elves here by name?”
Stunned into action at the sight, Harry walked over and took the note from the little owl’s leg before thinking to check it or the rest of the situation for spells or curses.
“Always straight to the core of me. Always.” Draco kissed Harry, fingers running through his hair. “And if you’re falling, I’m here to catch.” He held his hand out, palm up, remembering sharply the first time he offered himself like this, laid himself bare to the possible derision of Potter.
Hermione’s eyes were full of tears, and Harry was stunned. To be living with Bellatrix and Voldemort but actively working against them like that. He hadn’t expected such a thing from younger Draco. Hell, he wasn’t sure he could have expected such a thing from most people at that age.
Draco tensed, all but snarling as his head snapped up. “I don’t want to hear that!” His voice cracked on that lie, and he flinched then started to walk back toward the castle.
He flicked his fingers, the snick of the door audible in the sudden quiet of the room. “And lock things.” Harry wouldn’t have noticed the faint tremor that ran though Draco had he not been watching him so closely, but satisfaction bloomed deep his belly, making him bite back a groan. “Tell me about this new project of yours. Is this the one you mentioned before? It’s ingenious.”
Harry carefully removed his finger and crawled over Draco, wiping his face before kissing him. “Are you sure?”
He rubbed the back of his neck, freckles standing out starkly against his skin. “Nothing is wrong. I just. Well, I wanted to talk to you alone for two minutes, and I figured while everyone was getting to the table was a good time.”
Draco shuddered, eyes rolling back and closing at Harry’s words. “Oh, gods.” No one had ever said such things to Draco before and to hear them in Harry’s voice, rough with desire. Draco was already harder than ever been before.
“I’ll fix that.” His lips found Draco’s, settling between his thighs. “I’ll make this whole room smell like me before I leave.”
Harry looked up as Draco entered, and Draco watched, fascinated, as his pupils expanded until the green almost disappeared. “I was wrong. It might be even sexier to see you in my clothes.”
Harry kept reading all night, not stopping until he’d gone through the book twice. It was only when the sun started to come up that he realized how long it had been. Clutching the book to his chest, he made his way upstairs to fall into bed and get a couple hours of sleep, still not letting go.
Draco’s entire body began to shake, and the same cold that he used to feel when the Dark Lord lived with them invaded his bones. The same fear. He struggled for a few minutes to remember how to take in a full breath, swallowing several times, but he raised his chin. “It is. I—I think I’m in love with him.” Draco suppressed the want to cower from his father’s cold stare. Though he knew his father’s weaknesses, he still longed for his love, his approval.
A buzzing sound mixed with the flutter of wings woke Harry the next morning, and he groaned, not wanting to wake up, having enjoyed his weekend too much to want it to be over. The buzzing backed away but didn’t stop. In fact, it seemed to be darting around his room. Frowning, he rolled over and cracked open his eyes. He couldn’t place the sound, though, not with it moving and his vision blurry. Reaching for his glasses, he suddenly placed the sound.
Reaching out, he cupped Draco’s face, leaning in to brush their noses together, giving Draco time to say no, then pressed their lips together. A light press, warmth of their breath mixing, hint of mint from where Draco had brushed his teeth before Harry came over. It was perfect. Draco’s lips melded just right against his, the catch his breath matching the hitch in Harry’s heartbeat.

Growling, Harry rose up, pressing Draco back into the couch cushions and deepening the kiss, tongue touching and tracing every bit of Draco’s mouth, like he was trying to commit him to memory. “Do you work tomorrow?”
Harry laughed until he couldn’t breathe, wishing Draco was here to be part of all this. When Molly slipped away to the kitchen to check on her pies, leaving Arthur to lead clean up, Harry followed. “Hey. I had a question.”
Hips jerking, Harry spilled down Draco’s throat with a long, low groan, shuddering as he felt Draco swallow every drop. He struggled to catch his breath, Draco buttoning him back up and standing, hands sliding over his chest, shoulders, arms.
Harry could have kissed Ron. He grinned at Draco instead. “Come on, Draco. Please?” Harry couldn’t be sure if it was Ron’s acceptance or his please, both of which seemed to render Draco speechless, but he nodded.
Faces still pressed close enough to breathe each other in, Harry rocked his hips into Draco, speeding his thrusts when Draco dug his nails into Harry’s back. He lifted his weight more fully onto his arms, angling his hips to hit that bundle of nerves inside Draco on each thrust, grinding his hips down when Draco cried out.
Draco’s jaw wobbled, and he nodded. “You did. And I didn’t want to push because I was afraid of what I might find out.”
“Very cottage style.” Harry frowned as he looked over at Draco who’d stepped away to peer over the wall. “There’s a tradition in English gardens to leave things a bit wilder, more dense and less ornate. Grace versus grandeur kind of thing. I’ve never seen one, though. Mother always liked pristine order and neatness. Oh! What’s that?”
Draco waved his wand, enclosing the cauldron in a bubble, and stepped back. “It’s sort of like an extra-strength dungbomb, but it’s meant to also fill the space with fumes that mimic the Swelling Solution. I got the idea from a muggle Auror show I’ve been watching. It would effectively incapacitate a room full suspects without doing any lasting damage.”
Draco’s lips twitched, as if he were fighting a smile, and Harry felt that same urge to kiss him again.
Harry smiled as they continued to lay together for a bit, neither too worried about going to eat just yet. He already had plans for next Christmas. And that little snitch ring box.
Those ideas were still there that night, and his head thrashed against the pillow as his mind conjured faceless images of men on brooms, wondering what position they’d play, only to have the double entendre of that leave him groaning and digging his fingers into the sheets beneath him. He finally fell asleep to whispers of
Harry grinned and toasted him with a piece of naan before digging into his takeout container. “I figured you were hungry, if this was when your lunch would be. And I haven’t eaten other than some form of meat on a stick while running down Diagon Alley. Thought we’d eat together.”
His day went to hell after that. It started sleeting on his walk to work, and he’d forgotten his umbrella. The heating spells were wonky at the Ministry, and his office was so cold he could see his breath. Some paperwork hadn’t been filed correctly, so evidence had been possibly mishandled, and he spent three hours chasing down the actual lost items. He then had to figure out if they were still useable in court and then file the correct original paperwork and then the extra paperwork to explain what had happened and how it had been fixed. An emergency meeting was called to discuss what could be done about the outbreak of Christmas toy scalpers. Next, he had to take over an afternoon training class when the instructor called in sick, and he had a student who could rival Neville for chaos creation and Seamus for blowing things up. Finally, he had another meeting and hour of paperwork to finalize that the problem from that morning was completely fixed.
Whimpering, Draco let himself be guided up the stairs and down the hall, Harry’s hands and lips touching and kissing the entire way. He realized his shirt was off when they entered the spacious bedroom, noticing it was decorated with dark furniture and blue bed clothes. “No Gryffindor red and gold?”
That statement led to events that made them even later and required several straightening charms on their hair and clothes, though they seemed to do nothing for Harry's hair.
Draco was stiff in his embrace before hugging back, hands firm against Harry’s lower back. “Bad day.”
By the time he finished work that night, two hours after he was supposed to be off, he was starving and his whole body hurt. He also had a stack of letters on his desk from Weasleys.
Draco grinned at the honesty, even as he hid his face against Harry’s chest. “I wanted to know it was going to matter. Like, I guess I’ve got this romantic ideal or something that sex for the first time…it’ll…matter? God, I’m not saying this well.”
“I should have done something sooner, back then. I knew you couldn’t have, that you didn’t.” Remus choked and dropped his head back. “I let Dumbledore convince me. I’m so sorry.”
Smiling, he followed Draco into the kitchen and sat at a tall stool at the kitchen island, breathing in the scent of tomato, basil, and garlic, his stomach growling.
Draco looked up, face wet. “I like blueberries and gnomes and Weasley jumpers and Weasleys, and I want to go to the ice cream parlor with you instead of worrying how it would look to eat something so messy in public.” Harry wrapped him in a hug as he took a shuddering breath, choking back a sob. “I want wild gardens and a muggle television and a cat. Not some fancy cat who has their own house elf to follow them around and keep things clean but some basic little stripped cat that looks like every other stripped cat and who runs around and climbs curtains and gets hair on everything, and I want to go to work with cat hair on my Weasley jumper and not give one god damn.”
Harry’s hands on the fly of his slacks, however, had him snapping back to attention. Draco could feel his whole body blush as he pushed against Harry’s chest, unable to meet his gaze. “I…I’ve never…I’ve never.”
Harry slicked himself with more of the lube then lined up and pressed slowly inside, cursing under his breath as the head breached Draco’s body and hesitating.
“Harry. And I told you to take the day off.” Draco spluttered, but Harry just kissed his cheek again. “We’ll come help decorate the house once we’ve got all this up. Kreatcher can help you find things, if you need.”
He grabbed his robes and headed down the hall, veering sharply as he reached the lift and suddenly walking down to potions. Inside, Draco was leaned back over that same cauldron, the smoke painting his face is shadows that emphasized the delicately crafted lines of his narrow jaw and nose, sharp cheekbones. Harry’s own face was more square, thick brows that were just as unruly as his hair, and his five o’clock shadow often showing up by noon. He was stunned all over that someone who looked like statuesque marble come to life would be interested in him. He felt a sudden urge to push Draco back against a wall and kiss him until the warmth and heat of his body squirming against Harry proved the depth of that interest.
Harry laced their fingers together and tugged him into continuing their walk. They rounded the corner a few minutes later and came into sight of Ron and Hermione, only for Ron to let out a bark of laughter that echoed down the street, making several people stop and stare.
Shuddering, Harry groaned and slanted his lips over Draco’s, mouths fusing and tongues thrusting in a mimicry of what their bodies were about to do. Pulling away, Harry stripped his jeans and pants slowly, giving Draco a moment to catch his breath and make sure he really wanted this. When no denial came, he murmured the incantation for lube and moved back onto the bed, sliding his hand between Draco’s legs to coat his hole before slipping that same seeking digit from before back inside.
Remus chuckled along, setting the tea, some biscuits, and a few sandwiches on the table. “Eat up and tell us how work has been for the two of you. Draco, you’ve accepted the position at Hogwarts, correct?”
“I think I always liked the Canons for being the underdogs. One of those, if they can be great, maybe I can, too. Hermione says a therapist would love to analyze that.”
Harry dropped into one of the leather armchairs in Sirius and Remus’s sitting room. “I fucked up. I didn’t think of him as the case. He’s just Draco, has been since the second time we talked. I didn’t think...” Harry’s voice broke on a sob, and he hung his head. “God, I fucked up.”
“I’m not! I’m sorry. I just, you were so confident that you were going to kick my ass, and you were good in school. I don’t know; I guess I expected different.”
He attached the note to Grinch and sent him off then changed from his Auror robes to his regular coat and went in search of Draco.
Harry caught his hands. “Yeah, that’s what a family is like. Andromeda and Teddy are just as bad about fussing over you and making you eat, if you give them the chance. Dre is just sneakier about it. You end up with half a meal and three desserts and thinking you’re somehow doing her a favor by taking it.”
Once dinner finished, Harry asked if Draco wanted to go for a walk, so they ended up hand in hand in the enchanted gardens. With how late it was, there were only a few other couples and no reporters in sight. Deciding they wouldn’t be disturbed, neither man bothered with more privacy spells.
Laughing, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. “Not as impressive as if he had a broken arm or caught it in his mouth, but yeah, he did good.”
“I’d think you were talking to me, but my name’s Harry.” He grinned as Draco shot him a scathing look, lip sneered up as his eyes narrowed. “I didn’t want to interrupt. And what is that? It’s awful.”
He dried his face on the edge of his sheet, smiling as he realized Grinch was standing on his shoulder and leaning into the side of his head and hooting softly. Reaching up, he patted the little bird. “Thank you. You were right. That couldn’t wait.”
The keeper stopped the quaffle, and the Arrows Seeker jerked upward at the last minute, snitch in hand. Harry yelled louder than he had the whole game and grabbed Draco, lifting him off his feet and spinning him in a circle. “Did you see that? He had to have waited until the very last minute to pull up.”
Draco all but growled as he stormed down the hall toward the potions area, and Harry grinned as he headed to his office, his owl landing back on his shoulder as he opened the door.
Harry laughed, and they spent the rest of their dinner discussing their favorite foods to cook and trading stories of disasters they’d created.
Draco jolted as he heard the screeching voice of Walburga echo off the walls around him, eyes going so wide you could see the whites around his pale grey irises and a hard shudder racking his body.
Flushing, Draco stepped back. “Only a prat would wear a button-up to a quidditch game. Wear the t-shirt. Besides, I like the way it clings to all.” He ran a hand up Harry’s chest and over his shoulder. “This.”
Harry reached out and grabbed Draco’s hand, squeezing as the other man’s rant came to a sudden halt. “There’s nothing wrong with any of that. It’s easy, when you’ve heard something your whole life, to believe it. And especially when you’ve heard so much of how you disappoint someone you wanted to impress, that you grew up wanting to make happy, make love you.” His thumb rubbed over the back of Draco’s hand, knowing he spent a long time trying to keep Vernon and Petunia happy, probably would have spent even longer caught up in their opinion had he not found a real home in Hogwarts. Draco, though, never had that. “You’re not a disappointment, though. Honestly, with what you’ve overcome, you’re one of the strongest people I know. There’s nothing wrong with what you’re doing with your life or with you.”
Seeming to catch on, Harry shoved him again. “You’re who Sirius keeps swapping records with, aren’t you?”
Harry nodded. “And he’s blocked me from his wards. And he’s moved to Hogwarts already, so I can’t just go to his place. And I can’t just walk into Hogwarts without permission, but I don’t think McGonagall is going to take “I broke my boyfriend’s heart and need to fix it” as a good reason.”
Clearing his throat, he stepped back, scrubbing his face again, mind scrambling for a way to explain what he knew would be bloodshot eyes. His mind had spent the day whirling back to that first year of Hogwarts, and he braced for the biting sarcasm and bitterness that hung from Malfoy’s arrogant, eleven-year-old shoulders.
His father shook his head and stepped forward. “We do NOT care for this development. Either you will marry a pureblood girl.” He slashed his hand to the side as his wife tried to cut in. “Or you can leave. For good.”
People still stared at they walked through, but it was surprisingly less blatant than Harry had expected, and no one said anything rude. He was used to the looks by this time, but he knew Draco was far less ostentatious than he’d been in school, more nervous about stares in public. They got drinks, nachos, and a couple bags of candy then walked toward their seats.
“Really? Bloody hell, mate, that’d be awesome. I don’t think Hermione would be interested, but I don’t think she’ll mind having an afternoon free of me.” Ron laughed, clapping Draco on the back. “George would probably love to come, though. If you don’t mind, that is.”
“This is so cool!” He automatically climbed on and took off, almost wiping out the tree, scaring his grandmother’s crups, and then falling off. “I wanna do it again!!”
Draco nodded, putting his things with Teddy’s before going to get the materials. They sat together at the kitchen table, speaking the letter out loud as they composed it, and Harry joined them once he had the hot chocolate ready and had plated the leftover parts of the gingerbread house.
Draco started to question how Potter would hear of such a small muggle eatery, but he reminded himself that the other man had grown up around muggles and was more comfortable with them than others in wizarding society might be. Moreover, Potter actively attempted to avoid being caught by paparazzi when out, so smaller establishments most likely helped him do so. A waitress arrived and sat a plate of food in front of the dark-haired man, making Draco realize he’d been gaping rather than answering. “Oh, um. It’s amazing, if you ask me, which you, obviously, just did. I, uh, I really like it, though. Staff is great, and the food is delicious. Just as good the day after, too.”
He then threw the Malfoy money and name behind that: paying for mind healers to work with victims of the war, helping to rebuild not only Hogwarts but also other homes and businesses damaged or destroyed, and then working with Kingsley and Minerva to create the PureHeart Foundation, where purebloods were taught to change their thoughts and treatments of others and could do volunteer work to pay their debt to society and learn to actually work productively with those of other blood standings.
Draco dropped his fork, and he ducked, mumbling an apology and wiping up the splash of sauce, but Harry took his hand. Not sure he was pulling in a full breath, not sure he was breathing at all, Draco looked up.
Harry cupped his face, kissing him, and Draco let the world melt away as he lost himself in the feel of Harry’s mouth of his, the heady taste of him mixed with the wine from dinner.
The other man simply blushed and shrugged, following Harry to the sandwich shop recently added to the Alley. They ordered and sat at a small table toward the back, where they would see everyone come and go.
Harry nodded. “I think so. I told them that wasn’t true, though. And Seamus and Dean agreed to write character reports for you, since you were around them all the time, even without me. And Lee vouched for you from our games. He’s not an Auror, but he works with our department as PR, so they trust him.”
Something in Draco seemed to break at having his own words quoted back to him, so calmly and casually, as if Harry Potter said things like that to Draco Malfoy every day. His whole body seemed to quake, and he shook his head. “You could so much better.”
Harry started to ask how Draco knew he always stopped for ice cream but stopped himself and just nodded. Of course, Draco knew. “It’s been a few hours since then.”
Harry came to a sudden halt, Ron walking several paces beyond him before he realized the other man had stopped. Ron turned to look back at him, worry lines between his brows.
Harry grimaced, shoulders squeezing up around his ears, as Ron started to laugh. “Um, three actually. Cho and Ginny started dating earlier this year.”
After they finished their spaghetti and garlic bread, Draco pulled a chocolate mousse out of the fridge, and they finished the wine while eating that. They cleaned up together, Harry flicking soap bubbles at Draco, and Draco swatting him with a dishtowel, before getting glasses of firewhiskey and moving to sit in the living room to continue their conversation until Draco began yawning and Harry felt his eyes droop.
“Hey, I just sent them over.” Draco smirked, undoing the paper on his present. “You get to do the rest.”
“I swear to Merlin, if you’re not telling me the house is on fire, I’m sending you back to who sent you.” Rolling over, he cracked one eye, Grinch promptly sticking his foot in it to show off that he had a letter. “You’re kidding. This couldn’t wait?” He rolled over, Grinch squawking loudly at his letter being ignored, and used is wand to cast tempus. “Fifteen minutes? I couldn’t have fifteen minutes?” Grinch flew over his head, nipped him on the nose, and shoved his foot back into Harry’s face. “No, huh? Fine.”
“I know. It’s awful. I feel like our whole lineage might as well have walked around with the world Slytherin tattooed on our foreheads.”
Draco rolled his eyes and sat. He started to respond, but Harry clamped a hand over his mouth. “Fifteen minutes. Don’t take that away from us.”
Remus stood and headed for the kitchen, leaving Sirius whining at losing contact. “I’m going to start the tea.”
Sirius snorted, “You’re keeping a dumb ass alive. Is that really lucky?” He laughed as Remus scoffed and shook his head but grinned. “And I don’t know how I got this lucky, either, but I’m never letting you go. Not again.” He cleared his throat and shifted to kneel in front of the couch, waving his wand to accio the ring box that had been hidden in the pocket of his leather jacket. “I keep trying to find the perfect time to do this, but I spent months trying to figure that out back when we were young, and all it got us was separated for over a decade. I suppose I should have learned, huh?” He opened the box and held it up to reveal a gold band decorated in rubies shaped like paw prints. “Marry me?”
Harry bit back wanting to ask why, preferring to hold onto the excitement of another possible surprise, and instead finished getting ready before flooing to Diagon Alley to visit Eyelops Owl Emporium. Several hours later, once he had all the necessary items sent to his house, he ducked into the Ministry and headed up to his office. Grinch was still sitting on his tree when Harry opened the door. His head lifted as the door opened, and he hooted softly as Harry grinned at him.
The moved as one, Harry stepping back and sitting on the plush couch-like seats of the box and Draco coming with him, crawling into his lap. Their lips found each other again, and Harry gripped Draco’s ass to pull their groins just as tightly against one another. Draco cried out softly, head falling back, and Harry gnashed his teeth along the delicate column of his throat, snarling as it wrenched another cry from the blond.
Harry blushed, taking his box of food and then running his fingers over the handle of the broom. “I know you wouldn’t, Ron. It’s, I don’t know, complicated?”
