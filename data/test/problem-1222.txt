Then after that, the whole class except Harry raised their hands and asked the Professor what their zodiac was. Even though of his popularity, the professor told Harry what his zodiac was. "Oh, Mr Potter. Your zodiac is Leo. You are most comfortable in a social setting. You love people and don't shy away from any chance to be the centre of attention."
Harry raised an eyebrow, not believing this at all. How could he help this other wizard? He knows when Hermione and Ron found him, a couple of years ago, locked in the bathroom, sobbing while slicing the cold blade across his wrist, they ran into the bathroom, threw the blade across the room and immediately hugged him and whispered words of comfort. God. That was a hard time.
Draco's smile turned into a smirk when watching Harry hear for any noise inside. What could be inside the door though? A giant polar bear? Not likely. It wouldn't have survived down here unless it had magic and ate wandering students. Oh, Merlin. Now he's making himself a little anxious. "Are you expecting anyone to knock back, Harry?"
"Girlfriend?" Blaise asked with a strike of confusion, and he shook his head. "Draco doesn't even have a girlfriend. He's not even into girls from what I've heard." Harry felt this sudden feeling of hope. His disliking to Ivy vanished, and he felt a little better hearing about this.
Draco waved a hand at him of dismissal and opened his potions book up to the required page. "Let's get started," he said and watches as Harry got up to stand next to him at the dressing table. He really hopes this potion does the trick and helps Harry out. Food is supposed to go down and not come back up. It's what gives everyone nutrients and energy to get up and do what they must to live.
Harry began to chuckle because of the speech, but Draco continued, "Let all my happiness be yours, all your sadness be mine. Let the whole world be yours, only you be mine. Harry James Potter, will you be the honour of being my husband?"
"Ever had your first kiss?" Harry asked though he knew it was a lame question. But it was also a really popular muggle question, as he remembers. He just wants to keep the game going. Plus, he is learning more about Ivy too.
"But Dray, you need to keep your promise!" Pansy said in a serious tone while she stabbed a potato with her fork from the little mound of potato salad, she had on her plate next to a couple of sausages. "Since you're not going to the Yule Ball with him, and I told you multiple times to go with him, you should at least ask him out."
Pansy smirked at her best friend looking at Harry with jealousy and need. If only she had a mirror to show him the look on his own face. "A bit jealous are you, Draco?" she asked him and held her sides. "That jealous you want to Everte Statum Fred's ass?"
Harry looked back at Fred, seeing his rosy swollen lips that he had just kissed. Goodness... What a... kiss. " You just stole my first kiss; you should be feeling lucky."
Harry backed all the way to the wall and wrapped his arms around his knees. Burying his head in his lap, he laid out a strangled sob. He just wanted to die.
The satin softness of Harry's wet end rubbed a line across Draco's cheek. He ground his face into it, feeling the springy firmness against his cheekbone. His hand crept up and tickled the little hairs on Harry's shrunken, hard little sac, circling the ball of flesh and digging his fingers in around it.
"NO! PANSY!"
"But Hun. How did you get these tickets?" Mrs Weasley asked her husband as her curiosity got the best of her and apparently her children too.
Harry almost snorted at that but managed to just smile. Seamus wasn't wrong though. "Actually... we kind of gave each other blowjobs," he admitted while feeling his cheeks burn with a blush to them. "And it wasn't our first time." The room suddenly grew silent and Harry now wished he didn't say anything.
Pansy looked up as Nott mentioned Hermione being Bi. She smiled to herself and finished off her breakfast. She hasn't heard from Hermione that she likes girls, but she had her thoughts about it.
"Merlin's Beard! This really is amazing," Draco said after a while of savoring every slurp of spaghetti. It's a delicious food that he's had rarely in his life, but he hopes to have more of this delicious delicacy.
Hermione laughed at the 'lie' Harry just told her. Harry and Draco, friends? That's just a funny thought. "Right... Sure, okay. Anyway... I'm going to go find Ron to make him do something useful that doesn't involve playing Wizards chess or procrastinating in the common room."
Harry knew he had to also get to class, he didn't know if Breakfast was over or not. He pushed his glasses back up his nose and decided to break the silence between him and Draco. "Uh... I better get to class..." he said and rubbed the back of his neck, smiling at the ground. "I don't want to be late, even though I hate Divination."
So much had happened so quickly after Mr Weasley was attacked by the snake and Harry, Hermione and Ron were whisked away to Grimmauld Place. Harry had been staring at his butterfly covered arm every morning and just wanting to feel the numbness take over him, but the butterflies were too elegant, and he just didn't want to 'kill' them. Especially Draco's green butterfly, it was just so stunning, and every time Harry looked at it, it reminded him of the blonde Slytherin that he just loves so much.
Ivy began to love this current situation and game now. She could get him to do and say anything. She opened her phone to press the record button again and she placed it down on the skull candle, so it was leaning on it and the camera was facing Harry and Draco. She walked around the table and leaned towards her cousin to whisper in his ear," I dare you to kiss Harry. A real genuine kiss." She smiles and goes back to the other couch, grabs her phone, and zooms in on her cousin and Harry.
"Goodbye my little pipsqueak," Hermione said with a tired sigh and gave the Niffler she had a nice scratch on its furry head. Hermione's Niffler shook its foot, really liking the pat it was getting. The little gesture made Hermione chuckle.
Harry let out a groan and Draco kept rubbing the tip of his nose in a circle on the bulge in Harry's pants. Wanting to feel more than just material, he unzipped Harry's fly all the way until his eyes are met with dark blue material and he presses his nose back on the bulge in Harry's boxers. He smells Harry's musky scent, and it goes directly to his own groin, making his pants feel a little tight.
Harry felt relief, he felt free. He missed this feeling, flying like there wasn't a single care in the world. He lifted his leg over his broom and took off with a jump, soaring through the sky. Harry saw Fred and George chasing something golden, it could only be the practice snitch. He sped towards them, nearly crashing into Fred whilst hot on the trail of the snitch.
Ron scratched his head, not knowing if he should believe his best mate or not. "Alright, if you insist," he said with a sigh, edging away from the conversation as it appeared that Harry didn't want to talk to him about whatever's going on.
"Tell me if it hurts," Harry whispered.
"Harry?!" a familiar voice said. Harry looked up with his tear-stained cheek, seeing the person he wanted the most to come and rescue him. He watched as the boy took out his wand, aimed it at Hermione and Ron and fired a spell.
Draco sighed. If this were the initials of Harry's parents, he knew that Harry would want to be able to see past memories from his parents. He then remembered he had to write a description of the sneezing plant thing, so he studied it. The petals were kind of a snowy white, the stem and leaves were a mint green colour. He wrote it all down in a more detailed description, writing, "The colour of the outer petals is a far snowier white colour than the inner petals of the flower, which has a creamy lemon colour. The center of the flower had a lemony yellow colour, which is where the plant stores all the liquid to make people sneeze. Moreover, the stem of the plant is a unique mint colour. Although, the leaves of the plant also are the same mint colour with the stem."
"Dobby?!" Harry called out into the kitchen for the elf he's good friends with. In a second the house-elf named Dobby whipped out of nowhere and onto the top of the table the three were seated at. Draco thought he recognized the house-elf from somewhere band he couldn't tell where he saw the elf from.
Ron had more Quidditch merch than anybody else in his family. He and Harry supported Bulgaria whereas his siblings Fred, George and Ginny supported Ireland.
Ron thought for a moment about letting Harry sit over there with Malfoy. He didn't want Harry to go alone so he would tag along. "Okay then, we can go sit with them," he said but was unwilling to go. This was Malfoy they were talking about for Merlin's sake. "But if he says anything rude about my family or friends, I swear I will hex him to the next week! And the main reason I'm going to go sit with them is that Zabini's there and he's a cool dude."
Harry felt a little awkward in this conversation when talking about shavers and armpits. Especially to another person. A dead person. "Okay?" he said, wanting to get away from this situation and her as he did not actually know how to reply to her. He
When they were up in the boy's dormitory, Draco had looked around carefully at all the beds and to his luck saw nobody. He shut the door behind Harry with a grin and turned to his Gryffindor. "I just thought some time alone with my boyfriend would be fun," he said and closed the distance between them by placing his arms around Harry's waist. "Don't you think so?"
Draco sighed and walked up to his cousin. He has a feeling that she's getting one of those headaches that really hurt, and he doesn't want her going through that kind of pain. So, he hugged her. "Ne parlons pas fran√ßais devant Harry, je ne veux pas qu'il se sente exclu." ("Let's not speak French in front of Harry as I don't want him feeling left out.")
"Nearly there," Draco said as they walked up to the portrait of a fake corridor. Draco and Harry looked around to make sure the coast was clear and with a little push of the torch, the portrait swung open and they walked inside. They couldn't be bothered with using a "Lumos" as they already knew the way through without a light. They passed the familiar roots and vines of the dark hallway until they got to the familiar-looking wooden door with a little badger on the doorknob. Draco pushed open the door to reveal the oh so familiar garden of Amare.
As soon as he knew it, the shower had turned off. He laid down in the bed and looked up at the ceiling tapestry. He heard the bathroom door open, close, then heard footsteps walk over to him. He sat up and watched as Harry in blue checkeredpyjamas placed those baggy clothes down on the end of the bed and got into bed beside him and. "Do I still get told a bedtime story?" he asked as he then got out of bed, wanting to have a shower so he can get back into the nice warm bed.
Harry's eyes shot up at the booth the girl's voice came from, and he couldn't believe his eyes. It was Draco Malfoy, in a muggle bar, with two other purebloods. Without a moment's hesitation, he locked eyes with Draco and swallowed, his face felt like it was in an oven. He watched Hermione, who went over to the jukebox and pressed a few buttons.
Ron and Hermione rushed over to Harry, worried for their best friend who's being kept in detention with Draco. "We'll stay and help you finish Harry," Hermione said, not acknowledging Draco at all and he was fine with that.
"I... um... I saw what looks like... self-harm cuts on his left arm," Harry whispered, in case George was around. He knew how uneasy and frightened to find out that people knew about your self-harming. It's happened to him when Sirius died, Hermione found out then she told Ron and they both cornered and comforted him.
With a departing kiss goodbye, which left a scowling Severus staring at the two, Harry left for Gryffindor Tower with McGonagall. He also only just saw Snape standing behind Draco and wondered how long the Potions Professor had been there for.
Blaise frowned. That's a lot of people that know of his crush on Ron. "Okay, that's a lot of people," he said, nearly squeakishly and tried not to sound panicked. Too late. "Anyway... um... just please don't kiss him again." He frowned at the ground and rubbed his arm up and down.
Draco sighed in relief and wrapped his arms tightly around Potter's stomach, but he knew he was hugging him as it's the least he could do, even if Potter didn't know it. He could feel the softness of Potter's hair against his ears as his head was resting on Potter's shoulder. He just wanted to run his fingers through Potter's hair and feel how soft his sexy messy black hair is. Did he just admit that? Yes, yes, he did. He had to admit, Potter was indeed good looking, he's always been attractive in the kind of nerdy but hot sporty way. But Draco knew Potter and Weaslette had a thing. Or did they? He's never seen them two together and he knew Potter doesn't stare at the Weaselette in any kind of way. Not that he does stare at Potter... Oh, Merlin, he knew he had a thing for Potter. Who doesn't? Those pretty and intense emerald green eyes, messy sexy black hair, pretty long black eyelashes, soft and kissable looking lips.
"Oh, Harry, that's beautiful to hear," Hermione says sweetly and cups her mouth, hiding her smile as her face begins to hurt from smiling too much. "Wait... was this a cheek or lip kiss?"
"Harry... Harry..." Draco said as he shook Harry's hand and repeated the name so he can get used to the feeling of saying the same. But the name was so alien on his tongue. "So, this rivalry has ended?"
Harry smiled as a thank you at her. He looked down at his paper, dipped his quill in his ink and began writing. Want to go flying tomorrow afternoon after supper? Where do we meet though? If you want, we can explore back in the yellow bedroom for the rest of the day today? Harry gave the letter to Hedwig. "Stay with us for a while, Hedwig," he tells her, a little anxious about Draco's safety when the twins obviously are putting together their prank. "I'm afraid the twins are planning some trick on Draco."
Harry nodded and continued stirring the potion for one more time, the water turned into a light purple colour. He gave a satisfied smile at his work and pondered how he'll thank Draco in the future. A box of chocolates? Flowers? Maybe a thank-you card?
"Not if I get there first," Draco shouted back, smirking at the thought of the challenge he must beat Harry to. This is going to be so much fun.
Harry began to blush from the kiss Draco gave him. How could he not blush? Draco's kisses always lit him up from the inside with a spark. Then he let out a yawn, which he really should have kept inside because now Draco chuckled at him which made his blush a little darker in colour.
"Okay," Harry said. Right now, he just wanted to get away. It was nice talking to Seamus and Dean, but he feels as if he needs a longer walk. To reduce some stress and anxiety. "It was good seeing you again, but I have to get back... Bye." He didn't even wait for their reply as he walked away, with a frown.
"What is she?" Seamus asked them but was a little too loud because the woman opened her eyes, which were white just like her face and glared at him. Seamus took a step back, Goosebumps appearing on his arm which he rubbed at them.
Harry, Dean, Dennis Creevey as Michael Myers, and Justin Finch-Fletchley as Leatherface gave the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff muggle-borns a minute's head start to run off into the corridors screaming for their lives before they ran after them.
"Yes, Draco!" Harry's back arched a little off the headboard, his grip on Draco's hair tightening as his intense orgasm washed over his body, his hot load spurting into the blonde Slytherin's mouth. The cries of ecstasy leaving his lips, filling the room. It took a while until his breathing had calmed down, and while he was doing so, Draco was swallowing every drop of his boyfriend's cum and pulled his mouth off Harry's cock with a little 'pop'.
Once everyone in the room was seated, in the middle of every table plates of food started appearing. Steak and salad, chicken parmesan, pizza, omelette, burgers, et cetera. Harry grabbed a steak with salad and got onto eating the salad first.
"Get back to devising the ingredients to the potion you'll be brewing then!" Snape responded coolly in his monotoned voice and crossed his arms over his chest. Harry nodded and continued writing but a little slower. He still felt eyes drilling into his head and looked over at the Slytherins. Draco winked at Harry, causing him to blush a little so Harry glared at him in annoyance as the blonde Slytherin got him into trouble and continued writing down ingredients for a potion.
Draco knew what this meant, she wasn't actually going to show him anything. It's her code to say that she wants to talk about stuff and that she'd also listen to whatever he has to say. He happily agreed and followed her up the stairs, which he had just come down from.
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
"The only word that I can come up with is incredible, Harry," Draco says with a not-so-obvious blush to his cheeks and neck. He rubs the side of his neck, smiling down at the Duna and says, "You're incredible, Harry."
Seamus smiled at his boyfriend and lay his head down on his shoulder, their hands intertwined under the table. "Does anybody want to know how he asked me out?" he asked them, then tilted his head up and leaned forward, kissing Dean on the jaw. Then he looks back at them. "Who wants to hear the whole story?"
Hermione poked Harry on the shoulder, grabbing his attention. She hadn't seen Hagrid anywhere and hoped he was alright. "Where do you think Hagrid is?" she asked worriedly and wrinkled her brow.
"Get off me, Ron!" spat Ginny and tried pushing him off her. She placed her arm around Luna again. "But yes, it's good knowing you're not dead."
"I was going to ask-" Madam Pomfrey turned around, seeing that the Hospital Wing was empty. She smiled and went into the middle of the Hospital and looked through the doors and down the corridor. The girl was gone. She then knew Ivy must have sped off. Literally. She sighed and went back to her office to finish some healing potions she was in need of to stock up.
Ivy rose her hands and buried them in Lavender's sandy-blonde hair, holding the Gryffindor to her. She let out a soft moan from her throat and rolled her hips against the Gryffindor's. And then Ivy knew what she and Lavender now both wanted. She crawled back with a smile so she could see Lavender's knickers, grabbed the hem, and pulled them down. The sight amazed Ivy. Lavender really looked like an angel; she is so pretty. The little blondish brown curls on Lavender's fanny were so adorable! She wanted to feel them, but not quite yet. She looked back up at the panting Lavender and smiled. Ivy stripped herself in front of Lavender until she had nothing else on.
The boys just stood there, frozen to the spot when looking at the eye watching them. They couldn't move, they wouldn't. They knew the person couldn't get to them. Not unless they take the door down.
Harry shook his head, not even thinking that his best friend could like him in that way. Even if she did, he wouldn't have noticed. Who would even like a freak like himself? "She doesn't." He looked back to the book he was previously reading. The first word he spots in one paragraph is 'soul'. Strange... "She's always looking over at the Slytherin table."
Harry's eyes widened in surprise as he took in the sight before him. It was such an amazing little room, but even he wouldn't have shared this place with Ron and Hermione because he knew that alone time was the best time in the world. Well, sometimes it was. "This is amazing, Draco!" he said, raising his eyebrows at the room he was in. Everything was so vintage but not 60s style vintage. It was just old like hundreds of years old. "Did you ever tell me how you found this place?" Maybe this place could be a better place for when he needs to...cut. No, that'd be dangerous. Draco could walk in on him anytime and see what he does to myself.
"Oh, he just..."Harry trailed off as he remembered Ron being silent and speechless. He wished Ron could have said whatever was on his mind even if it could have hurt. "He wasn't really talking to me; I don't think he could talk. Guess he was a little shocked."
Ivy smiled at her cousin, still wondering why he isn't the one on the dancefloor with Harry. Though he needs to be, and an idea popped into her head "Indeed!" she said with her hands on her hips. He's even jealous of Fred. "You know Drake, he only asked Fred because you never had the guts to ask him yourself. And you told him you're going with our dear young Pansy over here when she clearly told you that you can forget about her and go with Harry."
Ron stretched out his arms and his legs in bed and yawned. "You didn't come down for lunch or dinner yesterday, the day before and even a few other days ago," he said and looked around the room at his other dormmates. "Why is that?" Then it hit him. Dementors! They suck the happiness out of you, but the thing is he didn't see any dementors inside.
Joslyn giggled at them and just had to ask, "Are you guys...?"
Draco frowned a little from the obvious lie Harry was telling him, and it hurt but he knew it would be hard for Harry to talk about what he goes through with people. He gets it because Ivy's been the same too. It took her time to open up and she let Draco into her mind slowly and carefully. He knows about the lies and the tricks thanks to Ivy. "Okay. So... are we still going to walk into the Great Hall distanced or should we come out to everyone about our friendship?"
Draco frowned at the two similar doors in front of him and Harry. But the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor doors were back upstairs by the Hufflepuff doors in the hallway. What are they doing here? "If the Ravenclaw and Gryffindor doors are down here, then what could have been behind the ones up top?"
In a few seconds time, Draco got out of his bed with his pants on and he had his dress robe cloak on too. With him, the strong scent of citrus and vanilla cologne travelled up Harry's nostrils and made him sigh delightfully. Harry went up to him and placed his arms around him in a hug, breathing in his favourite spell-made or man-made scents from Draco.
"Shopping?" Draco turned his head to look at Harry, a little curious about shopping and what he needs. Unless it's a Christmas present since it is coming up quite fast. Soon it will be over, and the new year will begin. "What for?"
Draco elbowed Crabbe hard in the ribs for his rudeness. How dare the git not like Harry because Harry's just a wonderful human being that deserves all the love and attention in the world. "Oww!" Crabbe whined and rubbed at his ribs.
Harry had just come into the Gryffindor common room after coming back from Defense Against the Dark Arts and he saw a small group of students gathered around two first-year muggle-born siblings. He believes their names are Mike and Savannah Adwell. He went over towards the group and noticed the two muggle-borns were making the group of students ranging from other first ears to prefects amazed. But what were they doing?
"Oh, I definitely think so," said Hermione with a strong nod. How did she not see this coming in the first place? Those two have so much chemistry!
Draco looked at his cousin deeply in her dull ocean blue eyes, trying to figure out her emotions. He wishes she would tell him what she's feeling now and then. "Are you sure, though? It wouldn't be a problem."
But Harry couldn't have Dean as he and Seamus had been a thing for years, even since his 5th year. Well, it wasn't until after Dean kissed Harry that Seamus became jealous and after the kiss. He remembered how the Irish boy crawled over to Dean and kissed him in front of everyone. It was quite amusing to Harry, watching two guys kiss. He wanted what Dean and Seamus had but he just hadn't been exploring for that guy... yet.
"You mean some time alone while everyone's down eating lunch while we're up here and could be naked on my bed?" Harry corrected him with a smirk and his green eyes were filled with a sudden glimmer of lust which made Draco excited both sexually and mentally.
"-Up to something?" Hermione and Ron finished together.
Draco and Ivy sigh as they wanted to show everyone, but they thought it would be funny to see their friends dancing together. They expected to have a laugh, but Pansy and Blaise danced like their lives depended on it. They were graceful, made no mistakes, and danced perfectly.
Draco laughed at that. Even if the woman's bed was quite comfy, he preferred his actual bed. "Yeah, we should." When the Gryffindor removed his body from his and got up off the couch, Draco did the same but held his hand out to Harry. "Dinner in the kitchens my love?"
Harry looked overwhelmed but confused at the same time. It just didn't really make sense at all. He knows that Sirius was gay, and he knew well that Sirius would have never had a child with anyone at a young age. That was just... He knows by calculation that his own mom had him at around twenty. If he was born in July. Take nine months from July and you get sometime in October.
Harry chuckles and nods at the question. It is a little cheesy. "A little bit," he says and gestures what he said with his thumb and his finger. "But don't we have a room to go to?"
*****
Draco smirked and completely ignored the whole sentence except for two words Harry said. "I agree with you that you are very pretty, Harry."
"It was amazing, Draco," Harry said, he was still inside of Draco but loved it. He reached down to Draco's prick, swiped the pre-come onto his thumb and licked it from his thumb. "You taste good." He licked off every bit of come on Draco's dick and collapsed on to the bed to the left of Draco. "I love you," he said again, staring up at the ceiling of Draco's 4-postered bed.
"Yes, Professor," Harry replied, sighing heavily, and grabbing his things. He couldn't believe he left his stuff here for people to scrummage through. The Slytherin's probably put some kind of prank in his book bag or something.
"No..." Harry choked, moving away from the figure of himself who was coming towards him. He started to feel a familiar loud buzzing noise in his ears. He couldn't take it. The noise was so loud he couldn't hear what the figure of himself was saying. All he really could hear was, "It's all your fault."
"Merlin, Draco. You never let anyone touch your hair," Blaise says, a little shocked that Draco let Potter actually touch Draco's hair as not even Ivy or Pansy can. Draco's smile widens and that's when he sees the rose in Blaise's hand. What a unique thing to hold.
Draco raised an eyebrow curiously, wondering if bunny rabbits do have a smell. He's never touched or been near one so he wouldn't know. Is it the fur that smells or the body? "Bunnies have a smell?"
"The what now?" George asked, and it was clear that he sounded confused. He furrowed his brows at the word but what he needed was the toilet right now. "Never mind the explanation... can you please hurry because I need to go!"
Harry shook his head, wishing he didn't have to have these conversations. "Both," was his only reply. But in the end, he did tell his Irish dormmate that he was a bottom, and Seamus nodded and seemed to understand what it's like.
When Harry was all the way inside, Draco arched up so that their sweat-slicked bodies pressed together. Harry's thrusts were thorough, each one measured to open Draco's tight body up as wide as possible, but carefully, so that every ripple of sensation was electrifying and not painful. They moved together effortlessly, wringing the most from the smallest of sensations and working unselfishly to arouse each other.
With almost painful slowness, Harry withdrew his fingers. He watched closely as Draco filled the unwanted space with another two of his own, pumping them in and out at the same leisurely pace he had set.
"I know a heap of muggle songs and bands, dating back to the '60s," Ivy said and as she said that she got out her phone again. She then sighed, knowing the magic around Hogwarts would destroy her phone if she tried to use her mobile data and internet. "The Beetles, Fleetwood Mac, Blondie, ACDC, Guns N Roses, Led Zeppelin etc." Ivy looked down at the plate of food left on the table, untouched by anybody and decided to grab a piece of toast and eat it since she has not eaten in some time, except an apple.
Harry noticed the green door first and wondered if that's the door to the Slytherin room. It could be since it's green and black. What else could it have been? Perhaps a storage room? "Do you think that's... the Slytherin bedroom door?" he asked and pointed towards the green door.
Harry then heard the familiar sound of feathers and hoots coming from the owls that had just flown into the Great Hall. There were only a few owls, not a lot but that didn't stop him from watching his own snowy owl, Hedwig, fly down onto the table. He noticed Hedwig was carrying a letter, the only people who ever sent him letters was Sirius, Mrs Weasley or Remus. "Hello, Hedwig."
Narcissa frowned; how does he still not accept their Draco? And it's an easy answer to what he should do. "I believe you should decide on your own," she told him and crossed her arms over her chest. "Perhaps ask Dumbledore to let him come over with Harry for the holiday. Or even write our Draco a letter, telling him that we know about his feelings towards Harry, the befriending, and the Yule Ball."
"Do you think Potter will make it out of the Tournament alive?" Pansy suddenly asked, grabbing a waffle, and spreading maple syrup on it. She didn't sound worried at all for Harry's life and how it could be at sake, but deep down she was because she knew how much Draco loved him. Any friend of Draco's will immediately be her friend, if they treat Draco right and Harry does.
"Uh-, I, -umm, I-," Harry stuttered and quickly pointed to the vine-like rod. Damn, he feels like an idiot. Why didn't he know this already? What's even worse, he's being an idiot in front of Draco, and it is just so mortifying.
Harry chuckled, sat next to Draco, and watched the wizard's game until it was time for dinner.
Ivy looked back at Madam Pomfrey, a little mad that the older witch had to split her and Lavender up for the day. She could sense this witch wanted to keep her longer than a moment'. "What did you need to talk to me about?" she asked and put on a smile. Whatever this is about she hoped would be important.
Harry didn't hear what she said as he already turned the doorknob and headed out into the cold evening. He didn't know where he was heading as he let his body guide him away from the house. Next thing he knew, he stood underneath a tree. He decided to sit there for a while and to just think, think about if it was okay to like guys because boys were the only thing on his mind. He never notices the girls he walks by; they're all just blurs. But the girl's boyfriends he does take a really good look at. He does not know what he's into in a guy. Obviously, a guy that is kind, caring, handsome, sweet, smart, and intelligent - but in their own way...
The robe's colour made Harry's eyes stand out more and become lighter and Draco thought that was beautiful, so he kissed Harry. He didn't care if it were in the classroom in front of a teacher that he kissed Harry or if students started filling the class. Harry kissed back softly, then he did what he thought he'd never known would do. He licked across the bottom of Draco's mouth, fighting for entrance to the Slytherin's mouth but as soon as Draco opened his mouth the professor caught them.
"Yes, Dray," Pansy said, giving him a knowing smile. It was so obvious he was concerned for Harry's life even when surrounded by people who think Draco still 'hates' Harry. "We know he's next. Scared you might lose the bet, now do you?"
"What promise?" Harry thought to himself and moved closer to Ivy who sat next to Pansy so he can get a good view of Draco. But he could see worry etched on the Slytherin's beautiful pale face, and his blonde hair was falling in his eyes a little. Harry wanted to brush it away so badly, and touch Draco's hair and face.
Cedric laughed at the lovestruck Gryffindor. It took a moment for Cedric to find the words to say to Harry about the next task, "By the way, have you figured out the egg yet?"
"THE HELL!" Now Draco and Pansy whipped out their wands for defence. But Hermione threw them away with an Expelliarmus. She was glad professor McGonagall transformed her wand into a ring, so it makes this prank even better. She evilly smiled at them from in the air.
Narcissa gave her son a nod of assurance. She was so pleased to have such an amazing son who loves her dearly and cares for her as much as she cares for him. "I will, promise. Now, you two best be off, I don't want to keep you waiting."
Harry locked his trunk back up and crawled up to his pillows, taking the weighted blanket with him. He wriggled under his bedsheets, turned away from Ron and put the weighted blanket over the top of him. In what feels like an hour or two, he was drifting off to sleep.
"A scream," said Blaise clearly, and Pansy glared at him for his feistiness. He smirked and crossed his arms, feeling a little proud but all he hoped was if Neville was okay. He has never heard Neville scream, but the thought was oddly nice, if he had him in bed with him.
When Harry came, he didn't give Draco any warning. His come thickly coating Draco's tongue and the back of his throat, his dick pulsing against Draco's palate. Draco tried to swallow it all down, coughing slightly as he finally pulled off. "Beautiful. You taste so beautiful."
"Wonderful Potter, with his scar and his broomstick," said Blaise, placing his hands on his hips and smirking. He recalls Draco repeating that sentence over and over again during the years.
A familiar little house elf come running up to the three students with three bowls of Spaghetti Bolognese levitating in the air. Dobby jumped on top of the table and made his way to them. "Harry Potter sir, Dobby has your Spaghetti here, and for Harry Potters friends.". He levitated the three bowls of Spaghetti Bolognese towards the two wizards and witch, levitating a fork each besides the bowls.
"How can you think that I can move on, Harry," asked George, who sounded a little irritated at Harry's words. "I can't forget my twin! He's a part of me."
Harry, Draco, Ron, and Hermione reappeared into the Potions classroom. Harry and Draco were still hand in hand but they didn't care if people stared at them even if they actually were being stared at by everyone in the classroom.
*****
Where the one who you love's not an issue.
"Joslyn will love this!" Draco said after paying for the ferret and smiled at the ferret in the cage. But he didn't like how it was inside a cage. Being a small animal, he remembered how big everything was to him.
Draco wanted to watch this so much, but when Harry's tongue lapped at him, Draco's eyes closed and his hips grew a life of their own. He wanted to be in Harry's mouth, but Harry was exploring him, following the long ridge that ran the length of him until the pointy tongue separated his testicles in their fleshy sac, making the skin writhe and contract. He couldn't stop a hand journeying out and fanning over Harry's head, stroking his hair, combing through it to reach the damp warmth of his scalp.
Harry wrapped his legs around Draco's hips as Draco stopped tonguing him and crawled forward and began kissing him again. And it was so much better, skin sliding on skin, the heat of Draco's cock against his hip even though he could taste something odd in Draco's mouth. Goodness. When he felt a finger teasing his rim again, he reached up and twisted Draco's nipple in response, earning a loud groan from above him. He smiled.
Harry couldn't help but let every tear he had come out. This wasn't helping him at all. He felt even worse and felt like he needed to be alone. He knew what to do and how much he had to bleed. He pushed Draco away from him gently, even though he didn't want to. He could see the confusion written all over his boyfriend's face and he wiped his tears away, but it didn't help as more tears plummeted down his cheeks like rivers. "I'm sorry Draco," he said and broke down even more. "I don't deserve you; nobody deserves a freak like me. I'm not good enough. I'm just a pathetic-!"
Hermione saw the unfamiliar look in Harry's eyes and looked at him worriedly but shrugged it off as normal teenage behaviour. "Anyways, what shall we do?" Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione quickly cut him off," And no, we're not playing Wizards Chess or Exploding Snap!"
"Hello," said a sweet young voice, looking up at Pansy.
"He's been looking rather skinny lately, as well as gloomy," Draco said and his eyebrows furrowed in complete worry. He hopes he's not the only one who sees it. Granger and Weasley must be seeing it too. They're with him all the time during meals.
Ron nodded hesitantly. He opened his mouth to speak but shut it as he had nothing to say. Not once in his life had he ever had to think about the fact that guys can like guys. He didn't think it existed until this year when he found out about Cedric having a boyfriend. Well, he has heard of men liking men for a while, but he has never thought of it ever.
And then Harry smiled as he loves the way Draco thinks about his family like that. And then there's him who doesn't have a family that loves him. He's just an orphan. A sad, depressed, Orphan. "I meant why are you staying at your house with Ivy for Christmas?"
Harry felt the sudden warmth spread up to his cheeks and across his face, which he then gave his Slytherin boyfriend a small smile. He tensed at his arm; the numb wave almost made him feel... good about himself. Could that actually happen? Could cutting serve a different purpose? Could it make him a little happy because what exactly was he feeling right now?
Draco thanks him with a nod, glad there's at least another decent Gryffindor who wouldn't storm off on him and actually give him details. He just hoped Thomas wasn't lying. From there, he headed off to his Divination class fairly quickly as he did stay after class and wait for Finnegan and Thomas. He was just thankful he got what he wanted.
Harry then went over what Cedric told him, 'Take a bath with the egg'. He grabbed the egg from his towel and opened the egg up when it was underwater. He didn't hear anything, so he ducked under the water to see if had a different effect. Surprisingly, it did.
"Okay, thank you for telling me this Cedric," Harry said gratefully, giving the Hufflepuff a smile that lit up his face. He is thankful for having such a great Hufflepuff friend. But right now he really wants to go and get the stuff he needs for staying over with Draco.
"Great!" Draco beamed at the answer he had been waiting for. This excited him. "Do you want me to come with, just to hold your hand or hug or cuddle with?" He would love to accompany Harry on one of his therapy appointments. It would be fun getting to know exactly how the professionals do it.
Parvati wanted to scream but thought that would just make things worse. "Let's run in three... two-."
Draco blushed as he was feeling his pants suddenly tighten from the contact of Harry's knee touching his crotch, and what looked like Harry was about to kiss him. Merlin, but he wants that kiss. "I'm definitely dreaming," he whispered, and his breath ghosted on Harry's lips. Suddenly feeling a little aware that he really wanted to kiss Harry, and that the urge was burning him deeply within, he scooted back under the bedsheets, and lay there in the slight darkness, not knowing what to do and if it's a dream or not. "Wake me up whenever classes are about to start."
Narcissa's smile disappeared; she knew Lucius is homophobic but truly thought he would accept his own son for who he is. "Very well," she said and narrowed her eyes at him. "I'm disappointed in you, Lucius. I thought you would accept our son as who he is. I'm afraid I was wrong."
"You guys have a good night sleep too, Fred and George," Harry replied, sitting on his cot, and looking at them in the faint darkness of the tent. Merlin, everyone was a heavy sleeper. Then with a yawn, he laid down and looked up above him at the roof of the tent.
Harry gave a snort. How are Hufflepuff's too mushy? And of course, they have to be nice. Everyone has to be nice to gain people's respect and friendship. "I repeat, and that's bad because?"
George looked over at Draco with a smile. He remembered the Slytherin and Harry dancing non-stop at the Yule Ball, almost like the two were actually a couple. "So, Malfoy, does your family accept homosexuality?"
Ivy saw one of the twins look down somewhere near her arms and looked to where the twin was staring. Her breath hiked at the raw cuts she forgot to spell away this morning but really, she couldn't be bothered to. She quickly covered her wrist up by pulling her sleeve down past her knuckles.
Harry nodded at her, smiling back. He's starting to warm up to this family now. "That just leaves Mr. Malfoy, wherever he is."
Draco looked at him sadly and shook his head. "What did Pomfrey say about your pain?" he asked him, furrowing his brows with complete worry. It hurt so much to see Harry in pain. "Can't she give you something for it?"
"Yeah, we'd love to hear another song," Neville said quietly, feeling a little sad as he'd been left out of the conversation. But he knew he shouldn't as he'd been asked questions by a number of people around him.
"Yeah," Harry said, smiling and rubbing his arms as he felt that all so familiar warmth rise up from his neck to his face, and with it came a noticeable blush. "I'm sure mom and dad were and thank you."
Pansy held up her arms in surrender but with a smirk "Fine, whatever," she said boldly and dropped her hands to her lap. She needed food anyway, and so do her friends. "Let's just go down for breakfast." Draco nodded and was the first one out the Slytherin common room.
He stopped in his tracks when spotting a guy with a ... burnt face? The hell! Gloves with metal claws on them, a red and black long-sleeved shirt, and a hat. The sodding hell are these things?! They're definitely not human.
"Please..., don't," said George. "I don't want too much attention."
The professor really didn't know what to do in this situation. Has she ever had a student ask if they could keep something? No. "Miss Brown, it has no life," she said in her stern voice and watched as her young pupil's expression became gloomy. "It's been a cage for centuries now."
Suddenly, Hermione dropped right next to Harry on the chair and smiled at everyone around her who is close friends with Pansy. "Hello, everyone," she said with a cheerful smile, and then looks over at Pansy who's checking out her nails.
Harry watched the door in front of him close and then stood there in shock. He just remembered something. Wait... Where's my blade! Shit! Shit! Shit! He searched through his Pajama bottoms pockets and his Pajamas chest pocket. He sighed in relief as he felt the cool metal against his fingertips in his chest pocket. He then quietly made his way back to Ron's bedroom, opening the door quietly and shut it from behind him. He snuggled in under the blankets of his bed and tried to get some sleep.
Harry faked a smile at him though he knew Draco wouldn't believe it. "I'm fine," he said, and the lie hurt him from deep within. But he chose to go on with it and feel like a terrible boyfriend. That's what he believes he is. A terrible boyfriend.
Ivy recognized the music player that Fred and the students who she knows are muggle-born had placed next to the gramophone. Two of the students were in her classes. "Why has George, Elton and Nikola got a Muggle music player?"
Draco walked into the room and split apart from the others. He wanted to find Harry because he knows Harry should be here somewhere. The song 'This is Halloween' playing loudly in the background and the freaks in the room danced to it while the students of Hogwarts just wandered around like lost dogs. Was that Professor McGonagall? He was sure he saw her stroll to the food table. Or was she floating like a ghost? He couldn't tell.
Draco's jaw dropped open a little, and he stared into Harry's green eyes but kept playing the correct chords. He noticed something in those green eyes that he's been ignoring all his life since he met Harry. It was beauty, perfection, and light. Such a bright light that it could just chase away anything negative inside him. He looked Harry up and down, really liking what he sees with the black fluffy hair, gorgeous green eyes, toned body, handsome face. Then he glanced down at Harry's lips for a second, then blushed as he was caught staring and turned his attention back to the piano.
Draco rolled his hips for Harry, begging him silently to get on with it and take him. He lifted his legs up and traced his feet across Harry's hipbones, coaxing his body forward into position. Harry's face was a mask of concentration as he looked down and aimed his cock at Draco's opening. It took a bit of jiggling and jabbing to hit the right spot but eventually, Draco felt the first incredible inch of the anticipated intrusion into his body. He moaned loudly, and Harry collapsed slowly onto him.
Neville nodded at him. "It's not really hard to miss, Harry," he said earnestly. "I've seen you guys kiss more than once and let me ask you this: Do friends kiss each other like they're in love with the other? No, I don't believe so. I've seen the way you look at each other too. It's just too obvious."
"Everyone cries, Draco," Harry said softly. Why would someone even believe that crying is weak when it's not? "It doesn't mean you're weak or pathetic, it shows that you care and are strong."
Harry looked back at her and nodded, feeling stupid that he'd forgotten that Hermione probably charmed it to float upstairs as she walked into the wards. But why didn't he see it earlier?
Harry nodded, liking the idea. He doesn't like using his own parchment except for schoolwork. "Sure, just get Ron to give it to me or place it on my bed for me," he said flatly, and Hermione nodded as she continued eating her breakfast. Harry then read over the note from Draco.
"Of course, Harry," Draco says and leans out of the hug only to move Harry's presents to the end of the bed and pull Harry by the hand into his bed. He shut all the drapes to his bed and just laid down and made enough room to fit Harry in. The Gryffindor laid down, his hands finding their way around the Slytherin's waist and he snuggled in closer. They looked into each other's eyes for a moment as they lay side by side and close the distance between them, closing their eyes, and they kiss slowly in each other's arms. They pull away only a few inches just to breath and place their foreheads against each other.
"Morning, guys," Harry said and was looking around the table for something to eat. He was pretty hungry and felt like he could eat a whole cow. He grabbed a piece of toast, smeared strawberry jam on it and started eating it. He was a bit happy that he could eat something and not want to throw it up anymore, thanks to Draco. He enjoyed eating the toast, it was good and didn't taste like ashes.
As they arrived at Draco's room, Draco closed the door behind him and gestured Ivy to sit down on his bed. "So, what is it you wanted to talk to me about?" he asked, looking at his cousin with concern as he joined her on his bed.
"Was it your first kiss, my Dragon?" Narcissa added as she was cutting up her egg and popped it into her mouth.
Harry looked beside him at the Slytherin a little curiously and nodded. "Yes, the Transfiguration Courtyard is much closer to us than we are of our dorms," he said, unsure about what Draco's getting at. "Why do you ask?"
Draco gulped. Goodbye silky pyjamas and slippers. He's got other pairs anyway. "Let's go! Now!"
Harry smiled at the snowflake on Draco's nose, finding it cute and it made the Slytherin's eyes shine like stars in a night sky. He then began helping Draco make snowballs, forgetting about the fact that Draco had hit him with more snowballs than anyone else. "We shall."
Harry nodded, understanding what she wanted him to do but he just couldn't be bothered. There's just so much pressure on him to know about the next task and to not get hexed by anybody. "I'll go to Dumbledore if that's what you're asking me to do, he finally said, but he wouldn't be doing such a thing until he feels like it. Raincheck: it probably won't be until tomorrow."
Harry and Draco decided to meet each other back in the library's secret room after dinner. He had his broom, invisibility cloak and practice snitch with him. It took him a few minutes to escape Ron and Hermione, but he managed to talk them out of where he was going. Of course, Hermione knew who he was going to see. She's been talking with Harry a lot about his and Draco's relationship, Hermione always sighed when she heard Harry say, "We're just friends." But she couldn't help but think with a knowing smile, Not for long.
George, Ginny, Ron, Harry, and Draco looked over at Fred with smiles. It was clear that they all have missed playing the game. Harry and Draco took no hesitation to run up to Ron's room to grab their broomsticks while the Weasley kids ran out back to the shed for their broomsticks.
In all his classes, Harry has noticed Draco staring at him. He didn't mind it at all. Unless something was wrong... Which there wasn't and thank Merlin for that. It actually was a little sweet and it always made his cheeks feel warm whenever he caught Draco staring. But the best part about catching the blonde Slytherin staring at him was the pink tinges that always appeared on his cheeks.
"Harry Potter and his friends are all welcome," Dobby said and bowed down to them, his nose touching the table, but it seemed he didn't mind. "Is there anything else Dobby can get you?"
And when Draco looked back at Harry, their eyes locked together. It felt like magic was just surrounding them both, trapping them in a bubble together but they didn't mind. Harry licked his lips when glancing down for a second at Draco's soft-looking kissable lips that he really wants to kiss. those lips are really hard to resist not kissing, but he held back because he didn't think Draco liked him the same way.
"S-she'd be at that moaning girl's bathroom," Draco managed to stumble out the words. He couldn't even remember the name of the ghost that haunts that girl's lavatory. "In Gryffindor Tower. Make a left up here." He directed Harry through the corridors and up to the third floor. "Down here, make a right." Finally, they came across the portrait with the reading woman in a white dress.
George hesitated but held out his arms to Harry. Harry looked up at George for reassurance and when he got a nod, he slowly pulled George's long sleeve top up past his elbow and he sighed sadly. There were ten freshly made cuts, as well as scars from who knows how long. "Oh, George," He said sadly, pulling the older boy into a hug. "How long ago did you do the latest cuts?"
"And what are you going to tell them?" Draco asked softly and brought his hand up to caress Harry's warm tender cheeks with care. He doesn't mind what Harry tells the other Gryffindors he rooms with. As long as they keep it a secret and don't go talking about it to people outside of Hogwarts.
"Well, C'mon," Ron said, and his jaw clenched a little with impatience. He just wanted to get to the Great Hall so he can eat but he wants to travel there with his mate. "We need to go to breakfast. I'm starving."
Harry wore a phantom of the opera Masquerade outfit, with a wig that's has long brown hair put up in a low ponytail at the back with red ribbon, but his Mardi Gras mask was black. And Dean wore a black and dark red
"It's not my loss if I don't want to date rude people," Harry spat back at him. what's wrong with this muggle? Is he that deranged that he can't tell who's taken or not?
Ron shrugged his shoulders. "Meh. Everyone knows that teaching position is supposed to be cursed; guess people are just too scared," he said, watching the table for the feast to pop up so he can dig in.
Harry said nothing and didn't move a muscle. But as he did, he motioned towards the back door before placing his hand on the knob and looking at her sadly. "I'm going to go for a walk... I want to clear my mind."
Harry blushed darker, and he bites his lip when staring at his boyfriend. "So, what exactly happens now?" he asked and decides to lay his head on Draco's shoulder and just let it rest there while he smells the scents of his boyfriend.
‚ÄúIf it isn‚Äôt Harry Potter.‚Äù Harry froze as he heard Gilderoy Lockhart announce his presence. He turned his head to look up at the popular wizard and gave him a small, forced smile.
Draco nodded. Why wouldn't he help? Nobody likes the Dark Lord. Well, nobody except his Aunt Bellatrix, the thousands of death eaters outside, and his father. "Anything you need, I'll be here."
"Harry," said a soft voice. It was Hermione, who continued to stare knowingly at him. "You look like you've seen an angel."
Harry began feeling a bit stupid for not knowing what these are, he started to frown but someone lifted his chin up to meet their Silver eyes. It was Draco. Such pretty eyes and a pretty face. He feels so blessed to have a friend such as Draco who actually cares enough about him to help him earn a higher grade in Potions. All Hermione has done is told him to study multiple times. Ron doesn't help at all either.
"Mate," said Ron, whose mouth fell open in disbelief to what he is seeing. At least he didn't look disgusted or had food in his mouth. "I'm actually rather surprised you never told us this. We knew you were gay, just because we keep catching you stare at every male we walk by."
Draco sighed happily and got up, dusting his pants off. "It's okay," he assured him. It didn't matter anymore. All that mattered if being here with Harry and spending long numbers of time with him alone. "Are you ready for Potions Practice?"
"You too, Blaise," said Harry who smiled back. "I didn't realize you and Neville were together. How long for?"
"Yes?" Hermione asked eagerly and leaned forward. She really wanted to hear what her best friend had to say about their classmate.
"Yes, Joslyn, I know about that," Mum said with a sigh. She then looked over at Draco, raising an eyebrow like she knew something about him. "Um, do I know you from somewhere?"
As soon as class was finished, everyone started walking back up towards the castle and the centaurs all galloped off into the Forbidden Forest. Draco looked at his boyfriend lovingly, giving him a kiss on the nose and hugged him with all his love and affection.
Narcissa smiled sweetly at Harry from the compliment, "Thank you, Harry." Looks like her Draco has found his one and only because she's already warming up to this Gryffindor boy.
"If I wouldn't know better, Draco. I'd say you were scared," Harry taunted while holding down a chuckle.
"Really?" Ron asked, frowning at his older brother. He didn't want to believe this. Can't a male and another male be happy? If a male and female can be happy, then what about a male who's in love with another male? Or a female being in love with a female. "But what if they are happy with the same gender?"
Serpentine shook his little head and he swayed from side to side. "We sssnakesss only bite humansss if they try to hurt usss or if they block our path. We hate being caved in. I actually lossst my brother becaussse of a human. Well, two humansss. They cornered him and ssstabbed him with what they call a ssshovel. I wasss there to sssee it all happensss. I just wanted to sssneak attack the humansss for payback."
"Fine...," Ron said, his direct stare lacked warmth and he rolled his eyes and started gathering his stuff up. Why couldn't the ferret just find his way back to Hogwarts on his own?
Fred looked up at Harry in surprise. He knew there must have been someone little Harry-kins has been eyeing. He wants to know who it is. Are they older? Younger? Taller? Smaller? But he sees Harry as a...bottom. He could be wrong though. "Oh, who is it?"
"Not a girl, Seamus", Harry muttered and shook his head. He looked back down at his parchment after seeing Pansy smiling knowingly at him, and poke Draco on the arm. Darn it! He knew she was going to tell Draco that he had been staring at him.
Harry nodded sadly and looked up into Draco's silver eyes. He didn't want him to worry. Draco stared back into glossy teary eyes. It was heartbreaking seeing such a beautiful soul so broken and depressed, so he closed the gap between them in a soft and slow kiss. Harry began to cry into the kiss, letting the tears fall down his cheeks and one or two tears entered his mouth.
Ron walked his way up to Harry with a dress robe formally presented in its bag as well as a dark blue fedora. "I'm really thankful for what you're doing for me, Harry," he said in a quietish voice as he knew the woman on the other side of the store. He didn't really want anything to do with her even if she seems nice. "However, can I pay you back?"
Harry tried to hold back a laugh; his best mate looked quite stylish in a fedora and not even silly at all. It suited him very well. "Found anything you want?"
Harry woke up with a racing heart one night because of a memory a couple of years back.
"I've got tickets to go see the Quidditch World Cup!" Mr Weasley said, shaking his hands in an almost Jazzy way. Everyone stared at Mr Weasley, wanting to hear more but most importantly if he had enough tickets for the whole family.
Krum nodded, looked at him and hesitated, "Really good friendz?"
Draco's eyes widened in horror, and his tears streamed down his face. Not his other best friend. He can't deal with this...he can't lose another best friend.
He just walked the miles of tents and looking at all the odd-looking tents he walks by. There were small ones, and very large ones. He pondered if Malfoy lived in one of those big tents. They were particularly large tents that looked like they would cost a fortune.
Draco sighed and headed down the stairs just in time to face... "Bet you loved that didn't you, Potter," he sneered, looking from Weasley to Potter. "Famous Harry Potter, can't even go into a bookstore without making the front page."
Draco blushed yet again but not just from the pet name. It was from the realization that a kiss from Harry could turn him back and he smiled like there was no tomorrow. A true love's kiss. He and Harry turned to look at a giggling Ivy. "I believe we should, my darling," he said and watched as Harry's beautiful lips part and a blush spreads up his boyfriend's face.
"You most definitely will," said Harry softy. He stood up and moved a little away from his godson. "I guess I'll see you both soon," he said to the two older witches. Then he turned to face Draco, his smile only widening. "And I'll see you tomorrow, Draco."
That only made the two flustered boys blush even more. Harry tried not to show much emotion but failed. He tried coming up with the worst scenarios he could in his head. "Y-you-re not g-going to t-tell anyone?" he asked shakily, though not knowing of his panic attack coming around. Draco looked at him with an expression of worry, knowing shakiness was apart of panic attacks as Ivy has them at times.
Teddy turned his head to the side and grinned at Harry, who he caught staring at his uncle. Then he leaned forward to whisper into Draco's ear, "Hawwy is staring at you."
Harry smiled at the thought of Draco, comparing him with Cedric. Why he was doing that? He had no idea. He turned and left for Gryffindor common room to work on one of his essays, even though he wanted to go and find Draco to have a chat with him.
Harry nodded and gave Draco a forced smile. "Alright," he said as he looked down at the floor again. He wasn't really hungry, so he let Draco take him down to the Grand Hall. As they walked on and on through the corridors of the school, they saw a few students on rollerblades and scooters racing each other through the hallways. Harry knew what rollerblades and scooters are but Draco didn't. Harry also knew they were muggle-borns and half-bloods who owned those muggle contraptions because of what Pureblood would know of muggle items. Besides Ivy, of course.
Harry watched the potion Hermione brewed, noticing there were small swirls rising from the liquid. He leant over and took a whiff of the smell which he smelt citrus, Quidditch, Treacle Tart, and vanilla. He didn't know who he was smelling but recognized the smells from somewhere. He tried to remember where he had last smelled the scents. The library's secret room. He was confused though, asking himself how the room could smell so amazing even if it was just that, a room.
"Bloody hell!" Ron dropped the snowballs he had, and they all fell with a 'splat' on the floor, crumbling to pieces. What he had just seen or was about to see made him drop all the snowballs he was going to throw at Harry, Ivy and Malfoy. He was shocked, surprised but also confused. How did he not see this coming? He knew the two had become friends, well that's what he thought. A truce agreeing to friendship, or even more.
"Great!" Harry said excitedly, already rushing into the Lounge room. He walked over to the fireplace, threw some Floo Powder in, and muttered the Headmasters office. The orange flames turned green and Harry crouched down to get a closer look at the office. "Professor? It's me, Harry! Are you there?"
Harry stopped laughing and looked at his two best friends who stared right back at him.
"Harry's looking your way again," Ivy whispered to him and couldn't hold down a giggle. Merlin's Beard she loves these two boys who are obviously liking each other but don't see it. But that's the problem. Why don't they see that they both are oblivious to liking each other? It just gets so frustrating. She just wants to push those two together to make them hug or even better kiss.
Harry hid behind a statue of a wizard when he got closer to the Grand Hall and put his Invisibility cloak over himself. Then with the invisibility cloak covering him, he walked into the Grand Hall and over to the Slytherin table and slipped the blade into Ivy's book bag which dangled from her shoulder. He couldn't help but listen to the conversation that was going on with Ivy, Draco and Pansy.
"I-... Um..." stuttered Harry, not knowing what to say.
Ivy frowned at him and nodded. That's all she wanted to hear pretty much. Anything else would be too triggering for her. "Does anybody else know of this, Harry?" she asked him solemnly. "Do you talk to anybody about this?"
"Harry, we were just heading down to the Slytherin common room," she said and wondered if she could get her cousin and Harry locked into a room together. She gave him a mischievous smile and wiped some snow off her black jumper which she missed before. "Did you want to come?"
*****
"Let's go and owl it to her," said Harry with a smile towards Draco. The smile is only at Draco because he loved how nice Draco was being with spending his money on someone else's needs. "It will probably reach her by Breakfast tomorrow morning."
Ivy and Pansy smiled warmly at their best friend and watched him leave the Great Hall after Harry. The excitement rushed through their bodies and they just wanted to get up themselves and follow Draco to wherever he goes thinking they might stumble onto something intriguing.
"I love you too," Draco said, closing his eyes. But then he snapped his eyes open and reached over to his pants which still lay on the bed. He grabbed the small red velvet item in one of the pockets, beamed at it and showed it to Harry. "Harry James Potter." He opened the little box and smiled at Harry's surprised reaction. "I remember the first time I saw your face. I had to tie a string around my heart because like a balloon it was floating away."
Bagman held his wand to his throat and mumbled something, and then he spoke in a loud voice. "Welcome all to the first task, our contestants will be trying to grab the golden egg from the dragon's nest," he told them all. "It's a tricky job to do, having to distract a dragon for a short period of time. Let's see how lucky our contestants are with these dragons. Let the tournament begin!"
Draco, on the other hand, knew what his cousin was saying in French. He blushed redder - if that is possible. But at least nobody could understand her beside him and Blaise. "Tu sais que je peux te comprendre, non?" ("You know I can understand you, right?")
Harry tries wiping away the tears, but they just keep on falling from his eyes. Its useless. His life is useless. There's nothing to live for when he's lonely and punished by his Uncle and bullied by his cousin. He cupped his hands in the lake and splashed his face with the chilly water, hoping by doing so it would erase any traces that he's been crying. He could still feel the tears running down his face... unless it was the water, but he really didn't care right now.
"Yeah, and as much as I love magic and the wizarding world, I also spend my time with muggle things," Ivy told them, and she tore apart her croissant to eat with a simple tug. "For example: phones, muggle toys, devices and muggle books."
Draco Malfoy gets his very first, unexpected kiss by his crush.
They started walking along the corridors, not knowing where they were headed but they knew they were going up. "Good!" Harry kissed Draco on the cheek and started running off. Draco chuckled and ran after his boyfriend. They both ran down the corridors laughing and trying to outrun the other until Professor McGonagall stopped them.
Harry sneezed but didn't know why. It was a little cold in here actually and there wasn't any dust to be found. "This place truly is amazing!" he said as he explored the place but made sure not to touch anything that could be...cursed. But why would there be anything that's cursed in the bedroom?
Christina snorted at the mention of food. But her tummy rumbled. All this running and chasing was making her hungry. She couldn't wait until Harry and the others have rounded up all the Purebloods and half-bloods who don't know what's going on, only that their friends are being 'killed'. She was hungry for candied apples, gummy eyeballs, and zombie cupcakes.
"Yeah, that sounds about right," said Harry, agreeing with them all. But when hearing Dean and Seamus say how much they care for him really got to him. Do they actually care for him or are they just saying it to make him feel better from the event he participated in? "Can I please go and rest?" he added as he knows he needs to rest right now. He honestly just wants to think back to the time when Draco kissed his cheek. "Merlin knows I need it." He yawned, taking off his dirty clothes whilst replacing them with his school robes and flopping onto his bed.
"Thank you for everything, Ivy," Draco repeated, but in English. He looked behind him at Harry and gave a smile. When Harry smiled back at him, he looked ahead at him back at his cousin. "And I mean it."
Draco twirled Harry around with a smile, and he whispered right into his ear, "Shut up and dance with me, Potter." Harry felt himself blush and let Draco lead in the dance. The next thing he knew Draco was holding onto both of his hands, he was leaning back onto Draco's chest and was swinging side to side.
"Harry?" Neville asked, furrowing his eyebrows in confusion. "Why are you holding Malfoy's hand?"
Professor McGonagall fiddled with an old gramophone in the centre of the room, then turned around to face the students. "As I am aware, you all are puzzled to why you're here," she started, ignoring how bored most of the students looked. "This is for the Yule Ball; we'll be practising dancing with partners as it is house etiquette."
Cho felt a little impatient in waiting for two rivals to kiss, so she sighed and leaned her head against the wall. "Do you think we should go over and pretend we just saw them?" she whispered to her best friend, a little curiously as she wanted these two to just... get it over with!
"Who wouldn't?" Pansy said back with a smirk. "You do know who David Tennant is, don't you?"
Draco‚Äôs eyes opened, and Harry stared into stunningly silver eyes. Such beautiful silver eyes, they were almost like silver tinsel and baubles on a green Christmas fir tree. The blonde Slytherin leaned away from the kiss, but his lips were still parted a little like he couldn‚Äôt believe what happened. Who he kissed, it was more like. It was his first kiss after all, and it was stolen by the Saviour of the Wizarding World. He just couldn‚Äôt believe it at all so he pinched himself in the arm.
Draco gave her another warm smile, also wishing that he could stay. "Of course, I will see if any owls can fly all the way over here. If not, then I will just come by some time or I can use what you call 'the post'."
"Yes, we shall," Harry replied as he turned around to face Draco. "But, which way?" He noticed that Draco's silver eyes had a kind of watery look to them and he frowned. He felt sorry for the Slytherin, having to see the nightmare of a monster during the night where he could be safe, and sound tucked away in bed. He gave Draco's arms a squeeze as he stared into silver eyes, and those silver eyes stared back at him. "Hey. It's going to be alright," he said softly in a reassuring way. "We can get through this together, and if it takes a whole night just to get out of the forest, I'm glad it's with you."
"Merry Christmas, Harry!" Draco said with a big warm smile and his cheeks became warm as he sees Harry's fluffy messy hair all messed up. He wondered how Harry could just leave Weasel easily and come over to sit with them.
"Bloody-" Pansy began, but the door that they just came through began to shake. No, it was the doorknob. Someone was coming in. The door opened. The three Slytherin teenagers whimpered and backed away.
Harry shook his head at the thought of Rowena ever having a ghost. How do ghosts become... ghosts? It's a worldwide conspiracy theory. "Not likely."
They both screamed at the blood stain on their fellow Ravenclaw's pink pyjama top, showing that she was stabbed and pointed their wands at the younger girl. They were trying to find the right spell to use for this... girl.
Harry smiled back. He knew the song well, so he sang,
Harry nodded slightly with a small fake smile, sad that Draco must leave but he hopes he'll be seeing him soon. "Thank you for this incredible morning and I hope we will see each other again sometime today."
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see it?‚Äù Harry asks him sadly, thinking he is probably going crazy. But the only thing keeping him sane is that he can feel the creature, whatever it is. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see this bat-looking horse?‚Äù
"Yeah, and?" Draco asked her with raised eyebrows. He was uncertain what she wanted him to do about it. What could he do? He has a feeling Harry hasn't told Granger or Weasel about their friendship so that would be a problem if he just goes up there and asks him out. Unless Harry did tell them, and he wouldn't be mad at all. It's Harry's decision whether he wants to tell his friends or not and if he trusts them enough to not spill it out to the world. "What am I supposed to do about it? Ask him out or something?"
Harry and Draco glided effortlessly around the floor in the waltz, their actions were smooth and confident like they've been soulmates in their past lives and have waltzed together before. They were confident with dancing in front of the many 4th to seventh-year students, they didn't even choose to acknowledge their fellow students dancing around them. It was just Harry and Draco. Draco and Harry. Dancing as one, and dancing alone.
Seamus' blush deepened in colour from the compliment and the kiss. He smiled at his boyfriend and reaches up to bring Dean's hands down so he could intertwine them with his own. "Is bre√° liom t√∫, a Dh√©an," he spoke in his native language which confused Harry and Hermione.
"And why is that?" George then asked her with a charming smile, wanting to know why she's not available for at least him or just his twin. A guy wants to know, especially if the girl's so damn hot.
Harry knew that Hermione had a point, but he just didn't believe that such an incredible guy like Draco would love someone like himself. Someone who's a freak, who cuts himself, who hates himself, who wants to die. It was just unbelievable. Who would like a freak like himself? He shouldn't be thinking this darkly, but the thoughts just took over. "Maybe he did it for a joke, Hermione," he said a little wretchedly as they entered the common room from the portrait after Hermione said the password.
Harry shook his head. He hasn't had that kind of thought before. It's always just blowjobs. "We haven't had that kind of sex yet," he told him and smiled at the thought. But he always keeps thinking if he and Draco have taken it too far at times. "But was it okay to give each other a blowjob back then when he and I had been dating since Christmas? Or was it too early?"
He just stood there, admiring the class in front of him. He looked over at Harry who seemed to be doing quite a good job at his own potion. Although, he was looking rather sad. Draco knew Harry hasn't been himself lately, he's asked the boy about it, but he has only said the familiar words of 'I'm Fine'. He walked up to Harry and watched him closely with a smile.
Draco sighed lightly, glad to still have Ivy with him and Harry and that she wasn't... dead. "Thank you, Professors," he replied soberly as he needed to thank them for being here with Ivy. He then got up with Harry and walked out of the Hospital Wing hand in hand with Harry. When they little were far away from the Hospital Wing, Draco pulled Harry into a hug and started sobbing uncontrollably in his arms.
The professor furrowed his eyebrows at his class, giving them a stern look. "Now, this is a dangerous charm that requires a lot of concentration. Watch my wand movements then practice the spell." The professor levitated cages with rats in them and gave one to each of his students. The last rat he put on his desk and pointed his wand at it, "Confundo!" The rat sniffed the cage then fluffed up into a ball of fur, screeching at the cage. It then tried to mimic cat noises.
Harry remembered those words coming from Professor Lupin's mouth but a little simpler. He nodded at what Draco told him about the Treacle Tart, understanding how gross it is to reach into somewhere and feel something disgusting and mushy. "Thanks, Draco," he said and took a bite of the deliciously sour green apple. "How did you know I like Treacle Tarts?"
Harry and Draco were walking around the castle for what felt like hours, looking for a place to go by themselves when it hit them, straight in the face. It literally hit them. "Oww!" Harry and Draco both winced, rubbing at their foreheads.
Draco yawned a little when they were back inside the warm castle corridors. He didn't feel like walking all the way down to the Slytherin common room. "Isn't the transfiguration courtyard closer to us than our own house dormitories?"
Draco nodded and ended the hug with her. He took a step back as he said, "Je connais. Merci d'avoir fait √ßa. Je ne pense pas que j'aurais m√™me pu √™tre assez proche d'Harry cette ann√©e si ce n'√©tait pas pour toi." ("I know. Thank you for doing this. I don't think I'd be able to have even gotten close enough to Harry this year if it weren't for you.")
"No, I highly doubt that," Draco said with a shake of his head and walked up closer to the doors. He studied the doors, seeing the icons of the raven, badger, and lion. Where was the Slytherin one if these really were the bedrooms of the founders? "Didn't Rowena and Godric sleep in their towers and Helga slept in the basement?"
Harry frowned at the snake. He just realized how alike snakes are to humans. They both have family that they love and protect. "I'm sssorry for your losss, SSSerpentine. I never knew."
Harry and Draco stood hand in hand in front of the closed door of the Great Hall. They both were nervous, about to come out to the entire school. Then Harry decided to open the doors with one light push. The brown large wooden doors opened up into the Great Hall, and they walked through to the Slytherin table. A few gasps were heard, and a few giggles. Harry and Draco didn't care what the others thought about them. It wasn't any of their business anyway.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky I didn‚Äôt slap you in the face, Potter,‚Äù Draco drawled but gave Harry‚Äôs hand a squeeze and intertwined them together. A shockwave of electricity shot through him, but it wasn‚Äôt an unpleasant shot. It was very nice and felt like he was safe and sound at Malfoy Manor.
Dudley looked shocked, but then he glared at Mrs Figg. "Who are you to tell me what to do?" he spat viciously but kept his tone down. "You're not my mother!"
Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked into the classroom and chose where to sit. They had Transfigurations with the Ravenclaws. Ron sat next to Harry, which surprised Harry a little. They were next to where Dean and Seamus sat. Hermione of course, decided to sit on her own so she wouldn't be distracted by her friends.
"And what if Harry and I are naked in bed?" Draco asked and sounded quite amused. He'd like to know what Potter's skin feels like under his own, the grunts he'll make during sex and the moans. Okay, he knows he's going a bit too far there. They haven't even been on their first date yet. "Would you still hunt me down and drag my naked ass out of there?"
Hermione hit Ron on the shoulder with her book, disliking his attitude. "Ron! He may be a g-... rude, but it doesn't mean you can just say that about someone. You know, you're now sounding exactly like him!"
Draco nodded and Harry smiled back. They entered the maze, discovering a little statue of Helga Hufflepuff comforting some person who looked sad. A little wary about the statue, they walked and walked until the maze started to form two different lanes leading away from each other. This meant the boys had to split up.
Draco sighed as he did not really have or know of any games. Well, except for truth or dare but honestly, he would be wanting to just say 'I dare you to kiss me'. "I honestly don't know. Know any games?"
Draco nodded slightly and narrowed his eyes at the two Gryffindors just to look a little intimidating. He didn't know how else he could come by this topic since he's already dating Harry. "No one can know about this."
Harry shrugs lightly and looks up at him, still not believing his very eyes that this blonde Slytherin had asked him out and that he likes him the same way. "If you have any romantic but classic date ideas then go ahead," he said in a silent voice and wriggled a little in the Slytherin's embrace. He feels so right like this is where he was meant to be, in Draco's arms. "I love a surprise, Draco. So, surprise me."
"Father is either at work in the Ministry or in his study now-a-days," said Draco, looking up at the window of Malfoy Manor which he knows is his father's study. He wondered if his father was there and watching him and Harry but dear Merlin he hopes not. He took a sip of his wine and looked back at Harry. He grunted as a raindrop fell on his forehead and he wiped it off. This was meant to be a happy, sunny bright day today. Not turn into a complete stormy day. can't it just go away and come back tomorrow?
Lavender blushed and nodded, looking down at the ground, clearly deep in thought yet again. "Anyway... I should go," she said awkwardly, pushing a strand of her dirty blonde hair behind her ear and then pointed behind her. She walked backwards for a few seconds then turned around and started walking to her next class.
Harry rubbed at his face a little bit, but then loosely crossed his arms and led her over to a bunch of trees. "So... um, I asked Fred to be my Yule Ball partner," he told her, and he watched as Hermione shook her head and knew it was because of disappointment. She opened her mouth to speak but Harry cut her off, "I know, I know. You're disappointed that it wasn't Draco I asked but... Fred actually asked me to go find Draco and ask him so that's what I did."
Potter laughed and Draco couldn't help but also give a small chuckle. "Don't you have a Dark Lord to defeat, Potter?" he asked while holding down his fear of how today might end. He would hate if the Dark Lord won this war. What would happen to Hogwarts? What would happen to Potter?
Harry raised an eyebrow at her out of curiosity but didn't want to somehow anger her anymore, so he followed her. What he didn't expect was to be pushed up onto the stage by her.
Harry gasped silently and blushed, not because of Teddy, obviously, but from Draco's kiss. Those soft, warm lips of Draco's left him speechless and the two mothers were giggling at him. He could have accidentally dropped Teddy, but he was glad he didn't. He just wanted to grab Draco's face and just kiss it, but he wanted his first kiss with Draco to be something to really remember, something romantic.
Harry started to blush, he looked over to where Hermione and Ron were. They were at a pretty good distance away, so if he wanted to tell Sirius anything he could. "Uhm... N-no?" he stuttered. Darn it! That would give him away for sure.
"You know, you're starting to act like a Gryffindor, Draco," Harry admits and gives the Slytherin a little playful poke in the arm. Draco starts laughing and his cheeks pinken with pleasure at what Harry's saying.
But Harry felt it would be better if he carried it around in case, he would see her in the corridors and give it back to her. He knew that sounded very...wrong but he knew what it was like to be in pain. So, he opened up the bedside table drawer, got Ivy's blade out, also picked up his invisibility cloak in case of need and put it in his robe pocket. Harry just carried the two items in his pocket the rest of the day until he could find Ivy.
Harry stood in front of a mound with Hermione, making a trail of gold lead towards them. It took a few minutes but a Niffler had crawled its way out of a mound and followed Harry's gold trail while sniffing the gold to make sure it's real. The Niffler collected every bit of gold and put it in its pouch. As it rounded a corner, collecting the last bits of gold, Harry had grabbed it. He held the Niffler to his chest, stroking it softly and slowly.
"Alright! Wheeee!" and off went Nick, running towards the man at the Gym equipment with his arms waving in the air.
"No, I won't give your food back," Harry said and gave Hermione a mischievous smile. He could do this all day if he must. He would just to make her say that these together times with Draco aren't dates although the thought really excited him. "And no, they're not dates. We just like to spend time together as friends."
In the Room of Requirement.
He closed his eyes and deepened the kiss, running his tongue across Potter's lips for entrance. It seemed Potter didn't know what to do net. Of course, he should have known. Harry Potter doesn't know how to French kiss. He'll just have to teach him. He pried Potter's mouth open and inserted his tongue, tasting the boy and he damned well was liking it. He felt and heard Potter gasp as he entered his tongue into Potter's mouth, it was adorable and funny at the same time.
"Ravenclaw bedroom," said Draco and he blew the strand of hair out of his eyes, while Harry watched him without blinking. Draco didn't want to sleep in a yellow room full of plants that could strangle him in his sleep. That's what he thought though. "We can search for the others some other time."
"Awww!" Luna and Ginny said together, placing a hand over their hearts in awe. Who knew going overseas can be so nice for a couple. It would be like a honeymoon.
"He's kicking," Draco said, and even Harry could see the little indentation in Draco's belly as their baby made himself known. "He's kicking."
Harry's baby, though, Harry's baby was going to see nature from its window, and be able to play in the garden and wherever it wanted, and it was going to be perfect.
"Magical fucking shitballs," Pansy said. "You've got a baby."
"I should hope not," Hermione said sharply.
And then, they'd eaten.
"We're there," they tell me. "Of course we are. Where else would we be?" Exactly.
"He's scared of the Roomba," Harry Potts tells me, providing Draco with a cup of coffee in a reusable cup. I'm not sure if he's joking. Harry's role in Draco's life is somewhat fluid and Malfoy chooses not to provide clarity. They are their own category on the popular fan fiction site
"I think maybe‚Ä¶ you might have to be."
"Are you looking for anything in particular?"
"Draco needs to get some rest," the healer said. "You can wait with the baby in a separate room. We've prepared one for you both."
"Going to have to get used to that pretty quickly," Harry said. "Daddy. Or something similar."
"Yes," Draco called back. "Mostly."
Draco tilts his chin up in her general direction. His cheekbones, combined with the sunlight and his general matinee idol ambience, combine to make something magical. It really is the worst.
Pansy sticks her tongue out at him, then follows Draco into the bedroom. She inspects the view out of the bedroom window. "The sun must wake you up really early in here."
Draco had taken all of his things with him when he'd come away with Harry, every last scrap of his belongings, even his rolls of toilet paper and the chipped, old mug he had his tea in. But Harry had watched him wrap those two tiny little figurines in his socks, gentle and careful and protective of them. Then, when they'd unpacked at the new place, at the little house Harry had found for them so that Draco could recover and get well, and where the two of them could learn to manage their bond, Draco had cleaned the mantelpiece first, rubbing it down so that the dust and the dirt was gone. He'd put the little fox and the fawn there, pride of place.
Draco looked very alone, all of a sudden. "All right," he said, and Harry didn't know what to say to that, so he nodded, and left.
Harry would like a beer and for the world to turn itself back the right way up, but apparently that wasn't going to happen any time soon. He said yes to the tea and started unwinding his scarf and unbuttoning his cloak.
The days dragged on. The weather was sweltering, and Draco slept longer. They were losing him. Harry held his hand and refused to sleep and only ate when one of them forced a plate in front of him. Their research continued long into the night.
"I think you're going to be a good dad," she said. "I don't know if you thought that that wasn't what I was saying."
"I offered him a biscuit," Harry said, a little uncomfortably. "I had a packet of ginger nuts."
"I'm working," Harry said, putting down his tea cup. Draco has tea cups. Harry has mugs. Why he was round at Draco's was a question he doesn't want to think about too much, but he'd finished the nursery and he sort of wanted to tell
Harry let himself smile. "Got us here, didn't it? It got us him."
"Don't," he said, as Harry rested his forehead against his. "Please don't."
He can't mean his very first phone, not in this 21st century world of smartphones and Twitter, but Malfoy doesn't comment. He doesn't comment on much, it turns out, although he does look spectacular in each of the pairs of jeans he models for us, our stylist choosing to forego the option of shirts when it turns out Malfoy is more than happy going topless and barefoot. Malfoy is always barefoot.
"Hello," Harry said.
"Fuck," Harry said.
It had been cold and damp when Harry had found him, both inside and outside, and Draco's room  wasn't warm enough. It had two blankets on the bed but no sheet, and his clothes had been folded into the bottom of a wardrobe with only one door and no hangers. There had been a couple of battered and falling apart books on the floor by the bed; bits and pieces from a life half lived. There was soap and a flannel and a towel on the shelf by the door, some washing powder and some biscuits and some tea bags next to it. An old electric kettle plugged in by the window. And then, on the bedside table, next to an alarm clock, two tiny little china figurines. One was a fox, little and orange and curled up, and the other, an orange-beige fawn with a chipped ear and a shiny nose.
"My eyes are up here, Potter," Draco said.
Draco opened it when they'd gone. It was a tiny rabbit figurine with a chipped paw. He didn't let go of it, and maybe only Harry could see that his eyes were wet.
Draco nodded, lacing his fingers with Harry's. "Tell me about how we're happy."
Like Robert Pattinson before him, occasionally Malfoy appears to be bewilderingly confused by existing in society. It makes for entertaining content. In an interview with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, Malfoy pretends not to know who The Beatles or One Direction are. It is, of course, unlikely that Draco Malfoy is an alien in the manner of Ford Prefect from Douglas Adams'
"I can't," Draco said, stony-faced, and he held on tight to Harry's hand and didn't look away from the TV.
"I wasn't very nice to her. At least I wasn't the first two times. The third time she brought me breakfast and practically bustled her way inside."
Harry kept thinking about Draco, quiet and still in his high-backed chair, saying he wouldn't subject a child to the childhood he'd had. "Yeah," he said, after a while.
"You shock me."
Later, when Draco was awake again, and Harry had helped him downstairs, and Hermione and Ron watched on with barely disguised horror, Sheila came in from the kitchen. "I've done the washing up," she said. "Sorted out your fridge. Come over for your lunch tomorrow, the pair of you. We'll have a chat." It was a nice way of saying,
"Jonny doesn't know me, and he's better off for it." He leaned in and pressed a kiss to Harry's mouth. "You're both better off for it."
Ron elbowed him back, but then he sighed. "Now's the bit where you get mad at me. I need you to tell Mum. You can't spring this on her in a couple of months when the baby's born and you're a part-time dad. She'll be gutted, mate. For a start you won't have given her any time to knit."
"Mate," Ron said, shaking his head. "Mate."
"Ron's coming later," she said. "He's bringing cake and a roast chicken."
"Hullo, old thing," Draco says, coming in from his bedroom. "Is there any ginger beer going?"
It is hard to know what to make of Draco Malfoy. If I only looked at his Instagram posts, I'd expect nothing more than a moody, half-naked glance into the middle distance demonstrating impeccable cheekbones, a penchant for not buttoning up his clothes if at all possible, and a possible deal with the devil to ensure he only ever be photographed in perfect light. His Tumblr is an impossibly curated show home for an aesthetic that won't be satisfied with anything less than perfection. His TikTok account shows a lean towards the dry, with regular, weekly videos (soundtracked by the kind of music not out of place on a mid-00s
"Me too," Harry said. "But you don't need to worry. I've got it all sorted out."
"This is a terrible idea," Draco said, pacing the entrance hall.
"Of course not."
"His first day of Hogwarts, there's just me and you looking in different directions, sure in the knowledge that we love each other and at some point it'll just happen by itself."
"A completely random but seemingly quite lucky guess," Hermione said, sitting down on the sofa. The house she and Ron shared was full of Weasley blankets and bookshelves and rather too much orange. "There you go."
Draco smiled. "If it is this," he said carefully, looking down at their entwined snakes, the new mark, his body's new master, "I'd rather this did, than what was there before. I'd rather die with this than what was there before."
, but occasionally it is easier to believe that this is true than the alternative, which is that he really doesn't know who The Beatles are. I ask him about it in between jeans shots.
Harry is, as always, jealous, although not of Draco's bare feet, which just make him feel cold.
"He's a bit of all right," Harry said. There was a pause. "I really do love you, you know. Like, a lot. A lot, a lot."
Hermione was in the kitchen. She came out carrying a cup of tea. "Kettle's just boiled," she said. "If either of you want tea."
"Yes," Draco said, without going into any more detail. Ironically, detail would have been helpful, given that Harry was still at the very start of his learning curve about male pregnancy. "You're going to be a father."
Their baby was the length of a carrot.
Ron rolled his eyes. "Your moonlight activities."
"Are you sure? About not wanting to bring it up?"
And Harry, surprising even himself, felt his guard crumble, and he started to cry.
Harry didn't kiss him. He didn't do anything. "I wish we could," he said finally, and Draco made a strangled, desperate sound in the back of his throat.
The mute part lasted approximately 2.5 seconds, and Harry wasn't going to lie, he wished it was longer.
"Indeed," Draco said.
"I can see," Harry said.
Harry barely stopped for shoes and socks.
"According to my book, it's the size of our baby," Harry said, and for a moment, Draco's face stilled, like he was carved out of stone.
"I'm glad we're friends again," Hermione said. "I hate falling out with you."
Draco was shaking. "Harry," he said.
"I'm indulging myself in a range of classic mid-century culture," Draco says, coming back out with a glass of chilled ginger beer and his un-lit pipe, and sweeping past them both on his way back to his bedroom. He's wearing a wide-legged pinstripe trouser, a pale shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and a sweater vest. They're all pristine. Creases disappear in sheer horror when they see Draco coming.
Draco smiled. He looked pale and exhausted and hollow. "Tell me about our house," he said. "Tell me about the garden and how we'll live there forever and grow old and have tea outside on the patio."
"I like a scale you can measure against. And I don't want to go anywhere. I want to stay here, with you. I don't want to stay in your spare room anymore. I want to stay with you. I want to learn how we can be a family so we don't fuck him up like we're fucked up."
Draco very carefully sat down in a neat armchair. "I know what I'm going to do," he said. He looked at Harry. "I'm going to have this baby. And then I am not going to bring this baby up."
It began, like a lot of things in Harry's life, with Hermione staring at him in mute disbelief.
"I had everything and I was unhappy," Draco said. "I was so fucking unhappy. I have nothing to give him. I'll just teach him how to be a bully and how to take and how to not be able to figure out what the right fucking thing to do is."
"That's my boy," Harry said softly, once Jonny was done with his bottle. He leaned down to kiss the top of Jonny's head before settling him against his chest to rub his back, holding him gently. "Aren't you a good boy? Such a good boy."
"Come on, Harry. You can't ignore this. You're going to have to step up and look after your child sometimes," Hermione said, leaning over to tap him on the knee. "You need to start thinking about where they're going to sleep, what you need to buy to look after them, all that sort of stuff."
"Is that a word?"
There was a strangled sort of a noise from where Draco was sitting. "And I told you I wanted Jonny and you, that was the same thing. You know I love you."
"One day, someone at the ministry is going to get a mobile phone," Hermione says, "and then you'll be grateful for all my undercover work on Tumblr. Honestly, I cannot believe that in my actual adult life I've had to create a whole second personality, and a Tumblr account, just so I can literally go around debunking all those people taking your videos apart and saying you're a magician. Last week I had someone send me three anonymous asks telling me they're going to have me banned from the Magic Circle. I'm not even
Draco grinned at him. "We'd have got there in the end."
"What's wrong with him?" Hermione asked, once Harry had thrown caution to the wind and apparated Draco home and got him in bed, and resting. Sheila was there too, Tommy behind her, and Tommy went out into the garden to give the flower beds a going over whilst Sheila made them tea.
"Well, that one's just going to go on and on, isn't it?" Harry said, taking another bite of his pasty. "Surely at some point it'll grow old."
"It's less than six weeks," Harry said. "Just so you know. It's not two months."
"So," Draco had said, turning up on Harry's doorstep at 8.15am on a Saturday morning, "I believe we may have to deal with the lasting impact of our moonlit madness."
I ask Malfoy, finally, if there's anything he'd change about himself. He stares into the middle distance for a while. His cigarette burns down. I realise I haven't seen him smoke any of the cigarettes he's been holding throughout our interview.
Ron opened his mouth to make the appropriate joke, but Hermione hit him with a cushion and Harry allowed himself permission to consider the joke made.
Draco appeared to be in some kind of dark green silk pyjama set.
"So to say thanks, you had sex by the light of the moon. Wow."
Harry - who for a moment had got distracted remembering the hot, drunken flush of that evening, of Draco with his head tipped back, sweat beading across his skin, lost in himself - blinked. "I was drunk," he said, because it was the only thing to be said.
"The same," Harry said. "I didn't know where you were."
"Weasley," Draco said coldly. Five minutes ago he'd been perfectly cordial, sharing the results of his most recent healer appointment with Harry and listing the potions he'd been prescribed to protect their baby against a selection of magical and muggle maladies so that Harry could add them to his list of important things he might need to know in the future. Now Draco seemed almost carved out of ice.
Harry, for want of something better to do, stayed where he was, and kept holding on.
Narcissa was there when Harry woke up, her face pale.
Hermione was getting a little red around the cheekbones, which did not bode well for any of them. "I had written a letter already," she said, "because PSHE is just as valid on a wizarding curriculum as a Muggle one. This just goes to show I'm right, and that I need to write another letter."
In his defence, he really had been very, very drunk, it had been raining, and his schooldays had mostly been concerned with Voldemort and his followers trying to kill him whenever he turned a corner. He hadn't had much chance to consider how gay he was until everything had all calmed down, and by that point he'd been 22 and in general a bit bewildered by not being constantly at war or being shoved onto a podium somewhere. It wasn't entirely his fault that by that point he'd missed the leaflet filled with all the things he was supposed to know by then, like, apparently, not shagging on a full moon and being aware of the fucking moon cycle in the first place.
"I can't believe you didn't know."
"Hi, Hermione," he called, trying not to be too loud.
Harry buried his face in her shoulder again. "Oh god. I am."
Harry reached out and took Draco's hand. He laced their fingers together. "You're the bravest person I know," he said. He swallowed. "It doesn't make you right, though."
Harry looked up. Draco was smiling. "Did it‚Äî"
"Yeah," Harry said, "and I hated you for it."
you knocked someone up," Ron said. "Not a terrible idea to share the information before the, you know‚Äî" he went a bit red‚Äî "impregnating."
Draco was gone when Harry went to check his bedroom after Jonny had fallen asleep again. The bed was made, but the extra blanket was gone, which made Harry hope that Draco was just downstairs.
series. At the request of Malfoy, Potts explains things like how to put bread in the toaster, and how to microwave scrambled eggs. Their intended audience might, perhaps, be aliens. Draco remains straight faced and inquisitive throughout. So far, Roombas have not featured in his
Draco managed to look incredulous at the same time as weeping, which Harry thought he probably deserved. "How are you still alive?"
He should tell Hermione and Ron how things were going to play out, because it wasn't like they weren't going to find out, but he couldn't. He just couldn't.
"Think it might have been the bottle of firewhisky," Draco said, as the doorbell rang. He kissed Harry again, then straightened up and went over to answer the door.
"Hermione's holding our baby hostage until we articulate our feelings," Harry said, not meeting Draco's eyes.
"Yes," Draco said. "I've made my decision. This baby isn't having my childhood over again and it's the only one I can offer. So the baby will have to go somewhere else. To someone else."
Harry took a bite of his cheese and onion pasty. "Which things?"
"Come on," Harry said. "I'll tell you a secret about me in return."
"Oh my god," Hermione said. "I'm going to set fire to you."
Ron, to his credit, didn't say anything that would make Harry feel like he wanted to punch a wall. "Have you heard from him?"
"Um‚Äî" Harry said, because it wasn't just that he'd forgotten he was cooking tonight, it was also that‚Äî
Draco glanced at him, then down at his stomach. "Come feel."
"Put your wands down," Harry said. He squeezed Draco's hand. It was cold and clammy.
Draco shook his head minutely, and Harry shut up for a moment.
Later, when Draco didn't get better, and his exhaustion got worse and the shake in his fingertips got more pronounced, Harry found him others. A little badger with a pink nose, a labrador puppy, a sheepdog to add to his collection. Little animal figures that found their way onto the mantelpiece, whilst Draco's original two made it upstairs and onto his bedside table.
"Uh-huh," she says.
Draco looked at him. "The baby is very tiny."
"Your hair's always a mess," Draco said. "I don't know why I put up with it."
"Yes," he said softly, "and I can't stop it."
Draco laced his fingers with Harry's. "Do you think we should try and talk more?"
Behind him, Draco's breath caught, but Harry busied himself spooning sugar into his tea, and didn't look back.
"I know," she said. "But it doesn't mean you don't have to. Go and have a shower and I'll make you a sandwich."
"Yeah," Draco said. They were still holding hands. "Apart from Jonny."
"Get up, you've knocked that boy up and now you're going to deal with it."
"Perhaps," Draco said.
"Neither would you. You love him. We both do."
"It's okay if you don't like them," he told Harry. "I can move them."
Their baby was about to be the size of a watermelon. Draco wasn't sleeping and his back hurt and he permanently looked like he was on the edge of tears. Harry had taken to going over in the evenings and putting the telly on so they could watch ridiculous mysteries and he could hold Draco's hand and pretend not to see him cry. Harry had never really imagined having a family of his own, beyond a nebulous, sort of cloudy future plan to be normal in a way he never had been growing up, but he wasn't entirely sure that a tearful, hormonal Draco Malfoy who refused to talk about anything but the TV had featured anywhere in his plans.
," as he stared out of the window at the full moon.
"Charlie doesn't like girls," Ron said.
He made the obligatory complaints, but if he was honest, he was exhausted. He was asleep before Molly had even come back with the tea.
"Bet he's desperate for him to be born now. Excited to meet him, I'm sure."
Draco stopped pushing his pasta around his plate. He didn't look up. "Don't call him after anyone. Don't call him anything he has to live up to. Don't call him anything which singles him out. Give him the best chance you can."
You didn't get this picking someone up in Yates' Wine Lodge on a Friday night.
