“I do not look like that,” Harry says, then, when Draco just laughs, repeats his objection even louder.
“Because you don’t want me to know,” Blaise replied. “If it was just sleep, you’d tell me. And no one knows where you go at night, not even Pansy.”
“I am maybe one singular second behind you,” Draco says, crawling in after him. Harry’s bed is very squishy and he is absolutely flabbergasted that this is just something he gets to know now. “Take your shirt off.”
He sends Beaky (full name Buckbeak 2), his bonkers-looking brown screech owl, out with the letter, and then immediately wonders why he chose to write the letter from the point of view of a complete pillock. Considering that it’s too late to try again, he returns to answering the rest of his post, which includes a four page missive from Luna and a few vacation photos from Neville that prominently feature mushrooms.
“Oh,” Harry says, faintly recognizing the bottle. He keeps finding his gaze pulled back to Draco’s lips, where the red makes his cupid bow even sharper.
The forest greeted him with eager arms like she’d missed him, reaching down with her limbs to brush his head and entwine in his hair. Harry smiled up at the tangled branches, feeling the warmth of her affection as he walked slowly down the winding paths.
Harry feels it the second time, hones in on it, feels Draco prod into his memories. Harry tries to find that shoving sensation back, tries to squeeze him out of his brain just like he always failed to do in his Occlumency lessons.
“What is Potter doing?” Draco mumbled to Pansy as he tried to make his table less turtle-patterned. “Why isn’t Granger helping him? How does he think he’s going to end up with a full sized table if he’s crouching? What an idiot.”
“Quite,” Draco replies, subdued.
“You can be loud if you like,” Harry says.
Harry does his best to look demonstrably unimpressed. “Malfoy.”
“You never liked the attention,” Draco says quietly, and it feels too intimate for this space but Harry doesn’t ask him to stop. “I liked it. It used to kill me that everyone paid attention to you and you didn’t even care about it. You were too busy saving the world and I just wanted people to like me.”
“I hope so,” Harry said, unsure where was safe to tread. She didn’t know how to dance and she didn’t know how to talk to Draco but maybe if she could learn one she could learn the other. “First snow at Hogwarts is so beautiful.”
“None taken,” Harry said, raising his glass in a mock toast. Harry could have used a miracle, or a few extra years between himself and everything that had happened. He thought he might be getting better, but he wasn’t entirely sure what being better would mean. He didn’t think that he’d ever be without scars.
Draco huffs out a puff of smoke and Harry squints when it hits his face, finally meeting Draco's eyes again. They’re too close, it’s fine. “Dying is still better than living without love. How Gryffindor.”
“I just wish they’d up your dose of dreamless sleep,” Hermione said irritably, a furrow in her brow.
“I don’t know how you stand like this and don’t look stupid,” Harry grumbled, trying to keep her head up and hold herself at the stilted angles Draco held so naturally.
Draco is there when he arrives. Both the spilled tea and empty cup from yesterday have been removed from the room, though by Draco or some invisible cleaning staff, Harry has no idea.
Luna stood, drifting over to them and taking one of Draco’s hands in theirs. “I’m so glad you decided to come, I told Harry to invite you. Do you knit?”
“You didn’t wake me up and move me,” Draco replies, turning back over just to give Harry a peeved look. “It looks better on me anyway.”
“Dinner? I make very good pasta with marinara from the can,” Harry replies with a cheeky smile.
“Very sure,” Harry responds, meeting the challenge in Draco’s eyes. He’s so invested in winning their little staring contest that he trips over the curb and Draco laughs at him.
“Nice to meet you Harry,” Ellen says, sneaking a glance at him in the rearview mirror before she jerks the car into the drive. “I’m Ellen.”
Draco’s answer is already in his throat even though he knows he shouldn’t. “Of course.” Draco counts down from ten quickly and then slow. “It’s always fucking Nagini.”
“Hilarious how things improve when you put money into public health,” Harry says, reminded of hours of Hermione’s heated policy rants.
“Neither did I,” Harry says, and he’s coming back to himself but there’s a reason he doesn’t think about that, a reason he can’t truly remember most of his childhood. He wonders for the first time if that’s okay.
Draco didn’t look at her, her eyes locked on something just outside the window. “I just get really irritated.”
He wondered who he would see in the forest this time, if Draco was the only person he’d ever meet on the winding paths. He’d thought at first that the forest was simply projecting people it knew well, that maybe one day he’d get Neville, Hagrid, Ron, or even Fang. He hoped ever so vaguely that he might see his parents again, the ghosts who’d visited him inside her branches. He just hoped he’d never have to face Voldemort again in the tangled branches, but he felt somehow that the forest wouldn’t do that to him, though he couldn’t place why.
“I think he just used to follow Draco around and was mean by proxy,” Harry said, thinking of Draco’s assertion that Greg was sweet.
“Probably not,” Luna says serenely, beginning to shuffle through another stack of photographs. “Neither of you ever make anything easy.”
“Thanks,” Harry says, lingering in the middle of the kitchen. “We busted that dragon smuggling ring, rescued a bunch of Feathered Northerns.”
?” Draco asks, as Harry finally gets the water a pleasant temperature and stands to wet his hair, letting the hot water wash over him. “Oh and you’re a shower-hog? I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised by this.”
“I’m getting a ‘just made a terrible mistake’ feeling,” Harry says, hovering at Draco’s shoulder. “I’m sure it’ll only be worse if we blow them off.”
“You hand grip is better now,” Draco said clinically, like it wasn’t technically praise, as she fell effortlessly into dance position. It looked natural on Draco even when it felt gawky and ridiculous on Harry.
Harry has been waiting for this question, but by the time it arrives it surprises him. “I don’t know.”
Harry nods. “I know.” He leans back, looks at the man before him, conjures up empathy, up kindness. It’s not Draco’s fault Harry’s memories are tangled like brambles. It’s not his fault they were both pawns. Maybe it’s his fault that he never questioned it, that he spit horrible words with a smile and held Unforgivables on the edge of his tongue. It’s his fault he’s here now, if that’s anything.
Harry chokes a little on his own spit, but forces himself not to say any of the brash things that have come to mind.
“To be fair, you are watching them,” Hermione said, and Harry pretended she hadn’t heard.
Someone, probably Blaise, wolf whistles, and Draco’s brain rematerializes as he figures out, after a few tense seconds of trial and error, how to stop kissing. He knows he’s bright red and that everyone is watching them, but he can’t take his eyes off Harry, who is looking at Draco with that same expression of intense concentration, like he’s working through a particularly difficult problem.
“That’s what the button up underneath is for,” Harry replied, flipping her collar up and down with a grin.
“Of course I do,” Harry replies. “She’s your mother.”
He pulls the door open, revealing Draco in a crisp, clean sweater and a pair of emerald pants that look irritatingly effortless. Instead of saying hello, Draco squints up above his head. “Are you attempting a new hair style?”
“I know a lot of things,” they say, their tone keeping all of their secrets.
Draco reached up, his eyes determined as he swept Harry’s hair off his forehead and traced the lines with his fingers, not quite gentle but not hostile either. Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever been touched there before, if anyone had ever been brave enough to reach up and feel the marred evidence of his first brush with death.
“Posture, Ms. Potter,” McGonagall said, her hands moving Harry’s shoulders up and back and adjusting her grip on Anthony’s hand. “I can assure you that getting just a bit closer to Mr. Goldstein will not be your death.”
Dara, when she strolls in with a large cup of coffee, is also having a sense of humor about the article, and pauses what she’s doing to laugh at him as he gets settled in at his desk.
Harry watches him for a long moment. “I like that you assume this isn’t selfish,” he says, because he isn’t deluding himself into pretending that he’s trying to save Draco. He’s coming here because he wants to fix whatever’s wrong with himself.
Pansy nods, still moving slowly, watching them both like she doesn’t quite believe it. “Well, that’s lovely then,” she says brightly, and Harry has the sense that she’s snatching words from thin air. “I’m glad.”
“Thanks,” Harry said with only a small amount of sass.
More Clearly:
Dara cackles, this time much less quietly. “Four or five, oh sweet Circe. Have fun, you idiot.”
“Were you up late studying?” Harry asked sympathetically.
“Harsh words for a muggle lover,” Draco said, mostly to see how Harry would react.
“Keep it that way,” Draco says. “I like this, and I won’t have you ruin it just because you think its funny.”
“Not a girl,” Draco says, abruptly still. The lip print looks like a signature, like a stamp on a letter, like a print in fresh fallen snow.
“Almost Slytherin of you,” Harry replied.
“If you want,” Draco said, pretending it didn’t feel so important. He just wanted to know about Harry, wanted to steal all the small mundane pieces of him while he could. They’d never been friends like he’d wanted, he’d never been able to go to the ice cream shop with him and watch him order or laugh at him as he dripped ice cream down his fingers. He wanted to know everything, every small thing about him so maybe when they left the forever he’d have something left to hold on to.
“Yeah,” Potter replies, close, close. Draco counts backwards from ten twice and tries to breathe. “I’m usually on a train. Sometimes the train will pass train stations filled with ghosts and I won’t be able to get off to see them. Sometimes there will be something on the train with me and I won’t know what it is or what car it’s in but I won’t be able to get away from it. I always wake up before it finds me, but barely.” Potter holds his gaze for all of it and that’s the worst part, really. Draco didn’t ask what he had nightmares about. Maybe he didn’t even care, how obtuse of Potter to assume that he did. “You do too?”
“Tell them you have other plans,” Draco says, sweeping towards the door. “Meet me here.”
“I’m bad at double lives, I was a complete failure at occlumency. I can’t keep things separate, it all bleeds together,” Harry says and hopes it’s enough. And I want them to see you like I see you. I think you’re fantastic. The morning Ron almost found Draco in his bed still cuts too sharp and he knows he can’t hide this from them forever, even though he’s terrified things will turn sour afterwards.
“It’s fine, don’t worry about it,” Harry replies, knowing that his face has gone bright red even as he tries to be cool about it. Harry’s been hit on by blokes before, but he’s never had to actually deal with it, since fans are very different from earnest boys with blue eyes who want to give him wine and talk to him. It never really registered as an option, not with how Aunt Petunia said homosexual so similarly to the way she said magic.
“The ultimate no homo,” Harry replies, and Draco snorts.
“Why,” Draco begins. “Are you like this?”
The worst was that he could still feel Harry’s hands on his back and the press of his lips, no matter how many times he told his stupid brain that it wasn’t real. He thought about spending the day trying to scrub off the memories under the warm spray of the Slytherin showers, but he knew he couldn’t miss another day without arousing suspicion. He didn’t think he could face Potter but he knew he didn’t exactly have a choice. He just hoped Potter wouldn’t try to catch his eye over brunch, because he had a horrid suspicion that he’d somehow read his mind.
Harry shrugs. “I mean, that’s fine. You think I’m hot, so I feel fairly comfortable admitting that I think you’re hot.”
Harry makes sure Draco can tell he’s rolling his eyes. “I’ll try not to ruin the shining image of me the Prophet has constructed.”
“I don’t want to be empty like you,” Harry spits back, looking at the places that Draco is shivering on the edge of falling apart, how his skin looks too thin and shows all his veins, how he’s always too still or blurring into motion. Harry keeps wanting to compare him to animals.
One time, they don’t even take their clothes off. Harry arrives in the empty classroom and Draco is sitting there dead eyed, his legs dangling off the side of the long table. His arms hang down too far, Harry thinks, his mouth is too much like a wound. Harry sits behind him for an hour, his chin on his shoulder, trying to catch his breath.
“Yeah, obviously,” Harry says.
“Is it okay to eat?” Harry asked cautiously, remembering how in stories eating fairy food meant getting lost in their world forever.
Harry tilted his head so Draco could get a better angle on his neck. “Are you the only version of you who wants to kiss me?”
One of the cars slows to a stop in front of the building, a rusty old thing with an engine that reminds Harry of a small plane. The window comes down and a girl with faded blue hair sticks her head out. “You ready, babes?”
Harry can tell Dara is figuring out how to say something, and waits for her to do it. “Do you think he could be behind any of this?”
Cedric hangs over them like the most macabre of small floating cupids and Harry wants to die, a feeling he’d never really forgotten but forgot the weight of. The memory turns over but he doesn’t think he’s pushed it there. He’s looking at Cedric in the dappled sunlight of an empty corridor. Cedric murmurs something to Harry who looks up at him and leans in to catch his words. The emotion is twisted, nerves and amusement at the way that Cedric peers down the hall like he’s afraid of being walked in on. Cedric smells clean and boyish and Harry can’t imagine why he remembers this, why some part of his brain thought that was important to file away.
“Depends on what it tells us, I suppose,” Draco says. “Jasmine is excited to meet you, so do try not to be quite as slovenly as usual.”
“Oh,” Draco says, pressing a kiss against Harry’s nose. “Can I give you one or will people ask questions?”
“Hi,” Harry said awkwardly standing at the door. “Is McGills here?”
Sleep came easier to Draco after he found the forest, and all of the Slytherins noticed but none of them knew why, because Draco was good at secrets and tight smiles.
As the hour ticked from three to four, some part of him began to understand that he was going to return to the forest, could hear the creak of the castle walls as they tried to coax him out, and the whisper of the trees and they called him back. Maybe he could go to the forest without kissing Harry again, or maybe he could kiss him again and have it not matter. He knew he was lying to himself, but it was all beginning to blur together.
“You are deeply in love,” Luna says. “See this heat spot up here?” Luna raises their free hand to hover first over Draco’s chest and then up directly over his head. “This means you’re in love. Or that you have an important meeting next week. Sometimes it just means you have a meeting.”
“That’s a word for it,” Harry replies. “Imagine if we’d shared a dorm. You’d have strangled me in my sleep.”
Draco glowers, pulling the sleeves of his jumper down over his hands and leaning on the counter. “One of my friends plays them constantly, it gets in my head.”
“About knowing it?” Draco tried to fill in, his eyes tripping over Harry’s body, how he sat so sprawled out, his hair pushed every which way while Draco sat up perfectly straight.
Draco didn’t answer for a moment, reaching out to the snake and seeming to converse with it, stalling before he replied. “I don’t know how to behave around you. There is absolutely no established etiquette and I don’t know what to do.”
“What’s your music guilty pleasure?” Harry asked, smiling like maybe he actually cared back.
.” Harry half expects her to whip out a magnifying glass and deerstalker, and suspects that she would if not for the fact that the entire contents of her robes had been confiscated.
Draco sighs. “Oh, don’t go insulting me now, Potter.”
Harry thanks her and starts down the winding staircase just behind the reference desk, the wooden stairs curling down the center of the library like the spine of a conch shell. When he finally makes it to the third floor down, he spots Draco, flipping through a file cabinet near the front. He has on a pair of wire-framed reading glasses that he pushes up intermittently, dark green trousers and a button down, the sleeves rolled up so Harry can see his elbows. There’s a bit of pale green fabric done up in a bow where a tie should be, which Harry thinks is maybe wizard fashion but makes him look like a wrapped gift. Harry is planning on teasing him that he looks the part of amateur detective, but when Draco glances up from his work he feels his words die in his throat. In the low light, he looks just like Harry remembers him looking after wine had clouded his vision: like he was so clean and vaguely glowing.
He worried both that the forest would tear them apart and also that she wouldn’t, with a pounding fear that made his ears ring. He was mostly worried that they’d separate and have to look at each other again, and then pick up all the pieces. He thought instead of that, they could just kiss forever until they were part of the forest, until they became trees, strong and intertwined.
“Absolutely ridiculous,” Draco said firmly, feeling sharp relief when Harry gave him the beginnings of a smile.
Luna taps her foot, studying him. “Does he make you happy?”
“Good,” Harry says, taking a shaky sip of wine. Draco looks at him strangely, a pale eyebrow arched up on his forehead, before he settled back into the couch and takes a gulp from his glass.
Harry sneaks another annoyed glance at the darkening sky, wrinkling his nose as a drop of water falls on his arm. He isn’t sure if a drying charm would salvage an already temperamental muggle machine and he only hopes he doesn’t have to find out.
“Coincidence?” Draco asks. He has a look on his face like he doesn’t really believe it’s a coincidence but is giving it a try.
Anthony nodded. “It’s good, I think, after a war, to dance.”
Harry’s about to defend his honor when Ron ducks into his office as if pursued. “Millence Filbin sighting, requesting cover,” he says, locking the door behind him.
“Evening,” Draco says, not bothering to look over.
“Lovely,” Draco murmured, running his hands across Harry’s chest, his thumbs running over Harry’s nipples. The smallest of smiles alit on his lips when Harry squirmed  and pressed up into the drag of his fingers, his hips jerking upward involuntarily “So lovely.”
“How did you even manage this?” Harry asked, narrowing her eyes at the riddles on each slip of paper.
Harry puts both of his hands on Draco’s shoulders and makes extremely intense eye contact with him. “It was so hot. I would like to do it again, possibly every day. Maybe more than once a day.”
As he stared, giving his coffee an irritated stir, Harry glanced straight at him, his eyes widening when they met Draco’s. Draco kept his face blank, even as his emotions ran rampant.
“Everything is too sappy for you,” Harry teased, remembering the time that Dean had bought her a heart necklace and she’d held it up to Ron and asked ‘so like, am I supposed to wear it now or something?’
“I can’t!” Harry said, rushing slowly towards anger, to something like despair. This was supposed to be easy and it wasn’t supposed to hurt. “That’s the whole problem!”
“I’ve lost track,” Draco says. “Probably.”
Harry sleeps for close to ten hours and yet when he stumbles into the little ministry office next morning he still feels on the edge of grogginess. Draco, when he arrives in a neat set of gray robes, looks much the same. His hair is mussed up in the back and he’s holding a thermos far more protectively than is normal for the comfortably lucid.
“Are these are spiderwebs?” Harry asked, coming up to stand beside him and reaching up to touch the delicate weaving.
“Not alive?” Draco asked, looking at the strands clinically. “What is the, uh, point?”
There was probably a time after the war where Draco could have fled the country instead, gone for a small beach house somewhere gray and tended a few chickens, maybe had an herb garden. These are the kinds of things Harry would in theory choose for himself in any other universe.
Draco swept out of the garden, the door swinging shut behind him with a definitive bang, leaving Harry to follow him back into the corridor with a sigh on his lips. He wished he knew at least why Draco was so hell bent on ignoring him. He didn’t even pick fights anymore or try to antagonize Harry. It wasn’t that Harry would rather have fought, he just thought it strange that they couldn’t even manage that.
Luna laughs, her eyes going closed as she does. “Not sure it can be any other way with you.”
“Me. Harry.”
“Just confused, I think.” Draco said. “It doesn’t make sense for you to go for me.”
“Did you just help him?” she asked, tapping her foot on the ground.
“Sometimes I wonder if I would have been more useful dead,” Harry said, then knew it was the kind of thing he said sometimes, where it was bad. Draco looked at him for ages, but didn’t do the things the rest of them did.
It’s a bit cruel I think, to make us help them take our home apart, but it’s not like there’s much sacred left in here. Mother obliterated all the nice dishware yesterday, because the ministry people told her they planned on removing it. I tried to stop her, but she’d gotten the damn idea in her head and I didn’t know any way to talk her out of it, so we stood in the kitchens and smashed plates until the whole floor was covered in shards of delicate china. It doesn’t really matter, it’s not like anyone stands to inherit them anyone. Maybe Andromeda would have liked them? Didn’t Nymphadora have a son? Theodore? Not that he’d want death eater dishware. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
The warmth between them grew and stretched as they drifted back to safer topics, only breaking when Harry finally stood up and began to dress for his jaunt into the forest.
“But what if you were?” Draco presses. “What if you’re wrong and I am bad, would you still love me then?”
“I usually study in the library with Ron and Hermione,” Harry says, trying to be serious and failing completely.
“Not that they knew that,” Harry said, sounding ever so smug.
“It was bizarre,” Harry agreed.
“Is ‘Eagle’ the
“Is that what you do to all the things you love?” Harry jabbed back, almost playful, and Draco didn’t answer for a moment.
“You’re cold,” Draco said accusingly, shoulders held at aristocratic angles and an unkind tilt to his mouth. “Bloody cold.”
“Looking forward to it,” Harry says sincerely. “Does tomorrow work?”
“Fuck you, Potter,” he whispered, just for dramatic effect, as he pulled his covers up higher over his head and wished for sleep.
Rob nods, stewing on the question for a moment. “Well, that was about a week ago. I usually bring Puddle a few fresh three banded bulltoads. She uses ‘em for her cooking.”
Slowly, a thought occurred to Draco, a half formed question that drifted uselessly at the back of his brain, almost realized, even before the proof had begun to manifest.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry asked, trying to press his hands against Draco’s back so they wouldn’t shake.
Harry reaches up, running the pads of his fingers against the skin. He likes the kids because they don’t tip toe around him, are willing to poke at his scars and grin through it. “Not anymore, no. Not for years now.”
The first four times Harry looks for clues. He waits for Draco to slip and tell him that he bought the necklace that sent Katie Bell flying in the air, that he’s going to get the mark, that he hates everything that Harry stands for.
“Good blue?”
Harry took a quiet step forward. Draco was staring into his eyes with a bright fiery anger that Harry wanted a taste of, breathing so hard Harry could feel it on his lips.
When Harry pushes open the door, Draco is already seated in the armchair on the left, arranging his robes and looking uncomfortable. He hasn’t seen him in person since they became partners and yet nothing is different.
“Poisonous snake pit?” Draco offers, leading them up to the counter and ordering something fancy and complicated. Harry orders next, hoping that their drinks take ten years and that they never have to go over and greet the girls. Unfortunately, their coffee arrives in minutes, and they have to trudge guiltily over to the table Hermione and Pansy are sitting at, looking alarmingly chummy.
I feel like no matter what truths I tell you I’m still lying. I don’t think I know how to tell the truth to myself, much less you.
“How’s dance purgatory with your arch nemesis?” Anthony asked, a can of soda in his hand.
Harry grimaces, finally spitting it out. Maybe Hermione and Pansy will kill them quickly. “We’re together.”
need better taste in
“I am!” Harry replied. Somehow, Draco not even considering her worthy of tormenting was worse than when she’d been determined to make Harry’s life hell. It had been different during the war, when they were both distracted and confused but everything was okay now, they should have gone back to normal. They hadn’t and Harry hadn’t even properly noticed.
The last two weeks flashed bright and hazy in his brain. Harry, appearing to him asleep in a bed of flowers. Harry, holding his hand. Harry, lips warm and insistent. Two years prior in a bathroom and bloody. Three years and a curled lip and flashing eyes. Seven years and two small boys who didn’t know any better. “I don’t know.”
Ephemerally,
“Him? He’s just a hack.”
“Next time you do that I’m just picking a year and pouring it into your lap,” Harry grumbles, handing him the glass and falling into the adjacent armchair, one in a very different but equally loud print.
Harry nods, adding little sun at the top of the paper. “Yeah, I hope the talk goes okay. I feel so under qualified for those things.”
Harry glances at his watch, then hands Dara the letter, which she scans with a low cackle that Harry isn’t going to try decoding.
Harry nodded, unable to find sense in any of it, in Draco or in the mirage, in the forest or what she gave him. Maybe it was the truth because the forest told him, maybe it was the truth because Draco did, or maybe it was a lie meant to patch him up and make him a little less sad.
Please take care of yourself, or I’ll haunt you, I swear to Merlin I’ll haunt you. I’m sorry I poured myself out to you and you didn’t know, but I’m glad you don’t. You don’t even know half of it Harry, I promise. I promise you don’t know half of it and neither does anyone else because it would ruin me if you knew, if you knew for sure. I’m sure you’ve guessed, you seem stupid but you always manage to figure it out eventually.
“Looking for snow,” Draco says with a sad little tilt to his lips. “Weather said there’d be some, but I don’t see any.”
“I just, I know how hard loss is,” Harry says, plowing through the earlier comment. He’s not an aggressively good person, he’s a mediocre person trying aggressively to live up to everything.
Harry sighs, scrubbing his hand across his face. He can picture Hermione telling him he needs to talk about his ‘issues,’ which makes all of this even more acutely torturous. “I was really embarrassed,” Harry says reluctantly, more honest about it than he ever was with anyone else. In fact, he’d taken two weeks off and refused to talk about it with such vehemence that everyone mostly backed off. In retrospect, his inability to play it cool probably just made the whole thing worse. “The Prophet made it sound like more than it was.”
Ron is in his face when he wakes up. “Morning sunshine, nice to see you up and about.”
“Watch closely,” Draco said, the decoy metal in his hand. Draco slipped it into his mouth. Harry imagined it under his tongue, warming there like a coal. Draco didn’t murmur an incantation. He didn’t go to touch his wand.
He tidies and starts laundry and makes a cheese toasty and tomato soup and doesn’t worry even as the sky fades to lavender and then black. He comes up the stairs from moving the load into the dryer to find Draco at his doorstep, looking dejectedly at the door and shuffling his feet.
Ron would be the first one to get it, staring up at the places where all the colors wove together in a ceiling of glittering purple. “Inter-house unity.” She’d say, her hand in Hermione’s. “Duh.”
“I know you can understand me, Harry Potter,” it hissed lazily, slithering up in a graceful coil of muscle to curl up around his feet like a cat. Harry wondered wildly if the creature in front of him was Draco in another form, but shook the thought from his head.
He picks up batteries from the hardware store and slides through stations and static until the early hours of the morning. He wonders if Malfoy’s awake and wonders if he’s been thinking about Harry, stupid Harry who doesn’t know what batteries are and can’t fix anything anymore.
It was a little pathetic, he thought, with no lack of bitterness, as he took a shower so hot it burned a little. It wasn’t that he wanted to be real Harry’s friend or anything stupid like that, but he liked the way Harry was confident and still unsure, liked how his eyes sparkled when he got frustrated and how he was kind sometimes, unexpectedly.
“Bye, Pans,” Draco replies, a warmth in his voice that Harry’s never heard before.
“That’s what the box says.”
Draco had only been dragging Harry behind him for about a minute when Harry saw the familiar outline of the castle through the gaps in the trees. “Are you sure you can..?”
“Um, hello,” Draco said, drawing herself up to her full height, which was still shorter than Blaise, but did make her look authoritative. “Hermione said that knitting club met right now?”
“No magic outside of school, Potty,” Draco teased, though not as unkindly as he intended to. Harry had a strange kind of fire in his eyes that spoke of insurrection and revolution and Draco felt the infectiousness of it under his fingernails.
“As long as I don’t have to be nice to you when you’re being a knob,” Draco said, raising her eyebrows like a challenge.
The premise:
44. It occurs to Harry that Draco can die, like Hermione can die, like Ron can die, like Neville and Luna and Ginny can die. He knows other people could die but it always comes to him like that, as a revelation. Draco assures Harry that the Death Eaters don’t suspect him, that they’re too stupid, that he’s too good of a showman or a liar. Harry doesn’t know how comforting this is supposed to be, because he knows that Draco is lying, in some way, about something. It’s never been entirely clear how much danger Draco is in.
“Yeah, I just thought I was,” Harry waved her hand around. “Like, dying.”
“Me neither,” Harry says, mulling the problem over. Even as long as he’s been in the wizarding world, he can’t always wrap his head around some of it, the way that people’s prejudices morph in and out of logic. How Ron, who never thought twice about Harry being Indian, would be so callous about Hagrid’s mum being a giant or would mistrust even Professor Lupin. “She’s a pureblood?”
They only do it once, because it’s terrifying.
The next memory, he’s holding Cedric’s body to his chest and he wasn’t ready, wasn’t ready to feel his body underneath him, cold and dead and indelible. Weren’t there memories before this? Wasn’t there more time when he wasn’t dead? Wasn’t Harry allowed to look at him? Just look at him for a little longer? Harry never wanted to touch him like this, curled around his body as Dumbledore tried to take him away, the fabric of Cedric’s robes too rough against his cheek. Draco wasn’t supposed to see that, no one was, in another world they both stumble out together clutching the cup in both hands, in this world Cedric hugs him and congratulates them, and in this world everyone cheers and its all okay, and in this world Cedric-
“Could be worse, neither of us are gross,” Anthony said as couples around them were corrected.
A muscle in Draco’s jaw jumps and he’s quiet long enough for Harry to worry. “So you didn’t mean it.”
They all agree that if they’re fucking anyone new they’ll send Hermione a prompt owl and then Hermione scolds them for patronizing her, but eventually they get the Floo powder and stumble back into Harry’s living room.
“Well it works doesn’t it? Negative enforcement, right?” Harry asks, shaking out his hair and leaning back in the unforgiving chair. “You crucio me every time I fail and then I don’t fail anymore?”
“Paavan wanted to talk about black holes,” Anthony said, taking a sip of his coffee. “It got out of hand.”
Harry comes back to the repair shop a week later with nothing in his hands and finds Draco at the counter, paler than before. Harry can’t hear any music and Draco isn’t dancing, just slumped against against the counter, doodling something on a notepad.
Draco looks like he’s dangerously close to pelting his cup of tea across the room. “It doesn’t matter? Of course it matters, you like him, you liked him!”
Harry was thinking about where Draco goes when he disappears from the Marauders map, about how to get there.
“What I’m trying to prove, Draco,” Pansy interrupts. “Is that you want to kiss Harry and you’re not doing a half as good a job of pretending you don’t as you think you are.”
Harry had felt something creep in as the room grew quiet and he threw spell after spell as Draco deflected and dove and flickered away from him. Draco fought with finesse. He fought with the perfect form they all strove for and he knew spells that Harry had barely glanced at. He always had his nose tucked into the Ministry issue spellbooks, learning, absorbing.
“Ms. Malfoy!”
Despite everything, Draco looks almost delighted. “Potter, you’re being
“I’m not coming back,” Harry said, trying to make it sound like an apology. “I thought you knew.”
Draco gives him a cool look. “Oh, you think you’re going to first name me into agreeing with you? I don’t think so. You can be a hero tomorrow, Harry. You look an absolute train wreck. Go to bed, sleep it off, we’ll start again tomorrow.”
“Silly of them to believe such things,” Draco thinks, even though if he counts the veins in his wrists and the breaths he takes and the buttons as he does them up then maybe he won’t fall apart. “Can I ask you a very personal question?”
“It sounds like you’re telling me I should probably do more research,” Harry says, grimacing.
“Hello boys,” Hermione says, looking more dangerous than Harry knew anyone so pregnant could look.
Harry rolls his eyes, which Draco pretends not to notice. “I’m not insulting your spellwork, I’m doing my job. Will you let me check your wards or are you going to make this difficult?”
Draco blinks. “I don’t think that was ever on the table for either of us.”
“Geraniums actually. Red ones, like the ones my mum used to plant,” Luna replies, a ghost of a smile on her face. “I wondered if he knew somehow.”
He’s getting better at moving but he still doesn’t know how to leave or how to run to safety. No matter what he does they’re still there, all of his memories swirling up to meet them. Cho is crying, she has her head cradled in her hands and her elbows propped on the shiny pink table cloth and the helplessness is a secondary emotion to the sucker punch of grief. Harry is bad at crying and he is bad at dealing with crying and he wants to apologize but he doesn’t know why.
“Thank you, Dara, I appreciate your support.” Ron gives up the act, flashing Harry a grin. “I think the coast is clear, so I’ve gotta dash. I’ve a chat with a suspect at ten, but I’ll see you for dinner, Harry.”
“That’s between Harry and I,” Neville says manfully, then, at the combined glare force of Hermione and Pansy, crumbles. “Well, I was asking him how you’re supposed to know if you’re bisexual or just think blokes are good looking, because I’d never actually kissed a bloke, and he offered to kiss me so I could find out.”
“Green,” Draco said firmly, even as Harry rolled her eyes. “Are we here to dance or to make fun of the clothing choices of my youth?”
My death approaches quickly. What a strange thing to know. It’s almost calming, knowing I can arrange all my things and say all my goodbyes. Pansy is completely distraught over the fact that they won’t let her visit the manor, and is being so obtuse about it that I think she might wear them down. She’s written me fifteen perfumed letters this week. I think she’s spiraling. Her parents want to have her committed and frankly I think that might be good for her. I’d ask you to take care of her, but that would be ridiculous on many levels. Blaise has left the country, but we fell out before the war so I’m not expecting much. “Where you’ll make your greatest friends” my arse. We’re all a fucking disaster. I’m sure the Gryffindors wouldn’t do things like this, I’m sure you all hold hands and sing songs and apologize to each other when you fuck up.
“Oh you better believe it, HP. This place has a bathroom.”
Draco’s breath echoed loud in his ears, his skin warm and growing tacky with sweat, real and solid and overwhelming. Lovely, Draco had said, with a casual sort of approval that drew a moan from Harry’s lips even in memory.
Harry jumps, sheepishly opening the door. “Sorry I was just,” he shrugs. “You know, listening.”
“Please,” Harry starts, then falters. “Please, I’m so close—“
He could feel dangerous words on his lips, proclaiming things he didn’t even entirely mean, words about love and affection and begging Draco not to leave even though they were still tangled up together. He hoped the forest could feel how much he needed him, needed her as well, that she would always bring both of them back together until he was alright again.
Harry,
“I was always good at occlumency,” Draco replies, breaking Harry’s gaze to look up at the ceiling. “Compartmentalizing and lying are strong suits of mine.”
“What we wanted to tell you,” Harry begins, trying to drum up his auror training regarding hostage situations and talking down criminals. “Is that Draco and I- Well we-Have kind of-”
“I think the expression is six ways from Sunday.”
“No.”
“Yeah well last time it happened you went with Victor Krum,” Ron replied, making a face at Hermione. Harry wasn’t sure if Ron was more annoyed by Krum’s attractiveness or by the fact that he had gone with Hermione and she hadn’t. Harry thought it might be a fair mix of both.
“Hey! Not you too!” Ginny says to Luna, who smiles serenely. “No one else I’ve dated is allowed to kiss my brothers. New rule.” Ginny whips out her wand, pressing it to Harry’s throat, which Draco is dismayed to realize he also finds rather hot. “Fess up, Potter.” Draco is disconcerted by how much of this reminds him of how he has historically treated Harry.
He watched the sun slip down beyond the trees and then when the grounds had gone dark, traipsed back up to the Gryffindor tower to do homework in the common room until it was time for his nightly jaunt.
“Meaning that Draco is nice now?” Ron asked incredulously. “Please don’t tell me you’re implying that.”
The room is quiet, late morning light falling through the single window. Draco is wearing one of his shirts, Harry is sure, and the sheet is pulled up just past his torso. His hair is messy around his face and Harry almost can’t bear to wake him up. He’s still beautiful, Harry was almost hoping he’d forget that, or that in the morning the words would stop holding such weight. They haven’t, they still crush heavy on his chest.
Lee zips back to the kitchen, leaving them in a silence that feels like it could turn into anything.
“Have we not addressed in our previous lessons that Mr. Macmillan will lead and you will follow?” asked McGonagall, looking increasingly irritated with the both of them.
“GIRLS!” Headmistress McGonagall’s voice cut through their shouting match, and she looked distinctly unamused when she came striding over to both of them. “I expected much better from both of you. You will have detention every night for the rest of this week, and you will either dance together or you will kill each other trying.”
Draco burned and burned and then there was no more of him. The sharp mouth of the fire drew shadows that danced across the trees and then there was nothing but the afterimage behind Harry’s eyes as they fought to adjust, a rainbow mirage of past light and a thick darkness. There was a pile of ash that crackled and settled with magic.
“Merlin.”
That night they fuck clumsily for the first time, Harry remembering all the things he ever thought were beautiful about Draco. His hair shines in the light and he has angel eyes, storm gray and soft, and he’s looking at Harry like he’s going to save him.
He’s safe, he tells her instead.
“How much did you see?” Draco grumbles, straightening like he’s trying to look aloof.
They stand outside with the rest of the building as the firemen come, shivering in the December cold and watching the spectacle unfold. The first lonely snowflakes of the year are drifting down into their hair and Draco holds his hand and complains about the cold damaging his delicate constitution, snickering at all of it: the world and the snow and maybe him too.
“I wasn’t trying to be mean, I just sometimes say things without thinking,” Harry said, because Draco was upset and she hadn’t wanted that at all. “I’m really sorry I hurt your feelings.”
Jasmine has brought Harry extremely lumpy, homemade cookies, rendering him so charmed and speechless that for the first few minutes he just gapes about them while Draco gives him the tour. Draco’s potion shop is low-lit and cozy, the windows blacked out by long, green curtains that give the room the same underwater glow as the Slytherin common room. There’s a live gecko in a tank that Draco introduces as ‘Camembert’ and shelves full of potions in dark blue bottles, each labeled in Draco’s neat spidery handwriting.
“Yeah. Ron’s Dad gave him a record player last Christmas and it was convenient for me to bring it in since I don’t exactly have a desk job,” Harry replies with a rueful smile. “Can’t imagine how it would have gone if he’d brought it in.”
Harry almost hadn’t come to lunch, or breakfast for that matter. It wasn’t that he wasn’t used to being the talk of the school, positive or negative, but he felt as if his secret world was coming down around him, all the boundaries he thought he had in place blurring out.
He saw Nagini in the thick scaled body and intelligent eyes, even though he knew this snake couldn’t be her. Horrid memories trickled through his brain, of threats, idle and serious, of snapping jaws unhinging, the dripping of venom on the table, the words ‘swallowed whole.’
Dara taps his desk, jolting him from a mental tangent involving the dragon smuggling case they’ve just started working on that has Harry half convinced that the dragons must be leaving the country through an underground tunnel system.
Draco scowled. “Tell yours first. And I’m not telling you all of it.” His breath hopped and he thought about backing out. “And if your secret isn’t good enough you’re not getting anything from me.”
Harry nods along, taking a sip from his cup as she continues her story, and the rest of tea goes much the same. Narcissa is fascinating, warm and shimmering in the cottage with too much furniture and the finest, chipped china. When they finally apparate back, after Narcissa gives them both a goodbye kiss on the cheek, Draco lets out a sigh like he’s been holding it for ages and he slides onto the kitchen counter still in his dress robes.
“Ginny?” Harry asked, looking from the paper back to Ron in confusion.
“Yeah,” Draco said, uncomfortable in his skin. “Is it really that surprising?”
Draco thought that the castle walls seemed a bit tired in the aftermath of the war, even after the rebuilding. It turned out that he was right about the castle walls, and they were grateful that he’d thought of them, so they ushered him through the corridors as he wandered at night and kept him safe from harm. Sometimes the staircases, who cared for the sad boy the most, would take him to corridors they didn’t normally stretch to, or hold him on their steps as he sat and thought.
“He was always so intimidated around girls,” Hermione said, pausing to thank the waitress as their drinks came. “McGonagall probably would have done him a favor switching her.”
“I was just trying to help!” Harry half yelled, wrenching herself out of Draco’s grip.
Draco clears his throat pointedly, looking at Harry down the bridge of his nose. “Didn’t anyone teach you that staring is impolite?”
Harry almost replied, but was cut off by the return of Draco lips, insistent and warm. Harry felt it again, that tidal wave of something that was more electric than ‘like.’ It made his hands shake again, but unaccompanied by the familiar rattle of anxious nausea. He tried to steady them by holding onto the fabric of Draco’s robes, pulling him closer in the process.
“That’s enough, Pans.” It’s Draco, a hand resting on her forearm, posture perfect, mouth in a thin line. “You’ve done enough, love.”
“Potter makes up for her lack of natural talent by sheer force of will,” Draco said.
Draco looks on the verge of collapse again and Harry doesn’t know how to help either of them. He just stares, knows his eyes are going cold. He isn’t sure the last time he was this desperate and feels the muted horror of that helplessness.
“Okay,” Harry said slowly, trying not to pay attention to the fact that Draco was in a tee shirt and his pants, both of which were clinging to his body with rain water. It wasn’t that Harry thought him particularly attractive, but he had noticed his body, which was more than he’d done in a while. “So um, what’s the peach about?”
“I’m not confused,” Harry says, his hand still hovering on the towel, still staring like an idiot.
“I’ll be back to pick up my radio,” Harry says, and Draco nods. Harry wants to linger forever but he can feel panic setting in for reasons he doesn’t know if he wants to explain yet.
Everything had the boring residue of destiny on it. He’d lost track of the amount of times he’d thought that surely it couldn’t get worse, the amount of times he’d thought “I’m not surprised anymore,” which wasn’t the same as really not being surprised. It was quietly admitting that you were still being taken aback by cruelty you wished you could be numb to.
“It’s not boring,” Harry replies, letting Draco lean on him as they walk down the stairs and along the empty sidewalk. It’s chilly, but Draco seems too drunk to be bothered even as Harry shivers.
Draco Malfoy
Maybe finally, Merope loved him enough to let him go. And yet, Harry doesn’t think that’s how love works, not really. Love is a closed fist.
“They did,” Draco said, even though his parents’ love for him hadn’t come close to saving them. Maybe it had only been meant to save him, and he wondered how they’d feel about their success.
“That was good!” Harry said, after her latest and greatest performance of the under-arm turn. “I executed that perfectly!”
Harry nodded, first perfunctorily and then like he couldn’t remember how to stop doing it. He had liked it, the clean violence, the flames.
He reached for Draco’s tie, resting his hands on the knot until Draco gave him a nod. Harry avoided Draco’s face as he undid the buttons of his shirt and slid first the cloak and then the button down from his shoulders, letting them drop to the forest floor.
“I don’t know how much longer I can do it,” Harry says.
“Sure thing,” Dara says, then Disapparates with a crack that reverberates through the empty street. At the sound, Draco stirs but still doesn’t wake.
He can feel the pulse of magic behind his eyes and realizes that he’d been convincing them into little rows, into roll up bug circles at his feet. He wants to stay here in the warmth and watch them, to keep his younger self company in the sunlight and charm little hats onto the bugs and brush his unruly hair out of his eyes.
“I’m at work,” Draco whispers into Harry’s ear. “It’s fortunate Belinda lets you hang around.”
“I am cultured,” Draco says, handing his menu back over. Harry is nearly positive he’s making a joke and not just being a ponce, which is a surprise, if a pleasant one. Taking Draco here had been a risk that still had plenty of time to backfire, but he’s hoping they’ll get through midnight breakfast with his questions answered and all of his limbs intact.
This letter writing exercise is calming, I’m not sure why. I have a few theories. One of them has to do with the fact that our mutual dislike has been one of the few constants in my life. Congratulations Potter, you’re one of my longest relationships.
“Not a bad idea, Anthony is cool,” Harry said. “He uses mouthwash and he won’t try to grope me, so definitely a strong possibility.”
Harry lets them squabble, feeling much lighter than before. He’s kissing Draco and nothing in his life has fallen apart, and that’s better than he could have imagined. It’s far from perfect, he hasn’t even seen where Draco lives and Pansy still scares the life out of him, but he wants this to be something, wants to put time and heart into it so it works.
“You think she would?” Ron asked.
“Nice to meet you too,” he says, hoping it’s the proper thing to say. He now understands Draco’s insistence that he get proper dress robes, even her posture makes him feel slovenly, and suddenly Draco’s manners makes infinitely more sense.
“You don’t even try to clear your mind,” Draco says, breaking eye contact and leaning back in the chair. He looks exhausted, the tremor in his hands visible in the low light. “You don’t even try.”
Very few things are known about the Forbidden Forest. From above, the forest measures approximately ten by thirteen miles, however, no one in recorded history has ever walked from one side to the other. The flora and fauna of the Forbidden Forest remain largely undocumented for a variety of reasons. 1. The forest possesses multiple climate zones and swiftly changing seasons. 2. Many plants present in the depths of the Forbidden Forest are documented nowhere else in the world and seem to resist both name and categorization on a primal level. 3.Those who attempt to document the secrets of the forest find themselves with wiped muggle technology and blank sheets of paper, wandering out years later with only a vague feeling of unease. It is better, most likely, just to observe such a strange, savage thing. Or, better yet, to stay far away from this wild magic altogether.
He hovered at the skin before opening his mouth and sucking, gently at first but then with a deliberate kind of insistence, like he was taking special care to mark him.
“Pansy, Blaise and I usually drown the disappointments of the past year in champagne. Sometimes lovers make an appearance,” Draco replies, with a devious little grin. “Think you could handle it?”
They follow Ron into the kitchen, Harry half-wishing he’d been quicker on advocating for the shower, as the sweat and dust has dried against his skin in an uncomfortable way. Harry glances at Ron and Draco to find that of the three of them, he’s actually probably the least disheveled, which comes as a bit of a shock.
The majority of Jasmine’s initial questions for him are about Luna, though she does ask Harry if he thinks that Hermione is actually on track to be the youngest Minister of Magic or if she’s going for something else, like Head of Muggle Liaisons or astronaut. Draco has to have the concept of astronauts explained to him, which Harry and Jasmine find so hysterical that Harry nearly forgets why he’s there in the first place.
“You’re saying you wouldn’t secretly love if I had to wear Slytherin colors?” Harry asked. “I’ll wear silver jewelry even. The whole thing. All you have to do is wear pink, your favorite color in the whole world. I’m doing you a favor, even.”
“School,” Harry clarified, and Hermione still looked like she didn’t believe him.
It’s November and Harry suspects him and that’s why he’s looking at him in the first place. The plan is a bad plan.
“I have been to the library, I know what’s there,” Draco replied, with less anger than Harry would have expected.
Draco, the real one across the hall, had a cup of something in his hands and wouldn’t look at him, no matter how long he stared across the tables. He usually looked up at least once, and Harry thought dourly that on some subconscious level he must suspect the stupid thing Harry had done.
“Well what am I supposed to do?” Harry asks, looking up to find Draco still curled at his odd angles, his lips pale and joints sharp. “How did Bellatrix teach you?”
“I didn’t say it was your fault, I just said I wasn’t responsible,” Draco says, unruffled and more nasal than before. Harry has the strong urge to mock him but shoves it down.
“Isn’t it early for strawberries?” Draco asks, of all things.
“I did see something about capes coming back,” Emma offers, rejoining the conversation. “It’s very glam rock revival.”
Best,
“Excited?” he asked, giving her a smile as they lined up.
“Have fun on your inane little lunch date,” Draco says frostily, reaching down to pull the comforter up and over him.
“It’s still true,” Draco sing songs, leaning back on his hands.
“But consider my suffering, Dara,” Harry offers, and she lets out a protracted moan, slouching against the floor.
“That where you’ve been sneaking off to at night?” Blaise asked, having the tact to look serious.
The next morning he didn’t wake, merely put his book down and crawled from behind his curtains when he heard Blaise rusting outside.
“Ellen thinks it’s funny to call me a sad boy. She says all sad boys look emaciated and wear jumpers and that it’s not an emotion but a lifestyle,” Draco says, raising his eyebrows at Ellen, who looks tremendously pleased with herself.
Dara snorts, buttoning her garish purple raincloak with a look up at the sky, which has been slowly clouding over all night. “He like that in bed too?”
Harry absolutely is staring at him, and when Draco catches his eye, he jerks his head towards the kitchen door. Draco can’t imagine that Harry is insinuating what he thinks Harry is insinuating, but then he does the weird head jerk again, stands up rather awkwardly and leaves the kitchen.
Reina Patel, Mysteries of the Forbidden Forest
Draco wasn’t quite as delicate as he’d been when they were younger but he’d never lost his effeminate build, his chest lean and narrow even after all his Quidditch training. They both had seeker’s bodies, light and awkward with sharp angles and long lines.
“No, we should definitely make them kiss,” Ginny repeats. “Draco, come kiss Harry.”
Draco snorted at that, smiling as the snake slowly crawled back up his arm and found a home around his shoulders. “Of course it does, only you would be so stupid as to say something like that.”
“After all we’ve been through, Potter? Truly, I’m offended,” Draco drawled from behind him, making him jump and turn around.
“Not to me,” Draco said.
Draco brings his wand to Harry’s face and murmurs something under his breath that makes the cut knit, the skin stretching and tightening over the bloodied area. Harry remembers waking up next to him when he’d accidentally stayed over, how Draco had looked exhausted even while he slept, how in the morning he’d slunk out with barely a word. For all that Harry does to pretend that he hadn’t cared at all when they’d kissed those nights in the bathroom stall, it had been nice, nice enough that when everyone else found out he’d shoved it away and pretended it hadn’t been anything. He’s still terrified by how much wanting to punch Draco and wanting to kiss Draco feel the same in his stomach, how the feeling never went away.
It was a cold November day, and even Harry’s chunky Weasley sweater let in the frigid dampness that was creeping in under the windowpanes. She thought she might be getting marginally better at the dancing thing, though whether that was due to practice or sheer dumb luck, she couldn’t be sure.
Draco feels a little lightheaded, but overall very appeased. It’s absolutely bonkers that he’s had sex with Blaise Zabini and that wasn’t the sexiest thing that’s ever happened to him. What a day. What a world. “This is the sexiest thing that’s ever happened to me,” Draco says, as if he’s commenting on the weather, and it makes Harry laugh, which has pretty much become Draco’s entire mission.
They entered a clearing lit by dipping and bobbing lightning bugs, some like the ones Draco had seen charmed to fly around the Malfoy gardens as a boy and some like nothing he’d ever seen before, lighting up in shades of bright pink and soft blue, glittering and floating through the air.
“I’m not,” Harry protests, perhaps too strongly. “I just can’t figure it out. Why tamper with the potion now? Why do it at all?”
Everything is shattered and he doesn’t know how to fix it.
Harry almost laughs at her severity, but he’s fairly sure she wouldn’t take too kindly to that. He trudges over to the sink in his sweats as she levitates a garland up above one of the door frames and tosses an ornament in Ron’s direction. “You know it’s not even December yet, right?”
As they walked, Harry spotted Draco and her cronies coming towards them, laughing as they kicked the snow up in fans of sparkling white. Draco was wearing that ridiculous cloak with the fur collar again and she looked chilly and bright in the snow, the tip of her nose pink.
“What?” Draco asked, something in his eyes betrayed, something in his casual demeanor beginning to break already. Harry had hoped he would have known, that being a creation of the forest would have meant that mirage Draco would understand why he had to leave and would kiss him goodbye one last night. He hadn’t thought he’d have to explain, that maybe mirage Draco would miss him.
Draco stares at him with his wild gray eyes, a manic laugh spilling from his lips and bouncing gleefully off the tile. “You can’t possibly be saying this to me.”
“What are you working on?” Harry asks, gesturing to the black grease smeared across the tips of Draco’s fingers.
Harry’s the one who finally pulls back, holding Draco’s face in both hands so he can breathe for a moment. The lipstick is smeared like he thought it would be, dark red and paler pink around the curve of his mouth. Draco has something wild in his eyes and it makes Harry grin wider than he can fathom, leaning into Draco’s neck and dragging lipstick kisses across the skin there.
“Yeah,” Harry said, trying to be soft too. “I wanted to ask you why, but I didn’t think you wanted me to know.”
“Don’t you think we should-” Harry started, half kissed, half bemused. “Talk about this?”
“So you’d rather I’d just left you to die?!” Harry yelled, knowing that she was poking at old wounds even as she did so. Here she was, letting Draco drag her back into a feud they’d been feeding since they were eleven.
“Are you quite finished?” Harry says, once he seems to have talked himself into exhaustion.
“Seemed fun,” Harry explains. “You lot were all on holiday so Millie and I made plans.”
“Is that yours?” Harry asks, taking a tentative step closer. Since school started in the fall he feels like he’s had enough of these semi-uncomfortable encounters with Draco to last a lifetime. They don’t scream at each other anymore, Draco just raises his eyebrows and Harry tries not to say anything stupid and it feels like creeping through a china shop with his inevitably clumsy hands. “What have you got in there?”
Harry thought about pushing him back and helping him undress, slowly removing every piece of clothing until it was just Draco in the glow of the trees. The intimacy of the thought drew a small sound from his lips, one that Draco chased with his tongue, and Harry forgot about anything that would mean that they had to stop kissing.
For a long time, Draco never fucks him like he hates him. He had wanted that, he thinks, to be fucked like a horrible thing, to scrape darkness on the way down. Draco fucks him like it’s a job, like he’s trying to do something right and perfectly, like he’s performing.
On the topic of someone else’s disaster of a life, you really must stop allowing yourself to get plastered all over the front of the Prophet. While plastered. Ha. You need a publicist. Maybe a therapist. I hope to Merlin you have a therapist, I can’t imagine that PTSD is pretty.
“It’s nice back here,” Harry says. Everything smells vaguely of burnt plastic and the whole place is covered in detritus, but Harry has the vague feeling that someone knows the order to it. He wonders if Malfoy does.
“Well what do you want to do?” Harry asked, glancing over at the forest like she might have answers.
“I think you’ve lost your edge,” Harry says. “I haven’t wanted to punch you in ages. It used to be a weekly problem. Do you remember how often I had to physically hold Ron back?”
“That’s what I thought you said,” Harry says. He’s vaguely aware that neither of them have actually meaningfully cleaned themselves, and that in many ways this is the least successful shower he’s ever had. There are other ways in which this is the most successful shower, like the way Draco has started breathing heavily into his ear again and seems to be trying very hard to be quiet, something Harry is very interested in exploring.
Everything that Harry wants to say to him seems so trite, something about how they should see each other after this, how it really meant a lot that Draco would come after him, how he’s glad that it all had to happen this way, even if so much of it was so dumb.
“That’s okay.”
Draco reached his hand out, slowly like he wasn’t sure he wanted to do it. Harry took his hand before he could snatch it back, feeling his skin and the small bones of his fingers, all undeniably real.
“Brave words from someone quoting Mrs. Weasley’s romance novels,” Harry says, packing his things back into his work bag.
Harry already knows he’s bad at this. He knows that if Draco tried he could open him up like overripe cantaloupe, that he could see everything. It’s such an overwhelming thought that it only manifests in a low hum of terror and doesn’t break through his composure.
“Puts a real damper on our plan to beat the shit out of whatever Ministry shill was going to bring us dinner,” Harry says, going to investigate what looks to be a rather measly collection of fruits and sandwiches. “Apple?”
He looks up when Harry comes in, circles under his eyes like he hasn’t been sleeping again. “Find more things that need fixing?” he asks wanly, adjusting the beanie he’s thrown haphazardly onto his head.
“Everyone looks so nice,” Harry murmured as the minutes ticked on. “And happy, everyone looks so happy.”
“Just be careful. With him and with you.” She smiles at him, a stray curl sneaking out of her ponytail like it has a mind of his own. She’s grown up so much since they left school, all of the energy she used to put into bossing them around going straight into her job. He can still see all the insecurities that barely bother her anymore and is sure she can see the same in him, which is just as comforting as it is terrifying.
When Harry comes back a few days later, there’s a woman standing near the counter who doesn’t look like she belongs there. She’s wearing shiny little heels and her hair is neatly cropped, and by the time Harry realizes who she is, it’s too late to leave.
Potter lets out brief exhalation that’s vaguely disbelieving. Draco feels like scoffing back at him something along the lines of ‘
“You gonna tell me who it is?” Ron asked, pouring more of the liquid on the cotton ball and swabbing at Harry’s throat.
“Back straight, please,” Draco said as they moved, and Harry did her best to adjust, the addition of ‘please’ instead of a barked order surprising her. She had a feeling that Draco’s near constant tired berating was her trying to be nice. Harry wondered if she had any other settings, and was once again hit with the mental image of Draco Malfoy attempting romance and had to repress giggles.
Draco was so completely affronted that she pulled their dancing to a complete halt. “You’d think by now you would have picked up some manners,” Draco hissed. “Greg’s my friend and we’re going to the Yule Ball together because we’re friends and my sexuality isn’t any of your business!” She wrenched herself very dramatically out of the waltz hold. “I’m getting a drink!”
He really didn’t know what he wanted other than that he wanted to have him, whatever that meant. It was an ugly feeling but by that point, Draco had grown a lot of ugly feelings, and he was still trying to pull all of them out.
Draco wanted to kiss him again, properly this time. It was pathetic, and it made him want to kick something, to tear something apart because it wasn’t fair that he couldn’t, it wasn’t fair that Harry wouldn’t want to, not even in the forest. He deserved just the smallest bit of something, even if it was stolen dream kisses.
“You sure the bathroom is the best place?” Harry asks. “Might get caught.”
“I don’t think so,” Harry replies.
“You’re the stability I need in my life,” Lee says with a wink, ferrying their orders back to the kitchen.
“Glad to know my hair is a losing battle,” Harry replies wanly, and Draco shrugs, looking pleased with himself.
“She said they were practicing new playing strategies,” Neville replied with a shrug, pulling off a pair of meticulously crocheted gloves that Luna had made for him. They were delicately beaded and in a soft burgundy color that was lovely on him.
“I had a few minutes so I thought I’d say hi,” Harry says, even though it’s not enough to explain this. Draco already knows he’s ridiculous and that’s beginning to be okay with him.
Harry said nothing of the sort, just stared at him with an almost compassion in his eyes. “I’m sorry about your mum.”
Draco looks at him doubtfully, but takes his tea cup back and sits at the armchair across from him. In its cage, a small brown owl makes happy little morning noises, but otherwise the apartment has the same calm, semi-quiet that Harry’s does in the morning.
“What are we even doing here?” Draco asked, throwing his arms out and striding toward Harry, who was still sitting on the ground. He had a bit of a stomp in his step, like however the forest had managed to conjure him up, he wasn’t happy about it.
There’s a long pause. “Potter?”
“You can’t make fun of me,” Harry replies, because if she laughs he thinks he might have to move to the forest and spend the rest of his life as a hermit. He has camping experience. He could probably do it.
“Maybe,” he says. Hermione doesn’t have all the details, she just knows they’re looking for a shady supplier of questionable potions ingredients. “The assistant is innocent at least, she had some decent descriptions of the suppliers, confirmed a lot of what we already knew.”
“Just petrified,” Hermione agrees. “The nail tapping was an exquisite touch.”
“It’s different,” Harry protests. “People just want to sleep with me because I’m famous. And they usually just yell, they aren’t like, I don’t know, nice and stuff?”
“Coming, love,” Narcissa calls back, a clattering of china floating in from the kitchen. Her voice is familiar from the trials and before and Harry wants to hide or sink through the cream colored carpet. “Sit down, make yourself comfortable.”
The next memory, when Harry finally manages to grab onto something other than the angry flash of her eyes, is their first kiss. Harry feels a stab of something unfamiliar that smacks of revulsion. He doesn’t think it belongs to him. Harry doesn’t try to reignite the snuffed out anger this time, just settles in the memory with a tired kind of helplessness.
“Quite.” Draco says, going pink. “I actually found something on Opal as well, in a similar vein.”
“Really? You don’t still think I’m a tosser?” Draco asks. “But I try so hard.”
Draco can’t imagine describing this kiss as cute.
It was only as he considered going to Defense Against the Dark Arts that he was forced to admit that a large part of his illness corresponded to the fact that seeing Potter after what he’d done was simply too mortifying to contemplate. He felt sure that Potter would be able to sense it somehow, and that if he had to be in his vicinity he’d turn into a nervous wreck.
“She told me not to tell,” Harry replied, thinking with great fondness of the bright pink cloak.
Harry stops to look at him, no words coming to his lips.
“It appears that they’ve allied,” Draco says. “Of fucking course.”
“I wonder if we could find out if they still talk,” Harry muses.
“It’s like, it’s unpredictability. If I don’t know what’s going to happen, I can’t breathe,” his breath hitched to punctuate it. “There’s other stuff. I still wake up terrified mother has been murdered. That the Dark Lord is back.”
“It’s just the forest,” Draco said, sounding pained in his repetition. “It doesn’t matter if it’s only in the forest.”
The forest pushed a small grove of flowers up around Hermione’s feet, laughing when the witch stopped walking with a start. Hermione reached down to touch the flowers, her fingers gentle on the petals, and the forest appreciated how careful she was. The forest remembered her, all petulance and stubbornness, and admired her brutality, her particular brand of bravery.
Harry points at the baseboard. “The flowers. I’ve been here before, I know the print.”
“You know better than the Wizengamot?” Harry asked, keeping his voice calm. He didn’t dare look up to see if Malfoy had turned around. “He was pardoned. They paid their reparations.”
“Fuck if I know,” Draco said, kicking harder.
“The Catcher In The Rye.”
“Can you please just take off your shirt. You’re torturing me,” Draco says.
“Of course,” Hermione said, smiling right back at him.
“Does it sound better to you if I say ‘I mention Potter to you and suddenly you forget how to breathe?’” she asked, raising her eyebrows. “What’s wrong?”
“Your parents,” Draco clarifies. “I don’t know you managed without them.”
“Something or boyfriend?” Draco replies, in that aristocratic, clipped little voice that means he’s trying not to let his feelings show.
“It is, its bollocks and it’s stupid,” Harry says, angrily spearing a piece of broccoli. Draco is giving him a weird, unreadable look again so Harry ploughs on, unable to stop himself. “I’m serious, I’m fucking sick of it. It was fucking stupid when Lupin had to resign for being a werewolf and its even stupider now. It’s not like you chose to be one, and even if you did, who fucking cares. Being a werewolf has fuck all to do with what kind of person someone is. It’s complete bollocks.”
His mind spun in circles. If the forest made up Draco, that could mean that she was trying to coax him into feeling things again. If she made Draco up from real Draco’s image, it might mean that real Draco wanted to kiss him. Very unlikely. If she’d made him up from Harry’s head, then maybe Harry had always wanted Draco to kiss him. Horrifying. Confusing.
Harry lifts his head, realizing that in the foggy blur of last night he’d forgotten to set an alarm. “How’d you get in?”
“How much do I owe?” Harry asks, pulling out his wallet. He thinks that talking to Draco Malfoy might become an expensive hobby, but he can’t imagine why he would have assumed anything else.
“Oh for Salazar’s sake, Potter,” Draco says, looking unmoored in the dining room. “This is a disaster already and you’ve made it worse.”
“What’s he done now?” Dara asks. Their daily run ins with Millence Filbin, the most irritating and horrible secretary known to Wizardkind, would be untenable if they weren’t so ridiculous they crossed over into hilarity.
Draco smiles, finally, small and genuine. “You’re alright.” He leans in to Harry’s ear, whispering, his eyes shut tight. “I might like you a little.”
“I’m trying,” Harry replied, trying to lighten the mood. “Don’t look so serious, would you? You’d think I was on my death bed.”
It was beautiful, all the happiness they’d managed to find again, so much she could barely hold it anymore. She didn’t think she was going to cry but it was a similar feeling, like love or want, something base and wild that threatened to carry her under. It wouldn’t, but she wanted to wade into it, sit on the window and feel it for just a moment.
“Luna.”
“I don’t know what I’ll do,” Draco begins, his voice terrible, clutching Harry to his chest. “If you don’t stop talking like this.”
“Ellen has work in the morning,” Harry replies, reaching for Draco’s arm. He melts into Harry’s touch, barely even humming disapproval when Harry guides him towards the door. “And I have to go, Ron’s picking me up for brunch in the morning.”
Draco gets up for more wine and comes back a few minutes later with a lipstick print on his cheek and a tired smile. Before Harry can comment on the lip print, a brown haired man perches next to them on the edge of the couch, a cheeky grin on his face. Harry remembers being ignored by muggle children at best and harassed at worst but the man is smiling and warm like everyone else here.
“Not in our agreement,” Hermione replies breezily, in a way that makes Draco suddenly so, so sure that the answer is threesome. “Spill.”
In some ways it was better, even if it felt strange for it all to cut off like that, all outward expressions of their childhood animosity dulled after all the death. Fighting seemed especially petty after so many on both sides had died.
“You know, on the other hand, I am enjoying making her a bit jealous,” Hermione mused. “All in good fun.”
“I’m bisexual, you freak,” she says, turning back to Hermione and Harry. “Draco’s an idiot cocksucker.”
“That’s a fair point,” he agreed, and Harry scowled at their taking of sides.
He wanted to talk over her, to stop her from coming to the conclusions he knew she’d come to, but in the floral lightness of the forest and the depth of the night he couldn’t come to excuses fast enough. He gaped at her, reduced to pleading only with his eyes, hoping that when she arrived at the truth she’d be gentle.
“It’s safe here, can’t you feel it?” Draco said, watching the way panic flared in Harry’s eyes, his breathing too fast, just like Draco’s.
“What?” Harry takes a grumpy sip of wine, wishing Draco wouldn’t always look like he knew all the answers.
Dara shrugs, her filmy purple scarf floating down her shoulder. “It seemed genuine to me. You’re welcome to look into her some more if you’d like, if you fancy a two hour long treatise on caterpillars.” Dara sighs, looks up at the ceiling in despair. “Sorry. I’m traumatized from how much I know about cocoons now. We could probably go back and see what she was up to during the war or if she’s ever on the record talking about how she feels about werewolves, but I really think she’s just a rich old lady.”
“Why would you believe her over me?” Harry asks, feeling guilty and childish all at once. “You don’t have to worry about it, we’re like, working on things.”
“Watch your mouth or I’ll drag you along next year,” Harry says, only blushing a bit at the implication that this will last until then. Draco makes a face but there’s a sparkle behind it, and Harry thinks he would go with a bit of persuading.
“We go to the same school,” Draco snipped back as she slipped an arm around Harry. “But yeah,” she amended, in her soft voice. “I’ll see you.”
“Not sick,” he replied, taking a long sip of his tea. He didn’t think he could stomach food, there wasn’t much room in there around all the nerves.
At this point, Harry can barely tell the Death Eaters’ names apart, all the faces and atrocities running together, but Draco looks as if he can remember names and actions far too well.
“I hope you get stuck with Goyle,” Harry replied, and Parvati just shrugged her shoulders as McGonagall began to pair students off.
Pansy purses her lips at him. It’s only his expert reading of her facial expressions that allows him to detect that she does think he’s being a bit cute. “Alright, who has kissed Draco?” She raises her hand, as does Blaise, but the rest of the party looks tremendously relieved to not have to put their hands up again. “Very shocking.”
“It’s just the forest,” Harry said, deliberately goading. Not mean this time, more curious. All the unwieldy feelings he’d spoken to Ron about gushed forward in a messy landslide, turning and wheeling in his chest. Draco Malfoy looked pretty in the forest glow and he was unhinged and serious and kissed with a desperate fervor; those were some of the only facts Harry could get his hands on. “You don’t have to pretend here. You can be anything you want.”
Harry lay down on the forest floor and stared up at the canopy, listening to Draco’s breathing beside him as he did the same.
Draco looks like he doesn’t want to answer. Harry doesn’t say that if they were really going to give up, they would have by now. “Me neither.”
“Yes.”
“Exactly.”
“Maybe for you,” Harry says, not feeling overly repentant. “She didn’t seem upset.”
“Good grief,” Harry says, as Lee laughs at his own cleverness.
“Sorry for wasting your time,” Harry says, sliding the radio off of the counter. Malfoy frowns but doesn’t respond. Harry heads out, radio tucked under his arm.
“Are you afraid of what I’ll find?” Draco asks, calm like they have all the time in the world.
“No, nothing like that,” Harry replies, feeling uncomfortably like he’s not going to be able to tell her about this without it sounding beyond strange.
“This is a good place to hide,” Harry says quietly, and he hopes Malfoy understands the implications of that statement. Some part of him wants permission to hide here too.
“Indeed.” Draco frowns at the article. “It seems out there and I don’t like her tone.”
“I’ll get it from the back,” Draco says, turning to disappear behind the blue curtain. Harry doesn’t follow even though he wants to, picking up a sharpie and doodling a flower on the counter as he waits. He likes that everything here is a little worn, close to broken or recently fixed, but still usable. He thinks that might be part of the reason he feels so comfortable here, because he identifies a lot with that.
“Maybe she doesn’t even think we’re enemies anymore,” Harry said, surprised to feel something genuine and heavy at the thought.
“No,” Draco says. “We’re closed Mondays and Tuesdays. And Jasmine is busy tomorrow. She and her alarming friends are having…“ Draco clears his throat, looking pained. “A pool party. Day after should be fine.”
“Try and be nice,” Hermione advised, giving her a tired smile. “If you’re not back at 8:45 we’ll send a search party.”
Harry realizes too late that he doesn’t know what to say. He remembers the muddy aftermath of the war, when Draco was going around looking so sorry, throwing money at anything that needed it, going to ministry charity balls and looking taciturn, drawn. Harry had expected it to feel good, seeing Draco fall from grace, but it hadn’t.
Harry narrowed his eyes, wondering where the forest got this Draco from, if maybe she’d gotten him mixed up with someone else, if it had been so long since she’d known him that she’d become confused.
41. At one point or another, Draco could have chosen to be safe. It might have been safer to quietly collude with the Death Eaters with the knowledge that the institutions would always protect them, that no one would ever face consequences, that Malfoys would always be able to pay their way back into the world’s good graces, as easy as pushing a body into a lake, weighing it down again and again no matter how many times it bloated and rose to the surface.
McGonagall had announced a few months prior that they were having a Yule Ball, in the hopes that it would raise morale and promote inter house unity. Harry wasn’t exactly overjoyed about it: parties were fun but getting all dressed up was a bit of a hassle.
“Of course,” Harry replies, finding himself lingering. He doesn’t know why he does this, why leaving Draco is always so difficult.
“The main character was a miserable prat,” Draco said.
“This isn’t fucking Grease, Potter,” Draco said, startling a grin out of Harry.
Draco ground down against him with a quiet moan, his cock hard against Harry’s thigh. Harry reached around Draco’s arse, pulling him up so they fit together, rolling his hips up so his cock slid against Draco’s.
“Now see that would be borrowing without permission,” Draco says, pulling out a pot of golden shimmer and setting it on the tile with a clink. “I think this will work, I’m not going to do foundation.”
Lee looks beside himself. “Crêpes gratuites pour vous la prochaine fois que vous visitez si vous parlez français avec moi.”
“It’s not too bad,” Malfoy replies, picking up some scattered screws and setting them in a plastic container before sliding onto an old bar stool with a cracked sparkly-red cover. “So are you going to tell me why you’re here?”
“Sassy,” Harry replied, and tread on his toes for the fifteenth time.
Draco shook his head, hands knocking against his thighs. “I don’t know.”
“Good note,” Draco says, pressing their foreheads together, his lips brushing against Harry’s open mouth.
“You better actually sleep,” Draco says, slinging his bag over his shoulder.
60. Draco agrees to fake his own death. Harry doesn’t know how it’s gone on this long, feels as if he should have been found out by now, is surprised he hasn’t been. No game can be played forever and besides, Harry can’t go on like this, on the knife’s edge.
“Harry, I’m taking out your trash for you,” Ron yells from the kitchenette. “Because I am a shining example of a good friend and I care deeply about you.”
“Of course,” Harry says. “See you later.” He kicks off and rises up into the sunshine. When he glances back down at Draco, he’s still watching him from the porch, face tilted up to the sky.
Pansy looks like she’s trying very hard not to be charmed by Blaise and not succeeding. This is fair, Blaise is very winning. “Alright, Millie, what’s your excuse?”
After what seemed like ages, he sat down in a small clearing the forest procured for him, pleased to find that the velvety moss was exactly as soft as it appeared. He wasn’t sure if Draco would show up that night, he was comforted by the conviction that he wasn’t as alone as he’d been before, that he only had to wait patiently enough.
“I’m glad to hear it,” McGonagall said, making it sound distinctly like a warning as she went to check on other couples.
“It’s a secret language that lords and ladies used, where they’d send messages by giving each other flowers. Pansy used to send me camellias all the time, they mean good luck.” Draco says. “You could send your friends back home messages with flowers.”
Ron is told the news over what should be a quiet dinner.
“I think mummy was the look Ron was going for,” Ginny replied, wiggling about in the yarn wrap.
“It was fourth year!” Harry protested, though the point remained that if Cho ever decided to explore bisexuality, Harry would, most entirely, be her girl.
The Worst thing you can think of:
“There’s a chair over there. I’m going to take this apart in the back,” Malfoy says, voice tepid and smooth. His drawl isn’t mocking like it used to be, and Harry feels off balance without it.
Best,
Neville held his hands up for Hermione to inspect. “Not a clue. I’m sure they’d be delighted to tell you, I think they want to start a knitting club.”
“I most certainly am not,” Draco shot back, his flush going at least one shade deeper.
“Oh, shut your ugly mug,” Harry hears Ron say, which sends a wave of relief over him so powerful that he feels weak at the knees. There’s an additional hubbub, and Harry hears Ron swear loudly.
“I’ll tell her,” Harry said. “Thanks though.”
For a moment, Harry thinks Draco is just going to stare at him with dinner plate eyes instead of answering. “I just assumed you wanted to forget about it.”
Draco laughed, and Harry felt a smile tug at his lips at how silly that word sounded.
“Hi,” Harry says, the little charisma he has deserting him. “It’s uh, nice to meet you too.”
“Me neither,” Draco replies. “Father told me that men don’t have nightmares and surprisingly, that did nothing either.” He’s sharing too much but Potter still has laughter lines on his face and they’re talking about their bad dreams, for fucks sake.
He suspected it was worse to be a coward who couldn’t do what needed to be done when it needed doing, wanted to believe he could have cast it if it had been necessary, was terrified, in all cases, of being wrong.
“Shame we don’t have Hermione’s makeup,” Harry says with a smile. It’s a bit fun, watching Draco observe him clinically as he sits down next to him, his long legs curling underneath him and his hair falling back into his face.
“Shut up,” Draco said, sounding like he was on the verge of hyperventilating as he pulled Harry through the edges of the forest and onto the lawn. They broke out of the forest and into the clean night, both of them still as real and solid and they’d been before.
