“What the bloody...?” Hermione murmured, and Ron frowned too, holding Rose's hand firmly without realizing it, causing the girl to moan 'daddy!' before yanking her hand out of his grip.
The child was a newborn little boy. He had light brown hair and brown eyes and was so small. As soon as they bat their eyes on their child, they felt love running through their bodies. Draco held the baby in his arms, his eyes wet with tears as he smiled to their baby.
. She sang so prettily that her role was a given. Zabini was the Sun, and it was also fitting. Harry had to admit that the tenor had a beautiful voice that complimented Luna’s, and their appearances were so perfect for the roles they interpreted. He did look like the Sun, his dark skin vibrating with alpha energy, his eyes intense as fire.
It was like they couldn’t stop now they’d gotten started, and Draco felt like never before. He had never needed a boyfriend, he was okay with his imagination, and his  fiction, but now that he kissed Harry, he knew he’d never be able to go back.
“Hm…” Harry cleared his throat before speaking, his cock stirring alive because of the vision in front of him. “I’m… I’m a bit different from the other blokes so I feel…”
“Arsehole,” I insulted, and Ron snorted.
-x-x-
“Good?” Harry asked, his cock still red and angry with need.
What kind of shifter was he? Probably something big, maybe a deer, like his Patronus? It wasn’t uncommon that shifter animals were the same as the Patronus of the wizard.
He slicked his cock with the lube on his hand, and lined it with Draco’s hole, pressing into it in one slow motion. Draco tilted his head back, resting it on Harry’s shoulder, his mouth open in a silent moan, eyes closed in pleasure. Harry had to bite his lower lip so he wouldn’t moan when he saw Draco press his teeth together and breath through them, thing he always did when the burn was
“I... I'm bi. Bisexual, I mean,” Harry said with a sigh, and Draco turned his face to him again.
“I love you, Draco.”
“Good. Now I need you to go completely into the lake and wash yourself well, okay? I'll get you some dry clothes.” Harry said, leaving the lake, but Dracy held out his arms with a desperate look. “Calm down, I'm not going to run away with her.”
her tongue, nodding.
“You’re my mate,” I whispered softly, and his arms tightened around me.
“Hey, Greg.”
“Do you want to debut our new bed?” Harry asked against Draco's lips, who answered with a smile.
That vision was enough to push Harry over the edge, and he came inside Draco, filling him with hot come, pressing his crotch against his arse hard enough that his knuckles turned white. When the post-sex fatigue got to them, Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, and slowly slipped out of him.
In late June, Harry could clearly see the delicate, round curve of Draco's belly. There was a baby in there. Harry felt an intense urge to touch and kiss that little bit of himself inside Draco, but he knew that his lover was not comfortable with that part of his body. Draco pretended that his belly didn't exist, and that there was nothing different about himself. It hurt Harry, but he didn't know how to talk to Draco about it without making him even sadder.
The sweetest voice on the whole planet Earth called him, and Draco turned from where he was Reading a potions magazine to his three year old son, James.
Of course, he didn’t trust himself to tell Draco about these feelings, but he’d never stop being his best friend when his blond little kitten needed him. No way.
“Honey and sausages are delicious, I don’t care what you both think,” Draco said, defensively, and Harry only smiled at him.
“Yes, and Castor will be in my arms,” Draco said. “I think if we sit him on my right leg, the baby bump will be visible.”
“Okay, but be careful. Put your arms like this,” Harry helped him with his arms position with one of his hands, and carefully put Aries on his brother’s arms, a careful hand under the baby’s head.
“You mean… Like… Raw fucking and… you know, coming inside and all?” Harry raised his eyebrows, surprised green eyes wide behind his spectacles.
On the next day, as Draco arrived at work, it took him about 10 minutes to open Harry’s office’s door. He was clearly relieved when he saw all his things to one side of the office, and looked back at Harry, his shoes a bit wet.
Harry was damn handsome, and he didn’t look like he was gay at all. He didn’t even sound like he was gay. His house gave nothing away. Draco looked at his hands, but he couldn’t see any rings there. Maybe Draco was without any action for way too much time, he wasn’t the type of guy to obsessively wonder if a person was gay or not, but here he was, wishing and hoping that  Harry was gay.
It was Tuesday, a normal working day. He was sleepy because he had slept badly. The latter case had exhausted him, but the night before, he and Ron had finally managed to solve it. Robbards had given Ron two days off, which was well received, because Hugo had been born recently and he barely had time to be with his newborn son. Harry had no one waiting at home, not even a cat, so he decided it was best to trade the two days off for the possibility of waking up two hours later on those two days and working as usual.
“An experience for when you are in Auror training. I assume that is still what you want?”
He turned to Lucy as soon as he was finished, and frowned. She had some red berries in her hand, and her eyes had taken on that shadow that had haunted them since discovering the pregnancy.
“I'm hungry too.” Harry leaned against Dracy, his cock slowly becoming limp as he watched his baby there.
“And you haven’t thought not even for a second that he’d be a very nice person to kiss?”
“These boots are Gucci!” Malfoy stamped his foot, frowning.
“You already have Hermione. Besides, Draco won last night and I’m counting on him winning again.”
“Yeah, exactly like in Potter’s Inc.”
“He was okay when we had Castor, wasn’t he?” Sirius nodded, even if he still looked a bit nervous. “He’ll be okay now, too. Just promise me you will take care of your brothers and you’ll do what uncle Ron and aunt Hermione tell you.”
Harry jumped from the bed, hugging Draco so tight he lifted him from the ground. He couldn’t help the happy tears that fell down his face, as they cried, smiled and kissed each other surrounded by their child’s magical print.
As Harry observed his babies, Aries started to fuss, and before he could wake his siblings, Harry took him in his arms and rocked him slightly. His eyes filled with tears as he tried to hold back his feelings.
Only their flower crowns remained.
Now it was certain: they were trapped on that island forever.
“Even if he is my mate, which he may or may not be, I’m not… This is not the reason why I want him to go with us.” I explained, and Ron nodded with a grin as if he didn’t believe me but was playing along. “I’m telling the truth!”
The slashing, pulling, and throwing had taken the same speed as his breathing, and he was already pleased when he heard a shriek from where Draco was. Worried that he had hit a coconut in his head, Harry got down as fast as he could, watching the pile of leaves Draco had separated, along with some twigs. malfoy was squirming a few feet away and didn't seem to have a concussion.
Dracy looked down at the girl between them, who already had her eyes closed, even though her hand hadn't loosened from Dracy's blond strands.
Draco was braiding another jute rope while Harry made a fourth hole deep in the floor. His fingers were red, but Draco was no longer so uncomfortable with the braiding. There were calluses on his hands now, and although he didn't like the look of it, he admitted that the diminished sensitivity helped a lot as he made ropes and ropes for their new endeavor. Fortunately, his period was over and he felt much more willing to help Harry build the new house.
The song Harry's singing is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNYM8uErtxE
“You’re welcome. Do you have any idea of what we can do to fix your office?”
“Draco… Fuck, Draco… I love you so much,” Harry whispered, and Draco looked up at him, his hands on Harry’s chest, his cheeks red and lips looking thoroughly kissed.
As Luna and Zabini prepared to dance accordingly to Malfoy’s solo, and we all get the papers with the
He walked towards the hut, but didn’t take them into it. He took Dracy into the fresh water of the lake, sitting him on the edge.
This is the song Draco is singing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yClrsbyCic&feature=emb_logo
“That’s all I can ask for.”
Harry smiled, but before he could reply, he heard Lavender’s voice from the door.
“To piss me off, maybe?" Malfoy sighed, licking his dry lips and grimacing in pain. “I am very hungry.”
It was a long 20 minutes, the longest since Harry entered the battle against Voldemort himself. When Harry felt the baby's head at his fingertips, he helped as he could while Dracy pushed. As soon as the head came out, Harry helped pull the rest of the baby's body out of the water. His hands were shaking, and he didn't realise he was crying, even when the baby screamed loudly, their little lungs showing that they were perfect.
“Harry… I think we should stop using contraceptive spells.” Draco said, raising a hand and caressing Harry’s hair, brushing it with his fingers.
“I don’t have anyone.” Harry was fast to reply. “I mean, now I have you. And I don’t want you to go either. You can write here, can’t you?”
“I can’t believe... I don’t know what happened to me... Harry, I never…”
It was what Harry needed to let his orgasm take over, and he came, long spurts of come inside of Draco. Draco rolled his eyes back, coming again a second, small orgasm, just from the feel of Harry’s heat inside of him with no protection.
As they said it, their respective beds changed colour to their house colour. Harry smiled, magic always something that surprised him out of nowhere like he was still that little boy of eleven. Their trunks were near the wardrobe, and Harry pulled his close to his bed.
“Is this the time where we kiss each other?”
After a couple of seconds, he looked up at Harry, frowning his eyebrows.
“Well... First of all, I believe
“Of course,” he nodded. “And when you’re ready, you just tell me. I’ll be here.”
His host then showed him the house, telling him to make himself at home. It was still early in the day, around eleven AM, although the sky outside of the window was so dark it almost looked like it was night. The sky was even darker than before, and Draco looked at the windows, the cold outside preventing him from really seeing anything.
“I just… Feel uncomfortable.” Harry answered honestly, and Draco frowned.
, and licked. I moaned, because it made my whole body explode with pleasure.
how you’re going to ask me to marry you, Ronald Weasley. I accept nothing less than a dinner night.
I love Dan Vasc's voice, but I imagine Harry's voice is like Avi Kaplan's.
“Harry, do you think you’ll be okay with that?” Hermione asked, touching his shoulder. He breathed in, nodding.
“I really can’t do anything else? Cleaning old stuff with Filch, perhaps?” I tried, and Professor McGonagall sighed, giving me a piece of parchment.
was my moon, and I felt safe to show it to him.
“Let me decide who’s worthy of my friendship or not, will you? I’m the one who was under his wand once, and I forgave him. He’s done nothing to you. Can’t you be less of a prick and think before acting?” Harry asked again, now pulling Draco under his arm and holding him by his shoulders. “Don’t bother us again. And tell your friends not to bother us again, either.”
“Great... Now let's bathe and eat... I'm starving.” Draco said, getting up and heading for the pond. Harry sighed, a smile on his face, following close behind.
Not all students came back, though. Some parents felt safer transferring their kids to other schools around the world, and others acquired permission from the Ministry to homeschool them.
“You’re my soulmate, Harry. We belong together and destiny brought me here, to you. I know I have a romance writer’s brain, but I have to be here. My flat isn’t my home. But you…” Draco said, and then he also got insecure. “Unless, you have someone…”
“So, Harry,” Draco threw himself on their settee, his oversized – no,
Luna's song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cBzMSPYKas
, but he forgot he
“Daddy!” She ran into his arms, and Ron held her tenderly, kissing the almost two year old girl on the cheeks. He turned to the woman, who had a book in her hands and baby Hugo held on her other arm, an anatomical pillow helping her to keep him quiet and comfortable. Ron approached his wife after placing Rose on the floor, kissing her thick hair and sighing.
Gradually, both Dracy and Harry began to learn small spells that helped them to have an easier day. Dracy was able to know with his fingertips whether his garden needed more water or nutrients, and Harry was able to levitate fruit for himself instead of having to climb trees to get it. The need made them begin to explore their magic in a more natural and intuitive way, different from how they had learned at Hogwarts. Gradually, Dracy managed to teach Harry the basics of healing, and Harry managed to teach Dracy how to conjure water. In turn, Harry was able to do more than just conjure water now. He was able to transfer clean water from the clearing straight to the pot to bathe Talitha, without having to go into the water with her if he didn't want to, as well as emptying some small puddles on the beach if he wanted to catch a fish without much difficulty.
“Hey, Harry, where were you?” Seamus asked, and Harry shrugged.
“Hm... Basic healing spells, wound cleaning, simple protection and repelling spells, from muggles, enemies... Ah, and silencing charm,” Draco said proudly, puffing out his chest.
-x-x-x-
“Well, maybe as soon as my cunt feels the regular size again,” Draco shrugged, and Harry laughed a little.
It was a pleasant conversation, but I didn’t feel safe enough to tell them how
“She is not limited by our expectations or limitations. This place... It's all she knows. The sun... The sea, our lagoon. She doesn't know what bricks are, she doesn't know what a wand is,” Harry touched Talitha's black eyebrows, went down her chubby cheek and to her shoulder. Around Tali's neck was a necklace made of jute with a blue shell hanging from it. “Talitha is what we would be if we weren't limited.”
His eyes turned completely yellow instead of the beautiful green, and he held me by my hips, turning me aggressively on my stomach.
They set everything up on the next day. They pushed Draco’s office settee to the winter area and grabbed a lot of blankets and pillows from their houses. Harry made some hot chocolate for them, then sat Draco on the settee, putting pillows around him and some blankets over him. Draco looked so comfy when Harry gave him his mug, and Draco sipped it, moaning softly with the taste.
It was September of 1999. Harry had his eighteenth birthday not long ago, but for whatever reason, he felt like he was eleven again, crossing the borders of Hogwarts for the first time after the War. He had gained weight after May of 1998, and he was taller and his muscles were showing. He was finally giving up his skinny and bony self to a more substantial build.
Harry didn't question him. He didn't want Draco to be uncomfortable and he knew that this moment wasn’t simple. Draco felt guilty for what happened, and even though Harry told him it was nobody's fault, Draco didn't seem convinced. Harry tried to make Draco understand that he had his full support, but several times he heard him crying in the middle of the night.
“Mama! 'Nana! Aaaaaah!” And opened her mouth as wide as she could.
“Daddy, can you read a story for me?” Saturn asked, yawning and rubbing his eyes.
Potter looked at me like I’d grown a second head.
As Draco observed his son’s sleeping form, Harry hugged him from behind.
After a while, he took Aries back and put the sleeping baby back into his cradle. Aries immediately looked for his brother, and Harry helped them to get closer together. Maybe, after so long hugging each other in the womb, they still needed that closeness to feel safe.
I was expecting his enormous cock to fill me, and it was so big, hard and delicious that I could see it even with my submissive position. He stroked himself, looking at my hole as if he had never seen an omega’s arsehole before. Instead of fucking me, though, he held me again by my hips and closed his mouth around my hole, making me scream in pleasure.
“But your old house is destroyed. There’s nothing left beside the lot,” Hermione said, frowning, and I nodded.
“In your dreams, Potter.”
I had the choir. And my mate. And it felt wonderful.
Draco lay on top of his chest, taking a deep breath and kissing his shoulder tenderly.
“Hey, daddy,” Draco whispered, a small smile in his lips.
Except, in my head, he was already
Finally, they were able to create a raft that not only floated but could support their weight. They also made two oars to help them in the process and, after picking coconuts and fruit for the trip, stated that they were ready to try to leave.
of that?”
I couldn’t help but fidget. Ron and Hermione were sitting beside me on a table at the library, and we were trying to study for the last exams before the holidays. I had two weeks before the Christmas play, and I felt a bit nauseous every time I thought of that. But at that particular moment, it wasn’t what was bugging me.
“I’m hungry, okay?!” Draco said after swallowing another mouthful. “And it’s delicious, especially with honey on top.”
Now he could feel the heat and moisture in his body. There was sand in his mouth, he was sure, and Harry could hear the distinct sound of a seagull, just as the waves came and went.
“We make a boat,” Harry said, sighing. “And we try to get out of here by sea. All we have to do is to get to any continent, any of them, and we can look for some magical society in there.”
“No. And you and I are going to have a talk after this. I know you did it on purpose,” Harry said, lowly and threatening, making Sirius shut his mouth and scurry over to the settee, sitting on his designated place.
“Sure. If your brothers and sister let us,” Harry smiled, and after the agreement, he started reading the story.
“Then yes, totally yes!” The boy agreed, and Harry smiled. Dustin was going to suffer a bit, but he’d be a good soldier.
. Of course, Draco never stopped being the spoiled brat he was, and he loved Harry’s attention. But the baby… Well, he just wanted to hold a baby and take care of them and be a good father, while having fun on the process of making one.
Harry already knew the way to the Professor’s quarters, from when he was searching for Peter Pettigrew in his third year. Thinking about Lupin made his heart clench a little, but he pushed the memory to the back of his head. He mourned a lot before coming to school, and it was now time to move on.
There was no way to carry the torch. Harry frowned, closing his eyes and wishing, with all his heart, that his path would be lit up. When he opened his eyes, small balls of light floated down the path towards the cabin, but Harry wasted no time in admiring his new magic. He had his world in his arms, and he needed to take care of them.
“What if people see us together?”
After planting all the seeds, Draco stood up, touching his chest with his fingertips and making a face. His breasts were still very sensitive, and the tank top he was wearing no longer made his chest flat, as it did before. His small breasts were considerably larger, and they hurt. Draco thought this was due to his menstrual period being close, but the day had come and gone and the little monster had not arrived.
Eventually, the days got a little better. Draco was still introspective and silent, but there was a gleam in his eyes that had died before. He sought out Harry at night to sleep snugly, and wasn’t reluctant to eat or do his daily activities, which Harry thought was a victory. He still showed no interest in sex, and Harry continued to say nothing about it. He hoped that eventually Draco would go back to what he was, but Harry knew he needed time to think.
“And what was it?” Leo insisted, almost bouncing with energy.
, Potter!” Malfoy answered, and his hands shook. “Come here, hold this.” Malfoy practically ordered, and Harry stood up quickly, reaching out and holding the object he was pointing at: it was a shell-shaped brooch. Whatever Malfoy was expecting didn't happen, and he let out an agonised groan.
When they were all around the fire - that Harry had to create manually - , with the fish roasting and the seaweed washed, Roberto looked around, staring at the hut they had made.
“Harry… Please… fuck me… Knot me… Give me your babies…”
“What song was that?”
” Draco looked up at him with tears in his eyes. “Baby, we have a girl!”
“Thank you for coming to me, my love,” Harry responded, and touched his nose to Draco’s nose, their engagement rings touching where their hands met over Draco’s stomach. “I love you.”
“Dracy?” Harry called, and the blonde looked up, pulling the baby to his chest and out of the water. Harry dried them both and clothed them, wrapping the baby in a clean, dry cloth. They went up to the cabin, and Harry laid Dracy on the bed, taking all the care in the world with the baby. “Do you want to put her in the cot that...?”
Talking about Draco’s memories with his mother, then seeing pictures of her. They sat between the flowers with albums on their laps, talking and laughing of Draco’s baby photos. He was such an adorable little kid, that Harry just wanted to reach out, grab that baby and cuddle him forever.
“Don't get me wrong... I love women. But... I like men too. I think both are extremely attractive. But I never tried with a wizard, just with muggles in bars. I wonder what it would be like,” Harry mumbled, and his body seemed lit, his heart beating a little faster without him really knowing why. Or maybe he knew
Draco smiled around his erection, sucking it in with a little more force before pulling away. Harry was taking a deep breath, his body limp and his cock twitched a little with the pleasure he felt.
Dracy grinned at Harry, approaching and kissing him on the lips. With a sigh, he touched his forehead to Harry's.
“We’re sleeping together. You can rearrange this bedroom to your likings, but I won’t be sleeping away from my husband. Unless you didn’t like our coupling? Because I sure as Merlin loved it.”
. It means that, although we were close to Flitwick, it gave me a bit of a shelter to hide from Potter, and I could hear him perfectly.
“Push! I need to push — Aaah!” Dracy shouted, holding her legs and pushing with all her strength, until the contraction was over.
Yes, it took him four seasons, but now that he felt like he could say it, he was going to say it again.
“I suppose they are in the pictures in your living room.”
“Potter. I just wanted to say… I mean, I paid for what I did, too. Just like Draco. Three months of Azkaban, seven months of community work… What I mean is…” Goyle swallowed hard, looking again from Harry. “I’m sorry. That’s what I’m trying to say.”
“It was good. A bit boring. I hate that I can’t go to the potion shop.”
“Did you film it?”
Ron and Hermione were sitting on the settee in front of the fireplace, cuddling and talking animatedly to Ginny. Harry got near them and sat beside them on the settee.
I hoped his voice was dreadful and he didn’t make it.
“It scratches, Daddy,” Aries pipped up, pouting at his own yellow robes. Scorpius, the well-behaved kid, just shrugged. He was a very good boy, except when his brothers convinced him to do something silly – which had been far too many times.
The whole ordeal was fast for a royal marriage. Their priest, an old man with a long, white beard and twinkling blue eyes, talked about how the union of an Alpha and an Omega was sacred. Of how the Omega would do everything in their power to serve, love and make their Alpha happy, and how the Alpha would do everything in their power to protect, love and surrender to their Omega, giving their Omega everything they had in order to make their Omega happy –
on my mind.
“Birdie!” Talitha pointed again, and of course Harry praised her soon after.
The whole choir were good with the harmony, and I sneaked a peak to where Malfoy was in the front stage, smiling and dancing as if he was on Broadway or something similar. I couldn’t help the damn smile on my face, and I tried hard to still my mouth and be serious again. I had to remember Malfoy wasn’t a friend, he was the enemy. Yes, I vouched for him on the trials. Yes, he had sent me a meter long letter that basically said ‘I’m sorry and thank you’, and YES, he was probably my mate or whatever bullshit Hermione read on her books – even though she was talking about Amortentia and her relationship with Ron -, but he was still Draco Malfoy and we still hated each other. Right?
Harry moaned again, doing what Draco asked. He had never fucked a bloke before, although he had kissed a few. He started with two fingers, because of the spell Draco had used before, and finger fucked him while playing with one of his nipples with his free hand, rolling it between his fingers. Draco moaned loud, rocking against Harry’s fingers.
anyone anymore. Those times are over. You have to realise that you aren’t in danger anymore.”
“Okay, Draco, so the spell is botched and you were trying for something different. But I need you to stop and breathe, okay? We’re going to fix it,” Harry said, holding Draco’s arms and running his hands up and down them.
“Come on, drink this. You need it.”
“We should probably have a look at the bedroom,” Harry said, and they both moved to the bedroom door.
Harry looked up at Draco, was very naked and
Harry laughed aloud, shaking his head and looking at Draco again.
“Yes, Draco… I’ll come inside you… Fill you good with my spunk, leave you so full you’re gonna have my baby… And then everyone will know I’ve fucked you good and deep and got you pregnant as soon as my cock fucked your little tight hole!”
It didn’t take long for Saturn to fall asleep, and Harry left quietly his room, walking to his own bedroom, where Draco had been sleeping for a while now.
“No, not at all. He’s… actually being fine, he helps a lot, and even when he’s being a git he’s actually… I mean, he’s funny. But that’s beside the point.” Now both Ron and Hermione had their eyebrows lifted, looking at me as if waiting for an explanation. I sighed. “He’s not being horrible. And I can see he’s actually really sorry for what happened. He was one of the people who stayed behind cleaning the castle, you know?”
“And how can I make you feel like both?”
“Well, I don’t know how to make pizza. But we can use the muggle phone to call the pizza place, right?”
– in front of Harry Bloody Potter, because the git actually accepted me as his friend and was willing to trust me.
“Harry, I know you. You’re a good boy and you have a golden heart, but you’re not here to
“I love you, my Dracy.”
“Weren’t you waiting for me?” I asked, and he smiled, coming closer.
“You said he was really weird at the trials, didn’t you?” Ron asked, frowning.
“Is papa okay?” was his first question, and Harry nodded, sitting down together with his kids. Hyacinth crawled onto his lap immediately, and seeing his sister doing that, Regulus sat on Harry’s other leg, hugging him tight.
“Hello, Harry. Hello, Malfoy,” Hermione greeted them, and Draco looked up, saying a soft ‘hi’ to both of them before putting some fruit salad in a bowl with yoghurt. Harry decided to make himself a sandwich too. “First day of proper schooling. I can’t wait for it! I could barely sleep!”
sucking his cock.
“I’m Harry,” the man replied, shaking Draco’s hand with his gloved hand. It was a firm handshake, but not enough to hurt him.
“No, Malfoy, it’s okay. You can talk to me, it’s fine!” Harry tried to say, but Malfoy refused to look at him even after they were given their penalties: Community work in a muggle orphanage for a year, for Malfoy. And for Mrs Malfoy, community work in a muggle hospital for a year as well.
-x-x-x-
“Okay. I guess we can try a little bit more.”
“I think it’s best if another person starts today, professor. We have little time and this is the last solo of the play.” Malfoy’s voice perked up, and he looked worried. Max’s solo being right after his, it would be horrible if whoever was substituting him did a bad job.
“What kind of shifter are you, after all? You look like you’re balancing yourself in tiny feet because you can barely hold yourself together,” I asked, although I couldn’t muster to put all the sarcasm in my voice. Potter was sweaty from head to toes with the little practice we had, and he looked utterly miserable. Not even I was comfortable with seeing him like that, especially after the git had saved me.
“Fuck me, Harry. Knock me up.” Draco begged again, and Harry growled, positioning himself behind Draco, his hard cock sliding between Draco’s cheeks, his slick helping it. Draco braced himself, waiting for the sting of the penetration…
Harry took out his wand carefully, wanting not to bother Castor in his arms, and flicked it silently, disappearing with the bucket. He looked at Sirius and gave him
He put me in the middle of the bed, hovering over me, his knees between my parted thighs. He kissed my mouth, but it was tentative, not as aggressive as he was holding me. I kissed him back, trying to know my husband deeply. His tongue played with mine, and his hands explored my body, starting with my creamy white thighs, up to my hips, my waist, and up to my chest. He held my tiny, puffy breasts with both of his hands and pinched my nipples, making me scream.
“So, I have news and you might not like what I'm about to say,” he started, and Ron and Hermione detangled from each other, looking at Harry. Ginny also raised her eyebrows, curious.
Harry didn’t know why he moved. He knew he wasn’t supposed to do it, but the moment, and Draco’s face and the feelings inside his chest… He moved forward, his eyes almost closing. Draco’s mouth opened a little, his eyes closing, inviting Harry in…
“What is a hammock?” Lucy asked, raising a blond eyebrow, and Harry blinked in confusion.
“I never thought we were
I was feeling like I was about to pass out. Flitwick was giving us a motivational speech about how amazing we were in practice and now it was time to show everyone how incredible we were at stage. We were behind curtains in the room that lead to the great hall, and I felt like I was going to vomit. My hands were cold and I could only think about all the ways I would mess up and everybody was going to see me failing.
, we only have two weeks.”
“What kind of Unspeakable do you think I am? Of course I did.”
“Of course, love. All the juicy gossip for you.” Draco smiled with his response, and after sending Saturn to be with his grandma, Harry walked with Draco to their bedroom. He was going to help his mate sleep after the long, tiring day.
Draco chuckled, sitting up straighter with Harry’s help, and showing them their baby.
“I’m an arse type of bloke. But yeah, I do like cock, and also cunt, and tits. I pretty much like everything.”
Ron made a face like he was going to barf when seeing Draco pour honey over his sausages and beans, and Draco showed him the two fingers – while still trying to hide it from 2 years old Rosie.
After he had shaken all of people’s hands, he immediately left the room. He was done with alpha work for the day, and immediately went to check on his little girl. Harry walked to the nursery, but first passing by the living room. Narcissa was sitting in the huge sofa with Aries on her lap, Leo on her left and tiny Scorpius on her right. They were focused on the book she was reading to them, their little eyes following the images on the pages like hypnotized. They were so big already, almost two years old. It would be their birthday in just a month, and Harry knew it would be loud and full of people, just like the day when they presented the leaders’ addition to their pack.
Draco didn’t say anything. He took the pear to his mouth, biting it gently, so different from Harry, and the fruit juice made his lips shiny. Harry had to look away from his lips so he wouldn’t stare.
“Then take me.”
“I thought he was harassing her,” I explained but didn’t quite look into her eyes.
About half an hour later, Flitwick got satisfied with it, and proceeded to the next song.
“You don’t know what a hammock is?” Lucy shook her head, and Harry sighed. He took the hammock, white with red details, and went to their hut. It was high enough off the floor that Harry could stand under it. He took two branches strong enough to withstand the weight of both of them and attached the net with the branches between the parts of the wood under the hut. Without the branches, the hammock wouldn’t be secure, but the spare wood stuck between two beams prevented the hammock from moving.
“I’m glad you found me today.” He came closer to Harry, and soon, their chests were touching. Harry leaned in, his lips touching Draco’s softly. That lightning sensation took over his body again, and he had to hold Harry’s shoulders in order not to fall down, his knees weak.
“Harry... Can I make you a request?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded. It was dark, but he was sure Draco had felt his movement, so close they were. “I know that... It's strange... But... Could you treat me like Lucy?”
“Hmm…” Harry scratched the back of his head, shaking his head negatively. “It’s better not.”
As they looked for a child, they prepared a nursery, painting the walls white, as all the furniture, with coloured blankets and pillows and toys, to create a beautiful contrast. Draco was happy even though he was sad for a whole year of frustration, and they even put a bed in the nursery just in case they got an older kid.
It was gone.
“That’s what I want the most in my life, baby. You know that. I… Fuck, Draco. I’m fucking
In just under half an hour, the small family crossed the fireplace towards Grimmauld Place, now Harry Potter's home. The place had been renovated during the years after the war, but even now, with its creamy and brown tones, white walls and the light that came from the streetlights outside, the house looked dead without its occupant. There was a fine layer of dust on top of the furniture, since, after Kreacher's death, there was no one to do the cleaning while Harry wasn't around.
“You’re already talking to me,” I teased. “What do you need?”
“If it is to do what my body wants me to do, I need to go to the sea, Harry.” Dracy said, and Harry nodded, even though he was scared. He took a torch, and helped Dracy walk towards the beach.
“I guess I never told you I… I’m really grateful for your friendship, Harry,” Draco said, closing his eyes. His mug was empty, so Harry finished his own and put both of their mugs aside. He didn’t really care if this didn’t work. It was so good to have Draco trust him that way.
“Fuck, Harry, take me to the bedroom…”
The alpha father and Christine said ‘yes’, but Dustin raised his hand.
“Fuck, Harry! So big…! So-so good…”  Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, and at the same time, he wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, pulling him all the way inside. Draco moaned loud as Harry grunted, and even more when Harry started to move faster, in and out of his tight heat.
“Soooooo we’re having a third one in the future?” Harry asked when Draco was tucked on his side, eyes closed and ready to sleep.
Draco did, his eyes so full of tears that they’d be falling any moment.  “What are you seeing? Look at me and tell me what you’re seeing.”
Because
As soon as he got in the headmistress office, Harry saw Malfoy, looking at one of the shelves filled with books. All the trinkets that once were Dumbledore’s were substituted by McGonagall’s, and the sight somehow made Harry’s heart lighter.
“Okay, I’m listening.”
Harry stood up, looking around. He went to one of the natural pools and looked inside. There were a few small fish, smaller than the palm of his hand, but they had to work with that at least for tonight. In the morning, Harry would look for something else. He returned to the blond, seriously.
“Yes, I think I have a few ideas. All of the things I tried yesterday were in vain, but I think that the spell is related to me, somehow. Like… Of course, it is related to me, because I cast it, but… I meant emotionally.”
“Potter, it doesn’t matter if this baby is a boy or not: we will
“Hey, Draco, come on. Can you look at me?”
The smaller man soon finished another one, putting on his own head. He moved his head, looking directly at Harry’s eyes.
,” that usually worked, since Cygnus hated being
“He is fine. The baby is just taking a while to come to the world,” Harry said, and Regulus nodded, although he still looked worried. “What are you doing?”
After they were all clean, and the nest was also clean, Draco lay there with their four puppies, Harry barking and growling at anyone who came near them. A part of his brain became way too protective of his babies, and he only ever allowed Saturn to enter the room, in wolf form too, to smell his baby brothers and sister.
“I didn’t make you… But you were made for me.” He whispered, and he didn’t let his baby out of his arms for a second, even after they signed all the papers and their new boy’s birth certificate.
“And… I think you should call me Harry.” He said, hugging me back, and I rolled my eyes.
Harry chuckled, and raised one of his eyebrows.
-x-x-
“It’s incredible. Can you believe we did it all without a wand?” Harry asked, and Draco smiled at him. Draco's hair was reaching almost to his chin, and Harry couldn't resist touching him on the back of the neck, the tips of his fingers entering his hair. He got closer, kissing Draco slowly. Draco hugged him by the shoulders, leaning his entire body against Harry's, standing on his tiptoes so that he could touch him completely.
Very different to him, Draco apparently didn’t care about changing clothes in front of an audience. He left the bathroom with his towel over his shoulders, quite naked except for his black pants. Harry could see him perfectly and thanked Merlin inwardly because he couldn’t see any marks from the Sectumsempra curse. He
“I know you’re not. You’re way cuter than he is.” Harry said, as if he wasn’t thinking. He then turned to Draco, raising the hand that was holding the empty spoon. “I mean, I don’t want to be invasive or anything…”
“Our baby is a
“Sing to me,” Draco said, and I nodded.
, Malfoy. We were pawns in a big people’s game, you and I. And… To be honest, I’m trying really hard to put all of this behind.
“You mean…
“I know. But I’ve called you to eat with me many times. You should just stop what you’re doing at lunchtime and come with me.”
Zabini started his solo, looking at Luna as if he never saw someone so beautiful in his entire life. I’ve seen it many, many times, but it was always breath-taking, especially when they were dressed in beautiful, flowy robes, his golden, hers silvery.
“I like yours too, mate. Are you feeling better?”
Having babies was always a plan they both had, but it took Draco a long year of being with Harry to notice he might be good enough to be a father. And weirdly, while he started giving in to Harry’s fantasy because it was the least he could do to his devoted lover, after a couple of months he was looking forward to those moments. Harry would tease his nipples until they were sore, hold his stomach tenderly as if there was a baby there already and fill him with come to the brim – at least, he would if they weren’t using the contraceptive spell.
They ate in silence, enjoying the comfort of each other’s presence, and after a few minutes and many eaten fruits later, Draco sighed loudly.
We hadn’t talk much since I started the choir, but I felt like our relationship was less strained. I talked to them about the choir and Malfoy being in it, and how we had agreed that we wouldn’t acknowledge each other.
“Hey, Malfoy. You good?”
Despite his resolve to stay awake, Harry woke up hours later, with a start, as he had not realised he had fallen asleep. By the light from the window, it was still very early, but he felt a terrible urge to throw up when he didn't see Dracy by his side.
Talitha patted Dracy's leg with her little hand, trying to get his attention. Dracy was breaking a banana into small pieces, but Talitha wanted to eat right now. She hit it a little harder, and yet, Dracy didn't look at her.
Harry didn't comment, just looked at Draco, who raised his eyebrows as if to say 'just play along with me'. Harry supposed that, with his breasts growing bigger and bigger, and his belly quite obvious from his pregnancy, that Muggle couldn't just accept that Draco was a man who happened to be pregnant. Harry nodded, taking a deep breath.
“I don’t waddle,” Draco would reply, and Harry would hold little James’ hand, point his little finger at Draco and pretend he was the baby talking.
"Harry, I understand that after everything that's happened, you've been feeling... Nervous. Purposeless,” Minerva’s eyes were fixed at me as if she was talking with a small child, “but I thought that your troublemaker days were over.”
“We need to warm you up,” Harry said, his voice hoarse and deep.
“Uh—Yeah, of course. Mum would never forgive me if I let you here alone. Besides, I really want to see you up there like a fancy pants.” Ron grinned, and I couldn’t help but grin back and roll my eyes.
“Later, Harry,” Draco said, although his body said otherwise. Fuck, maybe he’d get another one sooner than later. They’d never used protection, even after Draco got pregnant at their first night together. They were surprised when it took two years after Ursa to Draco to fall pregnant again, and four for their next baby. Maybe destiny was giving them time to enjoy every kid individually before the next came, but they’ve always wanted a big family so it wasn’t that bad. Besides, their house was huge and they could afford it, so the more, the merrier.
“It does. You bought it for me as a joke,” Harry replied, and he saw Draco’s eyes drooping a little. The other man was completely exhausted. Harry pulled him in for a hug, slowly, and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry like he completely needed it.
“Yesh, papa waddle! Papa do!”
Three pair of eyes looked at him, and Ginny
“I'll just wash her, don't worry. Now I need you to cleanse your body and then use healing magic, okay?” Harry instructed, and Dracy nodded, his eyes fixed on the baby.
-x-x-x-
“I don’t care if they listen, Potter, just kiss me,” Draco said, and still smiling, Harry did, pressing Draco’s back against the wall behind him. They were in a little alcove they found behind an armour on an empty corridor. They were coming back to their Eight Year Common Room after a party with their classmates on the Room of Requirement.
“Well, until now,” Draco mumbled, and Harry reached a hand across the island, caressing Draco’s hand with his thumb.
Draco nodded again and hugged Harry a bit more tightly before relaxing again.
I blinked, a bit confused. Yes, I loved our coupling, as he called it, but it wasn’t just… expected. Could we really live like a
Harry was amazed by it, how Draco slowly took it all inside him, down to the balls. The blond stopped, his eyes closed, his breathing evening as he slowly acclimated to Harry's girth.
is a more appropriate name,” they both smiled at that, and Harry waited for the rest of the answer. “Then... I don't care if you call me him or her, but I want you to treat me like a man and woman at random.”
HARRY
Malfoy hugged Luna as well, and she whispered things in his ear. Things Harry didn’t hear, and still was a bit curious about it. Malfoy looked even skinnier, paler, his eyes lacking life. He didn’t look up to Harry, he didn’t manage even to talk to him. Malfoy whispered in Luna’s ear, and Luna looked back to Harry.
lily. He made up the story so he can tell it at her wedding,” Draco said, chuckling.
“I’m glad I went out today,” Harry said, close to Draco.
“Draco, people are waiting for you. You’re the omega-groom. Remember?”
But he did, and pressed two of his fingers into Draco’s hole, preparing him as best as he could with his tipsy mind. When Draco complained about it being ‘too slow’, Harry started to practically fuck him with his fingers, scissoring them and biting onto Draco’s shoulder. He couldn’t wait anymore, though, and neither could Draco.
Which was even better to Harry because Draco, being part veela, was actually
“We should keep practicing, Mr Elk. You can’t pull off a decent Sinatra yet, and you won’t be embarrassing me at the play.” I came back to the Victrola, putting the song from the start. We weren’t going to sing it every time, we had to save our voices for the show, but we still needed to practice. We were both in the choir training room, and Flitwick had given us access on Wednesdays to train. Or better yet, for me to train Potter, because although he could sing the song perfectly, he was terrible on the stage.
“More… More, Harry!” Draco pleaded, and Harry pressed a third finger in, observing Draco’s face, the pleasure he was feeling. Draco’s own cock was leaking precome, a line forming from his cock to Harry’s belly.
“Not really. I’m bi.” Harry shrugged, and it was time for Draco to look at him surprised.
Their days became busier with two babies, but for Harry, it was all worthy when he rocked James to sleep and watched as Draco gave Lily the last feed of the night before putting her to bed. Late in the night, Harry would ask to make love to Draco, seeing his milk leave his swollen breasts. It made them even hornier if it was possible, and Draco insisted they came back to the protective spell. Yes, it wasn’t as good with it, but they already had two babies. They could wait for the third one.
“Kids, hn?” Mark tried to laugh it off, but Draco and Harry looked at each other, not really sure if that was an accident.
“Fuck me like you promised, alpha… Fuck my pink, little omega-hole like a cheap whore until I come like never before,” that made him move, and I almost wished I didn’t say it, because he then held me and fucked me with all his might. His balls were slapping mine, his cock going straight to my prostrate and making me fucking
“Never. Now stop talking and cuddle me. It’s cold.”
“I will protect her with my life, Harry…” Dracy said, watching his daughter's face. “Her name... It's Talitha.”
“I love you, my Tali,” Dracy murmured, kissing Talitha's head. Then he lifted his head, holding Harry by the chin and kissing him on the lips. “I love you, my Harry.”
Dracy did not resist. He took Talitha by the arm and held her close to him, kissing her entire face, the joy inside him almost making him forget about Harry beside him.
Draco supported himself with his hands, looking back and frowning. Why was he laughing? What the hell was funny?
They walked side by side to the Great Hall and walked to the Gryffindor table. Draco immediately lowered his head, walking one step behind Harry. Harry sat in front of Ron and Hermione and Draco sat by his side.
Draco turned, getting dressed, and Harry couldn’t stop looking at his back, how soft his skin looked, and the healthy weight he had put on last year. His arse was round and perfect, and Harry licked his lips, trying not to look at him. Fuck, he couldn’t just get the hots for Draco Malfoy, he was supposed to protect him! He pressed his cock down, trying to calm himself, and rummaged through his backpack to look at the subjects they had to study that they.
had changed, and although he still teased Harry, it wasn’t like he was trying to prove Harry was inferior, but as if they were… Friends. Draco was also very smart, and his notes were neat and colour coded, perhaps even more organised than Hermione’s. Even in Harry’s classes, Malfoy paid attention, genuine rapt attention. Harry thought that, maybe because the shadow of Voldemort wasn’t over their shoulders any more, they could really focus on doing what a student should be doing in the first place.
“Okay, you like the git. Why am I not surprised?” Ron said out loud, and Hermione nodded in agreement.
Draco closed his eyes, murmuring a charm Harry didn’t know, then moaning when something happened, although Harry couldn’t see.
“Sirius struck again. There are traps in the house, just dismantled one. He might have coached his brothers on it too. Be careful.”
His small hand touched Harry’s bigger one, and although his long fingers and groomed nails looked delicate, his grip was firm.
“You were hard in the bathroom,” Draco declared, and Harry sat up, knowing very well that he was
“… Did you just tell me you’re a multimillionaire?” Draco asked, frowning even harder, and Harry rolled his eyes.
Hello! I'm sorry I took long to post, I have a few important projects I have to make and it's been taking all my free time. But here it is!
Harry got down, kissing his neck, nibbling onto his skin, then reaching lower and latching on one nipple, the puffy tissue under his tongue, circling the hard nub into peaks. He held Draco’s other nipple with his hand, holding the nipple, caressing and pulling. He continued down, kissing his stomach and holding Draco’s thighs, kissing the top of his delicate cock, licking from his balls to tip before putting it all in his mouth.
happened.
They kissed for so long it seemed like it was an eternity, but they needed to breathe, and soon they were panting against each other’s mouths.
“Susannah
He sighed, giving up on Cygnus for the moment and sitting Sirius at his side, then he put Scorpius and Aries on Draco’s side. Knowing that Cygnus wasn’t going to be easily bribed, he grabbed a box of every-flavoured beans and moved back to the settee. He grabbed the toddler from where he was playing on the rug and gave him the sweet, sitting the boy in his lap. Cygnus was finally quiet, and Mark moved so he could fix a thing or two on the boys so he could take the picture.
“That’s what I said.
Summer being the least dangerous one, they had time to think about what it would mean. Draco wasn’t a fan of being hot, so he would constantly sigh and whine about how hot his office was. Harry made fun of him, but he also didn’t like the 25 Celsius Degrees of that place. They were cooking every time they tried to be there with their coats on.
“Yes, a little bird!”
It was a five minutes’ walk from his office to Draco’s, and Harry didn’t knock when he opened the door. He immediately regretted it. A cold wind blew his hair, making it even messier than before. Harry got into the office, shivering a bit while his mouth just fell open.
To be honest, I teased him on principle. He was Potter, I was Malfoy, it just was our thing, being enemies. I didn’t actually hate the bloke, although I did somewhere in the past. Before I knew who the Dark Lord really was. Before I saw a damn snake eat someone on my dining table. Before I realised my family was in the wrong.
. Still, I really wanted to give her a name as powerful as her grandma. A name that would remind her that someone incredible is looking after her, but giving her own personality. Also, we didn’t want to upset grandmére Narcissa. So…
Harry decided, maybe they ought to have some fun. He made them use light clothes, made some cold beverages and brought them some games. It didn’t work, really. So then, they decided summer meant seeing friends and being around people, so they asked Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Millie to play twister with them.
The day was sunny, as usual, but it had rained considerably the night before, which made the ground wet. That was good, since Draco was planting some roots in a vegetable garden he had built next to the cabin. They were giving seeds and Draco knew that this was the only way to get new roots to grow. He needed to plant them while there were still roots available so they wouldn't run out of food. Considering their situation, they were quite provided with food. There were many, many fruits around, fish, oysters and crabs at will, and many roots for them to eat. Draco was sad to have no cereals available, but he was happy to have what they had. He just needed to keep growing those items so they wouldn't run out of food.
“Hey,” Goyle said as a greeting, and Draco nodded back.
Harry always found beautiful the way Draco would change his face completely when he meant business. Draco was so good at his job because he absolutely
I’ve always thought I knew Harry Potter more than anyone else. I’ve always been obsessed with him, even before we met at eleven in Madame Malkins. He was always greater and more magical. Maybe the hatred I felt was also part of the feeling that I didn’t know him at all; that everything I created in my head was so different from the reality.
I nodded, pretending I really didn’t care about it, but my heart was beating like it wanted to go samba across the walls of Hogwarts castle. Flitwick announced Harry as bass and asked him to sit together with the basses as we went through the songs we were going to sing on Christmas Day. We had about two months to practice, and most of us already knew the songs, and I sure hoped Potter could learn fast.
“Harry,” he said, putting his head up, his mouth red and wet from what he was doing to me. “Call me Harry.”
I faded to sleep again, and he woke me up in the morning after with some water and grapes. I didn’t love him, not yet, and I knew he didn’t love me either. But fuck if it wasn’t going to be easy to fall in love with my husband.
“If you don’t want me to stare at your cock, wear some bloody trousers, would ya?” Harry complained, and Draco just smiled.
“With McGonagall. I have a job to do now,” Harry said but didn’t elaborate. Dean said the password and the three of them entered the familiar tower.
He was half-sitting, half-lying on the settee with baby Scorpius sleeping on his chest after his afternoon feed. He was the only blond child he had, with his fair skin and light grey eyes. Both Leo and Ursa were dark haired, and they looked so much like Harry it made Draco’s heart melt with how much love he felt for his babies.
“Sore. Tired. We’re never ever having sex again, Potter.”
Harry smiled, touching his nose to Dracy's nose.
“Because I spoil you rotten and I have a 10 inch cock.” This was Harry’s turn to smile smugly, and Draco couldn’t help but kiss his smile.
I was so focused on Malfoy’s worried face, I didn’t understand when he turned his face and stared at me. I stared back at him, frowning, and he nodded his head in Flitwick’s general direction. I frowned harder, and looked at Flitwick. The professor was looking at me too, as was the rest of the choir. I hated being in the spotlight, and I didn’t get it why everyone was looking at me.
Draco licked his lips, touching Harry’s hand that rested on his stomach.
“Did you have basic emergency training?” Harry asked, and Draco rolled his eyes.
King Harry looked a thousand feet tall dressed in his shiny armour with a red cape. My knees got wobbly with how intensely he was looking at me with his shiny green eyes. I could feel them piercing into my very soul. His hair was as black as night, and it wasn’t slick or behaved, but messy, as if he had just stepped down from the back of his stallion. His skin was tanned, and an angry, lightning-like scar adorned his forehead’s right side.
“What? I have eyes.” Draco raised one of his eyebrows, and Harry didn’t really know what to say to that. He heard that before, of course, but none of those people was
“I’ll take the bed on the wall if you don’t mind. I don’t like to wake up with the sun,” Malfoy said, and Harry nodded.
, so they could deem their family finally complete. Being a family of all boys was decidedly chaotic, to say the least.
He kissed her neck, nibbling as he went down to her chest. Quickly, he helped her out of the white tank top, wasting no time before capturing a nipple in his mouth and sucking hard. Lucy moaned softly, not wanting the sailor to hear what they were doing there, probably, but Harry didn't care. Perhaps, if they were in London, he would have been a little more modest, but that island had destroyed whatever remnant of shame he had.
-x-x-
When Harry pressed the fourth finger, Draco howled in pleasure, his nails digging into Harry’s shoulders, his beautiful, long and hard cock leaking hard.
held up a hand, touching Harry's hair. “Remember our first conversation before our first time...?”
“I’m not my dad, though.” Draco was fast to say, and Harry nodded, jumping off the kitchen counter and mixing the stew again, which was boiling a bit. He lowered the temperature, grabbed a spoon and tasted it.
When we were all in our places, and Professor Flitwick magically moved the lights so they showed Luna and Zabini in the stage, each of them in opposite sides, I started to speak.
This chapter might be a bit difficult to read, but there's NO cliffhangers. Everything ends up fine. Look at the ending notes to see any triggers.
-x-x-x-
He put on deodorant and dressed on his black slacks and white shirt. He went back to the bedroom and saw Draco sitting on his bed, sleepy, his hair mussed and his lips pouted.
“And... And... Mango?” Talitha pointed to the fruit, and looked at Harry as if waiting for the compliment.
“Yeeeees, Harry… Yes! Yes! Fuck me deep… Oh, fuck… Give me all of it…!”
“And how is this going to work?” Hermione asked, saying aloud what they were all thinking.
Roberto nodded, looking at the three boxes that fell on the beach.
“I want to fuck you raw,” Harry admitted, and Draco’s hole gushed out slick.
thing I could have without the Golden Trio putting their noses into it, but apparently not anymore. When Harry Potter crossed the door of the Choir Room and walked to Flitwick, I didn’t really give a rat’s arse about it. He was the Quidditch star, it didn’t matter why he was here, right?
We walked hand in hand to the Great Halls so we could have our Christmas supper. The fairy lights were shimmering, the trees tall and beautifully decorated on the sides of the halls, and the food was smelling delicious. Before I could actually take the courage to release his hand so I could go to the Slytherin table, Harry stopped, turning to me.
“Well, yeah. We just didn’t know at the time.”
“Besides,” Harry said before I could say anything. “It
“Let’s have another one just to be sure,” Harry suggested, and Draco spelled Cygnus’ robes clean, although the boy didn’t want anything to do with the pictures anymore.
Looking around was making me highly embarrassed, but Pansy was excessively excited to change to their type of clothing. I hope I didn’t need to. My body was a treasure to my husband and myself only. That’s what I grew up believing.
Dracy turned away from Harry, looking him in the eye with furrowed brows. Finally, he shook his head, crossing his arms and, without realising it, resting them on his prominent belly.
Harry found it endearing, which was strange.
His saviour went back to his truck, moving forward and stopping in front of Draco’s car. He locked Draco’s car with a chain and then he pulled it forward. It took a few seconds, but it finally gave in, moving with the truck. Draco heard the crunch of the snow beneath his wheels. The man towed him around, and Draco helped a little but decided to let the man do his job.
he said he knew where one of the states were,” I concluded, and both my friends looked surprised at me. “So… I was thinking, since we’re going to have some free time after the holidays before we come back to school… If we could go look for it. And, since Malfoy knows where the place is…”
“Why?” He asked, and Hermione looked at Harry, expecting him to answer.
They decided to travel the next morning, So they were rested and fed before the process that could be their death or salvation.
And before he could swim out of the water, he felt a tug that made his whole body spin and all the air out of his lungs. He swallowed water, his lungs burning.
I wasn’t nervous. Okay, I was a bit nervous about the consummation of the marriage part. I, just like the rest of my people, was on the short side. But then I was short
Harry held him by the waist, moving his hips slowly, coming and going on the smaller body, his hands marking Draco's pale skin. One of his hands went up Draco's body, holding one of the small pink-nibbed breasts and squeezing, his thumb massaging the nipple in circles, making Draco moan loudly, with no control.
They were finally all seated in their usual seats, and about 12 new students were going to be sorted this year. All the tables were a bit empty and a little bit grim. The Slytherin table was the one which was the emptiest between all four, and Harry felt the irrational urge to go and sit there, just so it looked less empty. He searched for known faces and found Millicent Bulstrode, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson and Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of Malfoy, and maybe it was for the best, at least for now. Harry had spoken in his favour at the trials, telling them how Draco and Narcissa Malfoy had saved his life while he, Hermione and Ron were looking for the Horcrux. Luna also vouched for Draco, her speech soft but emotional.
Draco’s pregnancy was one of the easiest ones in the world, according to Hermione, who always said it with a bit of longing as she waddled around their house. In the last months, he’d feel a pressure on his back and pain too, but he always looked elegant even when he was waddling.
“By Merlin's balls!” He heard someone shout, and Harry immediately knew it was Malfoy.
Their pleas became even more desperate, and a man appeared at the bow, probably the captain of the boat. He waved at both of them, and Draco shouted a stronger 'No!'. Nothing was effective, however, because just a few seconds later, the boat seemed to hit an invisible barrier, and strong waves, coming from nowhere, hit the hull with such force that it turned it violently.
He sucked hard from the first second, and he heard as Draco’s muffled moans filled the small alcove. He hummed against his hole, pressing the tip of his tongue into Draco, grunting as he noticed he was already relaxed and a little stretched. Draco possibly prepared before the party. He circled the puckered skin with his tongue, pressing against it over and over, feeling as almost half of the wet muscle breached the slick entrance.
The movements progressed faster and faster, the sounds of the bodies clashing loudly, mixing with the groans of both. Harry took his other hand from Draco's waist, holding his small cock with his forefinger and thumb, masturbating it to the rhythm of penetration. With so many stimuli in his body, Draco let out a loud groan, his entire body shaking with the strength of his orgasm. The pressure around Harry made him reach his orgasm too, filling Draco with his seed until he felt completely emptied and satisfied.
He didn’t want to be part of that anymore.
“I trust you.” Draco said, holding Harry’s head and kissing him deeper, trying to show all the love he had for that man.
“No, it wasn’t, but thank you for not screaming at me for not hating Malfoy,” I said, and Hermione shook her head.
It was two days before the play. Everybody was nervous, Flitwick was being terrible and we were all training our arses off. Pansy had a breakdown because of stress in the middle of the rehearsal over her dress that had a hole in it, and it took us at least half an hour to remember her she was a damn
“Shhh, Ron! It’s not like that.” Harry looked around and Ginny started to laugh. Harry couldn’t help but smile too. Deciding that they were best as friends instead of lovers had been the best choice of Harry’s life. “He can’t sleep in the Gryffindor tower and I can’t go to the dungeons. It just makes sense.”
“Oh, Merlin, she’s beautiful!” Hermione said, coming closer and taking another picture of Draco looking up at her with the baby. “But… Don’t get me wrong, Susannah is a beautiful name. But I thought you were going to name her after a flower?”
“Let's go home, Dracy... She's hungry. She needs you to feed her.”
I wanted to bring the subject for weeks, but every time I tried, something made me stop. I didn’t know why, because I was used to say everything to Ron and Hermione. Maybe I was scared to be judged, to feel casted aside. I could only have theories, but the truth was, I really wanted to open up about it somehow.
“And how do you need me, Professor?”
They stayed there for a while, until Draco fell asleep. Harry got up, leaving him alone for a moment, and went back to the fire to finish their lunch.
“Would you... would you like to kiss a wizard?”
in that weather, especially when the strong winds began to soar and they felt cool despite the hot weather during the day.
me, for one, and I really don’t want to fight anyone.” I sighed, looking around, seeing that we were both alone after everybody left. “I know it looks like I enjoy making people mad, but I just enjoy making
“I love you, Harry Potter.”
“I didn't... I didn't think that…”
“It’s two in the morning, Potter… Who the fuck is going to hear us?”
laughed because of something Harry had said, his feelings switched to something different.
“I really don’t know. I was building up my fire and I had this feeling… Like someone needed my help. I fixed my truck, went outside and found you. Thinking about it now, it does sound a bit crazy.”
Harry fell over him, breathing hard, and then kissing Draco in the cheek.
“Harry, Draco, it’s been impossible to take this picture today!” Mark complained, his own armpits sweaty with all the action. “Look, baby Castor is chewing on a toy, and Cygnus can’t even look at the cam--”
“Yes, I do,” Harry smiled, and Draco mirrored his smile, his eyes getting less watery. “And what about the smells? What can you smell?”
The assembly took even longer. It was a matter of trial and error, and for the most part, the attempts went wrong and they needed to start over. The work was tiring and the days were hot, but Draco always refused to take off his own shirt. He said he wasn’t an exhibitionist like Potter, and that he could work
In the end, when the day came, Dracy seemed much more prepared than Harry. The pains started at night, over dinner. They ate and drank, but Dracy didn't want to go up to the cabin, preferring to stay in the hammock. Harry didn't leave him alone, staying with him and trying to help ease the pain.
“Daddies, meet your chubby baby girl,” she said, and Harry couldn’t believe what she said.
thing.
When Talitha took her first steps, she held Harry's fingers while Dracy called out a little further. The girl was strong, her curly black hair waving in the wind, her green eyes intense and a smile on her lips. Dracy and Harry felt their whole body vibrate when they saw her walking for the first time, and Dracy couldn't control the tears that were streaming down his face.
It was hard, to have all four of them at the same time. Draco was overwhelmed, trying to take care of all of them at the same time, but managed to be calmed down by Harry and the midwife, who stayed to help them with the early hours after the birth.
“Should I convince you to stay with me?” Harry asked, putting a strand of my hair behind my ear and pulling me up so he could give me a kiss. I moaned softly, and he ended up convincing me well as I rode his cock while he grabbed my tits from behind, torturing my nipples as if milking me. I came as hard as the first time, even when my body was already tired.
. I thought that maybe it made us friends?”
The room was full of people, who threw rose petals at me as soon as I stepped on the red carpet who would lead me to my new husband.
Draco nodded, and Harry crooked his head a bit to look at his face. Draco had his eyes closed, his mouth in a pout as he was breathing softly.
“What bet?” I asked before I could stop myself, and when Ron’s cheeks turned pink, I raised my hands. “Don’t, don’t say it. I don’t wanna know.”
, we’re going to finish our homework.
“I haven’t. I wanted to know if it was okay with you before I tried to ask him.” I confessed, and Hermione smiled at me as if I was her 2 year old child.
“Can we see the baby? Can we, dad? Can we, can we?” Regulus was jumping up and down, excitement in his voice.
"Hence, I'll do the learning and you'll go by." Draco teased back, and Harry couldn't help but laugh.
“I can film me fucking you if you want.” Harry offered, and Draco moaned, his slightly less horny body started to get into full horny mode again.
At night, after they put James to sleep, Harry observed Draco. Something Ron said at dinner made him thinking, and he decided to think a little on the subject. Draco was putting on his pyjamas after his night shower and pampering, and Harry liked how soft he looked. He still maintained the weight he got when he had the hormone treatments, his small breasts were still perky and beautiful but looked a tad bit bigger. His stomach was softer and rounder, and Harry frowned. He didn’t have that small roundness before, did he? It was small and Harry hadn’t noticed this before, but every change on Draco’s body was clear for his eyes.
It was when the photographer started to place his equipment in the living room that Harry noticed the first trap. Right on top of the chandelier was a bucket. The bucket was being held precariously by a thread, almost invisible, that went up the chandelier, along the roof and was held on the side light right beside where Sirius was seated. He only needed to release it from the light and the bucket would fall right on top of the poor photographer.
Harry proceeded to grab two spoons. He shoved one in his own bowl, and offered the other one to Draco. Draco went to grab the spoon, and his fingers brushed against Harry’s…
“I-I’m not sure I can do it, Sir.” I was honest. Yes, I knew the lyrics of the song, but I was used to sing the ending of the chorus when the bass line was needed. Besides, it meant going up there and singing in the spot line together with Malfoy.
We signed all the papers and he took my hand, kissing my knuckles before announcing that the ball would start. Nobles from both our kingdoms were there to see us, dance, eat and drink in our name. My father and King Harry shook hands since the agreement was fulfilled, and my mother gave me a strong hug, whispering in my ear:
Noticing Harry was trying to hold back, Draco turned on his stomach, resting on his shoulders and holding each side of his arse with his hands, opening himself to Harry, offering his hole.
“I'm just
What the f—
“Talitha?”
“Well, it happened before. Remember that time when I made a stool follow me around while barking? I was kind of thinking I’d love to have a dog because my flat is just… Way too silent. It stopped following me when I got Bubbles.” Draco said. Bubbles was his dog, a white and black Shihtzu. The small dog was bat-shit crazy, but Draco adored the thing. Harry had to admit he adored Bubbles, too. “And when you got into my office yesterday…”
Potter looked at me as if he’d never had thought of that. His eyes were open wide like saucers, and I could almost hear his heart beating like crazy.
I thought for a second, but my answer was easy, at least now.
“That’s an improvement.”
Draco held the elastic of Harry’s bottoms, pulling it all off, leaving Harry naked. His hard cock reached his navel, the veins protruding, precome oozing a bit from the tip.
Draco was reading James a story when the fireplace finally flamed with Harry’s arrival. James let out a high squeak, jumping out of the settee and on Harry’s arms. Harry caught him swiftly, smiling widely and holding him to his chest before kissing his son’s cheeks.
“I... I came to a conclusion,” She said, and Harry nodded for her to continue. “Being Lucy is also not... Exactly what I feel.”
With the holes ready, Harry went to the water, taking a good amount of clay and throwing it into one of the holes before taking one of the logs he had cut - the correct size of the hole - and stuffing it in there, pressing with the down as much force as possible so that the clay embraced the trunk inside the hole. After that, he filled the remaining sides around the trunk with sand and clay, pressing it to make it as firm as possible. He repeated the same process with the other holes, standing in the middle of them with his hands on his hips, watching his work.
Later that night, Harry helped him with towels, soap and toothpaste, and they stopped at Draco’s bedroom door.
“Don’t pressure him, ‘Mione,” Harry said, and overall, Christmas’ dinner with the Gryffindors wasn’t so bad. They laughed at my jokes and I even laughed at Weasley’s jokes too, surprisingly enough.
. Yes, I was scared and didn’t want to make it official just now, but I still wanted to be near him, know each other a bit more, get used to him in a different way than I was.
Draco’s labour took a bit longer than the other ones, and Harry didn’t leave his side, feeding him ice chips and whispering sweet nothings on his ear, although Draco was squeezing his hand so hard he thought his fingers would break.
“Daddy is working, my dear. He’ll be back soon.” Draco said, and got up, holding James on his hip. It was a bit awkward with his 6 months’ pregnancy bump, but he was used to it by now. “What about we prepare daddy some delicious food for when he comes back?”
“Draco,” Harry repeated, releasing Draco’s hand.
“No, Draco. No. Please, no. Once a year is enough.”
“Shut up your mouth, Potter, or I’ll have to call the second-grade punishment on you,” Draco said, and Harry shut his mouth tight. He didn’t want to spend a whole month without blowjobs. At least it wasn’t as bad as first-grade punishment – meaning, no sex at all.
They didn't expect the doors to close and the lights to go out. Wands in hand, they tried to go the other way, find the other door, but apparently that had been orchestrated.
“Me neither. I wasn't really thinking about that possibility, but... But it is possible that it’s a real one.” Draco sighed, turning on his back and watching Harry. Draco raised one of his hands, digging his fingers into the beard that covered Harry’s face. “If I'm pregnant... We are... Condemning an innocent life to our destiny.”
My face was on fire. I couldn’t speak. There was a lump in my throat, and he looked like he asked me if the ball was to my liking, smiling and waving to his people. I didn’t know what to say, but my body had other ideas. My cock was shamefully hard, and my hole was slicking so much I was sure my white clothes were absolutely ruined. Thankfully I was wearing way too many layers and I hope it didn’t show through.
I was nervous, so I looked around to calm myself down. The bed was big, with golden trim and red cushions. The room in itself was very practical, with a closet and a decorative sword collection on the wall. I assumed we would have separate bedrooms, so I wasn’t too concerned about the decoration, although I’d change one thing or another – maybe everything – if the bedroom was mine.
“He is alive,” Harry stated, running towards the man's contours, while listening to Draco's screams behind him. He didn't understand what he was saying, nor did he have time to try to understand. He threw himself into the water, swimming towards the man, trying to recover from the thud, and pulled him out of the water, swimming as fast as possible to the beach.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry promised, kissing their baby girl’s hair while hugging his husband, their boys around them smiling and planning all the ways they could torture poor Mark again. “We’re taking a new photograph.”
They could barely sleep so much that they were anxious. They lay in the shelter, side by side, staring at the leafy ceiling.
Harry breathed in, calming himself down and looking at Draco, who had the sweetest, more manipulative smile in the world. Harry sighed, shaking his head and kissing his husband on his lips, making his boys make gagging sounds at them.
“Your cock is beautiful,” Harry said, kissing the base where his cock met his balls, and Draco opened his legs even more.
“Yeah, you did,” Ginny answered, and Harry smiled at them as he held Draco’s hand and they all started walking to the Eight Year Common Room. Perhaps they’d have to tell their friends – officially, at least – about their relationship. But for now, they were just enjoying the moment.
“They're alive,” Ron stated, his hands fisted over the round wooden table.
“You would kill her... Since when are you planning to kill the baby?! Is that why you didn't want to talk about pregnancy?” Harry asked desperately, and Dracy continued to shake his head.
Draco stared at him for a couple of seconds, before nodding his head.
“Oh, dear, they’re almost coming!” She said, softly holding Draco’s tail. He whimpered once again, and Harry tried to calm him down by resting their faces together.
willy,” Harry chuckled and Draco snorted, deciding it was time to get up and put Scorpius in his crib for the next half-hour of his nap. As he walked to the nursery, his mind came back to that moment, nine years ago.
“Fuck… Draco… Dra-… Fuck! If you keep doing that, I’m going to come,” Harry warned, and Draco smiled, stopping. He cleaned his wet mouth and chin with the back of his hand, biting his lip and raising his hand, summoning his wand.
“Yes, and what else? What can you see in me?” Harry coached.
“Your Majesty,” Draco said, but Harry knew it was a joke.
He heard of these things happening, to other people obviously. He wrote about it in his books, too. People suddenly finding their soulmates and their world twisting upside down, but he never thought… He had never dreamt or imagined that it might happen to him.
And it all spilled out at once. A sob cut through my throat, and my eyes got blurry with unshed tears, that soon were spilling down my cheeks. I started trembling hard, my own feelings out of control, and I hid my face, trying to hide away from him. I was crying – no,
my husband in me, I wasn’t nervous about the marriage at all. It was all political, and I knew I’d be treated like a true preciosity. If anything, Gryffindors were known for their honourable hearts, and the King saved so many people, even at only 25 years old. I wasn’t worried about that at all.
It didn't take long for Dracy to come, his body arching beautifully while the orgasm made the milk in his breasts leak even more. Harry felt his cock throb, and watched with delight at the image of Dracy in his most sublime state.
At that moment, he could’ve used Draco’s help, but his omega was momentarily away from his counseling duties since Ursa had the flu and was very clingy. Saturn was being a good big brother, playing with his smaller siblings and entertaining them while their nanny for the day, good old grandma Cissa was looking out for them. Harry zooned out a bit, thinking of how emotional Draco was when he met their parents for the first time after fully accepting his omega status. He never stopped visiting them before, but now, free of all the boundaries he had put on himself before going to live with humans, their relationship was different… It was more like a family than a contract, that was how Harry viewed them before.
“Summer…. There are little animals, but they’re not eating anything yet.” Draco said, and Harry didn’t stop himself from caressing his back. Draco almost melted in his arms.
Harry didn't need to hear it twice. He lowered his lips to kiss her, his hand tightening on her swollen breast. She spread her legs, opening the trousers she was wearing and pushing it down with some difficulty - she had lost weight during her time on the island, but the pregnancy was making her gain the weight back, making the trousers tight. Harry felt his entire body throb, as he would have the person he loved again after so long.
Draco's hand flew to his belly, and for the first time, Draco seemed to realise he was already showing. He nodded, and Roberto and Harry started carrying the boxes towards the cabin. It wasn't as heavy as Harry imagined, but due to the fact that Draco couldn't help, they made more than one trip. Draco was in charge of taking the sea grapes to clean and remove the parts of the seaweed that didn't taste so good.
, the
But maybe Harry shouldn't have taken his eyes off the water. Maybe he shouldn't have admired the palm trees and woods glistening in the distance, along with the blue water in the sun. Because when he thought the greatest adventure of his life would begin, he felt a wave hit the raft so hard that it rose from the side where Malfoy was, causing it to fall into the water milliseconds before Harry fell as well.
Once Harry got inside, Draco greeted him with a tired smile, a bundle on his arms.
HARRY
His whole body combusted, like lightning went inside him through his fingers and all over his body. All the hairs in his body stood on end, and his heart missed a beat. He looked up to Harry and the man was looking down at him as if they’d seen each other for the first time.
“Yes, it's a monkey, Tali!” Harry praised her, kissing her cheeks when Talitha said anything remotely recognisable.
He was also there when Draco started to select people for his team. Strangely, his old colleagues at Slytherin came to him first. Gregory Goyle was the first one to approach, looking at Draco in the eye.
“Oh, come on, Harry. You’ve seen me naked for months now. You must know I don’t care.” Draco looked at Harry from the shower while he shampooed his hair, not even caring that Harry was there.
“Charlie and Lola it is,” Harry picked the book and sat at Saturn’s side. Before he could start reading, though, Saturn held his hand, looking up to him.
“For a matter of fact, I made her come first,” Pansy said, raising her chin, what got her a kiss.
Harry laughed a little, and it was his time to kneel. Like it was his second nature, Draco opened his trousers and put them down, letting them pool around his ankles. He tilted his arse up and spread his legs as much as he could because of his trousers, and Harry wasted no time before grabbing both of his arse cheeks, opening them obscenely and putting his mouth around Draco’s hole.
“What are the wandless spells you can do?” Harry ignored the acid tone of Malfoy's voice for general well-being. They were stuck on an island for Merlin knows how long. They needed at least not to kill themselves.
Neither Harry nor Draco wanted to see the wreck of the boat, and Harry rested his chin on Draco's head when he hugged him. Harry opened his eyes a few seconds later, seeing boxes and debris floating, being carried by the waves. IAnd the man.
“Two or three?” Harry asked, finding his wand in his back pocket and conjuring some lube on his hand. He slicked his fingers and pressed them between Draco’s arse cheeks, and his boyfriend sighed softly, pressing his forearm against the wall and his mouth over his forearm.
“You’re moving in with me?” Harry asked, surprise in his voice. “Aren’t you scared? We met just a couple of hours ago.”
“You were sleeping so good, I didn’t want to move and wake you up,” he said, and I looked up at him. His eyes were again green, and his smile was white and pure. I couldn’t help but trust him completely.
“Do you have anything?” Harry asked, fixing his clothes and looking at Draco as if expecting something.
“Why is it so?” Draco asked, washing the shampoo away from his hair, his eyes closed.
Draco sighed, his eyes full of unshed tears.
“I did, Professor. But I mean… Why do you want to talk to me?” Harry insisted, and she sighed.
With one hand, Draco grabbed Harry’s hard cock, licking the underside provocatively before wrapping his mouth around the glans. Draco closed his eyes, starting to move his head up and down, letting his saliva run the length of it, Harry's taste making him even more excited.
I bit my lip, nodding.
“Do you have any… any mark? Tattoos? Anything?” Draco asked, frantic, and Harry’s hand went straight to his forehead.
“Horny,” Harry replied, throwing his shirt somewhere in the room, now taking off his shoes, socks, belt and jeans. “You’re not taking your clothes off.”
“I already talked to Mr Potter about the situation, Mr Malfoy, and he’s agreed to help us,” she said, and Malfoy looked a bit shocked but didn’t say anything. “And since you all know that you can’t possibly stay in your dorms, Mr Malfoy, and it would be very dangerous to stay in any other dorms at our school, we’ve decided to offer you both a dorm of your own. It has a bedroom, a bathroom and a common room. It used to be a teacher’s dorm, so it’s near the Professor's rooms, but it has been refurbished to welcome you both. Your belongings will soon be transferred to your new dorm.”
At eight months, Talitha learned how to sit by herself, and that made their lives a little easier, as they could leave Talitha sitting under the hut on top of blankets with her doll, which Dracy had made with cotton. She had brown cotton eyes - a variety that Dracy had found lost among his new cotton plantation - and also a dress made from the same fabric, but it had no complex shape and was a little crooked. Talitha didn't care much, and she always bit her doll's legs while watching her parents cook or sew, Dracy often sitting next to her, or helping Harry to pick things up in the distance.
“And your lady's name?” Roberto turned to Draco. Harry was about to say that Draco wasn’t a girl when he squeezed Harry’s arm tightly.
make a mistake. My job is to protect her, but also be there for her. That is why I think the best outcome for it would be that the relationship is permitted, but… With one condition.”
was the one
“I am a Gryffindor, so… Yeah, I mean at the Gryffindor table.” He teased, and I opened my mouth once or twice before asking again.
Eventually, Talitha went back to sleep, and naturally released Dracy’s nipple, her small mouth open in an ‘o’ shape. Dracy got up, taking the little girl to the next room, before going back to the couple's room. Harry was still sitting against the wooden wall, and Dracy sat straddling his lap, holding him by the shoulders.
King Harry was so nervous he felt like he was about to pass out. He was pacing in front of their bedroom door, worrying his bottom lip as he heard Draco’s screams and grunts from the other side.
“Malfoy’s going to walk with us, he’ll eat with us and do stuff with us. He’ll have to adapt to Gryffindor schedule, I suppose, or I’ll have to adapt to his schedule. Or both. I’m not sure. Aaaand… I’ll have to go to another dorm with him.”
I focused back on Potter when he replied.
when someone was suddenly too quiet and the curtains were drawn.
“Stop saying that. Getting pregnant is not easy. And you’re not broken, we did all the tests and both of us are fine. And even if you couldn’t get pregnant, it wouldn’t make you broken. We’d just have to find another way to have a baby.”
, I wanted to get pregnant so badly. When I was around 13, I would stuff my gowns with pillows and observe myself in the mirror, dreaming about my babies and how would I name them and take care of them. I still had my baby dolls safely kept in my trunks, and of course I’d use it to decorate my new rooms.
It was late when Harry remembered that they had to eat. Outside was still cold, the snow even higher, and they had warm tea and cheese toasties with a side of reheated tomato soup.
“Didn’t know you were into blokes,” Harry mumbled, and Draco snorted.
After putting Draco to bed and making some sandwiches for him to eat under a preservation spell – Draco’s pantry was sadly empty, and Harry hated how little his friend ate these days -, Harry came back to the Ministry and emptied Draco’s office, transferring his things to his own office. Draco would be mad because things weren’t alphabetically organised and colour coded, but at least they wouldn’t be destroyed by the weather.
In the second week of October, McGonagall announced that Quidditch was coming back. New teams would be formed and the head of their houses would choose their leaders. Harry shouldn’t have been surprised when the new head of Gryffindor, Professor Vector, the Arithmancy teacher, chose him as the Quidditch team leader. Harry had sort of hoped they would choose someone else, but it didn't matter. He had a strong plan. Call his old team back, and do testing for the positions that needed players. Luckily, everyone was there and eager to play again. Ron, Ginny, Jimmy Peakes, Ritchie Coot, Dean Thomas and Demelza Robins.
They stood there, awkwardly looking at any other direction except each other, their silence heavy in the confined quarters of their room. Harry bit his bottom lip, then decided to break it.
“I need you to be a good big brother and watch over your little brothers, Sirius. Can you do that for me?” Harry asked, hugging his older son. Sirius nodded, his light grey eyes serious.
“Aren’t you? I mean, we’ve trained two whole months together every week. You’ve helped me –
That felt normal and safe, and that’s all I needed right now.
“Well, I was busy admiring you,” Draco said, looking at Harry’s toned chest. His husband was delicious, with his tanned skin from Quidditch, freckles on his shoulders, sparse hairs on his chest, that would go down to his stomach, thickening under his navel and disappearing into his pants, that Draco knew was hiding his favourite toy.
“I don’t think I’m ready for it yet.” I was honest. My mind was a turmoil, I was confused and feeling guilty. This was
“Yeah… So good…” Draco mumbled, but he opened his legs, needing Harry inside him. “Please, Harry… I want you…”
states. Every pure-blood family has properties, and your family was once part of the Sacred 28, back when it had more than 28 families. I bet there’s a lot of family heirlooms and old family trees you can dig.”
Harry was extremely aware of his own body. It was getting better now he had grown into his height and gained some muscle, but he still felt very self-conscious about… well, his
“Y-Yes, Professor.”
until nightfall. As they retired to sleep, Malfoy would wait a few minutes for Harry to appear to be sleeping and go out to take his own bath. Harry wanted to follow him once more, to see what he couldn't see the other day, because Malfoy always watched him when they were in the clearing, but something inside him didn’t let him muster the courage to do so. As much as he wanted to, there must be a reason why Malfoy didn't want Harry to see him. Harry was thinking about sixth year. Maybe Malfoy had Sectumsempra scars, and Harry didn't want to see them. At least not at that moment.
Flitwick probably knew this too, so he nodded.
“Draco, my love,” Harry started as he left the bed to tend for their baby girl. “I’d do it every single night, for the rest of my life. I love you, and I love our babies.”
“If… If that’s okay? I understand they might not want me there. And…” I swallowed hard. I thought maybe I could do it in a better opportunity but now was a good time as it would ever be. “I want to say… I’m really sorry Weasley and Granger… For… What happened early this year. I know my words would never pay for what I did, but I want you to know that… That I’m really sorry about everything.”
“And where is it, papa!?”
“I don't want to kill her... No, I don't want her to die... She's my baby…”
” Ron looked like he couldn’t believe it, and I hid my face in my hands, ashamed of being out of control because of a damn joke and just spilling my secrets.
I and the rest of the choir were sitting in the chairs designed for us, separated by voice range. I sat behind the
“So, is your answer yes, Mr Potter?” Professor Flitwick asked, and I felt even dumber.
“Would you accept some hot cocoa, then?” Harry asked, smiling, and Draco smiled back, nodding.
“Harry, meet your second son, Scorpius,” Draco said softly, caressing the baby’s cheek with his knuckle.
“We got it right every day until today!” Harry said, glad they were so good at keeping their dates up to date. It was something they did so they wouldn't miss important dates like birthdays. They didn't want to lose that connection with the outside world. “We have a calendar rock. It is actually the side of a cave. The passage is too small for us to enter, but we use the side to note the days of the year. We forgot to write down the days of the week, so we don't have a lot of notion about that, but it's not as important as the actual days.”
“That’s what you say. You’ve never presented any proof that we are not wasting time and money looking for them.”
It still scared me a bit, though, to think that my future husband, alpha and breeder was almost 7 feet tall. I didn’t know if he was exactly that size, but it seemed like to me. He was
After a few minutes of throwing leaves and coconuts at the coconut tree's foot, Harry had picked up a rhythm.
“She just needs a lot of water, good food, milk and sleep. She’s going to be okay very soon,” Draco said, and slowly took Ursa away from his nipple, rearranging his clothes and he continued to rock her slightly before putting her on her crib. He sighed, and Harry hugged him from behind. Saturn rested his arms on her crib to still look at her.
“Her hunger is more urgent.” Dracy smiled again, kissing him on the cheek before looking back at Talitha.
He looked outside, the weather getting worse, the snow clashing against the windows. Inside their home was warm and comfy, the Christmas tree perched in the corner near the wall. Harry’s idea, of course. He and the kids had decorated the tree December first, while Draco supervised with Scorpie on his hip. It was way too soon to have a Christmas tree, but that hadn't ever stopped them before. Here it was in all its glory.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked, and his stomach grumbled loudly. Harry looked at him, to his small face and pointy features.
“Yes, we've been here for over two months. It has been a considerable time.” Harry commented, making the fire and placing the pot with water on top. He had cut half of his trouser’s legs, making them look like shorts now. He had his legs crossed on the floor, separating the oysters so he could put them in the water after it was boiling.
Harry raised his hand, touching the baby’s soft blond fuzz of hair, his eyes stinging with the tears that wanted to fall.
“Vomit flavoured,” Draco said, looking at Harry and then at Mark. “Do you think we got a picture?”
“Well, I asked McGonnagal how our school schedule would be. I have the one with both of our classes in it.” Draco fished the parchment from his backpack and grabbed his new wand, spelling a duplicate of it and murmuring the spell between his lips. “Here.” He gave Harry a copy and continued with his morning routine.
“Glad you found me, too, or I’d be a Draco ice lolly.”
Those words stuck into my brain. I’ve heard it before, of course. The marriage vows weren’t very different from kingdom to kingdom, and a lot of omegas hate the words they had to say. Still, when the phrase went past my lips, it sounded… Different.
“Your Majesty? The baby is here.”
“Fuck, you’re taking me whole, Draco… Yes, take it… Take everything…” Harry moaned, leaving his body almost all the way out and thrusting it all the way in, his skin slapping against Draco.
“What do you think?”
“But, anyways, I was in the process of making beef stew. Want to talk in the kitchen?” Harry asked, and Draco just nodded.
Harry and Draco loved pictures. That was why every year they had a beginning-of-the-year picture. This one was happening in February, and once again, Harry had forgotten how really chaotic these days were. Not because they weren’t used to it. They had been married for nine years, and had taken a family picture every year since their marriage. No, it wasn’t that. It’s just that Harry had forgotten the challenge of holding down a toddler.
“June 27th.” The sailor said, and Harry and Draco smiled, high fiving each other.
Harry came back to the bathroom and headed for the shower, putting his shampoo and soap on the designated spaces. They were a few rock shelves on the wall, separated a bit from Draco’s honey shampoo and soap. He took off his clothes and checked if he had closed the door. He had.
“You mean… At the Gryffindor table?” I asked dumbly.
Draco was already very delicate when it came to his body. He had a small and soft cock, just like his balls, and his nipples were puffy, but not big enough to be called breasts (although Harry loved to call them titties when they played in the bedroom). He also had a low sperm production – tested before because, when he first had sex with Harry, he was surprised at the amount of come the other one could produce, and he wondered why he only could produce a little. The best quality though was that he didn’t need artificial lubricant. He could produce his own. According to the healer, he could expect an increase in it.
“Hn… Draco, you took me out of a panic attack in the middle of a stage while we sang to the entire school. We are standing hand in hand in the middle of the Great Hall. To be fair, I think this boat has sailed.”
“Wait, you said Harry Potter… Like in
“We might have, but I’m not sure if he screamed before or after. And anyway, when I spell the photograph it will probably show his scream.”
“Do you feel better?” Harry asked, and Dracy nodded.
“Do you want me to touch you...?” Harry asked, slowly raising his hand over the small volume of her belly, towards one of the breasts and caressing it lightly. She moaned again, lowly, and nodded.
“Yeah… And… Actually, I have something to tell you. I mean, to ask you. Well, I’m not sure,” I babbled, because it felt such a big thing for me. Maybe they wouldn’t understand and I felt a bit stupid. They waited patiently, and I licked my lips to continue. “So, you know I’ve been training with Malfoy for the play, yes?”
“I know it would be strange for the Muggle to know that you are a man, and I will definitely use the name you chose…”
be having another!”
“Daddy?” He heard Saturn’s voice from the door, and turned to his big boy. Saturn still wore the necklace his mother had given to him, and looked up at Harry with his big, blue eyes. “Are the babies okay?”
“What happened after I got into your office?”
“Did they tire you?”
- had told him they were poisonous, and since then they've stayed away from them.
I was shocked, and my surprise must’ve showed in my face, because he immediately started talking again.
“We would never hate you for trying to live your life, Harry.”
They collected fruit for three, but after they had eaten, the man still hadn't shown up.
“Charlie and Lola?”
,” Harry whispered against Draco’s ear, biting his earlobe gently. He lowered his mouth, kissing his neck, biting it and licking the spot, making Draco shiver and moan. “Shhh… Someone will hear us…”
“Your connection with me. You have a birthmark, right here in your arse,” Harry touched the place he was seeing the mark, and Draco tried to see it, but it was impossible on that angle. “It matches the one in my groin… I mean, it aligns. When I’m completely deep inside you, they’ll be touching.”
Draco didn't respond immediately, his tears streaming from his eyes toward the mattress. He took a deep breath, thinking of a simpler way to say it. There wasn’t one.
“Make love to me, Harry,” Draco asked, looking up to him. “I’m not going to take those potions anymore. I’m tired. I just want to feel you now. Please, take care of me.”
“No, I quite like my car so I wouldn’t want it to be frozen. I’m Draco, by the way.” He raised his hand, the tip of his long bony fingers a bit purplish with the cold.
“You’re delicious. So beautiful, so hot… I want it all in my mouth,” Draco said, almost as a warning, before sucking Harry’s cock head between his wet, hot lips.
year Ravenclaw behind the grand piano, and she smiled back at Potter.
The hours were long and Harry felt useless, but he couldn’t hold himself together when he saw his first puppy come into the world. He was white with black ears and paws, and Draco didn’t waste any time before licking him clean. Then another followed, exactly like his first brother. Hours later, they had their four puppies out, the last ones smaller than the two that were born first. The third one had black fur with a white long spot on their back, and the last one was entirely white. He had three little boys and one girl, who were now feasting on Draco’s nipples as the white wolf panted after hours of work, pushing babies and placentas out of him.
“As soon as we take the picture, you can take it off,” Draco offered, putting Castor into Harry’s arms and proceeding to take care of the other boys’ hair and clothes. It didn’t take long for the photographer to arrive, but at this point, the kids were bored and united in hatred of their clothes. It seemed like if the robes were scratching Aries, suddenly all the other robes were also scratchy, and the kids couldn’t stop whining about it every five seconds.
“I see you’re already here,” a husky, deep voice sounded behind me, and I turned, looking at my new alpha. He was stripped of his armour, using only a white, soft shirt, black trousers and boots.
staring at us already, and I’m sure they were either waiting for us to punch each other or to kiss each other. Maybe both, if they had a wild imagination. Besides, he was my
“Yes, please,” Draco nodded, opening himself again for Harry. Harry proceeded to touch the head of his cock to Draco’s rim, and pressed inside, Draco’s slick helping him in.
“I’m going to talk to Ron and Hermione. Do you want to go anywhere, or…?” Harry started to ask. From now on, he was responsible for Malfoy’s safety.
I was so attuned to Potter these days it was crazy. First, it was his scent, and then his voice, and then his whole presence. I knew what it meant, but I refused to actually think about it. Me and Potter being mates? That’s a huge prank from the universe, right there. So I would just ignore it before it actually made me miserable.
“WHAT?!” I couldn’t help the word that just slipped out of my mouth. “I’m not even a singer!”
. He knew Draco wouldn’t just say those things to be in his good favour, and he couldn’t help the heat on his cheeks.
Harry looked in McGonagall’s direction and saw her talking quietly to a house-elf, who was dressed in a flashy neon-blue dress. The elf nodded, disappearing quickly before McGonagall started eating her food.
I thought to myself. Indeed, we were closer now than ever before. I mostly just teased him to make him laugh nowadays, after I discovered he thought I was funny. And, that naughty little fox inside of me who wanted to roll and show its belly for our mate was incredibly insistent that I just accept the offer. It would give us more time with Harry –
“You should get your things and get inside. Your face is turning dark pink with the weather, and the snow is getting thicker by the minute", said the man, "I’ll park my truck in the garage over there,” the man pointed to another large building beside the house. “There’s space for another car. I suggest you do it unless you like your car frozen?”
The third box, however, appeared to be filled with Roberto's own personal items. There were two knives, a lighter, some cigarettes and men's clothing. There was also a small collection of blankets and bedspreads, as well as a hammock for sleeping. Harry raised his eyebrows, smiling at Lucy.
“It will sink. We need to get him to go around,” Harry announced, and Draco nodded. He knew that from that distance whoever was on the boat - which was a medium-sized one, probably for small loads - had seen them both at the beach.
“You never said I couldn’t ask for help. You’re just mad because I won our bet.”
Draco laughed, resting his chin in his closed fist, his elbow resting on the island top.
“It’s not delicious
Harry held him by his hips and started to move, trying not to go too fast or hard because of the sounds, but his body was moving against his better judgement, and soon enough, he was pounding madly into Draco, that had a hand on his mouth, biting hard on his fingers. It was fast and messy, and exciting and delicious. Soon, Draco was coming all over the wall, his eyes turning behind his eyelids, his mouth open, and a thread of saliva running from the side of his lower lip.
“We should probably get this out of here. All cargo will be damaged if the sea can penetrate the boxes.” Roberto pointed to the objects. Harry found it useless to worry about it, after all, there was no way for the man to sell it since he would no longer be able to leave the island. But maybe he was still in denial, as he and Draco were at the beginning when they fell there. “Can you help me, Harry? Lucy probably shouldn't be carrying weight in her condition.”
He hadn’t slept so comfortably since before falling on that island.
“So we’re going in this order… Autumn, Winter, Spring and Summer. Is that okay?”
Harry nodded, throwing the rest of their food in the trash, and looked at Draco.
Draco looked up at him with shining eyes. Harry thought he was crying, but noticed the smile on his lips.
Around this time, Harry realised that his eyesight was not so bad, something he hadn't stopped to notice in a long time.
“I was going to ask if I could have the one beside the window. I love staring outside.”
“Yes, Dray. Eat something. You haven’t been eating properly lately and I’m worried about you.” Harry admitted, and Draco looked down, grabbing a pear to disguise the fact he was embarrassed.
, saying it was amazing even though it was three hours long. Draco decided to give in, and he was glad he did. The film wasn’t as incredible as Harry said it was, but the soundtrack was simply amazing. He could listen to that forever, and it actually made his mind burst with ideas for a completely new story.
But then, Harry giggled.
nobility, a Duchess, but still, I was her prince and she owned me respect. We were together since we were babies, though, and it was hard to actually make her treat me as a prince.
“We need to get the salt out of your body.” Harry said. He didn't know if they needed to, but he knew Dracy must be sore and bruised. “You... Can you heal yourself down there?”
“Will I have a uniform and all?” He asked, and Harry smiled.
Slowly, the hormones started to change Draco, small changes that they could observe slowly appearing. He was gaining weight, and Harry loved that being honest. Draco was always so skinny, and seeing with a bit of extra padding wasn’t bad. He rounded around his thighs and hips, a little on the stomach and his tits started to show a bit more. Harry loved to spend time licking and sucking and teasing the little nubs while fucking him, Draco sitting on his lap and grinding against him.
“That’s… Beautiful,” Harry mumbled, before looking at Draco.
“Is everything okay, professor?” Harry asked, walking beside her. It was unnerving, being taller than her now. He still felt like a small little boy under her hard observation.
“They'll thank you because I'm gone, Potter. It is your absence that they will notice. Not mine.”
When Dracy calmed down, he smiled, spreading his legs and calling on Harry to settle between them.
“Now come on, my fox still has to teach your elk how to move.”
“But this is a wedding bond... Like ours.” Hermione pointed to the image of the Weasley family, restored after Harry returned to live at the Black house. There was a golden braided thread, just like Harry and Draco's, between Ron and Hermione. “We need to want the bond so that it takes root, don't we?”
. It was so good, the pain-pleasure of being bred.
“So… Are you guys really staying for the play?” I asked, and Ron raised his head from the parchment he was writing.
That took Harry by surprise. And McGonagall knew it would, or else she would’ve talked about it before he agreed to do it.. Now he couldn’t back out, and he was very sure she had done it on purpose, especially because Malfoy didn’t look at all surprised. He sighed, nodding and resigned.
Malfoy sat on the sand, spitting water, and before Harry could say anything, Draco sobbed, a desperate cry coming out of his mouth.
At that moment, he was thinking that maybe he shouldn’t have trusted Harry that easily. What was done, was done now, though. There was nothing he could do about it now.
I'm so happy to have had a good reception of this fic! Thank you so much for all the kindness you have given me!
no one is going to question whether or not you belong with me. Destiny itself said you do.”
A half an hour later, Harry returned with his shirt wrapped around six small fish. Near the fire, he wiped the fish off their gut with his knife. Malfoy was almost throwing up beside him, grimacing and holding the skewers where they would put the fish. Harry washed them with coconut water and left them baking on the skewers. They didn't really talk that night. They were both worried about what would happen to them at that location, and if anyone would find them. They ate in silence, and finally sated, the tiredness of the day began to weigh heavily. Draco retreated into the small hut they had made, just enough so that they could lie side by side away from rain and wind, and then slept. Harry still spent some time staring at the fire, his eyes and body tired. He wondered what he would do the next day. He needed to find out if they were civilisation around. It didn't seem to have, but it didn't cost anything to look for some human presence. He needed to know whether they were in an island or part of a continent.
Signs of post-partum depression.
After a labour of four hours, the mediwitch finally held their baby in her arms, smiling at them as another mediwitch cut the cord and made the baby cry.
“Don’t you have yourself on a pedestal? Is your sperm made out of gold?” Draco teased, and Harry laughed, finally slipping out of him.
I tentatively smiled at him, and he smiled back, as if his shirt wasn’t wet with my tears and probably snot. I must’ve look stupid with a red nose and puffy red eyes.
“I did. Just a bit tiring, but yeah. You?”
“Hi, mate. I missed you,” Harry said, putting James on the floor and unbuttoning his auror red coat and approaching Draco. “Hello, my love.”
“Okay!” Draco screamed back, not really knowing what else to do.
Draco liked to remember when he was alone at night and Harry had to stay longer in the Magical Pet Shop he worked because one of the crups was having puppies or something like that, that one day where Harry had rimmed him so good that Harry had come untouched when he made Draco come.
“Are you okay?! Do you need help?” The man spoke, his voice muffled by the closed windows and snow.
“Your cock is huge,” Draco replied, and Harry chuckled, but didn’t say anything. He opened his mouth, sucking Draco’s cock almost all the way, making Draco howl in pleasure. Harry’s mouth was hot and wet, and he started to bob his head up and down, sucking on Draco’s cock as if he was a lolly. Harry moved one of his hands up, tweaking his nipple, and with the other, he pressed between Draco’s arse cheeks, that were wet with his own slick. Harry pressed one finger inside, moving it with the rhythm of his mouth, and then two, curving them up as he fucked them into Draco’s hole.
Ron and Hermione were in front of him, sitting side by side. It felt normal, eating in the Great Hall with his two best friends. They were talking about how they would have more privileges as they were now adults – like the ending of curfew and a free pass to Hogsmeade. Harry was about to grab a plate of dessert when a flying paper bird stopped at his front. He grabbed it, looking around and stopping when he saw McGonagall. She was subtly gesturing for him to open it.
“What's your name?” Harry asked, and the man turned his eyes to him.
Almost as soon as they crossed their front door and Draco put the booklet and the potion on the table on the side of the door, Harry pounced on him, pressing him against the door, holding his waist and kissing him deeply.
Dracy shook his head, his hands covering his mouth.
“Maybe we should start looking at those options. I’m not a full veela and I’ve been taking the potions religiously. It’s changed my whole body and still, we haven’t had any success.”
“Yeah, he was wearing half of it by the end, but the plate was empty,” he said, making them laugh. “But come on, show us the babe.”
“Yes, it was actually quite okay when we talked earlier. He’s… He’s
“Mr Malfoy. Was your dinner to your liking?” McGonagall asked him, and Malfoy nodded.
“I was just trying to make the temperature different. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. So many important docs have been destroyed, and the autumn tree is destroying my books, and—“
“Well… I guess we eat your stew, and just… You know… Talk. We’re lucky we found each other… But it doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy. We’re virtually strangers.”
“Hey, how are the loves of my life?” Harry asked, getting near them, kissing Draco’s hair and caressing their girl’s soft curls, white and black mixing along her hairline.
After the first month, Draco stopped being news. He was studying all the time with Harry, Ron and Hermione at the Library, and most nights all of them would sit around Harry and Draco’s common room to talk or play some games. Ron found a fine match at Wizard’s Chess in Draco, and sometimes Hermione and Harry would sit beside them and watch them play.
“It’s so fucking hot now,” Draco said, kicking the blankets out and looking around.
He thought for a moment before breathing in deeply and looking directly at me. His gaze was strong and intense, and my legs felt a bit wobbly with his stare.
“Did you give it to her? Tell me you didn't give it to her!” His screams were almost animal, and Dracy started to sob, tears falling from his confused eyes.
“Yes to what?” I asked stupidly, and Malfoy rolled his eyes with impatience.
DRACO
He grabbed his towel and went to their bathroom. It was
Way too soon, we had to walk to the stage in front of all the other students and the teachers, and Draco released my hand. All the narration I was going to do between the other basses, so I wasn’t as nervous in the beginning. It was the solo part that terrified me.
Happy New Year, guys! Once again, thank you so much for your support. I hope you enjoy this new chapter!
I should’ve send her to the stocks for talking to me like I was at her level, but I couldn’t blame Pansy. She
“What do you want, oh big bad crup trainer?” Draco teased.
“Been checking me out, have you?”
“My car is stuck in the snow, I can’t move,” Draco said from the inside, and the man looked behind Draco’s car to his own truck, the wheels well prepared for deep snow. The car was tall and powerful, and Draco knew that here was a man who came prepared to help.
And try they did. Draco was taking his hormones regularly, and all the vitamins he needed. They tracked when Draco was ovulating and had sex every other day. It was, of course, nothing difficult for them because they just loved it, and it was even better to imagine Harry’s seed had taken root after one of their moments together.
Harry cleaned her up with the lake water, removing all the goo that was still on her small body. He didn't care that all of his clothes were wet. Looking at his daughter -
just thinking about it, I’ll fill you up with my babies, fuck my come in you until you’re full with it and then I’ll see your belly grow with the proof we did it.”
-x-x-x-
“You’re… Not a freak. Really not.” Draco said, but Harry didn’t want to listen to him. He shampooed his hair in record time, washed it off and grabbed a towel, practically flying out of the bathroom.
“Not even them.”
Harry observed Draco’s face, his pink nose and lips, grey eyes, silver-blond hair with multi-coloured flowers on it. He looked like a Tolkien elf, and Harry felt his heart skip a beat.
The days passed as such. With Harry by his side, anyone who had anything bad to say to Draco restrained themselves. And even those who wanted to say anything directed their words towards Harry.
“Your friends, yes. You’ll have time today after you settle.” McGonagall nodded, standing and asking them both to follow her.
“I think we better look for him,” Harry said, taking the spear with which they hunted fish and following into the forest, Lucy in pursuit.
Draco sighed again, but a soft smile was in his lips.
“Fuck, Draco, I’m going to… Hnnn… Give you all… Your arse is so tight… So wet for me… Tell me you’ll be mine! No one else, just me!”
. I didn’t know if it was simply because he was getting too tall for his own body, or simply because you can’t expect a deer – or whatever animal he was – to dance. To be true, I couldn’t figure out what animal shifter he was yet, except it was big. Some people were more sensitive about it, but it wasn’t the norm.
“Yes, we’re in.”
“Aren’t you a smart arse?” Harry smiled at him, and Draco smiled back, rolling his eyes and going to the bathroom to shower.
“No, I don’t mean your father and mother’s house. I mean, the
“It’s okay, Draco. You’re still a prick. But you’re my prick.”
“It wasn’t you, Harry,” Draco opened his eyes, looking at him, his tears falling down his cheeks. “I’m worried if I don’t do my job properly, I’ll go to Azkaban. I spent a week there. I don’t want to see that place anymore. Harry… I thought I didn’t have a soul anymore.”
“I think the tree wanted
low in his throat, taking off his pants and showing how hard his cock was. Harry was thick and long, and Draco loved to suck hard on him, but Harry had that type of gleam in his eyes that showed he was a predator seeing his prey.
His son was wearing mismatched socks – one green, one blue – and his red jumper was a tad too big for him. Draco used this opportunity to check on his nappy, but he was clean and dry.
Harry combed through his jet black hair with his fingers, doing nothing to put it in place, but  sweeping it back off his eyes. He had a nasty scar on his forehead, coming from his hairline to the top of his right eyebrow, cutting it in thirds. It looked like lightning across his skin. His eyes were even more intense, but he took a pair of dark rimmed glasses from his pocket and put them on his face, blinking as if he was seeing for the first time.
“You should get some sleep,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s neck as his omega put his weight on him, his left hand resting on the small bump of his belly.
“Harry...!” Dracy groaned in a whisper, slowly spreading his legs. Harry ran his hand down his body, holding the small penis between his fingers and beginning to gently masturbate it.
“What do you mean?” Harry frowned, and waited for an answer.
was Malfoy’s scent, or that I started having wet dreams about the git. It really wasn’t pleasant to wake up with a ranging knot, and being unable to jerk off because I had four blokes sleeping right next to me. Of course I could’ve used magic to block sounds and avoid them opening my curtains, but we
Draco’s face merged in surprise and he blinked, confused, shaking his head.
Harry sighed, removing his clothes even with a hard-on. Well, Draco said he didn’t care, didn’t he? Still, he was careful not to be turned to Draco as he removed his clothes, throwing them in the clothes bin too. He took off the elastic band holding his hair and walked to the shower.
Still, he was sleepy. He had received a report from the Department of Mysteries, and it made no sense to his sleepy mind. He remembered knocking on his favourite Unspeakable door because it was the only one he trusted to give him the information without a mixture of the crush everyone seemed to have on him, and he remembered seeing Malfoy open the door with a not so friendly face. They argued over the report. Malfoy left his office - without letting Harry get into it - locked and headed for the department aisles, looking for an item that should’ve been there.
“Miss daddy,” James whispered, and Draco kissed his forehead, trying to flatten his hair even though he knew that was a lost battle.
“I might get you pregnant.” Draco thought maybe Harry was trying to find reason in what they were doing, but Draco was past that. He
As soon as they passed the door, Draco started removing his clothes, leaving them on the floor and going to the bathroom.
During construction, they paused to eat, bathe, rest and have sex. They learned a lot about each other's bodies during the weeks of building the cabin, without worrying about being carried away by the wonderful sensations of being in each other's arms.
“Papa’s tired, mate. He really needs to sleep today. Maybe for a few days he’ll be tired. Having babies is hard work and he was really strong today, but now he’s very sleepy.”
“Draco, you’ll be sitting in the middle with Harry as usual, I suppose?” Mark the photographer asked, and Draco nodded, trying not to show he was nervous. Sirius had a weird, coy smile on his face, which meant the bucket likely wasn’t the only trap.
Being a half-blood, he probably knew.
“Me neither, with you talking to me,” Ron said, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Neither could eat much. They prepared the supplies for the trip, and Harry was thankful for being able to use wandless aguamenti, or they would be dead before they left. As long as they had drinkable water, they could survive.
. But it may be for you.” Harry said, biting his lower lip and trying not to get his hopes up, but it was happening anyway. “I think you’re pregnant.”
“So it can be a good opportunity for you to have… A test of what a security job might entail.”
“Should we do the testing to clear our heads, then?” Harry suggested, and Draco got out of the bed, grabbing his wand and turning back to Harry.
“Come on, while these two are calm.”
I was a bit out of everything, but I smiled when he kissed my hair, raising his hand and slowly caressing my nipples as he waited his knot to subside. It was careful and tender and even though it made me hot again, it was also very soothing.
“Yes, I mean… After you protected him at the trials I wouldn’t be surprised if you tried to be friends with him. But that’s not what you were trying to say.”
“We don’t have these types of storms where I live. Snow, yes, but not this intense and not so sudden. Not awful like this.” Draco sighed, licking his lips and looking up at Harry. “Why were you outside if you knew the storm was going to be awful?”
He sucked on my slick, licking around my passage and pressing his tongue inside, fucking me with the wet muscle. I couldn’t control myself and my whole body shuddered as I came, hard, my hole clamping around his tongue, my come wetting his bed. He didn’t stop fucking me with his tongue, and even put his hands down so he could pinch my nipples and pull at them as he tongue-fucked me.
And what made it harder was that I was sitting right beside Malfoy, because I was so attuned to his almost-soprano tone that my voice would go immediately higher to match his. I had to pay much more attention to Maximillian Donahue, the bass Hufflepuff at my side, so my voice was as low as we needed to the song.
“Well, the good part about being a self-publishing writer is that I don’t need an office to work. I often do it in my bed between a cliché film or another.” Draco snuggled against Harry, happy and warm, despite the weather.
He and Saturn left the babies’ nursery, and Harry walked with his older son to his bedroom.
“I’m going to fuck you until you’re pregnant. I’m going to fuck a baby into you, you fucking southern slut, I’m going to fucking mark you with my spunk so you smell like me forever,” Harry growled, and it shouldn’t be so hot, but it was, and I screamed as I came again, clamping around his cock.
“It sounds wrong. Call me Potter.”
“That’s… That’s what it looks like, isn’t it? You randomly save me, you have my snake… I get stuck a few meters away from your house… There’s a lot of coincidences, don’t you think?”
to make Draco feel good. He got off on it, actually.
“Okay. Where is it?” Harry asked, trying not to be nervous. He was going to live with Malfoy in close quarters for a whole school year. It was going to be fine. It was. “I have to talk to…”
“I loved the debut of our new house.” Harry commented, and Draco laughed, lying down next to him without being too bothered by the fact that his legs were a little sticky.
They parked the car and the truck inside the garage. Draco took his bags from inside the car, checked if he had his laptop case and phone with him and walked with the stranger to his house.
“Thinking about getting another one of these?” Harry teased, and Draco chuckled, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
He felt pity for Malfoy. Being an Unspeakable, he worked in the depths of the Ministry without making the effort that the Aurors made every day. The day must have been heavier than any other day the man had ever experienced in his life - except, of course, the war days. So he took one of the closed coconuts and, with his knife, cut the top, opening enough so that he could drink the water from inside. He took a sip, then patted Malfoy's arm, which took his forearm out of his eyes and stared at him, grouchy.
“I just put four logs on the ground.” Harry sighed, approaching Draco. He was covered in sand and grass, but Draco rolled his eyes, giving him a peck on the lips.
Draco would sometimes call Harry on his muggle phone and say ‘Hi, baby Daddy’ just to have him extra worked up while Harry was working.
“No-no-no, wait, Potter!” I raised my hand so he would stop talking. “I was just a bit surprised. You talked to me as if I were… your friend.”
“Let’s imagine I am your friend – not saying I am, but hypothetically thinking I am. How would the whole thing work? You have your friends and the Weasleys, they
“Are these our only options, Potter?” Malfoy asked, and Harry put his hands on his hips tiredly.
In England, on the tapestry at the Blacks' house on Grimmauld, a new image emerged. Underneath it was written TALITHA MALFOY-POTTER, DECEMBER 16, 2010.
He did, reading the message inside it.
Harry looked at him like Draco just said the craziest thing.
“Let’s go. I’ll be going to Weasley’s house tomorrow, so I might as well face him now.”
“Do you know how to create fire? Water? Do you know how to do a ‘reparo’?” Harry asked, and Draco shook his head.
, considering it was for just one person. There was a bathtub, for one, and it was big. The showerhead looked like it was made of gold, and there were two sinks in the counter. Draco’s toiletries were already on his side of the sink, and putting his clothes hanging on the side of the tub, Harry came back to grab his own toiletries that he had forgotten. Shampoo, shaving cream, razor, soap and deodorant. Harry couldn't imagine any wizard needing more than that, but Draco certainly had at least double his number of things on his side.
“I know, my love. But it will end soon. I promise.”
It was like the whole room was blooming, like all the flowers grew around them, mixing with the sunny sensation of the summer, and then…
That made Draco smile.
“This is the meeting schedule. I hope you don’t do anything stupid, like trying to get away from it.” She said with a smile, and I just breathed in deeply as I pocketed the piece of old paper.
It was weird, but then again, it was all a political statement, and I was a pawn in all of this. I sighed, but walked with grace and poise with Pansy slightly behind me.
Harry sighed, turning his face to the island as they gradually walked away. He and Draco had previously agreed on how to use the oars synchronously, and their willingness to survive made them easily come to terms.
“Your cock is definitely
“The young Alpha Dustin will join the guard training course with us at the Alpha Manor to learn discipline and values. Omega Christine will return home with her father and she will spend three months working at the maternity ward with our midwives so she can see some future expectations,” Harry said, and that made the old alpha chuckle. “Do all of you agree?”
-x-x-
Their conversation stopped there. The Professor cleared her throat, asking for them both to sit on the chairs in front of her desk, and she sat behind it.
“Talitha... Yes, she looks like her name. But the next time we have a girl, we're going to use the Evans tradition, okay?” Harry said, and Dracy smiled along, leaning his head on Harry's shoulder as they both watched the little miracle that was their baby between them.
Saturn looked down at his brother, their black hair matching, and he sniffled. It took Harry a few seconds to notice Saturn was crying.
“Arsehole. It’s just I think Mrs Weasley would like us to be there on Christmas day… I figured even if I didn’t go, she’d like you two to be with her.”
“That’s
The party had a lot of food and a lot of alcohol. Firewhiskey bottles and butterbeer were passed around, and Harry was a little tipsy when he and Draco came back to their dorm.
Soon after Draco left the shelter. Harry gave him some mint leaves and water, and Draco thanked him with a nod. After the kiss, Harry supposed everything would be very strange between them, but the expectation of the journey into the unknown was more important than that.
“Fuck, what are you doing?” Draco mumbled when they parted for air, and Harry licked Draco lips, sucking on the bottom one before replying.
was the jewel, so I didn’t need anything on me, otherwise it would shine more than I did.
Harry moved slowly against Draco’s mouth, and Draco followed his movements, swallowing down to the base, moaning lowly every time he had room to breathe.
“What if one gets in my ear? In my mouth?!” Draco asked, scared, and Harry threw the caterpillar away, picking up the leaves and dragging them to a firm, dry spot where he could set up camp.
All three looked at him, blinking before Ron broke the silence.
The king held my gown by the opening on my neck and ripped it open as if it was made of paper, and soon I was completely exposed. My nipples were hard and red, and he didn’t waist any time before opening his mouth and sucking hard on one of them, his hand kneading the other one, thumb and forefinger pulling hard at the nipple. His tongue was circling my other nipple, and then he sucked hard on it before biting it. I was afraid I was going to come even before he fucked me like he promised.
-x-x-
“I’m fucking sorry, Draco, but this is too hot. I have to take it off,” Harry said, taking his t-shirt off and trying to create some wind around himself with it. His body was covered in sweat, and his body hair was practically glued to his tanned skin. It felt so much better that he stopped for a moment, his body cooling before he noticed Draco looking at him with his mouth open and a vacant stare. “Dray?”
“But they can't! Not while Harry and Draco are alive!” Hermione exclaimed, closing the book abruptly and looking at Ron with shining eyes. Hugo's eyes widened with the outburst, but he didn't move much. Hermione no longer cried every day, but the pain continued. Not only her best friend, but a very close to her coworker, had disappeared. Hermione and Malfoy were not necessarily friends, but the Unspeakable worked on many projects with her at the Ministry. Hermione was still on maternity leave, and Ron thanked Merlin for it, as it was possible that she, too, would be missing if she was still working at the time the attack happened.
“I promised I wouldn't reveal that secret. But I have a reliable source who tells me that they are both alive,” Ron stated again, and the Unspeakable shook his head.
“Fuck you, Potter,” Draco laughed back, punching him on the shoulder.
They got into the house, and Draco noticed straight away that it was simply furnished. A man’s house through and through, with practical furniture and next to no decoration, with the exception of the roll of photos on top of the fireplace, which was lightened, warming the place nicely.
“Correct. But, they didn’t
“I’d lick you from head to toe,” Harry mumbled against his ear, and soon they were ready to go at it again.
“Potter!” He heard a shout, and Malfoy was shoving something into his hands and everything went dark.
“We're trapped, Potter. No wands, no returning portkey. We are trapped,” Harry could tell he was already with a red nose and was trying to be serious, but his hands were shaking. “Our only hope is that they send someone after us. Or rather,” Malfoy gave a bland laugh. “after Harry Potter, hn?”
He was surprised when Slughorn asked Draco to be the leader of the Slytherin team. He was there when Draco was asked, and he could see how happy, but scared, Draco was. Harry knew how Quidditch was important to Draco, and he nodded slightly, encouraging Draco to accept.
He stretched to the side of the bed where his jeans were, and grabbed his mobile phone. He opened the camera and gave it to Harry.
The midwife didn’t take too long to enter Draco’s nest, though, and she checked his opening.
According to his notes on the stone, it was May 9th when the cabin was finally finished. It was raised from the floor, and a log staircase gave access to a balcony. There was a door, which Harry and Draco made by braiding jute strings, branches and coconut leaves. It was a sliding door, and as they already saw that there were no large predators on the island, it was enough to keep the most insistent monkeys out of the house. Inside, Harry decided to make three separate rooms. One was a room with considerable space for them to sleep. They covered the bed - which Harry had made with some logs, to lift them off the floor - with soft leaves sheets covered by a braided layer of jute that resembled a long sheet of straw, but Draco was planning to make a mattress out of cotton as soon as he had threads and enough balls. They also made a low table so that they could have some comfort while eating. There were two windows in the first room, which could be closed by doors that fit the hole and were leaning against the wall during the day. Draco's current project was to make curtains for the windows. There was a window in each room, also following the same pattern. They were currently using the second room to store the materials Draco had managed to collect, such as cotton and jute fibers already separated from their leaves. The pots and pans they made with clay were in the area next to the table, and they remade the fire next to the house.
Draco knew he should’ve waited at least for the weather to clear out before trying to come back home from his aunt’s countryside house. He was eager to come back home, though, to the comfort of his city flat and WiFi connection. He was 26, self-employed, writing and publishing eBooks at his own pace, and with the rate of his writing and the amount of books he had published already, he was doing well for himself, earning a nice amount of money. He had decided to give himself some holidays, to be a few days away from the chaotic city rhythm, but three days was quite enough.
… Like me and you?” Hermione asked, and I could see Ron nodding through my fingers.
Draco giggled, and it turned into a moan when Harry pressed his cock into Draco’s, making his eyes roll backwards.
From then on, the months passed without much trouble. Sometime at the beginning of the sixth month, Lucy came close to Harry in the hammock, sitting down next to him.
“And don’t forget that intense sensation, I’m sure it meant what we think it means…” Harry said, excited, and smiled more openly. “Are we really soulmates?”
“Well, Padma, you deserve a big room, of course.”
“I love you, you know that, right?”
“What?”
“I love you. You know that, right? I love you more than I can say.”
“Who runs away without their wands, Hermione? No, they were attacked and were probably captured. What confuses me is the bond... Could they have been forced?”
“Potter, we should stay here in case they... Potter! Are you listening to me?”
Malfoy smelt like freshly picked Jasmine with a hint of mint. He had this scent all over himself, and it was so strong it overwhelmed my senses. My Elk wanted to do a mating dance wherever I saw that bastard, and I had to focus as hard as I could so I wouldn’t forget a cue.
DRACO
As they sat in the clearing on one of the cotton sheets, eating quietly while Dracy and Harry took turns giving each other small pieces of fruit to Talitha, something unexpected happened.
There was nothing to stop us now, except myself. His scent was like a hug, a much needed one, and I believed him. I knew Potter wasn’t lying, and I nodded, because I didn’t know how to really respond to that. I was mostly a practical person. Give me a problem and I’ll give you a solution, and that’s what I did my entire life. Did I get scared? Hell yes, I was a coward alright, and a proud one. Being scared kept me alive, and I liked being alive, thank you very much. But even scared, if I knew I had to do something, I just went and did it. Or at least tried to do it.
“He has no heartbeat, and doesn’t breathe. His body is... very cold.” Lucy said, looking at Harry with tears in her eyes, which she didn’t drop. “He killed himself.”
The first couple of months were amazing. Every time Harry came back from the Pet Shop, they were at it. Draco worked from home, making magical art for a number of clients, but every time Harry arrived, he was naked and ready. Their role play only intensified, and soon they were coming more than they ever had before. Sex was always fun and they never had problems getting into the act, but two weeks later when they did the tests to see if it worked… Frustration always came with negative results.
“His Highness was very kind to give me the bigger room,” she explained, and Harry smiled at her.
Harry was amazed, looking from Talitha to the fruit. Perhaps because she was so small, Talitha was unable to get the mango into her hand, letting it fall halfway. Harry levitated the fruit the rest of the way and handed it to Talitha, who tried to bite the mango peel, but without much success.
“It's difficult, but I can try.” Harry teased, and Dracy couldn't resist the laugh that came to her lips. “What do you want to talk about?”
And then I knew that I loved him. With my very own soul.
I’ve heard a lot about the long cold war between the South and North-eastern kingdoms. It was a war started by the South Kingdom – my home and pride, although I could see where we’ve been in the wrong. Being in an eternal winter, the South kingdom lacked a lot, and so they tried hard to manipulate and steal the other kingdoms. Our first King, Salazar Slytherin, had a lot of success. Soon enough we were owners of the Central and North kingdoms. The Northeast was never a problem. Godric Gryffindor was much more concerned with his own people.
. We need another family picture.”
“I’m ready,” I said, and I walked through the doors of the small area of the Potter palace I was put into to wait for the ceremony. I haven’t talked or seen my future husband yet. His right hand, a knight called Weasley, was the one who received me and directed me to these rooms. They would put all my belongings in my new area in the castle and I could fix it to my preferences later if I didn’t like what the servants did to my things, but I would only enter the Solar Castle once I was a Potter, too.
They went to the kitchen, and Harry turned on the burner of the stove again, a big pot over it. He took off the lid, peering inside and using a ladle to mix the stew inside, probably gone stone cold by now.
At least, reinedangoisse, the berries made their appearance... ooh...

“You are as necessary in that place as I am. Soon they will be here. Come on, we need to make a shelter, find water and food before it gets dark,” Harry reached his hand so Draco could stand, but he didn't take his hand. “Fine, starve yourself.”
"Morning, princess," Harry teased, and Draco rolled his eyes, flipping him the two fingers. Damn, Draco Malfoy was cute. "Come on, we have a long day of learning to go by today."
Thank you all for the warm reception! I couldn't wait to post this chapter. I hope you all like it.
There were two beds, exactly like the ones in every dorm room, but their sheets and curtains were white. One was beside the window and the other beside the wall. The room wasn’t big, and there was a single wardrobe for both of them to share.
Lucy grabbed him by the hair, and Harry felt her come, her cunt twitching around his fingers, the lubricating liquid dripping from her entrance. She didn’t come from her cock, which Harry didn’t think was strange since, although he didn’t realise it the first few times, as the months went by and the number of times they had fucked, Harry noticed that Dr-
This chapter is smaller than the other ones, but it's needed for the transition of the situations in which they are. I hope you all like it.
I smiled at him, and I allowed myself to hug him once more.
By the time they started working on Spring, half of Draco’s office was full of flowers. They smelt amazing, and Harry almost felt sorry for getting rid of it. They decided that the flower may have something related to Draco’s mother, who was currently living in France, so they tried a couple of things related to her.
“Yucky! Yucky! Yucky!” Cygnus kept screaming, and threw all the beans on the floor, trying to clean his mouth with his robes.
Harry looked at the three of them, trying to think of a way to please everyone.

Of course, I couldn’t observe much before Pansy nagged me about how inappropriate my behaviour was.
He positioned himself behind me and used my own slick to wet his cock. He touched the spongy head on my hole, and pressed in. By body needed him so desperately that it opened up easily. He was still was too big for me, and I felt my body struggling to hold him completely. It looked like he was pressing in for an eternity until he stopped.
“We only have four basses, Harry. Max is not going to be with us, so it goes down to three. Me and Payton are needed here,” John, one of the other basses, said. He and Payton were Slytherins, but we actually became good mates in the past two weeks. It was a bit of an inside joke to tease the tenors and be teased back. The choir had seven tenors, so we were a bit outnumbered, but we formed an union of sorts.
“Y-Yeah, sure.”
, and then this is your room, and my room, and Cynthy’s room, and this is Padma’s room, and this the kitchen…”
Harry could barely see them with the tears in his eyes, and he didn’t care when they fell, crouching down and caressing her little cheek.
“I don’t think the weather might be better tomorrow,” Draco said, and Harry walked beside him, his hands shoved deep in his pockets.
Draco almost howled, pulling on Harry’s hair and coming between them. Harry looked at him, and he felt his orgasm coming without control. Draco must’ve felt him jerking inside of him because he hoarsely moaned:
Draco did, holding onto the towel like it was going to save his life.
“Dray... To be honest, it's a little confusing for me. But I can
