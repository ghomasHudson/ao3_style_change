Once he was fully nude, Harry got onto the bed in front of Draco. He got settled with his back against the pillows, his legs stretched wide on either side of the blonde. He watched as Draco’s eyes immediately fell to his cock, biting his lip as it was far too close to not be in his mouth already. He got onto all fours, crawling forward and placing his hands on either side of Harry’s thighs.
“Have you ever been close to Malfoy?”
“Hey!” Draco meant to protest, but Harry simply smacked his bum again.
What did he get himself into?
Harry was spent. He was practically lithe, but he kissed Draco’s cheek and met his thrusts a total of four times before they were both coming.
“Bet you could take more than just this,” he continued, “bet you could take a couple of rounds… or maybe even another cock.”
“What did you call me?” Harry asked, holding Draco down so that he couldn’t continue to move on Harry’s cock.
Nothing was said as Ron reached into the bedside table, rummaging around while Harry stripped out of his own clothes. Draco simply watched, careful to not speak as he was told. He figured he had given Harry enough turmoil for at least two more hours or so.
Wednesday there was his homework. Harry had his books tucked tightly under his right arm as he made his way down the turning stairs, moving hurriedly as to not be relocated. As he reached the first hall, he ran into Draco, his books and papers being let go of and landing on the floor. Draco leaned down, snatching a piece of paper from Harry’s loose grasp and smirking as he saw it was the homework for Snape’s class. After tsking that Harry was too soft to survive Snape’s detention he pouted his lip out and walked off, the paper now a ball in his hand.
Harry would do no such thing, as he was sitting on the bed that he had arranged to be there before Draco came. It had nothing more than dark green silk sheets and pillows with matching dark green silk pillowcases.
Draco didn’t.
Harry was the first to pull back, catching his breath and looking at Draco’s blown pupils. He nearly lost his breath again.
"So," Malfoy said suddenly, yanking Harry back to his current situation, "do you know which one is the lie, Potter?"
"Tell me, Potter, which is the lie?"
Harry cleared his throat, not knowing what to say. All his emotions were fighting at the moment, a mix of anger, sadness, relief, confusion clouding his head and heart. Finally, he got out the only words that he could.
Draco lifted an eyebrow at that but obeyed nonetheless. He spread Potter’s legs himself before going at a brutal pace that (quite literally) knocked the breath out of the boy beneath him.
“I-I know, don’t need it,” even though his thighs were burning he kept going, so close to cumming, “please, need to cum,”
“Yes, I can get a bit… rough at times,” Harry explained, “so I want you to have a safe word, in case you need to stop.”
He had profusely apologized for being late and after being threatened with detention if he so much as the thought of being late again he was let go to sulk to the back of the classroom and slide into a seat beside Oliver.
“As funny as it was to see Potter wearing it, you definitely look better in it,” Blaise complimented, nudging Draco’s hand with his own.
“No. Whatever you’re thinking, put it out of your mind.”
“No,” Draco denied, buckling his belt and turning to Harry, “no game.”
He changed his angle right away, knowing where that bundle on nerves that drive Harry wild was located. As he hit it again and again Harry was starting to shake. Tears were forming in his eyes and fire was burning up his veins and he gave a broken sob as his cock began to fill up once again.
“Yes, me and Harry, now listen,” Draco looked around before dragging Ron closer to him, “you should’ve seen him, Ron. The way he responded to me talking about having him take more…”
Harry bit his tongue and readied his wand, “You wish. Count it.”
Harry granted it to him after a moment of watching him struggle to get into a somewhat comfortable position, “you’re going to suck me off while Ron opens you up.”
“Didn’t even have to scold you,” Harry smiled, “good boy.”
“That feel good, pet?” Harry asked rhetorically, speeding up and slowing down, “like it when I get you off with my hand, hmm? As much as I like this, I’d be pleased to have you on my tongue or cock as well… Perhaps both.”
Harry obliged, slipping in another finger and keeping his pace. He crooked them, finding Draco’s prostate easily and hitting it over and over.
“Come here,” Harry dismissed him, patting his lap, “sit on my lap.”
“Most definitely,” Harry agrees, taking two cups down from the cupboard without particularly realizing it.
"Mhm."
"First, I've dreamt about having you like this for months. Second, I want to mark you up, so every single time you see those pretty dark marks you'll feel me against your skin. Third," Draco paused, tugging Harry's earlobe between his teeth before continuing, "I don't want to take you, right here and right now, up against this wall."
He took his fingers out, biting his lip as Harry let out a breathy whine, his hole clenching around nothing. He covered his cock with lube as an extra measure before placing his tip at the other boy’s entrance.
Neither of them spoke as Draco went to get cleaned up, bringing back the washcloth to soothe Harry as well.
"Just like that," Draco praised, "make the prettiest sounds for me,"
Draco blushed but tried to hide it, “why wouldn’t you?”
“Merlin,” Ron breathed as he felt Draco around his finger, “can’t believe with the way you two go at it that he’s still so tight.”
“That settles it.” McGonagall said dryly, staring down at Harry’s body. “You’re Potter’s intended.”
“Shhhh, my mate.” Harry cooed, reverence held in every syllable. “I’ll take care of you.” He promised, dipping his head to start undoing the blonde’s pants before he frowned, ears perking up. There it was again, a hurried knocking coming from their front door.
"Who's that from?" Ron asked curiously, picking the package up and looking at it closely.
Harry let out a soft, whispering laugh, closing his eyes and breathing deeply. “As you wish, mate of mine.”
, he thought vaguely.
Draco’s eyes widened as he gaped at Dumbledore for a few moments. “I…really?” he asked before his eyes narrowed. “How do you know?”
“Go!” Draco shouted, sliding around to Harry’s front so the vampire would focus on him instead of Blaise. Not needing telling twice, the other Slytherin scurried out the door. Sighing in relief now that his friend was safe, Draco looked up at Harry and felt his blood freeze in his veins. Harry looked angry…no, he looked more than angry. He looked downright pissed. “Harry…” Draco started, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation, but Harry cut him off.
“Don’t call me darling.” Draco croaked, trembling slightly in fear and terror. “I-I’m not your d-darling. Just t-take my blood so I can go.”
Harry’s mate. Whether I like it or not.”
For a few moments Harry could only stare at Draco’s back, his mind warring furiously as he tried to decide how best to respond. The truth, or what the blonde wanted to hear? “I…” Harry started, swallowing hard. “Yes.” He finally, reluctantly admitted. “Eventually.”
He was heading down the corridor, steps seeming much louder than they actually were as his heart was pounding in his chest; he always did hate sneaking out. He could see the large doors, almost reach out and touch them, and was about to before something yanked him back and into an empty room.
“To see if you’re right, or if you’re just hearing things.”
Harry huffed. If Ron didn’t show up in the next thirty seconds he was sure he would kill Draco rather than fuck him. He wasn’t one-hundred percent certain he wouldn’t end up doing both. Luckily for Draco, Ron was coming in a moment later.
Draco nodded and set himself down, slowly lowering himself on Harry’s cock. Somehow, at this angle, he felt even bigger and Draco felt even more full. He stopped once he was sat flush against Harry’s thighs.
“Really doesn’t even need two. He’s still a bit stretched from last night. Tight as ever, though.”
Ron arched an eyebrow at that, “try me.”
“No hiding, darling. Wanna hear all the pretty sounds you make for us.” Draco chastised, though playfully as he switched to the other nipple.
“S-seven,” Draco stuttered slightly, begging himself mentally to not get hard while Harry Fucking Potter was spanking him. He would have to die, he thought, just find the nearest bridge and call it a day.
Oh, yeah. His wand. Draco picked it up and cleared his throat.
“Yeah?”
Harry sighs. “No, but I’m not surprised. Anyway, Teddy was asking....” The words already taste horrible. Despite that, Harry makes himself deliver more of them: “He was asking for you. Just a minute ago.”
“It’s stupid,” Harry said, hiking his own t-shirt up to his armpits, his hips matching Malfoy’s stroke. “You look—”
“Fine, we’ve talked enough,” he said, looking damned pleased with himself. Draco forced his hips into immobility; he was pleased as well, but that didn’t mean Potter got to be
“No,” she said stubbornly. “I didn’t know you were fucking him when I agreed to help.”
not understand?”
“Pfft.” Harry shrugged and propped himself on the corner of a dining table. He shot back off. “What the hell?”
Draco stopped on the step below him, blocked by Harry’s body from proceeding further. Harry swallowed and said, “What was that about? The ring, the scroll. The— act? Why—?” Draco gripped the front of his shirt and moved him, taking the landing. He continued to propel Harry backwards, and Harry breathlessly got out, “I want an explanation,” just before his shoulders were pressed to a wall.
“No, I—” Draco says. The last thing he wants is for this to turn into another argument. “I know you’re not. I only meant that because she didn’t give clear instruction, Granger must have thought…”
Nearly every day since, Draco has spent at least a few moments trying to figure out why that was what came out. He could have said,
“Probably won’t work out well for you if you compare me to a child, Potter,” Draco warns, but that tiny groove appears at the corner of his mouth again. Harry smiles.
at a random door, then threw the glove into an open window as we ran. If they come this way, it’ll occupy them, I think.”
And then Malfoy slips his hand from Harry’s hip to his belly — still standing behind him, practically
Malfoy waved him off. “It’s not a sex shop,” he said, then promptly ventured down an aisle, his eyes lit on a shelf of dildos that were apparently charmed to either vibrate or mimic ejaculating, and in a few cases, both. He picked up a box, studying the back of it. “Well, it’s not
“Again?” Harry snorted, the scratchy, echoing strains of music filling the studio. He wanted to loathe her as much as he had only a few seconds ago, but rather than antagonising him further as she obviously meant to, the tone of her threat softened something inside him. “We’re adults now, Parkinson.”
“Right.” Harry shook. “Zabini.”
“And again I say, so?” Draco swiped away a strand of hair sticking to his forehead, off balance. The timer still had another twenty minutes on it and he couldn’t really leave, so he moved his robes and jumper from the stool they were resting on and sat, crossing his arms over his chest. Potter didn’t say anything and Draco huffed. “Who’s Julia?”
Harry could sense Draco’s magic swirling around him as he spoke; it intensified after the crack of Apparition sounded.
and rolled over to face Harry, a tug of the blankets Harry was lying on top of, and said, simply, “I fell, when I was four.”
The punch glances off Harry’s chin, but Draco puts enough weight behind it to snap Harry’s head to the side. Blasted through with relief, and rage, and a fear that goes so deep his bones hurt from it, Harry ducks Draco’s second swing and clamps his hands around Draco’s wrists. He drives Draco back against the same tree where Harry’d been caught only moments ago, and pins him in place as Draco thrashes.
“Or you’ll
,” Harry says doubtfully, snorting when Draco shoves him. He glances up to find Draco grinning, an easy, uncomplicated sort of smile that Harry returns without thinking and then has to look away from. He clears his throat and points to a small pile-up visible in the distance, aided by the crest of the sun above the horizon. “An accident.”
Breathing, Harry lets the weight settle over his shoulders, an ugly blanket, but one well-worn. “Yeah. Yeah, okay.”
— an opportunity Harry was no longer inclined to give them. Narcissa settled her hands in her lap and turned a reserved smile on Harry, blue eyes shrewd. “If you’re sure your elf can accommodate a last minute addition.”
Harry stopped. He Summoned his glasses from the sofa and shoved them on, vision clearing. Malfoy was in pyjamas, tatty, green-flanneled things that were nearly worn through and hung, overlarge, on his frame, and his hair was rumpled flat on the left side of his head and sticking straight up on the right, matching, almost perfectly, the pillow crease he sported on that cheek. He looked frankly mad, and maddened, and Harry gulped back a laugh before it got him killed. He held up both hands, placatingly.
,” Hermione says again, an edge of frustration bleeding through the line. “Maybe. Maybe. But even apart from that, we could use him for…” She huffs, voice turning hard. “For leverage. Narcissa kept quiet for weeks; I only got her talking an hour ago. Harry… there’s reason to believe it’s crucial you bring him here, but you have to stay— guarded. The Malfoys, well. They’ve never been innocent, have they? And I don’t want you getting hurt for him. I know what your instincts will probably tell you in the moment, but you’re worth so much more to me, to everyone here. You.. We all may need to make some hard choices, do some difficult things.”
“Oh.” Harry had never even heard of violet-honey apples, but the world jolted around him with that same, disconcerting, sideways
The glass cracks, louder. Malfoy glances back, then looks at Harry. “What?”
Worried, Harry went downstairs. He recognised Hermione’s voice in the study, spiking with upset, lowering in a bid for calm. Then a lower tenor, a cautioning voice, and similar voice, overlapping: Ron and Bill. He vaguely remembered making plans with them for this week but was fairly certain they hadn't specified a day. Harry stopped by the cracked doors and listened as Hermione interrupted them.
Harry says no, or tries to, but the word won’t come out. He doesn’t like that one. Has never been good at it. Malfoy gives his wrist a little shake.
He twisted his napkin ‘round his fingers, a nervous gesture. But his jaw was tight, and he seemed affronted by Harry’s prolonged silence. In truth, Harry wasn’t sure he oughtn’t be; teaching etiquette sounded like such a… a self-indulgent job to take on. Making sure that kids were well dressed and knew their forks, or wouldn’t embarrass their parents at posh luncheons. Teaching them to be seen and not heard.
“There might be some shame in it,” Harry said, rattled. “I really should go now.” Before he did something he’d regret. Probably.
countermand mine, now tell me what the bloody fuck
“Wow, you’re just going to compete with me over everything, aren’t you?”
He straightened his clothes with brisk efficiency, then huffed and looked pointedly down at the rumpled state of his robes. Harry rolled his eyes despite the warm, glowing bubble expanding in his chest, and smoothed out the wrinkled fabric. Draco gave him a definitive nod, then started for the door — where he paused.
Harry. No, I mean it,” she insisted when he snorted. “When you’re interested in something, you learn it so quickly. You’ve simply got caught in your own head, and so you don't execute… Or perhaps you forget…"
“I’d gathered as much what with the snow you’re leaving to melt all over our floor.” Draco forced a smile, stomach churning. “Have fun?”
Draco’s never called it that, before. Not once in fourteen years.
he’d said, with such heavy inflection there was no way Draco could pretend to not know what he meant. He’d even laughed when Draco sarcastically thanked him for the mental image and muttered,
Draco huffed — a light, annoyed sound. “You’ve always been, and I’ve always had to live with knowing it. Hero, hero, hero, like a child’s song in my head. What was so heroic about you? Why were you so special? Your face, that scar? Green eyes? A lot of people have green eyes. Yours weren’t even special enough to see how special I was.” His unpretentious posture was a lie; it was the bleak tension in the cords of his neck that told the truth. Draco frowned. “And then you were my hero, too. I couldn’t even look at you at my trial. I didn’t mean to, when I got released. Those stupid, near-sighted green eyes. But you’d come back for me through Fiendfyre on a stick of kindling disguised as a broom. I
“What—” Harry cursed, arm tangling in the sleeve of his robe. “What does that mean?”
“You let me take off my
He braces himself against the unwieldy force of what Harry’s feeling, and pushes the words out. “What, precisely, happened to Father?”
He slips the list under the door and waits, hands pressed to the wood. Stomach flipping, and heart, too.
“You are such a bastard,” Potter said. The insult sounded— strange. Light. I exhaled and opened my eyes to see Potter grinning. He swiped his thumb over my cockhead, spreading the moisture he found there, tingles racing up my shaft, then lifted his chin and tugged on my earlobe with his teeth. “Want to hate me in your bed for awhile?”
“Are you sure about that?” Pansy asked.
“Yes,” Narcissa says with a nod. “And Lucius, for me.” She tuts at Granger’s blank look of disbelief. “You think happy marriages only exist for the pure of heart? That the depth of my loss could not possibly match or surpass yours?”
“Try,” Harry urged, heart in his throat. His gaze fell to Draco’s mouth, slender lips immobile but no longer with that cruel slant. Draco cleared his throat and held out his hand, palm up, and Harry pulled his from his pockets.
Harry gurgled an astonished laugh. “Probably better than thestral shit. I’ve been applying a salve to the hives — and Dittany, just in case of scarring. They’ll likely scab, but it won’t take long for those to fall off.”
“No, I should keep watch,” Potter says remotely. “And you for me, just in case.” His eyes flick over Draco’s torso; an assessment. “You swim?”
The spinning mobile comes to an abrupt stop, caught under the firm trap from Harry’s index finger. Draco winces; there are probably thousands of ways he could have delivered that differently. Staring at the mobile, Harry's jaw flexes, his lips pressed white.
The spell he cast didn’t decrease Harry’s pain much but swamped him with a soothing sort of exhaustion, and Harry sighed. Through lowered lashes, he watched the spiky set of Draco’s shoulders settle.
“I wondered if you’d think so.”
of Potter’s feet had been very clean. Pale and damp and bony, lacking any of the dark hair that had been on his legs, or the smattering of it he had in the middle of his chest, or the thin line of it that slipped from his almost-flat belly-button to…
“Ngghpphmm,” Harry got out. At the sound of her light laugh, he shut his gaping mouth with a click and finally looked back just in time to see her walking away. Tugging on the high collar of his robes — it suddenly felt as tight as the crotch of his trousers — Harry took a deep breath and stepped from his hiding spot.
“I put my actions in the bathroom to rest a long time ago,” he admits, risking a glance at Draco to see if he’s upset by that. Draco merely nods, face inscrutable, and Harry says, “But you knowing that I have that— inside me. It scares you. That I might hurt you when you’re not expecting it.”
Rose allows herself to be guided off the bed. Once she's out of range, Hermione's magic slams through her again, a burning reminder. She keeps her arm at her side as Rose trudges over to her, face downcast, and proceeds to lean against her hip. One of her little arms comes up to curl tight around Hermione's waist.
“Well, I distinctly remember not telling you to fuck off when you showed up,” Malfoy said. His lips curved in a more subtle version of the smile he’d given the hostess, reserved but— appealing. Striking. Harry blinked a few more times and inhaled sharply when Malfoy decided to lean toward him, across the table. “Might even hold off on my weekly virgin sacrifice out of consideration for your job — depending on what you want, of course.”
on them,” Malfoy says, only a small stutter in the last syllable of the spell giving away his unease. “The first night.”
“For me,” Harry put in, a burbling laugh breaking out of his throat when Draco flicked him an annoyed glance. Harry shrugged and stage-whispered to him, “You could try to make it sound a
Blinking to clear his vision, Harry makes himself meet Malfoy’s gaze. Malfoy stares at him apprehensively, and Harry takes a couple of deep breaths. Unsensible to the last, his cock starts to stiffen again as they look at each other. Harry has the urge to grab him, to shake him, to push him down where he sits and climb atop him. He remembers that desire, those last moments thinking of Ginny’s mouth and hair, her blazing look and the comfort he might have liked taking in her body, right before that final curse Voldemort had landed on him. Anything not to be in the moment he'd been in.
Harry wants to howl at that. What right did they have to interfere? To
“It means something,” Harry says. Malfoy’s mouth tightens and Harry continues, “It can mean whatever you like, but it doesn’t mean nothing.”
He activated the Snitch and opened his palm, its wings unfurling and lifting it up. Potter pulled next to him, mouth open like he was about to speak, but then the Snitch streaked up toward the heavy white sky with a flash of gold and Potter shut his mouth with a click. He threw Draco a frustrated look — and angled his handle up, pressing his shoulders forward. In one smooth, practised motion, he shot after the Snitch.
, your heat transferring into his skin, the scent of him blanketing you. He pushes you face down onto a cot, jerks your trousers and pants down past your hips. Panting, you spread your legs as best you can. Getting into position, Harry fumbles, the swollen, round head of his cock coasting off your sopping hole. With a grunt, he aligns. He pushes in, hard and steady, one hand tight on the nape of your neck.
“Now,” the solicitor said, clearing his throat. Twice. “If you will stand and join hands, please?”
“I don’t know about that,” Harry murmured — grinning when Draco rolled his eyes and blushed.
“Harry,” Bill said, low and quiet. A large hand came to settle on his shoulder and applied pressure, as if Bill knew how close Harry was to losing control. “It doesn’t work like that. You can’t.”
Harry frowns, keeping his sore hand tight to his aching side. “Not good, but I’ve—” he breathes through another wave of pain “—had worse.” Draco stops Harry’s progress with a firm hand to his arm, and Harry catches his gaze. “Really,” he says, nodding steadily. “Right now we need to get somewhere less exposed.”
“What?”
“I don’t want to know.” Draco frowned at the ceiling when her nails dug into his side. “What’d he ask?”
“Oh.”
Harry doesn’t argue, dry-swallowing the pills and then settling back to watch Malfoy efficiently Shrink and pack the remainder of their things. He does it with short, economic movements, his magic carelessly graceful, expression as bland as Molly’s when she’s setting her kitchen to rights after a meal. The comparison shoots a pang of fear through Harry; he doesn’t even know if she’s alive.
Harry slipped in his third and final finger, eyes hooded as he pumped them steadily in and out of the moaning boy. When he was sure Draco was stretched properly he removed his fingers, much to Draco’s displeasure.
“Oh, fuck, Draco!”
Harry came first, fucking himself through it as he came in thick, white strips across his and Draco’s stomachs. Ron followed soon after, leaning forward and laying his head on Harry’s back as he came inside Draco. Draco groaned as Ron pulled out of him, feeling the way his cum ran down his thighs.
Draco dropped his head into the crook of Harry’s neck, slowly picking himself up and fucking himself down. Harry bit his lip as Draco repeated the action.
When Draco did nothing but eye him back, Harry sighed, “Alright, I’ll bite. What brings you over to my desk?” He asked sarcastically.
Harry scooted closer, finally able to hear what the two of them were going on about. He listened quietly to their conversation, careful to not be suspicious.
“I’m going to fuck you,” Draco said simply, grinding softly into the other boy.
“Atta boy,” Draco sounded almost proud, “One… Two… Three!”
Draco knew when he had one finger inside because Harry was panting into his mouth. He smirked against Potter’s lips, knowing he probably didn’t even need prep.
“I want us to do it,” Draco said, softly.
Harry used a spell to quickly open and close the classroom window as the two boys watched the owl fly out of it with the snake in its possession still.
“Please, I want you,” Draco whined.
He could feel the smirk against his backside as Harry sunk his teeth into him, electing a high-pitched yelp from him. He began to feel his panic rising once again as he was spread open, Harry’s warm breath ghosting over his hole.
He was lost. Because as Draco was everywhere,  Ron was nowhere. He would feel featherlight touches caress what skin was already exposed, but then they’d be gone, never exposing more.
Harry took a minute before moving off of him, but as soon as he did he was all over him once again. This time though it was less rough as he planted kisses on Draco’s cheeks, forehead, and finally his lips. He kissed Draco breathless as Ron cast a cleaning spell. Once they were clean Ron joined them, letting Draco give him a nod of approval before smothering him in kisses as well.
It was two days later and Harry had nearly forgotten the incident. But what’s better than remembering a memory? Replacing it with a more prominent one.
“You always have some plan stirring in that head of yours,”
"A game, and then you're free to go."
Harry thought about it for a moment before he got an idea. It was an awful idea, really, and surely Draco wouldn’t go for it. He wasn’t exactly sure why he got the idea. Maybe he wanted to embarrass Malfoy, or maybe he just wanted to watch him squirm, or maybe both.
That was never the case, and then Ron was left to hear about the proper pronunciation of LeviOsa. (Kill me, he’d ask over his shoulder to no one, kill me.) Of course, he and Hermione had both reminded Harry what had happened last time he found a mysterious journal. He nodded and replied, “of course, how could I forget? But this is sixth year, we aren’t children anymore.”
“No?” Harry asked, changing his angle and hitting Draco’s prostate, making the other boy yell out and squirm around, “Looks like someone’s not having such a bad time after all,” Harry said as he watched the way Draco’s own cock began to fill up, “such a fucking slut you are.”
Draco’s eyes widened at being called a good boy. Why on earth was that so hot? It must have been because just as Harry landed strike seven, his cock gave an interested twitch before beginning to respond.
“No reason. You didn’t stop by, didn’t send an owl, anything! Three years we spent together and then one day you don’t come home. You never broke up with me. You didn’t even say goodbye, and you want to talk about me being cold? Well, I’m so sorry, am I hurting your feelings, princess?”
Draco blushed, “what are you going to do?”
Draco smiled and ran his fingers through the smaller boy’s hair. He gave him a gentle kiss as he moved inside him for the first time. Harry let out a small moan into his mouth, causing Draco to smirk as he swallowed it eagerly.
The door closed quietly as an outstretched wand pointed towards it. There was the definite sound of a lock clicking as Harry quickly shrugged off his cloak. He looked behind him at what-- who had dragged him into the room. His jaw locked as he saw the figure behind him, wearing a smirk.
Harry felt something light inside him as he grabbed Draco’s ass and lifted him just enough so that he could plow into him from beneath.
“That’s it,” Ron spoke, gripping onto Harry’s slim hips and pulling him back into him on every thrust, “sound so sexy when you moan for us.”
“This is a joke…” Harry said, but he knew it wasn’t. Judging by the way Draco was nipping at his neck and Ron was pulling off his jeans it most certainly was not a joke.
“Why?”
His best friend was too engrossed in a stack of potion books to notice the two other men in the room. Once again, he was jealous that this was not new to Draco and watched with intent as Draco reached forward and took the book Harry was reading from his hands.
Draco’s eyes widened as Harry whispered something into the air and his hands were then bound. Unamusingly (to Draco) with emerald green silk, the same as his own curtains. He tugged on his binds, only stopping when he felt Harry’s weight moving down his body.
Draco was quick to place his cock where Ron’s had just moved from. He rubbed it over Harry’s hole, listening as Harry gave a tired whine.
Draco smiled solemnly, gripping Potter's hips and bringing them towards his own. Harry gasped as his back arched off the wall, his hips meeting Malfoy's as the latter leaned in to whisper in his ear.
Draco merely rolled his eyes, pushed himself off the desk with a huff, and made his way to the front of the room. He knocked on the biggest desk in the room, once on the top left side and twice in the middle. He knocked once more, a bit too loudly for Harry’s liking, and the desktop popped open.
Draco rolled his eyes and he crawled into Harry’s outstretched arms, “you know I only put up with you because you’re great in bed, right?”
He groaned into Harry’s skin, tears freely flowing now as pleasure built in his stomach. He was moaning and sobbing as his cock was an angry red against his stomach.
Draco gave him a look of ‘yeah, right.' before making his way over and cradling Harry’s face.
Now that we’re all caught up, let’s go to the present. For Draco’s sake we should probably skip this part, but what’s the fun in that?
Slowly Draco nodded, his stomach clenching as he realized what would happen now. Now he would leave, never to see Harry again, and that space in his chest that now was filled with a comforting warmth would once again be cold and empty. “Y-yeah. It-it was great.” He nodded, shoving aside the nauseous feeling churning in his stomach. “You’re a great shag. I…I’ll just be going, sorry I fell asleep.” He mumbled, sitting up and making to leave the bed.
Liam slowly nodded, looking at Harry and opening himself up willingly for the Vampire. “I know. Take what you need, Harry.” He swallowed hard. “I know you’ll make it good.”
Draco was staring with an intense ferocity at Harry, mentally willing the brunette to eat the chocolate.
That admittance made Draco flush with guilt and he quickly extracted himself from Harry’s embrace. “That…that’s great, Potter.” He murmured. “Now you…you should drink so I can go to sleep.” He said, offering Harry his hand and trying not to wince at the look that crossed the vampire’s face.
Leaning forwards, Hermione gasped softly as she studied the symbol of Harry’s claim. “You were never marked by You-Know-Who?” she asked after several moments of thoughtful silence.
Slowly Harry sat up, looking through the darkness to the figure who stood just inside the doorway. He remained silent, letting his magic reach out and sense what was around him. He already knew who the figure was; he could feel the Dark power radiating off of him.
“When Harry turned in the Great Hall his eyes locked onto you, Mr. Malfoy. There is no doubt in any of the professors’ minds that had we not Stunned Mr. Potter when we did, he would have attacked you, Draco, and drank your blood.” Dumbledore explained simply.
Harry awoke in the early dawn with a gigantic smile on his face. Now many people would wonder why it is that the Boy-Who-Will-Most-Likely-Die-In-The-Next-chapter would have reason to smile on this sunny morning, and rightly so. Well the reason for Mr. Potter's happiness will not be stated here in this very sentence, so you best read on in order to solve this most intriguing of mysteries.
me. You drink my blood, that’s it! It doesn’t mean I can’t kiss Blaise or hang out with other blokes!”
Sadly Draco was snapped out of his Harry induced trance and looked at the Gryffindor curiously. "Were you...checking me out?" he asked.
“Well?” Harry practically growled, crossing his arms over his chest and leveling a cold glare at the blonde. “What are you playing at?”
Forever and faithfully yours,
“I’ve been wanting this for so long.” Harry murmured, looking down at Draco with adoration clear on his face. “Ever since I saw you in those magazines I’ve wanted to touch you, to taste you. Will you give me that?” he asked, surprising himself by the question. He’d never asked his prey before if they would let him feed, he just did. Then again, he’d never known the others, or wanted them as much as he wanted Draco.
"Merry Christmas, Harry!" the ginger said happily, bouncing up and down on Harry's knees. "Look, you've got PRESENTS!" he squealed happily, tossing Harry the first box on the top of the pile.
Draco didn’t need telling twice and the moment he got out from under Harry he sprinted as best he could to the door, hurtling through it and closing it tight behind him. He leaned against it as dizziness from blood loss threatened to overwhelm him and black spots danced across his vision. Moments later there was a heavy thud and the sounds of snarling as Harry threw himself at the door, trying to get to Draco.
“Mmm, so you’re awake.” A voice murmured close to his ear and Draco nearly jumped, rolling over with a groan, his body protesting the sudden movement, to look at the dark haired man lying beside him.
“They’re worried about you.” Draco explained, turning his back to Harry as he stripped and dressed for bed. “They’d like to see you some time soon, make sure you’re alright.”
“What if I hurt someone?” Harry asked nervously, toying with the fraying hem of his shirt. “How do they know I won’t drain someone dry?”
There were a few long moments of silence as Draco thought over what Harry had said as he grabbed his wand and cast a cleaning charm on his pants. Potter might not have actually touched his skin, but he still felt rather violated that the vampire had seen him in his most intimate, vulnerable state. Finally Draco sighed, rubbing his eyes. He didn’t have enough energy to deal with this vampire ordeal anymore. All he wanted to do was go back to his normal life and forget about the monster that thought he was his mate. Forget about the feeling and sight of his blood passing between the other boy’s lips.
Harry dropped into the chair across from Draco before he looked over at his mate skeptically. “And why, pray tell me, was it necessary to spend a fortune on me?”
Harry blinked. "No! Of course not! Don't be ridiculous, Malfoy!" he said quickly, diffusing the situation by placing his hands over Draco's hips. "You want to go to the feast, right?"
“Keep telling yourself that, mate.” Harry answered with a sly grin, snickering softly. Draco could almost call himself happy to see the vampire had regained some of his color and the shaking through his body had stopped.
“Yes, because that’s all you really cared about with Potter: shagging.” Blaise snorted with an easy roll of his eyes, gently rubbing Draco’s back. “You know it was more than that. You liked the specky git, though Merlin knows why.” He smiled down at his best friend. “Hell, you even stopped messing around with me just to make him happy. You wouldn’t do that for just anyone.” He pointed out wisely.
Within Harry the Incubus slept, its battle with the vampire the previous night leaving it weak and tired. The vampire within Harry purred in contentment, pleased to finally sate himself with the blood he needed and to have his mate beside him.
“That should be enough.” The vampire murmured, licking his lips. “Will you come back tomorrow?” he asked softly, looking up at Draco nervously.
Harry arched an eyebrow and smirked, stopping just outside the mistletoe. "Is that so? You seem to be having some trouble there, Malfoy." he smirked.
“Yes.” Draco nodded with a small smile, picking up his trunk again. As he turned to follow Narcissa he caught a flash of dark hair and striking emerald eyes. Draco froze in his tracks, starring as Harry joined the Weasley family, plus Remus and Tonks, laughing brightly at something one of the twins had said. As if he could feel Draco’s eyes on him, Harry turned, locking gazes with the blonde.
For a moment Draco’s breath stopped before he let out a breathy moan, eyes falling closed.
I did.” He murmured, hand leaving Draco’s throat entirely to grip Draco’s hips. “I’ve been watching you, you know.” Harry purred throatily, head dipping to nuzzle at Draco’s neck, making the blonde stiffen. “You take so many men into your bed…but the never stay. Why is that? Are you…waiting for someone?”
The Vampire nodded and shifted closer so he could reach Draco’s hand, not even noticing as the blankets slipped precariously low on his hips. He ran his lips lightly over Draco’s skin as his fangs descended. Moments later he sank his teeth into the tender flesh of Draco’s wrist.
So I lied. This is the final chapter BUT there's an epilogue I don't remember writing.
“I’m sorry.” Harry murmured as he pulled back, licking his tongue across the wound he had made. “But…I need more.”
The Headmaster nodded. “Your knowledge is true, if incomplete. You see, Mr. Malfoy, a Vampire will have an…intended. I would use the word mate, except what a Vampire feels towards its intended will not be mutual, unlike the mating of Veelas. A Vampire’s bond with their intended is completely blood driven. They must drink their intended’s blood or they may die. Do you understand me, Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco swallowed again, shuddering at the very idea of what the Vampire was talking about. Prey…was he Harry’s prey? Was Potter going to use him, drink from him, and then toss away his empty corpse? The idea made Draco sick. “What…what are you going to do to me?” he whispered, all of his Malfoy training not even enough to keep the fear from his voice.
Draco laughed. "You never should have trusted that note, Potter. Especially not after the part about yourself, strawberries, and whipped cream. I was going to go into detail, you see, but then I thought that Saint Potter would be too innocent for words such as those." he said with a leer.
"You haven't eaten the chocolate DAMMIT!" a voice erupted from the darkness. "You do have them with you don't you?"
“What makes you think he’s up to something?” Ron asked curiously before taking another large mouthful of his pot pie.
"Malfoy you little fucker! You're the last one I'd want to bugger!" Harry growled, eyes blazing with anger. "Dang! Why can't I stop rhyming!" he growled. "It's terribly annoying and messing with my timing."
In his mind Draco was panicking, but he made sure his exterior stayed cool and collected. "Actually, no. That doesn't sound familiar." he forced a drawl from his lips. "Perhaps it was from some other conniving Slytherin."
Supposed worst enemy. Draco’s brain supplied helpfully, but he brushed the little voice off. Supposed enemy or not, he most certainly should not be attracted to Harry bloody Potter. Not even if the Gryffindor had developed rather nice muscles and had a very handsome face and sometimes was just downright
“Yeah.” Harry nodded with a soft sigh. “I can, but I think I’m just going to take them and get it over with. I’ll have to go into further Auror training anyway, there’s no point staying at Hogwarts for an extra year.”
try to seduce anyone but you, my love.”
The smirk on Harry's lips widened and he pulled Draco flush against him. "I got a present this morning...Malfoy." he whispered, his breath hot against Draco's ear. "A stone box with three vials. Sound familiar?"
Inspecting the different vials, Harry sighed. He couldn't differentiate any of them as potions he knew. "Which do you think I should take?" he asked Ron.
"The golden one." Harry answered calmly, still smirking.
“Harry.” The blonde whispered again, and then soft lips were against his own, he was kissing Harry Potter, and Draco Malfoy’s world descended into bliss.
Draco cocked an eyebrow at him. "You look fine." Harry just shrugged, not really knowing why in the world he had said that.
The vampire growled low in his throat at being interrupted, but the sound secede the moment Draco pressed a hand to his chest. Harry dipped his dead down in confusion. “Yes, mate?”
Mr. Potter had just taken the first bite of his Mickey Mouse Waffle when the post arrived, carrying with it multiple packages all brightly wrapped in various shades of a garish pink. A ferocious looking black owl swooped down and sat in front of Harry, carrying with it a heart-shaped package as well as a note. After delivering its items the owl hooted and flew off out of the Great Hall.
“Why do you think he decided to infect Harry with Dark creatures instead of just poisoning him?”
“I think we need to talk in private.” Draco suggested calmly, nodding to the eyes on them as he snagged a cookie from their table. “Come on, then.” He smirked, swaggering slightly as he exited the Great Hall, two perplexed Gryffindors following a distance behind them. The Slytherin led them to a small courtyard, sitting down on a bench and gesturing for them to sit across the path from him. “Now, ask away.”
“Of course.” Harry quickly nodded, getting out of bed and helping Draco up. He led the blonde to the door, smiling sadly at him. “I’m sorry again for what happened. It will never happen again, if…if I see you again.” He finished quickly, swallowing hard as he slammed the door closed behind Draco and slunk back into the darkened corners of his lair.
Draco took a deep breath. "Not yet. But I will. And I know you'll be there. Ok? Will you be there when I come?"
He whimpered quietly, fingers twitching again in Draco's palm. "Would you?"
Seamus whistled, winking at Draco, impressed. “You’ll do well, Malfoy. And don’t worry about Harry. You two will see each other again, it’s not over.” He finished cryptically before giving Draco a jaunty wave and pulling Blaise into the swarming crowd of parents and students. Within moments they were gone.
At the same time Draco was missing the Vampire, missing him so much it
“Mmm, I didn’t think you’d come back.” Harry murmured, his voice reverberating and low. He nuzzled Draco’s neck and inhaled, moaning softly at the scent of Draco’s blood racing through his veins. “You smell so good.” He murmured, gently pulling Draco over to the armchairs by the fire.
In the dungeons deep below Malfoy Manor, Harry groaned, opening his eyes as he heard a noise beside him, and immediately blinking in the dim light of his cell. Last he remembered he had been fighting with Draco Malfoy on the Quidditch Pitch, not another soul in sight, and now here he was. He sat up, blinking as the face of a smiling house elf came into focus next to him.
“Oh…so much has happened in your absence, Dray.” Blaise smirked widely, settling back in the couch so that Draco’s head was resting on his chest, his fingers still stroking lightly through his hair. “Let’s see… Theo and Daphne have gotten together. Apparently Pansy and Goyle may have something going on, though Pansy claims it’s just physical. We all know the truth, though. You can see it when they look at each other, it’s nauseating how in love they are.” He paused, thinking over what else Draco needed to know now, before he could hear it from other sources.
"I'll get you cherries next year I promise!"
Draco shook his head. “Potter, you feeding from me was possibly the most erotic thing I’ve ever experienced. I’ve never come so hard in my life. The only requirement is that you continue feeding from me and never seduce another bloke into your bed, okay?
Harry quickly nodded. “Of course, Draco.” He agreed. There were a few long moments of silence as the pair sat in front of the quietly crackling fire. Then a smirk spread across Harry’s lips and he glanced over at Draco. “You sound like you care about what happens to me, mate of mine.” He teased gently.
lost something of great importance to him. Draco. Ron glanced over to the Slytherin table and bit his lip as he studied the other boy. That was something else Ron wasn’t so sure about. Yes, he still didn’t like the blonde git, but there were times, like when he caught the heartbroken, defeated look in Draco’s eyes whenever he caught sight of Harry, when Ron wondered if things would be better off if Harry hadn’t forgotten. There was a part of him that panged with sympathy for the Slytherin, knowing just how hard it would be if Hermione suddenly stopped loving him.
For a few moments the pair stayed that way; Harry panting as he tried not to collapse into post-orgasmic bliss, and Draco happily drinking him down and suckling on the head of Harry’s cock. Finally Draco pulled away, licking his lips as he stood and smirked at Harry. “Good?”
—that he could have him? Was he really willing to give his body and blood over to the Boy Who Lived?
With a breath Draco relaxed, his body visibly stopping its fight against Draco’s will as he made his decision. Harry could have him. All of him.
For a few moments Draco just gaped at Harry, trying his best to wrap his head around the words coming from the vampires mouth. Harry…Harry didn’t want him to leave? He wanted him to stay? So did that mean… Draco cleared his throat and nodded. “Yeah, it was…spectacular.” He admitted, ducking his head a bit. “So none of your other, erm, prey have passed out before?” he asked, unable to help feeling weak at the thought. Would Harry even want someone who passed out after sex?
He opened the lid of the box to reveal three small vials filled with different substances and a tiny note attached.
Harry had been drinking from Draco’s throat for weeks now and yet still, every time it left Draco surprised at how good it felt, how little it hurt. And Draco found himself almost missing the sensation of feeding every time Harry finished and pulled away, licking the wound. It left Draco wanting more, already craving the next day then Harry would need to feed again.
In response the vampire hummed, letting even more of the Incubus’s powers leak through his barriers and reach Draco. He gave Draco’s cock one last tug and the blonde’s body seared with pleasure, his hips arching impossibly as he came, covering Harry’s chest with droplets of white that ran down Harry’s body with the spray of the shower only to be dragged down the swirling drain.
Draco chuckled at that, shaking his head a little. “I never knew Gryffindor’s were so…possessive.” He teased.
Harry was quite glad that nobody had asked him about his gifts, after all, this year was like any other year where he didn't have anyone to give racy or romantic presents to. For Harry Potter was very much alone in life. Despite this, Harry still felt that somehow this year was going to be different somehow. Perhaps it was because Harry had finally let Collin Creevy get his way and Hogwarts now had an official Harry Potter Fan Club. Or maybe it was because Harry had finally discovered that he had hordes of fangirls who all wanted to have his babies. Either way, Harry was still excited.
Harry shifted slowly, he was kind of sore, and places that had never hurt before hurt. He closed his eyes remembering what had happened in his dream. At least it WAS just a dream; he would never be able to face the school if it somehow got out that he had spent Valentine's night with Draco-sodding-ferret-boy-Malfoy.
Lucius struggled for a few long moments, weighing the consequences of Potter dying to what would happen if word got out that it was his son’s fault that the Savior was dead. Eventually Lucius relented. “Very well, Headmaster, Draco will stay in the castle. I expect this situation to be handled quickly and quietly, and I want a daily report on Draco’s health so I know that Potter is not mistreating him.”
Neville smiled in remembrance and hastily answered, describing in great detail. "Well, I got her a necklace and a flower hair band, a container of lime-green spinach-flavored bubbles, two bracelets covered in four-leaf live clover, a bottle of beetle-juice, and a glass of bubble bath." he said excitedly. Harry nodded to show he was paying attention. Really Harry was TRYING to pay attention to his dorm mate's ramblings, but his attention was stolen by a blonde haired Slytherin who was still not wearing the school's uniform and who seemed to be up to something.
Harry shook his head, humming happily as he inhaled Draco’s scent deeply. “No, not that…” he murmured before he groaned. “You smell
A shudder ran through Draco at those words and a greater twist of guilt sprang forth inside of him. Trying not to think about what he was doing, Draco climbed up onto Harry’s lap, straddling him and presenting his neck to the vampire. “Drink.”
Dumbledore smiled. “I thought you might, Mr. Malfoy. Your professors are looking forwards to seeing you in class again tomorrow.” He said, eyes twinkling. “Have a nice morning.” And with that Dumbledore was gone, leaving Draco staring after him, a frown upon his lips.
"I see..." Draco trailed off with a sneer and a glint in his eye. He snapped his fingers and the candles around the room lit. To Harry's surprise they were in quite a large room that contained nothing but a bed draped in white and silver, what appeared to be a bathtub sunk into the floor, and a random coffee table. Harry cocked an eyebrow in confusion, not daring to speak for fear of what might come out. Draco shrugged. "I don’t know, I mean, I GUESS it IS Valentine's Day after all.
Once again Harry was running late for potions, having been thoroughly distracted by yet another round of Draco-Malfoy-Daydreaming. He turned a corner into the depths of the dungeons, taking a shortcut, heard a squawk, and ran straight into someone.
Ron nearly snorted to himself as the thought crossed his mind. Harry
"What's a new feature?" Harry asked, taking Draco's momentary distraction to look the Slytherin up and down. Man he was fit...
Harry made a face. “I may be a Dark creature, Draco, but I’m not
Harry thought for a moment trying to figure out how to respond. He decided with, "You are a fucking moron, Malfoy, but you're really damn lucky you look so hot I could jump you right here, so I won't hex you into all oblivion." Harry took a deep breath and said. "What would you like Malfoy? coffee? Tea? Me?"
Harry's eyes widened and he forced himself not to jump for joy. "We...have to kiss?" he asked slowly, his gaze already flicking down to Draco's lips.
Harry hummed happily at the Gryffindor table, thoroughly enjoying his chocolate chip waffle. He looked up just in time to see an absolutely lovely Draco Malfoy stroll into the Great Hall. A few moments later he almost gasped as Natalie, a second year Hufflepuff, barreled right into him, spilling her glass of pumpkin juice all over his robes.
Draco didn’t return to the Vampire’s lair until the next night, and even then he was practically dragged there by Dumbledore and Snape. Dumbledore had discovered Draco’s lack of cooperation when Draco had not gone to Madam Pomfrey for blood replenishing potion and when Snape had gone to take his daily sample of Harry’s blood. This time Dumbledore would personally ensure that such an incident would not happen again. The headmaster stopped outside of Harry’s room and turned to look at Draco. “Now Mr. Malfoy, I realize that you’re scared. However, you agreed to give Mr. Potter your blood and that is what you must do.”
A part of him wanted to see Harry one last time before they went their own, separate ways, but the other part of him feared the pain it would inevitably bring. When the train finally jolted to a stop at the station Draco took a deep breath, gathering his courage as he grabbed his baggage. No matter what happened he would stay strong, cool, and collected. Whether or not he saw Harry, he wouldn’t let the pain get the better of him. He wouldn’t show weakness.
"Yes. And it almost cost me an arm to get it. Literally." Draco sighed. "Can I have the other potions back please?"
Draco let out a soft breath of air, his stomach twisting a little, though in anticipation or disgust he couldn’t yet tell. This was what he had been afraid of. He was starting to like Harry, yes, but that didn’t mean he was ready to give his body over to the Gryffindor, right?
The blonde rolled his eyes, fixing his hair before he got into bed. “I can’t say no when you’re already all comfy in bed, now can I? Anyways, it’s not like you going to rip my throat out in my sleep, you’re not that much of a monster.”
“Harry…” Draco whispered back with a breathy moan, leaning up to press their lips together in a searing kiss that left them both breathless and in an even higher state of arousal than before.
The door of the hospital wing burst open and Draco jumped, sitting up to see his father striding through the doorway with Severus, Dumbledore, and McGonagall hot on his heels. “I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, but we cannot allow you to do this. Draco leaving the school at this time would be preposterous and uncalled for.” Dumbledore was saying calmly as Lucius stalked over to Draco’s side.
Harry nodded and handed the parchment over and Hermione scanned over the words. "Harry...I think this is
“Yes, My Lord.” Severus nodded and bowed again, hurrying out of the room.
"Shall we talk? Or continue flirting at a distance." was Harry's reply. Of course he had meant to say, "Of course not you pompous prat!", but obviously that sentence wasn't happening any time soon.
Draco sighed as he walked down the streets of Diagon Alley, trying his hardest to ignore the overwhelming amount of pink, hearts, and flowers that decorated nearly every storefront. It wasn’t that he hated Valentine’s Day, per se; it was just… this particular Valentine’s Day. He loved the chocolate and gifts he was typically showered with on this day, mainly from his many admirers, but this year he just didn’t feel the normal excitement when he saw the large pile of presents.
him; the Darkness leeching off of Voldemort’s skin, his very aura sickly and disgusting. For a few moments he closed his eyes, the Dark creatures reveling in the feeling as more and more the need to destroy overcame him. And for the first time, Harry gave in.
“Harry.” Harry corrected him automatically, leaning down to lick and suck at one of Draco’s nipples. The blonde hissed in pleasure, chest arching up in a search for more.
Narcissa ignoring the question, stepping farther into the room. “My son, Draco, is he alive?” she asked quietly, voice surprisingly even and calm.
"I thought so." Harry grinned mischievously and pressed close to Draco. "That was sneaky, Malfoy, very sneaky.
Later that evening Draco was doing his usual Prefect rounds before the feast when he for the third time that day found himself trapped in one spot. He swore under his breath and looked up to see another one of those blasted mistletoes.
"Hey Malfoy!" Draco jumped as a sickeningly familiar voice rang through the hall. He spun around to see none other than Harry Potter positively swaggering towards him. "Who you talking to?" The Golden Boy asked as he got closer.
Quickly Harry nodded, nuzzling Draco’s wrist gently and inhaling deeply before he finally sank his teeth into the soft heel of Draco’s hand. A soft moan slipped out from Harry as the taste of Draco’s blood splashed over his tongue. Normally it would have made Draco shudder, hearing that sound from between the plump red lips of his greatest enemy, if it weren’t for the utter bliss racing through his body at that moment in time. His heartbeat was racing, pumping hard and fast as though it meant to rip from his chest just so it could get to Harry’s lips faster. Draco almost forgot to drink his hot chocolate; so distracting was the feeling of Harry’s teeth sunk deep into his skin, sucking the liquid of Draco’s life. Then Harry stopped and Draco barely managed to keep a pitiful whimper form leaving him.
Draco didn’t register the danger lurking in the vampire’s whispered words until it was too late. In one swift motion Harry was straddling Draco’s lap, his teeth sinking into the soft flesh of the blonde’s neck. As the fangs pierced Draco’s skin he let out a scream of pain and Harry let out a moan of contentment as the ruby liquid burst into his mouth. He swallowed it down noisily, hastily; until he could feel the ever-present hunger within him slowly fade away.
Um...if you would like to see me
Unfortunately Draco had to admit that it did seem like Harry was his only chance of getting to the feast at all. And he
The sweater was dark green with a silver dragon stitched onto the front. A Weasley Sweater. Draco still remembered the day Harry received it, having sent Mrs. Weasley an owl to request one for Draco despite Christmas already having passed. At the time, the Vampire had said something about the Weasley’s being his family, and how he wanted Draco to be a part of that family. Draco wasn’t quite sure how he felt about it at the time, but on reflection he realized that being an honorary member of the Weasley family really wasn’t all that bad. At least they didn’t have a snake-loving psychopath living under their roof.
Hours passed and Draco didn’t move from his spot, trying to get himself back under control. How could he go back there? Back to that monster that used to be known as Harry Potter? Draco knew how. He’d be forced back, forced to give his blood and eventually his body to the mighty savior of the Wizarding world.
A slow smile spread across Harry’s lips at those words and he nodded once, a light dancing within his gaze as he regarded Draco. “That I can do.
“I haven’t claimed you yet.” Harry murmured, eyes raking over Draco’s bare chest with ill-concealed appreciation. Just the sight and smell of his mate made the creatures within Harry go crazy. “But if it will remind you of who you belong to, then I have no other choice.” He breathed, dipping his head down.
Hours before, Dumbledore had come to Draco’s room in the dungeons, informing him that his living space would be moved. According to the headmaster Harry had torn the room in the hospital wing apart, trying to get to his intended. They had to promise Harry close proximity to his mate in order to keep him from killing Snape when he had gone to take more blood samples. Next, to Draco’s great displeasure, the old coot had warned him of what would happen should he not cooperate. He would be sent straight to Azkaban, charged with murder, and his family’s fortune would be seized. Needless to say, Draco was not willing to let that happen. Now, however, he was regretting that decision.
- - -
They parted immediately, letting Harry press his own thigh against the tent in Draco’s trousers. Harry’s smirk only grew as on the inside he silently celebrated being right.
“Talking to you is certainly not one of those ways,” Harry said plainly, nearly chuckling at the look Draco gave him, “but I suppose since I’m stuck with you, I’ll have to be more open-minded.”
Harry shook his head, “I never wanted to, no.”
Within a second, Harry's sweater was off of him, and on the floor, Draco taking one of the pink buds in his mouth and pinching the other between two of his fingers, switching once he was satisfied that it was swollen.
“You cheated!” Draco accused in a huff of annoyance and disbelief, “you didn’t even count us off!”
Harry and Ron settled in sync; Ron fully inside of him and Harry’s bum firmly snuggled against Draco’s thighs. They looked at each other before beginning a rhythm. As Ron pulled out Harry would lift himself up, slamming himself back down when Ron entered Draco. They kept this up, watching the way Draco’s face scrunched up in nothing but pure pleasure.
Draco smirked as he pulled Ron impossibly closer to him, “I have a plan.”
Harry was pleased as he landed two more slaps in succession, listening as Draco answered a “three… four.” He landed the fifth one too soon after and managed to make Draco squirm as he hit the same spot he had previously.
Harry turned to place his cup in the sink, focusing on the tea-stained rim on the bottom rather than the sinking feeling in his chest, “I didn’t want to, but you were never fully happy with our relationship,”
He looked around discreetly, his eyes landing on none other than Draco and… Blaise? Harry’s eyebrows wrinkled as he tried to hear bits of their conversation. He cringed as Draco laughed again. He had met Blaise, been around him plenty of times, and he wasn’t as funny as Draco was making him out to be now.
“Room of requirement, midnight.”
Ron thought for a minute before he blushed, “sex.”
Draco didn’t answer, couldn’t answer when Harry was now running his thumbs over his nipples and making them perk up at the attention. They weren’t the only thing, as he cock also gave an interested twitch at the ministrations of Harry now pinching and circling them with soft, sure fingers.
“You waited for me to give up on us?”
“You’re not,” Ron disagreed, not believing the words coming from the Slytherin, “and besides, what would you want doing that with Harry anyway?”
Harry thought through all the ridiculous games Draco and his goons had come up with over the years and he didn’t recognize this one. He nodded for Draco to explain, earning a giddy smile from the pale boy.
“Please, no!” Draco cried out as Harry pistoned his hips forward, burying himself inside of Draco once again, “you’re going to split me open, please!”
“Of course you aren’t,” Draco taunted, raising his eyebrows mockingly, “Scared, Potter?”
Once he had managed to get the name past his lips he figured a hot cup of tea would do him good. He requested for Malfoy to join him in the kitchen where he promptly got out the kettle and put it on to boil. He didn’t entertain the thought of sitting with Draco at the table like old times, afraid he would show Draco exactly how he felt at the moment.
Draco shook his head as best as he could. He felt as if he was to obey Harry he would spontaneously combust, but really what choice did he have.
“I do,” Draco cut him off, mentally kicking himself for sounding so eager. He coughed, “I mean, I want to.”
Neither of the other two boys said a word as they positioned themselves the way they liked. Harry came to straddle Draco’s waist, squirting some lube onto his palm before rubbing it down Draco’s length, smirking at the way Draco shivered with the touch.
“I’m going to fuck him,” Draco announced, nearly startling Ron with the determination in his voice.
“Tell that to the tie on the floor,” Ron shot back.
Harry shook his head at this, earning a questioning look from the lust-filled eyes of the boy who should have disgusted him by this point.
“I’ll be seeing you in here tomorrow nonetheless.”
“P-please, need to cum so bad! Please, daddy!”
Harry was on fire. Sweat was pooling on his forehead and his body was already slick with it. But that’s not what he was focused on.
“You don’t think I’m letting you go after this, do you?”
Draco must have read his mind because right when he was about to warn him, he pulled out. Harry whined as his hole clenched around nothing. He pulled the hand off his mouth, about to complain when Draco spun him around.
Tears had gathered in Harry’s eyes by the time he finished and he turned back to the kettle to hide his face as he gingerly wiped them away. He wasn’t even sure he was sad, moreso numb. He took a deep breath as he pulled the kettle from the stove.
“And you think I do?”
Draco moaned loudly, letting out a string of curses as Harry repeatedly slammed into him. He watched as Draco scrunched his eyes closed, mouth hung open in an “o” shape with no audible sound coming out.
“I’m sorry,” Draco starts, taking a sip of the tea which he had already let get somewhat cold, “for everything… For leaving without saying anything. For worrying you. For breaking your heart…”
“You’re going to have to use your words if you want to cum, love,” Ron said, picking up his pace and only making it worse for Harry as he tried to form them, “only good boys get to cum, Harry.”
“Stay like that for us, love,” Ron instructed, popping open the cap of the lube he had also grabbed and spreading it over two of his fingers.
Three days.
“I’d rather not,”
Ron stared at him for a moment before letting out a laugh.
“Alright, Potter, you win.” Draco said sourly, “what do you want?”
"You know, Potter, maybe you're not so bad after all."
Ron’s eyes grew wide, his teeth welcoming his bottom lip as he chewed on it.
What could possibly go wrong?
Harry simply slipped his wand away again and strode over to the chair, plopping himself in it and feeling the way the cushion sank underneath him, “no rules.”
Draco’s chest heaved as he tried one last time to thrash around, only succeeding in amusing Harry. He was close himself, and that last thing he wanted was to say Harry fucking Potter’s name as he came. However, he wanted this to end. So, he swallowed his pride. With a broken sob, he gave Harry what he wanted.
“Potter? Potter!” Draco gritted out, wiggling his body in a futile attempt to get Harry off of him, “You’ve got to be kidding me. Get off of me!”
Harry shucked the cloak off, making his way to Draco’s bed and biting his lip as he saw him. He didn’t know why he was surprised that Draco slept naked, but he was. His eyes scanned the still body. The covers were thrown off of him and his chest was rising and falling soothingly.
“In England, or your living room?”
Thursday there was Quidditch. It’s a rough game sometimes, Harry knows that, but the actual game isn’t what got to him. It was after the game in the locker room. He had taken the furthest shower from the locker room, wanting to have some peace after a grueling game. He had peace for a little while until he felt ice-cold water being poured on him from above and a too-familiar snicker retreating from his shower as he let out a loud yelp.
"I want you," was what Harry could manage as he rolled his hips into Malfoy's, earning a surprised sound out of the blonde. "Please, Malfoy,"
Once on his back, Draco moved his hands to get comfortable. He watched as Harry got off the bed only to come back around and stand beside Ron. He looked at the both of them, taking a moment to thank whoever was listening for sending him such gorgeous boys.
“You think you can do whatever you want and the rest of us are just supposed to take it,” Harry seethed, “I think it’s time that you have to take what you’re given without being able to do anything about it.”
“Eyes open darling,” Harry chastised as he grabbed Draco’s chin and held his head in place, “you’re going to look at me while I fuck you.”
The taller boy smirked but shook his head, "head up, I wanna see your face when you come on my cock."
Harry startled once again as he pulled away, looking at Draco wildly. He fumbled with his hands before finally deciding to rest them on Draco’s hips. He looked up at the blonde, waiting for some kind of explanation.
Harry chuckled as he began a steady pace, sinking his teeth into Draco’s shoulder, “I hope so.”
He watched as Harry’s chest rose and fell, his breathing speeding up too much for Draco’s liking. He kept a close eye on Harry’s face, seeing how his eyes opened and closed and he sucked in breath after breath. As if reading his mind, Draco stroked his cheek.
“Draco?”
Draco grabbed Harry’s hips gently and brought him back towards his bed. He sat down, Harry falling into place on his lap as Ron watched.
He kissed Draco again, and after a moment Draco was already panting. He pushed his hips up against Harry's, their cocks rubbing together and creating just enough friction to drive them both mad.
“Ten strikes,” Harry informed him, “I’m going to give you nine more, and you’re going to count them. Once I’m done you’re going to thank me. Do you understand?”
"You've been ignoring me," Draco stated, "how else was I supposed to get your attention?"
Draco snuggled into Harry’s chest as he began to drift off, “I hate you, Potter.”
Draco moved out from underneath him, watching as Ron hungrily dipped down and encased Harry’s lips. They seemed to stay like that forever, Draco slowly undressing as Ron slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth, exploring.
Harry thought about it. He looked at Ron for an amount of time that could definitely be considered creepy before letting out a sigh and leaning into the other male.
“W-want, need to touch… you,” Draco struggled out, straining his wrists as he pulled on his binds, “please, s-sir, please!”
Harry nodded but made no move as they both froze, the too-familiar sound of heels clicking through the corridor. They jumped apart and practically ran to their seats, sliding into them as Madam Pomfrey opened the door with an exasperated grunt.
