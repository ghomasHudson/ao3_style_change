“Merlin!” Draco gasped and Granger groaned again. She reached for her wand again and lifted another – Potter’s. Snapped clean in two, the end of a red feather poking through the centre. She sobbed again and held the wand like it was Potter himself, lying broken on the forest floor. “This is no time to mourn a wand!” Draco snapped and she turned her tearful eyes to him. “You need to cut it off. It’s going to hurt him. Do you want me to do it?” he asked her, as calmly as he could manage as Potter moaned beneath them.
“Bathilda?” Potter repeated, pointing at her. She nodded again and Potter pressed a hand to his chest, as if feeling for something hanging there. The woman’s milky eyes were tracked on Potter and she shuffled past Granger, pushing her out of the way as though she hadn’t noticed her, and disappeared into the dingy sitting room beyond. Granger cast a look at where she believed Draco was still standing by the front door, though she looked someway to the right of him, and then she focused her attention on Potter, who was gazing after Bathilda Bagshot.
“He’s been helping us, like I said,” she told Weasley coolly and then with a curt nod, she marched off to her bedroom and let the canvas fall back, closing her off from the rest of them. Weasley eyed Draco and then ran a hand through his hair.
“What’s the map of?” Draco eventually asked and Potter glanced over at him. He held it up for Draco to see it better and Draco scanned the topography there, his eyebrows raising. “Is it a map of Hogwarts?” he said, looking for confirmation, and Potter nodded.
“Could I ask you something?” he said and Harry nodded, setting his mug down by his feet. He looked at Draco expectantly, and the other man hesitated for a second, twisting his mouth to one side in a curiously un-Malfoy-like gesture. “Were you… well, were you seeing anyone in Australia?” he blurted out and Harry grinned. He leaned back in the chair and ran a hand through his hair, making the mess even worse if Draco’s frown was anything to go by.
“About the spells, not your appearance!” he justified and Draco sniffed. He and Weasley pulled on black robes that Hermione had found in a storage cupboard at Shell Cottage and Harry swung the invisibility cloak over himself and Griphook, who had climbed onto Harry’s back.
“Yeah – on the upside, we got the Horcrux!” he said cheerily, flexing one of his hands where new skin was reforming. “On the downside…”
With a triumphant hiss, Harry swung forward once more and caught the cup. He looked down just as there was a scream of agony – Griphook had been swallowed by the rising tide of white-hot objects. Draco let out a yell as some plates pressed against his knees and thighs, and the spell holding Harry abruptly broke, sending him crashing into the wave of objects, which sprung up around him. He yelled and sprang back up onto his feet, dragging Griphook with him and the goblin clambered up onto his shoulders, out of the burning pile of things.
He was packing up as dawn came, unable to go back to sleep. He had dressed in clothes Dobby had packed for him, some jeans that he needed his school belt to hold up and a jumper that was warm but with holes in the elbows. He shoved his uniform and robes at the bottom of the bag, thinking briefly that he might never wear them again.
“Did you say anything to them?” he asked and Draco looked up at the canvas ceiling, thinking back to his admission over the graves of Lily and James Potter. He sighed.
of Rita Skeeter’s awful book said they had lived here. She must have been right about something after all,” she added ruefully and Draco nodded. Potter was studying the grave intently, a small furrow appearing beneath the borrowed bushy brows. Granger was watching him intently.
“Harry!” he said, standing up and walking over to pull him into a hug. Much like he had with Hermione, Harry leaned into the hug. Ron wasn’t as good as Hermione when it came to writing to him, usually scribbling a few sentences at the ends of Hermione’s letters, but Harry read those few sentences repeatedly whenever he had received a letter from England. He could always hear Ron’s voice in the words, and while it made him homesick initially, it brought him relief as well. Ron stepped back from the hug and smiled at him. “How are you? Can we get you anything? Beer, wine, tea?” he asked and Hermione shouted from the kitchen.
"Harry! What is it?" Hermione asked, rushing forward to catch his elbow and keep him upright. Harry pointed at the mirror.
“Do you want to do the wards?” she asked quietly and Draco nodded, lifting his hands off Potter. His arm ached but the pain didn’t come shooting back, and while his leg was tender, he could still walk on it. He took his wand from his back pocket, remarkably intact, and limped in a large circle around the clearing, repeating the charms for the wards as Granger set up the tent. As soon as he was done, they both took a second to look at Potter, who groaned on the forest floor, his eyes unseeing.
“Here,” he said quietly and Potter gave him a small but thankful smile. He turned his gaze back out to the snowy landscape around them.
Next to him, Hermione knocked her shoulder to his. “I’m the brightest witch of our age, eh?” she asked him teasingly and Draco hid his smile beneath a curtain of hair, brightened further by the yelp of terror from Weasley in the tent behind them.
“He’s dead,” Draco told Harry simply and Hermione made a noise of shock. “It doesn’t matter. We need to get going.” He jerked his arm out of Hermione’s hold and lowered his sleeve. “What do we have left? Just the snake?” he said and that seemed to snap them all back into it.
But now - he was different. He no longer looked pale and pointed, like he had in his youth. He stood tall, his shoulders drawn back, his posture confident. The dark grey of his suit made his eyes seem brighter somehow, more blue than grey. His hair wasn’t slicked back like it had been at school, but was slightly tousled, like Malfoy had run a hand through the fine strands with little care for how they fell.
“Yes. Where are you? Will you let me help?” he asked but Potter was turning his attention back to the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm. He took Draco’s arm by the wrist and lifted it, bending over to look more closely at the Dark Mark.
They started to laugh, and Draco could not stop once he’d started. He’d calm a second to catch his breath and then he’d catch Hermione’s eye and they’d both start laughing again until their ribs ached and tears streamed down their faces. Harry fell onto his back, dragging Draco down with him until Draco was pulled onto Harry’s chest, his ear pressed over Harry’s heart.
The Patronus was more substantial this time, and it hovered for a moment before melting away again. Draco cursed and resisted the urge to throw his wand. He stomped over to the rear wall and leaned into the alcove carved there, trying not to pout.
“You’ll freeze to death out here. But if I see anything Malfoy, even a hint of betrayal, and I will throw you out on your ear, and hex it off on the way,” she said and he nodded. He scrambled to shove the tent poles back inside his backpack and then pick it up while Granger waited, her eyes trained on his movements, looking for something amiss.
“There you are!” Hermione said with a smile as they finally got close, and the circle of adults and children widened to let them in. Much like Harry, her hair was beginning to show signs of silver running through it, and Ron’s as well. Hugo, Ron and Hermione’s son, was pinned in place by his father’s arm across his chest, and he had a familiar wild look in his eyes, like he was about to dart away and lose himself in the crowd. Rose, their daughter, lingered with Tatiana by her trolley, their heads bowed together as they talked. Rose was another new first-year and she had the same amount of precociousness as her mother had at the same age. Draco was already dreading her first Potions lesson.
“Sorry,” Potter mumbled, his voice still soft. “I noticed when you left. Wanted to check if you were ok,” he said and Draco felt a bite of anger rise up in his chest.
The doors opened to the examination hall and the low rumble of noise cut off quickly. The Fellow who had given them the introductory talk yesterday began to usher the assembled candidates in and Hermione reached over to give Harry’s hand one final squeeze as they were swept away with the other applicants.
“I miss her, but not like that,” Potter finally said, and Draco nodded a bit shakily. They lapsed into silence then, the only noise the fluttering of the Snitch’s wings as it leapt from Potter’s open hand and circled around their heads once more.
There was a timid-sounding knock on the door and Amycus barked “Come!”, brushing his wand off on the fold of his robes. A terrified-looking third-year poked her head around the door and practically quivered at the sight of the seventh-years watching her. “Yes?” Amycus hissed and she visibly gulped.
Draco snorted in amusement and Ron grinned at him as Hermione lifted the edge of the cloak and he slipped back under its cover.
"Hey, have a look over these files with me," Ron said, reaching for a mug of tea, which Belinda handed over - she slapped his hand away as he tried to pinch a few biscuits from the plate on the tray. Ginny went over and pulled one of the guest chairs up to the desk, taking a file from the stack by Ron's elbow and opening it to the first page. Neville joined her, casting wary glances over his shoulder at Malfoy, who was still studying the floating image.
“I was in the Forbidden Forest and Narcissa Malfoy was there,” he said, closing the book. Anxiety clawed at his throat a little, but Harry ignored it. “I fell on to the floor and it felt like something was trying to pull me into the earth. And then she said - well, she told
Four wand tips lit up in the gloom of the vault and Draco held his high as he picked his way through the vault. Precariously stacked potions bottles lay next to a stack of ancient, dusty books with strange looking leather.
“Why are you here, Malfoy?” she asked and Draco cleared his throat, masking a sniff as the cold air stinging his nose.
The angle was awkward. Their noses clashed and Harry’s glasses were pushed painfully into his face, but he didn’t care. Draco’s lips were warm and soft against his own and he made a surprised sort of noise at the back of his throat but he didn’t pull away. Harry reached out and cupped the back of Draco’s neck in his hand, tilted his head slightly to adjust the angle, and pressed closer.
“I studied History of the Dark Arts,” Harry said, interrupting Hermione. He wanted to be the one to say it, and he wasn’t surprised to see Malfoy’s eyes widened. He plowed on. “Specifically with a focus on post 18th Century Dark Arts. I wrote my dissertation for my Bachelors on the Rise and Fall of Grindelwald and the Dark Artefacts he used in his consolidation of power,” he explained, watching as Malfoy's eyebrows slowly rose.
“If it’s between you and the Dark Lord, Potter, I’m…. well, I’m on your side,” he said and Potter looked a bit stunned, his mouth falling slack. He shook his head, clearing away his expression and Draco only glared at him. “I am! Even if I have to throw my lot in with the blood traitor and a Mud– Muggle-born,” he said and Potter’s eyes took on a glint that Draco had only ever seen in Quidditch games – determination. Fearlessness. “I have lived this whole summer with Him in my home, Potter, and I am – I’m scared,” he admitted and Potter’s gaze relaxed.
"We need a plan," Ginny said hours later. She gestured at the files they all held, and that were piled up by their feet. "We need to figure out who might've taken the boys. Whittle these suspects down. Malfoy - do you have any idea what we should be searching for?" she asked and Malfoy took a shaky breath, obviously composing himself.
“‘The Order of the Phoenix is finished’,” he said in a tone of voice that suggested he was repeating something. “‘You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s kidding themselves’,” he added and Draco frowned at them both.
Dark Arts?” Ron asked and Harry tilted his head back against the firm cushions behind him, thinking.
, he thought, blinking and rolling in mid-air as a Death Eater went screaming past him, the end of their broom alight. It might’ve been Rowle, but he couldn’t be sure. He turned again and tried to orientate himself just as a large motorbike roared over him, the half-giant Groundskeeper of Hogwarts, Hagrid, riding it, a sidecar bouncing along next to it. He heard the screech of an owl and his heart skipped a beat.
Draco was wanted by the Dark Lord, and he might be killed in cold blood. Crabbe must have written about Draco’s strange dream and the Dark Lord was now suspicious. Draco could tell that all the colour had drained from his face, and his cheeks felt numb.
Harry left and retreated back to his own room. And if both he and Malfoy lain awake for hours that night, until they both had been dragged into nightmares by exhaustion alone, neither of them mentioned it in the morning.
“Draco,” he heard someone call his name and he turned to see Blaise sat against the stone wall behind him. He looked bruised and a bit bloodied, but in one piece.
"One of the definitions of “lost' is “that which has been taken away or cannot be recovered'," Dumbledore explained and Malfoy frowned at him.
Distantly, Draco was aware that the Hall had fallen silent, survivors lining the walls to watch two duels – the one between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix and the one with Voldemort. He glanced behind him to see that McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Slughorn were fighting, their faces set in determination, wands weaving as they kept Voldemort on his toes, unable to think before responding.
“For all your help these last few weeks Draco, you’ve earned a spot for life,” she told him with genuine affection and Draco felt a warmth spread through him at the words. Hermione patted his arm and then stood and went deeper into the tent where it was warmer, leaving Draco to sit with her words for a while, enjoying the warmth they inspired.
There was no explosion of activity. Rather, Draco watched as a ripple of terror ran through the crowd, starting with the bride and groom and moving outwards in a small wave as more and more guests realised what the lynx has just said – by the time they looked over to where it had landed, the lynx had shattered into starlight and was gone.
There was a moment’s pause and then there was a blast of noise. Harry flinched back, stepping into Draco, his arms half-raising as if to shield himself and then they all realised what the sound was. From every portrait there was applause and hoots and wolf-whistles as the Headmasters and Headmistresses of centuries past celebrated. Some were dancing jigs on chairs, others were waving hats or wigs, Heliotrope Wilkins was so overcome with emotion that she was crying into her veil.
“Are you alright?” he asked and she nodded, pushing the door open. She held the door for him as she stepped through and he followed her into the hallway. She gave a shaky sigh and reached for her chignon, pulling her hair free and shaking it out. Harry gave her another concerned look and she smiled at him.
"There they are! Rose!" Albus shouted, pointing in the distance to where Hermione, Ron and their children waited. They reached the Granger-Weasley family and greetings were exchanged, Rose hugging both boys as they chattered excitedly among themselves.
“My cousin was Regulus Black,” Draco suddenly said and Potter frowned at him. Granger looked surprised at the comment but didn’t say anything. “Maybe I’m more like him than I thought. Maybe I’ve learned to keep secrets too,” he said and while Granger looked confused, Potter merely gave him another once-over look and then lowered his wand slightly, lifting his mug of tea to take a sip. There, they sat in silence, drinking their tea and letting the fire warm them.
“We’re off to Sherwood Forest. The wards will collapse as soon as we go, so on 3? 1, 2, 3-” and on the third beat they all turned and Draco felt himself compressed into darkness for one breathless moment before the world reformed around them and they landed heavily in a small clearing surrounded by dense woods. Granger was already on her feet, wand drawn and raised. “Can you boys help me with the wards?”
“From Dumbledore’s office, actually. I Summoned it soon before the summer holidays started,” she admitted and he gave her a concerned look, though part of him wanted to laugh at the sheer audacity of it. He remembered the gaps in the shelving in Snape’s office and wondered if those were the spaces for the books she had Summoned.
“Not used to all this fresh air, Pansy,” he said casually, forcing his face to relax into a familiar smirk. It felt forced on his face now, and his muscles twitched, unused to what had been his daily mask before. He turned to face Crabbe and Goyle Senior, who frowned at him. “I think I’m about ready to go home,”
“I’ve seen him in there hundreds of times Greyback, Vernon’s a Slytherin,” he added confidently and next to him Dean Thomas held his breath. The line of questioning switched immediately, the Snatchers knocked back by Potter’s quick (and correct) response.
Three weeks nearly had passed, and they had exchanged nearly a dozen letters. Harry, to his own embarrassment, kept the stack of Draco’s letters on his desk at him, the neat print of Harry’s name and address greeting him every morning. The last letter had been signed off ‘Yours, Draco’, and Harry had address his reply to ‘Draco’, feeling a bit giddy at the thought. He was fleshing out his reply while sat at the Galleon Café when someone softly rapped on the table he was sitting at.
"Why our boys?" Malfoy had asked and Harry ignored the urge to correct him - they hadn't been Malfoy's boys for a long time, but now wasn't the time to point it out.
The room was decorated in shades of sage green, dark brown and hints of silver. Both boys had teased him about showing his Slytherin side, especially after he had revealed to them the truth about his Sorting (just before that very first train ride). A large four-poster bed was set against the wall between two windows, and both nightstands were buckling under the weight of books he hadn't read yet, and magazines he hadn't managed to unsubscribe to, and Ministry files he spent too much time pouring over. Harry tugged at the corner of the rumpled duvet, straightening it a little, and then went to rummage through the chest of drawers nearby.
, a large backpack, filled to the brim, landed in front of Draco. Metal canisters on the sides, filled with liquid, clanked as it landed on the kitchen floor.
“Uh, a few pages before my Father took it back, why–?” but he didn’t have time to finish the question before she scooted along to his log and shoved the book into his lap, nearly spilling his tea. She was warm against his side, apparently all personal space forgotten, as she tapped at one of the passages on the page she had been reading.
She paused and Draco tilted his head, noticing a strange grinding sound coming from somewhere in the room. He glanced up just in time to see the crystal chandelier sway ominously. With a creak and the tinkling of crystal, it began to fall directly onto Bellatrix, who stood beneath it. She dropped Hermione, throwing herself to one side to avoid it. Draco lifted his hands to cover his head and he felt someone land on top of him, knocking him to the ground. The chandelier exploded into a million shards of crystals and chains as it landed, falling on top of Hermione and the goblin.
“Where did you get this sword?” she hissed at him, holding it up by it’s hilt and swinging it slightly so that the silver of the blade caught the firelight. Greyback snarled at her and she stepped forward, forcing his wand out of his fist where he held it out to one side.
“You should have seen your face!” he howled, waving at Draco, who looked dumbstruck. Ron doubled over and nearly spilled his tea had Hermione not caught it with a clever flick of her wand first. “Oh, that’ll keep me amused for days,” Ron wheezed, straightening up, and Harry shot Draco a reassuring look. It was as close to a blessing as they were likely to ever get.
“That’s quite noble work, Malfoy. Do you get much interest in it from other academics?” Hermione asked, and Malfoy turned his gaze to her, and they began to chat about Malfoy’s field of study, leaving Harry to wallow in his shame.
“Alright. Hey, if you want to get some sleep, why don’t you use my bunk?” Potter suggested and Draco suddenly wanted to crawl into that bed and cocoon himself in Potter’s lingering warmth but forced himself to shake his head.
Draco was holding Scorpius in his arms, his face tear-stained and his right eyelid swelling shut. Scorpius was pale and shivering, his right leg hanging at an odd angle, and when Draco dropped to his knees in front of the mirror, Scorpius gave a cry of pain.
“Potter?” Bellatrix practically shrieked, which made Draco turn his head away. He watched the flames flicker in the fireplace as she spoke. “Are you sure? Well, then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!” There was the rustling of fabric as Draco imagined her drawing back her sleeve to expose her Dark Mark, but Father interrupted.
!" Albus said in a rush into Draco's ear, letting him go after a second and stepping back, his face flushed and his grin threatening to split his face in two. "This is going to AMAZING!" he cried, punching the air. Harry laughed a little, and shook his head.
“Hi Harry,” Cameron said with a smile, his warm eyes crinkling in the corners. Harry sat back in his chair, and tried to make himself smile in return.
Snow still fell around them and he wrapped his arms around himself as he walked, trying to keep warm as a chill wind stroked over his face. Hermione lit the tip of her wand and stared around at the empty clearing. Whatever tracks there might have been, the falling snow had covered them.
Draco was starving, he realised, and he joined the others as they helped themselves to the offered food. Aberforth returned with some goblets that looked like they could have had another cleaning charm run over them, but none of them cared, pouring themselves full glasses and drinking deeply. Full and safe (for now), Draco slumped back in the armchair and promptly fell asleep.
“She can barely lift a match, how in Merlin’s name is she going to pass over a bloody great sword?” Draco snarled and Granger gave him a quelling look. He dropped his head a little and shook it. “I don’t like this. This place stinks, it’s like no one’s lived here for months. And look–” He gestured at the bookcase next to the fireplace. “It’s untouched, there’s a whole layer of dust over it. Bathilda Bagshot is well known for her reading,” he said and Granger leaned in close, studying the untouched layer of dust covering the books. She paused and pulled a book out that was laid over the top of others, wiping off the dust on the cover.
"Malfoy. Nice of you to help," he replied, and they stared at each other coolly for a few seconds. Belinda eyed the three of them, a little confused, for a minute and then cleared her throat.
As they had been sitting towards the front, it took a bit longer for Harry and Hermione to make their way to the front, and by the time they got there, the amount of glasses had lessened dramatically. Harry picked up a glass of red for himself and passed Hermione one of the few remaining glasses of white, who gave him a grateful smile. And then they mingled - or, at least, tried to.
“Dobby gave it to me as I left the castle, I guess it’s been enchanted to bring food from the Hogwarts kitchens,” he said and Potter choked on a bite of his sandwich.
“I can’t see anything either,” he said and Granger shook her head, her nose wrinkling as she squinted even more.
Once they were settled, for there was quite a few of them, the rest of Slytherin House stood and trooped out of the room, led by Filch, who was stony-faced
After Potter woke up a few hours later and Hermione had her watch, they ate another dinner of stew and set up for the night. Potter sat himself down on the cushion, which had now been layered with three extra blankets, the bluebell jar resting in his lap as Draco handed over his wand. Their fingers brushed as Potter took it off him. “Thanks,” he said and then he turned to face the inky darkness outside and Draco went to bed, a small ache in his stomach.
"Take care of our sons," Draco murmured and Hermione blinked rapidly, fighting back tears. Ron sniffed loudly, and nodded. Harry have them a weak smile, and let go of Draco's hand, stepping away slightly.
“It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” she said breathlessly, positively beaming at him. “Wasn’t it absolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? We still hadn’t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The Basilisk!”
"Yes, well, that's all a given, really-," Thompson cut in, but he stopped when Ron raised his wand again. Another Auror, Mulligan, spoke up.
“Thank you, Dobby,” he said carefully and the elf's ears quivered. “If I did need to leave… Could you help me? With supplies, and the like?” he asked and Dobby cast a nervous glance around the room but then nodded.
“Yes, well done. I wouldn’t have thought you had it in you, the way you went on about the NEWT exams,” Hermione said, though she smiled to take away some of the sting. Harry grinned, and set his glass down.
Draco held himself still. This was what he had wanted after all, for years. For Harry Potter to be dead and the Dark Lord to lead the wizarding world into a golden age of blood purity.
“We’re off to bed,” Bill eventually told the boys, and Fleur sidled past him, waving goodnight. “Don’t stay up too late,” he told them and they chorused goodnight as he followed his wife upstairs.
now, he realised – you couldn’t fight off a giant snake together and not be on a first name basis) to bed an hour or so after Potter stopped twitching. Draco was leant forward in his seat, his head bowed and one hand on Potter’s arm, when he heard Potter’s breathing change and he looked up just as Potter blinked awake.
“I… I know things now. Things I didn’t know before. I have to go,” he said, his voice firm but low. “I wanted to go without saying goodbye. I know Ron and Hermione will try to stop me. I know you will,” he said and Draco felt anger flare within him.
The room fell quiet. Harry was in the middle of a crowd, his face turned back towards the door. The occupants, twenty or so students that Draco could see, were watching Draco like snakes about to strike. It reminded him starkly of his first night in the Slytherin common room, all those years ago. The older Slytherins watching the younger ones, studying them, trying to find their weaknesses. Slytherin was about survival in that first year.
There was a hum of silence and Draco risked a glance up. The snake was still on the floor, slithering towards one of the two figures, her tongue flickering in front of her. The Dark Lord idled by the fireplace, his pale skin standing out lividly against the flames, his red eyes on Draco. Draco felt a sting of fear go through him, and he looked away.
“Welcome, my friends, to our finest hour,” the Dark Lord said, and there was a chorus of screams and shouts from the group at the table. Draco bit his tongue. “All of our plans will come to fruition tonight! Tonight, we will kill Harry Potter once and for all!” the snake’s tongue tested the air over her master’s shoulder as the cheers rose up again.
“Not really,” she said quietly and he smiled back. “So, tell me about Australia?" she asked and they began to catch up. After four years apart, they had a lot to talk about.
“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Mother said firmly in her cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that this is Potter before we summon the Dark lord. His wand Greyback, do you have his wand?” she snapped, holding out a hand and there was some awkward shuffling around the Snatchers as the wands were passed over. Mother rolled her eyes as she looked at them. “This one is my son’s…” she said, sliding Draco’s wand into her belt next to her own. “Now, this one, you are sure this was the one Potter was holding?” she asked one of the Snatchers, who nodded vigorously. She turned it over in her hands, studying it by firelight. “It does not resemble Ollivander’s description… If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing… remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?”
“Ginny’s on the platform. I think Tati’s wound herself up a bit,” he said quietly and Harry glanced over his shoulder. Silver was beginning to spike through his riotous dark curls and his green eyes were set off nicely by the tailored forest green robes he wore.
Centaurs had charged into the Great Hall too and Draco watched as one of them kicked at Travers, breaking his leg seemingly from the way he went down to the floor with a scream. He skirted around Yaxley as he was bodily slammed to the floor by George Weasley and Lee Jordan. Walden McNair soared past them and hit the opposite wall with a sickening ‘
“I’ll be fine for a little while longer,” he said and she gave him an assessing look but didn’t argue. Harry turned back to Ron. “And the talk wasn’t anything we didn’t already know. Two papers on two subjects and then if we get short-listed, we have a
“Yes. He was always kind to me, Dobby. He used to sneak me toffees before dinner,” Draco said, smiling a little at the memory. He looked up to meet Harry’s gaze. "There was something I wanted to show you actually,” he said, standing up again and darting over to one of the book shelves. He rummaged around a little bit and then hurried back over to the armchairs, a book in his hands. Effie reappeared and Draco nearly tripped over here, collapsing into the chair instead, book held high. Harry laughed at the look on his face, and how he was sprawled over the armchair, and Draco gave him a mock affronted look before righting himself and holding out the book, which Harry took.
Thankfully, the tent collapsed with a tap of his wand and wrapped itself up tightly again so he could easily stow it in the backpack. He pulled down the wards and went to splash his face with cold water from the lake, taking a second in the cold light of day to check the Dark Mark – it had faded to a dark angry colour, but no longer burned as black as it had in the night.
“Stand up, stand up,” Blaise encouraged him, his tone a little sharp. “What have they done? Oh, Merlin,” he swore loudly once he saw Draco’s forearm. Draco retched again and sobbed, his eyes blurred with tears, his forearm both unbearably hot and disturbingly numb at the same time. “Right, let me try – stand
“Regulus? No, why,” Draco said, stepping a bit further into the room. He had opened his eyes standing on the threshold of the doorway, and Potter had already been upright, as if waiting for him.
“Harry, I’m short-listed too!” Hermione shouted down the line at him, and Harry was glad he had taken the phone away from his ear. “Do you think Malfoy was too? I’ll write to him in the morning, just to check. Oh Harry, this is amazing!” there was a rustle as Ron passed the phone back to Hermione. “Ron - are you going back to sleep?” she said in amazement and Harry laughed.
“Move,” the Gryffindor demanded and Draco raised an eyebrow at the audacity of this child to talk to him that way. He opened his mouth to protest but the Gryffindor spoke before he could. “Move, murderer,” he hissed and Draco felt the words like a punch in the chest.
“Is the top bunk still free?” Weasley asked and Potter was about to open his mouth to explain when Draco stood up, ducking to avoid catching his head on the bunk. .
“It’s just… I’m sure I’ve heard the name Peverell before,” he muttered, resting his chin in one hand, his hips awkwardly tilted on the bench. Draco took a bite of his sandwich (turkey and cheese as always) and just watched Potter expectantly. “Where did you say you’d seen the name, Hermione?” he asked and she covered her mouth as she spoke.
“Can I help?” he asked and Hermione gave him an unconvinced look, an eyebrow raised. He shrugged. “Just offering,” he said and Hermione sighed, letting her hair fall free and dropping her arms to her side.
it,” he had complained while Harry had packed for his trip. Harry paused while folding a t-shirt and gave Cameron a quick look. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with golden sun-kissed skin and hair, his eyes a dark brown. He was handsome and light-hearted and so distinctly un-English that Harry couldn’t have chosen someone less likely to remind him of home. But somewhere, deep in his heart, Harry had always known it would have never lasted. Theirs was not a romance for the ages.
"One of the Forensic Wizards just floo'd in. They've found something with the trunks," he said and Harry felt dazed.
It was like someone had hit the room with a deafening charm. The occupants all fell silent, and the celebratory mood that had encompassed the room only seconds before was gone.
“I’ve been with Harry,” Draco said wearily. He flexed the hand connected to the ruined forearm and the skin pulled, which made him hiss in pain. Blaise gave him a grim smile.
At the final flight of stairs, Harry paused, and pulled the invisibility cloak out from the pouch around his neck. He leaned forward and kissed Draco, his lips cool and soft, and then he stepped away and disappeared under the cloak. He did not say goodbye.
He rounded the corner and found the gargoyle that guarded the Headmaster’s office. He hesitated, unsure of what the password could be. He cleared his throat and the gargoyle stirred, as if listening.
, per se. There’s a group of them that run as a company, it’s House Elf owned and operated. Mipsy comes in on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings and makes breakfast, does a light clean and some laundry, and gets paid 3 galleons an hour,” she said firmly and Harry raised his hands in surrender.
I understand,” Draco said, waving a hand dismissively. Granger gave him an incredulous look. “What I don’t understand is, why would you even have this book? This passage alone is – well, it’s horrific. Seams in the soul… it’s the division between the consciousness and the very essence of one’s being. The lines between who we were at birth and who we are at death,” he explained and Granger’s eyes lit up.
The elf lay still and Draco fell to his knees a few feet away, feeling like the air had been stolen directly from his lungs. Potter was still speaking, still calling the elf's name, even as Draco saw figures appearing out of the darkness, from a cottage he hadn’t seen before. One of them paused by a pair of people huddled in the sand, Weasley and Hermione, and helped them get up, while the other continued towards them, jogging.
Thompson, to his credit, had managed to pull together a Strike Team of the Ministry's best Aurors, including some of the Aurors that Harry knew from his field days. He had, however, tried to discourage them from following the Auror team to Malfoy Manor, but Harry had pulled his wand out and pointed it directly in his face. The other man hadn't said another word, only to say that Ginny and Luna were definitely not permitted to follow them, to which the two had grudgingly agreed.
“Dinner, Draco,” she murmured over her shoulder, her long hair falling over one shoulder. She was remarkably beautiful in her own way, his mother, but the stress of this summer had turned her skin sallow and her hair lank. Though not as badly as it had affected his father.
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Hermione said a bit tearfully and Draco gave them both a weak smile over Harry’s shoulder.
Harry had answered his first two questions and was reading the rest of the questions on the General II exam before him. Sat a few rows ahead of him, he could just see the curve of Malfoy’s spine as he leaned low over his desk, and Harry thought if he listened hard enough, he could make out the scratch of Malfoy’s pen above the others, though he was probably lying to himself about that.
“Who is it?” he called and there was no answer but the door knob twisted violently. Gritting his teeth, he sent a Stinging Jinx at the door and there was a howl of pain when whoever was on the other side tried to turn the handle the other way. There was a loud curse and then the sound of retreating footsteps and Draco slumped backwards onto his pillows.
“What is it?” he whispered in her ear and she wiped a gloved hand over something partway down the stone, under a faded name, drawing his attention to the symbol etched there. He gaped, his mouth suddenly going dry. The symbol from the book.
Deeper into the graveyard they went, stopping now and then to peer at headstones and overground tombs, dusting off the snow to check the names. Draco kept an eye out in the surrounding darkness, squinting to make sure they weren’t being followed.
He blinked again and this one felt even heavier and he tried to force his eyes open but then he was slipping away, the cup of tea falling out of his hands onto the floor below.
The noise of fighting cut him off, and he let go of Harry just in time to see two redheads – Weasleys – come backing into view. One of the twins and the one with glasses – Percy. They were duelling with two Death Eaters, and Draco’s heart plunged. The Death Eaters had breached Hogwarts. He ran to help, the others just ahead of him, and he was close enough to see when one of the Death Eaters’ hoods fell.
“Here,” he said, taking one end of the pole and holding it steady while Draco pushed the other side into place. The tent was upright shortly after and Draco moved his backpack inside, running a hand through his hair with a sigh. Potter was still lingering, surveying the tent. “It’s a Muggle tent, isn’t it?” he asked and Draco nodded.
They watched in absolute silence as the figure came nearer. Draco realised after it passed a brightly lit window that it was a woman, though her face was obscured by the darkness around them. He half-expected her to turn into any one of the cottages she walked past but she didn’t, and with a sense of dread, he realised she was coming straight for them. Granger reached around Draco and poked Potter in the side, but he didn’t yelp. They exchanged significant looks and Draco didn’t need to be included in the conversation to know what they were saying.
doesn't extend luncheon invitations often," he said, tilting his head back to look up at the winding staircase above him. Harry remained silent. "I'll sleep on the sofa, then, shall I?" Malfoy suggested eventually, and Harry looked over at him. He looked tired - exhausted, even, and Harry probably looked worse himself. Malfoy ran a hand over his face and breathed deeply, the inhale catching slightly in his throat, but Harry didn't comment. He was very sure that if he stopped for a minute, he would probably burst into tears himself.
“He was loyal until the end,” she snapped at him in a harsh voice and he fell back into his chair, unused to hearing that tone from her. “Regulus was loyal to the Dark Lord until his death and that is the end of it Draco, do you understand me?” she asked him roughly and he nodded.
The snake had bitten him and was trying to slither up his side, trying to get at Potter but another spell from Granger sent it spitting back. Potter managed to get to his feet, and he helped Draco up with one rough hand around his waist and Draco staggered, trying not to put too much weight on his leg. The pain from the Mark lessened slightly as Potter’s touch and Draco used that to fuel himself, scrambling over the bed to get to the door. Granger came after them, Potter reaching out a hand to drag her over the dusty mottled duvet, but she was yanked back, screaming. Draco lurched forward to grab her and together they hauled her over, kicking at the snake who reared at them all. She righted herself and they ran for it, Granger screaming “
Draco slowly lowered himself next to the body. Snape’s eyes were still a little open, unseeing and blank and his mouth was slightly parted, his neck stained dark with blood. He looked… strange. Hollow.
“Are you cold?” he asked. Draco shook his head but pulled his knees up to his chest and wrapped his arms around them, pressing the arches of his feet into the bedframe. Weasley was still talking, but was now speaking about how the locket (had Potter had the locket on him?) had been opened and he hesitated for a second before Potter cut in.
The dragon, apparently still ignorant of their presence, was drinking deeply from the cold lake water. It was crouching over the opposite bank, scooping its scarred snout into the water. Draco turned and swam in the opposite direction, pulling himself through reeds and mud until he lay, soaking wet and freezing, on the damp grass. The others followed.
“I’m glad to see you,” he admitted to Potter who didn’t so much as blink, his wand still pointing at Draco. He took a step forward and Potter’s grip on the wand turned white-knuckled. Draco gestured to the fire. “Can I sit down? It’s bloody freezing,” he admitted and Potter’s jaw tightened but then he nodded. Draco walked over to the fire and perched on one of the logs that had been placed around it, shrugging off his backpack and reaching out his hands to warm them. Potter’s wand was still trained on him and Draco huffed impatiently. “Can you put that down, please? As Granger said, the wards would have burned me if I had ill-will! And” – he dropped his voice so that Granger couldn’t hear from inside the tent, which looked invitingly bright and warm – “we’ve been talking. I told you, I was coming to find you,” he said and Potter blinked but didn’t say anything.
There was more information about the Viva below, but Harry’s eyes skimmed over it. His heart was pounding in his chest and he felt a little light-headed, like he had just performed some sort of Quidditch trick and was regaining his equilibrium.
“Got put in Kingsley’s team, battled some Death Eaters, fought off some spiders… Watched Lupin go down. I was just about to get blasted out of one of the windows when You-Know-Who told them to stand down,” he said and Draco nodded. “What about you? Where’s Potter?” Blaise asked and Draco turned to point.
“Dobby, I need to get my things,” he said somewhat stupidly, and the elf shook his head, his ears flapping, and pointed at the backpack.
The pamphlet could have been there for months, for all Draco knew, but it was all he had to go on. He settled the stone back into the ground and stood, tucking the pamphlet into his jeans pocket and then turning sharply on his heel, Disapparating with a sharp
“I’d kill him all over again,” Harry said into Draco’s neck and they swayed on the spot for a second.
“One of us? You think it will be you, do you-” Voldemort jeered, a smirk splitting his face. “- the boy who has survived by accident, and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings?”
He blinked and there Potter was, standing alone in a sea of darkness. He looked up as Draco appeared, and looked a little relieved. The dream was like before, heavy and warm around him, like stepping into a welcoming embrace. Draco longed to sink into it, but Potter kept him anchored there.
From behind his desk, the portrait of Madam Hilda, the first female Head of Department, cleared her throat. Harry looked up and she gave him a watery smile.
“It’s the right thing to do,” he said into the quiet expectation that filled the room and Harry’s smile was full of relief.
“Do you mean astral-projecting?” she asked and he nodded hopefully. She pulled a face, the corners of her mouth quirking downwards as she thought. “Well, it’s rare but possible. One must be connected, in some way, to the person whom one is hoping to meet in the astral plane. But only a few wizards have ever succeeded in making contact. Most of the time, they end up lost in some Mudblood’s dreams and get classed as Sleep Demons.” She sniffed dismissively and lifted her teacup again. “Why do you ask, darling?”
Though he was incorporeal, Draco threw himself out of the way as guests began running in all directions. Through the crowd, he could see Granger looking around the room desperately. At her side was a redhead, some sort of Weasley cousin Draco suspected. A sharp crack sounded, and Draco realised that the family had put protective charms around their land and those charms had now broken.
“I have one! Ron, hold the phone, let me just-,” and then the line went fuzzy as Hermione passed her phone over to Ron, who then spoke.
Out of a bunch of terrified-looking wedding guests, Weasley appeared, pushing his way through the crowd. He reached out a hand and no sooner had Granger taken it, the Weasley cousin’s hand in her other one, then there was a sharp
There was the hum of music and the chatter of a party in full swing when a wisp of silver fell through the marquee overhead and landed lightly in the middle of the dancefloor. Fleur’s skirts swirled around her as she came to a stop and her new husband pulled her to his chest. A lynx formed from the midst and it flicked its tail at the frozen dancers as it opened its mouth and spoke.
“We can probably stay here another day, but we should move on the day after. And I need to go get some supplies,” she said, frowning over at the tent. “I don’t think we have much by way of lunch, I’m afraid,” she added apologetically to Draco who startled and shut the book. He set it carefully on the log next to him and shucked his blanket, going back to his tent and dragging out his backpack. He retook his seat and Granger and Potter watched with fascination as he dug through it, pulling out the brown paper bag which Mibby had given him all those weeks ago. He opened it and laughed, before proferring it to Granger. Inside were three carefully wrapped sandwiches.
“Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for coming. Following a rigorous examination, and a round of enlightening Vivas, I would like to congratulate all of our short-listed candidates on having made it this far,” and he led the assembled hall in a round of applause. He then unfurled the piece of paper clutched in his hand. Harry glanced at Hermione, who was staring straight ahead, her gaze focused like a laser, her knuckles bleached white from her grip on Ron’s hand. He then glanced at Draco, who held Harry’s own hand in a firm hold but looked calm, serene even. Yes, Harry did have everything he needed, right here. The Fellow cleared his throat, and Harry leaned forward.
’ which he had been reading all morning. Hermione wrinkled her nose. “What do you make of it?” she asked and Draco shook his head. His hair was longer now than it had ever been and constantly fell into his eyes. He swiped a hand through it, pushing it out of his face.
“Harry! Oh Harry, congratulations! Ron, go check, have I had a letter?” Hermione asked breathlessly and Harry could hear Ron grumbling, but there his voice disappeared from the line. “He’s just gone. Oh Harry, really, I’m so pleased! When is it?” she asked, and Harry glanced at the calendar on the kitchen wall.
“I thoroughly checked the company before I agreed, but it is handy. And we always get her a little something for Christmas and her birthday, which she seems to appreciate,” Hermione said, and then Mipsy came back into the kitchen and they stopped talking about her. She plated them both two Full English Breakfasts and Harry tucked into his with gusto. “Did you sleep well?” Hermione asked, neatly cutting some mushrooms in two. Harry swallowed his mouthful to answer.
“That should do,” he said and Draco felt a flush of validation go over him, pleased at having done a good job. Potter took the matchbox from him and lit the kindling, blowing gently on the smouldering leaves to spark the flames. It caught quickly enough and by then Granger had come out as well, three mugs of tea in her hands and a book shoved under one of her arms.
“The kitchens is quiet now, sir, if you wants to come in? We is done cleaning after breakfast.” The elf gestured to the painting next to Draco, which he now saw was cracked open on hidden hinges. Draco nodded and stood and the elf led him into the kitchen. The room was vast, lined with counters that were stacked high with glistening pots and pans. Five long tables were spaced around the room and Draco realised that they were in the exact same positions as the tables in the Great Hall up above. A large fireplace, big enough for Draco to stand in comfortably, roared on the opposite side of the room, tended by several house-elves.
He found them in a carriage with open seating, and sidled into the window seat opposite Blaise, who inclined his head silently in greeting. Pansy slipped in next to Draco and wound her hand around his forearm. He patted her hand and stared out of the window, trying to find familiar faces in the crowd. In the seats behind him, Crabbe and Goyle slipped in, though Draco knew they weren’t here as friends.
“Just as well. A few have asked me for my wand once or twice – ‘I’m a witch sir, I’m a witch, let me prove it to you!’” Travers said in an imitation of a woman’s voice. He scoffed. “As if I was going to give her my wand – but whose wand are you using at the moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was–”
Mrs Weasley turned to give Draco a smile but froze as a wave of power washed over them. Draco turned to watch McGonagall, Shacklebolt and Slughorn all fall at the same time, blasting backwards by the blast of fury from Voldemort, who screamed, raising his wand at Molly. Draco, not even thinking, pushed her behind him, turning to face the wand, and then a spell,
“They have Draco,” Mother told Father, who swayed slightly where he stood. “Look, Lucius, Draco’s home!” she told him tearfully and Father cast him a cursory look.
The snow here was impacted and Draco tried not to slip as he walked directly behind Potter, reaching out one hand to touch Potter lightly on the shoulder to steady himself. Potter flinched a little, as if he had forgotten that Draco was there at all, but he kept moving ahead as villagers walked around them. A bubble of laughter came out of the pub and then they were passed it and near the church, where a high, clear voice began to sing;
Hermione cast Malfoy a look of thinly veiled distrust through the conjured projection, and he sneered at her in return. Harry felt like knocking their heads together.
“Are you done with your touching reunion?” Aberforth asked blandly behind them as they broke apart. Harry turned to him, looking relieved.
“OW! ‘Mione!” he shouted, rearing back and throwing his hands up to protect himself, and she screeched.
At three-thirty, they gathered their gowns and headed outside to Disapparate to the Bodleian Library. They crossed Radcliffe Square into the Quadrangle, where some of the short-listed applicants lingered, families and friends gathered as well. Hermione had Ron’s hand in a tight hold as she led them through to the College, and they managed to squeeze into the filled hall, the air alive with nervous energy.
The elf led him to the very back of the kitchen, next to the large fireplace, where he pressed a little knot of wood on one of the towering jambs. It sprang outwards, revealing a tall but narrow doorway.
“Please, Draco, try!” he said, and Draco withdrew his own hawthorn wand. He pointed it at the splintered centre of Potter’s wand and breathed.
“I have my wand here,” Hermione said, lifting it. She rolled her eyes. “I don’t know what rumours you have been listening to Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.”
"They've found something, Sir," she said and Harry was following her outside into the bullpen in a second, his heart racing. Malfoy appeared from wherever he had stormed off to, and as Harry walked past, he reached for him. Harry didn't hesitate and took Malfoy's hand in his own, lacing their fingers together and squeezing tightly. Malfoy held on just as tight.
“Well… Why don’t you give it one more go?” he suggested and Draco ran a hand through to his hair and then lurched away from the alcove. Potter stepped back and crossed his arms over his chest, the pale wood wand dangling loosely between his fingertips.
“Yes, it did,” he said. “I wouldn’t have asked you to keep holding on if it didn’t,” he said and Potter made a face, as if confused.
so much in those first few weeks, shrieks and weak hiccuping sobs of “Papa', their faces red and tear-stained. But Harry had pushed through and stopped mentioning Malfoy to the boys until eventually, one day, they stopped asking. And Harry had never found the right time to tell them.
“So you don’t believe it then?” Weasley asked from behind him and Draco kept his eyes trained on his book, even as his shoulders tightened.
They landed outside the Manor gates roughly, and Draco staggered into Dean a little bit. One of the Snatchers had broken from the group already, and was pulling at the gates.
“You-Kn0w-Who’s Mother was the last surviving Gaunt,” she said and she tapped at the bottom of the tree. ‘
“Get help!” he snapped but Ron was still standing next to Hermione, who looked like she was trying to get to her feet.
places," she told them cryptically. Draco went a little pale but nodded to himself and thanked his Grandmother quietly. He turned to the Aurors, Harry, Ron and Hermione and nodded.
The dungeons were just as he remembered them, cold and damp. He found the corridor and sidled up to the stretch of stone wall that was the hidden entrance. Distantly, he could hear water dripping from one of the walls. He pressed his fingers into the stone and tried to think.
’s no good! RUN!” he shouted, dragging Harry after him as the flames began to climb higher and higher, illuminating the shadows in the room's high ceiling. Crabbe quickly caught up with them, and so had the consequences of his actions – flames consumed the junk on either side of them, crumbling piles of centuries old debris into ash at the merest touch. It changed form, turning into a knot of serpents, a Chimaera, a dragon, all of them devouring anything in their path. Draco rounded a corner and spotted their salvation.
“He knows,” he told them, and Hermione went pale. “He knows, and he’s going to check where the others are, and the last one is at Hogwarts,” he said with conviction. “I knew it. I
. Draco wanted to watch but pushing Potter aside risked catching Bellatrix’s attention, which was the last thing he wanted. “And now, we call the Dark Lord!” and before anyone could move, Draco’s arm began to sear with pain and Potter staggered backwards, suddenly white as a sheet. Draco couldn’t hear, so great was the pain in his arm and Potter seemed senseless, slowly sliding to the floor with all of his weight on Draco, his eyes rolled into the back of his head. Draco staggered under his weight and helped to lower Potter to the ground, touching his bare arm in an attempt to soothe his own pain. It abated somewhat, but he heard the last part of what Bellatrix said.
"Put her through, Belinda, thank you," Harry said and the floo flared and crackled before McGonagall's head appeared. Harry smiled at her. "Headmistress. How can I help you? It's a bit early in the school year for the boys to be getting into trouble, isn't it? They've not even arrived at Hogwarts," he said, jokingly, but the humour died in his throat when he took in McGonagall's pale face.
“Were you sleeping, Draco?” the Dark Lord hissed above him and Draco pushed himself onto his knees, inclining his head. He hadn’t seen his parents in that brief look around the room.
“Yes, help yourself,” Draco said, hoping his voice didn’t sound too strangled. “There’s some honey left,” and then he stood, letting the blanket fall from his lap onto the floor. Potter watched him stand and Draco couldn’t bring himself to look at him, heading for the pile of the books on the dining table instead and choosing one at random to lose himself in.
“Darling?” Mother asked, cautiously pecking her husband on the cheek when he was closer to her. “Shall I get a Pepper-Up Potion for you?” she asked and even though Draco couldn’t see his father’s face, he still saw when the loose line of Father’s shoulders went rigid. His mother’s smile went taut at the edges, but she didn’t step away.
“But I’m good! Papa–” Lilyana turned to her father and complained loudly in rapid Bulgarian, but he only smiled at her.
“Thank you, Dobby. Lead the way,” he said and with a nod of the head, Dobby led him out of the kitchens and into the dark passageway.
“Tryouts will be in the third week of September, so keep practising,” Harry said with a grin, now Gryffindor Head of House.
“Ready?” she whispered and he squeezed her hand and they turned, stepping into that sucking blackness before landing in a new clearing.
What followed was a series of letters that Harry couldn’t have predicted, even with one of Trelawney’s most polished crystal balls. Whichever poor Owl was having to transport their letters was hopefully getting fed well, given that as soon as Harry received a reply from Malfoy (thanking him for sending over the papers and also insisting that the book was not a loan, but a gift), he was writing back the next day. On and on it went, letter after letter, Harry’s indifference for Malfoy thawing into something more.
Whether it was the wine or the bolstered mood from the evening's events, Dean and Weasley managed to slip off to sleep easily enough while Draco still lay awake. He turned on his side, looking to where Harry lay and found that Harry was watching him too.
“They’re in the dungeons. You remember where they are, right?” he asked, sounding relieved even to himself, but Dobby didn’t even so much as blink, just nodded. From the dining room, Hermione screamed again. Draco thought quickly. “Go to Harry now and help him. Then come find me,” Draco said, and though Dobby opened his mouth to protest, Draco didn’t wait for his response. He walked quietly to the library door, missing the squeaky floorboard by the corner of the door, and took a hold of the knob, turning it slowly until the door quietly clicked open. The screams sounded louder now without the door shut and Draco had to steel himself for what might await him.
"And what - wait all this time to kidnap our children?" Malfoy asked - Hermione shot him a cool glance over her shoulder, and then turned back to Harry.
“Come, into the drawing room, there is better light,” Mother told the group, gesturing down the hallway to where another door stood open. She looped her arm around Draco’s and led the way into the room. It was the same as it had always been, the crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling, the purple walls lined with portraits. A few of them eyed Draco skeptically as a figure rose from the chairs in front of the fireplace. His father.
“The office is currently occupied,” it replied, without actually answering the question. Draco had to assume it meant that Harry was in there, and with a huff, he sat down next to the entrance. The gargoyle peered at him out of the corner of its eyes but then snapped them closed again.
He stopped just off one of the paths for a sandwich after an hour or two of wandering aimlessly and snatched up a map that had been left on the ground. He scanned the map and key, trying to find a hint of where he was, but then he saw, labelled in the lower part of the map, ‘
“I know these names,” he said, pointing at one branch. “The Gaunt family died out years ago, though,” he said and Hermione gave him a side-long look. He raised his eyebrow at her. “What?” he asked and she sighed and then turned the genealogy book to face him.
“Well, you seem to be alright to me Mr Malfoy, if a bit tired. Have a lie down, why don’t you? Off you go Mr Zabini, Mr Malfoy doesn’t need a babysitter,” Pomfrey said, shooing Blaise away. Blaise rolled his eyes but gave Draco a parting nod and then left. Pomfrey turned to face Draco, who froze at the look of barely controlled fury on her face.
“That’s him,” he said reassuringly and he slumped a little, hand pressed to his chest where his heart raced as Potter emerged from the trees, Draco’s lit wand held in front of him like a torch. And behind him –
“Didn’t you hear?” Blaise drawled, looking at the Hufflepuffs out of the corner of his eyes. “One of their lot has gone missing. Caroline Purvis, Mudblood girl,” he sneered and one of the Hufflepuffs caught Draco’s eye. He looked away before Draco could react, shrinking back into the group.
“I need to tell you all what I saw,” Harry said after a moment of silence, and as they walked, he began to talk. Draco listened, rapt, as Harry explained what Snape’s memories had revealed to him in the Pensieve. How his mother, Lily, had been childhood friends with Snape. How, when Snape had discovered that Lily, her husband James and her newborn son Harry, had been targeted, he had gone to Dumbledore to plead for Lily’s life, and the deal had been struck.
“So, what brings you to Diagon Alley this early, Bellatrix?” Travers asked and Hermione cast a glance at the Gringotts building in the distance.
!” he shouted, pointing his wand and there was a flash of red light before Fenrir paused in his steps. He choked, once, twice, gagged and then vomited up black bile. Draco lept back as Ron yelped, and Fenrir continued to gag and vomit, black bile turning red as things began to emerge from his throat and mouth, red ropes of flesh. His skin turned grey and clammy and then his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he collapsed sideways onto the stone floor, dead, surrounded by a pool of his own blood, choked on his own entrails.
Draco, not knowing where the trio was, dived behind a low stone wall, and pressed his back to it, his heart hammering. A Caterwauling Charm. He cursed quietly to himself even as one of the Death Eaters called “
"We'll find them, Harry," he said, his voice rough with emotion. "We can't… We'll find them," and he nodded, a look of grim determination on his face.
He pulled out a pair of pyjamas trousers, a t-shirt and a thick-knit cardigan, because the mornings were getting colder again, grabbed a spare toothbrush and toothpaste from under the ensuite bathroom sink, and then headed back downstairs, all items tucked under his arm. The guest room door was ajar, but Harry knocked anyway, before pushing open the door.
“Not now, Father. I think these Aurors want to talk to you,” Draco said, pointing them out. His parents froze where they sat and Draco gave them a gentle look. “You cannot run from this. You cannot hide. I’ll speak to Harry, he might be able to ask Shacklebolt for some leniency, but – you did this. There are consequences,” he said and his father’s jaw tightened while his mother’s eyes welled with tears. Draco felt pity – and love – tug at him. He slipped off the table as the Aurors approached. “I love you both,” he added and his mother sniffed, patting his arm.
“I’m going to sit here for a minute,” he said in a pained tone of voice, closing his eyes and dropping his head back. Potter gave him a long look and then sighed.
“Lucius, stop,” she told him firmly and he waved her away, sending his crystal tumbler crashing to the floor, where it shattered. He stood up heavily, and the glass crunched underneath his boot.
“You certainly did. Now,” Harry closed the book and set it neatly down next to the tray of tea things. “Kiss me again,” and Draco was still laughing when Harry brought their lips together once more.
“Are you Bathilda?” he asked aloud and Granger slapped a hand to her heart in fright. Draco gripped Potter’s hand in his own tighter. The figure in front of them, still half-silhouetted in the darkness, nodded slowly and then beckoned to them, as if asking them to follow her. The three under the cloak looked at each other but finally Granger gave one single, nervous, nod.
“Griphook of the Goblins!” he shouted over the crackle of spells going from around him. “Thrice I curse you, Griphook, for this betrayal. I curse you, I curse your blood, I curse your line. Thrice I curse you, thrice I curse you!” he shouted and Griphook, surrounded by his fellow goblins, bared his teeth but Draco felt the hum of blood magic in the room and seemingly, Griphook did too because his expression faltered. For his betrayal, Draco had placed a blood curse on Griphook.
“I suppose that’s that, then,” Hermione said, stopping her twisting with a sigh. Harry nodded, looking around the room at the other applicants, some of whom looked relieved, others tearful, all of them exhausted. Malfoy looked up and around and then straightened, pulling his suit jacket straight.
“He was duelling Dolohov! Haven’t seen him since,” he told her as he went and then Ginny was turning, her words dying on her lips as Nymphadora ran off after Aberforth. She turned to them, helpless, but Harry was already pacing in front of the blank stretch of wall in front of them.
“Forest of Dean,” Hermione said over her shoulder as Potter stood in the centre of the clearing, his hands limp at his sides. Without his wand, he couldn’t help raise the wards, and Draco turned away, shame gnawing at his insides. It felt like a betrayal to use his wand in front of Potter, who looked awkward and a little sad. Hermione continued talking, as though trying to fill the silence. “Mum and Dad brought me here years ago. We camped for the weekend,” her voice caught a little but she continued with the wards.
“You can when it’s built. Why don’t we go get a hot chocolate down by the lake, hmm?” he said placatingly, though his wife shot him a dismayed look. He shrugged one shoulder, jostling the baby that was gripping his hair in white-knuckled fists and the family took off again, leaving Draco alone at the site.
“Saturday, actually,” he said, raising his eyebrows. He jotted down a note on some spare paper to remind himself to organise a Portkey.
“Glad you came to your senses,” she told him loftily and Harry gaped at her as she took another sip of wine.
at me. What did I do wrong?” he asked, sounding pathetic to even his own ears. Potter makes a small noise.
, Draco,” he snapped as Draco threatened to fall over. “Don’t look, don’t look, close your eyes,” Blaise murmured, dragging Draco’s forearm forward to see it by the light of the fire. Draco caught a glimpse of ruined, red flesh before he turned away, gagging. “Don’t you
“I’d take you to Madam Pomfrey, but they’ve summoned everyone to the Great Hall. These louts,” he kicked again at Goyle, who moaned. “Weren’t in the line, so I came back for them. Thought they might have slept through Slughorn waking everyone up. I’m sorry I wasn’t faster,” he added and Draco patted him on the shoulder.
Potter trudged grudgingly back through the snow as Draco reached Granger, crouching down beside her.
subject, comes from the fact that I’m trying to understand myself. I am.. I’m trying to reconcile what I know to be true with my own experiences - and they don't always add up - and why I am who I am after all that’s happened me. I feel that by knowing my history, by knowing
There was a crack behind them and Draco hobbled over to take Harry’s hand, to pull him back to reality.
“Lovegood told us some story about how the Tale of the Three Brothers was a true story and that the – what was it Hermione, gifts from death? – were actual magical artifacts scattered around, called the Deathly Hallows, and if someone found them, they would be the
Rain was falling harder now and the sky was darkening with the night. He found his way out of Wistman’s Wood, following the small track back out into the open fields and found a flat patch of grass nearby, sheltered from the wind. He set down his backpack and with another look around to see if any Muggles were watching, he took his wand out and began casting wards.
a Mudblood. She’s the brightest witch of our age. She’ll be Minister one day, given half a chance,” and then he smiled and nearly laughed, aware that he looked a bit manic, his eyes bright and his cheeks suddenly flushed. “And I can’t wait!” He told them and he enjoyed a second of their stunned expressions before brandishing his mother’s wand that he had slipped from the belt around her waist. “Sorry Mother –
“It seems like a reasonable boundary. You would be on opposite sides of the world, that would be hard for anyone,” she said and Harry took a gulp of ale. It wasn’t something he wanted to discuss, really, though he could understand his friend’s curiosity.
“Where’d you get that?” Granger said, covering her mouth with one hand as she spoke, having just taken a bite of her sandwich.
“Do you think we could try again, Harry?” Cameron asked, and Harry felt himself deflate. Cameron bit his bottom lip and looked up at Harry through his eyelashes. “I’ve missed you,” he said softly, edging a hand out towards where Harry’s was resting, pen held lightly in his hand from where he had been writing out the reply to Draco’s letter.
“I’ll let you go Hermione, I’m sorry for waking you. I’ll see you Friday?” he said and she sighed and bid him a good night and gave another congratulations before they both hung up. Harry grinned at the letter in front of him, the one that put him one step closer to his goal.
“You know, I’m not sure. I don’t even know where he was interred… If it had been in the Black family crypt, we would have been asked to attend, I’m sure,” she said with a frown. She looked at him and tilted her head slightly. “Why so many questions, darling?” she asked, and Draco took a chance and pushed on.
Yes, he was scared of the Dark Lord. Draco’s failure at the end of the last school year had failed to please him, and he made sure Draco knew it. Draco was made to know it – until his throat was raw from screaming, and his eyes were bloodshot from burst vessels, and his muscles quivered and ached.
“‘old him,” Crabbe told Goyle, who left Draco’s legs and went to pin one of his arms down. Roughly Crabbe yanked his sleeve back, exposing the forearm with the Dark Mark, which stood out starkly in the light of the common room. Draco didn’t realise what was going to happen until he saw a flash of silver in Crabbe’s hand and then he was screaming.
"They're in the mirror," Draco said quietly, firmly, and for a second Harry felt like he had eleven years ago, when he had found Draco lying flat on the floor, staring at the blue patterned wallpaper of their room, telling Harry in muffled whispers that a woman was trapped behind it, and she needed to get out. Draco looked over at Harry and took a deep breath. "The Mirror - it's enchanted. It used to be an escape route, during the witch hunts. Those of Malfoy blood can enter the Mirror and be kept in a safe space. He'll be keeping them in there," he said and Harry nodded, stepping up to stand next to Draco. He shook his head. "You can't come through with me, Harry. I have to go alone," he told him quietly, and Harry felt himself go pale.
“Well? Is it the true sword?” she asked, and there was a creak of floorboard behind him. He whirled around, wand raised, but Potter put a finger to his lips and Draco nearly sagged with relief. Weasley was directly behind him, his lower face still dark with dried blood.
“I long suspected what he might have become. What he had been. We all must live with our demons, Mr Malfoy. Well –” He raised his arms then, and the chains rattled in the empty room. “Some of us must die with them,” he added mournfully and Draco studied him, contemplative.
The room was cast in ghostly green light from the lamps that were positioned around the room. The fire was low but still sparked and crackled, and the dungeon was thankfully empty. Draco crept further in and surveyed the room.
"I think the writer of this message means children who cannot be recovered, by choice," he said and something clicked together in Harry's mind.
“You mean he was weak!” Voldemort shrieked, and the hairs on the back of Draco’s neck stood on end. “Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!”
“It’s somewhere in here!” he shouted, pointing at a pile of junk. “Look for it while I go and help Ron–” he said but then Hermione screamed “HARRY!” and they turned to look. Crabbe was barrelling down the aisle, Ron just ahead of him, and tendrils of flame fell out of his wand as he waved it, sneering.
“The Portkey was alright,” Harry said with a shrug. “Had a layover in Dubai, it doesn’t leave a lot of time for the jet-lag to settle,” he added, finally acknowledging how tired he really was. He had a look at his watch - it was nearly 5am in Melbourne, and Harry’s head swam. Hermione entered the living room with a few bottles of pale ale in her hands, one of which she passed to Harry before settling down on the chair of the sofa behind Ron, giving one of the other bottles to him.
The statue was obviously of James and Lily Potter with their son. He wondered if it had been carved from a reference, because he could see the resemblance to Potter in those stone faces. James’ nose with Lily’s chin. His hair with her eyes. Potter stood in silence, Granger on his arm, his eyes scanning over every inch of the stone, as if absorbing it to memory.
Crabbe dug the knife into Draco’s forearm, dragging it, slicing him open. Draco screamed in agony and Goyle clapped a hand over his mouth, stifling him. Crabbe’s tongue was poking out from between his lips as he concentrated and Draco kicked his legs, trying to find purchase on the cold stone floor. He tried bucking Crabbe off, but he didn’t so much as sway and all the while the hot blade of the silver knife carved into his arm again and again.
“I wonder if that old bag McGonagall is going to stay on as Headmistress?” she asked and Blaise rolled one shoulder in a sort of shrug. Pansy turned expectantly to Draco. “What do you think?” she asked and Draco tampered down the memories of whispered conversations between Death Eaters, of the signed letter he had received weeks ago.
“Sometimes,” Potter admitted with a shrug. The smile fell from his mouth and he looked distant for a moment, his eyes unfocused, “Sometimes I have nightmares about you dying on a bathroom floor. They’re horrible. Ron says I wake him up because I shout in my sleep,” he replied in such a nonchalant manner that Draco was a little horrified. He didn’t remember much of the Sectumsempra curse, only the searing pain across his chest and then Severus kneeling over him, panicking and hiding it. Beyond that, his brain had blocked it out.
"An old family - probably one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, or a branch of one. Someone to whom family history, and an heir, would be highly important," he explained and Ginny nodded, picking a few files out of the various ones dotted around the room. She passed them around, until everyone but Harry and Malfoy had a few files sat on their laps.
“It is. An enchanted map. My dad made it with some friends while he was at Hogwarts,” he explained and Draco made an appreciative noise. It was an impressive display of magic.
) and opened to the last chapter he had been reading, picking up where he left off, reading about John Dee. He tucked himself into a corner of the sofa and settled in to read until his mind calmed down, but looked up when he heard the living room door open. Ron entered, his red hair a riot, rubbing his eyes, before blinking blearily at Harry.
“Your mother tells me that you haven’t been sleeping well,” Snape started in a conversational tone and Draco scowled at him.
“Draco! Are you quite well?” Blaise was kneeling next to him and Draco gasped awake, lying on the cold slate of the Slytherin common room. The two hours of sleep from the night before had finally caught up with him, and he had fallen asleep in the free period after lunch. The room was mostly empty around them, a few fourth-years on another free period looking over curiously, but they snapped their attention away as Blaise turned to look at them, his eyes narrowed, slitted like a snake’s. “Up you get, Draco. Let’s take you to the hospital wing. You must’ve inhaled something odd during our Potions lesson,” Blaise said, offering an excuse for the moment of weakness, and Draco nodded along. Blaise gripped his hand and pulled him to his feet.
“Wait,” Mother said, stepping closer. “Yes – yes, she was in Madam Malkin’s with Potter! I saw her picture in the
Hermione was right, Ron was waiting up for them when they walked through the front door of Grimmauld Place. Harry was stunned momentarily by the transformation while Hermione swept off into the kitchen at the end of the corridor. Gone was the mottled wallpaper and shrieking portrait of Mrs Black, replaced by clean white walls and an artfully placed botanical print. A neat shoe rack was to one side of the doorway, and Harry toed off his shoes and placed them in an empty space, padding along the dark hardwood floors until he came to what was previously the drawing room and was now a very comfortable looking living room, complete with muggle TV in the corner. Ron looked up and around from the football match he was currently watching and his face split into a grin upon seeing Harry.
“I don't want to get married until I finish my MaD, at least. Especially if I get the Fellowship! Ron respects that, and he figures it means we can save up a bit more for a family when we're ready,” she explained and Harry nodded.
“So what?” Aberforth bellowed. The group of Death Eaters took another step back and Draco took the opportunity to dart around the wall and into one of the side streets. “So what? You send Dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus back at ‘em! I’m not having ‘em near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not having it,” Aberforth shouted.
He was so pale, and still. His eyes were closed, and his head hung limply from his neck, tilted back so that they could all see his face. He looked… serene. At peace. It was awful.
“No,” he groaned, his head starting to loll, his eyes becoming unfocused. “Hermione’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes,” he murmured, and Draco turned around to Ron.
There was a smart rap on the glass door of the Orangery and Draco looked up to see who was disturbing him. He had come to hide amongst the portraits and statues in the Malfoy collection, tucking himself between
“You can see me?” Draco asked into the darkened room and Potter stretched, his t-shirt riding up to expose the soft skin of his lower abdomen. Blood rushed to Draco’s cheeks and he turned away just as Potter rolled his shoulders.
Their fellow candidates were huddled together in the atrium of the examination hall, and it reminded Harry strongly of that first night at Hogwarts, the new first-years crowded together in the portrait room off the Great Hall, waiting for their turn to be Sorted. Especially since they were all wearing gowns. He spotted Malfoy in a corner, frowning at something in the middle distance, but he and Hermione didn’t go over to say ‘hello’. Malfoy’s gown was drawn tight around him, almost like he was trying to hide in it, though Harry could guess at the reason why. His own emotions were fraught, anxiety clawing at his chest like an overenthusiastic pet.
“Easy enough to check,” Scabior said. “But the ‘old lot of ‘em look like they could still be ‘Ogwarts age-”
Eventually Lupin had to leave. He fished his travelling cloak, still damp, from the coat hooks and waved at them while Fleur went to open the door. “Goodbye, goodbye – I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few days’ time – they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you-” he said, stepping forward to accept hugs from the women and hand shakes from the men before giving them one more cheery wave and disappearing out of the door into the stormy night.
“Check the list, Scabior,” and the Snatcher to Draco’s left pulled a scroll of parchment out of his robes. Greyback rounded on Weasley, taking a rough grip on his chin and forcing his head up. Draco saw his nostrils flare when the scent of blood hit them. “And what about you, Ginger?” he asked.
It was another night of lying wide awake on the sitting room floor Ron was snoring at his feet, Dean finally still and silent on the sofa and Potter, dead to the world, next to the sofa and at Draco’s head. One of the hallway clocks chimed for 3 in the morning when Draco decided to slip out of his sleeping bag and go to the kitchen. Fleur’s recipe books were on a shelf next to the small kitchen table and Draco picked one at random to flick through. Bill had gone on a reconnaissance mission to the tent site and had recovered a few books and some of their clothes, but had told them most of it had been destroyed.
Without a fire to warm them, they retreated into the tent. The paperbag, looking worse for wear now after months being carried around in Draco’s increasingly dirty backpack, provided them with stew and warm bread for dinner, and then Potter stood up.
,” he said and he opened his eyes as a swirl of silver mist rose from his wand. It didn’t take shape but lingered for a few minutes before fading away. Draco, smiling, turned back to look at Potter who gave him a pleased look.
Left upstairs alone with Scorpius' trunk balanced in front of him, and Albus' just inside his room (Draco could see the leather of the trunk just inside the doorway), he took a moment to reflect on what his life was now compared to what it had been a year ago.
On the next floor up, Draco turned a left and followed a dark hallway to the end, and then up another set of stairs, this one narrow and winding. He did not stop and he didn't look back and Harry jogged to keep up with him, his heart in his throat with the feeling that with every turn, he'd find his sons.
“Draco!” Hermione gasped from one of the upholstered armchairs and Harry turned from where he had been studying the portrait, taking the few steps needed to fling his arms around Draco’s neck and kiss him before pulling away to hug him in relief.
“I didn’t know him. We never met. But, thank you,” he added and she gave him a small smile. If she had noticed Potter’s thumb still stroking along the skin at his hip, she didn’t give it away.
His mother was telling him to run, and to run now. He would be dead if he returned to the Manor, and she was giving him permission to flee. He took a deep, shuddering breath and then pushed away from the wall and ran for the kitchens. He had to go, now!
“Am I dreaming again?” Draco asked, realising after it left his mouth that the question was stupid. Of course he was dreaming again, but what he had meant to say was, is this one of those dreams? The dreams that had led him to Harry. Dumbledore only smiled.
He sipped his wine and listened to the conversation again, reaching a hand under the table to take Potter’s in his own. Potter’s hand squeezed his tightly and they sat like that as Lupin recounted the birth of his son to the dining table. Bill opened another bottle as Lupin spoke and topped off his glass with Lupin’s agreement, and Potter leaned over.
“No!” Mrs Weasley cried as some students tried to step in to help, all of them jumping back both at the sound of her voice and the heat of the spells, which turned the floor hot around them. “Get back!
is the current password. Make sure the Prefects know, will you?” and with that, Slughorn toddled away without another word, Draco staring after him.
you. And I am so – so sorry,” he said, his voice beginning to tremble. Ron had deflated and Hermione wrapped an arm around him. Draco turned to Percy, who was rocking Fred’s body, sobbing. “There’s nothing you can do for him. We need to go,” he said gently and Percy turned tear-filled eyes to him.
“Join me?” Snape asked, gesturing to the pair of upholstered chairs that were framed by the nasturtium that Draco’s mother cultivated. The orange and yellow blossoms swayed in the small breeze coming through the windows, and Draco settled himself into the chair facing the door, slipping his finger free of his book and holding it shut in his lap – if Snape noticed his deliberate choice of seat, he didn’t comment as he folded himself into the opposite chair, gathering his habitual black robes around him.
Draco’s heart stuttered a little bit. He had barely spoken to his professor since that night on the Astronomy Tower, when Snape had to do what Draco could not, and Snape seemed to go out of his way to avoid him now. But there were times like tonight, when their paths had to cross.
On and on he went, replacing things just as he had found them before moving on to the next spot. He was fully absorbed in turning the lamp on the lake wall just right in order to engage the lock that swung open on the fireplace pillars, and he did not notice he was not alone until he heard a throat clear behind him.
A year ago, he had received a Patronus. The large silver stag had barrelled into his workshop on la Rue de la Tremoille, and gave him Harry's message. "
"Well, we got them on the train. That's a whole lot better than last year," he said and Harry jostled his shoulder a bit, but they both look relieved.
The Astronomy Tower again. The Dark Mark bright in the sky over Hogwarts, drowning out the stars. The lake was black and still in the distance, the breeze cool. He clenched his eyes shut and tried to wake up. Lost in the dreamspace, Draco tried to break free, tried to return to Harry, in whose arms he had fallen asleep. He hadn’t had this dream in so long. He did not want to witness it again.
, forgive myself for that night. And if you think he wasn’t capable of change, what do you think about me really?” he asked and before he could say anything further, he turned on his heel and stormed back into the tent, locking himself into the small bathroom and tucking himself in between the sink and the bath, making himself as small as possible while he cried into his arms.
"McGonagall asked him to go into work today. He tried to explain that he was helping us here, but she was insistent. He sends his apologies," she explained, and Harry nodded, settling himself into his armchair. Hermione and Ginny took the chairs opposite, while Luna cleared a space for herself on the sofa and settled in next to Malfoy, tucking her legs underneath her.
“Absolutely I will! You can’t! He’ll kill you!” Draco said, and Harry only blinked at him. Draco stepped closer, and felt his throat constrict with the weight of the words he needed to say. He blinked rapidly as he reached for Harry’s face, taking his cheek in one hand. Harry closed his eyes and leaned into the touch and Draco thought his heart would burst. “Please don’t leave me here alone,” he whispered and Harry turned his face to press his lips softly to Draco’s palm and Draco thought he would burst. “I love you. Please don’t leave,” he said and Harry opened his eyes. The green was piercing in the early dawn light that came from the shattered windows.
“He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arrange the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant,”
He would be summoned down for dinner soon. He couldn’t pretend to be ill tonight, it was too important. He would be expected to sit at the dinner table which had once been polished to a mirror-shine but now looked grimy and smudged, and make pleasant conversation and then, eventually, the Dark Lord would appear and he would have to spend the rest of his time at the table trying not to throw up out of sheer fear.
The snowy lane curved to the left as they walked and the heart of the village appeared out of the snowy air. Strung all around with coloured lights was a war memorial in the middle of the square, a windblown Christmas tree half-leaning on it. There were several Muggle shops, a pub with warm inviting lights named ‘
Both boys had been face-down in the tub. With a strangled shout, Harry had pulled them both out and taken them both straight to St. Mungos, ripping apart the Anti-Apparition wards all over Grimmauld Place. Both boys had been saved just in time, the Healer had told him.
,” Greyback’s boots cracked as he crouched in front of Hermione, who Draco could see out of the corner of his eye.
He rounded the final corner and Goyle’s wand was on him – he held up his hands, much like Hermione had done in front of him, facing down Crabbe’s wand.
They were playing a game of sorts, Draco realised – edging around each other, waiting for the other to strike or give ground. It was very Slytherin of her, and he suddenly deeply missed the Slytherin common room, and felt a hot flush of shame as tears welled into his eyes. He blinked rapidly and Granger frowned, her wand twitching in her hand.
He remembered how he tightened his hold on his wand to stop himself from falling to his knees and begging for it. His arm still shook. “No, you can’t. Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got to do it,” he repeated it like a mantra –
“So, you were studying in France?” Hermione asked, lifting the pint that Harry had bought her to her mouth. Malfoy nodded, pouring the last of the contents of the can into the glass carefully, like he was measuring out a potions ingredients. He looked up once he was done, setting the empty can to one side. Every moment was careful and calculated, Harry realised. Malfoy never made a move without it being deliberate.
The Leaky Cauldron was nearly empty. A pair of warlocks were quietly talking in a shadowed corner of the bar but drew back when they saw Hermione enter, and Tom the barman nearly dropped the glass he was polishing with a grey cloth.
“Luna’s father. He betrayed us,” he said in a strained voice. Draco withdrew his wand from his jeans and touched it gently to Potter’s forehead, muttering
Potter brought up the rear, ducking into the tent, the Shield Charm gone. He looked soaked through and he shivered violently as he looked around, spotting Draco sitting on the bed. He obviously thought for a second, but then decided to head for Draco, sitting next to him on the bunk, plucking one of the blankets from the foot of his bed up and wrapping it around himself. Still shivering, he handed over Draco’s wand and said, with chattering teeth, “If it looks like Hermione’s about to jinx him, cast P
“Most of them. There’s usually a preference. Slytherins marry Slytherins, Gryffindors marry Gryffindors, that sort of thing,” he said and Hermione widened her eyes. “You marry someone with the same values as your family, that’s all it is,” he said, a touch defensively and she sniffed.
There was a terrible screaming noise and Draco realised that it was coming from Percy, who was shaking the body of his brother, keening and Ron was kneeling silent next to them, still as a statue. And there was Harry, staring dumbly at the place where Fred lay, his eyes wide and his expression dumbstruck, like he could not understand what he was seeing.
“Griphook has agreed to get us into Gringotts,” Weasley said in a dull voice, not like the jubilant one Draco would’ve expected from this news.
scissors!” she snapped and a pair of silver scissors came flying out of the bag into her hand. Draco tried to hold Potter still as she cut through the shirt and jumper quickly.
Warding the door with a whisper to the House, Draco sat in the armchair by the fireplace and waited for the shaking to subside. It took a few minutes but eventually his muscles went still and he could take deep, even breaths. He reached for the bell pull by the fireplace and gave it a small tug, and an elf appeared in his room with a
A decision was made. The bound group were hauled to their feet and surrounded by Snatchers, held tight to prevent escape. “On three, then,” Greyback shouted to the group, his hand fisted in Potter’s hair. “One, two – three!” and with an awful squeezing sensation, they were taken away.
“He’s with us. He’s been travelling with us for months now, helping,” Hermione said firmly and Ron puffed up his chest.
"Are you looking forward to going?" he asked him, and Hugo gave him a wide-eyed terrified look, but didn't respond. Hermione gave his shoulder an encouraging squeeze.
Draco felt someone pull on his arm but he tried to shake them off. They pulled harder and he looked up to see Ron and Hermione’s tear-stained faces looking down at him.
Whatever rules there had been between good and evil magic were apparently forgotten tonight as all around them, Death Eaters and Protectors of Hogwarts alike used whatever means necessary to win. Somewhere, distantly, Draco could hear his name being screamed, but he ignored it. His parents could wait.
“So that’s what the locket is,” Draco interrupted and Potter nodded, pressing his free hand to his eyes.
As the hikers and the cyclists and the day-trippers started to appear along the forest trails, he strained to hear their conversation as he went past, listening for any mention of someone who might fit the description of Potter or Granger. He was about to head back down to the lake when he passed a young family walking in the opposite direction.
“It’ll be here soon. You should go,” he said, letting go of Draco’s arm and touching his shoulder, nudging him backwards until Draco went to lie flat and then fell through the dream, waking with a start.
“Harry?” Granger called, heading for the bottom of the stairs. There was no response, just the sound of something heavy moving overhead. She gave Draco a bewildered look and he nodded, following behind her as she slowly climbed the stairs. She raised her wand and the tip lit with a low light as they reached the top of the landing. Several doors lined the hallway ahead of them and Draco reached for his own wand, twirling it in the air – the gas lights on either side of the landing lit up. He gave Granger a confused look until another sound reached them, a low moan like something was having the air forced out of it.
!” Scabior was saying and the ropes that bound their hands suddenly went taut as Potter moved behind him. Draco tried to see what was going on, but he couldn’t turn his head far enough. Scabior continued. “‘
After five minutes or so, a flare of silver sparks flew up from in front of the Manor, and Begbie called at them all to "Move!", so Harry took off at a run along with the Aurors. They skirted around the hedge, coming to the large wrought iron gates, which were now twisted and charred, and in a few select places, still smouldering. Harry ducked through them, Draco just behind him, and they ran up the gravel driveway with the Aurors, Hermione and Ron following suit.
Mrs Weasley, for all her maternal charm, was a fierce dueller. Her wand twirled and spun in her hand, and curses blazed before Bellatrix could ever think to respond. The air was alight with gold, green, blue, red streams of light and Bellatrix’s smile wavered, turning into more of a snarl.
). There was a small star next to her name and when Draco looked at the bottom of the list, a little box told him that symbol meant that she was of
“He literally just summoned a goat Patronus outside, Ron,” Draco said exasperatedly and Ron deflated a little. Aberforth gave Draco an amused look.
“Will I be able to try out when I join?” Lilyana Krum asked. The same age as Hugo, she wasn’t old enough for Hogwarts yet, but she had a Seeker’s build already. Her mother hummed and smoothed back her long red hair.
“Let’s go, let’s get out!” Ron shouted, flying past. Hermione was holding tightly to him, her face hidden in between his shoulder blades and she shrieked as Ron lurched slightly as a hot current of air hit them.
"Mr. P," another voice said from behind him, and Harry looked over his shoulder. Belinda was there - firm, kind, gentle Belinda, who reminded him of Mrs Weasley, who brought him endless cups of tea or coffee, and lunch when he forgot it, and shared the stories of her boys when they were teenagers so that Harry felt less alone than he really was. She reached out a hand and placed it on his forearm, and Harry let go of Thompson's robes, the other man staggered back into his desk, sheets of parchment spilling off onto the floor. "Let's go to your office, love. Have a cuppa, I've called Minister Granger and Mr Weasley on the floo, they'll be over any minute,"
“Professor Carrow is joined by her brother who will be taking over my duties as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. I am sure you will all be most attentive in their classes,” Snape said with a hint of a threat to his voice. Amycus stood as well, head-and-shoulders above his sister, but like her, he received no applause. Snape cleared his throat. “As I am required to remain impartial as Headmaster, Professor Slughorn has the honour of returning to his position as Head of House for Slytherin as of this year,” he added and Slughorn gave a jolly wave from his seat. There was polite applause from the Slytherin table, tempered with some disappointed sighs. Slughorn was not nearly as lenient as Snape had been as a professor.
"I must admit, I haven't seen them. Truthfully, I have no idea where they might be. My reach is not as far as it used to be," he said, looking over at them both. Harry visibly deflated. "Tell me what you know, Harry, and I will listen," Dumbledore offered, and Harry took his hand away from his mouth to explain what had happened.
He had settled himself in for another night, wards raised and fire doused, and had fallen into another fitful sleep when Potter came to him. The dream, which had been so empty only a moment prior, flooded with warmth that soothed Draco’s frayed emotions as Potter rounded a thatch of gorse in the recreated Alice Holt Forest where Draco had set up for the night.
There was confusion on the motorbike, though Draco couldn’t hear what Potter and the Gamekeeper were shouting to each other over the roar of the air flying past and the engine of the motorbike. Potter managed to turn himself around on the seat, fisting the half-giant’s jacket tightly to hold himself on. With another burst of white-blue fire, the motorbike lurched forward in the air and Draco dove after them, eager to keep up.
The group moved on, hollering and shouting, but Draco stayed in his alcove until the house went silent around him. They had gone. He looked over at the stained glass windows above the large open foyer and saw the final rays of the sun disappear over the horizon.
“He just wants to find them,” Granger whispered to Draco, and he made a small noise of understanding. She looked up, over the graves to Potter winding his way through the rows, looking like some sort of spectre in the darkness. She wiped a hand under her eye and he made a small soothing noise.
“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” Bellatrix taunted and Draco turned his attention back to her. She was grinning madly, practically dancing around the curses that Mrs Weasley fired at her. “When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?” she sneered and Draco couldn’t help himself – he stepped forward.
The roast potatoes had tasted like ash in Draco’s mouth, so he had only managed a few bites before putting his knife and fork down and spending the rest of the dinner staring at the place setting in front of him. Father was on his fourth glass of wine and Mother was delicately picking at the food on her plate, taking small nibbles of everything but barely eating at all.
"I know," he said quietly, comfortingly, and Harry nodded, screwing his eyes shut. From behind them, there was the sound of a throat being cleared. Malfoy glanced back first and rolled his eyes, leaning away from Harry. "Speak of the Devil, and he shall appear," he muttered and Harry looked over - where Madam Hilda usually rested in her high-backed chair, Albus Dumbledore now sat, his fingers interlaced around his middle, his eyes twinkling behind his half-moon glasses.
“-I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety first!” another contributor was saying as Draco re-entered. Potter had moved back to his armchair and so Draco perched on the arm next to him. Potter slid an arm off his lap and around Draco’s back, thumb finding a bit of skin at his hip which Potter stroked lightly, sending jolts of electricity up Draco’s side.
“Well done Harry!” Ron said cheerfully and Harry thanked him. “Hold on, Hermione’s just getting her letter opener,” Ron said in a teasing tone, and Harry could hear Hermione’s snappish reply. Ron laughed. “She wants to preserve the envelope, just in case,” he told Harry, who smiled. There was a pause and then Hermione gave another happy shriek. “She-,” and then there was the sound of a lip-smacking kiss, which made Harry draw back a bit.
“Stupid Gryffindors, you’ve no mind for negotiations, none of you!” he snapped. Potter turned on his heel and led them to go sit on the sofas in front of the fire. From the kitchen was the gentle sound of something simmering in a pot on the stove. “How could you agree to that? We
“Of course it’s me! Where do you think I’ve been these last few months? I'm not doing this for fun,” he said with a sneer and somewhere behind him Potter let out a whimper. Draco steeled himself and ignored it. “You need to take me back to my father,” he added and Greyback looked him up and down, obviously not convinced.
Hermione ate a piece of less burned toast and they both gulped down some tea before heading for the door, Hermione pausing to shout “Love you!” up to Ron at the bottom of the stairs. Ron yelled it back and then after an awkward pause said “And you, Harry!” to which Harry laughed and replied in kind.
"Have you told-?" Hermione asked, and the look Harry gave her caused her to wince. "He might be able to help. You never know," she said placatingly and Harry leaned back onto the sofa heavily. He had spent years, eleven of them exactly, avoiding speaking to
All around them, movement stopped in the hall. Faces were turned towards the entrance hall. Some had gone still, some were crying, others listened in disbelief.
As if in unspoken agreement, they both slipped out of their sleeping bags and padded off to the small utility room off the kitchen. A counter and sink were against one wall and as soon as the door was shut behind them, Harry fell on him, pressing his hot mouth to Draco’s. He tasted of wine and salt and Draco pushed him back against the wood door of the utility room.
“Draco Malfoy, please,” he called and Draco stood, nearly dropping his mug. Harry reached for it and took it off him, smiling at Draco’s grateful look.
“Have you ever seen this symbol before?” she asked, reaching out to tap a small image at the top of the page. The text was in runes but her finger was pointing to a triangular eye with a vertical line down the centre. Draco frowned at it.
“The stag! It’s Potters’!!” one of them crowed while another said, “Who does that ruddy bird belong to?” and there were murmurs of confusion as the search parties returned to the Three Broomsticks. The owl soared past them, straight at the Dementors which fell back and the air turned warm again as the owl and stag turned into silver mist and then disappeared.
“Dumbledore is dead!” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry like they would cause him pain. Harry did not flinch, though Draco had to look away. Yes, Dumbledore was dead – and it was his fault. “His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!”
“Also, this book was in the position of the Ministry of Magic for weeks before I received it. Surely one of them would have recognised a symbol of Dark Magic?” she pointed out and Draco shrugged one shoulder.
“I’m not all that hungry,” he said and while he tried for an air of indifference, it came out more resigned.
“- I meant to, and that’s what did it. I’ve done what my mother did. They’re protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch them. You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?” Harry said and there was a note of pride to his voice. Draco realised the same time that Hermione did that he was right – none of the spells Voldemort had placed on them all had lasted. The Silencing Charm broke twice. Neville could break free of the Body-Bind Curse placed upon him. Harry was right! Hermione’s hand squeezed his own tightly, and they held the truth of Harry’s words close.
"It's a possibility. There have been sightings of someone who looks like him over the years, though, as you know Harry, nothing ever came of it," she said and Harry nodded. While he had still been in the field, he had been sent on a few wild goose chases in order to track down a supposed Death Eater. They only ever caught one or two for every thousand sightings that came in weekly, especially in the later years.
“This way!” Harry shouted, and Draco seized Hermione’s arm and pulled her through the reforming crowd of goblins in Harry’s wake. Harry, in the lead, shot Stunning Spells left and right as Weasley brought up the rear.
Though the boys seemed to enjoy having him around, Draco had not been able to comfort them after their nightmares, during the days following their kidnapping - in the dark, he had looked too much like Lucius, which had caused both boys to rear back in fear. Harry had given him apologetic smiles and comforting kisses, but it still stung, and it hurt even worse to hear them sob and cry and not even be able to comfort them.
“He wasn’t a coward,” Father slurred, taking uneven steps towards Draco, leaning heavily on his chair and then reaching for Draco’s, stumbling that last final bit. He leaned down over his son, his hair swinging forward, until they were nearly touching foreheads. Draco pressed himself back into the armchair, his breathing shallow. “He was a good son, he followed–”
"Where are they, Bel?" he asked her, sounding broken even to his own ears, and she clucked her tongue at him and patted his hand.
“Not as clever as us now,” he said stupidly in reply, and Draco didn’t have the time to pick his way through that sentence. He walked around the sofa to meet them in the middle of the room.
"Och, great! Well, nae time like th' present. Team Alpha, intae yer positions," he told them and Team Alpha peeled away from the main group and began to slowly make their way down to the Manor, keeping to the dense trees that obscured the Manor from the road nearby. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Draco fell into line with the other Aurors, wands out and prepared, while they all waited for the signal that the entrance had been secured. The light that had flared on only minutes ago, died out, and Harry stared at that window - was that one of the boys, trying to signal to someone his presence? In some ways, Harry was too terrified to think of any other possibility.
“Draco, Draco, he’s gone,” someone was whispering next to him, trying to soothe him but Draco screamed.
He found them, huddled at the end of what had been the Slytherin house table, though it didn’t seem to matter now. His mother, looking drawn and tired, and his father, wan, looked up as he approached, and their expressions crumpled into matching ones of relief.
“I’m coming with you,” he said as it was the most obvious thing in the world. Potter frowned at him.
“NOOO!” Weasley let out a war cry and burst into the drawing room, leaving Draco to scramble up and follow him in, wand raised. “
do this,” he said, a touch desperately, and Granger gave Potter a long look. He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, the curls bouncing back more riotous than before.
“What do you mean it’s danger– Potter, behind you!” but it was too late. A nightmare, unseen by both of them, had slithered up behind Potter and wrapped it’s rotting hands around his face. Potter shouted and flailed, and Draco lurched up to grab him and –
“Actually, yes. I’m studying Pureblood anthropology and genealogy,” he said and Harry felt a cold shiver go through him.
, actually. To a group of students. Back in fifth year?” he said, as though hinting and Draco was hit by the memory of Dolores Umbridge.
Draco,” she murmured and he crawled over, taking hold of one of Potter’s limbs as it shook, and the pain in his arm lessened once more for touching Potter. Granger sobbed again and pressed her face into Potter’s quivering shoulder. “The snake – Draco, the snake,” she moaned and he nodded, trying to roll Potter over to one side, his hand brushing something incredibly hot as he pressed it to Potter’s chest.
you. And I’ve been chasing after you ever since,” he admitted and Granger shot Potter a concerned look.
They landed heavily in Hogsmeade, Draco holding on to an invisible Hermione’s hand, and no sooner had she let go than a piercing shriek filled the still air. The cobblestoned street, which had been a picturesque image of village life only a second ago, with warm light filtering from the Three Broomsticks windows, was ruined when the pub door flew open.
, fell in place in front of him, expanding in the middle of the hall and Voldemort’s fury was forgotten as he searched wildly for the caster. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw the air ripple and then Harry dropped the invisibility cloak and stepped out into the open.
“Listeners, I’d like to invite you now to join us in a minute’s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters,” and the wireless fell silent, though it still glowed. Feeling ill, Draco stood from the bench and nearly tripped climbing over it. He waved Potter off when he reached for him and headed for the tent entrance, taking a breath of the chilly air as soon as he was outside, feeling like he had been suffocated in there.
Draco lay back down and tried to calm his breathing. They knew where Potter was, but they couldn’t get to him. That was enough.
“HARRY, NO!” Weasley roared and Draco jumped up from the chair, hand raised to slap over Potter’s mouth but it was too late.
“Morning!” Hermione called from the door to her bedroom and Draco could’ve cursed her as they both looked away. “Did you make porridge, Draco?” she asked, twisting her hair around itself on the back of her head and spearing her wand through it, holding it in place.
They fell into a sort of routine at Shell Cottage. At night, Draco slept on the floor of the living room in a cushioned sleeping bag, woken every hour by the sound of Ron snoring or Dean crying out in his sleep, or even of Potter sitting bolt upright, clapping a hand to his scar. There had been a few nights where Draco, unable to sleep, had lain on his back in the dark, waiting for the sun to creep up the opposite wall. It was only ever when it reached the window ledge that he got out of the sleeping bag and started his day.
The spell shot at the surprisingly intact wardrobe mirror and bounced around the room, setting a trail of fire whenever it landed. It shattered neglected china that was displayed on shelves around the room, sending a curtain of fire over the doorway, and Draco threw his arms up over his face as a piece of china threatened to slice his cheek open. Potter lurched around and ran for the bed again, dragging Granger with him and Draco right behind her, and they bounced from the bed to the ruined dressing table and out of the window, twisting in mid-air, the horrible scream that Potter let out silenced by the squeeze of Apparition.
He caught up with them near the grave of Kendra and Ariana Dumbledore and Granger nearly jumped when he touched her shoulder but then she nodded as though acknowledging his presence. She stopped in her tracks though, bringing Potter to an abrupt stop with her, nearly causing Draco to trip over his heels.
He hoped, stupidly, that Potter might try and board the train but when the pistons started chugging and the train began to slip out of the station, it became obvious that he would not be. There was no murmur of his name through the train, like there usually was, and Draco felt himself deflate in his seat. Pansy’s grip on his arm tightened.
“I should too,” they girls bid everyone goodnight and disappeared upstairs. Somewhere in the midst of all the revelry, Griphook had also managed to slip away. Dean and Weasley helped to clear the last of the dinner things and the window panes began to rattle as the storm built around them.
There was a letter tucked just inside the front cover that Harry opened, surprised to see that his hands were shaking ever so slightly.
“It’s okay, I understand. Very Slytherin trait though, to save yourselves,” he added and Harry laughed again.
Harry’s hand was warm in his, and even when Mrs Weasley’s eyes lingered on their intertwined fingers, she didn’t say anything. She only looked between them and then raised an eyebrow at Draco, who gave her a single nod. She shrugged and turned away, watching as one of her sons (one of the twins), indicated to himself and his brother. Draco thought he had better tune in again, and he turned to look at Kingsley.
They reached the foot of the marble steps leading up to the bronze doors of Gringotts and, as Griphook had said, the goblins who had usually been there to usher in guests had been replaced with wizards holding long, thin golden rods – ‘
“Something to get rid of the Horcruxes,” he said simply and Draco studied the objects they held, recoiling slightly – teeth. They were long, very pointy, fangs. His vision dimmed and his ears rang for a second, but then the world righted itself as Ron did some sort of impression, making a horrible strangled hissing sound.
“LUCIUS!” Mother shouted, and Draco didn’t notice as she bodily removed her husband from her son’s vicinity, dragging him back with a hand fisted in his robes. All he could think about was the stinging pain along his jaw and with one rough movement he got out of his seat and left the study, breaking the warding charm around the door. He ignored the stares of the Death Eaters scattered along the Stone Stairs as he took them two at a time, running along the galleries until he was in his room, slamming the door shut behind him.
“You still have a place here,” she told him quietly and Draco swallowed around the lump that had suddenly formed in his throat. “You’ve been very helpful these last few weeks. Harry and I are both grateful,” she added and Draco ducked his head, clearing his throat. Hermione studied him for a little while as he scratched patterns into the canvas flooring. “You’re in love with Harry, aren’t you?” she asked and he jerked his head up, nearly headbutting her in the process. He gave the bunk bed another glance, but could not find it in himself to deny it.
“Harry Potter,” she called, and Harry placed Draco’s mug on the floor next to his own and stood. Hermione reached up to squeeze his hand and gave him an encouraging smile, and Harry gave her a shaky one in return, his heart thundering in his chest.
“The name’s Taboo!” Draco and Weasley bellowed together as a loud crack echoed from overhead. Weasley was on his feet, his face pale and blotchy, clearly terrified. Draco’s heart was racing in his chest and he lurched for the bunk beds as Weasley continued, frantic, “I told you Harry, I told you, we can’t say it any more – we’ve got to put the protection back around us – quickly – it’s how they find–”
Potter was crouched by the fire again, one hand scrunched in his hair, the other loosely holding onto Draco’s wand still. He looked up as Draco approached and then looked away again.
“Draco?” came a gruff murmur from the bed opposite his and Draco jumped, startled in the silence of the sleeping boy’s dormitory.
“Yes, we’d better,” he replied, surprised at the rasp in his voice as Blaise escorted him out of the common room. They were silent as they wound their way through the castle, up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey was there, wrapping a bandage around the hand of a sobbing third-year girl. Pomfrey pointed them to a spare bed and patted the girl on the arm.
,” he said and like the first time he had ever used this spell, the spell fizzled and died before it could even escape his wand. Amycus had grabbed him by the robe before he could even try again and pulled it harshly, causing Draco to gasp.
“I know it’s powerful. But I was happier with mine, so…” Harry, sounding tired, let the wand droop in his hand. With his other free hand, he rummaged around in the pouch around his neck and then he finally withdrew the remains of his own wand, the phoenix feather still glinting red between the two halves.
“Do you think so?” he asked and he hated how desperate his voice sounded, how hopeful. She gave him another smile and patted his hand.
“Very. They can’t find us here,” he said firmly. Draco sagged a bit in relief and Potter frowned at him. “Why do you care?” he asked and Draco shook his head.
“Well, ok then, but be quick, Harry,” she told him firmly and Potter turned back to Bathilda, telling her to lead the way and they disappeared back out into the hallway. Draco waited until he heard the top of the stairs creak before dropping the cloak.
Draco dove for Potter, crashing to the floor next to him, and he was trying to raise his wand, but his hand wavered and he pressed his free hand into his forehead where his scar would have been in his own form, crying out “He’s coming!
Potter woke soon after dawn broke. Draco had spent the rest of the night sitting on a stool next to his bed, having sent Hermione (and she was
It was the same schedule as yesterday. Specialised paper in the morning, General paper in the afternoon. The Fellows let them into the hall and Harry took the seat he had taken the day before, resisting the urge to touch the booklet laid face-down before him. Malfoy walked past him and spared a glance over his shoulder to look at Harry, who nodded in greeting.
“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” Harry began again, glancing back up at the portrait of Dumbledore. The Headmaster was looking at him proudly. “Back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.” Dumbledore’s portrait nodded and there was a private moment between him and Harry, an exchange of smiles that were so much deeper than they seemed.
He hadn’t been asleep for very long when Harry jostled him awake, sliding from the arm of the armchair to stand in front of Aberforth, who looked as though he was barely restraining himself, the end of his nose red in the firelight.
There was a bustle of noise by the door and his Aunt Bellatrix came skipping into the room. The diners around the table fell silent and she slid herself into a seat next to Mother, which had been vacated only moments before by the previous occupant, who now stood looking fearful by the large stone fireplace. Bellatrix poured herself a fresh goblet of wine and speared a potato from her sister’s plate on the tip of the knife left at her place. The whole table watched her, awaiting news.
“That’s what he’s after,” his quiet voice pierced more sharply through the tent than his shouting had and Hermione looked even more frightened than she had been. Even Weasley looked worried, his soup forgotten in front of him. Potter turned back to face them, his eyes still wild but his mood suddenly sombre. “You-Kn0w-Who’s after the Elder Wand,”
Draco was on his front pulling his backpack out from under Potter’s bed when a strange whirring sound echoed. He looked up and froze.
“Yes, sir, is Dobby!” the elf squeaked, adjusting the tea cosy propped on his head like a hat. “What is Master Draco doing here, sir?” Dobby asked and then Mibby reappeared with a small tray of tea things, the teapot with steam unfurling from it’s spout. Dobby surveyed the tray and turned to Mibby. “Please bring Master Draco some honey for his tea. He is liking honey in his tea when he is upset,” he told her and Mibby nodded and bustled away again. Draco felt a rush of affection for the elf.
“Feel free,” he said, a bit curtly, and then turned to look down at Potter. “I’ll take the watch. Go get dry,” he said and he strode away, sitting himself down at the edge of the tent, ignoring the look Weasley gave him as he went. He reached for the bluebell fire and picked it up, cradling it in his hands and staring out at the clearing, feeling that the reappearance of Ronald Weasley was going to greatly upset the balance they had only recently forged.
“No, I mean we should tell them to get out. We don’t want any more Dobbys, do we? We can’t order them to die for us-”
“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted the twin, as the Death Eater he was fighting hit the ground as three Stunning Spells hit him. Thicknesse fell to the ground with a strangled cry and Draco winced as tiny spikes erupted from under his skin in his arm –
“Who’s Kingsley?” he asked and while Weasley gave him a disgusted look, Potter stepped closer and answered.
“You know, Greyback,” Scabior said contemplatively. “I think there is a Dudley in there,” and Draco held his breath, feeling the group around him do the same.
“Shall we head home?” Harry suggested and Hermione gave him an assessing look and then nodded. They wound their way out of the atrium and over to the Bodleian Library, where they found a quiet corner and turned on their heels, disapparating away.
’ and scanned the questions laid out before him. He had to choose three of the 78 questions from the list in front of him to answer, and it was key that he chose the right ones. He flipped over the booklet to the second page and took in the questions there, pausing over a likely one.
"My word, Draco, who are these people? Aurors, judging by their robes," Delphinia asked, sniffing a little in disdain, and Draco nodded.
The Wizarding World had been in an uproar when it came to light that they were in a relationship, and Harry certainly hadn't meant to end up in one, especially not with Malfoy. But after the War, he had struggled enormously with guilt of all those lives that had been lost in his name, and so he had wanted to speak to someone from the other side who might've understood - and that had been Malfoy, who had been under house arrest for nearly a year after the War, punished by languishing in the same building that Voldemort's memory haunted.
“Dobby can do that, Master Draco,” he said firmly and he nodded once, his bat ears flapping. “Master Draco can count on Dobby, sir. And when the time comes, Dobby can get Master Draco out of the castle.”
“You are not going out there,” Draco snapped. “You’ll be killed on sight. No, I’ll go, I’ll pretend I was spying, and then I–”
“It’s not alone!” Harry shouted as he drew his head back inside, flattening himself against the remaining wall as curses flew past him and exploded into nothing. “Let’s move, now!” and they sprang into action. Hermione took point with Ron, and Harry stooped to lift Fred’s body by the armpits. Draco went to help but then Percy, realisation dawning, let go of the body and began to help. Draco brought up the rear instead, backing down the corridor as they all crouched low to avoid the curses flying overhead.
. I felt… tortured by this idea that someday, maybe my love would be bad for them. And I didn't want to live like that, and I didn't want them to live like that," he explained and Harry let out a shuddering breath.
“He’s just over–” but his voice died in his throat. He wasn’t there. Harry had been standing in the Great Hall doorway and Draco expected him to go over to the Weasleys but he hadn’t – he was gone. He looked around frantically. Hermione glanced over at him, her face crumpling in grief when she saw Lupin and Nymphadora.
“I’m not supposed to… I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes…” he murmured and then he was a deadweight in Draco’s arms.
Whoever this woman was, she wasn't a Muggle. For one thing she was looking up at the Potter’s ruined cottage with her mouth agape, clearly able to see it. Her eyes flickered back to them, still hidden under the cloak and Draco realised with a start that she knew they were there. He gave Granger a wide-eyed look which she returned, but only Granger spoke.
The Dark Lord was dead, and Harry, with a wand in each hand, was alive, staring down at the body of the man who had killed him twice.
“Oh no – Oh no, no,” she moaned, scrabbling at the oversized jumper Potter was now wearing. She dropped her beaded bag next to her and pointed her wand at it. “My hands are shaking too much –
’!” he said, remembering Hermione's earlier announcement. Ron flushed pink, even to the very tips of his ears, and Hermione smiled.
“Shacklebolt wouldn’t be so daft as to leave Potter alone in central London,” Yaxley snapped and the Death Eater rubbed his ear ruefully. Draco poked despondently at the seared salmon on his plate with his fork. His father was stroking the rim of his glass of Firewhisky and on Draco’s other side, his mother watched the proceedings around them with a blank expression. “No, he’ll be somewhere a bit more remote. Don’t the Weasleys have some country shack?” Yaxley asked Snape, who was sitting on the right of the Dark Lord’s empty seat. Snape looked up from the book he had been reading, gave him a long look and then sniffed.
They sat in silence for what seemed like hours. Blaise came and joined them, sitting on Draco’s other side, and they watched as Neville Longbottom and Oliver Wood brought in more bodies. Some of the injured were being carried in too and Draco saw Ginny Weasley come with one, holding tightly onto the hand of the girl in the stretcher. Ginny looked up and over at them as Pomfrey worked, and she gave Draco a nod, her jaw tight, but then she turned back to the girl who spoke again. There was a tenuous sort of peace, which was fractured by the sound of the Dark Lord ’s magically enhanced voice.
“You got that Malfoy brat with you, Potter?” the Death Eater shouted and Draco flinched. “We’ll get extra for him,” he added with a mirthless tone of voice that made Draco’s blood run cold. The street fell silent again except for the distant pounding of feet. Draco crouched against the stone wall and waited.
“Do you know this place? It’s your Mother’s ancestral home,” Potter asked, turning in a slow circle around the room. Draco frowned – the conversation seemed disjointed, like Potter’s thoughts were three steps ahead of Draco’s own. Potter was still turning as he asked. “Hey, do you know who R.A.B is?”
"You want me to wait? In my office?!" Harry's voice became louder and more shrill, a feeling of sickness overwhelming him. "While you, what, wait for a ransom note to show up, demanding money or magic or
“Morning Harry,” she said with a smile and he returned the greeting. “This came for you this morning. I think whoever wrote didn’t have your home address,” she handed over the parcel and Harry studied the writing on the brown paper, though he didn’t recognise it. He set it on the table with a frown.
Potter led Draco, Ron and Hermione out of the cottage and up to the mound where Dobby now lay. He paused there and looked out at the waves and then turned back to them, where they waited patiently. Hermione, still a little weak and with a bandage around her forearm, leaned heavily on a stone garden wall, squinting in the pale morning sunlight. Ron was hovering nearby and Draco held the ground between them and Potter, bridging an ever widening gap.
The fangs clattered to the floor as Hermione flung herself at Ron, wrapping her arms around his neck and kissing him full on the mouth. Draco gaped as Ron dropped the fangs in his arms and his broomstick, holding her so tightly and responding with so much enthusiasm that Hermione was lifted from the floor.
“I wouldn’t,” the words sounded dragged out even to Draco, like he was hearing them from a thousand miles away. “You should have killed me as well. Sent my body over the battlements to land next to his,” he said and Snape looked horrified, his eyebrows raised, his lips parted a little. Draco looked away first. “It would’ve been a kinder fate than this,” he said quietly, and Snape said nothing in reply. They lapsed into silence, the only sound in the Orangery the rustle of flowers and leaves as a breeze stirred the nasturtium once more.
“Yes, please Mipsy. We’ve left the laundry in the basket by the staircase and the ironing is hanging from the wardrobe door, if you get round to it?” she said and Mipsy nodded, putting their mugs at their elbows and then leaving the room.
“So you’re looking for these things – Horcruxes?” he asked Granger, who nodded. She was currently bent over the dining table, three books open in front of her, furiously scribbling notes at the very end of a torn off piece of parchment with a bedraggled looking quill. It had been three days since his Mark had burned and they had just settled in at Grizedale Forest for the evening. Potter was outside, cooking some sausages that the elves had sent through over the campfire, and he and Granger were in the tent alone. Ever since his Mark had burned, he hadn’t gone back to his own tent, by silent agreement between the three of them.
There was a clanking noise on the other side of the door that Draco hadn’t heard before, and he craned his head to look, shouting as a gravy boat seared his rips.
“Weasley’s right,” the words pained him and Weasley looked like he was about to drop the small bowl of blackberries he had managed to pick. “The Dark Lord will have jinxed his name, so that no one can say it. It sounds like exactly the kind of thing he’d do.” He grit his teeth and Potter nodded.
“Yes, I dare, because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.” As he passed, Draco noticed Voldemort’s hand tremble where he held onto the Elder Wand. Harry continued to speak. “That wand still isn’t working properly for you, because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore,” he explained and Draco felt the pieces start to slide into place in his mind.
She took a bite of the potato and spoke around it, sending debris across her place setting. Mother’s nose wrinkled as she spoke. “The Dark Lord moves tonight. Gather your wands,” she told them all sharply and the diners sprang to action, rising from the table and scattering to prepare themselves. Bellatrix hummed and chewed on her potato, ignoring her sister's questioning look. Further up the table, Snape waited until the bustle died down and closed his book, standing and sweeping away. Draco resisted the urge to run after him and ask him what was going to happen – that would seem childish.
