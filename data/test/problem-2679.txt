The bright-haired child waited in line, bouncing on the balls of his feet and trying to stand on his tippy toes to see over the crowd. He kept trying to maneuver around the people in front of him and peer between legs to get a good look.
Harry woke the next morning with a hangover and a pounding headache. He cursed himself for not keeping a hangover potion in the house since he really doesn’t drink much anymore. He made his way down the steps and didn’t hear voices so he figured the boys must still be asleep.
“Wait – I don’t think you should go down there alone.” Harry was starting to get paranoid.
Harry accompanied him as he made his way towards his barn to gather his tools. Billy, of course, was right on their heels.
“Fine. He didn’t exactly…kick it. More like, hit it. Or more like…I hit it…when I was on the horse.” Draco continued to look down at the ground.
“So sorry to take so long Leona – thank you for being able to watch Scorpius while mother is out.” He kissed the woman on her cheek before turning his attention to Harry. “There was a somewhat emergency at the office, it appears the potion we’ve been brewing for three days began smoking and a fire erupted. I told those half-wits to stir it once every half hour, twice every hour, and to give a half turn every quarter of an hour – but alas, they couldn’t even get that right.” Draco looked flushed as he stopped speaking.
Draco moved forward again, and Harry allowed his eyes to close and his body to lean forward slightly. There wasn’t much room in the doorway and Harry found himself pressed up against the other man. Before he knew it, lips were pressed up against his. Harry allowed his lips to open slightly as an invitation to the other man before finding a tongue moving inside.
“Right…”
The way Draco was looking, it looked like he might have thought the same thing. “Draco, did you think she’d ever come back?”
The first time Scorpius left without Draco; Draco was a wreck. Harry had left Teddy with Molly for the weekend so he could be there for Draco and offered to stay the weekend at the Manor, but Draco refused and said he didn’t want to be there without Scorpius – so they stayed at Grimmauld Place.

fond memories. He remembers sitting in Malfoy Manor’s beautiful and grand library, with his father reading books to him about the rich history and lineage of the Malfoy name. Looking at his son and saying, “You are to carry on and uphold our name, son. You are my only heir; the duty lies with you.” And Draco remembers feeling proud about that – a sense of honor.
The second name was the champion from Durmstrang – Viktor Krum. This time, it was Hermione’s turn to let out a sound. It was a barely audible gasp, but Harry heard it and turned to look at her. She looked concerned for a brief second, then went back to reading the book she had brought. Harry had heard a lot about Krum, of course he knew of him, anyone who loved Quidditch like Harry did knew Viktor Krum. The man had been playing professionally since the age of 15. He was like a Quidditch prodigy.
“Of that I am sure.” Harry remarked before letting out a laugh. “We’ll meet you in the common room in 20”.
When he finally reaches Draco its as if neither of them knows what to say and Draco will be damned if he’s the first to speak.
When they finished, they agreed to go out for a fly. They grabbed brooms and went out – flying and playing like they had done before.
They all looked so happy. And Draco honestly felt they deserved it.
years and my father found out about it (along with
“Harry, what were we going to say? We knew you’d tell us when you were ready. And besides, that’s for you to discuss – not us.”
“So you left because you surprised yourself?”
Charlie watched Harry leave and as Harry turned his head around, Charlie attempted a half smile – somewhere between neutral and reassuring. As soon as he was sure Harry was out of sight, Charlie ran his fingers through his hair and let out an exhale. There is was. The Boy Who Lived, The Savior, The Chose One, was gay. And Charlie was screwed.
. But that was dumb. He knew Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy wasn’t a Gryffindor. He needed to be told how much someone loved him…and that’s okay. Harry could do that for him.
“It’s okay Harry.” Harry turned around to face him before continuing.
“I wasn’t sure of anything Ron. I just had a
“Yes.”
He laid in bed that night in disbelief – his own father had used a truth serum on him. His father now knew Draco’s deepest, darkest secret. Not only did he like boys… he liked one boy in particular. Probably the one boy he shouldn’t like more than all the others.
Several hours later, Harry was in the kitchens with Luxley talking about dinner when Draco made his return. This Draco didn’t look as broken as the one from earlier. This Draco looked sad, yes, but also determined.
As much as he hated to do it, two years ago he went to the Ministry of Magic and talked to Kingsley Shacklebolt about job. He stated his requirements and thought he was going to have to use his fame as a way to guilt Shacklebolt into a job, but Kingsley seemed to have the perfect solution.
“Well, you aren’t around all the time, Potter.” Draco shot Harry a smile.
. He looked out his front window and saw that the man was gone.
That’s why when mid-March came around and Charlie pulled Harry into his room in the middle of the day, Harry knew something was wrong. One look at Charlie and he knew whatever Charlie was about to say wasn’t going to be good. Charlie never pulled Harry in during the day, especially when people were home and walking all over the Burrow.
“Yet! I just…this is so new and so fresh. I think that if we take it public too quickly, it could really backfire on us.” Draco hated that he wasn’t telling Harry the whole truth, but he knew he couldn’t. Not right now. Knowing Harry, and let’s face it, Draco
“You can talk to me Harry! You can always talk to me! You know that!”
Draco looked up as if he hadn’t heard Harry come down and let out a quick, “I want to take you on a date.”
That was it. Harry couldn’t handle it anymore. Without thinking, he held up his wand and magic flew out of him. Draco, Crabbe and Goyle all went flying back and hit the wall – hard.
Another month went by. Another month and no word from Astoria or her lawyer. Draco was just as anxious as before, but Harry also noticed the man was different…sadder and less sure of himself. Harry watched as Draco began to question his own parenting abilities and was growing anxious about letting Scorpius out of his sight. It broke Harry’s heart to watch this happen and he just kept wishing she would come around and say
“Ginny and I broke up.” Draco looked up quickly and met Harry’s eyes.
“Well, don’t look so surprised. I had been…thinking about you…I guess. I started looking for you about six months after the trial. I literally looked everywhere…asked everyone I could possibly think of. And when no one had seen or heard from you, I was…worried.”
So much had changed. Hermione had also decided to move into the Burrow, but after a month she said that it was time to find her own family. She went to Australia and found her parents and began the process of bringing back their memories. This process would be longer and more difficult than she had anticipated. She decided to live at the Burrow and make frequent trips to, as she called it “continue the process”. Often, she went alone, but sometimes Ron would accompany her (when he could get time away from training).
Malfoy’s don’t…
Draco quickly noticed that while he put his robe on, he didn’t actually close it. He quickly moved to fasten his robe before responding. “I was just… about to shower. What is it you need Potter?”
Harry handed over the letter and watched as Draco read the outside and saw his face fall. He immediately stood up from the table and made his way into the back room. Harry looked at the boys and noticed they continued to eat their meal and didn’t even notice Draco had left.
But no matter how much Harry thought about it that night, none of it made sense. Why had Draco stopped writing? Why didn’t he want to see Harry? Why didn’t he talk to him? ‘Things to take care of’? What
Harry tried to not think about the new information but kept finding himself thinking about Draco. This explains so much actually. His moods, his absences, and his…flirting the other day.
“Dragon’s piss Harry! You scared me!” Charlie whispered into the room.
you’re here. So, if you could just act…”
“Well, I hope she wasn’t too embarrassing.” Draco smiled as he looked at Harry.
“At Hogwarts? There were other gay guys at school?! How did I not know about this…?”
of their money. There wasn’t much left to ruin. This meant it didn’t matter what Draco did with his life. It didn’t matter if he found a wife, produced an heir, none of it mattered… so maybe that meant he didn’t have to. Maybe that meant he too could have a relationship like Dean and Seamus…obviously not anytime soon – he didn’t know anyone else at Hogwarts who was gay and even if he did, he doubted anyone would date
“Ron, I trust Draco. That’s what should matter. I like him… a lot actually. And as for my dad, well, we will cross that bridge when the time comes. I just need you, both of you, to be happy for me and support me – can you do that?”
He made his way inside the home and was met with the boy’s father, James. A powerful stunning spell landed the wizard on his back and rendered him immobile and unable to protect his family. Voldemort found his way to a room with a glowing light. Inside was the boy’s mother, Lily. She was terrified but stood firm in front of her son’s crib. Voldemort raised his wand and stunned the woman who let out a blood-curling scream. Voldemort decided to not kill the woman but instead, give her a fate worse than death – watching her only son die.
“Goodnight Draco” He heard Harry call out. He would not dignify that with a response.
“Well…you said it.” Harry hated the way he was sounding. Dean moved to stand up from the couch, but Harry reached out. “Dean, I’m sorry. I’m just…I’m not okay. Thank you…for trying”. Dean smiled and nodded his head before heading back towards his own table to study.
“Sorry about that…I swear she isn’t here
Harry saw Charlie walking towards him and felt his throat start to close. Charlie looked so good. His arms, that Harry loved and knew very well, had new scars from the dragons and his time outside made his tan return. Harry stared until Charlie was right in front of him.
“I-I just went for a walk…”
“Yes.” Harry answered more firmly.
“No, Draco…he’s right. I’ve really enjoyed seeing you, but I do intend to take Scorpius back with me. He deserves a proper family.” There it was.
“I’m sorry Harry, but Ron’s right. You’ve been staring at him quite a bit since we returned. I mean, every girl in school (and several guys) have noticed the change in him, but you really have to hide it better.”
farm where he had built a life for himself. No, he had no intention of leaving this place much less ever returning back to the wizarding world. And yet, he still felt his heart soar when he heard a
Draco smiled back, “Great – awesome. That’s...good then. A date.” Harry listened as the man babbled again and all the while thought,
“I…wasn’t running away from you or anything.” Harry said almost as if he could read Draco’s thoughts. “Well, I guess I kind of was…the kiss…it just…took me by surprise.”
But as his mind was thinking it, his eyes were taking in a full view. Draco had grown at least 4 inches over the summer and became more built. Sure, he still looked pretty skinny, but Harry could tell muscles had formed while looking closely at his robes, which led Harry’s mind to quickly wonder - was Draco Malfoy working out over the summer?
Oliver stared at Harry for a long time before eventually speaking, “I’m happy for you Harry. You deserve it. If he’s who makes you happy, then…I’m glad.”
“Mr. Potter! What a coincidence I should run into you today! Do come in!” Harry gave the witch a smile before looking down at Teddy who seemed to be unbothered by the witch.
“Harry…your father is…just worried is all. I don’t think he was expecting that…” Lily let out a breath and moved towards her son. She hugged him tight, then released and look at him, “Harry…you love him?”
Draco assured Harry that Teddy was fine now and that everything was okay.
They strategized that they would only write once a week – to lessen the amount of times an owl would be at a window at either of their houses. And for the first month of break they stuck to this routine.
help in this case? He had obviously escaped to the English countryside to live on a fucking farm. Why would he have any interest in this case?
When Harry and Teddy arrived at the Manor at 1pm sharp, they were greeted by a house elf who introduced herself as Luxley and showed them inside. Once Harry stepped in, he was amazed at how much had changed. If he didn’t know any better, he would say this was a completely different house.
“But I do Harry. I do.” Draco went silent again and Harry was in absolute disbelief. Draco got up and moved out of the kitchens. Before he left, he turned back to a still sitting and shocked Harry. “You should go now…” then turned and walked back out.
When they broke apart, Draco continued to hold Harry. “You have to be strong Draco. If this is what you want, then you have to fight for us.” Harry spoke in a whisper.
He prepared his usual breakfast, a cup of tea and a single egg. He had to admit that after last night’s feast, this breakfast seems awfully depressing. But just as he sat to eat, he heard a rustling coming from the make-shift bed in the living room.
moving. Not breaking away. Just standing there and staring at one another. He watched as Draco took a small, yet wobbly, step forward and looked down at Harry’s eyes and then further down to his lips. Harry always hated that Draco was just a little taller than him, but in this moment – he kind of loved it.
He opened the letter and saw –
Harry didn’t know how to take the conversation or how it ended. Did this mean she listened to him? Was she
Harry could have sworn there was a suspicious tone in that question but decided to ignore it. These were his godfathers. They loved him. He loved them. If he couldn’t talk to them, then who would he talk to?
Draco let out a small laugh, “Good point.”
“Draco?” Harry’s voice sounded…different? Deeper? More mature maybe?
Harry’s face softened – he did understand. “Yes. Yes, I understand. I’m happy with whatever.”
“’Night ‘Mione”.
“When I got to Romania, everything fit. I felt at home – more at home than I ever felt anywhere. But I knew that I was giving up a lot (and making my mother very nervous). So yes, I am okay being here. But there are reasons I left – and I do keep thinking about those reasons.”
The smile dropped from his face, “No. Potter, I don’t.”
Harry knew that was also a possibility. A small part of him allowed himself to have hope, until one day near the end of term.
The two started to make their way towards the front door of Malfoy Manor. As Draco opened the door, Harry stepped out onto the stoop. He turned around to say a final goodbye, when suddenly Draco’s lips were on his. The kiss was quick. Too quick for Harry.
The men took their time with each other, completely forgetting the outside world and wrapping themselves up in one another. After what seemed like hours, and honestly probably was, both men drifted off to sleep.
“Well, Harry and Teddy moved into the house. And you and Harry sleep in the same room. And…and…” the boy was starting to stutter as he spoke, “And you always tell him you love him…”.
Harry gave Draco a confused look, “Malfoy, how is it that your son knows who I am…?” He watched as Draco’s flush became permanent, but his face twisted into defense.
The TriWizard Tournament was, indeed, extremely dangerous. Each task left the impression that one of the champions’ lives would be in danger, but thankfully they all came out of it alive.
The two kissed for a rather long time until they heard a cough from behind them and a “Christmas dinner is almost ready! Please everyone meet in the dining room! Oh, Draco dear, how great of you to join us…Harry, will Draco be staying for dinner?”
them to be together’ and while that last one wasn’t a far stretch, Harry couldn’t help but be annoyed. Regardless of the details of the rumor, it was clear to everyone…Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were over.
Hermione smiled, “Harry…we know. You’ve been leaving early from dinner every night for the past month for ‘homework’, yet you aren’t in the library or in the common room. You’re significantly happier than I’ve ever seen you and you haven’t talked about Dean
wanted. That would be way out of line.” Draco stood his ground as he watched Charlie reach for his wand.
“Is this why you were so upset, son? You didn’t want to tell us?” Harry looked at his parents and decided to tell the story of Dean once again. And once again, he was met with the same worried and sad faces. When it was over, his parents moved-in to hug him once again. In this moment, Harry felt extremely loved.
Harry received weird boxes sent to his house, but they never made it past the gate because of his wards. He never even touched the boxes – just called Ron and had him send someone from the auror department to handle it. They were usually ‘harmless’ and were actually just angry howlers or potions to make Harry’s hair fall out or something.
“Hermione…” Draco whispered out into the library even though he really didn’t need to. They sat so far back that no one would even know they were there if it hadn’t been for their pile of books coming and going from the table.
Harry tried to use work to keep his brain occupied, but Christmas came quicker than Harry had anticipated. Harry had grown to truly love Christmas these past 9 years. It was the holiday that made him truly feel part of the Weasley family – every year he opened up that sweater with the big H on it, he felt at home.
Harry let out a chuckle and looked to Draco who was looking down at his son’s pleading face. “That’s up to Harry, Scorpius.” The boy immediately turned his attention towards Harry and gave the same face and looked ready to ask in the same way before Harry stopped him. “Yes – if your father doesn’t mind, that should be fine.”
Draco sat silent. Harry stared into the grey eyes he had come to love and with every moment that passed he could feel his heart race faster and faster. Maybe he was wrong. Maybe Draco didn’t love him the way he thought he did. Maybe he made all of this up in his own head.
“No, I am! I just wanted to be sure because last time….” Harry trailed off and was stopped by Draco continuing. “Harry. I’ve been thinking about this every day for the past week. It sounds like we are both sure, so…” Draco looked down towards Harry’s pants where a certain area had grown, then looked back towards Harry “…can I continue now?” Draco’s smirk caused Harry to lunge towards his lips and the two continued.
“Teddy – there are people behind us, love. I need you to make a decision.” His godfather always pushed him to make his decision too quickly.
or anything. So, I don’t really have much to talk about.” Harry really didn’t understand why Draco wanted to talk to him about this.
“Look. It’s fine. It was what it was – an impulse kiss apparently. Like I told you after it happened, it doesn’t have to mean anything, Harry.” Draco quickly acknowledged the use of Harry’s first name and hated himself.
Draco? What the hell are you doing?! You’re getting married? To…to some girl?!” Harry couldn’t even believe what he was saying. It took every ounce of him to push down his magic, force some sort of control.
Ron must have needed time to calm down because Harry never heard him come back but found him asleep in his bed the next morning.
Dress robes, satin scarves, leather boots. Pointless.
Forgetting she was there, Narcissa Malfoy stepped from behind her husband. “Draco…Draco honey…you need to think about this. Carefully. This is your future at stake…”
“Yuck!” Scorpius erupted and turned his head back around to watch the game after seeing his father’s ‘public’ display of affection.
“Of course Potter! I had to make sure that CHARLIE of yours knew what he was missing out on.” Harry saw Draco wink and immediately felt the tightness in his chest. Oh Merlin…not again.
“Hermione, it’s Skeeter. She’s going to do whatever she wants to whomever she wants. She’s always been obsessed with Harry…it was bound to happen.” Ron placed his hand on Hermione’s back to sooth her before looking back at Harry, “What are you thinking, mate?”
“I’m just saying what I heard….”
“Draco, I understand wanting to get away. Trust me…I really do. But you’re wrong. I talked to everyone I possibly could. Your mother, Blaise, Greg, Pansy, Theo…everyone I could find who might know where you were. They all were concerned. They had all been writing to you but said their owls just kept coming back. Your mother is doing better and just kept asking for updates every time I went to visit her. There are people that care about you Draco…”
“Well, isn’t that wonderful Teddy. I’m glad you and Harry have made a new…friend.” Hermione’s grin was wicked in that moment. “Now run along and go up to Rose’s room.” Teddy took off towards the staircase still talking about Scorpius…to no one in particular.
When they pulled away, Oliver’s eyes were closed, and he was smiling. Harry watched as his eyes slowly opened and looked right at Harry.
“I’m not saying I am experimenting! I’m just saying that’s what he said!” Draco couldn’t take this anymore.
“Men, Potter. We both wanted to be with men.” Harry’s eyes grew wider as he tried to hide his shock.
Harry fell asleep with a smirk.
having Harry and Hermione in the house and Ginny announced she had been recruited for the Holyhead Harpies and would be staying at the Burrow after graduation until the Harpies’ season started in September.
Draco Malfoy is gay. Another thought that kept coming back into his head.
Harry felt tears swelling up in his eyes and pushed them back down. The two decided to end on that note and walk back inside. When Hermione saw them enter the common room, she rushed them and pulled them into a big hug. Her arms lingered on Ron a bit too long before she pulled away completely before saying, “See Harry! I told you Ron wouldn’t care!”
“Harry, please don’t tell anyone about this. Okay?” Dean gave Harry a look of fear and worry.
“Yes! Because I have a plan.” Harry felt his lips curl into a smirk. In reality, he had been thinking about this plan for the past month.
“Harry, what are you doing? Meeting up with Draco Malfoy late at night? Alone?! He’s bad news Harry!”
Harry followed Draco out of the room and headed towards the door. Before he left, Harry couldn’t resist. “So, you’ve been talking to your mum about me I see.”
“Yeah – I just wanted to discuss….us.” Harry stated awkwardly as he tried to hold eye contact with the youngest Weasley.
the classes. It was if he just ‘magically appeared’. Draco knew that wasn’t the case and suspected a certain invisibility cloak was helping.
about his training but was beginning to be less of a prat and understood not everyone wanted to hear about every minute of his day-to-day activities. Things were feeling better – and isn’t it those times when things start to fall apart?
“Oh, that’s quite alright Mr. Potter. Harry’s had enough to worry about this year…” Harry was afraid Oliver was going to bring up Draco and tried to shoot him a look, but found Oliver was looking straight at his father. “You know, with this being his last year and all. It can be quite stressful. I remember my last year – the classes were insane. Harry’s handling it much better than I did.
Draco can remember the exact moment Voldemort entered his home. Draco was in his room when he heard whispers coming from downstairs. He moved to stand at the top of the staircase to have a better view of the entry way to the Manor. That’s when he saw…it.
“That depends…” He could tell the boys deflated a little at the response, but noticed Draco was still on the edge of his seat.
“Definitely.” Harry moved into kiss Draco and the kiss heated very quickly before Harry pulled away. “I really do have to go.”
going public and well…here it is.”
Draco watched Harry walk down the path towards the street and disapparate. Once he was gone, Draco let out a breath that he hadn’t realized he had been holding in. He slowly turned to go back inside; he needed to have a word with his mother.
“Alright?” was all he said before shoveling food into his mouth. Draco always hated his lack of table manners. He watched as over the years they had gotten slightly better, but it always looked as if Harry hadn’t eaten in fifteen years and he ate as if the food would be taken at any moment.
“Actually, I know Draco very well. I’ve known Draco Malfoy for a very long time you see. And I know quite a bit about your relationship. I know that he asked for a divorce because he wasn’t happy. I know he wanted his freedom – wanted to be able to be who he was. And I know you left him and your son rather than working something out. But now…now you want to be involved. Why? Because he’s with someone? Because he’s with a man…? Because he’s with me?”
for a while now, and the serum will allow us to get the truth. Once we have the truth, we can fix it – the Malfoy name is too important for any
“I didn’t say anything about that. I’m merely here to check on you. See what you’re up to.”
“Oh! Perfect! Look Draco! It’s Potter! Or should I say…
Throughout their first year at Hogwarts, Harry learned rather quickly that Hermione was absolutely brilliant. She was easily the best witch in their year. Ron and him on the other hand were average. They hated doing their schoolwork, especially when they found Hogwarts Quidditch.
“Don’t be sorry – you’re right. But luckily for me, it changed me for the better…I think. The war taught me a lot about myself and my family.” On the last word Draco shivered. He had been trying very hard not to think about his father but felt this was where the conversation was heading.
“Morning!” Harry exclaimed in a way that was either fake or nervous. Given who he was talking to today and what he was going to say, Draco figured nervous.
Draco took a deep breath before explaining the situation with his father and the contents of the letter. He tried his best to leave out details he felt were…personal but wanted to make sure he gave her all the information she would need to help him make a decision or devise a plan.
“Oh, dear, he’s already left. Left early this morning. Said he was called in – apparently a dragon is on the loose! I never will understand why he does such a dangerous job! After everything we’ve been through, to go back to THAT…” Molly stopped when she noticed Harry’s face drop. “Oh dear, it’ll be alright. We all miss him terribly, but don’t worry dear – I made him promise to be back for your birthday party!”
“Oh, Mr. Potter! How fortunate we are to run into each other again!” Leona Greengrass stood in the doorway to the house you would swear was hers and ushered Harry in.
to get in the way. Let’s start with easy questions to test the waters – Draco, when is your birthday and how old are you?”
, the rest of you are in no state to try and take care of him right now. Besides, I don’t think there’s anything we can do for him at the moment. Draco has changed. Remember, Harry said so himself and that’s why he spoke for him at his trial. I heard from Blaise that he’s working to become a healer. A HEALER Ron. Do you think an ex-Death Eater turned healer would put all of that at risk to hurt our Harry?”
Draco really didn’t mind. This was much better than the alternative – Ron losing his shit and throwing curses. Or Ginny transfiguring his food into rodents or something.
Harry continued to look at the man in front of him and listened as he babbled on and on before finally speaking, “Yes.”
Fourth year was a difficult year. In addition to the excitement of the Tournament, there was also excitement over a mandatory dance, the Yule Ball, that was to take place before winter holiday. Harry didn’t really care to go, and he certainly didn’t have an interest in asking anyone to go with him. Ron was adamant that they go, so Harry said okay and felt the three of them should go together. Ron was quick to point out that that was ridiculous and went on a quest to find Harry and himself dates.
“Well, then…can I stay?” The pitiful green eyes that looked up at him were nearly impossible to say ‘no’ to.
“I don’t know…can’t be that early. Sun’s up. We must have slept late…” Harry flushed thinking back on last night.
“You have to stop saying that! I’m not a ‘you’. I’m a person, Charlie! I’m a person who deserves someone who wants them back. And if that’s Draco, then Draco it is.” Harry knew that wasn’t the best way to say that, but he was taken aback by this conversation with Charlie. He really didn’t want to be here.
Harry waited three hours, but for the first time in their relationship…Draco didn’t show.
interaction. He didn’t understand some of their inside jokes and he was growing nauseated watching Ginny fawn over Harry, but all in all, he was enjoying himself.
reached the counter, they were greeted with a now too familiar face. “Mr. Teddy! Mr. Scorpius! What can I get for you today?” As the boys began to speak, the wizard paused them. “Wait, wait! Let me guess…hmmm… I do believe Mr. Scorpius will have the…strawberry tart with…sweet vanilla and…whipped cream on top!” The wizard looked down at a wide-eyed Scorpius.
Knowing what was to come, Harry had decided to tell his best friends that morning before breakfast. He knew once they got to the Great Hall that all bets would be off.
Harry could not find it within himself to match Draco’s tone. “More time Draco?! All I’ve given this is time! It took us months to even kiss! I don’t know what else you want from me.”
There was silence on the other end of the table and Harry was confused. He looked up and was met with two very large smiles. Remus was the first to speak, “We know Harry.”
Harry read the letter several times before finally responding back –
The two would have stayed like this and Harry would have been content, but as soon as it started, it was over. “Daddy!” a scream erupted from upstairs and both men took off running towards the room.
“Thanks again Draco. And I’m happy to host the boys next time – give you a break.” Harry smirked at Draco’s attempt to NOT look exhausted.
Almost as if he knew what Harry was doing, as soon as he finished, an owl tapped on his window. An owl he was now all to accustom with.
“Wait – what?! What
Draco looked defeated. Harry wanted to shake him – sure this wasn’t how their plan was going to go, but now is the time Draco!
about it. You aren’t bisexual just because you did it.” Draco felt the need to make this point clear.
“It’s fine. I didn’t listen to it anyway. He was just trying to make you angry.” Harry wanted to give Draco an out. An opportunity to disregard everything that was said that morning.
for once and his alone. He relished in the idea of being the only auror in the family and took it as a great honor (boasting and bragging about it every change he got).
Harry had no words. The house was exquisite and
“Actually, I
How in the hell did you end up in a place like this?!” Before Draco could comment, Harry was back at it. “And what the hell are you wearing?” Harry looked Draco up and down.
with me after? What is it about ME that men seem to…pity? Like, I’m some precious creature that can’t handle a KISS without a long discussion after?!” Harry knew he needed to calm down, but he couldn’t help it – the insecurity was rising. He thought he had been doing well with Draco. He thought things had been great! What was happening…?
After a solid month of planning, Harry and Draco figured out a plan. After graduation, Draco would return home and pack his bags. He’d leave a letter for his father explaining everything and would leave Malfoy Manor in the middle of the night. He would apparate to Harry’s parent’s house, then the two would leave for Scotland the next morning.
Astoria stood and walked out of the restaurant and Harry felt a wave of relief wash over him.
“Yeah, but at least Voldemort wasn’t trying to shag either one of us.” There was silence, but soon Draco couldn’t keep in the laugh – it came tumbling out of him.
Harry attached the letter and sent it off before thinking it over in his head again.
“Right….” Harry looked down at his food and felt his face flush.
Oliver let out a laugh, “Well, I
But he can’t deny that going out on a date with Draco Malfoy would likely cause it to increase again…
Harry had expected this. Draco had said something similar a few weeks ago, so Harry was prepared. “Draco, you were never my second choice. You were a choice I didn’t even know I had. I have never felt for anyone the way I feel about you, and yes that includes Charlie. You understand me. We go well together! We can talk about everything and nothing and are just as happy as can be. You wanted to get to know
who you marry and when. You should do it out of love, not out of obligation.”
Skeeter needs to find better things to write about than people’s personal lives. It’s absurd!” Hermione was raising her voice and Harry could tell Ron was concerned about waking up Rose.
Draco watched as the witch moved in her chair uncomfortably while never letting her face show it. “Oh, I see. Yes, well I imagine he wouldn’t be too pleased about your relationship. But honestly Draco I don’t know much about pureblood customs – .”
at him… Oliver Wood was in his house…. Harry couldn’t help but think how his 12-year-old self would be feeling right now.
He also found himself staring at Dean while they all got ready for bed. These boys had grown up together. They had changed in front of each other loads of times, and yet, here he was. Staring. He tried to rationalize it by saying, “You’re just curious. You just need to get a girlfriend”. But he knew that wouldn’t help. He didn’t want a girlfriend…he wanted Dean.
as a family. That meant she no longer cared about our ‘status’ as a family, so long as we had each other and were happy. She still wants grandchildren but understands that that is a possibility.” The smile Draco had been wearing quickly faded as he continued, “I haven’t told father though. I actually don’t think I ever will. He doesn’t deserve to know about my life.”
But he had heard nothing since then. He just assumed Draco chose to keep a low profile. He imagined the man had married some pureblood witch and carried on the Malfoy name. Which, he guessed, technically he did. Even with the trials and his father going to Azkaban, the family was still obscenely wealthy.
. He and Pansy apparently weren’t dating…he was allegedly dating a boy. Blaise Zabini.”
There was nothing for him to worry about. Draco had changed. He knew it had to be true. The man whose kitchen he stood in earlier today was definitely not the same man he went to school with. Or maybe he was, just…affected by a war…and a marriage.
Astoria came back a month later. Or rather, her lawyer did.
They found themselves in a hallway, Draco up against a wall, and the two making-out and groping at each other before a voice caught their attention, “Draco.”
Lucius continued to stare a hole into his son. “Draco. We discussed this. You are not to have any contact with…Mr. Potter.” Lucius made a quick glance towards Harry and said his name like it was a curse.
“I don’t want to tell my son anything unless it’s real. He already doesn’t have a mother - I don’t need more people going in and out of his life.” Draco’s voice was strong in this moment and it took Harry by surprise.
Charlie looked at Harry and let out a breath. “Harry, I’m going back to Romania….on April 1
Draco arrived at noon on Christmas Day shortly after the family had finished their Christmas lunch, which as Molly said was “simply the pre-meal” and were all settling into their post-Christmas lunch spots. Harry went to the door to let him in and brought him into the living room. Draco felt a lot of Weasley eyes on him and immediately regretted his decision to come.
But Draco. Draco was softer. He was less built and more lean. But, while Harry hadn’t seen Draco in anything other than his school uniform or the clothes he wore around his own house, Harry knew Draco was muscular underneath it all. When Harry thought of Draco (which was frequently), one word always popped into his head – handsome. Draco didn’t look at Harry as if he was something to be tamed or conquered, he looked at him like he…wanted him. Like he longed for him. And Harry loved it.
Stupid Harry
Harry continued the kiss and straddled Draco – their chests touching. Draco pushed his hips up once again to gain friction and once again felt his lips abandoned.
Draco decided to sit down at the table directly next to Harry. He looked up and made eye contact with Charlie who gave a hesitant smile. Draco turned his attention to Harry who reached a hand under the table to look for Draco’s and gave it a small squeeze. The two looked at each other and Draco felt his chest tighten.
obsessed with me. But I wouldn’t say
“Oh…I- I just assumed. Sorry…” Harry kept his eyes on the ground and let his voice get quiet. “I’m a little relieved. I’m surrounded by couples all the time… and now that Ginny and I are…it’ll be nice to have someone else who’s single.”
“You have to go in eventually, you know?”
And now…Astoria.
“Sorry to worry you…I just…” Harry exhaled. He began to tell them all about Draco’s meeting with Astoria. He felt bad at first for telling so much of Draco’s information, especially the part about what Astoria said about him being a Death Eater and not getting a lawyer, but he also knew his friends and knew they wouldn’t judge.
Harry dropped the fork in his hand. Dean turned and looked at him, but quickly looked away.
“Potter…relax. There are worse things than having a school full of girls chase after you.” Draco tried to offer a helpful smile.
“You go…” Harry said. “No, you.” Draco smiled. He really didn’t have anything important to say so felt it best to let Harry go.
Voldemort preached. But it’s to be expected, right? Just because Voldemort is gone, doesn’t mean his supporters just up and decided he was actually a bad guy. They weren’t all Draco. The rest of them, for the most part,
He didn’t own much anymore. A few flannel shirts for the winter, some long-sleeve but airy shirts for the summer, two pairs of boots (both made for working in the fields, one when wet and one when dry), a couple of heavy wool sweaters, and a few pairs of pants. He always thought about buying more because if there was one thing about living as a muggle he hated, it was laundry. But he never really brought himself to do it. He only really needed clean clothes when he went into town for supplies, and that was only every couple of weeks or so.
Harry felt jealousy rising up inside him and quickly realized he was jealous of his best mate’s sister. She got to kiss Dean. She got to make him smile like that. And when they finished kissing, Dean didn’t pull back in shock or disgust or anger. He kept smiling…
The conversation after became lighter and the three of them ended up talking and laughing until late in the night. Harry had decided to go to bed, but as soon as he laid down, he heard a knock on his door. His godfathers had made sure Harry had his own room at their house from the moment he was born. The room had changed along with Harry. It currently had Quidditch posters around the room and several pictures of Harry, Hermione, and Ron and many more of Sirius, Remus, and Harry.
When Harry returned home that summer, his father sat him down.
“Oh…Hermione taught him that that was the way he was supposed to refer to my…um, significant others. I’m bisexual, so it covers if I’m with a man or a woman…” Harry’s face flushed, and he grew uncomfortable. He wasn’t ashamed of his sexuality, but he wasn’t sure how Draco was going to respond…
As soon as they were through the door Teddy took off towards the backroom while Harry yelled after him, “Be careful!” and turned his attention back to the witch from the door.
When the man returned from the back he finally spoke, “It’s nice.”
“Yeah…but, I understand if you don’t want to or anything. I know it’s probably foolish or something…” Draco kept going and Harry could tell he was back peddling. “I know we have history, but I just thought…”.
He couldn’t believe this was happening. Harry Potter was on top of him, making out with him, aroused because of him… Draco tried to take it a step further and pushed his hips up slightly to gain friction, but immediately found his lips abandoned.
“And raise a glass to losing your virginity!”. The room immediately silenced. “Let’s have a toast to falling stupidly in love with someone who will never love you back. This is to the man who was nothing but honest with me and I went and mucked it up with my
Well, you already said it Harry. Can’t take it back now. “Yeah. My parents won’t mind. You can at least come for Christmas day. It’ll just be me, my parents, and my godfathers. Nothing fancy or anything, but you’re welcome to come.”
an eighteen-year-old boy who just fought and won a war, a child. At a time when all he wanted to do was lay in his room and sleep, shut off from the world, and be left alone – they brought him an infant.
“You were going to leave your son…?” Harry tried to hide the judgement in his voice, but he knew it was coming out. As much as Teddy was unexpected and difficult in the beginning, he would never think of leaving him or giving him up.
His favorite animal on his farm was actually his Highland Cows. He only had two, but he fell in love the moment he saw them. Their shaggy brown hair felt amazing to run his hands through and he liked the way they just kind of lounged about. The sheep always seemed to be moving and making sound. But the cows…the cows were perfect.
Harry decided to go upstairs quickly before the tears could hit. He refused to let Charlie see him like this.
notice that he had Oliver’s. After dinner ended, Harry couldn’t take it anymore. While all the students were trying to exit the hall, Harry made his way to the astronomy tower. If there was any place to meet Draco, it would be their spot.
As lame as the conversation topics were, Draco was enjoying himself. He had never talked to Harry like this. So, open and care-free. No insults, no jabs, and no animosity. Just conversation.
Harry backed away to a comfortable distance and looked at Draco. Draco took this moment to look Harry over, noticing the dark circles around his eyes and the stubble that had gathered around his face. Harry looked handsome (as he always did), but exhausted.
Draco – asserting his dominance in the situation.
When Harry dropped to his knees he was immediately stopped. “Harry…what are you doing? You don’t have to do that.”
Telling Harry went as expected. He immediately jumped to his feet and grabbed his wand as if prepared to duel Lucius Malfoy right then and there.
“Oh, right….sure…okay. I’ll walk you out.”
“So…what happened?” Part of Harry still couldn’t believe he was having this conversation with Draco Malfoy of all people.
Draco finished putting on his boots and stepped outside. He looked around at the fields. His fields. And quickly set to work. Behind the cottage was a small barn where he kept most of his supplies and he started in that direction. Today’s objective was to cut the grass in that god-forsaken north eastern side that just wouldn’t stop growing. As much as it bothered him, it was also quite easily his favorite place on his land. It sat right on the water and he could take several breaks while cutting the grass to go and swim.
of ours! Isn’t that right, Ron?” George nudged his brother in the arm and almost died of laughter watching his face turn red.
And he loved how Draco was with Teddy.
Harry noticed a change in Draco once they returned. Harry could swear he felt that the boy was trying to talk to him. He would catch him in the hallway, walking towards one of Harry’s classes, but when Harry went to approach – the man would walk away. There were times when they would pass each other in the hall and Harry thought he saw Draco’s mouth open to say something, but when he looked closely, the mouth was closed, and the man was soon gone.
Harry was excited when conversation leapt to ‘Who at Hogwarts Was Gay’ and he quickly realized his later-in-life sexual awakening was unfortunate. Granted, he was fighting a dark wizard and probably wouldn’t have had time anyway, but still…just
“I don’t understand Draco. I’ve spent
Draco wasn’t allowed at her trial but had heard that she had been let off with no consequences. He didn’t know how, and he frankly didn’t care, she was free; that’s all that mattered.
Draco ate breakfast with the Trio (plus Ginny) and actually didn’t hate it. He hadn’t realized how much he was
“Yes, well, we do try our best with him. But it is a group effort you see. When my dear Stori left, shortly after Scorpius was born, I knew his grandfather and I needed to step in and help poor Draco.” Harry nodded as she spoke and began to wonder where Draco was exactly…
“Lily, I promise I’ll be fine. You have all done enough for me already. Really.” Oliver gave his award-winning smile and Harry saw his mother give-in. “Well, alright, if you say so.”
Growing up, Harry never knew that other kids didn’t have two godfathers, they had godparents – a woman and a man. Harry thought it was ‘normal’ to have his Sirius and his Remus. He also thought everyone’s godfather was a dog and a wolf, but that’s a different conversation. Harry didn’t think much of any of this when he was little, this was his version of normal.
“Harry…” Harry heard his name whispered across the table and looked up to see Draco with tears in his eyes. “Thank you…” Harry’s heart stopped. Thank you? Thank you for getting your son taken from you?
“Valiantly, Teddy.” Harry corrected his godson before looking up at Draco.
“I thought you left…” Draco kept watching the man in front of him.
“She wasn’t my girlfriend Potter. As much as my dear father would have loved it, Pansy and I were never together.”
Astoria looked as if her eyes were starting to tear-up and she stood up abruptly. Harry was thrown off by the change in the room and stood up as well.
So, after a rather long day of watching George try and fail to create a firecracker that would only explode with a secret code word (which resulted in a lot of booming and banging in the shop), Charlie decided to make a move.
Harry thought Draco was going to bite back but looked to find a silent Draco on his side.
“Didn’t want to deal with the questions. Or Hermione giving me that
Draco looked down at himself in confusion. This is what he always wore…his tan work pants, a light button-up light blue shirt, and his work boots.
Harry chuckled before responding, “It’s hard to explain. But, as you know, there was a war that ended seven years ago. A very bad wizard came and hurt a lot of people. Your parents and Uncle Fred included. Well, we all fought against him and we won. He…killed me. But I sort of…came back.”
“Draco! Did you hear literally anything I just said? I need your help. You’re the only death eater that’s living and not incarcerated who could possibly tell us anything about this man.” Harry was walking quickly behind Draco and he could hear the sound of both of their sets of boots making splashes in the grass.
“Teddy is my godson. Do you remember Professor Lupin? He is his son, with Tonks.” Draco’s eyes widened. Harry figured he just realized Teddy was technically his cousin.
The boy was quiet for a moment before responding at just above a whisper, “…I thought you were…”.
James and Lily decided to plan a get-away just for the two of them. It would act as a treat for their anniversary, while also allowing them to ship Harry off to Sirius and Remus for a week.
his father. That he was a good dad.
Barely a week into break and Harry received his first letter from Draco – as promised. The letter was long and in Draco’s beautiful handwriting. The contents of the letter were a mixture of poetry and filth. Harry loved the way Draco could be so sweet and tender but turn heated real fast. Harry tried to respond with the same length and heat but had to rush the ending when he heard his father coming up the steps to his room.
Sirius let out a small laugh, “Oh, no, I really do. I promised your parents 15 years ago that nothing bad would happen to you while you were with me. At the time, I think they were thinking more
Harry went to sleep that night more content than he had ever been. As he drifted off, he saw flashes of blonde hair and grey eyes.
“Right. Sorry. I’ve just never really talked like this to anyone. Oddly enough, Charlie said the same thing. He said if I couldn’t say the words, then I’m not ready to have the conversation.” Draco nodded and hoped Harry would continue. “I’ve had dreams about guys before. Sex…dreams. Like you said. And…I’ve found guys attractive before…I just didn’t really realize that’s what it was at the time, I guess. But I’ve never wanted to kiss one until…well, until you.”
He was enjoying this position a little too much when he was all of a sudden no longer in Harry’s lap and was instead being moved in the air. Harry grabbed him around his waist and quickly flipped them, so Harry was on top of him in the bed, Draco on his back.
Harry tells Hermione and Ron about Draco...let's see how it goes.
“Of course I love you Harry. But it isn’t that simple.” As terrible as this conversation was, there it was – Draco did love him.
“Yes, that’s why people know who I am. But I’m not the only hero. A lot of people fought. Your Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron. All of the Weasleys actually. And Mr. Draco.” Harry hoped he wouldn’t have to go into that part of the story.
Voldemort raised his wand to kill Harry Potter. He cast the killing curse at the child and was met with a strong burst of light. When James and Lily Potter came to, they found their perfect son sitting in his crib, unharmed. They also found the shriveled remains of the once-powerful Voldemort on their son’s floor. The only way a person could know something had ever happened to their son was by a small lightening shaped scar on his forehead.
from the man? What about all the nights Harry waited for him in the tower only to be left sitting alone and miserable?
The year after the Battle of Hogwarts was…. different. So much had changed in the past year, and yet so much remained the same. The day after the final battle, Harry took Molly Weasley up on her offer to move into the Burrow. He knew this was the best place for him – this was not a time for him to be alone and he knew the Weasleys would appreciate the extra support. So, he moved in. Living at the Burrow had always brought Harry joy, and this was no exception. The family was grieving, but they were also the Weasleys. They knew heartache, they knew bad times, and they knew how to cope – as a family.
“Fuck off Potter and leave me the fuck alone!” Draco turned towards his barn and stomped off. He didn’t hear steps behind him and when he looked back, Potter was gone.
So, when it came time for all of the eighth years to put their name on a list to leave or stay for the winter holidays, Draco quickly placed himself on the ‘stay’ list.
“Malfoy, I’m warning you.”
March 1
Was all Draco could think in this position.
Harry laid in his bed and looked around the room. He made eye contact with the posters and rolled his eyes. Harry laid in his bed a while longer, not wanting to go back to his party but knowing people would begin to wonder where he was. He put on the bravest face he could muster and went back downstairs. Molly was right, it’s not every day a man turns 19…
“Harry James Potter. You didn’t.” Hermione was giving him a very serious look.
of December…Happy Christmas to Harry.
“Why did Teddy say you didn’t have a partner?” Harry froze. Well, now or never he supposed.
Harry wasn’t
Just as he started for the door out of the dorm, he felt a hand on his forearm. He spun around and saw an overly excited Harry Potter staring at him.
George was, surprisingly, the most upset with Harry. He didn’t care that Harry was gay and he really didn’t care that he had had a relationship with Charlie. George knew Charlie was gay as he and Charlie had become close over the past year and was old enough to remember the ‘incident’ in the living room, but outing him in front of everyone and going into detail about their time together was “too much Harry”.
of Harry’s is a
“Not necessarily. I dated Ginny because I thought it was what I should do. She was my best friend’s sister; it would guarantee me a place in the Weasley family. Which is basically my only family…but I realized that was dumb. They would always be my family. And Charlie was…out of convenience.” Draco smirked as he realized Harry was stealing his words from earlier.
Hoping they wouldn’t be talking about Harry’s embarrassing attempt at a kiss a few weeks ago, Harry took this as an opportunity to ask what he had been wanting to ask, “Draco, what made you go into healing?”
Astoria is back because she doesn’t want Scorpius to live with Draco. She’s been fine with it for the past 4 years when she thought Draco wasn’t
Once the tea was gone, the cup disappeared and his father sat up straight in his chair, staring at his son. “You’re smart, so I trust by now you have an idea of the conversation we are about to engage in. We need to discuss the events of earlier tonight. I’ve had suspicions about your…
He had never actually laid eyes on Voldemort before. He didn’t know what he was expecting, but the creature that entered his house certainly wasn’t it. Draco felt the house grow cold as a snake appeared and began to slither around the floor of the living area. Draco felt like he was going to be sick.
. Of course.
Dean smiled, “We know Harry. I think Malfoy is just messing with you.” Harry turned to look at Draco who smiled. Luckily, Harry smiled back, and Draco could exhale.
“Well, I didn’t kill a muggle for it, if that’s what you’re implying.” Draco barked back and felt foolish afterwards. Harry didn’t even
“It did. More than you can ever know. I thought…I thought we were happy.” Harry watched Astoria’s scowl fall for a moment before she corrected herself and looked back at Harry.
“No thanks needed Harry. I believe in you. You can do anything you want after Hogwarts, and like I said, I just wanted to make sure
“Happy Christmas ‘arry” Oliver beamed at him as he opened the door. Oliver was holding flowers in his hand and started to make his way into the house. He had barely shaken off the snow from his shoulders when Harry could hear his mother, father, and godfathers enter the entry way.
“Would you…would you want to stay?” Harry looked back from the door to Draco with a wide smile on his face.
Just to be sure – he made sure to stay away from Potter in the second term of fifth year. He would still harass Granger and Weasley, but he needed to keep his distance from Potter.
On one of their Saturdays, Harry decided to ask the question that had been bubbling inside of him. “Draco, when did you tell your mum you were gay?”
“Well, Mr. Potter. You’ve certainly given me plenty to think about. Tell Draco he will hear from me soon. Good day.” Astoria moved towards the door. She gave Harry one last glance, then left.
Draco propped himself up on his elbow and looked at Harry. “I’m going to miss you too. But it isn’t that long…we’ll be back in this exact spot before you know it.”
Before he could speak on the flavor of the ice cream and ask the man
Harry couldn’t help his jaw from dropping open. “No-no she’s my friend. We’ve never…just, no. And besides, she isn’t exactly my type.” He had no idea why he said it, but there it was.
“Well, his father and I were classmates at school together.” Harry hoped this would appease his godson and that the other boy wouldn’t give him away.
“Harry Potter. Things better not turn ugly!” “Get her mate!” Hermione and Ron spoke at the same time before Hermione heard what her husband said and rolled her eyes.
of things but look at them and…think about them. It really did start small. A quick glance as he noticed a certain someone walking out of the shower, soaking wet and wearing nothing but his towel. A little-too-long stare while playing a game of pick-up Quidditch and focusing on the way that someone’s body moved on a broom. Or, in the case of today, a late-night drinking session.
Ron immediately went red and slammed the door back. Hermione looked at Harry with pity, but Harry stood strong. He refused to let this get to him this year. Dean had occupied enough of his time and energy – it was time to move on. And honestly, seeing him with Ginny was even better. At least this way Harry couldn’t get his hopes up about what could have been…
when can we go to another Chudley Canons match? I want to wear the new jersey I got from Uncle Ron at Christmas!” Scorpius was smiling up at Harry who couldn’t help but glance at Draco who had just rolled his eyes. He still hated that Scorpius was a Canons fan.
Harry wanted to get out of the classroom as soon as he could. He was tossing his books into his bag when, in his haste, he knocked one over onto the floor in front of his table. He let out a groan but quickly stopped when he looked to see someone bending down to pick it up for him. Harry hated himself for how he watched Draco bend over and get the book. But he also hated Draco for bending down like that. Honestly, who
Draco was looking directly at Harry, still wearing the same emotionless expression from earlier.
“Harry, I know I’ve done some really terrible things to you (and others) in the past but trust me – that’s done. I’m not that person anymore. I’ve grown up.” Harry nodded and let Draco continue.
Harry’s fourth year at Hogwarts brought even more excitement. At their opening feast, Headmaster Dumbledore announced that Hogwarts would play host to that year’s TriWizard Tournament. This was an event Harry wasn’t too familiar with but was excited that new students would be entering the school. They were told that, as hosts, they would house students from both Beauxbaton’s Academy of Magic in France and the Durmstrang Institute of Magical Learning in the north.
thinking Harry would never want him, could never want him. But Harry
“I don’t see why not” Draco smirked. There went Harry’s chest.
Something…simple.
Narcissa moved back towards her husband. “Lucius, we’re leaving.” Harry heard her tone change and now sounded much stronger than she had before.
Harry hadn’t spoken to him. Not once. Actually, he hadn’t even
The two carried on casual conversation, discussing work, life after the war, and what the people from Hogwarts that they kept up with were up to. They stayed clear of anything too personal.
As if on cue, Draco chimed in, “I don’t know if that’s really appropriate right now.”
“Have you eaten?” Harry held up a bag that Draco hadn’t noticed before.
“Yes I’m aware. So shouldn’t you be getting ready?”
Draco answered most of Harry’s questions, bypassing the ones that got too personal or too close such as
“Of course.” Draco smiled again and moved towards Harry.
Draco couldn’t stop the smile from creeping onto his face. He quickly moved out of his seat and Harry saw his eyes turn from unsure to the look of
Harry saw Draco’s eyes light up, “Wait a minute. Wait a damn minute! Is the Boy-Who-Lived actually…gay?! I knew it!” Harry was strangely happy to see Draco smiling, but the smile quickly faded as he took another drink.
“Draco…what’s wrong?” Harry looked at his boyfriend’s wide eyes.
Draco turned to look at Harry who must have been wearing a concerned look on his face. Still unsure of what to say.
“And that’s not what you want…?”
“Now, you eat up. I heard you all got back rather late last night.”
“Yeah…he is cool. I just notice you’ve been hanging around him a lot more. So, I’ll ask again. Harry, do you like Dean Thomas? As more than a friend…?”
Draco laughed again, “Oh, poor naïve Potter, you have to be going out to break up. No, Blaise and I were strictly friends with benefits, with heavy
Everyone in the Weasley family cried... Draco knew it was all for various reasons.
“Should we…should we write?” Harry didn’t know why he asked the question. He wasn’t prepared to tell his father about Draco just yet and knew if he was constantly sending his owl, Hedwig, out – his dad would start to ask questions.
When he pulled back, he saw Harry’s eyes wide and in a permanent state of shock and arousal. He waited what felt like minutes but knew could only be seconds. He watched as Harry slowly took one small step forward, then pressed his lips up against Charlie’s. This kiss was chaste, slower, more hesitant. Charlie accepted it and mirrored Harry, not wanting to go too fast. It wasn’t long before the kiss turned back to the heat it had before. Harry started to push back against Charlie and led their way to Charlie’s bed. They stayed this way for a while before Charlie backed away. He opened his eye to see Harry, once again aroused, but no longer in the same state of shock. This Harry looked more sure and more open.
Oh, that’s where he’d seen her before.
The war was quick. And eventually his body won. Harry allowed his hand to travel down under his comforter and under his pants until it found what it wanted. It took an embarrassingly short amount of time before the word
Draco thought he might have overstepped with his jab at Harry during dinner. But as they were finishing up, Harry looked at Draco and said, “Want to grab our brooms and go out to the quidditch pitch?”
During dinner on Wednesday, Draco was met with a rather disgruntled Hermione Granger approaching him. “He wants you to bring him food.”
“Didn’t I tell you not to worry about that, Potter? Blaise and I will be fine, trust me.” Draco gave a sly smile.
“I-I…yes and no. I….” Draco was having a hard time forming words. He took a deep breath and let it out. “Harry. This is what is expected of me. We don’t all have the luxury of having gay godparents and parents who accepted us ‘for who we are’” Harry didn’t like Draco’s patronizing tone.
They sat in an odd silence until luckily, Dean and Seamus came to cut the tension. Draco noticed as the two boys approached the table hand-in-hand and felt a strange feeling enter his stomach…envy?
an us.” Harry returned the smile.
“I heard what happened…with you and Draco…I’m sorry.” Dean alternated between looking at Harry and looking down at the fire.
After the shop, the two made their way towards the Leaky Cauldron. Harry pretended not to notice the stares and whispers happening around them and instead chose to focus on the man next to him. They quickly found a booth towards the back (per Harry’s request – he was still the topic of the Daily Prophet more times than he cared to discuss).
“She came because of the Prophet article. She isn’t here to get Scorpius, she’s here because she doesn’t agree with us! Don’t you dare let her take him!” Draco looked at Harry and Harry could see the anger forming in his eyes.
“But you knew him! We know he lived at the Manor!” Harry attempted to yell back, but Draco cut him off.
of certain things. Ron’s Quidditch posters now stuck out a lot more than they ever had before (which made falling asleep and sharing a room with your best mate very difficult). He was also now in a house with a lot of men. Granted, he saw most of these men as his brothers (they were brothers to Ron after all), but that didn’t stop him from looking…at one in particular.
“True, but she’s your girlfriend, right? I imagine you must be pretty lonely here without her or your other friends.” Harry looked down at the ground.
“Oh Harry….” Was all Hermione could say. Harry decided to stay there the rest of the day in case Normigeon came back with a response with Astoria.
“Thoughts and dreams?” Harry echoed back.
“Actually Ron, I was going to play Draco in a seeker-on-seeker game. Just the two of us.” Draco stood in silence as he watched Ron’s face fall as he sat back at the table.
The two boys danced on the balls of their feet while trying to peer around the (what felt like) millions of people in front of them in line. Teddy’s hair kept changing colors as he saw the different flavors and Scorpius kept pulling on his father’s hand to direct him to ‘look at that one!’.
again. Without even looking behind him, he yelled out, “Go away Potter.”
“Oh, hi.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, we were sympathetic about you coming out because we understood that was a big step for you. But we aren’t going to sit around while you make yourself (and your parents) miserable. So tell us, what happened?”
“You, of course!” Harry looked startled at the sudden excitement in Draco’s voice. “Don’t look at me like that. I can count on one hand the number of gay men in our year and using two hands, the whole school. Half of them are trolls and the other half are Hufflepuffs, so let’s say – I’m intrigued.”
Draco rolled his eyes, again. Okay, this is how the man wants to play this.
“No, I understand all of that. I only recently figured some of this stuff out. I’m probably not ready for anything…serious.” Harry felt confident as he spoke, but that confidence shattered as more words suddenly came out of his mouth. “Unless! Unless you don’t want to do this at all! Which I would COMPLETELY understand. I’m sure it isn’t super exciting to be with a virgin – much less one you’ve known since he was so young and all. I’m just going to go back to my room…”. Harry turned to move towards the door and began to stand. Charlie quickly placed his hand on his forearm and brought him back toward to the bed.
Harry could feel tears starting to form in his eyes and decided to see how much Molly really meant what she was saying. “Thank you…then, is it okay if Draco Malfoy comes over for Christmas tomorrow? I got him a present and I’d like him to open it on Christmas Day.”
“I – I don’t understand. Did you not know you were gay?”
