“No!” he answered defiantly.  “He could fly, and tame dragons, and turn into any animal, and he could fight 10 men at once, and stop a man’s blood.  That can’t be the end.”
This was a fresh start for them.  It was meant to be a life of pleasant things. Long baths, and games, and them being able to enjoy each other’s company without rivalries or politics getting in the way.  Now all of that was threatened.  And what could he do about it other than take Narcissa’s advice? Once again, he cursed himself for handing over the book.  Maybe there was more to this spell than what he had read.  Maybe parts of it had to be performed again and again, and now he would never know.
“With lots of baths.”
“Were you going to deny it?”
With Harry everything was different.  This was someone who wanted nothing from him.  This was someone who loved him despite all the ways in which he had fucked up and all the ways in which he had hurt him.  There was no pretending with him.  No mask to put on. Draco could just be himself, contrary and broken as he was.
“As you wish, Draco,” she went on her tippy toes and kissed his cheeks.  “I don’t like seeing you this miserable, darling.  It isn’t good.  Why don’t you come to dinner with us tonight? He asks about you all the time.  It has been very difficult keeping him from your chambers.  I keep having to make false memories.  It is a lot of work.”
With one last look at the moon above, Draco began to undress.  He took off every item of clothes carefully, delicately, folding it with magic and laying it in a neat pile at the foot of the tub.  It was already November and the chill of the night stung his body, making goosebumps form all over his flesh.  There was a vulnerability to being naked in the dark, and he relished in it.  At last it felt like he was making amends.  He was going to give Harry everything he had to give: his blood and his bones, his dignity and his pride.  Everything part of his body and everything in his life.  All of it.
Mother had laughed, as if he’d said something amusing. He couldn’t see it back then. Today though, he certainly can. “In your case, I doubt it matters. Do you know what the Primogenitium spell does?”
Draco shakes his head. “Nothing,” he mumbles, though he really means
All of a sudden, he feels so alone, extremely alone, panic raising within him because he’d expected shouting or something like that but not this, he’d expected movement, not this stillness that has a bad feeling to it. Smells of resentment and bitterness, and there’s something doubtful in Potter’s gaze which Draco doesn’t quite like, not much.
he is. And all of that, to be nothing at all.
Draco is pretty sure that's not possible.
Draco licks his lips. “Do you want to—?”
“Whatever. Just think about it, you honestly think Zabini is going to last much longer? He’s been shagging you, how long? Six months, and I’m being generous here—do you think he’ll stick forever and ever, take you as his wedded bride, or what?”
Draco grins as well, shaking his head. “You must be joking. You don’t even
“Perhaps, but you know I’m right. Zabini managed to sit right on the middle of the fence all through the war, didn’t he? And look at him now. Chumming with all the new-wave politicians, shaking hands with the Mudblood mid-Ministry… free of all the reparations they had
"I might have!"
Potter rolls his eyes. "Git," he says, but he's smiling.
But he can't move away. He can't Apparate away inside St Mungo's.
“Fine. On my honour, then. Happy?”
Draco looks around the dusty room. He looks at Potter, crouched by the side table next to the bed where Draco’s been sleeping for… he doesn’t even know how long. Hours? Ages? He’s not sure what to say here, he’s just considering mentioning the weather, when Potter offers, “It’s getting late.”
—his own fingers curl in anger on his hair—
how it feels, all right?” He grabs the fag off Pansy’s hand. “Merlin,” he coughs out, smoke riveting out of his mouth after the small drag he took. “Tastes disgusting. Don’t even know how you can smoke this crap.”
“I think I’ve managed to stop the bleeding,” Potter says. “How are you feeling?”
He reckons Father might have disagreed with him there, likely thinking both jobs rate equally in the distasteful scale. Given Father’s ideals though, Draco is prone to believing he got stuck living in a different century—likely the nineteenth, with Queen Victoria ruling over Britain; prosperity and domestic prudery, girls in long skirts and complacency being all Lucius valued most. Yet, Father is Father and not him. By now, Draco can send Father’s thoughts to hell and wish them to stay there forever. If it weren’t for him, Mother would still be alive, and he wouldn’t have the Mark etched into his skin.
be back.
Potter swears, stretching an arm over the back of couch. There are a few whispered words before something hard slaps into Potter's hand, and then Draco can feel a slick finger rubbing at his entrance. "Okay?"
“You knew all along,” he said. It wasn’t an accusation, though it should have been. It wasn’t a preconception, though it could have been, had he not gotten to know her quite a bit in the past few months. It was merely a supposition based on facts, facts presented.
"And you're such an arse." Harry shifts a bit closer then. He rests his elbows on Draco's bed, and stares fixedly at Draco for what seems like hours. Draco tries so hard to put everything he's feeling into his eyes—right there, for Harry to see. And he has no idea if that works, but eventually Harry crosses his arms and buries his face in Draco's blankets. "That's all you ever had to do, you know? Assaulting me in dark corridors is hardly conducive to getting a date with me." Harry's body shakes a little, as if he were laughing—or crying—and so does his voice when he speaks again, "All you ever had to say was that."
Merlin, he’s so screwed. And there’s no one here to save him now.
anymore, and what does he know about magical maladies anyway?
"I beg your pardon?"
"If you did, if you really were ever serious about things, you wouldn't have—" Potter presses his lips into a thin line. "Never mind," he finishes, turning towards the door.
"Well, I did study Potions, and I know this particular potion will work better when brewed this way."
The morning after, Draco went through the motions as he did every other morning: he cast a shaving spell and had a shower, he changed into a clean uniform and then stood in front of the bathroom mirror combing his hair away from his face—all while resolutely ignoring the depraved winks his mirror image kept sending his way.
And Potter wants forgiveness now? Well, Draco isn’t feeling extremely forgiving these days. Potter can wait. (Wait forever with his pants on fire, for all he is is a liar and a cheat. A despicable cheat. Cheating on him with Weasel’s sis and then cheating on her with him.) Draco has to admit he won’t be too sorry if he waits until the end of times. It’s what he deserves.
"Please," Harry would say softly, "For me," and something fragile would flutter in Draco's chest—something dangerous, and Draco was never a risk taker but he'd welcome it anyway.
"Are you sure that's wise? What if he sacks you?" Draco asks, but Harry rolls his eyes and says, "While I appreciate your concern, I'm not nearly as destitute as you seem to think."
"Perhaps." Potter scrubs his face. "Only then I took it to Hermione and she told me this is actually a potion meant for pregnant wizards."
His brain is doing that thing again, where it’s both hazy and a mess and… and it won’t work right. He curls up next to the door, arms around his knees, his own head resting between his legs. He really, really wants a drink. Draco blinks steadily while his mind works to justify the need.
Draco licks one last strip up Harry's gorgeous cock before he stands.
In Draco's dreams, Hermione would drag him out for a pint at an old Muggle pub every Friday evening. As usual, the Weasel would trail behind her, dragging along a very reluctant-looking Harry. And Harry would look stunning—so spectacularly fit in his torn jeans and leather jacket that Draco's lungs would simply refuse to cooperate for a while, and he'd be left breathless.
*   *   *
"Well, go on then." Robards waves him off with an irritated frown, and Draco walks calmly out of his boss' office.
Potter mumbles, “No…”
shut up and listen. I don’t want you to mess this up again, you already did once and it nearly—” She grabs his wrist, pulling him back. “Listen to me, you twat. Do you remember what you said to me back in sixth year?”
“So that’s how it is in Muggle's programming,” Hermione was saying on the way back to the Ministry. “Basically, you spell something, anything, wrong, and the whole thing stops working until you find
“Why not?” said Fred, again. “Well, he might think he’s gone...”
"You know," she says a while later, "at the time I thought it was just your pride that got hurt. Like, no one had ever dumped you before Harry, or something."
Potter's hips are moving against his crotch, sinfully slow, and he'll never want to run away from this.
“You wouldn’t last for very long out there, Draco. Last time you tried to do that, you couldn’t even get one of their passwords.”
"You bloody impossible ponce," Harry says between hard kisses, "of course you'd be worried about your stupid hair."
“Did you now?” Draco asks. What else could he say? Shocking is really rather shocking. “How come?”
"Well, is this supposed to be you, then? His current—" Pansy lifts her hands, flexing her fingers to make air quotes around the word, "—girlfriend?"
It's right then that Draco decides it might be best to ignore Potter for the rest of his time here, to stop looking his way whenever he's near. Of course, he fails miserably not even ten minutes after reaching that resolution—but none of that keeps him from noticing how Potter has definitely stopped looking back. For now, at least.
Near the end of the second month, Harry goes back to England for a week. After taking a Portkey back to San Gimignano, he assures Draco—who has never even asked—that he's put all his affairs in order. He says he's talked to his team captain and told him he'd be prolonging his holiday.
“You think?” Draco looks down at his stomach. It looks pretty much as it’s looked for a while. A bit larger than usual, but still, that’s not a good reason to call him fat to his face.
"So . . ." He clears his throat. "I think you need to get back to St Mungo's."
"Hm?"
"She's in there right now," Potter said, pointing vaguely towards the office at the end of the infirmary. "Talking to McGonagall, I guess."
"I figured that much, you didn't even know what a telly was a few weeks ago."
“What?” he asks. At Pansy’s lack of reply, he glances up, only to find Pans smirking down at him like one of the pros online. (Draco has seen them on that YouTube thing Muggles watch. He quite likes it. They tend to call themselves trolls, Salazar knows why, especially since they’re all too tiny to look in anyway trollish.) “No.” Draco’s eyes narrow. He knows where this is going and, “Pans,
All in all, most of that has created an odd mix of hate swirling into his love, that he’s certainly sure none of the men proposing to him deserves.
"I did study Healing," Potter says tightly, "and I know enough to know that potion you're trying to—"
"Malfoy," he says curtly when their paths cross.
Disgusting.

The room falls into silence, nothing but their soft breathing to break it. It's the happiest Draco has been in years—here, collapsed under Harry Potter, in a room that smells like sex and sweat. Sure, it's far from a fairy tale ending, but it works for him all the same.
His father would have agreed. But Draco likes the other answers better, the ones that sound like stories, the ones about towers that grow while their owners are away. They make him feel a bit like he did when he was younger and Father would read him fairy tales before bed. Even now, they're the ones that allow him to dream.
He's been highly strung all day—and tired, so very tired. He's messed up the three charmed teacups he was supposed to fix today—all three of them, for fuck's sake—and he honestly can't deal with any of this right now.

. . . it was a very different thing to hide your feelings twenty-four-seven.
“Ooh-kay.” Hermione said to Ron. “Say, you ever tried to solve Einstein’s riddle?”
His heart stops.
“Good?”
"Can I—will you let me—" Potter asks, his voice cracking slightly near the end.
In the end Pansy’s suggestion turns into a plan by itself, mostly by twists of fate. Draco’s actions have very little to do with it. It just so happens Potter thinks he’s in an abusive relationship. “I think it was his boyfriend. He must have beat him up,” Draco hears him tell one of his mediwizards.
Harry first noticed his clock was off during breakfast. He was conscientiously licking a tiny droplet of strawberry jam hanging on the edge of his thumb, when he somehow noticed, for some odd reason, that there was a one where there should be a two under the ‘day’ sticker. He had to admit that was a teeny, tiny ickle bit weird — especially on a magical clock — because it wasn’t just one hour or two, but a
, a tiny deal with Kreacher just so he takes the blame… why not, after all? Harry would look much better without them, and he caught Kreacher some days ago, glance full of want at one of Draco’s scarves while he was cleaning his—no,
“Whatever.”
"Do you know what the worst thing is about all this?" Potter goes on. Now that the ice is gone from his eyes, he looks so much like the Potter Draco remembers from their eighth year, it's almost uncanny. Disconcerting. "I don't even know what I did to make you run away like—"
He watches Potter's face vanish into the green flames of his fireplace before falling back on his couch.
“Yes, it is, come on, aren’t you dying to beat me at Quidditch?”
“You have to teach me that spell.  Then I won’t have to shout for you,” he said.  When she tried to open her mouth again, he continued: “I don’t need your advice and I don’t want your opinion.”  He stared down at Harry.  “Do you think you can walk now?”
His posture straightened. He was not going to be able to manage this alone.  He needed an ally, and there was really only one he would consider.
Slowly he retreated from the remains, his steps echoing in the chamber.
“Yeah.  Mostly as self-defence against the Dursleys, or the kids at school.  But of course, I didn’t know it was really magic.”
“That is of no help at all-”  he turned his attention to the Death Eaters behind Harry.  “Anybody care to voice an opinion?”
Without another glance he began walking into the forest.
Of all the years they had lived together at Hogwarts it was 6th year that came back to haunt him the most.  He had been so desperate, so focused on completing his mission, on saving his family.  It was the first year where Harry was more obsessed with him than he had been with Harry.  He could feel the boy watching him.  He knew that he was being followed, observed, suspected.
“Goodbye Draco,” said the Dark Lord, taking a step toward the door, his cloak escaping from between Draco fingers.  “I wish you a long, fulfilling life.”
“Yes.”
“Did you sleep at all?”
His stomach rumbled as he stood and, grudgingly, he went over to the small silver bell that they used to summon the house elf.  He rang it and heard Harry toss in bed.  A second later Diri had appeared. She was a young elf, with pointed ears, huge blue eyes, and a mouth that always trembled with apprehension.
That had not been on purpose.  He hadn’t meant to disappear from the lives of the people who had once (so long ago) meant so much to him.  It had just happened.  After he got the Dark Mark, all of his priorities had switched.  And Hogwarts had seemed the stuff of children.  If he hadn’t been so horrified by the Dark Lord’s presence at Malfoy Manor, he probably would not have attended his last year.   What was the point anyway? It didn’t mean anything to him anymore.  And neither did people like Goyle or Pansy.  They were not bad, really, they were simply part of his past, like the stuffed animals he had gotten too grown to play with.
He slumped over. It felt like he was going to be sick.  Like he was fading away.  He could feel his visioning tunneling in, but he had to push past that.  He had to do this alone, and he had to do this to the best of his abilities.  Harry was counting on him.  Feeling strangely out of equilibrium, he rested his head against the side of the tub.  It was smeared with his own blood, and he was sure it was leaving a mark on his forehead as he gathered up his strength for the next challenge.
“Does it-” Draco began before Harry cut him off.
It happened unexpectedly, one moment he could not move and the next he was falling.
He supposed searching for old magic was a little like investigating a crime scene.  He would choose a place to start and then surround it by a magical perimeter.  He would walk around it, fiddling with his wand, touching boulders and cliff walls, trying to feel the pulse of magic beneath them.  He looked for runes as well, for markers, for anything that might indicate the presence of wizards.
And that was the best that Draco could hope for him. That he did not feel the torment and trauma that his body was being subjected to.  But Draco felt it.  He felt every stab and every curse.  He felt a revolting anguish when they began, again, to physically pull him apart.  To rip out fingers by magic, suspending them in the air like darts and then shooting them at Draco as they laughed.  Breaking all the bones of his feet with one of Lucius walking canes, the sound a disgusting symphony.  He watched as the Death Eaters grew more and more violent, eager to outdo each other, eager to show their master how little value they placed on life.
For six days Draco felt the anticipation mounting.  He tried to remember his resolution at Cepheus’s grave and continued grooming and dressing with his father in mind, not letting his grip on reality weaken.  His days, however, were spent with Harry.  Sometimes he talked to him, sometimes they sat in silence together.  Being close to him now felt like a necessity.
Harry kissed him properly, his mouth warm and welcoming.
He wrote so to his mother, and to Lucius.  He wanted them to feel the same certainty that was coursing through his veins.  To understand that there was to be no turning back, and no failure, either.
Harry’s torso, however, was almost the worst and despite the protection of the air bubble, he gagged again just by its sight.  He had been ripped open just under the belly, like a pig for slaughter, half the organs missing from within. Draco turned away as he raised the severed head out of the grave.  He did not need to see that, he couldn’t see that.  But he heard it drop among the other pieces into the tub.  Lastly, he moved the rotting bits of blackened meat that had once been innards.
“He’s resting.”
One day he made the mistake of looking into the Dark Lord’s eyes.
He moved closer to Harry on the bed, shrinking the distance between them.  They lay on the same pillow, and he put his arm around him.  Natural as ever, Harry lay his head on Draco’s shoulder, shuffling his body slightly downward until they were comfortably tucked into each other.  Draco kissed the top of his head, Harry’s messy hair tickling his nose.
How would 7th year have been different if Harry had been there? If they had had one last Quidditch match?  If they had shared classes together? If Draco could have looked across the Great Hall and seen him, surrounded by red heads, smiling placidly?
“What do you mean by ‘gray wizards,’ and why do you know more about my family that I do?”
“Don’t we all.”
Weasley chose that moment to grunt loudly in protest. He was wriggling on the ground where Draco had deposited him like a worm, the
Then he was lost.
Distantly, he heard the clattering of heels. “What happened?” Pomfrey said. “Oh my, Mr. Malfoy! Who did this to you?”
“Our so-called ‘Dark Lord’ is merely some self-important half-blood who’s a pathetic excuse for a
He would begin by escaping.
In the late summer of his sixteenth year, around when the end of break approached, Draco realized he was going to die. There was no epiphany, or sudden return to morality; it came in slow gradations, and as the Dark Lord’s occupancy wore on, it seemed to him the inevitable conclusion of their involvement. Their lord was impulsive and easily provoked, and would oscillate from one emotional extreme to another with little warning. At some point, Draco going to do or say the wrong thing and that would be it. Dead. And on a whim, at that. The illustrious Malfoy line cut short before the turn of the twenty-first century.
“OUT, NOW,” Severus said, with a note of finality to his voice. “Or there will be consequences!”
“Alright, you idiot. I’m finished with this nonsense,” Draco hissed at him, then transfigured the floor around them into a makeshift barrier. Farley shrieked in rage on the other side, and the carpet-mound shuddered beneath an intense hail of spellfire.
They were met with chaos at the scene. A group of older years were gathered around a compartment, wands poised at a figure cloistered away within. There was a high-pitched whimpering coming from within, punctuated by the errant drunken slur. It seemed Montague had a hostage.
Draco said hoarsely.
“Then get me two blood-replenishing potions, a vial of moon-balm…” Her voice faded as the darkness wavering on the periphery of his vision encroached further. He was slipping away, and not even Pomfrey could stop it now.
“What the hell do you mean, ‘bastard?’” The other one slurred, staggering upright. He was rather small and awkward-looking, but the curse scar and green eyes were unmistakable. He even smelled of mint.
“Am I supposedly some sort of altruist now? It’s ironic that becoming a murderer would improve your opinion of me. I assure you I’m just as terrible as I’ve always been.”
“Would I’d have bothered coming if I wasn’t?” Draco said sarcastically. “Let’s just get this over with.” The irony of Montague potentially hiding out in a clockmaker’s was not lost on him.
"What’s that, Malfoy?”
The next spell Draco fired caught the accomplice head-on, blasting them back into the wall hard enough to leave a hole in the plaster. The disillusionment charm dispersed upon her losing consciousness, and it revealed a bedraggled-looking Ravenclaw whom he vaguely recognized as having been in the year below him in school.
“How could he lie to me? For months? What am I going to do after he’s gone? I can’t defeat Voldemort without him.” Potter appeared so genuinely distressed that Draco almost felt sorry for him. But he only had the emotional capacity to pity one person at a time, and currently, that person was himself. Besides, it was
“Much appreciated, Auror Potter,” she said cordially, then drew back the curtain and led him inside.
“It’s okay, Potter. I’m ready,” he said, blinking blood away. “I’m going to see my mother again, and my father…”
He snapped his fingers, and another one of his Aurors walked over to him. “Make sure to interview the portraits—all of them. They should be hiding elsewhere in the manor. The house elves, too,” he said, and received a brief nod in response. “I’ll be heading to St. Mungo’s to conduct interviews with the survivors.”
Severus seemed to deflate at that, and sank into one of the nearby chairs. “You nearly died last night, Draco,” he said. “Whatever you ritual you performed, it certainly worked. Every Death Eater who passed through the vanishing cabinet has died. Greyback also succumbed to his… injuries. Being the perpetrator, what do you suggest the Headmaster and I do with you?”
“I thought we agreed not to discuss that again! And it wasn’t a poltergeist, it was a wraith!”
Harry said nothing. The irony of Malfoy’s predicament was not lost on him, but he would never wish something so horrible on anyone—even his childhood foil.
It had been some time since Draco had been this intimate with the baser elements of the self. But he could not collect himself enough to try and reform them, and the despair welling up within him threatened to spill over. He tried to sit up, only to find that he was bound to the hospital bed by several sets of sturdy, silvery ropes.
“Greyback. He—he’s dead, I think? But he bit him, right there on his bloody face. Clawed him up too, I reckon.”
“Just let me die,” Draco slurred, sounding faint even to his own ears. “I don’t want to live like this. I’m ready. I promise, I’m ready.”
“No.”
Draco had been caught breaking into Shyverwretch's Venoms and Poisons during a case and wound up tossed back in the same cell between his mother and father. It had been a full moon that night. He’d kept them up with the change: bones snapping and splintering, skin rending apart like the whole of his body was an open wound, and screams that soon turned into howls. It had been the most humiliating experience of his life. His mother had not spoken to him for days after, but the next morning his father had said something to Draco he’d never forget. He had been… kind.
Then he was given an impossible task. Perhaps he should have been surprised, but the Dark Lord did not take failure lightly. He was expected to fail. It would simply be the latest in a series of humiliations. Narcissa had a permanent tremor in her wand hand now. His father looked half-starved and hunted. As for him… well, it didn’t matter. If he stayed, he would only prolong the inevitable. But even knowing that, he couldn’t bring himself to leave; and even if he did, they would kill him anyways. There was no alternative recourse for him or his family. That had been lost the moment his father took the mark.
“I’d reckon the most ‘unexpected’ aspect about all this is the time-travel.”
Potter ran a hand through his hair. “There has to be a partner of some kind. Someone we haven’t found yet. Not unless—”
There was an awkward cough. “Er, Malfoy?” The voice came from behind the curtains, and a brown hand peeked through to part them. Potter looked a right mess, hair standing on end and covered with what Draco assumed was his own blood. Hot shame cut through him at that.
“Er, Hermione’s parents’ house, maybe? I can’t recall the exact address though. I didn’t visit them until they had moved—well, forcibly relocated, really—to Australia. Give me a moment…”
His mother reappeared at the mouth of the cabinet, but this time did not hesitate and crossed the threshold. Immediately she was pulled forward into the circle proper, body jerked into the air by the invisible threads of magic he’d woven. The wards were not powered by him, but rather by the magic of its victims, who were held in suspension until completely drained. They were both the catalyst and the conduit for the Black Kill Wards. His mother did not scream, and almost looked peaceful to him. It would not be long until he looked that way, too.
Potter, for his part, looked bemused. “I’m being threatened by a teenager. Again. It’s almost like being back in school with you. She’s got the dramatics down and everything.”
He knew they would make her enter first. But she would help him, of that he was certain. Blood called to blood.
“I’ve… also got a hostage?”
“Rastrick, I’m unofficially considering this self-defense. Send the bodies to the Coroner’s Office at St. Mungo’s. The lingering magical residue should corroborate my estimation, but have the Healers check for defensive wounds on the Malfoys—all of them—for further evidence. Make sure to run diagnostic spells on the wands, as well,” he said. Rastrick nodded at this, then made to fire-call the Aurors stationed at St. Mungo’s.
“Yes, Potter. I’d like it if you’d kindly piss off so I can finally kill myself in peace!” Draco yelled after him. Potter started towards his bed again, paying no mind to Severus’ wand, which was still raised threateningly.
he was doing it, then it was her.
Malfoy Manor was a crime scene. Harry had arrived as soon as he was able, first flooing to the Ministry before taking any direct action himself. Two squadrons had already been dispatched to the grounds proper, and another to St. Mungo’s, where the call had been placed. One of Harry’s subordinates, Wickham, briefed him on the night’s events. At around six in the evening, the outer wards had been breached by an unknown assailant. Narcissa Malfoy had sent a house elf to investigate, and when it did not return, sought out the disturbance herself. Draco had gone with her, leaving his wife, Astoria, and young son, Scorpius, safely hidden inside the manor. Fenrir Greyback, Augustus Rookwood, and Corban Yaxley were waiting for them. It was an ambush.
“I’d be surprised if you actually went through with it, Malfoy, because I think you’re too much of a coward to actually do anything of the sort. So, I’m sure you’ll still be here after today, and that you’ll actually have to live with what you’ve done.”
“Let’s take them with us for now, and decide on the drop-off point when I’m not covered in Montague’s insides.”
“Then you know I was a fool to let her stay in the manor. After all those offers of relocation, and year of repeat incidents—still we stayed. It was only a matter of time before this happened,” he said bitterly, although it was a sentiment directed primarily at himself.
“What do you mean, ‘if I really am Potter?’ I think I know who I am, thank you very much!”
He dreamed of wolves. There was no higher thought, only sensation; and at first he was daunted by it, but then the freedom of being an animal took over. The blood between his teeth satisfied something deep within him, and the grass beneath his paws was impossibly soft. He could not speak, yet felt no need to. Light from the full moon trickled through the canopy of branches overhead, and as he drew further into the wood the undergrowth became harder to pass. But still he pressed on, though; faster, quicker, until he was moving with such force he was almost flying. Beyond the next turn was a small clearing, and at the far end stood a stag with startlingly green eyes, presiding over a pool of water. He approached it with no fatal intent, and instead pressed himself up against the stag, inhaling the smell of mint—
He sighed. “You asked me why I defected. I already told you, but I suppose you want an easier answer. I’m afraid no such one exists. There’s too many valuable bloodlines here, besides; and they’d have killed whomever they pleased if I had allowed even one of them in.”
“Oh, my son,” she breathed, eyes flashing with recognition. “You have done well. We will see each other again very soon, won’t we?”
It was then that Draco finally recalled the events that had precipitated his departure and subsequent reappearance on the Hogwarts Express. He also recalled that before disappearing he’d latched onto Montague, which could mean all manner of trouble. This could very well not be Potter, if they had indeed gotten mixed-up during the trip. He drew his wand and pointed it at the other boy.
“What?” He slurred, trying to turn towards her but instead stumbling into the nearest wall. “What the bloody hell is it?”
“That’s not something I would brag about. Ever! And it wasn’t a poltergeist! And it was an accident!”
Severus continued, “It is too dangerous for you to stay at Hogwarts any longer. Your defection will be common enough knowledge soon in Slytherin, and your condition is impossible to hide at this juncture. Later today, two Order members will be by to transport you to one of our safe houses. The Headmaster will speak to you further about your actions in the Room of Requirement there.”
“Twice.”
Harry shifted uncomfortably. “You were bitten?”
Draco slowed his pace and proceeded to inspect the corridor for warning spells, disarming several, while Potter crept along just ahead of him. They had worked together on several occasions prior, although it had never been just the two of them, so he and Potter had some passing familiarity with each other’s fighting techniques. Draco knew Potter was more adept at close-range offensive maneuvers, whereas he preferred to duel at a distance, so he was content to allow him the first strike.
He’d been so full of life, then.
don’t care about him, and that’s that.”
"How are you?" she asks.

Draco wants to tell him he'd cast an Impervius, that he's perfectly dry and nowhere near that useless. Instead, he finds himself being dragged to the couch, a soft mauve thing that feels oddly deformed against his backside.
"Is that a threat?" Draco grits out.
Admittedly, with all concerning his brief toss and turn with Potter, Draco thinks Muggles are better off not knowing what they don’t already know. Like the fact that he’s the one who got pregnant, and wasn’t exactly dating a girl at the time. He seems to have given them the wrong impression though, since ironically he keeps having blokes proposing to him night and day. It’s not that
"What? Left it there and moved on?"
made the headlines after the trials.
.” Plus, it’s all they talk about.
, because Potter might think it’s not ethical and whatnot, but Potter here is rolling in millions, and millions of millions, and he could certainly spare a few. Draco was merely hoping for some extra cash, mostly to pay back Pans for all the months she’s let him stay at hers. It’s not like he is going to ask
“So?”
. It just loops over itself repeating the same mistake again and again until you fix it within the code.”
"But you did."
“Oh, I’m certainly not kidding. You see, your boyfriend used to be a whore. For pay, too, and rather cheap. He stayed with me quite a few nights, didn’t you, Draco, dear?”
Right then, he only had eyes for Potter, and Potter stood frozen by the door. There were a million tiny snowflakes slowly melting in his hair, and a little red in his cheeks from the sharp November wind just outside. He looked tired, and Draco thought he looked gorgeous all the same, which was so ridiculous it bordered on silly. Then again, when had Draco been anything but, when it came to Potter?
"Seriously, what's up with you and that thing? You're
Draco clears his throat.
He’s not even sure he wants Harry to know that. Ever. He’d give his world for it to be mutual, for Potter to feel the way he feels about him, but he can’t say that. Not with the future of his child up in the air and swinging, so he puts his hands on Potter’s shoulders, and kisses him.
“Would you, now…” A brief kiss. “And now you’re thinking about something, aren’t you?” Draco says, basically repeating Harry’s question back at him. “What’s on your mind?”
Potter shoves a hand into his trouser pocket, pulling out a small glass vial filled with blood-coloured liquid. Plumpton's Prenatal Devigoration Solution. It makes Draco's throat burn when he swallows it and his mouth tastes of mouldy cottage cheese and cheap liquor for hours afterwards, but it's the best—the safest—over the counter sleep aid for pregnant wizards. The only one specifically designed with them in mind.
"I mean that. I could. In fact, I could probably have you sacked—they did ask me if I wanted to press charges after your stunt the other day."
“I’m a whore,” he hears himself say. Meanwhile, the blur that is his mind panics because that is
get there: nothing he’s done so far has pushed Potter to take the first step. Draco knows quite well how to act when it comes to sex—years of practice and whatnot—but this whole
"No," Harry said, but then added, "I mean, not unless you want me to."
“Voyeur,” Draco says, while Potter pulls him close. Hands sliding up Draco’s back, trapping him in an embrace he doesn’t want out of. “That’s what you are.”
But he also wants this. He wants Potter to make love to him gently. He wants him to stay afterwards, to cuddle through the night, to bring Draco breakfast in the morning, because apparently he's a bit of a hopeless sop when it comes to Harry bloody Potter.
He pushes Potter back quite hard. Before it breaks
Only Potter doesn't leave. He refuses to leave with that same stubborn set to his jaw Draco had come to know so well during their school days—the same one Potter always wore when Draco mocked him, or when the
, aside from Pansy. He never took the potion before seeing him…
“Rather intimate,” says Potter, finally, “with someone that night.” It puts a smirk on Draco’s face.
He waits inside the pub, getting increasingly tetchy as time passes and passes and Potter’s
"Really."
* * *
Sure, he spends most of his nights thinking about it, but he doesn't mention that to Pansy—he never mentions that to
“I can’t live without you,” Potter tells him two days later. “Please, please, come back,” he begs, a week later. “What do I have to do to have you come back here,” he asks, two weeks gone by. “What do I have to do? I’ll do anything.”
“Yes, come on.” His voice makes Potter shudder, either from the warmth on his neck or perhaps from Draco’s words—he knows what they mean, how could he not? It’s not like Draco knows which one it is, but regardless he’s quite pleased. He can’t help himself. “‘It’s cold out there, but it’s warm in bed’,” he croons, quoting a song Potter should know. Somehow, it doesn’t look like he gets it. “I need you. Don’t make me fuck myself.”
his best friend, so there's likely not much he can do about that—but still, he's on the verge of saying something cranky when a slow grin spreads across her face.
, Draco’s mind whispers, back to Weasel’s sis. But he smiles a wry smile, and says, “Sure. Don’t let me keep you.”
Draco beams a nervous smile. “Well, I’m here now not there, so…” So why not make use of this time? He wants to remember this. He doesn’t want it taken from him by yet another Obliviation.
If Miller wants him dead, well… he’s quit opposing.
,” the woman said, just before Draco passed out.
“Does any of that,” Draco spits, furiously, “sound especially paternal to you?”
Later that day, Draco thinks about the whole conversation and regrets almost instantly agreeing to what Potter said. Agreeing to it might mean Potter not needing to drop by so often, a large step backwards on his whole wooing Potter plan. It’s just a shame his plan got somehow, someway lost during that convo, partly thanks to all the glaring that seemed to sway his mind elsewhere. More towards
He’s not too fond of belatedness when it comes to his job, it tends to create a bad relationship between him and his clients, one that he’s not too keen on putting up with. On top of that, he’s going to have to take a potion over the last one, which still hasn’t worn off. He’s not sure if that affects how they work. Honestly, his Potions lessons feel ages ago, did Snape ever say anything about that in class? He pauses for a minute, thinking. He might have, but was he talking about Polyjuice or some other potion? Not sure, not yet. Regardless, considering what he’s going to get paid, it might be worth a try. It’s definitely plenty of cash.
"Says you."
find out, if Potter has his way.
Potter leaves. Draco puts his hands on his face, scrubs them hard over his cheeks. Shit.
Draco slowly turns around. Potter is standing there, holding a beer in his hand, and even after all these years he still looks just as stunning as he always has in Draco's mind—a bit older, sure, but stunning all the same. Draco really, really wants to hate him for that, only he's never figured out how.
, his mind yells at him, and it’s right. The child is his and not Potter’s, Potter wasn’t even there when he gave birth. But by now Draco is contemplating banging his head against the wall, repeatedly, unendingly, and rather seriously too.)
"I know it's going to be all over the papers, 'Harry Potter, getting it on with former Death Eater—"
, like the acres of grass in the Malfoy estate.
"Because I didn't know, okay? Male pregnancies are so bloody rare, how was I supposed to know—but of course you're you."
“How come you ended up here—I mean...”
.” Harry lifted the drink to his lips. “And now he’s over there—” he pointed at them, though he was pretty sure Hermione saw nothing, or she saw him pointing towards the wall, or Merlin knows what, “—along with Fred. They’re discussing your poor taste in décor and the abundance of books stacked on piles around your floor, in case you’re even remotely interested. But you’re not, are you? Cause you can’t hear them. Because you can’t bloody
"Fine? Just fine? Is Seeker Potter not as brilliant a shag as the papers make him out to be?"
"Really now? And since when do you know anything about potions?"
"It's complicated, all right?"
, and yet, Draco loves every second of it.
Potter mutters something he can’t quite get, though it rather sounds like ‘in exchange for sex’, and Draco’s quite sure the last part includes ‘bloody tosser’. Then, Potter takes off his glasses, and rubs his nose.
. He doesn’t say,
“I just… I don’t know. See, sometimes I don’t think she gets me at all.”
"Fuck off," Draco said, but he was smiling. As soon as Potter looked away, he slid his foot a couple of inches to the right—just a couple of inches, just until it was barely brushing against Potter's.
“After the gala?”

*   *   *
“I got a Floo call from Wright while you were gone,” Pansy tells him when he gets home. “He wanted to set a date. I didn’t know what to tell him.”
Draco tells himself as he waits for his heart to slow down.
And so Harry leaves.
“Who’s the Healer on call?” he heard a woman saying, somewhere nearby. Another voice answered back. A man, he thinks, but it was too far and too diluted for Draco to make sense of diffident sounds and misheard words. He remembers blinking his eyes open then. The woman’s wand seemed to be glowing. Travelling around his torso, there was a warm ball of bluish light. It felt good. For a moment there, Draco felt so peaceful, unconcerned by anything else. “Well, tell him to get here
"And when exactly would that be?" Pansy snaps, crossing her arms over her chest, but then she catches the look on Draco's face and her whole countenance softens. "You know, you should probably go to St Mungo's. You're always tired these days, you're always moody, and I'm beginning to think you must have caught something from Potter."
“Aren’t I?” she says, smiling. “You weren’t so bad yourself, I have to admit, though I always stood behind Harry…”
what he’s supposed to say. This is
“It’s quite a bit like Muggle’s programming,” she said.
"Yeah."
Draco watches, somewhat dazedly, as Potter walks out of his shop. He has a feeling he won't be getting much done for what's left of the day—which, thankfully, isn't much.
Later that night, as everything inside Draco tightened, as his world melted into a blur of want and need and
They were both sipping their tea, quietly, when Hermione said, “I’m sure you remember that Fred Weasley died during the battle, back on 1998.”
Draco dreamt that night that he'd wake up in Harry's bed, stirred awake by the soft spicy scent of Harry's deodorant. He dreamt he'd blink his eyes open slowly, sleepily, and Harry would be there to run gentle fingers through his hair—to kiss him—and Draco's heart would for once beat at the right pace.
“Chop-chop then,” Draco tells her. It gets him a wink and a, “Win him over! Do your best.”
“Oh, come on… please?” For a moment there, Draco hates his heart. It really should stop thumping like that, making him feel guilty over the tiny spark of hope in Potter’s eyes. He’s not the one doing something
Draco knows he will, eventually.
"Is that a promise? Because I'll hold you to it if it is."
“I just stopped by to check on you. How are you feeling?”
,” he corrects himself, eager to change the subject.
Draco, raising his brows, has to concede that much. It’s definitely crap, since Potter’s all they ever notice, but instead of agreeing with him, he reads aloud
“I lied to you, that day, when you healed me,” he tells Harry that night, way after Granger and Weasel have left. “It’s not exactly true that I have no one. I’ve always had Pansy.”
Except none of that happens.
"Good. So, er—" Potter's fingers flexed at is side, curling then uncurling in a mockery of Draco's memories. He had felt that same hand tracing the line of his jaw, making fists of his hair, and it had felt brilliant—it had felt so impossibly brilliant, "—see you around?" And this was Potter telling him that it was over—
Harry turns on his side, his head resting on his hand. “I know. It didn’t take me too long to figure that out. My couch, down there, it never did smell of azaleas before you got here. Put two and two together and—”
It’s what Draco has been hoping to hear for quite a while. It only hurts that it comes now, after his tiny fight with Weasel, after Harry fucked him like the whore he is—
It was already quite late when he woke up. He’s showered and brushed his teeth, and he’s now trying to pick one among all the new polo shirts he’s been hoarding in Regulus’ wardrobe. He wants to wear the grey one on Monday, when Harry—bollocks,
“Anything?” Draco asks, because this is too good to let go. He has a rather long list of things he’d like to ask for: love, cash, admiration, self-esteem… the luck Potter vilely stole from him, now eleven years ago. He’d like to have all that back. Sadly, Potter’s magic owns not fate, and fate is nothing but irredeemable chaos. Draco knows that much, his own life is more than proof of it.
"… armed and dangerous, so keep that in mind," Robards is saying. "Do not take unnecessary risks. Do not engage them until back-up gets there, do you understand?"
. “Signs that he may have been quite…” Draco pictures his brows puddled mid-forehead, that face Potter makes when he’s thinking hard about something. He guesses he’s trying to find a word here, one that would make that night sound quite lighter than it was—then again, Potter doesn’t know how it was. He doesn’t know how Draco feels about it.
"Body Reading, I think, though perhaps Mind-Healing as well."
Sometimes, he takes a pause and compares what his life was like before the war—before everything went to hell and back, and everything he believed lost any kind of meaning it ever had to him—and what it is now. The more he thinks about it, the clearer and clearer it becomes that there’s only one single thing his current life shares with the one before. And that one constant, funnily enough, is his habit of reading the paper first thing when he wakes up. He reckons that the bright side (or perhaps the not-so-bright side) is that he still can’t seem to get his head around why he even bothers. He has a theory, albeit a flimsy one: he likes to read the
. But how to solve this, when he can’t even tell Potter and hope for the best?
"True," Narcissa says after a long pause. "You seem sad, I suppose I thought you might like it there. They keep several artworks from the renaissance—paintings, frescoes mostly. You always did enjoy a beautiful scenery."
now.”
“Oh, nothing. I’m just finding it hard to believe you managed to beat a vampire without even your wand. Are you sure you didn’t have a couple of trolls helping you?”
“Do I?”
His hand tightened around his neck. Draco’s hands clenched around his fingers before breath ran out of him. His heart was thumping in his ears, panic rose with every heartbeat.
Draco rolls his eyes. "I obviously don't give you enough credit."
“Would you at least consider it?” he asks, again. “We don’t even have to date…”
His voice sometimes wakes up the lethargic droopy portraits on the walls of the corridor. They stretch and look down at him, with interest. “Isn’t that Narcissa’s son?” one of them whispers. “Indeed,” an old man wearing a tuxedo says, “I believe he is. What was his name?”
"Er, I don't really . . ." Draco looks at Potter. He's still wearing his lime-coloured scrubs, though judging by the time it is, he must have been on his way home. His hair is tousled, falling artlessly around his face, and yet he still looks just as gorgeous as he always has in Draco's mind. "Pansy told me you were working here now."
Potter, however, never seems too opposed.
, I might add.”
, and not before.
"You thought I was sleeping around."
He wakes up the next day, along with a massive hangover, and goes back to his life as it is nowadays. Yes, sure, Corbyn, labeled five. He’ll go to Walker’s place tonight. No issues, it’s all fine.
, they seem to whisper,
Harry would reach a hand up, caress Draco's lower lip with his thumb, and mumble, "The Order would still have you. I'd always have you," and Draco would angle his head, just a bit, and press his lips to Harry's in a chaste kiss. He'd feel a light puff of breath against his lips right before Harry kissed him back, but Harry
over his shoulder. He doubts any of them hit, but at least they'll keep them busy—distract them while he catches up to Harry.
. All while Potter sleeps next door.
“I’ve had to heal him all over. It was quite brutal what was done to him,” says Potter, a hint of concern hidden deep in his voice. “His muscles were—”
. Merlin, he can’t say that. It sounds pathetic. Besides, it’s not like it’s going to stop him, is it?
* * *
“Yes.” Draco steps back, panting for air. “Yes, please. Fuck me here, fuck me against the wall, fuck me hard…”
“Dear God… do you have to be so harsh on me, every single time?” Potter pauses, one of his hands rubbing over his face, one of his tics when he’s nervous. It makes Draco’s chest hurt oddly. For a moment there, he rather wishes he didn’t know that much, that he’d been looking elsewhere for the few months they actually dated. Even the mere question asked makes his mind scream
"But . . ." Draco pressed his hand against the wall. It was still there. It wasn't going anywhere. It was tall enough that he couldn't even reach the end of it. "This cannot be happening," he mumbled, the beginnings of panic making his voice rise. "Where the hell is Pomfrey? Does she know what this is? Has she—has she told you?"
Draco sighs, putting down his wand and burying his head in his hands. "Not now, Pans," he mumbles. "Seriously, not now."
"Come on, get up. We're going to the hospital."
If only there were a spell to turn into a ghost.
“Okay. Okay, let’s.” Draco lets himself be pushed back, both their bodies molding into each other, as they always do. He can feel Potter’s already hard between his legs. He himself is quite hard too, and he’s quite aware Potter knows it. “Fuck me,” he says.
. He’s all those things at the same time, and for a moment there, he sort of feels like giggling inside because how on Earth is any of that fine? He’s not fine. They, together, are not even remotely
Draco rolls his eyes. "Well, why haven't you?"
“So just try to act like you are?” Draco completes for her, since he’s feeling quite witty. Subtext: ‘Relax, lass. I can do that’.
him afterwards. There was a war going on…”
Straightening his shoulders, Draco snaps out of his thoughts. His break has been over for two minutes. He goes back to the kitchen, rather sure Naomi in there has a few orders ready for him to serve.
After a controlled intake of breath, Draco swallows, and lets himself fall to his knees.
, which is kind of priceless because he really, really isn’t. His first time was two years ago, and he doesn’t even like to think about how it went, so go figure…
“A prejudiced prat.”
And his happiness in that moment would be downright
"I see," his mother says moments later. "Perhaps you ought to come visit," she adds softly, "the town looks lovely this time of year."
It was only after he'd pushed the door open to go back to their room that he realised Harry hadn't been standing just outside. Harry was still sleeping, tucked into bed. The bond would never have allowed that—they had about ten feet, that was as far as they could ever walk from each other. Ten feet.
"Right." Draco twirled his tie around his finger. "Still, you must have been to this cinema place in the past, right? I mean, didn't you grow up around Muggles?"
“We…” Potter pauses, thinking for a moment, as if he’s not too sure he should be talking to Draco about… whatever it is he’s going to say. “We had a bit of a fight, Ginny and me.”
.” He slips his hand down, slowly enough that Potter can easily stop him if he wants to. But Potter doesn’t. Potter just bites his bottom lip when Draco wraps his hand around him. “And I’d like to. Please…”
The whole world seems to have slowed magnificently, to the point where Draco is stepping on his own toes out of pure clumsiness.
Pansy is still looking at him with her mouth drawn into a fine line and a concerned look in her eyes. Draco licks his lips because they're suddenly dry, and then he just tries to breathe normally and not panic as he says, "If I tell you, you can't tell anyone about it. I mean that, Pans, silent as the grave, otherwise the—"
"I looked everywhere for you," Potter starts. "I even asked Parkinson, but she wouldn't tell me where you were."
Draco raises one shoulder.
Only, Weasel’s comments range all the way from
. A lot.)
“See, I don’t think she does make you happy, I don’t think she can.” Wrapping his arms around Potter’s waist, Draco says, “I don’t think you are, I don’t even think she’s what you want.” Every syllable, every word, brushing his lips gently against one side of Potter’s throat. “I think you want this. I think…” Potter draws in air, his chest pressing against the skin of Draco’s arms. “I think you want me,” Draco murmurs against his neck. There’s a gasp for answer, and somehow that gives him the courage he’s always lacked. “You want
"Yeah," Pansy says, kissing his cheek, "but we'll talk as soon as I get back, okay?"
“I have to say, I’m quite impressed,” Draco says, once he’s done reading yet another Potter-based article on the
be one. One that he just can’t recall, somehow. So he opens his mouth, and lets lie after lie flow out in a way that’s almost music to his ears. “I have nowhere else to go.”
It's odd. Draco doesn't really miss his job—not yet; there's still too much to see, too much to do. But he's put so much work into it over the years that it's a bit discouraging to realise no one's missing him.
There are gentle hands on his arms, a nervous trail of fingers over his shoulders. It’s a good sign, Draco thinks, and holds Potter’s eyes as long as he can before giving his prick another lick. He tries a bit of suction. Potter chokes a breath above him, his cock finally thickening, again, and that’s good too. That’s fantastic, because at least he’s doing something
Potter looks surprised, uncertain. “I don’t see how that would be my choice. I’m not the one who’s pregnant here.” Draco feels stupid and clueless because
. But then thinks better of it. There's no way he'll ever be rid of Potter if he keeps answering, so he crumples the parchment instead before setting it on fire. He sends the owl away. He spends the rest of his afternoon trying to drink himself silly.
*   *   *
while he arched up, wrapping his legs tightly around Harry's firm hips, Draco realised he would have gladly traded half his gold for this—the feeling of Harry's hips rocking up into him as his arse clenched around Harry's cock. But this . . . it wasn't all he wanted from Harry.
It’s part of what drove them close. But Harry won’t revisit those memories. He won’t go that far back — those are kept in the banned memories section, the recycle bin; he won’t go in there.
The worst part is that he sort of knew it, and this is what he gets for not trusting his flipping hunches.
even word his thoughts
, a Muggle magazine on how to work those pee-cee things they have, keeps reading. He’s quite stoked. He thinks he’s finally found out how those trolls he’s seen on YouTube record their videos. Apparently, and according to what this magazine says, he needs to check if his laptop has a ‘webcam’. He figures this ‘webcam’ thing must be some sort of camera—in truth, he’s a bit stumped: his laptop seems too small to have anything even remotely resembling a camera anywhere on it. Perhaps he should search ‘webcam’ on Google Images, just to know how one of them looks. Perhaps it looks nothing like a magical camera, who knows?
He licks his lips before falling to his knees and then… he waits.
"You're a horrid flatmate. I hope you know that."
“You don’t love me,” he tells Potter the next day. “You just want a family,” and he’s perfectly aware he’s repeating Weaselette’s words here. He’s still not sure they weren’t true. “Well, news flash for you: Scorpius is my child. He’s
, because he can’t believe he’s said that when he really shouldn’t have. He listens to the cars outside, the slug ringing of the tin bell Kreacher has downstairs, Potter’s slow breathing. It seems ages go by, and Potter does nothing.
He waits for Harry to push him off. To tell him he doesn't want this. To call him a freak, a poof, a
It's only when he goes back home on Thursday night and Potter is there waiting for him that he manages to forget for a while—when he feels Potter's breath on the back of his neck as he slips inside, he gets to pretend everything is fine; as Potter fucks him over the kitchen table, he gets to pretend he's not completely, miserably alone, fooling himself into staying in a relationship that's not actually real, with a person who couldn't care less about him unless he's naked and spread out on his back.
“No need, I’ll go.” Draco nods, but then he remembers, “Did he give you his name? What am I supposed to call him?”
"What is that supposed to mean?"
’s a surprise, this is still England after all. Besides, they did mention it on the weather forecast this morning.
George. It couldn’t be. It just couldn’t be. Because if it was, well, if it was life didn’t look too great for Harry, did it? Or, for that matter, for anyone else.
“You don’t get it, do you?” He pushes at Potter’s chest, hard enough that Potter stumbles backwards a few steps. “You don’t trust me now. You have never trusted me. You didn’t even trust me back on sixth year, when you had me fucking Obliviated.”
"I don't get it." Pansy frowns, flipping through that morning's
Harry snorted. “Well, why not? At least he’s alive, unlike you.”
"Do not tell him I asked!" Draco yells, but it seems like he's too late as well. By the time he says that, Pansy has already left.
“Look, I’m not asking for him. God knows I already have, and what you said… well, it’s not like I can argue with that, can I?”
“Excuse me?”
. That’s exactly where his mind goes. To blood rushing through his chest and thinking,
Where the baby is. Potter’s head lies where the baby is.
Except.
He reaches down, fumbling with the button on Harry's jeans. It's such a tiny thing, it slips between his fingers twice; takes forever to unhook without seeing, but Draco doesn't mind as long as Harry keeps doing that thing—that marvellous thing—with his tongue. He dips his fingers past the waistband of Harry's pants, and Harry gasps out, "Fuck," when Draco's hand wraps around his cock.
“The Ministry… you were there when they read my sentence. They took all my parents’ properties. It’s not like I have a home I can return to.” He marvels at how easy faking truth happens to be, when it all comes much easier than the lies he has to tell daily. Please sir, fuck me harder, oh yes, I love it when you do that, do it again. It’s a complete mystery how lies jump to his tongue and out, how they won’t stop coming. He doesn’t even know how to
It almost makes him want to laugh. And yet here he stands, bonded to Potter, and Potter can’t even see that: that Draco wouldn’t leave even if it were possible, that he’s trapped here and doesn’t want out because Potter means too much, and he has too little to hold on to…
Not like Draco did.
“Yes.” Yes. Yes, above everything. He wants his tiny, tiny human seeing the light of day. No one can do anything to stop that.
Before she left, however, she gave him the password to Harry’s home. Draco did consider dropping by, going to see him. He did want to. He missed him so much…
Draco raised an eyebrow. He wasn't even going to try to dignify that with a response.
But he tells himself he's fine. And he
Still, some kind of greeting would have been appreciated.
, his mind tells him,
"I know that, I just wish—" Draco drags the fork around on his plate. "I wasn't running away either." Only perhaps he was. "He didn't even believe me when I told him it was his child, did I tell you that? I needed . . ." So many things. He needed to build his own life, for one, but he also—
“I can’t believe you’re talking to him,” Ron said.
“What are you… Malfoy, hold still, for Christ’s sake!”
He was trapped. He was trapped in a room with Potter.
“Bit of a snob, ain’t she?” Fred said. Harry glared because, well, because she was one of his best friends and whatnot. Not that Fred wasn’t, but Hermione came first.
. Draco turns around and leaves, cradling Scorpius against his chest. Potter is lying, he knows that much. That, and he doesn’t want the hurt back.
Draco drops his face into Potter's neck, grinning. He knows this isn't the past. He knows this Potter isn't the same one from eighth year—he's older now and ostensibly wiser, but most importantly, he's also Draco's boyfriend. And Draco, who's lived through a war and an unknown bonding spell that nearly drove him up the walls, is pretty sure he now knows everything there is to know about love.
Harry’s children, used to his frequent outbursts of accidental magic, were mostly unaffected by the scene. Marjorie and Rose, however, screamed and ran over to Dudley, who was looking at Harry with the same expression his family had all those years ago. That same shock and horror, laced with Ginny’s lethal pity. They had left after that, and hadn’t returned since, despite Teddy’s protests that he missed Uncle Dudley. He just couldn’t handle it. There was some wild about Harry buried within his past, and prodding it didn’t seem to do anyone any good—least of all himself.
for Hit-Wizards. What caught his eye in particular was the byline “clean record not required!” It was only sensible, really, considering their employee base was predicated almost entirely on criminal types. Unlike Aurors, who were offered certain protections for actions taken in the line of duty, Hit-Wizards and Witches were left to fend for themselves if caught “bending” the law while on a case. Draco had been in and out of Azkaban no less than nine times on account of this. Still better than frying up chips for muggles.
“Yes. How else would a child have been able to dismantle a bloody door? Besides, I can just… tell.”

“I am… sorry for that.”
him nowadays, for whatever bloody reason.
When it was done, Draco let out a shaky breath. He felt electric, strange, and not quite in control of himself. Maintaining the wards was beginning to take its toll. He withdrew the two-way mirror with trembling hands, and whispered his mother’s name. It flickered and revealed her tired face.
coming from the bloke who accidentally shagged a poltergeist? Or am I remembering that wrong?”
The first time she pointed her wand at his mother, Draco had been unable to keep from interfering; he’d thrown himself bodily between the two and caught the
Well. He wasn’t wrong.
“Oh, okay. Should we come, too?” He gestured to another, equally massive child. This one looked even more vacant than the first.
“Let’s get out of here, else you’ll have to put your werewolf-isms to good use when the Aurors arrive.” Potter pulled Granger into his arms, feet planted in a stance suited to apparition.
“Don’t you dare bring him into this, not after your aunt—”
Harry felt guilt cut through him at that. Often, he was unsure of why their fights began and what they were over. But that only made it worse, as feeling like he was circling around the real point served only to frustrate him. He supposed there were many things that he was oblivious to. Unlike today, however, there were occasions when
“Well,” Draco began, spitting out a mouthful of Montague, “that was horrible.”
They had been to visit Dudley twice since the war. Once as newlyweds, and then again with the children. Teddy, in particular, liked going. Dudley had indeed mellowed quite a bit, and his two girls were spectacularly well-mannered. He’d married a petite, dark-skinned nurse named Sarah, whose kind, if stern nature complemented his more relaxed personality. Harry rather thought they’d get along with Percy and Audrey. He was happy for them.
“Oh, really?” Potter said. He looked rather a mess, hair standing on end and features nearly obscured by red. “I had no idea.”
Lindstrom turned to him. “They’ve both been stabilized, Auror Potter, but the boy is currently sedated. If you must speak with him, I can induce consciousness. However, I assume Mr. Malfoy can answer any questions you will have at this juncture,” she said. Lindstrom seemed loathe to wake Scorpius.
instead. "You're such a cow! I've no idea why I thought you'd—"
He does visit that church his mother mentioned, and a bunch of other ones after that one. His mother was right, as usual: they are gorgeous. Besides, it's not as if there's much else to do. The town is some days full of Muggles; they walk around carrying their small clicking devices, and laugh and talk and shoot flashes of light at things.

“You are useless.” Useless, useless… the word reverberates, as continual agony, all while he wonders,
“You are
Fred rolled his eyes. “As if he’d even know who that is...” he said, and Harry had to shove back a snort as he moved forwards in the queue.
Harry snorted.
Draco finds the whole scene utterly hilarious because
It's not St Mungo's he needs, it's a fucking Mind Healer. An Obliviator to remove every single memory of Potter from his brain—but he's not going to get that, is he?
Like it meant nothing.
were over. Just like that.
He shrugs. “We were just kids.” Four years ago, and it seems ages. They were just kids, playing a game too big for them—with too many enemies and too many deaths involved, all things considered. It’s a shame none of them managed to see it then. “You’re now doing it for a living though.” He’s certainly seeing it now, that perhaps Weasel’s sis is not a crone from hell. He can’t help resenting her a bit—Potter was hers after all, at least by the time he came in and took him.
Quite suddenly, Draco’s minds shifts to Mother, back when he was seven. “Girls are a bit icky,” he’d said, while the swing seesawed forth, then back and forth. “Am I really supposed to like them?”
He really, really wants to punch Potter on the face, punch the stupid prat who’s not even aware of the damage he’s done.
It tastes like burnt toads, with a hint of dust-wrapped worms. As usual.
That's all it takes for Draco to give in.
“Obviously not now.”
"Me too," Draco told him, "me too," but he wasn't too sure he wasn't lying.
He knows that, and he knows some promises are important enough to keep, even if it takes years for it to happen.
anymore. He still remembered lying awake late at night, listening to Potter's voice as he made up stories about the people on that map of his, as he chattered on, explaining some Muggle reference or other—and Draco never got most of them, didn't even care to know what they were, but still he'd listened. He remembered helping Potter with his Potions homework, trying to teach him to play wizard chess well enough to beat Weasley—not that Potter ever had, but it was the thought that counted.
“We’re gonna get more Dittany, we can go through a vial a day if that will help.  And I told Diri to get some mandrake juice too, maybe that will help-”
“Did I take a spell during the Battle?” he asked another day as they sat at the dinner table, Draco conspicuously absent again.
At another time such a finding might have stirred something in him.  This was his house after all, and the teachings and beliefs of Salazar Slytherin had been integral to the beliefs his parents had instilled in him from an earlier age.  But he found he did not care now.  Slytherin, and in fact Hogwarts, seemed very far away.
He shook the last thought out of his head.  If Cepheus had kept his wife for decades, Draco was certain he could do the same with Harry.  He felt Harry’s hand cup his cheek, his fingers wiping away his tears.
They looked at each other across the table.  “Why would you want to do that, darling?” said Narcissa, looking him over with wide grey eyes just like his.
“Like how to turn into any animal? And how to fly?”
“I didn’t-” Draco looked back at Harry, meeting the single green eye.  His voice faltered and he couldn’t pick up what he had started.
He kissed Harry’s hand again, clutching at it. “It’s all going to be alright; things will finally be how they were supposed to be.” Tears continued to stream down, and he couldn’t stop them.  “Are you okay?”
The silence of the room hurt him.  The new serenity that engulfed Malfoy Manor felt undeserved.  He shut his eyes.  He should have died.  There had been no reason for Potter to rescue him, so why had he done it? Why hadn’t he let fate work its course?
This struck him as odd.  He had always believed that people with great power desired acknowledgement for possessing said power.  It seemed most strange to reach such heights of magic, only to die alone in a cave, without leaving even an epitaph  to indicate who you had once been.
Harry coughed blood.  “I am not really back from the dead, Tom,” he smiled, all his teeth stained red.
And still the green eye would move, and still the chest would rise and fall, and Draco knew that the thing in there, the thing that he had resurrected, was still with him, in this room, living his worst nightmare.
Draco tried again to lurch forward, trying to fight against the constraints that held him in place.  But the only bit of his body he was capable of moving at all were his eyes.  One of the Death Eaters shouted crucio, and the memory of the pain was enough to make him want to cry.
“I know what I want to do-”
“Yeah, and I didn’t dream this time.”  He got out of bed, his body heavy and sore.  He felt like he used to after getting really sick as a child – sweaty and gross, with too many human needs to accurately address any. “Are you hungry?”
He summoned the Dittany. They were going through vast amounts of it, which was, for one, very costly, and, for another, dangerous. Dittany was not something people needed large amounts of.  Narcissa had been purchasing it for him under disguises, but if anyone figured out who she really was there was going to be trouble.
They flew up to the roof of the Manor, just as the sky lightened.  They sat together, legs hanging down, the invisibility cloak snuggly around them.  It was the most beautiful morning of Draco’s life.  The sky was pink and gold, with perfectly formed clouds and a warmth that penetrated through the January gloom.  Harry had his head on Draco’s shoulders and their hands were together.  He ran his thumb through his smooth skin, not blackened, not dead.
The man besides her was better preserved.  He was an old man, balding and thin.  Like her, his skin was yellowed and wrinkled, with parts discoloured or rotten through, particularly around the jaw, where Draco could see the white of his bone.  His clothes hung loose on whatever shriveled limbs remained.  One of his hands was on the woman’s cheek.  The skin had rotted upon contact, binding them in a most grotesque fashion.  His other hand was pressed to his own chest where two objects lay.  One was a wand, the other a book.
How had he been so stupid? So naïve? And what was there left to do about it now?
Harry moved even closer to him, but again there was no reply.
Copious amounts of white light spilled out from his wand, and unlike most spells it was not a flash, it persisted, illuminating the world around him.  He could suddenly see the details of the things that lay inside the tub, and of the trees on every side of the clearing.  He could also see the canvas of the tent behind him, and the glint of the knife in the grass.  The light was touching everything, wrapping itself around things like smoke, but it was also concentrating, growing deeper in itself.
“Your answer, Draco. You shouldn’t keep people waiting, it’s very rude.”
The day he was to leave they had a last breakfast together under a powder blue sky. In order to give them a greater peace of mind Draco ate more than he cared to.  When it was his time to leave, they walked with him all the way to the gates.
For their role, and specifically for Narcissa’s part during the Battle, all three of them had returned to Voldemort’s favor.  His father had been granted an important position in the reformed 1st Ministry.  His mother and Aunt Bellatrix held highly coveted spots in the Dark Lord’s Council.  He, on the other hand, had been left mostly on his own.  His parents had requested that he be allowed to rest – they said that he had not recovered his strength, that he was sickly, that he had been injured during the battle.
Before he could try to reply, Voldemort raised his wand.  Draco didn’t have any time to gather himself.  A second later he was in the worst pain of his life. Everything he had met with previously was nothing. Sectum Sempra was nothing.  Slicing his fingers off was nothing.  This was pain with a sharpness that he did not know. It cleared his head.  It made thought impossible.  The only thing he knew was his body burned.  That the sensation was hot, sharp, and covering every inch of his skin, as if he had simultaneously been stabbed by a thousand knives. He writhed in pain.
, exactly. Can’t put together a real reason, but he’s quite sure there
“I’m so sane,” Harry told the mirror, because somehow Ginny had now become a ghost too. Apparently. At least according to Hermione, she’d fallen off her broom during a Quidditch match.
Freezing.
“Exclusive news,” she yells for all the whole neighbourhood to hear and beyond, “Draco Malfoy stares longingly at Potter’s face all through his brunch!”
Draco never points out the faults in his reasoning. He tends to avoid introspection these days, mostly because he feels like a worthless whore, used up by everyone and…
The true problem is that Draco never planned to sleep with Potter.
"And since I can perfectly remember finding out last year you'd been madly in love with Potter back at Hogwarts—which, by the way, you hid much, much better than this—I figured you must be hanging out with him."
Potter doesn’t need to see him down on the dust, just as he doesn’t need to know how messed up Draco’s life is right now. So, no. The plan can jump out the window for all he cares, for he’s not going to stick to it. He’ll go as an escort, a random escort picked out of the gigantic pile of potions they keep in the entry cupboard—remodeled by he himself; not that he’s taking credit for it, but he did manage to make the inside rather huge. He figures he’ll pick one out of the largest assortment in there and hope for the best, because the longer he can keep Potter using Polyjuice, the better. That is, if Polyjuice even works.
“It’s not like you
them all. The acrid smell of smoke and burnt parchment fills the room, clinging to Draco's clothes as if it were a solid eroding presence, making his eyes itch as he dips his quill into the ink bottle.
Draco is stepping on his own t-shirt, fumbling with the waist of Potter’s pyjama trousers that won’t come
He hopes Miller isn’t waiting for a show here, because giving him one is not even remotely among his plans.
He's lying against Potter's chest, lulled halfway to sleep by the steady thrum of Potter's heartbeat and the gentle caress of Potter's fingers on his hair, when Potter says, "It's funny how things have turned out, don't you think?"
In real life, Harry brings the she Weasel with him.
Draco licks his cock in a long tease. Potter’s thighs shiver, spread out easy. It’s perfect, it’s absolutely perfect, because Draco’s world is now flawless, and finally moving
It’s just a shame his partner was also someone who walked out on him twice, and then stood outside for half a year all while the papers published tons of fake articles, most of them over Draco’s interference in his life, all of them leaving Draco not in a very good place. Someone who had him Obliviated and then had himself Obliviated, too, for good measure, and also someone who came back for his son almost two months after he was born.
In the end Potter turns out to be right—yet again, about Weasel. When the second week drops by, he’s behaving more like a person and less like a rabid dog. Or a rabid weasel, in this particular case. Mostly. With the occasional exception of his, “Merlin saggy balls, Harry, you had literally the whole world to choose from, the
He doesn’t have to. Pansy’s free tomorrow. He could leave Scorpius with her. She keeps complaining he’s a pest, but Draco knows (his tiny little monster is the most precious human-shaped living being on Earth) it’s said lovingly (and she is indeed the one largely massive pest standing in that whole house).
"Not a chance. Go now, buy your new best friend a drink."
But Potter just laughs. He laughs, propping his head up on his elbows and says, "We don't actually live together."
He clenches his fists and determinedly pushes it back down. But Salazar, he hates himself more than ever.
He’s more quiet today than he usually is, lying back on Harry’s chaise longue like it’s his. Then again, if Harry let himself recall, he’d know it is; if he could remember the day they decided to move in together, how he stood by watching Draco pick furniture to take with him from his half-empty manor house…
Draco wonders how that didn't clue him in to what was about to happen. It wasn't even the first time Potter tore Draco's world to pieces and left him without a leg to stand on—oh no, not even close. Potter seemed to have made a fine art of it, perfected it to the point where he could likely do it in his sleep. He was that good—but it was that evening when it hurt the most.
He’s so done. Potter will kick him out, won’t he? He’ll have to go back to his life before and that won’t be good, it wouldn’t have been good before, but now he has a tiny tiny human growing inside him and he’s not supposed to take Polyjuice, at least that’s what mediwizards said. And what if… what if Miller number two is waiting around the corner?
It doesn't last, anyway. As soon as the she Weasel starts talking again, Harry turns away.
They didn't know what it had been like, having the Dark Lord stationed in his family's home. They had never had to watch in despair as their parents were ordered around like servants, and while they might have occasionally gone to bed with the deep fear that they'd be murdered before they woke, there was no way for them to know that it'd been the exact same for Draco—every single night, he'd feared for his life. But they couldn't know that.
And sometimes Draco would change sides in those dreams.
shame. Reading his own feelings has never been one of his strengths.
, and it hurts, it hurts so much. It hurts because Draco did have to work hard to land this job, and because it's true that Potter could have him fired. But most importantly, it hurts because Draco still remembers the warmth of Potter's ankle next to his back in eighth year, and he remembers how badly he'd wanted Potter to feel the same way. He remembers with remarkable vividness how he spread his legs for Potter back then, how he sank down on his cock, nervous like the virgin he wasn't. And he remembers how Potter never actually returned his feelings.
“Freaking
Potter will do, when he comes back. Draco hopes, wishes he won’t suggest an abortion. He thinks of poisoning, crushing, burning the little human growing in his belly and he really, really doesn’t want that. Not at all. Not for his son. He wants his tiny human born and growing, forever a reminder of these few months he felt content and relaxed, these few months when his life seemed for once worth living. No, if Potter even
Draco's legs feel weak. He feels hypnotised, as though he can't run away fast enough from these images Potter's conjuring, as though he wants them more than anything. But he still manages, "I imagine we could come to an agreement."
. Well, on second thought, occasionally, and certainly not always.
Shockingly enough, life has been going pretty well for Draco since he left his position at St Mungo's. He's been working at Slug & Jiggers Apothecary for almost two months now, and he's quite happy with the job he's been doing. His boss seems fairly unbiased when it comes to the part Draco played in the war, even going as far as stepping in for him when any of his clients give him a hard time.
Mother just smiles cryptically at him. "Perhaps you should ask the locals."
He pushes the blanket off with tired arms, without really knowing why: for some calm, for more air, for some reason that quite eludes him. It’s not like any of that matters, since at least the tears are in, not out, since at least Potter knows nothing, and it really should stay that way. Though he’ll find out eventually. Best case scenario, Potter will freak out, and then Draco can say farewell to this life, farewell to the giant pillock he’s fallen for. He can’t remember when nor how but, news flash, love lives in him, and it doesn’t look like it will be leaving anytime soon.
Potter shrugs in reply to his question. “She knows some days I have to work late.”
But Pansy is also Draco's friend. One of the few people who has never betrayed him, not even when her own life was at stake.
It's such a daft question Draco just wants to say,
to be tied up. He knows what some of his customers would do to him if they could, if they knew who he is, and after another swallow, he manages to mumble, “Yes, I do take it up the arse.” He keeps the

’s gossip column, “—Whore of Whores. For quite a while, too.”
"Isn't that a church?"
that left him remembering nothing at all, not even the chat he had with Pansy a little while before that happened. Not to mention the constant headache he kept getting, whenever he tried to think about anything even vaguely related to it. “To make you forget. I thought… I don’t know what I thought back then, he said it was the best choice and I believed him. But when I saw him with you, the way he looked at you… He’s never looked at Ginny like that.”
Draco lies against the wall as Potter kisses his way down his back, finally settling onto his arse. “What are you…” Potter’s hands pull apart his buttocks. “Salazar. You’re not going to…” He’s soon proved wrong by Potter’s tongue, as it gives a long lick along the crevice down there. “Merlin… you are. That feels…”
, and Potter laughed at him, and…
. Both to those who won the war and to those who didn’t, as neither of them seem too happy with the path Draco walked.
His feet must have carried him back to the common room at some point. He knows this because Pansy was still there, thrilled and expectant with her 'Well?' and her questions, and Draco is not exactly sure what his answers were. All he knows is they made her roll her eyes.
Pansy Side-Alongs him to St Mungo's as soon as he's finished his tea, and he sits through test after test feeling like a rookie seer in the Department of Mysteries. The mediwizards tell him to stand still and he does, and when they tell him to hold up his shirt and lie back, he does that as well.
"You know what? Fine!" Potter's breathing is coming faster now, and Draco can feel the heat of Potter's magic on his skin. But he can't remember why it once made him feel safe. "Fine, I'll go. You won't even have to worry about me coming back, it's not as if I'd
Harry is gone for a full fortnight.
“Oh, he has.” Draco chuckles. More than, even. Potter healed him, brought him here—but then again, Pans is excessively proud of herself when it comes to seeing through other people, and Draco’s not too keen on feeding cats that, to his view, are already quite chubby, so he swallows that, brings up something else, and remembers to ask for his laptop. They end up talking and talking for ages, until she has to leave to one of her dates.
The only good thing that came from Draco’s time at Hogwarts was, possibly, Pansy. He couldn’t say she admired him because, frankly, she never did seem to give a damn one way or the other. But at least she was his friend. Even after uselessly crushing on him for all those years. He’s quite sure he broke her heart when he came out, that night when he got drunk and… well, that’s a tale for another time. Especially since it’s such a blur in his mind. He’s not even sure what he told her—though it was likely a crass spiel on his preference for prick over pussy. See, that would certainly explain her
"Yeah. But, er, perhaps you'll like this one better?" Potter gives him a hesitant smile. It's a bit off-putting, Draco thinks, to realise the lower half of his face is trying to mirror the expression. He should be cross at Potter. He
He feels as if his wings might melt to ashes this close to the sun, so he sneers at Harry.
on it later," Potter says, hovering just above his nipples. "Honestly," he adds, before sinking his teeth into Draco's skin.
"I told him—" Potter hesitates. "I told him I could have him fired if I wanted to—I told him . . . and then he went and handed in his resignation, how is that not my fault?"
Draco wouldn't have lurched awake in the middle of the Hospital Wing, with a mouth that tasted as if he'd swallowed a bucket of Thestral piss and a banging headache right between the eyes. As though he'd taken a particularly ill-tempered Bludger to the head.
Draco has only once felt somewhat close to this before—filled with lust and want and need, but also justified, as if everything in his life had been leading up to this one moment, to him squirming under Potter, giving in to him a second time, unable to think about anything but how much he wants this to go on.
“So that’s how it is in Muggle's programming. Basically, you spell something, anything, wrong,” Hermione was saying on the way back to the Ministry, “and the whole thing stops working until you find
Pansy's lips tighten and her nostrils flare, but all she says is, "Oh, Draco," and then, "I still think you shouldn't have to go through this alone."
“Consider what?”
she'd know that. He's the careless idiot who got drunk and told her Potter's abs looked like something out of a magazine in the Cannon's new calendar last year—so tight, so bloody
"Well, tough luck," she says at last. "Now up with you."
“Earth to Draco,” Potter says, quite loudly, sitting on the nearest stool.
He should Floo Pansy, let her know where he is, and that he’s whole and well and his spine is not missing. Let her know he’s still alive. She must be worried sick, he’s been missing for several days now. Besides, she might even be pleased that he’s at Potter’s. Just a few more minutes, he thinks, because he’s tired, because it’s calm and quiet and safe, and because Potter isn’t here. And because he can. Perhaps Pans was right, after all. Potter offered his place, he brought him here without waking him up. He let him sleep. Potter even thought to throw a blanket over him.
If only Draco moved his foot a tiny bit to the right—just a tiny bit—their ankles would be touching. He wondered if Potter's skin would be as warm as Draco imagined it. Everything about Potter was so hot, so lively, so full of energy, it just felt as though his skin should be as well. But then, what did he know?
Draco is still regretting he lacked the courage to shut the door on his face.
It doesn't last forever.
Draco scoffs, but apparently Pansy isn't anywhere near finished.
"You know, perhaps you ought to talk to Harry, he had to drink it several times during our—"
"Hello, Draco."
And it's all Potter's fault.
Afterwards, Potter gets dressed. He’s quiet, so quiet all through it. Draco watches his chest, sees the slow tense breath in. Then, he watches Potter’s face, that mouth, frowning. It really doesn’t look good. It doesn’t look good at all.
Potter doesn’t answer. He remains quiet.
He pictures them walking hand in hand through the Petit Trianon, toasting with champagne at midnight in front of the Eiffel tower's silhouette, and suddenly, none of this seems funny anymore. Suddenly, the pitying look Pansy is giving him makes all the sense in the world, and Draco grits his teeth and swallows against the persistent taste of jealousy trying to claw its way up his throat. Sharing has never been one of his strong points, has it? And right now, he hates that more than anything.
He ends up spending most of his weekend at Pansy's. When he finally goes back home late on Sunday evening, Potter is, unsurprisingly, no longer there. He's gone, vanished from Draco's life without so much as a note, and Draco's stomach plummets whenever he thinks about it.
It’s seven in the morning and Draco feels thwarted and ruined, like he’s been stumbling around without sleep for weeks, worrying over things that can’t be solved. It almost makes him laugh because… well, because he
!” Harry sulked. “They won’t let me sleep, okay? They just keep talking and talking and I tried to
"Merlin, you're no fun at all when you're like this!"
"What made you think I was?" Draco asks quietly.
Pansy shrugs. "I doubt it'd be that bad."
Draco turns to stare at him. Potter hasn't moved. He's so still he looks like a breathing statue—only his skin is warm and soft, and in no way reminiscent of stone.
Pansy's fingers comb soothingly through his hair—front to back, front to back. They're probably making a right mess of it, but right now, Draco couldn't care less. Right now, he needs her there to lean against. He needs her there to make sure he doesn't choke on the ball of sorrow that keeps trying to close up his throat.
Draco's fingers tighten around the flask he'd been holding. It's been months since Potter last called him by his first name, but Draco could recognise that voice with his eyes closed. He turns around, letting his professional salesman mask slide over his face.
Pansy, lovable twat that she is, chose that moment to enter the room, whilst Draco was in the midst of brooding over is woeful existence. She’s hit the showers already, her dark hair dried with hot air charms falls well-combed around her face. She makes a beeline for the coffee cup Draco left waiting for her on the desk. It’s takes effort not to roll his eyes at Pansy—she isn’t the only creature of habit in their shabby little apartment. Coffee is to Pansy, as the morning news is to Draco: an essential part of their routine. It should still be warm; Draco actually remembered to place a warming charm on it this time around. Her hand slides over his back on her way there. “Slept well?”
He's so cross, so confused, so incongruously turned on, and the next thing he knows, he's kissing Harry. It's harsh and angry and demanding, and not even close to how it was in his dreams, but still sublime, Draco thinks. Sublime.
Hilarious, Draco thinks, that he’s offering this now. As if he
“Well,” Harry whispers against his cheek, and then, in his terrible, terrible,
“There were—” Potter pauses “—signs,” and his voice sounds quite odd, quite unfitting. Like he’s actually
Damn you, Pans.
“Understandable, since you don’t smoke.”
Draco talks to Pansy, sometimes. Mostly through the Floo, though she has come over twice. He has to be careful though, doesn’t want Potter to see her here, or else. He’s stopped having those horrible flashbacks. He is finally off those potions, and his insomnia no longer forces him to call on sleep nightly with a glass of Firewhisky. Instead, he gets to sulk and laugh, and be extremely Ab Fab—like the Muggle show—by listening to Muggle classics from the ’80s.
Pans, you lying twat.
Miller gestures towards the couch. However, when Draco takes a couple of steps, he says, “No. Not walking.”
They're both quiet for a while, surrounded only by the sound of forks and knives occasionally clicking against plates. Draco has no idea what his mother is thinking, though she's obviously deep in thought. He's not entirely sure he wants to know either.
jealous.”
"They'll fix this though, won't they?" He lay back, staring up at the white ceiling. "Of course they'll fix this. They have to, they have to find a way to—they can't possibly leave us like this."
“But you’re fine. You’re here, you’re alive.”
Later that day, he finds out who Lily is. He also happens to find out that Harry can say goodbye to his Crup, named after his mother, for it’s never coming back.
Because he wants to. Because he wants Harry to want it too. Because he wants Harry to want to spend more time with him.
"—and I'm sorry."
Potter's baby. Draco wonders if it'll have Potter's eyes, and hopes to Merlin it won't have Potter's impossible mess of dark hair—thick and wavy and quite possibly spell-resistant. Only then he starts wondering if he'll be reminded of Potter whenever he looks its way, and suddenly his eyes feel watery, and the thick clump at his throat seems far too big to swallow. So he decides to forego further speculation for the time being. He can do that later, if at all.
"Right."
doing something illegal, I'm rather offended not to have been invited."
“Let me do this,” Draco says. “I want to.” Oddly enough, he’s not lying this time. He wouldn’t now, he thinks he’s past lying; lying’s left behind last month, when he actually began caring. And he knows what Potter’s thinking and why his eyes look dark and anxious. But this is different. He’s not his wife, but he knows Potter wants him. He gives Potter a little stroke. His hips jerk before he makes himself still.
“Oh, Potter…” Draco’s lips turn into a sneer. Inside him, there’s a distraught chuckle ringing constantly against the edges of his being. “You are so, so naïve. It’s not like he needs
It almost makes Harry want to snort a laugh, only there’s nothing laughable about this.
Is that Draco’s sweat? Is he sweating?
He recalls curling into a shivering bundle as he tried to shut the world out.
Some mornings, when Draco first wakes up, it takes him a moment or two to remember where he is. To remember his war days are over, that the present is something else that sometimes doesn’t hurt as much, though mostly it does. That there’s something missing, but he doesn’t know
By sixth year, the dreams became different—they increased in intensity to match the growing fear and desperation in Draco's life. They'd meet in darkened classrooms then, in hidden alcoves, and Harry would place a gentle hand on Draco's lower back as he whispered, "You can change sides, you know," in his ear. Draco's muscles would tighten almost painfully under his skin, and he'd flush a little when Harry leant in closer to catch his eyes.
if they are, but Merlin, he wants to. He wants to curse Potter. He wants to break his stupid nose again, but somehow, he manages to calm down just enough to say, "You can't actually know that, Potter. You don't know me anymore."
caught him. He’s about to go back to his dates, leave this Pans-prompted dream-like existence as unfinished business, go back to normal life—or at least to what normal is in his life and whatnot. His stomach will certainly thank him, he knows that much: he can’t remember swallowing this much poison in such a short period of time
them but it didn’t work...”
makes him angry or anything; it’s nice, it feels great to be valued for something, though he’d much prefer if it were for anything else, and not his looks. He mostly thinks it would have been nicer if it had happened sooner—before the whole prostitute bit in his life, even before the bond took place.
"I might have talked to you, if you weren't so busy being a massive twat half the time."
Draco heard himself say, "Sure," in a voice that wasn't even his own—a voice that sounded far too weak to be his own—and that was that.
After a long, long shower, he clears enough condensation off the mirror to be able to see his face—at least a tiny bit of it, he’s not quite sure he wants to see it in full detail. He’s aware he’s getting thinner. He’s perfectly aware the amount of Firewhisky he’s consuming these days only exacerbates the dark shadows under his eyes. He’s aware that it really needs to drop, but he’s also aware that that’s certainly not going to happen anytime soon. That it’s not likely to drop ever, and Merlin knows that if it does, he’ll start contemplating nooses as a chance-slash-possible way out, because, no. Plus, he’s sworn to Pansy no more Sleeping Draughts, not after last time…
“But we
Pansy picks up his calls, as usual—because she’s good at sounding normal, she’s great at it. Because she doesn’t have the mark. She might be hated, but no one wants her dead. And isn’t that fab? Because she might have messed up a bit, but not all the way.
Draco never talks about their kiss in the lab. He never talks about the scent of disinfectant potions Potter carries in his clothes, or about how Draco's head swam with lust as he felt Potter's lips move against his.
. Potter, who’s heating up some baby milk for Scorpius, glances at him for a second. “Impressed by what?”
He pulls Potter closer, makes the kiss deeper. He can feel the hard shape of Potter's cock where it's pressed against his thigh, and Draco pushes his palm against it and swallows Potter's moan when it comes—Potter's cock is thick and hot against his hand, so hot even through layers of clothing.
"Draco?"
"Why didn't you go to the press after the other night?"
—sliding into him.
Draco stops abruptly when he reaches the backdoor. "You wanted an answer," he says without looking at Potter. "I don't know. That's my answer. I don't know if I should go back with you, it didn't exactly work out for me the last time I agreed to one of your ideas, did it?"
*   *   *
“Please.” Pansy scoffs, breaking her gaze to roll her eyes at Draco.
"Why are there so many towers?" Draco asks.
Draco raises his eyebrows, because right, sure, he can do that, and it’s not as if he’s contemplating that all of this is going too fast. Perhaps he’d be, he reckons, if he were really new at this, but he isn’t. Then he guesses he can add a fourth point to his list because, clearly, this bloke here seems to love commanding people around. Unfortunately, Draco happens to be not too fond of them commanding blokes, and by now he’s kind of wishing Pansy has tripled his bill, no matter how unlikely it seems to be. Still, he steps out of his shoes and takes his jacket off.
"And now I don't."
And Draco nods back at him. "Potter."
Draco doubts it. Without him, Harry would have found another way, and he doubts Harry really believes a word he's saying. It's probably the life debt speaking, but still, Draco's throat feels thick, as if he were about to cry, and he can't help falling a little in love with every new word because no one,
"I never slept with anyone else," he tells Pansy, "not since that first night." When he panicked and fled to her home. When this whole mad thing was set into motion.
“Pass
Draco turns his head towards her. "Potter is a complete bastard and I hate his guts to the moon and back," he says swiftly, then takes a large swig of the firewhisky he's been nursing for the past half-hour, and holds his glass out for a refill.
. None of this is Draco’s fault.
again.
He slides his foot a tiny bit to the right, just until it’s barely brushing against Potter’s ankle. Nothing but a light caress.
When she Floos later that evening to tell Draco she'll be missing dinner, Draco simply rolls his eyes. "Abandoning me yet again to go for a drink with your new Healer friends, are you?"
. It just loops over itself repeating the same mistake again and again until you fix it within the code. And that’s what happens here, too, only instead of spelling things wrong, you just need to mispronounce a single...”
"So it was him," Draco's mother says one day, and Draco grins down into his teacup.
Instead of friends, Draco ended up with two sidekicks that were more like chavish minions than they were confidants—one of them actually got the nerve to betray him, the… supreme
He smiles back, tries for reassuring. He’s not feeling it yet—reassured, himself, but he’ll get there soon enough. Because he’s not going to break. Potter, however…
Merlin, it seems possible.
"I figured I would eventually." Draco shrugs. "Most likely after the baby is born. I don't actually speak good enough Italian to find a decent job here."
Muggle’s. Programming.
, it reads.
Harry stared at his clock, basically convinced that he was living someday in whatever the month, in some bollocked year he didn’t even know when, over and over. While people died. And showed up on his living room. And the bananas in his fruit platter were somehow putrid bits of decomposed rubbish-like detritus that should have been in the wastebasket since at least three weeks ago.
Tension seizes him for a split second, his shoulders going ramrod straight before going limp in his chair in defeat. The best defence he can manage is muttering a rather terse, “I didn’t exactly get to pick my side of the fence.”
He never expected Potter to turn away from him. He never expected to have to follow him up the stairs, to have to call out "Harry, wait!" just to get Potter to stop and look at him. And he certainly never expected to regret it. He never expected the unyielding ice in Potter's gaze—flat, colder than Father's cell in Azkaban. Good grief, Potter's eyes would have made the Dark Lord's glare seem cheerful.
The point here is, these days he doesn’t even
Draco sees red.
When he looked back up, he could see Potter's mouth moving. Draco had been so lost in his thoughts he hadn't even heard him speak, but Potter was still there, looking oddly amused in a way that could mean nothing good.
"Thank Merlin you're fine," he'd say. "You've been in a magical coma for days."
about paying attention. They've been working together for two years, and Harry has never once talked to Draco and how,
"No thanks," Draco mutters, but his heart feels tight, straining against its walls like it's trying to climb out of his chest. And it's not the house that's to blame for that—it's Potter. The way he's sitting right next to Draco, with his face softened by the low light.
Draco nodded.
He only stops wondering because it hurts too much.
"Are you sure? I mean, I'd rather not hurt you . . ."
“Power, likely,” Potter snorts, “what with you being you…”
not to go babbling about you if I got caught by them…”
A flash of light and a small cry is all the warning he gets before Harry races forwards, before spells start flying all around them and Draco is forced to leave cover or leave Harry on his own—and he can't do that, he could never do that.
“I think you were right about him,” he says. “I think he’s—” a faint laugh on a breath, “—you know,
Draco buys treacle tart before going home, just as he does every Friday. He puts a stasis charm on it and leaves it on his coffee table, then pours himself a glass of wine and sits on his couch to wait. At exactly ten minutes to eight, Harry stumbles through his Floo.
"You didn't just fuck him, Draco," she tells him slowly, as if she were disclosing one of the great truths of the universe, "you actually went and fell in love with him."
, Draco thinks,
“Miller it is, then.” And he fakes a smile for her. “Which potion?”
"I just couldn't stand it anymore," Draco says, and he's embarrassed by how desperate his voice sounds. "I couldn't stand
“Quite,” Draco lies smoothly. He’s never sure if Pansy buys it or not, what with her poker face, but takes it as a good sign when she moves on to change the subject.
Draco can't remember ever being this hard, not even that day back at Hogwarts, when they'd fucked on Draco's bed. He's desperate. He's writhing beneath Potter, breathing hard as Potter adds a second finger, slowly moving them back and forth.
Draco isn't even sure he wants to anymore. He used to miss Potter so much, but he never missed him the way he is now, all anger and resentment and pretending Draco doesn't exist. He misses the version of him he got to know back then, the one whose laughs were contagious and whose smiles weren't all tight around the edges. The one he'd call Harry. But there's none of that in today's Potter—nothing for Draco to miss.
"I haven't given it much thought," he said. What
“Merlin. You knew, didn’t you? The Wham song,” Draco says, covering his cheeks as heat flushes his face. “Yes, of course you knew. Bloody liar, you… you…”
. He tries to say, ‘Hey, gorgeous’. Tries to say, ‘Can I just say, I love your eyes’, tries to say any of all those silly sentences he’s been practicing at home, because he
Draco swallows. His mind feels muzzy and slow but he says, "No, sir, of course not," just like he's supposed to—like a professional; like the bloody consummate liar that he is, even though he's so far from all right it's almost frightening.
thoughts won’t keep him awake at night. Merlin knows it’s not the Firewhisky keeping his insomnia alive and kicking. No, the Firewhisky might actually be the only thing helping these days, lulling him softly to sleep when all else fails. It was all he could do to smuggle the case he had from Father’s cellar, before Aurors came to kick him out of his ancestral home. And he’s sure the absurd amounts of Polyjuice he’s been drinking isn’t to blame either. Merlin knows the mere thought of the vile concoction is enough to make him sick up; but, if the years under Snape’s tutelage taught Draco anything, it was that Polyjuice has no effect on one’s sleep patterns.
Draco’s head snaps up. “I can’t be,” he whispers. His muscles tense up so fast he has to let go of the magazine he’s holding. He shoves his hands under his armpits, to hide the shaking in them because, “I can’t be, I’d have to be bonded for that to—”
Hermione, the poor lass, stayed behind him, still trying to explain to Ron whatever it was they had her doing these days was. “Some curses work a bit like a cycle,” she said, “like, think of time, for instance. Time is a cycle.”
Hours later, once Potter's nose has been fixed and all the blood has been spelled clean, once Potter is finally done getting praised—over his
He leaves soon after. He goes back to his place—to his life—and Draco is left alone in the dark with his demons and his doubts, and every nerve in him flares with annoyance, and something else he can't quite name.
"You walked away first!" Potter snaps, throwing his hands up. "You broke things off first and you won't even explain why you did that. You're such a self-absorbed twat, I don't even know how to—"
“Not at all.” A wink. “But I’d do it for you.”
Draco concentrates on breathing, swallows a couple of times, and by then Potter is taking a step back.
Still, he feels endlessly thankful when Pansy walks in, and all in all, quite proud of himself for not having throttled Potter when he had the chance.
At least he knows he’s kept his side of the promise he made himself, months ago. He’s kept his distance from Potter, even if Potter is standing here right now, pushing his head back to stop the bleeding. Draco kept true to his word. It’s rather the world around him who can’t keep true to its own. But then again, it’s never been a mutual promise. And the world, it seems, has its own plans, regardless of how Draco feels about them.
“I... what?”
He himself reckons Madonna isn’t exactly chaste herself either: he’s searched her pictures on Google Images and, said bluntly, her and virgin are quite hard to visualise on the same sentence. Unless the sentence reads ‘really not’. He heard her for the first time on his laptop, on some random YouTube video. Since then, he’s downloaded all her albums on this program called eMule—the one that has an odd donkey as its logo. He’s quite a huge fan. Wikipedia says that song came out when he was four, which is both comical and amazing: it took him sixteen years to find it, but now he knows he’s finally in love.
"I just fell asleep, Pans." Draco rolls onto his back, stretching his muscles until his back cracks and his shoulders tremble, and he's left feeling a bit light-headed. He's missed breakfast and lunch, and yet he's still so bloody tired. If he could, he thinks he would sleep all day—only now Pansy is here, and he's somehow managed to upset her. "I'm fine."
Draco can’t hold back a smirk. “What, it gets you hot?”
. Snape’s hand pulling on his.
“Uh-huh?” Ron said.
news on Potter? Apparently, he’s planning to adopt a Crup. These
"No—" Draco snorts, "—you think?"
“Over there,” he says, eyes narrowed, and that’s that. It throws him off a bit. He could have sworn her words were
Miller scratches his chin. It looks like he’s been growing that beard for a real long while. Somehow, seeing that forces Draco’s nose to crumple. He’s never liked bearded people too much, they mar his skin with tiny pink tears and he’s suddenly feeling quite glad Pansy thought to charge him extra.
Potter snorts. "Oh, so it's mine now, is it?"
“But why not? What else do I have to do?”
“Not really.” Potter’s thick eyebrows draw together into a massive frown mid-forehead. “Well, perhaps. Maybe.”
Pansy takes the seat beside him, making a show of examining her nails before remarking, “Why not? Merlin knows he’s loaded. More than Zabini, even. And there are feelings there, more than a bit I’d say…”
“I have to take Crookshanks to the vet this afternoon,” Hermione told him, later.
After the trial, Harry doesn't speak to him.
“No. Leave him alive,” the Dark Lord said. “He’s good leverage.”
“It was certainly not a pickle.”
, bloody hell, to Potter of all people. From his child waking him up every two hours, from a long eve spent trying to feed Scorpius who wouldn’t eat, and an endless morning spent at work, serving others plates he can’t even afford on the misery salary he’s paid for his part-time job. Sometimes he catches himself thinking they could have been spent at Potter’s, all those days. He misses sleeping with him. He misses his arms, wrapped around his waist as they both gave in and called it a night. He’s just so wound up by all that, he actually falls for it at first. Potter’s lips are soft and tender against his. Just as wonderful, perhaps even better than he remembers them. His mouth parts a tiny bit. Only, then he recalls this is not supposed to happen. This here is what he’s been avoiding. It needs to stop
"Pans," Draco mumbles, "Pans, I quit."
Draco would put his hand on Harry's thigh and feel Harry's muscles tighten under his skin.
Pansy keeps staring at him for several long seconds, she stares at him until his chest stops rising and falling, until nothing in him is moving at all. “It doesn’t matter.” She gets up. “Just don’t lose this. Try, for Merlin’s sake,
"We were . . ."
. The last time Potter and him were together in a bathroom, he got cursed.
"Yeah." But maybe Harry could. Maybe Draco could follow Harry into training—he'd always been good at potions after all, and they were also used for healing. There might be something there he could do. And in any case, they'd have to take him if he were still tied to Harry, wouldn't they?
“When you got sloshed up on the roof, after the Dark Lord ordered you to fix that cabinet. You tried and tried and nothing worked, and one day you lost it, you stole one bottle of Finnigan’s Firewhisky and dragged me all the way up to—”
“Yes, I think so.”
. Like something in there is missing, deleted, erased, something that used to be and isn’t, and he knows not what or when.
"Excuse me?" Potter halted his pacing to give Draco a look of such disbelief that, bloody hell, Draco really wanted to break his nose again. It had been quite relaxing the first time around, and besides, perhaps it'd make the pounding in his head grow quieter. Admittedly, it seemed far-fetched, but it wasn't as if he'd know unless he tried it. "How is any of this in any way my fault?"
*   *   *
, for some absurd reason.
Sadly, Time-Turners are a thing of the past and he's not going to
And then Harry walks away.
"I never really got to see a film in the cinema. My Muggle relatives, they didn't like the idea of magic. They rarely took me anywhere, and I did—I did watch a few films on the telly, but that's it."
“Yes, Pansy. I’m sure.” Terribly sure, sadly. After the great mess-up today, he doesn’t think he could be any surer than he is.
"Are you feeling any better?" Potter asks.
Anyway, a couple of minutes later, a new waiter — a girl, this time — came back with his Macchiato and apologised profusely and that was that.
Pansy's eyes narrow. "Okay," she says, "I think I could see that much, back then."
“Really?” Draco raises an eyebrow. “Am I supposed to be part of your work, then? Because last time I checked, this was not St. Mungo’s.”
"The fuck is wrong with you, Malfoy?" Harry shouts, jostling him, and Draco winces.
Potter comes back a few days later. “I’ve told my wife,” he says, tiredly.
“Yes, please. Thanks,” said Harry, quite busy rubbing his ribs through his duffle coat.
“And… nothing.” A shrug. “We haven’t really been
"You could come, you know? It's not like it's a private party or anything, besides, Harry will be there as—"
“No, here. Let’s just…”
Draco shrugs. "Maybe. But it's been ages since eighth year, Pans," he says softly.
As in: the past.
Draco walked around, following the length of the wall—it appeared to be circular, it appeared to be built around Potter, and Draco had to fight back sobs, fight back hysterical laughter because Potter, Potter, Potter, why was everything always about him?
"I fucked up," Potter says. He sounds distressed. "I fucked up badly, I was just so angry at him all the time and now—now he's leaving."
,” she whispered. “Ron got so happy when he started dating his sister again, you should have seen him. He kept saying Harry was part of the family and… then they married, and I… I thought that was best for him! I honestly thought not remembering you was best for him.”
, Skeeter! He’s spent most of the evening following Harry around, saying hello to this and that person. Generally acting as his shield, at least whenever reporters come anywhere near them. He’s certainly missed this. Half his childhood was spent in parties like this one, along with his parents, chumming with the big boys at the Ministry. It’s been gone from his life for too long now. He thinks he’s doing quite well so far, so well in fact that Weasley is almost being civil to him. Quite a joke, if you ask Draco…
He takes a second to memorise the soft curve of Potter’s face. The way his bottom lip, full and chewed on—boy, he really loves that look on him, the one he gets whenever he ponders over something, anything—seems absolutely perfect. The way his eyelashes shadow his cheeks whenever he blinks. His eyes, green as spring grass, green as Slytherin, as new leaves on a maple tree, search Draco’s, as if he knew there are questions he’s not uttering.
"Unless you've taken to keeping other people's booze around your house, I reckon it must be."
Potter smiles tightly at him. "You look good."
“Oof… I’m having an awful day,” she replies. “My washing machine started spitting water at me this morning. Just like that, out of nothing!”
Draco rolls his eyes. "It's Potter, Pans. I doubt he's planning to rob my house."
“Yes,” Harry snapped, “I remember. It’s not like I could forget, even if I tried to, thank you.”
Draco doesn't often want to contemplate his thoughts where Potter is concerned, but right now, he'd really like to cast an
Draco turns around, burying himself deeper into his blankets. It's warm there. Cosy. "I'd really rather stay in bed, if it's all the same to you," he mumbles, but Pansy shakes her head and gives him a long, even look.
family, not yours.”
Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm a Gryffindor, Draco. We generally keep our promises."
Potter tends to drop by mid-afternoon, when he leaves his job. The first few times he brings food and some shopping. However, upon Draco’s complaints, he starts bringing the
If he's completely honest with himself, he's still a bit in awe that Potter would trust him to keep his mouth shut; half the Wizarding population wouldn't trust him as far as they could throw him and there are days when Draco himself isn't entirely sure he can be trusted—seeing how he can't seem to keep his past from fucking up his present even more. But apparently Potter does trust him.
But, if Potter would rather believe falsehoods, Draco is certainly not planning to be the one to stop him. Then again, this whole relationship between them is based on a giant lie: Draco is clearly not an escort, and has never been one indeed! As a matter of fact, the only reason why he is still here is because—woe, poor self—his psycho boyfriend allegedly lost his temper, and somehow decided he might as well punch Draco’s face until his nose was pulped and he sagged to the ground, whimpering softly, his hands clenched around his chest.
, he thinks, because this is it, because now’s the time: it’s now or never, jump ahead or be left behind. He exhales slowly, until there’s nothing in his head but this, here, what he’s going to do. He moves closer to Potter, closer still until their bodies touch, front to back.
"Shh," she shushes him, lying next to him on the bed. "It's okay. You'll get over this," she whispers, "you'll move on."
. He thinks he’s lived through enough not to be treated like that anymore.
Hermione blinked. “Harry... er. There was no yesterday. We didn’t meet yesterday.”
Harry lies beside him, unmoving.
He doesn’t even know what he’s asking, what right he’s got, and Miller blinks at him, slowly, like nothing here makes sense, until he sees it…
“Why?”
Rather dire, since he’s already late.
”—Draco also knows nothing ever is going to feel as good as these moments, that no kiss will be as sweet as Harry’s, that no other arms can keep the chilly cold from his soul tucked away as warmly as Harry’s do—“I’m bonded to you.”
"What? Growing tired of fame now that you're the nation's star Seeker?"
"So cast a
"I honestly don't understand," Pansy tells him, shaking her head.
"The bond!" Draco told him, excitedly. "I think we've managed to break it."
— makes him shiver.
“You were supposed to be back half an hour ago.”
He swears to himself, that night, he’ll never let Pansy delude him into thinking his life can be better than it is, because it can’t. His life is never going to be better. He doesn’t even deserve for it to be better. What was he
"I know you two weren't really getting along," Granger says soothingly, "but still, I doubt that's why he's leaving. There must be more to it."
And Potter really doesn’t need to know that.
Harry looks up then, briefly, and Draco can't read him at all—but he figures the strong set of his jaw as his eyes meet Draco's can't mean anything good.
“Perhaps I’ll let Fenrir have a little fun with you. Wouldn’t you like that, Fenrir?”
instead.
. He looks down at his watch. Far past one. Looks again—past one-thirty. He tries quite hard not to look back at it, pouting as the place empties. It’s getting late and Potter’s not there, Potter’s not showing up, and why indeed is Potter not showing up? He’s literally pacing up and down by the time Potter arrives… flanked by Granger and Weaselbee, of course.
"I know. I'm sorry."
"What? I thought—didn't you say Muggles did this sort of thing for fun?"
“It’s quite a bit like Muggle’s programming,” she said.
Draco does. He understands perfectly. Harry, apparently, not so much.
He can’t find it in him to do anything, not even watching videos on YouTube, especially when he can’t even sleep at night while
* * *
"Merlin," Potter is saying, "what's wrong with you?"
“I…” Draco bites his lip. His world is sinking. He can feel it. “It may be, slightly? I mean, some parts of it”—and the words want out, dear Merlin. Draco, shut up. Shut up or lie, do
But Potter never comes back. Not that day.
“That’s exactly what you said yesterday!” he shouted.
There’s still a bottle of Firewhisky on his side table. It’s still half-full. Half-full is better than half-empty, isn’t it? There are still four left under the bed, he tells himself, completely ignoring that at the rate he’s going they’re not likely to last longer than a couple of weeks. One drink to take the edge off. He’s not crying over that again. He’s done his crying. It’s past. It’s over. It’s done. Gone, and never coming back.
"But then again, my boss has no idea what an arrogant, deceptive prick you are, does she?"
He seems rather angry. Only, at him, not at Weasel. How is that anywhere near fair?
Draco drops the flask he'd been holding. He watches it fall slowly to the ground. He doesn't even react in time to cast a Levitation Charm before it crashes, falling to pieces before his eyes.
"I told you to go away!" Draco yells, but when he finally looks up, Potter is standing by the door to the bathroom, looking for all the world as though his favourite hippogriff had just been
The hand on his back lifts, leaves a bit of sweat that cools quickly, and Miller finally pulls out. Draco backs away, edging towards the bed, snatching off his shirt and backing away again. Backing away until he’s trapped by the coffee table, and the hateful eyes that won’t leave his figure no matter what.
He's still got Pansy, and he'll always have Mother. He should write to her, though perhaps she doesn't need to know the whole story.
was the reason he'd been so cold to Draco after their one night together, but now . . .
"Malfoy," Potter repeated slowly, as if talking to a very small child, "somehow, I don't think this counts as a poison."
The future, the way Harry sees it, is just the compound of thoughts elaborated by a hyperactive mind who knows nothing, knows no one, who doesn’t even know if tomorrow will be tomorrow or if it’ll be nothing, and nowhere and… and…
at exactly the right pace. What truly amazes Draco is that it’s not the last time. What starts with a blow job in the sitting room, soon moves into shagging in the kitchen. Potter bending him over a table, Potter’s tongue doing things down there—marvellous things, mind you, but still things down there, things a supposedly heterosexual Gryffindor might not be too proud of doing if the
Sadly, the mediwizard picks that instant to push a tray shut, blocking Potter’s voice from his ears.
useless. Useless and worthless.)
. "Weasley," Draco says desperately, and Harry freezes. Holds onto his mug as if it were a lifeline. "Ginevra."
But Potter’s answer was vague enough to mean something else—quite often I think so, quite often I hope so—and saying that would mean admitting too much, too soon. Instead, Draco says, “Let’s go upstairs.”
There's yelling. There's so much yelling, and he's only vaguely aware of shoving Harry into a wall once they're back at the Ministry once the case is closed. He's gone so long without talking,
Then Potter brushes the hair out of Draco’s forehead, like he needs to know something, quite frantically. Draco knows not what it is, but it seems to be there, in his eyes, so he smiles a little smile and pushes Potter off him. Then, he bends his head and gives the tip of Potter’s prick a tiny lick, just enough to prove his point. When he looks up to see Potter’s face, his eyes are shut.
It’s quite a bit like Muggle’s programming. Quite a bit like Muggle’s programming.
But then it's gone, just as it came.
Ignoring Potter and his weirdly expectant rambling, Draco starts walking towards the stairs.
It would have been easier if they'd had a sample of Longbottom's potion, Draco guessed, if Slughorn hadn't vanished it so quickly. If only they'd been able to study it.
Draco wants to say no, he really wants to, but he's stunned silent by how much this Potter sounds like the one he got to know during their eighth year. Apparently, that's all Potter needs to go on. "Please?" he begs, reaching out to touch Draco's hand.
Fortunately, they can’t. Polyjuice and all.
“They told me you’ve just been hired,” says Miller, eyes narrowed.
Draco, who’s reading
Draco wants to yell,
“It’s ancient magic,” Draco breaks in. It’s like a gate has opened and now he can’t shut up. Words jump out of his mouth. He tells Harry everything, all he knows, what Mother told him, what he found out afterwards.
“Well,” Potter says vaguely, “likely ‘cause it’s not.”
. The phrase echoes in his head.
*   *   *
“You leave at six.”
“I better give it a run too, I quite like my head where it is.”
“Oh no, dear, trust me, it doesn’t. Not even in the slightest way. To you though, it might.” Draco’s gaze follows her movements on her way to the chimney. “You know what’s hilarious though?”
Damn his lacking luck to hell. Freedom comes, behold!
"Don't flatter yourself, Potter," Draco scoffed.

look. Harry himself had not much of a clue of what she’d been saying, so far into his own imaginary world he’d been, so he basically lifted both shoulders, shook his head, and ordered two Mochas and a Caramel Macchiato.
"I know," Potter says quietly. "I'm sorry."
say, but that,” he said, slowly, “that never happened.”
That night, Draco lies in bed tossing and turning until the early hours of the morning. He can't sleep. He tries to, but he keeps seeing Potter's face whenever his eyes fall shut. He keeps seeing Potter looking up at him, with his lips parted and moist. He keeps seeing him spread out below him on his eighth year bed, thrusting upwards into Draco, and deep down, Draco knows he's completely screwed.
Draco bristles. “It’s not like I’m that poor…”
"I see."
“Well, now I have, and it tastes awful.” He leans back against the wall on Pansy’s garden, glad to observe the sky from a distance. Then, he shuts his eyes. “Not everything can be forgiven, Pans.” It’s not that easy. Some things just can’t. What Potter did to him… Draco finds himself shaking his head, yet again. “I fell for him
Draco suddenly feels like a blushing boy again. It’s quite ridiculous if one considers what he’s been up to these past few months, but none of his dates ever cared enough to make him
Draco’s too tired to have dinner—though he does, if only for the baby. He feels so sad, so empty, days grow longer and longer, and not even Walburga’s preaching or Kreacher’s constant bowing manage to pull him out of the emptiness growing in him.
And Draco would grab a fresh set of robes and Apparate away.

“You...” Hermione blinked. “What?”
"I'm merely self-serving," Draco says. "I'll do just about anything as long as it keeps you coming back to me."
Draco wakes up all of a sudden, a taut shudder running through him. Pansy is caressing his hair. “You’re fine,” she keeps saying, “you’re fine. It’s all fine.”
bonded. That’s what you told me that night. Now, I guess,” she adds, mockingly, “we both finally know to whom.”
They were just simple things at first; nothing major. As a fourth year, Draco used to dream Harry shook his hand on the Hogwarts Express. That he picked
"Wouldn't you like to know?" Draco steps into his building, makes it halfway to the stairs before he turns back. "Well, you did manage to keep at least one of your promises, even though it took you years to get there," he tells Potter, smiling softly. "So whatever I'm calling you now, it can't really be that bad, can it?"
He manages to corner Harry after the ceremony, waits until he's alone to tug on his sleeve.
,” she emphasises. And, okay, that kind of explains it all, the lack of a ‘Hey, how are you?’ and definitely her ‘At last’. “You see, technically, you should have arrived there—” she leans back, checking the magical clock hanging on the kitchen wall, “—around ten minutes ago.”
It’s not a bad look on him, minus the spectacles. Almost passable, Draco thinks.
Draco can't read lips, but it's clear as day Harry is denying something.
“No, but you’re bonded to me.” Ain’t that cheating a bit there, Potter? Him and his dubious ethics, that only exist for others and never for him. Draco wonders sometimes, does Potter ever pause and contemplate Draco had no other option at the time but doing what he did? Selling his body, for cash he lacked. Especially after being denied his passport. “I need you. Please, come back.”
to know about the dreams, but he guesses Harry wouldn't.
And he’s delighted.
Anyway. Draco breathes out, slowly. It’s what he’s here for, isn’t it? A shag. Best to get it over with, then.
saying them…
Yes, nothing new there. It just so happened they both got the short ends of the stick and landed in the same box… the less than reputable one in the far back labeled ‘hooker’. A box that most people try to avoid so much as setting foot in, if they can help it. And, frankly, the ones who do… well, let’s just say they wouldn’t make for good neighbours. Not that either Draco or Pansy had many options for employment in the first place, since everyone knew they were former Death Eaters—especially Draco, as he bore the Mark. But isn’t that swell? At least he’s not alone in this whole new enterprise of theirs!
Potter huffs, looking away. "It'd better have, it's for my patients. Why did you have to go with one of your stupid variations anyway? Why not just brew the normal thing and be done with—"
Draco laughs sharply. Only then he thinks about Potter and his girlfriend who Draco's never met. He thinks about them going on a holiday together and eating croissants for breakfast in their hotel bed, peeling themselves out of their sheets and shaking the stress off over coffee.
to him, and that’s something he hasn’t found anywhere else. Even his coworkers are rather pleasant, none of them too bothered by his ‘failed relationship’ which, mystery of mysteries, left him with a child.
“I don’t want to hear your apologies now,” she hisses. “It was years ago and I’m over it.” And she might be, but Draco feels awful. She’s been letting him stay at her house, with that constantly hanging between them. He’s quite sure there was never an apology on his side—how could he even apologise for something he can’t even recall? “You know, now that I think of it, the funniest part of that night is that you can’t even remember it now, when it actually
In dreams, Draco would eventually be reassigned as Harry's partner.
Harry laughed, and Draco joined in his laughter—but deep inside, he felt hollow. He wondered if that wasn't exactly what Potter was to him. His very own cursed violin, the one who'd eventually ruin his life.
Draco smiles sadly up at her. "I'm not alone though, am I?"
In the end, it turns out it’s all rather pointless. It’s not like he manages to find Potter that day, despite his constant rushing into the nearest loo whenever Polyjuice threatens to vanish from his bloodstream. He doesn’t find him during the next one either, or even the day following that one. It basically feels like a great waste of (illegally obtained; ta Pans dearest) potion on a chore already failed. Especially since, in three full days, he still has no clue where Potter is. Not even after visiting every single place where the

"Terribly bad form, let me tell you, waking your friends up like that."
“Why didn’t you give him back his memories after the Dark Lord…” See, that part there, he didn’t get. He’s still not too sure he gets it. “Why didn’t you break the spell on me?”
Potter pauses in his writing. “You woke up.”
is the main reason Draco kept staying at that lovely gentleman’s place, the lovely gentleman whose fists sent him to hospital. Draco feeds that, of course.
“You wouldn’t—”
Harry drops his fork. "Really?" He looks like he's going to laugh or cry, or possibly even do both at the same time.
leave us like this."
“You’re
And Harry doesn't once touch Draco. Not even when he spills down Draco's throat, besting him by only a few seconds.
“It’s all right,” Potter finishes his sentence when the pause gets a bit too long, “you don’t have to tell me. I was just curious.”
“A new bloke called in,” Pansy tells him. “I was beginning to think I’d have to call him back, ask him to delay the date or—”
*   *   *
Draco can’t even contemplate telling Potter the biggest lie of all. He once told him, it’s not forgotten; Potter just doesn’t know it’s actually him, the lad who lost it in the loo. The thought nearly makes him giggle, though it shouldn’t since it was no fun at all.
Draco feels torn. He wants to be left alone so he can brood, he wants to hate Potter for his carelessness—Potter, who probably doesn't even realise what he's making Draco feel, who has no idea that he'll end up hurting Draco in the end.
Pomfrey glanced out the window. “By Merlin, it’s the full moon. Everybody out! Evacuate the infirmary! Anyone who can walk, leave now! Mr. Potter, help the others. I have to stabilize him before he changes.” She flicked her wand at Draco and levitated him onto the nearest gurney.
“I think that—”
“Why tonight? Is there some significance to the date?” Harry asked. He’d withdrawn a pad of paper and a modified variant of a Quick-Quotes Quill, which was recording their conversation.
“What are you going to do, Potter—kill me? I think last night proved you incapable of that,” he hissed, baiting him further.
Potter stepped closer, eyes manic. “Living with muggles was out of my control! You don’t think I would’ve chosen to live with Ron’s family—or with anyone else for that matter, if I’d had a choice? I’ve never had a choice!”
“It took me a moment to collect myself, after, and I dragged Astoria and Scorpius through the floo with me. As soon as I looked at her, though, I knew she wasn’t going to make it. But I wanted so badly for my wife to be fine that I couldn’t accept that she was dying. My mother went quickly, I think. Or perhaps that’s my own wishful thinking.”
“The others have left, yes?”
“Too right,” Draco agreed, a little too late to sound natural.
. That’s almost worse than Montague calling me a bloody dog.”
Potter sighed. “Yet here I am,” he agreed, after a moment.
“POTTER,” he said loudly, and, rather than having the good sense to just open the door, punched his fist through it. He broke completely through the wood upon the first attempt, but rather than following through on another strike kicked it down instead. Bloody werewolf strength.
Greyback lunged towards Potter, features contorting until they were half-transformed. The moon had not yet risen, but he had given as much of himself over to the wolf as he was able. Draco was moving before he’d even realized what he had done, and leapt in-between the two with no other thoughts than intercepting Greyback. He felt, rather than saw Greyback’s maw clamp over his face, teeth sinking into the soft flesh underneath his cheekbone and above the crest of his left brow. Draco screamed, more a sound of fury than of pain. He raised the athame and jabbed it into the back Greyback’s skull, right above the nape of his neck, the skin around there sizzling and sloughing off. Throughout it all Greyback did not release his bite, nor did he stop scoring deep lines into Draco’s chest and back, leaving his robes slick with blood.
“Stand down, Montague!” A teenage Percy Weasley said, voice run through with a faint tremor. “You’d better let her go, or—”
“Y-you’re just saying that to be cruel. That can’t have even crossed your mind. It’s too… mercenary.”
His days were spent hunting down various and sundry dark creatures, magical artifacts, and outlaw wizards; all the while attempting to evade discovery by Aurors or being killed on the job. Draco didn’t think he’d survive another stint in Azkaban. Without occlumency, he doubted he’d have made it through any length of incarceration at all. Granger once called him a recidivist criminal, and although there’d been a hint of a smile on her lips as she’d said it, her eyes had been sad. It had been worse in the beginning, when he’d been adjusting to the bite and the legal restrictions of his new position. He could recall his second incarceration easily.
“The sarcasm is not helping, Malfoy.”
His back bowed upwards off the bed. “Just do it! Fuck off and let me die! On my honor as a Malfoy and a Black, just kill me!” he screamed—no, yowled, like an animal. He struck out blindly, delirious with pain and in shock from the loss of his occlumency shields.
“Well, what the hell does that mean for us?”
“Draco—” Severus began.
Draco stared at him.
“…Sir,” Draco acknowledged stiffly. “I should have known you were working for Dumbledore, but I suppose it’s preferable to the alternative.”
Draco paused. “I was raised to abide by the old ways of our kind, Potter. This requires me to not only know my own heritage, but that of others’ as well. I’m sure the family spell-books are locked away in one of your vaults somewhere. All you have to do is go to Gringotts.”
“How dare you—” Her shriek was cut off when he made his way into the corridor and slammed the door behind him.
He did not need to tell Potter that wizards did not take kindly to homosexuals and their ilk. That much was obvious. It was traditionally seen as a sign of impotence and a failure to continue the family line in a community where blood was everything. Draco knew that if it had been anyone else, Potter would have been shunned for his open indiscretions. He didn’t think Potter could help it, though; living under the constant threat of death or punishment in his formative years had seemingly left an indelible mark on him. Not the shagging blokes part—which Draco didn’t think one could choose—but rather, Potter’s apparent inability to keep a steady relationship. He seemed unsuited to stillness and kinetic by nature; someone whose freedom came at the cost of their relationships. Or perhaps he was looking too deeply into it.
“Let her go, Montague—else it won’t just be Azkaban for you. I’ll make sure you’re kissed myself,” Potter said, stepping closer to him. It was not a threat but a promise.
“How you were ever promoted to Head Auror is beyond me, you brainless sex addict.”
My Scorpius. Now he’ll have to register with the Ministry. Marked not only as the son of a Death Eater, but also as a werewolf before he’s even had the chance to find himself!” Malfoy snarled, already severe features pulled taut by the expression. He looked almost… feral.
Harry lost himself in the game for the next several hours. He’d gifted Al the new
“Why not try to kill him with, er—whatever it is you did back there?”
“But why follow him to begin with?” Potter said, shrugging off the cloak.
“Bloody time-turners.”
“As if that’s your right—”
“I didn’t know if I could trust you.”
“Professor Lupin’s child?” Malfoy said, settling back into some semblance of calm.
“…I really don’t have a good answer for you, mate.”
“I won’t be long.”
“So, what are we going to do with them?” Potter asked. He looked put-out by Granger’s obvious hatred.
“You must have been—what, nineteen? Twenty? That must have been very difficult for you and your wife.” Malfoy’s voice caught on the word
you insufferable fucking moron!”
“Yes! What can I do?” Potter said, somewhat breathlessly.
At this, something in Harry’s chest tightened. It suddenly became harder for him to distance himself from the tragedy of Malfoy’s situation. He was close, too close. There was a certain level of professionalism required of someone in his position, and it had taken him years to achieve a grasp of neutrality. He still became too emotional with the harder cases, the ones with witches and children; or victims whose death or suffering came at the hands of supposed loved ones. Those caused him to delve into that wilder side of himself—the one that lived in the cupboard and reacted without thinking. The one he hated. Harry’s neck began to prickle uncomfortably. He already wanted to leave.
“Not now, Crabbe,” he told him absently, not registering what, exactly, he had just said. “I’ve got to find someone.”
“Of course. But as lord of the manor, I should have been more forceful with her. I couldn’t bring myself to make her leave, though; she was so fragile after father died that it seemed almost cruel.”
“Dark magic, if you must know,” Draco said loudly. “What with me being a
“I’m sure they feel very different when you’re inside them!”
Draco sagged forward. He felt empty and wrung-out, and quite content to let himself bleed out there on the floor. But from within the depths of the cabinet came a familiar voice: the grinding, animalistic rasp of Greyback. He was supposed to be in Wales, but when did anything bloody well go as intended? Draco staggered to his feet and moved away from the cabinet. He could not let loose a feral half-breed into the school, and certainly not on a full moon. He did not draw his wand, but rather, his athame. Spells rarely worked against dark creatures, even unforgivables, but silver was always effective.
He was washing dishes in the kitchen when Ginny approached him. The sink was full up with chipped plates and cups leftover from lunch, and about half of the extended Weasley-Granger clan was occupying the dining table. Percy and Audrey were having a heated conversation about clocks while Teddy entertained the usually prim Molly Jr. and Lucy by changing his features from one ridiculous guise and into another. Charlie and his girlfriend, Sofia, were near-drunk and yelling at each other about something incomprehensible. Probably dragons, Harry reckoned. Or Quidditch. A group of children comprised of Longbottoms, Goldsteins, and MacMillans were cluttering up the floor, attention held by Teddy’s old model train sets. Luna was examining her tea leaves.
“Sir, please—”
As they neared the entrance, Potter flicked his wand in a neat upward stroke, disarming any warning spells Montague may have cast. Had there been any traps present, it would have instantly alerted him to their presence. Draco positioned himself near the doorknob, while Potter stood on the side opposite, ready to venture inside upon his signal. He nodded at him and proceeded to silently unlock the door, stepping back as Potter darted across the threshold. His wand now poised to strike, Draco soon followed after.
Potter dragged Draco out into the corridor, which he recognized only distantly, as the world faded ever more quickly at the edges. Only the color of Potter’s eyes remained clear now, and they looked almost impossibly green. He smelled of mint, and of the outdoors; a contrast to the lingering odor of spoiled meat leftover from Greyback.
Now certain that he was watching her, Ginny placed her free hand upon his shoulder. It felt nice. Warm. His wife always made sure to broadcast her movements before she touched him. He had never responded well to being surprised, especially by touch. Harry loved her. He loved her so much.
“Did I ask to be privy to your personal issues, or are they simply being forced upon me since I’m physically incapable of running away?”
At this, Potter finally lost his temper. He yelled something incomprehensible and leapt atop Draco, who was still bound tightly to the bed, and began making a very good effort to try and throttle him senseless. For his part, Draco alternated between laughing madly and choking as Potter’s calloused hands closed around his throat. Potter was truly furious and mad with emotion. He was everything Draco despised. His eyes had never looked so green.
Draco just laughed at him. He laughed and laughed. He laughed until he began to sob, and was racked by shudders from the force of it. Throughout it all, Potter did not release his grip on him, nor did he quit staring down at him with a look of furious, nearly agonized incomprehension.
“Oh no,” came a soft voice from behind him. Potter. That—utter and completely empty-headed idiot! Draco didn’t know when he’d slipped in, or how, but what he did know was that he could not allow Greyback to eat the bloody Chosen One.
“I hope you do! I hope you fucking do!”
“No. They assumed, correctly, that we had let our guard down. It’s been eight years since the last attack.”
mid-air, instantly racked by the worst pain he’d ever felt. His aunt had not paused at all: just laughed and laughed. Yaxley had resumed his mother’s torture all the while Draco screamed himself raw, blood foaming at the corners of his mouth like he was some animal. He learned quickly that meddling only made things worse. Those lessons had come easy.
“Yes. I’ve been taking care of him since he was two. He’s a Lupin-Potter, now. Has been for years.”
Once he spied the silhouettes of the others approaching, Draco dispersed the powder and all went dark. The Hand of Glory indeed gave light to the holder, but it rendered the world odd and slightly out of focus. There was enough clarity for him to see this through, though, and he watched with satisfaction as from the cabinet spilled Bellatrix, his uncles, Yaxley, Dolohov, Wormtail, the Carrows, Crabbe, Goyle, Rosier, Nott, Selwyn, and finally, his father. He closed his eyes as they began to thrash and scream, not noticing the sharp intake of breath behind him. One by one, they each ran dry and were left to collapse and sprawl motionlessly across the floor. The wards died instantly at the loss.
“Anything else you’d like to interrogate me about?” Draco said sarcastically.
Later that week, Draco was three fingers deep into a bottle of firewhiskey when a familiar voice interrupted what little relief he’d found after a long day of field work. He sighed at the intrusion, but wasn’t surprised in the least. Potter knew he favored drinking at the White Wyvern—a skanky pub situated deep within Knockturn Alley—and had taken to bothering him there when he needed something. Unfortunately, it was more often than not for a chat. Potter seemed to actually
“What? Like he’s going turn on us? Sure seems likely, after Malfoy bloody well murdered most of Voldemort’s inner circle!”
“But now we’ve got twice the leverage.”
She’d contracted a fatal case of Scrofungulus not two years after the war. It began in the slant of her jaw as a small mole, but multiplied into a tumorous mass within the week. By Sunday, it had spread to the inner lining of her throat, where it grew and grew until she suffocated from the inside. Andromeda’s death left Teddy was orphaned thrice over, and Harry and Ginny as the teenaged parents to an emotionally devastated lycanthrope. They made it work, though. It was hard, but they made it work. Harry had never felt so happy as when Teddy called him “Dad” for the first time.
“Yet here you are.”
“Harry, dear,” Ginny said, coming up to him. There was a basket in her hands, and paint was smeared across one cheek. “Go out into the garden. Al is playing Quidditch with the boys. I’ll take care of this lot in here.” Although her face was fixed in a conciliatory expression, there was something off about the cadence of her voice. Like some deep heaviness she could not shake.
“It won’t lie and say it was easy, but I’ve never once regretted taking him in. I love being a father—more than anything else,” Harry said. His children were his life.
Then he disappeared.
“It would be good to know where we’re going, wouldn’t it?”
“I don’t what the public thinks of me, and I certainly don’t care what
Her eyes glittered in the dim light of the pub, hair spilling long and dark across her shoulders, which were colored a deep shade of lilac. She was clearly the offspring of some breed of fae and a wizard. His eyes strayed to her breasts, which spilled out of the low-cut top she was wearing. Potter’s gaze was likewise occupied.
As the end of spring drew closer, his work on the cabinet quickly approached completion. The warding was finished, and now he only needed to finish the blood sacrifice. That would be done the night of the ritual, which could be performed on the night of a full moon, right as the sun descended behind the horizon. The next suitable date was the coming Friday, and so all he had to do was hold out until then. It would all be over soon. He only had to last the remainder of the week.
was convincing when they attended school together.”
Potter got up and trailed after the fae, leaving Draco alone once more.
She turned to speak to the collection of Death Eaters gathered in Borgin’s. “Draco has succeeded. It will be dark, but do not worry. My son will show you the way.”
A distant expression crossed Potter’s face. “Later, perhaps. When the war is over and I have time.” Sweet Circe, why was Potter telling him this?
—ancient, powerful avenues of invocation, and known only by the oldest families in Wizarding Britain. His father had likewise been ignorant, but his mother was steeped in the old ways. Because she was not a Malfoy but a Black, and their family magics had always been predicated on blood and sacrifice. If one word were to describe the system it abided by then it would be
“You won’t be doing anything of the sort. I’ll put you down like the dog you are, Malfoy, and if I had the time, I’d make it slow. I always did hate you, even in school. Same goes for you, Potter.” These were not the words of a stable individual, made even more disturbing by the varying coherency of his speech.
There was a sound suspiciously like a laugh from beyond the curtain, and Severus rose to his feet at once. His wand was drawn and poised to attack before Draco had even processed what was happening. Severus pulled back the curtain to reveal the disembodied head of a rather chagrined-looking Potter, whose body was presumably hidden within the folds of his infamous invisibility cloak.
Draco set the mirror down and withdrew two more objects from within the folds of his robes: Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder and the Hand of Glory he’d purchased from Borgin and Burke’s at the beginning of the year. After his mother entered, he’d activate the powder to ensure as many Death Eaters followed as possible before realizing what he’d done. No sense in not maximizing the casualties. His lips curved into a tremulous smile, one that thinned further when his mother finally appeared. Narcissa looked more haggard than ever, robes hanging loosely on her emaciated frame, but still she retained an atmosphere of dignity about her.
to apologize. I’ve been thinking about it since I was a teenager. I can’t stand bringing the girls around to their grandparents because all I see there is you, being yelled at by mum or hit by da—or, worse, pushed around by me. I spoke to Sarah about it, and she really thinks that—”
that I do; and therefore, does not have the same magic.”
“It’s working… it’s finally working,” Montague hissed in triumph. “This is going to change everything.” His final proclamation was undeniably ominous in nature.
“Malfoy, you’re such a—”
“That certainly appears to be the case.”
“What the bloody hell—you again?” The ginger yelled. “Why did you break down the door?”
“Malfoy tradition?”
“So do I.” Malfoy looked over at Scorpius, still and unmoving in a bed that dwarfed his small frame. It made Harry think of Al or James, and how he’d feel if they were in a similar situation. Scorpius was only Al’s age, after all. His chest ached.
“Take as many bloody points as you want! I don’t care!” Potter said hotly. “I just wanted to know how he did it! And why! Why
child if you had any bloody sense in that empty head of yours.”
A considering look crossed Potter’s face. “Wait—if Montague’s the one who brought us here, accidentally or not, then how are we going to get home now that he’s dead?”
“No, she did not.”
“Perhaps that’s why I do it,” Potter said, glaring at him. He still sounded vaguely plastered. “Since you—”
it. An experimental time-turner. He was moving before Montague had the chance to activate the device, certain that his werewolf constitution would make his chances of surviving whatever came next better than Potter’s. Montague flicked it on with a neat twist of the wrist, and aimed it their way. The time-turner was already beginning to spin as it arced towards them—
Now Potter’s arrangement was certainly unorthodox, not to mention legally dubious, but Draco supposed he had offered due to some amalgamation of guilt, pity, and that insatiable longing for excitement he hid from no one. What a reckless fucking bastard. Not that this excursion of theirs likely to turn up any real information, as Montague had been underground for weeks now. Carkitt Market was one of Draco’s speculated hideouts for him, but this seemed rather… convenient. But the Head Auror was asking, and so he’d comply rather than risk the only stable employment he’d managed to find.
They were already being punished as it was. The Dark Lord seemed to delight in reminding them of their estrangement from his inner circle: shunned from meetings held in their own home and humiliated by the others at every turn. This from a filthy half-blood usurper who called himself their ruler. Bellatrix’s sycophantic devotion to him was beyond intolerable, allegiance predicated on delusion and fantasy rather than any semblance of rational thought. Blood came before all else, but where was her loyalty now? To the Dark Lord? Certainly not with her family.
“But why would you defect, then? Voldemort is a dark wizard, isn’t he? You lot call him the ‘Dark Lord,’ even.”
“It would’ve only been
“He’d cornered them in the parlor. The moon hadn’t quite risen yet, but Greyback is a savage. He enjoys the change. The pain. I remember that from when he stayed at the manor during the war. He had pushed some of the wolf through somehow, and attacked them while half-transformed. Traditional spell-work isn’t effective against half-breeds like him, but I wasn’t thinking. I don’t think mother was either.”
He knew Potter had taken to shagging dark creatures, which for a regular wizard Draco rather likened to sticking your cock in a beehive and hoping the buggers didn’t have a mind to sting you for it. Either way, the daft bastard really was going to catch something if he wasn’t careful. Draco just hoped it wouldn’t be lycanthropy. Danger fucks were hardly worth the risk. One day he’d end up catching something a trip to St. Mungo’s couldn’t clear up, which would really prove to be the tragicomic culmination of their lives.
He slept little, and did not dream. His head was full up with dark magic and thoughts of his parents. The letters he received from them were few and far between, and laden deep with melancholy. They were trying to be strong, but he could see them faltering. They suffered daily at the hands of the Dark Lord, and the law was poised against them. It was not weakness, though, not to him. After months in Azkaban and then internment in the manor, who could feel otherwise? The Malfoys and Blacks disgraced; their lords and heirs living under the threat of death or torture from mudbloods and half-breeds alike. And in their own home, no less. There was no honor in servitude. That was what he had been told all his life. His mother and father wanted to be free. So he would free them, and then himself.
Harry swallowed. “My eldest son, Teddy, is a werewolf. A born one, that is. We weren’t sure if he was going to change at first, but as he grew older he displayed certain… well, traits we’d been told to look out for. He fully transformed right at the onset of puberty, the summer before he attended Hogwarts.”
The last Friday of April arrived. He went about his routine as usual, but was noticeably more on edge. Although he suppressed the fractious stab of anxiety thoughts of the ritual produced, he felt it seeping through regardless. Blaise and Daphne noticed this, but commented only once. Potter seemed very aware of him, and even sat next to Draco in Potions. Tense, and almost thrumming with agitation, Potter ignored the carefully apportioned ingredients he’d lain out for them, and proceeded to mangle their potion. If not for the fact that he was clearly trying to instigate a fight, Draco would have sought out some petty form of revenge. But he really couldn’t be bothered at this point. He left Potter, still fuming, standing over the charred remnants of their sleeping draught.
“Harry, it was one time. An accident—”
“Humanity?”
“Your mother saved my life. I wanted better for her.”
“No.”
In his final moments of lucidity, he remembered begging them to kill him. Draco remembered crying out and spitting until he could no longer speak but only growl. He remembered feeling as though his blood was boiling from the heat of the change, and that no one could survive such pain.
“My parents had become little more than servants to a mad half-blood with delusions of nobility. The Malfoy and Black lines disgraced; their lords and heir made to bow before the bastard offspring of the Gaunt line. They raised me better than that—to value the honor of our families over all else. Even if they forgot it,
“It doesn’t matter if it was a poltergeist or not, Malfoy. What makes it funny is the fact that it was an accident. Besides, I wouldn’t have brought it up, if you hadn’t—”
“Potter!” Severus snapped, choosing then to step in. He had been spectating long-sufferingly for the duration of their argument, caught somewhere between exasperation and faint amusement. Now, though, he was simply furious.
Severus flicked his wand at Potter, who was raised bodily from the bed by one of his ankles. “
Thanks for all the comments! <3
“I swore an Unbreakable Vow to your mother that I would protect you from harm. Should you die, then I would as well.”
The resulting blast of blood and innards left Draco and Potter doused from head to foot in scarlet, as well as a good portion of the crowd behind them. Most of the children started to scream. All Draco could muster the energy to do was wipe the blood from his eyes. At least the idiot was taken care of.
But there were variables he could not control: the interference of his godfather and that damnable Potter, who couldn’t seem to bloody well keep to himself. He was obviously suspicious of him, and shadowed Draco almost daily now: always hidden beneath his cloak, but rendered identifiable to him by the soft noises he made, little breaths and muted curses that he seemed unable to bite back. How Potter had ever caught anyone unawares was beyond him. In retaliation, he deployed a disguised Crabbe and Goyle as decoys to divert Potter’s attention, and to prevent him from ever reaching the Room of Requirement while Draco was at work. It was only a matter of time before he was discovered, an apprehension heightened by the constant sensation of Potter’s gaze upon him—watching, unwaveringly, eyes livid against the brown of his face.
“I am not quite so cold as you may think, Draco. I’ve watched you grow up from a clever, if impetuous boy and into a young man who I am proud to call my godson. Perhaps you do not feel similarly, given your response. But that has no bearing on our shared bond.”
