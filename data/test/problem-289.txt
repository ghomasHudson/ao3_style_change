Draco wanted to scream. He wanted to shout NO he wasn’t choosing Theo over him. That he didn’t think that he could choose anyone over him. And that hurt. It hurt so much. It also scared him. It scared him so far to the point that he didn’t know if he could come back from it. It terrified him. It terrified him because he didn’t know why. And that was a realisation scarier than death.
“So, are you going to expose me to the matter regarding Potter that is so obviously causing you to act like a petulant, self-pitying idiot?” His father asked and Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco’s eyes widened as the chatting in the Great Hall came to an abrupt stop, everyone’s eyes were on them.
He was taken aback by that. As far as he knew, he was quite similar to everyone else. Morally wise, okay maybe he was a little different, but everything else was the same.
He pulled away from Kat who smiled before joining into the conversation once more. He watched the pure joy light up her features. He grinned, he also never thought that he’d be best friends with one. But as he watched Kat laugh with happiness, he mused that it wasn’t such a bad thing after all.
She eyed him sceptically, “my friends at the Hufflepuff table told me that you were a big, awful, Death Eater Slytherin and to stay away from you because I’m a Muggleborn.”
He sighed. “And I don’t mean just a quick glance here and there.” He pointed out. “I mean really looked at them.” He whispered the last part softly.
“Oh, is that your new sketchbook?” he queried, scooting closer to Draco. Nosey asshat. “We all saw your new little Hufflepuff friend gift it to you at lunch.”
nights kept him alive. He wanted to say that he was doing this for his own good. That he was keeping Potter safe. That he was keeping Potter away from him.
Macmillan sighed, “exactly that. What you said all those months ago really got to me. I realised that I was following Smith around like a lacky. It was stupid.” He admitted, and now that was a truth that he didn't mind hearing.
“But then I found the wrackspurts.” Draco bit back a laugh, because of course it was. “I realised that I could see them. Floating around everyone, and I realised that I wasn’t alone. Everyone was as confused and sad as I was. I wasn’t any different.” She concluded, and Draco felt weirdly better. Even if he still had no idea what in the hell wrackspurts were.
It was all coming back to him. The first time he’d met Potter at the Lake. The tears he’d cried that night. The first time they’d watched the sunrise together. The first time Potter had been vulnerable with Draco. The first time Potter had broken his heart. The first time they’d made love. The first time Draco had spoken to Potter. The first time Draco had told Potter that he loved him…
Blaise chuckled. “Anyways, I should tell you that Kat’s been waiting for you outside the common room for the past several minutes.” He smirked deviously.
He was just about to give up and throw a rather large rock into the late when Potter plumped down next to him.
Draco howled, rocking back and forth, not knowing what to do with himself. Not knowing how to deal with the pain. “He’s gone. He’s gone.” He sobbed out as he desperately clutched the ring that hung round his neck.
“I kissed him. I kissed him.” Draco said again, tears streaming down his cheeks. He wanted the world to swallow him whole. He didn't want to do this anymore. He
Why wouldn't he help her make friends. She seemed to be in a state of disbelief, so vulnerable. Draco felt almost enraged as he figured that someone must've done something to her. Someone who had made sure that friends hadn't been an option for her.
Draco took a deep breath. This was his chance. The old bat had given him a way out, a ticket to sanctuary. All he had to do was be brave enough to take it. He could come clean to the order, ask for protection for himself and his mother. He was certain that they’d provide help for his father if he asked for it. Salvation was right there in front of him, all he had to do was reach out and grab it.
Pansy raised a confused brow, “What are you talking about?” she asked her voice laced in concern, and he realised that he couldn't lie to her.
But he had people who loved him. People who were devoted to him and would do anything for him. He had people to guide him, to show him right from wrong. He had people willing to die to keep him safe. He’d made a family in the Weasleys.
“I know that it probably hurts.” She carried on. “It’s just that Harry’s extremely unstable right now. One of you are going to end up getting seriously hurt if you both carry on like this.” She said mimicking Pansy from just moments before.
He was certain that he’d done it. That he’d fixed the vanishing cabinet. He felt a sinking feeling about the repercussions of his probable success.
Draco was completely submerged. So, locked in the warmth that the locket was emitting that he was only broken out of his trance by Weasley’s violent screams.
But now they’d been offered the possibility of doing things differently. To become wiser, better, stronger. Life had given them a second chance, and it was called
Draco shrugged, shifting slightly closer to his father. Well, as close as the bloody chain would let him. “Trust me, I’d tell you if I knew.” He sighed out.
. And I can’t and won’t let anything happen to you.” He said determinedly before smashing their lips together.
He’d taken the final step to a life with Potter. The rest was in Potter’s hands now. his stomach lurched with anticipation, love, and relief, as he absently realised that he never did see that blue rubber duck.
“I’m fine.” He said trying to come off as emotionless as possible, his heart hurt painfully in his chest at the action.
Her mother said that he’d saved her, but that couldn’t have been further from the truth. Kat had saved
To be frank, he'd want nothing more than to spend the day in bed with Potter, wrapped in each other's arms. His lips curled into a cunning smirk, a evil twinkle in his eyes.
Not being himself at all? Seriously? Draco was currently in a life or death position. Watching his life be ripped from his clutches, and you didn't see him screaming at people.
Draco pulled back abruptly, turning round, and looking into the burning green eyes of Harry Potter. Because of
He shook his head as he struggled to come to terms with his actions, “but why would I have done that?” He asked in disbelief.
“Well?” he aunt asks, pulling on the back of Potter’s head. Her eyes were full of desperation, her voice laced with manic pleading. Draco hated it. He hated her.
“Malfoy!” a cold voice boomed and Draco whipped around to face an angry Harry Potter. Why was Potter here? It couldn't be. Had Potter followed him? But
He was such an idiot. What in Merlin’s name was he thinking? That breakfast would make him feel better. He couldn’t eat. He couldn’t so much as look at food without wanting to throw up. He hated it.
It was if he was cursed. Crabbe let out an almighty cry as he began to loose his grip. Instinctively, Draco reached out a hand, grabbing his hand with his own. He hand was wet and sweaty, but Draco hung on as tightly as he could.
Weasley’s eyes widened. “Exactly. It took a lot not to shove those deliciously succulent chicken drumsticks into my gob.” He looked at the drumsticks in awe, and Draco deemed it the cutest love story every told.
Well, that was just adorable. He thought that this night couldn't get any better, obviously he was wrong. He normally didn't like being wrong. But in moments like these, he couldn't say that he minded all that much.
A cautious cough pulled his thoughts from his mother’s safety, as he glanced up and into the repentant eyes of his father. Part of Draco wanted to shake his head, to tell his father that he hadn’t forgiven him. That he may never forgive him.
Draco took a deep breath. “I used to admire you. I used to think you were wonderful. That you were so powerful. You were my hero.” He admitted solemnly. “I even took this bloody mark for you. Because I believed you. Because I looked up to you. Because I wanted to make you proud.” He choked out.
She had smiled at that and then persisted to ask, “and did you or did you not demand that he do just that even though he had originally refused?” to which Draco once again replied with a simple “Yes”.
Theo tightened his hold on Draco, holding him even closer than before. “Me too.” He sighed. “Me too.”
“That’s quite the surprise you gave me there." That was an understatement, he was still attempting to catch his heart that had conveniently ventured into his mouth.
His father took a step closer towards Draco, a murderous glint residing in his eyes. “Now is not the time to discuss this. If you want to speak to me about it later, then fine. But right now, you’re going to tell me what exactly is going on with Potter and you’re going to tell me now!” he said lowly and Draco shivered.
Draco made his way through the castle, half-running, half-sprinting. He hoped he wasn’t late. He couldn’t be.
Draco rolled his eyes. “But of course, you can. You owe me. I mean, you did almost kill me at the beginning of term.” He said matter-of-factly. So maybe he was guilt tripping the little bastard. Who cares? Draco almost
what it’s called.” He spat out in annoyance, half of it directed at Potter, the other half at the stupid muggle device that had deemed itself too presige to cooperate.
His father let out a defeated breath, “it’s always been about Potter.” He said matter-of-factly. “Has been since the second you met him. That was a lie. It’s been about him since before you even met him.” his father reluctantly admitted.
His father took a deep breath, sitting down next to him on the bed. “I’ve made my choice. There’s no hope for me now. I may still believe in what the Dark Lord stands for, but I don’t follow his leadership. I find that whilst I may believe in what he says, I cannot wholly commit myself to a man like him.” He admitted and Draco was shocked.
Once Draco had finished, his father eyed him in deep thought for several seconds. He raised a knowing brow, “So, what I’m hearing is that Potter and yourself fell in love, you then obliviated yourself in order to protect him. But that didn’t go exactly as you had planned since you so obviously can’t forget feelings. And now you’ve gone and told Potter to think about if he wants to be with you, even though he’s explicitly stated several times that he’s completely besotted with you and doesn’t want to spend his life with anybody else.” He stated.
It worked! It had actually worked. He felt relief rush through him knowing that one more innocent world be safe.
Draco was doing the right thing. He was making a calculated survivors move. How could he possibly win a war if he were too caught up in his emotions. It just wasn’t practical.
Theo shook his head. “People don’t change Draco. They manipulate, they learn, they adapt, but never change.” He gave Draco a warm smile, “And this, the person who you now are, the person that’s standing before me, has always been a part of you.” He stated.
“He knows the answer to that question.” Potter gestured towards Draco, “don’t you Malfoy?” he asked condescendingly.
Draco snorted. “My hero. For none of this would be possible without your sacrifice.” He teased, but sadly he wasn't really in the mood for chicken at the moment.
He knew his mother had written it. How could she not have? He was scared. He was really, really scared. What could the Dark Lord be doing? Was his mother alright? What would happen if—
Touchy. Touchy. Touchy. Here he was trying to make amicable conversation with his godfather, and he was acting as if Draco had been the one to start the blooming conversation in the first place.
Draco nodded and she smiled giving him a light slap on the arm. “We’ve been worried about you, young man.” She chastised him. “Going back home like that instead of following the others and coming to us.”
Draco kept his eyes firmly shut. “I’ve been confused. I’ve just been so confused.” He started what Draco assumed was a long-winded explanation. “I’m meant to be the Saviour of the Wizarding World. I’ve meant to save everyone. I’m meant to get the girl. Marry Ginny. Become a true member of the Weasley family.” He sighed. “But it’s not like that.” He admitted.
So maybe, just maybe Draco finally understood what Blaise had meant when the Hufflepuff's had started a coup. Although he was proud of his Hufflepuff's, he had to be honest, part of him was secretly glad he'd been confined to a coma during their little upheaval. They were terrifying.
He sighed, pulling himself from her embrace, it was clear that she wasn’t going to relent. “You say, ‘it took me nine months to form your heart, don’t let someone break it in fifteen seconds’.” He repeated word for word, and his mother smiled in approval.
Weasley jumped up from his seat excitedly. “Well, come on then.” He gestured Draco to follow him, and he couldn't help but comply.
He realised that it wasn't a question whether he wanted to die or not. No, it was a question whether he wanted his mother to
“Nice to see you again, boy.” Ollivander croaked. Draco smiled at him before handing out the extra food and blankets between him and the other prisoners.
Blaise grinned. “Good. Anyhow, I know you like dick, but have you seen the tits on Greengrass this year? I’m worried she’s going to fall over they probably weigh that much.” He babbled on and Draco smiled a rare smile.
His lips were slightly chapped, as they desperately moved against his. They were begging, pleading, full of emotions that he couldn’t express. Words that he couldn’t bring himself to say. Draco felt his stomach churn, something fluttering inside of him. his heart was beating rapidly, it felt good. It felt
The pleading in Potter’s eyes heavily unsettled Draco. He mused that Potter must be one hell of an actor to pull something like that off. Draco almost believed him.
“I hope for all our sakes that Potter is who he says he is, but how do we really know?” he enquired. He was lying, of course, he had the upmost confidence in Potter. He trusted Potter.
Hermione clamped a comforting hand onto his shoulder. “Isn’t that a good thing?” she asked hesitantly.
Draco didn’t know where to look, so he settled on the ground. Potter scoffed. “Why do you never look at me Malfoy?” he asked. “Why do you never bloody talk to me?”
She gave him the biggest grin known to all of wizarding kind, which he returned. He was just about to help himself to another slice of toast when he abruptly stopped.
Draco shifted closer towards him, submerging himself in Potter’s heat. “Just hold me.” He whispered desperately, and Potter obliged, holding him closer and tighter than he ever had before, as if he never wanted to let go. Draco felt a tear fall down his cheek as he realised that he never wanted to let go either.
“If you must. Arthur will love it.” he assured Draco and that just made him feel a million times more confident. He wanted to make a good impression on the Weasley's.
“I want to hate you. I want to hate you so goddamn much. But I can’t. I fucking can’t. And that scares the shit out of me.” he said and Draco didn't know what to do.
He looked up at her with big, hopeful eyes. “Do you really think that Blaise will help?” he asked almost shyly.
“Draco..” he whispered. “What’s wrong with you.” He asked pleadingly. “If they’ve done anything to you, I swear I’ll kill them. I’ll kill every last one of them.” He spat out angrily, his eyes alive with fury.
So Draco interacted with Lucius this chapter. I really wanted to explore their relationship. Any ideas on what Draco's plan could be? A teaser for next chapter: IT. ALL. KICKS. OFF!
He shook his head. “Not at all. Is it surprising? Yes. Stupid? No chance in hell.” He reassured her.
So that’s how she wanted to play it? Well, Draco wouldn’t stand for such disrespect in his own home. “My excuses are anything but dreadful.” He spat.
chicken when you were shoving my mum’s homemade roast into your fat gob a few days ago?” he prompted, and Draco, once again, shook his head.
They all shook their heads frantically, their lips firmly glued shut. “Then please do yourselves a favour and do shut up.” He bit out before walking into Honeydukes.
With a shaky breath, he ran out of his room sprinting towards the door. He needed to do this. He had to find Potter. He’d been letting fear rule his life, he’d almost let it cause him to lose the one person that could make him truly happy.
In other news, Draco had finally found out why Potter was obscenely good at potions this year. The sneaky bastard had been using Snape’s book this whole bloody time! Well… Potter didn’t
Hermione looked at him pleadingly. “Don’t for one-minute think it’s because we think you’re not good enough for him, because it’s not.” She assured him, completely ignorant.
your fault. You sacrificed your memories. You sacrificed your love. You sacrificed your life so that Potter could live. You saved him by doing that, and by extension, you saved us all.” he finished as tears started to spill down his cheeks.
Potter had been the one thing that he had avoided this last month. It wasn’t as if he were running or anything. He was just finding himself. And that took time.
“Well, I don’t give a rat’s arse what you asked. Now can you please leave me alone.” He spat, before closing his eyes.
The Death Eater chuckled, “Oh, I don’t think so. This little bitch is going to get exactly what she deserves.” He raised his wand and Draco was sure that he was about to attack.
For the second night in a row, he hadn’t been able to draw anything. He had a friend. A new sketchbook and art supplies. Why wasn’t he happy? Why couldn’t he draw?
Draco was sitting perched against his favourite tree, his sketchbook in his lap, a pencil in his hand.
He wanted to cry. He wanted to yell. To shake his mother and beg her to stop. He wanted to tell her broken he was. That some nights he desperately wished he’d fall into a peaceful sleep that he’d never wake from.
Potter and he jumped apart, them both laughing profusely. “Maybe you should stop playing with the muggle clock?” He suggested.
Well it wasn’t his fault that Draco wanted to tie Potter to a quidditch pole and leave him up there for the dementors, for even dare thinking that he could be better than Draco at something.
Potter took a deep breath. “I didn’t mean to. I promise I didn’t mean to. I didn’t even know what that spell did.” He stumbled over his words. “I would never intentionally hurt you like that Draco. I care about you so much. I need you. I need you so goddamn much.” He almost pleaded.
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Just leave him alone. He wanted everyone and everything to leave him alone. He
thing I have ever heard.” He mused in almost disbelief. His father rolled his eyes, “please do close your mouth Draco, it’s ever so unflattering.” He chastised.
Granger narrowed her eyes at him. “So why are you so interested in where I decided to do my homework?” she lifted her chin up giving him a dubious look.
“Who am I partnered with?” he asked absently, as he looked around the classroom. Judging by the red-faced Weasel and the empty space next to him, Draco made an educated guess.
He wanted to help. He desperately did, but how could he possible comment on a question that he didn't know the answer to?
If Draco could, he would’ve cried there and then. He didn’t deserve this. He didn’t deserve her kindness nor her companionship. Yet he had it, and he didn’t know what to do with it.
He felt like he was losing something important to him. Something he couldn't live without. He reasoned it to be his former self's innocence. The naïve belief and devotion he'd had in his father. The very thinking that had got him hurt.
She sighed. “I don’t know.” She breathed out. “I used to wake up sometimes and feel really, really sad. I didn’t have any friends in my old school. They said I was weird.” She said sadly.
“I don’t want to be strong anymore. I’m tired. I’m so, so tired.” He breathed out defeatedly. “I’m tired of the voice in my head telling me to do awful things. I’m tired of pretending to be someone that I’m not. I’m tired of staying strong. I’m tired of fighting. I don’t want to fight anymore.” He declared; his voice laced in pain.
Pansy shook her head. “I don’t quite think that’s how it all works.” she mused and Draco wanted to hex her fat gob shut.
He missed Kat like mad. It was as if a part of his soul was lost and there was no hope of recovering it. But she’d had to leave. He had to keep her safe. In fact, none of the Muggleborn’s had returned to Hogwarts this year. He’d made sure of that.
Draco took a deep breath, rendered completely and utterly speechless. He guessed he was going to the Weasley’s for dinner.
, for all that you have done. And for saving my son. You will always be welcome in our home. You’re a part of us now, you’re stuck with us for the long run.” She said authentically, squeezing him that little bit tighter.
Potter nodded; his eyes wide. “I’m alive.” he reassured Draco stepping closer towards him, and his stomach started to churn. “So are you. Oh, Draco I was so scared. I was terrified that you wasn’t going to make it. That I wasn’t going to make it. But we’re here. We’re alive.” he sighed out in pure relief.
His daughter too, let out a throaty laugh, “grandpa’s silly, isn’t he?” she stated and Draco couldn’t help but nod, because yes, his father was very, very silly.
So, why would a person who had everything need a person who had nothing? It was a question that would rattle inside his brain for a long while yet.
!” the Dark Lord declared victoriously, and Draco closed his eyes as he felt his heart shatter. Hearing it was one thing, seeing it made it real, and feeling it… well that broke him.
Hearing Potter so distraught, so confused, and knowing that it was because of him was a terrible feeling. He didn't know what to do. He could hardly say anything, even if he were permitted to talk to Potter. There was nothing he could possibly say that would make this any better.
Severus turned a shade of green that even Salazar Slytherin would be jealous of. “You stupid, insolent, little cretin. Do you think this is a joke?” He shouted.
Maybe on the outside he appeared calm, but on the inside, on the inside... well, he'd rather not say.
Draco moaned. “More. More!” He begged, arching up against him, pulling him closer than humanly possible. Potter chuckles before slamming into him, hard, fierce, and sure, giving Draco exactly what he needed, of what he’d always needed.
Potter frowned slightly, “I didn’t have any toys. Or family. Or friends.” Draco sighed, he knew how that felt. He wished he didn't but he did.
“Because you loved him. And with Death Eater’s watching your every move, as well as the Dark Lord living in your home, you knew that it was the only way to protect him.” his father answered, and Draco was sure that he could detect a hint of sadness to his tone.
“Don’t worry, you didn’t say anything out loud. You’re just really easy to read.” Draco scoffed. If he was that easy to read then the Dark Lord would’ve realised that he wanted nothing more than to subject him to a painful death.
Something was wrong. Something had gone terribly wrong. He knew it, deep within his gut. It was over. It was all over.
Draco plastered on a fake smile. “I’m fine.” He repeated. “Let’s just go.” Theo nodded when he added, “Can you wait for me outside? I just need to use the bathroom.”
Draco was sitting in the Slytherin common room alone. He’d screamed at the few Slytherin’s who had come up after dinner, telling them to go the fuck away.
Kat beamed before bringing him into a hug that he returned. Draco’s eyes met Potters from across the hall. They were a mixture of bafflement and surprise. Although once he’d noticed Draco looking at him, they flashed with annoyance and dislike. So, he guessed Potter hadn’t forgotten the small incident on the train from a few days ago.
Why was he making this so hard? Why couldn't he leave Draco alone? He already felt horrible, he already had the weight of the world on his shoulders. He didn't need this too.
He honestly didn't know how Jerry's parents put up with him, but he gave them a small round of applause in his head.
His mother was huddled into a corner, complete discomfort plastered onto her sleeping features. His father was siting next to him, wide awake, deep in fury. For once, Draco understood the emotion on the elder Malfoy’s face, the act was nothing but mortifying.
His mother had promised to strong, his father had promised to protect him, the Dark Lord had promised to be right..
Potter flinched, patting Draco’s shoulder. “The bread doesn’t come with the toaster. You put it into these little slits, then press on this button and it toasts the bread.” He answered.
Draco looked down at his crossed legs, “I don’t have anyone.” He admitted quietly, more to himself than anyone else.
She nodded. “You were. Oh god, Draco you were.” She gave his hand a little squeeze, “sixth year wasn’t the best for you, as you know. But every time you came back from your little nights with Potter, you were lighter. You’d be smiling ear to ear, and you were no longer the boy destined for misery. You were free.” Pansy stood up and pulled him into a tight hug.
Slughorn gave him a disappointed look, “mind your language and please take a seat.” He gestured to his potions desk.
The Hufflepuff's were living legends. The lot of them! He needed to see this, and he needed to see it right now.
Theo racked his hands through his hair, “that you haven’t given me an answer.” he pointed out and Draco was tired.
“Were we not good enough for you? Didn’t you love us? Why did you put us in harms way? Why did you damage me so? Aren’t we enough? Why wasn’t I enough
He coughed, “what are you doing here?” he asked, shamefully embarrassed of everyone looking at them.
? Oh, dear Merlin, he could see it now, the wizarding world completely overrun with Draco Malfoy prider’s, that was something he definitely didn’t want to see.
Draco looked up to face a puffy eyed Lavender Brown. The girl looked like she’d just gotten into a ferocious battle with a Crup. And had lost. Badly.
Draco gave him a reassuring grin. “It was perfect.” He answered honestly without giving too much detail. He preferred to leave some parts to Potter's imagination.
Draco choked on the very air that he was breathing in. “That sounds, umm, extremely interesting.” He attempted. “But don’t worry, my mother and father aren’t getting a divorce.” Well, he didn’t think they were. Could you even facilitate a divorce from Azkaban?
The Great Hall was as magical as ever. He looked around at the tables full of students, examining all their faces. There was an abundance of emotions. Some were happy, some were tired, some were relived. But no one. Not one face looked vengeful. That was something that brought a small smile to his face.
He smiled a sad smile. “I know that I should stay away. That I should run away and never look back. That what we have going on between us is an all-consuming destruction.” He said absently.
The Headmaster opened his moth to speak but was immediately silenced by Potter’s growl. “You know what? I’m done with your fucking shit.” He announced stepping away from the Gryffindor table, “have fun fighting Voldemort without me, because I’m done.” He added with finality, the Dark Lord’s name sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
potions freak. It’s mad, it is.” He boasted and Draco could literally see the daggers that Mrs Weasley was shooting his way.
He stayed silent. A silence that meant that he was tired of fighting, now that there wasn’t anything left to fight for. His silence meant that he was tired of his feelings, not wanting to feel them anymore. His silence meant that he was ready to adapt. His silence meant that he had chosen.
His eyes softened considerably as he put a hesitant hand on her shoulder. “I’m okay Pans, really I’m okay.” he tried to reassure her,
Draco had to admit, the Headmaster had that one coming. You don't simply interact with a man that's just gone off the edge, and expect not to get burned. It just wasn't possible.
Draco could hear the glare from Mrs Weasley’s frustrated tone, “Well, you won’t be able to try anything with a chopped off tongue. I hope you’re well acquainted with your sense of smell, because that’s the only sense you’ll have left after I’m done with you.” She yelled before stomping into the living room.
He felt cheated. Used. Unloved. He’d done this for his father. Scarred himself for his father. Lost his innocence for his father.
He took a deep breath, “I don’t know. I seriously don’t know anymore.” He attempted to walk away, but Potter caught his arm, bring Draco closer towards him.
Closing the door again, once more, Draco muttered a further few spells before opening up the cabinet for a second time. He felt his heart stop as he took in the fallen creature.
His aunt hit him again. And he felt worse. If that was even possible. His mother’s screams and his father’s cries were echoing throughout the room. They were pleading, no begging, for his aunt to stop such a ludicrous act. He tried to listen to them, to lose himself in the sound of their voices. But all he could hear was the blood pounding in his ears.
He decided that time could pass. People could leave. Memories could be forgotten. But feelings, those were something that the heart could
He scoffed. “What an ever so informative analysis, Healer. So far I’ve learned nothing.” He retorted giving her an annoyed look. “Wait!” he said frantically. “I think I’ve actually learnt something. It’s small but it’s there. Maybe if I just focus my energy on the wrackspurts then I could just….”
The Slytherin’s were currently losing 60 to 120 against the Ravenclaw’s in their quidditch match against them. It was a complete massacre.
She pulled him close, “It’s not your fault sweet child.” She murmured soothingly into his ear. “You saved her.” she whispered in pure amazement.
It was loud, desperate, and pleading. Draco wanted to drown it out. He wanted to pretend that it wasn’t there. But he couldn’t. He wouldn’t.
She smiled at Draco, “hello, Draco. I see that the wrackspurts are still as potent as ever.” He blinked at her, because ‘wrackspurts’ were the only things that he couldn’t understand. But when he’d brought that up Luna had just laughed and said, ‘that’s the whole point Draco.’
“Hugging you?” Potter said as if It were the most obvious thing in the world. “I’ve missed you so much. I’ve been up every night, just pleading that you was okay. That I’d see you again.” He started and Draco blinked in bafflement.
Potter growls picking up his neglected cock, giving it a couple of long, firm strokes. “Come for me.” He demands and Draco cries out, coming in long, desperate spurts, drenching them both with his juices.
It was quite easy to spot in all fairness. The boy's lips had curled at the words 'hypothetically', and let's be real, no one smiled at a stranger they did not like or somewhat trust.
He focused his attention on the drawing in front of him. Draco loved to draw. He’d fallen in love with the art the day his mother had gifted him some parchment and colouring pencils.
Draco sighed exasperatedly. “Well, please refrain from getting any of your ‘optimism’ on my bed. These are clean sheets.” He pushed a laughing Blaise off.
He looked up at Draco with emotion filled eyes. “through these rings, our magic has come together as one, just as I hope us to.” He got down on one knee and Draco gasped. “What I’ve been trying to say is, will you
He was just about to advance on a reporter when a swarm of purple butterflies started attacking the reporters out of nowhere. It was hilarious. There were screams, shouts and cries. The butterflies were biting the reporters with a vengeance. They bashed and bumped into everything that was anything as they hastily made their escapes.
He looked as though he might have been considering, so Draco carried on. “Why don’t you just take your chances?” he proposed fairly.
He felt bad. Here Potter was only trying to offer his assistance and Draco was acting like a brat. Still, he'd rather die than admit defeat.
Pansy shrieked, jumping up from her seat, her face red with anger, “What did you just say?” she raised her wand in threat and Draco felt scared. Very, very scared.
He took a deep breath, deciding that at this point there was only one thing that he could do. The one and only thing that would bring him peace of mind.
Ashamed. He was ashamed of what he had been reduced to. Of what Potter had reduced him to. Of what the world had reduced him to. Of what he had reduced himself to.
Potter shrugged. “You’re right Draco, I accepted your invitation without your permission and I’m sorry.” He started and Draco glared. “But you’re going no matter what, so don’t attempt to fight me on this.” He informed in defiance and Draco saw little point in trying to object.
With a shaky breath, Draco’s hands wrapped around Potter’s own present, handing it to him. Potter smiled before hastily opening it.
It had been a few days since the death of Kat, and he hadn’t cried since. He didn’t need to scream, nor shout, no, he didn’t have time for that. He didn’t have time to feel. If we all stopped and let every little misfortune break us, then where would we be?
He was digesting the talk he’d had with his father several moments earlier. It had hurt him more than he could ever imagine. He thought that at the very least his father would listen to him. That he would try to understand him. He never would have thought that his father would brush off his words in such a way.
He was stood in front of the mirror thinking about how he should be preening at his gorgeous looks. To many Draco was a beautiful devil. To Draco, he was a cold, narcissistic, ugly monster.
Sometimes, just sometimes he wondered what would happen if he confided in Severus. If he told him all that was wrong in his life. Would Severus listen? Would he understand? Would he
He sets Draco down carefully on the ground, besides the warm fire. Slowly, he begins to unbutton his shirt, revealing his slender but somewhat toned frame. Draco turns from him slightly, suddenly feeling extremely self-conscious. He hates his body. He’s always hated his body. Potter tuts, steering Draco’s face to look at him. “You’re gorgeous.” He says earnestly before kissing him once more.
He smiled. “I like to think that they’re up there, watching over me. That they’ll always to be there to guide me and protect me. That no matter where I am, at night I’ll always be able to see them. A bit like their love for me, I may not be able to feel it, but I know it’s there. Always.”
Potter moaned as he arched into Draco’s touch, “and I love you doing that.” He gasped out. “But do you know what I like better?” he asked flirtatiously.
Theo sighed. “You’re right. I’m sorry.” Draco nodded in acceptance. “So, what’s going on between you and Potter?” He asked hesitantly.
Son of a bitch. If anyone dared to tell Draco that this manipulative, cunning, old bag wasn’t a proper Slytherin, then they could quite literally suck his dick. Unless they were Theo, he did NOT want him to suck his dick anytime soon.
“We haven’t said those words yet.” He said simply, in an attempt to stop from answering a question which answer he wasn't one hundred percent sure of yet.
He suddenly felt extremely guilty. This was all his fault. Kat was such a lovely young girl and she deserved an abundance of friends. She’d decided to befriend a mean, horrible Death Eater and now had hardly any friends her own age.
And for the first time, he realised that the darkness was needed. That it was the one thing that drove them. For the light was a good thing, but stars could only shine in the dark.
“Draco we’re going to be late for breakfast.” Pansy yelled as she burst into the room, and Draco shielded his face from her.
Blaise clasped his shoulder gently, “Draco, you’re my best friend. I know you better than you know yourself. What ever problem you have with yourself, I want you to know that it’s okay. I’m here for you and we’ll get through it.” He smiled and Draco was taken back by the seriousness in his tone. Blaise was never serious.
Draco rose an eyebrow. He was fine. Well, except from the fact that he bore a mark of evil, was set an impossible task, hadn’t had one bloody idea on how to kill the old crow, hadn’t gone back to fix the vanishing cabinet until the start of term oh and let’s not forget this thing he had going on with Potter that he didn’t know what to do with.
He answered him in the only way he knew how. He threw at Potter the first hex that he could think of. He missed.
The dreaded day had come. He didn’t want to do it. It was the last thing that he wanted to do. But he had to. He had no choice.
He sighed, carefully sealing the letter in an envelope that was never to be opened. It scared him. How much he needed these letters. How they kept him fighting. How they kept him living. He mused that the reason behind this wasn’t Potter. It could’ve been anyone. It just so happened to be Potter.
Hermione gave him a smile. “We’ll see you later Draco.” She promised as she gestured for Weasley to follow her out of the room.
They lay like that for several minutes, seeking comfort in one another. Draco took a deep breath, “I wish that it was you.” He muttered honestly. “I really, really do.” the admittance hitting him, leaving him raw with pain.
He glanced down at his pale arm; his mistake was staring accusingly back at him. If he thought he was something before, with this brand on his arm; he was virtually nothing.
Had it really been that bad? Draco glanced down at his feet filled with guilt. “So, I’ve heard.” He sighed. “I wish I could remember; I at least owe him that.” he half-asked, half-admitted.
since the beginning of seventh year. Potter had not once left Draco’s mind. Everything had been about him. He’d never felt so drawn to Potter in his life.
Ahhh so they've kissed!! Harry went OFF! Put Dumbledore in his place, Harry! A hint for next chapter: Blood, lot's of blood.
“Oh, hello Draco dear. I was just about to pop over to the manor and check where you’d gotten to. Looks like you’ve saved me a trip.” She exclaimed merrily, and Draco suddenly felt scared. Very, very, scared.
Potter chuckled dangerously. “You’re sorry?” he snarled. “You’re fucking sorry? That’s all you have to say for yourself?” he demanded an answer that Draco could not give.
And part of him knew that he could go to sleep right now, that he could forget all about it but, would he be able to rest? That was the question.
He narrowed his eyes at her. Him dramatic? How rude. It was an outrage. A travesty. A bloody catastrophe! So, maybe he liked to flick his hair and flare his robes to make a valid point. It was normal. Dramatic his arsehole. Draco, dramatic? That was laughable.
He looked around at the action, no one seemed to have noticed him which was a good sign. He also observed that as far as he could see, there wasn’t any dead bodies. There most definitely could be an abundance of bodies somewhere else in the castle, he prayed that wasn’t the case. But it appeared as though most of the action was happening in the foyer where he stood, so he determined the chances to be quite low.
He was almost finished with his sketch. He reckoned that it had turned out pretty well. It was subtle, sweet, simple. But it showed so much. He felt so much when he looked at it. It reminded him of all that was right in the world. All that made him happy.
As he came back to himself, he felt weird. He looked around, unsure just how he managed to stray away from the Death Eater’s. He didn’t mind too much. In fact, he was glad, he hated them. He hated them all.
“Thank you for your blessing.” She bit out sarcastically. She carried on, “You had just been born, and it was the happiest day of my life. The Healer had just handed you to your father and I watched how his eyes sparkled. He looked more beautiful than I’d ever seen him. He just looked down at you with so much admiration, with deep, unconditional love. And he smiled at me.” She smiled softly, “That’s when I knew.”
He smiled with glee pulling out a purple badge from his pocket and pinning it to the Death Eater’s robe, ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ it read. He was still a Slytherin after all.
Liars. The lot of them were liars. Draco just had to make friends with over two dozen mini little Hufflepuff’s. He had to just get to know every single last one of them individually. A few Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Slytherin first-years just had to join the Draco Malfoy Pride. And of bloody course Draco just
She waved before walking towards the store. Moments before she was about to step inside, she stopped and turned towards him.
And all Draco could do was say nothing. He said absolutely nothing. He used to think it was because he didn’t deserve Potter. That not speaking to him made it seem less real. That he’d soften the blow when he inevitably betrayed Potter to save his mother.
Potter sighed. “Why didn’t you stay to watch the sunrise?” he asked. “Why did you leave me? Don’t you care?” he asked again his voice cracking.
Ah the whole Slytherin and Hufflepuff one-sided hating. Slytherin's had hated Hufflepuff's for as long as he could remember. It was fitting in a way, he supposed. The sly, scathing Slytherin praying on the innocent Hufflepuff.
“I’m sorry Draco. I’m so sorry for doing this to you.” He sobbed. “Seeing you in that bathroom. Watching as the life left your body. That was the most scared I’d ever been. I’d never felt fear like it. It was if all was lost. The only thing that kept me going, had left me and it was all my fault. I felt broken.”
He eyed him sceptically. “So, let’s say that I hypothetically believed you, why should I trust you?” he questioned, and Draco could tell the moment that he new that he had Nathan on side.
“I’ve lost him.” he sobbed into her shoulder, crying harder than he thought humanly possible. “I’ve really lost him.” he almost whispered.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that because he was scared. He was so scared. Ironically, he guessed that he was too cowardly to realise that. But he understood now. His heart had been broken so many times he couldn’t bare to have it break another.
Luckily, a fallen angel intervened, “Harry, are you not going to introduce me to you friend?” She asked pointedly.
“What’s you’re problem?” he accused, and Draco wanted to scream that it was none of his damn business. Instead he kept his eyes firmly fixed on his book.
Well, if he knew that then he would’ve said. What part of ‘I don’t know’ didn’t Potter understand? Draco raked a hand through his messy hair, “I just don’t know. I really don’t know.” He admitted, a hint of hysteria in his tone.
? He couldn’t remember the last time his father had genuinely asked how he was feeling. It was weird, almost refreshing. Most definitely out of character, but Draco didn’t mind so much.
Draco carried on. “It’s just I couldn’t do it, is all. I’d much prefer a cushy Auror job. Hanging by the office with an unlimited coffee and chicken supply. And spending my days fighting on the field, being commended as a hero.” He smirked. “Sounds like a pretty good deal to me. But what do I know?” he finished, smirking triumohantly from ear to ear.
Blaise nodded his head in agreement. “You’ve killed us Draco. You’ve absolutely killed us.” He teased.
Draco shook his head. “You don’t mean that.” He attempted, half convinced that Potter was just saying what he knew Draco wanted to hear.
Draco nodded. “You could say that it’s quite fascinating.” He said slowly, before diverting his attention back onto his appliance.
It also was taking everything he had in him not to snap. He had two minds not to grab their pathetic cameras and shove them up a place they’d never be found.
Potter took a sharp intake of breath, frantically shaking his head. “No. No. No. No. NO!” Potter shouted. “Draco, No. Why?” he cried.
“But I can’t. I need you Malfoy. I need you so much.” He sobbed, his voice laced with vulnerability and Draco’s heart broke for a second time that evening.
Draco knew that he shouldn’t walk towards it. That he shouldn’t draw any more attention to himself than he needed to. Alas, he found himself involuntarily walking slowly towards the pillar. His feet taking soft, curious steps as if they had a mind of their own.
Everything would be okay in the end. He had to think that. He had to believe that was true, for it wasn't the end if everything wasn't okay.
Let's be honest, Draco would be fantastic at anything he decided to do. Well... except asassinating his Headmaster. It seemed that Draco was bollocks at that.
The rest of the Slytherin sixth years had gone home for Christmas leaving him without anyone. Pansy, Blaise, Theo and surprisingly Weasley, had offered for Draco to spend Christmas with them, but Draco had politely declined. It just didn’t feel right to spend Christmas with anyone who wasn’t his mother.
Mark his words. Weasley was going to become a chicken specialist in the future. There was no other alternative.
He didn’t have a chance to dwell over the dream when Madam Pomfrey appeared at the foot of his bed. So, he was in the hospital ward. That made sense.
She looked at Weasley as if he was all she'd ever dreamed of. All that she'd ever wanted. All that she'd ever
He felt weird. His head was heavy on his shoulders, his heart was beating rapidly. He forced himself to relax, to find peace in the darkness. “Just let go.” She whispered. And he did.
Severus sighed. “Anyways, I shall tell the Dark Lord that you will have completed your task by the end of the school year. Because,You. Are. Going. To. Complete. It. By. Then.” He threatened.
“Well, I don’t wake up every day to impress you with my commentary.” He huffed before walking towards the gates. As he got to the lock, he stopped, before turning back to face the amused girl.
What was even more crazy is that he even missed Potter. Just the smallest, tiniest bit. He missed their jabs and taunts. He missed the sneers and the spats. He even missed Potter’s stupid greens eyes, his stupid smile, and his stupid scar. He hated that scar.
Severus snarled. “Don’t humour me, you idiot. What do you think your father will do when he finds out that you’ve been off gallivanting with a Hufflepuff who I may add is a mudblood, as well as accepting filthy muggle gifts. What an earth would the Dark Lord say?”
He nodded. “Of course.” He started to lead her through the battle, “now lets get you to safety.” He stated, pulling her tight and keeping her safe.
The slamming of a door broke him from his thoughts. Draco looked up in surprise to find Kat standing in the doorway, a band of Hufflepuff's trailing behind her. They promptly ignored Slughorn’s protests and marched up to Smith with pure determination.
Theo nodded and Draco shoulder’s sagged in relief. “That’s understandable. I was actually wanting to ask you something.” He breathed out nervously.
He really wanted chocolate. He really, really, really wanted chocolate. And he wasn’t going to pay for it. Merlin no! He had been the one asked out on a date, he hadn’t done the asking. He expected Theo to treat him like a gentleman.
Draco chuckled, looking down at his miniature saviour. “And what exactly do we have here?” he teased.
The confession that he had been waiting for. It was obvious that this girl had been head over heels for Weasley since their fourth year, maybe even before that. She looked at him the exact same way that he looked at Potter.
In fact, Theo had been the perfect date so far. Welcoming, thoughtful, sociable, it was all Draco could've asked for. He didn't like that. It made all of this, all the lies and the deceit, just that much harder.
Draco took a step back, distancing himself from Potter. “I don’t know.” He chocked out, suddenly feeling extremely hot. “I don’t fucking know anything anymore.” He admitted, feeling more confused than ever.
The Headmaster gave him a deep frown, “If there’s anything, and I mean anything that I can do for you, please don’t hesitate to ask.” He said genuinely.
Madam Pomfrey chuckled. “Oh yes, you appear to be quite popular.” She remarked before pulling back the curtains.
There was a pregnant pause before Weasley sighed thoughtfully. “You’re different Malfoy” he mused, and Draco kept in an eyeroll, because of course, he hadn't heard
She scoffed. “Don’t make me laugh Draco. You’re the biggest child here and you know it.” she said. Well, that just had to be the biggest lie that she'd ever told.
Draco glared at him. “Well then, you’d better get on with it.” he spat. “In fact, you all better get on with it.” he proclaimed ushering them out of the room. “Chop. Chop. I haven’t got all bloody day.” He waved them off in a chorus of bye Draco’s.
It was currently around ten at night, and to some that may seem an early time to go to sleep. To those deluded, idiotic, imbeciles Draco would like to give them a personal ‘fuck you, are you an owl?’ He decided that many wouldn’t appreciate his statement, he’ll try to care right after he stops not caring. So… never.
She cackled. “I’ve always known you were weak. A small, terrified likkle baby. That’s all you’ve ever been.” She started; her crazed filled eyes boring into his own. “I knew that you’d never go through with the task that our Great Lord had so graciously set you.”
The Hufflepuff's drew their wands dauntingly, “oh, that was a threat by the way, if anyone was confused.” Kat said in a chirper voice before leading the first years out.
“NOOOO!” Draco screamed as he jumped in front of her, the Death Eater quickly lowered his wand sending Draco a confused look.
Draco blushed. “Well, it is a pretty fabulous arse.” He murmured taking a sneak peek at the wonderous bump.
Draco made it back to the Slytherin common room at exactly eight forty-five. He was exhausted. All he wanted to do was grab his sketchbook and curl up outside the Great Lake.
He shook his head, “this is my burden and mine to bare alone. I love you Pans; I really do.” He took a large gulp of air, “but I need some time to myself. I need to be alone.” he said with finality.
Draco carried on. “No, it’s for my mother. My beautiful, loyal, strong mummy. The woman that would do anything to keep me safe.” He declared. “So, I’m doing all of this for her. If it were up to me then I wouldn’t be doing it at all. But it’s not and I have no other choice. I love you father.” He admitted. “I think that I’ll always love you. But I don’t like you. I don’t like you at all.” he spat before ending the call.
But of course they were listening. For some reason his two best friends appeared to be absolutely obsessed with him. He understood why. Draco was pretty interesting. But alas, that didn't make the whole thing any less alarming.
So, Draco done the only thing he could do. He’d made the only choice that he could’ve made. He’d held out his hand. One that his father had taken as Draco pulled him into a strong embrace. He didn’t know how long they’d stayed like that, tangled in one another, but he’d found that he couldn’t bring himself to care.
The buzzing in the hall fell to a stop and Headmistress McGonagall took the stand, she shot Draco a small smile before she started to speak. “I would like to welcome you all for a new year at Hogwarts.” She looked at them warmly, and Draco’s heart clenched.
Draco felt a sick smile of satisfaction curl onto his features as he raised his wand, intent on finishing the job.
Draco knew exactly what Severus wanted, he wasn't exactly subtle. He'd been trailing Draco ever since he'd been back at Hogwarts. It was all very peculiar.
Well, he couldn't disclose that piece of information. He deemed it quite inappropriate for the dinner table. So, he found himself at a loss.
Hermione came up from behind him, bringing him into a soft embrace. She felt warm and comforting. She smelt like fire and parchment. Things that reminded him of home. Something that Draco had always been. He didn’t have that anymore.
“Draco!” Kat tugged his arm, snapping him from his thoughts, he looked up at his friend dizzy with worry.
Draco was making his way to the potions classroom the next day to meet Weasley when he was pulled into a surprise attack. He laughed pulling his attacker closer.
His father had escaped from Azkaban a few months before, and Draco had felt conflicted when he’d found that out. On the one hand, it was his father and he loved him. On the other, his father was a prejudice bastard who had sold his family out to the devil himself.
“I’ll make you happy?” she asked innocently, and Draco’s eyes teared up at her words. The same words that he’d heard so many years ago. The same words that kept him alive. That kept him fighting.
Draco shook his head frantically, refusing to answer. If he said his name then it would all become real. But the problem was it
“I thought I said that I didn’t want to see you again any time soon, Mr Malfoy?” she asked pointedly.
Draco felt warm all over. That little anecdote had meant more than he could ever express. It felt nice to hear how much his father loved him. There had been many a times where he questioned that. But hearing his mother express his father’s unconditional love made him feel accepted. Something he had always longed to feel where his father was concerned.
He missed the days where he could just curl up into his mother's arms, safe from any harm that would come his way. What was he now?
He just wanted to know. He didn’t want to be baffled or confused. He didn’t want to spend endless days and nights antagonising over everything. He just wanted to understand. Was that too much to ask?
Weasley took a deep breath, “calm down mate, why don’t we take this outside yeah?” he said carefully.
She gave him a quick thumbs up before turning back towards the phone. “I’m here grandpa.” She told his father, and Draco smiled. He wouldn’t admit it to anyone but the interactions between his father and his daughter never failed to make his heart swell.
“Now you don’t speak unless spoken to. You hardly spend any time with your friends. You’re either in the library or spending time with you Hufflepuff minions. You don’t eat eggs for breakfast anymore.” He spat out.
And he was tired of lying. He was so, so tired. Lying was a choice. He didn't have many of those. But with the ones he did have. Well, he'd be a fool not to use them wisely.
him to understand. To acknowledge the part he had to play in Draco's undoing. To accept the dark life he'd plagued his son with.
It was also all so insensitive of him. They’d all just fought a war, and instead of worrying about that or helping others move on. He had ostracised himself from society, in the hopes of spending all his days thinking about Potter. He was truly pathetic.
Several seconds later and Draco finally regained the ability to speak. “Let her go.” He said lowly, his voice wavering in fear. Not for himself, but for Kat.
He sighed, “you’re right, you’re right.” he repeated. “I’ve just received some unsavoury news from home, that’s all.” he admitted truthfully. Because it wasn't a lie, not really.
Potter let out a frustrated breath, “I know you can’t remember, but I don’t care. I’ll never care. I love you to much to care. None of it matters. Nothing matters, the only thing that matter is that I have you.” He admitted as he attempted to take Draco’s hand in his.
Draco shook his head. “They are platonic.” He hoped his words didn't sound as shaky as they did to his won ears.
Draxo know Weasley's middle name. Has his Potter obsession been a Weasley obsession all along? He wouldn't be all that surprised by that. After all, gingers were the new brunets.
Theo turned towards Draco, his features softening. “Would you like that Draco?” he asked with care and Draco nodded. He couldn’t be around Potter, not when he was like this.
No Theo, he wasn’t bloody listening to him. He had the whole plot to kill his Headmaster thing to think about. Seriously, people could be so inconsiderate.
Draco eyed him sceptically. “And what exactly are your intentions with Kat, Ricky?” he snarled as if the name was distasteful.
He was currently sitting crossed legged in the middle of the Slytherin common room. A thing called a screwdriver in one hand and a toasterer in the other. There were plastic snakes scattered all around him.
Pansy shook her head in amusement. “He’s dating Harry Potter, best friends with Hufflepuff’s, whilst impulsively going around handing Muggleborn’s portkey’s in order to save their lives.” She smiled. “I think Potter’s Gryffindor had more than rubbed off on him.” she declared.
Suddenly, his body was overwhelmed with the feeling of pain. He was shaking violently, tears were falling down his face, blood was trickling from his forehead. His head felt huge, his eyes were rolling into the back of his skull.
Draco looked up at her with reassurance. “And I bullied him for five years. Made his life hell. Called you a mudblood. And spent my days criticising Weasley’s family.” He said. “I’m not perfect. I made mistakes. But I learnt from them, as will he.” Draco finished hoping that they'd understand where he was coming from.
He gathered his strength for what he hoped was the final time and opened his mouth to speak. “Father, I want you to keep silent and listen closely.” He ordered, pausing for several seconds. When the phone became silent, he took it as a sign to carry on talking. “You’re holding down on the speaker, that’s why you can barely hear me. Take your finger off the speaker.” He urged him.
“No, my other father, Constantinople.” He deadpanned and she glared. “Yes, of course, it’s bloody Lucius.” he quipped, because how could one be so
, and then tells Draco off for a simple cordial greeting. It was typical. So fucking typical of him.
Draco also found it extremely peculiar that he was friends with Hermione and Weasley but not Potter. From what he could remember Potter was hardly ever there, and when he was, he hardly acknowledged Draco except from the odd taunt. When they were alone, Potter was vicious. Pushing and shoving Draco, desperate to make him hurt. It wasn’t as if Draco minded, he deserved it anyways.
His father took a large, defeated breath. “You’re right.” he admitted, and Draco’s eyes widened because
She let out a defeated sigh. “Fine. I trust you. But don’t make me wish that I didn’t” she said simply.
All that time he thought it had been the ring. He had believed that it was the only thing to bring him warmth and security. But he had been wrong. He had been so, so wrong.
With a swish of his robes, Draco strutted out of the corridor and towards the Malfoy apparition point, he prayed that the Hogwarts’s defences would be down so that he could at least get in.
He nodded. “I know. I should’ve realised the manipulative bastard that Smith was long ago.” He admitted again and Draco was weirdly proud.
Draco blinked a few times in amazement. Surprised that such an acute statement could come out of such a small girl.
Pansy jumped up from the bed so that she was towering over him. “No, you don’t. No, you fucking don’t.” she screamed at him “You can save her, Draco. You can help her. All you have to do is give her the Portkey.” She urged frantically.
Draco dug his nails into the palms of his hands. A part of him that was larger than not wished that he drew blood. He wanted to hurt. He wanted to feel the pain of suffering that he so desperately deserved.
Draco gulped, “And Potter?” he asked, even though he wasn’t sure as to why he was asking. It wasn’t as if they were together.
Severus put a hand on Draco’s shoulder shaking him vigorously and Draco started to feel deep frustration arise from within him.
“I’m here too.” Harry told his father, mischief dancing in his eyes. And Draco braced himself for whatever he had planned.
He could hear his mother’s smile through her voice, “then we’ll be there to catch him.” she reassured him. Draco let out a deep breath, and for the first time, he truly believed that everything was going to be okay.
it’s true. I saw it when I looked into his eyes. They were full of bafflement and misunderstanding. They weren’t his eyes. They weren’t
Potter’s eyes were burning into his, them filled with determination and an unspoken sense of hope. “Why didn’t you tell them.” He asked, and Draco froze. “At the Manor, you knew it was me, but you didn’t say anything.” He challenged and Draco felt the blood drain from his face.
Didn’t Potter realise that it was rude to follow his alders? If Draco had to guess, and a guess it was because he didn’t know. He’d guess that Potter was 56 days younger than him. Not that exactly, because he definitely didn’t
Merlin! They were just going around in circles. “It’s just surprising that’s all.” she shot him a glance that urged him to continue. “I’m not that good of a person, why would you ever want to sit with me when there’s so many other better choices?” he replied, albeit a tiny bit insecurely.
“Stupid, boy!” Bellatrix screamed before his body was hurled from the floor, slamming onto an opposite wall.
But it was something he knew that he was. Something he knew that he would always be. And that terrified him.
Anyways, the past three weeks had given him time to think, to understand and accept himself. He was still a long way off, he shifted slightly as he raised his hand to knock on the door before him, but he hoped that what he was going to do today would bring him one step closer to happiness. After all, the closer he was to salvation, the closer he would be to getting Potter back. And he wanted Potter so much.
Draco slapped his arm playfully, “you’re an idiot.” He laughed as he dragged himself out of bed, suddenly aware of the fact that he was stark naked. Potter eyed him hungrily.
A high-pitched squeak erupted from behind the pillar and Draco found himself taking another cautious step.
Who did he think he was kidding? You don't just apologise to someone months after the incident had occurred. What game was Macmillan playing?
Potter scoffed. “You started making friends with first-year Hufflepuff's. You made a friend in Ron and Hermione. Everyone got to have a piece of this new Draco. Everyone except me. And I was confused. I was so confused. I didn’t know why I cared. Why it mattered so much.” He sighed.
Her entire face lit up as she passionately went off on a tangent about her first encounter with Professor Snape and that she didn’t think he was as bad as everyone had said. Claiming that all he needed was a mug of hot cocoa and a hug.
With a sigh, Draco got up to leave, but was stopped when Potter’s arm latched onto his pulling him close.
To think that Draco could be spending his evening lounging in his dorm. Instead he was stuck here trying to make an idiot Gryffindor see sense.
Great, just great. He knew that there was a strong possibility of this happening. After all, what kid was going to believe that big, bad Death Eaters were after them. Especially when it was coming from the son of a renowned Death Eater.
Draco raised a confused brow and decided that he would never understand this girl. “What are you talking about?” he questioned.
“I became happy because of you.” She started “And I know that you’re even sadder then I’ve ever been.” She stated and Draco was amazed.
Again, it wasn't any of his business, Draco told the truth anyways. “To meet Weasley, we have a potions project to finish.” He answered.
Not up for discussion Draco’s arsehole. Who did he think he was? Who did they both think they were? Telling Draco what to do. Acting as if he had to follow whatever they decide for him. As if they were his father or something. Well, Draco hated to break it to them, but since he didn’t follow his father’s orders anymore, they could go and suck his left toe.
Draco’s heart clenched. Those were the words he’d waited months to hear, that he had waited a lifetime to listen to. Thinking them was one thing, hearing them was another, but believing them… well, that was another thing altogether.
“It’s time we put our narrow minded, bigotry beliefs behind us. That we learned to trust and believe in one another. I am no different to you and any of you are no different than I.” she gave Draco a small smile. “Katerina Pritchett knew that.” She stated and Draco’s breath hitched as he started to cry uncontrollably.
She sniffed. “That’s not even a little bit funny.” she chastised shooting him a glare. Draco begged to differ, he was a comedian
Blaise laughed. “That bag is bigger than you.” He puffed out. “You look like that great big fat guy that muggles are always talking about.” Ah! He had heard all about the fat man.
“NO!” he shouted rounding his wand onto his friend. He had to protect Potter. He had to keep him safe. It was the only way.
Neville sighed, “I don’t think that anyone deserves to die.” He said honestly, “But people like her… well, they don’t deserve to live either.” He gave Draco’s shoulder one last squeeze before joining the crowd.
I just wanted to say THANK YOU for all the comments and kudos so far! the response has been quite overwhelming. You're comments and kudos inspire and urge me to carry on writing, so thank you.
“I told you things Malfoy. Things I’ve never told anyone before. Things I want to tell you and only you.” He started. “I was vulnerable with you. I told you that I needed you. And you left me. Why did you leave me?” he whispered that last part, his voice wavering and breaking.
“I know you can’t hear me.” Potter started and Draco wanted to scream that yes, he could hear him and also why the
She nodded, a single tear fell from her eye, cascading down her pinkened cheek as he saw the back of the drawing.
He shook his head, standing up quickly, “I’ve just remembered the transfiguration essay that I haven’t yet completed. McGonagall is going to chop my balls off.” He had to admit, but he really liked his balls. And he meant
Draco pulled abruptly away from her, suddenly feeling a wave of anger pass through him. “I never have a fucking choice.” He shouted. “I thought I had the choice of choosing to become a Death Eater. Well, I bloody didn’t. I thought I had a choice to not kill my Headmaster. Nope, don’t have that either. I thought I could chose whether or not to let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Oh, would you fucking look at that. Still no bloody choice.” He spat out hysterically.
So, Draco let go of his fear, and the pictures came flooding in. Him and Potter hand in hand walking down Diagon Alley. Potter and him buying their first house together. Potter and him getting married. Their first child. Their second child. Them growing old together, loving each other till the day they died. He pictured his future, and it was all Potter.
Pity. It was such a belittling emotion, one that someone felt when they didn't know what to do. When they didn't know how to help. He didn't need it. He didn't need it at all.
He kept his gaze firmly fixed onto the ground below, his father was urging him to join them. He wouldn’t go. He’d never join the Dark Lord’s side. Not after what he does. After what he had done.
The screams carried on. They were like a never ending nightmare, finding comfort inside his head. He needed to stop this. He needed to be brave. He needed to be strong.
Just then, the door swung open and Potter came stomping in, followed by Hermione, Weasley and the Weaselette.
The battle was in full swing. Rubble and plaster lined every inch of the floor, the walls were cracked and burned. The nights air smelt musty, but the breeze was cold, chilling him to the very bone. Curses, hexes, and jinxes were flying at and over his head, and Draco quickly brought up a shield. He’d rather be safe than sorry.
Draco rolled his eyes. Lucky him. His crazed aunt was keeping a killing to herself for once. Must be hard for that murderous bitch.
He sighed. “All right, all right.” He repeated, holding up his hands in defeat. “So how have things been without me?” he asked genuinely quite curious .
While they snogged, they both kicked their shoes of Draco pulling Potter closer and closer onto the bed. Potter’s feet hit the bottom of the bed, Draco withering beneath him.
Hope was the only thing stronger than fear. And if there’s no hope, then there’s only fear. And if there was only fear, then there was no reason to fight. And if there was no reason to fight, then it was over. And if it was over, then he had lost.
Sure enough, Kat turned to face her an evil look residing in her eyes. “Oh yes, we can be very, very scary.” She pulled out her wand. “Would you like to see how scary?” she questioned innocently.
So, he’d done the only thing he could’ve in that moment. He’d smiled. One that wasn’t forced or manipulated. A genuine, heartfelt smile which said all that he couldn’t express.
Before him lay a sketch of a smiling girl. Her eyes were wide with wonder, her smile was vibrant and pure. She looked carefree, beautiful, alive…
Draco had managed to sneak past the Death Eater’s and escape to the pond that was located near the back of the Manor’s grounds.
He opened his eyes wider, almost excitedly as he took in surroundings. His heart dropped a little as he saw himself in an unfamiliar place. His heart plummeted even further when his eyes fixated on none other than Harry bloody Potter.
What was he meant to say? I’m sorry that I haven’t visited you in prison father, I’ve been too caught up confessing my love for Potter to acknowledge your existence. Oh, and also I’m still not one hundred percent sure that Potter wants to be with me at this point, so there’s a possibility that it was all for nothing.
“I didn’t mean fleeing to another country.” He argued, but deep down he knew that his objection was weak. He had virtually given Potter the wings to fly away.
Draco gasped into the kiss, pulling Harry closer, as tears silently ran down his face. Harry’s lips were soft, sweet, pouted, and all the things that he remembered them to be. It was everything. He had
Of fucking course he found that hard to believe. He wasn't as barmy as everyone else apparently was, he actually remembered the git he used to be.
The first night after Draco had cast them away with a portkey, he’d felt broken. He still did. He was just far better at hiding it.
Draco nodded. “Me too.” He replied quietly, trying to forget about what he had just done.Theo gave him a small smile before leaning in. His lips brushed Draco’s carefully, with caution. Draco breathed in before deepening the kiss. He didn’t particularly feel anything. He couldn’t feel anything anymore. But he needed this. He needed something, anything. He needed to feel something other than emptiness.
I'M WEAK! I COULDN'T KILL DOBBY :(  That kind of hurt, but we do love a little bit of Drarry! I kind of wanted to explore the Draco and Lucius dynamic. I don't much care for Lucius but even though he hasn't got great morals, I believe he loves his son.
Potter shook his head, clasping Draco’s hand with him. “No, I think that it’s an amazing idea. There’s no one I’d rather spend my time with.” He said solemnly. “Please say you’ll come.” He pleaded.
Potter sighed, “You need to stay here. You can’t leave. I’ll come and get you when this is all over.” He stated and Draco’s eyes snapped back up to his.
Draco started to pale. He couldn’t move. He couldn’t speak. He couldn’t breathe. He wanted it to stop. He couldn’t take it. He couldn’t
“I have no idea.” He spat out in between puffs of laughter. “But I’ll tell you what, it feels fucking amazing.” he assured her, tears of joy streaming down his cheeks. It felt good to laugh. It felt
make me happy.” He told her truthfully, the words no longer feeling like a poison on his tongue. No, they tasted like salvation.
He gave Draco a quick peck on the cheek after checking if anyone was looking. They couldn’t afford to be found out. A rumoured Death Eater and the Boy Who Lived, a couple! That was sure to bring some unwelcomed attention.
Draco’s eyes widened with intrigue. “And who would this girl be?” he enquired, he had to admit, he did like to indulge in a bit of gossip now and again.
Gently, Potter pulled the ring from its chain, before letting it drop to the floor. Now, holding two rings in his hands he muttered a charm and Draco watched in amazement as the two rings fused together to form one.
Potter sent him a curious glance, which Draco ignored as he spun on his heel and headed towards the Great Hall for lunch.
As the dark mark’s shock flowed through him, the first thing that Draco felt had been relief. It was over. It was really over. He truly couldn’t explain how it felt. To not have anyone tell you who to be. To feel a weight be lifted from your shoulders. To be free. It wasn’t an illusion, no, he was really free. He. Was. Free.
He knew that it would always protect him, that it would always keep him safe. The ring gave him the strength to carry on living.
Pansy stared at him in disbelief. “But he’s horrible to you Draco. I see the glares he sends you; I know that he laughs at you when your down. What he did today was just the icing on the bloody cake.” She said frantically.
His best friend glared at him, before calmly, too calmly, picking up the empty tray and promptly banging it against her head repeatedly. Draco raised a brow in pure amusement, “and what do you think you’re doing?” he chuckled.
The Battle was at an all time high as he walked towards the Room of Requirement. He had to find Potter. He knew that Potter had wanted him to stay in the room. That Potter wanted to keep him safe. But what about Potter? Who kept him safe?
A heavy hand clamped onto his shoulder, “stop ignoring me Ferret.” Weasley’s growled and Draco sighed.
Everyone looked at him in fear as his face turned a deep shade of red. “You didn’t bloody help. No, you two made it worse.” He glared at them.
He grinned. “Most definitely. You may be a confident, brave Gryffindor, but I’m a sneaky, sly Slytherin. We Slytherin’s don’t indulge in anything which means do not justify the ends. Self-preservation and all that.” He half-joked, half-assured.
His attention immediately turned to the lifeless figure before him. Frantically, he scooped her up into his arms. “Kat!” he howled. “Wake up, please wake up. You’re okay. You just need to open your eyes. Do it for me. Open your eyes.” He begged, pleaded.
. I’d forgotten it all.” he admitted. “But despite that, despite it all, I never fell out of love with you. I may have forgotten the how, but I’d never forgotten the what.”
Draco didn’t much know what to say, luckily Harry came to his rescue. As always. “Don’t worry mushroom, I’m
Harry knew he was still alive. He felt him all around him. He felt his magic thrum throughout the ring that hung from his neck. He felt him in his heart.
Draco turned to glare at him. “What makes you think that there’s anything wrong?” he asked sceptically, hoping that Potter would come to his senses and leave Draco be.
Draco shook his head, “I can assure you Weasley that I haven’t been kidnapped.” he walked towards the potions station taking over from Weasley. The potion looked remarkably stable. What a pleasant surprise.
Madam Pomfrey shook her head. “You and your Hufflepuff’s are going to kill me.” She huffed and Draco laughed.
As he opened his mouth to comfort his friends, he felt his heart shatter. The warmth, the comfort, that he had been submerged with was gone. The feeling that protected him, that kept him safe had disappeared.
The aroma of freshly cooked sausages hit him like a tonne of bricks, and quite frankly it made him feel sick to his stomach.
His mother’s eyes shone with tears as she ignored the gasps and shrills, nestling herself in Draco’s warm open arms. He hugged her tightly, despite everything he was safe. It was him and his mother against the world.
, it was the fact that a crazed madman wanted to kill his family and himself if he failed to kill the Headmaster, ruining the lights fighting chances in the process, perhaps aiding the death of his boyfriend.
“Of course, you’re drinking it.” Draco answered and Weasley sent him a death glare. “Don’t look so pale, Weasley. This is not a potion without an antidote and even if there wasn’t one, depending on the potency of the potion, we can manipulate it’s timings and effects.”
She glared at him, “I’d keep it shut if I were you.” She told him and Draco promptly shut up, he figured that he liked his balls a little too much to dare to speak.
It pained him to be this vulnerable to someone. To give his heart so wholly to another. To have his whole life residing in one’s hands. The thought was terrifying. But if Draco had learned anything, it was that in order to love it wasn’t a matter of letting go of the fear but holding it close and embracing it.
It was torture. He was seriously considering taking his chances with the Dark Lord and return to the Manor without completing his task.
? The pits of Draco’s stomach filled with dread. What was Potter talking about? Who was he talking about? Draco let out a choked sob, fearing that he already knew.
“Ooo! That’s so exciting!” Kat exclaimed before going into a long rant about Slytherin green hair. Pansy gave him an
But what he did know, what he so desperately knew was that Potter made him happy. Whenever he smile, whenever he spoke, every glance, every touch, Draco found himself being submerged deeper into everything that was Potter.
Draco couldn’t quite believe it. But he wanted to believe it, he wanted to believe it so bad. He didn’t know what he had done to get Potter to love him. He couldn’t remember. He was sure that something had happened between Potter and himself. The way Potter looked at him gave him away.
Draco nodded. “Don’t act oblivious, father. It’s not a good look on you.” he told him bravely, and the look on his father's face had made it
Hermione’s quill dropped onto the table; her mouth slightly agape. “A chicken specialist!” She bellowed, which earnt her a telling off from Madam Pince.
In fact, it was kind of nice that he had somewhat of a friend who saw past his thoughts, or even didn't acknowledge his faults. No, she just saw him. Just
It was if he were in a dream. A beautiful dream that he never wanted to end. Potter loved him. Potter
He pointed his wand at him in threat and hopefully power. The Headmaster carried on but Draco paid him no mind, the ring that hung safely around his neck started to pulse. It hot and heavy. Reminding him of what he was. Of what he could never be. Of all that he was going to lose.
Potter sighed. “If you’re wondering how I got in here, and I know that you are, you gave it to me in second year.” He answered and Draco gave him a confused look.
He put his arm of Draco’s shoulder. “When I look at you I see someone worth believing in. I see someone with all the odds against him, but still battling to keep the ones that he loves safe. I see someone brave and strong. Someone who hopes and someone to put my hope in.” he gave Draco a small smile. “You’ve changed Draco. And you’re the exact change that I want to see in the world.” He finished.
Several moments later, and Draco stopped in his tracks, before him lay the body of Jerry. Big mouth Jerry. Draco let out a cry as he fell to his knees, holding his body close. Too many innocents had been lost to a war with no biases. He was so young, so, so young.
He cautiously approached his father’s cell. At least they’d made alterations so the prison was somewhat liveable. He understood those who agreed with the inhumane conditions that the prisoners used to endure, claiming that they deserved it. That didn’t necessarily mean that he agreed with them.
Draco huffed. “I don’t want to talk about it.” her turned his back on his father, it was none of his business. What Draco thought felt or maybe possibly feels was none of his concern.
Did he want to give his blessing? No, not really. Did he want to hex the small boy into next year? Definitely. Was Draco going to act like a mature adult? Sadly.
Draco stayed like that for several seconds, contently enjoying the moment. Then he blinked, coming to his senses.
Seriously? What was up with all these death jokes? They weren't even that funny. Okay.. they were hilarious. But that wasn't the point. It was al;l very concerning.
“Really?” he mused. “Because I thought that it was hilarious.” he gave her a smug smile, and he could feel her deciding whether or not to smack him there and then.
How rude. As good as a potion gets. Did he have any idea how breathtakingly flawless their potions was. Idiot. The lot of them were. Gryffindor's. Well, except Hermione. But she was different.
Love wasn't stupid. Dangerous, yes. But stupid... something so beautiful couldn't be anything more than perfect. Yes it was terrifying, living in constant fear of falling with no one there to catch you. But in all honsety at one point of one's life it was a fall that were all going to have to take.
Why? Just why? Why had it all come down to this? Why did he have to do this? He'd been naïve. He'd been so naïve, going through the year as close to normal as he'd possibly could. He'd been foolish. So. so foolish.
Potter brushed them off, paying them hardly any attention. “You’ve been ignoring me ever since the start of the year. But now I pop the fuck of, you’ve seemed to acknowledge my bloody existence. How nice to be noticed by you Headmaster.” He sneered.
Harry Potter was standing before him. He was holding Draco in his arms, giving him the most loving smile that he could muster. Draco hadn’t seen Potter in months, but he was here. He was holding Draco and it seemed as if he would never let go.
Draco blinked in complete shook. So, this was what this was all about. Now it all made sense. She wasn’t scared, no she was ashamed. He guessed she hadn’t quite figured that part out yet.
Where had he heard that before? Oh yes, only two bloody minutes prior. It was if Pansy and the Gryffindor's had planned this. Some kind of Draco Malfoy intervention. Well, he wouldn't stand for it.
Draco had planned to work on the nuisance that was the vanishing cabinet. He hated that cabinet. He hated it’s smirk. He hated it’s smile. He hated it’s fucking laugh. When this was all over, Draco would take extreme pleasure in killing it. Who’d be laughing then? Definitely not that blasted cabinet, because it would be dead. Sucks to be it.
“That’s Potter-Malfoy to you.” Harry told his father and Draco shook his head knowing how much hearing that grinded on his father’s nerves.
Draco was currently in potions, pretending not to feel Potter’s eyes burning a hole into the side of his head. How rude. Didn’t Potter realise that Draco was under a lot of stress. Doing the biddings of a madman does that to a person. Let’s not even go as far as to mention Draco’s own self-loathing, or else he’d really be opening a can of worms.
Draco nodded. “Yes, yes have me.” He gasped out. “I want you, only you.” He murmured. Draco could feel Potter’s erection, hot and hard through his bottoms. He squirmed against his lap, allowing himself to press against his erection, again and again, breathless with want as Potter’s eyes flashed with desire. Draco wants him. He can only pray that Potter wanted him just as much.
Potter grinned goofily, “So I’m guessing that you like it?” he teased and Draco nodded frantically giving him a small peck on the lips.
The Headmaster carried on, “Forgive me, Draco. But I cannot help feeling these actions are so weak that your heart really couldn’t have been in them.” He said calmly and Draco hated him.
Hermione pulled him into a hug. “I’m sorry Draco. I’m so, so sorry.” She sobbed. “But please, just stay away, it’s for your own good.” She warned, before pulling away. Weasley gave him a gentle clap on the back before they walked away.
Draco kept his gaze fixed firmly on the ground beneath him. He couldn’t look up. If he did, then it was all over. He wasn’t strong enough. He couldn’t deny Potter.
“Whatever, Malfoy.” Weasley snarled before retreating towards where Potter and the mudblo— Granger were waiting.
There was a soft rustle from behind the pillar, but the thing, person or object in question remained hidden.
He’d always known that he was there but knowing it and seeing it were two different things. Whilst yes, you could say that Draco had already witnessed the Dark Lord in his home when he’d received the mark, but he’d been shipped off to Hogwarts only shortly after that.
“I know you don’t remember.” Potter whispered against his lips. “But I do, and I’d be a fool to ever give you up Draco Malfoy.” He admitted before quickly fleeing the room without so much as a second glance.
If she was going to take the leap then that was okay, he was certain that he'd be there to catch her if she ever fell.
He heaved, letting it all out. “Because he’s going to kill her. He’s going to kill her and I can’t—”
Draco felt horrible. It truly sounded like a wonderful idea. From a group of Hufflepuff first years following him around as if he were some hero, the group had transformed into a sanctuary for all those who needed acceptance. Kat would’ve loved it.
He didn't have time for this. He was tired. He was so fucking tired. Stupid Hufflepuff's and their adorable faces, full of want and need. Draco could really do without the glitter in his hair.
Since the Astronomy scene used some quotes from the Sixth Book I wanted to put in another Disclaimer: I do NOT own Harry Potter. I mean would I really have deprived the world of Drarry if I did? Spoiler.... NOPE!
“Why do we need all of those?” Jerry butted in and Draco saw red, he pulled his wand out waving it at the boy frantically.
She laughed, “What am I going to do with you, Mr Malfoy?” she asked him, and he had a few suggestions.
So, Draco took a deep breath, laying his art things on the ground next to him, then doing the only thing he could do. He extended his arm over entwining his hand with Potter’s. He promptly ignored the warmth that gathered in the pits of his stomach.
“I know he took Ginevra. What does that have to do with me?” he questioned, the Weaselette’s given name in his mouth tasting like poison. Not that Draco knew what poison tasted like…
As a parent, you wanted to protect your child. To drive all their worries away, making sure that they only ever felt loved and cared about. And to hear this, even more so as he was about to ship her off to Hogwarts, unsettled Draco deeply.
He carried on, eyes red and puffy. “I hate this. I hate you two interfering with everything. None of this is any of your damn business.” he snarled at them.
“Is that any way to talk to the guy who just saved your life.” He folded his arms, raising an eyebrow.
that you can hear me.” The voice exasperatedly pointed out and Draco stopped in his tracks realising that the person in question wasn’t going to give up.
Draco raised a brow. “And it’s taken you several months to grow the balls to tell me just that?” he asked sceptically.
Theo’s nostrils flared, his hands shaking with anger. “And how do you know that?” he questioned harshly, and Draco's heart squeezed a little.
But during the night, Potter was different. He was kind. His smiles were genuine, his laughs sincere. Every night without fail, Potter would meet Draco at the lake. He would talk to him about his day, he would share jokes with him, Draco knew his favourite subject. Defence against the dark arts.
Honestly, Draco had no idea what to feel. One part of him was full of embarrassment, but the other bigger part of him felt deep gratitude and belonging.
He carried on, “And if you get sorted into Hufflepuff, then I trust that you’ll show the same kindness, love, and acceptance that she’d always shown.” He pulled his daughter into a tight embrace. “I promise you; I’ll never be prouder.” He told her earnestly as he held her close.
It had been a rocky journey. One filled with bumps at every turn. He’d survived, then he’d lived. He was weak but then he’d found strength. He’d lost but now he loved. And if you asked him if he would go back. If he would change anything. Then, his answer would be no.
“Well, we both know how that went.” She sighed. “Blaise and I were distraught. We knew you’d be upset about losing Potter, but we never would’ve dreamed that you’d act like that. It was if somehow you resented Potter more than you loved him.” she gave him a saddened look.
His daughter took a deep breath. “I’m not sly like you or brave like father.” She stated and Draco had to admit that he was more baffled than ever.
He sighed. “I know it sounds crazy. It’s only been four months and I already feel like this. I can’t quite believe it myself. Never mind accept it.” he held onto Draco’s hand even tighter. “I just know that there’s no one who understands it like you do. No one that’s willing to just listen to me. No one who just sees me. Not the Boy Who Lived. Just me. You. Only you. It’s
“You literally never called a group meeting.” Piggy started and Draco narrowed his eyes at her. “We followed you into this classroom. You didn’t say anything.” She defended and the rest of them nodded.
Draco’s heart sunk as he entered the Grand Foyer. The reconstruction work on the castle had been phenomenal, but just because you could no longer see the blood stains, didn’t mean that they weren’t there.
Draco took a deep intake of breath, “you’re obviously not able to put together coherent sentences. I’ll speak to you once you’ve learnt better vocabulary than that of a five-year-old.” He snarled before turning to leave.
“Your Hufflepuff’s were amazing today during potions, Smith looked about two seconds away from passing out.” He chuckled. The git deserved it Draco mused. “And don’t get me started on the Draco Malfoy Pride badges, I mean what in Merlin’s name is up with all of that?” he teased.
Actually, he was disappointed in all of them. And here he was thinking he'd trained them better than that. Well, obviously he was wrong.
. But he couldn’t find the words. He could see it in Potter’s eyes, he could see the love that shone deeply within them. Potter loved him, there was no doubt about it. And Draco… well he didn’t know how the
He took a deep breath. Sometimes, he wished he were a Gryffindor. He’d have the strength to grab what he wanted by the balls. The strength to chose death over life in favour of doing the right thing. But alas, he was a Slytherin.
Hermione blushed shaking her head. “I think I’ll take your word for it.” she offered, in an attempt to diffuse the situation.
“Dracoo. Draco. Draco. Are you even there?” a frustrated growl snapped him from his thoughts as he diverted his attention back onto his father.
He had his answer. Maybe justice and revenge were two different thing. Perhaps, justice wasn’t revenge and revenge wasn’t justice. But sometimes…. Just sometimes, they coexisted together in perfect harmony.
But like the powerful, influential woman that she was, she remained strong. “So, I ask again, what do we have to be thankful for?” she prodded with determination.
Draco sighed. “Can I leave now? I’m tired.” He asked already getting up, determined to leave whatever the answer may be.
“You know what?” Weasley choked out. “I may rethink that whole auror thing after all.” he declared and Hermione smiled.
His hair wasn't even styled. He was sure he looked a right mess. He shot her an 'are you serious?' kind of look which she promptly ignored.
His nails scratch at Potter’s back. It’s as if he were an addict and Potter was drug. He was lost. Lost in Potter. He screams as Potter traces a slick wet finger along the crack of his arse, skating over his whole. Draco didn’t even remember Potter muttering the charm.
He promptly ignored any attempt of conversation from Blaise or Theo as he got himself ready for bed. He felt awful. He hadn’t realised that’s why Pansy was upset, that she cared so much about him.
He coughed a low cough, “I’m not a proper Death Eater.” He lied and Nathan perked up with interest. “I’m a spy, and I know on good authority that Death Eater’s are going to storm Hogwarts tonight, and your kind will be the first to go.” he said, and found comfort in the fact that his words did have an essence of truth to them.
Theo gave him a sceptical look. “You don’t have to lie to me Draco, I won’t judge you.” He said kindly and Draco felt his walls begin to crumble.
Then again, what kind of name was Ricky. It sounded so mundane. So normal. And Kat was anything but normal. She deserved someone that was on her level.
Draco shook his head, too upset to talk. He just wanted it to all go away. He just wanted it all to stop. Even if it were just for a little while.
Most people determined him to look that of his father. That didn't particularly please him. As far as he knew, his father was cold and cruel, someone Draco didn't much fancy resembling all that much.
Well…most of the time. Okay, some of the time. So maybe there was that one time that he willingly took the dark mark, hoping to earn his father’s approval. There was also that time when he endlessly bullied Potter and his minions, not to mention half of Hufflepuff house. He’s changed. He likes Hufflepuff now. Well, one of them at least. Anyways, there was also that one time when he agreed to assassinate his Headmaster for the Dark Lord, even though he really didn’t want to.
Kat moved closer towards him, whispering in his ear, “Daddy’s new girlfriend doesn’t wear a lot of clothes.” She mumbled secretively.
Draco looked up at her with hope lining his eyes. “Not make me drink any more of those disgusting potions?” He enquired with disdain, “they should be illegal.” He decided.
“Draco…no. When? How? Why?” she begged him for an answer, and he realised it was time. It was time to tell the truth.
Theo looked at him, startled. And Draco took his silence as confirmation to carry on. He didn't know who needed to hear this more, Theo or
Draco stared hard at the cabinet. He could swear it was mocking him. He could feel it taunting him. Draco stepped closer towards the cabinet to get a better look. Well it was definitely wood, quite old and wait… what was that?
Well… his plan was that he had no plan. But that was besides the point, it was still a plan, nonetheless. That was the Gryffindor inside him talking.
She shook her head. “Don’t thank me, it was a team effort.” Draco chuckled she was such a Hufflepuff. “Anyhow, I best be getting back now, it’s almost curfew.” she told him and he agreed, it was getting pretty late. The last thing he wanted as for her to get in trouble because of him.
Draco gulped feeling distressed. “But I did choose.” He admitted more to himself than anyone else. “I chose to be better. I
“No, it’s not fucking okay, Ron.” Potter shouted and the Hall went silent. Seriously, you couldn't even hear a pin drop.
Potter burst into laughter. “You got him chicken for Christmas?” he asked almost disbelievingly and Draco truly did understand Potter's disbelief. He hardly believed it himself.
Draco felt his heart give out a small squeeze. “I came back to Hogwarts with the intent of doing just that. Of being all that I was supposed to be.” He chuckled, “One look at you, and all that changed.” No, no, NO. He couldn't say things like that. Not like this. Not now.
It was an unusual romance, one that no one had seen coming, One that he hadn't even seen coming. But now that he had it, now that it existed, he found himself never wanting to let it go.
If that was the case, then just where were the Slytherins? He needed to find Crabbe and Goyle. He’d tried to call them Greg and Vincent for a while, but he’d failed. It was just too weird. Anyways, he needed them. He needed some sort of protection. That may sound a little selfish, but really, it was just strategic thinking. It’s safer to stick with a crowd than travel on one’s own, especially during a battle like this. It may appear to be narrow minded, but Draco didn’t care. He’d rather be selfish and live, then be foolish and perish.
He took a breath of relief, sealing away the last letter that he would ever write. It was as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Draco still hadn’t made a decision, but he knew that he was one step closer to making the right one.
Once the hour was almost up, Draco made it his mission to pack away his things and get away from Weasley and Potter as quickly as possible. Just as he was about to escape to freedom, a wave of a hand stopped him in his tracks.
Draco shook his head. “It’s okay. It’s okay.” He repeated. “I forgive you.” He said earnestly. Potter opened his mouth to protest, but Draco silenced him with a kiss, one full of tenderness and forgiveness. “I forgive you. So, please take me. I need this. I need you.”
Okay, so just maybe Draco had taken things a little too far. But wasn't that the point of life? To push boundaries that were meant to remain fixed. As far as he was concerned, his comments were a gift to society.
“Are you feeling alright, Draco?” Theo asked and Draco nodded. Things were still a bit uncomfortable between them, but he knew that despite everything, they’d always remain friends.
Honestly, Draco secretly agreed with her. What in Merlin's name had convinced him to let his best friends on his little task. They were scaring the victims for fuck sake!
As he made his way back to the Slytherin dungeons cautiously so he wouldn’t get caught, he decided that Potter
He watched in concern as Potter took a deep breath, his eyes shifting slightly to Draco’s neck. “I went to see your father.” He admitted softly.
He slammed his hands to his side in annoyance. “I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” Draco cut in.
Potter’s eyes flashed with hurt before turning to stone. “You’re choosing him over me?” he said slowly.
He shook his head, “Not particularly. I was just wondering as to why you’re sitting here, especially when there’s lots of other free tables.” he gestured to the tables around them, not quite sure as to Granger wanted to sit with him of all people.
“That’s right.” she squeezed his hand tightly. “So please darling, tell me who’s broken the heart that I took so long to make.”
It was his turn now. It was up to him to make sure his mother felt as safe as she’d always made him.
Potter tore off his shirt, tweaking on one of Draco’s nipples which earns him a loud moan full of desperate need. “I know just how sensitive you nipples are.”
She gazed at him longingly. “But would I ever change him? Never.” She finished and there was no doubt in Draco's mind that this was a girl in love.
concern.” She bit out. “Anyways, I was here first, so do us both a favour and get the fuck out.” She snarled.
He had to stay calm. He had to get to Potter. After he knew that Potter was safe, he’d deal with her. He’d deal with her so good.
“Sev, I’m going to be honest with you.” He started and Severus narrowed his eyes, willing him to continue. “You really need to get laid.” He bit out with a smirk.
He sneaked a peak below him, and sure enough, Crabbe was following him up the stack and he figured that Goyle was climbing up the mound beside him. They’d be okay, he thought briefly.
The first thing that Draco noticed about Azkaban was that it was cold. Although it was only the end of the summer, it felt as if it were the middle of winter!
Draco was making his way towards the Slytherin dungeons. He had managed to ditch Pansy and Blaise after dinner claiming that he had to talk to Professor Snape about something. The two had probably thought that he was going to talk to Snape about his task set by the Dark Lord. Merlin, if that’s what they wanted to believe, he sure as hell wasn’t going to correct them. They thought he was still a deep follower of the Dark Lord, eager to carry out his task and he got a little bit of privacy. It was as good as Draco was going to get.
Blaise nodded, his eyes welling up with rare tears. “If we don’t fight then we have nothing. If we don’t first survive then we can’t live. If we don’t hate then we can’t love. If we only feel fear then we can’t feel hope.” He looked into Draco’s eyes pleadingly. “And
With shaky hands he picked up the necklace, storing it safely away in a velvet box. He took a deep breath; it was now or never. He slowly muttered a curse, the darkness of it blinding what lightness was left within him.
She nodded frantically. “Oh, yeeesssss.” She hissed. “Haven’t you wondered just why you were able to complete your task? Why you didn’t chicken out?” she asked him, her eyes gleaming. “I know you Draco. I know that you didn’t want to do it. That you were never going to fully go through with it. So, I gave you a little bit of a push…”
She shook her head. “If you think I’m going to tell you that, then you’re absolutely barmy.” She said.
She gave his shoulder a quick squeeze. “Oh darling, what can I do?” she urged, and Draco couldn't let her. He wouldn't let her get caught up in all of this.
He shot her an unappreciative glance. “What?” he bit back. He knew that he was being unfair, but he'd couldn't bring himself to care in that moment.
He shook his head. “Yes, he is. He still loves a man who is a follower of He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.” he hissed his tone of the verge of becoming vengeful.
Harry opened his mouth to speak but Draco shook his head. “I’d forgotten everything. I’d forgotten our talks, our hugs, our
He didn’t want to do this. He wanted to carry on pretending that it was all a dream. That it had never happened. But he couldn’t do that. This was a nightmare, and the only option was to face it and wake up. And Draco wanted to wake up so desperately.
“It’s obvious that you want to do something awful to her. What would Draco sodding Malfoy want with a Muggleborn first year? You won’t get away with it, you git. I’ll make sure of it.”
He was still a danger to Harry. A danger to his life and the whole wizarding world. He had to protect him. He had to keep him safe. No matter the cost.
Well, they had to have been if the downright hellish riddles Theo had seemed to have adapted was anything to go by.
A cheery voice perked up. “So, Draco, when do you need this all done by?” Kat supplied helpfully, and Draco loved her.
Draco didn’t know for how long he’d ran, but he came to a stop inside a little alcove. He pressed up against the wall, with the intention of catching his breath. He was slowly coming to the opinion that maybe having that extra sausage at breakfast hadn’t been one of his brightest moments.
He felt something close to dread as he looked at the station that was slowly coming into view. He checked his watch.
It seemed as though Potter could do whatever he liked to Draco, and he was powerless against him. He didn't know exactly, what it was about Potter that made Draco act like this, but he decided that he didn't really want to find out.
He was deeply engaged with his work when he felt a new presence in front of him. Hufflepuff's! It had to be the Hufflepuff's.
Did he really have the right to question Draco on his actions. His name was Slughorn. Slug-horn. It sounded like something that came out of his asshole when he took a dump. Completely unflattering and tremendously vulgar.
Draco chuckled and Blaise gave him a contemplative look, “No seriously, my hands are a work of art!” he preened proudly and Draco mentally hit his head against the wall. Numerous times.
to receive my call?” he asked carefully, and Draco knew that his father was giving him a chance to redeem himself.
As he stood behind a grieving mother, he realised that he had been selfish. He hadn’t just lost a best friend; a mother had lost a daughter. And his actions had resulted in her struggle going on for that just little bit longer. If anything were to happen to him, he wouldn’t want his death to be withheld from his mother. So, who was he to have done that to somebody else?
Macmillan’s cheeks reddened. “Sorry.” He muttered, as he gave Draco what he deemed a pure excuse of a smile.
“So, we’ve decided that the Draco Malfoy Pride can be a group where everyone is accepted and loved. A group that is also led by the man who sacrificed everything so that we could live. The pride is somewhere where we can all be safe. I thought
Severus nodded with approval and Draco made his was towards the door. “Draco.” Severus called out just as he was about to leave.
A bloody and isolated place. There were no friends in war, just enemies. It was full of chaos and destruction. Gore and death. It wasn’t the place for an innocent.
“No, no, no. You don’t understand. I’ve done something bad. I’m going to do something bad.” He choked out, gasping deeply for air.
She chuckled. “You’ll never kill me.” She snarled before disappearing into a cloud of smoke, leaving him alone.
Draco felt a single tear roll down his cheek as he pulled her closer, hoping that the moment never had to end.
There was no other explanation. He had died and had ended up in hell and was currently undergoing deep torture. It was unexpected, Draco decided. He’d always believed that once he’d died and descend into hell, he’d be sitting on a throne. Instead, he was seated in an uncomfortable wooden chair in the Headmaster’s office. What a peculiar change of events.
Draco’s eyes filled with fresh tears as he gave her a warm smile. “You make me happy. You make me so, so happy.” He cried out and she beamed as she disappeared in a flash of green light.
Pansy shot him a sad look. “I know you don’t. But you should. One of you is going to end up seriously hurt and I’ll bet my last Knut that it’ll be you.” She attempted.
Draco edged closer towards his father’s cell as his father grabbed his hands through the bars, pulling him closer so that their foreheads were touching. “If what you and Potter have is even half of what your mother and I have, then Potter will come back to you. I promise.” He assured him, and for the first time Draco felt convinced.
Blaise snorted. “Your bitterness wounds me Draco.” He joked. “My optimism is leaking out.” He howled, clutching his heart as if in pain.
That’s exactly what he would do. He thought with determination, before exiting the room of requirement in search of some breakfast.
Today was a day he’d always known was coming but didn’t quite want to believe to be true. He had been living in denial. Well, not anymore. The biggest battle to ever grace the wizarding world was presumably happening at Hogwarts, and Draco was stuck at the Manor.
Draco chuckled. “I’m as well as a guy that almost bled to death can be I suppose.” He joked. Seriously? What was
The Weasley twin laughed, “I’ve missed you Malfoy. Harry has too. He’s been a complete mess after you rescued them back at the end of your sixth year.” He mused.
Pansy glared at him, “oh, shut up about your Hufflepuff's for a second.” She snarled. “you banging on like a wounded puppy isn’t helping anything.”
“Draco.” Came his mother’s concerned voice, and he realised that he had ended up in one of the manor’s many parlour’s. “Come here Dragon.” She urged gently, opening her arms wide in welcome.
“Did your parents divorce?” she questioned innocently. “My parents divorced a year ago and it made me cry.” She started and Draco gave her a sad look.
Draco nodded. “Yes, it appears that I am.” He answered solemnly, feeling a void in the pits of his stomach.
He’d forgiven his father. There had been no other option. Forgiveness wasn’t the trait of the weak, but an attribute of the strong. Draco had been given a chance, one to create a new beginning. And forgiveness, he mused, that was the only way that he’d truly be free.
Kat started to cry hot, wet, tears. “No, I don’t want to see you later. I want to see you now.” she wailed, pulling him into a hard hug.
He felt conflicted. Obviously this was more personal to Potter than he would ever know. To think that he hurt someone like this. That
“Malfoy!” the voice yelled again, louder, and angrier this time. Draco continued to go on his merry little way.
Draco didn’t trust himself to say anything. Because she was a little bit of an idiot. Okay, she was a lot of an idiot. She looked like one too.
“Hello Draco.” Luna chirped as he sat down next to her. She looked better than she had a few days ago, brighter, fuller even.
Draco smiled. “Well, you know how it is, the Puffs and I are a package deal. If you can’t accept my Hufflepuff’s then you can’t accept me.” He joked.
With all the strength that he could possibly muster, Draco held his wand up high, looking Potter straight into his blazing green eyes. Potter gave him a small smile, one that he knew was only reserved for him. A silent smile, one that said so little, but meant so much. It was all Draco needed. He nodded his head, and Potter fired the first hex.
Draco abruptly pulled from, her embrace. “I have too..” he started eyes wide with fear and determination.
He shook his head, “but Draco don’t you realise? Nothing you could say, do, or write would change my mind about being with you.” He almost pleaded.
Potter’s eyes shone with tears, “I don’t know what to say, no one has ever done anything like this for me before.” He said through tears. “Thank you, thank you so much.” He cried and Draco grimaced, Potter shouldn’t be thanking him just yet, he thought as he gestured to the second sheet of paper.
The bloody nerve of him! Did he really think that he could sit there in his dingy little prison cell and still tell Draco what to do. It was completely preposterous.
Draco groaned. “Alright, you annoying little cretin. I’ll show you a few. And I mean a few.” He resolved.
Draco was so tired of thinking. What his mother had just told him had taken up so much of his thinking energy. It was all just making this whole thing harder. In fact, everyone who’d gotten involved had done nothing but make things more complicated for him.
Suddenly, his aunt shrieked, frantically running towards them. Draco made a split-second decision, pushing Potter onto Weasley. “NOW!” he screamed at the house elf who apparated.
He heaved himself up and tutted as his mother muttered a cleaning spell. “Well, if I wasn’t before then I am now.” he bit out sarcastically as his mother came to sit next to him.
She reached over, placing a hand atop of his. His eyes flew up, shocked at the action. Her hand was warm, it didn’t ignite butterflies in his stomach like Potter, but it was nice, nevertheless.
Draco rolled his eyes, “hunting hippogriffs” he bit out sarcastically and both boys glared. “What the fuck you
He ran through the manor, without a care of where he was going or who was going to see him. He needed this. He just needed to escape it all, just for a little while.
He glanced at the excited first years. Them all so naïve, almost ignorant to some of the pained faces around them. They just saw Hogwarts for what it was. Not a place of blood, death, and battle, but a place that many went to learn, to smile, a place that we could all call
“Very good, very good. Now if you don’t mind I’m tired and would like to put my feet up.” He said quickly before sidestepping Macmillan and entering the Slytherin common room.
Draco nodded, pulling the portkey from his pocket. “I can’t explain there’s not enough time.” He held out the portkey. “I need you to take it.”
to be kidding him. He was done. He was so, so done. “So, you can speak to her. But can ignore me for three fucking hours!” he exclaimed in frustration.
Their tongues swirled around each other in a perfect harmony. Hard but sweet, fighting for dominance. Draco felt like he was flying. Like there wasn’t anything but Potter. He felt safe. Secure. Alive in a bound of passion. Potter had his heart. His soul. And it scared him.
His father’s eyes lit up as soon as he saw him, which made Draco flush all over. Hearing that his father cared deeply about him was one thing, but seeing it, that was another thing altogether.
Kat and the girls were all looking up at the boy in fear. “People do dangerous things for the ones they love.” He concluded and Draco couldn’t speak.
“Well, Draco, since you’re acting like an antisocial dim whit and refusing to accept any Christmas invitations, I’m staying here.” He proclaimed, scooting closer towards Draco.
He felt the need to defend Potter. It was as much Draco's fault than it was his. After all, Draco was the one who had played with Draco's emotions resulting in this mess.
The boy turned a shade of Weasley red. “I was just wondering if I could talk to you about something?” he stuttered out and Draco realised that the boy was scared of Draco.
It’s not that he didn’t like it when his hair was slicked back, it was more that he absolutely hated it. He looked more like his father, pointy and unapproachable. It’s not like Draco wanted to necessarily seem all that approachable, but judging by his little Hufflepuff fan club, it wouldn’t make that much of a difference.
Blaise smiled. “In that case, there’s a couple of Gryffindor’s waiting outside for you. They said it was important.” He informed and Draco nodded.
He shrugged. “Maybe they believe everything I tell them because I’m always right.” he winced hating what he’d said the moment it had left his mouth.
He could swear that his father’s face had turned red amongst all the green. “A puppet?” he drawled. “What are you talking about?” he asked him, and Draco didn't see what was so hard to understand.
Draco chuckled. “Then lead the way, fair maiden.” He joked, offering her a little bow as they fell into a comfortable silence.
He nodded. “Oh yes, I forgot how helpless muggles were. Poor people.” He commented suddenly feeling quite sorry for the muggles incompetence.
Slowly, Draco opened the gift bag to find six neatly wrapped presents. His eyes widened in shock, what had she done?
“It feels like I’m barely alive, as if I’m in between existence and death.” He started, tears spilling down his cheeks. “I look at you and I feel so much. I have all these fucking feelings that I don’t remember ever developing. I’ve always known you as my arch nemesis, as the guy who rejected me all these years ago. But now that’s different. You’re still my enemy, but ever since the beginning of seventh year, you’ve meant more to me than anyone else ever has.” He admitted.
He gulped, willing himself to be dragged into a sleep which he would never wake from. “You were different. More subdued. You didn’t fight with me. You didn’t pick on me. You didn’t even call me names. You just ignored me. As if I wasn’t good enough to be a part of you life. That hurt.”
Suddenly, he heard Crabbe scream. Screw that. He had a friend to save. Frantically, he ran back towards the fire, ignoring the pleading screams that Potter sent his way.
They both nodded their heads in understanding. “I’m sorry for what happened to you in Hogsmeade mate.” Weasley supplied. looking quite ashamed.
In a spilt second, he felt strong arms pull on his own, lifting him up and seating him firmly onto the broomstick below him. Draco opened his eyes to the sight of the back of Harry Potter’s head.
“Make sure that my funeral is prestige and honourable.” He said hopefully, “I want the best of the best. My robes will be flawless, my corpse will smell like bloody roses.” He heaved, “And you will
He listened to Potter Watch every day. It was foolish of him, he knew that. But he couldn’t help it. He had to know if everything was okay. If Weasley and Hermione was okay. If Potter was okay…
He gave her an embarrassed look, “I’m sorry for breaking down like that.” He apologised authentically.
She couldn't help him. But he was so tired off the lying, of the deceit, he had to tell someone. He had to
After what seemed like a lifetime, they finally landed roughly just outside the room. Draco didn’t even have time to gather his bearings before someone shouted ‘Stupefy!’ and his whole world went black.
“What do you mean I’m not happy?” he questioned, part of him already knowing the answer, but not being brave enough to admit it.
“I know that I don’t deserve you. But you make me want to become a better person. To be the person that I know I can be. Someone I can love. Someone I can look up to. I want to be someone who stands up for what he believes in. Someone who’s not scared to do the right thing. I want to be that person. I wish more than anything, that I were that person.” Potter read, his voice starting to waver.
He sighed, slamming the door behind them, and leant against the frame. He loved his Hufflepuff’s he really did. It was just
Draco shook his head, not being able to tear his gaze from the tainted spot before him. “But there was a choice, and I’d chosen the wrong one.” He countered, feeling shame wash over him.
Kat shook her head, with strong force. “Not that good?” she questioned, “Draco, they’re so wonderful.” She proclaimed, slowly turning the pages of his sketchbook, her hand stopped on a portrait of his mother.
It was quiet. It was all so quiet; you couldn’t even hear a pin drop. The air was dusty, filled with a thick layer of melancholy. Draco had never truly understood what it meant to see everything in grey, he couldn’t comprehend how one could cease to see colour. He understood now. He wished that he didn’t, but he did.
He took a shaky breath. “It’s Lavender Brown.” He said more clearly. And wow, for the umpteenth time, Macmillan had surprised him.
Draco pursed his lips sheepishly, “I can’t say I was. Sorry, I was uhm distracted.” He said honestly.
He mocked laughed at her. “I want you two to bloody acknowledge what you’ve done. To realise how good everything was before you intervened. To see how badly, you’ve both messed this up.” He choked out.
It felt right. Potter was giving his all, kissing Draco with all the passion that he could muster, and Draco couldn’t help but kiss him back. He needed this. Even if it was just for a moment. He needed Potter.
Snape shook his head, “This isn’t up for discussion.” He snarled before exiting the hall in a fit of robes, gesturing for Draco to follow.
Draco put his pencil to the soft parchment, willing himself to draw something. Anything. It had to be happy not sad. Be full of emotion, not void. He let out a harsh cry. Why wasn’t it working? Why was he so messed up?
Draco held her tight. “Well you’re the kindest, sweetest most beautiful person I’ve ever met, and I’m happy to call you my best friend.” He answered.
He shook his head. “It’s not the same. It’s not the same. Can’t you see?” He cried out. “I have to protect her. I have to protect her.” he choked out repeatedly for good measure.
Draco was outside on the school grounds, the Death Eater’s running manically in front of him. Victory dusting every last one of their features.
A small cough came from the teachers table. “Harry, my boy.” Dumbledore started, and Potter whipped his head round to face him, a stony look on his face.
Weasley? That was hilarious, he had to bite his tongue to stop him from bursting out into a fit of laughter, there and then.
Draco glared at her. “I said no before and I’m saying no now. In fact, I’ll continue to say no till the end of time.” He answered simply, and her face fell.
“You act like you’re fine. You laugh when you need to. You smile at myself and my friends.” She started. “You act like you’re happy. But you’re not. I know that you’re not.” She finished.
As he walked down the steps lost in a whirl of his own thoughts, he realised that was the first time in a really first time he’d felt anything other that sadness.
Neville had revealed Draco’s killing of the renowned Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, slightly exaggerating that Draco’s actions had saved his life.
She cried. Pulling him into another embrace. They stayed like that for several minutes, seeking comfort in one another before Draco pulled away.
“Hey!” he shouted. “it appears that the fact that I almost died a few days ago has escaped your notice. I’m weak.” Draco glowered at Severus as if wanting to rip his throat out.
Weasley rolled his eyes. “Oh, ha bloody ha Malfoy. A chicken date is not something to be joked about.” He gazed into the distance dreamily. “Biting into that juicy, succulent chicken breast, your mouth full of it’s juices. Oh yes, that’s heaven.” He breathed.
Potter smiled putting his arms around Draco, “don’t get mad” he started hesitantly and Draco glared at him, this couldn’t be good. “but I may or may not have accepted Mrs Weasley’s Christmas dinner invitation on your behalf.” He stammered out and Draco hit him.
“Draco?” A hesitant voice asked in almost disbelief. Draco’s breath hitched as he took in the deep green eyes of Harry Potter.
He’d saved her. He’d saved her, just like he should’ve saved Kat. He may have protected one innocent, but he’d failed to protect the one innocent that meant more to him than he could ever express. Something about that deeply unsettled him. It was something that he didn’t think he’d ever get over.
“I’m not proposing.” Potter started nervously, “Well, not yet anyways.” He chuckled picking the ring up from it’s box. “I charmed the ring, with Hermione’s help, but it was mostly all me.” He stumbled out. “It carries my magical signature, so wherever you go, if you feel happy, scared, or sad, I’ll always be there.” He murmured clasping the necklace around Draco’s neck.
Draco reverted his attention back onto the quivering girl. “I know we sound like complete idiots, but you have to trust us.” He pleaded.
Pomfrey sighed in defeat, “Fine, you may leave. But don’t let me see you in this hospital ward again anytime soon.” she warned.
Draco sighed. “I guess now that I’ve had a taste of death, I find it terribly addicting.” he sarcastically said. What the
How could she say that? How could she lie like that? Was it meant to reassure him, or make him feel better? Well, it didn't. No, he just felt worse.
Draco felt suddenly on edge. It had been weeks since he’d last heard from him mother. With shaky hands, he reached out and pulled the letter from her beak, only stopping to give her a scratch behind her ears.
Was it terrible that he didn’t exactly want to tell her? It was embarrassing. That Draco Malfoy was caught up on the Chosen One. That loving Harry Potter had reduced him to nothing but a blabbering mess.
What wasn't clicking? What part of this didn't she understand. He wanted to hate him. He so desperately wanted to hate him. But he could never. He
you Malfoy. Why do this? Why hurt these people? Why make me feel this way just to do this. Was it all a game?” he whispered the last part brokenly.
Pansy reached over, picking up a triangular cucumber sandwich and stuffing it into her mouth. “You and I both know that’s not true.” She said through mouthfuls of crumbs.
“You didn’t stay to watch the sunrise.” He bit out with a hint of sadness. Draco looked at the ground. Rub it in Potter! Make him feel worse than he already did.
Draco’s eyes widened. “I said go.” He repeated, urging Potter to listen to him. Why didn't Potter just listen to him? He could save them
It was just all to fucking much. Why was it all to much? So, Potter really wanted to know? Well, Draco would tell him. He'd bare it all!
It wasn't so much that he didn't want to share his artwork more than he was certain that he wasn't very good at it. Art was his sanctuary, it was a place where he could express himself and not be judged. Showing someone... well, that ruined everything.
So, instead of looking at Potter. Instead of facing him like he knew Potter deserved. He did the only thing he could do. The only thing a coward would do.
thing to do. He didn’t remember his time with Potter, he didn’t remember what he said or didn’t say. What he admitted or didn’t admit. By giving Potter the letters, he was disclosing the person that he once was, and was offering the person that he hoped to be.
She looked up at him with pleading eyes once he had finished. “Does Potter know?” she asked hesitantly.
Anyways, she’d bend down, her elegant robes flowing, and pull him into a giant hug, softly raking her hands through his hair. She made him feel safe, secure, loved. They’d just lie there, in each other’s arms for Merlin knows how long.
Draco stood up to face the baffled eyes of Ronald Weasley. “Not a word.” Draco threatened and Weasley nodded before they made their way into the classroom.
Weasley released him and sat back down. “So, don’t you dare tell me that it’s just chicken. And if Harry were here then he’d agree with me.” He finished with a smug grin.
He had to get out of here. Perhaps come back another day with Vincent and Greg as lookouts. Partially so they could be on the watch for any curious do-gooders. Mainly because at least they’d be there to find him if all the crazy ate his brain.
Had Blaise maybe taken into account the possibility that Draco simply didn't want to tell him anything. That he wasn't at liberty to say anything. If he didn't want to date Theo, then he didn't have to. No questions asked.
Draco glared at him. “That’s a whole load of bollocks!” and Potter chuckles and tweaks his nipples once more and Draco groans, arching up against him. “You were saying…” he raised a brow cockily.
“Then if you don’t mind, we were kind of in the middle of something.” Theo said gesturing between himself and Draco.
It was all too much. Far, far too much. Draco felt his throat close up, he was gasping for breath. Grabbing for life.
Draco took a deep tired breath. “So, what is it that you want, Macmillan?” he asked distractedly, looking to see if someone,
Potter edged closer towards him. “I can’t figure you out. Not anymore.” He seethed. “I used to know you so well. I knew what you always ate for breakfast. I knew what friends you had. I knew your favourite hairstyle. I knew that you were a selfish, arrogant, attention-seeking, git.” He looked at Draco expectantly. Draco remained quiet. Potter wasn’t saying anything he didn’t already think or used to do.
He looked up into the blazing green eyes of Harry Potter. Hermione and Weasley were stood behind him, unreadable looks dusting their features. “Potter.” He sobbed out.
Blaise smiled. “The Hufflepuff’s went crazy. They started an actual coup demanding to know who would dare harm their Draco like that.” Draco felt an odd warmness course through his body.
Hermione chuckled. “Who knew Hufflepuff first-years could be so daunting.” She commented and Draco froze. Ah! Her first mistake
Draco flipped them off. “That is none of your business.” He informed them whilst mentally reminding himself to ask Potter about a potential Daddy kink.
Draco looked up and gathered all the strength he had left. “Then wait for me.” He urged Potter. “I know what we have is real. I can feel it. I don’t think that I could live the rest of my life with anyone else who wasn’t you. But we can’t be together. Not yet. Not like this.” He finally admitted, because it was true.
Draco heaved dramatically, “are my wounds healed?” She nodded. “Am I functioning like a bloody human being?” She nodded. “Am I fucking dying.”
With one last glance at the poison that stained his hands like a scar, he walked out the door. The last shred of his innocence left behind in the room as he descended the path to destruction.
He shrugged. “Maybe I’ve always been nice to my friends, you’ve just never taken the time to notice.” He bit back defiantly.
It was the day. Potter wasn’t supposed to be nice to him during the day. The touches felt like fireworks on his skin. The attention was something he craved.
“SHUT THE FUCK UP!” Draco screamed jumping to his feet, ignoring the startled looks he was receiving. “IT’S JUST CHICKEN FOR MERLIN’S SAKE!” he screamed again, as Weasley rounded on him in a blink of an eye.
Draco nodded, still immersed in his investigating. “Yes, the bread.” He answered with disinterest, “it’s called a toasterer.” He added.
She narrowed her eyes at him. “Nice try.” She started. “What I’d like to do is leave. So, if you excuse me.” She tried to move but Blaise shot a sticking charm at her.
Abruptly, Draco pulled away to catch his breath. He gazed up into lust filled green eyes. They brimmed with much unsaid emotion. Draco’s heart was beating rapidly in his chest. He’d never felt like this. He didn’t think he could ever feel like this with anyone else other than Potter.
“Just wouldn’t it.” Draco said a little to honestly and Potter gave him an odd glance which he promptly ignored.
He started to chuckle. Then he started to laugh, loud and vibrant. Then finally, he started to wheeze. “I’m sorry—” he started through puffs of laughter.
He had hope that he was strong. He had hope that everything would be okay. He had hope to carry on. He had hope in life. He had hope in
He's not crazy! Was he actually that idiotic? That's exactly what a crazy person would say. He decided that wasn't far from the truth either. He
Weasley looked around confused. “I don’t see an elephant.” he answered and Draco tried so hard not to laugh. Was Weasley actually being serious?
He huffed impatiently, “what is it that you want Theo? Do I need to remind you that I’m a very busy man?” he told him.
Theo pulled back the covers, patting the spot next to him for Draco to slide in. Carefully Draco, slipped in beside him as Theo, pulled the covers up to submerge them with warmth.
It all suddenly became too hot. Draco was sweating far too much for comfort. He needed to leave. He needed to get breakfast.
Damn it! Severus and his stupid questions, and his stupid suspicions. Couldn't the man learn to trust once in a while? Honestly, maybe if he had, he wouldn't have nearly as many grey hairs.
He blinked back the tears. “Yes well, I have one and they need help on their project, so I’m bloody well helping them. Problem?” he sneered at the boy.
Suddenly it hit him, the dungeons! It was one of the last places people would think to go. He smiled slightly before making his way towards the dungeon, deflecting, and ducking from curses that threatened his path.
He felt his eyes swell with tears for the seventh time. He wanted it with Potter. He wanted to have it all with Potter. He knew how he felt. He was definite that he wouldn’t feel like this unless what he had with Potter was the real thing. But that wasn’t enough. He felt as if a part of him was missing, and he wouldn’t be able to fully give himself to Potter without finding it.
“In fact,” Weasley carried on, stepping closer towards Draco, “if you wouldn’t mind, I’ll just...” He snatched a drumstick from Draco’s hands, sinking his teeth into the juicy chicken flesh.
Draco kept on walking; the battle was still going on with full force. He was blocking and shooting hexes at every turn, as he made his way through the destruction.
He let out a dramatic sigh. “Not saying that I forgive you, because forgiveness is something that has to be earned.” He started. “But where is your little leader Smith?” he enquired.
Draco took a quick glance at the man cuddled next to him and felt a sinking feeling in the pits of his stomach. He knew what he wanted to do. Of what he had to do.
“Quite sure, yes. Anyways, this is the hardest and strongest potion on the list. If brewed correctly, we’re guaranteed an O.” he declared in triumph.
Tears started to fall freely from his eyes. “I thought you were dead. We were all told to prepare for the worst. I’ve never been more afraid.” She babbled.
“Well, you don’t talk much. You're friends with Hufflepuff's and, you don’t insult any of us much anymore.” he told him, and Draco slightly agreed.
She looked up at him with wide, teary eyes, “I’m sorry, I just wanted to help.” She sobbed and Draco’s features softened.
He sighed before stepping away from Draco, “this is the person that you are without the manipulation, without the lies nor the deceit.” Theo gave Draco one last glance, “this is the person who you were before the world told you who you should be.” He whispered those few, parting words, before making his exit.
Draco sighed. He loved him. He loved him so much. He loved his unwillingness to give up. He loved his smile. He loved his ambition. He loved everything about him. He just loved
He inclined his head slightly to face the Headmaster. He stood tall and proud. His features twisted into a mixture of kindness and sheer determination. Draco shook his head slightly, the Headmaster may have had everybody else fooled, but he couldn’t fool him. Draco knew better. He saw the slight shake to the Headmaster’s stance. The concern upon his raised brow, the fear in his glossy eyes. After all, how could he not notice such things that he had become so well acquainted with?
Draco didn’t give her a chance to finish her sentence before whispering Imperio the word felt dirty in his mouth. And as her eyes slowly turned void, Draco felt the last of his innocence slipping away.
“Nicely done.” Blaise smirked at him. “Nice to know that you’re still a sly Slytherin and Potter’s Gryffindor hasn’t rubbed off on you.” he told him proudly.
Draco shook his head. “It’s alright Myrtle. It’s okay.” He reassured the quivering girl, before turning his attention back on Potter.
chicken when I brought you two drumsticks out of the goodness of my heart when you were stuck in hospital?” he asked.
He was sick of hearing those two words. The two words that had torn his life from him, that had turned him into a monster that he had never asked to be. He had
Draco was sitting in front of the Great Lake that same very evening. He had his sketchbook on his lap and a pencil in his hand. It was a beautiful night he mused. Quiet and peaceful, just how he liked it.
He didn’t know how he thought it would feel to have another person’s tongue inside his mouth. To have someone explore you, to take care of you, to devour you – but he’d never thought that it would feel like this. His kisses were confident and long, determined but awfully refined. He feels like he was melting, as if he were slowly loosing himself in Potter’s heat. Potter brings one hand against Draco’s chest and used the other to cup the back of his head, and Draco groans into his mouth, low and hungry.
Of course, this thing with Potter hadn’t got any less confusing. He continued to meet Potter every night at the Great Lake, watching the stars until they were hidden by the sun. Potter told him his biggest secrets, his deepest fears, what made him happy and what made him sad. They never spoke of the Weaselette incident.
Draco was making his way towards the library, quite speedily in fact. Although, not too speedily mind you, because a Malfoy must be nothing but calm and collected.
Tears were falling freely from his eyes now; Draco slowly lowered his wand. “I don’t want your help!” he bit out. “Don’t you understand? I have to do this. I have to kill you.” He pleased desperately. “Or he’s going to kill me…”
him. Draco Malfoy. The Slytherin Ice Prince. The Bully. The Death Eater. And Harry Potter was in love with him.
“My problem?” he bit out incredulously. “My problem is that you refuse to fucking talk to me like a human being.” He snapped.
He attempted to make her see reason. “But the Muggleborn’s.” he started. “I can’t help them. I’ve tried, but I can’t deliver the portkey’s there’s not enough time.” He sniffed, how low his odds were finally sinking in.
She laughed, “no need for the pleasantries, we’re family. It’s about time we met.” She gave him a wide grin, “and this is Teddy.” She gestured to the small child, who waved shyly, his little eyes sparkling. “He’s a little tired right now, but I can already tell that he likes you. He doesn’t wave for just anyone, you know.” She remarked.He felt his cheeks growing warm at the statement, “well, I think I like you too.” He said lovingly at Teddy who gave him a huge smile in return.
Draco blinked. He was actually pretty content to watch their petty argument. It served for some great entertainment.
The boy frantically shook his head. “No, she’s okay.” He assured him, “well I think that she’s okay, do you think anything’s happened to her?” he cried out.
Draco’s eyes started to tear up. To hear his father, say these things to him. For his father to act like somewhat of a human being, was all he’d ever wanted. It was what he deserved to hear.
It wasn’t meant to be a constant thing. Just a few scattered meals here and there. Nothing much, nothing special. But after the sheer relief he saw on the Manor’s prisoner’s faces, he knew deep down that he’d never be able to stop.
He shook his head violently. “The only thing that’s dramatic is you thinking that I’m dramatic.” He stumbled.
He took a deep breath as he faced his father, putting his hands safely into his robe pockets. His father looked well considering. His hair was a little longer, but was still prestige, nevertheless. His pale skin was lighter but not sickly. His eyes were sunken but still twinkled with light. All and all, Draco was quite pleased to see his father as close to healthy as he could possibly be whilst in Azkaban.
“Yes, yes. I get it. But all I’m hearing is that I was beyond awesome but still got dumped with you dramatic gits as friends.” He brushed them off.
Severus growled. “Don’t give me your cheek, you idiotic boy. Don’t you understand the severity of your actions?” he questioned, glaring daggers at him.
Mr Weasley perked up. “A toasterer you say?” Draco nodded. “I wonder if you’ve ever heard of a rubber duck. Remarkable things.” He commented and Draco’s eyes widened with glee.
Smith screeched and Draco smiled. “Be your own man!” Draco jeered. “Be the happy Hufflepuff I know you to be.”
“There you bloody well are!” Weasley exclaimed as Draco entered the classroom. “I thought that your Hufflepuff fan club had kidnapped you of something.” He added.
Potter gave Draco a long kiss before rising to his feet. “You’re adorable.” He smirked and Draco frowned. “Anyways, lets head up to Dumbledore’s floo or else we’re going to be late.”
Draco had no words to describe how good the shower had been. Potter’s hands were just… well, a gentleman never tells.
He crumpled to the ground, feeling as if a part of his soul had been ripped out. Kat was gone, but it wasn’t over yet.
Weasley took a scared breath, “we really have to go. Come on!” he yelled as he took the house elf’s hand, Hermione following suit.
Instead, he just held her close. It wasn’t about him. Not anymore. In his arms, he held the woman that laughed at his jokes. Who’d attempted to make him cookies when he was sad. The woman has always and will always love him unconditionally.
His father looked down at him thoughtfully as he unknowingly played with a few strands of his long locks. “Looked to me as if you had
That was it! He couldn’t take it anymore. He was sick of feeling like this. He was sick of being so confused. It had to stop. He wanted it all to stop. “Together? There is no together.” He shouted at a silenced Potter. “Don’t you see? Can’t you see? I can’t remember. I can’t fucking remember.” He cried out, tears forming at the crests of his eyes.
He took a deep breath remembering something that his mother had told him long ago, 'If you don't sacrifice for what you want, what you want will be the sacrifice.' He hadn't understood her then, but now as he thought about it he realised her words couldn't be anymore true.
Free to be himself. Free to laugh. Free to smile. Free to love. He was free to be everything he had always know himself to be. For the first time, in a long time, there was nothing blocking his path. He was loved, he was safe, he was accepted. He was
Draco chuckled, “I’ve been to school many a times before, I hardly think that this time will be any different.” He told her confidently.
She cackled. “Silly boy.” She gave him a toothy grin, “don’t you know that sharing is so much better?” She moved closer towards him whilst shooting him a predatory glance, “besides, I think you’ll do quite nicely.”
“You don’t talk much do you Malfoy?” Potter asked and Draco answered him by looking back down at his sketchbook. “It’s weird, not like you.” He commented.
