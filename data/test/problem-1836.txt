“Harry stopped being a child when he saw Lord Voldemort rise from the dead-”
"Oh, yeah," Harry laughed darkly, "We all know how much the Pureblood Prince himself should have been in Slytherin."
There it was.
me," she added and took a long sip.
“I… don’t know,” he admitted, standing up, “But you’re not going to have to do any of that alone. Ron and Hermione will be there too. I’m going to join you as soon as I can.” He added, putting a hand on his arm. Harry swallowed.
“I’m sorry, I’m late.” Draco said as he entered Dumbledore’s office. He set the red quill down in between him and Dumbledore. It was a handy little device, Dumbledore’s quill. Writing something on a paper with the quill would always appear on whatever parchment the other was using and vice versa. It was how they conversed when Draco couldn’t meet for a while.
There. Done. That was that. He tried to numb the stinging in his chest as he retreated down the corridor, taking a few staircases up until he was once more in front of the Eagle gargoyle that led to Dumbledore’s office.
....so....
"We need to go back," he said and the group collectively made a variety of different protests, "
Me: ...
“If he can’t tell us where the traitor is then he’s of no use to us.” Bellatrix said. Draco’s heart sped up. He looked back at the man in front of him. “I know you have an attachment, but he will be a problem.”
books. Possibly another sham of a professor. He hoped at the very least that the Dark Lord wasn’t on the back of this one’s head.
Three.
"You can use Hedwig," he said flatly, "If you go up to the owlery, you might die." He added and turned to where Harriet was sitting on the table next to him. There was a pause where they hissed back and forth before Harry frowned, eyes flicking to Draco.
“She literally was frozen last year. How is that how her greatest fear?”
"I believe you," he said simply and gently pulled his hand off of him to walk down to the courtyard, "But you were still going to go right."
"You know what?" Draco began, but Harry had already pretty much tackled him. The smell of spring was overwhelming his senses again, but he didn't mind it. In a weird way, it almost felt like he could breathe better with it. He squeezed back - even when Harry went to let ago, he only held on to try and somehow convey how much he regretted everything that happened. Harry paused and based on how tightly he squeezed back, he felt similarly.
“Okay, so… Slughorn said he would probably have a Christmas party!” He snapped his fingers, “He’s definitely going to get you a Slug Club membership,” he informed her. Slughorn had most definitely doted on Hermione the second he met her. “So, we ask other people. Maybe, we should even ask people who… might make them jealous.” He suggested. “Well, to make Ron jealous. I know you don’t quite agree with the morality-”
Molly got him another Weasley sweater, which he wore for the rest of the day even if Ron glared at him the entire time (and muttered under his breath about knitting him one with the Dark Mark on it next year). Hermione had hesitantly given him his new cauldron before giving a tense hug. She had also snapped at Harry and Ron to hand over their gifts to him, which admittedly made him feel a smidge better.
"You don't think I can?"
“A... surprise.” He said and then tapped his fingers absently against the table. There was an awkwardness settling over them. Draco decided to change the subject before it got too tense, “Unrelated, but I’ve been meaning to talk to you about… something.” He began. Harry tilted his head. “I just need you to be mature about it.” He warned.
"So?" He finally asked and coughed to clear his throat. Harry grimaced.
“Lily, I am
Ha. Enjoy Christmas.
“Lucius!” She sang, “I have a gift for you!”
"You... are sorted based on...? Nevermind. I wanted to ask you about the guns." He said, nodding to the bag on the ground by him. The man shrugged. "Are those magical guns by chance? Not the ones that spew out metal bullets?" He said and the man frowned at him, "Will they work on wizards?" He clarified.
“Fine,” he said and flicked his wand so Viktor’s name appeared over a pawn. He flicked it again and Fleur’s name appeared over another, “Only because they’ll barely be involved. I just want them at the other end of the portkeys.” He murmured. Ron shrugged. “Alright, who would you take out first?” Draco asked, gesturing to the board. Ron leaned over and considered.
“Oh, come on.” She grumbled whenever Draco kept laughing and tugged him to keep walking.
"Bellatrix knows we're missing," he said, voice taut with worry. A small pop interrupted him. Kreacher sighed. "You're back!"
“…didn’t even do it!” Harry hissed as he hit his bezoar with a little more force than necessary. When it didn’t break he hit it again. And again. Draco was pretty sure the entire potions class was staring. Normally, Hermione was Draco’s partner since they were the only ones who could keep up with another, but given that Ron and Harry were at each other’s throats they decided to switch it up.
“Potter thinks himself apt to snoop around, does he?” He asked and Draco sighed.
Either way, he should be focusing on occlumency with Harry, he knew. Draco just didn’t have the time right now. Even outside of Severus and classes, his semester was pretty packed. You know, with… extra curricular activities.
“She tortured some people. Made them go insane,” he said, voice incredibly tight. “She and her husband spent days using unforgivable curses on him,” he said and swallowed hard. Draco looked at his food for a moment. Yeah… that seemed about right.
. Everyone said they would find out anyways. Harry already knew the dreams were credible. Maybe he should come clean. “And you know what? Maybe I am a little freaked out with you being best friends with bloody
“How was the rest of your Christmas?” He asked, growing quiet as Severus entered the room.
Draco grimaced. Yeah… that really sucked. He reached out and grabbed his arm.
“...when was I not a jerk?”
her. "To have your bones melting and lungs rupture as blood pours from your throat? It makes you want to die, I promise you. You can feel the hole and the air and somehow not being able to breathe isn't even the worst part." He said lowly. There something in Draco - something dark and broken - that whispered for him to do it. After all she did to him? That was
“...Draco Malfoy?”
didn't know what a threesome was-"
“Never ever, ever,
"You're pretty talented for a Death Eater," Harry called lightly and then switched his point attack to send a jinx towards Goyle (who had gotten a smidge too close to Sirius). Sirius, for his part, was still using the knife Draco had let him have to ward off his attackers with a vengeance Draco was a little concerned by. It probably had something to do with Regulus, "Who taught you that reductor curse?"
Dumbledore's permission. In fact, arguably, if Draco had done things his way from the beginning it would have worked out better. It probably wasn't best to voice that though. "My father has made mistakes, I know. But my mother… She hasn’t taken the mark. She never wanted this life. She was born into it. If I don’t at least pretend he’ll kill them both.”
“Hey.” Ron said and snapped his fingers in front of him. “Draco, remember she’s muggleborn. She’s
“Quirrel?” Draco frowned and tilted his head, “Really?”
“Stay the Hell away from me.” He whispered, "You... just stay away from me," he choked out and pushed himself out of the room. There was a loud bang from him knocking something over as he left. The party outside paused for a moment - whispers rising before the music slowly restarted. Draco closed his eyes and sank to the ground. Damnit. He buried his face in his knees. This was… not ideal.
the castle. They were so close. If they could just apparate into the grounds they could do it...
“Why? What was that?” Draco asked and Theo yanked his arm.
"What do you mean he
So. Yeah. To sum it up, Draco’s night wasn’t going great.
“I just don’t…
"No," he said and tried to shove her off of him, "She needs to know - she killed Andromeda and she needs to
"Zoe, what on Earth are you talking about?" He asked. She just looked at him and suddenly something in the back of his mind clicked, "Oh -
Draco couldn’t pay attention to the headmaster’s speech even if he tried. He was already figuring out how he would fix this disaster. He would have to get resorted. Explain that the hat was obviously playing some sort of cruel joke.
I saw no sign of them while we there."
"I am not taking her
“I don’t need your help,” he growled, “I doubt you could anyway. What could a mudblood do?” He snapped and she showed no reaction, only calmly putting down her knife.
“Stop it.”
“We want to see her too!” Ron said fiercely as he yanked at Draco’s robes, “Harry, make him move.” He said and Draco turned around to shove him away again. This time, Ron tripped and fell to the floor. Harry looked down at where Ron was on the ground and then back at Draco.
Either way… he had, well, an unfortunate situation on his hands.
"Yep," Ron told him lightly and rearranged some pieces on the board between them, "And you seem
Regulus said, nodding, "Apologies. I hadn’t realized how much time had passed,” He gave a short laugh “I knew she was pregnant before I... well, nevermind. I'm glad she went with Draco. It was either that or Scorpius and I kept telling her that dragons were more formidable than scorpions." Regulus said with a subtle shrug.
"Fine," he grumbled and looked over, "I've missed you, Prongs," he added softly. "And - oh, Regulus, do you see mom and dad or are they like... in some sort Hell version of the afterlife?" He asked curiously, "Interesting. Well, if you see them, tell them I'm stopping by to spit on their fucking graves - oh, come
“I think you’re lying.” He said brightly and Harry groaned. “What’s wrong Harriet? Was that messy little half-blood being rude to you?” He asked. Hermione rolled her eyes. “...not that him being half-blood is bad or anything.” He added and the snake hissed. “No, he isn’t always like that.”
anything. It was just Ron. Glaring. And Hermione being distracted by whatever she was reading. Harry was just being…Well, Harry.
there was something not quite right with her. Apparently, Millicient had cat hair on her robes, which led to Hermione’s rather… well, feline appearance.
“Your parents are pleased with you then.” Ron said as Draco ran his hand over one of the more expensive robes he had been gifted.
“To be perfectly clear,” He said as he clicked his tongue, “I’m smarter than you.”
He talked for hours. And hours. And hours. About everything on his mind. His parents, Severus, his friends (never to be named, of course), feeling trapped, alone, scared. Not knowing how to deal with Umbridge or how to fix any of the mess he got himself into. Regulus was a surprisingly good listener. He nodded and asked questions in all the right places.
“What is?” Harry asked impatiently. Draco sighed.
“So, you’re the one who had two rooms when he was in there?” He asked. Dudley licked his lips a moment before looking down at the ground. If Draco didn’t know any better he would say that was shame in his expression. Maybe that was his cue. Clearly, Dudley had come to say something to his cousin. He squeezed Harry’s hand once before going out to the front porch.
“Thank you,” he said, eyes turning to Luna completely now with utter adoration, “My mother and I have her eyes too, you know. Everyone thinks banshees have black eyes, but they tend to vary. My grandmother’s were amber.” He said. Luna nodded in approval.
“Hey,” Nymphadora said as she knocked on the doorframe, “Mom says we have to go now. Dad jinxed someone.” She explained. Draco blinked. He what? Ted was a pretty docile wizard. He wanted to ask more on that, but figured time was of the essence. He hopped off the counter as the healer frowned.
I was angry too, but I kind of get it. His parents are awful, but clearly if he wants to keep them safe after all they've done to him... I mean, that must mean something, right? I can't imagine letting my mum and dad die even if they did do all that. Besides, we can’t ignore him forever-”
"I know it hurts," Sirius said a few hours later when he found Harry hiding away in an empty room with his head between his knees on the floor. "Do you want me to come?" He asked and Harry shook his head. "It isn't easy having to... stay away when you love somebody. Even if it's what's best for them." He said slowly and Harry dared a glance up at him.
“I’m fine. Don’t need the hospital wing.” He whispered. He already knew what was wrong, actually. He just couldn’t really explain it to anyone else. Harry’s jaw tightened.
“Um,” he said, a bit uncomfortably, “I don’t know. Really fit. Chiseled face. Pretty eyes and tall - not, like,
Harry screamed and it was then that Draco noticed Pettigrew. Son of a
“No!” Tom hissed, trekking back and forth as a bird - okay, what the Hell? What was a bird doing here? Whatever, he was grateful - a bird flew through the air, clawing viciously at the basilisk's eyes. “It can still hear you!” He yelled as Harry continued to run.
“What the bloody Hell is
"Go ahead then," Harry spat back as a few others raced inside, "Get him killed then! I don't care! Let him run off and die with the rest of the
sorry-” he greeted, grabbing the bag. From behind him Sirius also reappeared. “You are doing amazing. I would never leave you on purpose, I love you so much-”
Draco shouted, yanking at his hair. Harry shushed him. “A sword? A
"Brilliant! Thanks - HEY JENKINS!" Draco called, "I GOT MAGIC GUNS FOR YOU TO KILL DEATH EATERS WITH!" He said and then turned back to the man, "My friend Jenkins is a muggle so he doesn't have a wand, but wants to help. Is it okay if you show him these gun things? He already knows how to shoot a muggle one." He added.
Draco looked down. The something in question was long and scaly and -
He said and Lavender's eyes lit up at that, "But I'm getting ahead of myself," he chuckled and grabbed a piece of toast to butter, "I've seen you two together. Very, uh, passionate." He said for a lack of a more... descriptive word. Ginny compared them to two eels... fair enough. Draco leaned in, "You are being safe, right?"
"Morning Ms. Haack," Harriet spoke quietly as she walked up to her. Ms. Haack is an older woman in her mid 60's who loves science. She wore little purple glasses that had jewels on them which stood out from her gray hair, gray eyes, and gray clothing.
"We are having the next practice next Monday and a month after that, we have our first game," He explained in the air with her.
"Yeah, she did!" Millicent agreed. "No idea why though," She grumbled into her food. Merry thought of the reasons that she could be depressed. Stress? No Harriet always is on top of her school work. Quidditch? Can't be, she always wins! Maybe it's something she is not telling them. Wait...
"Wow you really are ugly," Merry chuckled which made Malfoy gasp loudly.
"Well, the people of the Wizarding World fear dark magic of any kind. So the Ministry wanted to stay on the good side of the people and they restricted the dark side rights which is made up of mostly purebloods. Anyway, the dark and powerful wizard that started the revolution name was Tom Riddle. Tom Riddle gained followers that he promised that they would get their rights back. But, sadly most of the wizarding world does not know this because before Tom Riddle could fight against the Ministry, someone from the Ministry drugged him. They drugged him with a love potion which made him insane, he killed his followers and many others. He was the one who killed your parents." Mr. Feose stopped and waited for Harry to take in everything.
“Really?” He asked dryly and leaned against the stall, “I’m sorry that I valued your mental breakdown over the gender designated signs.” He said and the door cracked up slightly. “Hi again. I have defense in about ten minutes so…?” He held out a hand. Ginny peered out. She was such a small thing - though he could tell already that she was going to grow up to be a force to be reckoned with. There was a fierceness in her eyes he felt he had seen before.
“Hi!” Theo repeated, ignoring the other three. “How was your summer?” He asked as he bounced up and down. Theo had always lacked most of the poise and prestige a pureblood was expected to have – as a younger brother he wasn’t expected to inherit much for it to really matter anyway.
“Then why did he give them a choice and not you?”
“And… you used the spell we learned in our second year dueling club?”
He knew Hermione's spell had saved his life, but... he felt utterly defenseless without his wand. As it was, one wand between them felt precarious. Given that Harry wasn't comfortable with Hermione's it proved to be a difficult task.
“That’s who my family wanted me to go with!”
Five... Four... Three... Two...
"Look at you. Breaking your poor mother's heart," he said as Dolohav chuckled lowly behind him, "Honestly, I expected so much better from you." He added on. Draco looked back at them, but didn't respond. Wouldn't. He simply waited calmly as the room seemed to grow smaller and smaller. His mother came back at some point, handing out cups of tea between teary-eyes sniffles and pointed looks at everywhere but Draco.
“What is that?” Hermione finally asked and Draco looked down to see he was fiddling with the watch again. Ah. He let it go so it fell against his chest. “You didn’t have that before, did you?”
"I'm Merry's mother, Cara Baxter," Cara blushed and shook his hand. Mr. Feose kissed her hand which made both of them blush even deeper.
"Today you will be taking notes," He walked up to the chalkboard but turned around when he heard no one take out their notebooks. He looked at Harriet for a bit with her already prepared notes but said nothing. "Why is no one except Ms. Potter prepared with her notebook ready?" No one moved. "Take out your notebooks," He scowled which made everyone get the clue and started to take notes as he explained proper cauldron care and how to not blow up the entire classroom. Harriet frowned a bit when she realized they weren't going to be brewing today. He explained how 2 class periods would be for preparing while the last class period at the end of the week would be for brewing the potions. Merry seemed a bit bored by all of the rules but Harriet knew the rules were necessary for safety. It seemed like Harry thought wrong, potions seemed like it was not going to be a flop of a class.
"Thank you, Mr.-"
Dead flies and bits of fluff,
"As do I, and most other Purebloods," Merry sighed, "There is a lot of interbreeding between Purebloods to try and keep the purity of magic."
"Oh good morning, young ones," The delicate man said which scared Snape. His surprised look was quickly replaced with a sneer.
"Malfoy, how have you been?" His eyes twinkled without even looking up.
"Tracey Davis," Harry knew she was a half-blood unlike the others in her year.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So what do I have to learn?" She looked up at him who was twice her size and height. He explained it very briefly and had her get on her broom and fly around for a bit.
"Albus, this is not the time for small talk." He stopped in front of his desk, house elf beside the man.
"Wait so Dumbledore knew that there was a full arse troll in the dungeons, and then sent the Slytherins back to their common room which is in the dungeons," Merry said disgustedly.
"What day is it?" Merry asked with a trembling voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come on now, you need a whole new wardrobe for both wizarding and muggle right?" Merry took her arm and lead her through the sea of older witches. Harry nodded.
"Hi Harriet," He said lowly.
"Yes I am fine," She hissed back while she ran her fingers across his scales. He was a Black Strangler, every kid was warned about how poisonous this snake was. It was the most poisonous snake known. When bitten the venom would make you feel like you were getting strangled. Beetlejuice only bites on command plus Harry always carries around an antidote just in case. He was pitch black on top that slowly faded into bright red on the bottom. He also had a red tongue and black eyes. Beetlejuice was as long as her arm and as thick as her wrist.
"Harry!" He hissed while Harry just smiled.
"I'm Merry Baxter."
"What?" She asked confused.
"Most people in charge really don't think, they think about themselves or only look at one type of group which creates a biased. They have a hard time thinking about others or what will be best for society."
"Let's go!" She dragged him to the fireplace and grabbed some powder.
"Hey," Draco bumped their shoulders together, "Why don't we go fly around, I have my own Quidditch pitch."
"Thanks for being entertaining," Flint chuckled. They walked to the Slytherin common room while talking about Quidditch. He said the password and opened the door for her. She thanked him and went up to her dorm to put away her broom.
"Transfiguration is more of a hands-on class, so you may like it better," Harriet nodded to herself. They sat in front of the class off to the side because Hermione was sitting right in front of the desk... which had a cat on it.
"Low-grade fever of 99.4, nothing too serious but we just have to watch that so it doesn't go up," He muttered to himself mostly. "Have you taken any painkillers lately?"
"Winky can you please get us two cups of hot chocolate," She asked the shivering elf.
"Shush." They walked out and started to walk to Transfiguration. "Did we even have homework?"
"Have you already made notes for this class?" Merry said like she was slightly scared to know the answer.
Teach us something please,
"Dude those two girls were hot!" Kyle shouted as they walked away.
If you are reading this we have passed. If our beloved daughter, Harriet Lillian Potter, is still alive we wish for her godfather, Sirius Black to take her. If he is unavailable or deceased Remus Lupin shall take her in. If neither of them are available, please let anyone take her in that is still alive and will treat her well.
"Only if they find out before the drop of blood hits the parchment," The goblin smirked. Harry smirked along with him.
But she is also the war, the famine, the death, and the destruction.
"WHAT!" Harry screamed.
Draco stood up, "What do you need, Rosier?" Harriet was surprised at his tone, it was demanding and cold. Nothing like Draco's normal warm voice.
"Well I better get going," She sighed and picked up Beetlejuice who slid under her blouse. They had 10 minutes to get on the train.
"You are always welcome here Harriet. I can see why Draco likes you so much," She chuckled into her hand.
"Sorry guys, I warned him that Hermione was here but I didn't know you were here," He hung his head in shame.
"I really don't care about looks as long as they are nice to me and others. And I guess not smart really... but mature I guess. Like they don't do or say anything stupid. Book smart is different from street smart. Like you," Flint looked at her quickly, "You once said that you have a hard time in class but I can already see that you know a lot the real world and you know when to say something and when you shouldn't."
"It takes a lot of knowledge, patience, and magic ability to create a new element like metal by only using one of the 4 elements in this case fire." Harry nodded understandingly. The professor looked like she wanted to say more but didn't. Harriet soon calmed down after everyone got back to their own needles.
"Ew," She scrunched up her nose and made a face. Flint let out a loud laugh.
"Come on!" Pansy shouted at the two. The two girls raced to the combined group of Ravenclaws and Slytherins.
"She set the match on fire and when the flames died down the needle was just there," Merry said excitedly. Other students turned towards them and started to whisper. Harriet felt the world close in on her slowly and started to panic.
"Transfiguration," She nodded.
'Wait no, he could get in a lot of trouble with the Ministry if they find out and they will,' She said in her mind. She wouldn't ever want anything bad to happen to Mr. Feose.
"But no need to worry, we don't teach those types of lessons anymore," Riley reassured them. A few students came down from their dorms which interrupted their conversation. It was some random girls that seemed a few years older than them.
"So what happens now?" She asked the goblin in front of her.
"Wingardium Leviosa," She said and flicked her wand. The feather lifted up slowly and twirled around a bit.
Harriet tried not to wince at the loud squeaking Winky talked in, "Yes Mistress, right away." The loud pop made Harriet jump once again, she really doesn't like loud noises.
"May I take some coins?" The goblin frowned in confusion but nodded anyway. He twirled his hand around and a small coin pouch appeared in his hand. After he asked for 2 galleons, he handed her the pouch. He quickly explained how Wizarding Currency worked but Harry already knew all about it because she read a few books about it. She grabbed a like 9 small stacks of galleons and 12 small stacks of knuts. She would have to get a whole new wardrobe plus all of the school supplies.
As Draco passed out the gifts, Merry leaned over to her, "The youngest always passes out the presents. Even though you are the youngest, Draco still gets so proud to pass out the presents every year." Harriet chuckled lightly and thanked Draco for handing her one. She looked at it oddly, it was a bit large almost the size of her torso, even though that is not saying much. She didn't have enough time to look at the tag due to Draco handing her another gift, this one a lot heavier. She gained a few more presents, smaller this time. She looked at the several presents quite confused, she never expected to get this many gifts. Merry leaned up against the couch and just watched the tree glisten and the ornaments twirl around. The whole manor seemed bursting with Christmas spirit, everything was glittering and alive. Too bad darkness will fill the manor tonight. The doorbell rang and there was a distant loud pop of a house elf opening the door but Draco got up running, seeing Merry get up also, Harriet followed close behind her. Harriet turned the corner right on time to see Draco hugging Severus tightly while Riley brushed Severus off with his gloves.
"Harriet," She looked up, it was Flint. Her heart skipped a beat and her face blushed.
"No but we don't have to risk getting expelled because of it," Merry frowned.
"Idiot freak!" She screamed so loud only dogs could hear.
A smarter hat than me.
"Liam Markson," The left one said while still staring at Merry's chest.
"Like last week for a migraine," She shuttered at the memory, migraines are terrible. It felt like your brain just exploded.
"What are yours?" Cedric asked while still looking at Harry.
--------------------------
------------------------------------
Flint looked surprised, "You know about that?"
Harriet nodded her head, her eyes feeling a bit warm at the idea of her being welcome, "Thank you," She almost whispered while looking at the ground blinking rapidly.
"No, I did!" Merry shouted.
She knocked on her Aunt's door, her face still sore from the last time Dudley pushed her to the ground. She knocked again louder, when Dudley had a nightmare or even cried, Petunia and Vernon always seemed to run to him so they could hold him. The door opened harshly, her Aunt glared at her shivering body.
"She must feel so miserable," Pansy cooed, ever since they met Pansy felt the need to be like her older sister and always protect her. Even if she never shows it.
"Why do you even want to do this?" Merry asked while tightening her cloak around herself. It didn't seem as cold earlier but the temperature must drop significantly after hours.
"Why?" Harriet frowned in confusion.
"Of course," Harriet smiled.
"That's good," Harriet picked up Beetlejuice. He has been having trouble shedding his skin lately. He seems to be growing more since being out of the small cupboard. "I will miss Hogwarts."
"Harriet, what are you doing here?" His eyes wide in surprise.
"Hey we need to go to potions now," Merry sighed.
"We were talking about," Harriet shoved her arm a bit and shook her head, she didn't want Merry to be rude. "We were talking about what path we should take to Defense Against Dark Arts," Merry drawled out, she really did want to insult Draco.
if you have a ready mind,
"What is your name?" The bushy haired girl asked in a bossy tone.
"Thank you," She smiled and took one. She gently put it in her mouth and almost jumped at the sweetness. Dumbledore also popped one in his mouth, "Why did you call me up here sir?"
"And? Are you saying I shouldn't go?"
After eating, the group left for the house tent so Flint could give a speech. His speech was a bit boring but she could admit that she could see the passion in his dark eyes and deep voice. She smiled at his passion for this sport, it seemed to be dripping off him and filling the tent. She felt his pride and passion surround her and make her skin feel alive and buzz. After he was finished, she could still feel the excitement. It calmed her for some reason. Her legs and arms shook as they walked to the gates, Flint ruffled her hair again before the gates opened. Flint climbed on his broom first and flew out, then her, then the other chasers, then the beaters, then the keeper. She looked around to see the whole school, cheering and the place shook with excitement. They got into positions, the Gryffindors glared at the Slytherins and vice versa. Harriet smiled at the Gryffindor beaters who smiled back.
"If you put away the eyes," Merry groaned. Harriet quickly puts away the eyes in the storage room while Merry stirred the potion correctly. Snape looked at the two with an eyebrow raised, they are using the more advanced ingredients for this potion. He nodded to himself, she really did have a clever mind, even more than her mother.
"They weren't at dinner either," Another 5th-year girl added.
"Kyle Johnson," The right one winked at Harry again.
"Yes," Merry giggled, "And in the future, as you start to realize how talented you are, I believe you can start being a bit more confident with yourself and your abilities."
"Didn't you hear me?"
She is the creator and/or destroyer of magic.
"And so do I," Draco nodded.
"Oh yeah?" She held up the spoon again, preparing to fling it. The other first year Slytherins watched with amusement.
"We will introduce you to everyone when they all get here," Merry explained, she motioned Harriet to go join her on the floor full of blankets and pillows. Harriet grabbed her book for comfort as well as her fluffy blanket and sat a bit away from the main circle, not wanting to get too close. The twins sat across from her, perfectly side by side. Draco sat to her right and Merry sat to her left, in some sort of protective way. A few more people entered, more older, Harriet turned to see Flint with a few of his friends. Flint was off to the side, not seeming to be leading the group. Harriet kept her head down, not wanting to make eye contact with everyone but she was relieved that she would find out everyone's name quite easily in the exchange of her own. Several others entered Draco's room in the span of about, all of them were entering in smaller groups of only one or two. All seemed to become visibly happier and more relaxed coming into the room and seeing everyone sitting down. Some were already starting to eat some food that Draco most likely had the house elves get earlier, the older kids were off on their own on some chairs that they transfigured from some of Draco's books. While Harriet was at awe from the level of transfiguration it took to preform that action, the kids more of their age sat near them, most likely all at Hogwarts still. Some were reading or doing homework that they snuck in, a pair was playing chess and the odd twins were playing a clapping game with their hands.
"Thank you, Mrs. Baxter," Harry said while lightly touching the broom. She had always wanted to fly.
"I'm sorry," Merry laughed through her tears.
Sorry for the long wait, stuff got in the way. Don't worry I will update tomorrow or Friday with a longer chapter XP
"Really?!" She screamed excitedly and hugged him tightly. He hugged her back and chuckled.
"Harriet! Stop," Merry raised her voice a bit, Harriet dug her nails into her arms in fear of the loud voice yelling at her. Draco touched her shoulder when he saw her flinch at Merry. Harriet looked down, she messed up, she is going to lose her friends and be a terrible witch. She should just leave Hogwarts, she has no courage nor bravery in her. That can start to mess up her ambitions, making her a terrible Slytherin. "Harriet, I didn't mean to scare you." Merry walked over to her, kneeling in front of her. "I'm sorry sweetie, it's just that we grew up never mentioning Who-Shall-Be-Not-Named so we get scared when we hear the name. I'm sorry."
Narcissa shook her head lightly and smiled at her, "It's not a problem at all dear." She snapped her fingers and a house elf popped up, a different one from the one yesterday.
"What are you doing?!" She yelled at Harriet who was still curled up against the opposite wall. She pushed back into the wall, she didn't like when people yelled. Loud noises are really scary.
"Are you beautiful gals firsties?" The one on the left asked. The one on the right winked at Harry.
"Either you are with me or you say nothing," Harriet warned.
"Good morning Freak," Her Uncle replied grumbling. Dudley came down a few minutes later, grumbling about how little sleep he got because he stayed up late playing video games. This week was the last week of school and Dudley was turning 11 in a few days. Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon have been showering him with praise and gifts non-stop. She always was never given any gifts or allowed to be out when the holidays were around. After awhile she stopped caring and realized that they will never like her. Both Uncle Vernon and Dudley were done with breakfast so she finished cleaning and got ready for school. Everyone hated her, they bullied her and teased her about everything she did. It was all because of Dudley and his group. Piers always teases her about her wearing bras and frilly panties even though she doesn't. She didn't wear bras because she had a very flat chest and she wore boxers too big for her. Her Aunt would only buy them when she went shopping for Dudley. Harriet put on a baggy, light blue sweatshirt and gray, baggy jeans and ratty, old tennis shoes. She never even tried with her hair but she covered up her scar with makeup. She grabbed her school bag filled with books. She always completed all of her homework months ahead and had perfect grades. Harriet loved to learn because it was something she could do by herself and for herself. She quickly jogged to school, avoiding Dudley and his gang. When she got to school, she went immediately to the library to return books.
"Harriet, have you seen any good looking guys?" Pansy turned to her. Harriet looked around, not knowing what to say.
"Do you want to go to breakfast with us?" Merry asked and didn't get a response. "We are going to go, just text me if you need anything." The girls all left saying goodbye and feel better to Harriet. Harriet just curled up even more and tried not to cry for no reason in particular.
"The purge was a time where many kingdoms slaughtered any type of magical creature," Harriet explained. "King Uther was the one who killed the most magical beings so many sorcerers learned to kill and torture so they could try and stop him."
"Just getting some currency is all," He also said while getting up. "I won't be the one to going to your vault, Griphook will take you." Another goblin entered who looked more green than the gray one in front of her.
"What do you need?" His voice was less annoying and was soft and kind when talking to her.
there will be a person with magic no one else has ever dreamt of.
"I win!" Draco shouted.
She will determine the fate of this world.
"I thought that 'cause this kitty doesn't have a home, you can take her. It is really hot out so I don't want the kitty to get sick," Harry pouted and looked up at her with her head down.
"Let's go," Harry sniffed and rubbed her nose. They walked to History of Magic together while talking about how boring this class was supposed to be.
------------------------------------------------
"Yeah, that's a better idea!" Harriet agreed, she really wanted to see the whomping willow. So for a few hours, the group of Slytherins explored until their feet ached and the temperature began to drop.
"Draco!" She called as he turned the corner with Blaise.
Thank you guys so much for the kudos!
"Please call me Cara," She said.
"I'd rather cry," Harry whined. Millicent was reading again, Harry figured that she was reading an adult book. Beetlejuice was sleeping in a ball in a corner and Willow was still fighting with the plush dragon. Autumn was on Millicent lap still and still slightly glaring at Harry. Merry sprayed some weird liquid in her hair to make it wet. She brushed her hair and kept spraying until it was flat. Harry used her magic to flatten it because she knew that the liquid and brush would do nothing to her hair. Merry heated up her wand and wrapped a piece of hair around her wand to curl it.
"Yes, it never grows up and can create fire!" Harry jumped in.
"Oh, that makes sense, never mind," Harry mumbled and reread the scroll.
The group of first year Slytherins made their way to charms. Draco was bragging on and on about his father and his accomplishments. Everyone that is was so amusing but she didn't really mind it. She was learning a lot about his family which interested her. She didn't really care about his accomplishments, to her it mattered if they were respected and if they deserved her respect. As Draco spoke, it seemed his father was respected but by the wrong people. But respected none the less. They walked into the classroom and sat down in the back quietly, except Harriet. Harriet stared at Neville and Hermione up front. Neville looked really scared, like usual, while Hermione was reading, like usual. Harriet decided that because last time she wanted to say a few kind words but couldn't so this time she was. She walked up to him quietly.
"Yeah but don't worry he doesn't bite. His name is Beetlejuice," Harry replied.
"How the hell did you do that?" Merry asked amused.
"Hogwarts Express!" She screamed. The wind and green fire whipped around them as ash twirled around their feet.
"Yes?" Mr. Feose said while drumming the tips of his fingers on the counter. She just gave him a look in return.
Learning was the only way she could feel happy, she felt so powerful and intelligent when she knew material years ahead of her. Learning put her ahead of all of the mean people around her, she could outsmart Dudley and his gang so she didn't get beaten up. She could confuse her Uncle so he wouldn't hit her. She could use her knowledge to get ahead of others, only to end up using her knowledge to help people. She wanted to change the world with her ideas, she didn't have the power though. Maybe one day she will. She will have the power to change how people are discriminated against for anything, their sexuality or simply how they grew up. Hatred is such an evil and sickening thing in the world, she never would hate anyone. That would defeat the purpose of what she wanted to change. She wanted to change how much hatred is in the world, she wants people to be happy and free. Something she is not. She wants others to be different, she never wants another child to face what she faced. She will make this happen, she will continue to learn until she could help others. She will continue to gain power, to gain knowledge in order to help the world around her. It takes only one person to change minds, she will be that person.
Cedric was torn but easily submitted, "Of course not, I will help you." With that the trio was off trying to save the troll.
"What does everyone do?"
"They are quite known for being dark-"
(See the end of the chapter for
Sorry for any typos, there probably is a lot but anyways I hope ye enjoyed <3 <3
"Sit down please," Gemma smiled at Harry when she saw her innocent, questing eyes looking around. Harry blushed and smiled back. Merry practically punched her arm to make her look at the glass part of the common. Harry gasped, you could see a huge squid and bunch of other fishes go by. It was so pretty and magical. The water seemed to glow and glitter. One wall ahead of them had a roaring fireplace with a painting of some sort, maybe some famous wizard. The wall to their left was filled with bookcases and antiques which made Harry perk up in excitement. There was a crystal chandelier above them and the room was decorated very well with furniture and other antiques. It was still dark in the common room but definitely brighter than outside. They all sat down, Harry again was in the middle of Merry and Draco. Draco was ranting on about how every single ancestor on his blood line was in Slytherin. Blaise was sitting in an armchair near Merry mocking Draco silently which was making everyone laugh even the Prefects. Harry couldn't laugh because Draco was only looking directly at her. He really seemed to be trying to impress her. Suddenly a door slammed open that was not the entrance, everyone but Harry jumped. She was used to slamming doors and worse. It was a very pale, tall man that was wearing all black robes. He has shorter, straightened black hair that seemed to be greasy. He also had pitch black eyes that looked a bit weird to Harry. He had an emotionless face and body which impressed Harry, she had a hard time hiding her expressions.
"Just how you said it," She giggled.
"I should have your wand before you start Hogwarts but for now I must get to work," He grabbed the parchment and disappeared. Harry and Merry just stared at each other until they bursted out laughing. They both exited the store crying from laughing so hard.
'Gone two,' Potter said, the side of his lip twitching up in a smile. 'And I'm meant to be in a meeting back in London at four, my International Portkey's arranged for tomorrow, so I can't reschedule it. Sorry, you were sleeping so soundly I wasn't sure if it was fair to wake you, but I didn't want to just sneak out and leave you.'
Pansy glanced at Draco, lip twitching in amusement.
‘A while,' Luna said, airily, perched on the lap of a tall, broad redhead Draco vaguely recognised as one of Adrian's teammates, traces of her plum-coloured lipstick smudged at the corners of his mouth. 'I've not heard you bring anyone home since my birthday, and that was, oh...'
, anything, just please - oh, f-fuck! Oh,
,' he gasped in horror. 'Everyone's going to know what we've been up to, you bloody vampire.'
was why Draco didn't do one-night stands. How did one manage to extricate themselves from -
,' Draco said lamely, rising to his feet hurriedly, glancing at the tumbler in his hand before draining it to steady his nerves. 'I forgot about my - er - my husband. Well, best be off -'
Harry goes to the potion shop and gets her letter.
"Usual?" He went to the phone by the cash register.
Flint shrugged, "Malfoy usually gloats about his father, the girls do girl things and the guys eat and talk about quidditch."
"Do we have to wear something nice?" Harriet wondered, she just wanted to wear her baggy pajamas.
"Will be 2 minutes," He informed and sat across from her. They talked about some potions until a knock came from the fireplace. Harry jumped up to open the gates.
"Really?" Harry asked. Mr. Feose seemed a bit older than this man.
Harriet's head shot up, "What?"
Slytherin: Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, Theodore Nott, Pansy Parkinson, Millicent Bulstrode, Merry Baxter, Travand Daphne Greengrass
"I mean if you are really good, then you can catch me!" Merry shouted and took off again. Harriet laughed at chased her into the night. They flew until their lungs hurt and their cheeks hurt from laughing. If only they could see the person watching them in the dark.
"I tipped the storage thing over so you didn't have to get yelled at for the 10th time this week," She explained and said a quick cleaning spell to clean her arm.
"Come here," His voice softer but still a bit harsh. She stepped forward and he led her out of storage room into the dead silent class who were all waiting to see what happened. Merry and Pansy grimaced at her arm while Millicent grabbed a towel to help get the goop off. Daphne ran towards her and checked her for any injuries while Tracey whispered comforting words to her.
"Come in," Harriet groaned from inside.
"Harriet?" She gasped and quickly wiped her eyes faster and stood up to see Draco by the door.
"It is my favorite movie," Harry giggled. Merry started to pull out some makeup from her bag which made Harry groan.
"Are we waiting for Severus and Riley?" Draco asked while he started to sort out the presents by the person. Harriet noticed there weren't as many gifts that Dudley received under the Christmas tree. Narcissa nodded her head softly while Lucius was whispering in her ear about something.
"What about the smart and the looks?"
She will walk the earth, have knowledge beyond a god, have talent beyond even the meaning, and magic beyond magic itself.
Draco sighed and took a bite out of a chocolate frog, "Fine." He ate the rest of the chocolate frog and he jumped up excitedly, "It's time to get ready!" Merry grabbed Harriet and dragged her to the bathroom attached to Draco's room. Merry put some concealer on Harriet and darkened up her lashline. Merry put on a more natural look with light foundation and light brown eyeshadow. She also put on pink blush and bronzer. Harriet put on her own mascara with little problems. Harriet put her glasses back on again and didn't even bother with her hair, she quite likes her hair messy.
"Yes, she is not allowed to leave Hogwarts for the Holidays, you are correct."
"What?" She said while shaking a bit.
'Loyal... Brave... Willing to fight for loved ones... resourceful and determined also though. Hmmm. I know just where to put you!' A voice in Merry's head appeared. The hat sang out 'Slytherin!' Merry smiled and walked casually to the Slytherin table. When a student got sorted and walked to their table, their black robes turned into their new house color robes. Soon Millicent was called up, she got into Slytherin also. Harry kept track of who was sorted where in her head so far.
You might belong in Gryffindor,
"You are just saying that because you actually like the Goblin Wars," Merry gagged.
"Good Morning Hogwart Students!" Professor Hooch shouted which made Harriet flinch. She really hates loud and sudden noises. "It looks like we have everyone," She skimmed the list and took roll call quickly. She then explained some rules about flying and with every word her stomach dropped.
After that Headmaster Dumbledore dismissed the first years so their head of houses and Prefects could introduce themselves and go over rules.
"It is the best movie!" Harriet defended and laughed.
"Morning Harry," Slick said, that's his nickname from Harry. He slicks back his black hair out of his eyes and wears really silver, shiny clothes.
----------------------------------------
"Do I need my stuff?"
"It is very nice to meet you, Oliver," Cara giggled and hid her smile with her free hand.
"She so has you wrapped around her little finger," Derek laughed into his beer.
Her Aunt grabbed her by the collar of her shirt which was also Dudley's, "That's it!" She shouted loudly into her face. She dragged the small girl downstairs who had a hard time walking down the stairs when being dragged roughly. She walked around and headed towards the entrance of the house which made Harriet start to cry a bit, she didn't want to go outside. She hadn't eaten any breakfast and she was going outside already. Why wasn't she going to eat a big breakfast like Dudley?
"I heard that you don't feel well?" Riley set his box down and opened it up, it was filled with potions and other muggle supplies like bandages.
"When did that happen?" Harriet shouted in anger, they flinched, never thinking of what she would look like anger due to her always being soft-spoken and gentle.
"Go on, sit by them," Merry pushed her slightly towards the other Slytherin Quidditch players.
"I will let you decide that."
Petunia always made sure to rip up any books that Harriet brought home that were about magic. Harriet cried the day Vernon screamed at her that magic didn't exist, Harriet's face was so bruised and beaten the next day. Her eyes no longer sparkled with mischief nor curiosity, her vibrant green eyes only seemed dull now. Harriet's eyes no longer looked like Lily's, it was a good day.
"Will be here in 3 minutes," He states and grabs a cookie. The two eat cookies and talk about the new shipment of snakes they will be getting. Mr. Feose was not surprised when he found out that Harry could talk to snakes nor when he found out she could talk to all animals and in every language. He still wasn't surprised when she found out she could change her hair and body into anything she wanted from a lamp to another person. He didn't even seem to care that she can change her voice either even though like 3 other wizards could do this throughout all time. That is why Harry loves him so much, he doesn't care about her having a lot of power nor her name.
"What do you have planned?" Merry looked at her in wonderment and slight fear. She just smirked and went to her trunk. She dug out two potion bottles and handed one to Merry.
"Both Hogwarts?" he said in a raspy voice which made Harry shiver. Merry just nodded and gripped onto Harry's arm tighter.
"What was wrong with that chick?" Merry snickered which made Millicent snort.
"Or perhaps in Slytherin
"100 galleons will be added to the pouch each month," Griphook explained. She nodded and took a big breath because of the emotions running through her. Relief, happiness, and something else she could not explain. She started to walk back to the cart and mentally prepare herself. The ride was the same on the way back except Harry almost did throw up. She was still gagging when they stopped. She got out of the cart and thanked the goblin for taking her to her vault. The goblin looked very shocked but smiled at her after his shock wore off. She skipped out of Gringotts while humming a tune. She could finally get away from the Dursleys', she can finally have a normal, nice life.
"Yeah, why?" She rubbed her eyes tiredly.
"Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
Magic:-
"No ide-," Harriet gasped as she felt a piercing pain in her head like a flaming needle stuck through her head and saw a bright flash of light, "Adrian Puncy, Marcus Flint, Derek Warrington, Hugh Montague," She said in a deep monotone voice while the words just seemed to appear in front of her. She shook her head as the names disappeared. She turned to Merry horrified after she finally realized what happened.
Hufflepuff: Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Ernie Macmillan
"Have to ask?" She replied as she hopped up on the stool in front of the counter.
"Do you get them during it or right after?"
"I like it down here, I like this coldness," He hissed softly and nuzzled her neck. Harry almost tripped on nothing which made Merry snicker and hold onto her arm. They came up to a weird looking door. They took so many turns and twists down here that Harry knew she wouldn't get out tomorrow without getting lost. The door was almost invisible because it matched the walls but it was more black. The blackness of the door blended in with the shadows near the door. Harry knew she was going to forget where the door was.
"I know how your parents really died and who they really are," Mr. Feose whispered like he was afraid to even speak about this. Harry couldn't say anything because she was speechless. Someone was going to tell her the truth for once in her life. She continued to stare at him with tears in her eyes until he cleared his throat and started to talk.
"Sweet Merlin, could you have made it any tighter?" Harriet complained and turned around to see Merry with a straight face.
"Sir, if his meeting is all about you being concerned because you are afraid of me turning dark just due to who I hang out with, I think we are done. And I'm not trying to be rude sir, I'm really not."
"How do you even get on with a skirt?" Harriet whispered to Merry.
"First day here and he already has a girlfriend," Ron whispered to Dean who hollered with laughter. Seamus blushed even heavier with the boys' comment and stared at his new feather. Neville frowned slightly and sunk more into his chair. Harriet raised an eyebrow, not knowing what Ron said. Hermione glared the boys for making a lot of noise and then continued to watch her floating feather. Harriet ended up helping each of the boys perfect their spells by the end of the class. After the bell rang Merry ran up to her.
Hope you enjoyed this longer chapter!
"Have fun Harry, write to me soon to tell me what house you are in. You will do perfectly fine, if you have any questions just ask," Mr. Feose hugged her.
"Good morning," She said with a cheery voice. The goblin just raised an eyebrow at her.
"Are you sure?" Cara shouted desperately.
"Yes, of course I have my wand, now move!" Harriet slid down the hole and tried not to yell at the sudden drop. Merry slid down with her and bit her lip. Once they were out, they looked around nervously, nothing. The two searched the dungeons carefully and found nothing.
"Why?" She cried and curled up into a ball. "Why do people hate witches so much? I don't think I am evil, am I?" She whimpered into the cool air. Why do the witches always have to be the villains who love to kill and eat children? She doesn't want to kill or eat children. Witches are always the ugly one too. Was she ugly? Maybe, she does have a weird scar on her forehead and she was quite knobbly. Maybe the whole world hates witches, maybe it was just some social norm. Hopefully, one day people will accept people with magical powers. Until then, she had to face the fact that others would not like her. She needed to learn that others won't take care of her so she will have to take care of herself.
"This is Willow," Merry had Willow in her hands. Willow was nibbling on a stuffed dragon that was almost the size of her.
"He said I can't spend the holidays with you."
"I went to Diagon Alley!" Harry shouted.
"This morning, in class and everyone laughed at her," Merry looked at her friend oddly, never wishing to see her angry.
"When do you get them? Like in the morning or night?"
"Yes?" The young man sneered back at him which made Marcus roll his eyes.
"Just know that I never mean to hurt you or insult you. Just tell me to stop if I ever make you uncomfortable. And if you ever need anything, ask me. I know I'm not the best friend in the world but if you tell me things that I can't read from just looking at you, we can make any situation better. Okay?" Merry smiled brightly at her. Harriet nodded her head quickly not wanting to spill more tears in front of her.
"The stomach of a goat, pregnant female goats are the best for the most powerful and most useful bezoar, sir," She made direct eye contact with him, already knowing that he appreciated when students didn't question their answers.
"You are talking in English but it sounds different for some reason like a purring noise on top of it," Merry tried to explain. Harry nodded her head. A sales person came by them to ask if they wanted the cat.
"Hey don't be scared, I hate heights too," Tracey rubbed her back comfortingly.
"Could I finish school shopping before we make the change?" The goblin nodded.
"Draco did not shut up the whole entire time," She huffed. Harriet giggled and packed up her things. "I was seriously about to punch him."
"Harry, I know what happened to your parents," Mr. Feose blurted out of nowhere. Harry choked on her pizza.
Her scar burned brightly in pain, "No," Her jaw clenched in pain, "Just how my parents died and who gave me my scar." Draco and Merry both flinched. "Why do you flinch every time I mention Riddle or Voldem-"
"Where is Harriet?" Draco asked right away when he didn't see her.
"Yeah I'm really happy for you," He smiled back, he had a nice smile.
Transfiguration: -
"Your hair needs it," Merry smirked. They spent over an hour in the washroom on her hair, strengthening it, moisturizing it, fixing the dead ends, the whole works. Pansy came in to make sure they were still alive.
"I won't be so sure about that," The four gasped and turned to the destroyed entrance to see Riley and Neville. "I am sure that Slytherin's were the first escorted to their common room." He crossed his arms and tapped his foot.
"Finally!" Harry yawned and gave Merry's phone back.
"I was wondering if your friend here really did challenge Snape when he was going through the rules, is that alright kid?" He sneered the kid part. Merry puffed out her chest and pouted. Before she could say anything Harry interrupted quickly.
"Well good," She nodded again, "Cause you know that we all are here so you don't ever have to be alone. Right?" They all held their breath waiting for the answer.
"Hey," Merry's voice was very calm and soothing. "It's okay, I didn't mean to scare you." Merry reached out to brush her hair back that was sticking to her face. Harriet flinched and took a step back. "Breathe," Merry told her calmingly. Harriet closed her eyes and focused on her breathing, not wanting to have a panic attack on her first day. Once she calmed herself down, Merry asked her if she was okay.
"Yeah," Harriet sighed nervously, she started to pack more books into her trunk in order to go to Draco's. Merry shifted awkwardly, Harriet needs to know a lot of things before she should go to their Christmas party at the Malfoy's.
"Damn you're fast!" Merry shouted louder after Harriet. Harriet chuckled then dropped 50 feet and only managed to swope back up at 3 feet.
Halloween
"What do you guys want to do before dinner starts?" Merry asked the large group of first year Slytherins while looking at her phone. She saw Harriet jump and get excited but say nothing.
"Merry wait!"
"What do you mean?" She asked confused.
"Like the movie!" Merry laughed.
"That is not even the worst part," Mr. Feose said while taking a shot of God knows what. "The Wizarding World doesn't even know about this."
