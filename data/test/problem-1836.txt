Draco smirked. He turned his body around, so I had his dick dangling in front of me. It was the closest I'd been to it the entire time we'd been together, and it was inches from my face. I reached for the dessert bowl, scooping some into my hand to rub along the shaft and balls. I thought it would make it easier to really swallow. I was tentative, but he was patient with my dick back in his mouth and newly-wet fingers rubbing my hole.
Draco grinned, releasing him from his binds, but pulling Harry into a reassuring kiss. This was not their first and last, it was a promise.
Before Harry could finish refusing, the alpha had taken him by the elbow and begun pulling him to where everyone else was dancing. Harry tensed, looking to the side for the garden doors. He pulled, the grip on his arm not tight enough to hold him. He paced out to the gardens, avoiding the eyes of anyone looking at him as he quicked his pace to a run to get as far away as he could.
“Look, I know what you’re thinking, but I promise you it’s not what happened. Me and Theo used to have a thing, but that was years ago before I fell in love with you. He said he’d been waiting to get me on my own, so he could convince me that we weren’t right together and that I should be with him.” Draco frowned. “He kissed me, but I tried to push him away. I swear, I’d never hurt you like that. Please believe me.”
I was flat on my back in moments, spreading my legs for him to crawl between. He trailed cream and sauce down my body, leading down to the tip of my stiff dick. I shivered as he started down the path he'd made, cleaning with his tongue. It was near maddening. When his mouth was finally on my cock it was like heaven. As he slurped along, I felt his fingers massage my hole.
I could have almost guessed Snape would do something like that, but I assumed we'd be doing things for ourselves. Draco explained the budget cuts to most subjects after critiquing me for not listening again. I cringed as I imagined sitting here all year, but surely, they'd sort out the budgets soon. This wouldn't be for long. Soon enough we'll be back to the civility we had on the train, friendly but not around each other long enough to push it.
I shook my head a little, caught in his trap. We kissed again, losing track of time and almost making us late to class. Professor Sprout didn't seem too upset, knowing my love of her subject would mean I wasn't late on purpose. I saw Harry smiling at me, making me thankful my face was already red from the cold and disguised my embarrassment. I guess we both get a happy ending here.
"You are sure? This is not just a moment of lust, perhaps. This is the one you choose?" Lucius interrogated.
"Please, call me Draco. 'Your Highness' sounds too formal. And please, don't look down. I enjoy seeing your beautiful green eyes."
“No. Wait, yes,” Snape smiled. “Our anatomy is different to normal people, like the wings in our backs. And, even though we’re men, there’s a chance the demon gene allows us to…get pregnant.”
Sweat pooled and dripped from Harry's brow, so he panted and wiped his forehead. The last 20 minutes had been a bit of a rush, but finally, all the cleaning was finished. He'd done most of the cleaning, Hermione had mostly just tidied Phoebe's room because he never seemed to organise things right. His cousin was a giant diva without the talent or looks to support the horrible character trait. Everything needed to be organised perfectly and prettily, even if she could never keep it that way for longer than three days. It frustrated Hermione endlessly.
. I turned back to Hermione with a fake smile and her eyes were wide and apologetic, even though we both knew it wasn't her fault. I was trying to console her when a hand on my shoulder dragged me back, slamming my back onto the floor before a heavy weight settled over me. Ron's fist flew for my face, and I tried to deflect it with my arms, but it broke through and hit my jaw. The metallic taste of blood coated the tip of my tongue. I've either bit my lip or my tongue, but the pain's so general I can't tell where it's coming from. His fist flies down again and I'm socked on the other side of my face, barely catching his fist to prevent the third punch. It feels like I'm trying to wrestle him off for hours, though logically it's only seconds, then all of sudden Ron is flung off me by a spell. He was in a full-body bind. I looked around the room, and most of the teachers had their wands in their hands at their sides. The only wand pointed in my direction was in the hand of my boyfriend, and he was rushing towards me.
"Now, the typical relationship is heterosexual. This means it's between a male and a female, however, there is also the possibility for homosexual relationships. These either mean two males or two females. Sexuality is a broader factor, and while I'd love to discuss every variation on love, I'll cover the very basics for everyone. You may not think you fall into these labels, and that is fine. If you want to discuss privately another day, I'm usually free.
She started with the biology lesson showing diagrams of what the body parts looked like, and which bits did what. She went through what puberty looked like in girls, all the bleeding and hormone shifts making them easily stressed. Boys shift hormones, voices get deeper and they start wanting to be sexually intimate with people. Even Hermione, who was well known for being all about facts, felt like she wanted our little lesson to be over.
He's been their servant since then. The only reason they didn't hoist him out on his ass was that they'd lose the workers with him, and training them was a pain. And probably be reported, making going out in society a struggle of whispers and gossip. So he was charged with cleaning everything and taking care of Dudley before parties. It turned out not so bad, helping that porker introduced him to Hermione and Ron, a couple of the servants' kids. They were great. Nobody else wanted to deliver food to him when his heats started six months ago, or cover the work when he couldn't.
Harry thought. He didn’t know if he liked Snape yet, but the look on his face showed there was more to him than Harry knew. Harry nodded, after all, if Snape was his biological father, he was going to act like it. Snape relaxed, asking Harry if he wanted to spend some time together, just an hour or two, so they could talk things over. Harry nodded, insisting he got dressed first because it wasn’t natural for wizards to walk around in their PJ bottoms.
Snape stepped aside to let me in and directed me to sit at his desk. I sat down steadily, but my hands still shook as I faced my Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Snape explained that he’d noticed I wasn’t as focused in class. I panicked and started to babble, saying that I was sorry for staring, but that I haven’t been able to stop it since my fourth year.
Harry looked down at his clothes, the grey garments under a forest green waistcoat, draped by a beautiful green frock coat. It was the same shade of green but had a silver lining and snakes circling the wrist cuffs and lapels. But Harry's favourite part had to be the signet ring, the golden lion on the silver ring. The same as the crest on his necklace. He loved it.
I mean, sometimes Lily and I would talk about it, I mean I was always a healthy person, so she kept saying we’d have healthy kids if I weren’t gay. She always begged me to be a sperm donor, if for some reason whoever she married couldn’t have kids, and I’d always agreed because she was my dearest friend and someone I'd trust to mother my children, but how the hell did she manage to get any of it. I'd never given her any.
Harry whipped around, his hand straying to his wand. Draco couldn't help but feel and no doubt look hurt. His brain screamed 'WAR WAR WAR!' and he knew it was right, but it didn't matter. How could Harry regard him as a threat so easily? Harry relaxed when he saw that it was Draco and offered a weak smile, "Sorry about that," he mumbled. He looked around them and then stepped out of the way of the door, dragging Draco back along with him. The blonde's breath hitched as Harry's fingers lingered on his wrist. His skin prickled and burned pleasantly at the contact, but before he could indulge himself, the hand was gone. "Did you need to speak to me about something?" he asked gently.
Their hands swung between them as Harry swung the red lead in random circles with small motions of his wrist. He whistled a light tune as they walked on wards through the sand. They had woken up fairly refreshed that morning, a good full English breakfast had them prepared for the day mapped out for them. After returning to the hotel with Seeker, they were to take a tram up to the Black Pool Tower and experience the circus and then go for some lunch.
With his mind made up he stood up and performed his nightly rituals before tugged his nightshirt on over his head and climbing into the rickety bed and pulling the sheets up to his chest. Draco's letter rested on his bedside table where he kept the rest of them, stacked neatly together and tied together with a silvery hair ribbon that he'd found in the old dress robes Draco had insisted he keep as a gift. The next morning he would go to Severus and ask for the rest of the week off and explain everything to him. No doubt he would already know that Draco had taken ill, but regardless he was going to explain everything including what he intended to do as the personal assignment for the exams. He just hoped that any potions he created wouldn't discredit his research should it fail.
"God, Draco, I love having you at my mercy," Harry smirked as he nibbled along Draco's jawline. He let his tongue wander over the pale skin and rocked his hips downward. Draco grunted and thrust his hips, grinding their dicks together through the burn of their underwear.
Blaise waved off her concerns with a flick of his hand, "You're still far too dramatic, Pansy," he stated loftily, "Besides, I was sick of seeing Draco moping around like that."
He ran a hand through his wind-tussled hair and dragged them down his face, cupping them around his mouth and nose. He could feel the hot throb of tears itching to bead out onto his eyelashes. He inhaled deeply, the stench of disinfectant still lingering heavily on his palms. He would need to wash it off –soon, but not now. Right now his throat was craving the soothing burn of red wine. How he needed the intoxicating flavor to fill his empty stomach.
"I want to help you get better," Harry stated simply at though it was the most obvious thing in the world. Draco frowned but managed to rip open his nightshirt and splay it on either side of his ribcage. He watched through hooded eyes as Harry cast the spells required and frowned at the darkened areas were the most pain was coming from. He dismissed the charm and then drew out his personal journal and noted it down. "For now, I want to try and get your fever down alright? Then I can start tackling whatever is wrong with your chest, how does that sound?"
Draco moaned and nipped along Harry's chest before rocking his hips, hooking his legs tighter around Harry's thighs for leverage. Strong hands gripped his buttocks. "Positive," he grunted, as he used Harry as an anchor to grind down against his lap. Draco felt his eyes roll back -it was all so intense! Harry was so deep and every time he twitched, he hit against that sweet spot.
Harry looked up in surprise before a look of utter adoration melted onto his features, "you -you don't have to, you know."
Hermione nodded her head, "Yes. You need to be under medical supervision, Harry, and running off to Blackpool will do nothing to help your condition."
Harry nodded weakly, "Yes he had but I also find that it would be beneficial to me if you agree to let me read to you."
He glanced over to the phone attached to the wall just outside the kitchen. That was where it happened. Harry had worn that soft black hoodie he wore on rainy days. The sky had been grey outside the window and rain had lashed down noisily, filling the screaming silence with the sound of needles. He could still hear the words falling out of Harry's mouth, like a distant echo in his ears. "That was Doctor Nickson. My test results came back this afternoon ... he said that it looks as though I have ... erm ... C-cancer"
Harry stopped to cough stiffly and choke a little on his dry throat. Draco was immediately at his side, his strong arms winding around Harry's chest to support his lover, throwing a glare at the stunned nurse. "B-but Mister Potter, you cannot leave the premises. Your tests-"
He dragged the blonde backwards into their bedroom and kicked the door shut behind them. Feeling a new rush of adrenaline surge through him, he forced the blonde man down onto the edge of the bed and straightened up between his long, lean legs. He kept his eyes locked on Draco's and started to work the buttons of his shirt open and let it slip down around his arms and fell to the floor. Draco watched hungry and swallowing thickly as he looked up at Harry's slightly more defined body. Exercise had been something to distract Harry from having nothing to do all day whilst he was at Severus' house. Ever since those six months had ended, he still kept up the routine, insisting that it kept his worries at ease and would let him think a little clearer. Draco didn't mind, it meant he had something firm to lean down on when he pounded into Harry's tight tanned body all night long. He had spent many a long night thrusting into Harry as he forced the younger man down over the length of their breakfast table, slipping in and out with his tight heat with ease. His cock twitched at the visage before him and he wanted to reach out and touch his lover. He looked so handsome –almost Adonis-like –as he stood in the glow of the flickering candles. He watched as the dark, damp trousers were unfastened the pushed down to reveal caramel thighs and firm muscles that made Draco's stomach knot.
Blaise turned back around to his blonde friend, "Why don't you just go over there and talk to him?" he asked as though it was the most obvious thing in the world.
Severus regarded him coolly, "After what happened in the lake, I have every right to do as I see fit to make sure you are no longer a harm to yourself or those around you. You are not well, Harry, but I believe you can be with some therapy, a strict regime and time away from work. You have been running yourself to the bone and I think you hit a wall."
Severus would have been able to help him or at least talk him around into thinking it wasn't all that bad. Just someone messing about.
His cousin smirked as she walked away, going to snigger with her mother about the big joke she'd just made of Harry while he stayed back to look at the frockcoat. It would have been the kind of thing his father would have had him wearing, maybe a little longer. Omega men were dressed as close to feminine as they could, longer frockcoats and their decorated wigs. Not that Harry would ever wear a wig, regardless of if he was in high society or not. They looked foolish, he was perfectly happy having his hair tied back like the portraits in the manor. But his figure would have been shaped wonderfully in that pattern.
"I'll come by and see you later guys," I grinned as I dashed away with the basket. "I don't want to keep him waiting."
I nodded, refusing to look any of them in the eye as Ginny was forcefully made to leave by her brothers, and my audience was stood before me. I turned my back to them, steadily lifting the back of my T-shirt so they could see the carnage. Their collective gasp shook my soul. I fucking hate my uncle.
"I expected less of an apology. But I suppose this is the best you could expect from Malfoy," Hermione giggled. "Neville! You know flowers, any idea what the bouquet is supposed to mean?"
While the prince would have been pettier, but his Harry's forgiveness and restraint just made him fall further in love. It was sweet to have such a compassionate omega by his side because he was sure their children will be well looked after. Draco orders his guards to bring a horse for his omega's friends and helps Harry onto his horse. Draco climbs on behind him, wrapping his arms around the other boy to take the reigns. Harry leans his head back, snuggling into his neck with a purr.
Was I clouded by my hate for him? It's true we were relying on not knowing each other so we could show sides we hadn't to anyone, so was that really what was happening. Malfoy sat on the corner of the blanket and took the flowers to smell, commenting he felt bad for not having anything to give me in return. The natural daylight shone in his hair and it seemed to glow silver. Having a relaxed smile rather than a vicious glare made him look so much more attractive. So he did have Gemini's perfect personality and was hot. Why was life making it more difficult to swallow this bitter pill? Finally, I sat down.
This morning he was sitting at breakfast, eating Mrs. Weasley’s food that was by no means up to the standard he was used to as a child. But Sirius decided not to complain as an angry Mrs. Weasley would ruin his day and it was an improvement of the Azkaban dining. Hearing a ticking on the window Sirius stood up to pay the owl that had been delivering him the Daily Prophet every day. The Daily Prophet was his only connection to the outside world even if it sometimes slandered his godson. Seeing the front page, Sirius started reading while drinking the last of his coffee.
This got everyone to quickly be quiet. Still looking at Severus, he asked: "Why did we not know you were married?"
“Now, I will not be going into detail on what I will all be teaching you as you will find that out soon enough.” Looking at Serena, Severus continued, “Serena will be going over all the social events during the holidays with you.”
Time flew by and on Saturday evening Harry made his way from the Gryffindor common room towards the Snape quarters. As you could probably guess, they were in the dungeons.
He was happy that his grandmother would be able to help. She even mentioned that she was proud of him for handling this information so well and getting the appropriate help to deal with this. While his grandmother could be very strict, Neville would not want anyone else.
“Dad these are my new friends.” said Ethan dragging Snape over to where Luna and Harry were still seated.
“I have heard from the third years, who had the class today, that she the opposite of Snape.” said Hermione.
“Now for today you did not have to prepare anything, so listen carefully when I explain what to do and what not to do.” said Professor Moonlight.
When Harry finally calmed down, Severus spoke very softly “It’s ok, everything will be ok. Do you feel a bit better now?” While Severus did not get a verbal answer he did feel Harry nodding his head.
“Mister Potter, we have received your file from Gringotts and let me be the first to apologize for what happened. The placing of orphaned children is the duty and the obligation of this department and sadly enough we failed you in that aspect,” Mdm Hawks said.
Reminding himself to look at this contract in the Black accounts, Harry looked at the next document and was happy to see it. It was the godfather contract between Sirius Black and himself. Reading it over Harry quickly noticed that it was quite standard. It mentioned that Sirius had to protect Harry at all costs, that in case something happened to his parents Sirius would take guardianship over him, and that in case Sirius did not provide a Black heir, Harry would take over the title and House. The contract also mentioned some specifics regarding Harry’s education and the time he should spend with Sirius.
“Stop calling them that!” replied Harry in anger. What was Malfoy's problem? Why did he feel the need to insult the Weasleys every time he mentioned them? Harry thought back on how nice Mrs. Weasley had been to take him in during the holiday. Even though they had little she always gave him presents and food. It was true that she often overwhelmed him and she wanted to control every aspect of his life, but it got him away from the Dursleys.
After the rules were put up all of us approached the golden unicorns. By the time the class finished only Harry, Susan, Hannah, one boy from Ravenclaw and Greengrass got to touch the small unicorns.
“First of all, they made the contract without using your full name which already makes it so that it is not bound by magic. This means that if you break it there will be no personal consequences for you. Besides that, Albus Dumbledore has been proven an unfit guardian and as such was declared illegal. This means that any contracts signed by him in your name, that have not yet been fulfilled, can be declared non and void by your new guardians within the first two years after becoming your guardians.”
“Harry Potter,” Draco drawled suddenly in front of Harry, shocking him out of his nervous thoughts. Without realizing it Draco had already greeted Severus, Serena, Ethan, and Ryan. Looking up he noticed both Lord and Lady Malfoy still talking to both Ethan and Ryan.
You could see professor Snape struggling with answering that one, but he still said: “Even then, because I know you Ryan and I know who you are and your house is not going to change that.”
After Ethan, it was Harry’s turn to receive his presents. He got a wand holster and new Quidditch gear from Ethan and Ryan. Narcissa and Lucius gave him beautiful wizarding robes and a book “Light, dark, or just magic?”. Severus and Serena had given him a 2-month subscription to see his favorite Quidditch team play the whole summer.
Suddenly Severus Snape spoke up "I might know of someone, however, I will need to confer with her first. There will of course be conditions before she will agree to come here."
Seeing Harry had done what he was told, Severus started to lay Harry back down so he could leave when he felt a hand reach out to him. Looking at Harry, Harry mumbled, “Please don’t leave”
“We are great uncle Luc,” before both gave him a happy hug. Having not seen their so-called uncle since the beginning of the school year, both could not stop talking. Mr. Malfoy was listening attentively while both boys told him about everything that had happened.
“For old pureblood families that is a normal amount of money to be deposited. It allows heirs to have monetary freedom and be able to learn how to handle money. Of course, as you can see this amount has increased over the years. In the first years of your life there is no need to provide you with this amount of money. And Harry, if you turn to the next page, you can see that this deposit barely makes a dent in the main Potter vault,” explained Severus. Ethan and Ryan each also had a trust vault in their name with similar amounts being deposited into it. It was mainly used to buy presents or extras that they did not particularly need.
“We shall see. I hope you have learned which wizarding families are better than others,” Repeating the statement he made in their first year.
“All seems to be in order. Since you currently don’t have your keys and you don’t know who has them we would propose you to make use of our key renewal service. This means that for a small fee all your previous Gringotts keys will no longer be valid and new keys will be created, if you would be agreeable.” Without letting Harry answer, Mdm. Longbottom quickly replied “Yes, that would be preferred. Since mister Potter currently is not the owner of his keys, someone else has access to his vaults and that is unacceptable.”
“You mean to say that someone besides you has your key? Wait here for a moment, I will be getting the Potter account manager who will be able to verify who you are.” Gornuk stated before leaving the room. Looking up at Mdm. Longbottom Harry could already see that she was getting worried.
“I am telling the truth I have friends.” said Ryan in a tone that sounded like he wanted to convince himself.
“No one you should worry about,” Sirius smiled. “He’s going to do a little test, then I’m going to get angry and throw him out.”
Then my hand was empty. Half a dozen wands clattered to the floor and rolled into each other. Professor Benylin frowned down at us, dealing punishment to Draco and me as ringleaders projecting bad behaviour. We were to write apology notes to each other, and offer a gift as a symbol of peace for the coming year. Something we thought they’d enjoy, without malice or sarcasm.
"Except, perhaps whatever is in the box is expensive. Diamond rings come in the smallest boxes boys." Hermione scolded, "besides the present doesn't matter, it's the note. So read the apology before you judge."
“Nothing, he’s better off thinking James is his father, at least he doesn’t hate him,” Snape said, much to the other men’s surprise. “I can look out for him at school, but he wouldn’t want me as his father.”
"That's a reason I wanted to come tonight. I know I'll never be good enough for a prince, but I hoped there'd be an alpha here that I could connect with. I want to love and have a family, things I'm not used to having. Tonight was maybe the only chance I'd have to do that."
As soon as the ceremony started, Hermione was in tears, probably from a mixture of laughter and happiness, and Severus looked close. He rested his head on Neville’s shoulder, who was holding the baby in his arms. He was just adorable, Frank Tobias Snape. He giggled quietly, and Neville rocked him, shushing him as Remus began the vows. The ceremony was long, but also romantic, and a little comical. In the end, he said Harry could kiss his bride, and he did so. The first dance was easy on him, Draco made it easy, even if he was 7 months pregnant.
"Contrary to what you think you know, you don't know anything about me, Harry," he frowned. "Yeah, I used to act like a spoilt prick and bully you and your friends, but I had my reasons for that, as well as being a spoilt little daddy's boy. But now my father has no power over me anymore, I don't need to walk around hating you. I'm a full-blown mummy's boy now. I'm trying to be your friend, so this is a judgement-free, supportive conversation that'll stay between us. So, tell me about your family, the homophobes who raised you."
But it wasn't only guards waiting in the gardens. The prince himself was pacing by the pond, impatient after a long day of disappointment. Only his personal guard and close friend, Blaise, was keeping him calm after such a horrible day. They'd been through half the town, and needed to return to the castle soon. It became obvious that he wasn't going to find his beloved Harry that day. But he'd try the next day, and the next day, for however long it takes. And Blaise would be by his side to help.
Harry listened intently, trying to repress a gag as he guessed what the last bit meant. He believed every word, he' been saying it since summer, but he knew what Hermione would say. She’d need something to convince her. Harry asked him for any proof, anything to show that Voldemort would trust him with anything like that. Malfoy’s eyes searched his, for what? He didn’t know. But whatever the blonde saw was apparently encouraging, because he stood with his eyes closed and stripped his robes of his shoulders. Harry sat mesmerised as buttons were undone, and a slender porcelain chest was slowly revealed to him. He couldn’t even form a sentence to ask why the boy in front of him was undressing.
My attention was brought back into focus by a blunt force hitting the back of my head, and the same book being offered to me. "I'm glad you're finally paying attention, now you can help me brew Draught of Living Death without blowing it up."
The young alpha came closer, taking Harry into his arms and holding him by the waist and the hand. "And I don't mind teaching you to dance."
Harry could tell who was, he didn’t even need to see the man, he recognised Snape by his voice. The change in his friends’ facial expressions meant they knew too, Ron looked sick to his stomach, and Hermione looked concerned. Harry’s mind went blank, he didn’t know how to react to news like this, he’d always hated Snape, but he never really had the chance to feel any different. And this was his chance to have a dad.
“Before you ask, the card doesn’t have the sender’s name, so I don’t know who it’s from.” Remus smiled, handing Harry the little note.
"Why the fuck did you do that?" I scowled, "he was probably coming to apologise and makeup, he had Hermione with him."
Our next 'Muggle Club' meeting was on a topic Lavender suggested, which sent shivers over me that were uncontrollable. That girl was impossible to listen to, she just blathered stupidly about stupid things. Any topic she thought of, or most likely her and Patil, was likely to be stupid and bore everyone senseless.
The last two Gryffindors were sorted, and they remained in Gryffindor. That’s when McGonagall started the feast, and most people were too focused on food to gossip. Harry noticed the Heads of Houses talking to Headmistress McGonagall, and raised an eyebrow at his dad, who winked at him and carried on his convocation.
"If you could now write down your alias name on these strips of paper," Benylin waved her wand and paper appeared in front of everyone. "Then I'll collect them for the draw and prepare your books for the end of the class."
Snape gaped at me, and I laughed, reaching up to close his mouth for him. When our skin met, it sent a jolt through me, and I bit my bottom lip. Snape looked hesitant, his hand slowly rising toward my face, so I brought it to my cheek, and leaned into the touch. I heard Snape’s intake of breath, and my teacher looked me straight in the eye, building an intense atmosphere around us. I leaned up and kissed him, just like I had the night before, but this time he kissed back. He brought me into his arms, deepening the kiss, holding me by the hips.
Ending the ball was necessary. Draco wouldn't waste time dancing with omegas to be polite when he wanted to start looking for the sweet omega who'd already stolen his heart. He grabbed the beta who was supposed to announce everyone that came in and asked him to look into everyone's family crests. Harry had said his aunt was at the ball, so it was the best lead he had so far. He'd told his father to call off the ball and retreated upstairs. He sat in the library and waited for the servant to return with an answer. Hopefully, it was the right answer, Draco would hear his family name and where they lived and be at his house before the sun rose.
The sun shone brightly through the window of the manor, catching on the already polished parts of the floor and blinding the boy trying to scrub it. Multiple times he had to raise his hand to his eyes, wanting to block the harsh rays so he could finish cleaning. He really didn't want to know what punishment was waiting for him if he didn't. It was never good and usually ended with Hermione or Ron sneaking him some food when he was locked in his basement room.
I couldn't look him in the eyes. I was burdening him with my crap, issues I wanted to keep to myself, but once I started it was tough to stop. I didn't want him to pity me. A chilled hand tipped my chin up, but I didn't want to look at him. I kept my eyes looking down. Gasps came from the side of us, and I tensed. What did they think was going on? Draco let go of my chin and leaned down into my eye line, an understanding smile plastered on his face. He reached over the table for my hand as he straightened up, stroking my knuckles as he spoke comforting words about not deserving to be punished for being gay, and that I should talk instead of self-harm.
"Officially still Potter, but I don't mind either, I'm not ashamed of my family." Harry smiled sourly.
Snape stepped aside to let me past, and I tried to control myself as I walked in. He asked what was important, and I took a deep breath, explaining what Harry had implied. Snape’s eyes narrowed, saying that Harry should keep his nose out of other people’s business.
Before I could so much as breathe, he was grabbing his satchel on the way out of the door. My first feelings were anger and indignation, but that only lasted halfway through his shower before the fear sunk in. Draco was really angry. Like he might not come back. I recognise that he's overdramatic sometimes, but I think his emotions had just piled on. I can't imagine loving someone for years, finally having them, but still, they don't love you back. Or at least I haven't said I love him back, I was saving that for tonight.
His eyes narrowed, chilling my blood. "After everything we've been through together, all the fighting for our lives and shit that you brought on us, how could you do this to 'Mione and me? I don't give a rats ass about you being gay, you know that Harry, but why would you turn to him? Of all people? Someone who hates us, and has done nothing but pick on us since he first set eyes on us? Are you forgetting all the shit he's said to me, and the shit about my family? What about all the times he's bullied Hermione and called her a Mudblood? Or the times he's made fun of you for being an orphan? How can you kiss him?"
“Oh, you’re definitely my son,” Snape smiled comfortingly. “You see, my father wasn’t a muggle, he was a half demon, and so am I, which means…”
Malfoy chuckled at Harry's desperate nodding and pulled out slowly. He snapped his hips forward sharply, making Harry fight against his wrist-restraints. Harry wanted to touch himself and hold his lover closer, he wanted more intimacy. The thrusts became more erratic, and it was clear Malfoy was close. Harry pleaded to be touched, which his lover complied to with another smug chuckle. The turn-on of being shackled helplessly, with the sensations of a hand other than his own on his sensitive member and sweet spots he didn't know existed up his ass being stimulated meant when Harry came his vision blacked out, as he called out Draco's name. He didn't really notice when Malfoy stopped moving.
I couldn't look her in the eyes, I was ashamed to hurt her like I could tell I had. Her hands had gone limp in my grasp. When she pulled one away, I thought she meant to slap me, and flinched when she caressed my cheek. Gently she moved my head to face her, and she just smiled at me. It made me feel warm, knowing she was accepting me. We hugged for a moment before she scurried off for dinner. I knew I'd need to tell Ron and Hermione before they tried to push us together like they used to. Being put in that situation would only hurt Ginny more, and I didn't want that for her. I hoped my friends would be as understanding, as I rushed to pull a clean top on and prepare my speech on my way down the stairs.
"Darlings, leave the useless boy to finish his scrubbing," their mother called from the entryway. "We can leave as soon as he's finished, he's still needed to carry the bags."
I took a huge breath, trying to hold onto my courage as I knocked on Professor Snape’s door. When he answered the door, he was just in his trousers and shirt, with his shirt buttons open, flashing his torso. I nearly lost my breath, so I tried to focus on the clock behind Snape, rather than his body. Snape was shocked to see me and asked why I was even there.
The giant started strolling off, wandering the gardens and shaking his head. Harry didn't know what to do, he slowly rose to his feet but did know quite where to go from there. He didn't know if he should ask the man what he was looking for, worried he'd be disturbing his train of thought. But he pulled out his courage and spoke out.
"Not everyone's getting a happy ending. I already know we aren't, so what's the point? I'm not ignoring you, I'm going back to just not talking to you like before this stupid project."
The giant began mumbling to himself, counting on his fingers like he was marking off a list. But it seemed he was missing something.
"Thanks, Harry. I'll try to find the nerve to talk to her after the lesson. Professor Sprout won't mind me being a little late, especially if Benylin says-"
"Now babies, my word is law in this house. And he's done everything I asked," her smile was unkind as she turned back to Harry, pretending to consider his look. "Those frock and waist coats look familiar, wouldn't you say Dudley? And the gold lace, it's that same shade as that dress you asked the maid to throw out, right Phoebe?"
"Bad dream, and you weren't in bed so I'd thought you'd left me. But I'm okay now. You're still here."
“There you are babe,” Draco sighed when Harry came into the room. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you.”
Harry stormed off towards the courtyard, hoping he'd be able to spot his carriage and make a quick getaway. But he was forced to a halt as his wrist was held back. The prince pulled him back around, taking his hands and trying to ask what he's doing. Harry begged him to let go, reminding him that the omega had snuck out to come to the ball and needed to leave or he'd be in loads of trouble.
"I just can't believe the prince cancelled his party. He dances with one omega in the gardens and now he's found the man of his dreams," Pheobe frowned.
When he couldn't hear the music anymore, he stopped and took a moment to breathe. What had he been thinking, thinking he could just walk into a ball like this when he couldn't even dance? He'd also never been around so many people. He should just leave, forget waiting until midnight. He already felt like the magic of the night was over for him.
He led the way, clearly knowing the way better than me, but I guess as a Slytherin he could navigate this maze better than others. Lucky me. It didn't take long and looked like it was very close to our Potions classroom. My daydream swam in my mind, and I had to admit we had a shot if Draco would want to. I decided not to push him for more than kisses...and maybe some heavy petting,
"You don't have to back to those pitiful muggles. You can stay here with me, live with me. If you want to? I know this place is still a bit uninhabitable, but I'd love to have you here."
"You aren't really considering it, right mate?" Ron frowned, "I mean he's growing and shit, but last time he saw me he was as bad as always, so I doubt he'll have changed towards you."
“Hey dad,” Harry stressed the last word, wanting to be heard. “Or would you rather I didn’t call you that?”
Ron paled but stuck his ground. "I think you will. It said all eligible ladies or omegas. Harry is an omega, are you saying you'll take him with you?"
He smiled shyly. Honestly, the most beautiful smile. How had I never noticed how beautiful that smile is? We'd known each other for years, it just seems foolish of me to be so unobservant. He accepted my offer to stay with me, and I think he was flattered that I was showing so much trust after just a day. It was probably because I hadn't told anyone before this, but the way he was talking to me after finding out about how fucked up my life was, he was still standing next to me, he hadn't run after a day. So he had to care a little, right? And it was nice to feel someone care for you, after believing for years that they never would.
I woke up in the middle of the night, with Harry cuddled up to my side, and I smiled. For a very long time, I’d wanted to be with Harry, but I’d never thought I’d deserved him. He was gorgeous, smart, brave, and everything I could ever want. I reached out to touch his sweet face, and my left arm caught my eye. I stared in disgust at the Dark Mark staining my skin and put it back down. That’s why I didn’t deserve Harry, he was the Saviour of the Wizarding World, and I was an ex-Death Eater, he deserved better than me.
A tear ran down Nott’s face as he ran out of the room, leaving Draco with Harry, and slamming the door behind him. Draco asked Harry if he was ok, but kept his distance. Harry couldn’t help himself as he threw himself into Draco’s arms and sobbed, letting out all his pain from seeing Draco with someone else.
The omega blushed, meeting the prince's eyes with a small smile as he tried to relax. Draco guided him to a bench by the fountain, to enjoy the view and get to know the man he had his sights on. The omega looked more comfortable sat down, which made him feel a bit more comfortable. Draco took his hand again, enjoying the feeling of holding onto the other man. He asked a few questions, like his age and the things he enjoyed doing in his spare time. He asked about Harry's family and where he lived, and waited for the answer that seemed like it would never come.
It was a tough night for me. I woke in a fright at 2 o'clock in the morning and used my razor blade to calm myself down, but I was too awake to go back to sleep. I got back into my school robes and wandered into the common room. There was some parchment and ink on the coffee table, and I wrote a letter to Sirius. I considered taking it to the Owlery, but I knew Ron and Hermione would wonder where I was…unless I got back before they woke up. I checked the time and realised I could get there and back in time for them to get up. And it would save me doing it later.
I smiled down at it, scrunching it into a ball when Ron tried to sneak a peek. Part of me wished he hadn't sent the note because a private meeting with him was all I could think about during the lesson, and I had to make an excuse to Hermione, so she'd drag Ron off with her. I think she guessed I was meeting him, seen as everyone had heard about what Susan witnessed in the library. My palms were clammy as I made my way to Myrtle's bathroom. He was there before me, but I don't quite know how. He smiled as soon as he saw me.
All the eighth years were left outside for the first years’ sorting ceremony, and most of them were too nervous to speak. They were all worried about whether or not they’d be sorted into the same houses, but Harry noticed that Snape was right, it was mostly Gryffindors. Cho Chang and Markus Belby were the only Ravenclaws to come back, and the only Hufflepuffs were Justin Finch-Fletchley and Susan Bones. There was a fair handful of Slytherins, Gregory Goyle, Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson…and Draco Malfoy. Harry’s eyes stopped at Draco and stayed there. It was as if Harry’s world had shifted, and all he could do was stare at the gorgeous wizard only a few yards away from him.
The prince drops to his knee, grinning up into surprised green eyes. "I knew I would find you, no matter how long I had to look. My Harry, please do me the honour of being mine?"
It was strange. I woke up thinking I was groggy because I'd had less sleep. The room was colder, so I knew Draco wasn't in bed with me. This time I didn't panic, I was sure he loved me and I'd accepted I love him back. It was securing to understand how he felt, that if he loved me like I loved him then he wouldn't want to be without me. After a minute the haziness faded, and I could hear his tense voice from the next room. He sounded pissed, but the wood of the door muffled his words so they were incomprehensible. I only needed to open it a crack to hear what he was saying.
I nodded, not turning around. I didn't want him to see just how much him staying with me tonight meant. And the disappointment that he wanted to sleep in here. I may have been nervous about sleeping with him, but I was excited-nervous. But I told myself I wouldn't push him, so I won't.
There was only one shop Dudley felt comfortable buying things. The tailor measured him, lying that he was losing weight so he'd feel good and charging twice as much as other places because he needed twice the fabric. The whole time his mother would blather about how much he was like his father, 'robust' was the word she liked to use. Hardly, but that was the consequences when she always fed him sweets and meat at the click of his fingers. According to one of the older maids who'd met Uncle Vernon, Dudley acted like his father as well.
Removing his fangs, Draco pulled Harry's head back and tilted into his neck, "bite me, Harry. Bond with me. Make me yours too."
"Great, I've finished downstairs. And if you don't want me to have to start again, you should stay up there."
Harry smiled, he’d always thought Draco was an arrogant, stubborn asshole, and he can be but he’s also sweet, and caring and beyond loving. Harry couldn’t believe they’d been together for 7 months, even though Draco hadn’t actually told his parents. He wrote to them frequently, well his mother anyway, but never mentioned Harry. At first, Harry was worried about whether that meant Draco wasn’t really committed to him, that was until Draco made their relationship public. Now Harry didn’t mind, and he was actually trying to get Mrs Malfoy out of Azkaban early.
Parvati blushed beetroot and couldn't stop stuttering enough to answer, so Lavender stepped up. "It's just we heard Harry rejected Ginny because he's a gay (which made Ginny go an angry red, and me too for that matter), but we also heard Draco Malfoy's conversation with Cho, and he rejected her because he's a gay too. So, we were just thinking of you two together, now that he's one of the good guys. As long as he doesn't act like a dick."
"Just in case you were thinking I meant... sex, I wasn't. You were feeling guilty to kiss me earlier, I'm not stupid enough to think you'd be okay with...
He couldn't help smiling at her as he got back up, letting her excitedly rush him into the bath chamber. He considered asking to bathe himself because it was the first time Hermione would see him naked. But she was also an omega, and in respectable houses, omegas were cared for by their own. That was the reason Harry cared for Dudley and not Pheobe. So he silently stripped, while Hermione politely looked away, and sank into the water. She helped wash his back, and let him in on the secret she and Ron had. They'd suspected a party for the prince's birthday, and that he'd be looking for a bride, so Hermione had been working on an outfit for him. Harry almost cried he was so grateful.
She looked down to the stack of papers on her desk and I guessed I was dismissed. I picked up my box and left without another word. Looked like I'd tried harder with my gift after all. Malfoy wasn't taking this seriously, and Hermione made me. Where's the fairness there? I should have listened to Ron. Get him a little chocolate bar with a small place card that just said, "Sorry, not sorry". Would have been about what he deserved.
Professor Benylin let me into her office, but Malfoy wasn't there as I'd expected. Instead, she simply placed a large box with a card on her desk and asked for my apology. I handed over the box of chocolates and letter. It wasn't a small box, or just a collection box of chocolates, Hermione wouldn't let me be petty when I was apologising. It was like a hamper, without being in a hamper basket. It was an average-sized box filled with one of each kind of sweets from Honeydukes. ClassicGemini hadn't mentioned a favourite, so I just got everything. My box was bigger than his.
I laughed with him as I moved to let him sit up, agreeing to the idea for the fun of teasing my best friend. Everything was still up in the air, like where we went from our first date, but I decided to myself it was more fun if we rolled with it. For better or worse, this year was going to be different. And I was excited about the change.
Draco blushed, "You don't look too bad yourself. Anyway, you should wait to see what I'm wearing under this dress."
Draco stayed silent as Harry dressed, but couldn’t stay quiet for long. He begged Harry to hear him out, so he could understand why it was a bad idea. Harry turned to him, and slapped him right across the face, hoping he’d left a mark. Harry scowled that he was asking Headmistress McGonagall to move room, because he couldn’t stand the sight of Draco, and never wanted to speak to him again.
Harry rolled his eyes to the Heavens, praying for divine intervention. At that moment, Seamus headed towards the Slytherins and fell flat on his face. The eighth years burst out laughing, and Harry walked over to help Seamus up, with a huge grin covering his face.
I felt like an ass for saying it, but she huffed and left to have her lunch in the Great Hall. I kept going until I reached the kitchens, finding a cute picnic basket with red ribbons and flowers in Slytherin colours. Dobby was giving me major brownies points on this date. He gushed as he saw me, pleading for attention and panicking it wasn't good enough when I was too stunned to answer. But I was so happy with him I actually hugged him and Winky, thanking them and apologising I didn't have time to talk.
Warning for the smut, I've never written an alpha/omega thing before, and I kind of lost motivation a lot during this. It's taken like 3 separate sessions to get something this half baked done. I couldn't even be bothered to proofread it. So be a more little lenient with me please, I tried my hardest.
Harry was brought out of his thoughts, having his cousins and aunt glaring at him and the tailor subtly hiding behind a mannequin. Dudley thrust a bag into his arms, warning him to pay attention when they let him out of the house. He was already an embarrassment, he didn't need to completely shame them. Without getting a response, his cousin threw a tantrum, knocking the red frockcoat down and storming out. His mother and sister followed closely, walking passed his mess and leaving Harry to clean it as always.
He reached for the top book before it was scooped from the pile by a pale hand. Harry needed to breathe before he could bring himself to turn around, facing the blonde antagonist perched on a bookshelf behind him. A smirk pulled at Malfoy's lips as his dainty fingers turned the pages, and it took all the self-control Harry had to contain his anger and not punch the smug prick. He just carried the books off further down the aisle and continued his task. As impossible as it sounds, when the blonde spoke again, his voice was even smugger when he offered his assistance the second time. It snapped Harry's resolve hard, and he turned around to give the prat a piece of his mind. They were closer to each other than they'd first thought, and as Harry turned, his chest came into contact with Malfoy's. Harry immediately looked up to meet his eyes, almost instinctively. It was strange how he'd spent six years with the other boy, yet Harry was only seeing the molten silver in his eyes now. Malfoy seriously didn't have a single facial flaw, no freckles or blemishes, just flawless marble skin. And his lips looked so soft, with the sexiest curve.
Draco’s face went blank, as he just stared at Harry, trying to comprehend what he’d just been told. Harry was worried that Draco wasn’t going to say anything because that would just leave him uncertain. All of a sudden, Draco asked how far along, and Harry replied that he was about a month pregnant. Draco just burst out into a smile, and fell to his knees, nuzzling Harry's belly.
“Well, when I woke up this morning, I headed to the bathroom for a shower like I do every morning, and when I walked past the bathroom mirror, I noticed these wings sticking out of my shoulder blades, at first I thought I was seeing things, but then I felt them. Then my eyes started to go red, and I started to panic. That’s when I called you, but that woke Sirius up. I prayed in head for them to go away, so Sirius wouldn’t see them, and they were gone. As I started to relax, my eyes went back to normal, and just in time for him to storm in.”
I could hear the anger coming through in his voice, though I'm sure he was trying to stay calm. He backed away and looked into my eyes, searching for pain or panic people expect from victims. But I'd had worse happen to me than touching my cousin's...
"Suck on these before I start stretching your hole with them," Draco commanded, fingers in Harry's mouth.
Snape took Harry to a little café in Diagon Alley, where they sat outside in the sunlight, which smiled on them as they had left Grimmauld Place. At first, there was an awkward silence, two people who used to hate each other but became family minutes before, until Snape asked Harry if he’d heard about the eighth year for Harry’s year to do their exams. Harry had already sent back his acceptation letter, agreeing to go back to Hogwarts, and asking if Snape knew who else was going.
It was Ron. What was Ron doing here? But Draco was being really defensive, I could only imagine the glare he was throwing his way. And he mentioned Hermione's name, so she must be in my the living room too. But why? I heard her try to coax Ron out, but he must have stayed in place. There was a crash and I fully opened the bedroom door. I saw Ron flat on his back just outside the suite, and Hermione was rushing to him. Draco apologised and closed the door, turning to pause when he saw me.
"I didn't want to leave without seeing you were okay," Sirius frowned into my neck. "Why didn't you tell anyone you were so unhappy or whatever reason you hurt yourself over?"
He turned to look at me. He looked shocked and slightly disbelieving, but I just smiled. He grabbed me with the brightest smile I'd ever seen on him. He hugged me tightly, kissing all over my face, begging me to say it again. No matter how many times I said it, he wanted to hear it again.
For those wanting the traditional Cinderella story, you can stop reading now. For those who saw the Explicit tag and thought yummy, keep reading. The last chapter is literally a fluffy, short wedding and reception, then lots of smutty bonding stuff. But I've never written bonding smut, so don't expect too much.
Harry sat down next to Draco at dinner, and filled his plate with his favourites, making sure he brushed hands with Draco once or twice. Draco wouldn’t react to the touches, but his eyes would shift to Harry, who’d look down and smile. The next touch was halfway through dinner when everyone was focused on an incident at the Teachers’ Table, and Draco had some food in the corner of his mouth.
Harry didn't even pretend to understand what the beta was saying, so he rushed to the kitchens to collect the rat trap. Hermione asked what he was doing, concern colouring her voice, and without the words to explain he just had to pull her to the gardens by the arm.
No one had ever said things like that to me, never spoken to me with their heart on their sleeve and bare all for me to see. Saying everything he just did made him vulnerable, he was a Slytherin giving me a power over him I could abuse if I wanted to hurt him. He was trusting me so completely at this moment. I was too speechless to reply with anything that would be half as meaningful, so I pressed my lips to his in our first actual kiss, obviously excluding those to our bodies. My first proper kiss. His lips were like heaven to feel against mine, warm and soft and welcoming. He responded by peeling me off the wall and against him, his arms wrapping around my waist. I crossed my wrists at the back of his neck, playing with his silky hair. I just knew it would feel that soft between my fingers. His tongue grazed the parting of my lips, and I eagerly opened them in hopes of spreading our kiss. He tasted so good, like something a little sweet and a little sour.
Seven days they had been waiting for Draco to make an absolute fool of himself, and nothing had happened yet. By the third day even Blaise had to reach for his textbook and flip through the pages to the potion to make sure that he had in fact brewed it correctly. He read the instructions several times before frowning heavily, and reading through the footnotes and additional study sections just to see just what he could've possibly done wrong.
"Yes it is," he affirmed quietly, reclining completely into the sofa, his right hand twisting the silvery band on his left ring-finger. Hermione watched his actions, trying to figure out how she had missed the promise ring.
The Easter holidays were almost over, the next month would be swallowed completely by their NEWT's exams and then applying to numerous jobs over the summer to start building their paths in the world. He knew he should be over-joyed by the prospect of it all, but in all honesty it just left him feeling incredibly hollow. As though life was suddenly to fickle and meaningless at this point. It was another one of those things that he kept to himself, mostly because he didn't want to depress his friends with how morbid his own thoughts really were. Even as close as he had gotten to Draco in the months following Christmas, he wasn't sure that he could trust himself to find the right words.
The very next day they had gone out and purchased the collar and name-tag, labeling the hyper puppy as 'Seeker' for life.
In the end it was Pansy who came up with a plan and had thus appointed herself to be the one to approach Potter, despite the resentment that still hung between the two.
They'd moved into their London flat about two years prior. It wasn't as small and 'cosy' as Harry would have liked, but it wasn't as grand as either of their money could buy; it was the best way they'd been able to compromise. The walls were mainly a warm white colour, highlighting the dark wooden floors and the combination of comfy and bespoke furniture. The front door opened up into a small walkway which opened out onto a open-planned living area complete with moving photos, a flat-screen TV, and a pair of french doors that lead out to a wrought iron balcony that over looked the river. The fireplace was on the one feature wall that had a gorgeous resort sea-blue painted on it. The kitchen was separated from the living area with a wrap-around island, which Harry loved cooking at. The hallway lead down to a set of doors -the left leading to their bedroom and the right leading to their bathroom -and a black spiral staircase that lead up to their little glass attic addition which acted as a garden-come-astronomy room.
him to come home." He jerked his head away and glared down into the fire as it crackled and hissed by his feet.
And with that last final thought, Harry let the darkness engulf him, praying that he would remain on the lakebed where he belonged.
Panic was boiling in his head as he struggled to claw his way to the surface. Air had never seemed so far away. He was sure that the lake hadn't been that deep in that particular area –a long way down perhaps –but not too deep that he couldn't get out. He was desperate for air and could feel his lungs screaming in his chest, begging him for oxygen. He wanted to cry out but refused to let the last of his air escape. He pushed his body onwards, one arm stretched out towards the sunshine filtering down into his eyes. He kicked his legs in a frenzied manner as fast as he could, his muscles burning with the effort of moving through water, something he wasn't accustomed to.
Thankfully, the Sorting Ceremony was over rather quickly, welcoming the old and new students back and introducing Professor McGonagall as the headmistress, Slughorn had returned to teach potions and there was now a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who he couldn't be bothered remembering the name of. When the good appeared he picked at it and sipped at his pumpkin juice but barely ate anything. He was emotionally starved but his appetite for food had diminished almost entirely.
Draco had been the one to go the extra mile, of course. He'd heard that Potter had been asking -not to subtly -where the prefects bathroom was. He decided to take some action and sneak out of the Slytherin dorms to escalate the game. It was late and he'd been standing just down the hallway waiting patiently in a dark alcove, his grey eyes watching the door as he waited for Potter to finish doing whatever he was doing in such a big bath tub.
Draco glared up at the dark-haired man from over his shoulder before guiding his gaze back to the swirling amber liquid in his glass. "Don't taunt me with your jibes, I want to know what the bloody hell you think you're doing, just wondering in here at this time of night and thinking you own the goddamn place!"
He let out a soft sigh and turned to face the brunette as he whispered, "I swear Draco, you must be magical because I've fallen under your spell."
Harry had leant his face into the soft caress before turning to press his lips against Draco's palm. Draco bit the inside of his cheek, willing the small piece of affection not to deter him from his food. He had spent two hours preparing it. Oh, but the way Harry had taken the digit into his mouth and sucked gently, and flicked his tongue over the smooth ridges of his nails, he was lost. He erection was pressing so hard against his trousers that he was sure the zip would split in two. He stood up from his chair and walked around the table to where Harry was sitting before cupping his face in both hands and molding their mouths together in a hot, passionate kiss. Harry's lips were sweet with the tang of red wine. It only saved to make him more intoxicating.
He tried to sleep without the oil but some days it became difficult. He used the prefect's bathroom a few other times in the space of ten days, a little excessive, but most times it was only the showers. In that time he had started feeling like he had a little more energy, a little more drive to go to classes and do the best he could.
Draco bit down on his bottom lip before reaching up and slowly exploring Harry's mouth with his own. Harry whimpered as he broke the kiss but Draco merely smiled softly and stroked the sweaty black hair out of his eyes, "Just promise me one thing, Potter."
He seemed polite enough if even a little on the haughty side, but it was that smirk that enticed Harry to continue the conversation and slip his hand into the blonde man's hand and shook it firmly. "Harold Potter, but please just call me Harry. This is my first night in Paris and I'm not entirely sure where I should be or if there is anyone that I should be specifically talking to."
"Welcome to my world" Draco breathed dryly, as he wiped at his face with the cuffs of his sleeves. He sighed and breathed in deeply, "if you want I can ask the nurses to let you go for the weekend."
They broke apart and both of them were reluctant to shift away from one another. Harry rested his forehead against the blonde's and sighed shakily. "Nothing's going to change between us after this is it?" he asked, his mind over-turning with the possibilities of losing his friend.
On the 23rd of June Harry Potted had his photo taken for passing his exams and being employed full-time at the hospital. He even had to make a speech and got to meet the muggleborn doctor, Robert Koch, from whom his personal assignment had been based upon. To Koch he was simply a devoted fan still in University, but to Harry he felt like he were walking in a dream. Despite not having found a long term cure for TB or Consumption as it was more commonly known, the disease that Draco was currently suffering from, his salves and potions that he'd concocted with Healer Snape were selling all over Paris and preventing a lot of premature deaths, if only by a few weeks in some severe cases.
Harry closed his eyes and revelled as the information sluiced over him like soft, warm water. His lips twitched a little and he felt a single tear run down into his ear, "He's alive." It wasn't a question; it was merely saying the words aloud and making them twice as real as when Severus had said it. He felt the weight lift from his body and suddenly the world righted itself and the sun shone softly through the balcony windows and he could breathe a little easier.
Draco clenched his thighs together and panted heavily in the crook of Harry's neck, "are you sure baby?"
"Harry," Draco insisted firmly his eyes bright and serious, "I am perfectly well. Just let me have this, okay? No one will know and it's not like you haven't woken up in my bed."
Harry limply took one of Draco's hands in his own, laced their trembling fingers together and squeezed, "You've only ruined me for everyone else, Draco. I don't think that's going to matter anymore."
"Ah, Draco!" he moaned out as the blonde pushed another finger into his arse. It hurt a little, but having his cock sliding down a tight, wet throat was enough to make him dizzy with pleasure.
Pansy rolled her eyes but forcibly perked up when said blonde walked into the Great Hall with as much grace as he could muster, before dropping down at their table. The conversation flowed back to normal topics, the entire time, Potter and Draco kept sneaking glances at one another. It was getting on Pansy's nerves but she was doing her best to not let it bother her. Or at the very least, to not let it show.
Draco jumped as the door shut and then almost leaped out of his skin when something warm and thick curled around his shoulders. He panted heavily as he slipped his fingers over the tassels that tickled them and shuddered, not realizing how cold he had become. The blanket had been charmed to warm him more than the fire ever good, and the room seemed to hum in appreciated as it didn't need to use as much magic to keep the fire high and roaring. Draco swallowed thickly, his eyes prickling with hot tears for a whole new reason. He pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders and curled his legs beneath him, hunching over and sniffing loudly, "Thanks ... Potter."
Hermione huffed to herself, her hands planting themselves on her hips. "Well be quick and get dressed Harry, the sooner we take you back the better."
As soon as they were in their room Harry collapsed backwards onto the bed, sighing loudly, and arms flared out on both sides. Draco gave a soft, loving smile before removing the container of hot chocolate and balancing it on the small shelf that also held their coffee mugs, kettle and cutlery. He grabbed the kettle and went into the bathroom to fill it up. He quickly put the kettle on the boil and turned his attention back to Harry. The younger man looked exhausted. Draco twitched his mouth and lowered himself to his knees at the foot of the bed and busied himself with untying Harry's shoes.
Potter snorted with far too much confidence for a scar-headed idiot, and smirked up at the blonde, "Bring it on Malfoy!" he jeered loud enough for passers-by to hear. And so the challenge really begun with several eye-witnesses.
Draco smirked down at him and slowly kissed him, their tongues slipping together fiery and wet, sending pleasure running straight to Harry's cock as he thrust up. Leaning away, Draco pressed a kiss to the lightning bolt scar before leaning away and running his tongue down the muscled ridges and scars of Harry's torso before taking the thick cock in his mouth, right down to the hilt and making Harry jerk with a gasp. He sucked Harry down over and over again, breathing through his nose, before releasing him and sucking on his fingers. As he knelt down, almost out of sight, and ran his tongue over Harry's balls, he circled his finger around the tight puckered entrance of the brunette man.
None of us had recovered when we left the room, the puss covered girl bits scared and seared to my eyelids. I couldn't escape the images when I blinked. A group of Slytherins were laughing in front of us as we headed to lunch, a pointless exercise as I couldn't even hope to eat. Crabbe looked back to see us and sneered at me.
His eyes were closed tight, lips parted with the bottom one quivering. His face was pure pleasure. He opened his eyes, and I could see how good it was for him. I wanted to make him tense, so I asked if he was making that face because I was really tight around him. He closed his eyes, shivering a little. He told me to keep talking, that my dirty talk was turning him on. I didn't know what to say. He started to pull out and sink back in slowly. It hurt more, but I also felt good, there was more movement against that nice point.
Petunia snapped her head to them, face darkening to a glare, "I believe you just insinuated that we were ignoring royal decree."
Ron shook his head in disbelief. This was clearly something she'd had to repeat to him, but it must have happened a lot because Ron didn't protest or continue to insult Malfoy. He just smiled a little. A noise came from behind the door, like someone running up the stairs, and soon the door was swinging open. A bright and cheery Sirius was standing in the doorway with a huge grin on his face. He barrelled in and pulled me into his arms.
Harry stopped paying attention to the giant, mesmerised by the carriage. It was beautiful, the outside didn't even feel like pumpkin skin. It looked like a wealthy family's carriage, something a beautiful omega should be riding in.
A hand hooked under Harry's knee and lifted his legs apart, making him tilt back into Draco's body, and then he thrust forward. It was like a fire burning inside Harry's core, the full feeling and his alpha's moan behind him making him feel complete. All the hype suddenly made sense. They were joining in the most primal way, and it was perfect. Expect then Draco was moving back.
Harry blushes, moving forward again and looking back to his friends. The maid still had tears in her eyes, but she looked so happy it was hard for Draco to judge her for it. He was grateful someone cared for his omega so much, and he wanted to make sure they were provided for. They were part of the royal family now too. Blaise whistled, and the unit moved back towards the castle, and Draco took Harry to his new home.
By the time the lesson had finished, and Harry was in the Hospital Wing, he was so tense and tired, that he just wanted to go to bed. Madam Pomfrey was as attentive as usual but was under the assumption he’d had a Quidditch accident.
The three nobles started shaking their heads. Though Dudley looked decidedly shifty. Before Draco could convince himself it was rude to speak out and ask if they were sure, the alpha servant from before spoke up. He reminded the lady of the house that she did have a male omega servant in the kitchens, though she might have forgotten because they hadn't yet been served breakfast.
Sorry this took so long to get out. I would blame the broken laptop, but it was mostly the mental breakdown from not taking my meds that sapped away my motivation to finish this chapter. But here it is, and I feel ready to be reasonably organised about publishing the next instalments. Let me know what you think, lots of love for your patience.
His sweet omega grinned, pretending to think as he squeezed Draco's hand, "I will bond with you on one condition. I will be bringing Hermione and Ron with me. They have been my only support through the years, I can't leave them here with these people."
Harry smiled, leaving Draco to carry the huge cauldron, which turned out to be a problem. Harry was very strong, so lifting it wasn’t a problem, the problem was that he didn’t know where he was going. He asked Slughorn where he wanted it and was pushed in the right direction, but that meant he slammed into Draco. They both toppled over, and the Cauldron rolled off into the cupboard.
Draco blushed, "kind of. I made some chocolate sauce and got whipped cream from the kitchens. I thought, after a long day, you might want me for dessert. Though I made brownies as a backup."
“I’ve got Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts and Potions before lunch, then Divination, Care of Magical Creatures, Muggle Studies and Charms.” Harry smiled. “How about you?”
"We could take him with us, provided he meets a few conditions," his aunt grinned, making Harry's stomach sink. "You still have the rest of the house to clean, that will need to be finished. And my Duddikins needs you to help him get ready. If he does all that and manages to make himself presentable then, of course, he'll be coming. The invitation says so."
He replied, the bookmark glowed, but I couldn't look until I could breathe. Until I was calm enough to accept whatever words he wrote to reveal me. My hand stroked the spine as I gave in to the inevitable.
Harry woke up with a big yawn, stretching out, but not feeling Draco next to him. He opened his eyes, and couldn’t see Draco, not in his bed or Draco’s, but he heard the shower from the bathroom. Harry smiled, he felt a little sore, but happy, until he saw a note on his bedside time. He picked it up, no idea what it was, and read it’s neat familiar script.
He wrapped his arms around me from behind and blushed at the contact of his wet front to my back. He kissed the back of my neck and I melted into him. I turned around, pressing our torsos together as I reached up to kiss his sweet lips. He pulled back, asking if I wanted to sit up with him for a while. I nodded, not trusting my voice to not come out breathy. I sat down on the couch, and suddenly realised he'd only been wearing a towel. I averted my eyes so he could slip into some clothes. Any clothes.
“Are you telling me that someone left a one-year-old on a doorstep?” exclaimed Mdm. Hawks. “This will be added to your file and we will be investigating who did this.”
“It’s not like I wanted to go to the ball in the first place we were forced to go and I had to ask someone,” stated Harry trying to explain how he acted.
For the most time, the Dursleys rarely touched him. Yes, they took away food and he was locked inside his room a lot, but that was only for the summer months. While he definitely did not want to go back, he was not expecting such a severe reaction to what had happened to him.
“Since you are too old to perform a blood adoption, neither yours or Ethan and Ryan’s inheritances will change. But Harry, why are you trying to come up with reasons why we should not do this?” said Severus, seeing what Harry was trying to do, “We would love you to be part of this family and that is not going to change no matter what you say. But, it is still your choice if you accept our offer or not. If not, other arrangements can be made, don’t worry, you will not be returning to the Dursleys if you say no.”
And then it happened the most extraordinary thing that was going to happen in my life. I will probably never see this again. And nobody would believe it if I ever told anyone. Snape turned himself towards Ryan, who was sitting next to him and actually looked concerned.
After hearing this the only thing Harry could think of is that he will be spending 2 full days with the Malfoys. While he has never met Malfoy’s mother, he could only think she was the same as her family. He had been so lucky that he had been able to avoid Malfoy on those dinners in Hogwarts. Well, what was probably worse is that he would have to thank Malfoy. Without him, he would have never found out about what was going on. Oh, this is so frustrating!
“Heir Malfoy,” Harry said respectfully and quite nervously wringing his hand. If Serena had seen she would have given him a lecture about proper etiquette. Trying to make a good impression, Harry quickly remembered the sentences Serena had drilled into his head earlier today, “I wish to welcome you to our home”.
“I never received anything, I haven’t been to Gringotts since my first year.” Harry stated. Maybe he was left in the dark. He really felt stupid that apparently he had no clue about anything. Who would do this to him? He thought that a Hogwarts education prepared you for the real world. He sadly had to realize today that he knew almost nothing and if this did not change he was going to be completely lost. Maybe Malfoy was right and he did not know what would hit him when he left Hogwarts.
Feeling Harry’s magic reacting to his anger Severus quickly intervened, still recovering from his own shock of the absurd marriage contract, “Do not worry Harry they have made some unmistakable mistakes that will allow us to break this marriage contract quite easily.”
“Severus, is there a reason why this contract has turned light blue and not gone dark?” asked Harry looking up from his pile of papers.
There was another boy walking forwards looking very nervous, he had brown hair and piercing black eyes. All his other features were the same as Snape except for the nose.
“Ah mister Potter, I am glad you finally grace us with your presence. You are a hard person to track down. We have been trying to get in contact with you since your 14th birthday.” Exclaimed the goblin entering the room. “My name is Ripclaw and I have been the Potters account manager since your grandfather. What seems to be the problem here?”
When Harry showed up for breakfast the next morning, he was glad that no one mentioned what had happened that night. He did not think that he would have lived it down if Severus of Serena mentioned his moment of weakness. Today instead of doing homework in the morning it was decided that he would immediately start his etiquette lessons with Serena. He had a lot to catch up to and she thought it would take the entire day.
“In case you have 3 male children you as Lord will have the option to divide up the Peverell and Potter Lordship again and create two separate houses. The monetary details in case of a divide are already documented at Gringotts. In that case, the Peverell Lordship will be the most important one and go to your oldest. The Black will be the second most powerful and go to the second child and the Potter lordship will go to the third child. Of course, depending on how they have been managed over the years this order can change.
I am looking for a beta-writer. Not to actually do spelling and so, but to help me with some decisions and dialogues. Sometimes I can get stuck (as I was here), as to how everything should go.
“And please call me Draco, after all, uncle Sev is my godfather.” Turning his head slightly, taking a small peek at Severus standing on the other side of the hallway.
Casting tempus, Harry reorganized his papers before standing up and going to Severus’ office. After knocking, he entered and sat down, laying out his papers in front of him.
“Of course Mr. Potter, that is absolutely no problem,” she said before conjuring some vials and handing them to Severus.
"We have a problem." said Albus Dumbledore, without twinkle in his eyes and with a sad tone. “After many complaints the past year the Ministry has decided to investigate the full staff. This has sadly let to me having to let Hagrid go from his position as teacher of Care of Magical Creatures. Since Hagrid never graduated from Hogwarts, he was deemed unqualified for teaching our students.
“Harry we don’t know what they have been doing with your key or if there are other things going on such as marriage contracts. Hiding someone’s inheritance is one of the biggest crimes, besides line theft and blocking a mate bond.” Neville stated reassuringly. They would get to the bottom of this.
"I wanted to keep them out of the war, but I do not think that will work any longer, seeing todays situation."
Tens of meters before the entrance professor Snape stopped and turned around, “normally I would have apparated inside the entrance hall, but since you are not keyed into the wards that is not possible. I need you to stand still for a few minutes to allow me to key you in,” stated professor Snape.
Seeing the doubt in Harry, Severus inserted, “Am I right Mdm. Hawks that everything that will be stated here will be confidential and not be accessible to the general public?”
That night Harry went to bed after reading the first few chapters of his books and doing some meditation. The one thing he knew for sure is that clearing his mind was not his thing.
“Finally” Harry exclaimed entering the dorm room “I was able to get away from Ron and Hermione as Hermione wanted to do some last minute revision before the holidays. What did your grandmother reply? Can she help?” Harry asked getting nervous and excited at the same time.
“At least we now know who would be next in line to become your magical guardian. We will suspend the meeting for half an hour while we get in contact with Severus Snape. I would advise you to grab some lunch as it is already past lunchtime” Ripclaw stated already writing a summons to Severus Snape.
Feeling the uncomfortable silence that had fallen in the room, Draco decided it was time to change the subject. “So I heard that uncle Sev might adopt you?”
“One more announcement before we start class. Normally in your fifth year, the third year of this class, there are no theoretical classes, but I have read what you have done these past two years and you are behind. Because of this you have the possibility to either learn this on your own or come to the extra review class once a week. In there you will see what you should have seen these past 2 years at a rapid speed. Sign up sheets are posted in your common rooms.”
“You will also be expected to behave according to someone of your status, which means no more pity insults and stupid school rivalries. You will be respectful towards everyone, there will be no shouting and you will have to control your anger. I am also aware that your school grades in most of your classes are average at best. This will need to be improved, this is your OWL year and if you don’t score well enough at the end of the year a lot of courses will no longer be available to you next year. If you have any trouble with any coursework you let us know and we will make sure it is no longer a problem.”
After that, the sound in the Great Hall went up. It only quieted down when the prefects led their house towards their common rooms.
“Now to continue, while you were being seen to, I looked through your account records and as you probably know the monthly money transfer to your guardians is still going on, you have yearly taken money out of your vault for the past 8 years and again at the beginning of each school year.” Ripclaw continued.
Next he opened the presents from Neville, giving him an ancient looking scroll on dueling techniques. From Luna he received stationary materials with for both the Black and Potter house. Both had written him a short letter wishing him a merry Christmas and looking forward to seeing him tonight at the ball. Knowing both of them would be in attendance helped settle some of Harry’s nerves.
This shocked the entire hall and Harry saw Ryan take a quick glance in the direction of Professor Snape, like he was scared about what his father would think. Then to his big surprise, Snape smiled in the direction of his son and even looked proud.
And before Harry knew it was time to go to bed, too tired to care much about what tomorrow would bring.
Taking the offered hand, Harry corrected with a small smile on his face, “Well technically it is Heir Potter-Black”.
“What are you talking about?” Harry asked getting really confused. What the hell is Malfoy talking about? Me being a lord? He must probably have misspoken. And what was happing this summer, did Hogwarts provide extra classes to prepare students for their OWLs? He knew for certain that he did not receive any mail about something going on during the summer otherwise he would have gone. Did Malfoy just complement Neville for showing up? But that would mean that Neville was invited to these summer meetings. Maybe he can tell me what the hell Malfoy is talking about.
“Harry don’t worry we will sort all of this out.” Neville stated. Harry was actually very surprised how confident and strong Neville sounded. Normally it was him that had to give courage to Neville, but it looked like this time it was he who needed the support offered. Seeing Neville’s owl fly away he just hoped that they would get their answers very soon.
“Harry, when you are finished please follow us to my office and we will be explaining what will happen from now on.”
“But that’s impossible, your guardian should have informed you at 13 and you should have also received a letter from the Ministry.” Neville exclaimed, getting more outraged as the conversation moved along.
“Good Harry, are you ok?” Neville replied looking up. But for the first time, he saw that Harry looked both confused and even a bit nervous. Like he was afraid to ask something, or maybe he was afraid of the answer?
“As you might have noticed in the mornings, we expect you to finish any homework you have been given and to study any material that is necessary for your classes. We will be checking your homework to see if it is satisfactory and if not, you will be doing it again. In the afternoons and when you are finished with all your homework, you are normally allowed to do what you like, as long as you behave. In your case, you will probably have very little free time since I will be using the afternoons to catch you up on everything you should know as an heir and lord in training.”
For each of the properties, a specific file is included that lists all the material and human assets on the properties. Some properties had 15 house-elves, while others had rare Abraxans. There were properties that were fully furnished and had a gigantic library, while others were in a state of decay.
After eating lunch Harry was guided to the home library by Severus. Entering he could imagine this room would be a dream for Hermione. The Prince library was as big, if not bigger than the library in Hogwarts, but it seemed like it had a bigger variety of subjects. Harry did see that the books on creatures, potions, and DADA were represented the most but that did not limit the collection the Snapes’ had in other subjects.
"Well, she has two sons who will need to be transferred to Hogwarts. One of them will be first year, the other third year."
Turning around Severus stated: “You are free to use most books in the library for your personal studies. But at the moment you are not yet allowed to touch any of the books in that section” stated Severus pointing at the last 6 shelves on the left side of the library. “There is an alarm spell placed on those books, so we will be notified if you try to take them.”
Taking a deep breath, Severus started, “so, as you know I have been made your magical guardian, that means that at least for the Christmas holidays you will be staying here. Before I will go into what will be happening during the holidays, I have found it appropriate to inform you of what is expected of you while in this house. All our children have the same rules, so it will be expected of you to also follow them.” Started Severus.
“Well, uh, um, Luna and uh, um…” “Ryan how come you haven’t made any friends? Are you concerned about something?” asked Snape, really concerned now.
“Yes, females cannot inherit a lordship. They can hold the proxy seat until either the male heir is old enough or until a male heir is born. How much access the females get to the inheritance is based on the arrangements made by each individual house. For example Mdm. Longbottom holds the Longbottom proxy until her grandson is old enough. Mdm. Bones also holds the proxy seat till her niece Susan has a male son. But it is never sure because the lordship of her husband if he has one, will take preference. And the Bones lordship can only be transferred if the husband agrees that one of his children or his only child will receive the lordship.”
“So he does not makeup really stupid rules, is very strict and insults you when you do something wrong?” said Harry unbelieving that Snape could act like a normal person.
"He will have to be sorted with the first years and can follow classes with the third years, but if we see he is not up to their level he will have to be lowered a year. Both sons will have to stay in their dorms and will have curfew as everyone else. If this is all ok with you, you have the job."
“Harry, there is nothing wrong in asking someone just because you have to. It happens quite often that people ask dates just because it is required. The problem is how you went about it and how you then treated her,” started Serena, trying to get Harry to understand what he did wrong.
“I made lots of new friends, the people in Slytherin are really nice and of course with Luna and Harry.” said Ethan.
“The fact that you asked her last minute would have probably tipped her off on the fact that you were just asking to get a date. Not only that but you also asked a date for your friend which makes it quite obvious. But you should have told her that you had issues with dancing so you both could have worked on that. By not showing an effort you embarrassed yourself and her. And if that was not bad enough, you ignored her for the rest of that evening not even returning her to her dorm room like any gentleman. And if that wasn’t enough you had to have a fight about another girl,”
“No clue, the Weasleys bought my school stuff this year” Harry shrugged, what was wrong with that. The first three times they just gave him the money so he could buy his things. And because of security reasons they bought all his things this year. It’s not like there is anything wrong with that is there?
Not answering, Malfoy said: “Did you hear the news yet Potter? The big oaf finally got fired. The ministry did an investigation and it seems like he was never even allowed to teach to begin with.”
“My name is Gornuk, what do you need of us today?” said the goblin entering the room after a few minutes.
Both the Weasleys and Dumbledore were at Grimmauld Place when the Daily Prophet was delivered at breakfast. The Weasley family, Hermione, and several Order members were staying at Grimmauld Place for the holidays. Let’s just say that Sirius was not happy when he found out that Harry would not be joining them. When asked why, Dumbledore told him that Harry was invited, but had preferred to stay the holidays with the Longbottoms. While Sirius knew Harry was friends with the Longbottom heir, he did wonder why Harry had not sent him an owl himself.
Arriving he saw that only he and Dean had signed up from Gryffindor. Other than them there where 3 Ravenclaws, including Padma Patil, and 4 Hufflepuffs, three of them were Hannah Abbott, Susan Bones and Ernie Macmillan. From Slytherin only Daphne Greengrass, Blaise Zabine and Theodore Nott showed up.
Turning back to Harry, Severus handed him the potion saying, “Harry, you can take one gulp from this and it will help you fall back asleep”
“Harry, I know you mustn’t fully comprehend what you saw this evening. But sometimes who we truly are, is not who people think we are. That must probably be too complicated for you to fully understand.” said Severus closing the door.
Severus took hold of Harry’s shoulder before guiding him to the appropriate room. They both received a quick “enter” after Severus knocked on the door once.
“Godfathers, like Sirius, did for the Black lordship, have the possibility to transfer their lordships to their godsons if they themselves don’t produce an heir. The ritual that is done after a godfather is chosen, mixes some of the blood of the godfather with that of the godson. This allows a lordship to be transferred. This is a very extreme measure and is normally only done in case the godfather is unable to reproduce.” Finished Severus, hoping the explanation had been sound.
When dinner was finished and all plates and leftover food disappeared, Professor Dumbledore stood again.
They quite some time going over the table manners before continuing on to the proper personal interaction. He learned proper greetings for when Harry would be introduced to people and how he had to interact differently with his peers compared to the adults in the room. But even then, he was required to act differently depending on the station of each person. He quickly realized that the way Malfoy had acted in first year was actually normal and it was he who had not replied appropriately. Furthermore, when last year’s Yule ball at Hogwarts was brought up Serena was horrified on how he had treated Parvati Patil.
“I just want to say one more thing before you can all go off to your common rooms, to prevent speculation. Professor Moonlight and Professor Snape are married. For your convenience it was decided to call Professor Moonlight by her maiden name to prevent confusion.” said Professor McGonagall.
“Harry, I am not asking you to be best friends with her or to have a do-over. Once you have sent your apology and miss Patil has responded, there is nothing tying you to each other,” explained Serena.
“Well, they are … Wait you have no idea what I am talking about?” Neville exclaimed. Could Harry really have no idea what he was talking about? But, but, that was illegal. How could someone do this?
Looking at the file Harry mentioned, Severus replied, “Since this is a four-way contract the contract between Lupin and Black and maybe even Pettigrew is still valid. It has turned blue to show that it is no longer valid for a member of the Potter House. When you find this contract in the Black files it will show as normal, but James’ name will have turned light blue.”
“I know, Harry. For what you have told me from your home situation, I would be extremely surprised if they send you back there. And believe me when I tell you that I will do anything to make sure that you do not end up there again,” stated Severus.
“I will most likely have a veela inheritance, as most Malfoy’s across history have had that inheritance,” explained Draco, before turning back to Ethan.
“Magical guardian? I have never heard of one. Do you know who it is? And I have not received any owls besides some birthday presents from my friends.” Harry exclaimed. How is it possible that no one ever told him who his guardian was? Could this mean that he did not have to go back to the Dursleys? He really hoped so. But while some hope started to rise in Harry the feeling of betrayal also increased. It was impossible that Neville is the only one that knew about it. Ron and Hermione definitely also knew about this and never mentioned it. Maybe they just thought he already knew? He did not know, what he did know is that he would get to the bottom of this and everyone that hid this from him would pay.
“As you can see, the top of this section mentions the standing orders that we canceled when we visited Gringotts,” said Severus, starting to go over every withdraw and deposit of funds since the Potters were alive.
After reading the paper he was in complete shock, but it quickly turned into anger when he saw Dumbledore entering the dining room.
“I uh,…” mumbled Ryan again looking at his feet. It was clear that Ryan wasn’t going to answer the question.
Arriving at the dining table it was clear that Severus and Serena would have preferred to sleep another hour of two. Seeing Harry enter the dining room, Ryan jumped from his chair, almost knocking over his glass of orange juice in his excitement.
“And what about the Dursleys? Will I need to go back there?” Harry asked hoping this would give him a way to never go back.
Well that made it perfectly clear how Ron thought about him. Harry was still hurt by that fact that the letter did not ask him how he was at any point. It just went on and on about Harry needing to do what he said and contacting Dumbledore. One thing Harry knew for sure was that he was never turning to Dumbledore again and he was never going back to the Dursleys. Seeing that the present attached was candy, Harry decided to throw them away, not trusting Ron to not have spiked them with anything.
Harry nodded. The plan was that Sirius and Remus would drive him to King’s Cross Station, where Severus would meet him to wish him luck before apparating to Hogsmeade ahead of the train to get something before he went to Hogwarts. Sirius grabbed Harry’s trunks and they headed down the stairs. Remus greeted Harry with a note and a cage. The cage contained a small snowy owl, and it reminded Harry of Hedwig. But he’d already got a new broom off them, and even Severus had already given him something, a potions book.
Harry’s friends were stunned by the name, and it just got worse after they read the note. Hermione could see Malfoy’s attitude in the note as she read it, and the boys agreed. Ron asked why Harry hadn’t thrown it away, seen as it was a gift from Malfoy.
I was stunned. I hadn't suspected the depth of his feelings, and they seemed to heal my soul slightly. The kind of feel I get when he kisses me, or smiles just for me. But I was frightened. I didn't think I was quite at that point, I was falling but I hadn't fallen. And I knew I didn't deserve him, so how was I supposed to deal with this. Snape's opinion of me was right, not the stuff about being a money grabber and that, but that I was a burden.
Harry blushed scarlet as everyone raised their glasses with a cheer, some nobles wearing a particular knowing smile. He'd never thought that when he lost his virginity a room full of rich people would know exactly what he was doing. But when his alpha looked down to him with an apologetic smile, that was all Harry needed to feel soothed. It became obvious that it didn't matter what a room full of random people thought because he had Draco. And they were finally going to bond together. Hermione's secret book showed its usefulness immediately when the couple were alone, and Draco handed Harry a small vial.
And I tried, really tried. But when I drifted off, my mind was back on those lips, and the mystery of who they really belonged to. Not on how they'd feel or anything. Totally not. Man, I need a girlfriend.
"Harry! Are you alright? What the hell was that?" He panicked, grabbing my arms and looking me over.
Draco stripped Harry’s clothes off too, and when they were both standing there in their underwear, Draco asked Harry if he was sure he wanted to go through with sex, seen as Draco didn’t mind, but Harry nodded and removed his boxers, so Draco did the same. They kissed each other again, and Draco lightly pushed Harry back on the bed and crawled between his legs. Harry smiled up at him, positive that as long as Draco was happy, then Harry would do anything.
Draco squared his shoulders, holding his father's gaze and standing his ground. "The party was over. I was told I needed to find someone, and I have. I care so deeply, after so little time, that I'm certain I've imprinted on him. He's the one, I feel in my soul just from holding his hand. I tried to stop him from leaving, but he was so determined. But I'm just as stubborn, I will find him again and I will marry him. Regardless of what you have to say about it."
Harry nodded, pondering what house he’d get sorted into, because in his first year the Sorting Hat wanted him in Slytherin, but he protested. Maybe if he didn’t protest, and honestly didn’t care if he was in Gryffindor again, the Sorting Hat would put him in Slytherin. The tea they’d ordered came over, and Harry remembered his ordeal that morning.
"Okay students, this week we're actually learning something. Apparently, this topic isn't taught in most wizarding schools, which is abhorrent because it's an important health lesson. So today," Professor Benylin winked. "Is sex education."
Harry buttoned up his shirt and left with his tie and his robes over his arm. He was heading out of the Common Room when Ron and Hermione caught up to him, asking why he looked so angry. His eyes had gone red. Harry explained on the way to the Great Hall, leaving out certain details of last night, and what Draco had said this morning. Ron asked if Harry wanted him to kick his ass because he’d taken advantage of his best mate.
The hallway was different. It was very dark and long. I recognised it after a while, partly by the covered painting of Sirius' mother. I leapt out of the twins' arms as Sirius walked out of the drawing room, and grabbed onto him. He hugged me back just as fiercely, pressing down my back as I whimpered quietly. Uncle Vernon really overdid it this afternoon. Sirius peered at me, but relaxed when he saw me smiling. Hopefully, that would be enough to keep my reaction unsuspicious.
“My dad wants to talk to me,” Harry smiled. “Nothing to worry about, just save me a seat at lunch ok?”
"I'm happy I found you too, my Harry." Draco smiled, "but we need to get to the castle. So I can get you settled and plan the wedding as soon as possible."
"So you want me to tell you how this feels, how much your big dick stretches me out, and how good it is?"
"This just doesn't feel right Harry," he worried, biting his lip, and killing the mood. "Just because you say it's fine now doesn't mean it will be when we're doing it. I just don't want to hurt you, I want to be the one to make you feel better when you're hurt. You know, your shoulder-to-cry-on and all that mushy shit the Hufflepuff girls are talking about. 'Rivals brought closer with love' or some crap like that. I don't just want to take advantage because you're inexperienced and probably looking for someone to help you change your views on what sex is after what's happened to you. You might be thinking I'm making a huge deal out of nothing, but I could have been in shoes like your's if Snape's potion hadn't have worked, so when you strip off that Gryffindor courage I can imagine the pain that's there. You don't need to hold on to that brave face with me or hide your pain, I want to see when you're vulnerable because then I can help you feel strong again. I told you in the library about pushing my luck, and I'm doing it now. I want to be someone special to you."
Harry turned away and ran, hoping he could hide before Draco caught up with him. He turned the corner, and fled into the hospital wing, hoping Draco hadn’t seen him go in. He sunk to the fall as he heard Draco run towards the door, and sighed as the footsteps carried on. He couldn’t believe that he’d let Draco use him. He’d believed the bastard when he denied it 7 months ago, and now he wished he hadn’t believed him. He felt a soft hand on his shoulder and jumped up to see Madam Pomfrey’s concerned face.
There was silence in the room as Harry and Snape stared at each other, neither one of them saying anything. Snape looked at Harry, really looked at him, and his mind wondered as he looked at his son, his flesh and blood. He smiled at Harry, who looked at him in shock. He’d never seen Snape with emotion on his face, it was usually impassive and plain, a spy hiding his thoughts.
"I hope you don't mind I left, just wanted to make sure I had clean clothes for tomorrow and something to sleep in, this room's a bit chilly."
The prince was ready to burst, even if this boy wasn't his omega, it angered him that the woman spoke that way about her own flesh and blood. There had been times when he argued with his father, and the king had said similar cruel things just to upset him. It was a torment to hear family talk about you that way. And he was sure the omega didn't deserve it. But before he could unleash his wrath, the wind blew a familiar scent under his nose.
“Ok, what time will they be coming tonight?” Harry wondered, already thinking about what he would be doing the rest of the day. He would probably spend some time going over the appropriate etiquette before hanging out the rest of the day with Ethan and Ryan.
At a quarter past five, Harry stood ready in between Serena and Ethan in the receiving room. Harry was wearing an emerald green dress robes with gold trimmings.
