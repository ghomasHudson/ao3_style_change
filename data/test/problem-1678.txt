Draco supposed that his feelings did matter. Draco knew that he’d fallen for Harry and knew that every day their lives enmeshed just that little bit further, he fell ever deeper. He couldn’t help it. Draco wanted to tell Greg that he wouldn’t let himself be hurt, but Draco hadn’t ever been that clever. Not when it came to Harry Potter, anyhow.
After, Harry watches Draco get ready. He leaves Other Harry in bed and walks to the bathroom across the landing, emerging five minutes later, coiffed and perfumed — but not wearing the Healer nor the Unspeakable robes. Harry decides this is the mystery he must solve today.
“None of that matters,” Harry said, sounding sure of himself. “None of it at all. I’ve thought about nothing else since Café Quendryth. I want to be a father to our child. I don’t give a stuff about the
“Fucking hell,” Harry answered, shaking his head like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Gregory fucking
"What's with you and buckwheat?"
"Can't be easy," Ron says.
His 'bedroom', Harry learns, is actually a series of rooms with an honest to god parlour with velvet upholstered wingback chairs and a chaise lounge, a study lined with bookcases and featuring a massive desk, then the actual bedroom, and an adjoining bathroom. The bedroom has three gigantic windows facing the gardens and a huge bed underneath hovering constellations that, coming closer, Harry sees are made from real crystal.
to speculate on your sordid love triangle."
Draco was pleased that Harry was being so candid. Like every other wizard in England he’d heard of James Potter, of how he and his wife had sacrificed themselves for Harry.
Harry cut him off, mid-flow. “Don’t talk bollocks, Draco Malfoy,” he said, his green eyes glinting, dark and annoyed. “You should have
There’d been the rancid stink of defeat, and the angry chants of furious fans, ringing deafeningly in his ears.
Draco squeezes his hand weakly. "Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm feeling?"
"Fava beans are just broad beans. And you'll find out all about escarole at lunch."
To Draco’s surprise, Harry didn’t say Half-Moon Place. Instead, he said Grimmauld Place. Draco winced. Floo travel left him feeling like he’d been hit with a Jelly-Brain Jinx at the best of times, and now he would have to endure twice the journey. After a few moments of being flung and twisted through London’s Floo network, the lounge of Grimmauld opened up before them.
“I— err, do either of you know where I can find Draco Malfoy?”
fight."
They go to warehouses with rows upon rows of carved wooden bed frames and Harry falls in love with a gigantic white frame carved with flowers and buys it on the spot, forgetting his mattress is too small. So Malfoy takes him to a mattress shop where they serve Harry tea and Harry buys a larger mattress and six goose down pillows that feel like heaven, or even better than heaven, based on what Harry has experienced of it.
"As if you'd let me forget."
"Git. He was finally warming up to me. It's taken fourteen years. Progress you ruined in one fell swoop."
Harry swung to his help, understanding intrinsically the dilemma that Draco found himself. He gestured to Victoire, and the witch slid down from her chair and went to sit on Harry’s knee. “Draco
weeks ago! And you’re only just telling me now?”
"Have you been keeping up with the trials? His testimony is very well spoken," Hermione says.
Pansy made an incoherent noise. “Fuck, Draco!” she exclaimed. “I thought you’d Firecalled to gossip about some new bloke that you’d managed to snag and shag,” She snorted, inelegantly. “Though you obviously managed the shagging part without any difficulties.” All of a sudden Pansy pulled a face. “Oh, Draco,” she asked, suddenly abrupt. “Is it Cormac’s baby? You told me that you were finished with him, forever! That wizard is an utter blockhead Draco, and he made you feel as low as a worm-“
"Must be hard, having Lucius Malfoy as your dad," Bill says, bouncing Victoire on his knee.
Draco Malfoy is objectively beautiful. Harry can’t say he has ever considered it before, but he can’t deny it now. Not after what he’s seen.
Draco made a firm decision. He’d let Harry have his Sunday, let him have his hangover and his lazy brunch with the Weasley-Grangers. Then, on Monday, he would send Orpheus, his Eagle owl, flying over to Twelve Grimmauld Place.
Feasibly, Mediwitch Hayes was used to tears, and unashamed scenes of emotion because she didn’t seem at all daunted by the sight of weeping wizards in her examination room. She handed Draco a tissue, before flicking her wand in a circular motion.
"Yeah, three Sickles at most."
"'M not worried," Malfoy mumbles, pulling Harry's arm around to his chest.
"Wait until you taste it, Potter. Some cabbages are infinitely better than others."
"Oh good, helping then. Send a quick cooling charm at that pan will you? I can't fill the pasties while it's hot."
– and he quotes from it non-stop. Man’s basically a total pregnancy Griffindork. He’d have had the baby for me, had it only been possible or allowed.”
bloody Harry Potter. He wanted to be involved? Wanted to be there for him, and their baby? Draco found that very hard to believe. The problem was, Harry’s words made him feel optimistic. They made him feel hopeful, and hopeful was dangerous when it came to Harry.
Draco gets the coffee started, using the French press he convinced Harry he needs for entertaining, and gets down the tea as well, for Harry. Harry seemed to like the chai tea Draco ordered for him, a gesture which did not result in a fight about Harry's heritage. He's not sure what the difference is, between giving Harry chai and making him dal makhani, possibly Harry has just given up on Draco in that regard. Or possibly Draco got something right. Or possibly Harry is just a sucker for spiced teas.
"Sounds nice," Harry says, just as the timer rings.
"It's rough sometimes, mostly I wish there weren't so many late nights. But yeah, I do like it. Feels good to help. Feels important."
“And then, what?” Draco asked, incredulous.
"Never had a fresh fava bean."
"I still maintain that I shouldn't have to feel like a piece of shit to prove myself worthy."
Malfoy pulls out another bolt, this one with cartoon renderings of Harry holding a broom, a wand, a cauldron, an owl.
"Nothing."
Harry lets himself be held by his two best friends, profoundly relieved and grateful that they'd go anywhere with him and that now they want him to go anywhere with them.
Harry holds his hands up. "Alright, alright, Merlin. You make the rock cakes and I'll bring everything to the gazebo, yeah?"
"I hear you," Ron says, holding up the last slice of pizza to see if Harry wants it.
"It's fascinating," Hermione starts, explaining to Harry and Ron the intricacies of a Sanskrit-based magical language until Harry forgets about Malfoy.
"Oh."
“Would you like a drink?” Draco asked, ever the perfect host. “Tea? Pumpkin Juice?”
"Malfoy. Who else?"
He’s tempted to reply, to explain that it isn’t that simple, but he realises there’s no point. This Other Harry
Bobbing tendrils of white cup shaped flowers in floating planters above the door caress their heads as they walk through the cloudy film. Which honestly, Harry finds a bit creepy. He doesn't want to be caressed by vines every time he walks into his bedroom. What if he forgets to water them and they decide to strangle him instead?
“You’re beautiful,” Harry repeated, staring at Draco and stroking his fingers ever-so-softly over his middle. “You’re beautiful, and you’re pregnant, and I love you. I’m in love with you, Draco Malfoy.”
One of the candles has burned low and flickers out, leaving them in decidedly romantic dim lighting. Harry's palms are sweaty now. What if the drunk kiss was Harry's best effort? Suppose he's always a sloppy kisser. Malfoy probably isn't. He's probably a very not-sloppy kisser, like when he cooks, every movement smooth, nothing wasted.
"That we kissed?"
Ron comes up behind Harry and puts an arm around his shoulders, steering him toward the floo. "That's good news, Harry," he says, calm and sure, "Stable they said. Stable is very good. And Healers aren't like Muggle doctors, breaking one thing to fix another, Malfoy will be good as new, you'll see."
“Oh, but they don’t know that. I got sent home yesterday,” Other Harry grins, “I could be terribly unwell.”
"Well, er, about that," Harry says, "I actually quit the Aurors."
"I never thought you'd be so obsessed with cabbage."
I was a complete and utter shit to Longbottom. I know I did awful things, okay? I simply refuse to live the rest of my life making myself ill over them. I cannot change my past actions, all I can do is be better going forward. Satisfied?"
“It is what it is,” Harry answered, the two of them stepping towards the Diagon Floo entrance in the St Mungo’s Atrium. “I’m not ashamed to have made a baby with you, Draco, and I’m not about to deny their existence, not even for a day. People aren’t stupid. They’ll know you didn’t make your baby all by yourself. I mean, yes, we might be wizards but we can’t change the fundamental tenets of magic-”
"This is the most old bitty table I've ever seen."
Other Harry grins. “That I am.”
the next day. Draco heaved a sigh, and flicked off his wireless. Harry was a free agent, and there wasn’t much point in feeling jealous.
"Yes. You fought the good fight," Malfoy says, and surprisingly it doesn't sound sarcastic.
Harry broke first. “Alright,” he answered. “Have you got something? It’s just- I haven’t, and the charm-”
"Thank you," Malfoy says formally, "How very kind of you."
Tesco?"
“Why not?” Draco said, eventually nodding his agreement to the plan. “It’s a date. Mark your diary, Potter. A Malfoy is going to step over the threshold of the Weasley household and break bread with them. A momentous occasion. One for the history books.”
"I'm here as security, I'm not your personal spell assistant."
Me, writing this chapter: hoo boy, am I /sure/ this is how I wanna fuck w canon? And the answer is, yes, Harry deserves good things from the adults in his life, actually.
Funny how it only takes one small event to change the mood of the entire day.
Harry reaches a hand out and lightly hit the girl. “Hermione, I think that’s the first time I’ve ever seen him truly smile.”
“Dumbledore is dead, yes. But McGonagall says not to worry, that everything is under control. She says Snape is still on our side which—I don’t understand either, Ron. But I trust Minerva. And you should all, too. She and Harry are working on something. Like I said, I think that both the Order and the Death Eaters are getting ready to be making their final moves. And now, unfortunately, I am caught up in whatever scheme you children are figuring out. You seem to be starting and stopping all of these different plans all over the place. And it would probably be irresponsible of me to just let that go and pretend like I didn’t notice what’s going on. So I will be honest with you if you will be honest with me. What are you planning right now?”
His family was another thing, wasn’t it? There was still no response from his parents about the news of his obliviation. Personally, Draco thought it was a tad important and, well, jarring to say the least. But it seemed that his parents had nothing to say on the matter. It all brought Draco back to the point that he had questioned Harry on earlier:
Okay, so if you don't follow me on tumblr, you didn't see the status update on this but I actually wrote this chapter and then didn't back it up before I fell asleep and LOST IT (hhhnnng it's fine i've only been backing up every single thing i've ever written for the last like ten years in like four places and the one fucking time i forget i lose everything i haven't been eye-twitching for days over this shit or anything)
“But—ah—You. I’m sorry, I don’t understand.”
“Hey, Ron. This must be distressing for him. Calm down, would you?"
“Let’s all calm down,” Remus said. “Everyone take a seat.”
To tell the truth, he had no fucking clue how it worked. But he did know one thing—Voldemort was currently in possession of the Elder wand.
Sitting up now, he folded his legs beneath him and ran his fingers through his hair.
It wasn’t his style at all, of course, and he could never pull off that causal sort of wear but they were just very different people, is all. And it just so happened to be that everything about Harry that Draco wasn’t, Draco was attracted to.
“Well, doesn’t that make me confident for my interview tomorrow?” He shifted, sitting up straighter now. Just like that, he looked so much more like he used to. “Honestly, it's been so long I’m not even sure I remember what Hogwarts looks like.”
With a final nod to Hermione and Ron, Harry left and apparated to Diagon, quickly making his way to the robes shop.
Harry let out a laugh at that. “I don’t think anyone’s reacted to me like that in a couple of years. It’s interesting, really. But, yes, I suppose. I am
He then heard quite clearly, “Oh, out of my way!”
“Okay,” Harry said, taking a deep breath. “Now that we’re all a bit more calmed down, can we return to Ron’s earlier sentiment: what the
No. This was exactly what he was trying to stop himself from doing. The war ended seven years ago. Why couldn't he convince himself to let it go? The rest of the world seemed to have moved on. Harry Potter walked around looking like he didn't have a care in the world. That was probably a result of knowing that there wasn't some batshit racist out to kill him. Why couldn't Draco jump on that train with everyone else? Why couldn't he seem to get the Dark Lord's face out of his head?
Just before they left his room, he stopped his mother, looking her in her frantic eyes.
Not meeting Harry’s eyes, Draco cut him off. “I remember. I remember him threatening my mother.” It was true. He didn’t know where the memory had come from, but it was playing out in front of him so clearly; he couldn’t deny it.
Of course, the blonde smirked and raised an eyebrow. “That sounds like an accusation, Mr. Auror.”
man. And, to that end,
And things got awkward. It was like all the air had been sucked from the room.
“Well, if you’re feeling better, we should probably get walking. At this point, we’re not getting back until well after curfew and I think it would be wise if we were found together so you don’t get into an unnecessary amount of trouble when this was my fault, really.”
Incredulous, Harry almost began yelling.
and there was a basilisk running around the school and all but that’s not the point. The point is that Hermione brewed a polyjuice in the toilets and Ron and I took it and transformed into two of your friends, Crabbe and Goyle, and snuck into the Slytherin common room for some sleuthing.”
For the last three days as Harry sat in a chair next to the bed, Narcissa sitting on the other side, Harry had to resist the urge to uncover Draco’s face from the invisibility cloak. He just wanted to see him. But he wasn’t going to take any chances that it wouldn’t work. And now it was the third day.
With a sharp shake of his head, Draco pulled the sleeve back down. He knew he shouldn't torture himself with starting at it, but he always fell into that whenever he was feeling guilty. He would stare at the Dark Mark, think about the pain it had caused him and the difficulty it still brought him socially, and lose himself in guilt, thinking that he deserved it. After all, it wasn't like a Death Eater earned their Dark Mark by just asking for it. You had to do something. And Draco....Draco let them all in. He caused the death of—
(See the end of the chapter for
i have no idea? when lucius like joined up w voldemort but whatever
It was the same room that Draco had hidden out in that night before his father had come to pick him up. Harry had sat on the wall just outside the entire time as Draco sat in the chair and forced himself to not move because he knew that if he did, he would run to Harry and beg him for help. Like a coward.
Stumped, Draco stopped where he stood. He didn’t know where the damn owlery was. Trudging back over to the bed, he was quickly reminded just how helpless he was in his current situation. Fuck, he wasn’t even allowed to have his wand.
They continued walking down the lane, neither paying attention to where they were headed, as the conversation continued. In the back of his mind, Harry marveled at how easy it was. Eventually, they had somehow circled back into town.
Ron nodded. “Which is why we asked you to come here. He put some sort of spell on Draco so that no one could end this early. But I don’t know if that will actually expire at the end of the three days—or if he’ll just recast it. So we might need you to break it in the morning so we can have the funeral and let Draco rest.”
“Hey.” Harry reached out and laid a hand across the back of Draco’s, which was resting on the table. “You don’t have to explain to me. It was war. You had Voldemort—“ Draco’s face gave a violent flinch at the name. If any had an excuse to still be afraid of the word itself, it was him. “You had him living in your house. I’d have done the same thing. You don’t have to explain to me.”
Actually, not only
He was the most beautiful man Draco had ever seen. His eyes were twisted shut in pain as he put his weight on his friends, clearly having broken an ankle or something of the sort. But when he opened them, Draco was confronted by a green more dazzling than he had ever seen.
“Okay. I’m going to have Remus come over here. He’ll keep an eye on things. Snape, McGonagall, and I will figure out what to do.”
he had to never go back there. It was so strange to have these feelings but never be knowing where they were coming from.
That was the plan.
,” he said through gritted teeth.
He had figured out what was strange about the letter: Draco had signed it Norbert. Norbert, a dragon—Draco means dragon. He had gotten it. But what he hadn’t gotten is that Draco saw Norbert in Hagrid’s shack first year. And Harry hadn’t told him about that. Which means he remembered. And he remembered where they had first met.
“Well, I do." Draco peeked out through his fingers at that. Harry was trying to stand, leaning up against the chair arm for support."And you don’t have to be here so you can leave.” And leave Ron did.

and I am a
Then, his attention turned to Draco and grimaced. “Sorry.”
Harry looked at her a moment. He tried not to get a little upset because he knew that she was just caring for him, but it was difficult. Firstly, he was going to be dead soon, anyway. He had already accepted that. Secondly, he had
No. The real answer was no. Draco was not alright. His mind was reeling. He didn't know what to make of all of this.
Narcissa’s eyes looked sad, likely remembering how recent it was that her son suffered from amnesia. “What do you remember, dear?”
__________
He blinked his eyes open, the harsh light making him wince. With more rapid blinking they adjusted and he found himself inside a hospital wing he had never seen before.
Clarity washed over his face. “He still has the stasis charm on,” he breathed.
Still unable to look down to see the Dark Mark marring his skin, he turned back to look at Harry who was sitting with his elbows on his knees, hunched over.
“See what I mean!” Ron started up from his seat a little. “That’s all you care about!”
Dumbledore opened his mouth, looking confused, and Harry continued on, not letting him speak yet. “You tried to sabotage the Deathly Hallows. For the sole reason that you didn’t want Voldemort to get his hands on the Elder Wand and guess what? It didn’t work, Dumbledore! Voldemort ended up with the Elder Wand anyway and I don’t have the Deathly Hallows and now I’m going to stay dead. And that’s fine, right? That’s what you were expecting all along, right? You knew that if you made the decision early on to put me into an abusive home and keep me there even when I came to you for help that I would idolize the magical world simply because it was an escape from the hell that you had put me in. You knew that that would make me die for it. The truth is that you can’t ask anyone to be a martyr. But you manipulate someone into turning themself into one. And that’s what you did to me, wasn’t it, Dumbledore?”
Harry looks up at Malfoy, grudgingly impressed with his resolve not to further hurt this woman who was hurt during the war. But he's starting to suspect Malfoy's turn-the-other-cheek behavior and verbal gymnastics aren't motivated by conviction as much as a heavy guilt he denies feeling. He's starting to suspect that Malfoy thinks he does deserve to suffer. And surprisingly, Harry doesn't agree. He may not forgive him but he doesn't need to see Malfoy suffer. Harry might just want him to be happy.
Draco snorts.
Trudging off the pitch, the thin March sunshine beginning to set, Draco hadn’t been surprised at the result. Had he been a gambling man, he might have placed a couple of Galleons against Puddlemere too.
Harry Potter – Puddlemere’s famed Under-21 Captain – was drunk, sat on his settee and sat on his lap.
"I used buckwheat flour."
"There's nothing wrong with having refined tastes. You are not morally superior because you buy the Tesco bread."
’ve ever been.”
What then, was the motivation for these letters? Draco rolled the phial between his finger and thumb. He ought to send it back; he didn’t want to send mixed messages.
Harry pushed his other arm between Draco’s neck and the mattress so that Draco had something to rest his head on. Draco reached back, and gripped Harry’s hip, pulling the other wizard closer. His chest was tight, his vision was blurry, and he turned his head, catching Harry’s lips with his own. Draco choked on his breath the first time that Harry got it right and his prick glided over Draco’s prostate. Maybe it was all the pregnancy hormones, but Draco couldn’t remember ever feeling this sensitive ever before. His whole body was an erogenous zone, and Draco fought hard not to go to pieces with every thrust.
"Go on, then," Harry says eventually, holding out his cup.
"Well, alright then," Hagrid says, wiping his hands self-consciously on his trousers.
Finally, after cartons were emptied, and Draco felt pleasantly full after eating seconds, it was time to break open the fortune cookies. The whole tradition was a bit silly – Draco and Greg rolled their eyes – but Millicent was a stickler for things she enjoyed.
"Are you expecting the Queen?"
In reality, Draco had missed Mother terribly and he’d known she felt the same. It might have been different if he’d had younger siblings, but even though his parents had tried – an heir and a spare was
"It means it's very drinkable."
Food poisoning wasn’t the cause, and if it were magic, then it didn’t feel like any spell that’d ever been cast upon him. Draco refused to countenance any other reason for his sickness. Spitting out the last remnants of the plain pasta that he’d had made for him specifically, Draco stood slowly. The room was spinning a little, and he thought he ought to sit down. An afternoon in the sky left him less dizzy than he currently felt.
Malfoy looks at Harry with wide eyes and Hagrid nods slowly.
Malfoy stirs slowly melting chocolate over simmering water, adding a small measure of olive oil and once it's smooth and shiny takes it off the hob. He gingerly presses his fingertips to the cake, testing for coolness and pours the melted chocolate over the top of the cake, letting it drip gracefully over the sides.
picture from the first St. Mungo’s appointment that Harry had attended. The second was of a couple, dancing in the late autumn sunshine. Leaves fell around them, and their love was palpable. Draco picked up it.
"That's Lord Yipslington to you," Malfoy says. "Come on, Yip," he calls, already striding away.
"Sure, he switched sides, I don't care. Don't you remember how awful he was to us? The constant teasing and bullying?"
The last time Harry felt this conflicted he had just found out Snape was the Half-Blood Prince. But Harry never drunkenly kissed Snape—thank god for that—and Harry has drunkenly kissed Malfoy.
Harry snorted at that and flipped over a pancake. “Why does that not surprise me in the slightest?” he replied, the smile evident in his voice. “Sorry if I woke you. I didn’t mean to. These were supposed to be our first-full-of-day-living-together surprise.”
"I don't like the feeling of things 'round my neck."
Malfoy is laying on his back looking extremely pale, even paler than usual, but his nose and fingertips are no longer blue. Harry pulls a chair over and looks his fill at Malfoy's blonde eyelashes and the wisps of baby hair around his forehead. Eventually he gets tired of looking and starts itching to touch, so he does. He brushes the hair back from his forehead and thumbs his pointy cheekbones and runs his finger tips down Malfoy's arm, to his bony hand. As he's slipping his fingers through Malfoy's and rubbing the back of his hand, Malfoy wakes up.
"What're you on about?"
The two of them chatted for a further hour or so, and Greg told Draco that the two witches had decided, conclusively, that Draco was having a daughter.
The next few days were equally full. Greg was busy with the rest of the Puddlemere players, getting prepped for their game against Appleby the following weekend, so Draco filled his time organising his flat. He read books that had sat on his shelves for an age and vegged out in front of the Muggle television that was suddenly, and surprisingly, addictive.
Harry doesn’t dare get closer from his corner, afraid he’ll be caught, so he can’t quite catch all the pages they stop at and the things they point at, but an unusual silver vase, an emerald green velvet chaise lounge, and a mid-century bed are definitely mentioned.
He wakes up early Monday morning with disgusting breath, a headache, and vague memories of someone rubbing his back while he vomited several cupcakes into the toilet and Ron's too-loud voice in his ear as he half carried Harry to his bedroom. Harry's never been that drunk before.
bag? You heathen. You absolute troll. You're suffocating this poor excuse for a loaf. Bread needs to
Harry reaches around Neville to grab another butterbeer. Dean and Seamus brought fire whiskey and Harry's feeling a little fuzzy around the edges. "Do you want a butterbeer?" Harry asks Neville.
Bill laughs. "Thanks for that. I've enough nappies to sort through at home."
"Really though, imagine your dad is sick enough to be Voldemort's lap dog."
Harry shrugs at Neville. "So what if I am? It's my business."
The first two facts weren’t any kind of surprise. Harry could always be relied upon for booze and laughter, and the dark-haired wizard stayed at Draco’s Half-Moon Place home on a regular basis. Whenever Draco needed cheering up, Harry was the first person that Draco Firecalled. The third fact was a good deal more surprising. Harry hadn’t ever made a pass at him, or even hinted that he’d like the two of them to be more than good friends before their lips had met only minutes before.
Harry waves his hand at the living room, where Hermione is punctuating her words with sharp taps of her quill on the coffee table.
Ron walks to the Floo, chuckling to himself and mercifully leaves.
"Well you wouldn't be so tired if I wasn't an idiot."
"Oh yes of course. I'll probably have to turn in my Anti-Pasty League pin."
"You're picking those up later."
Harry does shut up and does take a sip, but not because Malfoy told him to. Because Andrea recommended it and Andrea grows the best cabbages in the world. And Andrea is right, it's extremely drinkable, Harry thinks, taking several more sips. Harry also finds out he likes kale. It's like spinach but more. And it goes great with the wine, both of them sort of… minerally.
Draco simply couldn’t answer her. He didn’t have the words.
Harry doesn't have the energy to explain the body of Christ to Malfoy, especially while he's reading the menu.
"We will be having pan-seared red snapper with an orange, grapefruit, and olive relish, and a side of garlic salt and pepper potatoes."
Malfoy surprisingly doesn't end up buying any of the cookbooks, and they make their way to the Apothecary where Harry learns Malfoy brews his own anti-aging skin potion.
"I think I like polenta," Harry says.
Harry kissed him; his own face wet with tears. “A baby girl,” he whispered. Thank you, Draco. Thank you for my baby girl.”
"And they're self-washing. And look at these gorgeous lines Potter."
"Shite," Harry mutters.
It's a toss up who looks more shocked, Harry or Malfoy. Both of them stand gaping at Ron, who seems entirely unaffected. Malfoy seems to not know what to say and Harry panics and says, "We should leave," just as Malfoy says, "You're joking."
Harry lifts his head from Malfoy's shoulder trying not to look too put out and goes to sit at the table. Malfoy hums a little as he goes back and forth between the table and the pot on the stove, setting the table with all the usual pitchers and bowls and stirring the porridge. Malfoy stirs porridge for a ridiculously long time because he insists it makes it creamier so Harry's stomach is rumbling by the time Malfoy sets a bowl down in front of him. It's sweetened just how Harry likes. Harry will never tell Malfoy, in fact he'll take this to his grave because it would make Malfoy unbearable, but Harry tried to make himself porridge one Saturday and couldn't get it sweet just the way Malfoy does. He scrapes his bowl clean.
“Hello my dear,” she cooed, warm and grandmotherly in a way that neither of Draco’s grandmothers had managed. “Goodness, but it’s a stiflingly hot afternoon, isn’t it? Merlin, but Cooling Charms are a wonder.” She put her quill down and focused her attention onto him. “Now, what is it I can do for you today?”
Delectable tendrils of pleasure radiated out from his tight ring of muscle and the sensation was enchanting. Draco took himself in hand, wanking with only a loose fist. He was already very wound up, and he knew that it wouldn’t take much to tip himself over the edge. Fuck, but Harry looked sexy. His black hair was wild and his eyes had gone all hazy.
"You look like you have a fever."
"What's the difference anyway?"
Luna smiles serenely at him making eye contact for long enough that Harry starts to fidget.
Malfoy's happiness catches Harry, makes him hold his breath, leaves him with a jumbled knot of feelings to untangle.
"But why?"
Draco hadn’t actually thought about needing help while he was pregnant. All of his worries had been focused on after the baby was born. “I’ve got friends,” he answered, fiddling with a loose button on the cuff of his shirt. Pansy, Theo and Mils would help him. “And my mother. Though I haven’t told her yet,” he clarified.
Harry was going to be a father and he deserved to know.
"Remember what?" Harry asks.
Malfoy shifts away, putting on oven mitts to retrieve the cake from the oven.
Puddlemere won brilliantly, of course.
The last thing in the world that Draco wanted to discuss was being sick. “It wasn’t a Muggle virus,” Draco cut in, wanting nothing more than for Harry to stop talking. He looked at the tasteful watercolours decorating the walls and the tiered trays of sandwiches, praying for inspiration. “Braithwaite put that about. That wasn’t the real reason I missed those last couple of matches.”
"Not bad, not bad at all. Where'd you learn to cook?" Bill asks Malfoy.
"My point is, a lot of queer people feel like this. Like they're starting from scratch."
"Lemon curd is my favorite," he says, and Harry says, "I know."
"Oh thank god," Harry says.
There are a dozen baby artichokes, the leaves tinged a dark purple, tucked into every nook. Draco might steam them and stuff each leaf with buttery herbed breadcrumbs. There's a beautiful head of radicchio, leaves glossy and tight that might become a gently wilted salad with melted parmigiano. And the three pounds of fava beans Draco ordered, that he can't decide what to do with because he's too excited—maybe he'll eat them on toothpicks with pecorino like he's in Rome. There are bunches of fresh parsley, some storage onions and potatoes, and fresh strawberries. And hidden at the bottom of the basket there are some beautiful stalks of red and green rhubarb.
… All of it. Even collecting your blasted potion form Frobisher’s.” Harry picked up Draco’s bag from Wizkids’s, swung it over his shoulder, and offered Draco his hand. They said their goodbyes to the owner, and the two of them made their way to the door, stepping back out into the humid heat of wizarding London in the afternoon. “And Sunday will be fine, I promise. The Weasleys can be pretty full-on, but they’re good people.”
"Come in," he calls out.
"What's wrong with you? You look terrible."
Neither of them had known family the way Draco had seen it at the Weasleys, but now they had a chance to make a family of their own, all by themselves. It might be unconventional – co-parents, and not bonded husbands – but their family would be a precious, cherished thing for all that. Draco felt a small twist of sadness, and a lump in his throat as he felt the baby’s small movements deep inside of him. Perhaps it didn’t matter that Harry and he weren’t a couple.
"Are you going to my house after work today?"
The lace enhanced his curves and all at once Harry was desperate to feel it trapped between their skin. He felt so lustful, so turned on... Pulling the other man to him, Harry revelled in the softness of Draco’s breasts under the lace.
“If I let you go,” Harry said quietly, “will you promise to come back to me? It doesn’t matter to me. Whenever. Wherever. I’m falling in love with you Draco, and I can’t stand to see you hurt.”
Harry grinned, wrapping his arms around Draco and kissing her soundly.
Draco felt like crying. So, she wasn't beautiful anymore? Harry didn't want to shag her and was using an excuse. But she hold on. At least she could prove she could make him come. She didn't want him to be sad, so she nodded, grabbing his cock and starting to suck and lick even more, almost shoving it down her throat, closing her eyes and giving all she could to that.
Draco got closer to them and tried to hide her expressions of pain when she moved to sit on the hospital bed again. She didn't want to show Harry how sore she still was.
“I promise you, Draco, the only reason we won’t be together forever is because
"I just don't punch you in the face, Potter, because there are cameras around. I hope you remember that every now and then," Nott said at least, although he looked like he had been defeated, and turned around, going in the direction he had come from.
“I'll be even more perfect if you constantly break me in bed. I'll be even more poise and posh so when you rip my clothes off, it will be even better...”
Draco was a fabulous cocksucker, in a different league to anyone else he’d ever had, and he very nearly came under the hot, wet touch of his mouth.
As he arrived at the 7th floor, he walked until he saw a door with the name POTTER in it. He knocked, opening it anyways.
She knew she would need it when she gave birth, but now it was like she couldn't be seen without it. The strapped on the thing, not too tight because she was a healer and she knew her limits, but it was enough to hide all the loose skin. She then put on an easy to take off dress, all green with blue flowers on the hem, and combed her hair. She cleaned her face and pinched her cheeks to make them a little red. She didn't want to put on make up because of Jasmine, but she wanted to be at least beautiful to Harry.
Harry lay on his back, enjoying the view of Draco pulling his clothes back on. Folding his arms behind his head, he laughed at Draco’s comment.
She helped him with his trousers, trying to make the process faster for both of them. In the back of her mind, she still thought about the softness of her own body, of how she didn't like it, but it was a thought that would go away whenever she looked at Harry's bright eyes.
Draco listened, although every fibre of his being wanted to shout and scream at Harry. The Alpha would never understand why Draco acted the way he did. It wasn't because he didn't want or because he was confused. He just couldn't. It wasn't possible, and that's it.
. Draco, though lost in fear, anger and sadness, smiled between his tears. He believed her.
"Harry, you've no idea how wet you've made me with this," Draco sent, and thought a little. He didn't know what to send. His neck was a safe thing, but what else? What was Harry attracted to? Boobs? Draco didn't have much as a female omega, but he did have nice, small perky tits. Maybe his legs? Maybe his knickers? With an idea in mind, he sat a bit better, holding the hem of his tee and pulling it up all the way until it showed just the base of his breast, not enough to show the nipple. He took a picture, showing his white, lacy knickers, his flat stomach, small waist and the base of his breast. "What do you think? Do you like it? What would you like to do?"
Even though his husband was smiling, Harry wasn’t fooled. Draco was broken by this, and he didn’t know how they’d move on from this.
He waited for Harry to finish his cup of tea, thinking what clothes he should wear. He decided to leave Harry for a moment as he decided, trying to find something that fitted him. He decided on a baby green pregnancy tunic his mother had given him and he had never used before, and some black leggings, being the only type of trousers that fit him at the moment. He braided his hair because it was often windy outside at this time of the year, and searched for his gloves, coat and comfy boots. He really ought to buy more clothes, his option were becoming very limited lately, but he was constantly tired. Maybe he'd ask for Harry to buy it for him. Yes. He'd give Harry a paper with everything and ask him to give it to the seller, because as much as he loved his husband, his sense of fashion was dreadful.
Draco felt wanted, and cared for and embarrassed at the same time. He felt angry that Harry almost said 'alphas will be alphas', like his mother and father said to him all the time, as if that justified what obnoxious behaviour some alphas had. But he did like the way Harry stepped in as if he was going to fight Nott for the territory. Draco wanted to be like those people who saw alphas, betas and omegas as exactly equals, but the thrill he felt with the idea of being protected like that showed Draco that he
“Never... Never... Fuck, never emp--- Harry, I'm gonna come!”
Harry felt shocked, utterly shocked to his very core. He couldn’t quite get his head around Draco’s words. He frowned.
“Was it good? I guess so. You almost drowned me in come,” Draco teased, then grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him to their bed. It was huge, and comfortable, lined with red sheets - because, according to his mother, he was going to bleed when he lose his virginity. He just didn't believe it was going to be
“Well, you married a complicated person. You should know we would have this kind of fights because I'd feel scared that one day you'd see me as you saw me before... Before...”
“You've never had your own cock all the way up your arse, have you?  I assure you I feel many things, but disappointment is not one of them,” Draco laughed a little, sidestepping Harry and going up to the stairs and into their bedroom.
Harry felt his orgasm start to rip though him like a spear. It seemed to come from his cock, and spread out to the whole rest of his body. He couldn’t ever remember it feeling so powerful before.
Draco held his tears like a hero, but cried happy tears on Harry's shoulder as soon as they got home.
Draco was sure he could handle it. It was easy and delicious until now. A little weird in the beginning, but it didn't hurt at all so far.
It only took a few moments for his orgasm to start to build. His arms and legs felt tingly and his entire universe seemed to shrink down to the man in front of him. Harry lost all pretence of trying to keep their activities secret as he found himself growling loudly in pleasure and excess.
Draco was still in the car when he got Harry's text. It made his heart relax a little, but it didn't fix his problem.
“I’ve never really had much in the way of self-control, Draco”, Harry whispered. “And I’ve always thought that patience was overrated anyway...”
She sat a little closer to Harry, touching his hand and sighing.
Five years. I can’t believe that I’ve wasted so much time. I’ve been such a fool.
Draco could feel he was already completely wet, and Harry's finger was making him even more wetter. It was such a gentle touch, but at the same time, so much. Feeling a hand that was not his touching him in such place gave him the same sensation as if he'd never touched himself there in his entire life.
Draco was trembling. He was a powerful omega, this was never something he doubted, but having so much control over someone's body... Over an
It didn't take long. Soon, they were transferred to another room and Jasmine was put on her chest again, now cleaned and all wrapped in a green blanket, bought by Draco's mother and decorated by Molly.
He’d imagined (well, hoped) bringing himself off against her bare backside, shooting stripes of hot come all across her rounded arse, but this was a treat he’d never considered, and he was exceeding excited about the idea.
her... Anyway, burgers. Since you’re such a novice on the subject, I’ll order for you.”
He could just feel himself start to tip over the edge, start to feel the orgasm build in the pit of his stomach-
. He honestly felt like he was floating outside of his body, his skin prickling, hot and tight, and Draco’s magic knitting and tangling with his own.
This must be the
While Draco changed, Harry thought he’d better pull on some lighter clothes himself. Some shorts, shades and his favourite SPEW tee shirt completed his touristy look and he pulled out the guide book he’d brought  from Florish and Blotts before he left.  Feeling hot, he cast a quick cooling spell.
“Wood has absolutely lost his marbles! What was he thinking when he accepted that? You are absolutely not going alone to Brazil! You know we have to take shots and buy insect repellent and the place is bloody hot! Harry, I get all red if the place is hot! What would they think of us? A bunch of red brit morons!”
The bed was richly decorated in red silks, and was far fancier than anything Harry had laid in before. He bit back a laugh at the far more rich tastes of Draco, hoping his husband wouldn’t need to moan too loudly about his lack of refinement and class.
When Draco came back home that day, he had on his phone a picture of him, Harry and Lyra with their mouths dirty with ice-cream. He slept after long minutes looking at it, longing in his heart.
. He nearly came with Harry's mouth on him, his knickers absolutely wet.
“Good to see that you’re back mingling with us
Harry walked his fingertips over Draco’s body, his heart singing with joy. This was perfection, pure and simple.
Looking around, Draco saw an old picture of Harry, this Weasley and Hermione with their two kids, and a woman who apparently was Weasley's sister,
When Harry got apart from him, Draco looked at him with eyes fogged with desire.
"Harry...!" he moaned, loud, wanting to hold the alpha's hair, but with his hands restrained, he had no control over anything they were doing. It gave him so much more pleasure to know Harry could do anything to him...
Draco moaned with that touch, feeling his body get hot almost immediately. It seemed like his words have made his husband explode with want, and that turned Draco on... Knowing that he had this power over Harry.
He wanted to feel Harry in him so, so much...
Draco hold up his legs, embarrassed but needy. His cheeks were red, but his eyes were glowing. He wanted it so, so much it hurt.
“I'm excited to it. I keep imagining it all the time. I wake up hard and wet all the time. I'm wearing your jersey and some comfy pants. What about you?”
And Draco was
“Come to bed, love, just as you are.... I want to hold you all night... I won’t let you get cold, I promise.”
Harry was aware of the subtle sweet aroma of Draco’s slick, carefully concealed but still prominent to his lusty imaginings. He might have gotten closer, but they were disturbed by a delegation of other workers.
"Yes, more like you'd be sitting behind a computer all day analysing our numbers and telling us what should we do to make our profits hit higher marks, generally speaking."
Draco had taken another route, so he missed the altercation. He was still worried though, his heart pounding. He hoped no one had seen them together. How fucking reckless he was when he asked Harry to meet so soon. The fear of being discovered made him useless the whole day, and he couldn't forget about it, so he couldn't do his job properly.
Harry desperately wanted to call, and his finger nearly pressed the number to be put through, but he changed his mind at the last moment. What if Draco wasn’t in a safe situation? Harry’s eyes burned in worry as he stared at the phone, willing it to buzz one more time.
That was typical of Lyra, Harry thought. She was always thinking of someone else, be it Ginny, Draco or one of the two baby sisters she’d gained in a very short space of time. Harry had been worried how she’d cope, but Lyra has just laughed.
“Come on,” he urged, pulling Draco to his feet. “Times ticking on, lovely, and the day won’t wait. Shall I meet you in the shower, where I’m going to give you the most fantastic hand job you’ve ever had in your life?”
Harry kicked off his shoes, and contorted his body terribly to undo his trouser buttons. It didn’t take much though, and soon they were down, but wrapped around the bottom of his legs in an ungainly knot of material. He was terribly excited, and could feel the warm girth of his length snug within his underwear, already damp and ready for Draco’s extra attentions.
“Touching you sounds wonderful”, agreed Harry. Even if he didn’t share Draco’s feelings, he understood his perspective. “And I’d be very appreciative of your lingerie as well, enjoy you show off your tight little body...”
“She looks so much like you,” Draco whispered, touching Harry's shoulder. “I don't quite have the energy to keep up sometimes.”
“Draco”, Harry asked, “you’re turning me on so fucking much. Being here with you... being this close. It making me lose my control. I’m going to get my cock out, touch myself while I’m touching you. I’m going to pretend I’m fucking you.”
"You're so fucking hot I can barely think," Draco whispered, and straddled Harry's legs, his green, lacy knickers showing. He kissed the alpha's neck, licking and biting softly before going down to his chest.
Harry pulled off Draco’s top, and pulled her close, lavishing her front with little bites, licks and caresses. Harry couldn’t believe how incredibly sexy he found Draco’s curves, how warm and pliable her skin was under his mouth.
Lyra gave Draco a very knowing look, one that Harry knew was his absolute
But then, Harry had expectations that Draco wouldn't, and couldn't, fulfil. Firstly, although it was very kind of him, Harry acted like Draco wanted to be the boss of everything. He didn't. And he knew it was all in good intention, since Harry knew Draco had been controlled all of his life, and of course Draco would like to wear his fitted trousers whenever he wanted, but it didn't mean he wanted to be a 'modern omega'. Maybe in a few contexts, yes. He'd like to choose who to marry with, thank you very much, but he also enjoyed having his alpha order food for him and leave him be. Draco hated talking to people, and although he was really good with his words, it was something he got tired very fast.
He closed his eyes, letting his body cool and relax from the strenuous week. He was so bloody tired, he really needed something to make him relax. When he heard Harry's shout, he stood up, ready to grab a towel. But then, he felt bold. He lowered himself once more on the water, getting as wet as he could, and he walked up to his living room (yes, he was wetting his flooring, but fuck it. He felt sexy and he wanted Harry to see him just like this). He looked through the peephole to make sure no one was passing on the corridor, and smiled when he saw Harry on the other side.
The first thing he did on entering the shower was to switch on the head. The steams of water would wash away anything that might embarrass Draco, as well as let him lather them both up... He wanted their bodies slick, close and slippery.
Draco screamed, his eyes rolling to the back of his head. It was punishing, but it was good. Fuck, it was so good. The hard pounding made him burn from the inside, a little pain mixed with all the pleasure. He could feel his tiny breasts moving on his chest with how his body was being used. He could feel Harry's cock pressing his walls until they couldn't go in any further and it made him feel a sharp tinge of pain that made him even more wet.
"I love your home, Harry. I've never been somewhere I feel so immediately protected and safe. Except maybe at Pansy's," Draco reached and touched Harry's knee. He wasn't really hungry, but he bit a cookie just so he could do something with his mouth. "So... I went to my parent's old Manor. Nott was there. He took pictures of us in the company's kitchen and showed my parents. They... They knew every single thing about you, Lyra, Ginny... Your parents, too. They said I should forget this nonsense and marry Theo Nott of all people," Draco laughed, because the idea was laughable at the minimum. "I told them I couldn't marry him. Because Nott was weak and you've fucked me already, just not broke my hymen."
It was long after tea time when they'd finished. Draco had another shower - he hated the idea of being sweaty - and was dressed in leggings and one of Harry's shirts, one that he had forgotten in the old building where Draco lived and Draco had never given back.
Everything was great. It really was. After they came back, Draco was all over the moon. Sometimes he felt bad because he waited so long to have sex. It was so good, especially because Harry was the one doing it with him, and it always felt amazing. The way he touched him, the way he looked at him in the eye and gave it all, like the Gryffindor he was. Draco felt amazing.
Draco opened his eyes, looking at Harry.
Canting his wife’s bottom upwards, he finally stroked his rough fingers over her arsehole. He knew how much this would surprise her, but he was in the mood to tease, and hopefully get teased back. Harry only hoped Draco could stay as silent as she’d promised.
“You’re so good,” Harry murmured, entranced at the omega’s pleasure. He smiled a little at Draco’s innocence. Harry personally thought omegas must have some sort of latent magic powers because most alphas had cocks which were utterly
Draco rolled his eyes, trying to avoid smiling, but it was obvious he was holding it back. He sighed happily when Harry hugged him, feeling warm all over. Harry was so big compared to him, that Draco felt his legs shake a little. He also had to control his own urges. It's been a little more than a year that they were dating, and every passing day, Draco felt more and more attached to Harry. He was beautiful, and sexy, and Draco often had naughty dreams starring Harry, but he couldn't give in.
All Harry wanted was to protect him.
“This doesn’t seem like much at all, Draco,” said Harry evenly. “But if there’s anything you need then we’ll go and get it, whenever you’re ready. And of course, anything here is yours.
Draco had eaten very little muggle food before they’d got together. Everything she ate at home had been the creation of an army of elves, which amused Harry no end, as it meant Draco had no clue how to cook even an egg.
He was red from the root of his hair to the visible parts of his neck. He was so embarrassed he said such a thing to Harry! He knew his mother was way more subtle about it! There were months that his father wouldn't even notice the bleeding. But Draco wasn't as subtle as his mother, and now he ended up screwing up everything.
He was expecting the pain and pleasure of the bite... He wasn't expecting the sensations it left him in, though. He felt like he was in heat. Wet, hot all over, lust prickling over his skin. Maybe he was.
He pressed home, pushing his cock as deeply as he could without hurting his lover. Draco smelt wondrous, his musky, citrus smell intensified by his arousal, the sweet smell of his sweat making Harry impossibly hard. He was desperate to protect Draco, desperate to make this a good experience. Something he would remember for the rest of his life.
His cock was once again fully hard. Of course, it wasn't impressive as Harry's, but it was surprising that Draco was so excited with so little time after his first orgasm. But it was a surprise for only himself, because he actually had no idea what was happening, or how his body would react to the faintest touch.
Only when he worked in a third finger, scissoring his fingers so thoroughly, finding his husbands warm depths, did he encounter any resistance. Harry knew this was deeper than his beloved had been taken. He held his husband tightly, bracing him for the inevitable pain his broken hymen would bring.
“Bloody hell, Draco. You simply have no ruddy idea just how sexy you actually are, have you? Merlin, I was so hard listening to you, so full of thoughts about touching you... How good you’d taste, how hot and wet you’d be around my cock... You need to be a bit more patient, love.”
slow circle.
"Haaarry..." Draco was pleading, but he didn't know for what. For more? For less? He touched Harry's hair with one hand, biting his bottom lip so he'd remain on control of himself. "Harry... Let me touch you... "
Harry couldn’t sleep. He’d spent the whole day in a jangle of nerves, and despite consuming a good measure of fire whiskey, he still couldn’t sleep. It wasn’t that he was having second thoughts... it was more that he was past ready for the day to come, and he was ready for his new life to start. When Draco texted, he was quick to reply.
“I guess... I guess we should enjoy our party until the last guest is out. Afterall, we only marry once. We should enjoy it until the last minute,” Draco said, smiling to hide his nervousness.
Even so, the sight of Draco’s tightly muscled back, the globes of his perfect arse and the sight of his lovely red arse clasping his cock were beautiful to behold, and he found himself pushing forward, slowly so he didn’t cause his husband undue pain.
Better get on, he thought. The reports wouldn’t write themselves.
Harry worked just one finger into Draco’s tight, neat little arse. His husband was wet and ready, but the very last thing he wanted to do was hurt him. He worked slowly, savouring the searing heat and just how very erotic Draco looked, taking his finger so well.
He admired Draco’s sleeping form for just a moment, thinking how elegant and petit her figure was, even pregnant (and also how terribly greedy her blanket thievery was each and every night).
Draco was almost, almost there. The strength with which Harry was fucking him was making him see stars, his whole body insane with need. The sounds Harry was making made him shiver and moan together with his husband, and he had to touch himself.
"Leave. You're not worthy enough to be my son. I knew when we discovered you were a fucking omega we should've gone and adopted another. One that we knew was an alpha. But we thought... We could make it work. We could make a weak omega into someone respectable, that would find a good alpha to take care of him... But we were wrong." His father said, and Draco cleaned his face, anger overcoming fear and sadness at the moment.
“Draco,” he said, feeling inspired, “would you like to go for a walk. Nothing fancy, but it’s a gorgeous quiet evening. Let’s go out, buy a glass of wine. And you don’t need to go anywhere, don’t need to leave. You get to come home with me, and I get to hold you all night. I love you.”
“Of course I understand, love... This is my baby too, and you are doing such a wonderful job of looking after our little Jim. Keeping them all safe and warm and snuggled inside.”
He supposed that if Draco came to see themselves differently, perhaps he’d be surplus to requirements?... Perhaps if Draco decided they wanted to be female, even some of the time then perhaps he’d be relegated to the past... A mistake made before they knew their true selves. It was terrifying, really.
Draco looked at Harry and once again frowned. He didn't know what Harry wanted to say, what he was meaning.
“I’m actually thinking of making a move in a short while,” said Harry carefully. “It’s my daughter’s birthday this weekend. Got to collect her cake for the party tomorrow... Family commitments. You know how it is.”
“Potter, I need...
Staring out into the star stippled night, Harry speculated how Draco would be feeling as midnight approached. His husband had been full of trepidation when they'd last laid eyes on each other.
Wasting no more time, Harry gathered a large chunk of sticky chocolate, spreading it thickly around Draco’s slick hole. “Careful,” Harry smiled “it really is
Bloody hell, Draco informed him weeks in advance what he was getting for his birthday. There was no way on Merlin’s green earth he could keep this under wraps.
"Because he's actually had good ideas, and you're being annoying," Draco frowned, and turned so he could go on with what he was doing. "Also, don't call me Draco. I'm your superior, and you should be calling me Mr Malfoy."
"Harry..." Draco mumbled, smiling softly to him and smelling his alpha closer to his mark. "Good morning alpha..."
Harry was gratified by Draco’s response to the meal. He loved to see his wife enjoying herself, eating her fill and feeding their baby.
light. I just don’t want to be a regret.”
Switching on the water, Harry let the water run through his hair and down his back. He sighed, enjoying the heat sooth his aching muscles. He hadn’t wanted to say those words to Draco. He wanted a baby more than anything, but not at the expense of his husband’s health. It was going to be a difficult conversation.
Draco felt his body melting, like he was made of wax and Harry was fire. The feeling of touching Harry's body while completely naked was otherworldly. It was amazing, just the feeling of it. He touched Harry's chest, giving in, completely giving in.
Harry felt himself drift back into consciousness. Two thoughts occurred to him simultaneously: Draco wasn’t in the bed beside him, and something was
The feel of the baby blue silk next to his mouth felt good enough to make his leaking cock come there and then, and he focused on kissing and nuzzling Draco’s cock through the material, his entire body on fire with desire and want.
Draco closed his eyes, moaning out loud and showing off his arsehole and cunt. Harry was so good with his mouth that Draco couldn't even think about what he was doing.
"Would you... Really do it for me?  Harry, I don't think we have money for this right now," Draco was happy, but at the same time he was worried. He was really afraid of going poor and hungry, and even though Harry had assured him earlier, he couldn't not think about it. "I... I imagined I'd marry virgin and bonding in the night of our marriage... It didn't happen like that. I'm happy with what we have... But I think we should wait... Get stable before we do anything like that."
Harry knew that he would have to keep a close eye on Draco over the next few days and weeks. Now that she was no longer pregnant, he could only imagine the ridiculous standards she would put upon herself in order to be as thin or attractive as she decided she’d need to be. Harry dearly wished Draco could just relax and enjoy their beautiful baby for a short while.
Draco kept his eyes closed, trying to breathe properly once again. He let his legs fall down to the floor again, his chest going up and down. He was sticky, sweating and dirty. He was having mixed feelings, now that his mind was getting clearer. He wasn't supposed to do that... But at the same time, he wanted it
Harry’s intense thoughts were broken by a ping from his computer. It was Lyra. He opened it up, reading the message quickly.
"I'd lose everything. I want so-o much to-o be-e with yo-ou, Harry! B-but I'm scared! I'm so scared! I'd be the ha-happiest p-person with you, but then-then I'd lose my family, and my job, and the rest! I don't know what to do! I'm afraid of making a mistake... With them, with you... I don't want to lose you, Harry! I'd
Harry’s thoughts drifted away from the wedding, and strayed onwards to their honeymoon. Feeling cheeky, he let his fingers wander up his husband’s leg. It was the lightest of touches, but Draco’s leg felt beautifully taut under the expensive fabric of his trousers.
Draco had agreed with him, showing the whole of their office that he respected Harry’s ideas and business understanding. It made his alpha blood burn hot, and he could have taken Draco there and then, in front of their whole office...
, Harry thought, feeling a bit guilty about the videos he’d been watching. I was thinking we could maybe talk? What did Draco mean? Was he
“That cowgirl outfit was cute,” Harry laughed, tickling his baby and making her giggle. “It had a little hat and everything. You liked it, didn’t you Iris May?” Harry lent in and kissed his daughter’s chubby cheek, and took a breath of her wonderfully milky baby smell. He chose a sweet little teeshirt and leggings that Draco couldn’t complain about: he’d chosen the outfit himself. The clothes smelt of lavender and were sweet and practical, perfect for the swing and slides at the park.
Harry stroked a delicate finger down the pearly white side of Draco’s face. “I’m falling for you, omega. Falling fast and deep. I want to be with you, and it doesn’t matter if we ever have sex. I’ll just hold you forever if you let me.”
have too much to lose. You'd lose your job, for starters. And I'd..."
“I know you’ll do everything... You’ll are such a wonderful mummy. And I’ll do everything I can to support you later in the pregnancy.” Harry kissed Draco, and stroked her white blond hair. He really meant it when he say he wanted to make the remaining months of her pregnancy as easy as they could possibly be.
Draco hugged Harry's head, her own head falling back as waves of pure pleasure ran through her body.
Harry had to believe she was an expert in this as well. Even through the flames of their fire-call he could see how flat her hair looked and the dark rings under her eyes. Draco would be distinctly unthrilled about getting up multiple time every night.
; not because of some magical purity that really
Harry could only pray that they’d done enough.
“You're doing enough. I'm sorry, I'm... Harry, I'm sorry for being this insecure. I'm not sure I can fix it now. We've been dating for a while, and then now we are married, but sometimes I still feel I'm not enough for you... That I'll never be enough. You prove it to me all the time, you were marvellous when we waited for our wedding night, and then we waited more at Venice... And you're still careful around me because you know who you're dealing with,” at this point, Draco laughed a little, and raised his hand, touching Harry's hair and playing with the soft, curled strands. “I know you're doing the best you can to make me see it, but... It's hard. For me, personally. I've been healing, but... I feel like I'll never forget my past entirely.”
“Don’t worry about any of that Draco, we’re flooing straight into the maternity unit, and I promise it’s nothing that they’ve not seen before...”
When Draco received Harry's text, he was about to put his food on his plate so he could eat. His eyebrows shot up to his hairline as he completely forgot about Harry in his plan to keep some money safe. He needed to go and fix his stuff before having breakfast with Harry then.
“A little more than talking about work? What kind of conversation would you
“I’ll be here at nine in the dot, and I’ll bring you everything you packed and we’ve forgotten... Is there anything you’d like me to bring you to eat or drink? I love you so much, love. I’m so proud of you.”
"You're the only one worthy of me, Harry Potter. Because you're the only one I've ever wanted to risk all my power and tradition for. I'm on my twenties. I never had anyone. Most of my colleagues had children years ago. And I've never been touched before you, not even by myself. Do you really think I'd give myself to anyone who wasn't worthy of having me?"
Draco held on Harry's arms, a smile playing on his lips and reaching his eyes. He was wet, a little cold but satisfied. Everything was perfect, even though it was a little scary and it hurt a bit.
The worst part of bathing time was, once Draco was sitting, it was incredibly difficult to actually stand up again, especially with a toddler. Iris was babbling, her jet black hair wet and gluing to her forehead as Draco cleaned her out of shampoo.
Because Harry had thought of the perfect thing to help their family.
Draco felt like a cat being massaged, and his body reacted pretty much like one of a cat. Harry's hands on him were marvellous, and the scent of the oil would make him hard whenever he smelled it again. From time to time, he'd feel Harry's hardness against his bum, and Draco moaned every time it happened.
Harry struggled getting his trousers off; he wasn’t willing to take both his hands off Draco, didn’t want to break the connection he felt at that moment.
Draco was all cool with the playing and the touching, hot even, but when Harry started to take off his trousers, he panicked. He didn't mean to, he just lifted himself on his hand and moved around so Harry would get off him.
Harry ripped off his shirt, before the material choked him. His nipples felt as if they were burning and his heart was thumping in his chest. There was an animal, a beast roaring in his chest, raring to escape and to conquer Draco. He wasn’t an omega, but he couldn’t help but feel like he was slipping out of his very own mind.
Harry sighed with pleasure. Draco’s cum tasted like nectar and he swallowed it all down fully. Draco’s perfect slick was dripping now, running into Harry’s hair and all over his face, his omega scent burning through all of his senses.
Was this really a good idea? Harry considered himself a decent guy, but a million years of alpha biology couldn’t be undone easily, and he wasn’t sure how well he could control himself if Draco was genuinely going into heat...
This was sexy, and he could feel himself wanting more than he’d imagined he needed before. His fingertips was slick with the wetness leaving Draco and he was harder than he could remember.
Draco could do nothing more than trash his head on the bed sheets, his hand holding tight on Harry's hair. His chest was moving up and down with his hard breathing, his nipples glistening because of Harry, and also because they were leaking a little.
Harry was panting with want as he finished speaking. He’d been stroking Draco’s cock through his skimpy shorts all the time he was speaking, and felt incredibly aroused himself.
“I felt something,” Draco whispered sleepily in Harry’s ear, “it was as if a tide of your magic rolled through me. It was all tingly. Nice though... Like I was cosseted. I wonder if… I only hope we succeeded, love.”
have a choice."
She got out of the bathroom after throwing the hospital clothes aside for them to collect later. She stopped at the door, looking at her whole world in front of her. Harry was just so beautiful holding their small baby. He was so big all over holding that little bundle that it made Draco laugh a little.
Draco stood up, now walking from side to side in their room.
“Well, I could hardly be seen carting around a filthy bloody backpack like a certain
When they eventually pulled apart, Harry held onto Draco for several moments. He didn’t want to break this tender moment between them, didn’t want to go back to being boss and employee, but time couldn’t stop forever.
Harry pulled away, kissing Draco’s cheek.
Very bloody thick, it would seem.
alpha takes care of them. Yes, Father, my beautiful hymen is still here. But you know what? I've given myself to Harry. Over and over and over again. Just not in my cunt." He said. His mother hid her mouth with her hands, a shocked expression in her face. His father went pale, and Draco felt like it was a small victory for someone who's lost everything.
“Harry... Harry... I'm so wet for you... Fuck, your cock feels... Amazing... Dear Merlin, fuck... I'm... I'm so close to coming already... Suck me hard, make me come... “
Harry mused to himself that it had indeed been a marvellous wedding, but he secretly felt that the memories he’d most like view in his pensive were the ones from last night, and earlier that morning.
“Lay down on your front,” Harry told Draco. “I’m going to make you feel beautiful.”
The moment he had heard Draco’s voice start to rise in octaves, Elijah had taken his leave of the room, quickly disappearing into the nursery, which was the farthest part of the shop from Draco and yet he could still hear almost every word. Knowing that Mr. Malfoy would sort out the situation, Elijah tried to relax as he gathered supplies to tend to the plants in the nursery.
things together... But most of them are about Jasmine. I miss us being lovers and not only parents...”
“I haven’t called your mum yet, Draco. I thought you’d like to talk to her as well, now you’re feeling a bit more like yourself. You’re looking beautiful, you know that? Absolutely blooming. Motherhood is obviously really suiting you. I haven’t told anyone about Jasmine yet. We’ll have to share her with the whole rest of the world soon enough.”
Their first break came on a Friday night; damp and drizzling, Harry didn’t fancy going out. A quick takeaway sounded far more attractive, and Harry wondered idly whether Draco would acquiesce to serve himself up as dessert.
"I think he will if you keep looking at me like you've fucked me all night," Draco joked, a smile on his face. "Treat me like the high class omega I am, open doors, serve me things like I don't know how to use my hands, and never ever touch my skin, unless it is for shaking my hand. He'll never notice."
Jasmine touched the laptop, looking at the screen incredibly curious, then looking back at Harry.
“So you’re not adverse?” Harry felt quite enthusiastic about his dog idea.
“I would like to be thoroughly fucked by you the whole night and morning, but this little worm is too fragile to allow it. But it's entirely my fault so I can't hold it against Jim,” Draco took off her sandals and laid down between Harry's arms, feeling so, so tired.
“So good, Draco... You took all my cock so well... You looked magnificent stretched out round me, just perfect.”
“I know, baby,” said Harry, pulling her in close for a much needed cuddle. “I like him too.”
Harry looked at his loved one. This was more than Draco had ever said before. He was startled at the strength of his feelings at that moment.
As soon as Harry was out of the bathroom, Draco took his shower. He took care of his hair, and dried himself with the soft towels of the hotel. Going to the bedroom, he changed into muggle clothes, even though he felt uncomfortable in them. He wanted to match the Italians and he didn't want to show off, so he put on some black trousers and a light blue shirt. He braided his hair and put on some lip balm, because... Why not? He knew he didn't want to have dry lips as he went on with his day.
Draco felt hurt. And angry. Harry basically took Jasmine out of her arms and sent her upstairs without even a word. She went. And she took a shower, and changed to other clothes absolutely fuming. She needed Harry. She needed Harry and he just sent her away.
“You’re right”, Harry said, his voice hoarse. “It is only three months... And I do want you. Every time we’re close I’m hard for you. You’re playing on my desires like no man ever has before. If this is what you truly want, I suggest we move upstairs-”
His heart ached with a love that he couldn’t mention to any other person in the world. Especially not Draco.
Draco sighed, feeling ashamed all of a sudden.  She wanted to, felt hot all over, and it had been
was so much stronger after that. He let Harry touch him, and bared his neck like it was just nature. Like Harry was supposed to be there, just where he was. His hands were big and strong, and Draco moaned at the feeling of having an alpha so close.
Despite his tiredness, he felt his cock stir slightly against Draco’s fit little arse. He couldn’t wait to bury his cock balls deep into his husband, but he knew that could wait. Kissing the top of Draco’s satiny head, Harry smiled. Married now, they had no need to rush into anything.
my parents look at me as a baby machine. I
Harry felt overjoyed that Draco felt open enough with him to share that particular fantasy, and that he’d get to return the favour. He felt that with every passing day Draco became more open, and more empowered sexually. It felt wonderful.
“Looking beautiful there, Draco” Harry said as came to stand beside his husband.
"Come in my mouth... I've always wanted to taste an alpha's come... I'll drink it all and don't let a single drop out of it... Come for me,
As he got closer, Harry was aware of his heart drumming in his chest, the sheen of clean sweat coating his body. Any other alpha would be able to scent his attraction in a moment, but luckily the corridor was deserted. He rapped on the door, bypassing Draco’s secretary altogether.
“Mnnnnn.... So now it’s you that’s the tough one?” Harry laughed at Draco’s pouty lips, kissing him on them gently “So next Saturday we’ll swop and you can be the Quidditch star? Bet those healing spells aren’t too hard either? I’m sure I’d manage...”
“Look at you, Draco...” Harry whispered, into his ear. “So sexy and ready... By the end of the night I want your cunt as red as your lips...”
“You’d love it Draco, you’re just too fancy to admit it,” laughed Harry, admiring the quiver in his husbands slim legs as he got up, and thinking for the thousandth time what a entrancing man he had married.
Draco smiled, getting out of the bed and heading to the bathroom.
And really, this was far too submissive for any alpha, and by rights, Harry should be moving in to dominate... But this was wonderful, like a dream made real.
He snuggled closer to Draco in their booth, and wrapped his arms around her middle (making sure to wipe his fingers first- he didn’t want to upset her when she was so relaxed) and gave the bump a little rub with the end of his fingers.
Draco was so sleepy and tired from their previous activities, so incredibly sated, that he just held on Harry and let him carry him to the bathtub. He sighed as he felt his overused body hit the warm water, and he refused to let go of Harry.
Harry didn’t understand what the situation was, but he knew one thing. He wanted Draco to embrace his body and not be ashamed anymore; after all, he had Harry now, and he wasn’t ashamed of any part of him. He certainly knew there was nothing he was going to be disgusted by. He took a deep breath, wanting to express himself in a way Draco couldn’t misunderstand.
“Harry... I know it's been... more than a year... Almost two years, but... Can you... Can you call me a boy? For today?” Draco asked, feeling vulnerable. Speaking those words out loud made the feeling stronger.
This CEO smelt fantastic, Harry thought as the omega moved closer to his desk. Warm, and sweet and so delicious, like a mixture of treacle and syrup... Christ! Harry needed to nip this one in the bud
“Now, I want you to ride me, Draco, fill your cunt full of my fat cock... I’m going to work on your chest.”
“You’re majestic,” Harry murmured. "I can’t wait for our evening to begin."
He moved slowly, letting his husband get used to the feeling, enjoying the moment. His huge cock felt completely clasped, smothered in heat and slick, and he was so, so excited.
Harry moved closer and found Draco’s lips, biting them slightly and pushing his tongue against the soft mouth of his husband. If Draco wanted to be his boy, then Harry could certainly oblige.
Harry gasped the words. Every word was true, every moment between them was agonisingly exquisite. Harry had never waited, never denied himself and certainly never fallen in love before. This was new, his brain racing to catch up with the erotic frisson felt by his body.
As they entered their bedroom, Harry was hyperaware of how meaningful this was for Draco. He wanted it to be special. Stripping off his top, and sitting down on the bed, he beckoned Draco over to him.
, sucking so desperately, her small, slightly skinny cheeks filling with the first milk ever out of Draco's breasts.
Draco was so petite and beautiful, and Harry wanted to look after him forever. “I stick around because of
"Mr. Ollivander, is so good to see you again. My father is well, as well as a multi-billionaire can be," Draco joked, laughing a little, like he practiced over and over and over again. Jokes about money and all were always welcomed. "I am always happy to carry my family's name as proud as we all are. I'm not betrothed... Not yet, no. My business is too important. Can you imagine?  Our company in non-Malfoy hands?" He laughed again, even though his heart clenched at the thought of not marrying.
He pulled away and slicked up one finger with the Vaseline. He picked up a glob of the slippery stuff, and spread it thickly in, and around Draco. He entered him, sliding up to the knuckle with no trouble at all.
“I want you to go on a date with me. And please call me Harry, you never had a problem with it before.”
"Are you happy, my baby? Is this what you wanted? Did the bond felt good?"
With Draco’s stiff little cock never once leaving his mouth, Harry did his husbands bidding and started to finger his sweet cunt. The water pouring in his eyes and the angle of head meant he couldn’t gage Draco’s reaction, but it was certainly arousing his own body. He found his body reacting to the heat, wet and rhythm, quite out of his control.
‘Dad! How is everything with my beautiful baby sister? Baby Chloe is being typically cute and cuddly over here and basically driving mum bananas, so I was wondering if we could all meet later for a play date at the park? That’s if Draco still feels up to the walk? He looked very pregnant last time we met, and that was nearly a week ago. Anyway, daddy, love you. Xxxx Text me!’
Draco was funny, sexy as hell and he’d made Harry’s life wonderful. He couldn’t believe Draco thought of their lives in that way.
He smiled, collecting his clothes and cleaning himself with them.
omega, even if it wasn’t the title that Harry truly wanted to give to Draco. But he couldn’t let his thoughts go there...
, oh fuck! It's... It's so good... So good... your... your fucking mouth on me, eating me..." Draco started talking, his brain focusing entirely on the pleasure he was feeling. His cunt was gushing out slick, his smell strong and inviting. His body was desperate to be taken, to be knotted. "Harry, I'm coming... Fuck, I'm coming on your mouth...!"
"Soon it will be Chloe's birthday. Are you guys planning on anything?" Draco asked. She was going to be two in a month, just about three months older than Iris.
Perhaps, Harry realised, Draco would realise this week that he was in earnest, and that everything he’d said was true.
so there wasn’t even any point in his thoughts moving in that direction.
Unused to the feeling, Draco came so fast he screamed, hands grabbing Harry's hair and pressing him against his cunt. It ran through all his body, exploding, lightning and thunder crossing his body.
He lifted Draco’s fingers from his husband cock, replacing them with his wet, lubed ones. Rolling Draco’s slicked cock between his finger and thumb, Harry wanted to follow his lover’s words, and make him come.
Harry wrapped his hands carefully around Draco’s body, nosing the soft skin of his mate’s neck and running his tongue over the bite mark.
with the omega’s words. Draco had presented his body for the taking, and Harry fully intended to make Draco writhe in pleasure. He’d respect Draco’s boundaries, of course he would, but right at this moment Harry couldn’t think that he’d ever been more erotically driven by an omega.
And those knickers. God’s, it felt like Draco had reached into his brain and found his most secret fantasy.
"Fuck, alpha... You're going to knot me, aren't you?  Tell me you are... I need your knot so fucking deep inside of me, like you have no idea... "
CEO. Harry felt the annoyance rise up his spine. Come to check up on me, Harry decided. Showing off with his expensive clothes, and glossy hair... Harry shook his head. His life wasn’t like that, and it never could be.
At each passing day, he was becoming super aware of his new reality. Soon, they were to be married and they would be each other's, completely. Draco couldn't stop thinking about it at all. He even started, slowly, to finger himself whenever he was slick enough, one finger only, and it was amazing. Of course, it wasn't even close to what he would feel when Harry did it, but he wanted it so much that he couldn't stop imagining...
Draco, however, wouldn’t adore him wasting anymore of their precious day off. Not to mention, the longer jasmine stayed at home, the more likely she was to mess up her beautiful and very ladylike dress. After all, she had 50% of his DNA and he wasn’t well known for his tidiness or his finesse.
Instead, he arranged his face so it was neutral; so Draco wouldn’t see his grief and break into a million pieces. His voice was flat, but it was the best he could do.
She walked into the shower, the water wetting her hair as she kneeled in front of Harry.  Mutely, she just opened her mouth and showed her throat, silently begging for Harry to stick his cock on her mouth.
Harry pushed Draco always off gently, and hurriedly opened the buttons on his shirt, and throwing that and the tie onto the floor. He wanted all the sensations, and pulled Draco’s hand up toward his nipples. “Be rough with them,” he asked, “I really want to feel it.”
“Here it is, miss. Oh, you're expecting. How far long are you?”
“Merlin’s beard.” Elijah muttered in disbelief.
Harry couldn’t resist the sight of Draco, and he let his hands fall casually against the other man’s arm. Even though the touch was light, and terribly casual, it made Harry shiver. There was so much they needed to say to each other, and this wasn’t the time or the place.
"We can't be seen leaving from here tomorrow. My parents will know. Only if you come now, then come back home and come back here tomorrow morning... "
Harry made short work of pulling off both Draco’s jeans and his own. He was already so hard that his cock was struggling to stay in the confines of his boxer shorts, his pre-come staining them dark with his excitement.
we ever start a family."
“No one else can see that, omega. It’s just for you. A little mark just to remind you of our time together.”
He couldn't help himself. Even though he knew he'd be wet with the water, he crawled inside the shower with Harry and kneeled in front of him. Feeling bold, he touched Harry's cock, opening his mouth and taking the tip in. He moaned with it, and got it in even deeper. The water was now running over his body, and he put even more of Harry's cock in his mouth.
Harry couldn’t remember an orgasm so satisfying. The aftershocks ran through his body, making every nerve tingle and filling him with a sense of bliss. It had felt so incredibly right; natural and sensual, their bodies ripe and ready for each other.
“Out you go,” said one, a matronly looking lady with a broad smile that obviously wasn’t taking
Draco purred, flexing his legs and showing off his arse. He was positively drunk with desire. He hid his face in the mattress, opening his legs a bit to show his arse and cunt.
He imagined Potter would be smart and responsible, since he was now in a leadership position. He would have to impose himself. Yes, he was probably smaller than this alpha, but he was his superior. He waited for the lift, breathing in and out evenly not to show how nervous he was. He hated the first informal meeting.
“Fuck, Draco... Are you alive there or what?... Bloody amazing, fucking hell...” Harry shook his head, trying to get his brain to work. The reality of the Malfoy crest painted on the wall and the green drapes on the bed pierced his consciousness. He laughed.
Harry loved the vision in front of his eyes; loved how undone Draco had become in so short a time. He’d known that Draco would beg but it was more than gratifying to see the omega undone and begging for his cock.
-x-x-
"I've heard it since I was a very small kid,” Draco’s voice was small when he replied. “'Keep your legs shut and your mouth even more. A true omega knows their place and their value'. I told you before, Harry. I'm owned, I'm not really a person. I'm sure if I ever had an alpha brother or sister, they'd be ruling the company, not me. But my parents can't have other kids and they're stuck with me. So here I am, trying to be an omega in an alpha’s world, so I won't get eaten by the wolves. And... I've told you before, I don't even want it."
“Fuck, Harry, you make me hot just by teasing me,” Draco mumbled, lowering his hands and touching Harry's chest, knowing well that he was the only one to do it. One of his preferred hobbies was to touch him while healing him on the field and smiling smugly as his fans looked at him with envy in their eyes. “Tell me you're mine, Harry... Tell me you're only mine... “
Draco grabbed on Harry as if he was the only thing that would prevent him from drowning. He was sobbing on Harry's shirt, trying to focus on his husband's touch and forget the sadness. Forget all the hopes and dreams he had and now they were broken.
Harry was incredibly aware of how little barrier there was between him and Draco; just a tiny piece of lace. He could feel his husband’s hard little cock through the material. Harry could feel the shape rubbing against his thigh.
“I love you so much”, he began, smiling. “But did you mean that about having another baby? Jasmine is still so small... And you’re still breastfeeding? Was it just the sex talking?”
Draco didn’t move from where Harry had put him, but he was so out of himself that the feeling of Harry's tongue on him surprised him completely. He moaned even louder than before, his tiny cock slowly coming back to life.
Harry knew he was clutching Draco hard enough to leave bruises but he didn’t care. He lined up his thick, heavy cock ready to push inside, his slit leaking pre-come as he did so, slick all around with Draco’s juices.
His windows were, most of the time, covered with blinds. Draco wore so many clothes every day, that when he arrived home, he wanted them all off.
Perhaps it was simply that time had passed since he’d touched her, but she felt ready like he’d never experienced before. Her cock was hard under his touch, tiny but most definitely swollen and desperately hot and he rolled it around his palm.
Harry pulled Draco to him, dragging his hands roughly all over her body. She felt amazing, soft, searing hot and very, very sexy. He felt agitated, provoked and like he could lose his control incredibly easily....
everything about Draco truly was.
He got out of the app and saw Harry's message saying he had arrived. He went down and got into the car, his face trained not to show the sadness on his eyes.
Slipping his arms around Draco’s shoulders, Harry kissed him chastely, warmly on the cheek.
“One more finger, Harry...I can take it... I know I can... please... One more...” Draco was pinching his own left nipple, which was red and hard. The other one was just as hard, but pale pink. Every pinch made his body jolt with pleasure together with Harry's fingers in him. “And then I want your fat cock splitting me open like a slut... I want... fuck, I want to see your cock pressing inside me and touch me so deep I'll feel it for ages...”
in the Slytherin dungeon.
"Harry, I'm sorry that I'm sending this message to you. I've just heard what people have been gossiping about, regarding us. I can not let my position in the company be corrupted by gossips, so it's better if we leave our... fumbling to our beds. It was everything delicious, but we just need to stop doing this at work. Also, prepare your reports. I'm collecting all of them
Nott looked angry now, but decided to go. He turned, but then stopped and looked back at Draco.
He leaned in, pressing chaste kisses onto Draco’s forehead, stroking his fingers through the soft hair that framed his face. Rubbing his thumb along his lips, he asked if he could kiss him. Every boundary was precious, and he wanted Draco to feel as comfortable as he could be.
The Deathly Hallows would bring Draco back to life and he would get over what happened eventually and live a fulfilling life full of joy. Hermione and Ron would grow up and eventually get old, Hermione likely changing the magical world somehow, Harry just knew. And everyone else he loved…they would live a life without being concerned about Voldemort. Just like Harry was now. It was all over.
Draco gave him a curious look. “Oh? Why is that?”
“What’s up with that?” Harry asked before he thought about the words coming out of his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was fine, Harry figured. He would come around eventually. No matter how much he didn’t like Draco, Ron was still Harry’s best mate. He would acknowledge it at some point. It would be fine.
Ron and Hermione just nodded, knowing that there wasn’t really anything else that could be done. Bill got up and left silently and not too long later, they explained the situation to Remus. But for now, all they could do was wait. They would see what the morning would bring.
“You do.”
“Oh, now are you going to tell me that faulty brooms must be why your precious Gryffindors lose?”
“Well,” Draco said. “I should probably be on my way. I’ll leave you to it, then, Potter.”
He was going to die and there was nothing that he could do about it. The existence of the Deathly Hallows was only even believed by some, but whether or not they would actually allow Harry to conquer death was another thing. And they seemed to be having some trouble figuring out how to make Harry the master of them instead of just…getting them.
Harry shrugged. “If that’s what you want. Seeker’s game would be nice. But we could just fly around. I don’t think either of us every really got to have fun and show off while we were busy trying to find the snitch.”
With a deep breath, Draco looked up from the bathroom counter.
::::::CURRENTLY ON SEMI HIATUS--all my works are on semi hiatus while I am working on writing a long multichap so stay tuned and I will be back to this!!!
“That’s bad,” Pansy said. She crossed her arms, looking at all the faces in front of her. “Well, do we at least know where Potter is or where he’s been for the last week? I don’t even really care about the git and I’m starting to get worried.”
Draco looked at Harry from the side. “Why would you want to talk?”
is the post i was referencing on the end notes last chapter and it has ONLY gotten more relevant to this fic. i personally feel that uh minerva saw what dumbledore was doing and went uhh not on my watch?? so here we are
!!! we will be back w draco next chapter yaaay!!
“Draco....” Harry began, slowly. “That’s...well, it’s impossible. You don’t get memories back from an obliviate.”
Ron squared his shoulders. “No one will tell us,” he said and it was clear by the way that he said it that he was going to continue and he was only going to get more angry as he went.
But the more Harry watched Ron stare off into the distance, the more he wasn’t quite sure.
Their eyes met. “Really? What position?”
Their conversation continued on like this for hours, going back and forth and asking each other questions about life. Getting to know each other like they were just meeting yet laughing like they were old friends.
(See the end of the chapter for
It wasn’t until Draco pulled them around a deserted corner that they began to talk.
Oh, and he had been asked to lure Harry Potter to his death.
“Hey, Tom Riddle!”
Harry had to laugh a little bit. Of course he remembered where he first met Draco Malfoy but he was a little offended that Draco had to leave him a hint with that “Hogwarts, too,” repeating in the letter Draco’s first words to him. It was cute though, Harry liked it. Now he just had to wait for the next morning.
Ron and Hermione nodded, sitting across from him. “The only person he’ll let in is Narcissa,” Hermione said. “She went in shortly after I explained the situation to her and she also hasn’t left since. I don’t know if she believes in this whole thing or not or what it’s doing to her emotionally to have to deal with this and not have buried her dead son already, but the two of them are just holed up in there. The only thing I’m worried about is whether or not Harry is actually going to let this madness stop tomorrow like he promised originally.”
Once again, Ron took a small step towards him and worked the two wands out of his hand. “Okay, Harry,” he shushed. “It’s okay. Let’s give this back to Hermione and she’ll put the stasis charm on him.”
harry's feeling a big case of imposter syndrome about being a professor
idk bout y’all but as someone who dreams a lot i have random dreams like this all the time lol
And that was what he was realizing: it had to be Potter, didn't it?
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy actually laughed a bit. “What, think I wouldn’t be good at it?”
“Okay.” Draco took a deep breath. “The Death Eaters are at their endgame. They’re going to invade Hogwarts. I need the Order to act like they are entirely unprepared. My cover as a spy has been blown. Snape’s hasn’t, but it’s close. You—”
“I think that’s a good plan,” Blaise said.
Nodding, Draco recalled the memory again. “The circumstances aren’t clear right now. It’s like something just—“ He snapped. “—brought that up but I can’t get what immediately surrounded it. He was telling me to do something and was pointing his wand at my mother and threatening to kill her if I didn’t. I don’t know what it was, though. And I think that’s the scariest part of this all. He could have made me do anything and I would have done it.”
He met Draco’s eyes, fully recovered now. “Sorry. I was just a little...confused. I could have sworn you were dating Parkinson.”
This is it!!!! This is THE chapter, folks, the whole reason I started writing this fic. The speech in this chapter is what inspired me to write the entire fic and I am so glad that we are finally here and I hope you all love it!
also i guess harry just "scrunches" his face a lot lmao @ me where did that come from??
“As I was saying,” he began, fully aware that Ron and Pansy would only hear half of it if they were going to keep glaring at each other like they were.
Something in Draco had tightened at the word ligilimens. A cold fear began to grip his heart, making it’s way up his throat to freeze anything he could possibly say. No. No, he would not have anyone in his mind. That was—
Naturally, he chose the least frequented wizarding pub he knew of: the Hog’s Head.
(See the end of the chapter for
He was commanded by the Dark Lord to look into Bellatrix’s eyes and to not resist with occlumency. He tried to be sneaky about it, tried to block out the memories of what had happened between him and Harry, of their friendship, of the mirror, of him deciding that he was going to be a spy—and the knowledge that Snape was also a spy and that his mother might be affiliated with them as well.
we'll see draco talking to his students in the next chapter dont worry
Harry Potter.”
His mind was his, dammit. And apparently he knew what it felt like to let that get away from him.
“Can’t see it, no.” Harry was shocked to find that he was smiling back.
i assumed y’all would know Uhaul but i didn’t feel like explaining it in comments lol. also like Uhaul doesn’t seem like a big deal or whatever until you have experience w Uhaul lesbians lmao my friend got in a relationship and the girl said that they were soulmates after like 3 (?) days. Headcanon Pansy much? yes. headcanon Harry more? yes. (am i a Uhaul gay??) (maybe lol yes I want a hubby so bad)
And didn’t that come with a whole other realization? One that made nearly everything in his love life just make sense (except Cho. Nothing explained that disaster).
Since this is fanfiction, I can fuck with canon however I want. But, I don’t want to give away what I do in this chapter so if you’re having timeline questions, I’ll answer them next chapter when all is revealed.
Eighth year hadn't been much different, either. But they were all like that, somewhat, eighth year. Recovering from a war affects children. The press always seemed to forget that, whether they were praising Potter or dragging Draco through the mud.
“This is hardly fair, Potter. This thing is barely fit to fly and you and your firebolt—”
“That’s okay, we can just pretend I didn’t say that.” Harry began walking faster.
“Okay, so, firstly I’m bisexual—“
Sighing, Draco placed his head in his hands. He was so fucking lost. He didn’t know anything. And it wasn’t like he even knew who to ask to get answers.
“ I should...” Harry’s voice began from somewhere to the side of Draco’s bed. “I should go. I’ll come visit you later,” he promised.
Pulling him close, Draco whispered hurriedly into his ear, “They made me. They made me lure you here. I’m so sorry, Harry, I love you so much, please tell me you didn’t come alone?”
“If at all possible, take him by surprise. Get his wand to me. If you get his wand to me, I can do it. I can win.”
But the pity and sadness in Harry’s eyes told him already what he needed to know.
Draco shook his head. He wished he would have known about that earlier. When McGonagall first offered him the job, he had been hesitant because he was uncertain what kind of memories being at Hogwarts would bring up. Especially because he knew that Longbottom was the professor of herbology there and all that shit. But now that Harry was going to be there? Fuck, it would almost be like he was back in the war.
draco, blushing while alone lmao for having feelings for harry because he is just like so repressed when it comes to having those kinds of emotions lmaooo
“Alright then,” Ron nodded. “How are you planning on asking him out? Did you make plans to see each other again?”
Maybe if Draco just had a little longer for the Deathly Hallows to work…
He stood, picking up the last of things and starting to walk away when Potter swooped in directly over the stand and then came to circle before stopping to hover. Just behind Draco’s back.
Draco was opening his mouth to ask who exactly “he” was, not wanting the cold fear spreading through his body to be confirmed when the door opened and there was his aunt Bellatrix.
In the darkness of the thick depths of the forest, Harry stood. He still held no wand. As much as he wanted nothing more than to take revenge for Draco and kill Voldemort, he knew that he could not be the one to do that. He had to face this. There was no other way.
“It’s gone. Please let this poor owl out of the house.”
ALSO!! im so proud of marius for being the first one to sign the parchment and then!! make little Slytherin Pride pins!!!!??? im cryyyyingggg
Malfoy’s face went flat. “No, Potter, I’d floo in from France every morning.”
“I understand,” Draco said, his voice quiet. “I want…” He took a few breaths. “To see him, but I also want…to sleep.”
The man was crying out in pain as his friends tugged him in. The boy on his left—a redhead with sloppy freckles—looked to the meditwitch. "Pomfrey, he fell off his broom. Again. Trying to pull off some fancy trick, no doubt."
Hermione resized the body bag and was about to lift the invisibility cloak off of Draco’s body when she was silently disarmed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry waited, hearing the mangled sound of anger that told him Voldemort was somewhere to his right.
He was looking down at an ancient runes textbook, studying, when movement caught his eye and made him look up from the stands.
Alone in his flat, Draco slid up his sleeve in the safe space and took a long, hard look at the mark on his arm. He was at Hogwarts when he took that and, over the last seven years, whenever he thought about the school, the Dark Mark and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower were generally the first things that would come to mind.
“How are you feeling?" She asked him.
“Um…sure?”
Which was a good thing, too, because when Harry opened the door, many Order members were waiting.
“I know, Harry, I know. We tried to get you the Deathly Hallows in time, Harry, I’m so sorry that we—”
also after writing To The Memory Of Love, i have just felt so exhausted to like "write through the war" like its just so much work all the horcrux hunting and the deathly hallows like its exhauuuuusting and i didn't want to do it again sooo.... hence where this fic is headed lmfao
His mother had come into his room, not long after Pansy and Blaise had left. She had gotten him out of bed, made him wash up and put on dress robes. Every time he asked her what was going on, she kept reminding him of the “meeting” she had told him he was supposed to attend.
Everyone in the room looked at each other, confusion clear on their faces. Because if the Deathly Hallows had worked, wouldn’t Draco have woken up already?
shitshow hmm??
” Ron said, pointing at Pansy and Blaise. “I can’t believe you would even
literally harry and draco are both so livid it’s gonna be an interesting chapter 13 lmaooo
Then, Harry saw Dumbledore and things began to make sense. He was dead.
It was that room that he had Harry had been in that day. With the chairs and the mirror and the books. It was where Draco had sat as he had closed his eyes tight and pulled up his sleeve and found out that he was a Death Eater.
Now Draco looked like he didn’t quite want to say. “For the most part, I wanted to come back. France was getting stifling. I also realized that I only left to run away from my problems. That and I wanted to come back because the French Ministry is just...chaotic and I couldn’t stand it anymore.”
But again, it went directly past him.
******PLEASE READ******
Oh, and how he had wanted to kiss Harry. He had looked so good tonight in that casual muggle attire that Draco admired so damn much—robes were nice, yes, and say what you want but could anyone deny a man in a simple, white tee like the one Harry was wearing? No. Not when a man like Harry—with all his muscles good
Into the waiting hand of Draco Malfoy.
Hermione worked quietly, applying the stasis charm and then levitating Draco into the body bag. She didn’t remove any of the three Deathly Hallows so she quickly put an invisibility charm on the bag.
Turning to his right, a mirror had already appeared on the wall. Crossing behind his chair, he walked up to it, staring himself in the face.
“Nope. Never happened.”
“You’ve no idea.”
It took a long second for Harry to process that information. No, that was wrong. They dated. They definitely dated. Harry clearly remembered...on the train sixth year. Weren’t there other things? They dated. They definitely dated. “What do you mean you didn’t date Parkinson?”
He blinked his eyes open, wincing in the harsh light. His head hurt like hell and he reached a hand up, covering his eyes while they adjusted. Once he lowered it again, he realized he was in the hospital wing.
There was silence between them for a moment as Harry remained confused, attempting to understand what Dumbledore was saying to him.
And just like that, Harry began sobbing even harder.
Fucking hell.
That was the moment the room began to spin. Just a tad. Just enough that he definitely had to sit down for a moment. He pulled a chair out from the table and flopped down in it. This was really happening.
The man's eyes went wide, but his friends were watching Draco with guarded expressions, Ron’s hand still outstretched seemingly to protect the girl. Why?
Harry had just sat down in a secluded corner with his first drink when the door chimed open. If he was being honest, he was glad he hadn’t started drinking because he likely would have done a spit take.
Harry, Hermione, and Ron came to the Manor together, Draco with them. As they brought Draco inside, Harry seemed to have shut down. He wouldn’t look at anyone or talk to anyone. He just kept his eyes on the invisible spot that he knew to be Draco. Hermione had to quickly explain in hushed tones to Narcissa what Harry had done. But Harry didn’t note her reaction. He just pulled out his wand and levitated Draco all the way to his bedroom.
“What was it?” Ms. Topfeld asked, again looking him directly in the eyes. Draco jerked, avoiding her gaze. Something told him to do so.
And his head hurt like...well like someone had thrown him against a wall. He reached a hand up, groaning. That sound alerted what he assumed to be a meditwitch to come bustling in.
“Harry,” Ron started and the pity was clear in his voice. “It’s been over twelve hours and they haven’t worked yet. You can’t wait forever.” He didn’t want to start in on how the Deathly Hallows had been found in order to bring Harry back and that Harry had come back without them. Harry had told his friends about his conversation with Dumbledore and his friends had thought they had come to the conclusion that the Deathly Hallows were just a legend but that in the end, they did not conquer death. But Harry couldn’t let go.
and it was the most frustrating thing to ever happen to him.
He had told Ron and Hermione about the letter and where he was going, just in case. Clearly, it was from Draco, but these days, Harry knew he could never be so sure. He didn’t want to die before the time was right because then everyone would be even more screwed. And there was something about the letter that felt odd to him. He just couldn’t put his finger on it.
“How is he?” Pansy asked.
Ron spoke up next. "You mean you really don't remember anything from the past five/six years?" Draco shook his head.
bet you were wondering when pansy was gonna come in lmaooo :)
“Well, isn’t that saying something? Considering you stalk him,” she muttered. It was quiet, but Draco still caught it. What did that mean?
am i throwing in a love triangle? no lol. i personally see blaise and draco as kind of doing the whole "I'm pretty sure i like guys maybe i should, *wink wink* kiss one and find out" thing together as lil baby gays yk two boys who are like "this is totally for research about how to kiss a girl we're just practicing" and while they both feel very deeply for each other, its more like a mix and mingle of platonic and romantic feelings and they know that it would never really work out together. harry has nothing to worry about, blaise and pansy just care about draco very very deeply.
highly of yourself,” he joked. Draco laughed a little bit at that.
“Hey, hey,” Harry sat Draco down on the ground, crouching in front of him. “It’s okay. Everything is fine. You’ve got to breathe, Draco, put your head between your knees.” He guided Draco’s head down between his knees and guided him to breathe in and out along with Harry.
At the mention of Pansy, Malfoy choked abruptly on his drink, his hand flying to hit his own chest as he attempted to recover.
“Good. Then bring me
The girl did a double take at Harry, but Draco didn’t know what for. His own mind was busy reeling. “Harry Potter? As in
(See the end of the chapter for
“He trusts you. He thinks you’re on his side. Dare I say he believes he’s fallen in love with you. Prove to me that your loyalty to your Lord is more important. Bring him to me.”
“Pans,
“What do you mean? Who?” Hermione asked.
When Harry was able to open his eyes again, he wasn’t in the forest at all. In fact, he didn’t know where he was.
you know! i've always been like "i don't want to write snape cause i hate snape" but THEN i remembered that i hate jk more so i can just say FUCK your snape and i can write my own!!! wow!!!! look at him communicate!!! how ooc!!!
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” Malfoy said but nothing about it said that he was sorry. “I mean, not that I’m that surprised; I was gone for seven years.”
to trust them with any of this information.”
“I know. And thank you. But, I realized this as a result of realizing something else. Now, Ron I need you take a deep breath and promise me that you aren’t going to hit me for this.”
So that was why he took the job. His own demons could haunt him however much they liked, but they shouldn't continue on to follow some poor kids. That was unacceptable. It was Draco's responsibility to right his wrongs and he would start with those that it was still affecting today. He would start with these kids.
Draco had a hand covering his face as his shoulder shook with silent laughter. “Snape is my godfather.”
“I don’t suppose you know anything about what the Slytherin dorms look like...?” Draco asked hesitantly.
Harry buried his face in his hands, sobbing now. “I’m so sorry, Draco. I’m so sorry, I—“
But it was a lie and he suspected his friends saw it through it regardless. Of course, Harry had hope that the Deathly Hallows would work anyway. How could he consider otherwise?
Completely ignoring the rest of the fight, the rest of everything, Harry ran to Draco, skidding to his knees beside him.
. If that was the case, then Draco never wanted to know.
Everything meaning his upcoming death.
Because, fuck, did he need a drink.

YES draco keeps a button in his pocket at all times in case he ever needs to transfigure anything into anything and when he's done turns it back into a button and puts it back in his pocket. if harry could figure out something like this, it would have saved his ASS many times as an auror
“Actually, we broke up.”
Draco sat up straight in bed, a horrified look on his face.
“You modified my map?”
we love processing past traumas!!
sometimes i feel like i can write in circles with this fic but as you can see by the ending of this chapter, we're really gonna get moving soon and therefore we will have something to talk about that is NOT draco's existential crises.
"Well, shit," he muttered, as he realized something else. Dating Harry Potter was going to be a lot of things like that. Probably a fair share of humiliating from the press, Harry's friends. He supposed he would just have to get used to it and try to get some
There was, indeed, an owl downstairs and many of the Order members were attempting to coax her into being a little calmer. She had a note with her, but was flying around the room, determined to not let anyone take it. A few of the Order members appeared to be bleeding on their hands and forearms from where she must have pecked at them if they tried to take the note.
“What are you doing back, Malfoy?”
“What time is it?” Draco asked, suddenly.
“I literally stalked you sixth year and I couldn’t even get right who you were
Holy shit, how many times had Harry woken up thinking about Draco’s arms wrapped around him when he saved him from the fiendfyre? He had always thought he was being strangely aroused because he had a hero complex? But, no. It was just Draco Malfoy.
“I…I was tasked with a way of making it up to the Dark Lord. But that’s not important right now. What’s important is that they’re invading Hogwarts in two days. You have to be ready, Harry. They’re coming through the Room of Hidden Things. You have to be there, Harry. You have to fight the Dark Lord. It’s now. It’s happening now.”
“I’m fucking in love with him, okay? I’m more than a little worried myself! You think I let this happen on
Suddenly Minervra’s offer of teaching defense wasn’t as exciting as it had been this morning when a bucket of ice water had been dumped on Harry’s head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don't care about what he needs."
“Why?” Draco blurted out.
“Mr. Malfoy, if you refuse to cooperate, I’m afraid I cannot help you.” She paused. “Please look into my eyes.”
__________
Draco said “Okay” and it was barely audible before he succumbed to sleep. When he woke up again, Harry was sitting next to him on the bed, his back against the headboard.
(See the end of the chapter for
That’s when it clicked for Harry why Malfoy had such an intense reaction. “Hey! Our exes are dating each other.”
After sending him a withering glare, Pansy turned around and followed, but not before saying, “I will be back in a moment and we will talk about this. Just after I go help Blaise.”
knows me like Draco does and no one
“It’s time, Harry,” Remus said. And Harry wasn’t stupid—he could tell Bill Weasley had his hand on his wand in his pocket.
Once his heart rate calmed down, he began breathing again, trying to slow it, relax a bit. There were certain memories that would crop back up again and again to haunt him, and the feindfyre was always one. It had been one of the scariest moments of his life and he would have died if Potter hadn't been there.
A little embarrassed now, Harry raised one shoulder in a half-shrug. “Every year Minerva offers me the defense position. It’s still sort of cursed, you know. They haven’t been able to find a teacher that lasts more than a year. But, I don’t know. I don’t feel like I’d be a good teacher.”
This chapter is slightly longer than normal cause we’re getting close to the end so I had more I wanted to fit in :)
Malfoy pressed his lips together and gave a couple of slow nods. “Honestly, Potter, I’ve changed in the last seven years. I’m not the person you knew.” When Malfoy paused, his tongue flicked out and wet his lips. Harry’s eyes widened; the moment passed in slow motion and if he hadn’t been sitting down, he may have fallen. But then Malfoy was talking again and he had to shake himself out of this strange state. “It’s like being around you brings up so many aspects of my personality that I’ve tried to leave behind.”
“Yeah, I was even already starting to forget what you looked like and I spent quite a lot of time staring at you.” Malfoy’s eyebrows went up at his own words and he looked away for a moment before schooling his features back into a passive state. It was like a slap in the face from the past.
The man in the middle let out a harsh laugh through his pain. "It wasn't a fancy trick, Ron. It's called dodging a bludger. You should try it some time." His friends helped him over to set him in a chair and Madam Pomfrey came over and began fussing over him, all with Draco watching on.
!!!!!!THEY WILL BE PROFESSORS NEXT CHAPTER I PROMISE
Would he stop by later? Would he talk to anyone about what was happening with Draco’s family? Would he be able to help Draco?
third year. At least.
“Okay,” she said when she was done. “Let’s take him back to the Manor.”
Kneeling down on the earth next to him, Hermione pulled out her wand. She had brought along with her a shrunken body bag that she was going to bring to size and put Draco’s body in. She would then cover it with the invisibility cloak once more so Harry wouldn’t have to watch and she would bring him back to Malfoy Manor where his mother had arranged a casket and a funeral. He would be buried on the Manor grounds.
But no. Harry lowered his hand and felt there was definitely something there. A body.
The room froze.
Her eyes were dark and piercing, and Draco felt like looking into them made him want to squirm. Something about them was so intense and Draco felt compelled to look away.
“It has been seven years,” Harry laughed.
“Based on the way she’s reacting, she probably won’t even let you read it in front of anyone,” Blaise added, coming to take a seat, looking a little exhausted.
His friends thought about it for a moment. “I don’t think it’s likely,” Hermione said. “If he’s relocating from France to work at Hogwarts, then he would break off any relationship, most likely, unless it was very serious. I think you have a shot. Hey,” she said, her eyes lighting up. “I do occasionally work with Zabini down at the Ministry. I know the two have kept in contact over the years. I can talk to him about it.”
and I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t know how to stop it but Snape came in and he healed you but you were left with some pretty bad scars and I’m so sorry, Draco, I’m so sorry.”
“So what are you going to do, Harry?” Hermione asked, turning to him. “Are you going to ask Draco out?”
“Take off your shirt.”
Blowing out a frustrated breath, Draco turned over on his side, stuffing an arm under his pillow and trying to get comfortable. Tried to shut off his brain and convince himself to actually get some fucking sleep. For once. Go figure.
“You know about that?”
“I am super unobservant.”
Looking up, he glanced at Harry who was still invested in the far wall, but there were fresh tear tracks on his face. “Harry?” Draco asked, tentatively. “Care to explain?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Again, Draco was silent, catching his breath before speaking. “Weak.”
“Draco...” Harry began but Draco held out his hand to stop him. He didn’t need him to say anything right now. It was all crashing down.
There was a pause, then, Draco’s sleeve hovering in the space above his elbow. Harry’s eyes darted down almost immediately and Draco screwed his shut, not even wanting to see Harry’s reaction. He just couldn’t watch. He just couldn’t know.
Draco smiled up at Harry. “I agree. It’s time to rest.”
Here was Draco’s chance to get answers. “Yes. One.”
So, Draco supposed that maybe it could work. Because they were no longer Potter and Malfoy, were they? No. Now they could be Harry and Draco and maybe that could be something else entirely.
If he was being honest, McGonagall and Snape were doing most of the work. Because Harry had reached his breaking point.
“In fact, you are the only seeker at Hogwarts who’s been able to put up a fight against me. You haven’t ever beaten me, though, so don’t go thinking
Once again: breakdowns, bathrooms. It was far too much of a pattern for Draco’s liking.
Pausing now, Draco stared off into the distance in his state of utter terror. Harry remained where he was, giving Draco space.
could be heard from where Harry was at.
“Yes, ma’am,” Draco nodded.
And it wasn’t like he had ever had a right to Harry’s love. In fact, he had never had a right to love Harry at all.
After he had removed the extra wands, he quickly tossed one to Hermione and Harry crumpled in half. He fell onto the forest floor, putting his head in his hands as he began to sob uncontrollably. Ron sat down next to him, hugging his friend close, trying to comfort him.
So here Draco was, at the Room of Hidden Things.
Harry smiled and it was wide and bright and clearly nervous. “Or we could just skip friends.”
im gonna do a "What's Up With The Horcruxes?" info dump probably in the next chapter
“Anything,” Harry said immediately. He couldn’t lose his best friend. If this was going to come between them, he would just have to squash this years long crush.
Without thinking—just on feeling—Blaise reached out and grabbed Pansy’s wrist at the same moment she reached for her wand.
Turns out, sneaking into Hogwarts was way easier than Draco would have predicted, given how much all of the Death Eaters seemed to adamantly refuse to try and “infiltrate” the school.
Is it just me or does this fic have Entirely Different Vibes from when it started lmfao sorry for taking y’all on a TRIP you signed up for a lighthearted fic and uhhh,,,now we’re uh? here??
It wasn’t long before the conversation lulled a bit. “One more question,” Draco said, his voice low.
Sighing again, Bill shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “I don’t know how to tell you both this, but I probably won’t be able to break it quick. Especially if Harry is off it enough mentally to start deuling or something. We’ll need to get his wand away from him and get him at the very least out of the room. Preferably out of the Manor. And if Narcissa has bought into this as well, then there’s her to contend with. I can go talk to the Order and we can try and figure out a plan of action. I’ll be back here in the morning, though. Is it just you two here?”
Blaise looked crushed, staggering to find a chair and put his head between his knees, breathing deep. Pansy on the other hand, promptly began yelling . “You fucking—
“How could you?” Harry started with.
A moment passed and Draco stepped forward, taking the offered broom in his hand and setting his things back down in the stands. “Is it jinxed?”
Besides, Harry had already decided he was going to die and not come back. If there was a chance the Deathly Hallows could work, he put all of his hope in them working for Draco.
His eyes met his own in the mirror. The last several hours had changed his life.
It was Draco fucking Malfoy.
“All I’m saying, Malfoy,” she said, turning to him. “If you need anyone to show you your class schedule, it’s him because he knows it.”
The tension melted out of Harry’s shoulders. After years of fighting this battle, it was time for him to rest. To give it all up. Whether or not Voldemort could be killed after all of his horcruxes were destroyed was beyond Harry’s concern now. He had done his part—he had done all that he could. And now it was time for Harry to set it aside. Maybe, in whatever form of afterlife that existed, he could find a time to be happy. Happy and unafraid and surrounded by those that he loved.
“Draco! So glad to see you're awake." She offered him a potion of some sort. "Drink this."
Harry moved to sit down next to Draco, shrugging. “I think it helps when you have someone not panicking to guide you through it. Hermione taught me some breathing exercises she read about and we tried a million things she’d researched until I could learn to manage them on my own.”
He didn’t even need to squint and try and get a good look at the face of the person. No, he just knew based on how he was flying. It was Potter.
“Yeah, thanks for the philosophy lesson. But turns out, I do know that. Through intimate experience. I didn’t run away, did I? I knew what was going to happen and I accepted it. And of course I know there are far worse things than dying.” Harry began to tear up, thinking of all of his lost loved ones. “When you’re the one that dies, it’s all over. You don’t have to worry about any of it anymore, you don’t have to fight anymore. But to be the one that survives…that’s worse than dying. To watch Sirius fall behind that curtain. To grow up without ever knowing my parents. To watch Draco die in the final moments of the fight—just before things ended for good. Being left behind is far worse than dying.”
It wasn’t another memory, not exactly, but he knew the feeling of having someone poke around in his brain. He didn’t know how, but it was there, like a finger coated in slime just shoving it’s own brutal way through, with no care for how wrecked it would leave Draco. The reaction of his body, of his emotions was all Draco had to go on and it was enough that he was sure glad he knew occlumency.
She straightened her shoulders. “Do we need a reminder of our conversation that day in the Room of Hidden Things?” Harry cringed, remembering her wrenching grip on his ear.
“I heard you did pretty well teaching Dumbledore’s Army.”
Still crying—but softer now—Harry stood up. He gave a small nod and then pulled out his own wand. Casting quick before his friends could stop him, he put another spell on Draco.
Immediately, Harry stood and walked to Draco, hands outstretched. Seeing that Draco was clearly beginning to panic, he placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “Hey, hey,” he said softly, looking into Draco’s eyes. “You need to calm down.”
“I don’t think they should be here,” Ron said abruptly and everyone looked at him all confused.
Harry was close behind him, slipping through the door just before it closed behind Draco. It promptly vanished behind him, but Draco had no time to pay that any mind. Quickly, Harry ran to Draco’s side and threw the invisibility cloak around both their shoulders as they sped down the hallways, Harry tugging on Draco’s arm to guide him back the right way to the hospital wing.
If anyone understood being treated like shit by the wizarding world when he was a mere child, it was Draco. He would walk down a damn street and every witch and wizard he passed would look at him like he was scum on the bottom of their shoe. And maybe he deserved it, yes. He did bear the Dark Mark, after all. But these little eleven year olds? No. No, that was not the Hogwarts Draco knew.
“No, no it’s fine,” Draco laughed back. “He’s kind of an arse, isn’t he?”
“Holy shit, are you okay?” Harry asked, a hand reaching out instinctively.
Oooh!! This fic finally has a chapter total!!! We're almost there, folks!!!
“Thank you,” Draco said quietly.
Slowly, Ron put his hand over Harry’s that was holding the two extra wands. “It’s okay, Harry. He’s the last one—you aren’t going to lose anyone else to this war. I know it hurts. But you have to let him rest. You can’t wait forever.”
If they were dating as coworkers...did that mean...that they had to....
told you to is not important. It doesn’t define you.”
“It’s getting late,” Harry said. “I don’t want to keep you; your interview’s probably early tomorrow.”
“Calm down?" Ron turned towards his friend now, his tone changing from lighthearted to a tad angry. "Harry, he's done nothing but insult us for five and a half years. I don't particularly care if he's distressed."
also if you feel like this is kind of moving slowly you are not alone bc that is how i feel and i am so sorry i promise i'll pick it up soon lmao
That's when he remembered: Harry. Groaning, he fell back onto his pillow, his thoughts somewhere else entirely now. How was he supposed to date Harry when he was still dealing with all of this shit? It wasn't exactly fair to Harry, was it? He deserved someone who didn't come with so much baggage, or at least didn't have a trunk clearly labeled "Harry Potter."
how would yall feel about some uhhhh pansmione in this fic?? goifjoijfoij dont get me wrong i love romione but...
Blaise lets go of me!” She began shaking him off furiously.
“You made incredibly unwise choices, young Malfoy. I know you are going to do everything in your power to correct this egregious mistake so that I am not forced to dispose of your entire disloyal family. After all, I can’t know how far your motivations and actions spread.”
The entire room seemed like someone had hit the pause button as both of his friends processed. Neither moved, neither spoke and minutes seemed to pass, time moving in agonizing slowness for Harry.
Oh my goodness, this fic is over!! I'm not crying, you're crying (well, there's a possibility we're both crying). This fic has been with me so long it's going to be so strange to not have it anymore!! But if you do like this fic, I have tons of other Drarry, including another finished long multichap To The Memory of Love and an in progress multichap Back in Town and seriously yall please user subscribe because I will soon be starting my latest drarry multichap Silver Tone Rich Kids which I am so so so excited for!!
When Draco stirred himself out of his slumber, the shadows patterning the ceiling had shifted, and the room was tinged a different shade than it had been before. A quick
"I think Malfoy wants you to stay for tea," Harry says, realizing the rock cakes are for Hagrid. Malfoy asked Luna what Hagrid would like for tea. Malfoy made Hagrid rock cakes.
"Well it's not a contest, but I don't think we're there yet," Hermione says.
Draco settled on Harry’s face, imagining that he’d see some smirk there, see some grin, but he didn’t. Harry was looking at him, all concentration.
They're saved further awkwardness by their timely arrival at the restaurant and Harry breathes a sigh of relief that they don't have to talk about Lucius Malfoy.
his coat, and pushing his arms through the sleeves. “That pregnancy test you talked about on Tuesday? Seems like it might be a good idea.”
Harry would actually quite like a quilt. It's the sort of thing your grandmother would make for you if you had a grandmother.
“Maybe I’m allergic,” Draco said, nodding to the flowers that Marcus had kindly swathed with a protective layer of magic.
Draco is still in the outfit he was wearing that morning, but Other Harry is wearing a large white tunic that stops just under the knees and looks ridiculous with his shin-high black socks and white  trainers.
At some point it occurs to him to let Ron and Hermione know where he is. When he Floos to their flat it's dark outside and Ron and Hermione are eating beans on toast at the kitchen table.
"Yeah, yeah you're right," Harry says. "But my point is, I think I get that. I think maybe I can understand why he was the way he was and how he's changed and sometimes that seems like enough. But then we run into Neville and I think it's not enough. And Hermione's using big words like forgiveness and asking me what would be enough and I just don't know."
"Hmm?" Ron says absently, wiping down the counters. "In what?"
"About what?" Draco says, on the heels of another long yawn.
Harry and Malfoy end up at the same wizarding department store as before, which has about a million floors according to the buttons in the elevator. Malfoy presses the button for "Magically Manipulated Fibers for All Occasions."
"Sure," Hermione says distractedly, shuffling through her books. "Did you know the last several headmasters have all given Binns consistently negative reviews, but without the Board of Governor's approval are unable to do anything about it?"
“Heard and understood,” Draco said, trying not to let his feelings about what Greg had said show visibly on his face, “though I expect I was talking about racing brooms when I was a twelve-year-old.”
"Malfoy," Harry says rather tonelessly. Maybe he ought to be able to summon up some anger or annoyance or something but he just takes a scalding sip of tea instead, setting the cup carefully down on the only free spot on his desk. Harry's not messy, at least he doesn't think he is. He thinks he would be rather neat if he had the time to do anything more than collapse at his desk between raids.
wine for the three of them, but he didn’t murmur when Draco demurred, and asked for a Pumpkin Juice instead.
Draco wobbled over to the twin bed, and threw himself down on the covers. He was really glad there was still an hour for him to snooze before their pre-game warm-up session began.
Draco felt a wave of affection for his lovely mummy. At first, she’d hated his professional Quidditch career, and the risks involved with flying professionally, but she’d never stood in the way of his living his life in the way he saw fit. That she listened to Puddlemere’s games on the wireless – and passed judgment upon them – felt like unspoken approval.
Three days later, Elianna arrived once again. This time the little bird had a tiny box attached to her leg. Draco half-wondered whether to send the creature back to Grimmauld Place, gift still attached, but then he decided not to be so petty. Elianna dived onto the table, looking for treats, already familiar with the kitchen of Half-Moon Place.
lube from the chest of drawers beside his bed, and then Draco watched as he moved downwards so that he was positioned between Draco’s legs. Bloody hell, but Draco wanted to see this. He lifted himself up on his elbows, wanting to watch, but his head lolled back just as soon as Harry swallowed his prick.
It's three in the morning before a Healer comes out to the waiting room. Patients and families have come and gone but Harry's stayed, waiting. The Healer calls Harry's name and Harry jumps up, spilling cold tea on himself, but he hardly notices.
"Hermione wouldn't let Ron and I shrink her books, she says the text looks funny when it's returned to size."
"Some wine has more tannins which are bitter or more minerals, or is aged in different barrels, or a million other things that I don't actually know because I'm not a wine snob, but which make some wines a more, let's say, acquired taste. But everyone loves a Sangiovese. At least that's what Andrea told me."
Draco massaged his forehead and sagged into a kitchen chair. What was Harry doing, hanging about in bookshops and apothecaries? He was under the impression that he’d been very clear in Café Quendryth. He didn’t need any extra attention, and he didn’t need fuss. Harry had been perfectly clear too: he wasn’t ready, not for a baby or a relationship.
“I might have fallen off my broomstick,” he stalled, voice croaky, “or fainted, because-"
"How come?"
“He doesn’t,” Draco replied, unsure how he knew that he could be so candid with Arthur, only knowing that it felt right. “We’re just very good friends that are having a baby together. Those were his exact words to Victoire earlier, and I have to accept that. It needs to be enough. The baby… Well, they’ll have two dads that love them, two dads that’ll put them before anything else in the world, and that’s more than Harry or I ever had. They’ll be more loved than anything.”
Harry wakes up to Petrol pawing at his leg, which he realises is very much uncovered by the Invisibility Cloak. He barely has time to cover himself back up before Malfoy’s wand alarm goes off with the sound of twinkling bells that grates on his ears. His neck is stiff and his body is sore and Harry needs to find a way to go back home.
Tucking the book back into its place on the shelf, Harry crouches in front of the cupboards under. He rifles around stacks of board games and what looks like an album of a sailboat holiday with too many pictures of a (admittedly, very good looking) topless, sun-kissed, shiny with sweat and salt Draco Malfoy.
They look at each other with loving eyes until Harry smacks the table, "You are ignoring the main crisis here! I kissed Malfoy!"
Harry Apparated into Half-Moon the next day with several paper bags in his hands.
"Yeah, and then threw his money around. Old habits die hard, right?"
"Couldn't sleep last night."
But then Harry thinks about this morning, Malfoy bringing him breakfast in bed, the vase with the flower, and the chai tea Malfoy got him, and the lovely breakfast he made from scratch for Harry. He thinks about his slow kisses and how he's helping Hermione and made vegan cupcakes for Luna and rock cakes for Hagrid.
have the right to get angry anytime anyone brings up what a full-time wanker and part-time fascist you were. You don't get to go through life never owning up to that."
"Oh just—sit down," Malfoy snaps, having to reach around Harry for a spatula.
Draco simply lies there for close to an hour listening to Harry's deep breaths and watching the sunlight start to slant through Harry's golden curtains. He has to fight the desire to stroke Harry's hair because he doesn't want to wake him. So instead he looks his fill at Harry's long dark eyelashes that he would steal for himself if he could, and marvels at the shape of Harry's shoulders under his disgusting tee shirt. Draco will take Harry to get real pajamas today.
Goyle didn’t answer, but he did as Draco asked of him. The Wizard’s Choice brand wasn’t much different to the first pregnancy test, and the result wasn’t any different either. This time the potion turns a pinky purple, which indicated that he was about six weeks in. Quite honestly, the result couldn’t have been clearer, had
Harry didn’t offer any more information and they walked on in companionable silence. The pair of them soon entered
Surely there was no way that Arthur could be right? After all, it had been Harry, not he, that had presented the whole co-parenting deal and told their Mediwitch, and Molly, and anyone else that would listen that the pair of them were nothing but friends. That being said, Arthur had known Harry since he was eleven, and been the nearest thing he had to a father for all of that time. Perhaps he saw something that Draco had been missing.
This time, Harry was sitting beside him. The wizard had been perfectly supportive, and Draco couldn’t be happier. Very soon he’d get to see his baby once more. He wondered how much bigger they’d grown in the last month, and whether he’d be able to make out any of their features yet.
Harry takes a tiny bite of the yellow mush, then a larger bite, and discovers it mostly tastes like honey and something… floral?
"You don't know what you're talking about, Potter, as usual."
As he pulled the sheets over him, Draco heard the lyrics to that stupid, asinine song, over and over, a broken spell in his brain.
Draco looked inside the bags while Harry toed off his trainers. There was a box of six croissants inside, as well as a bunch of bananas, several shiny green apples and even a box of Chocolate Frogs. “The whole team isn't waiting in the kitchen,” Draco replied, knowing that he sounded a little brusque. “What’s all this? Your weekly shop?”
Draco wondered for a single mad moment whether Apparating the pair of them to the bedroom might be a decent idea, and Draco would have, except that was the moment Harry’s hands moved lower, clasped him hard on the hips. Their groins converged in an undulating movement and Draco felt the hard, heavy shape of Harry’s prick. Bloody hell, but he was big.
Harry’s exploring is interrupted by loud meowing coming from the upper floors. Soon enough, a gorgeous black cat leisurely makes its way onto the landing and down the stairs, complaining loudly about Harry’s presence. Harry’s well experienced with Crookshanks’ crankiness so he stays still and waits to see what this cat’s temperament is like. The meowing doesn’t stop, but at least it doesn’t turn to hissing. The cat stops right in front of him at the bottom of the stairs and watches him inquisitively, big green eyes looking at Harry’s own. Then, the cat must decide this Harry doesn’t smell or look too different from the Harry it knows, and it stretches on his back paws, front paws reaching up to Harry’s jeans.
Louis St Clare, in dire need of a new London pad, had almost snapped Draco’s hand off when he’d mooted the idea of leasing Half-Moon Place to the younger man. Draco only hoped that the Seeker would treat the place well. It was, after all, filled with some of the best memories of Draco’s life. It was in Half-Moon Place that Draco had conceived their baby, and Harry and he had fallen in love within its walls.
"But there really was quite a bit of tongue, Harry. Accuracy is important."
Hagrid has to bend in half to get through the door, then he stands looking like he feels out of place just inside the door. He's holding a large bouquet that's mostly Scottish thistle and purple heather and Harry knows he went out and picked it by hand and loves him immensely.
Draco hadn’t expected to be told any different, and he knew, really, that he ought to be devastated.
In the end, Draco decided to let Harry sleep on. After all, who was he to deny a fellow wizard a lie-in? Sundays were absolutely the best, most marvellous day of the week. Sundays meant no training, no Marcus Flint shouting in his ear, and the freedom to do whatever he wanted. Draco wondered if Harry and he might enjoy a shower together before they embarked on round two.
"This is not pretension, Potter. I can admit I have many pretensions but this is not one of them. Good bread is transcendent, it's a spiritual experience. I read that religious Muggles have bread eating rituals during their ceremonies, and they're on to something, Potter."
The sun is setting before Malfoy stirs, complaining that his mouth tastes gross. Harry kisses him and confirms it is in fact gross and Malfoy feebly hits Harry on the shoulder.
Even Adrianne hadn’t been too perturbed about her second house move in two months.
Despite Draco’s bold words on Diagon Alley, Draco still waited three more days before telling his mother.
. Those had been Harry's words in Café Quendryth, but they were true for him too. He looked away with a defiant resolve. He couldn’t look at Harry’s face, for he knew if he did, the words would spill from his mouth. He’d ask Harry to stay.
Harry, gentlemanly to the last, opened the door with a flourish, and held it open for him.
"I'm not babbling. You're wearing them wrong."
Draco nodded.
“Don’t judge me because I’m fancy,” Draco snorted, amused. Draco seized a particularly plump velvet pillow from beside him, and tried to side-swipe the other wizard with it.
After dinner, Harry wanted to show Draco a Muggle film called
– but he also recognised that now, ten minutes before their hospital appointment, wasn’t the time to bicker or to pick fault. Instead, Draco let himself be seduced by the illusion that he was still beautiful – still alluring – and that Harry’s words were the truth.
"Are you feeling that depressed about our date?"
"Not currently, no. Are you going to Apparate my cupcakes or not?"
They eat in silence. Harry has no idea what to say to Malfoy.
smile, and Harry, without even thinking, smiles back.
Which meant that, if the Curse-Breaking team was right about what the curse on the trunk entailed, Harry was somewhere in the future, the past or in a different timeline where a totally different Harry lives. Or doesn’t live. Merlin knows whose house this actually is. This is just what Harry needs on a Tuesday evening.
When Malfoy does finish the lasagna, it is, predictably, the best lasagna Harry's ever had.
The kettle whistles and Harry gets up from the table to pour the tea.
"I did, yes. In October." Harry hadn't spent much time wondering what Malfoy got up to during his house arrest but he certainly wouldn't have imagined this alternate universe version of Malfoy who smiles sweetly when asked about his homemade apple butter.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He chewed his green bean slowly, trying to kill time before he answered. The idea of Molly Weasley clucking over him, and the brothers Weasley staring at his tummy like he was a Muggle circus freak wasn’t appealing in the slightest. Draco was sure that there’d be a dozen loaded comments before they even got sat at the table. The Weasleys were, however, the nearest thing that Harry had to a family, and they were going to be an integral part of his little one’s life. A part of him felt chuffed that Harry cared enough to want them all to have a constructive relationship.
Harry does think there's something there about responsibility. Harry never got to choose what he ate growing up but he still decided not to be a Death Eater. But perhaps because Malfoy expects him to zero in on culpability, Harry defiantly doesn't want to. Instead he says, "I never got to choose what to eat either. It was always scraps and leftovers, if anything. But they made me cook for them which is probably why I don't like cooking."
For once in his life, Draco was lost for words. His heart seemed to have taken up residence in his throat, and all he could manage was a nod of his head.
“Actually.” Harry paused to burst out laughing. “Okay, so little history lesson. It’s our second year, right? So the chamber of secrets got opened, yeah? And—“
hey y'all!!!
lol my philosophy class is talking about personal identity and what makes us us and like different theories about identity and i feel like i am HELLA projecting onto this fic lmaooooo
“Shit,” Draco cursed. “Three hours have passed. What the
I changed the timeline. It had originally been only three years after the war, but I didn’t want any of the Hogwarts kids to have been at Hogwarts during the war so we are now seven years after the war. That means that the students that will be seventh years in the fall when Draco and Harry start teaching were first years when Draco, Harry, etc. were in their eighth year. I have changed everything in the past two chapters (at least I think if you catch anything relating to this timeline that I hadn’t fixed, please tell me). Also, because changing this timeline would have meant that Harry and Ginny had been dating for seven years and Harry could not move on that fast after that long of a relationship, I made it their second breakup (there was time between the first and second part so basically Harry and Ginny had only been dating for about a year this time.)
Draco gasped, her body arching away from the bed, towards Harry's hand. Her own hand flew to her breast, incredibly sensitive, and tried to caress her nipple from over her nursing bra, the sensation faint but still pleasurable. She closed her eyes, hard, biting her bottom lip so she wouldn't moan out loud. He touched her everywhere, surprising her, which made controlling herself even harder.
“I had some news earlier. Good news. My ex is having a baby. And I’m pleased, she’s a good person and a great mum. And she’ll be happy. I suppose... I suppose I just want a bit of that happiness for myself.”
Now they were coming back to the hotel, and Draco felt his body getting hotter and hotter. He'd have to sneak to Harry's bedroom, or the other way around, but it would be amazing to sleep with him and just feel him closer.
"Harry... Let me live me illusion, just a little bit. Let me think I could have you forever, that we could have a family and be happy. I
Harry found himself murmuring. “I want to give you my mouth... and my cock. I’m going to give you everything you desire...”
She almost came again feeling her body get filled with his come. She rested her forehead on his shoulder, breathing heavily as she tried to calm her body down.
Draco had called what they had a fling, something for a bit of fun. He wrote that he was going to honor a betrothal contract to Astoria Greengrass. That it was time to live up to his family name. He had even signed it best wishes, like he didn’t care that he was ripping out Harry’s heart.
The two of them had never been so close. Draco could feel the heat of Harry’s body. His green eyes flashed with amusement and his plush lips were so close that Draco could easily have closed the space between them, and stolen the kiss he had wanted for so long.
Harry’s awe at the sight of Venice was entirely replaced by blissful lust at the sight of his husbands soft, white skin, exposed inch by inch as he so, so slowly undid each of his buttons.
“H-haaaaaarry...!”
that got her back to sleep. Our little Mini loves you so much... And that’s why there are two of us, Draco. Because we’re a team. I’ll always be there to look after you.”
Still, they were meeting that afternoon.
on the job now. I’m completely at my leisure now, if you’re not busy...”
“You want us to get a dog? I've never... I've never
. I don’t want Nott sniffing around you, and I want that red mark on your neck to ache if we’re not close... I know how it makes me sound, but there’s something about you that makes me unable to help it.”
“Yes... Yes, Harry, please... Do it... I love it so much... I love you so much...”
“Honestly Draco, I’m not convinced that dogs do erm...
The Brazilian team were quick, supple and won over his team with ease.
With Harry's assault on him, Draco just couldn't last. His whole body was screaming for release, and he didn't think he was capable of holding it any longer.
His knickers were ruined, completely wet with slick. He didn't want to touch himself, because he couldn't do what he wanted. So he cleaned himself as he could and left the bathroom, grabbing his smartphone and opening the book he was currently reading.
Harry placed his hand over the other man’s, straddling the space his has left. He started to move the hand slowly up the shaft of his cock, taking his time. He wanted to show him exactly what he wanted, and how he loved to be touched.
But this was Draco’s night, Draco’s experience. Waiting in the half-darkness of Draco’s room, Harry waited to see what his lover’s verdict was.
He had truly thought those days were over.
“My predecessor didn’t run a very tight ship, Mr. Malfoy. The clientele in my department have some very complex needs, and I have spent the week organising a list of the most critical. Here, Ms. Moretti has been the
your secretary mentioned! Now, allow me to take you both on a tour of the facility.”
It was a few moments before Harry’s head was finally clear and he was able to finally catch his breath. The pair of them were sweat-slicked and sticky, a knotty tangle of limbs.
When she moved, though, she felt that her bladder was kind of full. Why had she a full bladder if she had just pee'd all over herself? She touched the wet sheets and brought her fingers to her nose.
Harry felt incredible, his body humming with pleasure. He felt satisfied, completed, in a way that sex has never previously managed. Switching off the shower, he picked up Draco easily. It felt wonderful to have him in his arms, so light, warm and silky skinned.
“Would you like to come and lay here in my arms... I’m not asking you to do anything erotic... I know it’s dangerous for Jim, I just want us to be close. You can tell me what you’d like to do tomorrow before the Quidditch match.”
Harry undid the tie holding Draco’s arms up, and kissed and rubbed his omegas wrists warmly.
Draco really hoped Lyra's room was a good sound blocker because the sound leaving his throat was
Draco’s mouth was so hot and wet, his tongue running in ribbons all over the underside of his cock. He could feel his control start to loosen, his body start to slip out of his control.
“Muggle football? Really? It isn't nearly as exciting as quidditch. Why do you even watch it?”
Draco thought for a moment about what Harry had said.
them with a quick swipe of his wand. That would serve Harry right.
"Also, if you talked to him about it, it would sound that you both are fighting to claim me. It's a situation I'd like to avoid," specially because, of course Harry was bigger, but Nott was younger and he didn't want to give Nott the change to claim him by force against other alpha. No, Draco loved to have his own choice in it, thank you very much.
Brazilians are
that. They've told me plenty of times. I work hard because I love this company and I love my work, but I know this is going to be my job just until I'm married. Once I turn 30, they'll force me to make a decision. Either marry the alpha they've chosen me, or don't marry at all."
Draco kissed Harry on the lips, finally feeling his feet again, and licking his lips after.
argue for the rest of time about this, but I don’t intend to leave you, so the best thing is to bloody well move on, and actually discuss what we are going to
“I... I fell the same about you, Harry... You are my everything... My love, my friend, my family... I can't imagine not having you with me every day of my life... Hn...”
“I have mine, darling, thank you but you're sticky,”
Harry pulled off, his body on fire with lust.
“Well, if my princess wants a dog, who am I to argue?” Harry said decisively. “If you don’t have any further worries Draco, then I’ll book a visit.”
"I'm sorry for today... I... I loved everything you did to me. Don't worry, work will be just fine tomorrow. Do you want me to walk you to the door?"
they always get what I want!  And I can only look and wish it was me! First, brothers and sisters. Then, you. Then, they were at the right side of the war, and now... Now they've got a baby, too?!”
He slid the babies down the slide, and Lyra caught them as they reached the bottom. She was a wonderful sister, and Harry wondered briefly whether Ginny and Blaise would have any more children. Harry loved babies, and he couldn’t imagine that Draco and he were going to stop for a while.
“I’ve got to be honest, Draco. I actually have no idea if they’ve got monkeys or not. And we won’t get red, we’ll use a sun repelling charm... And insect repelling charms as well. You can still floo, so the travel won’t be too much of a challenge either... Draco. I think I’d really like to go. Wood says that the
Draco closed his eyes, feeling calm and happy like he never did before. He was a bit worried of how he would leave the building without people talking about Harry, but he guessed that if Harry waited for him on the parking lot, it would be fine.
It all felt rather sexy really, and Harry could feel a hot band of lust run from his fingers to his cock... Draco’s shivering skin and breathy moans weren’t helping the situation and Harry fidgeted, suddenly finding himself rather hard under Draco’s smooth backside.
He was secretly pleased about Draco’s reaction when he’d asked about Lucius. He’d not wanted the evil old man anywhere near his baby, but he still had to consider that Jasmine was part of the Malfoy family; what did he know about grandparents? He’d never had any, and Jasmine had little enough family as it was.
It was deliciously real, and Draco moved a little before he realised it was, indeed, real. He slowly opened his eyes, and sighed happily when he saw Harry.
Draco felt her heart blow with want and happiness... His? Her?  It was still confusing to her own mind, because she felt like it was wrong to feel like a girl. It was wrong, and weird, but it was also so,
Harry did as Draco asked, holding him tight and nuzzling the soft white-blond hair on his beloved’s head that fit so neatly beneath his chin. Draco was so petit that Harry’s arms fit round him easily, and so delicate, lithe and wonderful.
Then, so quickly he might have apparated, Draco was in front of him, gripping his arms, and pulling Harry into a bone crushing hug. It was almost more than he could process, but Harry just held on for dear life.
"Harry... Are you really comfortable with that? Bonding with me... You know... Starting something new even when you have a daughter already? I don't want to... I don't want to fuck up things. I truly love you and I want to make you happy."
Harry frowned upon hearing the sound of his mobile. Who wanted him at nine on a Sunday? He jumped up, reaching over for his phone, anxious that it might be an incident with Lyra...
Draco looked up at Harry, eyes a little wide, and held him by his shoulders. It was all good and delicious, yes. Draco was shivering with the thought of having Harry so deep inside him, but... not like that. Harry was used, so used to fuck him in his cunt that maybe he had forgotten that it didn't quite work the same as just shoving it in.
. Draco has been nearly alpha in his presentation, confident and powerful in his space. These submissive little omegas were all very cute, but Draco was like no other omega he’d ever met. Harry stroked his heavy, half-hard cock absentmindedly as he watched Sunday night television, not focussed whatsoever on the programme.
Harry pushed Draco back into the bed, roughly pushing his legs apart. Harry licked a clear strip down the sides of Draco’s vaginal channel.
omega’s cocks. He loved their beauty, their shape; how elegant they were in comparison to his inelegant monstrosity of a cock. And Draco’s, he thought was the most exquisite he’d ever seen.
All the fashionable shops were available here, and they were definitely expensive enough that Draco would be satisfied that they were good enough for their little worm.
“I’m aware of how cruel the world is Draco,” Harry said softly. “And I know you’re not a reactionary omega. But you’re only alive once, love. This is your one and only chance on the Earth. Even if it’s not for me, you should talk to your parents. I don’t know. You’re a good person, Draco. You deserve the world.”
Pushing against Draco’s burning heat, Harry pushed into his beloved, opening him, showing him with his fingers how much he was desired.
would be disgusted. It's... It's just... My body...” Draco tried to say, but he couldn't. He couldn't say 'menstruation' without feeling like a stupid person. So he pleaded. He pleaded with his eyes that Harry could understand it.
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco almost ripped his shirt over. He was still using a nursery bra, but soon took it off too. His skin was on fire, and he needed that to feel alive. Harry's hands and voice and touch... Everything was making him desire so much more.
Resting on the very edge of his quilt cover were the burgundy boxer shorts that Harry wore so often. Merlin, but they were only a few centimetres from his pillow. The scruffy prat must have chucked them when he’d taken them off. So uncouth! Draco’s first thought was to shove them off his bed with a disgusted huff. His second was to
Holding him close, enjoying the race of the other man’s heart and the heat of his body, Harry whispered into his ear.
Looking at Draco in the eye, he could that his partner was terribly upset. He bit back his questions, and instead stood there in silence. He wanted to see what had happened to so devastate him so much.
Honestly, the puppy couldn’t come home quickly enough.
on him. His lips were on Harry as soon as he could manage, his hands grabbing Harry's hair to bring him down so they could kiss perfectly. Draco's body was on fire. Finally, they'd do it.
“I'm pampered because you spoiled me,” Draco smiled, closing her eyes and sighing, controlling the need to moan. It was only a feet massage. “Hmm... What can you do for me, Jamie? I guess you can massage my legs all up, maybe my thighs... Also...”
Harry should've known that this wasn't such a simple thing to do.
“Love, she doesn’t know she doesn’t want to sleep... She’s just a baby, and she isn’t tired. If she’s refusing to feed, I’ll take her for a bit. You have a shower, make us both a cup of tea and try to relax... You’re exhausted, darling. You’re expectations are far too high.”
“It’s going to be the most gorgeous night of my life as well. Thinking about how hard I’m going to make you, how much I’ll enjoy stripping you bare. What are you wearing now?”
Draco didn't answer straight away. He thought for a while, inhaling Harry's unique scent that did wonders to calm him. He felt sleepy all of sudden, and had to pry his thoughts out of his head.
He let Harry tie him, a little unsure, but as he felt that, if he tugged hard enough, the restrains would fall, he relaxed. It was just a play, and Draco felt excited to know Harry wanted him like this... Vulnerable. Because then, the alpha could take care of him.
He held tight to Draco in the moments post-orgasm. Harry needed to omega to know he was respected and valuable. But he also knew he’d have to take himself away before passion overtook him.
“Better than good Draco. So, so wonderful... you’re making me crave you more every time we touch... I want to share everything with you, bond you to me always...”
No, masturbating it was.
“....We can talk, Draco. What do you want to tell me?”
Harry felt privileged to be able to touch Draco like he was doing. The kiss was warm, intimate and held all the promise of their future. Harry deepened the kiss, finding Draco’s mouth incredibly soft.
“I can't wait to meet our baby, Harry... I'll try so hard to be a good mummy... “
"I'm where I'm meant to be, Mother. Not all the money in the world will make me go back home."
“I’ll see you tomorrow, sweetheart,” Harry replied, softly, from his bed.
“Harry?” she opened the bathroom door, looking for him.
And Draco
“May I have the pleasure this date?” Harry asked formally, presenting Draco with twelve roses he’d ordered from reception. He supposed they might be a little tacky, but he thought that Draco might appreciate the romance.
“Don't worry about me, Harry. I'm a healer, I'm sure if I can fix your almost broken balls I can heal a post-partum stretch,” Draco winked one eye, and smiled when he talked about taking a photo. “Yes, let's send it to her... But I'd rather have all three of us in the picture. Maybe one of the mediwizards can take a picture of us? Now you can take one of hers... She's small, but she's so beautiful. I think I want her nursery filled with pictures of her...”
Draco wasn’t entirely convinced by Harry’s warm words. Family, when he was growing up, hadn’t been this loose association of loved ones that Harry believed in. Family had been synonymous with blood, and ancestors, and surnames. It hadn’t been this ramshackle collective of wix, as diverse as the building that held them. Without even thinking, Draco took hold of Harry’s hand and held it tightly, nerves rolling through him.
The witch folded the details of Twenty-two Marlborough Road back into her satchel, and when she spoke, she addressed Draco and Harry both.
Harry furrowed his brow and took another swallow of his coffee. “Well?” he prompted.
"Yes," Malfoy says.
His brain felt a little bit like he was Stupefied. Draco spent two minutes reading, and rereading the instructions, while he willed his hands to stop trembling. Once he was satisfied that he knew precisely what to do, he took a breath, unbuttoned his trousers and got on with the task at hand.
"That's your small trip? We're going to Italy?"
The lights above burnt in a scorching
He tries to distract himself from this weird situation by trying to decipher what’s for lunch solely by the ingredients on the counter, but the collection leaves him stumped. Maybe Other Harry has yet to bring a crucial ingredient out of the fridge.

"It looks very… green." It looks like it tastes gross is what Harry's really thinking. "What's it taste like?"
"Of course you don't. You give the fabric to Ms. Quincy and she makes the quilt."
"I told you neither have I."
"Potter, are you ever going to show me your bedroom? I did help you buy everything in it, I think I should get to see the fruits of my labor."
