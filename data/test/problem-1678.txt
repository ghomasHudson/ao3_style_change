After what seemed like forever, Kingsley, at the head of the table, was the first to react. The Head Auror silently stood, raising his glass. Harry was confused—what was going on? He looked at Sirius and Remus, who had found their own spaces at the table—they just shrugged at him.
They all shared a laugh at that, but the room was thick with malaise. It was clear that big changes were on the horizon, and their small semblance of childhood seemed to be further in the rearview of their current situation. Unsure of what was to come, all four were happy to stick it out together, and try to plan to the best of their abilities. Only time would determine the outcome.
“We were trying to give you the best shot possible. We didn’t think Voldemort would target a Halfblood over a Pureblood.”
Draco closed his eyes in frustration. “I guess I’ll just have to work on keeping myself in check around the full moon.”
“I’m not saying he isn’t.” Ron shifted uncomfortably, obviously getting ready to say something he was unsure of. “You’ve obviously grown close this summer…”
dead people can’t do that unless you were a demon of some sort.” He squeezed him tightly. “Welcome back, Jamie.”
Luckily, his father was ready to take over. “To James and Lily. To Alice and Frank. To Marlene. To Albus. To Severus. To Nymph. To Dobby. To Regulus. To Lavender. To Fred. To those we’ve lost but are still with us. To the Order.”
And wait they did. Remus had explained to Molly about Sirius’s return, who didn’t seem to be overall pleased about it but was nevertheless happy for Harry. She said she’d make enough food for everyone on Christmas, ex-convicts included.
Remus blanched at that. “No humans are allowed at the colony, I’m afraid. Though I suppose I can ask…”
A week later, just in time for the holiday break, Draco was given clearance. While he was still healing, like Harry, they had given him the condition to return weekly for spell work and physical therapy, with a Healer coming to Hogwarts after the holiday.
Sirius looked to be torn between two responses. He had the strangest feeling that Molly was baiting him. At Remus’s warning glare, he chose kindness. “No, it’s fine: I was just a bit surprised is all, as I’m sure everyone is about me.” He smiled. “I would have gotten everyone presents but I’ve been a bit tied up. Happy Christmas.”
Pansy let out a huff of a laugh. “Do you think they cared about testing last year? Not bloody likely. We barely learned a thing. The 6th years will be taking OWLs this year, too. It’s been a disaster all around.” She glanced at Harry, who gave her a tentative smile and a wave. She looked back over at the blonde, eyes narrowing. “I’m not letting your stupid little feelings stop me from finishing school Draco—take your Lucius impression elsewhere.”
“Not immediately.” Draco deflated slightly. Noting this, Remus provided more. “I think you should have your first moon here. It helps to be surrounded by a pack – less self-harm occurs. Besides, you might not be too thrilled to find who your roommates are when we get to the safe house.”
Harry didn’t know that part and was suddenly upset all over again. “These fucking war games! This is why I have all of this pressure. I have to end this. It has to end soon.”
“Can we just try again, Draco?” he had asked one night when Draco actually decided to grace the Slytherin Common Room with his presence, Theo be damned.
Draco held him and gently asked, “What’s this now at 6 a.m.?” He didn’t mind the affectionate barrages so prominent in Gryffindors, but having the wind knocked out of him this early in the morning was not high up on his daily agenda. Still, Harry wouldn’t do this without good reason, making Draco a quite worried. “Is everything okay?” he asked.
“Where’s mum? Why are you here? You hate me.” Lucius pressed the glass into Draco’s lips again and he drank. The cool water eased his throat a little. “Tea would be better.”
Harry shrugged in response, retaking his seat and cracking open his book again. "Remus will be in to check on you, he said."
Blaise grimaced, not expecting Harry to know about those particular Pureblood traditions. “I’m not trying to court him.”
Harry sighed again. “Yes, I’ll tell him.” He stood. “You can go back to bed—I’m alright now, thanks.”
He sat at the fireplace willing Harry to return late that evening. It was too dangerous out there for him to be exposed in whatever sort of elements they were subject to. Draco knew, however, that Harry would not be as daft as to return to Grimmauld Place after so much time had passed: there was no way to tell if it was safe. Besides, it wasn’t as though there were anymore horcruxes lurking within the walls of that old house. No, there was no reason for Harry to return, not when the entire wizarding world rested on his shoulders.
“What are these?” Harry asks, brushing his fingertips over the maps, the paper thin and almost translucent. Must be very old, and very valuable.
He wants to bring up Pansy again, but somehow he knows that Draco already knows. Maybe they have known for a while, or maybe they knew from the start, the moment Harry touched Pansy at Draco’s command.
Draco takes one last look behind his shoulder—Harry quickly ducks in an alleyway—before slipping into a public girl’s restroom. After making sure no one sees him, Harry follows after him, quietly creeping through the tiled archway. Inside Draco stands in front of the mirrors, a velvet box laying on the counter next to the sink.
“This brings me to my next two points. As many of you saw upon arrival, the castle has sustained severe damages from the Battle fought on its grounds. Some have criticized my decision to allow students to see such ruin at a place that many of you call home. However, I do not wish to protect you from the tragedy, because, indeed, all of you in some shape or form have already witnessed―if not experienced first-hand―the suffering that took place last May. As such, I see an opportunity for all of us to take a hand in healing this castle, in the hopes that it may also bring us comfort in times of sorrow, and reunite us in a common purpose.”
“Well, I missed you, of course.” But she knows that’s not really why he keeps coming back here night after night. Regardless, she appreciates his attempt at charming her.
It was still strange to consider Draco their ally instead of their sworn enemy. He had been the one to let in Death Eaters into Hogwarts last year, after all. But Harry was there, that night. In the end, Draco had accepted Dumbledore’s offer to help and had fled with them almost immediately after, as his family had disinherited him and had sent Death Eaters to kill him.
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbles against Draco’s stomach, wrapping his arms tightly around him. “I love you.”
“It’s not,” Malfoy muttered, just before bringing the cigarette up to his lips again. The gesture was carefree and languid, like a cat’s yawn or a lover’s caress. Both intimate and remote.
Of course, perhaps it’s easier to accept darkness in others when you have it in yourself. Is that why they gravitate so helplessly towards each other? Two twin flames burning brighter, dangerously brighter, together? He remembers looking at the Dark Mark, a black bruise against pale skin, and thinking that they were the same, that he had that Mark tattooed on his heart instead of his skin.
“That’s a very convincing argument,” Hermione says with a smirk. “But there’s only one small problem.”
“No, you’re not my father.” Harry walks over to the Pensieve, where dark swirls of memory slither like snakes in the water. His voice comes out flat. “Tom Riddle killed him.”
Harry makes an irritated movement with his body, as if physically repelled by his presence, but Draco persists, shoving Harry with more force, until Harry is compelled to retaliate, grabbing Draco’s arm and pushing him, breathing heavily. He tries to shove him away for good but Draco keeps a hold of his arms, then drags Harry on top as if to bait him into fighting, which was a good instinct, because Harry is well pissed off by now and wrestles Draco against the couch until he has his wrists pinned on either side.
“And what? You’re starting to doubt that decision?” Harry asked, and his voice betrayed him by trembling ever so slightly.
“Lastly, while much about this year will contrast to previous years at Hogwarts, perhaps the most notable addition are the Eighth Years, who comprise of students that either missed their final year at Hogwarts due to special circumstances, or did not receive a suitable education last year as to prepare them fully for particular careers after Hogwarts. I will be speaking with the Eighth Years after the feast separately for further details about my expectations of them.
“I grew up here, during the school year.” Harry looks at his knuckles, at the fading white scar on his left hand, spelling
“I gathered that,” Harry says in annoyance. He hangs back a few paces, and Dumbledore turns with a raised brow.
“Draco,” he says, so softly he doesn’t think the other boy hears it, but suddenly Draco whips around. “Draco, please.”
“Maybe later, though,” Harry adds, awkwardly, but still smiling, almost bashful. Draco grins, his love for this boy like a second heartbeat beside his own, yearning for his soul, yearning for a unity of more than their bodies, if possible, wanting to live in the same skin, in the same bones.
Somehow younger Harry looks the most different and yet the most similar to his older self. Hermione scans his indifferent, almost bored expression. Her younger self reprimands Ron for not tying his tie correctly, and a flash of irritation passes over Harry’s face, before smoothing to his careful aloofness. It hurts Hermione to see it more than she’d like to admit.
Harry rubbed his face in guilt. “Does she think I’m cross with her?” She was the one to blurt it out the last time. Harry rushed out of the room so quickly she probably thought he didn’t want to be around her ever again, which wasn’t far from the truth in all honesty; he didn’t really want to be around anyone anymore.
"You're probably right but I'm just so glad to see you sitting up. Oh, I almost forgot." Remus pulled out a piece of parchment from his robes. "Severus stopped by while you were sleeping. He made me swear that this would get to you. He had to leave quickly." He handed the parchment over. "I checked it for tampering – it seems clean."
Draco became more visibly agitated at the nickname. Harry gave a timid smile in thanks. “See you around, Zabini.”
When the morning arrived, Healer Markus and Bill were the first to greet him. “I’m assuming you’ve developed a plan, then?” Draco asked when the two walked in. It was weird not having a guardian in the room while all of this happened. Turning into an adult in the midst of a war made Draco feel like he shouldn’t have even gotten this far. He longed for another set of ears to pay attention to the next steps and felt so vulnerable being here alone, even if he knew Remus would come visit when he could. In the meantime, he’d have to play Gryffindor and bear it alone.
James frowned. “Didn’t Sirius tell you? The Garden healed his Confundus. Apparently it was a plan we all agreed to. I wasn’t thrilled about it, though, I’ll have you know.”
Draco sighed. “I look at him and I think that could have been me. Nobody speaks to him like a human being. I even snapped just then because he had the audacity to laugh in his own Common Room. I’m going insane.”
Harry only managed to keep his eyes open in the class because of the anticipation of the adventure that was afterwards. Not wanting to draw attention to himself, he was forced to keep the signs of his anticipation below his desk, resulting in extremely jittery legs.
"Draco!" His father stretched his arms towards him threa- lovingly. Threateningly? Lovingly? What, exactly, was the difference?
"Professor Snape, sir, shouldn't Slytherin get house points from Harry knowing the answers?" He asked.
Harry thought for a moment. This must be a trick question; they were the same thing. "Nothing, sir. They're just two different names of the same thing, which can also be called aconite, sir."
His father snatched the packaging away from him, “Dear Draco,” He read aloud, “I’m so happy that you and Ron could mend the rivalry between our two families! I’m sorry this isn’t much, but I promise that there will be further gifts. Love, Mrs. Weasley.”
"Harry said that it was vault 713. The same vault mentioned in the paper. What was in the vault?" Harry glared at Draco.
Draco, pinning Zabini across the green-lit table, pummeling him over and over. Harry running to help, whether it was Draco or Zabini, he couldn't remember. God- had he helped Draco?
Harry grinned, turning the note so that Draco could see it. Draco looked up from his mail, a neatly written letter being set aside as he peered at the note presented to him, “Hagrid?”
“No, no… I know who he is, I just…” Draco sighed as Harry frowned in confusion, “Father always told me that he was no good. Dangerous and stupid.” He braced himself for his friend’s uproar, only to be pleasantly surprised.
Malfoy paused, biting his lip as if he was considering something. He glanced at the Slytherins before turning back to respond, "It's just a little fun, Potter," He spat, "Didn't know you were such a killjoy." His face contradicted his words, a look of sympathy flashed in his eyes.
"I can't wait to learn more about it, I- oh, Hermione!" Draco whipped around to find the muggleborn that Harry was referencing, "Did you get the book?"
Filch pouted and walked away. Mrs Norris followed him after a prompt hiss at the boys. Harry went up to thank the professor, frowning as he ran away.
Harry's eyes quickly darted away as Ron turned to meet his gaze. He spotted Draco several paces in front of him and jogged to catch up. Harry slowed as he reached him, stepping inside the dank dungeon classroom. He shuffled quietly to the seat next to Draco, not wanting to attract any attention to himself.
After potions, Draco, Harry, and Ron were talking- mostly Harry- when a large green object came into view. It was a Christmas tree, a rather large one being carried by a large man- the half-giant.
"'Ello there, Harry!" Hagrid grinned as Harry ran into his arms. Harry didn't see his eyes narrow slightly at the Malfoy boy.
This is kind of a fluffy filler chapter, but it does have a plot. Harry wasn't originally going to have a scar episode, but I'm sick as fuck and my head started pounding as I wrote that part. BUT! On the bright side we get Draco trying to keep Harry in the hospital wing next chapter.
Ron and Harry ended up heading the same way to the Charms classroom, and Ron took the opportunity to slide in some of his own snarky encounters that he had had with others in the past.
The boys beamed, running off back to their dormitories after being ordered to by Professor McGonagall. Harry found himself surrounded by Draco and Pansy when he returned, both glaring at him.
He glanced back towards the train, refusing to look at his father's face. Harry meekly shambled out, tripping on the last step down. Draco was going to help him. He should've helped him. He didn't. Harry quickly stood up and brushed his knees off, wiping the sweat off his hands before thrusting his hand towards Draco's father.
Draco pulled his hand out of Harry's and grabbed his wand. He tapped the doorknob and muttered something before opening it and pulling Harry into the room with him. They panted, anxiety pulsing through their veins. To their relief, Peeves had decided that he had been too helpful tonight and refused to tell Filch where they went.
He shifted in the sheets before sitting up, his eyes meeting Draco's, now a silvery blue. Nothing moved for a few minutes, the boys just sitting and staring in silence.
Ron. The lanky ginger stared at him before walking right past him. Harry gulped before continuing. At least Ron wasn't glaring at him anymore. A few moments of quiet deliberation later, he found that he was outside. He hadn't meant to, of course, but it was lovely out, and Potions wasn't for another hour. His gaze traced the rim of the central fountain, marveling at the smooth stone. His cycle was interrupted when a cloak blocked the rock below. He led his gaze upwards towards the mane of frizzy brown hair, the face covered with a thick book. He stepped toward the student, a Gryffindor, judging by her robes.
"N-no, I'm s-s-sure it was a-an accident. I h-heard th-them talking ab-about doing p-p-p-potions homework."
"Oh, no, please call me Harry." He smiled, watching as her eyes flickered over his green robes. He braced himself for the typical 'Slytherins are evil!' remark.
"I'm Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," The boy answered, his eyes seeming to twinkle with hope at Harry's acknowledgment.
Draco's eyes seemed to bulge for a moment before he answered, ”I dunno, it's just a common insult, I guess.”
"Hey, I'm sorry for being a bit of a prick earlier. You're uh... pretty cool." Ron squirmed as he maneuvered his way through the social obstacle course.
The broom threw itself into Ron's hold, and Harry grinned. He stood there waiting for the others to succeed and took the chance to examine his broom. It was primarily a dark brown, with speckles and flares of lighter colors adorning the length of it.
The first years rested at the foot of the stairs and waited for Professor McGonagall to cry out their names.
I did what I could to salvage it. This was originally written when I thought good writing was using weird verbs.
Harry shifted under his covers, his thoughts prickling on his back. Why was Malfoy so rude today? Did something happen? Was it the letter? No, he was cold before that.
"Yes, you did. But I don't want my hair to be gelled; I want it to be... not a mass of unruly spikes sitting on the top of my head."
"You made it, Harry! You did it! You..." Draco gazed at Harry's troubled face with concern, "What's wrong, Harry?"
Harry smiled at the others murmuring as they stirred. Typically, this would be a terrible sound to him, but this time, he didn’t have to make breakfast enough for twenty, he would get to eat breakfast with people who told jokes that weren’t about his dead parents. He stood, knowing how the alarm was. It would only turn off once everybody was off of their bed, and while the other boys mostly despised this, Harry generally marveled at it.
The attendance flew past in a blur. As usual, when Harry's name was called, people stared, even the teacher, who had added a snarky remark. As the teacher, Professor Snape, as Harry had learned, began his introductory lecture, Harry furiously scribbled down notes. He would be diligent and studious. A few ink splotches fell on his parchment as Harry was still getting used to the sensation of writing with a quill. His attention was called to the front of the room as his name was called. He looked up, his green eyes watching the teacher as he continued.
. Now he was downstairs. Alone. Opening his presents while Harry was upstairs in his room opening presents. Draco wasn’t exactly alone, though. He just wished he was. Especially since he recognized this wrapping pattern as the same pattern on one of Harry’s presents. The present from the Weasley family.
"Oh- Draco, this is Hermione Granger. Hermione - Draco Malfoy," Harry attempted to introduce the two of them to each other.
Harry looked as though he were slapped. “I thought you wanted this!” he said. “I see you watching me over there every night!”
Harry’s eyes were shining with unshed tears. “It’s not your fault, Draco. I picked up the bottle. I was just so overwhelmed with grief and the expectations to end the war for everyone. I just wanted to be numb. I didn’t want to feel anything anymore.” Tears began to spill. “I still don’t want to feel anything but I’m getting help now.”
“Starved,” said Draco, sitting with the group. Harry looked like he wanted to run. “Sit down, then, Potter. Wouldn’t want to miss all of the Malfoy gossip would we?”
“It’s earthier magic. Ancestral. Muggleborns can certainly take part but they don’t have the traditional roots. Some felt left out with no family altar or tradition. A lot of the more ritualistic magic is only practiced within families now,” Draco explained. “Divination is probably the closest we get to learning the Old Ways here and I know how you feel about that.”
Dressed in the tightest black jeans Draco has ever seen on anyone and a Ramone’s t-shirt, Harry looked dangerously handsome and everyone seemed to be aware of it. He’d move through the crowd as men and women pushed themselves against him, eager to try and grab his attention. Harry would smile easily and dance with some of them, Draco assuming the alcohol was aiding in his ease. It was night and day from his demeanor during the day. He’d go up to the bar to order a drink and someone would get it for him, Harry smiling his thanks and heading back to the floor. Draco found himself unable to look away, enraptured by Harry’s sudden charisma.
“He’s just trying to protect you, Haz,” Remus had said on the third day of uncomfortable silence between the two. Sirius had gone out into the garden to spend time with James, tired of the malaise surrounding the manor.
Lucius looked down. “I just didn’t want the last place you saw me to be on the opposite side of the battlefield.”
put it together, albeit drunkenly at the club but had figured it out nonetheless. The green-eyed teen in question was poking his head into the door.
at myself,” he agonized. “I can’t look at myself ever again. I don’t want to see him staring back at me.”
Draco couldn’t keep the snark at bay any longer. “Is that a sleight in your eyes, then? Seeing as self-preservation is a Malfoy’s singular goal in life?”
“That makes sense. It’s a pretty rare occurrence for Ancient and Noble Houses like yours. I’m not surprised your lessons didn’t cover it. When someone only disowns in name it is mostly to save face. To truly disown a family member there needs to be more feeling. It needs to invoke the House magic that can remove you. This just puts you in bad standing with the family.”
James was beside himself listening to his heartbeat amplified and visualized on the scanner next to him. His presence was kept quiet, labeled as a John Doe upon entry, though he supposed that aroused more suspicion than anything. At any rate, the onlookers he was met with upon entering St. Mungo’s were sure to let the cat out of the bag. He’d need to find a press agent.
Remus laughed lightly in response. “You’re not going crazy. The wolf just wants to bring Harry into the pack. You’re probably more possessive over him as the moon nears, yes?” Draco’s silence was all the confirmation Remus needed. “It may calm down by marking him.”
“What?” Draco shook his head. Something wasn’t right. “We need to get you to the Hospital Wing, come on.”
Blaise sat next to him. Draco, while annoyed, was happy that it wasn’t Pansy or Theo. Crabbe and Goyle were avoiding eye contact with him towards the middle of the table. Draco felt sadness again: he wouldn’t be able to talk to them, would he? They probably were warned against it. Nobody sat across from him—so he was to be a pariah. No matter, he thought, he’d just keep his head down and look forward to a quiet semester. His resignation was short lived when Pansy sat across from him. “Who’s that boy at the Gryffindor table? Looks like a Black,” she said.
That did not help ease Harry’s anxiety in the slightest. Seamus caught a book that just about flew off of a shelf in the dorm. “Why did he take him? Is he okay? Can I see him?”
Draco sat back down slowly, suddenly feeling foolish. "Why did I just disclose that much information to Potter of all people?" He agonized. "Bloody fool can't keep his mouth shut."
“Why is everything so complicated now?” the blonde cried, having a bit of a meltdown. “I just want to go back to being a Third Year prat before everything hit the fan.”
Harry sat next to him and nodded. “Yeah. That’s how the horcrux left me. It bought me time to be healed apparently.”
He was really beginning to enjoy the kinship he’s taken up with the Weasleys, he didn’t need Ron reifying it for him. Besides, they needed to look out after Harry, which seemed to be spiraling out of control.
They stepped through to Black Manor where Harry was surprised at the similarities between the tapestry rooms. “This is Black Manor?”
Remus grabbed his face in realization that he forgot to inform Draco fully what had happened to him. “Right, right,” he said. “They did a full scan when you arrived, not realizing they couldn’t use too much magic yet and if they’re right you’re not going to transform anymore.”
Blaise wasn’t one to back off, though, and he sat closer to the blonde. “I know I really messed up. But weren’t we good together?” He placed his hand over Draco’s who pulled away as if stung.
She rolled her eyes in response. “I’m used to you acting like a complete moron over Potter. This is nothing new.”
He pulled away and procured a folded piece of parchment from his robes. “Your script,” the blonde said, handing it over.
"We're just worried about you, mate!" Ron yelled angrily. "If you would just stop blowing up at every turn..."
“I didn’t realize he was still hurting from everything,” she said, completely shattered. “I should have.”
King’s Cross felt different this year, Draco decided. For one, he and Blaise were grouped up with a bunch of Gryffindors including most of the Weasley clan without hiding it from the rest of the world—that certainly wasn’t the norm just a few short years ago. Second, Remus, Sirius,
Draco gave an uncharacteristic snort in response. “Yes, very heroic to the point of stupidity. Should have been sorted into Gryffindor.”
There were murmurs of agreement, but silence fell upon them once more. The rest of the ride was quiet, and only when the carriage stopped did they begin to come back to life after being lost in their own thoughts surrounding the events of just a few short months ago.
“Only thing to keep your mouth shut,” Draco quipped, but he had to admit that he also liked when he kissed Harry. It was quickly becoming one of his favorite things to do, much to the amusement of Remus, who had walked in on them more times to count. Draco hoped that they’d be able to continue their tentative relationship outside of the privacy of St. Mungo’s.
“There were a lot of weird conversations, very few of which I was a part of.” Draco frowned. Of course, a moment where he could be truly helpful and he had zero intel.
“Are you doing alright, though?” Draco asked carefully. “Trust me, I prefer you don’t damaging your liver beyond repair but being sober makes everything more real I bet.”
It was almost too much for Remus to bear. He bit back emotions of his own – he was the only adult figure left for Harry with a close connection to his parents; he had to keep it together for him. “Your eyes are signature Black. It makes sense; James also had Black blood, but he was so removed from Sirius’s line that they didn’t care about any Muggle taboo surrounding in-breeding. Your eyes are like your Uncle Regulus’s – in fact you look just like him when he was your age, apart from the glasses and hair.”
One of the Aurors stepped in. Harry couldn’t recall his name or he never much cared to ask. “We have notice me nots on all of you, including Mr. Malfoy. This venture will be a safe one.”
"It's alright," Draco interrupted, standing as well. "You're so high and mighty, Potter, acting as though the world revolves around you. You want to know what my worst day is? Getting bitten by a werewolf after being intercepted by your own father so he doesn't take on his own punishment from not getting some stupid mission accomplished for an egomaniac who has turned my home upside down for the better part of a year. My worst day is being kicked out of said house and disowned on paper so the Malfoy line doesn't have dirty blood. My worst day is watching someone powerful and respectable like my father turn on his own family to please some snake faced pile of dragon dung like he's some kind of puppet. Take a fucking look around: you are not the only one hurting from the war. We are all losing people – we are all making sacrifices. Stop acting as if the world is black and white and behaving like some sacrificial lamb who has no choice. No wonder your friends are so upset with you." Harry was in a stunned silence by Draco's outburst. His mouth was gaping like a fish and Draco vowed to savor a moment where Harry was actually silent for once.
Draco was then promptly introduced to everyone in the town. There was a shocking amount of adolescents who were adamant that Fenrir had saved their lives. Most of them had last names that were familiar to the Death Eater circles. Draco wondered how Fenrir was able to take them without falling out of alliance with Voldemort. The adults in the village were young and vibrant, causing Draco to wonder if werewolves aged. If he was being honest with himself, Draco found Professor Lupin to look quite young compared to Professor Snape – it seemed as though he hadn’t aged past his early twenties. The only time he showed any wear was during the full moon. It had just occurred to Draco that he hadn’t caught himself in the mirror since he was turned. Would he recognize himself? Would he look like the villagers? Were his eyes no longer the bright silver he had grown to love? At this thought, he had to sit down outside of a shop on the sidewalk, pull his knees against his chest, and try to stop panicking.
They would rebuild the school over the summer and McGonagall would be Headmistress. They glanced at Harry at the mention of needing a new defense professor, but Harry kindly reminded them that he would need to take his NEWTs, and then suddenly all eyes were on Remus and Sirius. Harry was immediately in favour, thinking they would be perfect for the job. Sirius grimaced but promised he would think about it. Remus laughed that he would need to get through the moon this weekend before making rash decisions. It seemed as though life was going to go on.
Blaise looked at him in disbelief. “You’ve been healing people like crazy—I’m surprised you’re not exhausted with how much you’ve been doing.”
Harry was finally free of the dark magic remnants and he felt so exhilaratingly liberated it astounded him. His magic was stronger and more controlled and he didn’t feel the dark shadow as strongly over him. He didn’t know how heavily dark magic could lay on someone; he wasn’t aware of how much it could alter one’s disposition. No wonder Snape was always such a bully, even if that didn’t excuse him.
Harry wrapped his free arm around Draco, happy for their moment alone and away from prying eyes. Draco’s admission was enough confirmation that he wanted to continue their tentative relationship outside of St. Mungo’s. Harry was thrilled. “You weren’t there long after me.”
Remus shook his head. “No. We’re not going down this road of self-loathing again, Draco. We’ve gotten past this years ago.”
“It’s not like you already aren’t. Draco, you healed me this morning after a rough full moon and apparently after also setting Remus’s leg for him. You need to take yourself into account. You told me off about my own wellbeing which, granted, is fair. But you’re acting very un-Slytherin with your sacrificial healing acts.”
“Your family betrayed you.” Draco didn’t argue with that. “Plus, the moon is coming in about a week and you’re always irritable and sensitive beforehand.”
Draco frowned a little at that memory. His feelings were still very complicated and he hadn’t even talked to Harry about any of it. Or Blaise after that, really. He felt very much at odds.
Draco tried to swallow down his answer to save his mother but found he could not. “Yes,” he gritted out. That was simply unfair. “Or at least he was this summer,” he amended. “He was weak; he could be anywhere now.”
“You do, though,” James had shown up in the midst of Harry’s crisis, it seemed. He walked up to his son and squeezed his shoulders gently. “You ended it—you saved the world, Haz. You brought peace—Mother Magik is happy.”
James snorted at that, happy that Harry hadn’t lost his humour. “He wouldn’t do that. He’s probably just panicking—believe it or not, he can be quite the drama queen when he wants to be.”
On one such occasion, Blaise decided to bring it up, no longer able to keep the curiosity inside of his brain. It had, after all, been too well of a transition back into normal life for it to remain rose colored.
Blaise looked stiff, Draco noticed as he entered the living room. The teen was sitting fully upright on an armchair, holding onto a mug of tea as though if he let go he would float away. Kingsley, Remus, and Sirius were in the room as well, though they were having a quiet conversation in the corner away from Blaise. “Heard you couldn’t go on without me so you stayed in a warzone—how romantic,” Draco joked. Blaise jumped, realizing someone new was in the room, then visibly relaxed when he saw the blonde.
“One way to find out,” Draco replied, gesturing toward the wardrobe. “Come on now, it’s already past midnight – we don’t have all night to play dress up.”
Harry laughed in surprise at that. “Pretty sure it was the Garden that did this, but I’ll gladly be necromancer if it means you can come inside for tea now.”
“Am I interrupting something, then?” a voice called from inside the room. The two jumped apart immediately and turned towards the voice.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, yes, constant vigilance and all that.” Harry huffed in annoyance. “It’s not like your hex work is something to owl home about, is it.”
“Yeah, well. He and Harry are pretty close and Harry took everything pretty hard. I’m worried that if I take him here he’ll never leave.”
“What are you doing here?” He looked around and his eyes landed on Draco. He looked back at Remus, hurt evident in his eyes. “You all said he was fine!”
Sirius held Harry again. “I don’t know, babe. Maybe it’s the filial connection or the fact that he was the one to hoist you up and run into the house. You don’t have to feel guilty for getting your Dad back because most of the dead remain that way, though.”
"You all are fussing for nothing," Draco grumbled, making his way to the door and swatting Potter's offered arm away. "I'm not going to drop dead, Potter, relax."
The two made their way down the hallway to Ron’s room. It was the same space he had as a Prefect, meaning Draco was right next door. He spared a glance at his room as he knocked on his door: his trunk was already there waiting for him.
Suddenly, at the sight of the dark-washed door, Draco didn’t feel ready to face it all. Remus had told Draco about Severus, but he hadn’t really processed it, not really. Nor had he processed the fact that half of the Weasley twins were gone. He felt like his head was dunked in ice water as some of those realities began to materialize for him, and he took a step back from the door.
Draco didn't realize the tears that were streaming down his face until he felt himself suddenly enveloped into a warm embrace. It was Potter. Draco didn’t realize he was making any sort of noise that would make Harry aware of his sadness, but soon realized a choked sobbing sound had been coming from him. He hadn't cried once since the summer began – he had only reacted in fear and mild annoyance. He hasn't seen his mother since Christmas – seeing her handwriting and feeling her love for him pushed Draco over the edge. He allowed Harry to hold him as he cried for everything he had lost and everything that was happening to the world. Harry rubbed his back comfortingly as he cried it all out until he was too tired to go on, succumbing to quiet hiccups and shaking slightly. "I have a headache now," he said, trying to break the awkwardness he felt from leaning on an enemy for comfort.
The headmaster’s expression changed from one of examination to one of concern. I guess he was expecting something different, Draco supposed. “Is the Dark Lord in your house, Draco?” he asked.
“It’s all I can do to not go mad, honestly.” Draco wrapped his arms around himself, feeling small. “I’m a different person than I was a few years ago—I like to feel helpful.”
Harry rolled his eyes. It was almost out of place without a lit cigarette between his fingers: Draco was glad he shook the habit, even if he was scratching his hands to bits. He wondered if he should tell Remus about the new habit. “Anyway, they said I seem to be doing better but they also said I tend to swing high and low and I’m in a high swing.”
Harry pulled his hand away. “I don’t need a Healer, Draco. I just finally had a meltdown over my situation like you said.” Harry drew his knees up to his chest, resting his head on his knees. “I’m so tired.”
“You aren’t skipping out again are you?” she asked. “You can’t keep doing that, Professor Snape is going to be cross.”
“That’s nice. ‘Draco, we’re so unstable a galaxy might explode between us. Happy Christmas,’” he said, trying to mimic Harry’s accent.
Harry sighed slowly in response. It was awhile before he decided to speak; it looked as if he was struggling not to react. He had a sad frown on his face. "It's just been different lately," he explained. "I don't like talking much anymore. Hermione wants me to own my feelings. Ron wants me to joke around again. I'm so angry with Dumbledore for giving me an incompetent Occlumency teacher who hated me. It was all my fault that anyone got hurt or worse." He sighed again. Draco felt badly for him, which was odd considering his feelings about the Golden Boy over the past few years. "I'm just tired of doing the Boy Who Lived thing and they come with the title. They remind me of my responsibility and my shortcomings. I can't help but see red when they try to interact with me."
Harry thought, stepping down and out of the shop as quickly as possible. Draco was talking to Blaise outside, looking pinched.
“Merlin, Harry! You know what I mean. You must know how I feel about Ron,” Hermione says, then continues casually, “I know I am no master of deception like you.”
Despite the certainty that no one can see her, standing up in the front of the classroom twists her stomach. Hermione pushes the discomfort away and refocuses on the memory at hand.
She doesn’t bother to tell anyone. In fact, she would prefer secrecy for the time being, though she might have to pay for it later. Luna waits at Mr.Lovegood's home, probably setting up Christmas decorations.
“Malfoy?” a voice asks, incredulous. Draco looks around, but the alleyway is empty. Then a figure emerges from the darkness shrouding the far corner. Harry Potter steps forward, eyeing Draco suspiciously but without anger, an unlit cigarette in his right hand. He’s wearing tight black jeans, and in the night they are the same color as his hair.
Harry has an almost dreamy look on his face. “After I fall, right before I wake up, I’m in another world, and for a moment in this other world, I’m truly happy.” Then he sighs. “But it’s just a dream, right?”
“I don’t live there anymore,” Draco says shortly and without explanation, knowing Harry will not stoop so low as to ask why and risk showing interest. He always did take care in how people saw him.
“It’s impossible.” They both know it’s true. The Ministry’s tight regulations would sniff out the potion before he even begins brewing, and they would burn his shop to the ground. He would lose everything for a second time, and Harry would watch it happen again.
“So,” Hermione begins, glancing at Ron hesitantly. She rarely does anything hesitantly, but Ron has noticed her hesitating a lot around him recently. “Harry said no?”
She expertly unclips her bra from behind, sighing as it comes off. She stands there with her breasts bare in the dim bedroom light, just in her plain nude underwear, closing her eyes briefly as if needing a moment in the dark to bear the weight of exhaustion.
“Yes, I suppose it is a lovely name,” Ginny says slowly, half in disbelief, the other half intrigued. Luna has always both perplexed her and given her pause. What would it be like to see the world through her eyes?
"Is this okay?" Harry's fingers found the button of his jeans. His breath fanned hot against Draco's collarbone. Draco tilted his head and kissed Harry.
Ginny sighs. Harry might be the storm currently surrounding her, but Luna is the rainbow she earns on the other side, and she’ll just have to accept that for now.
Then suddenly the same thought occurs to both Hermione and Ron simultaneously, and they both look to Harry, as if only now remembering his recent non-break up with Ginny.
“Because now I don’t have any excuses,” Harry says quietly, then he turns back, his face steeled into indifference. Draco stares at him, speechless, his mouth open. “You should go to sleep.”
“We do not judge your choices,” Hermione says, and Harry looks up, his eyes red and glossy. “There’s no such thing as good people and bad people. There are the choices you make and the people you love. And we will always love you.”
She bites her lip. “I think...he said a lot, when we were with him. Mostly drunken nonsense. But sometimes...he would say Draco’s name. And he would say that he could see him in—in another world. The one he always...”
Hermione remembers feeling shocked, as they had been dating nearly ten years, and she looked it too, her mouth falling open before recovering with her brows furrowed. “No? You don’t want to settle down? Have a family? I mean, if you’ve changed your mind I understand, but I just thought...you always talked in school about…”
“But we can’t ignore it anymore,” Harry says harshly. Then with more urgency, “War is coming, Draco, I can feel it. I can feel him waiting for it. I know you can feel it too. Seeing Katie Bell...it brought me back to reality. We can’t live in our fantasy anymore. At some point we will have to pick a side. Both of us.”
A voice calls his name and a hand grabs his arm. Harry bolts upright in a cold sweat, and he realizes what he has to do. He gets up with shaky hands and starts packing immediately, blindly shoving clothes in a duffel bag. At the last moment before leaving his room, he snatches the vial off his nightstand and slips it into the pocket of his cloak.
Sometimes Harry wonders if he has grown the opposite way, from a more pure, innocent child filled with hopes and dreams and friendship, only to face so much death and darkness and evil that he starts to reflect it, to harbor it deep within, to even become it.
“Sure, Harry, and while you’re at it why don’t you wear a Slytherin tie and hold my hand too!” Draco sighs exasperatedly. “Honestly.”
“No,” Slughorn says reluctantly, “not all of them. A few have been able to live without such...side effects, but they are never quite the same afterwards.”
“Did not a single Professor accept you?” Miss Weasley asks, mocking. “I am so sorry, Ron, that is quite pitiful.”
Harry nods once, then settles back on the couch, reopening his Map. With the dangling mystery right in front of her, Hermione knows she will not be able to focus on her reading assignment—at least, not beside Harry.
Maybe he could try to pinpoint it, the very catalyst of it all. A sunny morning during the golden days of Autumn, a fresh new school year after the terrible war.
“I can’t tell you. You have to trust me, Harry.” Draco walks towards Harry slowly, stretching out his hand. “Just give me the box.”
“Oh!” Pansy exclaims, and Harry’s hand freezes with the bottle halfway to his mouth. “I forgot to tell you. If you try to separate or sever the tie, your bottle magically refills.”
How can they still be out? Hermione pushes away the mental image of Ron kissing Lavender, the concept simply too horrid. As it happens, the more she tries not to picture it, the more her mind replays seeing them the other day, curled up together in that alcove, kissing and cooing at each other like a pair of lovebirds.
Harry stares at her, and says nothing. He doesn’t have to; she knows exactly what he was doing. She prays that he will come clean.
Or doing something very different, which Draco does not want to think about. Draco slips his wand away.
Ginny shoves her gear into the locker room, wiping an annoying strand of hair that sticks to her forehead. As always, Quidditch remains a sacred escape from the drama in her life. Frustrations melt away in the wind, all her cares whipping behind her as she plummets through the air.
Harry’s fists clench at his sides, and his gaze flickers back and forth as he stares off into nothingness, like he’s trying to make a tough decision. After a moment, he stands up straighter, his previously tense face easing into a smirk.
She turns. Draco closes the door behind him, looking at her puzzled. The buttons on his shirt are off by one, though Pansy doesn’t point that out.
“If you had to name all the girls you are attracted to, who would they be?” Blaise asks in his deep, smooth voice that reminds Pansy of a rich red velvet cupcake she once had that actually made her moan out loud.
“Well, you may have noticed that Ronald...that I...with Lavender…” Hermione stutters to a stop. She has never really said the words out loud yet, although she has said almost as much to Harry before. Somehow simply being honest hurts more than telling half-truths.
But he doesn’t have a choice. Or at least, as he looks down at his Dark Mark that is almost visible beneath his thin cotton pajamas, he made the choice a long time ago.
“But we’re not sixteen anymore. You are too old to sneak around scared of gossip while all your friends start to settle down. If Harry keeps you a secret this time around, Draco, that’s not love. I am not trying to hurt you, darling, but I have an objectivity that you do not. He’s ashamed of you, to
The spell cracks like electricity in the air without Harry saying a word, and really he never thought of a spell, and it flies like a lightning bolt across the bathroom, hitting a nearby sink and exploding, causing water to gush out of a broken pipe onto the floor.
“Draco,” Harry says desperately, moving forward with arms stretched out, supplicating, but Draco scrambles away. “Draco, please, you have to choose. It’s him or me. It’s that simple.”
“Sometimes people make the wrong choices,” Ginny says tightly. “And we give them a second chance. You would know, right?”
The apartment suddenly sounds empty, hollow, even though she knows Draco is upstairs. She feels terribly alone, and wishes that she could be asleep, but knows that is futile. Still, she returns to her bed, wanting the comfort of her soft sheets, of her bedroom, which she has called home for these past few months. Tears well in her eyes, and she shudders, closing in on herself, willing the tears away. Where can she go from here?
Ron scratches at his sweater, the large letter R a bright red against the woven green. He loves his mother dearly, but her knitting could be more...comfortable.
“I think I may understand,” Miss Granger says. Weasley and Harry share a brief look of fondness over their friend. “Yes, I believe these core classes will encompass much more than the stated subject. For instance, there is a high chance Transfigurations will be related to healing the castle. And Firenze is a centaur.”
“Yes,” Draco whispers. He takes Harry’s hand, and it’s cool and smooth. A voice rings out in Harry’s head in response, a dark voice, a familiar voice, because it’s his own.
Hermione shoots Harry an angry look. Ron has finally caught on, and glances at Harry curiously, and perhaps more shrewdly than Harry gives him credit. He does not reproach Harry, instead looking at Draco, carefully gauging his reaction.
“I believe you have something of mine,” Harry says, still smiling that perfect charming smile. Hermione watches the scene in fascination, this upside down world of two former schoolboy rivals interacting years later, and it's like every color has switched and the ground has become the sky.
“I swear I just saw them a minute ago…” Hermione searches the common room but cannot spot them, and Malfoy is usually quite easy to find. She begins to worry. “Do you think they’ve gone off to duel?”
for Merlin’s sake. Not to mention he was openly bisexual. All at once air rushed back into his lungs. His hands were clenched on Harry's arms.
“Well, with me you can have both.” Pansy sashays across the room to the section of clothes displaying her latest arrivals. Pansy expertly sifts through the racks, draping any she likes over her shoulder. Hermione watches attentively a few feet away.
“You need to leave, Harry.” The hand holding his wand trembles. He frantically tries to think of spells that would injure but not kill, praying he won’t have to use them.
“That’s because no one knows me,” Harry interrupts angrily. “They think they love me but they don’t know the evil in me. The horrible things I have done. They just see a Savior, when I died to find a better world. I didn’t want to save them, just myself. I’m selfish.”
“Harry won’t be happy about that,” Ginny says, trying to calm her racing pulse. She feels like she just executed a dangerous dive to shake off a pair of Chasers. Her mind keeps pushing away memories of dark hallways, soft voices, and the utter shock of secrecy when there was already such delicate trust.
At the end of the feast, the Prefects lead each house to their dormitories. Many of the Gryffindors exchange grim looks as their Prefect leads them in the direction of the castle grounds instead of with the Ravenclaws to the towers.
Hermione almost mentions this to Ron, which would unravel the entire encounter with Pansy, and her thoughts, her questions. But in the face of her beaming husband, they pale and shrink, like cobwebs that had once held a nasty spider turn to dust in the shadows.
He doesn’t think at all. A hex slices across his cheek but the sting fades as the incantation rises to the tip of his tongue.
Hermione sighs, and Ron rolls his eyes. Ginny just looks up from the magazine she’s flipping through and after a moment of searching Harry’s face, goes back to reading.
“You don’t want to be an auror?” Draco looks surprised. “I imagine it’d be much less boring than working these charity balls. They are simply tedious.”
“You asked why I’m here,” Harry says slowly, still watching the ash float away in the air, falling like snow on the ground. He looks up at Draco, and Draco is startled at the heat in his eyes, the deep green of an emerald stone lost for centuries under the sea, the color that haunts his dreams at night. “But I think you already know. It’s the same reason you’re here, after all.”
He glances at Hermione, who is curled up in an armchair with a book, as per usual. They haven’t been talking much since he started dating Lavender. But since Christmas Break, a sort of truce has sprung between them. Harry spreads himself out on the carpeted floor before the roaring fire, eyes closed, his Potion’s textbook resting on his stomach, underneath his hand.
Mrs Weasley has become so anxious that she does not say a word, only retrieving the letter and offering a small treat to the owl, who takes it gracefully but remains on the windowsill, looming over them.
“I've always played the devious heart breaker, I suppose,” Harry says, and it’s hard to tell if he’s joking or not.
“I don’t understand how you can trust him.” Harry leans back, some of that intensity dimming and hardening into a fury before he shakes his head. Ron watches him, almost fascinated, realizing once again how little he knows his best friend. “I don’t understand how you can forgive him for what he’s done.”
“It’s dangerous, and I have plenty of enemies as it is.” Harry pauses, and turns away, as if about to leave. “But if you don’t want to, that’s a different story. Just say the word, and I’ll never speak of it again.”
“Well, it’s not easy visiting every country in the world before Christmas break,” Ginny jokes, taking a seat in the chair beside Hermione, who takes Rose from Ron gently and with her hands and a murmur creates a soft, glowing ball of light that floats from her palm. Rose calms down immediately, staring in awe at the ball of light.
“You know what,” Draco says, his eyes revealing a worry which he hides by lightly shoving Harry’s shoulder. But Harry catches his wrist with his Seeker reflexes before it can slide away. Draco’s pulse thrums under his fingers.
For a moment they break apart, and Draco’s eyes are lidded and dark. “Your glasses.” He reaches up and with trembling hands, removes Harry’s glasses, setting them carefully on the counter beside him. In the faint glow of Harry’s Lumos Draco’s face is a pale blur.
“I can’t lose him again,” Draco says, his voice breaking, but she can see in his eyes the fissures of doubt, the pain of love and shame intertwining like a web, an intricate trap, each strand alone a paper cut, but all at once a deep, deep scar. “I would rather have Harry in some way than not at all.”
“The Malfoy Manor.” A ghost of a smile appears on Hermione’s face. “He wanted the rights to burn it down.”
Only after the voices upstairs lull to a fitful quiet does she return downstairs. She walks back to the living room and finishes the bottle of wine, lounging on the couch, soaking up the space where she found and lost herself in one blow. With trembling hands, she finds a cigarette in a drawer and shuts herself on the balcony.
“What did you tell him?” Ginny asks, lightly shoving his chest, which doesn’t move an inch, a slab of steel under her hand. He’s quite handsome, Ginny is reminded, with a slim physique of lean muscle that varies between slightly tan and pale depending on the season. Even his outrageous hair, a messy mop of brown hair that’s never brushed, sweeps over his forehead, curling at the temples, unassuming in its subtle beauty.
Draco shakes his head gently. “I’m not trying to just flatter you, Hermione. I truly believe the country needs your leadership and genius.” He bows his head slightly when Hermione fails to respond, practically speechless, a small smile on his face. “If that will be all, I should get going. Pansy will start to cook if left alone too long, and she’s a special type of bad in the kitchen.”
Pansy and Draco laugh. Harry rolls his eyes, but he can’t hold back a smile. A flood of warmth washes away all the doubt and shame, and everything they don’t understand about each other and themselves, settling deep in his chest like the setting sun.
“I didn’t follow you, if that’s what you’re wondering.” Harry takes a step closer, never taking his eyes off Draco. “I’m waiting for Hermione and Ron to join me. Thought I’d...browse, as well. I was thinking of checking out a book on Magical Artifacts. Any recommendations?” Harry smiles at him, and despite it all, Draco can’t help but think it’s dazzling in its cunning.
“Maybe this is too personal a subject,” Hermione says hesitantly, “but I do consider us friends.” Draco smiles, surprised.
“Pansy!” Draco exclaims in a harsh whisper, looking around furtively. She squeezes his arm tighter, and he returns his attention to her.
“No, he’s just sad. You left him with an impossible choice, Harry, to choose someone who kept him a secret, or to choose a life without the person he loves most in the world.” Hermione sighs, taking Ron’s hand in hers. He squeezes it comfortingly. “You know, the world wants to heal more than it wants to hate. If you give people the chance to love you for who you are, they will take it, I promise you.”
“Now you might disagree,” Pansy says shyly, “but I’ve always fancied Granger. She’s so smart and pretty and you can tell beneath those robes she has a nice curvy figure. No wonder that Weasley boy follows after her like a lost puppy, drool and all.”
“Oh is it Valentine’s Day?” Draco asks, much to the alarm of Harry, before he smiles and takes the bouquet. “Did Hermione tell you to buy these?”
“Okay,” Hermione says, though it physically pains her to relinquish the knowledge. “It’s your choice.”
Suddenly Harry gets up, and quietly says goodnight, going off to the boy’s dormitory with the same closed off expression he had since the moment Ginny suggested going to Dumbledore.
Maybe she should tell Ron, though. After all, who knows Harry as well as Hermione and Ginny? She’s about to tell him that she thinks, no she
“Sleep well?” Harry asks, tightening his grip on Draco’s hand now that it won’t disturb him, pulling him closer and wrapping his arms around him. With a lazy smile Draco curls into him, so easily, so trusting, so warmly, that Harry could almost cry.
“So, uh, how is...are classes?” Ron asks Hermione, scratching the back of his neck. She wishes she could know if Ron felt the same way, but every time she gets close to asking, everything crumbles into painful awkwardness like she doesn’t know him at all. Could she simply be missing something glaringly obvious with everyone she thinks she knows so well?
“Was on the run a lot,” Harry said. Draco’s gaze flickered down, but not before Harry caught a flash of understanding in his eyes.
Draco rolls his eyes, but turns towards Harry nonetheless, their faces scarcely an inch apart on the same pillow. “This is dangerous, Harry.”
“Just to chat,” Harry says amiably. He points to the book Draco was flipping through before Harry rudely burst in on his browsing. “For class? Or just for fun?”
All questions disappeared the moment fingers brushed his neck, and a hand cupped his jaw. His heart drummed in his chest, his ears, his lips. When their soft breath ghosted his cheek, white static drowned out any sounds.
Draco’s halfway through his usual routine for closing up shop at the end of the day when the door rings, signalling a new customer, even though he had locked the door and closed the blinds already. He pulls his wand out, his heart already beating wildly in his chest, and braces himself for an attack.
“Perhaps they are to do with the special circumstances,” Mr Weasley suggests, eyeing her significantly.
“You don’t understand,” Draco says bitterly. “You don’t understand what it’s like to love someone like this and have them ask you to keep it secret. Would you give it all up? Just to be able to hold hands in public?”
“Easy?” Draco asks in disbelief. “Easy? You’re not the only person who had to deal with shit in life. You’re not the only person who has suffered. And you have people that love you and you toss them aside like they mean nothing to you. Have you ever thought about how much you made
The Eighth Years remain at their tables, and with the rest of the student body gone, even the other professors, they look a pitiful group, scattered amongst the different house tables, hardly forty in number. Harry’s chest pangs when he notices the gaps, and the friends of those who died in battle, left alone among the living. Miss Parvati Patil, for instance, sits alone and quiet, where only a year ago she would have been giggling and gossiping with the late Miss Brown, who was one among the Fifty Fallen.
“Harry?” Hermione asks tentatively. He looks up at her, expectant. “We’re here if you ever need to talk.” Her voice sounds incredibly gentle compared to how she spoke to Ron just moments ago. A sudden flare of jealousy heats up Ron’s cheeks, which he resolutely ignores.
“You two and complicated,” Hermione says wryly. “You know, I never understood why you two broke up, in Sixth Year. It didn’t make sense. I thought maybe you didn’t want to tell me, being Harry’s friend and all.”
“Hogwarts has stood, and still stands, as one people, not divided by their Houses, but united in their differences. It is by coming together despite differences, in fact,
Just then, Harry raises his hand. Hermione pauses, along with younger Hermione, who frowns and stops taking notes.
A creak of a door and soft footsteps shake Harry’s attention away, and the shimmering label fades to air. He looks at the front desk, and his breath catches ever so slightly at the blond hair and dark robes.
Harry nearly sighs in relief. Miss Granger looks at him sharply, as if to say this will be the consequence of not getting a new wand. He ignores her look, and instead bows his head to Miss Lovegood.
“Friends? Don’t be ridiculous,” Pansy says, trying to appear as flippant as possible. “After all, they hated each other.”
Angrily, feeling betrayed but at this point just more exhausted, Draco continues walking down the corridor swiftly, stopping in front of the wall and closing his eyes. He takes a deep breath in. If Harry wants to play this game, then so be it, Draco will play—though he won’t play fair, that’s for sure. A Malfoy never stops being a Malfoy, even while fraternizing with the enemy.
After pondering a minute more, Harry reasons that French will at least be taught by someone with whom he is closely acquainted. Wandlore could be useful, given his present circumstances, and Mr Ollivander has always been kind to him, though quite odd. And finally, Healing looks to be the only class where he can hope the coursework will be at the very least manageable.
“Shh.” He kisses Draco, pressing himself close against the heat of his body, that warmth like a memory, like a piece of the sun and everything good in his life, breathing right in his arms.
Ginny lets the curtain fall, and with a sinking feeling in her stomach, hurries out of the boy’s dormitories. Before she falls asleep, Ginny prays. Not to any god or goddess, but to Harry, wherever he is on this cold night.
Harry himself wears a waistcoat, vest, and a collar which is buttoned to the top of his neck. All of them wear dark brown traveling robes, besides Mr and Mrs Weasley who wear colorful daytime robes.
“The night I died, I saw a place, perhaps all in my head though no less real for it, a place all white and pure, where you can choose to go on, or stay. I chose to stay, but I did glimpse the beyond before I left, and I saw them all. My parents, Fred, Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and so many more, they were all together, all smiling, all happy. I took comfort knowing somewhere, in an other world, our fallen family and friends are happy and in peace. I hope it gives you comfort today, too, and every year hence, as we never truly forget, and never truly heal without them.”
Lucy hurries away, jumping off the counter top and disappearing into a pantry. She comes back with a handful of different glass jars filled with crushed herbs, and one container filled with a sticky fluid that Harry guesses is Flobberworm Mucus. He would feel more disgusted if he didn’t need the Sleeping Draught so desperately, and more to the point, if he hadn’t been taking it regularly for so many years.
But Ginny has something to do first before she can join her. She takes a cab to the familiar apartment complex, not wishing to Apparate after such a long trip.
“You didn’t stop me,” Draco says in a weak, drained voice when she’s gone. He lowers his wand, and slumps back against the wall, his eyes shut.
Harry crosses his arms, frowning. “I’m fine.” A hint of a smile returns to Dumbledore’s face. “I just want to know what the memory is about.”
Harry stared at Draco, then turned to look at Pansy, who made her way over to them, setting the bottle down on the coffee table. He slowly nodded his head, as if in a trance.
Harry stays silent until Cormac struts away, still smiling that smile he probably thinks is charming but just looks sleazy to everyone else. Other students approach Harry, of course, mostly just to bask in the golden attention of his fame, some to ask if he’s single, a phenomenon that still manages to puzzle him. These people do not know him in the slightest, they do not have a clue about the darkness he lives with every day, the demons he battles each night, and yet they dare to ask him to lunch?
“I told him you don’t want to.” Harry watches Ginny’s reaction, but Ginny only smiles, though it doesn’t reach her eyes.
“I need to go,” Draco says tersely, and he wills himself to move past Harry. A hand grips his arm, forcing him to stay put. He struggles against the grip, and with surprising strength Harry pulls Draco closer to him, their faces mere inches apart.
“As if anyone wants me here anyway,” Malfoy said, but dropped the cigarette and crushed it with the heel of his boot.
Draco stops resisting, looking at Harry so that his heart leaps in his throat. To have Draco’s body underneath him like this, the wrists with their twin pulses in his hands, holds a spell over him so that he cannot move.
They slowed down when the sun dipped its bottom edge below the horizon, and they hovered up in the clouds, where white mist engulfs everything except the tips of the castle towers.
The taste of Draco’s mouth against his is just a faint memory in the heavy darkness of the corridor. He can hardly remember what compelled him to sneak into the Slytherin dormitories that night, to find Draco’s bed, to lay beside him and say
Draco goes still, that familiar chill creeping up his skin. He ignores it, pulling Harry closer and kissing him. When he pulls away, Draco says with surprising honesty, “When I’m not with you, it’s like I’m already dead.”
Harry’s heart leaps into his throat. He places his hand hesitantly on the curve of Hermione’s stomach. They both hold their breaths.
“This is the one. If you’d like to purchase it, I’ll ring you up myself at the register—with a war hero discount, of course.” Pansy winks, and Hermione laughs.
Harry moaned aloud, grabbing her waist, but she took his wrists and kept them pinned by his sides, choosing the rhythm and rolling her hips slowly, until Harry choked out a plea, his fringe beaded with sweat, his head falling back. She released his hands and he wrapped his arms around her and entangled his hands in her hair, and Draco watched as Harry pounded into her, grasping her breasts, his face falling on her neck.
Harry cannot find the words to answer, and so he does not speak. He searches Draco’s face, trying to understand where such a question would come from, what he expected from Harry. Hadn’t they agreed this could be the only way?
“You could have anyone,” Draco says, almost an exhale, lowering his face against the crook of Harry’s neck as if to hide his face, right alongside the hem of his robes. Harry can feel his breath soft and hot against his skin. He can’t remember why he ever thought the room was cold. “So why me?”
Interestingly, his complete lack of proper manners perhaps did help when it came to You-Know-Who. The Dark Lord disdained Muggles and anything relating to them, so he was caught off guard several times when Harry blatantly ignored all decorum. But by the time Harry really needed to defeat him, he had grown more-or-less accustomed to the rigid, old-fashioned culture of witches and wizards.
As his breaths became pants and the black behind his eyelids exploded in color, Draco decided he had known for all his life.
Pansy had moved away from him, stretching out on the couch, exhausted but satisfied, like a cat after drinking milk and purring, barely able to move, but contented. Harry looked at Draco, and Draco only smiled.
“Draco,” Harry says as a greeting, “right this way.” He steps back to let Draco through into the foyer, which really is the living room, with a nondescript white couch in front of a sleek TV against the wall.
am in charge. While I had a hand in procuring those very invitations, I was sworn to secrecy,” Mr Weasley says, smiling.
“Simply to keep an eye on him, in case others might target him. He should not pay the price of his parents’ mistakes.”
“Thank heavens not!” Harry exclaims. “I appreciate your zeal, but please refrain from demanding it from the rest of us.”
Hermione taps his arm anxiously, looking behind at a trailing, somewhat confused Cormac McLaggen. “God, he’s awful.”
He looks away, frowning. Then he looks at Hermione, his eyes the most sharp and alert she’s seen them in weeks.
Harry spins around, sitting back on a bench and pulling Ginny on top of his lap, wrapping his strong arms around her slim waist and kissing her. She snakes her arms around his neck, pushing their bodies close, tilting her head into a rough kiss.
Could Harry have been harboring a secret this big from both Ron and Hermione without them noticing in the slightest? Perhaps with their current feud and Lavender always stealing him away, neither of them had the means to see it.
“Draco!” Pansy interrupts. “I could see it in her eyes. She knows something more is going on. Merlin, Draco, I
“Well if you say it like that.” Malfoy brings his mouth on Harry’s neck, trailing down to his collarbone, as his free hand quickly unbuckles Harry’s belt. Harry throws his head back, breathing hard, closing his eyes as Malfoy lowers to his knees.
Finally Harry nods. “Sometimes I forget.” He smiles ruefully, and it’s the first smile Ron has seen on him in what feels like months. “Sometimes I forget that I have friends.”
Harry kisses him. He can sense Pansy watching, with lidded eyes, from the other end of the couch, shifting in her seat as the energy in the room tilts in another direction. His skin burns at the very thought of her eyes on them, and he snakes a hand down Draco’s side, slipping it under his shirt, caressing his soft skin. He wants to move quicker, but Draco slows him down, finding a rhythm with their tongues, a dizzying, teasing pace.
“I know.” Ginny sighs. “I do love you, though. And I care about you. I wish you would tell me what’s going on in that head of yours sometimes.” She ruffles his hair, and he frowns, suddenly troubled.
Why does he feel angry? Harry turns around, breathing hard, trying to calm down the rage bubbling in his chest, the build up to an explosion. This is not a choice. He should not have to choose between the two people he loves most in this world.
Harry takes in a shaky breath, pulling back. His eyes are rimmed red, and he looks so beautiful and so broken Ginny’s heart pangs.
She crosses the street, throwing one look behind her shoulder, before slipping into an alleyway. With her wand, she taps on the red brick wall, the pattern of a triangle over a square; seven pointed star for good luck. The brick wall shimmers, and Ginny walks through it.
Harry stays silent for a long time, looking back and forth between Hermione and Ron, his shoulders tense. “So you know.” It’s not a question; he can see it on their faces. “When?”
“I only have Defense Against the Dark Arts on Monday,” Weasely says, smiling at Harry. “How would you like to study
“Still, the Room of Requirement? Why not the Slytherin dormitories? Or an alcove? Or the Astronomy Tower?” Harry narrows his eyes, and almost mutters under his breath. “What could he be trying to find?”
“But Ronny…” Lavender whispers, though Hermione still hears it and huffs, turning away. While Ron can confidently say he’s upset with Hermione for constantly finding fault in him when he’s done nothing wrong, he still doesn’t understand the cause for her harsh criticism.
Harry’s head snaps up and he looks at Ginny like a deer in the headlights. Then he frowns and looks away. “Yes. Hermione and Ron are quite fond of him now.” He sounds for all the world as if he could care less. Ginny knows he does care, though, about this.
When Draco looked into Harry’s eyes in the darkness of the alcove that night, Snape’s footsteps like a ticking clock counting down in the background, they seemed like a pair of glittering emerald stones, no, like a slithering snake with shiny scales ready to pounce, and Draco realized then that he was always going to agree with Harry.
She was always surprised by how gentle, how soft, Harry was, when she first arrived and they got over their initial hatred, which was really just a knee-jerk reaction between Gryffindors and Slytherins. She had expected a rougher style, a clumsier, louder presence, that would befit a popular jock, which Harry essentially was during school. But instead, he spoke quietly, a little sarcastic sometimes, standing with his arms by his sides, not moving much, as if he were always waiting to be told off, and didn’t want to draw attention to himself.
It is late in the night when she lets go, when the stars shine their brightest, cold flakes of snow, glittering, guiding her, calling to her,
“Well, yes. But that’s a very dangerous potion, Harry. Wherever did you here about it?” Slughorn asks, flabbergasted. Even Hermione and Ron are looking at Harry with similar perplexed expressions. Hermione remembers her shock that Harry had heard of a potion that she hadn’t.
Draco throws his hands up. “Honestly, this is ridiculous. Of course it's illegal. Who would want to live like that?”
“From your perspective, perhaps.” Harry pauses, half smirking. “The sun sets later from the top of a tower than the depths of a dungeon.”
“Go ahead,” Draco says, spreading his arms out wide. “I have nothing to hide. Unless, of course, you’re scared of just that.”
Ginny stares at her for a moment longer, so stunned she feels no surprise at all, then returns to her textbook. Because she’s right. Ginny is not ready for something else, something new, especially not as new as Luna would be. Harry still lingers on her mind, and there’s that tingling feeling at the base of her neck that warns of an impending doom.
Ginny has always loved London. Even on a smoggy, chilly night like tonight, she delights in walking down crooked streets, beer drunken laughter wafting from bars down the road, a bright red omnibus careening past, headlights flashing on a group of rowdy teenagers, their skateboards scraping the asphalt.
She hugs Ginny, then Luna. They both look beautiful, long flowing hair, a glowing to the skin from being in hotter places during England’s muggy winter.
“Like I’ve said before, it’s too dangerous,” Draco says. “And besides, I like laying out under the stars. It’s very…”
Then Ginny arrives, hand in hand with Luna, matching silver rings on their hands. Molly and Arthur are delightfully shocked and the news brings an added merriment to the festivities. Hermione walks over to them to offer her congratulations.
Ron has little Rose in his arms, chatting amiably with someone in dark robes and gleaming white blonde hair. Draco turns and smiles at Hermione, before noticing Harry behind her and going pale.
She smiles tightly. “No.” A sigh. “I tried. It just isn’t what I need.” A vision of blue eyes and long, blonde hair flows past before Harry squeezes her hand.
“We all have a choice, Harry,” Ginny says slowly, sadly. She knows he’s thinking of someone else, someone who has to make that choice, the hardest choice, when both choices lead to heartbreak no matter which way you cut it.
“I’ve only ever wanted to do it with you,” Draco says, looking at him carefully. “Haven’t you thought about it before?”
Ginny stares at the floor, clenching her fist and then letting it release slowly. She turns around and looks at him; Harry’s hair is a splash of dark ink against the sea of white kitchen cabinets and counters, and he stares at Ginny with a mixture of longing and bitterness.
“Really if Tony Blair keeps quiet on Israel occupying Lebanon he won’t be reelected, that’s for sure.” The man next to Harry whose name he’s already forgotten keeps talking about current Muggle affairs which mean nothing to him.
“I suspect we must make a quick reply,” Mrs Weasley says. She breaks the seal with shaking hands. “‘Dear Mr and Mrs Weasley, as the rightful guardians of Mr Ron B. Weasley, as well as the temporary guardians of Mr Harry J. Potter and Miss Hermione J. Granger, I send this letter to provide some important information.’ From the Minister himself, just think! Oh, my poor nerves!”
“But have all of them gone mad, sir?” Harry asks, with that laser focus intent that has always slightly terrified Hermione.
Dumbledore doesn't look surprised. After a moment’s silence, he says seriously, “I loved someone, Harry, once. Very much. But he was on a different path than mine. I tried to love him and also love my family, but in the end I lost both.”
Harry turns and walks away. Before he reaches the stairs, he looks back at Draco, and in the darkness his eyes are the color of an emerald stone, the color of the Slytherin house. Then he disappears down the stairs, leaving Draco alone.
“And you’ll try to find someone? You promise?” Harry asks, tense. Ginny nods with a small smile, and Harry relaxes. “Then if this is the last time…”
He remembers saying that, but he also remembers the rejection. He remembers Harry lying about what he had said, and he remembers the pain of his insults like a sword straight to the heart.
Distantly, the sound of people counting down reached Draco's ears. Their time was almost up. His whole body was both numb and the most alive it has ever felt.
Miss Granger soon caught on to all the rules, being a quick study, while Harry stumbled awkwardly through conversation and made many blush at his words and actions. Professor Snape tortured him endlessly about etiquette, but to no avail. Harry would always blunder through propriety.
“Draco,” Harry says, smiling. “You’re here.” Draco almost mentions how he’s been here for the past ten minutes when he notices the wine glasses at the coffee table, and a nicely laid out cheese platter, and the words die in his throat. Harry’s wearing nice fitted pants and a dress shirt, and his usual unruly hair has been combed through. He even shaved his trademark stubble, and for a heartbeat it’s like looking at Harry as he was in Sixth Year, with the same charm and the same slight coldness but not yet broken, not yet the war hero he has become today.
Draco glances at Harry then, his face very serious, but his gaze subdued, almost thoughtful. Hermione doesn’t understand. She looks at Harry, but unsurprisingly he’s not much help, staring at the table in front of him, seemingly lost in thought. Ron and her younger self start playing footsie under the desk, bickering about something.
Draco pulls away, searching Harry’s eyes, but they are dark in the night, and Harry averts his gaze. “But that’s ridiculous. You’re
Ginny looks away to mask the anger in her face, but Harry sees it; it’s one of the things he loves about her, that fierce knowledge of what is right and wrong, no matter how difficult.
Harry stares at Draco, worrying his bottom lip. Then he nods, averting his eyes. “I wish things were different, that’s all. I just wanted to ask you. Just to…”
“Think about it, Hermione,” Harry says flatly. “That’s exactly why he would want to work with the Ministry—for sympathy. Then he’ll worm his way into weakening reforms and giving other Death Eaters the chance to rebel. Nothing will change, you’ll see. Not to mention his suspicious potions business.”
“Have you looked at your schedules yet?” Miss Granger asks, then sighs when she catches the alarmed faces of her companions. “Of course not. Both of you should look at your schedules immediately and mark your classes.”
“It’s called a Vanishing Cabinet.” Draco runs a finger along the edge. “Hides things. People. It was used in the War a lot when someone needed to escape. This one connects to the one you saw in Borgin and Burkes. I’ve been fixing it.”
“Draco, stop.” Harry sees Draco flinch when Harry says his first name, but he stops and turns around reluctantly, arms straight and tense by his sides.
“You asked to see me?” Harry walks inside the room hesitantly. Dumbledore is sitting in his chair behind his desk, fiddling with something small and which gleams in the flickering candlelight. It looks like a ring.
“But it’s still early,” Harry protest, struggling to sit up. “You don’t have to leave yet. You could sleep here for a bit more, I won’t mind.”
Draco worries. He worries but he must hide it, for Harry’s sake. He cannot let Harry worry about their relationship, in case he decides it is too complicated and leaves. He also worries about Pansy, but less so, because he knows she can protect herself. But he worries about their friendship, or whatever this is, and if it will last.
The first few days of classes were the most eventful that Harry had ever experienced. Given, he's only experienced those classes so far, but that's beside the point. Harry's clothes had been enchanted to match his house's colors, and he had concluded that green looked much more fitting on him than red ever could. Draco had agreed with him on that, continuing to say that the color accentuated his emerald eyes.
"Because your father works for the school board. Because you bite your inner lip when you're tying things together in your head." Harry shrugged nonchalantly.
Hermione seemed to think that the theory was preposterous, “No — he wouldn’t.“I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe."
The dormitory door creaked as it swung open, revealing the two boys. It was nearing lunchtime, and Harry was apologizing profusely for Draco having missed his morning mail.
Draco pursed his lips self-consciously, "Okay, so I may have heard something about a three-headed dog. I didn't know that it had anything to do with the school, though."
Harry spent the rest of the feast trying to enjoy as much of it as possible; he clapped when Ron was sorted into Gryffindor, even when it earned him weird stares, he chuckled when Professor Flitwick dropped his fork, and he chatted with his fellow Slytherins.
"Oh," Draco's heart stumbled for a moment, but he wasn't quite sure why, "Well the teacher's lounge isn't far from here. I'm sure you can go there and ask Snape for the book back."
- when his father had become a death eater, he wasn't sure. He wasn't sure of much these days. Blimey, he wasn't even sure if he wanted to be sure. Not knowing was frustrating, of course, but sometimes the truth is worse than ignorance.
Draco hit her with the back of his hand, "Oh, shut it. Anyone would, he's the most powerful wizard- and he's our age!"
He found himself staring at Draco's hands as they moved to set out his cloak, undershirt, and green tie. They looked to be about the same size, so if Draco thought his hands were huge, wouldn't that make his own big as well? He debated bringing this topic up, the thought coming to an abrupt stop as the alarm stopped ringing. Everyone else was awake, and Harry scrambled for his robes.
No, he didn't. He didn't know anything about Harry. He didn't know how he faltered in his steps every time the stairs moved, staring in wonder. He didn't know how his hands were always covered in ink because he didn't know how to hold a quill. He didn't know that his son had held those hands.
He shoved his covers off of him and sat on the edge of his bed, looking at the sleeping forms of his dormmates. He slipped a pair of slippers on that he had stolen from Dudley and stood. He crept to the door and pushed it open, walking through the common room before exiting the Slytherin Dorms completely.
The corridors were silent as Harry walked towards the staircase. Drip. Harry stopped, panicking for a moment before realizing that they were under the Great Lake. He resumed his pace, stepping silently up the stairs, his mind racing.
Draco shifted uncomfortably, ”Yeah, but I thought it would be-” he glanced at the muggle-born, ”alone.”
Harry let out a small chortle before quickly snapping his mouth shut as he saw Professor Binns turning.
Draco didn't reply, instead leaping up the stairs two steps at a time. Harry followed, nearly getting hit in the face with Draco's robe.
Draco frowned, the last sentence floating through his head without a single moment spent pondering upon it, “A withdrawal? When was this?”
Harry's classes flew by. In Potions, he managed to make people laugh. He reminisced upon the moment.
"Take a nap in there, did you, Potter?" Draco shifted himself off of the rough stone walls of the dungeon, walking firmly towards the stairs. Harry had to jog to catch up.
He glanced at Harry; the boy is still oblivious to the situation. He seemed enthralled by the tainted book, his eyes full of wonder as Draco found himself staring at them.
Harry's eyes flickered with confusion. Of course, it would be friendship, what else could it be? Before he could continue this internal consideration, Draco spoke again.
Halloween was coming much too soon. The once grey halls of Hogwarts soon danced with orange and black. He filed in the dungeon classroom, heart skipping a beat when he saw a distinct pattern at the tables. One from each house. Harry panicked; Hermione was already partnered with Draco, who had the face that meant he was pretending to be annoyed. The only other Gryffindor he really knew was- Ronald Weasley.
Harry was much more excited about his next class. Mixing stuff to make something new and magical piqued his interest quite a bit. He had scoured his textbooks in his dorm after Draco had told him about it, discovering a plethora of new and exciting information.
What about when his eyes, then hazel, clearly echoed sympathy while he was insulting him? Is someone making him act rude? If so, who?
Harry laughed at the dog, while Draco took a step back for a moment before entering the cabin as well.
Pansy eyed them suspiciously before returning to her meal. Draco nudged him, whispering into his ear, "Train."
Draco's arm tingled, and he noticed that the periodical brushes of Harry's arm against his had stopped, as Harry seemed to be lost in thought.
"So," Hagrid grunted as he took a seat at his table stacked with rock cakes and cups of tea, "'ow's yer week been goin', Harry?"
Draco scoffed, ”Of course I did, now face forward." He shoved Harry back around to face where they were going.
She called him Harry. She was such a soft, motherly figure, and she had called him Harry. Harry had forgotten that maternal figures were meant to be loving.
Draco quickly went to hide the packaging, which had the return address along with a note on it, “Oh, there wasn’t one. Must have been a pra-”
His hopes slowly deflated as class drudged on, proving that wizarding history was just as dull as muggle history. He found himself creating a new narrative, one much more magical and exciting. The visuals started to flood into his mind, a battle of dragons and trolls-
The boy looked surprised that Harry knew his name, and turned a bright red. Harry turned and followed after his friend, worried about how he was acting.
"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" taunted Pansy, "Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Patil."
Harry smiled, "Pretty okay, I don't think Professor Snapes likes me very much, though." He cringed as he attempted to bite into one of the little cakes.
Harry glanced to his left. Ron was glaring at him. He tried not to take it too personally, but it still hurt. Why couldn't he just be himself without calling attention? Half the world loved him for being Harry Potter, and the other half hated him, and, well...
"I have a massive library- AND it's less restrictive than the school one- we'll find him in no time," Draco assured him.
He sneered at the two boys, "Been naughty, have we? You know you aren't allowed in the third-floor corridor... Headmaster's orders."
. The page spoke of a mirror of… erised? Harry wasn’t sure how to pronounce the word. He wasn’t sure how to pronounce a lot of words, he learned most of them through reading, rather than conversation. According to the book, the mirror would show the viewer what they desired most. Harry wondered what he might have seen if he looked into the mirror. Would it be his parents? Alive and well? There was no way of knowing for sure.
"You wanna try that again?" Harry snapped, having heard the slur much too many times in the Slytherin common room, "Or should my friend's father hear about this?"
"The world isn't as nice and dandy as you think. If you show that you're vulnerable they'll exploit that."
“Do you have any idea what my father would do if he found out you had an invisibility cloak? He’s not really a good person.”
Dinner that night was uneventful, in Harry’s opinion. The dining table was large, and Draco had insisted on Harry sitting across from him. Harry agreed, still confused as to why the dining table looked large enough to seat about 30 people. Everybody was distant, both physically and emotionally. Hardly a word was uttered, and Harry appreciated it. At least the Dursleys weren’t berating him. Draco was right about the library- Harry saw books that went into detail into things that the books in the restricted section hardly even touched upon. Harry had brought up asking Mr. Malfoy, but Draco quickly knocked down that idea, insisting that he was busy and it was best not to bother him. So Draco and Harry resorted to searching the library themselves, Draco going through the title of each book and handing books that had a chance to mention Nicholas Flamel to Harry so that he could read it.
“I never thought you would encourage someone to date your sister,” Harry points out, predictably unhelpful.
Ginny sighs. Aren’t they always worried about Harry? She can’t exactly blame them either. Merlin knows how many nights she lied awake, her stomach a nervous knot, praying he made it through the night.
A loud clicking noise from afar makes them go still in each other’s arms. Harry pulls back, dizzy. Then he realizes what—who—is making that noise.
It takes a few seconds to orientate herself afterwards, but when she does, she knows with more certainty than ever that she must leave. She finds her robe in a haze, walking to the kitchen for a glass of water, then she goes to her room right as the tears begin to fall.
Ron sighs, and leans forward, glancing around the common room to make sure neither Hermione nor Ginny herself were anywhere they could hear him. “But you’re seeing each other, right? Why can’t you just date her?”
“I’m just going to see Hagrid, Lavender,” Ron says gently, attempting to unlatch her arms from around his neck. She pouts, blushes coyly, and snuggles her face in the crook of Ron’s neck, her lips soft and persistent against his skin, and the sugary sweet smell of her perfume drenches the air around him. “I’ll be back for dinner.”
Pansy shrieks loudly, half laughing and half indignant, “How dare you, Draco Malfoy! You sexist pig! You know he’d raise my grade
“Yes, it was, wasn’t it,” Hermione says softly, and Draco realizes a second too late where this conversation has stumbled into. He stands frozen, unable to move, not even to speak. “You know, I was almost sad to hear they ended. I suppose the war had an effect on Slytherins that most people could scarcely imagine. Sometimes, though, I wonder if Pansy saw him all these years later, if they would find their way to each other. It sounds like something out of a book, doesn’t it?”
“Yes, Harry,” he says in his familiar gravelly voice. He peers at Harry over his spectacles. “Are you quite alright?”
“Draco,” Harry said, pained and broken. He wanted to kiss Draco so badly. Draco’s eyelids fluttered, eyelashes brushing against his cheeks. Harry inched even closer.
Draco nods, his mind briefly remembering the unfinished Sad Nightingale in his kitchen, feeling relieved that at least one option was unavailable. “I guessed that much. His speech at Christmas was…”
