“Harry, I will not ask you how you know this information,” Dumbledore responded kindly, his face not giving away whether he already knew — though Harry had an inkling that he did. “But I assure you that Professor Snape is handling it.”
“Come on, I’d gladly join you know,” Romilda responded, her eyes seemingly swallowing Harry whole. Knowing that Romilda was only interested because of his fame, Harry didn’t even bother to respond. Instead, he walked away and directly to where Ron and Hermione were sitting.
Utterly unconvinced, Hermione muttered something about knowing Harry was up to something, if he couldn’t just
Draco’s body thrashed and squirmed until it was satisfied. He grabbed Harry’s head in his hands and pulled up his face.
“Look Potter,” Draco finally responded, his gaze firmly intact. “Harry.” He softened, his voice daring him to go on. “There are certain things even the Chosen One wouldn’t be able to handle.”
Draco turned around, looking terrified. Composing himself, he retorted, “Are you following me now, Potter? What could you possibly want to say that can’t be said in the open? Scared of my friends, are you?” He mocked.
He was tempted when Harry gave him the same piercing look he did when they made love from across the room in the Three Broomsticks. However, as was usual when they were in public, he simply stared menacingly back. He hoped that the squirming of his insides were not visible to Pansy and the others.
Hermione’s expression softened somewhat, but she still looked skeptical. “Harry, of course I support whomever you want to snog or sleep with, but you don’t think Draco’s really
“Go back to your common room right now and take this,” Draco then spat at the terrified second-year before handing him a Nosebleed Nougat. “If anyone asks, the injuries are from me.”
“Nevermind that right now,” Harry replied, explaining that he knew where the Horcrux was. His own expression of awe mirrored that of Ron and Hermione’s as they showed him the basilisk fangs to explain what they'd been up to.
Instead of obeying, Draco pulled back his crotch and rubbed his lubricated hands on Harry’s dick. He could not think of a more marvellous sight than Harry Potter positively
After weeks of looking at Draco’s dot on the map, discovering that it wasn’t there, and ejaculating his anger, Harry recognized that his behavior was not healthy. Of course, Hermione caught on soon enough.
“I don’t give a bloody rat’s arse what Harry’s sexuality is!” Ron reported. “What kind of person d’you think I am?” Harry felt a rush of affection for Ron, which he noticed was shared wholeheartedly by Hermione.
“Don’t call me thick just ’cause I haven’t read as much as you,” Ron retorted, but no part of him actually seemed angry at Hermione’s statement. In fact, he looked positively chipper.
Nobody had dared tell the Dark Lord, but Draco was subjected to several rounds of the Cruciatus Curse from Bellatrix before she finally believed his lie — that he was trying to warn Crabbe and Goyle not to run away from Death Eater service because Lord Voldemort already knew of their whereabouts.
Harry, not being able to help himself, pressed his whole body to the edge of the bars and reached out to grab Draco’s shirt with his fist. Ron looked simply perplexed, forgetting for a moment the dire situation they were in.
“Oh, I think I ate something bad,” Draco retorted, noticing a boner coming. “Bathroom.” On his way there, he made sure the other package was safely tucked in.
Draco looked at Harry with such a glint in his eyes that it made Harry’s knees buckle. That familiar mixture of jealousy and desire always drove Harry wild. However, he knew this was the moment to stand his ground.
Hanging off the top of a stack of books with Goyle by his side, Draco felt the fire erupt beneath and around him.
On Christmas Eve, slouched in Harry’s arms after a particularly intense shag (though, let’s be honest, it was always intense when they were together), Draco decided — as he was doing more and more frequently nowadays — to let his guard down and talk.
Despite the horrified expression on Draco’s face and the less-than-ideal circumstances he was in, Harry couldn’t help but notice how handsome Draco had looked. He hadn't seen him so clearly, after all, in ages.
still think about Ginny. I dunno how to explain it…” Harry trailed off, hoping he was making even a tiny bit of sense to Ron.
“I know,” Draco interrupted. “You’ve got a mission, and I can’t help you. I just hope I’ll live to see the day when you’ve finished.”
He couldn’t pretend he wasn’t excited to see Draco. Exchanging a look with Hermione, who seemed to understand his every feeling, Harry bit his already swollen lip.
you, Ronald?” Hermione looked positively exasperated. “Ginny is perfectly capable of understanding that she and Harry’s situation is polyamorous, and that Harry’s bisexual” — Harry felt a gulp of relief — “and to answer your other question, I suppose anyone
But it was too late. The others had joined him, and Snape — Snape had gone and done it. And he, Draco, could do nothing but watch...watch as the greatest wizard in history fell from grace, as the other Draco — the
“Said what to Ginny?” Draco replied. “I don’t care what’s between you and Ginny. I need you to know that I wouldn’t have killed Dumbledore. I intended only for my mother to come through the vanishing cabinet, so that she would be safe when I...when I went to Dumbledore for help. I was going to take his protection. You know...come over to your side.”
The way Draco was talking about his death so absentmindedly made Harry furious. His gloating face reminded Harry of all the taunts he had had to endure from
“I panicked,” Draco continued. “I wasn’t ready to tell them about...about us, and I thought if I could get the fighting started, I could try and get you out without them noticing...It was stupid, obviously.”
Then, realization dawned. Malfoy was supposed to kill someone. Not curse them, not capture them and hand them to Voldemort, kill them. He obviously had not tried very hard, as he’d promised Harry, but his slip-ups...his mistakes...
Suddenly, commotion occurred. Harry saw Bellatrix rush to the top of the tower and Draco look at her in terror.
“Oh what? No,” Harry responded, bewildered. “I’m going with Luna actually. You know, as friends. What’s it to you anyway?”
“Expelliarmus!” Harry heard suddenly, as his body became immobilized and he couldn’t believe his eyes —
Mustering all of his courage, Draco turned to Harry and said, “I mean it, Potter. Get out of my way. Weasley deserved what he got. You can’t help me.”
Draco had returned to the dressing room to tell his parents that the boy downstairs was definitely not Harry when he heard a *crack*!
“Shut it Malfoy, I’ll do what I want,” Harry teased back, while flipping Draco on his backside and kissing him down the back while continuing to stroke his groin.
“Harry, you’re not supposed to let him in anymore!” Hermione snapped, with a touchingly worried expression on her face.
This seemed to awaken Draco to his senses, who once again resumed a stone-cold expression on his face. “
“Don’t,” Harry gulped. He couldn’t take it. This shared ability is what led Dumbledore to...to… “Let’s just go.”
“Still on for tonight then?” Draco smirked, knowing full well that there were just a few more hours until seven. “Haven’t got my share yet,” he added.
“Some of us,” Draco grinned, with a glance to Harry’s crotch. “Are gonna have to wait til tomorrow.” He winked.
It seemed that Draco was thinking the same thing. His expression hardened as he began to shoot a curse —
The color in Draco’s face disappeared. “No...” he began. “No. She wasn’t supposed to touch it. She was supposed to just give it to him. He would’ve known. He wouldn’t have touched it.” Draco seemed panicked now. “Is she...is she alive?”
The loosened clench in Harry’s stomach erupted into butterflies. He could barely respond before Draco had kissed him — with fuller force than before — pinning him down on the cushion bed setup he had made.
“I didn’t mean what I said, Harry, really I didn’t,” Draco replied, stunned by the thoughtfulness Harry was putting into this situation. “I’m so sorry about Ron. I didn’t mean for anyone to get hurt. We
Harry sighed. He had been waiting for this. “Look, I just said it to Ginny, don’t tell me I have to say it to you too,” he said.
But he did not get the comfort he was desiring. “You won’t even tell us, will you, mate?” Ron demanded, clearly annoyed. “We’re supposed to be best friends, you know?”
With an impatient look at both of them, Hermione answered in her typical textbook tone: “Polyamory is when one has multiple sexual, emotional, and/or romantic engagements at the same time. This does not negate any of such relationships, nor makes them less worthwhile. Sometimes it’s referred to as ethical non-monogamy, and there are several variations of how people negotiate it exactly. Ideally, however, all parties fully consent to the situation and maintain open and direct communication about it.”
Before he knew it, Snape had pinned him against a wall. Besides not trusting Snape himself, he had the sneaky feeling that he was being watched. If their roles were switched, surely, he would’ve followed Harry. Luckily, Draco knew to say just enough to put Snape off while not turning Harry against him.
“Harry?” Draco inquired worriedly as Harry revealed himself in the empty classroom. “What are you doing here? You need to get out,
He watched as Dumbledore talked soothingly to Draco, offering him the same protection Harry had offered.
As he saw Harry’s eyes widen and heard his moans deepen, Draco quickened his pace — coordinating his mouth and hand so that their motions collided.
“Draco…” Harry interrupted with difficulty, between groans. “I want you to know that there’s absolutely fucking nothing I’d rather be doing right now.” He panted and caught his breath.
“Er, Hermione, could you give me a minute?” He stammered awkwardly. With a bemused expression on her face, Hermione saw herself out.
Draco fought back. Concentrating on each other’s faces as hard as they had in their dueling match in second year, Harry and Draco shot sparks out of their wands and they dipped and ducked to avoid each other’s attacks. Without even knowing what was happening, without a second thought, Harry remembered the Half Blood Prince’s words —
Harry tasted deliciously. Playing with his tip with tongue circles and the occasional hand stroke, Draco couldn’t believe his luck.
Instead of Harry, however, he was greeted by Dumbledore. Panicking and not knowing what else to do, Draco disarmed him. It took Draco every ounce within him to not ask Dumbledore where Harry was. In case this all went wrong, and he had to go back to the Dark Lord...he could not think what would happen to him.
Harry had not been sleeping well for months. Whenever he tried to rid himself of the aching feeling in his stomach, he simply felt his insides clench harder in betrayal.
Not missing a beat, Harry ripped off his own and Draco’s robes and unbuckled Draco’s belt. Warmth greeted his hands as Draco thrashed under his touch. He had never felt anything so magnificent in his life.
“I know...I know he did, and I’ll never forgive him. He made his choice. It’s got to be over between us,” Harry’s heart sunk. Hearing Hermione say it confirmed what he already knew.
Harry proudly realized. Grasping Draco’s wand tightly in his hands, he saw a sea of familiar faces. It seemed that every student he had ever cared about was camping out here, everyone except…
, he thought, though it took a lot not to pin Harry against the door to the Slytherin common room right then and there.
“Harry, Harry!” A young Gryffindor approached, looking impatient. Draco quickly dropped Harry’s hand and resumed his usual scowl. “Er, hi,” the Gryffindor’s eyes turned from Harry to Draco, clearly perplexed, then turned back to Harry.
Voice full of sadness, but without the usual snarky contempt even at calling Harry the “Chosen One,” Draco continued. “Look, you have to kill a man who you hate, who you have every reason to seek revenge against. And I...” — Harry couldn’t believe his words —  “Well, let’s just say my circumstances are different.”
The look on Draco’s face when Harry was about to come was nearly as good. So full of satisfaction, joy,
“Oh, I’ll be doing more than trying,” Draco had his answer ready. With one swift motion, he unbuckled Harry’s belt and ripped off his own trousers. His groin raged at the sight of Harry in front of him — gorgeous Harry, Harry who had forgiven him — as he lubricated himself and watched the desire erupt in Harry’s eyes. He moved his dick down to where it needed to be, but took his time brushing its tip against Harry’s — as though it could’ve been an accident,
Sitting down next to Harry, he put his hand on Harry’s leg and then removed it immediately as though daring Harry to protest.
, in the flesh, real as ever. Draco looked terrified, tortured, forced to do the bidding of a master to whom he was no longer faithful.
Harry watched as the others egged Draco on to “do it,” still not fully comprehending what was happening before his eyes. Once or twice, Harry could’ve sworn that Draco glanced in his direction, pleading at him to help, to forgive. And then...it happened.
” Harry sputtered. “I don’t hear from you for nearly 20 years after you tried to kill me, and you have the nerve to stand there and ask me to
But wait, it seemed like this time was different. “Fuck you,” Harry nearly spat at him, though thankfully he was no longer screaming. “I told you, one more thing and you’d lose m—” he steadied himself. “Lose...er...your dignity,” he added lamely.
Truthfully, his nights with Harry had been the only thing keeping Draco from crying himself to sleep. He grew increasingly distant from his friends, not able to confide in them, and was filled with nothing but dread for what lie ahead.
Draco looked at Harry with hatred in his eyes. “I...trusted...you,” he managed to mutter before fainting. Before Harry could respond, however, Snape was on the scene. Harry went numb at the thought of what could happen to Draco, but there Snape was, fixing it, glaring at him...
When Snape finally let go, Draco turned around at once to look for Harry. “I know you’re there, Potter,” he yelled into the air.
“Oh I understand perfectly,” Harry retorted impatiently. “Life's just been so hard for you, hasn't it? It’s easier for you to jinx me than to come out to your friends. Easier to stay back and tell them where I was than actually be on my side, to catch me and turn me into Voldemort than run like you should’ve. Easier to put on a face and pretend than to admit that...that…” Harry’s chest heaved.
He was sitting with Ron and Hermione in the common room, attempting to finish his Transfiguration essay, when Hermione interrupted his reliving of a particularly fond time a few days ago. Draco was clutching onto Harry’s hair, leaned over on a pile of books, his face scrunched up in that adorable expression he made whenever he neared climax  —
Harry was having trouble controlling himself. He wanted so desperately to talk to Draco, to tell him he believed him. Draco had, no doubt, just saved his life, or at the very least delayed his killing and bought him time. Still, Harry was feeling grateful, horny, guilty, and — in a word — overwhelmed. That’s not even to mention terrified —
Draco broke. With a swift motion, he pulled Harry by the robes and embraced him in a long, hard kiss. His body thrashed in desire as he let his hands roam freely around Harry’s face, hair, and chest.
“You don’t have to listen to him, you know,” Harry chose his words carefully. “We could protect you. Our side, I mean. The Order. Dumbledore.”
But at the same time, he can’t pretend he didn’t also often imagine Draco beside him, especially in the depths of the night, or when he noticed something he knew Draco would like...things they could use as sex toys or simply objects for amusement, witty comebacks he knew would make Draco smirk that adorable smirk of his…
“Wait wait wait,” Draco shushed him as he edged his body closer and closer so that Harry could feel his breath on his face. “Didn’t you hear me say
“DRACO FUCKING PRAT MALFOY WHY THE HELL IS SHE HERE?!,” Harry screamed, but no sound came out. Bellatrix was followed by a swarm of Death Eaters including — to his horrific realization — Greyback.
Not believing his ears, Harry entered the cabinet, dragging Draco along. Before he knew it, they were enveloped together and sparks flew. The rumbling of the cabinet was only punctured by their moans and “Fuck”s.
“HARRY!” Hermione shouted as she came out of the common room, looking taken aback to see Harry engulfed in snogging. “I would’ve thought...after...oh,
“Oh this? Thought it might be fun,” Draco dared himself to say, moving closer to Harry. Pulling Harry by the wrist, he kissed him. “Get in, won’t you?”
Draco, meanwhile, had taken Harry’s act of saving his life as a gesture of forgiveness. He approached Harry as soon as they had exited the Room, with a determined look on his face.
Seven o’clock quickly became Harry’s favorite time of day. The other hours seemed to serve the sole purpose of counting down until seven. He often found himself filling them with day dreams of recent love-making sessions with Draco.
That night, Harry went to bed feeling more clear headed than he had in years. Swearing to give Hermione a big thank-you hug in the morning, Harry rolled over, and — clutching Draco’s wand close to his body — fell asleep with a grin on his face.
In a tender act, Harry took Draco’s head and placed it on his own shoulder, stroking his head as he did so.
Looking into Draco’s eyes, Harry understood. Voldemort was, after all, the world’s greatest Legilimens. If Draco said any more, Voldemort would know.
For a few minutes, he thought gloriously of the life he could have if he did what Dumbledore told him — all the sex positions he and Harry had wanted to try, all the
“Fine. FINE,” Draco screamed, annoyance etching into every corner of his voice convincingly. “I suppose Potter
Sparks flew out of the wand’s tips as Harry’s hands went hot. The heat then traversed Harry’s fingertips and flowed through his whole body.
Knowing a lost cause when he saw one, Draco took one last look at the blazing green eyes he had come to savor and turned around. He walked away and didn’t look back.
“It is of utmost importance that Draco does not want to complete the task ahead, for your purposes and mine. We value our classmates’ characters after all,” —
As Dumbledore said all the right things and Draco resisted the exact amount necessarily — he was getting rather good at that — he looked around anxiously for a sign of Harry.
Feeling his body turn a temperature he had not experienced since adolescence, Harry’s heart pounded.
“Potter, a word,” he snuck up behind Harry after the procession. He had just been talking with the Weasley girl, who shot him a knowing look as she rejoined her fellow Gryffindors.
Draco stopped in his tracks when he realized he was being followed. He did not quite like the idea of explaining to anyone why he had been out late that night. He panicked, and the first excuse he could come up with was Slughorn’s Christmas party. Little did he know, he’d actually be dragged there, as though he had no dignity whatsoever, to be paraded in front of — oh god,
“That was, er, different,” Harry muttered when they finished, seemingly speechless. “You sure you’re okay?”
the whole time?” Draco asked, taking a few breaths after his own orgasm. “God, I fucking missed this.”
Draco knew that his time at Hogwarts was nearly up. But he swore he had to properly explain to Harry what had happened. After two failed attempts, he decided to try again at the funeral. This time, he made sure that Harry’s friends were not around.
“Harry, I know we haven’t properly addressed the topic, and it’s my fault for not checking in before...I feel so guilty and of course I haven’t told anyone, even Ron, but —”
The two made eye contact for no more than a split second when Draco turned away and, again, got dressed at lightning speed. And, again, his whole demeanor changed, settling back into the cool meanness that characterized Draco Malfoy.
“What? Yeah, yeah...” Harry replied, rubbing his scar. He looked Hermione dead in the eye before continuing. “He’s angry. Really angry. He doesn’t know why my wand acted of his own accord. He’s...he’s asking Ollivander,” Harry’s head throbbed.
Harry was stunned by the level of maturity Draco was displaying. “Me too,” he replied. “I mean it. I’ll never forget this year, you know.”
“Er, Harry, could I talk to you for a second?” Hermione pulled Harry aside following their conversations with Griphook and Ollivander. Ron had gone to the kitchen to grab some food.
“Because, despite it all, I know how it is to be forced into a war and to make choices based on hopeless options. When I saw you at the trials, I knew you had gone through just as much as anyone else…perhaps even more.” The last words felt like a sting. It made Draco shift uncomfortably at the thought of Potter knowing anything about the times Draco had been tortured for not following orders. It had been hell living with the Death Eaters, and they had easily sensed that he feared killing others. It was a weakness in their eyes, and somehow torture seemed like the best approach in order to ‘make him a true Death Eater’.
“Do I?” Draco tried to keep his gaze steady, but Potter’s intensity was too much. He felt himself look away.
There was a moment of silence. Somehow, Draco hadn’t exactly expected this to be the reality of it, and the thought of Potter having considered Draco’s arrival and made precautions because of it was completely unheard of in Draco’s eyes.
It was hard for Harry not to notice Draco’s trembling, and he raised an eyebrow at him. “If you’re trembling because you’re scared then please do tell me.”
The quick pace and heavy thrusting made Draco feel incredible. He moaned loudly as he tried to communicate that he was close.
“That’s okay. I’m not exactly experienced in this either when it comes to two guys, so we can just do what’s comfortable and go from there, alright?” The reassuring smile was back, and it was damn good at its job of being comforting.
“Oh, please. As if he could ever land me. No need to become jealous over your own boyfriend, Weasley.” Draco scoffed.
“But no one can beat the Chudley Cannons.” Ron looked smug as he spoke, blissfully unaware of how bad his favourite team actually was.
“I did put up wards against those bearing the mark.” At that, Draco finally opened his eyes to look at Potter with a questioning frown.
“Say, your words were a bit difficult to catch, but right before you… did you?” Harry looked at him, stroking circles on his arm. It was a soothing and calming feeling and it was difficult not to be honest in such a situation.
It was warm and slippery. Harry could feel the taste of chocolate from when Draco had secretly taken a piece as Harry was explaining the recipe.
intend to apply for?” Draco knew his voice was on the verge of a sneer, but Weasley seemed too preoccupied with the topic at hand to notice.
“I always thought you liked him during school.” Luna looked distracted as she reached her hand out to something that only she seemed to be able to see.
Harry had put his arms around him, embracing him for a moment. It had made all the feelings of bitterness go away in a blink of an eye.
“How could you not know? Everyone knows!” Pansy sighed in exasperation, obviously having followed news about the saviour much more intently than Draco. “Merlin, I can’t believe that you actually told me you fancy the guy when you don’t even pick up on any regular news about him. He’s literally the most famous guy out there. You can get information about him to your hearts content, yet you don’t even know about his current job.”
“I can’t help but feel a vague Deja-vu of sorts.” Said Harry, chuckling lowly. “Only last time this happened we were bickering about getting away from one another.” Draco huffed back, kissing Harry’s neck softly as he spoke.
“Are you saying I didn’t do well in charms or DADA, Pansy?” Draco turned towards them, frowning. Being done with the potion, it was now time to wait for it to finish. He walked over to the couch and was just about to sit down besides Pansy when she got up and somehow managed to nonchalantly push Draco over so that he was forcibly sat next to Potter instead.
“Blaise is doing alright. He travels a lot, but whenever he’s in England he comes around for some catching up. Seems like he misses the place, as he’s coming back more often these days.” Pansy said, speaking fondly of her friend.
“If you say so. Next time, I’d expect that you at least buy me dinner before you go telling people about us. Or at the very least tell me first.” Draco could hear the laughter in Potter’s voice as he spoke, and he knew he was teasing him, but somehow, he ended up with a slight redness in his cheeks as he scoffed.
Draco got his coat and went down to his car. He was not going to go over to the bakery today. He couldn’t… He needed time to properly go through whatever emotions he was currently battling with.
He must be relieved to know he won’t have to be stuck forever to his former nemesis who had, just five minutes ago, also admitted to harbouring feelings towards him.
It felt hot, sending a shiver down Draco’s back. He felt Potter explore his mouth, their tongues intertwining.
“I’ll be gentle, tell me if you want to stop.” The words felt reassuring as Draco took a deep breath and nodded.
Placing all the vials neatly into a small container, Draco headed to the counter with Potter trailing behind him.
Potter was sleeping soundly. His face seemed mostly peaceful besides the small frown of his brows. His bedside table had a bouquet of white lilies in a dark green vase. Other than that it looked fairly empty in the room.
The next week went by slowly. Too slowly, in Draco’s mind. It was hard to keep his focus and to be honest he had been thinking too much about spending time with his friends. It had been particularly boring to not be able to spend any time with Harry, since he was busy with the bakery and Draco himself was working non-stop through the week.
“It’s strange, isn’t it? Having McGonagall as headmistress.” Pansy said in a low voice. Draco only gave her a nod in return, not wanting to breach the subject any further.
“No need, you’d be amazingly oblivious if you weren’t aware of what the whole wizarding world knows about you.” Draco shrugged. “Everyone knows about your ability to destroy every potion you come across.”
When he eventually managed to drag himself out of bed, he opened the door to the living room and was greeted with a nice smell.
“Uh huh…” Harry had already told Amelia about what had happened after she had confronted him at the party.
Draco didn’t know exactly what he had expected, but Potter having the silkiest hair despite the unruly curls was not something he had even considered in his wildest dreams. How on earth could a mop of hair that looks so messy be so easy on the touch? It was mesmerizing and Draco couldn’t help but keep touching it.
Harry could feel Draco shiver under his touch. It made him want even more. He continued passionately kissing him for a while longer, until he finally managed to break the kiss.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t have anything else. I didn’t know it would be so big.” Potter murmured as he looked at Draco.
Potter was standing there, in a warm green sweater and black pants, a small smile on his face. However, despite him being dazzling as usual, the thing that convinced Draco he was looking at an angel was the white hair that seemed to glimmer in the sunlight seeping in through the windows.
“Trying to run away, eh?” The woman snickered and just like that the spells started flowing from wands all around him.
“Oh, I was talking to Parkinson? I had no idea; the letter only showed the shops signature. Parkinson owns this place?” Potter looked around as he was talking, taking in the environment with interest.
Draco was just about to make a comment about how his priorities were slightly off, when Potter turned towards him. “Just gotta get one of these.”
“Ask him to show you next time.” She grinned mischievously before refusing to answer more questions.
“You were always looking at Harry, so you never noticed the snitch even if it was right by your head. How funny that was.” The voice, airy and without malice, yet it felt like a slap across the face to Draco.
“Well, it’s only natural for these people to loathe me. They have all the right to do so. I can handle a few comments here and there, it’s fine.” Draco made sure to keep himself composed as he spoke.
“Well, all I can say is that I’m glad you decided to stop the incessant hair gel usage before all of this happened.”
“I do work part time at bewitched dresses as well. So I have to make sure my style is always up to expectation.”
They chatted a bit more, until Harry had to go back to tend to the customers. Draco was stopped before he could leave, as Amelia got hold of him.
“Really? That’s great! Then I’ll try adding it to the list. I’m currently making a new list of pastries that I will launch in the bakery for this season. Since it’s autumn, the pie seemed appropriate”
“Yes, although if you haven’t made it before, I’d recommend having someone who has already brewed it supervising to make sure it’s made correctly.” Draco gave a strained polite smile to the customer in front of him, hoping he would come across as somewhat decent.
“Wait… You actually made this? It looks amazing!” Draco said in awe. So not just the best baker he had met, but also a great glass sculptor as well.
And that’s how he ended up mere inches away from the face of none other than bloody Harry Potter. Draco jerked back in surprise at the sudden closeness almost bumping into the shelves behind him, while Potter slowly straightened his pose, looking more shocked at the sight of Draco.
“So that’s what you were doing. You were acting suspicious indeed. But to be fair… I was just browsing the shelves myself, so it’s only your own clumsiness to blame for it.” Potter said, it was pissing Draco off that Potter wasn’t showing as much distress as him.
“That would take time away from your very important explanation, I’m fine with this.” Potter tilted his head slightly upwards to meet Draco’s eyes and his gaze held a challenge to them. He lifted one brow slightly as a small smirk played on his lips. “You were saying?”
“He literally came flying at me while I was in the bath. I still haven’t managed to get a proper explanation though.” Draco felt himself move with the shrug of Potter’s shoulders.
“Hey…” Draco started not liking what person came to mind when he considered other bright witches or wizards of their time. “You’re not about to call that Granger girl, are you?”
“I-… Of course you make sense, but I just don’t think I-.“  “You don’t think you deserve it?” Draco felt himself stop midsentence as he realised how vulnerable he was currently being. What Potter just said was something he had never intended to tell anyone.
Draco turned to look at Pansy as she hoisted herself up on a table filled with Draco’s recipes. Her face lit up at the mention of yesterday and Draco could instantly see through her overly conspicuous innocence.
In the end, Draco decided to head back empty handed. He would have to try again another day, he thought.
“Oh, indeed! He was nothing like the hothead over there.” Pansy’s voice dropped a notch as she spoke the last part of her sentence, but being the only ones in the room, Draco heard her loud and clear. “Always got good grades in charms and DADA because of it, I think.”
Draco turned and scanned the shelf of ingredients behind him before picking a few and placing them on the counter. “You’ll also need some mistletoe berries.”
And that was how Draco had been put in this highly uncomfortable situation where he had to tend to the front desk and try to look as warm and welcoming as possible. It had been easier said than done, as the customers who had entered the store had either awkwardly paid for supplies without any eye contact or they had just as awkwardly tried to exit the shop inconspicuously. The only saving grace had been the last witch who had seemed slightly uncomfortable for a while, before most likely taking pity on him and giving him a smile back and actually talking to him more than a simple “thank you.”
Draco tried making as little noise as possible as he got ready for breakfast. He had the feeling that interacting with Potter would not be the best way to start his first day back at Hogwarts.
Madam Hooch’s voice rung out as she declared the house match between Slytherin and Gryffindor to begin. Both teams shot up into the sky taking their respective places on the field.
The words flowed easily from Harry’s mouth, and Draco suspected he was unaware of just how much it meant to Draco to hear something like that.
“Can you two stop trying to one up each other?” Hermione huffed, tired of their endless arguments. “We’re grown-ups now, can’t we try to be a bit more civilised?”
“We both know that’s not going to happen” Harry said, as he tugged on Draco’s arm, making him turn to face him.
“Well, there’s no one I trust more when it comes to potion than the two of you. We’ll try it out tonight then.” Potter said as he handed the potion back to Hermione.
“For a muggle-born wizard most of your life shouldn’t make sense to you. I’m sure you can try and believe what is happening.” Draco felt the words come out harsher than intended, as he was feeling the stress overtake him.
“Hopefully they won’t drown us in homework from the start.” Draco said answering Pansy’s question as he picked at his toast. His appetite hadn’t recovered since the time the manor had been filled with death-eaters and you-know-who for what felt like an eternity. He found it to be disgraceful as he had become thinner and thinner each day, which had added more worry to his mother. Yet, he couldn’t help it. The endless nightmares had kept him awake at the manor long after the trials, and it appeared they had followed him back to Hogwarts as well.
“Hello again. Same procedure as always, I suppose.” He said looking a bit bashful as he rubbed his neck.
“Great! I was wondering if you’d like to hang at my place and watch a movie? I’ve had this one I’ve wanted to see for a while now”
“Was it just a side effect?” Granger seemed more relaxed once both had confirmed the lack of pain they currently felt and was now analysing the two.
! You guys were always scheming together in school.” Ron crossed his arms, leaning back slightly as he basked in the glory of his brilliant conclusion.
“It’s not… Well, maybe it is, but it isn’t what you think…” Draco was stumbling over his words at this point, which he hadn’t had the experience of doing before. Was the situation really making him this flustered?
He didn’t hesitate as he parted his own lips and allowed Potter entrance. He felt himself gasp into the kiss as Potter’s skilled tongue made a mess out of him. He hadn’t had much time for romance throughout his years at Hogwarts, and especially during the war. This was the first time he had actually gone further than a peck on the lips. But, somehow, it felt strangely natural to let Potter dominate his mouth like this.
“Also,” Harry said, looking at Draco. “I’ll have a talk with professor Shrew. I’m sure it will make it more difficult for him to disregard your skills once I vouch for you.”
“He’s already avoiding me; I don’t think he’ll be agreeing to such a proposition anytime soon” Harry could feel a tightening in his chest at the thought of them not being friends anymore. It wasn’t something he wanted to happen at all.
“Damn it. That is true…” Draco sighed mockingly, trying to regain some sense of casualness. “I suppose your secrets are safe with me then.”
“Well, yeah. And I’m thrilled on your behalf don’t get me wrong, but I just wondered you know. Considering what Harry’s Patronus is and all.”
“Yeah, thank you for stopping by.” Potter said, also standing up. “Oh! Before you go, Ginny could you take a look at one of the cases for our team? I would like your input on it.” Draco noted that by the sound of it, Ginny was part of Potter’s Auror team. He figured the life of an Auror seemed to suit the youngest Weasley. She definitely was strong-willed and probably the strongest of all the Weasleys.
Draco laughed, he really thought himself to be lucky to have managed to befriend both the siblings of this bakery. They were both so similar, yet so different in personality.
Draco sorted through them quickly before stopping short at a picture where only Potter’s face was gazing up at him. He was sitting in one of the couches in The Three Broomsticks that was situated in front of the dimly lit fireplace. The flames cast a warm orange light on Potter’s face that made his eyes twinkle slightly. Draco stared for a second, the conversation with Granger rising to the surface once more. He eyed the picture and had to admit that Potter wasn’t only known for being the saviour of the wizarding world. People were also infatuated with his messy black hair and deep green eyes. He looked less formal and intimidating there he sat in a red sweater and jeans, smiling up at him. The Harry Potter in the picture leaned his head to the side as he winked at Draco. Draco felt a small smile tug at his lips.
Damn it to hell! Draco thought. The words Pansy had said about him running away being more likely suddenly made a whole lot of sense. She had known who the customer was, and somehow decided that it was appropriate not to provide that vital information to Draco. If the cold didn’t kill her, Draco sure as hell would.
“You might not be aware of it because of your own overflow of magical power, but I’m quite the wizard myself, Potter.” Draco said in a tired voice, not bothering to open his eyes.
“Yeah, it must’ve been hard the moment you couldn’t depend on Harry doing all the cooking anymore once you both moved out” Hermione said thoughtfully, before adding “Ron tried very hard in the beginning with pretending some of the things he bought from the bakery was made by himself”.
“It’s been a while! How’s everything going? Must be a lot of work now with the start of the new year and everything” Amelia seemed as cheerful as ever, making it a bit easier for Draco. He was fully aware of the fact that Amelia was trying her best to make him feel less uncomfortable.
Draco stood up too and felt himself sway forward, his vision blurry. Harry caught him and held him firmly. “You okay?”
Harry had told him that they were pretty famous for the waffles there, and that it was a must to try it out at least once.
A blue wisp of magic shot out of his wand and being so close to Harry, Draco felt the insane power that Harry possessed when it came to magic. Apparently the ‘workout’ had done nothing to diminish the extent of his magical powers.
Draco stared for a while at the beautiful girl in front of him. She had long dark brown hair and shared the same emerald green eyes as her brother. So then why? Why didn’t Draco feel any attraction? She would be the type he would instantly fall for usually, but somehow; he didn’t feel anything romantic.
Draco heard a shriek as he looked up and saw Pansy gaping at the smoke rising from Potter’s cauldron. He heard Blaise mutter to Potter if he was alright. It seemed like both Pansy and Blaise had a hard time comprehending the utter failure that Potter had managed to create while in his body.
“I just… In case you ever were to come knocking, I didn’t want you to feel the wards and decide not to go any further.” Potter’s voice was low as he spoke. “I made sure to not include you in the wards.”
Draco thought it strange as he was allowed entrance despite the wards. Potter had included him in those that were allowed entry to his office? Rather strange, he thought.
“Can I help you?” Draco arched an eyebrow. “I’m not usually tasked to do something for the law department.”
“Just wondering if you are more inclined to touching others easily or if you prefer not to be in close contact with the people around you.”
“Especially if your opponent has too much pride.” Potter reached out his hand, but Draco only scowled at it before getting back on his feet, brushing off the non-existing dirt on his cloak. He dismissed the notion of dizziness that was now present.
“Very good! This is the sort of potion skills I expect from all of you.” Shrew said, studying Granger’s work. Draco rolled his eyes. Granger obviously wasn’t gonna let anything stop her from rising to the top of every damn class she attended.
He was just about to reach into the small basket that separated several vials that was stored in a range of colours.
“The way it burnt your uniform is kinda telling, but if I’m being honest, I just guessed it more or less.”
Draco watched TV for a while, until he decided to get some iced tea. He headed to the fridge and filled up a glass before heading back.
The sting in his chest was still apparent as he weighted the pain against the alluring warmth of a good, long shower. Biting his teeth’s together, he spent a couple more minutes than necessary just standing there, soaking in the water.
After getting out of the shower, Draco put on the clothes he had been given. There was a certain simplicity to the style of the clothes, but it seemed to suit the bakery guy quite a lot.
“That’s very persuasive, Draco.” Harry licked his lips before muttering something. Draco was about to ask, but soon realised what he had been doing when his hand got covered in lube.
“I’ll protect you, I promise.” The sudden confidence in Harry’s voice was comforting the turmoil in Draco’s stomach.
Draco slowly turned the device under the microscope as he inspected the damage. He hated it when he had to do repairs on the smaller devices as it was such a pain to locate it all.
As Draco made a move to straighten himself from his leaning position on the desk, he quickly scrambled back down as Potter had closed the distance between. It came as a bit of a shock when Draco felt a strong grip on his shirt, tightly holding him in place. It was impossible for Draco to try and stand up anymore, as Potter was now in-between his legs, making him awkwardly half sit, half lean against the desk. Potter inched closer to his face; the mask of professionality long gone. It was then Draco saw it, the old Harry Potter. The one who acted before he thought things through. The image dragged him back into nostalgia so much that he stood frozen only able to blink wide-eyed at the green glare in front of him.
“It means he’s a lot less like he used to be. He’s quite pleasant to be around if I’m being honest. Even Ginny thinks so too.” Potter shrugged.
“I barely did anything. You made this happen. It’s not often someone manage it so quickly. That’s amazing.” Potter said, not looking bothered by the sudden awkwardness Draco was feeling.
“Obviously not. I just took pity on the man for having such a shite opponent as Potter.” Draco shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly.
“I’m… feeling fine actually. Much better than a minute ago!” Potter looked up from where he was seated, the big grin on his face would have looked breathtakingly beautiful to anyone, Draco reasoned.
Pansy had arranged the tea and was chatting away happily with Potter, both situated at the vintage couch, sipping their tea. It allowed Draco to work fairly peacefully without having Potter’s stare boring into his back every time he made a movement.
“Do you have some time later?” Draco asked, Harry had become used to Draco not meeting his eyes as frequently as he had been before.
“Strange as it might sound, I’ve never considered you a fool either, Malfoy.” Potter arched an eyebrow which was enough to paint a picture of what would happen if he actually did leave him to those guys.
“That’s true. Be careful on your way back, it’s still icy outside” Harry said before embraing Draco in a warm hug.
Harry leaned down again, kissing Draco’s stomach, before lifting his leg slightly as he started kissing his thigh. It sent shivers through his body.
Draco’s eyes searched the group, but he couldn’t find Harry. He looked up only to see Harry was still in the air, a small smile on his face as he flew towards Draco. It was then Draco felt it. A tight feeling in his chest as he realised Harry cared for him enough to allow him to win despite him being superior. Sure enough, Draco had made him a rather interesting deal, but somehow, Draco felt like Harry would’ve let him win had he only asked nicely.
“I like you too.” Harry said in a genuine voice. “I’ve said we should try it out, and when I make a decision, I go all in on it. Believe me.” He reached out and stroked Draco’s cheek gently, before turning even more serious.
“Well, if you’re trying to convince me to move in, you’ve definitely succeeded.” Draco joked, laughing as Harry pretended to look overly relieved.
“Both mother and I had to stay put in the manor for a few months before we were allowed out. Our wands have been replaced, but they know of my return to Hogwarts, so I’m allowed to use it as usual when it comes to schoolwork.” Draco withdrew the wand from his pocket handing it to Blaise as he looked it over. “Father did not fare as well as we did.” Blaise looked up from the wand at once, a frown plastered across his face. “It was no surprise though.” Draco shrugged, knowing full well that even if Potter had thrown himself on the ground begging, the judges would not lessen the sentence given to his father. Nor did he deserve anything less, Draco thought to himself.
Harry was still speechless from the unbelievable banging he had just experienced. For a moment, it seemed that all had returned to normal.
, Draco thought, as Harry smiled for the first time in what seemed like years. Draco took the moment to lean in and kiss Harry. “I do appreciate your offer, and I’m doing my best. You have to trust me too, okay?”
He went into the village, as usual, with fellow Slytherins, though he couldn’t help but daydream what it would be like to be fucking Harry inside the shrieking shack.
“It’s just that…” Harry continued, pushing his nerve beyond his limits. “Er...I mean... could help you...you know, if you’d like,” Harry added sheepishly.
For a split second, it seemed as though Draco was tempted. Then, removing himself from Harry’s shoulder, he sputtered, “Go to Dumbledore? I can’t do that. He’ll kill me and my whole family! I’m not supposed to see Dumbledore unless...until...” Draco gazed off into the distance. “Can’t we just drop it?” He added pleadingly.
Fully erect now—more so than ever before—Harry entered the maze of indescribable bliss that was Draco Malfoy.
“We’re opening our marriage, Ginny and I,” Harry said, building up his courage. “She wants the chance to explore her sexuality and I...well, to be honest, I can’t stop thinking about you.”
“Harry! Where have you been?” Hermione screamed as she saw Harry barging in. Her blushed face and messy hair reflected exactly how Harry had looked just a few minutes ago.
Harry joined Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and took a big gulp from the goblet in front of him.
Thinking about the last time he was frustrated and annoyed at seeing someone unexpectedly in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, Harry headed off with a sprint.
“The famous Harry Potter,” Draco teased, ruffling Harry’s hair. “Look at you now. Not so tough anymore, eh?”
Though Draco kept his composure, his heart throbbed when he heard Snape tell the Dark Lord when Harry would be moved.
Walking outside the Gryffindor common room to join Dumbledore’s funeral, Harry nearly crashed into something.
“Er...I just noticed, that, er, you weren’t in class,” Harry replied pathetically. “What are you doing here? Is there...Is anyone else here?”
“Brilliant detective work there, Weasley. Shame you have no idea what you’re talking about.” Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes.
Pansy looked over her shoulder, with a mischievous smirk and a raised eyebrow as she pointed to Draco.
The train was already crowded with people trying to find compartments that were empty. Draco felt luck being on his side as he had boarded the train right beside an unoccupied compartment. He made his way inside, putting his luggage away before settling down with a book. He hoped he wouldn’t have to meet any of his former classmates before arrival.
“Alright.” Potter didn’t push any further, as he let out an almost inaudible sigh before slipping into bed himself.
“You really didn’t have to” Draco said, feeling relieved at this point for having decided to give a present to Amelia as well. He hadn’t told her, because he thought she would most likely tell him it was fine and he didn’t have to, but he had the perfect gift so he couldn’t help it.
“Sure I can walk.” Draco waved at him and took a step which sent him face first into the sofa pillows.
“Yeah, I guess it’s kinda weird, but when I asked my dad about it, he told me an unusual name leaves a bigger impression” Draco felt a bit embarrassed. Most people didn’t really seem to like things that were unusual, but despite that, everyone had nodded in agreement just because they knew his background and wanted to be on the good side of the Malfoy family.
“Hey! It’s not corruption! I’m just looking out for Harry. He hates the headache potion they have there, so he’ll probably try and avoid it as best as possible, but that’s just gonna make it worse. Also, I’m sure no one would mind if someone brought specially made potions to him considering who he is.”
“Eh… Well, I’m not particularly good at it, no. I never really learnt how to cook or anything” Draco said, unsure of how much he should tell them about his life.
“Good seeing you too.” Draco said, feeling a hint of relief at knowing his friends would be accompanying him back to Hogwarts. He hadn’t been too sure whether or not any of the former Slytherins would return.
“No way! I won’t be able to sleep” Draco felt himself still being on edge from the far too many scares he had been put through.
Draco barely registered Pansy’s greeting through his determination of not, once again, hiding behind the counter. It hadn’t exactly worked out well for him last time, and the embarrassment of being caught had taken a toll on his pride.
What had happened? Draco thought to himself. Why had he been so bothered by seeing Harry half naked? They were both guys so it really shouldn’t have mattered, right?
“Then tell me, why won’t you even look at me anymore Draco?” Draco felt himself shiver slightly at hearing his name come out of Potter’s mouth so easily. He wondered when Potter had decided it was time to change over to first names the same way he had done with Pansy and Blaise. Or perhaps the situation at hand was just too tense that Potter had said it without being aware of it himself.
He allowed himself to pull his legs together trying to hide his erection as he felt too exposed, too vulnerable. Harry’s hands were warm as they slid up his thighs and firmly squeezed them. The look in Harry’s eyes was warm and gave Draco a sense of trust as he waited for Draco to decide on what to do next.
“You’re so damn persistent at only seeing the good in people…” Draco managed to mumble through sobs.
“Maybe Harry was right. You do seem a lot more decent now. I might’ve been completely wrong about you after all!” Ron said, and Draco cried on the inside as he knew he had now committed to having to read up on and follow the Chudley Cannons for the foreseeable future.
“You didn’t though. I’ve come to the conclusion myself; you know. I was pretty confused at first, but I didn’t dislike you, so I gave it a chance to see how I truly felt. And now I know” Harry smiled, as Draco buried his head in his chest, sobbing.
“Hey there! You wanna try out the new special? I’ve made a pumpkin spice latte for the holiday season” Amelia said. She was Harry’s little sister, and she shared quite a lot of similarities to her brother in appearance and her personality was also the nice type although a bit more upfront when it came to voicing her opinions. Draco quite liked her strong and confident attitude.
“I wasn’t hiding!” Draco snapped back, hating himself for not having been able to stand tall and composed when Potter had entered the shop. “I was simply caught up in looking for some ingredients.” He felt himself cringe at his own lie, and the awkwardness of it all.
Once again, Draco could feel his cheeks warming up. This time, however, the reason for it was the awkward similarities of those eyes staring at him in his previous dream.
He felt himself tense up as Harry grazed the tender skin. “You okay?” Harry looked worried as he stopped his movement, searching Draco’s eyes.
“And more filled with random weird facts about creatures, I’m sure.” They both chuckled a bit at the truth in those words before Draco felt himself hesitate for a moment. “How…How is she?” He mumbled.
Surely it was a strange mix of people gathered together at the Gryffindor table, but Draco paid it no mind. He felt, for once, like things were about to change for the better.
“That’s gonna take some time to get used to.” Draco muttered back. “Call it payment for helping with the potion.” Granger grinned back at him. He couldn’t help but smile at that. “Fair enough.”
“Oh, don’t mind me. Just washing my hands. I got some of the potion on me, and it’s a bit sticky.” Potter said matter-of-factly, but his voice was a pitch lower, and the sound of it vibrated through Draco’s body.
Harry leaned over and kissed his forehead, before lying back down embracing Draco. They both lay there, silence slowly taking over, as they felt sleep take hold of them. Draco shifted closer to Harry before closing his eyes and drifting off to sleep.
The room got quiet, as all that could be heard was a low “Oooooo….” From Ginny. Somehow it seemed like the youngest Weasley had one favourite consumption, which was other’s drama.
As Draco had closed the door and turned around, he felt himself yelp as he stood face to face with Potter. “Are you deliberately trying to avoid me?”
“I wouldn’t dream of it.” It just gave Draco a sense of uneasiness, as Potter was too much of a wildcard in general.
Before Draco could come up with another excuse, Potter’s right hand reached out and landed on his forehead gently as he tilted his head and furrowed his brows in concentration.
Because it was all buried underneath a joke, Draco felt oddly confident as he said things he would never dare say had the situation been different and not so absurdly ridiculous as it currently was.
Harry didn’t know as of when it had become so natural for him to be close to Draco and wanting to touch him.
Draco opened the gift. Inside was a beautiful glass sculpture of a deer. It had a light blue colour to it, and the details were amazing.
“No, I- I’m fine. Just need to keep breathing, so I don’t-.” Draco stopped himself midway, feeling heat rise to his cheeks at the fact that he was struggling so badly with restraining himself.
“I want Harry as my boyfriend” Draco said loudly to himself, as he knew he was the only one left in the building at this point.
Draco could only gaze back at him in disbelief, unable to process what had just happened. “You better not regret this instantly.” Was all he could muster as he buried his face in Harry’s neck, concealing the heat that had been rising up to his cheeks.
“I…” Draco sighed as he leaned back against the door in defeat. “If you freak out, I’ll obliviate you.” Draco said as he looked straight into Potter’s eyes. Potter frowned. “Okay, I guess…?”
“Mistakes were made and there were some serious bad ones, but it doesn’t help for the few of us left to fight among ourselves. We have one year left before most of us will be going our separate ways, so until then, keep your shit together. As head girl of our year, if I see
“Always the favourite, aren’t you Granger.” Draco sighed, knowing Professor Shrew would never give him the same treatment. “Hey, it’s saving us a lot of trouble right now.” Granger argued back with a cheeky grin.
His focus then shifted to Draco who tried to casually clean while following the play out of the corner of his eye.
“Sure, and I can with confidence say that he’s still got that foolish sense of constantly trying to be a hero.” Draco snickered, which earned him a small chuckle from Hermione. “But I guess he is a better person than I thought he was.” Draco mumbled, it felt odd to compliment Potter of all people.
A little later Hermione had gone back home, satisfied with finally solving the issue, despite still being cautious about it maybe not working long term. Both Draco and Harry had spent a couple of hours around the house, an odd feeling when they didn’t have to follow each other everywhere. It had become such an ingrained thing that Draco had to stop himself from following Potter around.
Sure enough Potter had spent quite a few times holding onto his wrist and standing close to him, but Draco had never initiated any contact with Potter himself. He hadn’t felt like he could, like he wasn’t allowed to do that. However, in the spur of the moment he hadn’t thought about it, and his body had acted on its own.
“Then stop being so distracted for Merlin’s sake! One more mess up and I’ll be personally escorting you there.”
Harry just chuckled before leaving the bedroom, allowing Draco to sit in silence and enjoy his breakfast which made the day already so much better.
“I also know you wouldn’t want a bunch of nosy people poking around your shop, now would you?” Potter quirked an eyebrow at him.
They had spent a few times already at a small waffle house that was situated at the outskirt of the town.
There wasn’t a lot of stores here, as most of the stores were located a bit further into the town centre. Draco did, however, pause at the small bakery that was welcoming him with a colourful ‘Blue Ocean Bakery' sign. The bakery was beautifully painted and looked almost like a post card in Draco’s opinion.
Draco arched his back as he moaned at the fast pace Harry was moving at. Just hearing Harry’s hitched breath behind him and feeling the strong hands gripping his hips made him feel a second wave of heat rise up.
“Oh, how nice of you, Potter.” The sarcasm was evident, and Potter huffed out as he lay back down on the mattress. “I can’t wait to try and rebuild my life again! It’s going to be so easy, it’s not like I bear the dark mark or anything.”
Then Harry leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s experimentally. It was a moment Draco would never forget. A spark could be felt as their magic seemed to react to each other, and then the heat was gone, and Potter had leaned back slightly.
“So, then the two of you have just been pretending to be each other for the last couple of weeks?” Blaise said with a raised eyebrow. “That’s hilarious!” He laughed although no one else seemed to share his gleefulness.
“Y-yes… more…” Draco gasped between breaths, hung up on the new sensation running through him with every push of Harry’s cock.
He felt a slight burn as Harry’s finger started sliding out and in of his hole in a slow pace. He continued the motion for a while until Draco breathed out “Another one.”.
A flinch swept across Draco’s face before he managed to school his expression, hoping Potter hadn’t been alert enough to notice. He knew what the ‘despite it all’ entailed, a flashback of the war had forced its way to the front of his mind for only a second, but Draco had spent years suppressing it, and by Merlin if he was to tear the seal of that memory in front of none other than Harry Potter.
“I told you to prepare yourself beforehand, didn’t I?” Draco breathed back, unable to fight Harry’s weight on him.
“Then if you’re able to give it a chance, why not? Don’t give him any big expectations and just make a go for it. You already seem to know that he won’t stay as friends, so if you want to keep him around, then this might be your only option”.
Although Draco was expecting some sort of embarrassing talk regarding the bed incident, nothing of sorts happened. Potter acted like normal as if nothing had happened, which became Draco’s saving grace, and made it easier to be in the same room without the constant sensation of wanting to cringe. However, Malfoy’s were good when it came to pushing things down and not letting it affect them. Draco, especially, had been good at that most of his life.
years to apply as well.” Weasley was excitedly showing The Prophet up into Draco’s face, which appeared to be a habit of his.
“I… about the… the manor-“ Draco stopped short when he felt a warm hand on his cheek, his eyes widen as they darted up to look at Luna.
He pinched them slightly, making Draco gasp. “Fuck…” Harry all but whispered, making Draco think he might’ve fucked up by being way too sensitive. He probably turned him off completely by it.
“Can I?” Harry looked up through black strands of hair and it sent a shiver directly to Draco’s cock.
“Cheers!” She said as she held her glass up to Harry “for the adventures ahead” She cracked a reassuring smile before ending the on-going conversation between the other three friends by telling them they were all wrong, and the only pop artist that meant anything was obviously…
The next day Pansy was (luckily) at Bewitched Dresses, so Draco could mess up as much as he liked without having someone glare at him every single time.
Harry looked at him in surprise, but before he could question his actions, Draco pressed their lips together, as he deepened the kiss, he could feel the saltiness on Harry’s lips.
“With both you and Hermione working on it, I’m sure you’ll be able to figure it out eventually.” Potter said with much more confidence than Draco felt was befitting the situation.
It took a second for Draco to know what to do. Did he want him to just eat directly from his fork while he was holding it? Or should he take the fork and then eat it?
Potter made a surprised “Oh!” as he followed Draco’s pointing and found the ingredient placed neatly in front of him.
“You’re busying yourself with the wrong crowd, Malfoy.” Potter scrutinized him. He was dressed up in Auror attire, making him look much more intimidating than Draco could ever remember.
“That doesn’t mean you don’t deserve help, Malfoy. Although you did some bad things because you were forced and in order to save your family, you still did things that helped us win as well.”
But I'll try to write on this as often as I can. I do have an outline for the next chapters and some are even half written already, so don't worry. I won't leave this story behind ;)
“No, you’re not.” Draco said, raising his hands back to Potter’s chest and pushing him backwards until his legs touched the couch. Potter sat down, pulling Draco with him so he was sat straddling him.
Draco took that as a clue and stood up, straightening his shirt and tie that had become crooked with the sudden rash movements. He moved over to the door where Granger and Potter was still standing. He gives a polite nod towards Granger. “Malfoy.” She mutters back with a short nod and avoiding any eye contact.
Draco thought bitterly, annoyed at himself for not having realised the teasing in Potter’s voice soon enough.
“Also, the reason why they don’t do it, is because the process takes longer, and it can’t really be stored for a longer period. So, instead they deem it more appropriate to just ignore the patient’s discomfort, considering the number of patients who get the side effect is fairly small.”
They were seated in a big sofa in front of a fireplace that lit up the room in a warm orange light. Granger flipped through the potion book Draco had previously used to brew the potion and conjured up a cauldron.
“Hey! Don’t get all sad on me now, you two!” Amelia said patting them both on the back before throwing on her big, compact jacket.
“Sure, sure… Whatever helps you sleep at night. I mean, I wouldn’t judge you though.” Draco frowned at Pansy’s nonchalant voice. “You’re describing how he was during school, but now he’s nothing like what he was back then. If you weren’t aiming for him, who knows, I might’ve been inclined to have a go at him myself.”
Draco got to work on a potion that had a sort of airiness to it. It was quite lightweight and required him to carefully scoop it up and distribute it into the hair evenly.
He wasn’t able to focus on work at all, and it was probably the first time he had been making this many mistakes.
“Great! Now you better try and make sure you don’t stand out. The little scene during breakfast wasn’t a good start, so try to think before you act.” Granger said, before glancing between them.
Potter just looked gobsmacked as he stumbled out of bed and slumped down on the couch, trying to process what had just happened.
The sky lit up instantly. It was difficult to say whether the cheers of the people or the sounds of the fireworks was the loudest, but the colours painting the night sky was the only thing that Draco could focus on.
Just then, a streak of blonde hair whooshed past the stairs. “You want ME to go down there and watch them?” A familiar voice demanded. “I can’t just go in and out of there at will. I’m not a
Draco hesitated, then decided he didn’t have much to lose anymore. “I had a plan which had to be kept secret, but it’s been compromised. I’m trying my best to fix it, but I don’t know if I can.” He tried to be firm, yet vague. “I’m in too deep,” he added dramatically.
As the months went on, Harry became busier and busier with schoolwork, Quidditch, and Dumbledore’s lessons. It seemed that Draco was less available as well, which Harry attributed to his still making a full recovery. He pushed the thought that Draco still had to appear like he was committing murder to Voldemort to the depths of his mind.
Regardless, all Draco could do was bide his time. He didn’t know how, when, or what series of events would have to occur, but...he swore that one day he’d see Harry Potter again.
“Three orgasms within the span of a few hours, goddammit Malfoy,” Harry looked incredulously at Draco, who looked absolutely amazed at this accomplishment.
“Yeah, you’re probably right,” Harry replied, barely listening. Draco had still not given him a glance back.
Grunting furiously as he thought desperately of Draco’s piercing eyes, the soft sound of his moans, the feel of his dick on Harry’s back...Harry’s body stirred.
Hermione is concerned about Harry using Draco’s wand, leading to Ron finding out about Harry and Draco. I try to bring out Ron and Hermione’s characters more in a dialogue between the trio.
“So you’ll do it then, great,” Harry uttered before being engulfed by his own moans. He looked down once more at Draco, now busy with his hands and mouth with a characteristically determined expression which existed solely to pleasure Harry, and felt his body shake.
“You kept count?” Harry couldn’t help himself before regaining his composure. “No, you git. You cursed Katie Bell. What the hell was that about? I thought you changed.” His anger stopped at his throat.
“Does hate towards a wand’s previous owner cause it to malfunction?” Ron jumped in after overhearing Hermionen’s last comment. “We definitely shouldn’t use Bellatrix’s then.” He shot the object a look of disgust.
, Harry stopped himself. In the split second it took him to regain his composure, Draco’s eyes were filled with something other than taunting.
Harry was getting fed up at Draco not talking to him. He thought, after three months of being together nearly every night — his insides would squirm when Draco would say “Can’t tomorrow, day after” — that Draco would loosen up.
Midway through his rant, now panting, Harry caught a glimpse of Draco. Draco was looking at Harry as though he’d never seen anything quite like it before in his life.
“Anyway, thanks for everything, Harry. Plenty of masturbation material for years to come…” Draco made a half-hearted attempt to smile. “Bye then.”
“What’s gotten into you?” Harry retorted, still dumbstruck. “I thought you were the one who wanted to keep our, er,
“Look, Harry,” Draco interrupted. “I’m so sorry I haven’t been in touch sooner. I’ve been so ashamed. Will you...will you please give me a chance to explain? Over coffee, maybe?”
Draco wasn’t all bad inside, even as he was standing here trying to help — Draco still wouldn’t let Harry get the best of him. Rage filled his whole being as he began to lunge —
As he approached Platform 9 ¾ with his family, Harry couldn’t help but smile at how far they’d come. He looked lovingly at James, Albus, and Lily, then raised his eyes to grin at Ginny.
Harry didn’t know what frustrated him most: His anger at Draco, his dick’s betrayal at keeping Draco at the forefront of its pleasure despite this anger, or the rest of his body’s guilt for not actually wanting the pleasure to stop. The truth is, he missed Draco terribly.
The lovers embraced. Draco pushed Harry with the full force of his body against the wall, his hands roaming freely, desperately, taking in every tiny touch so as to savor it. Never mind that they were in mortal danger, that the Dark Lord had probably been summoned, that Harry no doubt had more important things to do. In this moment, Harry was Draco’s.
“Hermione, look, I can explain,” Harry started, looking at his friend’s disapproving face. “We were hooking up, yes, but it’s over now. I was right. He was up to something. Voldemort wanted him to kill Dumbledore. He…”
Katie nodded absentmindedly and returned to her seat. Draco sighed with relief and followed. Catching Harry’s eye on his way out, he felt courageous for what he had just done.
“I can’t lie to him,” Draco finished, relief coursing through his body. “That’s why I haven’t stopped to chat, if you haven’t noticed. It’s too dangerous.”
But Draco took his merry time. Slapping Harry’s buttcheeks with both hands, he rubbed his moist dick up and down Harry’s backside and pulled Harry’s hair. His hand slid to Harry’s front and stroked him, ever-so-lightly in the way that he knew Harry loved. Draco’s dick was throbbing now, he could not take it for much longer —
“When it comes to you and me, aren’t these things one and the same?” Draco responded, as though reading Harry’s mind.
In that moment, Draco shed all else in Harry’s mind and was, once again, solely an enemy. It was as though the past several months had never happened, and they were now battling out the fight they should’ve — would’ve — had on the Hogwarts Express.
Draco often imagined what his life could’ve been like had his own plan succeeded. Knowing that the Dark Lord had much more pressing matters to attend to than reading Draco’s mind nowadays, Draco allowed his thoughts to wonder. The Draco of the other world would be in danger still, surely, and he would’ve lost a lot of friends...
“Oh Harry, won’t you tell me who you’re seeing? Please? I’m so curious,” Romilda Vane asked him for what he could’ve sworn was the thousandth time.
Harry looked at her imploringly, hoping she would understand without him saying a word. Instead, Harry muttered “I’m fine” before storming off to check the Marauder’s Map again. He was now looking at it every day at dinner — around the time he and Draco used to meet — in addition to before he went to bed. He had been satisfied to see that Draco had not been on the map at seven o’clock every day this week, since it meant that Draco had been desperately waiting for him in the Room. The thought gave Harry a jolting feeling.
“What you can do is make feeble attempts at your mission that you know will fail but will keep Voldemort thinking that you’re trying. Whatever than ‘until’ was in what you said about Dumbledore, that’s when you’ll next see Dumbledore right? When that moment comes, confide in him. Tell him what you’ve told me, and tell him that I trust you. He’ll take care of you, and your family — I promise.”
— holding back tears from his eyes. “You said...you said Ron deserved what he got. I thought...we were friends. I didn’t know...what the spell would do. I’m sorry, but also, you should be sorry too.” It seemed as though Potter had rehearsed these words, as he struggled to get them out.
“Nevermind,” Harry continued. “Go. I don’t want to see your face. GO!” He was positively shaking with rage.
Draco Malfoy had never had a worse summer in his life. On top of being apart from his friends, knowing he’d likely not see Hogwarts for a while, and missing the person he had grown to care about the most, Draco had to deal with Lord Voldemort’s presence in his childhood home.
“The air’s nice today, isn’t it Harry? Maybe we can go for a stroll when we’re done,” Draco suggested one evening.
Upon hearing Hermione’s words, it dawned on Harry that Ron wasn’t the only one having revelations now.
Hours later, Harry stumbled onto the Astronomy Tower with Professor Dumbledore in his arms. It seemed as though a lifetime had passed since he and Draco were headed out for a walk together.
Draco immediately relaxed. Seeing Harry’s face resume the soft expression with which he was so familiar, it took all the strength Draco had left not to kiss Harry, to hold him, to stroke him as though nothing were going on around them. Draco's heart beat rapidly as Harry steadied himself.
“I believe you,” Harry responded, “Though I might change my mind if you fuck up again. Be less stupid, won’t you? Some of us are depending on it.” He felt his mouth and dick twitch simultaneously.
With a look that made Harry weak in the knees, Draco nodded curtly and left without another word. Harry ignored the pulsing going through his body as he turned around to face his friends.
In a magnificent swoop, Draco felt himself grabbed by Harry’s big, strong hands, onto a broomstick behind Harry’s back. Knowing it would be the last chance he’d get, Draco held tightly to Harry’s waist and buried his face into Harry’s neck — soaking in every crevice as though they were the only things that existed in the world.
Harry had never seen Ron in this state before. It had taken him a few moments to realize that Ron had eaten a stupid chocolate Romilda had given Harry, imbued with a fucking love potion. If there were
The fact that Harry Potter was sneaking around nearly every night to meet a secret lover became news soon enough. Harry had been expecting this to come up, and probably earlier, at that — he was, after all, the
“Sorry, Harry, I don’t know anything about Ravenclaw,” Draco answered with a somber expression. “But if you’re looking for something that’s meant to be hidden...I reckon our entire sixth year could be of some inspir—”
“D’you reckon we can get him to let us out?” Ron demanded, his face turning white upon hearing Hermione’s screams.
“Habit,” Draco sighed. He only hoped there would be a next time — If his plan worked, there could be many; if not, well...he didn’t want to think about it.
Panicking, Harry looked around until he located Draco’s dot on the 5th floor, next to...It can’t be…
“Oh my fucking god do NOT stop you fucking FUCK!!!” Harry screamed loudly as he collapsed into a heap of pillows. Seeing his beautiful conquest before him, Draco quickly followed.
Aunt Bella was less than happy with Draco, and she would not so much as glance at him all summer, but Draco assumed his mother had some leverage holding her sister’s tongue...something about Gringotts…
, Draco reminded himself. He had finally gotten Harry to admit it a few weeks back, through ceaseless teasing and the simple tactic of poking him in the ribs.
Harry’s familiar gasp under his touch made Draco shiver. “Ugh, Draco, you have no idea...ah...how long I’ve been...
“OOOHH MY GOODDD!!!” Harry shrieked, his hands clutching Draco’s head, his body throbbing with release. Seeing the desperation and lust on Harry’s face, Draco quickly followed. “FUUUCCKKK,” he yelled as he jerked himself to completion, taking in Harry’s wild features.
Harry’s screams echoed around the Room as he jerked himself to completion, his liquids landing brightly on Draco’s chest. Yet his mission was not complete.
Draco scrunched the letter into a ball and stopped himself from crying. It was nearly seven. He stormed to the Room of Requirement and fucked Harry like he hadn’t ever before, letting his anger and revulsion at his task ahead drive his body to dominate in a way he didn’t know was possible.
With a sigh, he returned to his dormitory and drew his blinds. There, at least, the great Harry Potter was to himself. He grunted and pulled down his pants again, fueling the intense look on Harry’s face when he said he believed him to pull himself to completion.
Somehow, Harry knew just what to do. He craned down and thrust his weight into the boy he had convinced himself he hated for six years, his hands quickening strokes and tuning them to the movement of his hips. A wild drive erupted in Harry, edging him along, growing bolder and braver by the minute.
“But, it’s the first day back,” Hermione commented confusedly. “Even I’m not at the library yet. What’s gotten into...”
The spell had broken. All he wanted to do was hurt Malfoy and wipe that dirty smirk off his stupid face.
“Really, Malfoy? Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom?” Harry could not help himself from storming in. “What if I had decided to show up to the Room today, huh? Think I would’ve forgiven you if you weren’t there, patiently waiting?” He teased. He had already decided that he would cast his anger aside, just for this night, because his body could not take the excruciating pain of not being inside Draco’s for a moment longer.
So, Draco did nothing. Did nothing as Lord Voldemort took his father’s wand and plotted to kill Harry with it, did nothing as snide remarks were made about him babysitting cubs, did nothing as he watched a Hogwarts professor get ruthlessly killed for interviewing for a column. Did
Harry gulped. His heart rate quickened. This look... he thought. He’d seen it before. Just a year ago, Cho had..But...it can’t be. Draco hates me, and I hate him.
There was also the matter that Harry now possessed Draco’s wand. The idea of holding an object of Draco’s would’ve driven Harry wild with lust just a week prior. But now, Harry could not feel much but solemnity. He could not believe that Dobby had died, died to give Harry and his friends their lives...the elf had been such a loyal and good friend…
Mustering an innocent-looking expression on his face, Harry responded lightly, “What d’you mean? Why shouldn’t I use his wand?”
“Harry! Are you okay? You were screaming in your sleep again,” Hermione awakened Harry with alarm in her voice.
“Is that Peeves...Peeves singing...Conan Gray?” Harry demanded, as though Draco he would know the answer.
“Never mind what I want to do,” Harry mustered every ounce of determination he could to resist kissing Draco. “Get us out of here. We need to get Hermione and go.”
Draco looked like he was in tears. “Harry, please, listen to me. I don’t have much time. I didn’t mean for that to happen, for Dumbledore to...I swear I wouldn’t have done it.”
Draco flinched at the use of his master’s name, though he shuddered to think he was answering to such a man — if man were even the right word for it.
Ron raised his eyebrows. “Remembered us, have you?” He retorted. “After not so much as a thank-you card for saving your goddamn life.”
Unable to get rid of his bulging erection without knowing the answer, Harry took out the Marauder’s Map and once again looked for the black dot that belonged to Draco Malfoy. It wasn’t there. “The fucking fuck,” Harry muttered to himself, rolling over to once again channel his anger into a raging orgasm —
Obviously Harry couldn’t have expected Draco to have up-and-joined the resistance. Yet, he did feel an unmistakable twinge of disappointment that Draco was not among those greeting him.
“Same time tomorrow,” Harry replied, his insides still filled with longing. “If I can wait that long,” he muttered to himself as Draco saw himself out.
While the others helped Katie back to the castle, Harry whipped out the map to see where Draco was — outside the Slytherin common room. He headed straight there, without a care for the consequences.
“You always have a choice,” Harry answered, his voice softer now. Stroking Draco’s hair with his hand and looking down at his helpless expression, Harry understood what he had to do.
“Er, no idea,” Draco responded absentmindedly. He only cared that Harry had actually believed him.“The song’s got a point though.” He winked.
As Draco held the snitch up, he couldn’t help but look over at the Gryffindor team. They were flying slowly and headed down to the ground. The best sight of all was Weasley who had just landed on the ground and was stomping towards the locker rooms.
They sat in silence for a moment until the train started speeding up and they were on their way to a final year at Hogwarts.
Pansy regarded him for a moment longer, obviously not convinced but letting it slide regardless. Draco continued tending to his potions, while Pansy started to go through their inventory, jotting down what needed to be refilled.
“Now that makes me wonder if you were knowingly defending my appearance or you forgot that the whole body switching happened.” Potter was grinning at him, and for once Draco didn’t respond as he felt a surge of relief dwell up inside of him.
“I have thought it through” Harry said as he moved towards the empty tables, making sure they looked spot free. “It just… I’m not…” Harry sighed.
Draco leaned back, closing his eyes. His book had been abandoned along the way and now he just felt drained and in need of some sleep. Yet, he could not force away the thoughts that had started occupying his mind from the previous conversation.
“Once you’re back at Hogwarts you’ll be sorted into rooms before the opening ceremony. Try not to be late as house points will still be given or taken depending on your behaviour, you all will as a united house, have the opportunity to win the end of year reward as well.”
“It’s fine. It’s a weird situation after all, so I guess I would’ve wanted to know it all as well, had it been me.” Draco shrugged. He wasn’t about to start a fight over it, and he had also felt a tinge of relief at the fact that Weasley had jumped into action the moment Potter was heckled. He knew Weasley was doing it mostly for Potter, but it felt nice to watch himself be defended by someone other than Pansy and Blaise.
“Yeah, I’m sorry. We just thought it was for the best to keep it secret.” Draco said, feeling a bit regretful as he should’ve known his friends would’ve backed him no matter what. It was good to know nonetheless though.
Almost instantly, Harry had taken Ron to see Slughorn. Then, just as Ron was awaking, just as they were about to share a laugh over the ridiculous occurrence that had befallen them, just as he was about to drink from a bottle Slughorn had poured them…
Harry went wild. “I want you...inside me...NOW,” he demanded as his hips thrust into the air and his dick rose to greet Draco’s. “Fuuuck,” Harry continued as his eyes rolled back into his head.
Harry’s body erupted in flames in a way that had nothing to do with the Fiendfyre. He was so angry, so disgusted at Draco’s betrayal that he could hardly feel happy about the Horcrux being destroyed.
Draco locked eyes with Harry, and, seeing the tender expression on Harry’s face, began to lower his wand.
“Ron nearly died. He’s in the hospital wing. I know it was you,” Harry continued, picking a fight. People up and down the hall had turned to watch.
“I couldn’t, Draco responded, sadness etching into his crystal cut features. “My parents had already arranged my marriage. After everything they’d been through, I just couldn’t…”
Harry watched his enemy-lover-friend-lover-enemy disappear, knowing he might never see Draco again. It took him all his strength not to give Draco one last kiss, but he stopped himself. Watching Draco swagger away, he thought he understood the lyrics after all. This — whatever the fuck it was — he had had with Malfoy...It was certainly one for the books.
Harry wanted with all his being to respond to the familiar call. He could already feel himself getting hard again.
Still, it was a nice mental image to hold onto. Fantasies were a welcome comfort in times like these.
Harry turned from Ron to Hermionen, saw Hermione’s expression, then glanced between his two friends once more. Gulping, he answered Hermione’s look with a curt nod.
Watching Draco get dragged out of the party by Snape of all people, Harry couldn’t help but follow. What were they playing at? Wasn’t Draco on his side now? Was Snape even on his side?
“Oh for heaven’s sake, Harry, won’t you drop it?” Hermione snapped. “You have absolutely no evidence that Malfoy is a Death Eater and you can’t just go sneaking around listening to his conversations. You’ll only get yourself into trouble. Remus said…”
It took a full month for Draco to leave the hospital wing, and he knew where his first stop would have to be. It was 7:45, but Harry was still waiting.
The next several weeks with Draco were among the best they’ve ever had. Harry had to stop himself from grinning at random times of the day, though he was able to focus more on his schoolwork and Dumbledore’s task. Knowing he could help Draco out of his situation was igniting him with a new sense of drive.
Draco acted quickly. He had to find Harry. Sprinting through the castle grounds, he saw that the Dark Mark had been cast.
“Just joking. Joking,” Harry said, seemingly alarmed at Draco’s response. “Sorry, that was in poor taste.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispered as he crashed down into his seat with his head resting in his hands. “I can’t do anything right. I’m nothing compared to you. My own mother can’t help me now.”
Harry, who had just had an intense series of orgasms from Draco’s insanely developed blowjob skills, barely heard him. “Huh? What? Christmas party?”
“Careful, you’ll be late for your party!” Draco interrupted. “Unless you’re up for one last fuck as a warm-up for dear Luna.”
“Potter, what in Merlin’s name are you doing here? Are you following me?” Draco scowled, hiding his wand and hoping beyond hope that Harry didn’t see what he was just doing. He had just been attempting, once again to no avail, to repair the vanishing cabinet.
As the days blurred into weeks, lessons carried on, both Draco and Harry continued their respective secret missions, and each had less time for the other. Soon, their encounters were down to a few times a week. Still, Draco was learning to savor his nights with Harry as the one place he could escape from — well, everything.
Draco shivered obediently under his touch, his body responding in all the right ways. Desperately thrashing against each other, thrusting so vigorously that there were flames between them, the enemy/lovers came in unison — pleasure filling every crevice of their bodies, which, though fully clothed, had never been so vulnerable with each other’s until now.
His voice steadied. “Come here,” said someone in Harry’s head that he did not comprehend as himself. “Sit down. Talk to me.”
“Not a word about this to anybody, Potter,” Draco spluttered, with the all-too-familiar hatred reinstated in his voice.
“Ron, I know it’s a shock that Harry’s bisexual,” Hermione tried. “But that’s hardly the point, is it? He’s still the same person.”
“Who’s there?” He asked, hastily zipping his pants and fixing his hair in the mirror. In the hall outside the restrooms, waiting for the girls’, was Katie Bell. Draco gulped. Now was as good a time as any.
Then, as though attempting to escape the moment, Ron quickly turned to Harry and demanded, “I don’t suppose you’ve talked to Ginny about this? About...Malfoy?” His expression resumed one of distrust.
him. He could even help Harry defeat the Dark Lord, knowing what he knew. And then they could be together, really together…
Chaos ensued. Looking around for a sign of Harry, Draco spotted his lover in a corner below. Harry glared at him with a loathing that had only appeared on his face sarcastically in recent months. Before he could say anything, Draco was swept up into a swarm of Death Eaters.
could he have been so careless? Draco begged himself. He had been there every day at seven on the dot, hoping — uselessly — to see Harry walk through the door.
“Draco, I wish...more than anything to just stay here with you,” Harry said as he pulled on his trousers. “Believe me,” he added upon seeing the incredulous expression on Draco’s face. “But, look, I’ve got to find something to...to defeat Voldemort, and I need your help. You are
Harry reminded himself that Draco hadn’t returned a single one of his owls over the past two decades, but after failing to get Draco out of his mind for three consecutive months, he couldn’t help but think that it might be time to try again.
“Er...yes, sir,” Harry replied. Building up his own courage, he continued, “Sir, I have something to tell you. About Malfoy.”
“Yeah, well, I’m not overly surprised about Weasley’s situation.” Draco sniggered, and Granger seemed to take no offense to it, as she joined in. “Potter though… I remember he always seemed weak in some subjects, but I always thought it was merely because he didn’t care enough to pay attention in class. Can’t believe I was right though. A bit disappointing to know the saviour didn’t lack in that aspect as well.” Draco sighed jokingly. It was fun being able to joke around about the other two with Granger. She seemed to have quite a lot of wit and was surprisingly fun to interact with.
“Yeah, sorry about that…” Harry reached out and touched Draco’s cheek. “This really did it though. I should’ve told you properly to begin with. I’m not even sure why I hesitated. I love you. A lot. And seeing you in danger like this made me realise that despite having thought it would be better for you not to be with me considering what people might think or do towards you, I now know you’re safest with me. We can make it work, as long as we’ve got each other, I’m sure of it now. So, I’m sorry. I should’ve told you my worries and how I felt much sooner.”
It felt like Draco had been thrown into some sort of alternative reality as he never would’ve believed anyone if they told him, he would one day be standing in his own potion shop with Potter situated at a small vintage couch in front of him, agreeing to an offering of tea from his former school rival.
“You alright?” Potter looked like a worried puppy as he stood there, soaked to the bone. His hair full of droplets that continued to fall around him.
“Really?” Potter’s expression seemed to brighten at the words, and Draco was rewarded with a big smile.
“Since he became the potential future husband of my best friend. Now, answer my question.” Pansy said, not letting him off the hook.
“What I’m saying is that I’ll consider your feelings seriously, and I’ll get back to you once I’ve figured out my own feelings.”
Draco shakingly got out of bed, it was difficult to see in the dim light that struggled to shine through the window draperies.
“I was just returning your tracking device.” Draco stuttered out, having to calm his quicken heartbeat.
This time the situation was a bit different though, as it was Potter’s turn to be situated at the floor groaning loudly, while Draco bent over on the couch.
“Ah! I mean, of course you’d be feeling better! Didn’t I tell you I knew how to fix it, honey?” He looked overly proud of himself as relief washed over his face.
“I’ve spent all my years during school trying to pick fights with him and finding out what he was up to, I know better than anyone that he’s a human like the rest. An awkward, oblivious idiot. Also, I’m not in awe!”
Draco learns about Harry’s past, his childhood which was so different from his own. They both allow each other to talk and say what’s on their minds without any judgement. It’s the most calm and peaceful Draco has felt in years. Suddenly he’s able to just talk to someone without fearing what it would mean to tell them even the tiniest bit of detail about himself.
Draco took a deep breath before he opened the door to the bakery. The faint jingle of the doorbell and the sweet scent of newly baked pastries filled the air. He had to admit that he had missed this feeling more than he liked to accept.
“It might not be of much consolation at the moment, but this does help me greatly in understanding the magic that’s keeping you together. I might actually be able to perfect this potion into one that’ll work now that I know what it does in your case.”
“I’ve been busy as of late.” Draco had received a fair share of letters from his mother, but when she had returned to the topic of visiting his father in Azkaban, he hadn’t been able to send her a letter back. She knew how he felt about his father, and she should’ve known better than to ask him about it. “She should rather find a hobby instead of starting to talk about my private life to just about anyone.” Draco said bitterly.
“Even if it was my last resort, I’m not certain I would be able to do that.” Draco said, sighing dramatically. “Anyway, I doubt we’ll be stuck together long enough for it to be an issue.”
“Ah… But he’s good at being considerate… Me on the other hand” Draco didn’t know why, but he was actually feeling surprisingly anxious about not finding the right gift for Harry.
Potter closed the gap between them slowly, pressing his lips to Draco’s with such gentleness that it made Draco dizzy.
“You said you worked as a CEO, huh? Must be a lot of work” Harry said as they were sitting in Harry’s living room. Draco had been working extra hours, and when texting Harry that he wouldn’t make it in time before the bakery closed, Harry had told him to come once he was done and he would make him some dinner.
Draco searched Potter’s face for any hint of untruthfulness but found only a confident smile that seemed to believe his own words.
“I’m still waiting for that moment where you’ll actually do a decent block.” Draco shrugged as he walked towards the Slytherin locker room.
‘Oh god…’ Harry thought to himself. He was starting to find the blonde guy more and more irresistible.
“Second period is about to start, we’ve already missed out on too much, so just go to class and keep a low profile.”
After a little while, Amelia’s boyfriend named Sebastian also showed up, apologizing for being late because of his shift at the hospital.
“I mean, like what Christmas present will you give him? Or is it secret? I know Harry has been pretty busy getting one for you”.
“Time to go home. You’ve been sleeping for far too long already, so I assume you’ll be dealing with Rosie tonight if she has another crying session.”
“What?” Potter turned around his brows knitted together into a frown as he tried to make sense of what Draco was saying.
“Yup, the weather really doesn’t help, most people don’t bother to go out when it’s like this, and it’ll only get worse the next days”. Draco payed for his meal, which consisted of a homemade sandwich and a coffee.
