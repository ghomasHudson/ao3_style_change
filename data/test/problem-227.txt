Soon it was the 16th. Draco had been worrying, gently rubbing at the corners of his wrapped gift, trying not to destroy the paper. Originally, Hermione was just going to put all the presents in a sack and call out names. The eighth years who had badgered people for information had ruined that as most people knew exactly who had them. It was easier to reveal to everyone and hand out the gifts in person.
Theodore took Blaise's face into his hands and kissed him deeply. Draco noticed the faint flush on their faces, though Blaise's was harder to see. He wasn't sure whether it was from the alcohol or the kiss itself. When they finished Blaise's blank expression hadn't changed. Theodore's smirk was still in place as he spoke.
"Nothing's changed for you, has it? You stood and told me we were friends. You made me believe we were friends. That we'd begun to move past the hatred because we were just two boys who were swept up into opposite sides of a war that neither of us wanted to be part of," Draco felt the tears building but he couldn't stop. "I'll always be a Death Eater to you. I'll always be Malfoy. Merry fucking Christmas, Potter."
Draco lifted himself away from the pillow and nodded before promptly shoving his face back into said pillow and screaming again. He felt the bed dip next to him, nearly jumping out of skin when a warm hand was tentatively placed on his back. It wasn't long until the hand was rubbing small circles at the bottom of his spine.
Harry looked up, looking Draco dead in the eyes. And
"Takes some of the magic out of it, I think," Harry laughed. "Ironically."
"As long as blast is just an expression and not Seamus blowing things up, it does sound fun," Draco smiled.
It seemed as though Harry was well prepared with a dare: "I dare you to run around in
The longer Draco stayed in the bath the sadder he got. The lavender filled his senses and he missed his mother terribly. Her portrait wasn't the same thing as being enveloped in one of her hugs. He escaped and wrapped himself in the fluffy towel. He slowly sank to the floor, leaning against the tub. He tried to slow his breathing slight to avoid crying but he just created an opening for the sobs to fill his lungs. He would be ashamed to say he spent around a half hour sat in that position, crying.
The cliche truth or dare bonding chapter, with added twists.
They refused the offer of an escort and picked up easy conversation as they made their way through the familiar corridors. It wasn't long before they arrived, noticing that they were the last of the eighth years to arrive. Harry and Hermione waved, Draco smiled in return before they turned back to Dean and Seamus. Neville was talking to a couple of Hufflepuff students and the few Ravenclaws kept to themselves. All conversation hushed the moment McGonagall reached the podium.
"Breakfast is over in a half hour," he whispered, trying his best not to wake Seamus.
"It's still two weeks away, Dray," he could see the pity written on Blaise's face.
As classes did not start for a couple of days people were perfectly happy with the suggestion. Draco had an itching feeling he would be in for a long night.
Draco had not returned for his seventh year as his father wanted him by his side. If he had gone back life would've been better, he would've had his friends.
. With his father gone he was exploring who he was outside of his family name.
In the aftermath, the quiet and the peace, Draco discovers something new about Harry.
"Theodore, not Theo. Dare."
Draco was still worrying about his friend when they reached the pub. Blaise led him to a booth towards the back before leaving Draco to head up to the bar. He returned with five butterbeers balanced carefully on a tray.
"Lucious, he did the right thing. Leave the poor boy be," his mother's hold on him tightened even further.
"I didn't mean to. Once I started I couldn't stop. She's infuriating. I don't even know what exactly it is I'm supposed to have done for her to hate me."
Draco watched as a few students approached McGonagall, Harry included. Draco wished to ask him about it but knew that Ginny would be looking for Harry. It would have to wait until they had all settled in for the evening. Draco himself had owled McGonagall prior to returning about his subject changes. He knew everything had been arranged for him.
"Stop moping," Blaise sighed, swinging an arm across Draco's shoulders.
The weekend came up sooner than Draco thought. It was probably finishing his Winter exams that helped speed through the rest of the week. Either that or the Harry spiral he found himself in. It was like sixth year all over again, except better or worse. Draco couldn't decide. It was far more positive than the Harry spiral he'd had previously. Though the two had Harry going to the ends of the earth to avoid Draco in common.
Draco spent many hours reading up on Charms, asking McGonagall for help when he reached an impasse. He'd spent many hours perfecting the charm on practice pictures to make sure they moved as smoothly as a regular wizard picture. On top of his lessons and Winter reading he was incredibly drained and it hadn't gone unnoticed by his friends. Blaise and Pansy would tease him when they found him asleep at the desk but still wrapped him in a blanket or made sure he got to bed at a reasonable hour. Theodore would laugh whenever he came across Draco hunched over the pictures but would leave him a warm drink and some food from the kitchens. Draco was very grateful for his friends. He would've reached a maximum a few days before the gift exchange if it wasn't for them.
"How dare you disrespect the Dark Lord like that? How dare you disrespect me?!" He had screeched. His voice carried to the students and teachers, a few turning and giving him pitying glances.
"I'm not angry," she swivelled her head back to her boyfriend. "I have you to myself Thursday's after lunch now."
"Sounds about right from what I've heard about Sirius. Look, I didn't mean to downplay your connection to these, I just...well, I didn't think you had any connection."
"I don't mind staying here. It won't be the first time."
Draco sat for a few moments, staring in shock. He pushed his plate away and stood, moving his chair far more quietly than George had.
Blaise sucked his teeth, crossed his arms and gave Draco a slow nod. He knew Draco valued the peace found at Hogwarts on Christmas Day and knew that Draco would not change his mind. He stared at Draco for a second before showing him the piece of paper with 'Hermione Granger' written in neat cursive.
Blaise laughed filling his arms with as much as possible, then filling Draco's once the space had run out. Draco was rather happy that Blaise paid, he didn't want to know how many galleon's were spent on sweets that would be lucky to last the fortnight.
"Guess we're heading to the Muggle City this weekend," Draco smiled.
as a further precaution to not wake the couple. Blaise lay next to him, curling into his side.
The tutoring session had continued. Neither mentioned Ginny's name and Harry hadn't brought up the altercation. Draco knew it would boil over soon, Ginny seemed to be bottling her anger up. Theodore and Pansy had both mentioned that even Harry was walking on eggshells around her, pissing her off more than usual.
Harry continued laughing as Draco made himself more comfortable in the pillow pile. He really did feel like a cat, aching to go to sleep in the warmth of the fireside.
"Are you alright?"
"Of course, Mr Potter."
"Alex!" George embraced him in a hug. "Thanks for keeping an eye on him for me."
Hermione read over the question before going back to reading over his previous work. She motioned for Draco to sit and got right to explaining. She used textbooks and diagrams to help, which was a great help visually but Draco felt as though he was being overloaded with extra, unnecessary information. They ended up spending the majority of the three hours going over the question, double and triple checking everything. He dropped off the parchment on the way to dinner.
When they reached the tower Harry produced a blanket and some cushions for them. He wouldn't answer any of Draco's questions on where they had come from, or if he'd been carrying them somehow for the walk there. Harry sent him a playful glare and Draco let up the questioning to open the shutters while Harry set up their space. They had spent an hour up there and Draco had moved his train of thought from the necessary constellations for the lesson to just about every constellation he could point out and tell Harry about.
"That's surprising. I thought you would've snatched that open spot, like Ron," Blaise admitted.
"I though we were just doing truths," Blaise winced.
"I feel horrible," Harry whispered, finally breaking the silence.
"You spend all your free time with Malfoy instead of me," she was bawling at this stage.
Harry did something unexpected. He gave Draco a brief hug, before saying goodbye to continue his original mission of finding Dean. Draco sat in shock. Having Harry's hand on his back when he was more focused on his pillow was one thing, but being alert during the hug was another. He couldn't remember hugging anyone but George, Blaise, Pansy and his mother. Though Pansy's were one-sided. He liked Harry's hug, he wanted more. The feeling started to bubble in his stomach. He did not want to deal with it and tried to ignore it and shove it down. He knew exactly what the feeling was and he absolutely could not be feeling it for Harry Potter.
"It isn't some big realisation. I've known exactly what I felt about him ever since he started visiting over the summer. The butterflies in my stomach were the biggest indicator."
The other four laughed at Blaise's comment. It wasn't the social life that Draco was worried about, in fact he would much prefer it if he did have the time. He was worried about the other students. He would absolutely hex anyone who gave him trouble, so long as it was self defence. He just wanted to avoid the trouble and he thought that throwing himself into his schoolwork would work well, among distracting him from other things.
on your head."
"Avada Kedavra!"
Hermione shook her head in disagreement. Draco kept his eyes cast down on his plate of food. He had been hoping to get through dinner without Ginny glaring at him. He'd been fairly successful since term began, with a few nights she'd glared him out of his appetite. He'd never sat exactly opposite her and even after a couple of months she was
"So why don't you count?"
"If I wanted you dead I would've abandoned you in the Room of Requirement," Potter scoffed. "Besides I made a promise to your mother. I intend to keep it."
"Well, we have the same timetable. Though I was not allowed to take Muggle Studies and plants don't really like me," Harry laughed.
The group burst into laughter, whether they knew about it or not. In this act it seemed as though much of the tension dissipated. The eighth years grew more comfortable with each other rather easily. It only took a few more simple rounds - during which they had found out about Hermione and Ron's first kiss in detail, Harry and Ginny's first time in less detail and they watched Neville place his hand into the fire to see if it would burn (it did, but nowhere near nonmagical fire would've) - before they had grown comfortable to move into a more risqué set of questions and dares. This also could've had a lot more to do with the amount of firewhiskey that had been consumed. Draco was only tipsy, as were a few others. However most people had been taking shots out of boredom and were teetering on the edge of too far gone.
The house elves pottered about gathering the ingredients for what Draco imagined to be exactly enough to two bowls of soup. The smell of the bread baking finally hit him and made his stomach rumble loudly. Harry pulled up a seat next to him, giving Draco a tired smile.
"I know," Blaise dropped his voice and the smile disappeared. He took a long swig of the drink. "Look, I'm probably not okay. I'll talk to you about it when we can get some privacy and we won't be interrupted by...Neville! We're over here."
"Draco!" Blaise smirked, emerging from the boys dormitories. "This is a surprise, I didn't think we'd be seeing you. You look healthier than when I saw you last. Weasley's been treating you well then?"
"No bloody reason?! He's killed people Harry. He has the dark mark. He's a Death Eater. It's his fault Fred is dead, it's his fault half the people who died are dead," another scoff. "He gets to come back though. Sauntering like he's still the precious prince of Hogwarts and can do no wrong."
"Did you know that Draco has decided to effectively kill himself by doing two years worth of work in one," Blaise smirked. Draco immediately shot him a glare across the table. So much for staying away from life after Hogwarts.
"But that's a Monday," Ginny cried.
"I was looking for Dean, sorry," Harry smiled, sheepishly. "Are you alright?"
"Draco?" a soft knock. "Food's done. Come down when you're ready."
"I hadn't really made it past the first page. At least this will force me into reading it."
"Sort of. I always wondered where my name came from. Father always hated it but Mother bought me a star chart when I was about 6. It's still in the manor somewhere, I think. From then on I was hooked. It was my own hobby that Father hadn't forced me into. It was also a link to Mother's family rather than his," Draco sighed, wistfully. "I learnt everything I could about. I still dream about being amongst the stars, escaping the world below."
Draco knew that Crabbe wouldn't be returning. After Goyle, well, that left Pansy. Despite her very obvious feelings for him they'd been the closest pair of the group. Once he came out to her the advances stopped, Pansy was always respectful of his boundaries. She knew everything about him, and he about her. Draco was a little lost without her.
my free time. Honestly, you're probably the only person who still has a problem with him," Harry stated bluntly. Wrong move, Draco thought.
"Reflexes," Harry muttered.
Draco knew it would take Harry some time to come to him. The latter was still processing the events of the afternoon. Harry did not turn up for help until nearly an hour later, his own make-shift bandages wrapped haphazardly around his hands. He sat at the end of Draco's bed, resting his hands palms up on his thighs. Draco made quick work of it, practice with the boys after Quidditch practice and their scrapes had helped his skills. Neville's growing collection of cuts and bruises from Herbology were a welcome challenge too. It took him no time at all to magically clean the slashes and re-bandage them by hand. They sat in silence for a while after it was done. Draco desperately wanted to talk to Harry but didn't want to scare him away.
"Ta, mate. A hungry Seamus blows more things up than a normal Seamus," Dean laughed quietly, already gently nudging his boyfriend.
The hall fell into silence as McGonagall took the podium. It was amusing how much power and respect she had, without really knowing. She welcomed all the students back and mentioned how there would be a further delay in the eighth years schedule. They would now be starting on Monday, which gave them another three days off. McGonagall did not explain why that change was. She did however say that she hoped they use the time to further bond and to get rid of any negative feelings towards each other. Draco held back a laugh, if the pointed look to the table - mostly at Seamus specifically - was anything to go by she knew exactly what a shit show their bonding night had been. It caused a few sniggers from the table. Even if the students weren't there to witness it everyone had now been told about Seamus' escapade through the castle.
"I didn't realise," Draco felt sad. Someone had been looking out for him after all.
Draco got caught in a similar self-deprecation and identity questioning spiral that he had in sixth year. Only this time he was alone. He didn't pay attention to his surroundings. He went through the motions necessary for survival. He really should've questioned where exactly the meals he was eating had been coming from. He hadn't cooked, he hadn't left the manor to get food. He hadn't even bathed. He was unknowingly ignoring the army of owls that had taken residence in the garden. He was numb.
"What does everyone want to do after Hogwarts then?" Neville asked the dreaded question. "I fancy being a professor myself."
"OK. Goodnight, Draco."
"Perfectly fine," Draco mumble into the pillow, unsure of whether Harry understood.
"Wait..."
"You know, all those rounds and I don't think Theo here had a go. Truth or dare?"
"That's the only free time I have and I need his help with Muggle Studies," Draco all but pouted.
"I don't suppose I could trouble you for some of that soup I saw at dinner, could I?" He asked as politely as he could.
"You'd already started."
"You could enchant the book," Draco smiled, glad to see Harry taking some time for himself rather than forcing his extroverted nature that wasn't as bright as it had been.
"Hmm," Draco answered, nonchalantly. "Blaise has mentioned that in the past. It's true. Though I expect he did not mean it to be a compliment."
"We both know you're doing as good as usual in Potions and Charms. Neville says Herbology isn't causing you any problems. You should be teaching Astronomy. So it's gotta be Muggle Studies," Harry's voice was quiet. "I could tutor you. If you would be willing to tutor me in Astronomy?"
Blaise groaned and finished his drink. That seemed to be the end of the conversation but it was the most Draco had heard from Blaise about the topic so he didn't want to push it. The two headed back to Hogwarts and quickly hid their haul form prying eyes. A lot of the eighth years were asking around, trying to discover who had who and what people were getting. Draco would absolutely not risk his gift getting to Harry before it was even done. If it could be done.
"Draco," Blaise took his arm off Draco's shoulders, only to hold his hands tightly instead. "Look. It's hard when the people you care about start avoiding you. I'll bet you ten galleons it isn't your fault, though."
"Because of him?!"
"Technically I'll still be under Auror watch and the Ministry can't complain."
Draco starts to feel suffocated and reconsiders his plans.
"I'll keep that in mind. I'd rather get the job on my own merit, though," Draco fiddled with his fingers. "Either way I'm happy to keep working with George if it all goes tits up?"
"Yeah, it sucks. Especially if he's avoiding you. How about we go to a Muggle pub after shopping and I'll fill you in on my pathetic love life to take your mind off your own?"
"Draco I-still-don't-know-your-middle-name Malfoy! How
"I'm bisexual, by the way," he smiled.
the new Quidditch captain. It was perfectly fine for you to practice on Thursday afternoons when everyone is available," Harry looked angry. " Stop being petty and go back to the original schedule. You have me Monday afternoons and evening's completely."
"We're perfectly fine at the moment, Luna. Though I will come to you if anything changes," Draco smiled warmly at the blonde girl.
"Shouldn't be. Let me help."
"I'm gay," the words had come out on their own. Draco didn't know why he'd admitted it. Maybe he could put that down to his own alcohol consumption. Harry had just come out to him and they were friends. Draco trusted him.
"McGonagall has arranged it all. I'll be doing Charms with her as one to one classes, I'm sitting in on the sixth and seventh year classes for Muggle Studies. Other than that, I'll be attending seventh year classes just like the rest of you."
"That's the thing. I feel horrible because I
"The way I see it we've both lost the person we loved the most. We have that in common," George said, tears welling in his eyes. "That person tried to protect you from your father. She did her best but you were still forced into what you did. Anyone with half a brain could see how much it destroyed you from the inside out. You deserve that second chance, Draco."
"No," Harry tried to remove his hands, now fully aware of the blood. "Wouldn't want to be a bother. 'sides I've already got most of it."
"This is supposed to be breakfast tomorrow, Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter. I don't think they'll notice two slices missing. You two are some of the few students who eat the crusts," she smiled brightly before heading back to work.
"You're going to regret that. What can I get the great Chosen One to do? Harry Potter I dare you to..."
"Don't stay around for my sake," George had smiled after one such afternoon. "Don't get me wrong I appreciate the help but I know you're itching to go back."
After the war, a lot of things in Draco's life are turned upside down.
"It's not that. Really, I'm worried they won't let me back in. Even if they did, my name will hardly be getting me a foot in the door," Draco let out a sad laugh. "In fact it'll probably be getting me kicked out of the door."
It felt as though Draco had overstepped his boundaries as nothing more was said. He was worried when Harry just upped and left, whispering a thank you as he exited the door. So low that Draco almost missed it. It sent another spark of relief through Draco. Things were patchy but he chalked it up to Harry still coming to terms with the fall out of his relationship. The two would be ok. Draco didn't know what to do with the lighter feeling of warmth in his stomach. Harry had been very much not attainable and Draco had become particularly skilled in pushing the growing feelings down. The break up changed things. Only, Draco wasn't sure if it was what he wanted.
"Yes he has. Gave me a place to sleep, eat and work. He sort of became my big brother."
There had been a lot of kissing dares, but other than when Harry had kissed everyone Blaise and Theodore hadn't been kissed. Draco thought they had been lucky, he'd ended up making out with Neville and kissing a tipsy Hermione. Both with rules that it was never to be mentioned. Draco looked at the two of his best friends. Blaise had dropped his cool composure once more, though he was trying to keep his face blank. Draco couldn't tell what he was thinking. Theodore was confident, ready to rise to the challenge. This was such a change from the boy they had known before the war, Draco could not guess the outcome.
"That's brilliant, Mione. Um, honestly I'm not sure what I'll do. Definitely not an auror," Harry sighed, smiling bitterly into his empty glass.
"Yeah?"
"Hey," Draco whispered, kneeling down and gently taking Harry's hands into his own. "You know there's spells for this?"
Draco knew he had to withdraw here, this was his out. Harry needed the space. So he simply smiled, released Harry's hands and said: "Let me fix your hands up once you're done."
Ginny had been sending Draco what she believed to be secretive glares, but they hadn't gone unnoticed. Harry would elbow her, smiling at Draco apologetically whenever he noticed. Hermione had used a few choice words and the glares almost seemed to diminish. Hermione had also distracted Draco with pleasant conversation. The two got along much more than Draco would've ever imagined, but he supposed with the two being as studious as they were they had more in common than they initially thought. They had swapped many book recommendations over the summer - Muggle and Wizard author's alike - and were the only two aware of the subjects they had chosen to return to. Hermione had said she felt slightly guilty over the relief that Ron would not be returning, though Draco ensured her that she had no reason to be. Ron had pestered Hermione in previous years for help with homework, that was no secret. At least now she would be able to completely focus on her own.
"Are those Harry's? We'll just bring these up for him," Dean quickly excused the three, not wanting to intrude or question what was making the Slytherin's laugh so much.
He had lost his friends who had set off immediately to inspect their new living space and resigned to glumly following the ones who wanted to avoid him most.
"So are you, 'Mione. I thought you might get along with it swimmingly."
As George opened the door he revealed an Auror. He looked younger than the ones Draco had seen the most of, but he was familiar. Draco could've sworn he remembered the green eyes staring into his, full of concern. And he was sure that the brown hair had been a fixture in the kitchen and drawing room though it had no need to be.
"I'm glad you're getting back to your old self."
"Sorry, Gin. We lost track of time at the pub."
"You haven't realised yet?"
"Ideally the Minister for Magic. They could use a muggle-born voice of authority," Hermione smiled. "Though a Curse Breaker is something I've been toying with."
George was plating up when he walked down into the dining room. It looked like a hearty stew with some dumplings. Heavier than anything he'd eaten since Hogwarts. Draco wondered whether George had brought the ingredients with him. He certainly did not get them from the empty pantry. He took his seat and inhaled deeply. The food smelled delicious but there was another scent weaving in with the stews.
"That's such a good job, Draco. I'm sure you'd be fantastic," Harry was the quickest to recover. "If they don't let you in give me a call. I'm sure a recommendation from the Chosen One will change their minds."
Draco thought Hermione should've mentioned it wasn't a particularly large group on the Hogsmeade excursion. In fact Draco wasn't sure it could even be classed as a group at just himself, Hermione, Blaise, Neville and Harry. Nobody really needed to go to every shop so the plan was to split up and then meet at The Three Broomsticks for a late lunch. Despite Blaise not needing the things Draco did, he had stuck to the latter's side all day. Even when Draco spent nearly two hours in Tomes and Scrolls, finding the books he needed rather quickly but stopping to browse for the ones he wanted to read on Hermione's recommendations. Blaise finally grew tired and dragged Draco into Honeydukes to stock up on the two's secret sweets supply, that wasn't so secret.
Harry was proving more difficult to buy for than Draco had initially worried about. He was trying to follow Hermione's advice but nothing held up to his - admittedly high - standards. Blaise spotted the nearest pub and grabbed Draco's wrist pulling him past a photography store. The cogs in Draco's brain started to turn as he found the perfect gift for Harry. It would be something that would last a lifetime. Draco knew there'd be a lot of work to put in on his end but it was the most meaningful thing Draco had ever done for anyone. Blaise waited for him outside the shop. He seemed a little surprised at Draco's purchase but didn't say anything about it.
"Perfect! We'll do an hour and a quarter of Muggle Studies and an hour and a quarter of Astronomy, with a half hour break in between," Harry decided. "We'll make this work, I'm sure."
"Your girlfriend was glaring at me the whole time," Draco shrugged. "Didn't exactly feel like being watched intently while I ate. What's your excuse?"
"Talk to me," he wrapped an arm around Blaise.
"We have a free day today and we don't need permission slips for Hogsmeade either. A group of us were going to go if you wanted to join, Draco?" Hermione pulled his plate away to ensure she had his full attention.
They apparated to an alley just outside of the Muggle city. Draco had thought Blaise was lucky in drawing Hermione. She was fairly easy to buy for, always vying for a new book or two. Sure enough Blaise had immediately located the nearest bookshop and exited with two first editions in hand. There had been a set price limit but it was a task to convert galleons to Muggle money. In any case Draco had a suspicion that the first edition about something to do with Muggle football wouldn't be wrapped up nicely, waiting for Hermione on the 16th.
"I think you should let Harry go through that. We can grab a few of the plainer things and get you your own clothes in the new year?" George entered the bedroom.
Draco sighed, bidding Theodore good night before retreating to his room. He made sure to shoo Theodore away when he had come to check Draco's progress. Which, admittedly, was none. Blaise wouldn't let Draco in if he even suspected Theodore was lurking somewhere. He knocked gently on the door, announcing it was just him. Draco heard a spell being whispered before the door opened, revealing a very tired and tipsy Blaise. Dean and Seamus were in Dean's bed, sleeping soundly from what Draco could tell, so he led Blaise to his own bed as quietly as possible. He made spae for the two of them to lie and cast
Draco nodded. They sat in a comfortable silence until the house elves brought them the soup, along with a slice of the homemade bread Draco had been smelling. It all looked delicious. Winky held a finger over her mouth and winked at the two boys.
Finally becoming more aware of the world around him Draco sluggishly walked to the front door. Unaware but frankly unbothered about his possible appearance he used what little strength he had to open the door. He was well aware of how heavy his body felt to move.
Once they arrived Ginny was sat with Harry yet again. This time he did not have an escape as Hermione pulled him to sit next to her, immediately opposite the ginger she-devil.
"Make that two bowls, Winky, if you could?" a familiar voice chimed in.
"I'd hardly call Thursday afternoons
"Yeah, me too," Draco whispered almost inaudibly.
Ginny went for him over the table, red in the face. Harry held her back by her waist but he was smiling. Draco had worried he'd gone too far. He nodded at the door with his head, motioning that it was probably best if Draco left. Ginny had slunk back into her seat so Draco deemed it safe for him to leave without being chased. As he stood up he felt a sharp pain in his chin, Ginny smirking instead of sulking.
Harry was right about one thing. Draco did not care about himself. He never had beyond the drive to stay alive. For the first sixteen years of his life, he'd been shaped to become a Death Eater. It's all he had known. Now he was marked with the Dark Mark permanently he wondered if it was all he would ever be. He couldn't be like Harry. Someone who stayed strong despite the pressures mounting on them. He wasn't built for it. Sixth year had been hell. Draco had been left exhausted by his inner conflict and had spent most of the year trying to overcome one illness or another. Blaise had tied him to the bed, once. He'd forced countless strengths of dreamless sleep draughts down Draco's throat and then stayed awake all night, just to ensure Draco slept well enough. His friends were inherently good people. Draco was not. All he'd known was how to be harsh and cruel, that the only person he could rely on was himself. He knew the last part wasn't true anymore. He didn't think he could change the first part. He was trying and he thought that he had been successful but it became painfully apparent that Draco was misled.
Draco must've expressed more confusion than he wanted because it wasn't long until Harry was justifying himself.
"I'll be honest, I'm happy you're practicing self-care."
"I've been alone my whole life," there it was. The talk. "It doesn't matter any more now than it has before."
"I know you've probably had this thought but you need to talk to him, B."
"Alex?"
Seamus nodded against Dean's chest, the latter bidding everyone good night as they left. This prompted a few others to do the same. Even though there weren't any classes the following day, it was getting late. A lot of the students were too drunk to be coherent anyway. Soon it was just Theodore, Blaise, Harry and Draco. They'd happened to be the most sober in the group. Draco had been enjoying himself too. The other eighth year's made bonding incredibly easy.
"Yeah well, I figured we know each other well enough, so..."
Draco had hidden in the alcove behind one of the bookcases. It was a surprise that they hadn't spotted him yet. He had to cover his mouth with his hand to hold back the gasp that bubbled up. He did not want to be on the receiving end of Ginny's wrath. He pulled himself in tighter, he could no longer see the pair he could only hear them.
"I'll let myself in, then," George turned, shutting the door. "And I'll pick all these up for you to read later."
"You just broke up with your girlfriend."
"Kiss everyone in this circle!" Pansy shouted.
Dean laughed, the two heading down to the common room together. Draco soon found himself sitting in a circle which spread over the sofas, armchairs and floor. It seemed that a game was being decided upon. Never have I ever being an option, as was truth or dare. It just happened that no-one really wanted to participate in either while sober.
"I am not. The only thing that's changed is that I'm doing Muggle Studies instead of DADA. Potions, Herbology, Charms and Astronomy won't be any different," Draco huffed.
"You don't have to say anything, really," Harry smiled again, standing up to leave.
"No!" It came out in a roar, guttural and full of pain. He dropped down, crying over her body. Ready to accept his life's end all over again as his father readied another.
"Oh, God."
Pansy knew everything about him, there was only one option: "Dare."
"Harry?"
. He'd seen it enough from his father. He wasn't good enough. He'd done something wrong. It was a look full of anger and disappointment. Draco didn't need a mirror to know his eyes probably held the same fear they had whenever his father looked at him like that growing up.
I am really sorry I've been gone so long - I've had uni work and job for a bit as an excuse before everything. I'm working on getting this done for you guys, I appreciate you all, thank you all so much for reading the story so far.
"Plus, you'll have far more free time for a social life," Blaise butted back into the conversation.
"I," Draco took a calming breath in, a trick he'd been doing a lot over the past weeks. "I really like him, Blaise. I'm just trying to decide whether it's just a stronger admiration for someone unattainable than I had before or..."
"You know, you really do remind me of a cat," Harry laughed, poking Draco's leg with his foot.
"I liked it," Blaise whispered, brokenly. "It was just a dare but he kissed me and I liked it, Dray. I want him to do it again."
"I don't know what to make of it, Dray. Sometimes I think it's because he likes me in the same way," Blaise had his head in his hands. "Then I hear him make a comment about a girl or how he's drained from social interaction. I just don't know."
Draco nodded his agreement and George left rather briskly. Draco couldn't remember the last time he'd even washed his face. Let alone bathing or showering. His hair must be in the state of greasy, tangled curls. As he undressed he caught a scent radiating off of him and he was surprised that George came within 5 foot of him. He sighed as he entered the tub and he slowly sank into the familiar comfort of a warm, lavender bath. The scent was making him slightly drowsy but it smelled like his mother so he revelled in it. He spent the first ten minutes dipping completely under the water before resurfacing for air. It was something he'd done as a child. He decided it would be better if he did scrub away the scent that lingered and wash his hair.
"It's not right though, we've been together sort of for just over a year. Officially it's only a few months."
He hated it, who he'd become. Why didn't Harry see? That's what he deserved. Lying on the bathroom floor, split apart and bleeding out. He sometimes wished that Snape hadn't saved him. He wished he died. If he had everything that had happened after wouldn't have happened. He didn't want kill Dumbledore, he didn't want to kill anyone. He was selfish though, Draco put his own life above others. He agreed with his father, he was truly shameful and pathetic.
George laughed, leading Draco gently to the upper wing. George had successfully managed to navigate his way to the upper wing and Draco's bedroom. He didn't know how George got him there, nor did he care. He just watched in silence as George drew him the promised bath and added the lavender bath salts Draco had stolen from his mother months before.
They ate their food in silence, sitting in the warm glow of the fire. A house elf appeared to retrieve their plates but also brought them some chocolate cake straight from the kitchens.
There was firewhiskey and some cakes dotted around the desks in the common room. Hermione had made it into a whole event. Draco had to admit it was pleasant all lower years had been banned from the evening. There wouldn't be anyone invading the peace f the moment. People were hugging and chatting with everyone as they were given gifts over the course of the evening. Hermione was overjoyed as she opened the first edition, but still scolded Blaise as it was at least 10 galleons over budget. Blaise claimed that he got the conversions wrong and managed to get away with it.
"You are such a prat, Harry Potter!"
Draco looked at the familiar scratchy handwriting spelling out 'Harry Potter'. It leered at him, mockingly. What could The Chosen One possibly want? He could get anything from anybody with the flick of his wrist. He felt in that moment that he truly didn't know anything about Harry.
Draco had hugged George tightly, almost making up for the years he hadn't had this in his life. Someone to depend on, someone who had his back completely. More importantly someone that Draco could be the same for.
I'd like to explain. I didn't exactly lose interest in writing this, trust me I'm still full of ideas for it. I think it's because I left such a large gap between updates. My writing style and preferences have changed, as has some of the plot I mapped out for this work. I struggled to continue to write parts that I had already begun because there was such a change and that's where I lost myself with this work a bit.
Once he arrived at the kitchens he found the house elves split into two groups, one cleaning up from the days meals and the others starting the preparations for breakfast the next day. He hopped up to sit on the counter, only to have a house elf hit his foot and motion for him to get down. Draco complied and pulled a seat up to the counter instead.
"Always in a better mood when there's sweets and sugar, Dray."
"I'm not a legal guardian, mate. I mean I knew you're eighteen but still. It doesn't matter anyway cause I have found a loophole."
"I deserve it," Draco whispered, brokenly.
Theodore Nott had wormed his way into their little group, no-one was quite sure how or when but he'd brightened up their lives. He made them feel as though they were teenagers, there was no war when he spoke. He was usually quiet and shy, though Draco presumed his father being in Azkaban would've had a large impact on how Theodore behaved.
"Anytime, B. Feel better ok?"
"No, I asked," Harry inhaled sharply. "Sometimes I worry that I'm only still with Ginny because it's easy and people expect it. I've not been with anyone else properly, though. I don't think I love her in the same way I did."
"They'll be coming to take him to Azkaban," he said gently.
"Draco, darling, you overreact. Truth or dare?"
Once they arrived he was shocked at the common room. It looked as cosy as the Hufflepuff's but all of the houses banners were displayed. While the dorms were still split by gender they had been arranged so that students from houses mixed with others. He was sharing with Blaise and Dean. Theodore, Neville, Harry and Seamus would be sharing the room opposite. Though he wasn't sure whether Dean and Seamus would stick to that arrangement or find ways to share a room.
"Of course it's about him. When hasn't it been about him?" Draco scoffed.
"The Burrow is too Fred like. So we're gonna go to ours. We'll eat all the food Mum's stocked our fridge with, watch crappy Christmas telly, maybe get a bit shitfaced and then open presents."
Harry shrugged and lay back on the blanket. Draco joined him, his head reeling with thoughts on what Harry had said. He'd never thought he'd be having deep conversations with Harry Potter. Times had changed. They were on their way to being close friends if they weren't there already. The only thing stopping them from being better friends was Ginny practically hissing at Draco any time he got anywhere near Harry. The other Weasley's had gotten used to Draco's presence. Charlie and Bill had gone to the effort of befriending him. He didn't understand why Ginny still hated him with a passion.
"Doesn't matter now. You promised me dinner, so I'm stealing you," she grabbed his wrist and started to drag him down the corridor. "Malfoy, my brother sent you a howler. It's on the table."
Upon their arrival at the pub they bought a drink and fairly easily found a table away from other people. Not that anyone in here would know who they were talking about but Draco wanted to make sure Blaise was comfortable.
George presented him with a change of clothes and a fluffy towel.
Harry held up his bread to Draco. Quickly catching on Draco lifted his own slice up so that they could 'cheers'. Draco selfishly wished that they could have more nights like this one. Nights where they were just two boys who hadn't been able to eat dinner. No problems or pressures looming over them because of their surnames. Just two teenagers sat in the warm, welcoming kitchens. Eating in peace.
Blaise and Dean had already arrived and chosen their beds. Draco didn't mind particularly, he was furthest from the door, which was his preference. He was beginning to think Blaise had purposefully left it for him. He could hear the chaos and chatter starting up in the common room but chose to unpack sooner rather than later. Something Blaise and Dean had forgone, judging by the closed trunks on their beds. He got so lost in himself he did not notice Dean approaching until he was immediately in front of him. Draco jumped back.
"Sorry, Headmistress McGonagall would like all eighth years in the Great Hall. Your bags have already been dealt with.
"I know it's something to do with promising, so how about we just get started on that firewhiskey?"
"I see no difference."
It wasn't long before Draco was packed, ready and waiting on the platform. George had joined him, it was Ginny's last year too. He still wasn't fond of Ginevra Weasley but she wasn't entirely that fond of him either so it felt justified. Besides, seeing her would be unavoidable as she and Harry were still an item. It meant that once the train had arrived she inevitably ended up in a compartment with him, Harry and Hermione. It had been an adjustment to call the two by their first names, as he imagined they struggled with Draco rather than Malfoy. At least now there's smiles and warmth when they slip up.
Most of the students had gathered around the tree sitting with their unwrapped gifts and admiring them. Wrapping paper mountains were dotted across the floor and Draco knew he'd probably be n clean up duty with Hermione in the morning. He'd started his walk towards Harry when the door swung open.
"Ooh they have a surplus of sugar quills," Blaise giggled in glee.
"Hmm," Blaise played with his glass, rolling the bottom around on the coaster. "I really like T. I think I've always liked him, Dray. That's the scary part."
"Draco!" Loud, abrasive knocking on the front door. "I know you're here. Blaise told me."
If Harry marked the exact sentence when Draco had officially nodded off so they could continue reading together it was nothing more than subconscious coincidence.
Draco had been right about the emptiness of the Manor. It was positively bleak. Without his mother the walls and halls were barren. No Christmas decorations to be seen. Draco couldn't bring himself to decorate in her place. Not like he deserved it anyway. He knew he was being scrutinised by the Aurors even though they gave him a wide berth. Excluding them, Draco was utterly alone. The house elves had been relocated to better families who would treat them with kindness and respect.
"Right, sorry, I wasn't..."
In Draco's opinion the, hug lasted far longer than anything he'd be comfortable with, but the two men looked comfortable enough in each other's company. Besides they'd obviously known each other for years, Alex could not have been more than three years older than George which meant they would've been on the Gryffindor quidditch team together. All the Weasley's seemed to have a thing for Quidditch men, Draco could've sworn that Percy had a fling with Wood before he ended up with Marcus. Not to mention Ron's obsession with Krum in fourth year. He didn't know whether Bill had ever had the same inclination, Charlie most definitely would not have but Fred was an exception, Lee Jordan didn't play Quidditch at least - as short lived as that relationship was.
"I promise he will be kept away from anything flammable," Dean did some sort of signal with his hands. "Ah, you probably don't know what that means."
"The only time I'm free long enough is for three hours after lunch on Thursdays," Draco remembered his full schedule.
I'm trying to sort out an update schedule for this so it'll be weekly, rather than over two weeks between updates.
George smiled as he cleaned up around Draco. He shooed Draco out of the kitchen promptly, dealing with the mess himself. Draco hurried to his room, filled with an excitement that came out of nowhere. He wasn't exactly looking forward to spending Christmas at the flat but he definitely did not want to spend it in the Manor alone.
, Draco thought,
Draco could feel his heart breaking. He hadn't needed time to decide exactly what to do with his feelings. Harry had made that decision for him. He still stared at Draco with Lucious' eyes. Draco's grey eyes still shone with fear. Except this time his father was in Azkaban. What were the repercussions of standing up for who'd he'd become since the war?
"It's not...I meant..."
"Are you okay?"
Draco deserved this. It was a fitting consequence and the one that should've been enforced on him at the end of the war.
"Merlin knows you've needed on of those for years," Blaise laughed.
The tutoring sessions had been going even better after that. Harry could grasp Astronomy far more easily when he could see the stars. Learning for himself without a professor spouting information at him. He learnt things in a different order than the lesson plan but was getting higher marks on his homework. In return Draco was now on track and excelling in his Muggle Studies work. Even if Draco forgot what piece was for which class Harry had begun jotting them down and would remind Draco when he got flustered. Draco's understanding had improved as a whole but he knew Harry would help him when his mind drew a blank. It was a perfect system. And then Hermione turned up for a session instead of Harry.
Harry let out a loud laugh at Draco's hesitation of the phrase. Once again it set the entire group off laughing. The conversation drifted from school back into their personal lives. Mostly if anyone had made plans for Christmas yet - Hermione had of course - but Draco wouldn't join that topic. No-one pushed him for an answer.
Draco left the two, choosing to be alone with his thoughts as he made the way to the Great Hall. He didn't run into any other eighth years, Draco thought they must either already be at breakfast or sleeping of the hangovers he was sure many would be nursing. Once he reached the Great Hall he realised there were now five tables instead of four, though the fifth was significantly smaller than the others. The eighth years were firmly situated on the fifth table. Just as Draco thought a few were looking rather worse for ware. Hermione spotted him and waved him over. As soon as he dropped down onto the seat next to her he helped himself to a plate with French toast and some bacon. Draco also grabbed himself a glass of orange juice before focusing on his meal.
"How about we start off with Truths? Start with really simple, impersonal stuff and then when we're a bit more comfortable we can move onto more personal things. It can turn into Truth or Shot then," Theodore suggested. "Once we're sufficiently drunk we can move onto the classics. Still taking a shot if you don't answer or do the dare though."
Draco had begun to agree with Blaise that the schoolwork was killing him. He'd never admit that willingly to the other though. He'd thought that only taking one subject to do two years worth of work in one it wouldn't be such an issue. He was wrong. He was on top of the reading for the classes but keeping up with the schedule and homework was his downfall. He often forgot which homework was the sixth years and which was the seventh years. Many of his friends had found him asleep at desks in the library and the common room. Multiple times. It was only a month into the school year. Draco was normally much more in control. He prided himself on his book smarts and was just under Hermione in terms of scores. This was a new level for him. He'd been having trouble grasping some of the Muggle concepts. He was reaching his breaking point when Harry found him.
"Piss off. Nobody here cares. Me especially," Harry spat out. "Fuck off with your new boyfriend and his parents."
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Blaise hovering nearby. Theodore had approached Hermione, pulling a name out before smiling slightly. Draco watched Theodore's eyes dart to Blaise but just as quickly they had zeroed in on Pansy and Blaise was forgotten. Draco still didn't know exactly what was going on between the two boys.
"Because of you. You've changed. Not for the better."
Draco knew exactly why he was disappointed and it was more than his routine being interrupted. Hermione was a Muggleborn and - no offense to Harry - she was a lot smarter. Draco should've been happy she was offering to help but the truth is he wasn't.
"I'm kidding, don't worry about it. I know I'm beautiful, definitely worth the stare," that earned him a playful shove from Alex. "I invited Alex outside of work, but since he's an Auror technically..."
"Anything for a fellow Gryffindor beater, Georgie. Besides it's not like he actually got up to much."
"You know he always tried. When he was allowed round that was. I always used to look forward to visits from him and Aunt Andromeda," Draco sighed wistfully, pulling an old band t-shirt to his chest. "I remember this one. He'd snuck out and his mum went absolutely livid. I think it was the final push to him moving in with the Potter's, but he'd already had one foot out the door, Mother said."
The other two had joined Draco on the floor - periodically bursting into bouts of giggles - when Hermione came down to walk with them to dinner a half hour later. The four walked to the Great Hall, Hermione and Blaise were trying to ask questions about the spell he created. Draco wasn't answering them, both for George's sake and his own. Also the three boys could burst into laughter at any moment so honestly Hermione didn't get much out of any of them in terms of conversation.
"Oh, right."
"You didn't. I'm glad you've found a label that works for you though."
It was why he was unsurprised when that Wednesday afternoon had gone the way it did. He'd known that Ginny had arranged a movie day for Harry in the common room and had taken his leave for the library to study for his December tests. There was only so much studying his brain could take and it had been at least four hours since he'd left. He'd thought it would be safe to return as Ginny usually headed for lunch at this time. He headed back to the common room in a haze of bliss, only to walk in on Ginny screaming in Harry's face. Harry was trying to calm her, acting as though she was a dangerous, wild animal.
"Honestly, Harry. He's so fussy about the quality of his work," Hermione huffed. "I don't know how you deal with him."
He'd already owled his friends. They needed to know where he was and that he still wouldn't be taking any of their offers. He told them that he was fine. Draco knew this was a lie and could admit it to himself, but not to them. He was a decent cook even if there wasn't a lot in the pantry. He would need to shop for some more food but couldn't bring himself to go. Draco had resigned himself to a Christmas alone. No friends, family or food.
"I...well...it is the manor. But it's also you too. You're fine during the school term 'cause you've got teachers watching over you."
"Never again," Hermione shuddered.
Finally, one night Ginny had been ill and Blaise had overworked himself so fell asleep almost immediately after dinner. Harry and Draco were both free to stargaze. They waited up in the common room until around half eleven before Harry wrapped his invisibility cloak around the two of them. The two barely fit, both quite tall and Harry was fairly broad. Draco's sure their shoes and ankles were visible but he didn't care. He just wanted to be up at the Astronomy tower. The sooner they got there the sooner the electric feeling Draco got when Harry's arm brushed against his would stop.
Though perhaps the show of bravery at the battle was a bigger step towards his wish. Running Potter's wand back to him, disowning the Death Eaters he had been officially sworn into only moments before. His mother had dragged him back to her, clinging onto him tightly. His father had other ideas.
"If you think that's getting you a kiss, Pans, you're deeply misled. Also no, I'm good."
"What?"
"Didn't eat much at dinner either?"
"You are seventeen years old, for Christ's sake. You might want to think about acting like it," Draco sighed. "I highly doubt Harry wants to be dating a small child."
They'd found an empty bottle to spin. Theodore insisted that the randomness made the games more fun. He'd also been the one to kick it off, putting so much force into his spin it seemed endless. Though it did end, landing on Blaise. The usually soft spoken Theodore smirked and Blaise's usual cool composure dropped. It was an odd show for Draco.
"Oh, that there," he gently moved Harry's finger to point at the familiar constellation. "Is Draco."
Draco had heard back from George first. His letter had arrived before Ginny's. Charlie's letter followed soon after saying the same thing. The only difference was that George said Ginny was being an incredibly petty bitch while Charlie merely said she was blowing things out of proportion. Draco supposed that meant he had two Weasleys on his side as he hadn't heard back from the others. They believed him, that's what mattered most. In the aftermath Draco had done his best to avoid Ginny. It had only been a week and a half but he was running on a 100% success rate. He'd managed to head in the opposite direction whenever he saw her coming and had timed his meals so that the two would never be in the Great Hall together at the same time.
Secondly, I'm so sorry. I've become one of those author's who swears they'll update again soon and then are unheard from for six months.
"I didn't used to be. I've just had a lot of free time lately," Harry shrugged. "There's only so much homework I can do before I actually finish it all."
"I'd like to be a healer," he almost whispered. "If they'd let me."
Blaise rambled on, explaining that he always thought Theodore was cute when they were younger, but at first thought it was in a younger sibling type way. Draco did not point out that Theodore was older than Blaise by a few months. Blaise continued on with saying that the Theodore that returned was different but not in a bad way. He was far more outgoing and quick to make friends. There were still moments that he was the quiet, shy boy they had known. Especially when Blaise and Theodore hung out alone.
"Can I just do the shot?"
Draco thrust the gift into Harry's hands. He was careful not to damage it as he couldn't forget the number of hours he'd poured into it. He stormed away before the dam broke fully. Once he reached his room the tears were flowing freely. He ignored Blaise's questioning as he packed. Especially about where he would even go.
"Um, that's still more subjects than recommended for NEWTs. How on earth are you managing it?" Harry looked shocked.
Upon reaching Hogwarts the group had split, Draco wasn't in their house and the returning eighth years had been told to assemble in their common rooms. The walk was rather dark and lonely, Draco began to wish he had found his friends, but he was unsure of who had returned. He was beginning to worry no-one had from how empty the common room was, but he tried to convince himself that it was because he was first off the train.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to unload on you," Draco withdrew into himself, hugging his knees to his chest.
Potter ran in front, wand raised. He looked at his wand in disbelief, as though it had acted of it's own volition. Turning to Draco the disbelief was overtaken by concern as he too dropped to his knees. He gently closed Narcissa's eyes, laying a hand on Draco's.
"Ginny, stop it," Harry sighed. "I can feel the stupid, pointless anger radiating off of you."
The howler shredded itself and the remnants flew themselves into the fire. Hermione looked a little in shock, but held back a reaction. She quickly grabbed her own things and retreated to the girl's dormitories. Theodore had lost it halfway through and had a few tears in his eyes from laughing. Draco and Blaise only had to make eye contact before they were doubling over with laughter themselves. The three boys were making a lot of noise. Dean and Seamus had come to investigate but all they saw was Draco on the floor, Blaise rolled up on the sofa and Theodore bent over a chair back all in tears of laughter, with no sign of stopping.
"Well, after I kissed you earlier I thought you should know. Besides we're friends now, aren't we? I would've told you sooner or later."
In all those rounds Draco was yet to have a turn. Unluckily for him, his first found Pansy smiling smugly on the other end of the bottle.
It wasn't long until the five of them were slightly squished into the booth. Well, Draco, Neville and Harry were. Blaise and Hermione had plenty of space. They group enjoyed their butterbeers, catching each other up on their summers and a bit about the shopping they'd done. They'd successfully managed to keep away from the topic of their education. Draco was glad, Blaise and Hermione had it all figured out, it wouldn't be a surprise if Harry announced he was going on to become an auror. He was sure Neville wanted to teach. But Draco didn't really know what he wanted. To train as a healer was his dream, but he was afraid that his name would restrict him.
"Draco? You done staring or what?" George scoffed.
"That sounds like a fantastic plan."
"I don't know whether I want to go back to that."
"You said yourself you hadn't loved her the same way for a while. I think it's ok," Draco offered.
"If I let you mope about T, you let me mope about Harry."
"Well, it's always scary."
"If you pull out your own name drop it back in and redraw," Hermione stated.
"If you think of any spells, charms or formula's you just let me know."
Dean shrugged at the question, pulling Seamus seamlessly into his lap. They both smiled as Dean leaned down to kiss the smaller boy. As Draco - unsurprised himself - looked around the group he could see a few shocked faces, but found himself to be in the majority of people who already knew. It was rather obvious from the way they acted towards each other. Draco had picked it up during McGonagall's speech in the Great Hall. Blaise had not.
"I hate being part Veela, have I ever told you that? I've had people kiss me because they were accidentally charmed with my looks," Blaise let out a sob. "I don't want it happening again. I though Pans and I would end up married, 'cause of our families, you know? Theodore had to go and bloody kiss me and suddenly I think he's the Veela."
"So you admit it's about Harry."
The last thing Draco saw was his father's fury as the terrifying green approached. He took a deep breath in and shut his eyes. Only the hit never came. There was a rather loud thud in front of him. Draco opened his eyes to his mother's dull ones staring back.
So much for no lower years invading the peace. Ginny came through like a whirlwind. She had bragged about her new boyfriend, stating he was infinitely better than Harry had been. She called Harry ungrateful and said that he didn't know what he'd lost. It was petty until she had the audacity to claim that she'd be meeting the boy's parents over Christmas, something she never would have done if she stayed with Harry. Draco didn't know when Ginny had turned into such a horrid person. Perhaps she always had been. It never mattered much to him. It had gotten too much for Harry, though Draco was proud he'd held restraint until that moment.
Lucious had always wanted to play happy families at Christmas. Mostly wanting to show the strength and infamy of the Malfoy name. When he was younger it hadn't bothered Draco, really it made him happy because his father actually seemed to want to spend time with him. He grew wise in his teenage years. Ever since he was fourteen he'd spent Christmas at Hogwarts, away from his father's hold. The castle always decorated itself beautifully and the mood would become more uplifting the closer the date crept up to the 25th.
"Hello Draco. Neville told me about your trip. I hope you're all feeling ok," Luna greeted as he sat. "It is nargle season after all."
"It's fine. I was stuck with this question for the seventh year class. It's the very last question but I can't make heads or tails of it," Draco pointed towards the end of his parchment.
Draco was also pulled into Zonko's against his will, he really hoped that George would not find out. Though it was a good chance to get an insight to the competitor's products. Besides Blaise was amusing himself picking out a few dungbombs and simpler, less stinky pranks. Draco did hope to stay on Blaise's good side, being on the receiving end of Blaise's tricks was not a fun experience. The difference now was that Draco had discovered a spell to counter it, sending a far worse smell back to the original sender while ridding himself of it. Helped, of course, by the many hours spent sat and smelling in George's shop as the tried to discover exactly how the dungbombs were made. Draco wasn't particularly comfortable with the smell George had decided on and would rather not have to use it on Blaise.
Pansy came running down the stairs before tackling Draco in the biggest hug he had ever received. She promptly did the same to Theodore before practically throwing herself at Blaise, knocking them both to the floor. Laughter rang out within the group, though Blaise tried to keep a straight face it wasn't long until he joined in with the hysterics. It must have been quite a sight for the poor fourth year student who had come to retrieve them.
"You know there's probably something fundamentally wrong with that, but I can't fault the logic."
Draco had woken up to no Blaise. The other boy had always been and early riser but he had also worked himself into a bad state the previous night. Draco hadn't expected him to wake until at least noon. Dean and Seamus were still sleeping, they were disgustingly cute Draco had decided. Blaise's pyjamas were folded neatly on his pillow and the previous night's clothes were in his laundry bag. Blaise was probably at breakfast if he wasn't in the room. Draco checked his clock, cursing at the time. He threw himself out of bed and changed quickly before spelling his hair in the usual style. A habit he had been unable to break.
"You've always been surrounded by people even if you weren't interacting with them. You're friends and family were always there if you needed them," George crossed his arms. "This is the first time you're truly alone."
That was the beginning of their weekly tutoring sessions. They'd bring snacks and that weeks homework. They worked on Astronomy together, Draco helping Harry with the more difficult questions. Harry mostly told Draco all about the Muggle world as the latter hurriedly took notes on everything Harry was saying. Harry would help him when Draco couldn't apply the notes to his homework. Draco had also promised the two would sneak out to the tower to have a proper Astronomy tutoring session. It didn't happen for the first few weeks. Ginny would usually claim Harry for the evening and Blaise was still going through his sexuality crisis but was opening up to Draco about it all so evenings were spent calming him, helping him through it all.
