After a minute, Harry touches his hand to Draco's elbow. "Take your coat off," he says. "Take off your shoes."
"It has been from where I'm standing," Harry says. He closes his eyes. "It's been years."
"Like the world's opening up again."
"Love you," Harry says softly. "Love you so much."
"He'll wank him off while he's doing you, if you want."
Last time, though, Harry had wanted his cock warmed. This time he just leads him over to the standing lamp by the fireplace, and starts to wrap the lead around the upright, tight enough that Draco has to kneel at the foot of it, turned around so that his back is to the lamp.
Draco's finger curls a little.
And Draco likes it.
Harry looks at him with an eyebrow cocked, and Draco sits down.
For a start, the dress code is apparently 'casual', and Draco owns nothing that would fit Ron Weasley's definition of casual, and Draco's never sat down for dinner with guests in anything less than a shirt and tie. His London bedroom is littered with discarded outfit choices, and he's no closer to a final decision about what to wear than he had been half an hour ago.
"Stop touching," Harry says. "Piglets don't get to touch. Piglets rut, Draco. They rut like animals, and what are you?"
"I'm fine. I'm more than fine. I'm here with you, aren't I?"
goes unanswered.
"Take as long as you like," Harry says, and Draco, lost in the early morning greyness of the day, nods his yes into the air.
"Out you get," Harry says. "I think we're done playing for now, don't you, Draco?"
Draco doesn't cry. He doesn't. But he does well up at the intensity in Harry's expression. He blinks the tears away. He can't say it back even though it feels like it's seeping out of every pore. He slides his hand into Harry's messy hair, stroking at his scalp.
Draco grins, and holds out his hand. "Come on," he says, and tugs Harry down the hall to his bedroom.
Harry lets go of Draco's hand so he can cup his cheek and tilt his chin up. "I love you," he says, kissing him. Draco smiles into their kiss. There's nothing shameful about this. Nothing humiliating or desperate or needy. It doesn't come everywhere with him and Harry doesn't bring it with him either. It's just them, on a cold afternoon by the sea.
"No," Ginny says. "We're not still doing it."
Draco flushes. Sometimes he doesn't make it until lunchtime. Sometimes he slips his hand beneath his robes and plays with himself until he comes long before noon. "Sometimes I can't wait. Sometimes it's before lunch."
"What kind of cake?"
Draco realises he's lost his scarf around the same time he realises just how cold it is outside, which is around the same time that the sun starts to disappear behind the tumbledown rooftop of Ginny Weasley's new house. He's been at this for about four hours so far, and it's going to need another day. He's tired, and he liked that scarf, and the wards have turned out to be more complex than he envisaged.
“I thought we could go through the woods,” Draco says, trying to make it sound as if he hadn’t been laying in bed that morning planning a route that went down by the Quidditch pitch and out through the woods to the sand dunes and the beach, then back up through the gardens to the house. “Maybe go and see the sea.”
"Two hundred," Harry says.
Harry hides his face in Draco’s neck. “Sea to the front, about 100 metres away, wood to the back, ten paces behind us to the tree line, beach extending out to the horizon to the north, south it disappears around a corner approximately one mile distant. Nobody to the south. Possible person to the north, possible dog walker. Approximately two miles distant. Dunes could hide someone. Backs to the trees, that could house another threat. No tracks in the woods, and anything there wouldn’t be you because you’ve barely been here—“
"It’s filthy," Draco says, a little dazed. "Really filthy."
"No," Harry says, stopping him by closing his hand around Draco's wrist. "It's not my fault you're lazy and didn't come prepared. Do you think I have time to wait around while you take your clothes off? Down on your knees."
"I don't know what that is," Draco says, although his attention is rather lost in Harry talking so easily about his feelings for Draco. Draco, who nobody had wanted. Who'd ended up finding this, instead, this pocket of space in the universe where he and Harry can breathe.
"I don't want
Harry's masturbating when he gets back, jeans swapped for a loose pair of cotton sportswear trousers, waistband pushed down low.
"Are you ready?" Draco asks.
The continent had followed, and so had Draco going down on his knees for anyone who'd use him.
Draco goes what he's fairly certain is an unflattering shade of red. "I like looking after you."
"I know," Draco says, because he's fairly certain it's what Harry needs to hear right now. "It'll just be there if you do. When you do."
Draco doesn't know what else to do, so he does as Harry says, and drinks from his stemless wine glass like a heathen.
"I think we can run to that," Harry says, and then, somehow, there's some kind of spell that leaves Draco feeling like he's just touched by a warm breeze, and they're both naked in front of the mirror. The clothes are gone, Harry's too.
"I’d do better."
Before Draco can approach him, Harry's shoulders catch like he's just remembered somewhere he needs to be, and he scans the people around him, gaze flitting from person to person, to Draco and beyond, and then back, settling on Draco.
"I've been thinking about that for ages," Harry says, breathless, a minute or so later. He's close enough that Draco can see the smattering of pale freckles on his nose, the brightness of his eyes, the way his eyelashes look against his skin as he blinks.
Harry looks at him. "Yes," he says. "Wouldn't you like to try?"
"Get your cock out anywhere I told you to, let everyone see what a pointless little thing it is."
"Yes," Draco says. "And I picked them because they thought I was important. You didn't think I was important."
"All right, Ron," Harry says, and there follows some kind of sociological investigation into male affection that Draco can't really follow, that includes some shoulder holding and back slapping but nothing that actually turns into a hug. "How's it going?"
After Harry leaves the room, it takes Draco a lot longer than it should to stand up and get started.
The noise Draco makes is humiliating. Harry hums a laugh into Draco's skin, and reaches down between them to circle his own cock and slick himself up.
Draco whines. He's made such a disgusting mess of his underwear. He's all wet and kind of slimy and the shame makes it feel like there are tiny little spells going off all over his body, tingles and shivers.
He's back at Ginevra Weasley's tumbledown, broken house when the charmed silver coin he carries with him glows with a message. He feels it call to him, feels the warmth in his pocket as the message sings to him, but he stays where he is, attention focused carefully on Miss Weasley as she explains the complex wards she requires from him, and what she's willing to pay.
"There you are," Harry says. "Back with us."
"Shut up," the man says, and he leans in and strokes his finger over Draco's hole. "Only good for your holes, aren't you? Tell me. You're only good for your holes."
"It's all right," Draco says, ducking his head. "It's just a-- I wanted to. But we don't have to. We have an arrangement."

and rests his hand on Draco’s waist.
Harry burrows in a little closer. "I'm so tired of being brave all the time. I'm so tired of always pretending I can deal with it."
Draco meets his gaze. "I want you to."
"I can imagine," Harry says. "My desperate boy. Always so needy, aren't you?"
"See?" Ron says, attempting to unwind his child from around his leg. "She never used to be shy. You like Uncle Harry, Rose. Say hello to Uncle Harry and--" he stumbles over the words, his cheeks reddening --"Uncle Draco."
written on the side. It's filled with water.
"It was," Harry agrees. "It's not anymore though, is it?" There's a pause, and Harry stops, pulling them over to the edge of the pavement, out of the way of the busy shoppers. "Did I get that wrong?"
"Hmm," Harry says, and murmurs an
He comes back a few minutes later, dutifully having failed to put his tie back on, but with a tray with the wine, two glasses, and a selection of sun-dried tomatoes, olives, oils, sliced fresh bread, tiny mozzarella balls, and balsamic vinegar. It wasn't that he hadn't eaten, but a small bowl of soup felt a little like a lie, especially when the box of chocolates he'd treated himself to was going to be the main course. Harry had taken his shoes and coat off, but where he'd magicked them away to, Draco couldn't tell. His jumper was one of his new ones, a deep burgundy, and his trousers slim-fitting and the right length. A book rests on the arm of the sofa closest to Harry. His socks are bright blue and have tiny octopuses on. Draco hadn't signed off on those, he'd have remembered.
, when asked. Then it's a large apartment in London, a house in the Scottish highlands, and another apartment in France. It's one in Italy, and another place in Norway.
"My cock's stupid and useless. It's too small."
"You deserve them," Harry says, settling back against the sofa and bringing Draco with him, an arm around his shoulders. Draco stays rigid for a moment longer than he should before letting himself relax against Harry's side. He takes a sip of wine. It is nice. Granger has good taste. "I'm so pleased you bought them for yourself."
Harry runs his fingers through Draco's hair. Draco's still: he's warming Harry's cock until Harry tells him to do otherwise.
Harry sighs. "Finish your food, Draco, and then come and kneel over here."
"What are you going to be doing?"
“Mine,” Harry says, as he spells it closed around Draco’s neck. “My Piglet.”
“Dumbledore was a great wizard,” Harry says evenly. “But not without his flaws.”
"Amongst other things." He meets her eyes. "I know you have no reason to trust me. I know you're protective of Harry. But so am I."
"Aunt Petunia hated mint chocolate, so she wouldn't ever have them in the house. Therefore, they're my decadent after dinner mint of choice. She did like an orange Elizabeth Shaw, so we avoid them and their mint equivalent."
"Imagine if I wasn't," Harry says. "Imagine if I just followed you around and talked about you all the time and I had a bit of free brain space to realise it was because I fancied you rotten."
"Hmm," Harry says. "Show me them."
“I don’t want it,” Harry says, too quickly.
"You're still dressed," he says, unable to help himself from going pink.
"Oh no," Ron says. "Look at that. I'm going to have to be nice to this wanker for ages now, they're not casual. We don't look at each other like that, do we?"
They didn't speak of Teddy Lupin.
"Look down and see," Harry says, and it's a wrench, but Draco forces himself to. The cake's squashed, smashed into pieces, icing and sponge smeared across his skin and the floor and his thighs. His dick is a mess of chocolate. "You're such a filthy piglet. What are you?"
Harry opens his door wider. "Come in," he says finally. "It's cold out here."
Draco hums. He presses his tongue to the underside of Harry's cock, but Harry just rolls his eyes, pulling out.
Afterwards, he lets Harry fuck his mouth, still kneeling down with his cock out and his come across the floor.
Draco just feels desperately sad. "I'm not taking it away," he says. "I wouldn't ever take it away from you. It's not about that. It's me just realising that you still don't think you can want it, and me saying that we should talk about finding a way for you to be at peace with this part of you. Because what we've been doing so far hasn't been working. And I think I've been embarrassed about talking about it with you, because I know how embarrassed you are admitting that you want it. I didn't want to make you embarrassed. I still don't. I just want to make you feel safe. I want that more than anything."
Harry strokes him through it, slicking up his cock with his come, milking him until there's nothing left, until Draco's resting on his elbows and panting, forehead pressed to his hands.
"Yes," Draco says, because he was. He thrives on it. He’s been fantasising about being used for so long that the reality feels like a thousand times bigger and better.
and eaten a good half of the box of After Eights before Draco's built up the courage to say what he thinks he needs to. He's not as keen on this record as the one that came before it, Carole King, but Harry says this Oasis album is one of his favourites so Draco's willing to give it a go. If nothing else, it's given him a bit of an insight into Harry's teenage music choices, and an opportunity to at least plan out - for about the tenth time - what he's going to say to Harry.
"Use it to make me come," Harry tells him, even as Draco's panting into his mouth, their kisses breathless and slick. "Please."
, it's enough to make him want to fucking come, and he hadn't even realised this was something he might want. Humiliation normally comes with being noticed, but not being important enough to notice was humiliating in and of itself.
Harry wraps his arms around Draco's shoulders. "Hold on," he says, and then the air's swirling around them and they're whipped away, whipped away from the little alleyway in central London, and are back in Draco's flat instead, inside the vestibule where the permissible guest wards start.
"You dirty, filthy piglet," Harry says, depositing his purchases on the sideboard. "Four seconds in the house and you're shaming yourself like this."
“Do you have wellingtons?” Draco asks, because he’s fairly certain he doesn’t, even if he wasn’t planning on wearing the same black boots he always wears when he’s working and has to take the lay of the land from the outside to work on incompetent people’s wards. He’s done nothing else to prepare for their walk other than put on a thicker jumper under his warm coat and find a scarf.
Draco hums, closing his eyes. He settles where he kneels, aware of the discomfort where he hasn’t got comfortable, where the carpet presses against his knees. His back’s not quite at the right angle. He’s been in plenty of uncomfortable positions in his life, and he’s used to them. And all of those discomforts never came with the added benefit of being used, of having Harry Potter’s cock in his mouth, so he almost trembles with it, with need and desire and want. He catalogues each of the feelings in turn, all of the points where he touches the floor, all of the points where the floor touches him. Harry’s cock a solid weight in his mouth, spit sliding down his chin at the the size of him.
He makes them both more tea, and then, when they're both finished, he takes the tray back into the little kitchen, opening a cupboard door and slipping the tray inside, so it'll appear back in the main kitchen for cleaning. Then he comes back to the fire, stopping by the newer bookcase as he goes past, and coming back with the little basket of things he'd got from Flourish and Blotts.
"Let me suck you off," Harry says. "Please let me suck you off."
"What are you?" Harry asks conversationally, un-shrinking their parcels. He gets one of the Gryffindor red bowls and holds his wand to it, and when Draco looks again, it says - in big, gold, Gryffindor caps - PIGLET DRACO around the rim.
"That's right," Harry says, and he leans even closer in. "And I want to see your face in that cake."
It seems shockingly domestic, although Draco's adult life has always been quietly inward looking, a series of domestic engagements taking him through his days. Just never like this, the two of them together, the rain on the slates as they go inside the cottage and lock up against the night. The fire is already burning, and as Draco settles down to check that the fire charms are up to scratch, Harry turns the radio on in the kitchen and warms the stew he'd brought with him on the stove. He lays the table as Draco strengthens the charms; a bright little tablecloth and old table mats with puffins on, a basket with bread, butter, a bottle of beer each, poured into glasses. The smell of beef stew settles gently around them.
, his mother had said, and then she'd cried when she'd realised he wasn't going to. It wasn't him being gay that she had a problem with -- although she might if she knew even the littlest part of what he really liked to think about when he came -- but the end of the Black line.
They strip quickly, and not even the part of Draco that is desperate to serve is enough to slow them down. He's naked, his little cock stiff and leaking, before Harry's finished taking off his jeans. They're not… what they've done together hasn't really been the two of them naked together, at least not like this.
"I won't be in a minute," Harry says. He's smiling. He doesn't look nervous, but then, he wouldn't; it's not his first time. "Take your underwear off and get into bed."
"That's right, sir," Draco says, because he's still dressed as a valet. He plays with Harry's cock, getting it slick. "And tonight you're letting me look after you, aren't you?"
"I do love you," Harry says. He sits back. "Am I going too fast? I was always somewhere different to where Ginny was, although I never realised until after I'd said something like this and had to have it pointed out we were on entirely different pages. You'd think I'd have more of a clue what I was doing by now, but it turns out I don't. Not really. I don't want to get it wrong this time."
Harry strokes his hand through Draco's hair, forceful enough that Draco tilts his chin up to meet his gaze.
"Yes," Draco says, although a large breakfast is rare for him. He and his mother had enjoyed quiet breakfasts with a pot of a tea, a little fruit, and a single piece of toast, eaten slowly. Harry is haphazard and hungry and doesn't mind that his food is all on top of each other and not neatly presented, like how it looks isn't important.
“Too many fairy tales about beasts alone in castles, aren’t there? Didn’t want to become one.” He shrugs again. “Anyway. It’s hardly likely my father acquired this through entirely legitimate means. It’s still living off him even if he’s not here to see me do it.”
"It doesn't," Draco says, voice a little rough. He gets into bed and leaves far too big a gap between him and Harry, but Harry just rolls his eyes and moves closer, messing with the pillows so that he's all propped up. Draco stays still and stiff. "I could make your bed for you, if you'd like."
That just makes him harder. Shame courses through him, like the little stream running by the cottage and down into the sea.
"Not at all," Draco says. "Help yourself."
was acceptable so Draco chooses not to listen to Harry's risqué opinions.
Harry curls in a little closer. When he speaks again, it’s a little muffled against Draco’s chest. "Why won’t you tell me if you want to be with me?"
"I see the problem," Harry says. "My piglet's tiny cocklet is too stiff to piss. Is it the possibility that someone could see you? Could see that you're nothing more than an animal?"
Draco drops his head. He's panting. His arms are trembling; he's on his hands and knees in the garden as Harry plays with his cock. He's Harry's pet, an animal, and he loves it. He loves it.
"Show me that nice soft tummy first," Harry says, as Draco finishes up his toast, and Draco, pink-cheeked, takes off his top layers until he's not wearing anything above the waist. There's none of the hollows and the spaces where indulgence should have been but wasn't, not anymore. He's filling out, his skin soft beneath his fingertips, his belly a gentle curve instead of concave, like before. "That's better now, isn't it, love? Now play with your nipples, like a good boy."
Harry’s eyes are bright. "Thank fuck," he says, and he closes the difference between them and presses his mouth to Draco’s, kissing him again. "Thank fuck."
"All yours," Draco agrees. "You can name them if you like."
"Where were you hiding that?" Draco asks. "Did you take it out to the Quidditch pitch?"
"Right here on the Quidditch pitch," Harry says. "Where anyone could see."
Draco flushes. "Yes."
"Just move," Harry says, and he puts his hands above his head and dances. "Just move because you're happy, and because you're with me, and because it's nice."
"I think we lie here for a bit," Harry says. "And then we eat the iced buns I got us in M&S, and you can tell me how and when you'd like me to fuck you."
Draco is so, so hard. There's no way he can do this, but he wants to, wants to so much. He doesn't use the toilet in front of anyone. He remembers his nanny taking him as far as the bathroom door, even when he was very small. He always used a cubicle at school. His forays into the back corridors and toilets of some of the seedier clubs has always been purely sexual, up to and including that first time with Harry in the pub in north London, waiting there with his cock out like Harry had told him to. The beginning of everything else.
Draco breathes.
"We do that
Harry’s smile is still uncertain. “Draco. Don’t fuck with me.”
Draco expects Harry to tell him to take his clothes off, but instead, Harry just steps into Draco's space, cups his face in his hand, and kisses him softly.
It's nice, and quiet, and Draco's a little fuzzy from the wine and the warmth from the fire. Harry's hand is in his hair.
He buckles Draco's leather collar closed, testing its tightness by sliding a finger beneath Draco's skin and the collar. He must be satisfied with it, because he clips the lead onto the collar.
. We're trying to build something, right? A future? I thought we were clear on that."
"A whisky and Coke," Draco says, because Coke's a muggle habit he can get behind. "Thank you."
"It wasn't bad. I don't know how often I'd want to do it again, though. It felt like I was off somewhere else. Like I could lose myself, given the opportunity."
Somewhat mollified, Draco kisses him back. "Promise?"
"He's not much of anything, is he?"
"Harry--"
Harry expression looks a little awkward. "So what happens now?"
"You've had too much control over that silly little thing," Harry goes on, stroking Draco's hair, touching his face, letting Draco nuzzle closer. "Do you think you should have control over anything? Should horny little piglets be able to control when they come?"
. There's a
"My good boy," Draco says, and when Harry smiles softly up at him, his eyes are bright.
"I do," Draco says, and steps back so that Harry can come in. He closes the door after Harry, and the series of locks whirr away to themselves as the magic works like clockwork. Harry glances at him.
"I want you to look after me," Harry says, and he turns over, the water coming off him like he’s arising from the deep instead of just kneeling over Draco, hands to the back of the bath behind Draco’s head. "I want you to take care of me. That’s what I’m asking you for."
"Hey," Harry says, after a while.
They're supposed to be reading, or some such, but they don't. Draco doesn't touch the chocolates and instead they eat most of the bread and olives and tomatoes, and take their time finishing the bottle of wine. There's a record playing on the record player. They shift position on the sofa so that Harry has his back to the sofa arm and Draco's in-between his legs, cheek resting against Harry's chest.
"Of course," Draco says. "I'm in the sitting room. I'll just go and get us some glasses."
"Yes?"
"What are you doing?"
, oh, fuck, this is what this feels like.
If it's a reprimand for Draco putting it on himself that morning, it's carefully and kindly done, and Draco just nods, even as Harry's wrapping it around his neck and buckling it closed.
Harry’s already over by one of the sets of hoops, turning over and over in the air like he’s being buffeted by the wind. Except there is no real wind to speak of, and Harry just looks stupidly happy. Draco hasn’t been on a broom in a while, not like this, but it’s all coming back.
In the end, he's disturbed by the doorbell just after six. He wasn't expecting anyone -- he never has anyone to expect; anyone contacting him about work sends an owl, and he never has meetings at home -- but he takes off his glasses and folds them away before standing up and smoothing down his clothes, checking his appearance in the mirror before heading for the door. It won't do to look anything but immaculate.
, and I can't do that to her if it isn't. I can't, and I won't. So you need to know what it is that you're suggesting when you talk about us going to see her. And what it means."
Draco doesn’t think about Hogwarts. He doesn’t think about who he was when he was there, or the choices that he made that helped things reach their conclusion. He doesn’t think about his fucking superiority complex or the smug swagger of a boy who thought he was too good for his surroundings and the people around him. He doesn’t let himself. But he’ll think about this, him on his knees for Harry Potter in the middle of the Quidditch pitch, the cold seeping in through his knees, his mouth around Harry’s cock. He’ll think about this as he groans around him, as the taste of Harry leaks against his tongue.
"Come closer and warm my cock," Harry says, and he starts to wind the leash around his hand so that Draco is compelled forward, into the open V of Harry's legs. He licks his lips as Harry pushes down his trousers just enough that his cock is free. Draco's mouth is watering. This is what he's here for; to be used. To be a hole. Nothing. An animal.
Draco pokes him in the side. "We’ll see about that."
Draco's bag contains a bottle of wine, a white orchid, and a small box of after dinner mint chocolates. He feels curiously underprepared for this evening, even as Harry rests his hand in the small of Draco's house and nudges him forward. "Why couldn't we just apparate to their actual house?"
when he's this hard.
"I basically just pull the duvet across and call it done," Harry says, climbing into bed and patting the spot next to him, like he's not a stranger to Draco's bed and Draco's side, and like this isn't the first time in their entire lives they're going to be in bed together. "I don't think it really counts."
"Morning," Harry says.
Harry's hard. His dick is thickly outlined in his trousers. "Draco--"
Harry shrugs. "You're not high on my priority list."
Draco looks at her. "Do you think I don't know that? How do you think I could possibly be with him and not know?"
"Going to come all over you," Harry goes on. "Going to come all over you face and then we can go inside and you can warm my cock. Go down on your knees and keep my cock in your mouth so I can make use of my piglet’s hole. How’d you like that?"
“Not more than necessary,” Draco says. It’s cold outside, but bright and clear, the sun glinting down through the trees.
"I know," Draco says, as Harry plays with his dick. "I just don't want it all together like that. It's a fantasy in and of itself."
, not with what they want, but it doesn't stop him from wrapping his mouth around the guy's big cock and sucking him down. His jaw aches with the girth, and after he comes, the guy cups Draco's chin in his hand and calls him a pretty little whore.
"I know," Harry says. "You're always dirty. You're a dirty fucking piglet."
"Yes," Harry says. He turns around, leaning up against the table but making no move to come back over to the sofa. He folds his arms.
"Do you want me to get the lead? Even if we don't use it yet?"
Draco looks at him sharply.
"I didn't get to come earlier."
"Everyone makes that face," Harry says. "Hermione still looks like she might cry sometimes. Ron and his brothers had to break me out one summer, but Fred and George taught me to pick locks after that, so not the end of the world. Normally I try not to talk about it anymore because, you know, people looking like they might cry is a bit rubbish but I thought I might try my material out on a new audience."
"Not much," Harry says. His tongue laps at Draco's skin. "The usual things someone says when you admit you're in love with your childhood nemesis. Am I sure, am I okay, am I sure I'm not under an enchantment."
Their destination is a small cottage on the Pembrokeshire coastline, nestled in the dip between the cliffs, accessible only by apparition or a rough track across a neighbour's farmland. Even the coast path diverts inland around the cottage, leaving the small rocky beach for them and them alone. Standing at the top of the beach as the rain falls down around them, their macintoshes impervio'd to water, Draco breathes in the salt air, in and out, and lets his shoulders relax.
"Well, that's good," Draco says. His heart pounds. "What do you need?"
"Is it," Draco says grimly, and then it all gets worse because he's faced with a busy escalator as the only way out, and if there's one thing he's never understood - even from frequent re-readings of Martin Miggs - it's how escalators are supposed to work.
“You’re all right,” Draco tells him, over and over again. “You can have this. It’s yours. You have permission.”
"Please," Draco says, and this time he's the one that leads Harry upstairs.
Harry helps him to his feet, and then under the covers. He follows him in, and wraps his arms around Draco's shoulders. "Don't be embarrassed," he says. "Don't be embarrassed because it's something we both want."
," he says, "it can't be
"I wish I'd said yes to being your friend that time," Harry says, in the end. "When you offered it to me. Friendship. I wish I'd said yes."
Harry reaches for Draco's hand and links their fingers together. It takes Draco by surprise, Harry's palm pressed to his. Harry catches his eye. His ensuing smile is the warm sort, and Draco can't help but return it in kind.
He doesn't last long, but then why should he? He's a come-hungry dirty piglet. He comes, panting, crying out, all over his bunched up tiger shirt.
"No," Draco says. "Of course I wouldn’t."
Draco does his best attempt at not glowing. "So, you just narrowed it down until you figured out I was the one on my knees, right?"
picked out in Harry's chicken-scratch handwriting.
"Are you still--" he trails off.
"Please," Draco says. "Please, Harry." He doesn't know quite what he's begging for, only that he wants it.
The fire crackles merrily and Draco chooses not to focus his attention on it too much, concentrating more on appearing careless of his surroundings to Harry. If Harry could come to be as carefree in the nursery then maybe all this will have been worthwhile.
"Harry," Draco says. Hermione says it too but Draco's not listening to her. His heart's pounding.
"I'm glad," she says. "No, really. I think it might be nice for Harry to be on friendly terms with you."
Harry shrugs his shoulders. "Pretend it's a jokey aside, if you'd like, rather than a biting commentary on my childhood. I meant it to be funny."
"Idiot," Draco says, feeling a little shy.
Draco doesn’t know what they are, so he chooses to ignore it. “None of those people Dumbledore got to protect the stone were anywhere near as good as I am at wards. None of them. I am the best, and your nursery is protected. It’s safe. You’re safe there.”
Draco is very, very sure about the waistcoat. He might never have been surer about anything in his life. "I like it."
"You can come back soon," Draco says. He's offering Harry a full valet service. That's what he's giving Harry as part of their… arrangement. The cleaning's extra, just something else, something Harry deserves outside of what they do. He can't put a proper title on it, but he rather suspects it's got a lot to do with Ginny Weasley telling him that Harry won't let anyone do anything for him. He's letting Draco. He's letting Draco do this for him, and a little thrill keeps pulsing through him every time he remembers.
"We can only dream," Harry says, but he holds Draco's hand a little tighter. "Anyway, imagine if I'd had some free time to investigate why I was obsessed with you and not bandage it up in pretending I was trying to save the world."
"Oh," Draco says. "All right."
Draco shudders with it, with the thrill of the shame of it, and he sucks the guy's dick and swallows some of it and gets the rest on his shirt and his chin.
"How can it possibly be more shaming than any of the other things you like?" Harry asks. "You waking up to rub your little cock on the sheets every day."
"Love it," Harry says, sitting himself down on the sofa like it doesn't matter that everything here once belonged to Draco's father. "It looks incredible."
"My best piglet," Harry says. "So filthy, aren't you? Desperate to be covered in come."
Draco makes a face. He's sure he looks confused. "What," he says. "Never?"
"I am dressed," Draco says, but he's eaten half of another truffle and he want another one.
"Oh, it's you," he says, and Draco flushes. The glamour's back up, but Draco just needed some tiny bit of protection and it's not like Harry can make him look like Draco Malfoy if Draco doesn't want to.
“You’re not a fucking disgrace,” Harry says. “You’re not.”
Draco doesn't know how to say
"You're just nervous," Harry says. "You've got plenty to wear."
"Embarrassed?"
Draco opens his legs, slick dripping out of him and down over his thighs. That ointment has to be fucking charmed; Draco is going to figure out the spell and make so much of it that he'll be wet all the time. It makes him breathless just to think about it.
Another cake. Draco almost laughs.
"So horny all the time, just like an animal," Harry goes on, and he shifts so that he's touching Draco's cock with his finger and thumb. "Always so wet, so slick, so desperate. Going to have to lock this little thing up, can't have my pet ruining the furniture, can I? You'd be rubbing yourself on all my good furniture if I didn't stop you, wouldn't you? Can't stop yourself." He is painfully slow at stroking him, his fingers barely moving. Draco whines again, trying to press back into his touch.
"Harry--"
There's a moment that stretches a beat too long. "Will he?" Draco says finally. "He's your best friend."
"Such a dirty little piglet," Harry tells him, but then his hand curls around Draco's little cock and gives him a little tug. "Such a desperate, hard little piglet. Such a tiny cock."
"Do you think you'll like that? Being that dirty with your food?"
"They're tiny," Draco says.
"Perhaps," Harry says, but then he's shaking hands with the shop assistant, and putting on this whole
"Do I need to get dressed?"
Draco whines, desperate, and Harry starts to come. He comes mostly in Draco's mouth, over his lips and his tongue, and it catches his cheeks and his jaw too. He tries to lick it up. He's a come-whore. A come-hungry little piglet, and he wants to fucking come.
Harry just snorts a laugh and angles his broom towards Draco. They chase each other around the pitch for ages, the wind in their hair, their Quidditch clothes blowing out behind them. They loop-the-loop and Harry attempts some kind of bastardised Wronski Feint that probably would have been a lot easier before they started approaching middle age, or at least stopped practicing. They swoop down towards the ground and back up again, first Harry in the lead, then Draco, and Draco is actually in the middle of
The reply takes a minute.
Draco doesn't exactly understand how they could possibly get from Draco masturbating in Harry's lap to scones so quickly. There's a lot of things he doesn't understand right now and he doesn't quite feel equipped to judge why. Instead, he lets Harry help him to his feet, lets Harry wrap him in a blanket and curl up on the sofa together, lets Harry summon the scones and cream and jam and lets him make a hash of preparing one for him to eat.
"There are some people," Miss Weasley says to him, "that hold me accountable for Harry's broken heart. And they're willing to let me know by any means possible to them."
"Well," Harry says from the open doorway. "Someone's fucking desperate for it, aren't they?"
Draco takes the little fruit tart. It's covered in a shiny glaze, strawberries falling over themselves to stand tall. When he bites into it, he makes the kind of noise that embarrasses him down to his core.
"If you are," Draco says, and Harry rolls his eyes, takes his glasses off, and climbs into bed.
Draco's still staring at the cake box. "I didn't think you meant cream cakes."
"I know," he says. He's drunk his tea too quickly, and mostly on purpose. "I've taken up too much of your time. I'll leave you to your evening."
"Just met up, didn't we? By accident," Harry says, as if he understands what
"What did I do to deserve you, hey?" Harry asks, when the floor's licked clean and Draco's resting on his knees with his cheek pressed to the hardwood. "So beautifully obedient, my dirty, depraved boy."
Draco forces himself to walk over, to put his hand on the back of one of the chairs and to say
"You never said."
"That would be special," Draco says, half lost in imagination, in cake and cream and depravity and Harry behind him, sliding his cock inside of Draco and taking him like Draco wants.
"Fucking hell," Harry says. "Look how hard you are. I tell you a come rag's better than you are, and you're practically coming on the floor. You're so fucked up."
"I will," Harry says. He takes another piece of bread, buttering it before dipping it into his bowl. "I'm happy when I'm with you. You know that, right?"
"Well," Harry says, after a moment. "Would you look at you."
Draco waits, and he waits, and in the end, Harry shakes his head.
Hermione touches his arm then, and Draco flinches before he can help himself. "I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable," she says. "We just wanted to make sure. And we really would like it if you ever wanted to look at our wards."
"Masturbating my cocklet," Draco says.
"I'm sorry," Draco says. His dick's already hard, just at the thought of what's to come.
"I don't know whether I'm the right kind of person for you to be friends with."
"I heard you saw Ron today," Harry says. He's dressed casually, jeans and a t-shirt with a checked shirt over the top. He wanders over to the mirror, and Draco can't help but track Harry's footsteps across the tiles, at the dull stain that he wants to remind him of how low he's fallen. "I heard you weren't very polite."
nothing," Harry says. "Draco Malfoy is nothing. You're just holes. A thing to be used."
, Draco thinks.
When he opens them again, Harry Potter's sitting opposite him, a smile playing across his face.
"And at bedtime I might do it twice," Draco offers. "I read in the middle."
"Neither do I."
He comes, panting and sweating, and folds himself over the sofa arm. He rests his cheek against the back of the sofa, and closes his eyes.
"A filthy little piglet," Harry says, and he comes up off his heels so that he can cup Draco's face in one hand, and lean in to lick at his lips. Draco keens, wanting more, but Harry isn't giving it to him. "Don't think I haven't forgotten your piglet fantasy, Draco." His other hand strokes over Draco's soft stomach. "My beautiful, indulged piglet. Given everything that you could possibly want until you forget everything else, isn't that right? Eating and rutting and warming my cock until everything's gone but that. Soft and round all over, isn't that what you dreamed of? Eating from a trough in front of my friends. That tiny little nub of a cock on show. Imagine being that humiliated. Can you imagine that, my piglet?"
"Harry—"
on it when he touches his hand to it.
"We haven't got all day, Draco."
"Yeah," Harry says. "Thought you’d like that. You getting filthy. Dirty Piglet." He pulls out of Draco’s mouth. "Wank me off, Piglet, and make me come all over your face."
"Show me," Harry says, and Draco obediently moves a little so that Harry can see the marks on the tile.
Draco goes abruptly quiet.
"Yes," Draco says, but they stay where they are for a little bit longer, in each other's arms.
"Yes," Draco says, and he watches as Harry presses into it with the cake fork, and comes out with a forkful for Draco to taste.
"Me, I believe," Draco says, equally pink. "Your debonair and sophisticated boyfriend."
"Yes," Harry says, but his hand is stroking up and down Draco's back, and they're still on the floor by the fireplace, lamp above them. It's dark in here. "Are you all right?"
"Up here," Draco calls back, and he shifts so that his cheek is resting against the floor and his hands are back where they should be, holding his arse cheeks apart so that he's presenting himself for Harry as he should be.
"Like anything," Harry says. "Things you masturbate thinking about, but it's like… it's just a fantasy. You don't want us to actually do it. Or not all of it."
Harry relents. "Another time. Would you like to do it again another time?"
"Good," Harry says, and they stay just where they are, together in Draco's flat, and around them, the music plays on.
Harry is inside of him and instead of moving, he's cupping Draco's cheek instead, shifting their positions so he can almost press a kiss to Draco's mouth.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Open your mouth," he says to Draco. "Get on with it."
Draco hums. He keeps his eyes closed. His limbs feel oddly heavy - not lethargic, not that, but like there's no impetus to move. There's just him, here, on his knees by Harry's side, and that's all there is. He hopes he can have it for a few minutes more.
Harry takes a bite of his sandwich. “Do you remember in first year, the philosopher’s stone?”
"What would happen if you weren’t?"
Draco hides his face in Harry's neck and holds on.
"How did you find this place?"
“I do,” Draco says. “I like everything we do.”
"You have permission," Harry tells him. "You have all the permission you want to eat exactly what you want. All the sweet things you need."
Draco, for want of something better to do, presses a kiss to the centre of Harry's chest. "My dick's even smaller in mine. Barely a dick at all."
Draco gives into it, this fantasy where he’s soft and stupid and nothing but an animal, a pig on Harry’s lead, and he tips his head back, groaning as Harry touches him, as Harry, naked now, crooks his finger in the loop on his collar, giving it a pull.
And Draco, so close to the edge, his cocklet twitching in Harry's fingers, does.
"Yes," Draco says, and he stands in his hallway in his socks and doesn't look at the stain on the tiles from where he liked to make a mess. "I want you to kiss me until I come."
"Our first time. Now, can I dress you, or are you planning on staying down there all day?"
"Nothing," Draco says softly. "A hole." He remembers the shame of the marriage mart, the silence of the invitations, the endless horror of not being wanted. The times he went down on his knees in his bathroom and begged to be used, to be forgotten and thrown away and uncared for. How it used to make him come.
Harry runs his finger over Draco's bottom lip.
Hermione rolls her eyes. "Ron and I thought that someone should give Draco the
"Wonders will never cease."
"Magic," Harry says, which doesn't particularly illuminate anything. "How soon do you reckon you'll be up for cake fucking?"
"Displaying yourself like an animal. And you love it. That useless little cock of yours is ready to come."
"Another?"
After that, it's easier to let go. To start to piss. It splashes against the trunk of the tree, and against the leg he's holding himself up on, and it's messy and dirty and he should hate it, he should, but he doesn't. He doesn't for a moment. It feels almost freeing to just give into this basest of animalistic urges, the very thing that separates man from beast. To be on the other side of the line.
"My piglet," Harry says softly, and Draco burns with it. "Stand up and take your clothes off, and fold them up on the sofa. Then get back down on your knees whilst I go and get your things. I'll be a minute. When I come back, you'll be an animal. A pet. Nothing."
"None so far," he says. "The house welcomes them."
"And you brought it here," Draco says. "To share it with me." He assumes that
Draco understands that about as much as Harry probably understands Draco's desperate need to serve. "You really like that?"
"One day I'll treat you like a real piglet," Harry says, still playing with his nipples with one hand, the other on Draco's hip as he slowly fucks up into him. "Make you sleep in the pet bed. Eat from the pet bowls." He pauses. "Go in the litter tray like animals do."
"You won’t want to."
"I don't know," Draco says. "I've always done it."
Harry tilts his chin so that he's looking up at Draco, who must appear sort of backwards and upside down from that angle. "I've applied to be a member of a Muggle club, if you must know. On behalf of us both."
She nods. There's another pause. "Harry said that the two of you had had a conversation."
Draco lets out a breath. “All right, then. Let’s make it happen."
"Funny way of hanging my clothes up, barricading me from my own bedroom and moving my furniture."
“Maybe,” Draco says. “And maybe what he did saved our world. But he used you to do it. His very own weapon.”
He does, in fact, need to use the toilet.
Something shifts a little in Harry’s face, and Draco shivers in anticipation. He recognises that expression. He loves that expression.
"Only good for being a hole, aren’t you?" Harry goes on, stroking Draco’s hair behind his ear. "I bet if there was a Quidditch practice here now, you’d go down on their knees for the whole fucking team, wouldn’t you?" He answers his own question. "Course you would. Because what are you?"
"Did it look like I wasn't enjoying it the first time?"
Harry strokes his hand into Draco's hair, and doesn't stop touching him until Draco can think straight again. Until he can feel the grass beneath his fingertips and beneath his knees and his toes, until the breeze touches his skin. He shifts so that his cheek is pressed to the ground, and he can look up at  Harry.
It's three songs later when Harry moves a little closer, and wraps his arms around Draco's neck as the woman on the record sings
doesn't get to come, Draco," Harry says. "In fact, Draco, coming wasn't allowed. Do you think you deserved to come when you'd arrived so late when I summoned you? When you arrived still dressed? Do you think dirty little piglets get to wear clothes when they're just a come rag?"
Draco makes a soft sound at the back of his throat.
Harry hums. "It's likely she's building up a picture," he says finally. "She knows we've talked. That we're still talking. She's fairly certain she knows I've started seeing someone. I think there's a good chance she'll slide it into conversation tomorrow evening when I'm over for dinner." There's a pause. "Is that all right? That she knows?"
"I love cock," Draco says, louder this time. "I'm a cockslut."
. The language of love has never been his for the taking, but Harry gives him it freely, and there's a part of him that's gathering every dropped endearment and gently folding them into a box in his head, for later.
"Stupid piglet," Harry says.
"Not like you might be thinking," Draco says. "But it's important." He's been thinking about this a lot since the weekend, and on and off for a while before then too. He doesn't quite know where to start. "I'm not very good at talking about my feelings."
He sits back, Harry's cock sliding out of his mouth. Harry's still so hard, and Draco whines. That's his job, making Harry come. He's not doing his job if Harry doesn't. He's not serving properly.
"That's right, darling," Harry says, "that's where you're supposed to be, isn't it? On your knees with a cock in your mouth."
"I'd do that a thousand times," Harry says, and he lazily wipes away another dribble from Draco's slit and holds it out from him to lick clean. "And each time you'd watch and know how useless your cock was. Except it's not a cock, is it? I'd forgotten. What is it, Draco?"
, Piglet. Do you know that?"
if it never opened up for you the first time."
“Yes,” Harry says.
"Just before we broke up," Harry goes on. "And when I say
as the third cake appears, balanced in Harry's hand. "But you can be."
"I don't respond to treats," Draco says, but as he's already out in the hall by this point, it lacks a certain conviction.
Draco chases the remaining cake around his food bowl, trying to nip at the last couple of pieces with his teeth. He ends up having to squash them against the side of the bowl with his nose, and it gets everywhere. But all the time, Harry's hand is on his little cock, a deliberately irregular, lazy rhythm. He gobbles up the last bits of cake, not caring at all that he's getting his face even messier, and that there's even cake in his hair. He rocks his hips down into Harry's lazy fingers, and he feels honestly like the stars might explode if he doesn't get to come soon.
"Go home and wank," the man says, and then he disappears back out of the door and into the main bar.
"I know," Draco says. "But that first time we talked, right back at the beginning, you said we could help each other out. We both needed something and we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. And I've been thinking about what you wanted, and what you asked for, and I don't think you're getting what you need."
Harry shakes his head. "No," he says. "You'll know when I ask you. This is just me wanting a thing."
"Always," Draco says, nodding.
Draco burns with his shame. Maybe the stars are exploding now, and this is what it feels like. His skin's on fire. He's messy with cake and come and sugar and humiliation. He crawls out of the way of his mess, a little wet patch of come on the tiles. His house is always spotless, and other than the mess around his food bowl, there's only one dirty bit, and it's where he's come on the floor.
"Food?" he suggests. "Comfort? Warmth? A game of cards? To be left alone?"
He drinks. He drinks.
"It's not a business arrangement anymore," Draco says.
"Because dirty little piglets don't get to wear clothes when they're just a come rag," Draco repeats. "And when they've got a stupid little cock."
"Yes," Harry says. "I really do."
"I don't want to want it."
. Draco's whole body hums with it. He nods, his skin hot. Harry drops another kiss to the back of his neck, then another.
"For you," he says. "Two toys for my brave boy."
Draco shakes his head, trembling. "No."
"I can still see you touching yourself," Harry says. "You think I can't see?"
speech, except it's clearly me. That's how Ginny broke up with me. Not that I disagree with what she said, but I think I can recognise it coming."
Harry’s smile is a little lopsided. His spell, when it comes, feels like a warm breeze over Draco’s skin. “Better?”
Draco shivers. He's tired of overthinking what it is that he and Harry do together. It might not work for anyone else, but it works for them. "You could feed them to me."
Not, Draco thinks, that he has any space for dignity in his life anymore. Not even close.
, filling him up, and Draco loves him. He loves him so much. "Make me come," he begs. "Fuck me and make me come."
"The shit stuff in particular," Harry says mildly.
"It's not a secret," Draco says, but he takes a rather larger gulp of wine than he was planning to.
There's a pause. Harry looks a little pink.
"Um," Draco says, which Harry seems to take as a wholehearted
Draco's mouth curves up at one side. He spells the door closed and locked behind them without looking. The charms are sensitive and complicated. Draco likes to feel safe in his own home. "Yes, sir," he says, once the final lock has slid gracefully into place.
Draco meets his gaze. "Yes," he says. "Sir."
"Yeah," Harry says. "But I asked you first."
"That's right. A lovely breakfast for a nice soft piglet."
Draco whines.
Draco's making soft, desperate noises at the back of his throat, his breath getting a little shorter as Harry keeps on touching him. It's hardly surprising; he's naked, outside, harnessed up like an animal, and it's so shameful he can barely stop himself from coming just at the thought of it.
"Naked and with a tiny, tiny cocklet," Harry says. "What else is there? What's the bit you can't tell me?"
Harry shifts so that he’s hiding his face in Draco’s neck. It’s a while before he says,
"Shame," Harry says. "If you don't ask for it, you're not getting it."
"Just popped in," she says breezily. "Draco made me tea."
Draco nods. He feels overwhelmed with it all, with where to put his feet and what he can touch and what on earth he's supposed to say.
Harry's skin is pink. He turns back the covers. "Are you getting in?"
sounds dirtier than
"You're absolutely not," Draco says. "At school you were completely oblivious."
"I'll make it," Draco says, because he wants to give Harry time to explore without being under Draco's watchful eye.
"I make you humiliate me so I can get off," Draco says quietly. "The things I want are shameful. What about any of that makes you think I deserve soft things?"
"Definitely too small to fuck me," Harry agrees. "So I might get fucked. You can watch if you want." He sounds casual, but Draco's not so certain he is. "If you're not too busy."
The door opens and it could be anyone, but it's Harry Potter.
The manor's been gone for years by now, sold off by his family who breathed nonchalance and a snooty,
Draco wants to rut against Harry's leg like he's been allowed to do before, but he stops himself. He stops himself. He hasn't been given permission this time, and he doesn't want to be bad for Harry. Harry, who called him pup. Who calls him piglet. He sinks down onto his knees, into the rug, and keeps his mouth around Harry's cock.
It's a disaster. There are unmatched socks and clothes with holes and missing buttons and snags. Before long he's got his sleeves rolled up and there's a pile of clothes that need mending on the floor by the bed. He never normally allows clothes on the floor, but he's been quick to decide that he's washing everything, then pressing it all. There's a pile of clothes that are too far gone to be saved - mostly threadbare boxer shorts, and there's a soft sound of disagreement from behind him, but Draco raises an eyebrow.
Draco’s hand stutters as he hands Harry his tea cup. "Harry."
"Hurry up," Harry says, and then there's only one bit of chicken left, and bread, and he's still chewing the bread as he sits back on his heels.
Harry tells him what he's allowed and not allowed to do, and Draco craves it. He fucking craves it.
He kisses the top of Harry's head, and opens the book to chapter one.
Harry nods into Draco's shoulder. He's panting into Draco's neck, hot and damp. He's had his mouth on Draco's dick.
Draco keens. "Please," he manages, because there's the blunt touch of a second finger against his hole, and it's teasing, promising, but not pressing inside of him. He wants to open his legs wide and show Harry just how desperate he is, just how needy he is, but Harry's knee is hooked over his, and he's anchored in place. He hadn't ever imagined the wet sound of slick fingers. "I want you inside of me. I want more of you. Please."
"Yes," he says, and Harry opens the tin and takes out a piece, drowning in icing sugar. He holds it to Draco's lips, and the sugar catches on his chin and falls like snow against his his cock.
Draco flushes. Oddly, he feels it, even with his cocklet on display and probably with chocolate smeared across his face. He nods, dropping his gaze.
“One of the people Hermione made me talk to, they said this thing,” Harry says finally. “The trauma people? You remember? I told you she made me talk to people. Do you know what being hyper-vigilant is?”
"A hole," Draco says, and he wants so desperately to rut against something, make himself come. Even the floor would do despite the chill. "A rag for your come. Nothing."
It's the middle of the night and Draco hasn't quite got it in him to get hard again quite so soon, but this time it isn't him that Harry's getting off. It's Harry himself, his hand circling his cock.
"And why's that?"
"All right," Draco says, and chooses not to think about what the hell they're doing.
It's a white chocolate casing with some kind of strawberry mousse within, topped with something that adds a little crunch. It's sweet and rich and melts against his tongue. He licks at Harry's fingers as he eats it, a soft, gentle whine at the back of his throat once it's finished and Harry's fingers are gone.
"Nah," Ron says. "More than my life's worth if Ginny thinks I've sent you away." He hands Draco a pile of papers, most of which are house plans and old notes receipts for charm work. "Sort it out, mate. Can't have wards trying to eat people." There's a pause. "Although if they wanted to do us one last favour, they could eat you on the way out."
"So, so desperate."
"Yes. My father liked to hide his money in things. Objects. And it turns out, places. We made a big song and dance about selling the Manor but it turns out we had all these other places. My mother hates Scotland. We barely ever went. I never wanted to go by myself, after."
Draco very deliberately doesn't allow himself to move. "I'll call you whatever you want to be called. And you don't have to decide now. It can be a placeholder."
"To beat you? Of course."
Harry stops in the doorway. He turns to look at Draco.
"So," Hermione says, curled up in the armchair by the gas fire. "Harry says you work with wards now?"
spell under his breath. It's another few moments before the familiar whoosh of something flying through the air and hitting Harry's palm with a smack. "Stay," Harry warns, one hand to the back of Draco's head, Draco's nose still touching the floor. "Going to put your collar on."
Harry doesn't hold his hands out or respond in any way at all, almost like he doesn't have any idea what it's like to receive a gift for no reason, and Draco takes that feeling and boxes it up nice and small in his head and resolves to deal with it later.
"Harry."
"It's a reason to say no," Harry says.
"Can you even see yourself?
"That and the fact you fuck boys in back rooms."
"This is, um--" Harry says. "Maybe I really am completely oblivious to everything that goes on around me."
"In case you get bored of watching me work," Draco says.
But Harry doesn't do anything. He just lets Draco lay there, still in his shirt and his trousers and his socks, his underwear wet and revolting with come.
He's never been big, always on the smaller side of average when soft, but whilst some people get bigger when hard, he's not one of them. His dick's small, and the second time he goes out, he kneels down in the back corridor and gets his dick out and one guy tells him his dick's fucking tiny. That he'd better have a good mouth on him or no one would ever go near him.
"Stay," he says. "I meant it. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
, followed by
Spit drips from the guy's cock, running down Draco's chin. He's so thick. He sucks him down, wanking his friend off with his other hand, squeezing him in his fist. Neither of them are quick. His muscles ache and he hasn't even got through his first two.
He's not going to last very long, but even in the nicest of circumstances Draco can always find something to feel ashamed of, even if Harry's smiling against his mouth, breath catching, and not that far from coming himself.
"See, this is why we didn't have swimming lessons at Hogwarts, isn't it?"
"I'm not entirely certain that's an answer."
"Can I stay?"
Draco comes, his useless little cock fucking up into his cake, Harry's arm pressed across his chest. He comes.
"It could be a big thing, though. And that would be all right."
“Perhaps,” Draco says, since he’s had a lot of time to think about how what Hogwarts might have done differently to avert the fracture in their childhoods. “What was your point?”
"There's cake," Harry says, opening the flimsy cardboard box. It turns out to be a bakery box, and inside is a cream horn, a vanilla slice, and a little fruit tart. "You always liked sweet things, didn't you? You were always getting sweets from your mum."
, Draco sends back.
"I think we've been going about this wrong. Or rather, I have, with you. With what you want. With what you need."
his bag across the room and gets out a small stack of books that he unshrinks back to normal size, helping himself to a cup of tea from the pot. He arranges himself so that he's comfortable, book on the arm of the sofa, one knee up so he's got a foot on Draco's mother's best sofa, the cup of tea resting next to him on the cushion.
"Can we do it again?" He doesn't want to ask.
"If Ginny knows how to turn him back and she hadn't, then yes, he'll still be blue until it fades. I suspect his children love it."
Harry glances at him. “Any reason for that? It’s glorious here.”
"Would you like that?" Harry asks again. "For me to make you be a statue, or an ornament? Something to be ignored? Part of the furniture?"
Upstairs in the bedroom, Harry sits on the edge of the bed, fully clothed, with the plate of cakes next to him. “Take your clothes off.”
"Harry," Harry says. "You call me Harry."
Harry turns around then, and to Draco's shock, he's crying, quietly and without inflection.
"I think we would have had a knockdown fight first. I hated you. Hogwarts Champion. You were always so special. Everything always happened to you."
"On what?"
“Get down on your hands and knees.”
"Straight away," Draco tells him. "Soon as I get through the wards."
"I like your china," Draco says finally. He doesn't really know what they are, really. They're both drinking from an identical mug, far bigger than anything Draco owns, and they both have a picture of a bottle of something called Gordon's, a drawing of a knee, a ginger otter, and the word
Draco hides his face in Harry's neck. "I never thought there'd be anyone for me. I never thought, not for a moment, that I'd ever meet anyone who understood any of the things that I wanted. No one wanted me even when I was just rich and marriageable. But you want me and you want these things too."
Harry raises his shoulders. "I'll tell you when I need it," he says. "But, just so you know, I'll tell you when I want it, and what I need, and if you can't do any of it, I'll offer a compromise. And if you can meet that, then you'll just walk away. No questions asked."
Harry doesn't say anything for a while. He turns away, cuts them both another slice of cake. Draco's is bigger. "Eat up," he says.
“Fuck that shit,” Draco says. He still has his hand around Harry’s shoulders, but he shifts his hand a little so that he can stroke Harry’s jaw. “Do you trust me?”
"It’s a rubbish charm."
"I bet you did," Harry goes on, stroking Draco's cheek. "My filthy boy, hey? My piglet."
"I don't know about that," Harry says.
"Not long, no," Draco says. "About 48 hours. Give or take."
"I know," Draco says. "You think we'd still be doing this if you were pretending? If you didn't at least enjoy giving me what it is that I need?"
The guy comes in Draco's mouth but he's already pulling out, and half of it hits Draco's chin.
"I am," Harry says, which doesn't explain the small velvet bag, barely the size of Harry's palm, and the lack of accompanying sweets.
"Go like that," Harry says, wandering into Draco's bedroom fifteen minutes later. The wards have let him in without complaint.
Draco's tired. It's the middle of the night and the wards recognised Harry and let him in. Maybe it's time for Draco to do the same.
means. Draco doesn't speak oik, and never has. "Then I invited him over and it was really very civilised. We had cake."
"Open the door, love," Draco says, ever-gentle, and Harry pushes the door open, and goes inside.
Draco considers for a moment. "I don't know," he says. "Maybe because I like looking after you."
"Why are you doing this?" Draco asks, after he's opened his mouth for another piece.
Draco has a list as long as his arm, but he chooses to remain quiet. Harry had chosen dark blue tailored trousers for him, almost a match for Harry's blue waistcoat, but topped off with a pale blue shirt and a soft navy sweater. Without a tie and a jacket or a robe, he feels practically naked.
"Yes," Draco says. He flushes. "I could keep your cock warm whilst you eat, if you'd like that."
“What a piggy you are,” Harry says, running his sticky hand through Draco’s hair. “Such a stupid, dumb piggy, aren’t you? Can’t think about anything but food and rubbing that tiny little nub of a cocklet on whatever you can find to get off on.”
"Because I'm a piglet," Draco says, and he's hard again. "I'm a filthy little piglet. I'm a come rag."
"What are you?"
Draco finds himself going red without his permission. "I thought you didn't want to. That's why I didn't say anything. I thought you weren't interested."
"We talked about me being an animal," he says finally, a little haltingly. Harry's eyebrows raise, but just a little. A momentary expression of interest. Draco plunges on. "Can I-- Can I be your pet today?"
Draco doesn’t particularly understand, but looking after Harry, whatever that encompasses, that doesn’t sound bad. "I’ll do it," he says.
resting on the arm, and unless Harry’s had time to go through the boxed up remains of Draco’s childhood that are hiding in one of the upstairs rooms, he’s brought that with him from home.
"You're looking after me," Harry says. There's a peculiar tone to it, but Draco doesn't let himself react. He puts the book down on the bed, close to Harry's hand, and goes to explore Harry's particularly terrible wardrobe and drawers.
Harry just smirks at him. "Always so careful."
"I've been waiting for my lunch."
She smiles at him. It looks kind of tired around the edges. "He needs something from everybody," she says. "He just doesn't have a clue what, and I could never figure it out. He won't let anyone in, and he never has. Not about the stuff inside his head. And he never takes anything he needs. He spends all this time trying to, just, I don't know. Do things for you. Give you his attention. Sometimes it's impossible to forget he grew up with nobody. I just felt guilty because for me it was always the wrong thing. He couldn't get me right."
"Some of your clothes require alterations. I can't make them without knowing your measurements."
"Sexy shame," Harry says.
"An animal." He wants to touch so much, wants to be dirty and come. He drops his hand back down to the floor. Maybe he is an animal. Maybe he shouldn't get to use his hands.
Harry's gaze is full of disdain. "Does it look like I want you?"
Draco's dick pulses with it, with Harry's lazy disengagement, his lack of care or attention. His second guy comes and pulls out. Draco sits back on his heels, breathless. He tries to stretch his jaw a bit.
"Good," he says. "Now be a good pet and stay by my side."
And Harry, with a breathless rock of his hips, does. Come stripes Draco's face, catching his lips, his cheeks, his jaw.
Draco's little cock is jutting out, his trousers a little tent over his tiny cock. There's no way Harry can't see how this is turning him on. He flushes even more.
"What are we doing?" Draco asks.
"I know," Harry says, and disdain spills from every syllable. "If this is what you’re like just wanking on your floor, what are you going to be like when you get to stick that useless cock into a cake? You’re going to fuck it, aren’t you? Get that icing everywhere. Show me how dirty you really are. How much of a piglet you really are."
Harry smirks at him from the other side of the carriage, where he's squashed in next to a tall woman in a headscarf and someone with tattoos on their face.
"Yes," Draco says, and Harry almost smiles at that.
"I'm sorry," Draco says, hesitating in the doorway. "I was at a meeting."
"Yes," Draco admits. "Please. I'll do that."
"Finish your cake, Draco. Take down the glamour, kneel on the floor, and present your hole to me like you're worth anything more than that. And afterwards, you can have another cake."
Harry swallows. "Maybe the chocolate cake." It's glazed with a rich ganache that's leaked over the sides and into the paper wrapping. There's no chance they can eat it without getting it everywhere, even with the cake fork Harry's materialised from somewhere or other. "If you'd like."
Harry pulls the blanket up and over them again, and lets Draco lick the cocoa from his fingertips.
"A dirty, come-hungry, cake-fucking piglet."
"You can't know everything, you've got to be careful with him--"
"Cool," she says. There's a pause. It's only a little bit awkward.
"Speak for yourself," Draco mutters, but Harry just rolls his eyes at him, and nudges him in the general direction of their dinner.
Draco runs his fingers over the keyring. It’s so warm.
He's just not entirely sure that Harry is.
"If you let me have a go at it, I'll charm you a bit more storage space," Draco says. "I imagine you like the size of it."
"Is he, um, going to be blue for long?"
"I'm soft," Draco says, after a while. "I'm soft all over. You don't ever tell me that I shouldn't be hungry or that I can't have more sweet things. You can't even see my little cocklet because of how big my tummy is."
"And what are you good for?"
“Surely not,” Harry says.
"No." Draco's head shoots up.
"I'm not sure I want to."
Draco adds a lot of milk, until his tea is milky and insipid.
"Be careful on the stairs," Hermione calls from upstairs, and then there's the pad-pad-pad of little footsteps on the staircase and a moment later, a little, curly haired girl stomps into the kitchen and only stops when she sees Harry and Draco in the doorway. She immediately wraps herself around her dad's leg and hides her face.
Draco wakes up first in the morning, and he has to extricate himself carefully in order not to disturb Harry from his sleep. He loses himself in the bathroom for a few minutes, morning absolutions to take care of, and then he dresses with an attention for detail, black trousers with the dark green stripe along the seam, matching black shirt. His underwear with
"There are certain expectations--"
"Tea would be lovely," she says, stepping inside. She's holding an umbrella, as if she walked down the road in the rain to come and visit him rather than just apparating. She spells it dry and does the same with the patch on the floor she's dripped on; Draco does not for one second glance in the direction of the mirror on the wall and the come stain on the floor. She takes off her overcoat and hangs it on the coat stand by the door, but stills at the sight of Draco's weekend bag. "You're going away?"
"Seems fitting," Harry says. "Did Ginny tell you anything else about me while you were hanging around and helping her exact sibling revenge?"
Harry drops down to his knees beside Draco. "I could do it," he says.
"I'm cursed with enthusiastic hips," he says lightly, but Harry's turned the box around, angling it so that Draco can take a better look. "Cakes cling."
Harry plays with his hair. "Are you all right?"
"I'd like," Draco says, and feels something akin to warmth settle down deep in his belly. "Come through, I've set out tea in the sun room."
Harry smiles at him. His eyes are soft. "I can imagine it," he says. "You'd be filthy.  Imagine if I came home one evening and found you like that, found you with your hands deep in a cake, covered in it. Masturbating."
Harry beams at him. "Good. That's what I thought. Now come and sit down, there's crumble and custard for pudding."
“What you can remember,” Harry says. “What can you remember seeing?”
"Is it not fun for you?" Harry helps himself to another cucumber sandwich. Draco suspects he’s doing his best not to look like he’s concerned.
He dresses carefully the following evening, perfecting the same glamour as the night before and choosing middle of the road clothes that don't identify him as particularly rich or particularly Draco Malfoy-esque. He eats a small meal of soup and fresh bread before leaving, and then steps over the stain on the tiles as he goes to put on his coat. He has no intention of cleaning it up any time soon; he deserves to be reminded of how far he's willing to fall.
“Was she nice to you?” Draco keeps trying to find these little pockets of kindness in Harry’s childhood, and he isn’t entirely sure why, given that they aren’t there.
Draco swallows. "Yes," he says.
Draco's cocklet grazes the cake, but Harry's other arm is around his chest and he can't press forward. Anyway, his cocklet isn't big enough.
"Open your mouth," Harry says, "may as well make use of one of your holes."
"Yes," Draco tells him, breathless. "
"I'll wank you off," Draco says.
"What kind of supper?"
Harry is waiting for him on the corner by the tea shop where they'd agreed to meet, hands in the pockets of his nice coat. He looks right through Draco at first, which gives Draco a bit of a jolt since he'd made the assumption Harry could see through glamours. If not that, then how on earth had he recognised Draco that first time, in the back of that bar?
"Eloquent," Harry says, but he doesn't sound settled. He sounds worried, but like he's trying to hold it in.
“Draco,” Harry warns. “Don’t.”
Draco nods. He'd never-- he hadn't considered that before. Frilly, humiliating, tiny underwear. Embarrassment all day long, even when he was going about his usual business, professional and calm.
“Always,” Harry says. He pulls the blanket up from the bottom of the bed and over them both, wrapping his arms around Draco’s chest. “Whatever you need.”
Draco blinks. "You can't have cake for breakfast."
Draco’s little cock aches to be touched. He crawls forward until he can nudge his face against Harry’s hand. He gets icing sugar on his nose even before he manages to take a bite; it’s harder to eat cake out of a crooked hand than it looks like. The cream goes everywhere.
His tiger shirt is already dirty and damp from something but he doesn't care. He fists his little cock, the tip barely peeking out of his fist as Harry gets fucked by a proper cock. By a proper man who doesn't get off on humiliation and shame and being used like this.
Draco grips the table until his knuckles turn white. The urge to go down on his knees and just take full advantage of what Harry Potter's offering him is just too fucking much.
"I'm desperate to be used," Draco says, skin going hot and pink.
"That's better." Harry sounds lazily satisfied. "Rub yourself off against the rug. No hands. I want to see how desperate you are."
"I know," Harry says, and this time he looks up. He rolls his eyes. "Why do you think I bothered sending for you? I had a use for a rag. Something to come on."
Draco’s mouth is busy, so he can’t answer.
When Harry follows him in, he's lost his knitted sweater, and is holding a little jar in one hand and the lid in the other. He sets it down on the chest of drawers, next to a flowered bowl on a little lace doily. Like the rest of the house, it must have been very much as Harry had found it when he'd first moved in.
, and then Harry pulls out.
"Can we vanish these clothes and never look at them again?"
"That's right, darling, I know you want that. Maybe we'll have to lock that little cocklet up at the same time. Can't have piglets rutting over all the furniture, can we? No, I think we need to think about a little cock cage, if they make them small enough for cocklets like yours. It's not good for piglets to come whenever they want to, anyway. It lets them get into bad habits. And we both know that you'll come on a sofa or a rug if you get the opportunity. Horny little thing, aren't you?"
"I wouldn't even notice you were there," Harry says, still watching him. "I've got a book to read. There's tea in the pot. Why would I be thinking about you?"
"Saving yourself," Harry says, finger crooking again. Draco's so wet, he can feel the warm slick of the ointment against his skin. Maybe it's charmed; Harry hasn't exactly helped himself to more. He'll ask later. Harry kisses him again. "All the dirty, filthy things that you want, and you never gave yourself this. I'll make you finger yourself in the mirror next time. Make you get yourself ready for my cock."
"You haven't got this wrong." Draco reaches up to cover Harry's hand with his own. They're both a bit messy now, and maybe he'll mind later on, but he can push it away for now. "I love my mother. I know you have a lot of very justifiable reasons for not liking my parents, but I can't hurt my mother. Not again. I broke her heart, Harry. I didn't even mean to but she was so… she believed so strongly that I was worth something. That even after everything I was -" he stopped. It hurt. "I was marriageable. And when the days just kept on passing and it was clear that I wasn't, that no one wanted me, she kept on hoping far longer than I ever could. I broke her heart. I know this doesn't mean anything to you. Virginity. My virginity. I don't want it to mean anything to me, but it does, because it means something to my mother. If I take you for tea with my mother, she'll think it's the equivalent of, of
It won't take him long to come and he doesn't try to hold his orgasm off. Coming somewhat prematurely, Harry getting to know how easy and desperate Draco is, is better than trying to hold out. Harry's mouth is slack, maybe because he knows Draco's so desperate to be touched that he doesn't need to be the effort in. Draco loves the idea of Harry being lazy and careless with him, of making Draco the afterthought. He's going to come, just from Harry's mouth on his little cock and the very idea of Harry using him.
over for dinner, then his boyfriend is very welcome here."
"That's right," Harry says. "Nothing important. You can't fuck me with it, can you? What's the only think you can fuck with it?"
Draco tears his attention away from Harry and towards the bar. It's not busy tonight, but there are people sitting around them, people chatting, the telly box on above their heads, some kind of weird sport thing on where people ran around in shorts like they'd never heard of dignity.
"What?"
but it's somewhat of an exaggeration," he says. "I mostly want to serve you."
"Whose piglet are you?"
"There are others," she goes on, "that rather wish we'd never been together at all. Those people should best be kept at arm's length as well."
"No," Harry says.
Draco, for want of something better to do, promptly sits down in the middle seat on the sofa. Hermione and Ron have a
"Thirsty?" Harry asks.
"I don’t know," Draco says. He thinks about it for a second. "Maybe I’d just stand up and go and make a cup of tea. Tell you I wasn’t particularly interested."
Hermione hums. "There aren't that many people out there who are good at that."
Harry hides his face in Draco's skin. "I like how it feels."
"I brought wine," Draco says, because he has, and because he doesn't particularly want to draw attention to how much he's floundering. He doesn't know where to put himself. He's walked directly into the
"Do you want something?" Harry asks.
Now this, Draco thinks, is just what he wanted, and it feels incredible. Shame courses through him, humiliation at its tail. He wanks the stranger until he comes on Draco's face, splashing across his mouth and his chin and his jaw.
"I thought we could have a bath," Harry says. "A place this big, there’s got to be a bath big enough for two. My aunt and uncle had one of those corner baths, you know? It was beige. They had a whole beige bathroom suite. Pot pourri bowl to match and everything."
"My soft little piglet. How about I ask you some questions, and you say no if you don't want to do them? Do you want to eat off the floor?"
Then Harry slips the tip of his finger inside of Draco, and Draco's entire world has to realign after the sound that comes out of his mouth.
"As far as I understand it, it's the kind of club where I could take you naked and in your collar, and no one would bat an eyelid." There's a pause. Harry's eyes are bright. "We obviously don't have to go. But I thought you might like the shame of it."
“Did I get it right?” Harry asks later, when Draco’s drifting in and out of sleep, even though he’s never gone to sleep naked and he should get up and put some pyjamas on. “Was that what you wanted?”
"Don’t ask," Draco says, as Harry makes a questioning face at a giraffe staring out of one of the filthy windows.
"You're my fucking come rag," Harry says, undoing his jeans and shoving them down to his hips. "And I wanted a wank. Get down."
He offers Harry half a smile. "I rather suspect there are more properties on the continent than I currently know about. There are two that will come to me. My mother has the run of them. I think she has a place in reserve too; my father taught her well."
"You can make me a better one."
"Well? Don't just stand there. Lie down on the floor. Face down, does it look like I want to look at you?"
"Does it look like I care?" Harry says, and he still doesn't look at him. "I wanted a wank. Come here."
, and Draco's arranged the sheets over the top of them both, that Harry rests his cheek on Draco's shoulder and hugs him.
The song, when it starts, is mostly piano, and then a woman starts to sing,
"Yes," Draco says. "I want your cock in my mouth."
"I'm so dirty," Draco says, and inexplicably he can feel himself getting hard again.
"You're my piglet now."
"That's right, Piglet, isn't it? Just a rag for me to come on. Just a hole."
Draco’s never talked to anyone. He just gradually closed himself off from the world until it was just him by himself, and a set of glamours through which he tried to interact with a world he wasn’t a part of. "Did they help?"
And Harry, flushed pink and breathless, still coming down from his orgasm, bites his lip and smiles.
"You'd masturbate anywhere if I told you to, wouldn't you? And you'd like it?"
"There aren't any," Harry says, and he's still moving, to a rhythm that's entirely different to the one on the record. It's charming, if ridiculous. He holds his hand out. "But no one's watching so it doesn't matter."
Harry doesn't say anything to that. He reaches out and strokes his fingers down Draco's arm instead. "Maybe we can work something out."
"Shut up," Harry says, patting Draco's thigh. "There's a good boy."
Harry presses him back against the wall and slides his knee in between Draco's legs. "What about me?"
"Do you like After Eights?" Harry asks, without bothering to decant them out of the box and onto a little plate.
"Good boy," Harry says, as Draco crawls across the grass. It's wet beneath his knees and his feet. The wind catches at his skin, but the warming charm is a good one -- almost as good as Draco's own, and Draco is exceptional at charms -- and the cold doesn't touch him.
“Not really. I can make a guess.”
. He loves him and it's terrible and he kisses him again, breath catching in his throat, tearing at his chest. Draco is unlovable, because his mother doesn't count and his father's dead and there's never been anyone else. He's unlovable but Harry treats him like that's not true, like what he wants is all right, like what he needs isn't the most disgusting thing in the world.
Draco hovers the tea tray, and together they follow it down the hall to the sun room. It’s not really sunny outside but it makes sense to enjoy the view. "Strange kind of additional extra," he says finally, waiting for Harry to sit down before he sits down next to him on the sofa.
"Babying," Harry says. "Humiliation and sweets."
"I've already told you," Harry says. "I'll give you what you need."
Harry looks helplessly confused. "You're not breaking up with me?"
"Need to be touched, don't you? Need to be used."
They're in public. There's no one close enough to hear, but shame courses through Draco.
Draco apparates home and doesn't even bother heading for his bedroom. He takes all his clothes off instead, standing in the hallway in front of the mirror with his dick erect.
Draco looks up. A free-standing mirror appears in the kitchen right in front of him, and Draco is faced with the reality of what he looks like, flushed and messy and covered in cake. He looks wanton and overwhelmed and so desperately, desperately turned on. He whines.
, he's just a hole, and Harry knows just how to use him and make it perfect. He sucks Harry until his own little nub of a cock is stiff again, until Harry is so close to coming that Draco can
"Nice," Draco says, but Harry's slipping his hand down between them and cupping Draco's dick and balls.
Harry touches three of the sets in turn. "Not much give in these," he says. "They don't look very comfortable."
Draco's hand stills in Harry's hair. "Potter."
Harry slips his hand into Draco's. "I know it's early days. I know what we do isn't conventional. It doesn't mean it isn't exactly what we should be doing to make each other happy."
“Too stupid to know what I’m asking, aren’t you?” Harry reaches for another piece of cake, breaking off a piece of lemon cake and holding it out for Draco to eat. Draco tilts his chin up, trying to eat it off Harry’s hand, but Harry moves his hand away so that Draco has to follow it. “But you’re not too stupid to follow the food.”
"I want to," Harry says. "I think I'll always want to."
Draco wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. "Yes," he says, and he stretches out his shoulders. His little dick's still jutting out, stiff and hard. His legs ache from being locked in the same position for so long. He flushes.
"What are you?" Harry asks, still leaning lazily against the door frame.
"I haven't taken you out in public for a while," Harry goes on. "I know you want people to see you. I know that there's a part of you that wants that."
"Please," Draco says again, but it's quieter this time, breathier. His dick's pressed up against the zip of his ugly, mediocre chinos.
Harry grins, and disappears off to find his way around.
"I don't think I could be any more serious about Draco if I tried," Harry says. He's staring Hermione out, and she's staring back. There are endless years of friendship battling in that stare, and Draco can't help but be on the outside. He hasn't had a friend in a very long time. "I thought you understood that."
"Stop whining and wank me off," Harry says, and Draco's half way through thinking up a clever response when Harry kisses him again, covering his mouth with his own and cutting off any further attempts at witty repartee. Not that it matters too much, because Draco's focus is on his hand around Harry's cock, and Harry's hand around his, and he's groaning into Harry's mouth as they kiss, and touch, and rub up against each other.
, except--
"Make a mess of the rug, Malfoy, like the filthy pig you are."
"It's all right," Draco says. "They're looking out for you. I wouldn't trust me either. And as far as I understand, having people care for you is a nice thing, so stop looking like you've stepped in something nasty."
But still. He shows up in Harry's vestibule after apparating, just as himself, but dressed down.
"Well," Harry says. "Look up, Piglet."
"You need it," Harry says.
"Because you can, you know. If you want to."
"I'm a dirty piglet," Draco says. "Can I wank? I want to come."
Heat sweeps through his body, heat and desperate, intense joy. Harry's mouth is on Draco's dick.
"Nice," Harry says, looking around and nodding. "Small. Easy to maintain."
Draco nods, trying to take Harry's cock in his mouth. Harry holds him back, smirking, and that smirk makes Draco tremble with shame, even now.
"I know you know." Harry strokes his thumb over Draco's cheek, then his jaw. "I love you."
"My dirty piglet," Harry says, stroking his hair. "My filthy little animal."
"I know," Draco says. "I used to think about that a lot."
"Yes, well," Draco says. "So am I. For the most part. But not many people tell me that, so thank you."
"Sometimes," Draco says. "Magic seeps into the brickwork. Sometimes it doesn't want to spit it out. Sometimes it's full."
Harry tilts his chin up, shifting position a bit. "Me and you? I like boyfriend."
"Not tonight," Harry says. He shifts a little, his cheek pressed to Draco's shoulder.
"No," Draco says, and Harry’s so close, Draco can tell. His hips rock up. Draco moves his hand faster, opening his mouth. He doesn’t want to miss a taste of Harry’s come. Draco’s such a fucking come-hungry piglet.
"Yes," Harry says. He's still stroking Draco's back. "Be brave."
"Piglets are seen but not heard," Harry says, and he steps past Draco and sits down on the edge of the bed, "Get up here and lick my cock clean."
"About me…?" Draco trails off deliberately.
"I suspect his diary might involve a prior engagement."
. They're soft and stretchy and have
"Do you think? Not sure about the waistcoat. Might be a bit beyond dinner with Ron and Hermione, but I wanted to."
"You should be more weirded out."
"I do," Draco says. "Make me wait."
"For you to be happy, and get what you need," Harry says, and Draco can't look at him after that.
"I never did like following the rules," Harry says, sneaking his cold hands under Draco's pyjama shirt. "You changed your wards."
"I want to be softer," he says, thinking about those Muggles on the front of Harry's magazines, the ones with barely any clothes on, and the before pictures that Draco sees himself in, all sharp edges and hollow spaces where he wanted there to be sweet things and kindnesses and Harry feeding Draco in bed with his little cocklet standing to attention. "I don't want to look like I used to look. I don't want--" he stops, and presses his cheek to Harry's warm, messy palm. "We can both have what we want."
Harry makes a noise that sounds a little disapproving, and Draco shivers with it. "So dirty."
Draco hastens to obey, unbuttoning his trousers and pushing them down. His underwear follows. His little cock juts out, already hard.
"Us," Harry says. "No need to be ashamed."
"That's good," Draco starts, but Harry is rubbing his nose over Draco's collar.
"Did we have plans?" Draco asks, stepping back and into the entrance hall. He hasn't been home long, because the best part of his day has been spent arguing with idiots who have been trying to do their own wards for years, and who have ended up with one of their teenage children almost being eaten by the dining room fireplace. He's bored of stupidity, and had planned an evening in his mother's sitting room with the lamps turned down low, a book, and - most decadently - a small box of hand made truffles he'd gone out of his way for on the way home.
"My very own man," he says, and he reaches for another chocolate, and lets Draco lick it from his fingers, the chocolate melting over their skin. He offers Draco another one, and another one after that, and his fingertips are covered in chocolate and Draco imagines he is too; the chocolates are too warm not to melt the moment they're in contact with skin.
"You know something, though. There's something you want."
"You don't care about virginity. It doesn't mean anything. We've done practically everything but, anyway."
"Getting there," Harry says, and maybe Draco shouldn't be so forward, but Harry doesn't resist as Draco pulls him closer, and slides his hand over Harry's stomach, over his pyjamas. Possessive.
"You can," Draco says, "but I'm here to serve you." It sends a frisson of heat down his spine that he doesn't allow himself to focus on. "I'm here to look after you."
Harry disappears out of the room again. "There's something on the bed for you," he says, and when Draco turns around, he expects it to be clothes, but it's not. In the middle of the bed there's a box, circular and small.
"Just a hole, aren't you, Piglet? Just a hole."
Harry doesn’t move, and he doesn’t look at him, and he doesn’t say anything.
"Yes,
Draco wakes first in the morning, and rather than wake Harry up too, he slips out of bed and into the small bathroom to dress. It's cold outside, the clouds heavy, the sea grey. He stands on the little rocky beach with his hands in his pockets and lets the wind wake him. It blusters against his skin and through his jumper, whistling past him as it buffets Harry's little cottage on its way inland. It's cold and overcast, but Draco feels nothing but bright, unbridled joy.
Draco just nods. It makes his skin burn just thinking of it. The shame and the humiliation and the burning, burning need to come.
"It's all right to want a break."
Harry steps back, next to Jonathan, who doesn't look particularly impressed.
Draco glances at him. "Lunch?"
"And what are you?"
Harry's hand stills. "Draco--"
"Doesn't save us from doing it entirely," Harry says. "But we can still serve ourselves potatoes out of the pan. How many would you like?"
"Wank in front of the mirror," Draco says. "Say I deserve to be covered in other people's come, that I'm just a rag for them to come on. Wank my useless dick."
"Masturbate on it," Harry says, without paying him any real attention. "Come all over it, Piglet." And then he goes over to the kettle to make himself another cup of tea.
"It's all right," Draco says. "It's all right, love. You can stop this at any point. We don't have to do anything. Just let me show you what there is for you, when you want it."
"Please," he says. He's not sure what he's asking for. "I'm not sure Harry needs anything from me."
"Harry, darling. It's all right. It's just a hug. It's just being held. We don't have to do anything else. But I am going to find a way so that you don't have to try so hard anymore."
"I love that," Harry says, and he reaches past Draco to the box on the bedside table. It's from a cake shop, and when he opens the lid, there are four slices of cake inside. "This one's a pecan caramel brownie. That one's the… cherry amaretto cake, I think. This one's a lemon chiffon, and this one's a Bailey's chocolate cake."
"Useless," Draco repeats. "Your piglet's useless little hole."
There appears to be some confusion over where Harry is sleeping, with Draco making the obvious assumption that Harry would like a guest room of his own.
“Should I let you on the bed for once, do you think?” Harry asks, smearing cream into Draco’s hair. “Do you deserve that, my stupid piggy?”
"Are you looking for gossip?"
"Neither have I. Would you like to?"
Draco rolls his eyes, and taps the papers in his hand. "I believe you have a job for me to do?"
"It isn't something I want us to do. It's not an endgame for what we do."
"A come-hungry little piglet," Draco says, his cock leaking.
"Harry--"
Draco, who had planned to spend the evening in Scotland making adjustments to the nursery, changes his plans accordingly, and waits in for Harry instead.
. His father would actually turn over in his grave. Somewhere on the continent, his mother has just stood up for no reason at all and doesn't know why.
"You look lovely," Draco says. "Very handsome."
"I can't see your scarf," Harry says. "I'm sorry."
Draco ducks his face into his food bowl, and chases a bit of cake around the bowl, sugar getting everywhere.
"Of course," Draco says.
"Be nice," Harry says. He touches Draco's elbow. "Give Ron the wine, and whatever else you've brought him, and then we can move on to the part of the evening where we all get mildly sloshed. It'll be better then. Where's Hermione?"
"Language," Draco says, but it's gentle. "Come on, my lovely boy."
"Get a move on," someone yells from behind him, and there's a
"I've got it under control." It's so obviously a lie. Draco can't help but wonder how much Harry knows that. "I'm trying."
"No," Draco says, and his heart’s pounding. "Have you finished? Shall we just go?"
"You were," Harry agrees. "And I was obsessed with you."
And Draco, desperate, humiliated, and so turned on he can barely see straight, cries out, and comes.
"I'm not Draco," he says, but it feels fairly useless at this point.
"Yes," Draco says, and he waits as Harry processes that, turns it around in his head.
Harry's hands leave his hair, but then he's reaching beneath him and touching Draco's stomach. "You're getting softer," he says. "Getting a bit of tummy on you, aren't you? All those sweet things. All these lovely bits of cake you're enjoying."
Draco hums around Harry's cock, and Harry's fingers card through his hair.
"What are they," Draco says, because he has to say something.
"Come on," Harry says, and then he's sweeping Hermione out of the kitchen. Draco is reminded that Harry has a life outside of him, where he can be forceful and have people listen to him when he speaks.
Harry looks oddly like he's about to cry. Draco's never seen him look like that before.
"I’d like."
Harry, laughing, waits until they’ve almost landed before he pushes Draco off his broom. "Cheat."
"Sit down, Draco," Harry says. "Be good."
"Harry."
"I don't understand you," Draco says. "I don't understand us."
"Oh yes," Harry says lazily. "I’d forgotten for a second how fucking useless that dicklet of yours was. Useless and tiny."
in purple ink.
He knows he doesn't deserve it. He's never deserved any of it. It doesn't mean he doesn't want it with every last fibre of his being.
"All right," Draco says. His head’s spinning a bit. "I’m still doing it. I’m going to look after you."
He works hard not to betray his surprise on his face. He's had years of experience of presenting a mask to the world at large, though, so this shouldn't be any different. He opts for, "Did he?"
"This is just like the place I grew up," Harry says, shoving his hands in his pockets. "Same size and everything. God, can you imagine what my uncle would have done in a place that had

That squiggle afterwards could be anything.
it said.
"Should put you on the lead," Harry says. "If that’s the only way to make you remember that piglets should be on their knees."
"I’d forgotten how little it was," Harry smirks. "Totally fucking pointless. No, don’t touch it. Kneel down. Suck a real cock."
"Just not so young anymore," Harry agrees, squeezing Draco's hand. "And all the emotionally healthier for it."
Harry waits until they're half way down the road before he stops, turning around. "Can I buy you more than the bowl?"
"I'm not being rude," Ron says, holding one hand up. He'd clearly hold both hands up if he could, but one of them's holding wine so he's a bit less casual with his arms. "I'm genuinely asking. Mate. You used to call him your nemesis."
"It’s like you. Likes to be the centre of attention."
Draco smiles then. He loves doing this, really getting to look after Harry. He starts with his jumper, following it with his shirt, and then sitting him down so he can unlace his boots and take off his socks. He follows it with his unbuttoned trousers and then his underwear, until Harry’s naked. He’s half hard, but doesn’t look particularly like he’s interested in following it up just yet. He doesn’t get into the bath, instead urging Draco to get undressed too. Draco’s clothing is more formal, with buttons across the collar bone and elsewhere. He undoes them himself, but at Harry’s urging, and drapes them over a chair back. He likes bathrooms that have chairs, and if he had it his way, they all would. This one is a bit rickety and old, but then most of the leftover furniture is. They’d been down on their luck, the previous incumbents. Maybe his father did them a favour in ridding them of their ancestral pile, but Draco can’t imagine that they saw it like that.
"And you couldn't show me quick enough. Desperate, you were." He pauses. "Show it to me now, again. Take down the glamour and show it to me again."
"I like it," Harry says, chin tilting up.
"Would you like that?" Harry ask.
"I might even make you crawl around the house," Harry continues. "I think you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
Draco isn't, hasn't got a consultancy project on the books at the moment, but how Harry knows that, Draco doesn't know. Harry zips up his trousers, and he's smirking. It makes Draco feel more ashamed, if that's possible, and he doesn't make any move to put his own cock away. Harry must guess what he's thinking, because he just shakes his head.
"I haven't flown in a while," Harry says. He seems a little surprised by that.
"You shameful creature," Harry says, hand fast on his dick, "you dirty little piglet."
"Why's it hard?" Harry's still masturbating, hand fisted around his cock.
Draco whines again. The idea of Harry making him come over and over again, and being made to sit in it, sit in his shame, is making him so hard.
He steps out into the grass and Draco follows on his hands and knees, a little hesitant. He's never really been one for being dirty outside of the house - late night humiliations aside - and even when he was a small Malfoy, outside with his mother in the gardens at the manor, he'd played games that kept him clean and the gardens neat. Quidditch had been his one accepted exception, and his mother had never really approved. Quidditch had been his father's domain.
"I bought you chocolates," Harry says, in between kisses. "How about you let me feed them to you?"
Draco's heart pounds. To be so ignored, to be
"Fuck most people," Harry says, and he kisses Draco again. And again. Then - "Please don't think you have to eat the bread if you'd rather just eat that box of chocolates you've hidden down the side of the sofa."
"All that tea at breakfast," Harry says, slipping his fingers into Draco's hair. "It's gone right through me, Piglet."
She's not staying in the house, not whilst it's unwarded, and she comes out with him to the gate. She doesn't apparate first, waiting for him to go, so he nods his good bye and apparates home, the coin already warm in his hand.
Draco has to stop resting on his hands for that, leaning forward so that his cheek's resting against the tiles as he reaches behind himself to pull his arse cheeks apart. Harry can probably see Draco's useless little cock hanging between his legs too, leaking pitifully onto the floor like the desperate, filthy piglet he is.
Draco knows when to be obedient. He crawls onto the bed, following Harry’s little cake treat mouthfuls, until he’s lying on the bed with his head on the pillows and he’s licking cake off Harry’s cupped hand.
There's a shimmer, and a breath of warmth, and then the door changes. There are words on the door this time, a child-like pattern made of toy bricks. It spells out 'Harry's Room'.
"What part of the chicken is a nugget?"
"You know this place better than me. Find us a bathroom."
"Course you can do it, Potter."
He takes a deep breath. "Hey," he says. "Harry, can we talk?"
“You like that, don’t you, stupid piggy?” Harry shifts back until he’s kneeling over Draco’s thighs. “Being tied up like the dumb animal you are.”
"Flip-flops," Harry says. "He loves a flip-flop."
"I felt..." Draco searches for the right word, and fails to find it. "I felt good," he says finally. "I liked it."
"Imagine if everyone at school could see you now," he says, and Draco can't help but shiver, even as Harry's hand slips into his hair and presses him closer to the ground. "Imagine if this was the entrance hall at Hogwarts, and everyone was coming in and seeing you like this, licking the floor clean." His fingers tangle in Draco's hair. "They wouldn't know, would they? Seeing you like this, just how dirty you are. Half of them wouldn't even be able to see that you've got your cock out. Too many clothes on, haven't you? Too many clothes for my piglet."
Eventually, Harry nudges him back and onto his heels.
Draco smiles at him. "Do you like them? They're yours now."
Draco almost blinks three times just so he can wear them right now. His eyes plead with Harry, but Harry just turns his attention to his big Muggle book of pictures.
"It's weird."
"Can we be friends, do you think?" Harry asks. "You and me?"
," Harry says.
"Right," Draco says, cutting the crusts off. "Of course."
"Do come in," he says, when she doesn't break the silence. "Would you like some tea?"
"Do you want to come over here so I can put my cock in one of your holes? That's what you are, isn't it? Just holes."
"And what do you believe in?"
"No," Harry says. "I love you. I
"Come on," Harry says. "Up you get, come lay up here for a minute before we go and get you cleaned up."
And waits.
"Do you remember when you took me to the bar, and you told that man to come on my tits?"
"Never before she left," Draco says quickly. "Only since then."
"New look today?" Harry asks, looking him up and down.
He drinks a glass of wine standing on the terrace in the cold before going to bed, and doesn't let himself dream about calling the castle
"It's smaller," Draco says. "And I'm your piglet."
"And I'm filling you," Harry agrees, breath hot against Draco's skin. He nips at Draco's shoulder with his teeth, arm wrapped around his chest, anchoring him close. Draco craves closeness, he craves intimacy, and Harry is holding him so tight that Draco can barely breathe, and it's perfect. "Making use of you."
"I don't have anything to wear," Draco tells him, discarding yet another shirt onto the bed. He'll have to re-press everything he's taken out of his wardrobe as everything he owns is currently stacked on his bed, gaining creases at a rapid rate. Unacceptable.
"Tell me how many times a day you masturbate."
"I want it," Draco says. And he does. He
"Someone's got to stop me from taking off with the silverware," Draco says. He waits a beat, but Ron doesn't say anything else, and certainly not a thank you. He's had the little notification from Gringotts that the deposit has gone into his account now that he's marked the job as complete. Time to go. "Excuse me."
“Put them on the floor by your pet bed,” Harry says, and Draco’s little cock is already hard at the idea of his furry piglet bed, all lined up by the wall.
"Have you ever brought anyone else here?" Draco asks, as Harry brings the radio into the living room, followed by the stew.
Harry gives him half a smile. "I dunno," he says. "I used to watch you on that map all the fucking time. I didn't watch anyone else."
“I could make you sleep in your pet bed. Not let you in the proper bed. Treat you like an animal all weekend.”
"This," Harry says, and so Draco gives him what he wants, and hugs him in the sitting room with Harry's discarded underwear by their feet, and Harry's hot breath against his skin. "I just want this. Just for a bit."
Harry looks at him. "Why?"
, Draco thinks.
"I don't know," Harry says. "We compromise."
The room isn't quite what he's expecting, if only because he's never allowed himself to put much thought into what Harry Potter's bedroom must look like, other than assuming there would be some kind of reddish-gold lion theme. There's not explicitly a reddish-gold lion theme, although there is a red armchair by the window that's mostly being used as an extension of his wardrobe, judging by the amount of clothes hanging off it.
"My piglet," Harry says, and then he's sliding his cock inside of Draco, and it's tight and hot but so, so slick, and Draco's brain is crying out for more, and for the first time in his life he's being fucked but all he can think about is the humiliation and the love that Harry's offering him, both so intwined that he couldn't pick them apart if he tried. "My tiny, humiliated piglet."
"Let your tongue hang out," Harry says, bored. "You are an animal that eats off the floor, after all."
"You seem to like coming in your pants," Harry says, like he's just thinking about it. "Maybe one time I'll make you come over and over again, and make you sit in your mess all day. If you like being dirty, maybe you deserve it."
