“Do you want me to stop?” Potter kissed Draco’s neck, nibbling at his jaw and scraping his teeth playfully across the smooth skin. Draco let out a soft moan, his mouth falling slightly open.
Draco turned towards the source of the noise to find Potter and Weasley each bent over their own cauldron, shoulders shaking with laughter.
And to Draco’s further confusion and utter shock, Potter stands up from behind his desk and takes the remaining few steps of distance between them to stand right in front of Draco.
“So,” Harry stepped closer, rubbing his hands together for warmth. “You’re going home for Christmas?”
“You took so long,” 18 hours. Draco looked at him – his sagging shoulders, the bags under his eyes and the way he was holding himself; like he was trying not to sway on his feet in exhaustion – and sighed. “Another emergency?”
, and the decisions it can drive people to make. War’s not a pretty thing, but we’re not at war anymore. So I think we should stop acting like it.”
Before Draco could register the shout of warning, he was fiercely yanked away by the back of his robes and he yelped in horror as a black Bludger flew past his head close enough to ruffle his hair and fast enough that it would have smashed his skull flat had it not been for the hand that had yanked him away just in time.
Draco opened his eyes with a long gasp and shot up to a sitting position on his bed, breathing heavily. He’d had the strangest dream last night, but he couldn’t remember what it had been about. Waiting for his mind to catch up with his body, he checked the tiny clock on his mahogany nightstand.
And Draco knew that life was going to have its ups and downs for him, it wasn’t going to stay like this forever. He knew that there were going to be moments, hours, or days in the future that the happiness would fade away, or even completely vanish. But he had Harry by his side, his presence a sure and steady weight holding Draco in place as the storm passed, and they would survive those days together.
Suddenly, Draco can’t take it anymore. He grits his teeth, stands up and throws his backpack over his shoulder. “I’m fine, Pansy. I don’t need a distraction.”
“How can I help you, sir?” Borgin squinted at Draco from behind the counter. Draco pulled the hood of his black cloak back to reveal his face.
Draco felt his face heat. “Whatever, Potter,” He muttered, putting on the fluffy jumper over his thin toga and instantly appreciating the warmth it brought. The jumper’s sleeves were too long for Draco’s arms, and it smelled like Potter. Draco didn’t want to give it back.
Draco was panting heavily, his legs spread on either side of Harry body and his cock already leaking with precome. He watched, hungrily, as Harry pulled off his blue jumper and then his toga. He leaned in for another kiss and Draco – allowing himself the pleasure of tangling his fingers in that unruly mess of black hair – impatiently removed the crown of green laurel leaves from Harry’s head, tossing it aside.
When Draco turned, the spot was already empty, but he knew who Potter was referring to. MacMillan was playing Beater for the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff team today, and he still very much hated Draco’s guts. Draco sighed.
Draco slowly turned his baffled expression to the head attached to that hand to find Potter – just as terrified as himself, but also furious – looking back at him.
“How do you feel about Ron’s idea?” Potter asked softly. “I know that we promised to lay low with this when we first started dating. And we’re obviously not going to do it if you don’t want to,” he hastily added. “But I don’t think it’s such a bad idea. It might actually get Rita and the cheap tabloid journalists off our back,” Potter shrugged, green eyes searching Draco’s face expectantly.
be good if yours weren’t such a shitty one, but,” she put a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “None of us really blame you for it.”
to each other for the first time in the whole seven years that we’ve known one another; I began to realize just how much the two of us really have in common. I felt actually
Potter gives Draco a very bored eye roll before turning his head to address Pansy once again. “Well then, I think I made it very clear that I’m only doing this if the person is also willing. So…” he gives a casual shrug and turns around to go back to his seat.
? No!” Pansy made an annoyed sound. “The Halloween party we’re having in the Chamber of Secrets! The one we’ve been decorating that place for, for days! Honestly, what’s wrong with you today, Draco?”
deserve it. I want you to never forget that, okay?” He whispered into the private space between their lips.
As soon as they sat down at the Slytherin table, Draco grabbed Pansy by the hand, pulling her closer so no one else could hear what he was about to say. “Pans, tell me about my father. How’s he?” he whispered.
was how he really looked at the situation. And then, even more surprised as to why he hadn’t realized it sooner.
“It’s just…” Potter tucked his hands into the pockets of his blue jumper. “It gets physically painful sometimes, how much I love you.”
Books in hand and bag thrown over one shoulder, Draco was making his way through the narrow corridors of the dungeons towards the Slytherin common room when he heard heavy footsteps descending the stone steps behind him, and he slowed down, hand sliding into the pocket of his robes and wrapping around his wand in reflex.
But the beautiful fantasy floats away just as easily as it’d come and Draco shakes his head briefly, trying to clear the fog out of his mind and the feeling of sinking ships off his heart. “That’s…” he breathes out and a huff of humorless laughter escapes out with it. “It’s still not enough. There are things that people just can’t forget. Even people like Potter. He might have forgiven me but I doubt that he’d be willing to actually… be with someone whose aunt was responsible for the death of his godfather.” Draco clutches the edge of his book so hard his fingertips go white, the words scratching his throat as they come out of his mouth.
,” Draco let out a loud whine as without further warning, Harry pushed inside him with a deep thrust.
Later that night, they danced to the rhythm of the Wicked Sisters’ latest song with all of their friends, cheered and sang along with Pansy as she performed one of Celestina Warbeck’s most famous songs on the stage near the Slytherin’s statue, and shared lingering kisses laced with the taste of Firewhiskey in one dark corner of the room, and
“Come on, people. There’s no victim and nobody needs to be sorry for anybody, okay? It’s just a game. No big deal”
Draco’s breath shuddered out of him and his head was limply thrown back onto Harry’s shoulder, exposing his neck further to Harry’s eager lips and teeth. Draco was already fully hard and throbbing with need. He was pretty sure that if Harry kept him waiting for a moment longer, he would go insane.
The sleeves of Potter’s white shirt are folded up to his elbows and his red-and-gold gryffindor tie is loose around his neck with the two top buttons of his shirt undone. And to torture Draco even more, Potter’s shirt tail is riding up in one side to reveal a taut flank and a sharp hipbone that Draco suddenly feels an urgent need to run his tongue along and taste.
“Fuck, Draco, get up,” Harry said after Draco looked up at his downturned face as he took him all in, and Draco obliged, pulling
The fingers of Potter’s right hand are running through his hair now, and his tongue is roaming around in Draco’s mouth, wrapping around Draco’s own and exploring his teeth. Potter kisses like he flies. Like he brings down dark lords and like he duels Death-Eaters. He is determined and graceful and from the very first moment, you know that he was born for this. Draco isn’t surprised.
. Draco stabbed his fork into the roast chicken on his plate, shooting daggers at the back of Potter’s head. That arsehole was
“You are the one who beat up MacMillan.” Draco said into the silence of the room, not as a question, because he wasn’t asking, but he wasn’t surprised by hearing himself say it either. It felt like he’d known it for quite some time, but hadn’t really taken the time to piece it all together until now.
Draco’s eyes darted to the jar of buzzing Glumbumbles on Pansy’s desk. If he was going to do it, now was the time.
Potter let out a huff of amused laughter, looking at him with something in his green eyes that Draco was unable to name.
“Wow, I’m sold,” Blaise deadpanned, standing up. “Come on, people. Let’s go win this thing. For the showers!”
“So fucking delicious,” Potter groaned when he finally pulled away, brushing the tip of his nose against Draco’s.
“Malfoy,” Potter interrupted, dark eyebrows raised and a small smile tugging at one corner of his lips. “Don’t you
“Well, I’ll admit,” Draco said, his heart slamming itself against his ribcage in anticipation. “This
“I still think the two of you should do an interview to talk about your relationship once, and be done with it,” Weasley suggested, before shoving a spoonful of oatmeal into his mouth.
“God, I hope the man hasn’t fallen in love with me or something,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes playfully. “He’s gonna have his loyal, Gryffindor heart broken otherwise!”
“I don’t know, Hanna. Someone else Ernie has pissed off? You have to agree with me, Ernie’s been quite the jackass lately.”
“Merlin, Pans, keep your voice down.” Draco grits his teeth at her as he quickly picks up his book and sits back down next to her.
Draco lets out a startled laugh. Pansy doesn’t at all seem to be kidding. “Have you lost your mind? Me, asking
Draco wrapped his jacket around his shoulders and walked out of the Hufflepuff locker room without a backward glance.
“I know, right?” Granger returned, shaking her head. “Why can’t they just leave you guys alone for a while?”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat as his eyes landed on a gigantic skeleton of a basilisk – too enormous and creepy to be a fake – lying on the ground beside the stone statue of Salazar Slytherin at the far end.
getting himself into this situation? Cleaning that shithole of a Potions’ supply room would take hours! There were a thousand different potion ingredients in there and some of them were seriously dangerous. Besides, Draco had never even cleaned his own room in his entire life!
“What are you doing?” Blaise was looking at him through the mirror with a confused-looking frown, adjusting his green and silver Slytherin tie.
Draco gaped at him, aghast. The sheer amount of sorrow and heartbreak that was radiating from MacMillan was probably enough to send Draco to his knees had it not been for the hands pining him to the wall, crushing his windpipes. How did MacMillan even live with it?
What if Draco wouldn’t have the strength to hold back and tried to kiss Potter or anything equally as horrible? This was stupid.
“So, as you can see, the Quidditch locker rooms are still being repaired, and the Hufflepuff locker room is the only one with functioning showers,” Boot was saying.
, Potter,” another girl snapped. “Both of these people have betrayed you at some point. You should be thanking us!”
“So, Draco tells me you want to be an Auror,” she remarked with interest, and Draco’s face instantly burned with embarrassment.
?” the second girl titled her head at him. “If you so much as point that wand at any of us you’ll be sleeping in Azkaban tonight. You think we don’t know that?”
. He’s right there, holding Draco’s hand in his own and smiling down at him. And it’s only the beginning of a wonderful life.
“Haven’t you heard the story? Anthony lost a bet to Neville about some magical plant and he had to sign up for Keeper position. And there was no competition, so he got it!” Weasley sniggered, face red with mirth.
. There was no sign of the dark bags under his eyes, his skin was as pale as always, but instead of the soulless white of the past few years, it seemed to be glowing with good health. He brought his hand up to his face, lightly touching the flush of soft pink across his cheeks with disbelief. He hadn’t looked like this for so long, that he’d forgotten he even could.
. Just leave it to me.” Pansy gives him a wicked wink and turns to leave, her too-short skirt swirling around her thighs. “Sleep well, darling. Tomorrow’s a big day!”
“People die, Harry,” Draco exhaled a humorless huff of laughter. “And no matter how good you are, you’re still just a Healer. You can’t work miracles. And expecting yourself to do so is just downright irrational. You need to cut yourself some slack, love. You expect too much of yourself.”
“Miss Parkinson, I think Mr. Malfoy is right. He needs to rest. You should go now,” Pomfrey intervened. “You two can talk about this once he’s discharged.”
“No, we do. We absolutely do,” Draco ran a hand across his face; he wished the ground under his feet would just open up and swallow him down. “Pans, I can’t believe I didn’t realize…
Before Draco could make sense of those words, Harry had closed the gap between their bodies and at that moment, it felt like everything in Draco’s life was clicking into place, right where they belonged. Harry’s lips on his, Harry’s hands cradling his face, his scent filing Draco’s lungs, and his warm breath mingling with Draco’s own ragged, unsteady breathing. It felt
Potter frowned. “I would never agree to an interview with her. If there’s one thing that Rita knows, it’s how to twist people’s words into whatever rubbish
Potter soared above the crowd, holding the Snitch up in his hand, and the sea of students started chanting his name in union.
“What is there to say?” Draco tries for the coldest tone he can muster. “It was a stupid game you morons had decided to play. I had nothing to do with it.”
Becoming a Death Eater had been the gravest mistake Draco had made in his life. Draco was certain that if he were to be given a chance to make only one difference in his past, he would have turned his back on Voldemort and refused the Mark. How was it possible that even here, in the supposedly best version of his life, Draco still bore that hideous brand of disgrace?
Draco is tapping his fingers impatiently on the wooden surface of his desk and glancing at his watch every ten seconds, waiting for the last five minutes of Transfiguration to pass so he can go outside and somehow distract himself from counting every remaining second for the next twenty-five minutes until 10:55.
much of an arsehole as a kid – and had approached them one by one. And it had gone surprisingly well. He had almost picked a fight with Weasley in the process, and gotten dangerously close to receiving the second sucker-punch of his life from Granger, but other than that, it had gone well. Draco was quite proud of himself.
out?! And what do you think he’d do? Blush and say yes?! No Pans. Best case scenario, he’d think I’ve gone crazy and owl the Mangu’s to send healers; worst case scenario, he’d think I’m definitely up to something and owl the Ministry to send Aurors. Either way, I don’t think he’d even believe me if I told him how I feel, let alone actually considering going out with me.” He looks down at his hands and his voice falters. “Have you forgotten who I am? I’m a former Death-Eater, Pans. And he is the Savoir himself.”
“I don’t want this to end,” Draco murmured into the comfortable silence between them minutes later, the horror of reality slowly drawing on him as he gradually came back to his senses. “Harry, I don’t want you to stop looking at me like this. Please, I…” Draco shook his head violently, his eyes filling with tears as he felt panic rising up his throat. “I don’t think I can live with that now. Please Harry, I can’t lose you. Don’t let me go back.”
“Noted.” Potter tilts his head sarcastically at Pansy before addressing Granger. “Hermione, tell me when the time’s up.”
“You don’t need to worry about me, Pans,” Draco told her. “The Manor’s my home and they are my family. I’ll be okay, I promise.”
, Potter,” Draco gritted his teeth in irritation.  “Yes, you can fuck me. Now get on with it before I-
Draco yelped as his clothes disappeared with a snap of Harry’s fingers and was immediately lifted onto the desk, Harry slotting between his pale legs.
“Oh, no! Draco!” Pansy’s high-pitched voice breaks the awkward silence that has been settled in the room since he walked in. She puts a palm over her heart and lets out an overdramatic sigh, like she’s just witnessed something truly tragic happen. “I can’t believe it’s you! I’m so terribly sorry, dear.”
you!” Draco gasped, eyes wide and only a breath away from pulling out his wand to hex Weasley’s mouth shut.
“Would I do this if I didn’t like you back?” Draco pushed him back a step, shoved his pants down and unceremoniously, dropped to his knees.
Potter bends Draco’s body back on the arm he has around his waist – knocking the air out of Draco’s lungs – and then it’s happening.
Draco sighed in exasperation. It had been like this all day. Potter just casually showed up, kissed Draco and then left him desperately wanting
“See? No wonder we lost!” Draco deduced, sighing dramatically. “I guess it was just another part of my tragic destiny to have to be the sole competent member of the worst Quidditch team in the history of Hogwarts.”
!” Pansy said venomously, clenching her fingers around Draco’s hand so hard it hurt. “People were around when it happened. They’ve all just kept their mouths shut. I wasn’t there myself, but I know it was that idiot Ernie MacMillan. I just
He looked up to see Potter gesturing for him to open it. Draco rolled his eyes. A crumpled ball? Seriously? Potter couldn’t even be bothered to fold the parchment into something decent? Even back in the days that they used to be enemies and Draco liked to send Potter mean, hateful notes, he’d still shown more class than
Draco doesn’t know where he’s headed. Everyone is still in the Great Hall and the corridors he’s passing through are all empty except for the babbling portraits on the walls. He makes a turn into a particularly quiet, deserted corridor when he hears the sound of footsteps from a few paces behind himself. He reaches into the pocket of his trousers – heart beating a little faster now – and slowly pulls out his wand. The sound of the footsteps seems closer now. He takes a deep breath and turns around at once, aiming his wand threateningly at the person in front of him who hurriedly raises both his hands, palm-up, in a peaceful gesture.
!” Draco whimpered and bit his lip as Harry’s other hand came up to grip tightly at his right arse cheek. “Just
“Alright,” Blaise shrugged. “It’s just extremely out of character for you to keep him waiting, you know.”
Draco turns around to see Slughorn almost running after him and slows down so he can catch up, glad for the distraction.
To Draco’s confusion, Weasley and Granger don’t look shocked or disgusted by what’s about to happen in the slightest. The two of them only share a brief glance; a strange, unnerving smile forming on Granger’s lips.
“Okay.” Harry smiled and let go of Draco’s hand to stand in front of the hidden entrance of the room. He closed his eyes – frowning in concentration – and paced past the section of blank wall three times until a plain white door appeared on the wall.
“Didn’t think so,” Potter murmured smugly before turning Draco around and capturing his lips in a hot kiss. Draco’s eyes fluttered shut as he leaned into it.
The next person to step out of the locker room door was Potter, his jaw clenched and brows furrowed, but his expression cleared as soon as he saw Draco.
Harry tilted his head, bringing their mouths together. His tight grip on Draco’s waist had a promise to it. Harry held on to Draco like he wanted to show him that he was never letting him go; that he would never even dream of it.
. He tells himself as he walks down a corridor to get to the other side of the castle where the eight years’ DADA class is located.
And he also very much likes to kiss Potter at least once. Who cares if Potter doesn’t want that? Not everything is about that handsome prick. It’s just one kiss.
“Merlin, you’re fast. I’m glad I saw you here. I was hoping to talk to you about your last week’s essay. Do you have a minute?”  Slughorn is slightly out of breath.
“I wish I’d been there with you too, love,” Draco sighed. “There’s only a month and half left of my Paternity Leave. I’ll be back before you know it."
” Harry said firmly – instantly – making Draco’s stomach flutter with butterflies. “You know I would have.”
out a dusty old stool and sat down; Potter did the same. For a few seconds, there was utter silence .Draco could tell Potter was making up his mind – or maybe he was gathering up his courage, but that was too unlikely for someone as brave as Potter – before he finally started talking.
Potter has one leg over the armrest of the couch he’s occupying– his foot dangling a few inches off the floor – resting an elbow on his knee and his head on the palm of his hand; long, clumsy fingers tangled in that unruly mass of jet black hair, messing it up even further. His round glasses are slightly askew and two orbs of magnificent emeralds are shining from behind them.
, and watching as I lost half the people I loved, one after the other, just so our positions would be reversed. All this nonsense concerning blood status was what tore the Wizarding World apart in the first place. And if telling off a bunch of Sixth Years is going to help fix that problem, then that’s exactly what I’m going to do. Whether you like it or not.”
“Draco,” Potter said with an amused look in his eyes, stopping Draco’s hands. “We can’t right now! And definitely not in here. There are people out there and the next period starts in less than five minutes!”
“Harry,” Draco moaned, helplessly grasping for the edge of the desk. “Harry, please, I’m so close,” Draco begged, not even knowing what he was begging for.
“Hmmm.” Harry came up behind Draco to bury his face in Draco’s neck; one of his hands slowly crept under the hem of Draco’s toga and slid between his legs, lightly rubbing at the inside of Draco’s thigh.
It was only Potter this time. Weasley was a little red-faced, but he had managed to keep a straight face. Potter was looking at a piece of parchment on his desk that Draco suspected Weasley had put there.
Draco – feeling extremely uncomfortable – tried to subtly slide out of Potter’s hold and somehow take himself – without drawing any more attention to himself – to the Slytherin table where he could quietly have the nervous breakdown he had fairly earned.
“Harry Potter has spotted the Snitch and is shooting towards it like a goddamn arrow, and Slytherclaw Seeker, Draco Malfoy, is right behind him,” Ginny Weasley was heatedly providing.
? Malfoy you’re his cousin! You two are family, I have no right to keep you away from him,” Potter said, and then in a gentler tone, “And I have no desire to do so either.”
! Fucking bollocks!” Potter swore, scrambling around his desk to where Slughorn was splayed on the floor. “Professor, are you okay?”
“Of course I don’t!” Draco almost shouts. “Who do you think I am, Potter? One of those pathetic little admirers of yours?” he adds one of his ugliest sneers to the end for good measure.
He hastily rolled up his left sleeve, hoping to find his Dark Mark gone, but his shoulders slumped in disappointment as his fingertips brushed the surface of the faded tattoo on his left arm. The Dark Mark was still intact, stark against the pale skin of his wrist and as shameful and disgusting as always.
“W… what do you mean?” Draco stuttered, feeling his defenses rise back up. Had he misinterpreted Potter’s words?
beautiful,” Harry groaned, taking in the sight before him with hungry eyes before he leaned in to kiss Draco again.
, talking to – and not even looking disgusted by doing so, if her neutral expression was any indication –
“That is very admirable, Harry,” Draco’s mother nodded. “But I guess I shouldn’t have expected anything less from the Savior of the Wizarding World.” She put a hand on Harry’s shoulder before turning her attention to Draco once again. “How about you, darling? Have you decided on what you want to do yet?”
“It wouldn’t have,” Draco said in a soothing voice. “Do you think I’d have married you if you’d decided to become an Auror? I’d have made you choose, Potter. I’d’ve made it cost you.”
Draco – looking around and only just realizing where Harry was taking him – took a terrified step back, his mind suddenly flooding with painful memories of the Fiendfyre.
“Fine,” Pansy pursed her lips. “But I’ll leave my floo open for you. Just in case things get … too much, you can drop by any time, okay?
“Oh, Harry,” Draco was in the mood to tease him some more, but at that, he changed his mind, the evil grin on his face shrinking into a fond little smile.
“Alright everyone, listen up,” Terry Boot started as the rest of the team settled down inside the Ravenclaw locker room. “Since Captain Goyle doesn’t like giving speeches, it’s up to me to give you people some motivational talk,”
“Yes. The potion needs to complete its process, so I’m afraid Mr. Malfoy is going to have to spend tonight here in the Hospital Wing.” This was Madam Pomfrey. Draco’s eyes fluttered open.
“But I offered you up to him. I was willing to let you die,” Pansy stuttered, utter confusion was only one of the emotions Draco could detect in her tone.
Borgin immediately recognized Draco, falling into a deep curtsey. “Young Mr. Malfoy! How delightful it is to see you here once again. It’s been a long time.”
let into this school in the first place,” he jabbed the tip of his wand in Draco’s cheek. “I watched her die. I loved her, and I didn’t even get to tell her that before I lost her for good,” he hissed through gritted teeth, a teardrop escaping the corner of his eye. “Do you have any idea what that’s like? And now I have to sit and watch as you walk around the school like nothing’s ever happened, when she’s lying under six feet of cold dirt and I’ll never get to see her again.”
Potter smiles into the kiss before deepening it further and Draco can only hold on tight, giving all of himself to the man who is kissing Draco like he’s the only one on god’s green earth who matters to him.
“What’s up?” Harry put his hands in the pockets of his trousers, leaning a shoulder on the wooden shelf. Draco gave an awkward shrug.
“And you,” Potter is shaking with laughter now, emerald eyes sparkling with mirth. “You alone were a whole other story. Honestly, you slytherins are not as good at deceiving others as you think you are.”
sure. The day that he’d left the Manor for Hogwarts four months ago, he’d been certain that he never wanted to go back to that place ever again. But so many things had happened in the past few months, which had taught Draco that running away from his past could never be the answer for him; if he wanted to change anything about himself, the first step would be to accept the person he used to be. And Malfoy Manor and his family were a big and inseparable part of that person.
?” his voice was rising with each word. He wanted to grab Potter’s shoulders and violently shake him until he came to his senses. “What is
Potter, who was just about to sit back down, turns his head around. Eyebrows shooting up in surprise.
That morning, just as he was walking out of the Great Hall after breakfast, Pansy had snuck up behind him and – startling him yet again (for Merlin’s sake!) – had whispered into his ear: “DADA class, second period. I want you to get there at exactly 10:55. Don’t be late. Or early. 10:55 sharp.” Then she had pecked him softly on the cheek, adding: “By the way, you’re looking gorgeous today, darling.” and had walked past him, disappearing among the crowd of students leaving the Great Hall to get to their first lessons of the day.
“Probably dead in a ditch somewhere, or worse,” Pansy shrugged. “But don’t go all Hufflepuff on me now.” She brushed him off, going back to her plate of pasta.
There was a few seconds of silence between them before Pansy broke it. “Someone’s beaten the shit out of Ernie MacMillan’s face.”
“Oh, look,” Harry said, stretching his neck at the direction of a tiny blue head appearing amongst the crowd. “They’re here!”
“Hmmm, I tend to forget these things pretty easily,” Draco bit his lip, gaze sewed to the dark red of Harry’s mouth. “You’re gonna have to remind me again.”
,” Draco made a loop in the air, catching a glimpse of sparkling gold somewhere near the stands right before Potter hurtled to the sky in its pursuit, Draco at his tail.
“What do you think, Malfoy?” Weasley called, snapping Draco out of his head. Draco quickly looked away from Potter, his mouth suddenly very dry.
thrown over his shoulder before he locked the door behind himself and immediately began undressing with numb, frozen hands.
“I couldn’t give up. My life’s never really been just mine; so I didn’t have a choice but to move on. But in order to do so, I needed forgiveness, and I didn’t feel like I deserved it. So, I think I kind of… tried to earn it?” Potter frowned, looking back up at Draco. “I tried to become the godson Sirius would want me to be, and do things that he’d be proud of me for. It took time, but I slowly began to heal. I’m sure you can too, if you want to. Or maybe you’d find your own way of earning forgiveness, but you should give yourself a chance, Malfoy. You deserve it.”
“But it’s a shame that no one listened to you, isn’t it, Parkinson? Because with all of us gone, maybe you could finally feel competent for once in your life,” another one added with a sneer.
could not bring a coat with you in a cold weather like this just so it wouldn’t ruin your look,” Potter shook his head, reaching into his Mokeskin pouch and pulling out a soft, worn-out piece of clothing for Draco.
. What was he doing? This wasn’t even his real life. Draco would go back to his own reality in less than 24 hours. He wouldn’t be here for the interview anyways. “Okay, fine,” he opened his eyes again. “Fuck it. We’ll do the interview.”
Draco was walking out of the classroom with his head down, completely lost in his thoughts – as he had been for the entire length of the class – when a strong hand grabbed him by the back of his robes and before he could even let out a yelp of surprise; dragged him inside the nearest closet.
“Morning Granger,” Draco said in an impassive tone, still not sure how he was supposed to handle this particular turn of events.
“I’ve thought about that a lot, actually,” Harry replied. “I wasn’t sure about it at first, that’s why I came back here for Eighth Year; to give myself time to consider it. But fighting is what I do best, and I don’t mind it, as long as it’s done for the right cause. There are still a lot of things that need to change about our world. The War might be over, but the fight continues, I want to be a part of it.”
The musty door of Borgin and Burkes gave a loud squeak when Draco pushed it in and stepped inside the dark, old store. The entire place smelled like death, and everything in the store was under a thick layer of dust.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Did I disturb your creepy ogling session?” Pansy crosses her arms. “I called your name several times, Draco. You can at least pay a little attention to your surroundings as well when you’re fantasizing about screwing the Golden Boy.”
Harry finally slid his fingers out of Draco and murmured a spell into his damp, sweaty hair, lubing himself up. He positioned the head of his cock against Draco’s arsehole – both of them grunting at the touch – but hesitated there, his lust-blown eyes searching Draco’s face again.
pity me or I’ll gouge your eyes out with my bare hands,” Draco spat at him, his breath coming shallow with the force of his sudden outburst.
“Of course. Sorry, professor.” Potter tells her; his warm, polite tone not sounding apologetic at all.
“I will.” Draco ran a hand in his hair; he needed a hot shower. “We’ve got until 9 for breakfast. What’s the rush?”
So if only for the sake of his friends and the people who cared about him, he was going to get back on his feet again. Draco was miserable, and life was shite, but that didn’t mean he should be weak too. If he was going to survive this – and for the first time in a long time, Draco found himself actually wanting that – he had to make peace with his past and accept it as it was; no matter how dark or awful. And in order to do that, Draco needed forgiveness.
“Nothing,” the first girl answered, sending Potter a smug look and brushing her long hair behind one ear suggestively. “We’re just teaching these two a lesson.”
“Hey, tell that voice to shut the fuck up!” Draco said, taking Harry’s head in both hands and lifting his tired emerald eyes to look into his own. “You are plenty good at what you’re doing. You’re one of the best Healers we’ve got. You’re great at performing Healing Charms, your magical core is insanely strong so you can detect magical injuries and heal them faster than anyone else, and most importantly, Harry, you
“Do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow, Malfoy?” Potter crosses his arms over his board chest so casually, like he didn’t just take Draco’s breath away with what he just said.
“Draco,” Harry turned around, still holding Draco’s hand. “Hey, look at me. We’re not going inside the room where everything is hidden, okay? That place was destroyed in the Fiendfyre. But there’s more to the Room of Requirements than just that place. Do you trust me?”
After a few more minutes of pretending to read the same few lines of the book, when he finally stands up to go, his eyes meet a pair of bright green ones looking at him from a couch near the fireplace and – as always when this happens- his traitorous heart misses a beat even though he manages to keep his expression neutral. Potter doesn’t look away, he just gives him a small nod of acknowledgement which Draco returns before turning around and making his way out of the common room.
“Okay,” Harry said, pushing off the shelf and taking a step closer. “But just so you know, Ginny’s not my girlfriend.”
“I …” Draco started as a futile attempt to sound unconcerned. He swallowed and lightly bit down on his bottom lip when Harry’s stare didn’t leave his mouth.
And in that moment, Draco had realized what a great mistake he had made. The consequences of drinking the Sweet Agony were just as grave and destructive as promised. Draco had taken the leap in hopes of a lethal crash, but now it felt like he was floating in the dark abyss in a never-ending fall. The sweetness was long gone, but the agony was like a solid, heavy weight on his chest, mercilessly crushing his heart underneath.
“Mr. Potter,” Slughorn called, starting to sound impatient. “If there’s something funny, please share with the class.”
“What?” Draco almost whispers, heart ready to explode. He’s now 100 percent sure that Pansy has screwed everything up and the entire school already knows about his stupid crush on Potter.
“What?” Draco’s eyes go wide at that, whatever Pansy is thinking cannot possibly be a good idea. “Shit, Pansy. I thought we were talking hypothetical. Whatever twisted idea you’re having right now, please forget it. I can’t have him know how I feel!”
? Draco hurriedly picked up the copy and stared – with utter mortification – at the picture of the two of them on the front page.
at me and walks over to tell me that the other houses are going to throw a big Halloween party and if we want to join them, they’d be happy to have us! Can you believe that?”
Harry had kissed him. It was totally crazy, but it had actually happened. And Draco’s heart was beating so fast, he was sure Harry could feel it through all the layers of clothing between them.
Pansy pulled out her wand and aimed it at her face, making the girl and the rest of the group to point their own wands at her.
Draco was standing a few paces away, watching them. Harry’s graduation gown was wrinkled and the gold ribbons decorating the collar were slightly stained with spilt butterbeer. His red cap was askew and threatening to fall off his head any second; he looked absolutely breathtaking.
He slows down a few paces away from the classroom door. Goyle is leaning against the stone wall beside the door like some kind of a bodyguard. When he sees Draco, a sheepish smile cracks up his goofy face.
Draco’s knuckles were white around his wand and his heart was hammering against his ribcage at the murderous look in MacMillan’s eyes.
Potter takes a step forward. He’s so close now that the cool scent of him is wrapping itself around Draco, filling his lungs and making the thin hairs on his arms stand up in a light shiver. “Do I look like I’m joking?” He deadpans, looking down at Draco.
They were quiet again. Harry’s clothes smelled like Healing Potions and hand sanitizers and a long day spent in a hospital attending to patients.
” Draco swallowed, cradling his suddenly burning cheek in his palm and looking up at the grayish sky to avoid Potter’s gleaming gaze. It had started to snow.
Since the awkward conversation in the library, Draco hadn’t really spoken to Harry aside from the casual small talk in the Great Hall or during classes. Harry had acted strange, looking at Draco like he was trying to dig into his brain, searching for answers. For what questions? Draco wasn’t sure.
Granger gives him a quick nod – that unsettling little smile still tugging at the corners of her lips – and gives her wand a flick, a timer appearing in the air in front of her face. “Whenever you’re ready, Harry.”
The unexpected friendship that had sprung between the two of them in the past month was still young and fragile, and it was one of the best things to ever happen to Draco in his entire life. He couldn’t afford to lose it over an emotion that couldn’t be reciprocated. This wasn’t the sweet and beautiful alternate reality; this was Draco’s own ugly, messed up life.
Draco mentally slapped himself. What was he doing? He was supposed to be talking to Potter and making things better, not to further piss him off! Otherwise what was the point of all this trouble?
“Well, I wasn’t,” Draco snapped, not able to stop himself. “And I didn’t think you’d notice anyway, since you were so busy making gross little public displays of affection with your
“So what, Potter?” Draco spits out, he hasn’t felt this humiliated in a long time and he’s certain that his face looks as red as a tomato. “Congratu-fucking-lations, you got it. I wanted to kiss you once just to know how it’d feel, so I did. Happy?”
Draco’s roaming eyes landed on Potter’s floating figure on the other side of the field. Potter didn’t even seem to be trying to look for the Snitch. He was just leaning back on his Firebolt and watching as the others totally embarrassed themselves with what Draco suspected was an amused grin.
Suddenly, everything clicks into place and Draco has to stop himself from breaking into a feat of hysterical laughter. Of course. Of-fucking-course Pansy would do that. That evil genius! How could he not have guessed already?!
. What are you talking about? You’re not going to lose me.” He chanted as he held Draco – now visibly shaking with the force of his panic – in a tight embrace. “I’m never walking away, Draco. I promise. You’re not gonna lose me.”
Draco mutters an apology too, hurrying to his seat next to Pansy on shaky legs. Pansy gives him a big thumbs-up under the desk, whispering: “I’m so proud of you!”
Draco took a deep breath before answering. This was it, this was his chance. “Potter, I know that my actions in the past have been incredibly unacceptable,” he forced the words out, his throat tightening with shame and shiny drops of sweat forming on his forehead. “I’ve never missed an opportunity to insult and humiliate you and your friends, and always treated you like the enemy even though you’ve never done me wrong.” Draco felt like a hand was clawing at his heart, he fought to keep his voice even. “I wanted to tell you that I was wrong, and I’m sorry.”
And that was all Draco needed to throw him over the edge again. He buried his head in Harry’s neck as his orgasm hit. And Harry was right behind him, crying out as he filled Draco up with hot sprays of his come.
“Madam Pomfrey told me that she’d heard from Miss Parkinson that you’ve been getting trouble from some of the other Eighth Year students in the past weeks since the school started. Is that true? She also gave me a name but as you know, Mr. Malfoy, I can’t really put the blame on anyone unless you tell me about them yourself. And all I want is for this enmity to end. All I want is peace, for all of us.” McGonagall leaned forward in her chair. “Have people been bothering you?”
“Can I ask you something, Malfoy?” he said, and Draco nodded. “In the summer when your mom often came to visit Teddy and Andromeda, why didn’t you ever come with her?”
“Is kissing the only form of expressing affections you know how to perform?” Draco mumbled against his lips.
He blinked his eyes open and sat up, opening his mouth to tell the person off, only to come face to face with… “Potter?”
.” Draco felt weak with nausea all of a sudden. “You don’t understand, Harry. We’ll never get to be together again. I’ll never get to kiss you again.” Draco’s voice broke with sobs and he pressed his face into Harry’s chest. “Harry I can’t…”
Draco was poking his roast chicken with a fork, only partly listening to the conversation happening around him.
Draco sat his jaw and grabbed for the jar of insects on Pansy’s desk. Pansy looked away from the scene to the fragile jar in Draco’s hands with confusion.
“Hey!” Draco crossed his arms. “A man’s mascara is like his toothbrush. I can’t let you rub my mascara all over your dirty eyelashes!”
There was utter silence for a moment, before a loud buzzing noise started as the Glumbumbles flew out of the broken jar and then the whole class broke into a fit of shouting and running away from the insects. Draco – frozen in place by the shock of what he had just done – slowly lifted his wide eyes to where Potter, equally as shocked, was staring at him with his eyes bulging out of their sockets.
“Has it?” Draco gritted his teeth as his Dark Mark started to itch uncomfortably. He hated this place with his entire being.
“It is and you are. I don’t understand; why don’t you put yourself out of your misery and just ask him out?”
“Pans, I…” Draco closed his eyes; searching for the right thing to say. Was there even such a thing as the right word? Was there a word he could say to make this even slightly better?
“No, of course not,” Draco hurried to explain, only just remembering that Harry was a perfectly nice person who was now his friend, and Draco was the one acting like a selfish prick. “No, I’m totally happy for you. I am. You two look great together,” (he had to force that part out) “and not gross, definitely not gross. I don’t know why I said that,” Draco sighed in defeat, letting his eyes fall shut. What was wrong with him? “It’s just … I was really exhausted after the game, and I just wanted to get some sleep.”
Now as soon as the class is over, Draco is practically flying out of the classroom – head buzzing with anxiety and excitement – and throws himself inside the nearest boys’ bathroom he can find. He checks his hair, making sure a few soft blond strands are falling into his left eye. Renews his perfume. Tidies the collar of his white crisp shirt. Clears his throat and smells his breath. Checks his hair again.
” Pansy scowled, visibly restraining herself from sending a hex to the back of the girl’s head as they walked past her, heading towards the Slytherin dormitories.
“No, no it’s…” Draco ran a hand across his face in frustration. So he was still a war criminal, and the son of a war criminal,
Draco blinked his eyes open, sitting up on the sofa he’d fall sleep on waiting for him to return. He’d been worried, Draco remembered as the drowsiness wore off.
“I think you should go with purple lipstick,” Pansy said, taking a sip from her glass of pumpkin juice. “But definitely not red. That’s my look.”
“A single drop of the Sweet Agony gives the person who consumes it the ability to live a single day of their life in an alternate reality. A reality in which they’d made different choices and took a different path. One they’d be the happiest version of themselves in.” Borgin’s eyes had an evil spark in them, making him look even more sneaky than usual. “That’s a very tempting concept, isn’t it? But the thing is, the consequences of this potion can also be grave. The few people who’d ever had the chance to try it are all believed to have gone insane. Most of them would commit suicide shortly after they’d come back, claiming they couldn’t bear to continue on living their real lives any longer. That is why the creator decided to destroy the recipe once and for all.”
“No!” Draco cried, fisting one hand around the base of his cock to stop it from obliging Harry’s words. “I want you to fuck me. Please.”
Draco turned his head away, unable to look into her pleading eyes for a moment longer. He had seen. He remembered everything. “I’m really tired.”
“Hey, you did this to yourself on purpose!” Potter protested beside him. “Now stop complaining and get to work.”
Draco looks around himself at a classroom full of eighth year students who look like they have just witnessed the most interesting spectacle of their lives. When have all these students arrived, anyway?
They kissed and kissed and kissed for what felt like an eternity and a single moment at the same time. When Harry finally pulled away, Draco’s eyes fluttered open reluctantly. He wasn’t sure whether Harry’s kisses were always simply too short or it was just him who could never get enough of them.
On the sound of her whistle, Draco and thirteen other players kicked up into the air, and the game was on.
The moment they stepped inside the Great Hall together, the entire Hall fell almost silent as every student stopped what they were doing to watch the two of them walk in. But instead of letting go, Potter’s hand remained possessively around Draco’s waist.
“I had a headache,” Draco said way too quickly, like he had rehearsed it in his head a thousand times. “I needed to rest.”
He popped open the tiny glass, closed his eyes and before he could think twice about it, he held it up to his mouth.
” Draco swallowed, trying to process this unexpected piece of information and what it could mean for Draco.
“Yeah, bye Potter. It was nice talking to you too!” Pansy yelled after him. Potter waved his hand at her general direction without turning back.
Draco’s mind was completely blank for only a moment longer before a river of memories came pouring back into his brain, making him helplessly grab for the edge of his bed in order to steady himself.
“I don’t know, you tell me.” Harry bumped their noses together. “You’ve been the one at the receiving end of my displays of affection for the past three month.”
, Malfoy. I’m not sorry that I hurt you,” MacMillan sniffed, voice hoarse with tears. “You deserve far worse. You can tell him I said that, I don’t care. Just stay the
Draco leaned into the touch and let Harry’s warm breaths spread across his cheeks, drinking in the sheer contentment that being this close to Harry seemed to always bring for him.
Draco puts a hand on his heaving chest, trying to even out his breathing before he walks inside. He can hear the sound of students talking inside the classroom. He takes a quick peek but can’t see anything from where he’s standing. “What are they doing in there?”
?” He rolled up his sleeve and ripped his leather wristband off, exposing the faded Dark Mark on his left arm.
?” Draco stopped walking, suddenly feeling overwhelmed by all the doubts and helpless questions he’d tried to suppress all day long. “Why would you even want someone like me
But just as Draco starts to contain his shock enough to actually kiss Potter back, he pulls away and breaks the kiss, and Draco follows his lips blindly for a moment before realizing the time must be up. He opens his eyes reluctantly, blinking the dizziness out of them, and the first thing he sees is a set of bright green, slightly out of focus eyes looking into his own. Potter isn’t kissing him anymore, but he’s still holding him in his arms and this close, the green of his irises are even more intense.
Sitting at the eighth years’ table inside the Great Hall, as Draco slowly forces sip after sip of orange juice down his throat, he is looking anywhere but at Potter – just like he’s managed to do for the entirety of the past week since they so unprofessionally sucked faces in front of the whole eighth year student body.
Pansy gives him a toothy grin of pure slytherin evil and suddenly stands up. “Then don’t forget to wear your raspberry lip mask tonight before bed, darling. Because tomorrow somebody’s going to be kissed by their crush.”
“What are you doing out here in the cold at this hour of the night? You’re shivering,” Harry said, his warm breath a cloud of white in front of his face.
Draco pursed his lips. At least the other team was just as bad as them. He rubbed his hands together for warmth, his breath forming tiny white clouds in the cold December air.
Draco opened his mouth to say something, anything; but he was absolutely speechless. He gave up at last, returning Potter’s smile with one of his own that he was surprised to find genuine.
“No, I’ve got a new one. This one’s yours,” Draco shrugged, like he didn’t care either way; but who was he kidding? Draco
“Don’t worry. I don’t think a little bit of rolling would be so bad for him,” Potter said, having the audacity to fucking
“Why?” Pansy asked; her fists clenched at her sides. “Why did you stand up for us, Potter? Is it really
“Hmmm…no,” Harry decided, shaking his head with a frown. He leaned beck and without further delay, swallowed Draco’s cock whole.
Potter had said, and Draco was going to prove him right. He was going to swallow his useless pride and go talk to him.
Draco’s hands are falling limply on either side of his body; fingertips itching to bury themselves inside that unruly mass of black locks and feel its texture. But he can’t bring himself to move them. He is already feeling to many things for his poor heart to handle. The pressure of Potter’s lips on his, his tongue in Draco’s mouth, his arms around Draco’s body and the cool, pleasant scent of him filling Draco’s lungs are already far more than Draco has ever felt before. He can’t take more without losing himself entirely.
“That’s not what I meant!” Potter was easily irritated (what a surprise!). “I was just curious is all. Why do you always have to be so impossible, Malfoy?”
“Um…” Draco clears his throat and holds his chin up in the air. He can’t back down now. He won’t. He’s gonna do this and he’s gonna do it his own way. “Ha! Nice try in backing down from the dare, Potter. Maybe you’re not as brave as you think you are, after all. You thought you got away with this, didn’t you? Not a chance! You know what? Now that I think about it, I don’t mind being kissed by you if it means I get to make you put your money where your mouth is.” He manages to keep his tone flat and his eyes directly on Potter’s now visibly amused ones the entire time even though the tips of his fingers are prickling with nervous energy and adrenaline is roaring inside every single blood vessel in his body.
“Young Mr. Malfoy, sir, you have your father’s sharp eyes and his special knack for spotting the rarest of dark artifacts.” Borgin sounded triumphant, like he had meant for Draco to see that. “This ring is a few centuries old. It’s a valuable heritage of a family who shall remain anonymous, sold to me due to the owner’s desperate need for money at the time.” Borgin held up the velvet box carefully in the palm of his withering hand. “But that is not what makes the ring so special. This ring contains the only remaining drop of a potion that its recipe is believed to be destroyed and lost forever.
When he turns back his head, every pair of eyes in the classroom is on him, including Potter’s. There aren’t many people inside – most of the eighth year students still haven’t made it there somehow – but considering what he’s expecting, even that much attention is more than enough to give him a rising sense of internal panic.
Pansy lets out an impatient sigh. “The outfit I was telling you about? The one I’m gonna wear to Hogsmeade tomorrow. Where you even listening?”
“What? Where are you taking me?” Draco asked, holding down the hem of his toga with one hand to stop it from swirling up in the cold breeze.
“He was bullying you,” Harry sighed in defeat. “And I know that I wasn’t any of my business, but it was just …”
“Well, as much as we might not like it,” Pansy shrugs. “Dare’s a dare. Blaise did his, now you do yours.”
, Draco stepped out of the Slytherin common room, absentmindedly curling a piece of long blonde hair around his forefinger in order to calm his nerves. When he had gone back to the dormitories that afternoon after Transfiguration and found his costume neatly laid out on his bed – washed and ironed by the house-elves – he hadn’t been able to help the warmth he’d felt spreading in his chest.
and it totally matches the mood of that scene. So I thought maybe you guys wanted to listen to it as well! (
“I need to have a talk with Granger about her husband,” Draco gritted out, his fingers tightening a fraction in Harry’s hair. “The Head Auror needs to chill the fuck out. He can’t keep doing this,” and raising his voice over Harry’s exhausted protests, “no, you know I'm right! Every time he gets injured it fucks you up worse than it does him. He can’t keep doing this to you. It’s not fair!”
“He’s right,” Pansy said, much to Draco’s amazement. “You don’t have to give them any details. Just tell them about how happy you two have been together for the past three months and put a stopper to the nasty rumors about you having been
Draco snapped out of his thoughts sharply. He’d bumped into another student while he was distracted, and sent her books scattered across the floor. His own still-sore chest was throbbing with pain from the force of the impact.
“C’mon.” Potter let go of his waist to take Draco’s hand into his own, practically dragging Draco behind himself towards his friends at the Gryffindor table.
Draco shrugged. “To tell me how much he loves me and to ask me out on a date. You know, the usual stuff. Are you still mad at me?”
Standing in the middle of the room in utter confusion, Draco caught sight of his own reflection in the mirror and had to do a double take. He looked…different. More
Blaise was out of the room before Draco could open his mouth to ask him what in Salazar’s name he was on about.
“I have another one but this one’s warmer,” Potter shrugged. “Why? What’s wrong with this one? I think you’d look extremely cute wearing it!”
Draco turned around spontaneously, checking if the Weasley-girl or some other Gryffindor lass happened to be standing just behind him, but there was no one else around.
“YEEEES! He’s got the Snitch! GRYFFINPUFF WINS!” Ginny Weasley howled at the megaphone and the stadium exploded with cheers of victory.
Something about the ring caught Draco’s attention and when he took a closer look, he saw that instead of a gem, the bezel was holding a single drop of a shining purple liquid – one that Draco had never seen before – inside the glazed solitaire.
“Hey, Malfoy.” Suddenly, someone sat down beside him and Draco – being caught in the act of eavesdropping – couldn’t help but feel a sudden jolt of guilt and discomfort in the pit of his stomach.
!” he swore again as Draco’s fingers slid under the elastic of his pants. “That maybe you didn’t feel the same about me.”
“Mother!” he protested. She wasn’t supposed to tell Harry about Draco’s weekly, detailed letters of how their relationship was going.
“Yeah. Nice try, mate,” Blaise patted Draco’s shoulder on his way out of the boys’ dormitories, murmuring to himself “Honestly, like I don’t know he’s just trying to make me say it again so he can relish on hearing other people call him his
“I suppose so,” Harry’s voice came out almost as a whisper, and when Draco looked up at him, he saw that Harry’s green gaze was firmly pinned to his lips. Draco’s breath caught.
Narcissa Malfoy looked as stylish and graceful as always as she smiled at Draco with a small bouquet of Juliet roses in her manicured hands; Draco’s favorite flowers.
,” Pansy said, rolling her own glassy eyes at him. “Besides, as someone who’s known you my entire life, my expectations were pretty low to begin with!”
Since the Eighth Years were not allowed to join their houses’ Quidditch teams, McGonagall had permitted them to assemble two teams of only Eighth Year students to play each other, Gryffindor and Hufflepuff in one team, and Slytherin and Ravenclaw in the other. There was even a match scheduled for them in two weeks. But as far as Draco knew, the number of Eighth Year students who actually knew how to play Quidditch wasn’t even enough to form a single team.
“No, wait…” Draco called after him, but Potter’s tall figure had already disappeared around the corner.
“Look, Malfoy, as much as you might like to think so, I’m not an idiot.” Potter holds Draco’s gaze. “I saw Goyle shooing everyone away from the classroom door before you walked in that day.” A huff of laughter escapes Potter, he shakes his head with amusement. “And Parkinson might have thought that she was fooling everybody, but she was practically chocking on her excitement.”
“I…” Draco’s attention was dragged to the back of the classroom where Ernie MacMillan had just walked in. He had a swollen eye and a split lip. He walked past Draco without sparing so much as a glance at his direction – which was unusual – and quietly sat down beside Longbottom.
So it was up to Draco to help with these kinds of things while he still could. In two days, Draco too would leave that ghost house behind.
“I’m saying what if – and it’s all hypothetical – you two kissed once. I mean if he does like you and just doesn’t know it yet, he’d find out like that. But if he doesn’t, at least you’d know for sure and you wouldn’t have to …you know… wonder.” Pansy gives him a shrug that she’s obviously trying to hide her excitement behind.
“Welcome to Eighth-Year exclusive game of Quidditch, Gryffinpuff versus Slytherclaw!” said Ginny Weasley who was providing commentary. “Hey, I’m the one holding the megaphone, so I get to choose the names. It’s a dictatorship!” she added in response to the surge of “boos” and protests rising from the audience.
“Goldstein, you moron! What are you doing? You’re supposed to protect the fucking hoop!” Draco shouted at his team’s Keeper who had neatly thrown himself out of the Quaffle’s way, but his words got swallowed by the delighted cheers of the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff audience. He sighed and closed his eyes; this was by far the worst game of Quidditch Draco had ever been a part of.
“I didn’t…” Potter snapped, frustrated. “Malfoy, I didn’t assume you were up to something evil, okay? I was just bloody
“And it’s a good idea, to apologize to the people you’ve hurt. It means you’re taking responsibility for your mistakes and it’s admirable,” Potter took a step forward, his green eyes searching Draco’s face. “But at the end, do you think you can forgive
But something wasn’t right. This wasn’t him. Draco took in a deep breath and pressed his lips together in concentration, trying to recall his memories from the day before. What was the last thing he remembered?
should have died that day, Malfoy, not her,” MacMillan spat furiously. “Every time I see you walking around this school, it feels like she’s dying before my eyes all over again, and there’s nothing I can do to save her,” he said, his entire body shaking with the force of the anger and pain in his voice.
“I think I know why you never stand up to Ernie or any of your other bullies,” Potter crossed his long arms over his chest. “It’s because you feel like you don’t deserve to fight back. Isn’t it, Malfoy?”
“Really?” A huge grin cracked up Potter’s face. “Okay! Brilliant!” He took a glance at his watch. “Oh, crap, I’m late for DADA. See you at lunch!” Potter pecked Draco on the lips and zipped his trousers back up before opening the door and walking out.
, Draco. I’m not going anywhere. Go to sleep, love. I promise I’ll be right here when you wake up.” Harry whispered into his ear, stroking Draco’s hair.
Weasley – in his surprisingly fashionable vampire costume – was the first person Draco spotted in the crowd.
Maybe Potter and the others would never truly forgive Draco. Maybe they would always despise him. And Draco wasn’t sure if he could ever be okay again knowing that Potter secretly hated him, but he promised that he would at least man up and talk to him once; to apologize and take responsibilities for his actions. And maybe that way, it would be possible for him to let go of even a tiny fraction of the heavy weight he’d been carrying on his shoulders for the past two years.
Potter shrugs; a curse is on the tip of Blaise’s tongue before the savior extends his hand like it’s a peace offering. “You can touch me, if it’ll help.”
Neither of them seem to have anything to say after that.  Draco would be content to stand and stew in the awkward tension forever, but the other players arrive shortly afterward and Coach Becker announces the start of practice.  Dobri spends the entirety of practice glaring at Draco and avoiding Bogomil as much as possible.
“Here again,” Severus drawls at the sight of Draco at his doorstep.  “I suppose hoping for mercy this year would have been too optimistic.”
Draco is at the London Quidditch pitch—the main one, where he’ll be playing Qualifiers against the English National team in a few months—speaking to his old friend Madam Hooch while an intense rec game takes place overhead.  He’s only just been accepted by the Bulgarian National team and came home to break the news to Hooch himself.  After a short congratulations, Hooch is berating him about his apparently inadequate maintenance of his broom when there’s a cheer from above and the game stops.  The player with his arm extended, clearly holding the Snitch for the players to see, swoops down toward Draco and Hooch, and the moment he comes into view Draco feels a sudden burning hate rush through his body.
Looking back later, it won’t be clear why this moment is so significant, but Potter has always been able to get Draco to react in ways no one else can.
“I saw him,” Draco insists. “You saw h-him too. Harry Potter, he’s dead, the Dark Lord killed him – don’t let him kill me, please, I don’t want to die yet – ”
He smiles at them, but it doesn’t even come close to reaching his eyes.  Draco sees Niko frown and open his mouth to say something before Zo elbows him.  The Beaters share another glance.
Blaise waits for Draco to nod before he carefully detaches himself from his friend’s trembling form and makes his way over to the fireplace to flick Floo powder into the flames and call for the Head Auror’s office at the Ministry. The fire turns bright green, and Blaise grimaces before sticking his face directly in it.
The first few months after the war are admittedly some of the hardest of Draco’s life. Gregory and Pansy never reply to the letters he sends them, although he knows they aren’t in Azkaban because their names aren’t included in the
It’s not the same, and it hurts because no matter what he’s done in the past he’s always had a home to return to. Now, for having been too scared to stand up for what he believed in, for having been too weak to fight what he knew was wrong, home is something Draco just doesn’t have anymore.
Then they’re landing, sliding ungracefully off their broomsticks, and Draco watches the Golden Trio throw something back into the fire as he coughs his lungs out. His throat clogs up and his vision blurs so badly he can’t see anything for what might be a minute or an hour – he doesn’t know; he can’t tell the difference – and when he can finally blink himself back to reality, the Gryffindors are gone. Goyle is in front of him, carefully checking him over for injuries and asking him if he’s alright.
He and Marcus Flint had never been particularly close at school, but it somehow works. Marcus is polite and surprisingly intelligent considering his hugely rugged appearance; he pays his half of the rent and does his share of the chores. He’s pleasant enough, Draco supposes, even if he grunts a lot and talks fairly little.
“No,” Draco whispers, feeling Blaise’s grip tighten on his shoulder. “No, no, Potter’s not – he can’t – ”
Harry kisses his forehead, cards a hand through his hair, and Draco is surprised when it offers the comfort it intends to. “You never did.”
Volkov smiles grimly and wishes him luck, and then Draco leaves.  He Apparates right into Dobri’s living room, which he’s been doing ever since they learned how to Apparate—even back when Dobri was living with his parents, the Paisis had loved Draco and somehow never considered to be intruding.  The Malfoys were a little more sensitive about that, but Dobri had always been welcome at any time so long as he Apparated right into Draco’s bedroom.
“This is Draco,” Harry goes on, gesturing at him, and Oliver barely even glances at him before offering a halfhearted
He pulls out of the dive a fraction with just enough time not to crash into the left hoop, heart racing in his chest as he comes to a stop.  Potter is hovering up by Zo, clearly not having spotted the Snitch, and he shoots a cocky grin at Draco before flying off.
“I almost lost you,” he chokes out instead, grasping at Harry’s hand, which thankfully squeezes back. “I – I don't know what I would’ve done. I don’t know how to live without you.”
Anyway, Draco’s childhood dream has been more or less fulfilled: Dobri also plays on the Bulgarian National team, as a Chaser, which means they spend almost every waking moment together.  At first glance, this is a good thing.  Dobri is a skilled duelist, and a passable potioneer, and a three-time pick for
“Cedric nearly beat me to it that time,” he says casually.  “I reckon it was our brooms that edged us out…”
—”  He stops himself, because that had actually happened one time, and he’s been careful to liberally apply skin protection charms since then.  “Why are we talking about Potter again?”
Things are alright, for a while. The days develop a routine for themselves; Draco awakens to the slam of the front door when Marcus leaves for work every morning, fixes himself a cup of too-bitter coffee, checks on the stocks and bonds he’s invested his family’s fortune in and, day after day, stays at home. He does the laundry, dusts the furniture, cooks a dinner he doesn’t eat half of, and almost always falls asleep before Marcus gets home from work.
(A younger Draco Malfoy might have sneered, taunted him, told him that had James Potter been alive to see him now, he would be disgusted that such a sight could belong to a boy who supposedly looks just like him, but this Draco is different. This Draco is thinner, just like Harry Potter is; he’s disheveled and dirty and hollow and perhaps a sight that Lucius Malfoy should be disappointed in too.
For a minute, nothing happens; then Draco jerks sharply and lets out a whimper before relaxing, trembling and burying his face in Blaise’s shoulder. “You okay?” Blaise asks urgently, patting his cheek. “Do you remember what happened?”
Blaise helps Draco to his feet, steadying him when he sways and smoothing his hair to calm down. Draco decides he’s been stupid to have so underappreciated his friends this way, because he hasn’t shown them any genuine gratitude in all the time that they’ve known each other, and now it’s too late.
Harry comes over whenever Blaise goes on dates with Oliver, which starts becoming a startlingly regular thing. Draco is eternally grateful for it; although he generally feels safe in Blaise’s flat, he still has a problem with being alone, and having Harry with him gives him peace of mind.
.  Potter’s sexy.  The entire Wizarding World thinks that, Draco, including you.  I know you’ve had your eye on him since his match against the—the Slippyclaws or whatever, fifth year.”
Madam Hooch looks between the two of them, two of her best students, and sighs before walking off without a word.  She knows how Draco feels about Harry Potter.  Draco wonders if Potter has said anything to her about him.
Potter is casually circling the Pitch, staying fairly removed from the action.  Draco trails him and listens absently to the commentary, not wanting to let Potter have any advantage in case he spots the Snitch first.  Everyone knows Potter is one of the fastest Seekers in the game.
“Draco,” he hears Blaise say firmly, but by now he’s sobbing openly and hyperventilating and can’t stop shaking. “Draco, you’re having a panic attack, okay? You need to breathe, or you’re going to p – ”
charm.”  Despite his words, the white gold watch sits perfectly on his wrist, emeralds shiny and polished as they had been the day Draco gave it to him.  Draco resists the urge to smile.
Draco nods, pulling off his soaked jacket. Sky pours vehemently from the sky in what may as well have been buckets, and his teeth are chattering. Marcus is violent when he’s drunk, and Draco would rather run away a million times than be on the receiving end of it.
That summer, Draco celebrates his eighteenth birthday on Blaise’s couch, and if all they do is get drunk off old Firewhiskey and fall asleep under a shared blanket, he doesn’t complain.
The English players all fly right to Potter, shouting in his face, while Potter holds the Snitch high.  Draco is breathing hard, still reeling from having been a fraction of a second too late, and out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of Niko and Dobri’s dejected faces.
“Harry’s single, you know,” Blaise says conversationally one day over dinner. “He and Ginevra Weasley broke up right after the war ended.”
’s Dreamy Durmie.  He picks up men and women alike every time the team goes out for drinks, and although he can sweet-talk his way out of any situation, he always keeps his promises.  Put together, he’s not a bad approximation of what a perfect person would be—charming, funny, and much smarter than he looks.
Anyway, what he still remembers is the look on Lucius’s face when Draco tore the broom out of the packaging, swung one leg over it, and flew right off.  Lucius had never looked so proud of him before, and he hasn’t looked so proud of him since then.
“EYES ON THE PLAY, HAWKS!” Wood bellows to a clearly abashed Hawksworth, and Draco hears Potter scoff as they fly by.
“Okay,” Blaise says, wrapping long fingers around his wrist and tugging gently, “Draco, come on, let’s get you inside.”
“I think we’ve got a chance,” Niko chatters nervously as they make their way to the middle of the pitch.  “We haven’t played in two weeks, we’ve got fresh legs, they’ve got to be tired after playing France…”
Blaise ushers them inside, leading them to the couch and making small talk; Oliver’s responses are enthusiastic, and Harry looks rather amused. Draco goes to the kitchen to grab them drinks.
They’re speaking, of course, about the team’s star Chaser—the devastatingly handsome Bogomil Levski, with dark hair that literally shines in the sunlight and a waist about as thick as Dobri’s thigh.  He would likely have just as many admirers as Dobri if he weren’t the quietest person Draco has ever met, and while Dobri himself has loads of people falling at his feet, he’s only had eyes for Bogomil since the first game they played against him in regionals.  And having Bogomil around all the time, all shy smiles and solid strength, must be an exquisite brand of torture designed specifically for Dobri.
“Has Draco Malfoy seen the Snitch?” the announcer cries when Draco goes for it.  Potter turns sharply at that and dives, and Draco curses, pushing his broom faster—stretches his hand forward—and Potter is
That’s true, Draco thinks, and they are. They’re stupid and spontaneous and self-sacrificing, but they mean well. They’re kind.
Potter is totally calm beside Blaise; Draco doesn’t know how he manages to do it. Blaise inspects his own nails with mock interest. “Draco’s always had good taste.”
Wood tosses the Quaffle to Avery Hawksworth to continue the play.  Hawksworth is too busy smirking at Bogomil to notice Vulchanov’s Bludger coming right for him, and he loses control of his broom just long enough for Bogomil to steal the Quaffle and toss it to Dobri.
The Quaffle goes back to Avery Hawksworth, who carries it nearly half the length of the Pitch before passing to Vosper.  Dobri steals it on a shaky pass from Vosper to Flitney, only to lose it when Dawn Withey sends a Bludger right at him and he has to swerve hard.  Vosper regains possession of the Quaffle and gets it the rest of the way to the goal but tosses it too lightly to the hoops, where Zo catches it easily and sends it up to Niko.
The team is in low spirits the entire week before the game, because it isn’t even a question of who’ll win, but how much Egypt will win by.  Zo and Becker try to stay motivated, pushing the team hard at practice, but most of what they say goes in one ear and out the other. Draco overhears Niko privately confessing to Vulchanov that he doesn’t know why they even bother training so hard when they’ll lose anyway.
“No need for dramatics, boy,” Severus snaps, seemingly having found his voice.  “I suppose you’re giving this to me now because you’re on the national team now?”
Potter pulls his wand out of his pocket and mutters something under his breath, frowning at whatever he sees. “
It had once been Draco’s dream to play Quidditch professionally with his best friend, Dobroslav Paisi.  Dobri was born and raised in Bulgaria, and the youngest of four brothers who had all attended Durmstrang.  Draco and Dobri had played Quidditch recreationally at Durmstrang, and in their younger years, they’d even gotten to play with Krum on occasion.
Blaise doesn’t know if the full effect of his glare is conveyed through the fireplace, but Potter sighs and gets up regardless. Blaise pulls out of the fire and turns back to Draco, who’s still sobbing and now has his face buried in his hands. Blaise’s heart twists.
If it weren’t for Dobri, Draco probably would have ended up playing for England or doing something else entirely.  It’s a lucky thing—with Harry Potter as England’s Seeker, Draco never would have made it onto the national team.  He would have been stuck playing in the minor leagues forever.
Draco stares at him for a minute, trying to read him and failing miserably.  Unsatisfied, he offers his left hand and watches with sadistic pleasure as Potter fumbles to move the Snitch and his broom to his other hand.
“Right, well,” Draco says.  Severus’s lack of reaction makes him nervous.  “I remember I had been really nervous before the game, and Father had promised to be there but he couldn’t make it and Madam Hooch was busy at Hogwarts.  And I know it was just rec Quidditch and it wasn’t a big deal at all, but Severus, when I saw that you were there, I—”
It’s not much, but it’s a start. Potter’s look of surprise at Draco’s gratitude speaks volumes about how much the latter has changed, and Blaise doesn’t know how to feel about it.
“Obviously,” Severus says, somehow managing to make it sound like Draco’s surprise is unreasonable.  “Draco,” he continues very quietly, “you are always welcome here, or in my office at Hogwarts, as your schedule permits.  As much time as you take up, boy, I will be disappointed if you become too much of a celebrity to see your godfather less than thrice a year.”
Bogomil gets tripped up by Keaton Flitney, who spends less time chasing the Quaffle than he does sitting in the penalty box, and then Dobri nearly runs Flitney into the stands.  That leaves Niko free to steal the Quaffle, and then suddenly Potter’s taking a nosedive toward the hoops.  Draco follows him without even thinking about it, trying to spot the Snitch, extending his hand as if it’ll push his broom faster
“Really, child, is all this necessary…”  He trails off when he opens the box.  Draco watches him very carefully, trying to read his expression, but it remains blank.  Severus doesn’t seem to know how to react.  “What is this?”
Narcissa had been somewhat hesitant about sending him to Durmstrang, for two reasons: that it was so far from home, and that she didn’t particularly want him learning dark magic.  But Lucius was decidedly not a fan of Dumbledore and had no qualms about setting Draco up for a formal education in subjects from which Hogwarts would rather run.  Truthfully, Draco thought blood magic and dueling sounded rather interesting, much to his mother’s chagrin.
“I would be inclined to agree with you, Mr. Potter, if I were not personally privy to the terrible maintenance of your broom,” Madam Hooch says.  She smiles at him despite her scolding.  “Your victory has nothing to do with your broom.  I must advise you to be more careful with your equipment…”
“Dobri!” he cries.  “Have you been sitting here all day?  What is that—pistachio?  That isn’t on our diet plan!”
that repeats itself in his head – and his stomach drops when he realizes that Crabbe is nowhere in sight.
“Yeah,” Dobri says with a wet little laugh.  “And I think Niko could tell, because he talked me into doing shots, and then I don’t remember much of what happened after that but suddenly it was near midnight.  And something came over me and I—I went over to Bogomil, Draco, and I kissed him.”
It’s the day before the game when Zo asks them all to stick around after practice for a few minutes.  Draco is expecting him to give them a pep talk or something, maybe try to deny how they all know the game will turn out, but instead he pulls a letter from his pocket.
“WHAT A GOAL BY NIKOLA VASSILEVA!” the announcer crows.  “And a valiant effort by Oliver Wood, but he was just too slow!”
Bulgaria plays England for the first time in late April.  Harry Potter looks right at home even at the Sofia Pitch, which is annoying.  The last time England played here, they had lost, albeit to Krum’s team.  Draco doesn’t even want to think about it—he’s read the articles predicting scores and offering betting odds, and it’s not looking too hot for Bulgaria.  Without Krum, their odds against this faster and more experienced team are fairly slim.
St. Mungo’s is a place Draco tries to avoid going to at all costs, but he supposes he’ll make an exception for Harry.
Draco eyes him warily and complies, making room for himself in Dobri’s huge blanket nest.  Dobri only (and always) watches
Marcus rounds on him, sneering. “Zabini. Still sucking his dick, I see. I thought the two of you would’ve moved on from that by now.”
.  “England beat Wales 150-nil this past weekend.  Potter caught the Snitch before the first play was even made.”
Draco forgets to breathe, whirling around in an instinctive search for the voice. His limbs turn to jelly but Blaise is still there, grabbing him by the shoulders to right him before he can fall, easily keeping him on his feet, but he doesn’t register any of it.
It’s not long before Marcus picks up a bad drinking habit, though, and Draco figures the thought of a future that stable and predictable was too good to be true anyway.
Potter is arrogant and reckless, clearly having grown overly used to winning and seeing adoring fans clamor for his attention.  He seems to speak without thinking for a moment about the consequences of his words despite being firmly in the public eye.  Draco can’t believe so many people have been charmed by such a bumbling idiot with no courtesy or manners whatsoever.
“I certainly hope not,” Draco says.  “Thank you for telling me.  I’ll try to get Dobri to tell me what happened.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says. There’s something in his voice that Draco doesn’t recognize, something he’s never heard before. “I didn’t think it… I’m sorry.”
Blaise is, for once in his life, stone-faced. He’s soothingly rubbing a worried Oliver’s back, and to anyone else, he would have seemed totally nonchalant, but Draco knows his best friend better; he knows to read into the subtle shaking of his hands and the way he slouches just so. He knows that, despite the healer’s reassurances that Harry is going to be fine, Blaise is afraid.
Forrest proposes to Jenny and she says no.  Dobri used to cry at this part, although after seeing it so many times he’s more or less immune to it now.  Maybe it’s the knowledge that she’ll come back to him eventually.  He still cries at the end when Forrest stands at Jenny’s grave.
He’s attractive enough, Draco thinks; he’s tall, though Blaise might have an inch or so on him, with a fair complexion and big brown eyes. Draco chances a look at Harry and is completely unsurprised at the mischievous look on his face – Valentine’s day is coming up, after all.
Marcus’s glare is intense enough that Draco looks away although it’s not directed at him. Blaise doesn’t even flinch.
“You think I’m just going to let you leave?” Marcus snarls. His lip curls in an oddly Snape-like manner, and Draco unconsciously shuffles closer to Blaise. “You – ”
The sincerity in his voice is almost foreign. Draco grew up on disguises, on masks, on thinly veiled lies hiding dark truths, and Harry never fails to surprise him one way or another with no more than honest words and wide eyes.
Bulgaria is not fond of Draco.  Well, the city of Vratsa is, because he Captained the Vratsa Vultures to win the European Cup in his last year in regionals, but things changed once he made it onto the Bulgarian National team.  Despite his killer performance in regionals, he doesn’t hold a candle to Viktor Krum, and Bulgaria had loved Krum more than anything.  Even after Krum’s objectively lackluster performance in his last game—losing the Snitch to the speedy new Egyptian Seeker—Draco seemed to be held to a standard of perfection, or close to it.  Of course, Draco has never even come close.
With England’s lead at a much shakier 10 points, Bulgaria’s got its confidence back.  The Chasers manage five more goals, three of which are Bogomil’s, and Zo blocks all but two shots so that by the end of the first hour, Bulgaria is leading 90-60.
tumbling out from between his lips as his brain short-circuits. The roar of the fire is suffocating, drowning out every thought – every
Draco laughs, and it’s a wet sound, full of relief and pain and something he can’t quite name. “Is that a promise?”
“Keep your voice down,” Dobri hisses, elbowing him hard in the side.  This is totally uncalled for, in Draco’s opinion, because the subject of their conversation is in the middle of the Pitch, talking with Coach Becker and probably not paying any attention to Draco and Dobri whatsoever.
“Draco, it’s okay,” Oliver says quietly, and Draco starts when he realizes there’s a tear slipping down his cheek. “Harry’s going to be fine.”
“Let me show you,” Harry says. “Let me show you how perfect you are, how good you are. Let me show you that you deserve to be loved.”
Draco has always appreciated consistency, but he needs it now, craves it. The war had been unpredictable, and he hadn’t known how to handle it; he doesn’t think he can now.
Draco goes home for the holidays, as he always does, and as always he stops by Spinner’s End to make a visit for Severus’s birthday.  Although Severus complains that they’re both far too busy to waste time on something as childish as birthdays, he never actually turns Draco away, so it’s become a tradition of sorts.  Similarly, Severus never comes to visit for Draco’s birthday, but he always sends him surprisingly useful potions, so Draco knows he never forgets.
England knows it.  Even Oliver Wood, who has been notorious for his pre-game anxiety ever since he was made Captain, doesn’t look too worried.
All the same, Krum hadn’t been the only one to retire after Bulgaria’s devastating loss in the 2002 Cup finals.  While most of the new players haven’t been met with half as much criticism as Draco has, there’s still a tremendous pressure on the team as a whole to outperform the last team.  It certainly doesn’t help that a significant portion of the team, including Draco, was freshly and hastily signed right after the Cup.  The vets are all kind and helpful, but the fans are skeptical and will probably keep writing their suspicious articles until the rookies prove themselves.
Niko seems somewhat unconvinced.  Draco can’t blame him—by the hoops, Zo is starting to look frustrated, and England’s Chasers have been doing a surprisingly good job of dodging Vulchanov and Volkov’s Bludgers.  England has had an overwhelming majority of the possession of Quaffle, which is fairly typical of their matches.  But despite his obvious uncertainty, Niko is the next to score.
Draco sighs and turns away; he doesn’t want to talk about it. “Come on. We’re not going to get them in each other’s pants without a bit of alcohol.”
“He beat you!” a voice yells from within the crowd; Draco twists sharply in his friend’s grip to see Ronald Weasley, red-faced and clearly enraged, trying to pull away from his brothers’ grips on his arms to charge at Voldemort but not quite managing to before more shouts erupt from all of the Light side. Draco thinks he’s going to be sick.
The two of them glare at each other for a moment, clearly both gauging the other’s stubbornness.  Eventually, while Tom Hanks exposes Richard Nixon on screen, Dobri looks away, chewing on his lower lip, and wiggles around on the sofa until he lands with his head in Draco’s lap.  He reaches around to grab Draco’s hand and place it in his hair.
“No one’s going to kill you,” Blaise says, swallowing, pulling him into a tight embrace. “You’re okay, I promise. You-Know-Who is gone.”
“I know,” Draco says, and he does. What he doesn’t add is that that doesn’t make it hurt any less, not when he still sees Harry this way, because Blaise and Oliver could never understand how in his mind’s eye he can see Harry’s blood spilled across the smooth plains of a flat blade, and they could never understand how it feels.
“Well, he didn’t say anything to me,” Draco says.  “I’ll stop by his flat after practice if he doesn’t show.  Maybe he’s sick.”
And Diggory never got back into professional Quidditch or even coaching.  There are rumors that Diggory is working for the Ministry of Magic these days, but Lucius had stopped talking about him once his Quidditch career came to a close, so Draco doesn’t hear about him often.
Draco doesn’t think he can answer honestly without his voice cracking like a little second-year, and he pulls up his shirt. The jagged white lines against his flesh say what he knows he can’t, and Harry’s calloused hands are gentle when they touch his skin.
“That’s the spirit,” Becker says.  She’s looking at him like she agrees that he needs the extra practice, but is too nice to say it.  Whatever.  “Did you have a good holiday?”
(And home, Draco thinks, doesn’t have to be his loving mother and green and silver and Hogwarts and the sight of too much food on the dinner table. Home is where the heart is – is round glasses and red and gold and Blaise’s couch and too much Firewhiskey in his hands.
Harry frowns. “Hermione doesn’t hate anyone, Draco, and she certainly doesn’t hate you. We may not have liked you, but none of us ever hated you.”
Harry and Blaise, Draco thinks, are too good to him, and he doesn’t deserve them, but he’s not going to question it. Surely once they realize they’re wasting their time with him, they’ll leave; he shouldn’t encourage them to do so if they haven’t thought of it themselves.
Now is too late for a lot of things, though, with Crabbe dead and the survival of both Blaise and Gregory uncertain, and Draco thinks regret is cold as it settles heavily in his chest.
Dobri is back at practice the next day, because they really can’t afford to miss much when they have a game coming up.  It’s against Egypt, the defending Cup winners.  Draco tries not to think about the odds of Bulgaria being defeated again, especially since this new team is far less experienced than the old one (which Egypt had previously beaten anyway).
They get fucking creamed by Egypt, both in the next day’s game and in the rematch a week later.  Despite Krum’s words, it fucking sucks.
Fortunately for England, Wood seems to be better by the next game, and they have a winning streak of eight games before their next loss.  Bulgaria, on the other hand, wins six of their next nine games.  That puts England in third in the division and Bulgaria in sixth.  Senegal is first in the division and second in line for Cup favorite, and with their eighteen wins in twenty games, Draco has no delusions that Bulgaria will somehow come out on top.
that England is in third,” Dobri says, which is true.  Still, Draco would rather die than agree to praise Potter.  “It’s not like the game’s long enough for him to make that many saves, anyway, with how quick Potter catches the Snitch.  Wood played in ‘98 too and England didn’t do nearly as well, because Blythe Parkin sucked.”
Winter is cold. Draco supposes he should like it, as most Slytherins do, but this year feels worse than others have. Perhaps it’s just the icy feeling of abandonment in his chest, he thinks, because this winter he doesn’t have anyone to sidle up to to keep warm or money for drinks that ignite something inside him or even a home to cozy up in.
Coach Becker and Bogomil’s conversation abruptly cuts off.  Draco hadn’t meant to be speak loudly enough for them to hear him, but Dobri’s completely mortified expression makes him unable to feel bad about it at all, and Bogomil’s entire face is bright red.
The fighting passes in a blur. Blaise stands steady by his side, battling the Light and Dark sides alike, and Draco fights blindly, mindlessly, dodging when his instincts scream at him to
Severus sighs heavily and waves his wand, summoning a heavy trunk from up the stairs.  He packs the Snitch inside it and raises his eyebrows at Draco’s confused look.
“Just a piece of home decor,” Draco says lightly, which earns him a glare.  “Fine, fine, it’s the first Snitch I caught, alright?  Well, not the
Draco is never going to be sure of what exactly happens during the Final Battle, but he does have a vague idea.
He doesn’t have time to ponder it; suddenly Potter is grabbing his arm, tearing him from whatever he’s got a death grip on – why is there so much junk in the Room of Requirement, anyway? – and pulling him onto the broom. Draco’s eyes water as he instinctively wraps his arms around the Gryffindor’s waist, burying his face in his broad shoulder, and he squeezes his eyes shut. Potter is steady and flies with a practiced grace; Draco clutches tighter at him as a whimper rips itself from his throat.
“Blaise,” he chokes out through the noise. How can he be suffocating like this when there are no walls to close in on him? “Blaise, I can’t – I can’t breathe, let’s get out of here,
Draco hasn’t thought about Granger in years, and he’s surprised to find that his memory of her hasn’t filled in the slightest; he remembers everything about her from her bushy brown hair to the periwinkle dress she wore to the Yule Ball. No matter how hard he tries, he hasn’t been able to forget much of anything about Hogwarts.
“Like hell you’re moving out,” he says. “We decided to split the money, you piece of shit. You don’t get to just opt out.”
The second unforgettable memory is the day Draco set foot into Durmstrang from the first time.  The castle is quieter and grander than Hogwarts, with a much more practical design—and stairs that lie still, for one—and darker decorations.  It didn’t take long at all for Durmstrang to completely win Draco over thanks to the castle itself, even if Igor Karkaroff was shifty and Uncle Severus was far away.
Seemingly out of nowhere, a flash of green flies toward them, and although it’s too fast for them to move away it’s too high up to hit them; the spell slams into the wall just above the doorway in a loud of explosion of color and noise and Draco feels himself jumping away, a sound between a whimper and a scream emitting from his throat, his knees protesting in pain when they buckle and hit the ground. It’s a second before he realizes he’s got his trembling hands pressed up against his ears and his eyes squeezed shut, but he’s unharmed. He’s alright.
“He’s really cute,” Blaise says, plowing on like Draco hadn’t said anything. “And he’s really sweet and witty and – and absolutely
Draco blinks, and blinks, and blinks again until the burning behind his eyes subsided to a dull throb. He’s not going to let Harry see him cry; not again.
Practice is strange: Bogomil is quieter than ever and Dobri doesn’t joke around as much as he usually does.  Draco hasn’t told anyone what Dobri confessed to him, but he does ask Zo if Bogomil had told him anything.  If Zo doesn’t know, then no one else on the team does—and he doesn’t, so Draco figures Bogomil just hasn’t told anyone.  It doesn’t seem like either Bogomil or Dobri are going to try and talk it out any time soon, but there are more important things to worry about.
He leans in closer so that their foreheads are touching, their lips barely brushing against each other’s, so that Draco could count Harry’s eyelashes if he tried.
“I hate to cut this reunion short, but we don’t have all day.” Potter’s tone all but screams finality, and a sharp flick of his wrist sends the rest of Draco’s belongings flying into his trunk, which zips itself up neatly. “Have a nice life, Flint.”
and throwing up hasty shields when he doesn’t have time to get away. He doesn’t know if it’s fear or adrenaline running through his veins, but it keeps him moving as if he’ll combust if he stills, as if he’ll die if he stops fighting for even just one second –
“Hawksworth is first to the Quaffle, now to Edric Vosper—we saw a great performance from him against France.  Nicely dodging Ivan Volkov’s Bludger—oh, Vassileva’s got it!  He passes to Paisi, and—back to Vosper on a sloppy turnover by Paisi—”
“Hey, Dobri,” Bogomil mutters, looking away, equally flustered.  “Did you, um.  How was your morning?”
He remembers slinking away from the other Death Eaters and muttering something about confronting Potter about his wand, remembers actually confronting Potter with half-hearted threats, remembers Crabbe and Goyle brandishing their wands from behind him. Potter is thinner than he’s been in all of the time Draco’s known him – other than, maybe, when he’d been an evidently malnourished eleven-year-old child – and he looks older than Draco knows he is.
“I received a letter from Viktor this morning,” he says.  “I know our team isn’t exactly confident going into this game, and that’s—it’s not ideal, but it’s not the end of the world.  It wasn’t the end of the world for Viktor or Clara or Vas, or for your father, Bogomil.”
“I’m afraid so,” Draco says.  He holds up his perfectly wrapped package, offering a teasing smile.  “I brought you a gift.”
“ – may have altered his memory to convince him the war ended differently. I can’t imagine why, but it’s a possibility.”
Blaise’s expression is too innocent for what he’s suggesting. Draco laughs; he doesn’t think he’s been as at ease in years as he is now. He doesn’t think he’s laughed nearly as much, either, and he has no idea where he would be without Blaise. “Okay. Let’s drink.”
Dobri smiles a little bit.  “I don’t think this is something anyone can really help with, Draco.  But thank you.”
It somehow worsens when Wood offers Zo a polite nod as the announcer rambles off their lines.  Potter smiles at Draco as the Captains shake hands, and Draco tries not to glower back, and then the ref starts the game.
“Why would you encourage them?” Harry asks, and the tension dissipates with Draco’s laugh as they go back to the living room.
Harry – “We’re going to have to get on a first-name basis if we’re actually going to be friends, you know.” – comes by once a week or so to talk. He’s got fantastic stories of Golden Trio escapades and Christmases with the Weasleys; Blaise tells them of better times with his family and Quidditch games he’s been to with them. Draco doesn’t have much to contribute to the conversation, but for the first time he’s perfectly content with listening.
“You’re my best friend, dimwit.  I’ll listen to whatever you want to say.  And I’ll get Volkov to fight whoever hurt you.”
It’s not even a second that Gregory’s back is turned before Blaise is rushing forward, wrapping his arms around Draco’s shoulders. “I was so worried,” he tells him. “Your parents asked me where you were and I thought you were with them. I thought…”
Sometimes, though, Draco still thinks about his accident, about which he’d read in the many articles that had come out in the immediate aftermath.  Diggory wasn’t quite as good as Potter, but aside from his sophomore season, he was still highly praised and had been expected to do well in his career.  To have it all come to a sudden stop must have been the worst feeling in the world.
Even now, Potter barely looks at Draco as he lands gracefully near him and Madam Hooch.  He grins widely and holds the Snitch high for them to see.
This Draco is tired – tired because he can’t sleep, tired because he can’t breathe, tired because he’s fighting a war that shouldn’t be his – and if fatigue comes in waves, then this Draco has drowned time and time again.)
“Do you understand now, deluded ones?” the Dark Lord says unto the deafening silence. “He was nothing, ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!”
Malfoy Manor is too lonely with his father in Azkaban and his mother gone – although maybe Draco is less bothered by being alone and more by the memories of countless men dressed in black robes sitting at his dining room table, by the sight tattooed in his mind of his mother hanging from a noose in the middle of the ceiling – and Draco returns only to remain for less than a month before he sells the Manor and moves into a much smaller flat with an old classmate.
But there is, of course, a catch: he knows exactly how to push Draco’s buttons and has no qualms about doing so.
hit from Flitney—is that not a penalty?  Guess not—and it looks like Flitney was too slow, Levski has it now.  He carries it down—another Bludger from Withey, but Levski seems to have slipped past—he shoots—AND A TAP-IN BY DOBROSLAV PAISI!  ANOTHER TEN POINTS FOR BULGARIA!”
“You two are practically attached at the hip,” Volkov says.  Bogomil visibly tenses, which does not go unnoticed by the team.
When his feet find the ground, he finds himself faced with his best friend under a mountain of blankets on the sofa, watching his charmed television and eating ice cream out of a massive tub.
“I don’t know, Niko, they don’t look too tired to me,” Volkov mutters.  Draco privately agrees.  The English Chasers are practically bouncing and the Beaters have oddly menacing grips on their clubs.  Even though Draco’s seen enough of their games to know they don’t take too many penalties, he feels his stomach turn.
Blaise sighs. “For Merlin’s sake, Draco, I’ve seen how you look at him. He’s into you too, in case you were wondering.”
Blaise goes out of town to visit his parents for Christmas, so Draco abandons any plans he may have had and spends the holidays holed up in his bedroom. He keeps the door locked for fear of Marcus coming home early with slurred speech and bruising touches, and only leaves his room for meals and to use the bathroom. There are no presents exchanged this year, and although Draco isn’t surprised, nothing keeps him from being disappointed.
Of course, Harry Potter had skipped everything—he’d never played in regionals and he never had to try out for a team.  He had famously been recruited right out of Hogwarts to start playing on the English National team with no experience outside of Hogwarts, and of course he’s been nearly as good as Krum ever since.  But even before his skills came to light, he had been welcomed with such open arms that Draco thought he could see some English shoulders pop out of place.  Even Krum had encountered some difficulty when he was recruited during his sixth year at Durmstrang.
.  Draco had known this already, but they seem quicker in person somehow.  They get possession of the Quaffle first and then they’re off.
“This is Oliver Wood,” Harry says when he shows up one day with a slightly older, familiar-looking man. “He was the captain of Gryffindor’s Quidditch team for our first couple of years, if you remember.”
Still, Bogomil is even quieter than usual, which is saying something.  When practice ends, he’s the first one in the locker room and he’s gone before Draco’s out of the shower.  Zo is also conspicuously absent, which Draco takes to mean that he’s gone to talk with Bogomil.
article about Potter, and he can tell Dobri is thinking the same thing, because he immediately flushes just as brightly as Bogomil.  “Good,” he says weakly.  “How was yours?”
To no one’s surprise, England beats Wales in the rematch.  They continue to perform well while Draco continues to perform passably.  Potter catches eight of his next ten Snitches but wins six games while Draco catches five for five wins, which speaks to the differences between their teams.  But with the pressure from the fans and the predictions of even relatively unbiased sports networks, it’s no surprise that the Bulgarian team is pushing harder for a better performance.
Draco freezes, hands stiffening over the clothes he’s packing into his trunk; Marcus’s words are slurred. “I’m moving out,” he manages. “I’m sorry about the rent. At least you get extra living space, though? It’ll be nice, I guess, since this place is kind of cramped and all.”
hair looks like sex.  If you wanted to fawn over someone, you’ve been overlooking the most suitable candidate for years now.”  Draco waggles his eyebrows.  “Unless, of course, you’ve been too busy ogling our darling Bogo—”
Draco nods shyly.  “I haven’t been able to come home much this season, and with the way Qualifiers are set up that’s unlikely to change until after the Cup, or at least for as long as Bulgaria is still in the running.  I’ll be in England for holidays, of course, and my parents may want to see me for certain occasions, but I don’t know how much time I’ll be able to spend here.  Especially with you at Hogwarts most of the year, so I can’t just Apparate to see you.  And I know you say you don’t miss me, Severus, but I wanted to give you something to—to remind you of me.”  It sounds so juvenile when he says it out loud.  “I don’t know, it’s stupid, I just thought…”
Draco had in fact watched that Hogwarts match, in which Gryffindor had only beaten Slytherin by twenty points even having caught the Snitch.
“I’m only joking,” Zo says with a contradictory waggle of his eyebrows.  “Would you want to practice with me, Draco, or would you rather fly alone?  Olivia and I were just finishing up.”
“You didn’t exactly have a glowing complexion,” Dobri says with faux sympathy.  “Even before puberty Harry Potter didn’t look like he would burn from sitting at the window too long.”
“It’s a magical language that involves the ability to speak to snakes and most relatives, including chimeras, several species of dragon, and cockatrices.  It’s a dominant trait found primarily in the line of Salazar Slytherin, and several pureblooded lines in India.  Salazar Slytherin is said to have performed a ritual to keep the Parseltongue trait alive in his descendants.  Parselscript and Parselmagic are offshoots of Parseltongue- Parselscript is the phonetic translation of Parseltongue, and Parselmagic is magic spoken in Parseltongue, which amplifies the force of magic behind the spell by a constant of 2.5, although that can vary depending on the strength of the caster and the type of spell, given that Parselmagic works best with Transfiguration, Transmutation, and the Dark Arts.” Harry rattles off promptly.  Malfoy gapes.
It’s what Invisibility Cloaks are for, after all- sneaking around.  After dinner, Harry slips off, although not before pressing a soft kiss to Luna’s cheek and promising to meet her for breakfast.
Saorise is weaving agitatedly on his neck; she’s been in a state of high excitement lately.  Draco thinks she knows.
“God, stop,” Draco chokes out, pressing the flat of his palms against his eyes, because this is utterly mortifying.
The door is wrenched open and there’s Snape, irate and scowling, his hair loose around his pale, sallow, face.  Harry feels such a gush of relief at the familiarity of it all that he sways with it.  “
“Because,” Potter whispers, breath gusting over the nape of Draco’s neck- Christ, this is not the time to be aroused - “Salazar Slytherin hid the
He intends to go to the family library, intends to research Parseltongue and maybe, if he has time, a countercurse, but he hears voices and pauses.
He imagines Tom Riddle’s life before Hogwarts- he could have easily been that boy - that brilliant, sociopathic, boy with a penchant for cruelty and a untenable force of will.
Oh, Severus thinks, what have we done to you, this bright unshakable offspring, maybe we have quenched your glow and maybe you could have been a Lily. (An Evans.)
Harry can’t move, his ribs feel split and his face is tender like hurting-things are, he can only scream (and when Vernon clamps a sweaty hand over his nose and mouth and he can’t
on the cool hardwood floors, that would raise questions and questions would raise Dumbledore and the Light Side and then he’d be dead, dead, dead.
“You were saying, about Potter?” Blaise intervenes, and Draco shoots him a grateful look.  Pansy leans back, pleased as punch to share gossip, as always.
), it’s a dance strung so, so, so intimate- sometimes, Draco fancies that it’s more intimate than Potter’s relationships with the Weasel and Granger, more honest.  No tiptoeing, eggshells already ground to
I saw your head, that day in Hogsmeade,” is all he chooses to say, and Harry laughs, shortly.  It comes out huskier than he means it to, rough and low and loose, and there’s a flush on his cheekbones and really, this could have all happened at a better time, when he’s not easy and relaxed with the heady rush of not a single person recognizing him running through him like particularly fine wine.
Draco does not believe for a second that it is a kindness; the Dark Lord is telling Lucius not to heal him, he will enjoy watching Draco forced to learn it before the bruise overtakes his entire body.
