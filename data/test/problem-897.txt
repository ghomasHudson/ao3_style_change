In the display window sat a Santa claus in a sleigh.
Harry admits.
But neither of them paid any attention to his pleas.
"Yes im sure, i need to do this for me. I spent so long putting others first i need to step back and put myself first."
He felt his heart as the cell opened once more and Lucius approached him. He'd hoped the wizard would leave him alone at least for the night.
Harry smiles at Draco saying the word Mine.  And kissed his chest.
"I don't have a girlfriend..to be honest I never told anyone this but..I only went to the dance with her to keep up appearances. I dont want my friends to think differently of me..but the real truth is I'm gay."
Lucius finally flings a badly hurt Draco against the wall and was starting to form one of the unforgettable curses.
Harry just grinned at Ron, and the red head shakes his head.
Hermione was both offended and relieved. Thinking maybe he had no attraction to her, not enough to attempt it, but yet relieved cause she didn't feel she was ready for that step yet either. They had six months. Why rush it. It would happen when they were both ready to try. She fell asleep quietly.
Luna opens the door looking extremely tired only her head peaking out.
Blasting Lucius off his feet.
"I know a lot about the dark arts, so I'd be one of the best to teach it besides Snape who has decided to give up teaching to be a full time potion maker." Draco tells him.
Where they stumble into bed and clothes fly to the floor and Draco pounds him into the mattress before they cuddle up in each other's arms and succumb to sleep.
Kingsley touched Draco's shoulder.
Harry thinks deeply. America. That was as far as hd Could go without going to Canada.
Harry starts to wish the wizard would just make this quick and just kill him. Anything to make the pain stop.
"No you won't cause I'm going to talk to mom and Dad..and go with yall."
Pacing back and forth worrying about what was happening with Harry, four it was an awful lot for one person for one day, what if it was too much for him? Draco worries.
"Hey Harry how about fetching the water, while I go find us some wood to light a fire?" Draco suggested.
"Crucio" Lucius growled, pointing his wand at Draco.
Swallowing he pulls it back and letting it fall upon Harry's bare ass.
"Im a squirrel so I'll be Mrs.Nutty." Hermione adds.
Harry tries to move and hears a metal clinking sound. He froze and glanced around. He had chains holding him prisoner to a wall of some kind of dungeon.
"I have a date I'm almost late for anyway she's eager to hear about Harry.."
While making his way back towards his dorm he found someone else wandering the halls lookung lonely, lost and bored.
He listens to her before adding a second finger shoving them both to the third knuckles, thrusting them in and out hard in fast.
"Draco." He hears Harry whisper through his moans.
Standing he surveyed he heads back down into the castle to find Harry.
Harry stayed at the hospital even when he was cleared, refusing to leave Draco.
"After breakfast I'm taking you to the store, so I can pick out a special collar and name tag for you." Hermione informs him as she wanders the kitchen fixing waffles and eggs.
Waking Neville they hurry to the Hospital.
Draco let his eyes slide over Harry slowly taking in everything.
"Do you like eggs?" Harry asked.
He then picks up the odd looking contraption, and attached it to Harrys Ankles. The device was made to force Harry's Legs to spread further apart and stay that way until removed.
Happy to have found a job he hurries home to share the news with his wife.
Harry stands up and hugs the two of them.
Hermione grinned.
The two of them had been secretly dating each other for almost three years. Never telling anyone about it as each was worried that their families wouldn't approve of them.
Draco meant for this to be as slow as the foreplay..but the feel of Harry's tight ass clamped around his swollen cock, and their pure need broke them both.
Draco turns to Harry.
Inside he finds Ron and Hermione sitting in the arm chair.
Draco sent the owl to Ollivander apologizing for the inconvenience, but taking care of his family had to  come first, and would no longer be able to continue to apprenticeship.
Draco walks over a grin of joy on his face.
Harry grinned at the dude's response to his cooking. Blushing a bit at the compliment.
Harry blushed "im not im a virgin."
"Grimwauld? I think if that's an excellent idea, it would give us both privacy, and will keep any old death eaters who still Believe You Know Who's ways from trying to harm you."
The four of them walk into the room to see Harry holding a baby in his arm as the nurses hold the other three.
There was handcuffs, a horse whip, candles, anothee another odd strange looking device  laying around the blanket.
But Harry refused, looking the Minister in the eye. He says.
The experience was amazing, and hot as the wielding took white hot heat with dragon fire to get the wand the right shape, and texture before he could add the cores into the wand, but Draco loved the rewarding feeling of the work.
"I know Hermione, i miss Harry too, Ivwanna find him as much as you do." Ron responded.
Draco was trying his best to stay positive through everything to keep Harry stress free and comfortable. At the same time he couldn’t wait for these babies to be born. He couldn’t wait to meet them. He couldn’t stop himself from wondering if they’d have a boy or a girl.
"And you wanted me to give up on him." Harry growled.
Petunia laughs “Older than dirt, but they are beautiful. Little Lils looks a lot like your mother, even those beautiful green eyes.”
Within hours the news was on every wizarding radio, sent to every household by daily prophet, even blasted on the muggle tvs.
Severus
Harry starts to think it'll never end, as he tries to stay calm. But finally the iron stops touching his skin and the man leaves the room, and locks it leaving Harry strapped to the table.
Draco was confused for a moment then he felt a small kick and a grin filled his face.
"Ok fine." They grabbed several different items along with bottles of fire whiskey before checking out to go home.
Draco breathed and pulled Harry close, kissing him gently.
She starts kissing his neck, biting him as her body orgasmed, even after her orgasm she continues to move, increasing speed, letting wave after wave of orgasm hit her.
It only took a few hours for Kingsley to send her the document.
Harry grins kissing Draco's cheek.
“Can you fix it for me Ron? I’m so tired.” Luna asked sweetly.
He watched Harry smile at him as he spoke about it.
“It’s fine, really. It didn’t happen, that's all that matters. It’ll take a lot more than this to separate us now.”
A sound he'd been praying to hear for the past couple months.
"Good evening to All, you have been summoned for an announcement.  Tonight for the first time, we will be allowing interested Students to stay up till midnight if they so choose to, in order to celebrate the coming of the new year.
"What confession?" Harry asked.
Porter looks Harry over, "so what might your name be?"
Draco hadn't realized how much he actually cared about Harry, until that moment when Draco looks at the blood on the grass, scared that someone had hurt him, that someone would or had killed his husband.
Dobby does this.
Harry flushed with embarrassment and gets up pissed and starts to march out.
In the mirror looking back was a Black Crow.
Then used the same sectumsempra spell on Draco.
She stripped her panties and bra off so that she only wore her garters.
"Ooh Professor Severus Snape? A date? And she knows Harry, I wonder who that could be?" She teased playfully.
"My son will only sire children with a Pureblood of the finest linage, not some half blood freak, I don't want a single drop of mudblood in my family line."
Lucius touches and paces between the objects with a calculating look on his face before pulling down a really Ugly whip from the wall.
"Fuck , Granger thats soo good." He purrs, turning to putty in her hands.
“Go back to bed babe, I’ll take of them.”
Ideas began to form in Dracos mind, he walked inside the store.
Neville assured her.
"Albus He's a child, and a living soul you cant just use Harry as a Pawn to suite your own needs and fight your own battles for you. You cant just send him to his death." Severus was saying angrily.
Each of the students looked surprised by the suggestion but then shrug.. each Slytherin decide they were in to play, followed by Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw then finally Gryffindor joined.
Harry nods.
Harry does as told sipping the water.
"Come on you two, the professor will be here any moment.." Harry begs the kids.
"I have something to share with you.."
He hurries from the room, searching the castle for Draco.
Harry thought a moment then says "Red"
“Well carrying four means I’ll soon be forced to be on bed rest until they come, so I think we should start planning their nursery this month before I get to big to hold a brush or put cribs together, good thing our house has a lot of bedrooms.” Harry quipped.
The night stares were glistining in the sky as Draco lights the nearby candles.
"Now gag me..then without looking ag me remove the blanket thats on me then please leave the room"
Ramona
Harry wakes slowly with a groan, his head felt like it was on fire. And why did his arms feel weighed down?
“I’m leaving. I’m guessing that’s what you want, with the way your acting with me, I’m guessing you don’t want me anymore.” Draco responds his voice sounding broken.
"First everyone including myself has to drink this Gyradel Syrum, it wards off cheating, once you drink the rules set can not be altered or diviated from. Then one at a time, each person lights their wand then spins it on the floor, who ever the lit end points at, you and the person will go into that closet over there, and you gotta Do It, doesnt matter who it lands on what house they are, you gotta do it with each other. If you refuse the serum will do horrible things to you."
They had fun playing with Dinky and Growler until it was time for the boys to disappear to their beds so as to be up early for the quidditch in the morning.
"Harry James Potter and Draco Lucius Malfoy."
“Do you feel it?” Harry asked.
"As for me Harry, I've decided to take a job working at Hogwarts too, as the new defense teacher."
Harry felt his heavy eyes close again, as he fell back to sleep in Draco's arms.
“Actually, no I mean babies as in quadruplets.” The nurse responds.
But Draco, he fought so hard, and took so much damage from his father that when he finally passed out he slipped into a coma."
They worked together to pick out leashes, and collars for their new puppies along with the food, and toys they'd need.
Draco with one magic word made the hand cuffs fall off as the two of them move together as one, pounding against each other fast hard.
"Mr. Malfoy what happened?" He demanded.
He felt tears in his eyes as he realized how Draco must care about him if he had done all that.
They both agree with Harry.
“What is it Harry?” he asked, concerned.
Draco laid down the whip and picks up the lube off the rock, taking some in his hand he gently inserts a finger inside Harry's ass, and gently strokes him listening to the delightful sound of him.
Hermione laughed
Harry felt his mind racing trying to figure out how to approach this. If he went in there and told him now he might think he was making fun of him.
Finally the train was gone and all the adults went home.
Harry was shocked.
This went on until they lay exhausted on the bed unable to move anymore.
Draco felt weak and could feel himself slipping away from consciousness..but he's trying to fight it,he had to for Harry.
"He's in the bed beside your's,he's still in a coma." Hermione reveals to Harry.
“Young Master Malfoy, I’ve been hearing a lot about you. I think you would do well in this business, if you are willing to learn the ropes.” Ollivander says.
“So our kids will be four months apart.” Ron mused.
Harry felt his heart pound in his chest. His mind trying to process what he had felt.
Draco nods thoughtfully. "Well there's a game on friday and was wondering if you'd like to go?"
Draco felt Harry's body start to shiver and shake under him with need.
Draco stepped forward and puts handcuffs on Harry's wrists pinning them behind his back.
Hermione noticed Harry looking not so good slides a glass of water over to Harry.
Harry gasped at the sparks shooting between them and pulled Draco closer, kissing him deeper.
Draco looks Harry in the face "how experienced are you?"
"So, Neville wanna play wizard's chess?" Hermione suggested pointing towards a table where a chess board sat onna table.
Draco thrusted harder faster..wraping a hand around Harry's cock stroking him at same speed.
"I like following them in the paper, but other than the world cup I never really got to watch or see one enough to really follow it outside school." He admits.
He wore red and green nipple Clamps with jingle bells hanging from them, with crotchless red and  Green boxers. Harry's penis wrapped in a big red bow like a present.
Draco sighed "I understand I will Do what ever it takes to find him."
“Whelp I’m off to bed, I’ll see y'all in the morning.” He says going in to kiss Harry, except the latter had avoided it, and was now giving Draco a cold shoulder.
Harry whines every once in a while as he slept, as his body twinges in pain every now and then.
Draco rubs his hands between Harry's legs searching for him..then gently slips a finger inside.
This Draco dyes Red and white stripes so that it looked like a candy cane.
Draco noticed Harry biting his lips but chalks it up as nerves.
When Draco was finally able to bring Harry and the babies home, Draco told his husband about the job as they both prepared formula for the four babies.
"It's Harry, he's gone missing, I'm going with Draco to help him find him." Rom responded.
But it bothered Draco to no end that Harry was out there all alone, and nobody was looking for him. Draco knew Harry, had watched him from afar for years learning the boys ways.
Harry strides over to his husband and the puppies, and scoops up two of the puppies, the one Draco was playing with and one that Harry picks out carefully before taking to the counter.
Draco confused wanders over. “Harry? What’s going on? You never dodge my kisses why now?”
She set up the dog bowls filling one with water, setting them by the tables.
Harry, look's to Draco before saying. "You know this isn't so bad really. Being married to you. So far it's been nice actually."
"I've known since 1st year I've wanted to be with you..and every year that passed I only found myself falling more for you."
It was satisfying to watch the once strong boy, turning to pure putty under his mouth and tongue.
Atticus starts to cry at that moment as he seen, Draco wasn't  bluffing.
Draco attaches the hand cuffs to his arms and legs.
He gently put each of the babies into bed, kissing each one on the forehead, smiling as the four of them snuggle close to each other. The four of them shared the crib cause they liked to snuggle with each other to feel the other one close to them.
"Draco, I'm so glad you woke up. I was so afraid you wouldn't." Harry whispered.
No stop thinking like that, he told himself. He would deal with his father then take his mate to mongos to be healed.
"Where'd Draco go?" Harry asked still scanning the room.
“They’re beautiful.” Draco breathed.
Simon
And is pleased when he hears her cries grow louder.
Draco smiled knowing Granger the library is where she would be. Possibly looking for some spell that would help them find Potter.
Draco grins as he slides himself into Harry.
Neville was pleased that Hermione wanted so badly to have his baby.
Harry flipped to the page and found thst the potion was in fact made for gay males and was irreversible. It gave men the inner parts needed to create a baby, including a womb and a bity canal that would allow a man to birth babies
Harry scream loudly as the sudden pleasure takes over his body.
He went shop to shop chatting with different shop owners, about job possibilities.
Holding their puppies and equipment they appearate home.
They kiss and dresses abd head downstairs as they knew the curfew was about close.
"Maybe we can just pretend to you know..surely nobody would know.."
Draco looks over at Harry hearing a note of nervousness in his tone.
Draco smiled "water, can i get some water? I'm thirsty."
She grins and circled him.
What a kiss. Harry smiled, the kiss had been nice and had felt pretty good. He hoped Draco would kiss him again in the future. Maybe it would help make them more comfortable. He knew they only had a limited amount of time to try and get comfortable with things. And hoped that eventually he'd be able to grow to trust Draco and care for him the way a husband should.
Harry laughs.
After eating Draco helped Harry clean the kitchen before sending out an owl to the Quidditch box office.
The things he dreampt about this boy often left Harry's sheets soaked of both sweat and the evidence of his wild wet dreams.
Harry cries out loudly..glad for once the room was soundproof.
Draco leans forward, and lightly brushes his lips across Harry's in a very light kiss.
Harry's eyes grinned appreciatively "nice wine choice Draco."
Harry shook himself and nods.
She'd been in shock ever since she'd heard the name of her partner. Never had she imagined she'd be married to the boy that was always picked on and bullied all through their school years. The boy whose memory was as slippery as a bar of soap.
"What would be the fun in that? You boy, have been a thorn in my side since the day you were born, so I'm going to make your life a living hell before that little heart stops beating."
Harry tries to boggle his brain for the Slytherin's name..
Boys:
He slowly  feels his body adjusting to his size, and starts to move his hips.
“So what’s up with you two so far?” Ron asked.
“Sir, are you still looking for that apprentice? I’d be really interested in it.”
Harry climbed onto Draco's lap, before mumbling a quick lubrication spell. He kissed Draco deeply as he guide's Draco to his entrance.
"I was trying to figure out where you disappeared to." He adds.
And Lucius used his own spell on Draco causing him to start bleeding out.
Harry felt his eyes close as he gently kissed back.
His eyes were open, and he was slowly starting to sit up.
Of the good food There was a slab of frozen ground beef,  a few cans of beans, and vegetables, tomato sauce and ketchup, flour, breadcrumbs and an onion.
Finally Draco strips and climbs on top of Harry..
Just then the front door opens and Ron walks in carrying a grocery bag.
Draco nods pulling a tube of lube from his robes..
Harry looks up at Draco grinning with a smile on his face.
"I want us to go get some groceries, I want you to go with me so we can have something else to bond over besides being able to find out what foods you may or may not like." Harry responded.
"It's ok, Draco, Molly has him."
"Draco? Where's Draco?" Harry mumbled remembering he'd been hurt to.
Backing up not wanting to fight with Draco he starts to go back the other way when a vouce speaks up.
He puts a gallon of milk into the cart as well, the meats section found Harry and Draco arguing.
Draco removing them Shoves Harry against the wall..grabs his hips and plunged down deep into Harry.
As they lay in bed, Harry lays looking up at the ceiling before grabbing a quill and parchment.
Harry lay in his bed his mind racing with what he heard.
Then laps up the red drops.
Harry was constantly having dreams about having the quads. Sometimes he’d see four boys running around the house, sometimes there were three boys being terrorized by their sister, once he saw two of each together. But in every dream Harry was imagining there to be boys in the mix.
The two proceed to have sex again, several times throughout the night perfectly content to becin each other's arms.
"Dear Mr. Potter,
The two of them share a hug once more. Harry was starting to get tired and hungry, so bidding Hermione goodnight, he and Draco finally headed home.
Maybe this was some kinda sick dark twisted nightmare? Maybe he fell asleep waiting for his detention. Maybe just a dream playing tricks on him.
Fear coursed through his chest, what had happened? Where was his husband? Draco knew he was going to need all the help he could get to find his husband!
Instead of moving him she pulls a clean blanket and drapes it over the boy and wanders back to her duties.
Ron had been planning to ask Luna to marry him at the end of the graduation even before knowing about the goblet.
Ron blushed a deeper shade of red. "Pansy Parkinson. I mean if you can date Draco, then why cant i admit to the crush ive had on pansy since my father and i met her family when i was only six?"
As he walks in he walks up to the counter and blushing tells the mediwitch that he wanted to get a pregnancy test, to be a hundred percent sure if he was, even though his wand had told him he was.
As he waits for Dumbledore, his mind wandered back, back to the night of his fourth year..
Apprentice Needed
Harry realizing he forgot a step sighed
But as he passed Moaning Myrtles bathroom..he heard Draco crying and telling his sorrows To Myrtle.
Ollivander beamed at the boy
She grinned realizing he was enjoying it.
Harry was actually shocked that Hermione had shared the info with him.
Hermione sets a nice herbal chamomile tea in front of Harry and gives Draco a fire whiskey at his request.
Harry beamed "maybe but I wanted to do it. It made you happy..so I did it."
"I can't believe how incredibly stupid, my godson had been trying to attack a former death eater on his own. He coulda been killed." Snape was saying.
Harry exits the Room of Requirements and goes to the Gryffindor common room.
Draco looked in awe as he took one from the nurse.
"Yes, that sounds swell America should do nicely." Harry beamed.
Next to bed was bottles of lubricants.
Draco nods his head “Well okay, I agree lets get a second opinion, the spell could be faulty.”
Harry laughes at that familiar arrogance that his Draco was so well known for.
Harry falls into the water and blacked out.
Draco waited a moment to catch his breath then says
"But Severus thats why Draco sent you that owl, he probably knew you'd come, and was probably stalling Lucius to keep Harry alive. The four of us tried to help..but he was too strong for even four combined. Besides whatever happened, happened, it's over and done with all that matters is that both recover."
Draco touched Harry's nipple clamps tugging them, making them jingle. Then reaches for the ladle and dips it into the gravy boat.
It seemed to take forever and Harry sweats glancing at clock as doubts run through his mind.
He had sworn to himself to never touch a dark art again so instead he reached in his mind for the defensive spells he learned from school.
Ron beamed "yes , i love that idea."
That decided on they started discussing plans. Ron would Spy on Mcgonagall, Hermione weroukd ssfpy on Snape, and Draco would spy on Dumbledore.
Its been really hard for me to admit the truth of how i feel about you..
In the dorm Harry takes Ron and Hermione aside.
~Harry
“Tea is fine.” Harry responded he was sure Butter Beer wasn’t safe to drink while carrying.
Finally his eyes close once more and sleep finally claims his conscience
Grinning Harry nods.
When he found none. Draco poured a bigger drizzle over Harry's chest. Then bending over Draco runs the tip of his tongue slowly, over the gravy trail as his hand drizzles more gravy, as the tip of his tongue follows the trail.
The scrapping of the locks has Harry's eye bolt open in raw fear, as Lucius walks in holding some kinda knife in his hands.
"Harry are you okay? I heard you whimpering and came to check on you." He whispered.
"Would you like to talk about it?" Draco offered "I will gladly listen."
"Harry." Harry " he mumbled as he felt himself being carried.
The castle was filled with feastings and pride as Seventh Year students lined up in the great hall, a table holding scrolls sitting behind Albus Dumbledore.
He pulled his mouth away to respond.
"Thanks guys."
Sitting up Harry dresses and finds himself wondering if his friends missed him as he did them. Wondered if anyone noticed? How long before they sent a search party? How long before they figure out why he left?
Draco and Ron both try. To his surprise he watched Ron Disappear and get replaced by what. A cute pink pot belly pig.
She was gorgeous, she was currently bald with light green eyes.
Draco then nudges Harry to remind him of why there were there to begin with.
He grimaced when he watched Ron nervousky disappear inside with a tall black girl..
'now how am i going to get this other hand cuff on?'
He heard Draco moaning loudly, felt Draco threading fingers through his hair.
"Tell me now or I'll kill you slow and painfully till you spill." Draco warned.
Draco used his love for Harry to stay strong, and remembered what Snape taught him, he closed his mouth and sent a nonverbal spell instead.
Harry felt somewhat guilty, but still he was pissed at Draco.
But where to start? Harry could have gone anywhere. Anywhere at all.
"Draco, tell me the truth please, why do you hate me?" Harry blushed at his question heart hammering.
"Harry wait please, I'm not laughing At you, I was laughing because we have the same exact problem. I too am Gay, I didn't even attend the dance cause I couldn't stomach the idea of dancing with someone that wasn't a guy. Instead I told everyone else the dance was lame and that I'd rather go to bed early. But honestly i got so bored and lonely, when I seen my best friends Crabbe and Goyle having fun and I had nobody special to share the night with, so i was just out there wandering to try and keep mind off things and I ended up running into you of all people "
Pulling on his dark locks.
"No Luna this could be dangerous, you stay here."
The station was packed, with the new law the number of kids going to Hogwarts this year were several times higher then in other years. Even some of the older witches and wizards had contributed to the numbers.
They were both drenched in sweat as draco rolls off and lays on his back breathing heavily.
Harry felt his vision start to go in and out, as Lucius started stabbing the knife into Harry's body instead of cutting.
She applied to a position at the Saint Mongos to be a mediwitch. Curiously she looks to Neville and asked
"Careful Harry, or you might awaken the beast." Draco warns.
After several hours of being a nervous wreck a nurse wanders in and comes over to them.
Draco looked towards the oven, "those smell amazing!"
But Harry was concerned how was he going to get himself hooked up by himself?
Pushing a cart they travel the aisles discussing what they liked.
Harry grinned.
"I'm in the mood to be naughty." Harry tells him.
Harry thought of Snape and how the wizard had stood up for him against Albus. Harry felt a new found respect for the potion master  Harry never knew that Snape really actually cared about him.
Draco loved the picture cause it was hot and it was a moment when Harry for once was relaxed and looked happy.
"No Harry, the potion we took would know."
"Potter will be." Draco says when Harry cant speak up.
The old man had a sign over the door.
The castle erupts with thunder of applause, and ends with a hug from Aunt Petunia as Harry heads to a seat at the graduate table and waits as the other students are called up one by one.
“I actually came here today because I wanted my friends to be the first to know that I was two months pregnant with quadruplets.” Harry reveals.
Hoping to a mirror, he admires how regal he looked.
Neville though, lay awake even though he pretended to sleep. He felt an uncomfortable tightness in his pajamas, he'd never told anyone before that he'd always had hidden  feelings for Hermione. Always desired her. Had always wanted to ask her out while at school but had been too scared to try. And now having her laying so close beside him, legally his...his body ached to hold her, to touch her and claim her as his own.
But makes no comment as the nurse takes Draco's vitals.
" Draco, please I really dont feel like..fighting with you right now..I was just heading back to my common room." He whispered.
"Take care of Harry first." Draco begs who ever  was carrying him.
Harry watching closer as others were matched and noticed only gay couple were made to drink from the cauldron and only one of the two were chosen in the match to drink it.
Draco goes to library and hust as suspected their both elbows deep in a mountain of books as Hermione kept adding more to the mountain.
"All this was actually my idea, i talked my buddy into suggesting the game, the potion wasnt actually a potion..and I jinxed your wand so it would land on me on purpose." Draco admits.
It seemed like a perfectly ordinary day..as Harry wanders the hall after a particularly nasty day in potions.
"Mmm kinky." Neville whispers.
Together the two of them went into the hospital to see about getting a document from them saying that they were medically unable to have a child.
Tom seeing the young boy's face comes over "why the long face?"
"But why? Why do that?" Harry asked surprised.
Draco's hand slipped up Harry's shirt a bit, as they kiss.
Draco punched him several times asking him over and over again asking the same question and getting the same answers.
Or maybe just gotten lost. But why hadn't Harry sent him a Patronus to alert him he needed help?
"Dobby can you help me with something?"
She woke him every two hours fucking him good and hard, until he'd cum again.
Draco sit up in his bed under the covers with his wand lit. Staring at a photo graph in his hand.
"After hearing that I feel even more like a jerk for how I treated you, you've been through so much and me bullying you..I'm so amazed at how you stayed being a kind a good person rather than going dark like You know who. "
"you better come back to me Mr. Malfoy, you can't leave me now, we have so much left to do in our relationship you know.  Need a couple little Malfoys running around."
Harry stared in awe as he boarded the boat, the smell of salty sea water floated into his nose as his eyes tried to take in the sights of the boat.
Hermione nods.
Finally she nods and says "to find Harry I'll do it though it will be long and time consuming."
His eyes were burning as he started again to form the words for the killing curse but this time directed at the four unconscious bodies on the floor.
Harry nods and gets into position.
Nurse turns to them and ssys "well it appears Mr. Malfoy is fully recovered and fine to go home but let us know if you find any complications."
Kingsley sighed.
For now on, Hermione wanted him to use those instead of the furniture.
Harry wanders in just as Draco was zipping it up.
Hermione Granger
Lucius barked and laughed
"Can..can you help me with something? Just like you i want to help find Potter. I swear my reasons are pure. I know I've picked on him in the past..but its..its because I Liked Him and didnt know how to admit it."
Harry nods agreeing.
"Severus if he hadn't have acted when he did, Harry would have died..Draco did what he felt he had to to protect his mate, if he'd hesitated an extra minute, Harry would have been lost." Hermione responds softly.
Draco's heart beat hard as he reached the door to his family home.
"I can't find a decent job, so I can start supporting my wife. I don't wanna see my wife go through life the way my own family did." He admits.
They three go up to Moaning Myrtles Bathroom for privacy and Hermione starts working with Draco to help him learn it although she didnt know how either. She was intelligent though Draco knew if anyone can pull it off it was Granger.
They sit at the table and enjoy dinner as they talked about quidditch and then what they wanted out of the relationship.
Draco approached the man
He nearly drooled as he saw in her hands a pair of handcuffs and a feather wand.
He does as instructed and pulls the fingers out.
"Eww, Harry no just no, no fish! And definitely no liver, those are disgusting."
Neville was out in the greenhouse he had built in the backyard, weeding the herbal plants when Hermione walked in.
"Harry you really didn't have to do that.." Draco grinned. He'd always wanted a dog but his father had always said no saying that puppies were disgusting creatures that were completely useless.
Harry thought a moment.
“Well, I can see you look like y'all can use a rest so we’ll go ahead and go, I need to go see Hermione before I go get rest myself.” Harry announced.
As Hermione’s baby bump grew, Neville came in from work some days to find Hermione singing or reading to the baby bump while rubbing it lovingly.
Harry felt a surge of hope in his chest as he asked softly "what is it? Please tell me i swear I won't laugh or tell another living soul."
Hermione stood and sent in an owl to the Ministry requesting a copy of the marriage agreement they had signed so that she could reread it and make sure she followed the agreement so as not to get in trouble for unknowingly breaking any.
Smiling in his sleep.
Harry watched as his best friend Ron marries Luna Lovegood. He watched Ron's look of shock even as they were sent out too.
Harry hurried to his bedside to help him up.
Harry sighed as Ana was having a tantrum in her high chair while her twin brother Alex ran around the living room naked evading Harry's many attemots to get pants on him.
The four of them go to the living room where Ron hands Luna a thing of Caviar, a can of cheese whiz, and a loaf of bread.
Harry takes Draco’s hands.
“Just never mind it, I got to get the kids into bed.” Harry snapped before pulling each baby out of the chair and placing two into baby carrier on his chest, and two into a stroller and taking them into the nursery.
"Alright Kane, we leave in the morn for now we rest."
Harry returns his attention to Draco's length licking and sucking him again until he's once again putty under him.
"Wait you mean your going to support my crush on her?" Ron asked surprised.
“What about Simon?” Draco put out.
"Draco it's going to be okay we'll find him." Kingsley assured Draco quickly.
"Stop." She commands.
"How about for now, go to her and invite her to sit with you during the celebration tonight."
He waits another hour then puts out the fire, and heads off towards the water to locate Harry.
It would have been almost easy for Draco to take Harry right there..but instead Draco broke the kiss and pulled away.
Ron answered the door looking tired and wearing only his boxers.
Now that Harry was restrained, Draco stands picking up the horse whip.
"You mean you've never been with someone? Then where did you learn how to do that with your mouth?"
He floo networked for Molly and the order, and several came in to help carry you and Draco here to St. Mongos.
“Oh, Harry, I never realized. I thought it was necessary to get a job to help support our family, but I never realized that at the same time I was neglecting our family. I’ve barely even spent time with our kids.” Draco hung his head.
Now that he knew what Dumbledore felt about him. He'd be Bloody well damn of he allowed himself to be a pawn any longer.
"Sounds great."
Neville swallowed, unable to take eyes off her.
And now he points his wand at Draco, using the cruciatus curse over and over listing to Draco scream.
Harry takes the pamphlet of all the things he needed to do to keep them healthy, and places it in his pocket.
The students arranged themselves in a cirlcle arranged in a boy girl pattern to make the chances more even.
Hermione grinned "lets make up names for our animal forms. So we talk about therrm without people catching on."
The owner rings up the sale and Harry pays before putting one of the puppies into Draco's arms.
This chapter is about Ron and Luna
Shacklebolt cleared his throat and says.
Harry's hand shook as he signed his name. Slughorn pulls the goblet and looks between them.
Harry watch Dyvon take the potion flask and take a swallow then pass it to the person next to him.
"How about we head up to bed, Snape would love to take points from you or give you detention." Draco suggested.
Harry couldn't quit wipe the smile off his face. He had just lost his virginity to Draco, and he was still high on the sex pheromones.
As time continued to pass, Draco started helping Harry with the babies, the two of them taking turns getting up to take care of them until the babies were finally old enough to start sleeping through the night.
“You can start tonight if you’d like or wait until tomorrow, it’s up to you.” Ollivander responded.
A tap on the shoulder and a turn around revealed a big burly muscular man with a tattoo of an anchor on his biceps.
"I guess with everything I went through I can't stand for other people to suffer." Harry shrugged.
Hermione cries into Neville’s chest. Even when Hermione was cleared to leave, the baby was still being kept for observation, to see if she was going to survive.
After sending it off.
Harry started to say no, afraid tgis was some kind of trick to humiliate him, but Harry spots the loneliness Draco tries to hide deep behind the blondes eyes.
He pulls his fingers out of her and spreads her legs further apart. He lowers his body over her, slowly guiding his large cock inside her.
He pay close attention as together all three try to follow the instructions.
She  bounces and moves her hips moaning out his name as she moves.
She loved her daughter so much, and having watched her fight so hard, Hermione was having a hard time accepting that she was actually fine, and was growing and thriving despite her premature start. She only slept when Neville would agree to take over watching over the baby in her place.
“I am willing sir, I have always had a fascination with wands, and wanting to know how they work.”
She watched him jerk then growl, but noticed his little man twitch.
Kingsley had tried many times to convince Harry to give up on Draco, pull the plug on him and marry someone else.
Draco watches Harry looking impressed. "Wow had no idea you could cook."
Draco used a voice to make his voice boom loud as he screams…
"The real reason I pick on you is cause I've had a crush on you since the moment you walked into that robe shop. I guess you can say I was smitten with you. But then I saw you with Weasley and Granger and I somehow imagined you were dating Granger, and I thought maybe if I teased and picked on you I could kill my crush on you. But instead it's onky grown stronger over the years." Draco admits.
"He coulda called me...he coulda floo networked the order, he should have asked for help.." Snape growled.
“Merry Christmas Draco.”
But not only that but Harry realized that everyone had been matched and taken outside except two people!
"Trying to direct your swimmers to my eggs so I can try and get pregnant." She responded.
Harry creates a lie.
Harry nods "yup, can't wait to go see that."
The nurses wandered in and shewing everyone out.
Draco sits up rubs his eyes and grins at the food set up.
“And scardy cat, Neville goes along with that without being scared of it?” Draco asked clearly surprised himself.
Harry glanced over at the bed beside him and his heart nearly broke at the sight of him.
"It was in the paper, and the radio of course I knew you two would come find me." She grinned.
Harry nodd "Hogwarts will feel strange without the people we went to school with, But it would be cool to be able to return to Hogwarts again every year."
But Lucius strapped him back up to the table this time his back was against the table, so he was looking up at the ceiling.
"We're sorry, Harry we've been really bad friendd to you. I wouldnt blame you if you hate us for our behavior. Malfoy may have bullied and picked on us for years, but if he makes you happy..then as true friends should we should be Supporting you not being shits to you. For now on we will respect and support you no matter who you choose to date."
Harry clung tighter to him for a moment, as Draco slowly pets the messy dark locks of hair.
Grumbling under his breath Draco gets dressed glaring at Harry.
Draco looked at Harry shock then shrugged standing.
Harry falls asleep thinking about everything wondering if the Weasleys would allow Ron to do it.
At times Harry grew somewhat resentful of Draco having the apprenticeship, although Harry knew Draco believed they needed the money to care for four children, Harry hated that he was having to juggle parenting essentially on his own.
"That's not All Harry, I found out last week she's pregnant with my child, you're getting another cousin." He revealed with a grin.
He gently squeezed her boobs as he continued to rock into her.
"sure, I'd love to go."
Looking up he smiles at Draco. “Two girls and two boys.” Harry told him, smiling.
"Potter are you truly sure that this is what you want? Are you really wanting me?"
Waiting outside was a thestral drawn carriage.
Harry lays on the bed and puts hand cuff that were attached to the bed around his ankles..then he puts magical clamps on his nipples that would give tiny electric shocks when touched. Then finally a handcuff to a wrist then he was stuck
Severus pulls Draco into his arms “any word on him yet?”
“Merry Christmas Harry.”
Their appearance though had managed to distract Lucius,from the person behind him.
"Oh Ron you're my friend i will miss you dearly." Harry whispers.
Draco nods "it's definitely interesting. Are you ready for that Quidditch game tomorrow?"
Harry glanced at them curiously before glancing towards the visitors table where the families of the graduating students waited for their new family wizard to receive their graduation certificate.
Whispering he asks "to your parents place or do you wanna go with me to the house my Godfather left me?"
Harry looked at Draco before responding “Well, I came over cause I wanted my friends to be the first to know that I’m pregnant, and that’s not all. I’m having quadruplets.”
Here Draco finds what he needs, buying a few odds and ends along with some candy canes and twizzlers.
The two of them had after several hours of talking about names picked Celina, after watching her in the incubator fighting.
But when the game was done they retired to a bed they'd share, but instead of  trying anything he went to sleep.
"relax potter I'm not after a fight tonight either. I'm guessing we're both bored? Both our friends are still at the dance, how about we go up to the room of requirements and just you know..hang out and talk for a bit..?"
She soon picks out a black leather collar  she paid the store owner to sew a patch onto the collar with Neville's name on it.
“would be against me naming a girl Narcissa after my mother?” Draco asked softly.
Harry stood in utter shock. Dumbledore was only using him? Harry felt hot tears sting his eyes, and his stomach start to feel sick. Then there was a fiery surge of Rage as he wondered in his mind what to do now. What was best way to respond to this.
When Harry remained limp, Lucius growled and pulled Harry from the table. Dragging the boy by his hair again he threw him back in the cell and walking away not bothering to rechain the boy.
Harry beamed "that's awesome, Uncle Severus."
Harry gets up and walks forward trying to hide his shaking hands, everything inside him screaming for him to run. But he continues forward trying to ignore the raw fear that laced him.
"Harry i know but what about the safety of our child? You can owl them or what ever..or better yet invite them to come with?" Draco suggested.
Draco punched the wizard in the stomach.
Draco laughs he couldn't help it it seemed to suite him so well.
Harry giggled as Draco comes to and sits up “How on earth are we going to juggle four babies at once?” The blonde asked.
After looking for a long while they finally run into each at the library.
"Beg me for it Harry"
The shop was much bigger on the inside then it looked outside. There were real reindeer inside, hitched to a sleigh. And a big man sat on a bug red chair pretending to be Santa. While a house elf stood beside him directing the kids to Santa's lap.
The with smiled wider “The tests are clear, you Mr. Potter are pregnant. Here are some pamphlets, and I’m going to prescribe you a couple potions to take daily, it’ll help give your babies extra vitamins.”
Harry felt tears sting his eyes but he pushed them back, no he couldn't let Lucius win.
Unbidden Harry felt tears well up in his eyes...
He thrusts deep into her and holds his position as his cum fills Hermione's body.
Harry grins at the one he'd picked out as it shook the toy growling at it. "So fierce." Harry teased.
Harry slid out of bed and got dressed. The two of them ate a quick breakfast of eggs and sausage before shouldering the tent and sleeping bags before heading out.
The two them soon drift off to sleep in each others arms curled up on the bed, with Draco’s hand over where the baby bump would soon be showing.
"What are you doing?" Neville asked.
He starts to knock on the closed door but hears a heated conversation going on behind it and his name pop up. Curious Harry leans against door to listen.
Finally when all Students were seated, Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt stood up to face the crowd.
Nobody was making an effort to look for him. All Dumbledork would say was they wanted to let Harry have his space. Let him cool down and was adamant that with time the boy would return.
He sent an owl to Severus, telling him where you were and that he was fixing to go get you.
Hermione would just smile and nod loving how excited Neville was to be a father.
Harry passed out asleep as soon as he hit the bed.
Harry grins "growing up with uncle Vernon, I had to."
The four come back "He's not here Draco."
Draco gets up from the chair and leads Harry to the bed.
And now that he knew these things Staying at Hogwarts would be Folly. As Albus would force him to do things  anyway.
I know I'm the last person you wanna hear from right now..but i have nobody else i can ask..i need your help with something..Meet me in the room of requirements at exactly 6 O clock. Burn this after reading it.
Joining the pups on the floor they toss toys around for them to fetch and bring back.
Hermione hardly ever slept, constantly she’d find herself in Celina’s room watching as the baby breathed watching for any signs of any thing wrong.
"Which of you will be the submissive partner?"
Finally the carriage stops in front of Grimwauld.
"So you would let me fuck you..if i hadn't done this, you'd never have given me time of day, i wanted you to see how good having sex could be..but thing is..I dont want this to be the end of it..I want to continue to explore sex with you. What do you say? Are intrested in being No Strings attached Sex Buddies?"
Ron gave a gasp, and moaned as her slick heat sheathed him. Bloody hell she was tight, and slick.
“Come on Harry, please tell me what’s going on? I can’t fix what ever is wrong if you won’t talk to me.” Draco says softly.
To find out where heccxwent Draco knew he would need to investigate why Harry left in the first place.
Hermione informed him.
She placed the collar around his neck and clipped the leash to it and led him home by the collar.
After years of the abuse at home, after the battle the truth about Vernon had finally come out. He was not a muggle, like everyone believed but a loyal Voldemort supporter that had been manipulating Petunia for years with the Imperious curse. The Ministry had caught him and sent him to Azkaban when they'd been escorted to the safe house, and another wizard had recognized him for what he was.
The babies were growing like weeds, and with each passing week the babies started looking more handsome and beautiful.  Now that Draco was helping Harry, their relationship was back to flourishing like it always had.
"A coma? How? what happened?" Harry demands.
"HELP Someone please Help!" Draco yells eyes burning as tears flow down his face.
But after Snape had gotten bit by Nagini at Voldemort's Command, Harry had used everything he'd learned from Slughorn to force a snake bite cure down his throat. And rushed him to the hospital wing for further care from Pomfrey.
Ron grinned happily "I like that idea. Good you can start your training tomorrow if you would like."
"You follow the professional Quidditch Games?" Draco asked with a grin. Looking for a topic they both enjoyed.
Felt an arm wrap around him. "You stupid fool." Snape grumbled.
Draco heard footsteps as more people entered the room, felt himself lifted from the ground.
As everyone well knows, Voldemort's terror has resulted in a catastrophic amount of witch and wizard losses. The wizard world needs to recuperate these losses so The Ministry has come together to create a New Wizarding Law!
He unchains Harry and removes the hand cuffs. Grabbing the lubricant off the dresser cursing softly.
Pushing his way in he hurries, as fast as he could towards the room he knew all too well. The room where his father often liked to torture and kill anyone that he could get away with.
I have decided it is finally time to hang up my hat, and retire, And I have spoken with The Minister Of Magic, I would like to offer you a Job as the new Hogwarts Headmaster.
The two of them enter the closet and lock it behind them.
"Hey Harry, can you help me with something?"
“Draco was up and dressing quickly, and grabbed the emergency pack they had prepared and rushed Harry to Saint Mongo’s by appearation.
He kmats down as the two summon their owls and send messages to their families detailing everything about what theyre wanting to do.
"Sorry, Harry didn't mean to hurt you, I'm just glad you're ok, I..we thought you were dead.."
Harry turns to face the blonde that was quickly closing the distance between them.
Draco guides himself To Harrys Opening then whispers into his ears.
Everyone's head turned to the tall Slytherin.
Harry quickly grabs a cup of water and brings it to Draco. Then glared at Kingsley.
Harry nods as the mediwitch goes over the do’s and don’ts of taking care of himself. When the words the witch used suddenly registered in Draco’s mind.
Draco saved him? Wait both recover? Draco was hurt? Because of him?
"If its to find Harry I'll help." Hermione says cautiously.
"I dont wanna live in fear of deatheaters killing our child or killing the nan that im in love with..as for me..my family is a bunch of assholes."
Draco decided he needed to learn to be an animingus.
Harry kissed Draco.
Draco looked at Harry surprised.
Harry watched his own four kids mingle with his cousins kids. Before getting onto the train.
Even more troubling was that there was one boy in particular that haunted his dreams late at night.
The two men rolled into bed, had sex and fell asleep cuddling each other. When one of the babies started crying, and Harry started to get up Draco gets up instead.
Harry grins.
Harry gets himself ready as they head out together to the grocery store.
"My vows were to love, honor and cherish my husband until death parts us. He may be in a coma but he is not Dead yet. And I will not pull the plug. If he dies, he'll do it on his own. I will stay by My Draco's side until he wakes or dies naturally on his own. When that Goblet choose Malfoy to be my partner I thought there had to be some mistake..that this would be a match made from hell for me. What I did not expect was not only for him to love me, but for myself to fall in love with him. And honestly I didn't just fall in love either. I think these feelings have been slowly growing since we kids in school. I was too young a naïve to recognize my feelings for him, until the Goblet forced us to acknowledge them. I'm sorry I jus.." Harry cuts himself off as he hears a sound interrupt his speech.
Harry stood in line behind Ron and Hermione, a look of relief on his face. He'd finally done it. He had set himself straight and completed all his required NEWTs to graduate. He'd been so sure Snape would fail him in defense.
She placed pillows under herself so that her hips were inclined.
When they finally come, Ron pulls out and lays holding her in his arms. "Bloody brilliant." He mumbled in her ears as they lazily fell asleep naked in each other's arms.
Harry was a very missed up dude. Although he was a virgin he had very kinky thoughts.
Harry blushed.
So that meant he needed to find a way to eavesdrop on everyone.
She took a leave from her job, to take good care of herself and allowed Neville to become the family supporter. Neville loved the smile that now had a place on his wife’s face, and he loved the idea of becoming a father.
He felt her body stretching itself to accommodate him. And gave a testing thrust into her.
Harry hugs Draco.
Harry sent a reply to Dumbledore to accept the position.
Harry slowly wondered if Lucius had decided to stop and leave him there for the night.
The three of them pop over to Neville's house and pound on the door.
He was sure she was a nice girl and all but tge truth was Harry was secretly gay. But had asked the girl to the dance to keep up appearances cause he was afraid his two hest friends would be disgusted if they knew the truth.
"No beets, or Brussel sprouts, those are so gross." Harry grimaced.
Slowly Harry drifted to sleep.
The Draco glanced his way, told Harry that he could probably since Harry's fears but stayed silent.
Neville grins and kisses her cheeks.
Draco left his room and tries to predict where his objective helpers would be hanging at this hour.
He watched Harry nod.
Draco pulls his tongue away and lines his body up with Harry's.
"Then I wanna come too!" Luna says firmly.
"Fine." He grumbled.
Then he slipped a finger inside her all the way to the knuckle. And starts finger fucking her.
Draco starts drizzling the gravy back down over his stomach and over Harrys bare stretched arms and legs, and drizzled some through the hole in the boxers so that it covered Harrys bare ass.
"Today Potter it is time to end this..today. now you will die." The man sneered.
By the time they stopped for the night, Draco was exhausted, but pleased knowing in his heart he'd found his niche, found a job worth doing.
Tanner was a wild red headed child, he loved to pull pranks and was always getting into some kind of trouble, but was Ron and Luna’s only child.
They share a kiss as they lay in bed wrapped in each other's arms.
He wrapped his arms around her waist, as he started moving under her, thrusting upwards into her.
Meanwhile Draco breaks into another death eater's house, and like the other one pins him to the wall demanding to know where Harry was.
He strips himself of his robes before pulling Draco's hospital blanket wide open.
“Of course Harry, if that ever happened, I know I for one will personally take care of them for you.” Hermione agreed.
A nurse took her back into a room and ran a few tests.
“How about Natalie? Or Natalia?”
Dracos vision was blurry and his mind clouded he couldn't make out who it was that had just appeared but, somewhere in his mind he knew who it was without being able to see him.
Harry takes Draco's hand, tears in his eyes.
He felt a small nudge in his heart as he watched him.
Dobby really confused puts the ball and gag in Harrys mouth uncovers Harry with a hand over his eyes. Then with a poof was gone.
Draco put on a santa suit but leaves the zipper down so that his penis poked through the opening.
Harry feeling the same way finally nods "ok Draco I'm game if you are."
Draco didn't care in that moment if he got sent to Azkaban all he cared about was finding his husband.
Harry then sealed the letter signing it and then goes up to Owlery and gives it to a school owl.
"Harry, that's awesome, we would be working together.
Severus smirked.
Neville nods as they continue, he whimpers and moans as he tries to hold back.
Somehow or another there was magic in them cause for the rest of the night, Harry's sleep was dreamless until morning.
Samuel
"MINE! you are mine Harry only mine. Say it Harry..tell me your mine." Draco begs Harry as they both get close to the edge.
Draco clapped Harry on the shoulder.
"Please Draco."
But after some time Harry, finally found himself passing out.
Draco had tears in his eyes.
She dropped to her knees and licks along his base, listening to him moan softly, as she swirled her tongue around the base and tip. Stroking his balls with her fingers.
Harry was puffed up with pride over his kids. He still couldn’t believe it had been so many of them. But he had come to terms with the idea over time as he’d gotten used to four feet kicking at once when not happy with him.
Stroking and thrusting until they both cum hard.
But looking her in the face he knew he could not refuse her.
Hermione felt herself dripping between her legs, as she organisms against his fingers.
The spell pulls Lucius off the floor holding him upside down by his ankle.
Draco sighed
“I feel fine, sore, but the meds they gave me are easing it a bit.”
"I want it." Harry whines.
Next the two of them go to Hermione and Neville’s house.
"What do you have planned in that slytherin little brain of yours?" He teased.
After the war, Lucius had beaten and killed Narcissa, for lying about Harry being dead.
"I shoulda known better then to come down here with you..of course you'd find it funny. The Harry Potter, the boy that's actually gay "
"I was having nightmares about stuff from the past." Harry admits.
“wait, I wanna go visit my friends, and tell them the good news.” Harry breathed softly.
Neville grinned "I actually have an interview. On friday with someone who needs a herbalist to work with magical plants, and things."
"Nice to know you like it..I kinda secretly watched porn when I was going up. Learned a few things."
"On the bed Harry and I want you to be spread eagle like your doing a Snow angel only dont move."
"There and this little guy is yours." Harry says watching the pure joy on Draco's face.
Harry although in shock himself, placed a hand over his waist.
Eventually Severus entered the room with Pertunia and Dudley in tow now that he had officially married her.
When morning came Ron kissed her as he made coffee for them, grinning as he looked her flushed body over.
Both of them had respected each other enough to not have sex while dating and had decided together they wanted to wait till they were married.
Harry sighed "fine, how about hamburger meat?"
Draco slowly removes the clamps to lick at the sensitive flesh under them. Still pouring hot gravy over them as he goes.
The two part ways heading out for dinner..as while they had been talking the game had dissolved leaving them the only students left.
Celina had grown into a beautiful dark brown haired, green eyed dare devil of a woman. She was always doing crazy stunts, nothing about Celina was lady like no matter how much Hermione would try to teach her.
Harry sighed..
Bored a Slytherin stood up
Harry was shocked as he heard his every thought and feeling echoing out of Draco's mouth.
He heard a clear thump, of a body falling to the ground.
He smirked at Draco, then picks his wand from his pocket, he flicked his wand silently once before laying it down.
Harry closed his eyes and told Draco the whole story of living with The muggles from Albus leaving him on the doorstep, and then dove into the parts of Harry's life at Hogwarts that Draco never saw, and shared word for word about the graveyard, Cedric, the visions, the deaths of the people close to him..and finally he ends the story watching Draco in silence.
Hand in hand they disappear and go home.
"Don't worry, if it doesn't take this time I will fill you with my seed several times before the year is up."
Hermione gets close to that peak and says "now, cum for me. Fill me with your seed."
"It's pumpkin juice but I steamed a bit of Vargati leaf into it..Vargati is a natural magical plant used to help people in shock, slowly return to normal brain function."  Neville responded.
For now On Harry Potter was no more, Harry Potter would be dead to the world. For now on he would be Kane.
It was his godfather Severus Snape, the man he had sent an owl to just moments ago.
We have organized a special celebration party, outside by the lake, where will enjoy ice cream, and butterbeer  and a wonderful performance kindly performed by the Minister Of Wizard Safety Prius Langly. So in honor of this special night, we are giving all students the day off from all their classes, to enjoy the day."
Harry pulls Draco into the pet store, and together they play with all the baby animals. But Harry noticed Draco playing exclusively with the puppy in the display area.
Ice cold fear laced his heart, no how did he get back in here? His uncle suddenly was hitting him, as Harry whimpered out.
He'd never felt happier then when their names had somehow been paired up.
That night Draco watched as Ollivander showed him exactly how to create a wand that was as unique as the person that would be wielding it.
Draco laughed "I was preparing a new years celebration of my own for us."
Inside the room of requirements they find, a couch, and a coffee table laden with drinks.
Concerned Draco climbed out of bed and hurried to the bathroom.
"Ok I'm in..lets go to this place you heard about." Harry agrees.
Turning he washes the mixing bowl pours in flour with water and puts those on cookie sheets and shoves that on the other oven rack with the other pan.
But dared not mention it not wanting Draco to think he was a baby.
Looking him in the eye she starts touching herself, running hands over her boobs in front of him.
All to soon he felt a hand wrap arouund his shaft , stroking it in time with Dracos hips, until he felt himself erupt. Draco still thrusting empties his own cum into Harry then withdraws.
He swallows as he watched the death eater wander over towards the wall where dozens of ugly looking tools hung menacingly.
The three fell into a routine of getting up before everyone else and meeting in Myrtles Bathroom to try another round of attempts.
A large owl with a letter flies in with a letter for Harry. Harry picks it up, opening the letter he reads.
“He’s so cute.” Harry had sniffed.
Natalia
Eying Draco with pure confidence he slides Draco into his eager waiting mouth.
He watched Draco’s face go from disbelief to a look of pure joy.
By now someone had to notice he was gone. Were they looking for him? Would anyone find him? He thought about Draco and wondered if Draco really cared. Was he trying to find him?
Harry wrote the names down. “Good now we just need three more of each.”
"No, no boy you can't pass out now, I'm still having fun, I want you to feel every bit of this." Lucius snapped at him.
Draco felt the color drain, only to be replaced by red hot fury.
"I want you lay spread eagle over there but on your stomach."
"what's going on Ronald?" She asked sleepily.
Harry watched as everyone else played eyes going slyly to Draco mind deep in thought.
She slowly read..
Harry glanced at Dudley at the name of the oldest child.
"Dear Draco,
Dudley points to each of the three boys
"Alright then I'll send in an owl to order the tickets." He agreed.
"Well Mr. Potter! I see you're awake now we can have a little fun." The man drawls.
"Finger me." She ordered him.
They pass by a pet store on the way home, but Draco stops and grins at the display window.
Harry nods and tells the thestral where to go.
Draco looks at Harry in shock before passing out at the news.
But deep in his chest he begins to wonder if his only real escape would be through an even more painful death.
"Are you sure you wanna do this ? I dont know what your going through my boy but I'll leave you here to enoy your room in privacy. Feel free to come up for our evening feast when ur ready. Or order something from that book on ur bedside table."
“So which of these are which?” Draco asked softly.
That everytime he put Harry down he wanted to kick himself and kiss him instead. But the pressure of trying to impress his father, his mother, trying to keep Voldemort from killing his family.
Draco chuckled "you really are a naughty boy."
Harry put Ribs, Ground beef, and some sausage and bacon into the cart.
Sorry for this chapter being short I'll try to make the next chapter a bit longer
Dobby looked puzzled but does as asked handcuffing Harrys other wrist.
Ron grinned “Thank goodness she’s only having one baby. So how far along are you?”
Draco got up the next morning and headed back to Ollivanders to work.
Several years passed since the marriage law had been passed, all the babies that had been born from that law have received their first Hogwarts letters. Harry, Draco, Ron, Luna, Hermione and Neville were taking their kids through Diagon Alley to get them prepared for their first year at Hogwarts.
"Spin The Wand? What is that Dyvon? How about explaining the game?"
Harry shrugged, Just a meatloaf and a pan of bread rolls.
“Well, I can think of one thing?” Draco teases purring as he kissed Harry.
He answers the door and follows Porter out to the boat.
"I'd much rather enjoy a different meal..but this looks nice." Draco responds.
The witch smiles brightly at Harry, and leads him into the non emergency ward, where they set Harry up in a bed and ran a bunch of tests.
Draco gives Harry a few more thrusts with his fingers, until felt moans of the sudden pleasure escape his lips.
With a hand he brings the Great Hall to a quiet.
The carriage ride was painfully silent as fears continued to increase inside his chest.
Draco nods "that's fine, anything but Fish, chicken or liver."
Walking over to Harry he whispers "I have a confession."
Harry clears his throat.
Ron listened to her moaning softly under his touch, he started licking and suckling at her breasts teasing them with his tongue. Loving the sound of the tiny little shrieks she made.
Harry whines with need.
"Malfoy, what ya doing here at this hour? We were dead asleep." He mumbled.
But with how shocked she had been earlier he didn't want to rush her. He wanted to wait for her to make the first move. But it would sure feel like hell while he waited. But deep in his heart he loved her enough to wait. No matter how uncomfortable it was.
I hear you're looking for a ship headed out of the area? I have a ship that's headed to America if thats where your headed."
He licked his lips as she slowly fingered herself. Then steps closer to him.
Hermione and Neville were trying everything to get pregnant, as it was in the contract that they had to have at least one. But the two of them were met with many failures, many negative tests. Hermione was in constant tears as she worried that something might be wrong with her. She couldn’t figure out why she was having so much trouble having a child. Hearing Ron and Harry talk endlessly about their children, Hermione never once mentioned her own trouble with it, but would smile and be as supportive with them as possible, she’d hold Ron’s son, kiss Harry’s quads, but inwardly she was always aching for her very own to hold.
When we regained consciousness, Severus here had appeared, and he...he killed Lucius..ripped him apart..there was so much blood..everywhere, when Snape was done it looked like a battlefield.
“Congrats Luna.” He smiles at Luna.
He starts to pull out his map to see where he might be when Ron approached him.
Draco darts a tongue into Harry's ass. Kissing and licking at Harry's opening.
Harry says “I really want to call one after my Godfather, Sirius if there’s a boy.”
"Did you like your Christmas present?" Draco asked.
Tom grinned.
He slowly kisses her, letting his hands travel over her body.
At the Faculty table sat All the Hogwarts Teachers, Along with The Minister Of Magic who sat at a solo table where a goblet of fire sat next to a Cauldron in the center.
The two of them answer the door as his knocks landed on the door.
Both silently dress.
The area was dark, the stars and candles the only source of light.
Draco did a mirror spell so Hermione could see herself.
But this is me taking a leap of faith to let you know how i really feel about you and what I want..
Draco nods kisses Harry on the lips then turns Harry on his side best he could..then smacks Harry over the Buttocks with the flogger.
Dudley grinned at Harry’s reaction.
The sounds of the girl were loud and when they came out they took seats pretending like nothing ever happened.
Harry bites back any response trying his best not to display any emotion no matter how bad it burned.
One time Hermione had taken her to the park, and had been talking with Luna who had accompanied her, only to turn around and find her six year old daughter jumping off the swing and landing on her feet laughing.
Together they popped their way outside a deatheaters house.
Harry felt himself harden again. Then answers.
Harry wondered where he went just as he heard the sound of a whistle, and a sharp terrible pain as the whip dug into his back.
Harry and Petunia's relationship was rocky and full of walls that needed to be broken through. But Harry was trying his best to work through it with her and allow her into his heart and life. Dumbledore had broken the muggle exposure rule to allow Both The Grangers and Petunia  to attend the graduation ceremony.
He opens his robe and lets it fall to the floor standing there in nothing but his own skin.
"Now we can spy on the professors and see if we can find out what's going on."  Draco continues.
Draco stands his legs shaking under him, as they struggled to hold Draco's battered body. He leans against the wall to point at his wand at his father "Sectumsempra"
The blonde considered doing to Harry, what he was doing to him, but decided not to.
He flew the broom to just outside the Coast. Where all the boats were docked.
Hermione groans softly,
Harry lay in his bed thinking over the events of the day, the graduation, the knowledge that September 1st would no longer be an important date for him, and the marriage.
Harry and Draco fearing they'd come in and catch them they sped up even more.
Harry sets the puppies on the floor and sets up food bowls and water before, starting him and Draco breakfast.
Ron blushed "I'll be Porky."
Draco was always thinking about what would have happened if he hadn’t of gotten to Harry in time, when Lucius had kidnapped Harry. What would have happened if Draco’s father had killed him?
After looking for a long time and getting turned away, Draco ended up in diagon alley where ollivander’s shop was sitting.
He wondered how hard it would be to talk Draco into having sex again without the game, without the need to rush.
"I need you two to listen, and i want you to keep it to yourselves, tell nobody i beg you. Draco and I have decided to run away and leave England behind for a new country faelrvaway outside the reach of Voldemort. The safety of my child calls for this measure."
She starts moaning softly for him.
She cracked the whip against his back.
Draco puts aside his drink, before taking Harry's cup and setting it aside to.
Harry thinks and responds "well let's go see what the kitchen even has in it."
Harry lay there quietly setting his teeth as the whip continued to hit him over and over again, blood falling more rapidly as the whip tore holes into his back.
Neville was perfectly content to let her control him.
This really was best Christmas ever.
After wards they both lay in bed together Harry laying against Draco's chest.
He hated seeing Harry stressed and sad in anyway. He had never told a soul that he loved the potter boy.
Still licking the gravy trails he finally finds the end of the trail.
"Why are you looking at me like that?" Luna asked, amused.
"Sure." Harry sighed and followed Ron up to the gryffindor common room.
On the day that little Celina was finally placed into Hermione’s arms, she and Neville both were teary eyed and ready to hold their tiny daughter.
"Because others would judge." Harry answered.
"what are you planning to do for a career?"
Harry took Draco’s hand and settled over a certain spot.
Together they fall asleep. His arms draped over her.
Draco pulls the ball and gag from Harry's mouth, wanting to hear his sounds better.
But try as he might she would still end up in the room checking on her twenty minutes later, checking for a breath.
Together the exit the closet and rejoin their friends.
"What about you?"
Now he stood in the room wand pointed at his father's back.
Can we at least agree to try and put our childhood past behind us? I don't wanna be that boy anymore. How about for now we try our best to make this marriage work by starting out as friends, doing little dates and trying to get comfortable with each other. We'll let whatever happens happen when we are both ready for it to. I'm not going to bully you, I'm jot going to hurt you..we are married we can't change that but we can control how we approach this?"
Sucking up embarrassment Harry used a hand to pull a Cover over his most revealing parts then says.
Harry slowly felt himself growing aware of the whispered conversations going on around him.
Harry thought
"Instead of code words cause of the gag, just hit the bell with your chin if this gets to be to much for you." Draco instructed Harry.
"You're right it seems I was a bit hasty."
"What is it Professor?" Harry asked.
Now at Eleven Celina and Tanner were pretty close as friends, and were always trying to hang out with each other or sending them owls.
He was sure that she was going to give him a son, and would constantly talk about his son, even calling him by a name.
Harry was scared. He was scared.
"I'LL continue to use Potter as a pawn as i see fit. He will be my soldier against Voldemort. He will do it because he believes he has no choice. And that i actually care about him. Harry's only purpose is to serve as a lsmb to sacrifice to save us all from You know who..even if i have to help break his spirits."
"Its not like I like picking on The potter boy and his friends, its just it's so frustrating, being in love with the blind idiot and not being able to say anything about it. Every time i push him i want to hug him, every time i insult him i want to kiss him and tell him I'm in love with him. But I'm a slytherin and he a gryffindor he'd never even look at me or will would just think it's a trick or something to pick on him with. Oh Myrtle what should I do?"
Upon arriving Ron and Luna had excitedly taken their showers. Now Ron stood in the bedroom nervously, as the two of them removed their school robes.
Lucius pulls out his own wand and points it back.
Harry waited anxiously, wondering what the wizard planned to do to him now. But time ticked and he doesn't return.
The boys come together in one breath. With what strength he had Harry used magic to redress them both. And laid down beside Draco grinning stupidly as he holds him sleepily.
The two boys shake on it before Draco asks "now what should we make for dinner tonight?"
Harry smirked "well whose the lucky girl?"
"Draco!" He cries out. Hands gripping Draco's hair , he tries to meet Draco's thrusts.
"Me? I'm A Malfoy they won't do much to me."
Time passes as Draco and Harry adjust to Draco’s new apprenticeship, leaving Harry to juggle four babies by himself. Some days Harry handled it with ease and even had dinner on the stove by the time Draco would come home, but some times taking care of four would cause Harry to have a full blown meltdown, on these days Molly would come over and give Harry a hand.
“I hope so, I was actually hoping Harry that we could raise our kids as like well cousins, even though we aren’t really related. I’d really like it Harry if we could be like uncle’s to each other’s kids.” Ron explained blushing a bit at the request.
He had perfect Boyfriend. He was carrying Draco's baby and now he had his best friends back.
Draco wanted very much to cheer him up. To make him smile again. To show Harry that together they would get through this storm.
“I’ll resign from the apprenticeship and help you here at home.” Draco says softly.
When a Witch or Wizard reaches seventeen, By Law on their graduation day, All Wizards and Witches Must then become Married. Once Married you are required to produce at least 1 child, your marriage will be arranged by this goblet of fire. Each student will write their names on a slip of paper and submit them into the goblet. The Goblet will spit out a paper with both names matched together. This goblet had the ability to tell if a witch or wizard is gay or straight and will match you with someone that matches your sexuality. Once your name is called you will be expected to sign a marriage certificate, to legalize your marriage no vowels needed. I wish you all luck, please submit your names into the goblet now, we will start matching you when the names of all students have been submitted. Anyone who refuses to follow this law will be thrown to azkaban."
Shaking his head, no this was not the end. He will find Harry again. Somehow someway he'd find him. If nobody else would look for him then he would look for Harry on his own.
"Rokubra" draco mumbles.
Harry then wakes Draco.
"I'll add a pot of Green beans to the stove when that's about ready." Harry says quietly.
“congrats, by the way.” Ron calls out as Harry leaves.
"Fuck you, Atticus...touching my husband." He growled.
"We will find you Harry one way or another." Draco mumbled.
Grabbing the bucket Harry heads to find the water. Upon finding it Harry bends to fill the bucket when something hard smacks him in the back of the head from behind.
“Harry is out of labor now, and everyone is doing just fine. Your babies are healthy and beautiful. Harry is asking for you now, you three can come back now as well if you like.” The nurse says, saying the last part to Snape and his family.
But as for question wasnt he just trying to figure out to bed Draco again?
Harry looked at the clock on the wall 5:58.
Harry grinned.
Morning came fast for Harry, he stretches amazed at how comfortable he felt laying in Draco's arm. Until he noticed that Draco's hand had traveled to rest on his butt.
The two sit down at the table and play a couple rounds. She noticed Neville getting tired and felt nerves in her stomach.
A burst of purple light sped towards Lucius. Who with his wand flicked it aside.
After hours of searching  he finally ends up drinking coffee at the Leaky Cauldron.
"Wingardium Liviosa" Hermione yells from the doorway, the four of them had been trying to catch up but had been far enough behind they had gotten lost. But now they stood ready to help Draco.
Saying "we have to keep looking Ron, there must be a tracking spell in here that'll work to find him somewhere. We can't just not keep trying."
Hermione tried her best to get her to just sit down and read a book, but all Celina wanted to do was play and find things to do that would make Hermione have near heart attacks.
In one corner there was beaitiful real pine Christmas trees, with oodles and ooddles of ornaments and other Christmas gadgets, and gizmos.
Crabbe and Goyle ended up being the first gay couple to be paired together. Once the papers were signed and rings exchanged. For the first time Slughorn picks up a glass and fills it with what's in the cauldron and hands it to Crabbe. Upon drinking it only then were they led outside like the others.
“I have no idea but at least now we no longer have to worry about the Marriage Law requirements, we’ve knocked all three out at once. We don’t have to worry about having more anytime soon.” Harry points out.
“I wonder if they’ll be as good a friends as we are.” Harry wondered aloud.
She was leaning against a beam wearing only a black lace teddy, garters and a matching black bra.
Draco nods " good I've been planning to pitch this ever since you mentioned the baby. Together we can form our own family."
Was Draco being honest with him? Was he really wanting to change? Was he really interested in trying to make things work with him? Could they? Harry fell asleep momentarily wondering what his new husband would be like in bed.
Draco grins and continues to flog Harry giving attention to both cheeks. Stopping now and then to kiss the welts that were forming.
Sitting down beside her he turns to Harry.
Neville starts rubbing her clit.
"Bloody hell your beautiful." He mumbled softly as he kissed over her neck, slipping a finger in between her folds.
Harry nods “Yeah, should’ve seen Draco when he heard the news.”
"But Ron, he's my friend too, and us, DA should stick together." Luna responded.
Harry grins
"Madam may i ask Harry one more question before I leave?  it's a bit important to me..and i need an answer before my date tonight." Severus asked.
Draco comes into view a look of utter hope and excitement on his face.
Noting his bad temper, Harry made mental notes in his mind. Draco was not a morning person.
Harry turns to the bed.
Then kisses Harry softly before putting a ball and gag into Harry's mouth.
“These are Dillon, Dustin, and Harrison.”
"Its still so rare that not even Saint mongos has an answer for this,." Harry shrugged.
"Well you aren't that bad for a Slytherin either " harry countered as they get dressed.
After a while the two continue to exchange spells and un-doing them non verbally.
At that moment as Lucius stood over Draco about to kill him, a spell came from the doorway.
“According to the mediwitch I’m two months along.” Harry replied.
It was drizzling as Harry juggled eating his breakfast while attending to two fussy wiggly blonde blue eyed babies.
They had sent Severus an owl awhile ago to tell him the news, and now that Severus was Harry’s uncle he had been placed on Harry’s emergency contact information. So while Draco had been pacing the mediwitch had paged Snape to let him know Harry was there.
This man didn't claim to not know but looked pale white before mumbling.
Harry buried his face in Draco's shoulder as the speed picked up more. Biting down, piercing soft flesh.
“Harry what are you doing?” Draco inquired.
"Harry. We need to talk about us, and the baby and the things going on with you know who."
Harry and Draco try to figure out what they could do with the small pickings. Harry, who was  well versed in the arts of muggle food, shoved Draco out of the way, pulled out a mixing bowl, poured meat, bread crumbs and tomato sauce into the pan with sliced up onions. He shoves his freshly washed hands into the sloppy mess  and mixes it all up together before greasing a baking pan, pouring the meatly mess into it and sliding it into the preheated oven.
"he was here a moment ago, but i saw him heading out of the hall with a really odd look on his face."  Hermione offered.
"Go get her before that nurse over there decides to eat you."  He adds joking watching the nurse glaring at them.
When he finally pulls out, he carries her to their room so they can lay together.
"Tell me you want it Harry."
Revealing to Harry he had no plans to share a bed just yet.
He squeezed his eyes shut. Trying to shut out the ache of what now may never be. He had over heard at breaksfast this morning That Harry Potter had disappeared from Hogwarts had run away and had left no clue as to why or where he was going.
He watched Harry's back jerk at the sting, then hears a gasp of pleasure leave Harry's throat a sure sign Harry was fine.
"I Hermione Granger, and I Neville Longbottom give our hand in marriage through sickness, health and until death shall part us. We also hereby understand that as required by law to consummate this marriage within six months of being married, and to try to produce at least one child within a year of being married or produce a medical document stating that we are medically unable to have a child."
Draco wanders forward awkwardly then asked..
“And Marry Christmas to you to Baby Malfoy #5”
