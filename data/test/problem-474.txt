“Now Harry I want to introduce you to‘esprit de la nature’. It’s like meditation for magical beings, it helps you calm down your magic in moments of intense emotion. With immense practice it can help you strengthen your magic and spells in time. After all our magic comes from nature and the universe; they are all one and continues for eternity. Each plant, animal, rock, and other beings have a spirit or a consciousness so these spirits can join together, in a hive-mind, as a spirit of an area. Now you should know that nature spirits include real biological intelligences, and are psychically powerful, and are much less abstract and controllable than the Elementals that many magical beings who perform all of their rituals indoors are familiar with.” Adele was now very excited if the twinkle in her bright green eyes were anything to go by. She continued “they can be extremely powerful allies. With much practice it’s even possible to sense nature spirits, to determine if they are receptive to a ritual planned, and to have them actively participate in magical workings. Now sometimes spectacular physical manifestations can happen when working with nature spirits in the wild.” A sneeze from harry interrupted her speech. And after a concerned look from adele and a head shake from harry she continued on.
"Very well, what is it--and do hurry." Voldemort said, already bored.
"So you're planning on-
"There is another reason that without Harry's love I would not be here..." He choked for a moment, trying to hold in his tears. His fingers clenched tight onto the podium and Draco hunched his shoulders as the wave of pain came back. He took a few seconds to compose himself and manually wiped his tears, stoically. He coughed and massaged his throat before deciding he was ready to continue.
"I don't know Harry, what can we do?"
"Spare me the details," Neville told him, a new found sense of worth from the war clearly noticeable in his speech.
"I object. Why can't my wife give the testimony?"
"So, Draco, are we gonna do this or not? Because I really don't want to do it and find out we took too long and did it for nothing."
Two hours later and Draco was still pacing the floor in front of the side of his bed, ranting about Dumbledore and the lot. "I didn't sign up for this! Oh, no, if I knew just what he was up to, I would have gone to the uncivilized America and live off of hamburgers." He paused to shudder. "Even Voldemort wouldn't have tortured me like this, and yet, the Head of the 'Light' is telling me what to do even after the war. Potter is his stupid, bloody pawn, not me!"
Being ever so blunt as always, Ron blurted, "So, what's wrong with you, Harry?" before he even sat down.
Seamus leaned up against the wall. "I probably should have told him that Harry's pregnant. Ah, well, Blaise can tell him. Which means I have to go and find him." He walked off with a smile not noticing the beetle there.
"Yeah, well, that's obviously not true," he muttered again. He was fond of those. I guess he just didn't like admitting nice things and he must've done a lot of them. You know, 'cause of him being on the Nice List and all and obviously he had to do things to get on there.
Of course, with his natural talent and experience at dives, Potter was winning. However, Draco did give him a run for his money. He actually led by 3 at one point. "Give up yet?" He asked as he did four consecutive flips backwards.
Seventh year at Hogwarts started out well: having You-Know-Who sent to You-Know-Where. The Malfoys formally revealed their alliance to the Light and nobody was out to kill them in revenge as all the other actual Death Eaters were dead as a door nail. In fact, Harry and Draco declared a truce and became fast friends. Like, very fast. The two became so close that they even took turns sleeping in the other's House and swapped clothing. Somehow, Hermione and Ron weren't at all bothered by this; although, it was hard to believe that a single thought even had time to go through Hermione's head about anything, the couple was snogging so much.
So, really, he
"So...is it really true?" Draco asked, grabbing one of Harry's hands.
"Oh, come here you. You're gonna pay for that!"
You get the picture, right? Right. Good. So, um, there it was, being just like any other day at Hogwarts during the holidays again. Although, not many people left to visit home. I suspect Dumbledore had something to do with it. Even when he's dead and gone he's still meddling in people's lives, you know? He's just that kind of person. And, like always, what he had up his sleeve I didn't really care for or respect until long after it passed. You see, come December, he decided to introduce a little incentive to...being good. He decided to make a list and check it twice, heh, like the muggle's Santa Claus.
"I believe that Harry is all that and more- just not the center of the universe because I am, so he's only like a major planet or sun..." Some people laughed at his obvious vanity and he chuckled shortly too. "because he is; and I know this because I'm one of the very few people that he he shows his real self to- he might probably kill me for outing him like that if he were still alive- but, if you give me a dictionary I'll bet that every single one of those adjectives can apply to Harry at least once in his lifetime of change and maturation.
many signs. If only I had listened...wait a minute, this isn't my fault. It's yours!" He spun around to point directly at Potter.
" I must have screamed since he had to cover my mouth with his hand and hissed at me. "Do that again!"
Potter:  It started with Dumbledore, like most things often did. At least, from my perspective, he seemed to have a hand in everything one could think of in some way. Hogwarts, for one, the entire war-
List?" I couldn't help it, the chuckles just flew out of my mouth. But the poor guy just stood there, a slightly amused scowl on his face and hands on his hips, tapping his feet away until I stopped and wiped my tears away.
"I know! What if we go back and pretend to hate each other's guts just slightly less, and then form an alliance or whatever so we can quickly become what we are now?" Draco's hand stopped, hovering right above his head.
I took off my robe and cast a warming charm on our immediate area, just to be safe. "So, um, are we going to do this, then?" I watched him as he moved towards me. So graceful, cat-like in his movement. I could see the way his muscles rippled under his skin. We were rather an interesting pair for a relationship. Me, dark and clumsy. Him, pale and refined. My breath quickened at that thought. Consciously thinking of Malfoy and sex was new to me, then.
He licked his lips and leaned in closer while furiously whispering at an even quieter volume. Like that helped, the prat. "You know, the-nicelist,"
"So, um, what time is it?" I got around to asking.
"What are you doing, Malfoy, and you better not say 'fixing cabinets'?" I answered finally, my wand out and ready just in case. I didn't think I needed it, more so by the embarrassed look on his face when I confronted him than by anything else.
"Nothing. Just,
After a moment, he slid off the bed. "Fair enough." Draco's jaw dropped. 'Potter's actually taking this?' Harry walked around Draco and stood behind him so Draco had to move to watch him. "I suppose I can find something to blame you for unfairly, too. Oh, now let's see..." He muttered, staring at his nails again. "Hmm, what to blame Malfoy for, what could I possibly blame him on...oh, I know!"
that something head on. God, I almost came right then.
"The Sorting Hat was half right when it wanted to put Harry in either Slytherin or Gryffindor..." Many gasped at that fact and he grinned evily as he continued on. "- yes, he told me, did you expect him to keep that kind of thing a secret from me?!- Harry held too many traits of each House in him to be in just one or two or even three; Harry was built for all four." They accepted this fact more readily than the previous one.
"Harry is not gay and neither am I! I should know seeing as I'm his lover!" Draco practically shouted gaining the entire Hall's attention. Blaise and Pansy shared a look as he cursed under his breath.  They didn't exactly go over how they were planning on coming out as a couple, but it definitely wasn't like this.
"Merlin, Harry, what high expectations you have of me!" he said something under his breath and I gasped at the feeling of something
"This will be the last time I make myself clear. I AM NOT GAY. Do you read me?" Draco snarled. Seamus quickly nodded his head and Draco stormed off again. He had to sprint to catch up.
My cheeks felt hotter. "Hey, you just admitted to being one too, so...you know," I grumbled even though he was already at a point where he didn't care about the hypocritically-one-sided insult.
"Here you are." He handed them over with an equally cheerful voice. Draco just glared at him as he downed them in a single swig.
"Never!" Voldemort growled as he sent red sparks up into the air. Suddenly the atmosphere chilled and the air froze up. Harry laughed, sending out ghostly puffs.
"It's Harry, Pans. Draco's all friends with him now and he's obviously taking him being a recluse badly." Blaise spoke for Draco. "Stop playing with your soup, Draco. I'm sure Harry will be down tomorrow."
"It's alright if you are, no one would condemn you. You have rid us of a massive evil and all." Seamus winked. "And the wizarding world doesn't label it morally wrong like the muggles do," he added, sincerely after Dean elbowed him.
"Right, okay," I nodded, trying to sound encouraging. He paused for a second.
He kissed me again, a lot less hesitantly and I responded, arching under his contact. He moaned into my mouth and I shivered. I felt a forbidden thrill excite my frame. What were doing was
"Meow." Harry replied, doing his best impression of a cat's purr. Then he leaned over and licked Draco's face.
"What if I wanted to?"
"Because that's what you are," I insisted, smashing our mouths together for an instant. "Now, you've promised me a good fuck, so you better deliver," I growl, foreheads connected.
It was foolish of him. Remarkably Gryffindorish, in fact. But he couldn't help himself. It had been
"I quite like the latter one." Draco said, easing himself into a dignified but relaxing position.
"So how long have you been together?" He pried out in the hallway.
By the time Draco had blown off his steam and went inside his Common room, Blaise was there with the important piece of information. "So, Mr. I'm-not-gay-but-I'm-Potter's-Lover, explain yourself." He asked smugly. Draco flopped down onto a chair and ignored Blaise's hickeys.
"So, you saying that you might want to do this again-" he pretended to drawl lazily.
"Santy who?" he asks, completely confused. I ignore him.
"I don't know, what do you want to do?"
and there was no denying that Draco was a
"Ewww, nasty, what was that for?" Draco asked as he wiped his face off.
"I'm not suicidal like you, Harry!" Draco said running away, squeaking when Harry started to catch up to him after than comment.
Draco chuckled. "Such dirty language from our Golden Boy," he teased.
Suddenly two hands wrapped around him at his stomach and pulled tight against their owner's body. He let out a 'omph' of surprise and tried to see who his attacker was, when his attacker's mouth touched his ears and sung to him.
"Even if you didn't include the sentence above as one- which I am- you can't describe all of his traits in just those few amount of sentences: he's brave, he's strong, he's weak, he's shy, he's abused, he's modest and humble, he's adorable, he's small, he's skinny, he's daft, he's joyful and optimistic, he's hardened, he's terrified, he's lonely, he's suffocating at all the people near, he's a parslemouth, he's young, he's old, he's this and he's that, he's everything; he's Slytherin; Gryffindor; Hufflepuff; and Ravenclaw; but only at certain times." He cracked a smile at his own joke, some of the Gryffindors looked upset that their Harry was associated with Slytherin again.
"No, no, just let me finish my goodbyes; the realization just hit me, is all. I'll leave right afterwards, I promise." Ronald only nodded and patted him on the shoulder. Draco knew that him making such a scene was unacceptable; empaths in the room might suffocate and it made everyone more melancholy.
The next morning at the Great Hall...
exist. But one day, I accidentally fell into this alcove and I found it.
on my
About a week into the school year, Draco accepted Harry's 'truce' and Hermione hooked up with Ron finally. The boys gave the school one month of being civil and friendly, before they went and did all the things that were normal to them. The Gryffindors and Slytherins quickly followed the leads of their most popular respective members and gave up overtly trying to be enemies; instead they also were mostly civil, because they either got one of the two threatening and screaming at them no matter the House, or both would descend upon them and hex them until they were scarred into compliance. And slumber parties at random Houses also became regular occurrence thanks to the dynamic duo. But Harry had to go and ruin all that they had finally accomplished as normal.
Draco somehow managed not to laugh during his read, but he exchanged glances with Harry wondering if he told her any of this stuff. And he gave Harry a quick smile when he read about the engagement plans of his. He figured that Harry couldn't get past the title, so, might as well. Smirking, he reached for his goblet and spoke to him nonchalantly, into it. "Funny, I was sure that the dark-haired man with blazing emerald eyes and lightning-bolt scar that I slept with was only some psychopath from a society that adores you." Clearly, as everyone was listening and watching them, he only had to raise his voice a little for the whole Hall to hear. Now he just hoped Harry got his point.
"WHAT!?" Gone went the calm, thanks to Dumbledore-peace-killer, among other titles.
The crowd was giving only a quiet murmur; no doubt wondering who was going to be delivering the ceremonial testimony appropriate to all wizard or witch deaths. As per tradition, it was supposed to be given by a close confident or family member, be it kin or in-law. They were expecting Hermione, with her still ever-sharp mind and clever words, or maybe even Ron, the quintessential best friend, to preform such a ceremony. "They" being the majority of the gathering: his fellow Gryffindors. Here and there had some Slytherins, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws, though, of course, and even more scattered were people that went to a different school other than Hogwarts and people that Harry deemed worthy of having a presence at his real funeral.  Because, really, after everything, this was Harry Potter.  The Boy Who Lived, The Man Who Defeated Voldemort...silly things like House rivalries mean nothing to him.  Or rather,
list. I was still a virgin and I was making preparations to finally officially propose to my on-again, off-again girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, after having died to save the world and all that. So yeah, pretty much obvious there. And I wasn't the only no-brainer, the entire school pretty much was one too. Zabini was a shocker, I'll admit, and so was Cho Chang. But this is not exactly where the story begins; it begins the night before everyone found out about the lists. Well, not
He immediately blushed and worried his bottom lip. "Um, maybe it's not that big of a deal, I mean..." He never finished explaining what 'he means'.
I gave him a measuring look. "This isn't something that will hurt anyone in any way, is it?"
." He gritted out and Harry smiled, now happily getting the bottles he so politely requested.
"So, what do you want to do?"
I guess, maybe, I'll confess to actually being excited
So, it all really started when I saw that small fleeting smile appear when I had accepted his hand the second time around. There was so much relief there, contained in such a weary little thing that I guess I kinda took pity on him. Not that he would ever want me to admit that, or any of this for that matter, but it's like that puppy look. You just can't refuse. Even though he wouldn't actually ask for anything until much later.
"No," Malfoy whispered back, grinning slightly with a little laugh from the natural buzz of possibly getting caught doing something bad. Clearly, he wasn't used to adventurous heroics. "But then again, I couldn't hear anything after the flash, so maybe."
He shuddered violently at that, brushing against something that filled me with pleasuring warmth. "Merlin's beard!" he exclaimed. "I definitely won't last if you keep saying things like that."
He gave a shy smile and brought my hand lower, hovering over his erect member. I swallowed, glancing back at him, unsure of his intentions here. "Can you deny what you do to me?" he asked quieter.
He looked down and kicked at the floor. "Um, I kinda have to get rid of the last scrap of my purity, so...that means...Isortofneedtolosemyvirginity."
"Good, Lord Malfoy." Harry grinned, seeing how Draco suppressed a shiver as he gave his former rival his actual title. "Now, then, I do sincerely offer my apologies towards my previous uncouth behavior and mannerisms to your and your posse. And I'm willing to forgive your un-niceties, as well."
"What? I-I don't understand-" I stumbled. His playful teasing was so sudden and his coy suggestions completely eluded me.
"Why you...!" Voldemort cursed his long-time enemy, and then turned to the Malfoys with his eyes gleaming darkly. "I will finish with you two later. Attack, you bumbling fools!" With that threat out of the way, the battle commenced. Harry and Voldemort were in the middle, of course, throwing spells at each other. Voldemort tried to take Potter down with a few Unforgivables, but Harry always had a powerful shield that dissipated the curses on contact. And then Harry retaliated with multiple spells that always broke through Voldemort's shield.
He cast the tempus charm. "11:34 p.m."
"I doubt any of you know- not even you, 'Mione..." Here, he allowed himself a smile at being able to withhold information from the notorious Granger. "that these are my wedding vows to Harry..." He raised his hand to show the sparkling diamond and engagement ring on his left hand. Their wedding was a secret one, even to close friends. "...slightly changed to fit this sad and somber occasion though, to prove to you how much and why I believe that Harry had all of these traits that he is now buried with."
"Was?" Draco raises an eyebrow, brushing back Harry's bangs while grabbing his chin. Harry giggled at that.
"Oh," I nodded. And then-
"You're such a git," I mumble through the laughter and tears. "I feel so stupid right now."
"Yeah," I grinned playfully. Er, maybe it was the sort of grin I wore when Ron made a joke or shared prank ideas. "Wait, what am I on?"
"Are you finished?" he asked with a whole lot of exaggerated exasperation.
He sighed. "I have two ideas, really. Like Plan A and Plan B,"
When I wake up, I'm completely clothed and he's gone. And so is the List. At first, I worry that it didn't work and he just took off with it but that's stupid. I mean, it had to work.
"Now, I'm not trying to get out another revenge against him or settle the score or even undermine his position to you all if that is what you are thinking, I'm trying to say that many of you thought you knew Harry and could deliver this but really only Hermione and I can; we know the real Harry, you only know the Harry that he decides you should know which is why we need to explain that to you so many times, you insufferable half-brains!" He leaned back some and watched the chaos he created with a grin. Once he deemed long enough, he cleared his throat and continued once their chattering stopped.
I paused for another minute. The suspenseful anxiety got to me. "Well, did it work? Was it worth it?"
time. He would make sure of it. After punishing Harry for his mistake the first time, he added mentally with glittering in his eyes reflecting the smirk he had to hide. Oh, the
"Do what? Fall in love with boys? The-Boy-Who-Lived-Lives-For-Boys...and you sickened me before." The Death Eaters roared with laughter. You could practically see the steam coming out of Harry's ears.
Oh, bloody hell! When will I ever learn to shut up?
He dropped my hand. "I fancy you," he whispered to the ground. "I have for awhile now. Since you saved me...from the fiendfyre,"
I didn't need to be some sort of mind reader--not that I am a good one or was reading his mind in that moment--I knew exactly what he was thinking because I was thinking it too. No time to play games. The countdown was ticking. This had to be dirty, rough and quick. Maybe next time we could-
"I know, that's why I say it." He thrust the paper in his face. "Now read."
"Not a chance, Potter." And so it began.
A few weeks go by and the boys started to actually get close with one another. There were no more incidents since the last time; in fact, they silently and mutually agreed not to talk about it or anything of that nature. By now, they slept in the same room--even bed at times--and wore each other's clothes. They could even finish each other's sentences...sometimes. But it wasn't that much of an accomplishment, seeing as the only other company was the occasional Severus Snape and Lucius Malfoy, house-elves, Madame Pomfrey, and in passing, Albus Dumbledore. However, they despised seeing their Headmaster's twinkling blue eyes because it reminded them of his 'manipulative doings' and...that day.
"So, what's the plan?" I asked, turning around to face him.
"Oh, right, right," I nodded vigourously. Then I grinned so suddenly I could see him get more confused by the minute. "Why not here? Right in front of the List?"
Sirens could be heard in the background, almost drowning in the sound of people shouting for loved ones and kids – as well as a few adults – crying.
; and
“But now I’m so buggered,” he said as he was trying to stand on his wobbly legs. “How long was I gone?” he asked Benoit as he caught him and brought him to his side still checking him over.
“I have a feeling about you, young one. Pick up these wands see if you feel a bond to any of them, there are a few in the back that I think will do…” he was now down the dark hallway in search of more wands for Harry to try out.
The Slytherin prefect, Avery which Harry very much liked, took them around and showed them the rest of the grounds while giving the first years a very Slytherin tailored pep talk.
“Vernon, it is not my fault that you and your family are tossers and lack rudimentary knowledge of correct grammar and words bigger than
Firstly, he managed to freak the Dursley’s out and see fear in their eyes; secondly, he found out that what he was doing was
, of all places, he could not have believed his luck! Without them, he would have been truly blindsided by everything that he would have been introduced to in a year. Apparently at eleven years old every magical… well, ‘human’ magical child was required to go to a magical institution and learn how to control their powers. Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, Durmstrang Institute, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry were the three top schools -- among others in the US, Japan, Russia, Africa, Brazil -- that sent invitations to its desired students and have them attend their school. And not surprising at all the Beaumont family all attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France.
“Oui oui….I’m… blimey…that was amazing…I was everywhere and nowhere and the colors and... and….” Harry was now sitting awkwardly on a rock with twigs sticking out of his hair, a silly smile slapped on his lips and his eyes twinkling.
“Harry?” There was some heavy breathing and French curse words being said by someone, something…… French? The Beaumonts? Magic…. Magic! It truly was magic. Whatever he was experiencing. Magic…
Later in the night as Laurent caught Harry sneaking glasses at the envelope now sitting on the Hall Dining table, he proceeded to tell him more about the crest of Hogwarts and the motto that appears on it:
“You'll sleep well; it's very soothing, listening to the lake water lapping against the windows at night.”  One of the older Slytherins had told him.
“I know Sabrina got
“I have so many questions for you.” She declared as soon as Harry sat down. Oh boy, maybe this was the wrong cart to sit in.
“Good, good. Now Mrs. Art will be picking me up in an hour; that should be enough time for you to empty Dudley’s room for me. Oh and I require your credit card to buy new furniture. I do not like your taste. It’s so… tacky. I’m sure Mrs. Art wouldn’t mind taking me shopping.” He let out a deep breath. Wow, it was so liberating to let that all out and he was getting excited about his new room and going shopping! He had never gone to a mall before, this was indeed going to be very exciting!
to know? Do you?” Petunia was whispering in his ears, trying to calm him down as she rubbed his arms. Who’s
“Now you ungrateful…” Vernon tried to cut him off, but Harry was having none of it. He pushed them all down on the sofa next to each other and locked them in with his magic.
Harry went through the first batch with no luck, he enjoyed the design and craftsmanship on a couple but did not feel this overwhelming connection he kept hearing about. After Mr. Olllivander laid out the second round of wands for Harry to test, almost halfway through a beautiful eleven-inch-long wand caught his eye. Harry took the wand in his hand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Adele and Laurent were clearly relieved and pleased, Sabrina and Benoit were back now and clapping for him. “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. this one, was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contains a single feather from the tail of Albus Dumbledore’s Phoenix.” Mr. Ollivander was surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. "Curious, very curious." He muttered to himself which piqued Harry's interest, so he asked Mr. Ollivander to explain.
“I’m fine, Mrs. Art,” he managed to say in a small voice, not wanting to draw more attention to himself.
“Well, you can show me the catalog or whatever they have of the school you’re going to! And your dad thinks that I’m going to get a letter from Hogwarts, so you can show me all the pictures and tell me about the academic aspect of it! I would love to learn more!” To be honest, Harry had no clue what to expect from Hogwarts. What would the classes be? The rooms? The other kids? And he remembers Benoit saying something about Quidditch. Apparently it’s a very big deal over there, like how soccer was here. That was the analogy that he had gotten from him.
The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning over the envelope over, with trembling hands, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. The moment he had both been eagerly expecting and avoiding had finally arrived. Not being able to wait any longer he tore the envelope open and revealed the folder paper from within its confines. Folding the paper open the letters could be seen written in a beautiful cursive:
He could already feel the magic bounded into the glitter, but not the glue. Good he’s instincts were right; the glitter was alive!
robes arriving?” Sabrina huffed impatiently. The owlery they use had been infected by a virus, so the owls were being treated and as a result, all deliveries had been halted for the past two days.
“Don’t forget we're meeting with Maman at Twilfitt and Tattings before sunset, she insisted to be there when Harry was trying on his robes!”
“Yes, I did introduce myself on the train.” Harry pointed out.
“We really need to do something about those two… I don’t know how they will survive without me and you mediating between them, and Brooke is even worse than them!” Sabrina said while looking at the boys that had now fallen behind.
Revenge was definitely the only thing on his mind.
“Well, now – Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?” Harry looked at both hands for a split second before answering “well, I’m right-handed”.
I know I've been gone for far too long, between being a thesis student and work I barely have time to sleep but this voice in the back of my head has been nagging me to finish this story. so I typed up this chapter after 2 years... just bear with beautiful people, I have very very delicious things planned ahead...
After inhaling almost half of his meal, Harry Let a compliment escape his mouth to Laurent “C’est délicieux! [It’s delicious!]” proud that the words now felt familiar on his lips, Laurent responded with an appreciative wink, wine glass securely attached to his lips. Harry never understood Laurent’s passion for wine, he just assumed its something he’ll maybe grow into at a later age.
“Oi! Boy! Is that you? Get your butt here right now! Petunia is hysteric!” Vernon was shouting from two meters away. Dudley was clinging to his arms with a tear stricken face.
First of all I want to Thank my AMAZING beta CalliopeGalaxy!
While trying to find Brooke’s room, Felix and Conner had again gotten into a fight and were punching each other the whole way.
“How the bloody hell did you do that?” Ron’s eyes were as big as saucers almost as if he had never seen magic before. “She asked me if I could clean the stains. I could.” Hermione now scooting away opening a space between herself and Ron for Harry to join them.
“Yes ma’am!” Everyone responded back in unison and proceeded to get out of the car.
But at times like these, as rare as they were a couple years ago, they were becoming more frequent, becoming his every day.
“Well that’s me, thanks I guess.” Harry was now scurrying away towards Vernon, a bit slower than usual as he tried to navigate the obstacles in front of him.
“The headmaster is Albus….um Comment s'appelle le directeur, papa??” she asked her father.
“Oui maman,” she kissed her mother’s cheek and picked up the bouquet of flowers Céleste had bought for Brooke, and got out of the car.
Upon entering through the huge oak front doors of the castle, the students found themselves in vast Entrance Hall, which was dominated by a marble staircase leading up to the first floor. The giant hourglasses which Harry was told marked the house points were located in the Entrance Hall. To the right was the Great Hall. The staff room, the caretaker’s office, and classrooms were also scattered on this floor, as well as a courtyard where students apparently go to between classes.
Benoit was already biting into his second biscuit and sipping on his tea when Mr. Twilfitt and Mr. Tattings seemingly appeared out of thin air, making Harry almost jump out of his seat. Almost.
“I’ll be going to college in a couple years and you don’t have to ever see me after that, clear?” There was no response, just terrified eyes staring at him. Dudley was still trying to find the trace of any residue of the fire around him. “I said, is that clear?” He repeated louder and three nods greeted him.
“Mr. Ollivander, we apologize for the last-minute visit, but this was the last item on our list to get Harry ready for his first year at Hogwarts.” Laurent explained politely.
Harry and Benoît were lying on their stomachs facing each other with a giant chess board in the middle, the board was probably bigger than his cupboard, no definitely bigger than his cupboard, with beautifully carved glass pieces twisting and turning in impatience. He like the wizard version of chess so much better than the boring still muggle ones. “Harry, mate, your Queen will stab you if you don’t move a piece” and Benoît was right, his o
Then, Harry took a deep breath. Just like he planned he was going to use his magic to ‘condition’ or maybe a more accurate word to use would be coerce the Dursleys into doing what he wanted, what he deserved.
The hat was battered and old; completely patched, frayed, and extremely dirty. Every time it spoke or sang, a tear along the brim opened like a mouth. Laurent had told Harry that the Hat spoke to the wearer inside of the hat with a small, quiet voice, using Legilimency to interpret their thoughts and respond to them. Another very exciting and peculiar thing at Hogwarts.
english is my second language so any help to polish my writing would be appreciated!
birthday party was a massive success, thanks to the Beaumonts. Adele and Benoit took care of the decorations, Laurent Baked and cooked everything that was consumed, and Celeste made sure all games and trials ran smoothly, after all, 11-year-olds are not known for their rational and even tempers.
“Don't forget tomorrow I want a B.L.T sandwich with extra avocado! So do remember to remind papa to grab some at the store when he leaves, oui?” after Harry gave her a nasty look, she directed an even sweeter smile at him. “I would hate to see you go to the store so early in the morning and buying me avocados!” she winked at him and took a big bite of her omelet and hummed happily. “tres bien! We should make more bets harry, I could get used to this…”
“That
And he was afraid to express himself.
We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later than 31 July.
? Plus, Beauxbatons looked beautiful, he knew enough French to get by… most importantly he would be with Sabrina. Harry would never admit this to anyone, even took him a while to admit it to himself but he has started to depend on her and her family emotionally. He hated it, but not really. It’s very complicated.
And that, to this date, was one of the best days of his life in the six years that he had been breathing on this earth. There were a couple of reasons for this:
“Harry James Potter! I have been waiting here for five minutes! Didn’t I tell you to hurry up! Its Dudley’s first year graduation! Ah my smart Dudders!” She gushed the last part and hurriedly got into the bathroom and shut the door loudly in his face. Typical for her to leave out Harry; he was graduating too! And he had gotten full marks in every lesson! But that somehow made the Dudleys despise him more, telling him how he was a freak and his high IQ was caused by a side effect of his freakishness.
“I would appreciate it if you don’t interrupt me again, understood?” he raised an eyebrow and surveyed their faces. They were afraid. Good. “You all degraded me, hurt me, abused me and over all hated my very existence! Why would you even take me in then? You could have given me up for adoption! Or shoved me off on another relative! And I took it all, mostly because I didn’t know I could defend myself; I didn’t know how special I was, but now… now I won’t let you continue on with your hatred towards me! Things are going to change. You will treat me with respect! And I will be moving to the bedroom upstairs, which requires new furnishing.” He may have gotten a bit emotional at the beginning but now he was in control again. Hmmm, what else does he need?
At Christmastime But say a prayer to pray for the other ones
“Charms are a type of magic spell concerned with enchanting an object to behave in a way that isn't normal for that object. For example, the Summoning Charm brings an object to the caster. Charms are also something of a catch-all for spells that aren't Transfiguration, like spells that change the inherent nature of an object. In some sense, if a spell isn't Transfiguration, it's probably a Charm.
“Really? Thirty? It seemed so much longer…” Harry said and tried to get away from Benoit. He hated when they made a fuss about him.
.” Again she looked at him, her eyebrows knitting together. “Are you sure you don’t need my help to read these? You know I would love to help you any way I can, sweetie.”
“don’t fight it, just relax and feel the magic integrated in the glitter” Harry shouted back at him, over his grunts of frustration.
July was almost ending which meant Harry's 11
“Well, Hogwarts students are required to own three sets of standard black robes as part of their uniform when they attend classes, eat meals… like any other Academy.  Then, of course, you will need a formal robe… or three” she threw a playful wink at Sabrina's direction, which she did not seem to appreciate. “All schools pretty much operate the same, se relaxer [chill].” Harry had been wound up a bit more than usual the past two weeks, counting the days until he has to leave for Hogwarts seemed to be making him more and more anxious and nothing seemed to help with
One by one students were called up on the stage and the hat after seconds or sometimes minutes loudly announced his decision. Everyone so far seems to be pleased with their sorting, so Harry was trying to be optimistic about what was about to transpire.
He would have never though that this was the way things would end. So much has changed and was going to change.
“Yh mate but I didn’t think you were THE Harry potter! I grew up listening to my mom’s stories about you and… well you know who…” Ron trailed off with a sad look in his eyes. Hermione looking confused asked the girl standing next to her to explain who Harry was. She did not grow up hearing stories about him and the murder of his parents. Whispers were breaking all over and everyone’s eyes seemed to be tracking his every move now. He did not like this at all.
After the tour concluded and all the excitement seemed to have taken a toll on the children, they were all led back to the dorms and told to pick a bed and start unpacking.
Also, if you would like to be my BETA please send me a PM!
It was a particularly cold day and Harry was sitting by the window and looking at the angry sky. In a way he thought he could understand its anger and frustration, that is if you can relate to the weather. Maybe the sky was lonely like he was so it was trying to make everyone else feel how it felt. Alone, angry and sad. That was why Harry loved this weather; if Harry wasn’t allowed to go outside and play and enjoy the sun then no one else should either. He was so mesmerized by the clouds that when a paper ball hit his head his whole body jerked forward and he fell from the windowsill.
"But I'm not gay, Seamus. When I said people I meant humans, wizards, homo-sapiens,
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but, Draco, we
"I missed you too." Harry laughed and Draco almost purred with joy at the familiar sounds. "Come away with me, baby." Harry said huskily.
The next morning, true to Blaise's prediction, Harry made a surprise entrance in the Great Hall. Draco watched incognito with narrowed eyes as Hermione stood up only to sit back down and at the guilty looking Seamus. He knew Harry barely said anything before Seamus jumped up and confessed something before running off. Harry only shrugged his shoulders at it. Just as he turned back to his food, Harry had an outburst of laughter, drawing his attention again. Harry stood up and started to walk over to him.
"If I tell you what I'm doing, will you swear not to tell anyone?"
"Many of you will say--former Gryffindors--that Harry's bravery shone out most of all, but this is not true; yes, Harry may have needed this in order to save us all from Lord Voldemort, but it is not his best trait as it makes him prone to rash decisions." He earned a lot of glares for this and gulped.
"Now, I wrote 15 sentences about the real Harry Potter using as many words as I can. You will understand later my reasonings for this. But as for now, deal with my humor and supreme wisdom." He paused to clear his throat one more time.
"I don't know..." He huffed, crossing his arms. "I mean, I do hope I could be a good Father one day. And I do want lots of kids; I don't care about the 'one Malfoy heir' rule, I want lots!" Draco seemed to get over zealous about it all which made Blaise laugh.
stretching and opening me up. "To think-" he grunted and I shivered as he entered me rather painlessly. "That I could last even
"Well, go away; I'm fine now." Draco growled, turning onto his side. He briefly caught the flash of something in Potter's eyes and crowed inwardly.
"Well, your favorite creature, then?"
"It's a boy and a girl, twins." Harry smiles, putting a comforting hand on top of Draco's and hoping he'd take it alright--since this is definitely something they didn't discuss in depth yet. "...And they'll be just as beautiful as their father was."
Cat eyes, intelligent and bright, blinked at me guessing another, less probable reason. "...I'm not going to-I would
"Oh, nice. Very smooth." Draco said, barely keeping his teeth from chattering. "Otherwise, I would have followed your proposal." Even so, Draco came closer to Harry. He could imagine the warmth that Harry's arms would bring, along with comfort, and it was very tempting.
! Ha! I know! I can't help laughing myself every time I think about it.
"Your apology will be only accepted if you called me by my name, Draco." Draco pursed his lips.
"You know, they say body heat is the quickest way to warm up." Draco nodded along as Harry spoke, quaking like a leaf, just about prepared to do anything Harry asked of him. But then Harry sneezed.
He spun around and whispered quickly, "
"I could never force you into betraying your values for my own selfish benefit," he panted, a sheen of sweat appearing as he picked up the pace. "I can't believe you even agreed-
"Oh, that little bugger!" Draco muttered to himself, but everyone could easily hear him. "I knew he stole it! And my pink nail-polish has been missing ever since he took it to use it. I bet he has that as well. Dammit!" Blaise coughed and Draco picked his head up to look at him. "Yeah?"
Draco sat down much more smoothly onto the edge of the bed. "What are you suggesting, Po--Harry?"
He took one of my hands in two of his so harshly I sat up in the momentum. He jerked me even closer and pressed my hand flat over his heart. "Can you hear my heart beat in your fingertips?" he asked me. My own quickened as I looked at him.
"Give up yet, Tom?" Harry taunted as he dodged yet another spell unscathed.
"I'll love you forever, I'll like you always..." Harry's voice echoed and he spun around. He realized that he didn't have any chronic aches from his old age and looked down to discover that he wasn't 157 anymore. His hair was blond-silver and longer and fuller, his face was smooth, and he wore his tight clothes again. Draco looked at his perfectly manicured hands and estimated that he was around 19 years instead. He smiled and decided he liked this dream.
"So, do you-" Again, I lost my words.
"You create your own heaven, Draco." Harry replied with a twitching smile.
He sighed. "I guess you're right,"
"The plan?" he spluttered. I guess he wasn't counting on having a partner-in-crime. Least of all me.
"Apology accepted, Potter. And I digress my...apologies towards my very demeaning behavior and mannerisms to your own self and group."
Of course, none of them included a certain green-eyed hero that stole his heart one very important night to her knowledge. Nor any one else's
the one helping
"Don't be a git," I mumbled. "You know what I meant," I couldn't help the way my cheeks flamed. We were two teenaged boys talking about sex after all. Two teenaged, horny, virgin boys.
"Well, besides the fact that Voldemort is dead, I guess it's because its a new day, the sun is shinning...and I get to spend this glorious time with the only person in the whole wide world that still hates my guts." Draco was nearly smothered by the sarcasm in his voice.
Tiny droplets of rain trickled down Draco's face and Harry caught them with his tongue, and started to nibble Draco's ear. Draco gasped at the pleasure he felt and moved his mouth onto Harry's neck. Neither of them noticed how tight their pants suddenly became until they brushed up against one another, eliciting waves of pleasure and groans. Harry panted as he looked into Draco's eyes. "Let's finish this inside." He ghosted on a breath and Draco nodded, seeing as how it stopped raining and he had some pressing matters to attend to.
We both scanned the glowing document before us, but I saw his name still firmly attached to the Nice List first. In fact, it looked a little more attached now. He kinda slumped in defeat. I nudged him gently. "So, Plan B, then?" I asked.
Harry snapped out of it, looking a lot worse for wear, just as Draco was being tortured with the never-ending curse. Eventually, Draco fell into unconsciousness even while his body was still being ravaged by it. Harry turned to Voldemort with his eyes ablaze at seeing one of his newly joined members, even if it was Malfoy, tortured like that. Voldemort just laughed some more.
Blaise sort of glared at him. "Why? Do you have problem with him, or me being gay?"
"Do you mean..?" Draco blinked, unsure.
naked and so unashamed. He raised an eyebrow at my looking and I flushed away. I imagined that he must have softened because he became so gentle with me in every way.
"Sounds good." Harry shouted from the other end. "So, are you ready to lose Malfoy?" Draco could see his smirk.
"I'm a Gryffindor. I rush head-first into things," I managed to pull out of the hair's breadth between us. "When am I ever sure about anything?"
"It's not that I'm afraid of," I admitted quietly.
"Good luck." He said patting Draco on the back as he left.
"Why?" Draco finally spoke.
do this."
dreams.
"See, there was a reason my whole family line followed the Dark-er side. They knew off the old bat's manipulative ways. Ohhh, and I should have known. There were signs,
Wait. No, it started even before then
"Okay, so tell me what is it and then I'll weigh everything in hindsight and decide," I urged.
"I'm hoping Plan A will take care of it, because Plan B is a little...extreme."
Harry did, obviously. They spent too much time around each other for him not to. "Funny, I also was sure that the drop dead sexy blond with amazing silver eyes who was making love to me was a maniac from a society that adores you." Draco smiled as he placed his goblet on the table.
"If I may say so myself..." He smirked, only for a short time, before it softened to a smile and his eyes twinkled fondly. "Harry's best trait of all is love; as simple as that." He paused to take a few deep breaths in.
"Could you pass me the Daily Prophet please, Neville?" Neville barely picked it up before Seamus stood as spoke to Harry.
I blushed. "Stuff it, Finnegan," I mumbled, rubbing the back of my neck. There wasn't any reason for me to deny it since it was pretty obvious and would be more obvious once it was revealed what List-side I was on. And my, what a shock that would be. It was hard keeping the devilish smirk to myself, not to mention stopping myself from snickering.
I knew better than to ask him "what?" since he would only mumble some more so I laughed and pieced it together myself. "I got...'I', 'lose' and...'virginity'," I said before my eyes widened. "Oh. Oh, I see. You need me to help you find someone to, erm, have sex with. Yeah, I can see where that requires more effort...we do have a short time limit, after all, and-"
"A truce, then, Mister Potter."
On the first day, Draco simply thought Harry caught something, seeing as a bug was going around. Or that perhaps he is just throwing another hissy fit he was notorious for. He personally entertained the thought that Harry was working on something for just the two of them. By the second day, he started to get worried, especially after seeing Hermione's perplexed expression at Breakfast.
? Seamus Finnegan is your boyfriend? I didn't even know you were gay!"
"Gold--as in galleons, Harry." He added with a smirk at Harry's shocked look. "Favorite creature?"
"Should I be asking if you really are Potter instead?" he drawled and for the first time, I could understand why the girls loved him despite his horrible treatment of well, everyone, at one time. There was an undercurrent of warmth and a hint of intimacy that made me shiver.
Harry twirled his wand in his hands, looking at it as he spoke. "Whatever you want: Truth or Dare, simply asking random questions we've always wanted to know the answers to; I'm up for anything."
"And the Plan is?" I asked a bit huffy. He wasn't getting anywhere for the last several minutes or so.
"What has got you so happy?" his wife asked him, immediately suspicious of his happiness. He squashed down the ridiculous grin he must have been sporting. Despite Astoria's rather pleasant and cheerful manner, she was still a Slytherin at heart and had known him too long to not be wary of anything positive in his grim and weary stature outside of his wonderful son. Most times, nothing good ever came out of such moods and she full well knew it. They couldn't afford such things to damage their still precarious reputations.
"It's not that either," I said with a little shake of my head and tiny laugh. "I'm not...like you,"
"I know, that's why I say it." Harry thrusted the papers in Draco's face. "Now read."
"I still won." Draco paused to think about it and in the end Harry was right. He hadn't made up that many rules, more like flimsy guidelines, because he was so bored. And seeing as they both stopped playing, Harry was in the lead still.
," It was my turn to blush at his compliment.
"You all know who I am, what I've done, so please, if anyone has any objections to me speaking for Harry object now or forever hold your peace." He scanned the crowd and none surprisingly, Ronald Weasley stood up with help of his cane.
"And I know something else that doesn't tickle," Draco said, confusing Harry before he saw the black velvet box. He gasped then, almost missing his next words. "Will you marry me?"
More seriously, I continued. "If you don't mind," I said very quiet. "I'd really like it if you would stay with me. Just for a little bit."
There was another silent moment. "So, um," I coughed. "D'you think we have enough time to, uh..." I trailed off.
"Alright," Seamus said. "We all know that Harry has been upstairs hiding away, but we don't know why." Everyone nodded at this, even Ron. "So the plan is this, and I worked all night on it: we march up the stairs and barge into the room demanding what is wrong. Be prepared to use force against him, mainly tickling with this feather." He held up a pink feather for everyone to see.
The last three words were more like a puff of sound than anything else. "What?" I asked, because this story was rather interesting.
"Well, I'm-I was," he stammered and I raised an eyebrow. He was either being so unlike himself or showing me a whole new, realer side to him. Either way, I was impressed by the blush that painted his face. You should have seen how quickly and fully it spread.
"Yep."
It was then that I understood.
"No reason." Blaise replied.
Inwardly, Draco smiled because he knew that they were officially coming out as a couple. Not that Harry knew Draco already blew that. So, he went along with the act. He sighed loudly and rubbed his temples. "Snook-ums, you know Daddy doesn't like being called that name." Harry gave one of his brilliant smiles, the ones that take Draco's breath away--not that Draco would ever let him know that--, and sat down by him.
Draco scanned the top page before scowling at it. "You know I don't read this junk, Harry." And that was not part of their act, he really didn't.
"I dunno...Ow! What was that for?" Harry asked, holding his offended head.
"Why didn't you go to Madame Pomfrey's then, if you were so 'sick' as you claim to be?" Dean asked.
Harry pouted. "This is all Dumbledore's fault, he was the one who wanted this to happen and now he won't help us."
"You can't even say the word, Ron, and besides I think you are too busy with Hermione to actually notice I'm around. And do I even act like a gay person?"
But he came down on me in a fury that he had to write this; so I conceded, knowing that he would get the job done as it was only the two of us that could really do honor for Harry tomorrow. That was a week ago, and he was still revising and editing and making additions to his words. I was fearful that he might not finish it in time...at least until I hear his quill drop.

The first time that Draco awoke after that night, it was near the middle of summer. Draco groaned once he realized he was awake, startling Harry out of his zoned-outness. "Draco...Draco?" He said softly, using Malfoy's first name for the first time.

The smirk from before came back. "I'm a Slytherin," he said, taking my words and rephrasing them to suit his situation. "When do I ever tell the
So, uh, you want to know what happened next, right?
They flew around outside in the very enclosed yard in circles, wondering what to do since there was no snitch. But Draco could only take so many circles after being bored all day. "How about we have a challenge; do stunts that the other has to mirror perfectly. And the loser has do whatever the winner asks."
"Your greatness, it is my pleasure to give you this..." Draco murmured a spell and the whole Order of the Phoenix apparated to his hideout, including Potter. Voldemort took one look and turned to angrily glare at the two.
"I'm not fixing anything," he started mumbling now. "If you must know, I'm actually doing the opposite."
Seamus wolf-whistled in the silence. Notorious mate himself, you know. "Way to go, Potter," he cheered, giving a few claps. "First ever walk of shame and on Christmas too, eh? Not bad work mate,"

"We talked about that, it won't work."
Harry heard the sound of many footsteps and reasoned why to himself: 'Must be they finally decided to check up on me and see what's wrong. Glad Hermione didn't spill on me, at least.' With a sigh he closed the book he was reading and laid it on top of his mattress, binding out. He took a minute trying to find a comfortable spot for when the interrogation would start. Soon after, the group busted in.
"Really?" he squeaked in obvious shock. "Well, uh, okay. So, um, where...?"
"Alright, alright, save the motivational speech," Draco mumbled. "Plan B is going to...require a lot more of...sacrifice on your part," I'm pretty sure he started to wince every time he paused. "Um, I won't hold it against you if you...you know, decide that it's going to be too...hard on yourself, 'cause this is my problem, after all. But, um, this is my last hope so..."
"Well, then, how about--"
"Please," I half-whimpered, half-moaned.
boring. And difficult. It kinda was a surprise to me that I agreed to go back to finish my seventh year, the "eighth-year" you know, and all. And, of course, since the "Boy-Who-Lived" went back at least half of my fellow class-mates returned just because I was. Blind loyalty and devotion or whatever and all.
"Draco.." He whispered. "If you can't handle this, we'll have to escort you..." The threat was enough; Draco fixed his posture and stopped his caterwauling. But the tears still flowed.
"Just a little while, Drakie-poo." Harry said mockingly in a very high pitched voice, using their pet-names that they had come up with out of boredom. He started to cackle like mad as he ran away into the bathroom.

Well, anyways, I got up a bit stiffly since, you know, and went up to my dormitory to take a shower. Felt like it would be a nice way to freshen up after last night. Unfortunately for me, I didn't check the time. So the Common Room was practically full. And I entered looking, for all the world, like I had just had sex. Glasses slightly askew, hair even more messed up, bruised lips, maybe a few marks I hadn't noticed yet and all. I'm sure you see what everyone else did.

"Listen, Draco, I like seeing this whole side of you that you obviously keep under lock and key or something," he gave a small nod in acknowledgement of my guess. "But you can't just give up now, for whatever reason! This is important and you'll never forgive yourself if you, or if I let you, give up now,"
"Ugh, just get out of here before you incur 'Mione's wrath." Most of the boys, even Ron, left at that but Seamus was on a roll today for annoying the Boy-Who-Lived.
"Oh, nothing. Nothing at all," he waved off loftily, as one would expect from proper pure-blood custom to deny the existence of anything
"Ah, and you worked on this all night, Seamus?" Dean spoke with a mocking tone.
He burst out laughing. "Merlin, you are such a virgin!"
I stopped after he was looking incredulously at me. "I do hope you aren't mocking me," he whispered, his voice edgier and tense.
The silver-haired boy was still too startled to speak and just walked over to his new bed and continued to stare at Harry which then made Harry notice that everyone at the dorm was staring at him. He had been warned that his magical abilities were far too advanced and might cause some envy and fear, among others. Murmurs were starting to sweep all around him again. Harry guessed he needed to get used to all this.
Harry was so lucky to have made such amazing friends, they were so different, yet they are had stuck together since the day they met at the academy. He had promised them all to write letters and keep in touch when he went to his ‘fancy’ boarding school in Scotland. He had told them it was what his late parents would have wanted, that it was a family tradition that he could not break, being the only one left. Not a complete lie, by the way, Harry had assured himself. He had rather not lie but this one was out of his hands. In order to be part of this new exciting world, he had to abide by the rules or make he never gets caught if he were to ‘step around’ them”.
The Slytherin common room looked out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. The Giant Squid and other interesting aquatic creatures could be seen roaming about from the gigantic windows.
HEY GUYS! So sorry for updating late, life has been a little bit more hectic than usual! I feel like this is a gateway chapter to harry actually starting to come to his own, so the next 2 chapters will explore the next four years of Harry’s life, so the chapter will be longer! Personally I just want to get Harry into Hogwarts ;)
“The least I could do” Harry pointed to the silver boys’ belongings and turned to Smile at him.
“Hey son, do you see your parents?” Clint was now sitting on the empty stretcher next to Harry.
I wish you all a happy new year!
She was now nodding her head which made her sun kissed blond hair bounce slightly around her, still deep in thought probably trying to see what else she should tell him.
After the customary greetings and hugs, the group made their way to the shop. The first thing that captured Harry's attention were the golden mannequins bearing the latest wizard fashions sitting in the window display. Inside, the shop was lit by multiple big chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the light of the many candles making the polished wood that covered the wall and most of the furnishings seem to glitter which made harry want to run up and touch the material. The sitting area was decorated with plush velvet furniture and a wooden table with a very finely detailed red tablecloth, where tea and biscuits were floating about, waiting to serve the new patrons. Now that they were ushered in and seated Harry could see more mannequins lining the back walls, showing various wizard fashions, but no trace of muggle fashion could be seen anywhere. It was obvious that this was a shop that everything is made to order.
“What do you think we should get her today? Bead loom? Firecrackers? Rubik’s cube?”
“You know what, Salazar Slytherin looked for in his chosen students? The seeds of greatness. You have been chosen by this house because you've got the potential to be great, in the true sense of the word!”
“Boy I have told you time and time again, not to talk like that! You’re not better than anyone here! And no normal boy your age talks like that!” Vernon was now glaring at Harry, his eyes were livid. It always irritated Vernon when he spoke in a well-mannered and grammatically correct way; something his own son and wife, or even himself for that matter, lacked greatly.
Harry was not ready to let go of what he had just attained. After all these years of solitary holidays, staring out of the window he had what he always wanted, and now he was being forced to leave it all for being

arrives. Normally students wait to purchase everything after receiving the letter but the Beaumont’s wanted to avoid the inevitable crowds of families and long lines scrambling to buy school supplies and apparently the headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore had agreed to send the Beaumont’s the supply list ahead of time to avoid unnecessary risks.

Harry could see as Felix rolled his eyes and begun stalking towards him, a frown planted on his lips. ‘Stupid tree’ could be heard distinctly from Felix’s lips.
"Nuh-uh, Malfoy. I so had you pinned." Harry grinned, his hair black and white from feathers stuck in his hair and it even messier than thought possible. He plucked a feather out of his hair and dropped it.
I gasped.
Draco sighed through his nose as he lowered the article. So much for discretion. He risked a glance at Potter, catching those impossibly-green eyes of his once-lover, and noted the concerned expression in them. He shook his head with the simplest of smiles and Harry continued his enthusiastic conversation with his Trio. It wasn't like he could say no to him. Not any more. He'd just have to hope few people took Skeeter at her word anymore and deal with the fallout later.
"You mean, the fact that you gave up your virginity to me or your whole hero-complex in general?" he teased.
"If he's not, tell me why he has a copy of
"No!" Draco blurted. "Seeing as..." He trailed off before he could expose their secret.
"...Alright I'm in. Let's go see what's wrong with Harry."
"Harry!" He whispered, delighted, spinning around to actually see him and then kissing him passionately.

He narrowed his eyes and took his hands away to cross his arms. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Happy Yuletide, Harry," he says right before I fall asleep.
"I, uh, well..." Harry struggled to find a way to answer without telling him the truth. Seamus, who had sat down closest to the book, picked it up and read the title out loud.
Shock went down his entire body, starting at the top. His cheeks prettied themselves. He ducked his head. His hands dropped. His legs shifted their weight. "Potter," he mumbled, whipping his head back up after a moment so that his hair fell into his eyes. "You're a bloody

"Alright," I said, clearing my throat. "I'll, um, I'll bottom is it?" I wasn't too sure on the technical terms, you see.
With a nod and 'finite incantum', Draco stepped down and walked over to the late Harry James Potter-Malfoy. He got to be their first as he was his spouse. "I'll love you forever, I'll like you always. As long as I'm living, my baby you'll be..." He sang sweetly as he stroked his lover's cold cheek before breaking down.
It started with a rejected handshake and then pretty much the same handshake several years later- one that I accepted this time around. Everything seemed to escalate after that. Luckily, things managed to level out before anything seriously damaging actually came as a result of it.
I raised my wand higher at that comment and grew more serious. "I don't think you're in any position to break things, Malfoy, you're lucky just to be back here after what you did."
"Hey, Drakie-poo!" Harry shouted from behind him, making him jump in fright.
"Well, go ahead, you know it better than me. I'll just be another one of your hulking bodyguards on the lookout," When he didn't laugh at my attempt to lighten the mood, I gestured for him to step forward even though I didn't know if he needed to cast if from a certain distance or not.
"I may be getting off track by my passion to show you the 360° Harry, so excuse me and this sentence please; but now I think you are ready for my concluding debate:
." Harry flushed at the realization as well and stammered an explanation. Draco cleared his throat again and Harry somehow recovered.
"Ah, I see how it is. I'll start with a fairly simple question: What, may I ask, is your favorite color?"
." Harry wanted them to realize he wasn't gay, but bisexual, without overtly saying so, but they--or rather mostly Seamus--was too thick-headed to notice his implications.
"You know," Seamus began. "The funny thing is is that Harry basically said the same things before he admitted to being gay by..."
Harry and Draco were decidedly not bored anymore as they reached their last days of vacation. But a new problem had arisen.
time."
He gave me a look but I just shrugged. I wanted to hear it out of his mouth I guess. "You are the first one under the Nice List. Actually, why don't you see for yourself," the grin he gave kinda scared me a bit. No, just made me apprehensive. Really apprehensive.
"No, no, I don't think so. I mean, we're both straight, right?" He smirked and nodded his head just once so subtly that I almost missed it. "Yeah, so we both know this isn't anything more than two guys who are helping each other out."
I could feel his muscles tighten and hear him breath harder, shaking with the effort to restrain himself. "You can do it, Draco," I said softly, looking straight into his eyes.
He wrapped an arm around my waist and pulled me into his body heat. "I'd like it too, Harry."
After they put his luggage and owl cage into storage Harry boarded the cart and waved one last time at his family and headed inside. It was time to face his new reality.
Celest had written down the address in her elegant handwriting and had charmed it to follow Laurent around an hour before the set time to meet at the shop. This was the result of a misfortunate error on Laurent’s part last year when he had forgotten to pick up the presents she had specially ordered for Christmas. Apparently, it was not the first time such an incident had happened. Now Celest was determined to ensure it never happened again.
in my house! Huh? Don’t you, boy?” He cocked his eyebrows and looked straight at Harry. Not giving him a chance to respond, he continued, “Not after that lesson I gave him last time! The boy knows better! Even though he’s daft….” He shook his head and stalked out of the kitchen and dragged his wife away with him, probably to watch one of their stupid TV shows.
“Sorry to interrupt but what is a secret keeper exactly?” Harry had been receiving a ‘magic’ crash course, as Sabrina had put it, for the last couple weeks. Ever since he had asked her to teach him about magic
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy Throw your arms around the world
Dear Mr. Potter,
After the tree was set up, everyone was sitting by the fireplace, sipping on their drinks. The conversation was flowing and laughter could be heard from the windows outside the patio.
“Okay kids, open the doors cautiously and be careful and mindful of Brooke. Remember that she is in pain and that she needs to rest. So no monkeying around, are we clear?” Céleste was looking each child dead in the eye to convey her message. Being a CEO of a multimillion pound company, she knew how to express herself and achieve the desired effect.
Collective gasps could be heard all around the room, Harry happy with the outcome cheerfully removed the hat and handed it to the shocked older woman that had introduced herself as Minerva and made his way down the stairs and towards the Slytherin table.
“Oh baby I was so worried about you! Oh god! I thought I lost you! I swear I’ll stop smoking! Oh god I should have been there for you! I’m so, so sorry!” Her frantic arms were now circling around her, lifting up from the stretcher. The next ten minutes was filled with similar scenes: mothers and fathers scooping up their babies and dashing off.
He felt like he understood the universe. He was the universe. It controlled him and he controlled it. Forever expanding and shrinking. Pulsing all around him. Colors melting into each other creating shades he never knew even existed. Does he even exist anymore? He didn’t care.
Laurent promised to send him baked goods if his grades are good and Benoit promised to send him sweets regardless of his grades which made him receive a glare from Laurent.
Even though no one but Harry and the Dursleys knew what had really happened between the two, Harry had let the Beaumont family know that the Dursleys didn’t approve of his heritage and that was why he had no information of what he really was. So everyone was happy to cooperate and do as instructed.
is anyone interested to be my Beta?
Hmmm so instead of his kids, the gods punish him?” He still didn’t like the whole idea of Loki being captured (he was his favorite character after all), but he knew each story had to have a ‘moral’ ending for the kids.
“You need patience! But to answer some of your questions: yes, if you ever succeed in attuning yourself with nature that will help you immensely, as it is an unlimited source of power. But there are limitations specifically when used in the dark arts. Now when I say that I don’t mean the new ministry interpretation of dark magic, but the old laws laid down by Merlin and those before him…” Looking at Harry’s slightly confused and curious gaze she chuckled.
Without pause, all other Slytherins raised their glasses and echoed his sentiments. Harry already felt better. He had made the right choice. The sorting ceremony carried on for another hour and once it was done the students were ushered by their heads of houses toward their own private common rooms.
“Well now mon lutin lets go back, mama was worried about you and sent me to find you and I’m afraid if we take any longer she will send Adele after us. And we both know she would not appreciate being bothered out of her routine.” He was referring to Adele’s daily routine of getting lost in the enchanted forest while on the hunt of rare ingredients for a specific crystallization potion. Which they were camping at for two weeks’ now (a Beaumont family tradition that would take effect before their children’s eleventh birthday and the arrival of the most important letter thus far in their lives.
As Harry was rummaging through the box -- Felix had already given up and was playing with his square Game Boy by the fireplace and loudly drinking his virgin eggnog -- he came across the star. Three of the five points were broken and the angel face was missing a nose.
elderly guide so many questions that the poor woman basically bolted out of the room like a mad ostrich as soon as they had reached the end of the tour.
” Again he was met with a look. “
They had decided that they would all take Sabrina to her designated station and send her off first and then accompany Harry to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters and make sure to remind him they loved him and will be missing him dearly. Laurent especially felt like he was losing a son he had just found. Definitely more hours will be spent either baking or woodworking when celeste is away as well. Laurent was a true family man, nothing made him happier and more content than being with all his family and taking care of them.
Harry took his last glance at the view before him and apparated away. He knew that he had nothing more to give.
September 1
“We want the finest robes for our Harry, so we came to the finest establishment!” she complimented them in her French accent which seems to make Mr. Twilfitt beam even wider if that was at all possible, his husband was less emotive.
The Slytherin prefect reminded them that classes start the next day, September 2
As minutes? Hours? Days? Begun to pass he felt less and less connected to the things that made him and yet he had never felt more connected to them at the same time.

Hello Beautiful people! If you are still reading this story THANK YOU! and I apologize for uploading once every blue moon... 8 chapters in 6 years... all I can say life gets in the way, my dudes. Hope you all enjoy and stay safe & strong during these hard times.
Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore
and that their class schedules will be handed to them during breakfast and that the much anticipated Quidditch trials will be held during the second week, along with flying lessons for the first years.
He was now shaking his head in amusement and patting Harry on the back. “Harry your future will be extraordinary, I promise you that, and with no doubt I can say that you will always come out on top. Me and my family, and even the wizarding world I dare say, will no doubt be blown away by what you can accomplish. And Harry, I cannot wait to see what there is to come!”
As much as he portrayed being always in control and very goal-oriented, the truth was that he was so scared to let anyone see his weaknesses and he would rather have them at arm’s length or out of his life rather than feeling humiliated like he used to be. Sabrina and Samantha were the only people that he let be close to him. And they still didn’t know everything that he had been through, didn’t know of the dark thoughts that passed through his head. He may feel lonely most of the times, but that feeling seemed to be a constant in his life; and as mad as it may seem to anyone else, some part of him loved and craved that feeling.
“Ma’am your daughter is safe. She is sitting right here,” Clint guided a hysterically looking woman towards the red haired girl sitting next to him. She was surprisingly the calmest of all the other four, barely saying anything or crying. She was just playing with her necklace and starring at her hands, ignoring everything that was going on around them. As soon as she heard her mother’s voice, her eyes snapped up and a frown colored her otherwise expressionless face. Interesting.
Blaise a dark-skinned boy he had met earlier at the sorting ceremony and now the occupant of the bed next to Harrys, approached him first and lightly inquired about Harry's abilities. He seemed friendly and naturally curious, but Harry had to remember that Slytherins were all naturally cunning so he had to remember to always watch his back until he was completely sure they can be trusted.
Were there any empty carts left? Harry kept going down passing full carts after another until he stumbled across an orange-haired boy shoving chocolate frogs in his mouth and a curly-haired girl looking at him in both fascination and disgust.
“Ne t'inquiète pas, Harry, mon mignon.” she said as she hugged him. It always made him blush when she called him beautiful. He wasn’t used to such displays of affection. No one other that Samantha had ever in his life complimented his appearance, and to be honest Harry was only now realizing that he was better looking than most people, at least better looking than the people in his town and school… “I’ll teach you everything you will need to know,” she kissed the top of his head and hugged him tighter. It felt nice.
“Sabrina you better go get ready for your lesson before Benoit comes back, he was too silent during lunch. He’s going to get back at us any day now” Adele had a mischievous gleam in her eyes. Harry was pretty confident even when both siblings are grey and riddled with wrinkles they would still be pulling pranks on each other.
The Sorting Hat aware of his thoughts mused again “Loyalty, eh? Are you sure? Slytherins are associated with cunning, ambition, and a tendency to look after their own. Slytherin has produced its share of Dark witches and wizards, beware. They are always striving to be the best, something they have in common with Ravenclaws. However, Slytherins will never leave their own behind.”
"Really?" Draco perked up so much it was startling. "How do you know?"
"Oh, so does little Potter and junior traitor Malfoy care for each other? I didn't know that you were that way for all the people you hated,
"No, no. Harry's fine. Turns out he's gay and..." Seamus continued.
"Draco, don't be like that. I know that you have a major headache, and I can see your hands twitch ever so often." Draco turned around to face him.
"Aha! You admit to it!" At Harry's perplexed look, he continued. "You said 'people' not 'other women', and you obviously don't care about women at all to have 23 of them and cheat on them with 3
"Oh." He said after awhile, moving to sit down by Draco. "I guess that was obvious. But, hey, you do act more gay."
"Yes, you die right after my funeral. How cliché." Harry spoke.
Before Draco knew what he was doing, he sighed and answered. "I'm hoping to propose to him before the end of the year. But that might not work seeing as he's holding himself up in his room. I have it all planned out...sort of. And I suppose it's all thanks to Dumbledore, he was the one who made us start our friendship in the summer." Then he noticed whom he was talking to. "Finnegan, you better get lost and not tell a word of what I said or it will be your head!" He threatened before ditching the Gryffindor.
"Draco, by standing up and basically telling everyone that you're Harry's lover, it does sound like you are g..." Pansy said soothingly before Draco actually stood up and interrupted her.
, considering what I felt rubbing against me. But I pushed that aside. We didn't have time for this kind of foolishness. Obviously I was under the delusion of being all hormonal at getting rid of my virginity obviously. 'Cause there was no way I would be thinking like this unless my brain was all messed up and confused with this onslaught of hormones.
“Hmm, difficult. VERY difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes. And a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you? Gryffindor? Ravenclaw? Slytherin?”
“Harry Potter! I can’t believe it’s been eleven years…” he said as he shook his head in pity.
He felt at peace, like never before. He knew. What he knew? He didn’t even know. But he knew that he knew and he was okay with just knowing what he knew. Did that even make sense?
They were all sitting in Sabrina’s mother’s SUV. Céleste Beaumont was a very beautiful woman with blond hair and green eyes that could almost rival Harry’s. Any time Harry would see her -- which was not much since she traveled all around the world running a muggle (which he had learnt is a term used for non-magical humans) company called Morphée Joaillerie which was based in Paris -- she would always be kind and gentle with him. She would teach him all that he had missed about being a wizard growing up with magic-hating muggles, but most of all Harry loved Sabrina’s father, Laurent. He was ‘a stay at home dad’ catering to his children’s every needs, which included Sabrina’s older siblings, Adele and Benoit. Both older siblings resided in Paris and helped run the company and its various branches with their mother. Keeping the family business alive and fruitful was the long and proud tradition of the Beaumont family since the family firm started trading in Versailles in 1777, and attracted the patronage of its most famous client, Marie Antoinette. The family firm then moved to Paris eventually settling at 9 Rue de la Paix. And now Céleste and Henry, her brother, were the fourteenth generation that owned it.
"Well," he shuffled his feet in an uncharacteristic move. "It was sort of a planned...accident," he continued before I could do more than open my mouth. "Mother informed me that there were whispers of Dumbledore's final parting gift unto the school, something to promote his beloved inter-house unity, to keep me aware. No one knew anything more about it or if it even
to get you off the Nice List," I said. "People's heads will...will
I watched him furiously--to the ignorant eye--and heart-brokenly in a fast speed--to the knowing--write out his fifteen sentence monologue to give to Harry. I was clueless, for once, as to why he was scripting out only fifteen sentences; Ronald and nearly all of our former class of Gryffindor was going to be there and he knew better than to possibly ignite my husband's fury by giving a less than adequate speech. Especially at tomorrow's services.
Well, none of it would be worth repeating out loud. Not to mention, terribly uncouth of him to do so any ways.
"I was a terrible person," he continued. "And you-you
~*~ Nineteen years later ~*~
He didn't even attempt to sneer at that like he had used to, but he still had the attitude in broken sort of way. It's just sad. Even though he was a right bastard back then with it. "That's not what I meant, Potter," he said and I put away my wand after awhile.
? Me,
Harry threw his head back in laughter and a pang went through Draco's heart as he realized one, how much he missed hearing it, and two, that he never would have to go without it again. He gave Draco one of his classic roguish grins. "How about 15 minutes?"
Harry smiled at him like he was a silly child, or maybe like he enjoyed Draco's venom. "Headquarters, of course. And you are still my charge until the end of summer, remember? So I'm responsible for you. " Of course Draco remembered. He would always remember spending any amount of time with Potter unwillingly. He would always remember the old coot forcing them to be partners in the war over what should have been a happy, no-school-so-I-don't-see-Potter-and-his-lackeys summer with that stupid twinkle in his eyes.
“I am not an elf!” Harry huffed and stomped his feet.
“Nearly six months…”
“Well my sweet Harry, my publisher wouldn’t appreciated if the story ends with Loki living happily ever after, after all the mischief he causes. What kind of a lesson would that teach kids? Families will hate me!” she said with a laugh. She really had a beautiful laugh. Harry always liked to think that if his mother was alive, that’s how her laugh would have sounded like.
It wasn’t too long ago that the concept of love was as real to him as dragons, well little did he know that dragons were real, so did as it turns out was love, as real as the dragons which Harry had just read on the paper had attacked a Muggle beach were a family of wizards, on holiday consequently defeated just last month. Before Mrs. Art and the Beaumonts, love was unknown to him. Nobody had loved him, nor had he loved anyone. Then along came Samantha Art. A loving, kind American woman set on teaching and taking care of obnoxious little kids. She had truly saved him. She was the reason he knew how to love the Beaumonts and become part of their family. He owed it all to Samantha.
Ms. Hollingworth was his elementary school’s principal, after his first week in first grade, the teachers had insisted for Harry to be transferred to a higher level, but again the Dursleys resisted. So now only a week left of his first year and he was just about to kill every single one of his classmates. They were unbearable. It didn’t help that Dudley kept spewing lies about him yet again. The only thing that had prevented him from staging the Dursleys deaths and disappearing was Mrs. Art – sorry, Samantha. Even after she left the nursery school where they first met and published her children’s book (which had become very successful), she had still kept in touch with Harry. She even dedicated her first book to him and thanked him for the countless hours he tolerated her reading the book to him over and over again, improving it even though they both knew without her, Harry would have either gone insane or murderous… maybe even both.
Twenty minutes later they were all lined up to floo to Diagon alley where Celest was most definitely waiting for them, the piece of paper with the Address scribbled on it was now buzzing around Laurent’s head and poking his right shoulder towards the Fireplace. It really had an attitude. It made Harry's heart flutter to think that the whole family was taking the time to take him shopping for robes and school supplies in Diagon alley, so he can get more acquainted to his future… environment? Home didn’t seem to feel quite right yet.
One by one they all hugged Harry telling him how much they loved him and will miss him.
The Hat continued “Ravenclaws are famous for clambering over each other to get good marks, whereas Slytherins are brothers.” Then Harry definitely did not want to be a Ravenclaw.
Hey guys! I apologies whole heatedly for updating so late! I hate when other fellow authors do that, but I do understand we all have a hectic life and occasional writer’s blocks! I’m introducing more characters in this chapter. And next chapter will be more magic oriented and a certain letter will find its way to Harry! Please comment what you think & Enjoy!
“One witch was then possessed by an angry spirit and kept repeating ‘You killed my children, your children will never live in peace.’ When the priestess stepped out of the boundaries of the original circle, she was attacked by bees. They should have known better than to attempt to command spirits whose true names they do did not know!” She gave him a very pointed look. Harry was debating whether or not he should believe her cautionary tale. It did make sense what she was saying so whether or not those events had occurred where really not important.
“Felix are you sure your dad said he put it in this box?” Harry asked one of his best mates. They all had a tradition, to spend Christmas at one of their houses each year, and this year Felix was the lucky fella!
Harry knew that he was very smart. Even smarter than his own friends, but for reasons that he was not yet comfortable with or didn’t understand. He instinctively tried to make himself seem less intelligent and aware. Maybe it was because he wanted to finally belong somewhere or maybe it was because he still didn’t want to fully trust anyone, at least then he would always be protected.
He hugged Sabrina tightly, taking in her scent, committing it to memory. She truly had become his family. She understood and knew him in a way that nobody else seemed to. She saw him for who he really was and loved him regardless. At times he had confessed to her the dark thoughts and impulses that crossed his mind, especially when the Dursleys had been at their worst. Abuse was a light term to describe what the Dursley family had put him through and he remembered every minute of it, some nights he would wake from night terrors, relieving his old memories. Just a 3-year-old child, terrified and lost in a sea of people and strange noises, crying, wetting his pants and so so lost and confused, so unloved and untouched. The Dursleys had forgotten him at a carnival they had all visited for Dudley’s birthday. 3-year-old Harry had spent 3 terrifying hours wandering the carnival and 2 other terrible hours waiting for his neglectful family to come to collect him after the police had calmed him down enough between his hiccups and tears to tell them his name.
“It’s a position in quidditch, you have to be very fast on your broom!” Harry still didn’t understand brooms, which seemed like such a Hollywood stereotype type of a thing. Can’t wizards just make themselves fly? It should be fairly simple. If you know the physics behind it and you have the power to manipulate the elements in your favor… seemed like a no brainer to him.
Not wanting to already start off on a bad note with one of his fellow Slytherins, Harry Apparated the boy’s belongings from his hands and placed them on the bed opposite to himself on the opposing row. Same bed different side and well… one less window but who is counting anyway?
“’arry that looks brilliant! Merci mon amour!” Sabrina planted an extra wet kiss on his cheek and dashed away from him with her plate firmly held in her hands, ever since the unfortunate time she
“Yes, Conner?” he drawled out, raising his eyebrows at his friend.
the Beaumonts had made an effort to teach Harry everything he needed to know about magic before going to Hogwarts. But as Harry had suspected, they had probably covered more than the materials he needed to know for his first year, but he didn’t mind at all. After all, information was power.
“It's Christmastime; there's no need to be afraid
“Hmmm…let me see…” Now he was rummaging in his own pile of homework, compliments of being ‘gifted’ and going to a private school. Those slimy bastards really took this shite seriously. “X equals to 23, y is 27, and z is 0.” The information given didn’t seem to quite please his friend.
Minerva McGonagall
Harry was just too glad that next year when it was his turn he was in Hogwarts and didn’t have to host their annual Christmas tradition. He had already planned to stay with the Beaumont’s next year in Paris. The family had already gotten in touch with the Ministry and expressed their concerns about Harry’s family and demanded that Harry spend his holidays away at Hogwarts with them. And with the amount of influence that the family had over the Ministry and Harry’s celebrity status, the ministry had agreed very fast. As long as they kept quiet about Harry’s unfortunate childhood, as much as they knew about it.
“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”
“I’ve told you countless times to drop it! Ok? It was one, one measly mistake for god’s sake!”
They were all sitting around the kitchen table, the mid-July wind sweeping across the room while Harry’s eager eyes trailed Laurent’s every move as he put the finishing touches to his Escargots de Bourgogne, Harry would have never imagined that one day he would be salivating over the thought of delicious, delicious snails.
“As far as we’re concerned, once you've become a snake, you're one of ours – one of the elites.”
“Six months?” What was she talking about?
“Thank you Harry!” Felix’s mum shouted from the kitchen, carrying a big bowl with oven mittens and glaring at her own son “Felix! Get off your bum and help Harry!” she shouted as she begun stirring her bowl.
Sensing his uneasiness Hagrid quickly got everyone’s attention back to himself and started sputtering facts about the lands and the building itself. Harry lost in his thoughts picked up some things Hagrid was saying… Hogwarts was hugged by a vast forested area, and a fairly large lake, in the highlands of Scotland…If Muggles approach the castle, all they will see is a moldering ruin with a sign warning them to keep out, that it is unsafe. That’s a cool trick that Harry definitely wanted to learn how to do, could he just will it? He needed to experiment at a later time. They all hastily exited the boats now seeing the towers in their full glory, you could practically see the young girls and boys bursting with excitement. They were finally
“I cannot believe you did this! C’est des conneries! [This is bullshit!]” while Benoît was screaming at Adèle and making the glitter attack worse on himself, Harry took the time to learn from Benoît’s mistake and not make this worse for himself, after all they said he was a very smart and gifted young wizard.
“Oh Mrs. Art, don’t worry! Like you said he only did it because he was jealous! I mean his horse looked like a hippopotamus!” It was moments like this that Samantha was reminded Harry was just a six year old kid - or as he insisted six
“HAAAARYYYY!!!” Petunia had been shouting his name for the past minute. Harry hurriedly put on his cloths over his wet body, having just stepped out of the shower. He would just dry himself with his magic when the Dursleys weren’t around. As Harry opened the door Petunia stated yelling again.
“Ohhh yes, yes, Dumbledore! I knew he had a funny name! Merci papa!” She turned her head towards harry again. “So the headmaster is Albus Dumbledore. He is said to be on the side of the light and very powerful! Have a very long white beard and wears colorful robes with dancing kittens and elves!” She seemed to find this person very amusing, and he couldn’t blame her. Dancing kittens and elves? Really? What kind of a school was he going to? Where monsters and ghouls running around freely? And fairies making him breakfast? He didn’t like this feeling of the unknown, he wanted to be prepared. “But
“Ahh” Mr. Ollivander reached behind him and collected a pair of glasses and studied his customers.
Harry couldn’t believe that in a year he would be surrounded with people like himself well not really like him. According to Sabrina, Harry’s abilities were far more advanced even for a full grown wizard let alone a wandless child! Every time he thought about it, he would get so giddy that he could start jumping up and down and start laughing like a manic person.
me. And I will not tolerate being called any names and your oaf of a son spreading rumors about me in school! That’s not too much, now is it? Completely reasonable; what you should have done for me from the beginning!” He could see Petunia was dying to say something but raised a threatening eyebrow at her and pushed her harder on the couch with his magic. That seems to terrify her all the more and shut her up. “I’m not asking much, just let me be. Don’t talk to me, don’t look at me, ignore me for all I care. Pretend I don’t even exist. Just don’t get in my way or even try to intimidate me or go behind my back.
“I um…. There was no one injured in the fire, just a couple of scratches and bruises, one or two broken arms maybe. Here let’s get up and I’ll help you find them.” He was now using that fake, cheerful voice that adults seemed to think kids liked and it was not helping his headache. Ugh, he just wanted to go back to his cupboard and sleep.
This was a difficult decision. Harry was aware that it had been a while since the hat was placed on him and that everyone was anxiously awaiting which house, he will be sorted into. The tension in the air was so thick Harry could feel his magic bubbling in response. His parents were in Gryffindor, but his gut was telling him he belonged in Slytherin. He craved Loyalty.
Laughter could be heard as Harry tried to get up. He starred at the crumbled paper by his feet, far too proud to cry or show any indication that their antics bothered him. The paper moved and was thrown towards the obnoxious little blond girl that followed Dudley around like a puppy, on the back of the head. Since everyone was trying to look away and not be recognized as the culprit they were looking away, pretending to be playing with Legos and trying to muffle their laughter. So the action went unnoticed, but Harry was now very much curious.
"Young Harry let me walk you through the process… The wand chooses the wizard. That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wand lore... These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand." He was now starring deep into Harrys eyes, as if somehow, he could physically make him understand his words through the power of his gaze.
Also I would love to hear your thoughts on where you think this story is going, and what you want to happen!
After gazing at their petrified faces he removed the flames and continued on like nothing had even happened.
“Yes sir, we only have five more kids to pair with their parents. They were lucky,” the firefighter named Clint turned around towards the five kids he had just mentioned. And oh so surprising, Harry was one of them. He wouldn’t be too shocked if he was the last kid left sitting on the stretcher.
“They’re with maman. Working.” It was obvious she was a little jealous of the connection her siblings had with their mother and father that she didn’t. That’s why she was so anxious to start going to ‘a real school’ as she put it and finish, so she could start helping with the family business. All her dreams were only seven years away. It seemed like such a loooooooong time to Harry. He wished he knew what he wanted to do with his life.
Though that song really struck a chord with Harry. On some level he could connect with the song and feel the singer’s pain. As if she and he had become one person.

”Conner was caught off by Felix’s fist hitting his arm again, considerably harder this time. “You bloody tosser! I swear...”
So the first thing he did when he got home, locked into the cupboard after lunch, was to move objects with his mind as he had done with the ball. This of course was met with lots of failed attempts, and when he was angry and on the verge of giving up - the green soldier that he had stolen from Dudley’s room when he was cleaning it - was thrown against the cupboard door with a small
