Harry burst out laughing, "Roam free? You think we—they're roaming free? They're on the run from the British Ministry of Magic. They can stay in one place at a time for only so long and you think they're roaming free? They spend most of their time working on magic so they don't lose the ability to preform simple spells and you call that roaming free? You absolute idiot, 'Mio—!"
Harry showed Severus the bracelet. There was a crack right over the Hallows symbol, basically cutting it in half. "I've looked everywhere but no where does it say why the symbol of Death could be broken. I'm the Master of Death for god sake! Why would now, after so many years, why would it break now?!"
"I didn't attend seventh year. But Snape was Headmaster since Dumbledore died. Instead, me, Hermione and Ron went on a search for the rest of the Horcruxes. But the thing is, they can only be destroyed by the Sword of Gryffindor or Fiendfyre, which is really dangerous. It took us all year, but we found them. Most of them. We had found four of the seven. The diary, the ring, the real locket, which is the one me and Dumbledore went after, and the cup. One of them was in Hogwarts, a diadem. I saved Draco from Fiendfyre gone wrong in the room where we found the diadem. Then the Death Eaters broke into Hogwarts. That's when the war started. We found Snape dying in the boathouse, I think, and he told me to take his tears, which could be used to watch his memories. So I watched them. I watched him cradling my mothers dead body when he found out she had died, I found out he had made a Vow to protect me since he couldn't protect my mother and I found out he and my mother were childhood friends but drifted apart when he started earning interest in the Dark Arts. And I found out what the last Horcrux was. But here's the fun twist. I was the last Horcrux. When Voldemort came to kill me when I was a baby, he unknowingly created the Horcrux inside me. So I had to die. But in Dumbledore's Will, he gave me the Snitch I caught in my first Quidditch match. Engraved on it said,
Edit: I realized as I was writing chapter 12, that Bruce and Thor are not on Earth as of the end of Age of Ultron. I changed maybe two words that Bruce had asked.
"Alright, let me stop you right there. Draco was an asshole because of his father, Lucius. Lucius believed that Pureblood were better than half-bloods and especially Muggleborns. Draco was raised on his ideals. Narcissa was more open on the ideas but she couldn't speak up without risking her life. For the blood purity thing, basically Purebloods think they are, like the name says, of pure blood, meaning all wizardry decent. Occasionally, when the kids are raised like Draco was, they think they are higher up on the social chain. Then there's families like the Weasleys. They're also Purebloods but they are considered Blood Traitors for not believing they are better than the others. And Quidditch. It's a sport. I wish we could try it some day but we don't have the supplies. Well I do have a Snitch, but we need more brooms and the other balls. But! It's like soccer in the air, I guess. There are goalposts, brooms, balls, and seven members a team. There's three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and one Seeker. The Chasers are in charge of making the goals with the Quaffle, each goal being worth ten points. The Beaters make sure the other players don't get hit by the Bludger which is charmed to knock the players off their brooms. The Keeper is the goalie and the Seeker, which is what I was, is in charge of ending the game. The Seeker is after the Snitch, which is a flying gold little ball. It moves so quickly, you need to be on the look out for it at all times. If the Seeker chases the Snitch, the game ends and their team gets added 150 points, almost always winning the game for their team."
"No. But he could be doing it with magic. You never know."� Tony shrugged and made his way back to the Jet.
Draco came back and handed the potion to Harry who used his wand to add the blood required and pulled on the soul in his bracelet. Seconds later, Teddy's shot open, his hair and eyes switching colors in rainbow order before deciding on blue hair and green eyes.
people dying. It's one of the reasons I wanted to be an Auror—er, Knight? Guard? Officer? I don't know how to explain it. But, I wanted to become one because I wanted to do as much as I could to stop the deaths. But death is inevitable. After a while I just got used to that nagging feeling. I guess I just have to get used to it again."
"Harry James Potter, you're being sentenced to a lifetime in Azkaban for the murder of Tom Marvolo Riddle, attempted murder of Andrew Dennis Creevey and for assisting in the murder of Cedric Eldritch Diggory." An Auror that had hated Harry since the moment he became an Auror spoke. "Hand over your wand or wands immediately."
Draco laughed and wrapped his arms around his husband. "Take the job. We both know you miss fighting bad guys. Teddy and I will be here for when you come home for the night. You should take it."
"I could say the same thing," Harry pulled away, placing a kiss on his lips, "Now where's my godson?"
"Here's the thing. I am from here, but from 2053. I was a criminal for crimes I didn't commit. After that year, Draco, my husband, Teddy, my godson, and I hopped through the Veil, a portal between lands. We landed in 1970 in London. Then blah blah blah, saved the world a bit, had a son, the usual. Then out of nowhere this giant purple man uses these things called the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the universe, including Draco, Sirius, Teddy, and a bunch of my friends. After a couple years, I decide to undo what he did. So now I'm here."
Severus studied the bracelet. "Death is only one side of the story. You forget about the Life part. Two sides of a coin."
I was on a small hiatus the past two weeks which is why there were no updates. Sorry about that. We're back to our normal weekly updates now!
"In a way. When I left this earth it was 2053, I think. Then when I landed in the other earth it was 1970, and now I'm back here."
"Scorpius Leandro Potter. He's adorable. He has the same love for books that Draco did as a child. He loves hearing about them. About Draco and Sirius and Teddy. He knows they're gonna come back. He loves magic and the idea of it. He says he wants to teach magic when he's older. His favorite animal is a snake, which isn't surprising, seeing as we decorated his room with the four animals of Hogwarts. Severus, one of his godfathers, keeps telling him stories about when Draco was a kid, seeing as he's also Draco's godfather."
Hexes, jinxes and curses were thrown around the room, Teddy and Draco sticking together while Harry was on his own.
"I thought you said you could stop the bleeding."� Arthur worriedly said, though the anger was slowly seeping through.
Harry looked at his sons eyes and smiled. "Yeah, he does. And he has the iconic Malfoy blonde hair." Harry said, pointing out the small tuft of blonde hair on his head.
"Harry! You went all the way to another universe to get me a present?" Severus asked. When Harry nodded, he sighed, "You're an absolute idiot."
"You were all in on this?" Merlin asked, watching as Harry slowly put his sword away. "Then who won?"
"That may be why. Normal magic users' eyes don't turn pure gold like yours do. You're the most powerful. The only other person whose eyes turned gold is me. A couple years ago when I was fighting the Mad Titan."
"Hmm. And you're obviously not from here so there aren't many places to find information about this."
It was going pretty smoothly. The slowest part was extracting the venom, which was expected. There were charms that made it somewhat faster, but you couldn't use too many or it would just drain the persons magic.
"It's Sev's birthday," Harry shrugged, but then noticed the way Neville froze up, "Shit. Sorry, Nev. He's sorry, by the way. He told me he never meant to hurt anyone, especially you, it was just part of the act. He never thought he would ever see any of you guys again, so he just apologized to me."
"Oh. Sorry. My parents died when I was 4 and I went to live with my aunt and uncle. But my uncle died when I was 13."
Teddy ran up to Draco, interrupting his conversation with Severus. His hair was flashing between dark raven, platinum blonde and his normal blue.
Draco laughed and gently shoved Harry. "Liar. Scorpius, don't listen to your father. I'm much more put together than he thinks."
Tony had pulled up the footage from the nursery, skipped through the whole story then played the video right before Scorpius spoke. Draco swore he watched that video a million times.
Severus on the other hand just turned to Draco with an eyebrow raised. "You expect me to believe that you got Harry to agree to me being a godfather?"
"Up, General. Up! This is no place to die." T'Challa said to Okoye, reaching his arm out to her before he dusted.
"That's why? Because petty fights you had my dad? I'm not my father. I'm not my mother. Can't you get over it? You're the godfather of the man that I love and my mother's childhood best friend. I'm pretty sure Draco and my mom would want us to get along."
Merlin laughed, "I'm not actually Merlin, darling. This is a portrait that was made and spelled to have Merlin's memories. It just so happens that I know what is happening right now, and what will happen in the future."
Harry stood up and turned to the giant crowed of the Avengers. "His name is Scorpius Leandro Potter. Scorpius meaning scorpion and Leandro meaning lion."
Harry closed his eyes and focused on the magic around him. He could tell Pietro and Teddy were together in their room (since when did they share a room?). Tony, Pepper, Morgan, Wanda, Clint, Peter and Bruce were in the main common room. Rhodey, Sam, Bucky, Steve, Natasha and Carol were in the kitchen. The Guardians, Valkyrie, Thor, Loki, Scott and Hope were in one of the smaller common rooms just talking. Sirius, Severus and the Arthurians were in the Camelot Wing. That meant...
Before he realized, everything had gone quiet. They all watched as the new couple said their goodbyes. Based on the fact that Thanos was gone and they had no Time Stone, and only one ship with not enough fuel to get back to Earth, they were stuck there. Thanos had five of the six stones. There was no stopping him at that point. Chances were that Harry and Draco were going to die so even if Teddy survived the aftermath of Thanos, no one besides them two knew how to bring them back. It would be a lost cause.
"Yes. I apparently had the Potter vaults, Evans vaults, Gryffindor vaults and the Black vaults. Draco had your vaults, the Malfoy vaults, the Lestrange vaults and the other half of the Black vaults. It was a lot of money."
can't. I'm going to be sent to Azkaban for attempted murder if I stay. And Draco already stood up for me so he's gonna be hated for everything. We can't stay here."
Everyone collectively looked up and saw Tony standing there with Pepper and a baby girl in her arms.
"Yeah, we need to talk about that." Harry crossed his arms. "You shot my husband with the Killing Curse, Sirius!"
The trio made their way to the room, trying not to make a sound even though Draco cast a silencing charm on them the minute they entered the house.
"If a wizard had a Muggle soulmate, how would they know they were their soulmate? The Muggle obviously can't produce a Patronus."
"In legend, he dies six weeks after the Queen does. She had an affair with him during her marriage with Arthur.
Harry sent the cauldron and ingredients down to the basement before kissing Draco. He got up after pulling away.
"We have someone we'd like you to meet. He goes by many names, like Hadrian Black. But the one we all know him by... Harry Potter."
died. Snape died. So many people died. Teddy was taken in by his grandmother. Hermione and Ron finally admitted that they liked each other. Draco made the right choice in the end, fighting against the Death Eaters. Lucius Malfoy, his father, though, he's in Azkaban, or he was in Azkaban, I think he's dead now.
"I am! We don't know where it leads to, and no one wants to risk it to follow criminals. They used it as a Death Chamber for a reason! Is dying really worse than getting captured to a lifetime in Azkaban when you can't die?"
"Help! Please!" The man next to the blonde man in the middle called out once he saw them entering. This one had strawberry blonde, shoulder length hair.
"We'll bring them back Harry. I swear." Steve said before patting his shoulder light and walking away with Thor and Natasha in tow.
"Potter, let go of the boy," Hermione said, wand pointed at Harry. Hugo was behind her and so was the real Keodor Hewion, wearing some muddy looking robes.
Draco paused. No one had called him Malfoy since before he and Harry disappeared. Especially since Draco chose to take Harry's surname (not legally yet though, of course).
"I can't, Sev. All I think about when I see him laying here is seeing James' dead body at Godric's Hollow and how I chose revenge over staying with Harry. He was a baby and I left him."
"Everyone hold onto me. We're going to Apparate. It feels really gross, but don't worry. It's normal. Any technology shouldn't be affected, so you should all be fine."
"Hello, everyone. I'm Wanda, as you probably all know. Just here to announce that the gender reveal is going to happen in a couple minutes! Make your final guesses on the chalkboard over there and with name suggestions!" Wanda's voice was projected over the big ("It's not that big. We could've gone bigger." Tony had said) venue that was filled by family and friends. Her voice had been amplified due to the Sonorus charm Sirius had cast on her seconds before. There was a chalkboard leaning on one of the walls. It was split down the middle, pink on the right, indicating a girl, and blue on the left, indicating a boy. So far, the boys side had 11 votes and the girls had 13. Some of the boys names were Anthony, Jasper, Daegan, Galen, Killian and Elliot. Some of the girls names were Antionette, Saige, Kora, Rayna, Emilie, Aurelia and Blair. Draco really liked some of them, but he still had his top list at home.
"She was surprised of course, but took it well. She's not going to tell the others though. Sirius told Tony about Argo and he's in on our investigation now."
"Oh, I so agree." Draco commented, getting up and making his way around the bar the normal way. "And you're all lucky I know how to make a semi-decent Firewhiskey here."
Snape watched Teddy go back to his normal appearance, except deciding to go with purple hair now before drawling, "Yes, I suppose."
Strange was sitting cross-legged while floating and jerking around. His eyes were closed and the green stone was glowing. When his eyes finally opened he seemed to stumble down, but luckily Pietro ran over just in time to catch him.
"I'm only here for Harry and Ted. I could care less about Halloween. It's just an excuse for kids to dress up and go out to get tons of candy." He replied, taking a sip of some scotch he found.
Harry wanted to get back to training but everyone advised against it. That, of course, didn't stop him.
It took a bit of time but Snape managed to get all the HYDRA out. Bucky would still remember everything from his HYDRA days. It could give him PTSD but he could get over that with time and therapy. He was sure that his friend (or maybe more, Severus didn't know) would help him though it all. After all, one of the memories had them saying "til the end of the line".
When Merlin and Harry arrived at the field, Merlin summoned the dragon. Harry let himself be amazed for the nth time that day.
Draco turned back and looked at Harry, smiling softly, "I can't lose you either. So, as long as you're with me, I'm fine. As long as you have that bracelet, I'm always with you."
"He was one of Voldemort's most trusted. He knew him from school. Everyone assuming he died at the First Wizarding War."
"Yes?" Hermione Granger-Weasley said, pointing at one she knew to be Amerah Worogip, a writer for the Daily Prophet.
Harry gracefully (as graceful as one can me in jeans and a tee) left the great hall. He heard two sets of footsteps following him, then more.
The next couple hours were spent just going through the prophecy. They had most of the first half done but the second half was really getting them good. The part that helped them the most was the "look for the broken one and join all three to make a whole" part. The broken one was the bracelet, join all three was referring to the Hallows and putting them all together.
"Okay, Sirius, Severus, suit up. We're meeting at the QuinJet."� Teddy said, taking a sad glance at Harry before running back towards the Jet.
come back. But they'll only be a shell of what they used to be. It worked for me since by that point I was the Master of Death. At least I think that's why it worked for me." And then the Wand was in his hand. "This is, in my opinion, the most dangerous of all. The Elder Wand. I got this from disarming Draco, who disarmed Dumbledore, who got it from Gellert Gindelwald, another Dark Lord from the first Wizarding War. Apparently Dumbledore and Grindelwald were lovers? I dunno. This is nicknamed the Deathstick, and believe me, it's named that for a reason. It's what caused my spell against Andrew Creevey to be so powerful. It's the most powerful wand to exist in our world."
"Right, well, I should head back. I have a school to run," Teddy said, breaking the tension between the other two men.
"Great! Now that you two are done with your lovers quarrel, Merlin is over here still kinda dying!"� Teddy yelled. He had already tried all the healing spells he knew and nothing held for more than a couple minutes. "FRIDAY?"
The Sirius-look-a-like rose his hand, "A Nathair was used torture me. Percival got to me before I passed, but I assume there's some kind of effect that I don't know about."
"Harry. Go back like before that story. You have a Marauders tattoo?" Sirius asked, completely disregarding the story he just heard. He'd already heard it several times from his family and from James himself.
Snape was the only one following, the other three had already been in there so many times, they didn't need the full tour again.
"Severus, we both know that the Potters are one of the richest wizarding families. And he inherited the Black money from Sirius. Plus what he made as Head Auror."
Tony stood in front of Harry. "I'm sorry I couldn't protect him. I tried. I tried to keep him safe. He did amazingly."
"Oh, yes, the brothers who defied death. Those are very powerful objects, wizard. They can be used in the way you'd like them to. Once the sky is colored brightly, a man of grey shall usher forth the return of monsters and a world's doom. Once the balance shifts, a proposition shall cause a rise of a new god and a fall of friends. When the day comes that the sky is thick with water, a broken man shall bring the end of wealth and an era of sorrow. When the moment comes that the true one reveals himself, a suspicious death shall cause an era of harmony."
This time when they passed Harry's room, there was a kid in there. He didn't look older than 17. He had brunette hair and brown eyes. He looked out of place compared to the adults in the Compound. He seemed to be working on something seeing as he had books sprawled all over the floor and was taking notes on a notebook. He was whispering to himself. Arthur picked up a couple words, "Coma... bracelet... Mr. Stark... snap... powerful..."
His wand was out in front of him even though he knew he could do just as good without it. He walked towards the edge of their wards. He threw up more wards while being as discreet as he could.
A ship came down, almost crushing Peter in the process. A blue lady stepped out with knives in her hands and charged at Thanos.
"The one Harry got from the dragon. 'When the moment comes that the true one reveals himself, a suspicious death shall cause an era of harmony. The battle will shed blood, all but one will survive, his sacrifice the biggest of all'. Harry's going to die."
"Right. Well, thank you all. I appreciate the help. I should get going. I have to wrap this or something."
Arthur and Gwaine, who were with Draco, got to their feet and followed Draco while he led them to the medical wing.
Pietro, Wanda, Sam and Rhodey looked taken aback. Pietro and Wanda because they were new Avengers and had never seen this process before. Sam and Rhodey because they weren't there the first time they did this two years ago when Sirius accidentally killed Draco.
Arthur looked amused, as did Gwaine (who had burst out into laughter a long time ago), Elyan, Percival and Merlin. Guinevere, Lancelot and Leon just sat there and watched everything unravel, amused smiles on their faces.
Life with the Avengers was different than what Harry was used to. He was used to having to do everything himself. As a child, he did all the chores, all the cooking, everything by himself. Then as a teenager, the responsibilities to do things himself were smaller except the giant responsibility of killing Voldemort that was over his head everyday. Then when on the run, he only had to make sure they didn't get caught. And now, they didn't have to worry about that.
Teddy was the first to start clapping, followed by Draco, Hermione, Ron, George, Neville, Luna and everyone else. Harry got off stage. He smiled at everyone who looked at him and made his way back to his seat.
Harry sat and thought for a moment before he answered, "We obviously wouldn't have had this amazing family. In all honesty, life wouldn't have been the same. Without chasing wild villains and trying to get Tony, Sirius and Gwaine to stop drinking, it would just be boring. I think we both would've gotten bored of each other eventually and just give up. You, in a spur of the moment decision, would destroy your Horcrux and let yourself age so you could see your mother again. I… most likely would've left England. At least for a while. Get a new identity, after all, the Savior died during the ten year anniversary. Probably give myself the weirdest name like… Harper Torty and no one would suspect a thing. Maybe I would come back to England after a century or two. Hopefully when things are different. But, it's the Wizarding World for a reason, we live ancient times."
"You're a bloody idiot for making me love you because now I'll never be able to stop. Harry James Potter," Draco brought a box into sight and opened it, revealing the most beautiful ring. It had a silver band, but instead of a diamond like most engagement rings, it had a beautifully cut emerald in the middle, "Will you do me the honor of being my husband?"
"Harry," Tony called, catching his attention, "I think it might be time to, y’know, pull out the bracelet circlet thing."
The guard nodded but Harry released himself from the restraints, grabbed his wand and knocked everyone out with a simple spell he and Draco created a while ago.
"Remind me again, why are we harvesting basilisk parts?" Charlie asked, even though they never actually told him why.
"I think it's time you stopped underestimating me, Thanos." Harry said before he cast a single spell, "
After a couple minutes, Harry put a glamour on his face and the four of them went down to the second floor girls lavatory.
Tony figured out that the only way to not cause global extinction was to blow up the city. But they'd have to get everyone off the floating island first.
"Hmm. Keep an eye on the place. Make sure it doesn't happen again and see if anything changed from before. And test that blood, see who it belongs to."
Thor's eyes widened. "That is the symbol of Hela, the goddess of death. There were tales on Asgard of a man who could bend the laws of death at his will. He was called the Lord of the Deceased. The tale said that the man who held this power shall not be defeated by another. Only he shall lead himself to his own demise. The tale was always as such, just a tale. The symbol is known for the same reason. The line meaning power, the circle for lost love and the triangle for death."
"It was most likely Heimdall who told him. He is a Seer, he can see into the future." Thor explained.
"You're right! Your only friends are greasy slimy Slytherins like Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange!"
Sirius gasped. "That's what Loki told me. 'He's coming. The Mad Titan Thanos is looking for the Infinity Stones. Tell the Avengers'."
Harry was about to curse, but then he remembered his son was there. "Right… I'll figure something out." He said, already planning something out.
The new compound was ready which brought a problem with Peter Parker, or Spider-Man. Teddy went over to help him when he could but it was getting harder to do seeing as school had started mid-August. There was a winged man who was selling alien tech for a lot of money? Tony ended up taking away the kids suit after an incident on a ferry boat. Happy, Tony's bodyguard (and one of his closest friends) got calls from his friend Ned saying that Peter was going after the winged guy and that they needed to stop one of the jets going to the new compound. It ended with them having to go salvage what they could of a wreck and seeing the winged man all webbed up with a note from Spider-Man.
Everything in the nursery was either the green-gray, a muted maroon, black, white, silver or gold. The crib that was on the opposite wall of the Hogwarts mural had a black frame with muted maroon sheets and white pillows. Next to the crib was a white rocking chair with an olive green pillow. The dresser was black with a muted maroon changing station on top. Inside the closet (seeing as all his clothes were currently in the dresser) was a shelf filled with toys, there was also another one outside the closet which also contained some children's books. Along the walls were pictures of their family, both with the Avengers and without, and some other accents in gold. On top of the crib was a mobile which Sirius had made. There was a Hedwig, a broom, stars, a deer, wolf and a dog. There were flowers, specifically narcissus flowers and lillies. When Harry first saw the room he almost cried.
Harry was slightly confused but he nodded. He moved the bracelet slightly down his arm and showed the tattoo that was on his wrist.
A man with shaggy blonde-brown hair, scars on his face and worn out clothes entered. He reminded Harry of Remus Lupin.
Draco quickly cast a shield around Teddy and gave Harry a 'let him come over here and I'll protect him' look. Harry nodded and kissed Teddy's forehead before apparating to Draco with Teddy then apparating back alone.
He hadn't figured it out until one day on an Auror mission when he got hit with the Killing Curse, but didn't die. When he went to check where the Elder Wand was, he found it wasn't in Dumbledore's grave like it should've been. Then he realized he had it on him the whole time, wearing it as a bracelet. He had all the Hallows on him at all times. And he couldn't take the metal bracelet off. He should've realized it earlier but it never occurred to him that the bracelet he had been wearing the whole time, not able to take off, was holding the three Hallows.
Harry reached out and grabbed it, placing it on his head. He suddenly felt a rush of magic. It felt like he was coming home. But in a way which made everything else fade away. All he could feel was the magic, it's presence taking over everything else. It gave him memories of things that Harry never experienced. Memories of his family, of Severus and Lily as children, of Sirius getting yelled at by his mother while protecting Regulus, of Remus' first transformation, of Voldemort as a child, of the first Wizarding War, of a man named Newt Scamander, of the Salem Witch Trials, of the first game of Quidditch, of the Founders of Howgarts, of King Arthur being killed by Sir Mordred, of the Old Religion.
"Wow. This is amazing." He breathed, walking around the library and stopping when he saw a bunch of pictures. "Who's that?" He pointed towards a picture of a man who looked similar to Harry dancing with a beautiful redhead.
"Yes, it was, wasn't it? It was your idea after all. Does it include a picture or something of him?" Harry asked as he walked over to him, putting his hand on Draco's shoulder.
Draco hadn't bothered to dress up, all Harry did was throw on some old robes and called himself a student. Teddy changed his appearance to look more like his father, saying he was going as a werewolf. Sirius pulled on a leather jacket, jeans, white shirt and Doc Martens he borrowed from Draco (he hadn't had a chance to get his own clothes that didn't look like rags or clothes that are a hundred years old) and called it a day.
When Scorpius was fourteen months old, he said his first word. The Avengers were out on a mission in Chile after hearing reports that there was a HYDRA base there. Severus was in the nursery in the Compound with Scorpius just like he always in when they're on missions. Severus had been telling the baby about what Draco was like as a child when Scorpius said "papa". It didn't process in Severus' mind at first, but after a few seconds, he told FRIDAY to call Draco. He stood up and held Scorp in his arms while watching the video chat showed up on a hologram. It looked like the mission was over and they were on their way back.
"Luna Lovegood? She's a Seer?" Sirius asked. Draco nodded. "No wonder she was always a bit off. How is she?"
Harry and Draco had both gotten tattoos over the years. It was Draco's idea to find a spell to get tattoos, so they did. Harry's first tattoo was the Draco constellation, tattooed over his heart. Draco found it cheesy at first, but loved it so much. Draco got small narcissus flowers and lilies tattooed on his side, representing both their mothers. Harry also got a small Snitch tattooed behind his ear and the Deathly Hallows symbol on the wrist he has the bracelet. He also had a stag, a black mutt and a wolf tattooed on his hip bone for his past Patronus, his father, Sirius and Remus. They decided to get a matching tattoo. Of course, they had to pick a dragon after their Patronus. It's a small dragon that had their wedding date written by the tail. They have the dragon on their collarbones.
Arthur and Merlin, Harry and Draco, Steve and Bucky, Teddy and Pietro, Tony and Pepper, Natasha and Bruce, Sirius and Severus were matching because they were dating, or soon to be dating.
Once they were all on the Jet (albeit some hesitation from the newcomers) and they all knew each others names, Bruce told Gwaine to sit down so he could look him over.
Teddy nodded, "Okay, I'll go first. Draco, I think you were the first person to actually care about me besides my grandmother. You always came over to visit me with your mom. I loved all our talks, or mainly your talks since I couldn't really talk until later. You taught me so much in such a short amount of time. I remember when I was old enough to understand why my parents weren't there, I remember asking Gran if you could come over because I was sad. And you did come over. You helped me even though you had so many other things to worry about besides me. You would take me to your office because Gran was out and I didn't want to be alone. So, thank you. Even when you disappeared, I always knew I would have you by my side telling me that I would be fine, just like you said before. I love you so much. Um, Harry. You were probably the only person that could really talk to me about my dad. I had Gran to tell me about my mom but you always talked about Dad. I know you didn't have much time with him, but it was more than I had and I wanna say, thank you for sharing his adventures with me. I know you could never spend too much time with me because I reminded you of them, but you still tried your best and I really love that about you. I love you so much," He ended, wiping his tears on his sleeves.
Harry found he rather liked the Arthurians. He was especially fond of Percival. He didn't know why, he just reminded him of Cedric. They all reminded him of someone from his past. Guinevere reminded him of Ginny, Elyan of Ron, Lancelot of Neville, Leon of Remus, Gwaine of Fred and George, Arthur of Draco and Merlin of... himself. But when Merlin spoke of Morgana and Mordred, Mordred also reminded him of Draco and Morgana of Tom Riddle. It was something Harry didn't want to think of.
"It's fine. I'll get used to it. Maybe if I rake through my brain enough, I'll find something. For now, I'm fine just dealing with it."
It took Snape a bit of time to process what he had just watched, but then he responded, "I apologize."
"He was turning into a Dark Lord. We can't just let them go. Plus with the help of Malfoy, he was turning out to be just like You-Know-Who. We need to have him in a place where we can control them. Control both of them."
Merlin searched his brain for a spell that would wake him up. He knew spells, but he didn't know if they would work on other magical people. The only way to know was to try, right?
For him to bring everyone back, the first thing he needed to make some runes on the floor. After that, he needed to combine that Hallows to make who knows what.
Either way, Scorpius woke up and Draco saw his beautiful emerald green eyes. "Harry! He has your eyes." Draco exclaimed.
"Potter, George. He's Draco Potter. We're great. We have a son! I don’t know if you've read about him. Scorpius Leandro Potter. He'll turn five this year in our world. You would love him."
"Who cares about that? Why do they keep showing up? First it was them three, then it was Sirius and now this Severus guy?" Clint questioned.
Just like Harry said, there were ten thousand galleons, a stack of papers with information on the shareholding of Wheezes and the spare bit of parchment. The spell was what interested him the most, so he grabbed the parchment, along with some galleons and the stack of papers.
"What spell was it?" Harry asked, seeing multiple scratches that were oozing blood. He already knew the answer but wanted to make sure he was right.
"Right. That makes sense. If the Hallows are not housed in that bracelet anymore, but now in the circlet, the metal bracelet has no purpose. If anyone can just grab the circlet, anyone can Master the Hallows. But by shrinking it down to put it around his wrist again, it's only letting Harry access." Loki explained. "That shrunken circlet, is the new bracelet."
"Because while the infinity stones are of life, they were used for death. I have the Deathly Hallows which are of death. I think I can use them to bring everyone back but I don't know how. Merlin, you're the most powerful wizard, you should be able to help me."
"Sirius... you protected Regulus from your angry parents. He turned to the Dark, but in the end he always believed in the Light. He died trying to destroy the Horcruxes. Severus, you would protect your mother from your abusive father, even while you were only a child who was hurt. When he died, you felt relieved that your mother was finally safe from him. Teddy, everyone made fun of you at Hogwarts because of me and Draco. Your gran and others told you it was okay, it wasn't your fault, but you still felt you could've done something. Draco, your father told you you would be friends with me as a child. To try to lure me into the Dark side so Voldemort could kill me. Your mother, said you could be friends with me just to be friends. But I rejected your friendship, which made your father very mad. He would yell at you, he never hurt you, but you were always scared of him." Harry finally took a breath, his eyes closing. He collapsed in Draco's arms.
For a second, Harry thought he saw Snape's lips twitch upwards then he thought he was going crazy. "I will be back." Snape said before he stepped inside the trunk. From the inside, Snape saw some mountains of gold, silver and bronze. There were stacks of books with papers on the top, one for unread, one for read by Draco and one for personal. The smallest was the unread pile then the personal then the read by Draco.
Draco walked over to Merlin and lifted his head up a bit. He poured the potion down his throat and used a spell for him to swallow it.
Teddy shook his head with a smile on his face before making his way back to the Jet with Harry and Draco following him. On his way into the Jet, Harry patted Sirius on the back.
Harry laughed. It really sounded like he was going crazy. Maybe the prison had an effect that would make people go crazy, seeing as how there aren't any Dementors.
"I'm going to check it out." Tony said, grabbing one of his bracelets that would activate the Iron Man suit if needed.
When Scorpius was finally ready to go he did like his dad told him to and went over to the car. He saw his dad already over there and ran over.
When he arrived at the banquet, Draco Malfoy and Teddy Lupin were the only ones there. Harry walked up to them and looked at Teddy.
Once they arrived at the Lake of Avalon, Harry hopped off his broom and shoved it back into his trunk. He stood at the edge of the lake and just stared at it for a bit.
"My name is Draco Malfoy, but I'm assuming you all know that. My father, Lucius Malfoy, was a Death Eater. He was the Dark Lord's right-hand-man, some would say. It was my father that forced me into getting the Dark Mark. I didn't want it. But that didn't stop my father or the Dark Lord from giving it to me. I still have it as a constant reminder of my mistakes. And my fathers. The war with the Dark Lord is a constant reminder that there are people who want us gone. But we can't fight that. I get screamed at everyday. I know people want me gone. I understand that. Believe me, sometimes I want me gone too. But then I remember that instead of wanting to die, we should live. We should live so the lives we lost during the Battle don't go unforgotten. I remember that there are things worth living for. Like family. Friends. Partners. When my mother past away, I thought to myself that I deserved to die. I would say, 'I'd die if it meant my mother would come back'. But if I did that, she'd carry the guilt that I didn't want anymore. So instead, I've decided I'm going to live for Narcissa Malfoy. I think she'd like it better that way. I think all those who we lost would like it better like that. Don't wish it was you. Don't wish you could switch places with them. Instead, decided to live for them. It's really truly better that way," He looked up and blinked a couple times to get rid of the tears, "Okay, well. I'm not supposed to make this a sappy story that'll make you feel bad about me and my sad life. So, instead let's all bask in the happiness we've surrounded ourselves with in these past years. Some would say we survived the hard part, but that's wrong. The hard part is getting used to life without the people we lost. It's learning to be happy again. From what I know of a couple of you, you've done that. So, congratulations. We're still here. Let's celebrate that." Draco smiled awkwardly, clenching a fist by his side.
Harry gasped. "Dementors. Or the Dorocha. They suck the souls out of people, leaving only a shell of skin of a person left. They feed off of a person's happiness, bring fear and depression. Whenever they're around, everything gets cold. In the old days, the only known ways to scare them off is with fire or light, but now we know they can be destroyed with a Patronus."
And with that, the Cailleach left with the Dementors and the Veil vanished. The temperature went back to it's normal state.
"Your godfather can be a bloody idiot sometimes, did you know?" Draco asked as he rounded the coroner to get to the Veil room.
." Harry said, casting the spell as he did it and conjuring the strawberries and the rose that Merlin had created. He took one of the strawberries and ate it on his way out of the training room, leaving Merlin just staring at the door.
"And no child would be able to detect the sexual tension going on between you two," Teddy mumbled, but both of the men picked it up.
"The answer you seek is more obvious than you think. Look for the broken one and join all three to make a whole. Life and death, two sides of the same coin, one cannot survive without the other. The battle will shed blood, all but one will survive, his sacrifice the biggest of all."
"He's going to die eventually, Harry... We won't like it, but its going to happen. Maybe we can convince him to make a Horcrux, but I don't know."
She wrote down the needed information three times on three separate pieces of parchment. She started with Teddy.
The sudden aching feeling in Harry's chest made him stop moving. He could feel his godsons pain. Harry fell onto his knees and screamed, letting out a powerful burst of magic that knocked everyone around him out, both heroes and Thanos' men.
"I had just turned 16. My father made me get it. Since I didn't want it, it hurt so much. Even worse than the torture curse. When you consent it doesn't hurt as much, but you can still imagine the pain of getting a tattoo filled with dark magic."
Scorpius was actually a really quiet baby. He didn't fuss too much as long as you let him sleep and eat at the right times. He was almost always in someone's arms, mostly either Harry or Draco, but his godfathers also had a lot of time with him.
"Well, first of all, my name is Harry Potter. There is no Hadrian Black. Actually, Black is—was—is my godfather, Sirius Black. My parents are James and Lily Potter. Hogwarts is actually a school in Scotland for witchcraft and wizardry. I grew up in Surrey."
"Today is December seventeenth. On June third, six months from now, I will meet you on the same field you just fought those Dorocha. I'll allow Emrys, the Once and Future King, yourself and five others to join us. Any more than that, I will kill you on sight. Understood?" Mordred said after a bit of thought.
A couple seconds later, Severus, in a white button up shirt and some black jeans. It seemed to be the norm for Severus these days. In his arms was baby Scorpius dressed in an Iron Man onesie that Tony had bought for him along with onesies of the other Avengers. Somehow, it's as if Scorp knew, the Iron Man and the Captain America ones were his favorites.
"Hi, Teddy. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. Just hold on and we'll get you back to Harry and Draco and they can heal you. Okay? Just hold on for me." Pietro said, picking him up and running away from all the chaos. He thought he heard Strange telling Thanos to spare Tony's life in exchange for the stone.
*French translation: "I love you so much. Our baby will be perfectly fine. We have the team now. We have Snape, Sirius and Teddy. Our baby will be the most loved kid ever."
The bare conscious one opened his eyes. He looked towards the Avengers and spoke, "Harry Potter... He knows Harry Potter." He said while pointing at Teddy.
"You should have killed me." The blue lady said. It seemed like her and Thanos knew each other based on the way they were speaking.
Unbeknownst to her, in another world, two men felt magic coursing through them. The magic of a marriage bond, and it felt bloody amazing.
"My idea. Brilliant, isn't it? The Aurors really should've thought to look for distinct marks like tattoos."
to check the time, "It's dinner time. Everyone should be in the Great Hall, so I don't think you should need the Cloak."
"Wow." Someone said, making Harry whip around and relax only when he saw Merlin. "I've never seen someone destroy a wall like that."
Draco thought for a second. "Yes to our people. But I don't know if I want to tell the Avengers yet. Plus there's those new guys that will probably pass out once they hear me, a guy, is pregnant."
"We have it. The Malfoy's were considered one of the richest families in all of Wizarding Britain. Our money isn't pounds or dollars like here. There're knuts, sickles and galleons. Knuts are copper coins. Sickles are silver coins and galleons are gold coins. 29 knuts equals one sickle. 17 sickles equals one galleon. Just one galleon equals to around 25 dollars. In my first vault, the one I got when I was eleven, I had around 50,625 galleons, which is $1,265,625. That's only the money my parents left me for school. I also inherited the other family vaults once I was 17, the Black vaults considering Sirius didn't have an heir and he named me as the one to get most of his money, leaving some for Remus. We don't even need to go into specifics about Draco's money, but he had a lot more of it. He got the Malfoy vaults, the other side of the Black vaults and the Lestrange vaults thanks to his Aunt Bellatrix not having any kids."
"You being my uncle, Harry's godfather and Teddy's dad's ex is kinda weird, you do know that right."
After Scorp was six months old, Harry finally let him go on missions with the Avengers, leaving the baby with Severus seeing as he never wanted to go out to fight.
It felt weird. After being in a coma for a while, you wake up and suddenly realize everything changed, but at the same time, nothing changed.
The sixth month of Draco's pregnancy was mostly filled with Harry (and occasionally Tony) worrying all over him. Apparently something called Braxton-Hicks contractions were starting which was a way of the body preparing for labor. These contractions caused Draco to be in pain sometimes which is what worried Harry, which worried Draco. Tony insisted they were normal but Draco wished Bruce were there to actually help him. There were no other doctors that knew about the Potters, and what they could do, besides Bruce. Draco just hoped that wherever Bruce was, that he was fine.
Then suddenly all the Avengers were going, all suited up, or in Stark's case, ready to suit up if needed.
Steven Rogers, or Steve Rogers was a war hero who died in the 1940s in a plane crash. He had been engaged to Margaret Carter, but she moved on after years. Anthony Stark, or Tony Stark, was the heir to a gigantic company owned by his father Howard Stark. She had heard people praising the old Stark Industries when she went to the Muggle world. Stark had died in 2008 in Afghanistan after being kidnapped and tourtured for three months. The company was now owned by Obadiah Stane and his assistant Virginia Potts. Mostly everyone that spoke of Stark Industries said they missed the old era of either Howard or Tony Stark.
Harry looked down at his wrist where the bracelet was. "I suppose." He said, enlarging it back to it's normal size and placing it on his head, like it had been the day he brought everyone back.
The woman stepped forward and smiled at him. "Hello, Scorpius. I'm Guinevere, but you can call me Gwen."
Time after the Snap passed quickly. Scorpius grew up quickly. When he started showing his accidental magic, Harry had been so happy for the first time in forever. He went to call Draco but then realized that he wasn't there. The remaining Potters didn't stay at the compound for much time. After the Snap, they went back to their house to try to stay away from all that.
"Sirius." Teddy whispered. He had crouched down next to Harry, he picked up Harry's wrist with the bracelet on it. The crack in it that once only reached to the middle, was now completely broken. Teddy gingerly took the two ends apart and took the bracelet off his wrist.
"Do what?" Harry asked while offering a hand out to Baton to get him back up, which he declined and got up by himself.
Harry pounded against the glass wall, pulling on his magic to get him out of the cell. "I need to get to Draco. Someone just broke into my house and killed my husband. Let me out!" He yelled.
Some new (or old, depending on how you want to look at it) friends. A bit of angst. Love confessions. A bit of fluff. Family reunions.
Harry laughed. "We always snuck it into our dorms at Hogwarts during 4th year between the Tasks. Ronald would get the twins to sneak it in and the fourth year Gryffindor boys would be having a party. Fred and George would join in, of course. Thankfully, they cancelled Quidditch that year or Oliver Wood would've kicked my ass into the next day if he were there."
"Really? She asked me like two weeks ago. Maybe she knows you have experience writing essays twenty minutes before you have to turn it in." Draco smiled.
"Yeah. I'm sorry about kinda killing him when I first showed up. I saw the silver hair and my first reaction was Lucius Malfoy and I shot the killing curse at him. I'm so sorry."
Then his eyebrows furrowed. "How do you know all this, Potter? Did you somehow get Draco to find all these replacements?"
"So that's it? He kills your husband and now we're fine with him?" Stark asked, earning an elbow jab from Rogers.
People were screaming. Wands were out, all pointed at the man with the gun, Andrew Creevey, father of Colin and Dennis Creevey. Harry pulled his wand out, ready to cast spells to detain him when Draco fell limply on Harry's body. Draco had been shot.
"Before I defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort, I had to die because I had a piece of Voldemort's soul in my body and the only way for him to actually die, all his soul pieces needed to be destroyed. I used the Resurrection Stone to come back but by using it, I became it's master. It's one of the Deathly Hallows. I had the wand since I disarmed Draco who disarmed Dumbledore, the school headmaster, who was also it's previous owner. I got the cloak after my first semester at Hogwarts. Dumbledore sent it to me for Christmas, my dad had left it to me. I became the Master of Death, meaning I can't die."
"Hello, Mr. Hewion. I hope you're doing well," She smiled the smile he knew she had reserved for professors at Hogwarts.
Scorpius looked around from his room in the Avengers compound. He was now five years old and spent a lot of his time reading. Severus was in the room next door to his but he didn't want to go talk to him. He would've liked to talk to his dad but he always seemed either sad or was busy working recently. The time he did spent with his dad, it was full of laughter for a bit before his dad started crying and left the room spewing apologies and saying that someone was going to come into his room to spent time with him. So, Scorpius left the room and walked mindlessly around the compound. He came across a room full of books. It didn't look like a library, seeing as there were vials filled with multicolored liquids.
The first time he realized it was broken was right after the snap. It didn't break anymore up until the moment he started caring about his life again. After that, it didn't move until he got to Camelot. He noticed it while he was using magic on himself to change his clothes. But now, he just wanted to know. Did Death want him as its master still? Was he terrible at everything? Or was it just because of the imbalance between life and death?
Draco scoffed, "So, now you're a monarch in their eyes. Just because someone is the Master of Death, doesn't mean they have all the power in the world."
When everyone had their items, Hermione pulled out the letter that was at the top of everything that was addressed to all of them.
Once he finished, he stood up and pulled out two Energy Replenishing Potions. He drank one himself and gave the other to Barnes.
"I killed Voldemort. Most Death Eaters are now in Azkaban. Bellatrix was killed by Molly after she tried to kill Ginerva. Lucius is gonna rot in there until he dies, unless he already died."
"Well, I can't call you by your real name considering were out in public and anyone can recognize your name and turn you into the Ministry, since now everyone knows we're still alive."
A couple seconds later, Draco's eyes shot open while gasping for air. "Fuck. I forgot how terrible that feels."
"He's giving off strong Draco 'my father will hear about this' Malfoy vibes right now, but no. I do not know who you are." Draco contemplated telling Sirius that he was now Draco
"Clint, who's that you've got there?" Romanoff asked, clearly (or at least clear to Harry) going defensive since it was obvious she didn't know this man personally, of course. She had stalked him a while ago. Harry figured it out when the wards notified him that the same two people were coming to the house for about a week. He had used his Invisibility Cloak to see who it was.
"Well. I lived in a place called the Wizarding World. It's truly amazing. Brooms that fly higher than anything you've ever seen. Animals that can talk to certain people. Toys that speak on their own. The clothes were horrifying. Portraits that are alive and speak. Pictures that move. Ghosts that help wherever they can. Owls that deliver packages. Goblins that manage money. Fireplaces that can transport you. Dragons and merfolk that will most likely kill you if not treated correctly. Wanda that harness your power. Potions that could put a stopper on death. Schools to learn how to correctly use magic.
"Okay! Can everyone be quiet? We don't know the gender, we have like a month and a half before we find out the gender. Yes, Peter, where we're from, guys can get pregnant. It's rare and only happens if both males are powerful enough. No, Tony, we're not naming them Anthony. We have a couple name options for girls and boys, but we don't have an actual name yet. The due date is November 6th. Nat, we love you, but no you can't teach them to hold a knife until they're at least 10 years old. We haven't asked them yet, but we want to ask Severus, Teddy and Sirius to be the godfathers." Harry said quickly. "Any other questions?"
"Harry, it's fine. We didn't know you could even come visit us. They don't need to know if you don't want them to," George said.
Natasha said their names were Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian. They apparently had run into them during their mission earlier that day.
"Why don't we just go inside to show you your room and our spell making slash potion making room?" Harry suggested.
" Harry said and watched as a small, blue wispy dragon was summoned from the top of his wand. At first, when he first noticed his Patronus had changed, he was sad about it, about losing the stag that represented his father. But now, he realizes that he moved to a different chapter in his life, one with Draco and was happy that it had changed, knowing his father would be proud of him for finding his love.
Harry smiled, as if he knew Snape would want to see it. He pulled out his wand and whispered the incantation before a wispy dragon appeared before them.
Draco, unlike Harry, was spending most of his time with Scorpius. He was teaching him small bouts of magic to play around with just for fun. He taught him spells like
"We'll try and do something. Maybe Mr. Hewion can send more Aurors to Hogwarts to make sure Potter or Malfoy or anyone else doesn't attack," Weasley shrugged.
"It's okay Teddy, it was long in the past. I can't say I don't miss her, but she's waiting for us somewhere. We'll meet her sooner or later." He smiled weakly.
"Sounds intriguing. But... it sounds like the Dreamless Sleep potion. You try it once, it's nice and amazing. But then you want more and more and more. You get addicted. It's not easy getting over an addiction."
The Ministry was still after Draco and Harry. Draco and Harry had established that they both liked each other and had been dating for a year and a half. They moved location every week. The Ministry had no idea where they were, but once they had an idea, Draco and Harry were gone the next day. The Ministry had even gotten the American Ministry of Magic to help them, even though they were never near America. They stayed in Europe, though never in the same city.
Teddy Lupin was ten years old and growing up with his grandmother instead of his parents. He knew what his parents died for, but he missed them everyday. Harry, being Teddy's godfather, visited whenever he could but never stayed for too long as he was reminded of Remus and Tonks and how he couldn't help them. Teddy asked for stories of his parents, Harry would try his best without crying but always ended up with tears down his cheeks.
So, when Hugo Granger-Weasley, along with the other Aurors and Hermione Granger arrived, all they saw was a clearing in a forest with no memory of the men that lived there for a week.
As if right on cue, Draco walked in, out of his usual after-work sweats and in a black tux, white dress shirt and emerald green tie. "Hi, love. There's a gala that Stark invited us to. Teddy's getting ready, the Avengers left to also get ready. So, hurry up. Black, I guess you can come too. I'm assuming you don't have a suit with you, so, come with me."
"Because I grew up with Severus as a godfather," Draco pressed a quick kiss to Harry's lips before standing back up, "Now finish your potion before it explodes in your face and I have to clean you up again."
Harry knocked on the door and waited for the "Come in" heard from inside before entering. He smiled again before sitting down in front of Hermione.
Clint started piloting the ship and quickly made his way into the air. He was trying to make the flight faster than the original trip to get Merlin to Draco.
"May I see this Deathly Hallow tattoo that you have?" Thor asked. He had a suspicion about it, that it might be something that he was thinking of but he had to be sure.
"Yeah, a couple actually. We got bored a lot while over here. I can show you our spell making and potion room at our house if you'd like."
"How can I not think about it, Harry?" Draco whispered back, ignoring the looks from everyone else. Instead of waiting for an answer, he turned to Natasha, "Truth or dare?"
Merlin told Harry to follow him and they went into Morgana's old chambers. They had been well kept by the servants of the castle.
First thing Harry saw when he landed was Loki. He did it right! Loki was waiting for him. Or... maybe Loki was just checking the portal to make sure Harry didn't show up and get stuck on an alien planet.
"Can you tell me more about the legends?" Merlin asked once they were in the safety of the chambers.
That was the last question she took that day. She made her way down to the Chamber of Death, where the Veil of Death stood. There was a group of Unspeakables working to see if they could somehow find out where the trio ended up.
The more she read, the more intrigued she became. None of the other books about Merlin's life had things like him being King Arthur's manservant or having spent days in the stocks because he was an idiot.
"Also, have you seen a green skull with a snake coming out the mouth in the sky?" Sirius asked. "It's how Death Eaters knew where and when to meet up.
FRIDAY had told them that Teddy, Pietro, Tony, Peter and an unknown man were on an unidentified alien ship and that there was a man in the compound waiting for them. Harry showed up first in his black dragonhide armor and Elder Wand in his hand at the ready. His fighting stance was quickly dropped as soon as he saw who it was. "Oh my god, Bruce!" Harry instantly went over to hug him.
Harry held Teddy for a while but let go before it would get too long and too suspicious. He turned to Draco, "Where's Andromeda?"
At first, for Harry, she just tried the Lord title. When it didn't work, she remembered something he had told her a long time ago.
Then the footage faded out. Scorpius wiped his tears before he stood up and walked to Pietro's room.
The Potters made their way over quickly. Sirius took Teddy from Pietro and laid him down on a couch.
" Lightning was surrounding him and his eyes were glowing. He jumped up and crashed down into the floor, forming a large crater and knocking out more of the creatures.
"I was going to say that Sirius was excellent in charms and transfiguration, so he could help there. As for the wand, we don't know yet. I could give them my Holly wand, if it works for them. Other than that, I think we might have a book on wand making and could possibly make one, but that's way in the future. When they're eleven, they can get their wand, like the rest of us did."
There was another battle, the heroes seemed to be losing against the Mad Titan, even though they were nine against just one.
As a spur of the moment decision, Harry turned to George, "I'll meet you at the Veil in an hour. I have to do something first."
Harry searched his brain, trying to find out why that happened and later found out that Hermione ordered the marriage contract which had put into place the bond once it was accepted by the magic.
"Come in." He called. The squire opened the door and only walking in a couple paces before speaking.
"Actually there have been cases of people having the same animal but they each have their own soulmate. Um, in Poland in 1638, there was a reported case of this couple who had found another person with the same Patronus but they had nothing to do with them. They even did an inheritance test, only the couple were soulmates, the other person had their own soulmate in the world, I think it ended up being a Muggle." Harry said.
"That's true, pup." Sirius butted in, resting his arm on Teddy's shoulder then having Teddy shove his arm off playfully. Snape rolled his eyes at Sirius but he saw that and then they started were arguing.
Harry spent whatever time he could with Merlin. Merlin had noticed his new sensory overload and offered to help him with it. Peter also wanted to help, seeing as he went through the same thing years before.
"He's a prat. But he's the most loyal and talented man I've ever met. He stands up for what he believes in and calls me out when I do something incredibly dumb. We ran away together, literally, when we were 27. It was one of the best decisions ever. Granted, we were running so we wouldn't be arrested. But, I'm glad we did it together. His hair is so blonde you'd think he bleaches it, but no. His hair just that platinum. And his eyes are the most gorgeous shade of gray. They remind me of a storm. He's a doctor—er, physician. He helps people. Doctor Potter. He was named after the Draco constellation. The dragon. It's fitting, really."
Weasley nodded reluctantly, before turning to Draco. He frowned upon seeing the communicator still in his ear, "What's that?" He pointed at the comm.
the Master of the Wand. But since Snape was the one to kill Dumbledore, Voldemort believed that while Snape was alive, he could never use the wand to its full potential, so he killed Snape. Then after Dumbledore died, in his Will, it included that I get the Snitch I caught in my first quidditch match. Engraved it said, 'I open at the close'. So when I went to face Voldemort, it finally opened and I got the Resurrection Stone. So, I became the Master of Death." Harry explained, mainly to Thor, but also to anyone else who listened.
He told them that the Ministry was watching Hogwarts with Dolores Umbridge, the worst Defense professor and Headmistress (though for a short time) Hogwarts has ever seen. He told them about Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix. He also included the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the death of his godfather.
Banner nodded and passed him the vial. Harry opened it and put three of the flowers inside the cauldron.
Steve, Natasha, T'Challa and Harry walked to the edge of the shield (Harry more like apparated there to somewhat scare the two who looked like were the leaders).
"You should have seen Harry when Draco had been... killed. He was so madly in love with his husband, he didn't know how to function without him. For two years, he had to rework his life because some idiot screwed everything up. Draco was dead, for lack of a better word, and Harry still spoke so highly of him, you would think he worshiped him." Merlin said, voice getting more serious and threatening as he spoke, "You may have turned your back against Harry all those years ago, but Draco never did. He stood by him. Through heaven and hell. They lost a child because of an order your predecesor put out. Aurors killed their daughter. Draco was so torn up about it, he shut down. Losing a loved one is one thing, losing a child before even having met them, is the end of the world."
Harry faked a smile before making his way over to Draco and dragging him to the pool tables, catching the attention of Sirius and Teddy. "They're here." He whispered.
The three adults went quiet before Severus spoke up, "We don't know, Scorp. We hope sometime soon, but we don't know."
It resulted in Harry having to use the spell he used to knock out everyone before jumping though the Veil. All of them fell to the ground, some, like Steve, didn't pass out just they were immobilized because Draco also used
Hermione looked perplexed, "Mr. Hewion, I hope you do realize that Mr. Potter is on charges for three murders and Mr. Malfoy for harboring a fugitive. These men cannot just be let go. No matter how much I loved Harry in the past, he's a murderer and I can't let him roam free for any longer."
"Well, maybe if you weren't working with Voldemort your whole life you would know more healing spells!"
"No. I'm not leaving you to die. You left you for 45 years. I can't lose you again," Teddy frowned, walking over to him but stopping because of his shield.
"Yes, well the rest of your companions don't, so shush." He turned to Merlin and made his way around the group, "Meet Arthur Killian Pendragon, Merlin Emrys Wilde, Leon Nicholas Young, Guinevere Adriana and Elyan Conan Thomas, Lancelot Dace Lane, Percival Trace Morris, and Gwaine Owen Andrews. Congratulations, you're officially citizens of New York, thanks to moi. You need to get IDs and most likely a drivers license, but that can wait for now." Tony said, before he sat down and watched the Arthurians quickly look through the package.
"See, those are the questions you should be asking! Good job, Mr Stark. I am a wizard, as are my husband and my godson."
"What a Horcrux normally does, is it brings out the worst in people. Like during our hunt for them, we had the locket with us since we didn't know how o destroy it. Whoever wore it was always so mean and saying everything on their mind. It's what caused Ron to leave us for a while. It causes everyone's mood to worsen. The Horcrux I had gave me the ability of Parseltongue. It means I can speak to snakes and most reptiles. It was supposed to disappear after the Horcrux was destroyed, but it didn't. Tom Riddle is a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, who is one of the most known Parselmouths. So when I started to speak to a snake in second year, they thought I was the Heir of Slytherin, the one behind the petrifactions. It made everyone think I was just like Tom because of how I looked like him, I don't see it though."
"Since you are really good with mind stuff, do you think you can help Bucky get that HYDRA stuff out of his brain?"
"I love him. I didn't realize it until we were alone together on the run but I think I've always loved him."
Here are some songs that I was listening to while writing this, feel free to listen if you want (right click to open in new tab):
"Draco is a very forgiving man. I cannot say much, but he forgives even those who tried to kill him. He forgave an old friend of mine who thought it was his responsibility to kill another."
When Harry opened his eyes, he realized that the curtains were open and that there was a clean set of clothes on the side of his bed.
He could do things on his own, but that didn't stop Draco from treating him like glass. One day he just snapped and yelled that he was fine when everyone kept looking back at him. It stopped after that day.
Harry laughed and pulled away from the hug to look at his husband. He put his hands on Draco's stomach. "It's our baby we're talking about. Speaking of which, how far along are you?"
"He's gonna be such a heartthrob in the future." Scott said softly, but everyone heard it and started laughing.
"Sure... Whatever you say..." Tony walked away, talking to a smart watch he had on his wrist, "FRIDAY, make the walls a baby green, but a nice green, and order lion, eagle, snake and badger toys. Max of five each. Put them in the playroom."
And just like that, Harry walked out into the common room. He leaning on Draco for support, but mostly he was able to walk by himself.
Barton made a grunt as if saying 'follow me' and headed back down the way he came. Harry followed closely behind.
Then Natasha came out, Pietro's arm around her shoulders. He wasn't hurt physically, but mentally he couldn't get the sight of his love dying in his arms. Harry went up to Pietro and hugged him. Pietro started sobbing into Harry's shoulder.
No more was the scrawny, abused, lonely child that first arrived on the train to Hogwarts. Now, there was a man who had lived through too much, but in the end, always survived, though always scarred.
Harry walked into Scorpius' room and sat down in the chair across from his bed. Scorpius was asleep with a toy dragon that Tony had bought him all those years ago. His son was five and a half years old and Harry barely spent any time with him.
It took everything Draco had to not stop and hex her but he kept walking and made it to the elevator.
Harry laughed and helped Teddy tie his tie. Teddy, seeing as he was Headmaster (who didn't wear sparkly robes like Dumbledore) and is a principal, he knew how to get ready, tie ties, make bowties, but he missed out on having those perks with a father, uncle, cousin, godfather or whoever. So, now whenever he can, he lets Harry or Draco help him out to make him happy.
"What? You wanted me to yell, 'Harry, dear, your friends son is attacking me'?! Even if I did tell you, who knows if they would've hit me or not! And why are they even using that spell?"
"If you have any clue or any ideas on how to wake him, let us know. We don't want to lose Harry. He's family." Tony finished.
Harry kneeled down to talk to Scorpius, telling him that he had to stay with Aunt Pepper for a bit while the grown ups talked.
Hermione was processing. First, Draco, Harry, Teddy, Sirius and Severus were still alive. Second, Draco Malfoy actually loved Harry. Third, time travel worked weirdly. Fourth, the portrait of Merlin knows basically everything about Merlin's life, if it's passed or not.
Harry nodded and chopped up some more, slowly adding, mixing and seeing if the color changed before adding more if needed. "I dunno. I like my job but maybe this could be what's missing from it. He said I'd go on cases outside of New York occasionally, so I dunno. It might be too much time away from you and Ted. From being an Auror all those years ago, I wasn't able to see Granger, the Weasleys and Teddy that much. I just don't know if I wanna risk doing that again."
"I think there might be a bigger threat coming. He thinks there are more wizards out there that are out for revenge."
"Drink this. It'll get your energy up as Legilimency takes a lot out of a person." He told Barnes. Once he watched Barnes take it, he turned to Steve, "He's going to remember everything. It'll hurt him mentally. He will most likely need to go to therapy and need to talk to someone about everything without being judged. He needs to accept that fact that it wasn't him doing these things, it was HYDRA before he can move on."
The dinner went perfectly. They all conversed normally and calmly. No one was left out of a conversation. Tony even toasted to the "happy couple and their baby". The giant family was happy and Harry was loving it.
"He's beautiful, Harry. James, Lily and Remus would be so proud of you and your pup. Now, come on, let's go get him cleaned up and in a new blanket." Sirius said smiling widely. He turned to Pietro, "Could you go grab a blanket, a small towel and a diaper from his nursery, Pietro?"
"But then there's the other side. Witches and wizards who use magic for evil. Wizards that believe non pure blooded magic users should not exist. Dark Lord's that kill parents and infants. Dark Lord's that leave marks on children. People stereotyping a kind of people. Blood purists not knowing when to stop. Spells that can kill with two words. Ghosts possessing professors. Souls possessing little girls and hiding giant snakes. Hiding your true self in someone else's skin. Government officials using blood magic on students. Dark Lord's controlling 16 year old boys. Crazed maniacs killing innocent creatures."
"Oh, for fuck sake," Sam groaned, "Can you just both admit that you wanna kiss each other's brains out, because it's getting really annoying for the rest of us. Why aren't you even talking anyway? All Severus did was confess his love for Sirius and now they aren't talking!"
Harry stood by the core and ripped apart any bots that he saw that were approaching either the core, an Avenger or a citizen. Draco and Sirius were helping people on the ships and getting them to safety, occasionally using a floating charm to get them there faster.
"He said, 'He's coming. The Mad Titan Thanos is looking for the Infinity Stones. Tell the Avengers'."
"Sweetie, we have to wait for them to be weak. With Hermione as Minister, they're never gonna be weak unless she and Ron have another child which is pretty doubtful considering they're 71 years old. We just have to wait until she retires. It'll be fine. We'll be fine."
Teddy watched as a green lady, presumably Gamora, was fighting Thanos while he dragged her over to a cliff. He watched as the Titan threw Gamora over the edge and heard her scream, "
Around May 24th was the first time Draco felt the baby kick. It was around 1:35 AM and he was woken up by his kicking baby. He shook Harry awake and told him to put his hand on his belly. Harry, having just woken up, was confused at first then he realized what was going on. When he felt the baby kick, he almost started sobbing.
"His name is Edward Lupin, but they call him Teddy. His parents died a month after he was born from an accident. He went to live with his grandmother but she died when he was about to graduate from the boarding school. So Officer Potter, being his godfather, adopted him. Draco Potter was his cousin and him being married to Officer Potter, also made him sort of his dad? It doesn't really make sense but from watching them, Mr. Lupin still refers to the Potters by their first names," Barton explained.
There had been no new advances with the Death Eater case which made Draco on edge. Harry, Teddy and Sirius were calmer about it but Draco was a different story. He believed that every time he walked into their house (no matter how many wards were in place) there would be one of those Death Eaters there waiting for him.
All the memories were dark. There were memories of an electrocution chair. People speaking Russian. Assassinations. Screams. Begging. A lot of torturing, both him to others and HYDRA to him. A couple of memories with Steve but they were mainly the memories of HYDRA.
Snape looked at Harry with confusion written all over his face, something that was a rarity to see. He flipped through the pages and saw Harry's (slightly better now) chicken scratch in margins. There were arrows and small diagrams drawn. On the page with the Sectumsempra curse, the "For enemies" had a note next to it, "not for petty school bathroom fights". He chuckled slightly at that.
"I was one year old when my parents died. I was one year old when I had to live with the Dursley's and do everything for them."
He looked at his wrist and saw the circlet that had been shrunken. He looked at it oddly. He focused on pulling out the Invisibility Cloak, not noticing that his eyes went gold when the Cloak showed up. He had half expected it not to work. He focused on putting it back and it went away. That was gonna take time to get used to.
By the time he reached the stables, he watched as the Knights got on their respective horses. He pulled the trunk from his neck and enlarged it. He didn't notice everyone watching him step into the trunk just to pull out a broom. He shrunk it down again and put it back around his neck.
"Year six. The more Draco oriented year. Basically Draco's father, the Dark Lord's right hand man, forced Draco to join the Death Eaters, which are the bad guys. He was told to kill Albus Dumbledore, our headmaster. Snape was now our Defense teacher and Horace Slughorn was our potions teacher. I found a potions book, the Half-Blood Prince's book. I excelled at potions that year because of the book. Draco kept hexing students discreetly as a part of his plan to get to Dumbledore. Then the end of the year, Dumbledore told me about Horcruxes. That's what was keeping Voldy alive. A Horcrux is a part of our soul that is placed in an object that will grant you immortality until the Horcrux is destroyed. Me and Dumbledore went on a mission to find the third Horcrux. The first was the diary that was controlling Ginny in second year. I destroyed it without knowing what it was. The second was a ring that Dumbledore and Snape destroyed. The one we went to find was a fake placed by Regulus Black, Sirius' younger brother who was once a follower of Voldemort who switched sides and was looking for the Horcuxes. I'm pretty sure he died trying to find them. Dumbledore died at the hand of Snape. Only because Draco couldn't do it and Narcissa, Draco's mother, may she rest in peace, and Snape made an Unbreakable Vow, which is exactly what it sounds like, to protect Draco. Oh! And Snape was the Half-Blood Prince who was also in love with my mother.
Teddy from a far, saw this and used all his magic to put up a shield in front of Pietro, Clint and the little boy. Sure, Teddy could put up shields easily, but from when he was a mile or two away, it just wasn't as easy. His metamorphous glamour slowly died away. His real brown hair and brown eyes were flashing occasionally. He apparated to the sight and held up his shield for as long as he could. Teddy, unlike Draco, Harry and Sirius, wasn't as trained with wars as they were. He was only a month old when the Second Wizarding War ended and there hadn't been one since. He focused on his studies and his school more than learning more defenses than necessary.
"Dragon, huh?" He turned to the other blonde, "Pietro, bring me basilisk venom, basilisk scales, a cauldron and yew leaves from my workshop. Also, turn the temperature down to 65 degrees fahrenheit."
"I love you both too much to leave you again. I'm always gonna be here for you. Both of you. Whether you like it or not."
So, Merlin started explaining, "Your Veil of Death is what is to believed to be the High Priestesses greatest achievement. It not only would work as a method of death, it would work as a portal to other worlds. This was created long before my or the Lady Morgana's time. With the right runes, you could not only control the time and place it would land you, you could also control if the magical signature was shown. The High Priestesses would take their prisoners to the Veil and made them land somewhere where they would die, whether it be flames, in the front line of fire or whatever they could come up with."
Harry hummed, still stirring his cauldron. "Okay. But now I have to wait for the Nick Fury guy to call me."
"My name is Harry Potter. I am from the future... in a way. I was born on his Earth in Suffolk. But after a tragic event," Harry rolled his eyes, "I had to leave this Earth and I landed in a different one. But now I need help from the Wizarding World but instead of landing in the 2000, I landed here. The other Earth, the one I now consider home, well, the universe, was put in danger by a Mad Titan. Because of him, half the universe is gone. He used these objects called Infinity Stones which are part of what created that universe. He used an object of life for death. And I have these objects," Harry said as he summoned the Elder Wand, Invisibility Cloak and the Resurrection Stone, "These objects of death. The Deathly Hallows. I need to bring everyone back but I don't know how to do that."
"Wait, hold on. What's a Death Eater again? Who's the Board? Who the hell is Theodore Nott? Who's Moody slash Barty Crouch Jr? Who's Longbottom? Who's McGonagall? Who's the twin left? Who's the she-weasel? And why is she devastated over her childhood crushes death?" Barton asked.
"Well, I just wanted to ask if you had heard about the most recent Potter-Malfoy sighting. And by most recent, I mean the one from a year ago."
Harry looked down at his dragonhide armor. He sighed thinking about what the Avengers were about to do. They had to go travel to where Thanos and his army were located, to be in proximity with the infinity stones. When Thanos snapped, Harry was only a couple feet in front of him, meaning the Stones and the Hallows were essentially right next to each other. Now, to undo it, they had to be next to each other again.
At that, Teddy pouted and crossed his arms over his chest, "I'm not a child! I'm a big boy who's going to Hogwarts next year!"
"I'd like you to work for me. We can ignore the blood thing for now, as long as you work for me. You'd work as an Agent, working closely with some of my most trusted."
Everyone made their way back to the compound. Draco was uncharacteristically quiet on the long way back, he only sat next to Harry and took a nap on his shoulder. Teddy and Pietro were whispering about something, Harry couldn't really pick up what it was. Sirius and Snape were seated across from each other just glaring at each other. Occasionally, Sirius would kick Snape and Snape would kick back. Bucky sat next to Steve and across from Sam, who was glaring at him. Next to Sam was Natasha, on the other side of her was Clint. On the other side of Sam was Scott. Peter was sitting next to Tony, just rocket firing questions. On the other side of Tony was Rhodey. Wanda sat in between Clint and Vision. T'Challa was dropped off at his home country, or as far as the Quinjet could take him.
Harry blinked a couple times, "Sorry. I have all this knowledge about our world and I can't keep to all to myself." He turned to Merlin, "You were a sick child. You never met your father until a couple hours until his death. Gwaine, you hid your nobility because you didn't believe in nobles, yet here you are. Leon, you were always a loyal Knight, always believed that Uther was right regarding magic, but your childhood best friend had magic. Elyan, you always thought it was your duty to protect Guinevere, even though she was always a tough little girl. Percival, your mother was a physician, she taught you a lot of things. You probably had a better chance of becoming of physician than Merlin. Lancelot, you had aspirations as a child to become a Knight of Camelot, and you were given the chance even though you weren't a nobleman. You gave up the chance at first because you believed you hadn't proved yourself. Arthur... you always believed that your father was right all the time. Even when everyone was against him, you stood by him. That is what makes you an excellent King. You stand by the people you believe in.
"George?" Neville called out once he heard the floo. He knew what was happening but just couldn't believe it. Harry was dead. There was no way he would show up now to harvest a basilisk.
Vision was laying motionless on the ground. Thanos had gotten to him already. Wanda was next to him sobbing.
"I went to live with my gran since my mum and dad didn't have any siblings. And Harry couldn't really take me in as a 17 year old."
"Harry!" Draco yelled but when Harry didn't show up in the two seconds that Draco gave him, he yelled louder, "HARRY JAMES POTTER. GET YOUR ARSE OVER HERE BEFORE I HAVE YOUR BABY WITHOUT YOU!"
As she was looked through old books to try and figure something out, she remembered something from an old History of Magic essay about the Old Religion.
Harry sat on the floor of his bedroom in the compound. He finally let himself cry. Another death followed him. First his parents. Then Cedric, Dumbledore, Dobby, Fred, Remus, Tonks and now Teddy, Draco and Sirius.
The two worked together to pick up their stuff, putting all into their trunks and then shrinking those to fit in their pockets. By the time they left, the small clearing they were in, was as it was before they left. They didn't even leave a single reminder that they were there before.
"Magical legend says you told him hours before he died. Supposedly, he became mad at you for it after ten years of knowing each other, you didn't tell him your biggest secret. But, considering he was dying, he got over it and didn't order you to be executed. In Muggle, er, non magical legend, he always knew you had magic. You were a Court Sorcerer. Even Uther knew you had magic as you helped him with magical things occasionally." Harry recalled, "But... In my opinion, you should tell him. Believe me, I know a thing or two about losing people, and you don't want to leave this up until his deathbed. Keeping secrets from someone after they're dead is the worst. My godson never told his crush that he like him until he was impaled by Thanos, even though we could've saved him, he was dusted. You should probably also tell him about your feelings for him."
Severus nodded and passed Scorp to Pietro. He looked at the baby for a couple seconds before placing a kiss on top of his head, "He said to give Scorpius a kiss from him. He accepted his death. He died with a smile on his face."
Merlin just stepped aside and let the couple hold each other. Gwaine went over to Merlin and patted his back. "Good job, mate."
Steve rolled his eyes but nodded nonetheless, "So, Thanos snapped. People got dusted. Harry Potter, who if you don't know him, he was the one who destroyed Thanos' army, the one with the raven hair, green eyes that turned gold and the circlet. He, was the one who figured out how to bring everyone back. He went back to the Wizarding World."
When he finally opened his eyes, they were a blazing gold color. He stood up, not realizing the all the Avengers were now standing behind him, only facing Thanos and his army.
Sorry for the late chapter! I was busy all day yesterday and could never get on to post this chapter. Enjoy the longer chapter to make up for it. This was originally gonna end after the reveal, for a bit of a cliffhanger.
Draco made his way over to the other side of the bed where Arthur was standing. "It's best to leave him be for a couple hours. He most likely won't wake up for a while."
Strange seemed to be the only one who was calm, "Tony, there was no other way." Then he disappeared.
"Sirius. Snape and Dumbledore planned it. Dumbledore wanted Snape to be the one to kill him, so he could prove his loyalty to Voldemort so he would trust him. After that Hermione, Ron and I went for Tom Riddle's Horcruxes. We found most but had to go back to Hogwarts to find the last couple. Then I ended up being a Horcrux and whatever. War broke out at Hogwarts, the Battle of Hogwarts. May 2nd, 1998. Hell broke lose. So many people died, Sirius. Fred Weasley died, Snape died, Lavender Brown died, Colin Creevey died. Remus and Tonks died. I had to die. But Dumbledore gave me the Resurrection Stone so I came back. Thanks to Narcissa, I'm still here."
Harry smiled at Draco before he walked up to make his speech. He cast the Sonorous charm before he started, "Alright, so, um. I don't really know how I can top that," He chuckled a bit, "So, I'm gonna go completely off-script, sorry 'Mione, and just keep this hopefully somewhat short. I grew up with my Muggle relatives, my Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and cousin Dudley. I grew up treated like a house elf. I was forced to do the chores in the house, waking up terribly early to make breakfast and going to bed late after dinner had been cleaned up and the dishes were back in the cabinets. I slept in the cupboard under the stairs until I turned eleven when I first received my Hogwarts letter. Hogwarts was my home, since I couldn't really call the cupboard or Dudley's second room a home. I found out that the Wizarding world community knew more about me than I did. The Wizarding community treated me like a king, when I wasn't. I was only a boy who suddenly had the weight of a whole other world on his shoulders. People to this day thank me for what I did. But all I did was die. I reversed Voldemort's spell so it backfired upon himself. It was everyone else. It was Neville Longbottom, who killed Nagini, the last Horcrux. It was Ron Weasley who found the Gryffindor sword. It was Hermione Granger, who without we'd probably all died the second we stepped onto the '
Before he could react, Weasley stepped into their wards. Draco started throwing spells at Weasley who was deflecting them easily. Harry, at some point, joined the battle, and more spells were thrown. At one point, the Potters were winning, then the next, their wards were down, more Aurors came and joined in, Harry almost got captured, Draco was hit by some dangerous Curse, was bleeding profusely but still fighting, Harry got really mad, let his emotions take control and the Aurors had to disapparate considering half their men were down.
He opened the door quietly and leaned against the doorframe. He watched as Scorpius was playing with his toys, back facing the door.
"So, between the end of the battle, I spent a lot of time going over my life choices. After a while, I signed up for the Auror program. I skipped all the training, because of everything that I'd already been through. There was this one guy who hated me since the moment I entered. Bekhe Ryztan. He was the top Auror, besides Head Auror. He was gonna be Head once Robards quit, we all knew that after the year he wanted to leave but never found a good replacement for him. So Ryztan was gonna replace him. But when I joined the office, along with Ronald and Neville, who also skipped the junior program and made to the main program. When Robards retired five years after the war, I became Head Auror. Ryztan hated me even more then. So, we went along.
"Yes, Harry, you can change now. There's no point. You're leaving today anyway." Merlin sighed, still not believing that the Knights had a bet about his secret.
So. They did manage to get married and have two children, although one was dead. No matter how much she hated Malfoy, losing a child was the worst.
Once Pepper let go of Tony, he walked over to Harry who was still holding Pietro. Pietro reluctantly pulled away from the hug and looked around.
"Thankfully, we did make it here, so none of that is going to come true. At least I hope it won't." Harry said quickly after seeing his husbands face of sadness.
Thor stood there in all of his glory for a good couple of seconds before he charged at the large herd of creatures while yelling, "
"Okay. After you died, that summer was hell." Harry went on to explain everything that happened that summer, his sixth year, the summer of that year and then his non existent seventh year.
"Are you out of your mind?" Barton yelled. "You wanna bring a crazed psycho into your house? The one that kinda killed your husband?"
What Harry didn't realize was that when he let out his magic, he also brought everyone back. He only realized when he started to see portals start to show up. He looked around and saw everyone stepping out. T'Challa, Peter Quill, Doctor Strange, Wong, Peter Parker, Mantis, Drax, Wanda, Shuri, Groot, Hope, Scott, Clint, Sam, Bucky, Sirius, Teddy and Draco.
"He called me the Master of Death. I know that's a common thing between us, we all know about it. But no one from the Wizarding World knew it, and obviusouly not Mordred. Plus, he called Draco my consort. I'm assuming you know what a consort is."
Teddy laughed, his hair slightly turning more of a yellow blonde. "Right. Because they would know you have your patronus and your wedding date tattooed on your chest."
When the guard at the door introduced him, he noticed that the Knights of the Round Table, Arthur, Guinevere, Gaius and Merlin were sitting at the table. That was odd. Normally, Merlin was the one serving the food, not eating it. And Guinevere, seeing as she wasn't married to Arthur, shouldn't have been sitting at the table.
"What if..." Severus whispered. He kneeled down and took the circlet off his head. He put it around his wrist then shrunk it down to the size of his wrist.
Teddy was still principal of his school, but since it was now summer, he had a bit of a break for a while. He and Clint had gotten close. Clint reminded Harry a lot of the twins which made him really happy. Although Clint didn't like them at first, he was starting to love them like family.
"I need a list. I need a list of all energy surges that have somewhat the same energy recording as ours. The power level will be different, of course, but the recording and the surge should be the same."
"Yeah. His name is Pietro Maximoff. Real sweet guy. He has superhuman speed. Oh, we have superheroes on our Earth instead of witches and wizards. Teddy literally almost died for him twice, I think it is now. Pietro proposed to him right as Teddy was almost dying. Kinda sweet if you ask me. I didn't get to see it though."
Harry smiled and followed Draco into the tent. They worked quickly but easily as they packed up their home.
Harry rolled his eyes playfully at him then stood up. He tugged up the sleeves of his dress shirt (which was now slightly unbuttoned and not tucked into his pants anymore). He grabbed the hammer and pulled. It moved more than it had for any of the others. Then he gave up.
"Hi. I don't think we've been properly introduced. I'm Teddy Lupin. Or Potter." He stuck his hand out.
Less than a minute later, the blood looked like it was somehow seeping back inside of Harry and his eyes shot open, "Please don't shoot me. It's not very nice to shoot people on the same side as you."
"Now, Mordred, I don't believe that will be necessary. I believe we should talk this through." Harry thought? He didn't know what he was doing, mental connections?
"Draco can help you. Sirius doesn't know much about healing." Severus drawled, earning an elbow from Sirius.
The Chitauri and Thanos’ children and the Avengers fought. While the fighting was happening, there were reunions happening all around. Harry saw Tony and Peter hug, Steve and Bucky kiss, Teddy and Pietro kiss, Sirius and Severus hug (though Harry could see they both wanted a bit more than a hug), Sam and Rhodey hug, Wanda and Pietro hug and more. Harry looked around. The one person he wanted to see more than anyone, he couldn't find. Until he felt someone tap his shoulder.
Once they were inside the room, Draco pulled Teddy into one of the ridges hidden next to the main entrance.
"Oh, yes. The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. Born to those who have thrice defied, born as the seventh month dies. And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not. And either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives."
Harry spent his time in the library of all the magical books they owned trying to find an answer to the cracked bracelet. So far he found out that a broken bracelet in dreams were a symbol that your enemy is plotting against you. At the moment, Harry's only enemies were Thanos and himself.
Harry had always wondered why Draco stayed the same without his hair or skin products. He had asked Draco about it but he never answered.
Pietro reluctantly nodded and walked over to his nightstand drawer. He reached all the way to the back and pulled out a black velvet ring box. He handed it to Scorpius.
"Your soul guardian is the creature of the beast. Her movement has begun. She will make her appearance when the moon blocks the sun and the light is at it's lowest."
"Why'd you shoot him?!" He growled, not noticing that the wand he held wasn't the Holly wand, but instead it was the Elder Wand. He hadn't even noticed the screams had been replaced by whispers along the lines of 'that's the wand You-Know-Who used in the final battle'.
"She's sick so she asked me to bring Teddy with me." Draco had changed over the years. He visited Teddy at least once a week (from what Andromeda told him), always bringing him something new every visit. Of course, the Malfoy reputation had been severely damaged after the war, but he was slowly rebuilding it. His mother had died two years after the war, so he was the only one left of the Malfoy bloodline considering Lucius was on a life sentence in Azkaban. The Malfoy fortune had been left to him and he was putting it to good use. He donated money to St Mungo's, to Hogwarts, to small businesses who needed something to start them off, orphanages, and basically everything he saw that needed help. He was a changed man.
Severus quickly left the room (either eager to go catch up with his boyfriend or for the happy family to have some time alone), leaving only Harry, Draco and Scorpius.
He looked around, noticing that everything was clear without his glasses. That hadn't processed in his brain earlier.
"It's possible. But that would be too much of a risk. For all you know, you could end up killing another half of the universe and ruin everything even more."
"Severus Snape-Prince. Former Head of Slytherin House. Former Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor and Headmaster. Sadly, also the godfather of Draco."
"It is getting pretty annoying and we’ve only known them for a couple weeks." Elyan said, all the Knights plus Merlin and Guinevere nodded.
Harry fought against Keodor Hewion and Hugo Granger-Weasley while Teddy and Draco fought against Hermione and the whole squad of Aurors.
Thor dragged Steve along to the bar, Clint, Natasha and Bruce went over to the pool tables, Sirius and Teddy also went to the bar while Draco, Harry and Tony went to the photographers.
"To be fair, that is one of the harder potions in that book, and you were always crappy with potions at school," Draco picked the paper up again, skimming through some of the news before stopping, "You said the Ministry controls the Prophet, right?"
Merlin, for some reason, was in Slytherin. Some years ago, they had found a portrait of Merlin and decided to put him down by the dungeons seeing as he was never a headmaster.
One of Thanos' children went to attack Harry and he just held them back. Soon, Thanos pulled the power stone from the gauntlet and used it against Harry's spells. It held Harry back for two seconds which was enough time to put the stone back and snap.
"Please, Hadrian is fine. Lord Black was my go—father." He said realizing that maybe they didn't have godparents so in his current fake life, Sirius was his father.
"We were going to bring him back... y'know for you to bring him back... but he disappeared." Pietro said quietly. He looked at Harry, "We finally said we loved each other. And I told him I was going to marry him when we got out of this. He said to tell you that he loves you." Pietro looked at Scorpius then at Severus, "Can I hold him?"
In reality, Harry didn't want to ride a horse, he didn't know how to ride a horse. But he was the youngest Seeker in a century without even having ridden a broom before so maybe this should be easy.
"Okay. If you're sure," Draco smiled, pulling the paper down and kissing Harry quickly. "Are we still clear on the plan once the Ministry is weak enough?"
From inside the Jet, the others watched as two dragons, a wolf, a dog and a non-corporal Patronus were formed.
Harry turned to look at all the wizards and witches surrounding him. He put his hands up in the air, as if faking surrender.
When she stood up on the podium to address the crowds, she didn't know what to say. She had been doing this for so many years at this point, but this announcement was different. It was an announcement of the death of an old friend. But, instead of a friend, that man had become an enemy.
Severus walked up to Arthur and Merlin, pulling out his wand and muttering a spell when he got there. "That should stop the bleeding, it won't heal it, but it should help while we get him to Draco."
"Alright, that was one time! And I told you that in confidence, I didn't think you'd use that against me," Harry pouted.
The uniform was terrifying in his opinion. They were a dark blue, tight fitted jumpsuits with the SHIELD emblem on the sleeve. It had 'H. Potter' embedded on the left side. They were not protective at all compared to his dragon hide armor that he chose to wore underneath (not that anyone knew except Draco and possibly Teddy) after his first day.
The Aurors were starting to wake up. Draco and Harry kissed one last time, Harry, Draco and Teddy hugged one last time. They all said their goodbyes and were ready for whatever came next.
Draco finally finished setting up everything for his hospital. The hospital was the 'go to hospital' in New York, which says a lot. Now, he didn't have to go into work everyday, only for meetings and surgeries every once in a while. He'd been working a lot with Bruce which made him less crazy about operating 24/7.
Draco knocked on the door of the guest room which had turned into Sirius' room. "Um. Sirius? Can I talk to you?" He asked.
One, go to the Veil on Titan. Two, carve in the exact date that it is in the Wizarding World, according to George. Three, find George on the other side. Four, sneak out of the Ministry and into Hogwarts. Five, go down into the Chamber of Secrets without any students catching them. Six, harvest basilisk venom and scales and whatever else you can harvest from a basilisk. Seven, sneak out of Hogwarts and back into the Ministry. Eight, carve in the exact date for the Avengers world, this time according to Loki. Nine, get back to Avengers world.
Malfoy was on the third floor. With no Dementors in the place anymore, Harry didn't hear any of the screaming that would normally be caused by them.
"You all might wanna sit down. They already heard somewhat of a story because of a truth charm." The group all sat down in the living room, Harry closest to Draco. The Avengers, minus Thor, all seemed to be on edge still, as if Sirius could attack at any moment. "The year after you 'died', Draco was turned into a Death Eater, Voldemort saying he had to kill Dumbledore or he would kill his family. The end of the year came, and when he was gonna kill him, Snape killed him instead."
Harry smiled at his husband, "Alright. I'll be there in a second. I'm just gonna go talk to Teddy about something really quickly."
It seemed like everyone stood up. Then, Arthur kneeled. Then the Knights, Gwen and Merlin, following their King. Then the original six Avengers. Then Bucky, Rhodey, Sam, Maria, Wanda, Pietro and Carol. Then the Potters and everyone else. The last to kneel was Fury and he did so reluctantly.
Draco smiled and pulled him into a hug, "It's only been a couple hours and I missed you so damn much."
"I'm the Master of Death." He said, holding up his wrist so Snape could see the bracelet and the tattoo.
He looked down for a second and canceled the Sonorous charm silently. As he was looking down, someone started clapping. When he looked back up, his eyes basically left his head.
"Well, Draco does. I never touched anything in your vault unless Draco looked over it and made sure it was fine. He knew you had somethings you'd like to keep private."
Harry took a deep breath in but nodded either way. "Well, I'm sure you know that we were school rivals, you could say. He was a Slytherin and I was a Gryffindor. All the houses and professors besides Severus hated the Slytherins. They were cast out as the dark house, meaning that no one wanted to be associated with them. Him and me had a very odd, you could say, relationship. We would fight all the time and everyone knew of the rivalry between Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. During my sixth year, I had suspected that Draco had been turned into a de—a bad guy, which he had been. So I was following him around all year and accidentally hurt him. You probably don't remember, but he has these scars across his chest because of me. It was an idiotic decision and I've regretted it ever since, but I can't take it back. Then after the war, we became friends because of his decision to turn to the good side during the war and through Teddy. Teddy was actually the one who realized we were in love with each other. We had had a couple flings but never established anything until after we went on the run."
I am so terrible at keeping a consistent updating schedule, which I apologize for. This chapter was a bit hard to write because I've not been in the right mood to write some fluff at the moment. But either way, have fluff!
"Uncle Sev talks about my papa all the time and Uncle Natasha talks about Uncle Sirius but whenever I ask my dad about them he always just spaces out. Aunt Nat said her friend Clint knew Teddy the best but he's not around anymore, so I don't know who can tell me about him. Uncle Sev said you two were close."
There were more pictures, ranging from Draco's family, to the Marauders, to the Golden Trio, Harry's family, and Draco, Teddy and Harry. The last picture though, was the one Draco didn't want Tony to see.
Sirius scanned the room, eyes landing on Romanoff, "She's not another Weasley, right? Like she's not secretly Ginny Weasley in disguise, right?"
"You mean if he's noticed if his dad is gone? Yes, he has. He's very smart for a little two year old. He keeps asking when his Papa is gonna come home. What am I supposed to say? 'No, Scorp, he isn't coming home because some big grape man snapped him, Teddy and Sirius away.'? Severus is doing a better job at raising him than I am."
Severus rolled his eyes but opened the box. To say he was shocked was an understatement. He had absolutely no words.
"Okay, yeah. But I want them to get along. Of course I'd want my godfather and my husband to get along." Harry said.
"I was on my way to Camelot for some business I had to attend to but my horse seems to have run off when I stopped for a bit."
"Get him to a ship. His family needs the body to bring him back." Clint said as he ran over to a ship to drop the kid off before looking for anyone else.
"When I first met Mordred, he was a child. Somewhere around ten years old. When we left, he was maybe twenty years old. His guardian, I don't know if it was his father or not, was killed in Camelot for being a druid. He grew up with not much of a choice in life. The only reason he turned to Morgana was because I didn't help him. I don't want to make that mistake again."
Merlin dwelled. If he told her, it had a chance it wouldn't happen. But, it already happened. So, there was no point in not telling her. But, there was only six months until it happened, so she could wait. But, she wouldn't leave him alone until he told her.
When Sirius, Severus, Teddy and the Avengers were getting on the Jet, they didn't know what to expect. An energy surge that was three times as powerful as when Harry, Draco and Teddy entered the world was not something to mess around with.
"Exactly. In maybe 40 or 50 years, she'll be dead. Meaning, a new Minister, then we can strike. Or we wait until she retires."
