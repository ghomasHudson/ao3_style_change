'What is it?' the boy asked, his own voice a tad different as well.
"And that is exactly it, is it not? You are not
Draco stopped, pulling Harry's hand to make him stop as well. 'It is. It's important for us to have each other — to trust each other. Is it that big of a thing?' Raising one of his eyebrows slightly, he watched how Harry sighed deeply and nodded his head.
He couldn't suppress a smile any longer as he felt the many butterflies he held captive inside his stomach slowly flutter away.
Her interruption made him smile; it had made the ginger-haired boy, apparently named Ron, turn a violent red — almost as red as his hair but not quite there. 'It's alright,
'Maybe I'll become a professor at Beauxbatons as well so I can be by your side the entire time,' the boy then said. Visions of Harry teaching classes in terrible French flashed in front of Draco's eyes and he couldn't help but laugh. It would be a terrible idea. 'But let's go to bed shall we? Do you want me to walk you back to the carriage?'
The girl didn't seem to know what was happening to her nor to why Draco suddenly seemed to hate her so deeply, but she also didn't dare to ask him why. Draco even made her trip in a crowded hallways once, and didn't feel the slightest guilt for it. She had stolen

As Madame left the room, Draco sat himself down on one of the sofas. He had a lot to think about; especially about Harry. Perhaps it was good that they had had a small argument earlier; maybe it would be easier to ignore him now. He had helped him with all the information he had on dragons, hadn't he? Surely he would find
'Innocent? I don't believe it!' Another student now shouted. 'Besides, he hasn't even been sorted properly, has he? Just because he's Harry's boyfriend doesn't mean he
He can't surrender himself!' He tried to free his arm from her grip, but it was stronger than he'd ever expect it to be. Hermione's eyes were set with determination.
Holding in a grin, Draco placed his hand on Harry's shoulder. 'You'll get your chance,' he said to him, trying to encourage what seemed to be a lost cause. Draco's eyes then suddenly fell upon another invitee; a man wearing teal-colored robes and holding a strange looking vial in his hands. Talking to others in an animated way, he seemed to be explaining a potion to them. 'I just got an idea, Harry,' he then said as an imaginary lightbulb enlightened itself above his head.
Fleur recognized his voice and threw her arms around Draco in a tight embrace. 'I am so happy that you're here, Draco,' she said to him in French. 'It's all such a mess.'

voice; Voldemort was whispering to him that he should cast the terrible spells he had been thinking about — that he knew what they were called and exactly how to cast them.
'We apologized!' Hermione spat out, raising her voice and getting ssh-t by the librarian almost as fast. 'Harry knows we're sorry. He knows we didn't mean it that way. I was just confused and Ron— well Ron was just jealous.'

'He loves it, Molly,' Hermione translated and Molly beamed even more.
— but it definitely paid off as he held up his hands in surrender. 'Alright, alright,' he mumbled. 'She saw me selling items in Knockturn Alley — if I hadn't given her the locket she would've k-killed me,' he stammered on.
Harry wiped a strand of hair out of Draco's face and placed both of his hands on the blond's shoulders. The boy had to raise himself on the tips of his toes to be able to reach Draco's lips and kiss him once again in his distinct clumsy way. Draco kissed him back as he wrapped his arms around Harry and pulled him even closer than he thought was possible. He placed his hands to rest on the small of Harry's back and felt the boy's hands entangle themselves in his long platinum hair.

Draco didn't know what to say; he had already tried to get the idea out of Harry's head ever since he had told him about Castor being a Death Eater and to why he had been going to the seventh floor so often. All he had told Harry was that there was a special room; the Room of Requirement which held many objects that were either lost or hidden away for strange reasons. He hadn't dared to say a word about the object they had been working on; a cabinet of which Draco had no idea of what it did. All he knew was that there had to be certain spells cast upon it of which Castor wasn't powerful enough to do so himself — and apparently, Draco was.
, this time I truly mean it.'
Frowning his eyebrows, Draco tried to remember if he had seen around another girl the last couple of days. Suddenly remembering him hanging around a girl he knew was named Lavender Brown a lot, often talking quite intimately, Draco nodded his head. 'Of course; I apologize.'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Obeying Hermione's words, Harry approached Draco by the night's fall. The sun had made its way above their heads, slowly sunken away into the night. A few stars were already coming through, and Draco hadn't moved at all since the morning. He hadn't eaten, slept, or done anything but sit by the shore and watch the waves pull back and forth. On the exact same spot, his back scary straight, his eyes never blinking once.
Draco didn't shake it like Harry did, but kissed it. It took a few seconds for Harry to realize that Draco always kissed a
Here, Draco gave Harry a sympathetic look. "What makes you think they weren't?"
Dumbledore?' Leaning closer, Draco could see the blisters on the man's hand.
‘That’s because I am, Harry. The sooner you realize, the sooner you’ll get over it.’
'Thank you!' he then shouted, a little smile gracing his lips.
On a Monday morning he hears the sound of a bird's beak ticking against his bedroom window. Still dressed in green silk pajamas and sweaty from another nightmare, he crawls out of bed and makes his way to the feathery creature. It's an old Barn Owl with a beautiful round face, staring at Draco with jet black eyes. He's brought a small package with him and a letter, both tied multiple times with a red and gold ribbon.
The boy blinked rapidly with his eyes again, surprised, almost
Draco shook his head. 'Beside from these three books,
“How can Pibbly help you sirs?” The house-elf asks, her blue eyes bright and large. She twists the pillowcase she’s wearing around her fingers in a nervous manner, noticing the Ministry symbol on his and Ron’s chest.
'Yes; they kind of sense it. Now, let's go!' Luna announced.
Hermione quickly tried to mimic an expression that was a mix of irritation and anger, not quite the perfect look either but better than before. A Bellatrix Lestrange whom had eaten something terribly and was suffering from an intense stomach-ache, that was the version of the cruel woman Hermione resembled the most. Holding in a grin, Draco bit his lip and tried to focus. He kept his back straight, his expression blank. It didn't take him a lot of effort to look like himself, nor the possessed version if that's what they wanted to see.
part. Once again, a faint smile followed. "That was a dumb question, wasn't it? I should know an angel can't be human like myself… Is your heart gone then?" Not exactly sure why he asked about the boy's heart, Harry suddenly felt guilty for doing so. Was it perhaps a rude question to ask?
'I've known you longer than today, Harry. I can hear such things.'
'That's because you haven't seen someone die,' Luna explained. 'Harry has seen Cedric die, and I my mother.'
day. He simply despised school, to put it into words. Not because of the actual learning part, but because of the people there. They'd always been cruel to him — because he didn't wear the newest clothes or owned the newest gadgets, wore glasses and they simply considered him to be
Draco sighed again, deeper this time as he threw his hands up in the air out of frustration. Didn't he have this same conversation only a few hours ago? 'Because I find it unfair that he has to all these tasks
His fingers slowly slide over its strings, listening to the faint sound lifting from it. It has been a long, long while since he played. Probably since the day the Dark Lord decided that the Manor would become his house, his headquarters. Draco hadn't dare to touch a single string of the violin, afraid it's sound would annoy the Dark Lord and make him pay a high price for that annoyance.
Harry now frowned. 'But — during the summer, before Grimmauld Place, it moved a few times as well.'
; the twins sleep in this one as well and we share a common room just like the houses at Hogwarts,' Draco explained.
Draco called out as Castor picked up another object, ready to throw.
Draco shook his head. ‘
Immediately the stormy grey eyes of the man look up, stare right into Harry's own. 'Yes?'
In defense, the man named Cuffe rose from his seat as well. 'The Ministry's already doing just that.' His hands were balled to fists and leaned upon the wooden table, it's surface shaking by the force underneath his knuckles.
Harry shook his head, then placed his old copy of his Potions book next to Draco's. 'I'm here for this,' he admitted.
Voices were raised at his table; all the boys protesting against the matter immediately. They had kept to some sort of quiet at the start, but having such a small chance at visiting another Wizarding School just outraged them all. Draco bit his bottom lip and felt nervous all of the sudden. He really wanted to go to Hogwarts; to support his school and experience things no other boy of his school would experience. Would Madame choose him? What if she chose one of the twins? They were both the perfect candidate; talented
Potter sighs and keeps his eyes locked in Draco's. His jaw clenches a little as he replies; “But they weren't that irrelevant, were they?”
That worry seemed to amuse Draco, and he smiled softly. "— but I am unable to. And even if I wanted, I wouldn't alright? You've got my word."
'We would if
Draco looked away; not wanting to see his father and his '
The man sighed and folded his hands. 'We're doing everything we can; writing the most insane stories to cover up his deeds but—'
Draco nodded as a reply, brushed through his hair with his golden comb. It had grown ever since his difindo, but he had kept it at a length just under his ears. He liked the way it softly waved; something he hadn't noticed as it had always fallen down as straight as straight could be before. 'You shouldn't worry yourself too much about our guests —
Fleur frowned her eyebrows and gave him a look. 'Excited? Since when do you care about wether people are excited or not?' Her voice betrayed a slight irritation and Draco sighed deeply because of it.
Affronted by Harry comment, Draco stopped in his pace and let go of Harry's hand, crossed them instead. He, king of fashion and Wizarding style,
Madame Maxime tsk'ed as she made her way towards the pair. 'He must be lying, Dumbledore.
Harry shrugs. 'I guess I hated you back at Hogwarts… but that has changed. The- the moment it changed isn't really a good memory to the both of us, but- do we have any good memories of each other to start with?'
. And because of that you will have to know what lives there and how to fight or avoid them. Not to mention that you will have to be able to stay underwater for an hour.'
'Forgive him, my lord — my son is still young and weak,' his father started, turning himself to Voldemort with a begging expression on his face.
'Doesn't mean I'm not grateful for your effort.' Draco smiled and lazily stroke his fingers through Harry's hair, his eyes opened just a little. 'Aren't you worried that your father will find out that you're staying here — with the Order, the enemy?'
. "We have a baby!"
,' Draco interrupted. 'I won't endanger you nor your friends like that. I know Hogwarts is a strictly guarded place — perhaps even more than Beauxbatons — but that doesn't mean they won't find a way to break through its protective spells.'
?' Draco said to him, scowling at himself being so stupid.
'He didn't tell me because he knew I would react the way I did and—'
good, Harry. That is not how it's supposed to be." Once again the words traveled through a thick layer of fog, and the boy's angelic voice passed by Harry's ears like a soft breeze. It was as if he was looking through a hazy tunnel, with himself on one end and the boy on the other — flickering like an hallucination.
. Even the sound of their given names sounds wrong in Harry's head.

, wait,' Draco interrupted him. 'Let me guess first…' He closed his eyes and acted as if he was thinking very hard. It made him look ridiculous and Harry was on the verge of pushing the blond into the cold lake when he opened his eyes again. 'Perhaps an animal that lives in the forest?'
'It has been

she even care? It wasn't as if her worries would make them disappear or heal all of a sudden, would they? He sighed deeply and took Harry's hand in his again, eyes drifting off towards the boy's lightning bolt shaped scar. Memories of a large bathtub where they once had discussed their scars. Draco had gained quite a few since then.
Impressed by Ron's genuine words, Draco felt his cheeks glow. The fact that he could make the most hard-headed person in the Wizarding World change his opinion of him, made him feel like the elegant and sublime Wizard he had always been. '
, wizard who saved the world.
'That we're destroying the horcruxes. He must've felt it, he must feel that pieces of his own soul are being destroyed… there is no other way.'
'So you're here? Why didn't you send me a letter or something? If I had known…,' Harry said to him. Together with Ron and Hermione they had gathered around one of the tables in class and were leaning a bit closer to each other with curious eyes pointed in Draco's direction. But Draco just shrugged. 'Something's bothering you, right?' Harry guessed, taking Draco's hand in his and looking directly into his grey eyes with his own greens.
"Where else would I be?" Draco answered, his tone still so incredibly calm. Harry wondered what went on in Draco's head — in the head of an angel. Would he think the same way as he did? Or would his thoughts be blank, or only related to angel-things? A question Harry was definitely planning on asking — but perhaps not now.
. He had always wanted to be asked to a ball by someone and as Harry was the first ever person to make his heart pace at a speed too high to be healthy, he seemed the perfect candidate to do so. But Harry hadn't asked him anything yet, didn't even mention the ball at all and it had already been two weeks since the announcement.
A deep breath was taken before Draco started his story, ready to tell Harry everything about his father that he knew; ready to reveal secrets he had hidden away for him for too long already. ‘

'What about his friends? Or those boys from Ravenclaw that made fun of you and Dean, they wear red quite often. Or—‘
Students rose from their seats, clapping their hands as Draco bowed for what was now
Draco sighed at his words. He had also thought about the final task many times but had no idea what it could be. Not even Fleur or Madame Maxime seemed to know what it was the Champions had to face last. They all knew it would be something grand; something that would challenge them one last time. A great challenge that would only be succeeded by a true Champion. Why Harry had suddenly decided to talk about it, right after their accident, Draco didn't know. But he knew that if he didn't answer, Harry would lift up his head and stare an answer out of Draco’s tired eyes. 'It'll be fine. You don't have to win, just — survive,' Draco told him.
It seemed enough to make the boy swallow. 'I-I guess. Never really… thought about it,' he mumbled, taking in Draco's face.
Harry said to him. 'And you should help us.'

A few moments later they stranded in a deserted Diagon Alley with their feet on the cobbles in front of Gringrotts, Wizarding Bank. The tall, marble structure rose in front of them — the golden details Draco remembered looked dirty and unpolished. A glance over his shoulder, but besides from a single witch; there was no-one to be seen. 'Why is it so quiet here?' he heard Ron whisper by his ear.

If Draco's words had already hit a nerve, Ron's whole nerve-system exploded at Harry's. ‘Shut up, Harry! At least I’m not the one taking another bloke to the ball!’
great of a support in the first place; he simply wasn't strong enough to help the boy. A few kisses were shared before Draco helped him crawl through the portrait hole, into the equally loving arms of his friends. He could see Seamus and Dean hurrying themselves over to Harry to help him, as well as a boy he had never seen before. A funny looking plant he held in his hands with great care but was put aside immediately as he noticed his hurt friend. How wonderful they were, Harry's friends; caring for him like Draco knew the girls cared for him as well. He waved at them and they waved back before guiding Harry to one of the sofas, pushing a first year off of it to make room. Yes, Draco could definitely be friends with those Gryffindors.
A grin from the blond followed. ‘Perhaps the shirt is a bit—'
Almost as if Malfoy felt Harry's eyes on him, he looks away from the tea cup. 'Will you inform me when Granger finds something new?' he asks Harry.

Draco had never turned around faster in his life; eyes focused on the empty plate in front of him again. The muscles in his neck screamed from the sudden turn and he felt his heart skip a beat. 'W-When did you say we had to go to the arena again?' he asked Fleur — anything to get distracted from the boy's green eyes. 'We can go now already if you'd like?'
everywhere and I was afraid
A hallway with floor to ceiling windows appeared beyond his bedroom' door and lead him back to the common room he knew so well. His light footsteps resounded on the marble floor, his presence getting mirrored in every shiny detail of gold. Others also left their rooms, the curve of the hallway making some windows and doors slightly curved as well. Blue numbers declared one's chambers and magical golden footprints on the floor told a lost first-year where to go. The dormitories at Beauxbatons were simply nothing like those at Hogwarts; they weren't divided into houses or years, they were simply divided as how Madame pleased.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
… He had missed it
Draco opened his palm, making a paperclip appear — the object too small for everyone to see before it disappeared. 'A Portkey.'
, they were so
Hair pointing in every direction, trousers wrinkled but a smile on his face; Draco couldn't have resembled Harry more when the boy opened the door of Grimmauld Place for him. The world became a blurry haze as Harry wrapped his arms around him and pulled him inside, twirled him through the hallway as if he hadn't seen him in years. 'Calm down,
, that we would have to live under
Hesitantly he stepped inside. Noticing his presence, the room fell quiet as all eyes turned upon him.
Harry turned his back to Draco immediately, facing the owner of the voice. He held his hands on Draco's hips in a protective way while the tall blond tried to hide himself behind his smaller lover the best he could. A speck of orange in the corner of his eye was enough for Draco to know that Harry's best friend Ron had entered the room. 'Y-yeah?' Harry finally answered.
,' the blond mutters to him, and immediately it becomes clear to Harry that Malfoy is surprised to see them, even though he hides it well. Pibbly probably didn't tell him that it were Potter and Weasley that were his unexpected Auror guests.
. There could be no other explanation than the fact that Potter had somehow
It seemed to upset Harry again, as he clenched his jaw and looked away from Draco's eyes — his grip around Draco's shoulders tightening as well. 'Does it have to do with
As Cedric Diggory left through the door, Dumbledore focused on a new item that had entered the Hall. Placed upon the teacher's table was a mystery item veiled beneath a brown cloth. 'Only one of them will go down in history as the winner of this year's Triwizard Tournament. Only one will be able to conquer-' and at those words the item underneath the cloth was revealed, '- the Triwzard Cup!' A beautiful blue cup was revealed with silver detailing and a blue light glowing inside, similar to the color of the Goblet's blue flames.
, he thought to himself. Harry still didn't know wether Draco had survived the curse he had casted at him — wether he was safe in the hands of Snape or in those of whoever he had taken him to. It pained him to think about it again, and quickly Harry tucked the timepiece away.
The ceiling and floor are both painted black, as well as the four poster bed draped with heavy curtains. In the middle of the room, a little away from the bed, a small table stands with two chairs beside it. They both look extremely uncomfortable despite their green cushioning, and Harry can’t imagine Malfoy ever sitting in one of them unless it’s utterly necessary. A wooden desk is placed against a window to their right, the top nearly invisible underneath piles of heavy old books. A few brooms, probably latest edition, are lined up on the opposite wall, reminding Harry of the Gryffindor versus Slytherin matches back at school.
It got late faster than any other day, and although there were no windows in the sloped roofs of the small attic — still Harry could sense the stars above their heads, shining their brightest on that night. They'd been talking for another few hours and sat there peacefully trying to understand the weird situation they were in. Harry'd tried his best to make the little homework he'd gotten, but Draco's eyes had been so incredibly hard to ignore. They'd burned in his back, had made his mind go crazy almost. It was something Harry knew he'd have to get used to. And the faster, the better.
'Then why did you wake me?'
'There is something there!' Castor said again as he pointed at the spot. He then bowed his arm, and as his hand was about to throw the object into Draco's direction again, he suddenly grabbed for his stomach and fell to his knees. An expression of pain appeared on his face as he let out a high-pitched cry.
Another silence followed as they both awkwardly sat across one another; Harry slowly taking sips from his pint and Draco tracing his fingers over the pages of his books. Hogwarts students kept entering and leaving the pub in quick paces; ordering hot and cold butterbeer and sitting down at tables as far away from Harry as they could. Draco noticed Harry looking over at them a few times; a certain sadness visible in his eyes. Even though he acted like he didn't care; Draco could see it

“How do you mean, all of it?” Harry searches for Malfoy's eyes but the man won't let him.

An evil whispering of words followed as Harry demanded the locket to open — and it did.
A light touch on his arm woke him from his thoughts, and Draco immediately lifted his head, turned his eyes to lock them into the green ones he knew perfectly well. Harry was

,' he then whispered to the pastel blue door — its structure swinging aside to reveal a common room more crowded than Draco could have ever expected.
‘That would’ve been a shame,’ was all the boy could manage to say.
His classes were taught in a mix of English and French. The books were in the students their mother language while Harry spoke to them in his; it was the perfect exercise to practice their English. Besides, Harry had learnt quite some French himself over the past years and could perfectly understand what his students were saying — however, Draco forever forbade him to talk the language, saying that his accent could cause people to go death.
Harry gave him a confused look in return. 'Where what is?'
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Draco suddenly remembered that Harry was indeed the same age as him; only a month younger actually. But what did the boy mean by enough adventures in the past years? Draco didn't know; he only knew about the tale that made him famous to the Wizarding World. 'I don't know enough about you nor your past to judge on that, but I'll understand your opinion.'
Care if I join you?' Harry gave Draco a strange look but shrugged. Picking up his pace again, Draco joined him by his side as they passed through the gates — the pair of winged boars looking down upon them with their tiny eyes.
'Don't worry, it-it didn't spread to your face. It stopped at your Adam's apple. It's alright, you're alright,' he says. His words come out with loud breaths, anxious breaths. It's almost as if Potter's more scared than Draco. At least; more worried.
Well, clever the girl was for noticing that but Draco couldn't help but feel that it wasn't all she wanted to say. Hermione remained quiet, awaiting Draco's answer as she closed the old book she had been reading. 'I just want to help him,' Draco admitted.
funny thought, Unspeakable Davis passed by to tell me a rather exciting story.'
Harry shook his head as fast as he could, his eyes frightened at Dumbledore's anger. The Headmaster had grabbed him by his shoulders and was staring deeply into his eyes. 'No, I have not, sir,' Harry managed to get out. His breathing sounding rapid and nervous.
Throwing a vile glare at him, he saw how Castor's eyes still stared at the spot where the statue had collided with Harry before — still sure there was something there. Another object followed, this time caught in Draco's hands. But then another one, and another one,
'Do you really believe I will summon the Dark Lord for nothing, you—'
A pale blue carriage with winged horses was eagerly waiting by the chateau's entrance; ready to bring the students of Beauxbatons to a different location. As big as a house, the carriage was and as large as elephants the horses were. Draco felt intimidated by its size but encouraged at the same time. Madame Maxime stood by one of the horses, making the giant creature look a little smaller. André and Ansel said their last goodbyes to Draco before disappearing into the chateau again, waving their hands over-dramatically.
and two other Wizarding Schools have decided to organize the Triwizard Tournament again.'
'No? It otherwise looks a lot like you're trying to be him!'
It isn't as if he doesn't eat, though. Three times a day he calls for Pibbly, asking if she can bring him some food. And he finishes
'I don't —,' he mumbled, not really knowing what to reply. He wanted to defend Harry; keep it a secret and tell her one of the Death Eaters was to be held responsible — but he knew Hermione would see right through him no matter what lie he would tell her.
. I know,' Draco whispered back. He hadn't forgotten about the look of hunger when he had shown Harry his long hair before.
A Golden Egg; Draco didn't know about that detail yet. Well, at least
,’ one student began, followed by others whom pointed at the shining new piece of jewelry around Draco’s ring finger. They said it in an irritated, hysterical way in which only the French could try to clear something up. Their hands in the air, fingers pointing at Draco and looking at Harry as if he was the most stupid person they'd ever seen.
'I don't have any other clothes with me, Hermione,' Ron protested, and Harry agreed, even though all he could think of was how Draco's timepiece and that photograph of him were still in his backpack at the Burrow.
. It had frustrated him even more when he had awoken, almost drowning by the surprise of finding himself in ice cold water. He had splashed his arms and legs in fury while getting cheered on by the surrounding crowd. Cursing all the professors and inventor of the tasks, he hadn't even thought about wether Harry had succeeded or not. But as the boy had grabbed ahold of his face, mumbling words Draco couldn't even hear, he knew by his clumsy kiss that he had succeeded. And succeeded greatly,
'Well, normally professor Snape gives potions but now that Slughorn has returned; he is allowing other students with a bit lower grades to his class as well. Harry and Ron weren't supposed to be in potions class,' Hermione explained.
"It shall be better if you do not look, Harry,"
Their conversation then got interrupted by a loud voice, loud shouts coming from downstairs — followed by footsteps bonking their way up the stairs with no shame nor hesitation. “Potter!” It came a few moment later from right underneath the closed hatch. “Open,
A happiness greater than Draco'd ever experiences had filled his stomach, his mind, his soul. He couldn't help but smile widely as he closed the high doors behind his back. Eyes pointed themselves in his direction once more, now curious. "A baby!" Draco shouted happily at them, at his brothers. He simply couldn't keep it a secret — he simply had to tell!
'It's down in the basement so perhaps if you'll hang out with silent Davis for another hour we can still go to that place afterwards? Really have to do this task first; the Minister himself gave it to me so I better be off now,' the man continued.
Draco nodded his head as he slid the brown rope that was wrapped around it with a butterknife. '
'But why?' Harry didn't really understand what Hermione was trying to say. Why would a locket want to be alone with him? So he could change its owner from Draco to Harry?
Draco shrugged as a reply. 'Nothing special; really. Information about
Just then, for once in the sixteen years he'd spent at the Dursleys their house, Draco wished they
Down, down they went. Specks of gold, touches of marble and hints of blue slowly fading away into darkness. A rich smell, that of Christmas, filled their heads with joy as they reached the bottom of the stairs. Ginger, brown, blond and raven haired heads took a look around, their eyes trying to adjust to the darkness. The cozy room Draco had discovered only a few weeks before Dumbledore's unexpected arrival doomed up in front of them. 'This is where you have been hiding Hogwarts their headmaster?' Ansel asked, mouth wide open and looking around the room as if it was filled with glittering unicorns.
The robes he wore felt heavy, dirty, not his or anything he would ever wear. He knew they were his though, but had thought to have disposed them already ages ago. 'Who on earth decided to dress me this way?' he complained while taking them off, throwing them somewhere in a heap onto the floor. A grin. Harry had a smile on his face as he took off his own clothes, for once neatly folded them onto a chair. Draco's hand reached for his hair. It felt greasy and fried at the same time, as if it hadn't been washed in months. He pulled a face, then unbuttoned the shirt he had been wearing underneath the robes. A gasp. Having to hold on to the bed's frame to keep himself from collapsing.
The boy turned his head to Draco now, his raven hair blowing out of his face and exposing his lightning-bolt shaped scar in its full glory. 'It's nothing you should worry about.'
he breathed out. 'But how?' Turning himself to the door again, he retrieved his wand from his sleeve to start tapping against the iron. Nothing happened, obviously. With a shrug, he glanced at the others whom shrugged their shoulders in return — not much of help either.
Harry once again pushed up his spectacles and stared at the ground as if he found the grass underneath his feet
. And it makes him cry. It once again makes him
Aurors arrest a Wizard or Witch responsible for those acts, do I?'
Deciding that it's better to be on Malfoy's good side, Harry arrives five minutes early to the Manor. Just like last time when he came with Ron, the wards open up to him like a flower to the sunlight. The wards were set up like that after the War, letting any Auror enter the Malfoy property without permission from it's owner. Just like Harry thought of earlier. To him, however, it always feels like he’s invading someone's privacy, even if it is that of his old enemy.
‘Higher!’ A man dressed in blue from head to toe, marching from one way of a field to the other with his hands in his sides. A golden wand with a bright green emerald at its end sticking out of his trousers’ pocket. A beret on his head. Silver locks peeking from underneath the wool. ‘Higher, Louis! Four meters above the ground it not nearly enough to achieve those Quiddich dreams of yours!’ His voice was strict yet righteous — scary to a few yet a trust radiating from it as well.
With the female version of Draco out of sight, Harry turned himself towards the blond again. 'Jealous?' he asked with a smirk. Draco just huffed and lifted his chin.
He was just showing off how to use
Draco didn't care; he only cared about the boy. Wether he was smart or brave or evil. As he looked over his shoulder again, his eyes found the boy's greens — but this time the boy quickly looked away, almost feeling caught glancing at Draco himself. He felt a slight blush appear on his cheeks but it disappeared as fast as it came when Dumbledore cleared his throat to make an announcement.
knew him or not. 'You know Draco's father,' he said to Snape. 'You should have known the boy in my memories was his son.'
Draco's eyes glanced at the portrait whom nodded at his words. '
'I don't know what
' the portrait called. '
but you abandoned them for an entire day. And you lied to them,' Madame's words were said in a soft manner but it made Draco feel even worse. He had indeed left the girls behind; he had told them a lie. He hadn't gone to the library but exchanged it for a dingy pub to study dragons with whom was supposed to be his enemy.
, one could read the speculation to why the distinct color of the school was a pale blue — it's founder had seen the newly-built chateau finished for the first time under a midnight's moon and had seen it's white color transformed to a blue so pale it was simply mesmerizing. And as Draco looked at the chateau with the same eyes as its founder; he couldn't agree with him more.
Draco sneered. 'The only stupid thing I ever did was fall in love with you, Harry James Potter. Don't worry too much about me.' At that, Harry tightened his embrace a little.
"Good-bye!" The girl called behind him, waving her little hand.
A new grin appeared on Draco face. 'I'm here to take you away, of course.'
'Everyone's afraid,' Hermione whispered back — Hermione that had now transfigured into Bellatrix Lestrange, a woman all four of them despised.
Dumbledore.
"So I am not the first Mortal to see you? Or at least, to survive seeing you?"
, sang a song to you?’ Harry’s voice dripped with disbelief but Draco nodded fervently and glanced up at the mermaid, whom nodded as well. ‘I always heard rumors about her not being able to speak.’
‘Harry Potter is dead!’
'So, I'm your boyfriend now?' Draco repeated Harry's earlier words. It made a smile appear on the boy's face as well as he leaned forward and kissed Draco. Draco pulled his face away after a few touches of their lips and stared into the boy's eyes. 'And I didn't mind you touching me before. It's just that I also have never been in love so don't expect me to be the experienced one here,
'Why are you hiding?' he asked the pair in confusion.
Tears stung behind his eyes again as he listened to the boy's words. '
'Are you sure about this?' Hermione asked for the hundredth time. It seemed as if Harry and Ron were experiencing deja vu's, as they rolled their eyes several times.
Draco bowed his head at her demand. Of course he would guide the girls; she didn't even have to ask. It had already become clear to him that he had to take care of them during the entire trip; it was the main reason why Madame had invited him to come along in the first place. The thought of a large bathroom also made him glad; he had used the smaller one the carriage held the night before and it wasn't much larger than his small compartment had been. Knowing that all the girls, including himself, were rather keen on taking good care of their hygiene and hair; a decent bathroom was a must.
He saw harry's eyes search in his; trying to find something — an answer or anything at all — but they couldn't as they appeared a more duller grey than they had ever been before. Draco tried to make himself a bit angry now as well in order to avoid any tears to show up in his eyes; it would only make the situation worse. But that anger only seemed to confuse the boy even more.
Their feet crushed branches with every step they took. A crow was shouting at them. A bird sang a melody. They made their way through a dense forest; only a little bit of light leading their way. In the far distance they could see a house; the start of Hogsmeade. They had packed up their tent and belongings earlier that morning, leaving fast without making too much noise. Harry had been sick for another two days; but had declared to have rested enough by sunrise. And so they were on their way.
What they did know, however, was that they had to get out of Malfoy Manor's cellar as fast as they could. Luna apparated away first with Dobby — and within five minutes the elf returned with a satisfied smile upon his face. It was now there turn, and Hermione and Ron already took Dobby's hands. Harry couldn't. He froze. 'Wait,' he said. 'We can't just leave Draco behind.'
Harry's words gave Draco a warm feeling; at least some people seemed to find him talented enough. Of course it was one of the reasons he was chosen by Madame Maxime to join them as he was the brightest Wizard of
Fingertips then met something so extremely cold that Harry couldn't help but pull away again immediately, as it burned like ice on an open wound. Barely pulled away, the boy suddenly moved as if coming to life again — lifting his head from the ground and staring directly into Harry's eyes.
Draco didn't know what to say. He was panting because of all the overpowering emotions and couldn't think straight anymore. A single tear slid down his cheek again, but he wiped it away quickly, not wanting to let Harry see that he was
It was a perfect example of
"Or?" Harry pushed, wanting to hear what else could've happened.
A round arena made of stone benches and protective, sparkling spells. Rocks everywhere, surrounding the structure and inside the circle itself; the perfect environment for dragons. Flags and banners with house and school crests fluttered in the wind, catching a soft autumn breeze in their bright colors. A cream colored tent beside it, giving the Champions a place to prepare and a place to rest.
‘Sounds to me like a large tattoo rather than what I’m experiencing,' he answers.
; and that says a lot,' Draco said to him, pulling another disgusted face.
'I can't fix you, Malfoy,' he says to him after a while. 'At least, not yet. Ron and I are still trying to figure out how this curse works; how it spreads, how it started. But besides you we don't really have any other Death Eaters left to examine.'
'You'll be fine,' Draco told Fleur for already the hundredth time that morning. 'Your plan will work, I'm sure!'
His grip around the glass orb tightened as he shook his head slowly. 'Never! I don't know what it means, but I do know that it must be protected from
'Magic word?' The boy frowned. 'As in
for Merlin's sake, looking like an ugly mermaid as he flipped his fin in the bathtub's water. Draco hadn't been able to stop laughing and had to cast a counter spell to not choke on his own tongue.
' a voice then said in a dreamy way. Two pairs of eyes looked in the direction of the voice; spotted Raphael dreaming away in his portrait. 'How much I love seeing you two together again.'
Frowning his eyebrows a little, Harry tried to make sense of something. "When did you start guarding me? I thought you said you've been guarding me for sixteen years, no? So, does that make me—"
,' Draco replied, looling straight into those same eyes.
, Draco then thought to himself.
Harry didn't know how fast to swim over to him, and as he reached the blond, he wrapped his arms around him immediately. But Draco didn't react at all. His body felt more cold than it ever had and it made him panic; what if he was dead? The boy's eyes were closed in a peaceful way, his white eyelashes touching his cheeks ever so delicately. He realized that he was probably in an enchanted sleep; maybe not even aware that he was bound to a rock at the bottom of a lake.
Cedric Diggory! I don't see any of
“It surprises me it took him so long to return home — had expected him to barge in already hours ago,” Harry calmy shared with Draco, whom held his head a little askew as Dudley went on with his shouting, now banging on the walls of the hallway. If only Petunia’s floral wallpaper wouldn’t get dirty or rip this way…
idea. The most stupid one they had ever had. What if he would see Harry anyway? What if he would find out Draco had brought another person along with him? And it wasn't just some other person —
,' she then said. Her hand trembled slightly as she picked up her cup of tea and took a sip. 'He wants to see you; talk to you.' Feeling his legs turn into jelly, Draco had to sit down on the chair next to his mother anyway and stared at the small fountain again. 'It's an opportunity for us to make everything right again; to fix your father's mistakes and yours as well. It's the only way, dear.'
As the boy pulled his face away from Draco's ear again, Draco could see the slight smirk he held. 'How did you—‘
'It calls me its host?' Draco asked with frown eyebrows. A nod followed. 'I thought it was only loyal to You-Know-Who?'
; apparently Krum's Headmaster was expecting Krum to do his very best and out-stand all the other Champions. If he would succeed, Draco didn't know as he remained in the tent this time around at well. Fleur was becoming more and more nervous by the minute and even though she had told Draco many times before that what she had in store for the dragon was a very simple spell; it still seemed to bother her that there was always the

was the most handsome out of all. His friends couldn't fake a beautiful pearl complexion like he had nor his beautiful silver Veela-like hair.
Four cages appeared behind a few bushes, and within them was the source of the flames; dragons. Draco didn't know how to feel at the sight of the creatures; even though his name meant dragon, he never saw one in real life before and also hadn't really planned to ever meet one. Yet there they were; standing before him and growling into the night. Madame's eyes seemed to lit up though, at the sight of the creatures. She on the other hand had always been fond of large winged animals. '
because they simply were. He himself had tried to dress up a little more decently for another visit to the blond as he felt too professional in his Auror robes the previous time. But his burgundy pair couldn't compete with Malfoy's tailored ones. Shiny silver buttons and those delicate snakes, hiding within the seams.
'I'd love to go with you, Harry,' Draco interrupted him.
'I wouldn't dare,' was Harry's answer before he turned around again and walked away.
The library was empty beside from a fourth year girl with lovely brown curls. She sat bent over an old book and followed the lines of words with her finger as she read them. Draco recognized her as Hermione Granger, one of Harry's best friends. It then struck him that he indeed hadn't seen her at the Gryffindor's table. Perhaps she had some homework she felt like doing during her lunch-break.
With footsteps as light as feathers they descended the stairs with Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage levitating behind them. Draco led the way as if he was the one who lived at the Dursleys' since he was born and not Harry, remembering the way perfectly. He murmured things about how hideous and tasteless the decoration was before unlocking the front door, pushing Harry out of the house into one of Petunia's flower beds. 'How are we getting away from here? The Knight Bus?' Harry asked.
'Shut your mouth you filthy betrayer!' Called the boy's response. Pure hate was readable in the boy's eyes like a fire that was unwilling to be extinguished. He noticed Draco staring at his burn wounds; at his face that had once been as pale and porcelain-like as that of Draco himself. 'Take a good look indeed, to what

'Harry,' he then called out to the boy. He still didn't lift up his eyes but answered with a questioned

, Draco wouldn't just disappear like that again.
Harry could feel his face heat up and his cheeks flush as he glanced at Draco's equally red face. He climbed up onto the pier and reached out his hand to help Draco get on it as well; the gesture made the blond's face even redder. As they shook off some of the water from their clothes, Harry basically got
'One more thing, Dolores,' Dumbledore then said. The small woman turned herself around again, her bow swinging from left to right by the quick turn. 'You're fired.'
As the forest grew thicker and darker, Draco started to worry that whatever it was Hagrid wanted to show Madame, might not be what she had expected. Draco was still confused as why he had to join Madame and Hagrid on this kind of
Visions of blood. Crimson on his hands.
Telling himself that Harry wouldn't be
Draco swore his cheeks turned a blush pink at those words, so he focused his eyes on Harry's hand, still placed upon his shoulder. How dearly he wished he didn’t turn red so quick. ‘But— don’t you want your friends their help instead?’
,’ Draco told him. Harry remained silent as he awaited his story. ‘
'A living thing?' What kind of plan had this boy been given? 'As in an animal or a creature? A
But Harry didn't even have to think about his answer. A bright smile appeared on the boy's face again as he placed a hand on Draco's shoulder. ‘Of course! I must admit I was absolutely

thing was. 'The unknown will be awaiting you and it is your task to fight it and obtain the Golden Egg.'
By the time the sun started to rise again, they had completed translating the first five chapters, and were now animatedly talking about the differences between the French wizarding world and the English one. They were talking so loudly that they almost didn't hear Harry's faint moan — the poor boy whom they had abandoned after moving themselves to the table. The second moan Draco caught though, and he immediately hurried himself to Harry, taking his hand in his again. '
Draco drops the mirror to the floor, hands, arms, everything feeling so weak. He wants to cry but tears don't want to come anymore, he wants to be angry but can’t find the words to be so. As he sits there on the floor, figuring out his emotions, he feels a hand go through his hair. And when he looks up it’s into green emeralds behind golden spectacles; Potter’s soft and- and
' followed by an exclamation mark, a badge that every Hogwarts student seemed to wear. Draco even caught a few of his girls pinning one on their chest, but at the sight of it alone — them making holes in their fine silk robes — Draco had banned them from their figures, carriage and overall life immediately.
They had started to make plans almost immediately after finding the whereabouts of the locket — at least, the person it was with. Of course there was no certainty of Bellatrix and Voldemort being at the manor, or the locket itself all-together, though the three of them knew there was no way around visiting the place anyway. They didn't have any other leads for the remaining horcruxes, and therefore it seemed the best to go with their gut-instinct.
A bright blue light had shone their way as he and Cedric faced a dead end of the maze; the Triwizard Cup at its end. And they had played it fair by taking off, reaching out their hands and taking ahold of the Cup at the same time.
I decided to leave Moaning Myrtle out of the bathroom part as I find her quite... annoying? Perhaps others will miss her in this fic but I think the focus should be on Harry, Draco and the mermaid; not on Harry, Draco and Moaning Myrtle. But that's just my opinion and it is my fic so I guess that's that then :)
as he fell to the ground with Draco falling down right next to him as well. They both crawled away to one of the fireplaces, hiding behind the small wall as they watched the battle increase in intensity with every passing second. A brighter green light then filled the atrium as flames took Bellatrix away — the murderess of Harry's godfather escaping from the scene. Harry wanted to stand up again, go behind her, but Draco pulled him down. 'You can't leave now, Harry!' he told him, his grey eyes looking into his.
? Did something happen to Dolohov?”
? The fact that he didn't know the reason
Standing up, Draco walked over to another tree trunk they had dragged to their tent and placed the locket upon it. His hands were shaking. Eyes glanced at Harry for instructions. 'I believe the way to open it, is to say something to it in parseltongue,' the boy guessed. Draco could see in his eyes he wasn't quite sure about it himself, but it didn't sound that absurd either. 'On the count of three, I'll tell it to open — and you just have to hit it with the sword, alright?'
'And what is that?' Harry asked curiously, resting his face upon a hand.
Draco clenched his jaw as he thought about his mother writing that letter to him with the Dark Lord behind her; reading every sentence she was writing down. Not to mention he had probably also been the one to tell her that Harry was in Gryffindor; and therefore Draco would most likely be as well. 'Should I keep them?' Draco asked, sighing as he felt the wool of the berets in his hands. He had missed wearing hats; non of his pastel blue ones matched with the burgundy colored robes he had to wear.
and Draco's controlled and just
And when Malfoy pulls up his sleeve after giving a raged reaction to Harry's unwanted worry, all hope of a healthy and totally fine Malfoy fades away. The exposed skin that Malfoy shows to them is as black as the night, almost blending in with the dark vibes of the drawing room. Harry can't even
Practicing the Bubble-Head charm became something Draco wanted to avoid rather than look forward to. Prior weeks he hadn't been able to wait until lunch was over to go spend some time with Harry by the Lake, help him with his task and talk about many other things afterwards. He had told the boy stories about Beauxbatons, his parents, his personal life. It had all been so natural and comfortable to talk to Harry about everything; and Harry had felt the same way. At least, Draco had thought he did.
When Harry woke up, Draco was still asleep in his arms. Harry watched how his close to white eyelashes were closed against his pearl skin, his breathing steady and lips more pink than ever because of all the kisses he had stolen from the boy. Harry pressed his lips against the boy's forehead and took in the strong lemony scent that always lingered around him. Draco slowly opened his eyes, awoken by Harry's soft kiss. He looked up into Harry's eyes and he realized that it was the first time he saw Draco look up instead of looking down; the tall blond that he was.
, Harry thought to himself,
. He tried to stay calm, told himself if he tried now, it would be too soon. But the pain in his scar only increased by the second, and he was quickly running out of breath. It was as if Voldemort himself was pressing a finger on his scar again — was physically there and casting the Cruciatus Curse upon his figure. As his lungs started to protest, and he swore he could see a vague green light starting to glow from underneath Draco's palms — he grabbed for the locket around the boy's neck.
Silence. There was no answer nor sound; only the rustling of trees and a few crows making noises in the background. Draco noticed his hand was slightly shaking and as he started to lower his wand, a pair of green eyes behind round spectacles appeared in his Lumos' light.
A world slowly took shape around him, from a blurry image to the strokes of an impressionist his painting to clear reality. He was outside, had landed next to a tree he had sat many times before with his friends — a tree close to the Lake with the best view on the school's squid. Only this time a little boy no older than eleven was seated against its trunk, reading a book on Potions. His black, greasy hair made Harry immediately recognize him as a younger version of Snape.
, want to ask you,

, remember that,' Draco replied as he kissed Harry again. It was already the hundredth kiss he had received from the blond that morning and he couldn't get enough.
‘They aren't even trying to cure this curse, are they?' he asks. 'I’m the only Death Easter standing, just like you said. And I’m not even standing that well, am I?'
His mind then wanders off to Pibbly’s announcement; a pair of Aurors are currently in his house. It’s strange, Draco finds, as they’d never cared about him before.
It took some effort for Harry to sit up straight; to find the motivation and energy to start a new day — a new
Ron turned himself towards Hermione with a look of betrayal. '
And as they ran back, through that dark tunnel, Harry realized that what was happening was what Draco had wanted to warn him for; dark magic was surrounding him and his cousin.
“Just what I need,” he whispers to himself, petting the owl hesitantly. The Snow Owl hoots in response to the affection and closes its yellow eyes for a fraction longer, almost as in appreciation. “I can't believe you're Malfoy's owl,” Harry whispers to it. The owl just lets out another 'hoot', as if it itself can't quite believe it either.
The other boy followed and seated himself next him; pulled out a stroll of parchment with scribbles and drawings to hold in front of Dumbledore's eyes. 'See; I've been studying them for a while now and I must admit they can indeed be inventive but listen—'
Of course Draco could go home as well, to his mother whom was probably all alone in England's most gruesome manor. But what if
Luna,

The man returned a few moments later; a large bottle of water in one hand and the other holding a plate with slices of bread. 'I don't have a lot of food,' he explained while dropping it onto the table. 'But this might be enough.'
.' She laid a long emphasis on the word brave, giggling again and having some of her friends join her.
Green emeralds were shining in the pale moonlight that got casted through one of the windows of Grimmauld Place's bedroom. A few portraits, taken off the walls and turned around to grumble against nothing — a few books and pieces of clothing shattered across the floor. Two boys tangled as one, wishing that there were no dark days coming ahead, that there was no devil whom dressed in pink robes and that the Christmas holidays could last forever. A cold wind blew into the room from underneath the door, sending shivers down their spines but they had each other's warmth — a warmth that would be strong enough, they knew, to get them through the cold days ahead.
We must!' Flicking his wand at the fire with an aggression flowing from his arm, he could see how a single flame extinguished before getting revived by the many others again.
A smile was visible on the boy's face and Harry leaned a little closer to give Draco a kiss before the blond hurriedly hid his letter away underneath his Potions book. '
'I know but I shouldn't be acting like this. I—‘
Another sigh escapes as he send Pibbly back go his unwanted guests with a wave of his hand.
Draco himself chose to wear one of his finer robes again; a navy blue set with the slightest silver pattern of snakes visible on it. A plain navy stroke of fabric draped over his right shoulder and a prominent black collar sticking out underneath the heap to snug up to his jawline. Robes that hide away as much of his skin as possible are his favorite; minimal exposure to the outside world.
, he thought as he cursed Fleur in his head. Seated upon the small stool he stared into the mirror above his desk, long and pale fingers gently brushing through his hair. He looked tired but his eyes were still wide awake; ready to capture more of the beauty that was Scotland. The beauty that was Hogwarts.
waited for those thoughts to occur, the terrible itching starts once again.
‘Then those rumors were wrong. Or don’t you believe me,
‘It’s alright, Harry,' Draco assured him. He placed a hand on his shoulder and gave him a weak smile. 'Being called a Veela is more of a compliment to me.’
' Draco mumbled against the soft wool of Harry's jumper.
‘Oh, Arthur shut your mouth,’ Molly interfered. ‘He is nothing like his father — aren’t you, my boy?’
'Won't you participate in the Tournament?' he asked Draco. A small smile was visible on his face, his eyes staring directly into Draco's. And there it was again; another jump of his heart.
'Harry, we—,’ Hermione began but Harry waved her words away before pushing Draco into another room and following him, closing the door behind them.
A wax seal on the owl's small package told him otherwise — it was a gift from his mother. With a sigh, Draco gave his barn owl a piece of his toast and saw how the creature flapped her wings and flew away with some of the other owls. 'Do you know from who it is?' Harry asked, eyes glancing at the small package with curiosity.
“Don’t catch flies, Potter,” Malfoy mutters at him. Realizing that he'd been staring quite frankly with his mouth wide open, he closes it. A shiver runs over Malfoy’s figure then, and the blond takes a deep breath.
you."
, just call me Tonks.'
And with those words said, Draco opened up the first book to point out some important chapters Harry should read himself. As they flipped through the pages he also gave him a little summary of each book and the most important aspects of them. Whenever he couldn't remember the English word he tried to explain it to Harry with completely absurd gestures that only made the green-eyed boy laugh. Draco found himself laughing quite a lot as well; either because of Harry's comments, questions or because of the boy's laugh itself. As they sat there in the dingy pub with their heads together, Draco felt their friendship grow and couldn't help but feel proud of succeeding in his plan to get to know the boy from the tales.
was the first thing Harry could think.
Draco rose from his seat now as well, picked up the book and placed it back onto the small table. 'I don't know,' he answered Hermione, for the others remained their quiet selves. His eyes then stared up at the portrait again; squinted at the sight of two black dots slowly coming into view. 'Is that—' he started, but the others had already joined him by his side.
Draco felt his heart melt a little at that soft look Harry was giving him. Harry had observed him just as that Durmstrang boy had done. He had cared; he had cared about the little details that made him
"You're immortal?" Harry now gasped, trying to get his mind off the
Reaching the common room — a near-perfect resemblances of the one they had in their carriage the year before — Draco could already spot the twins from afar. They were sprawled across one of the sofas, two legs hanging from the side, the other pair laid upon the small marble table. With a book in front of their faces, Draco guessed that the twins hadn't studied again. He cleared his throat as he neared, two sets of eyes slowly appearing from behind Potion books. 'I see someone hasn't studied?' he said to them, a cheeky smile lingering upon his lips.
Nothing happens for a while; he doesn't feel anything nor see anything special he isn't supposed to see. He just feels the same as he did before; empty, hollow and still on the verge of Death. Potter stares so intensely at him as if to make the spell react by his fearful look. After another few minutes he relaxes his intense stair and his muscles, slumping his shoulder and taking a step closer to Draco.
'Find him,' Harry told Kreacher and watched how the house-elf diapparated; to where, he had no idea, but he hoped he would be able to find the thief.
He moved his feet and was launched faster through the water than ever before. It made him want to smile but knowing that he only had an hour for the task, he put his happy feelings away for later and moved his feet as fast as he could, further into the darkness of the lake.
Draco nodded. 'Beauxbatons is under the same protection spells as Hogwarts — and we don't have that Umbridge here.'
'You can't what?' Green eyes tried to look in his but Draco just sighed and buried his face even deeper.
'It was a Christmas gift,' the boy mumbled between kisses. 'From Ron's mother.'
"Will you only get children to guard? Or older people too?" Harry decided to ask instead, and a certain relief was readable on Draco's face after that question reached his ears.
'Priorities, Harry!
were afraid that the trust wouldn’t last; that there would be no other solution than to leave England.
, we'll read books on possible spells he could use or potions,' Draco told her.
Professor Slughorn, apparently the new Potions master, then clapped his hands and announced the class would start in a few seconds. That seemed to shake most students out of their curiosity and made them grab all their stuff; prepare their cauldrons and open their potion books at the right page.
He heard a woman's voice scream, followed by flashes of green and red. They all ducked to the ground, waited for the smoke to fade away so they could face their opponents. Meanwhile Harry tried to defend both himself as his friends, whom had lost their wands to the Snatchers earlier. They crawled across the room, rose to their feet again as the smoke was finally gone. With an
Draco glanced over his shoulder, looked straight into Madame's eyes that radiated an invisible smirk — and Draco returned it with a look as well before leaving the room with Harry by his side.
. He’d flown high — higher than the top of the Manor and almost above the clouds on his first broom. A little boy feeling free; as if he had been the most powerful wizard already, even though he hadn’t even owned a wand yet. But that feeling of freedom had faded fast once he’d got enrolled into Wizarding School. All of the sudden there had been the pressure of responsibility and honor placed upon his shoulders. Father — never proud. Mother — worried about him all the time.
An explanation here, a pointed finger there and a few questioning glances later they finally arrived in the east tower where Madame's office and chambers could be found. Almost everyone was short of breath as they reached the top of the 8th staircase; Draco forever wondering how Madame did such a thing more than once a day.
Harry stopped in his pace to look at Ron. 'You saw Darco?'
, said with his calm voice now a little less calm. His eyes were set worried, and as he frowned his white eyebrows, he seemed to inspect every inch of Harry's face. "You are a very strange boy, Harry.

Hermione nodded, seemed relieved at Harry understanding her theory. 'I've been reading about prophecies for hours now,' she then said, opening the book on her lap again and gesturing at the other two books she had abandoned next to her.'
secrets?' Draco asked, genuinely confused.
'You know about Idel's task?'
‘No, no. Don’t worry. It can be our secret.’ A smile lingered upon Harry's lips and his eyes were twinkling. Was the boy proud to share a secret with Draco? It almost seemed that way.
It took a while for those words to sink in and for Draco to form a reaction upon them. Should he be happy? Should he be
Blinking a few times to get the sleep out of his eyes, Draco hushed the boy by pressing a finger against his lips. 'That's very good of you, Harry — but keep yourself a bit more quiet.'

Only a quarter before the start of the second task, Harry finally gave up his search and moved over to the pier. On his way there he ran into Ron who seemed to have been waiting for him. 'There you are!' he called out. Harry glanced over at a bundle of slimy, grey-green
'He has
'Of course I would react this way! Voldemort killed my parents, Draco. And you're defending a man that was part of it.' Harry looked away for just a second but it was enough for Draco to know he didn't even dare to look at him anymore — because he had become disgusted of him. Disgusted because he resembled the man that had killed his parents and therefore had killed his future.
There was apparently nothing to be insecure about, as the boy devoured Draco's chest with his eyes alone already. His warm hands found their way on Draco's hips and he pulled him closer, kissed his neck and made Draco's knees tremble slightly. Draco didn't know where this was going but he didn't care anymore, could only think about Harry and his hands and— All caught up in their intimate moment, they both hadn't heard the upcoming footsteps upon the stairs until someone cleared his throat. 'Er — Harry?'
.' With a flick of his golden wand, all of Harry's stuff gathered themselves in his trunk and with a clicking sound it closed, Hedwig's cage atop of it and everything.
He took his hat off, placed it on his desk and untied his hair. The long silver locks sprung free and fell down his shoulders like water fell down a waterfall. Reaching out to grab his comb from his desk, he noticed it was still gone.
Dark clouds seemed to clear from Harry's eyes and the sun shone brightly through his emeralds. He took off his invisibility cloak and held out his Golden Egg to Draco. ‘Is that why I had to bring the Egg?’
As they reached the front of the Hall, bowing to their audience, Madame Maxime was announced and strode down the Hall with Draco by her side. She beamed and so did he as he felt all eyes on the pair of them. Some faces were shocked by how tall his Headmistress was, others were surprised to see Beauxbatons also had a male student in their midst. Reaching the middle of the Hall, Madame stopped her pace to let Draco take a step before her. Opening his arms with both palms of his hands held up to the ceiling, the floating candles unlit themselves followed by every single star displayed in the magical night sky. A few students let out a scream because of the sudden darkness but Draco quickly made their worries disappear; out of his left hand he made a glowing butterfly appear, fluttering its wings and leaving trails of brightly glowing stars and glitter behind. The beautiful creature made its way throughout the Great Hall, lighting up the faces of a few students before landing on Draco's palm and returning all the light to the Hall again.
A nudge in his side followed. 'Don't say that; no-one will die.'
'Don't worry, Madame will fix it — I'm sure,'
He looked at the green-eyed boy over his shoulder and saw him seated on one of the beds, face a paler shade than usual and worry visible on his face.
'I may have been a little wealthy at the age of 11. Straightforward. Smart. Slytherin. Not to mention incredibly talented and fully aware of that. But, I must admit that your denial made me push that little extra harder every day. It made me want to be better than you or any of your friends at as much as I could.'
Wiping away the sweat from his forehead, he sat up straight and looked around his room. The pale moonlight shone inside through the small window, assuring him of no other presence than himself. Relieved, Draco laid his head back down on his pillow.
'It's not like I wear casual clothes that often anyway; I usually wear my school robes. And if anyone's looking like an imbecile, than it's you.'
Draco turned himself towards Harry, a bit hesitant. He had become scared of having to look into the boy's green eyes; not knowing what emotion he would stumble upon. But the boy had his eyes cast upon the silver instrument again. 'I have indeed,' he told his Headmaster before he finally answered Draco's searching eyes. 'It's — it's because you were afraid I wouldn't love you anymore. Afraid I would compare you to your father and—,' Harry's hand trembled as he wiped a strand of hair out of his eye, a tear leaving the same one. 'And that's just what I did, didn't I?'
How did you find out such a thing?’
'I-I don't mean I don't want you by my side, though. It's just… weird, I guess,' he heard the boy say.
More mumbled latin words were pronounced before Snape tucked his wand away. 'He would have never been able to complete the task,' he said as he rose to his feet again. 'And you should have never been able to cast that spell either.'
'Would there perhaps be a way out through your vault?' Ron speculated, but Draco had no idea for he had only visited the family's vault once when he was a child. On the same day he had visited Bellatrix' vault. Another place where toys had greeted him — toys he hadn't been able to play with.
Potter now also bites his lip, eyes away from Draco as if he doesn't dare to look into the face of disappointment.

I must kill. I must kill the boy!
Malfoy’s face reddens a bit, as if he’s part ashamed part furious at Harry for making such a comment in his own house. In the end he just sneers, keeping the grin on his face. “You think so, Potter? Since when do you care what I look like?” He now turns around, placing his foot on the first marble step. “Please follow me. And be quiet will you? I don't want Mother to know you're here.”
And you saw him in your nightmares? With that you mean—'
? And that moron was to be called an official Death Eater?
Draco took a deep breath and scratched his forehead. His eyes glanced at the mermaid above them, brightly colored in glass as she still brushed her hair. ‘Flying,’ he then said as he looked back at Harry.
Harry nodded. 'But, what about my trunk and the cage?'
Two pale hands of opposite sides — reaching for each other in despair.
. It had been strange to see his own face, his own pair of eyes, his mess of a hair everywhere they secretly went.
. As a reminder of everything.'
It had been a deal he had made with Raphael; to let no-one else enter his room once he would return from his so-called morning walk, and pretend that Draco was in there alone. Raphael had found the whole secret mission rather exciting, but had been disappointed to hear that the smuggled person would be hidden underneath an invisibility cloak.
, he thought.
Amidst it all, he also saw something else that drew his attention; Draco was there in the memories of Snape. Of course that wasn't possible — Harry realized that fast enough — but it was Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy, who seemed to be in his seventh year. Long, silver hair waved behind him as he hurried himself over to Snape after being hit by a Jelly-Leg Jinx. He seemed to soothe the boy, whispered to him that he would teach him some useful defense spells if wanted. Harry glanced from the pair to the caster of the Jinx, only to see his father yet again laughing with his friends. Had Snape and Lucius Malfoy been friends as well?
They arrived around midnight, the moon shining its brightest and throwing near-blue light upon the chateau. In the book
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Potter sighs and slumps in his chair a little. ‘I didn’t read that, I must admit. But maybe there’s another spell or another way... there must at least be something in the damned book that’ll help you.’
Around an hour later two Wizards Harry vaguely recognized appeared at the house, ushered the Dursleys to their car with their belongings in a trailer behind. Uncle Vernon had nearly gotten a heart-attack when they had shrunken a few of their furniture pieces — saying that they weren't planning on driving back-and-forth six times. With closed eyes and a face the color of a tomato, the Wizards had managed to get Mr. and Mrs. Dursley willingly into their car. Only Dudley was left, lingering next to the vehicle with a confused look upon his chubby face. As he was about to step into the car, he suddenly froze — glanced from his parents to Harry and back. 'Isn't Harry coming with us?' he asked, obviously still confused.
Tears started to well up in his eyes as more terrible memories, accompanied by fake ones he had never seen before, flashed by. He saw how Harry hadn't missed him at all while he had been gone. How he had no regret in shooting that terrible curse at him on the Astronomy Tower. How he kissed another boy with an unrecognizable face. 'Stop!
Draco smirked. 'I don't know what for! Go to bed,
Draco was still surrounded by the smell of pine, his skin in touch with the softest wool he had ever felt. The red and gold jumper, which he had made fun of at first, appeared to be one of the better things in life. And of course, that had nothing to with the fact that it was
The curse hadn't stopped spreading further after the trial, but had continued its mission with great urgency. Draco's entire hand had turned a dark shade of black — as dark as a burned piece of coal. He could bet that it sometimes even smelled like burned coal.
Fury seemed to reach its peak as Umbridge her face turned the color of a tomato — perhaps even brighter. 'Fine,' she concluded before turning around and making her way through the dining chamber again.
I really hoped you enjoyed this Yule Ball chapter! It was quite exciting, no? With their first kiss and everything... and them fighting... once again. Please understand I had to make it a bit dramatic otherwise it wouldn't be truly Draco, would it? Also, as I mentioned before in my first chapter's notes I'm really not much of a 'smut' writer but I tried my best. They're also underaged so I feel like going too far is a bit too much for my liking. But I hope you liked the fluffy-ness of it??
But now, it is nothing like it anymore.
A sneer from Ron followed as the boy crossed his arms. 'You think we're endangering ourselves for you? That Mad-Eye
This chapter is basically about what happened before the Minisitry battle and a little bit of hanging around at the Beauxbatons castle -- nothing special, but definitely necessary to wrap up 'year 5'. I might speed up year 6 a little but I'm not quite sure about it yet (inspiration hasn't come to me; my head is already making up ideas for year 7).
Two months had passed since they had arrived at Grimmauld Place, a poster now on every wall in the magical world declaring Harry James Potter as
André's skin was the opposite of Draco's; a beautiful dark brown but eyes as bright as the ocean. He must admit the boy had always been competition to him when it came to whom looked best of the boys. Not to mention that there were
The pain is indescribable, and he soon finds his eyes watering because of it. Tears are running down his cheeks now, panic slowly making him hyperventilate. This
Frowning his eyebrows at first, unsure what Draco was talking about, Harry looked down at his arm in Draco's hand — glowing red of burns and forming scars. It had been caused by him supporting Draco on the way home, and back then it had felt so incredibly painful — but his mind had shut it out, had made the fact that angels existed a priority above pain. "Oh," Harry commented on the matter, "I completely forgot."
‘Ron!' Harry called behind his friend, but he was already too far away. He let out a sigh and turned himself back to Draco.
Taken aback by her words, Ron seemed to be shut up but mumbled a few more words anyway. 'He shouldn't be calling you beautiful either.' Fortunately, Hermione didn't hear him.
Harry let out a short laugh. 'I must admit they did look quite scary, right? Can't believe I have to face one within weeks!' His earlier smile turned into a grimace and he looked down at the books again. 'You must tell me everything you know.'
' Madame asked, a bit surprised and turning herself to Draco again.
Draco slowly nodded his head, even though he wasn't feeling alright at all. He then glanced over his shoulder and saw the duo fighting over whom would get to use the new looking book and whom the old one. 'Why don't they have a book of their own?' Draco asked, changing the subject.
A fast beating heart. A hand tightly grabbing him by his arm; dragging him along. Draco closed his eyes while he felt adrenaline rush through his veins.
Harry apparently seemed to know what his strength was as he didn't have to think about it for longer than a few seconds. 'Flying. I'm good at flying,' he answered.
and the sound made Draco realize what he had done. '
It also seemed as if every thought of Harry was slowly fading away — the little details he always remembered so well suddenly gone and lost. The few memories he had left played in his head with the narrative voice of the Dark Lord; whispering words that only meant bad things — said bad things about Harry and how he was using Draco, had always used him for everything. He had used him for the Triwizard Tournament — used him to get away from his Muggle-family — to battle against the Dark Lord at the Ministry.
clear to someone. Draco knew what that tone meant to him; if he made the mistake of abandoning and lying to the girls one more time, his time at Hogwarts was over.
'I bet it was enough for him to see what kind of a man
,’ was all he said.
'That you look adorable, Harry,' Draco translated for the boy, closing the space between them.
Dumbledore had been the only one able to pull him away, drag him back towards the castle and help him to calm down, professors by his side helping to control the grieving boy. And Draco's feet had followed them without hesitation, ran behind his sorrowful lover to protect him. But the vile look in Harry's green eyes that the boy had thrown in his direction, had been a look Draco had never received from him before. It had stopped his feet immediately, froze him to the spot and had made him unable to move any further. It had been a look of pure
now the locket had found a host that was incredibly close with its target. 'It's trying to kill me,' Harry repeated out loud, getting a nod of Hermione's head in return. 'And you think if I get intimate with Draco, he will take the bite to be alone with me and try?'
'If my patronus is a butterfly?' Draco finished his sentence.
bloody house!” Pulling up his left sleeve, he shows his left arm to the pair. And although hens raging, his chest heaving under his anger, he can’t help but beg for the concealment charm to be doing its magic — and show them an ordinary Dark Mark instead of what his own eyes see.
'Obliviate is quite close, yes, but he still knows too many things to have been Obliviated,' she explained. 'Just try to get the locket off his neck first, we'll then see wether he changes or not.'
Draco felt his heart skip a beat.
Harry didn't seem to realize his friends were still there, as he first frowned and then pulled up his eyebrows. ‘Oh, yes. Of course.’
"And the
How strange Draco had been acting ever since his arrival at Hogwarts; he simple didn't seem to be the Draco he once knew anymore. The first two months he even looked like a mess as well; almost the exact mirroring of what Harry looked like on a daily basis. His hair uncombed, robes put on in a hurry and an eternal sulk on his face as if he truly
That simple comment seemed to explode fireworks in Castor's brain. Taking a step forward and trying to intimidate Draco with his short figure and angry-looking face, Castor was quite the sight. 'No need to get so upset, Castor. Aren't we equals after all?'
With his eyes opened for only a quarter of their size, he started to tell in as great detail as he could about his vision; how he had seen Voldemort in a furious state. 'He's upset. Upset that we have destroyed so many horcruxes already. He had no idea.' Apparently the monster had visited every location of the horcruxes they had already found; only to find them gone, taken away from him while he had remained in the unknown. 'I saw a flash of a castle as well,' Harry then said. 'Hogwarts.'
It was indeed like how they danced; their kisses. Harry's clumsy and
Whom were the others exactly?
Fleur nodded and lay herself back down on her pillow, giving Draco's hand a slight squeeze before letting it go. Draco also rose from her bed and was about to leave her room when he spotted a familiar item placed upon her desk. ‘I believe that belongs to me,’ he said with a sneer as he retrieved his golden comb. ‘

'Can you cast a patronus? I know it's a difficult spell but—‘
?' Fleur's words were a relief but the tension between Madame and him still hung above their heads. He felt her eyes shift from his face to his jumper and back, judging without truly doing so. Unreadable, the woman was.
You do, what?' Draco asked him.
"Let me go, Dudley," Harry resisted weakly, letting out a sigh.
Draco shrugged to that. '
'Because they were battling against Voldemort, Dolores,' Dumbledore simply explained before he took another bite of his waffles — not caring about the tiny, angry lady in front of him.
Castor coughed, and harry swore he could hear a faint 'thanks' hidden in it somewhere. Draco seemed to ignore it though; his hands placed on his knees while taking deep breaths. 'Draco?'

'Thanks, Ron. Can you maybe look into this new cursed corpse department? I already did some research but am still really stuck at where in the Ministry I can find them or what it is exactly that they do.'

'I believe you, Harry.'

It doesn't take Draco long to choose what music piece he wants to play. His hand almost immediately reaches out for one of his favorites;
The sparkle in Fleur's eyes faded away and so did her smile. Draco pushed her hand off his arm and turned his head away once again. He hadn't forgotten how she had talked about Harry or acted towards him. Besides, she could ask any boy from Hogwarts or Durmstrang that she wanted and he would most likely say yes. She simply didn't need Draco and Draco simply didn't need her.
'I don't believe—'
‘Never do that to me again,’ Draco said to Harry. His voice sounded weird — out of place in the silence.
"Draco, are you alright?" Her eyes are full of worry as she drops down in a hunched position next to him, laying her hand upon his arm.
Draco shook his head. ‘If it’s about the scar then
'And I deserved it.'
The others were still talking to the twins in the hallway; now having some other students joining them in their conversation. Wherever they had suddenly come from, Draco had no idea. They were exchanging stories about their school; trying to convince the other that their school was better and why that was exactly. Only Ron seemed to be distracted by a subject other than information about Beauxbatons; he had rather become interested in the girls again and was showing off the new scars he had gained from the battle — ones in a circular shape as if an octopus had tried to eat him alive. It didn't seem to work though, as the girls slowly backed away from him and hid themselves a bit behind the twins — glanced nervously and helpless in Draco's direction.
'Don't say a word about my father!' An anger he had felt waiting in his chest earlier had now come to the surface, escaped from his mouth at the mention of the father he had never got to know. Hearing his professor ramble such a thing about the man was too much for Harry together with the exposed memories of him and his lover.
'You don't see it, do you?' Draco then asked, biting his teeth as his cheek slowly turned red.
But it didn't matter how they called him; each name always sent shivers down Draco's spine. Father often told him not to fear the man; apparently Draco's Father was sure he would return in the future and that they had to be his ally in order to survive. When Draco had asked his parents why that was exactly, his Mother had just replied that his Father had made a mistake in the past; a mistake that had tied him to the evil ruler for life.
someone. But he now understood and by the watery look in the boy's eyes; the feeling must be returned.
Non of the girls seemed to understand either, but they didn't like talking about the Tournament anymore. Cedric's death had shocked them all, especially Fleur. Beside from mourning her fellow Champion's death, she also remained in shock from being close to getting murdered by an evil plant.

'Today, you will become one of
The flames colored red again as Dumbledore turned around, facing the Goblet and waiting for the next Champion to be chosen. As the fire shot up again, a parchment butterfly came fluttering down. Draco's heart almost stopped beating as he recognized the parchment not only from his dream but also from Fleur's hand when she had put it in the Goblet herself last Friday. He felt Fleur squeeze his hand with great force when Dumbledore read her name out loud. 'The Champion for Beauxbatons is…
Harry has been working as an Auror for 3 years now, after finishing his 2 years of training together with Ron. A good 6 months after the War, they decided to ask Kingsley if it was possible for them to join Auror training without finishing their Newts.
Draco braided one side of his hair into multiple braids, making an intricate design. The rest of his long, silver locks he tucked away underneath a white hat he had bought especially for formal occasions, and which matched perfectly with his beautiful robes. They were a delicate pale blue with intricate silver and golden accents. The fabric glittered in the right light, and they were simply more mesmerizing than any of the girls' dresses. Draco liked to brag with that fact, quite a lot.
A week later, late in the afternoon, Harry finds himself sprawled across the sofa; book in one hand and a mug of homemade chocolate milk in the other. If there's one thing Harry thought he could do best, it was probably making homemade hot chocolate. Something about melting the chocolate, adding milk at the right time and then pouring it into a mug to let it set for a few minutes was enchanting to the man. It made his mind at peace and reminded him of Christmas days at Hogwarts.
Fortunately he gets snapped out of his sorrowful thoughts by Malfoy angrily pulling his sleeve back down. And then Ron's comment makes him feel dumbfounded. How could he

. He glanced over at Hermione and Ron, whom returned his look with worry. They both seemed to know just like Harry did that Draco would recognize him in an instant; deformed or not. Yet Harry couldn't help but feel a certain warmth fill his insides — a dark cloud was slowly drifting away at the knowledge of life.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
'Why were you wearing it before? Couldn't sleep?'
'It is,' the stubborn boy replied. 'I should've known better.'
A sigh almost escaped Draco's lips, but he contained himself. 'If I had been in your place, I probably would've casted a spell as well.'
'You're using it!' Is Potter's immediate reaction. A smile appears on his face, making his lightning bolt scar a little more crooked. Draco never noticed that before, but it's an interesting detail to the man's face.
'I just want what's best for the school — and
'Don't worry, I have already read them for you,' Draco answered him, putting on a content smile.
that could work.
Harry could feel his heart beat in his throat as he stared into the darkness beneath him. The Black Lake had never looked so frightening before. The slimy substance in his hands also didn't really make him feel any better.
Draco glanced at the man over his shoulder. He had a content smile on his face as he took over the dance floor with Madame. ‘Well, he seems like
Madame saw this as her chance to quickly look for Draco. She found him still hidden behind a tree and looking at the dragons with large eyes. 'You know what to do?' was all she asked and Draco nodded. After giving the dragons another glance, he ran back to the carriage as fast as his legs could take him. Holding on to his hat with one hand and keeping his dressing gown closed with the other, he stormed through the dark forest and over the Hogwarts grounds.
As all the girls hopped into the carriage one after the other, there was only one blue violet left, a little different than when he had arrived. But was it so bad to be different? Draco thought not as he waved at Harry and all the new people he had met that year, waved them away into future meetings and future adventures. Because of that, many would follow. The door closed behind him and Draco hurried over to his room, opening his window to wave at Harry again. To wave at the smiling boy with his red and gold tie, his messy raven-colored hair and green eyes gleaming of tears. He would miss Draco and Draco would miss him. But it wasn't a good-bye, they both knew that, as their adventure had only just begun.
But Draco wasn't going to die, and he knew that for certain. The Dark Lord wouldn't let him die so quickly over a few sentences that hadn't even exposed the full plan. No, Draco would die when he would spill every single detail of it out on paper or with his tongue; the specks of blood probably mixing itself with the ink then or with every word that escaped his lips.
'She probably didn't get the chance,' Ron replied. 'As quick as that snake is in slithering away.'
Wide awake in seconds Draco started to get dressed, washing his face in the small sink he was provided with and making the small bed he slept in. Orange light shined in through the window, giving his blue robes a golden gleam. With a comb the same gold as reflected he brushed slowly through his long hair, eyes fixed on his reflexion in the mirror. He always found it interesting how his face could look so different when his hair was hung loose, the tips brushing all the way to his elbows. It almost made him look like he was one of the girls.
, not for the ferret,' he says to Harry.
“Are you sure Malfoy is also suffering from the curse, Harry?” Ron asks, his eyes fixated on the portrait of a black cat on one of the walls. “I mean, it's been five years and there hasn't been one report from St. Mungo's asking for a healer to come over to Malfoy Manor. Neither did we receive any reports on the matter. But on the other hand, nobody has heard from the ferret since his trial so maybe he's already dead.”
‘Did it work?’ he asks anxiously and Draco shrugs. He doesn’t know. He-
'I know a way,' Harry answered, taking out the timepiece he got from Draco. It moved slightly, but Harry noticed it was just ticking seconds away like a normal clock would do. 'It's not working,' he said with a sigh — but it was too early; the big hand moved to number twelve all of a sudden, staying there and pointing to the dark aisle in front of them. 'This way!' he announced, already running in the direction the big hand was pointing him in. His feet couldn't keep up with his adrenaline, with his need to bring Draco to safety. He was there; it hadn't been a dream. Turning right and then left again, passing rows and rows of glass orbs in their way, they finally came to a halt in the center where four aisles met. Harry watched how the big hand kept spinning around in circles, declaring that Draco was exactly there were they were standing. 'It doesn't make sense,' he said, sighing deeply. 'He should be here.'
Opening his eyes, he notices that the sun is slowly starting to break through, giving the red roses a yellow gleam. His eyes land upon a beautiful red rose, faced proudly towards the morning sun. He reaches out to touch one of its petals, gently stretching out one of his blackened fingers. Only the tip of his finger is laid atop the delicate rose when it suddenly starts to decay, its petals turning black and sloppy within a second. Draco pulls his hand away in horror as he remains staring at the wilted rose, hanging limp from her stem with tears welling up in his eyes.
Draco met Harry’s eyes again. ‘
Madame Maxime had visited him later that night and had been as furious as the girls; but had understood the reason even better than any of them. Draco had already trusted her with his father's secret, his past, in his first year. It had actually been his mother's idea to tell her, to trust her. And it had been a good idea, it now appeared. Madame had told him not to worry, that she would protect him if things would become different now. But Draco had declined her help, knowing that there was no escape to facing his father this summer again; he knew he had to face him in order to protect his mother. She also had offered to fix his hair, bring it back to it's original length. But that had been another offer Draco had declined; he never wanted to resemble his father again.
'Does… does that mean
'To me it never was a problem,

inner anger and confidence.
It will not! I'll fall again and — and break something or
What was Draco referring to, Harry wondered. What was going to happen, what were they planning? How were they going to silence him? They couldn't just barge into the Dursleys their home and obliviate him just like that, could they? And where was Draco off to? For the second time that day, his thoughts got interrupted by his Muggle family. This time it was Dudley who had come more near with his friends, acting all tough but actually looking like complete idiots.
With a pout he crossed his arms like a lot of other students did. André and Ansel also didn't seemed pleased with the news, as they both were fond of blasting hexes and jinxes at others. Competition was in their blood; as well as in Draco's.
'I'm nothing like my father!' Draco interrupted him, now shouting as well. He slammed Harry's hand away from his chest as he looked into his enraged green eyes.
interesting. 'Er —maybe?'
,' he then said.
“You mean Unspeakable Davis?” Harry guesses and the jailer nods. “What was he scared of? The body or..?”
she had said, but Draco knew that it was a spell that verged a lot of power and wisdom that only a seventh year had learnt about.
'He's always here, Harry. In our heart,' she answered before closing the box again and tucking it away for the next day to come.
The fire they had seen roaring around it now broke free in the house itself; windows shattering and pieces of glass raining down upon the grounds around it. Immediately stopping what he was doing, Draco hurried himself back to the house with Harry by his side. Everyone was outside, fortunately, looking up at what once was their home — and was now being destroyed. Molly Weasley stood defeated next to Ron, glancing up at the structure with tears in her eyes.
Granger apparently found out that there was a similar case to Draco's in Bulgaria. A Wizard had suffered from a blackening curse that eventually led up to his death. The curse was caused by a special Mark he had taken from his Master; an ancient ritual that had gone alright for many centuries prior. But somehow it still had gone wrong; probably due to mispronunciation of some of the bonding spells. The exact details were still very vague and the Golden Trio considered visiting Bulgaria together with Draco if they wouldn't find anything helpful on Dolohov's body. Apparently one of the many Weasels lived in Bulgaria amongst dragons, making it easy for them to arrange a future visit. The thought alone left Draco shivering; even though his name meant dragon, it didn't mean he also liked the fire-blowing creatures that much.
Draco rolled his eyes and tightened his grip around Harry's hand. 'Always so demanding,' he replied. 'But alright.' He then quickened his pace a little and pulled Harry with him; a smile appearing on the boy's face as they basically ran through the hallways of white and blue, passed by a few dormitories to stop at the one Draco identified as his. 'This is my
Yet Draco didn't believe that, and he was right for doing so. A bright flash of red was fired their way and Draco, with his wand still raised, was just a tad fast enough to cast a counter curse and protect both himself as Harry. With Harry's attention now awakened again as well, they stood back to back while glancing around them — their ears trying to catch a hint of where the female Death Eater was hiding herself.
☾ *:･ﾟ✧
Draco squints his eyes, confused by Potter’s tone. It almost seems as if he didn’t meant what said — as if he was telling a lie. As Draco tries to find his eyes, in which truth usually can be found — he knows — he finds that Potter won’t even look at him no more. The man just stands there staring at the ugly carpet again.
a voice then said.
‘He was kind of... shocked,’ Hermione then admitted with a sigh. ‘Wasn’t in here for long — left within minutes.’
Castor put on a little smirk as he took in Draco's robes. 'Aren't those for girls? I swear I've seen my mother wear them once.'
'This,' Ron said, moving it closer to Harry's face to see. 'Is gillyweed, apparently.'
arrived a few minutes earlier than the time Draco told him to come. It was a good surprise though, he had an utter dislike for late-runners.
Reading the reply of the worrying letter he had sent Sirius and Remus; Harry felt a bit better about what he had seen from his father — the memories of Snape's mind. Draco's letter had worried him; made him wonder to why Lucius Malfoy was trying to take his son away from his beloved school. It was a pity that Draco didn't know wether his father was friends with Snape; but at least there was a possibility that Snape had been one of those dark-clothed figures Draco had seen.
'There are many reasons for that, boy… too many to even count on these old fingers.' A silence fell, as all of them seemed to try and figure out what those reasons were exactly; as they had always known their headmaster as a caring person — someone with a good heart. 'But you want to get into Hogwarts, you say? Well, I

judge any thoughts nor form my own opinion on them — I simply read them to know how you're feeling, to know if my Mortal is doing alright." The way Draco explained these things, it made Harry feel as if he was a lab-rat getting studied by a dozen of doctors, every move of him followed. "Would you like me to stop reading your mind, Harry?"
As they passed Hogsmeade station, Harry finally lifted his head to look at Draco. 'I still don't get
A shiver went through his body at the sudden realization, the atmosphere around him shifting from non-existent to a coldness he hadn't felt before. He saw how Hermione rose from her seat, grabbed his jumper from one of the chairs before bringing it over to Draco. 'Here you go,' she said, sitting down on the other bunk bed opposite the one Draco was seated by.
Crouch gathered everyone by calling their names, pulling their arms and pushing them into a circle. Draco himself lingered behind Fleur, Madame placing her hands on the girl's shoulders. Every other Headmaster seemed to do the same as they nervously stood by their chosen students. 'The first task is designed to test your daring; courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizard,' Crouch explained, but it seemed like every Champion already knew what this
'I don't know, Harry. I told you my knowledge on dragons was limited to those books I gave you. Where are those books anyway?'
“Mistress Malfoy is out, sir. She went to Diagon Alley to get an owl, sir.”
'M-My name is Harry. Harry Potter,' the boy told to him. Draco froze in his stride, releasing the grip on his dressing gown the tiniest bit. In the distance he could see the girls waiting for him, chatting to each other and pointing at little architectural details of the hallway.
' he said to her.
I'll be fine.'
, cry was probably your biggest dream come true, wasn't it, Potter?'
Voldemort had crawled inside him — had taken over his soul, but Harry wasn't planning on giving up. He fought the bad visions in his mind, replaced them for good ones; memories of him and Draco, of his friends, of Sirius and Remus. Filled with love. 'You're the weak one,' he stammered, and this time it
As Madame had told them, the Headmaster of Hogwarts had a grand entrance planned for the two foreign schools. The man himself was currently talking to his own students in what they called the Great Hall but could be found similar to the dining chamber back at Beauxbatons. Draco and the girls were waiting on one side of the wide hallway, the boys of Durmstrang on the other side. Positioned in front of the girls, Draco tried to block the view on his lovely ladies from the Bulgarian beasts. Beside keeping his chin up high, he also kept his eyes locked with that of the youngest Quidditch star in history;
'Harry didn't do anything!' Ron defended.
Harry grumbled a response and dragged himself down the stairs, passed his aunt fanning herself with a magazine and uncle Vernon slowly melting away on the couch. August the second marked the hottest day of the year, and it was clearly noticeable. He sauntered down the street, past the old lady from across who never stopped talking about her cats. She waved at him while strolling along, back to her cat-filled home. As he neared the small park in Magnolia Crescent, he could already spot his cousin and his friends from afar. They were teasing a child again, probably asking for his money or just annoying him out of boredom. Harry sighed, knowing that he couldn't do much about it as his nephew was twice his size.
Draco could feel his cheeks turn a violent red at those words; a color that looked terrible with all the shades of blue he wore. ‘You’re doing it again, Harry.’
Taking the boy — or man, Harry was quite unsure wether he could call an
Normally Draco would always close the door immediately behind him, but this time he had left it open on purpose, giving Harry some time to enter as well. Hoping that the boy had been smart enough to actually enter, Draco closed the door and made his way to Raphael's portrait.
Draco followed him as well, joining by Luna's side and with the pair standing next to each other, Harry could've sworn they were brother and sister by their pale complexion and platinum blond hair. The French blasted curses at his opponent with the most elegant use of a wand Harry had ever seen; hitting the man right in his face and blasting him to the other side of the atrium as if it had been nothing. Distracted by his battling lover, he turned himself back to Ron whom was struggling to fight his own opponent. Just when Harry raised his wand again to help, a pink flash of light was blasted in the Death Eater's direction — throwing him onto the ground with his wand rolling out of his hand. Both Harry as Ron turned around to see Hermione tuck her wand away, a smirk on her face that gave her a heroic yet slightly terrifying look.
"I'm not quite sure. Not
strange then. Nobody would ever talk to an angel the way you do."
He takes a deep breath, tries to focus himself on whoever he’ll find behind those doors today; Aurors only wanting to talk — or Aurors ready to give him an undeserved punishment for whatever reason. Perhaps they think he’s dead, Draco then thinks to himself, as he remembers he hasn’t shown his face in public for the past four years. Or think he’s lonely, decaying away in the presence of his equally weak mother.
Draco's own heart beat faster than usual again; but this time it was because of his rage. He always had been able to maintain his anger quite well but ever since he met the boy from the tales, it felt like he had become more emotional. Harry was truly changing many things inside of Draco and the blond didn't know wether he liked it or not. He liked how his heart skipped a beat whenever he saw the boy and how he blushed when Harry said nice words to him — but he didn't like that it also made him defensive, as if he needed to protect Harry.
Harry clenched his jaw as he tried to maintain his anger.
Ron kicked him against his leg —
Footsteps then silenced his thoughts, resounded through the Hall of Prophecies like landing feathers; soft and silently creeping towards them in the dark. He felt the eyes of someone luring at him, at the prophecy he held in his hand. They still had their wands drawn, a bright Lumos enlightening a circle of blue light around them.
