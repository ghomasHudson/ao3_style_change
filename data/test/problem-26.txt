The boy seethed as he stomped down the hall, the portraits whispering as he passed.
"I know what you're thinking about, and don't." Lucius said coming to a stop behind Snape's chair so he could read over his shoulder. Neither of them could still believe the number of injuries he had suffered.
Draco and Harry talk to some pepes that aren't each other. They each have their own issues to work out and they're finally realizing that.
While Draco would be sad not to see Harry during school, he couldn't help but agree. After conducting more research he had come to the same conclusion. The moment Harry returned to Hogwarts there was nothing the Malfoys could do to protect him. Plus, this way I won't have to be mean to him, Draco couldn't help but think.
"You know I think it could use some yellow," she quipped.
The two dissolved into laughter at the ridiculousness of it all, Harry being the first to stop. "Are you serious about the wrackspurts?"
The smell had been a bit different from the time they made it in Slughorn's class, but he hadn't thought.
His friends had all told him that it wasn't his fault but they didn't hear the voices. The terrible voices in his head that whispered constantly about how stupid he was to believe the vision was real. He laughed pitifully as his rubbing became forceful, a now constant pressure on his bruise that only created more pain.
Draco bit his lip as Harry met his gaze, glancing around nervously. "I was just wondering if you were going to eat or not. You've pushing your food around. Is it not to your tastes?"
Harry shakes his head and Malfoy continues, "The taboo curse allows someone to trace a word. Anytime that word is spoken, a trace to their very location is sent out. The Dark Lord has placed such a curse on his name."
"You should go change," he whispered.
"It does matter."
"You lied to me then?" Harry runs a hand through his hair, trying to steady himself. "For what? A couple truthful answers? Were any of your answers real?"
____/\____
"What happened?!" Pansy cried dropping her book into her lap.
"I had my wand with me and put up wards."
"Yea, he basically kicked me out of the house before I finished my breakfast. They've been weird ever since Potter got there." Draco whispered pulling out a bar stool and taking a seat.
"But, its red." Harry explained to him looking at his back. He repositioned his towel and turned to look at the clothes hanging up. Draco had a very extensive wardrobe.
"I see what you mean, mother. But, can I ask you something?"
"No, it's not!" Sirius straightened as he spoke. "That boy is someone summoned here to save us and you two keep coddling him. What he did," Sirius said, pointing at his leg. "That's not normal. Do you think Dumbledore could do that? Because I don't."
"Boy! Just because your insolent, lazy parents created you doesn't mean I'll allow you to follow in their footsteps! You will get up and make me my dinner!" The last part was yelled out in one breath and Harry could just imagine how red his face became and realized he was correct as Vernon slammed the door open with such force that the wall it hit was tainted with a crack.
"My actions earlier were uncalled for. I acted like a child running off like that. I am sorry, Harry." Snape choked out maintaining eye contact with Harry. He was slightly biting his lip and his forehead was wrinkled as he worried about Harry's reaction.
"Blaise is 'friends' with everyone he wants to get his hands on." Pansy argued, "Name someone else."
Draco rolls his eyes as Harry cringes. "Oh, please. You'll be in far better company than I will."
Harry was just pulling the over-sized red sweater over his head when an owl flew up to the window. Tilting his head to the side he walked over to it curiously, giggling as it  nibbled on his finger. He untied the string fixing the letter to the owl's claw and unfolded it. Rough, cursive handwriting spread across the paper, almost finding its way to the bottom.
Pansy looked at him surprised, "and?"
They really won't be that big though; I'm a bit of an exaggerator.
Draco grimaced and pulled back from his chair, "How would I know? I'm not the Harry Potter whisperer."
What did not cross the older man's thoughts, however, was that the young boy might be curled up in a corner of the room, shivering. Severus wasn't sure what to do. Even if he did know what to do Draco could be here any minute. He had left Draco downstairs, but just before he knocked he heard footsteps. It was likely that the slytherin was right outside the door.
"We're wizards Harry."
A pseudo set of parents destiny pushed onto him. She dipped her fingers in red paint each time she touched him.
She ignores him. Has to because her brain is turning. She can't think about what Draco's jokes might mean for Harry. Didn't have time to consider the repercussions of emotions not yet proven. They had seen where he was and he was clearly unhappy. Even with his parents there and Sirius, Harry ran down the hall more than walked. Trying to escape.
"Ask him about it." Draco declared looked determined.
Harry left the room as they watched turning down a familiar corridor.
"I have enough common sense not to attack a student in front of a professor." Harry says as he crosses his arms. Then, when Draco barely reacts he mumbles, "ferret."
"Why wouldn't they just unlock it?" Draco challenged him.
But no, that didn't make sense. Even if Harry had been relaxed, why was he sleeping on the flo-
"You don't know what you're talking about." Severus said, rubbing his face with a hand. "You're just a child and you haven't met the dark lord yet. Not like we have."
"Dumbledore?" Narcissa asked curiously. Her eyes narrowed as she evaluated Harry but, he refused to look up. "I think he is a fool. I also think he considers life to be a game of chess and not the welfare and survival of his fellow wizards."
"It would do you good not to aggravate my patient, Draco." Snape turned finally spotting Harry against the bedpost, "What are you doing up?! You foolish boy." He grabbed Harry arm supporting him as he hobbled back to the silver sheets.
"You're one to talk."
A/N: I didn't think anything through when I first started this and now it's all biting me in the butt. So I went back and revived Sirius. I only mentioned his death once so it wasn't a super big change, especially since I didn't really write the way it had effected Harry properly anyway. Honestly, I'm kinda irritated with myself because it was so easy to fix. So this is based in sixth year, HOWEVER neither Sirius nor Dumbledore died. I'm not quite certain what happened in my version of fifth year, but it is not important at the moment and will be decided later. So just gotta know this is sixth year which means everyone is like 16 to 17 years old (I really didn't want to start a romance with some of them being 15, didn't feel right) and soooo Umbridge is the DADA teacher in my version of sixth year and Dumbledore, who did NOT die, is still the headmaster. Yea...
"He always says that Pansy would hate him, but she wouldn't. I know she wouldn't. She always laughs when I tell her about the stupid stuff Harry does." Draco frowned as he spoke, but he didn't continue the argument. Narcissa smiled softly as she considered what he said, her hands picking up the cloth again.
"That's what we wanted to ask you Mr. Potter," Severus says. "Mr. Malfoy found you on Privet Drive under what remained of your aunt's house."
"Thank you," Harry whispered. Draco understood him a bit more. He had been right, it hadn't been death eaters. Even if Draco wanted to react badly and curse the Dursleys that wasn't what Harry needed right now. Harry Potter seemed to need to feel normal and that's what Draco planned on doing.
I'm sending this letter on the whim that you might still be alive. No one knows where you are, Harry, and we're all worried about you. Dumbledore says that the Dursley residence is destroyed and I was shocked myself to turn on the news and discover that the Dursleys were dead. Ron and the twins are worried sick...so am I. If you are alive and do receive this letter please respond immediately at your own convenience or not. Harry I really hope you are reading this somewhere... Please be safe.
It doesn't, but Harry doesn't want him to elaborate so instead he asks, "Where am I?"
Draco found himself stepping into the fireplace an hour later and meeting Pansy for the first time as himself. Draco Malfoy wasn't the narcissistic bloke who wanted to please the dark lord anymore even if he still sneered because of habit sometimes. Pansy made sure he knew that.
Was it with the light? The light who abandoned him to the Dursleys every summer, not that he had told the Weasleys or Hermione.  Harry had told Dumbledore though. "Harry, a punishment is a punishment. You must have deserved it." Would the Malfoys feel the same way? Would the dark?
"I thought I heard something." The man said, his blue eyes shining. "Never mind." He nodded at his partner in apology as they returned to their posts. Lucius's heels didn't make a sound as he walked back to the grass that they apparated in on. As Lucius turned around quickly preparing to apparate, Harry stole one last glance at the rubble and chaos that had called everyone out like moths to a flame.
"You're very welcome, Mr. Potter."
"He's right. We'll be back within the hour so don't kill each other. I would hate to waste good potions getting the blood out of Narcissa's carpet."
"They had to go pick up a couple more things, Draco. That's all. Your father forgot some potion ingredients Severus needed," Narcissa explained.
Lucius coughed as Harry stabbed a piece of pancake, "I'll be going into Diagon Alley with Severus. I'm afraid the two of you will have to entertain each other." He said nodding at Harry and Narcissa.
"Draco why don't you go find Harry and tell him we've changed our mind," Narcissa suggested. "I'll have Poppy send up some food to his bedroom so see if you can get him to eat as well."
"Shh, it's best to leave it alone."
Risking everything he had earned for a couple moments of minor pleasure. Harry had been right from the very beginning. He wasn't capable of that.
"We are a family of slytherins Mr.Potter." Lucius said in response as he took a seat next to Draco. Harry stared at his hands waiting for someone to speak. It was Snape who broke the silence.
"That's alright dear." She said. "Have you finished eating?" She looked pointedly at his still fork and he nodded. They both stood and Poppy came back into the room clearing the plates.
Harry folded the letter back, following the creases. Slipping it into his pocket he petted the owl affectionately, "Hang here while I write a reply." The owl simply chirped in response before settling on the dresser.
"Nothing."
So this was it. This was what it was like be friends with the Harry Potter. The chosen one. The boy who lived. The boy who Draco might just be falling in love with. "nargles?" Draco asked. He really hadn't heard of such a thing though the boy had to admit that he really hadn't been listening. He had been lost somewhere around Neville Longbottem when Harry's eyes started to sparkle.
"No, they were not."
If he dies, who'll save the wizarding world? Who will defeat Voldemort? Dumbledore can't tell his right side from his left. It was all Harry, always Harry. As much as he enjoyed the silence in his head he knew he couldn't die here. He had things to do. Even as he started to black out Harry felt his magic pull into his gut, circling inside like a carousel.
Draco glanced at him concerned but Harry just turned and walked to the bed. He should've realized he didn't have any extra clothes. He had only retrieved his suitcase last night, which contained his books and wand but no clothing, except his robes.
Future AN~ Oh Hell to the Yes!!!!!!!!!!!! Updated, this chapter had the most updates, those being in the fight between Draco and Harry. I was so mad at myself for using such a cheap escape as unconscious charms. The fact that I didn't notice the plot whole at all, really hurt my pride too. Anyway, hopefully I'll update weekly now. I have exams this week and next so I'll do my best to update frequently but no promisesssssss.
"I thought you already knew." Harry wasn't sure what Snape meant as he remembered hearing Lucius's account.
Running a hand through his hair he grabbed his dirty clothes and left. He didn't think he would run into anybody because they were all out so he wasn't worried. "Potter?" A voice called from just down the hall and looked up to see Draco. He looked shocked at the state of Harry's body and his hand twitched.
"Are you alright?" Lucius asked quietly, observing Harry's reaction to his voice. He wasn't disappointed as Harry flinched before turning to look at him.
"You lied then," It's Harry shouting. Words sometimes mumbled together or garbled beyond recognition in the void between their worlds. "Any of it real?"
Snape doesn't flinch, but rolls up the sleeve of his arm revealing his dark mark as Malfoy does the same beside him. "We bear the mark, but we do not serve. I know Dumbledore told you, but I have defected. Lucius and I defected at the same time."
*coughcough* Future AN~I'm horrible person who never finished this but hopefully I can stick with it longer this time. I'm going back and correcting a couple chapters so I can fix this one part that always irritated me. BEWARE there will be story-line changes ^.^
Hermione
James shoved his hand into his hair, pulling. "Fuck."
Harry watched them leave as much as he could from his position until Lucius closed the door behind them. "Are they always like that?"
A police officer turned to look at the loud noise and tapping his partner's shoulder walked to the edge of the rubble looking around. "What's wrong?" His partner asked running a hand through his hair. Lucius jumped down and grabbed Harry's side, picking up both him and his suitcase.
"Of course, Malfoy. I'm not stupid."
In a way, Harry considered himself to be a mark. A mark on the Dursleys. A mark on the Weasleys'. Even to a certain extent, a mark on the Malfoy family. It seemed that no matter what the boy did, wherever he went became tarnished. The more Harry thought about it, the more the idea stuck.
It was midday. That's what it looked like to Harry, anyway. Around two pm at the latest. He placed the blue vase on the floor and began to admire the flowers. He considered adding orange, but he didn't think the colors meshed well and began to look at the red flowers.
"Draco?" Severus asked, shocked. "Those boys can't see past their own egos. I doubt either of them will be friendly to each other when we return. Speaking of, did Narcissa ask you about our unexpected leaving?"
"What do you think of Dumbledore?" Harry asked. He formed the silver flowers to be the outer ring and placed red roses in the center, but the vase looked devoid of color. He spotted a group of Chocolate Lace flowers and began to pile them in between the silver and red ones.
Horcruxes can be placed in living things, but the horcrux is destroyed when they die so this method is not preferred. To this day, there isn't a known way to separate a horcrux from the object it is put into as the magic is banned and rarely seen in action.
He was looking into each opening as he passed. Looking for enemies, Hermione realized. Harry needed to heal not to be dragged into another godforsaken world.
"I wouldn't recommend moving so much Mr. Potter." Obviously Harry wants to say as he rubs his eyes.
Or, maybe more than snatches: red hair. Lily Potter stands before her son, confused. Her head is tilted as she looks at him, eyes analyzing. Trying to figure him out the way Hermione would a book or Draco a potion.
Draco pulled his legs up to his chest staring at his mother. Her hands moved without thought as if the needles she held guided them. She smiled at him and set the cloth down. "What is it? Is Harry mad at you?"
"It doesn't matter Draco and stop putting your nose in my business." Harry growled throwing open his door and walking inside. He moved to close it but Draco grabbed on holding it open.
The sheet slipped off farther as he scooted back into the headboard. "Are you going to take me to Voldemort?"
"What. Did. You. Do?" James asked again. He was clearly losing patience and fast. He hadn't been together with Lily in eight years, but he still couldn't look in her eyes as he spoke.
When he was younger it was simple; everything was so simple. Grow up and make the dark lord proud, make his parents proud. But, three years ago things began to change. Severus and his father would meet in private behind closed doors that were covered in magic. Draco had tried using spying charms multiple times, but his father caught him and sent him to his room.
"He must be. See this cranny?" Draco asked, pointing at the small visual. "It's right in front of Hufflepuff commons."
"What was that?" Harry asked.
He rolled his eyes as he thought about it. Here Harry was cursing his own father and Hermione was accepting it. None of it made sense. Hermione was diligent and straight-forward. She didn't enjoy snide comments.
____/\____
Harry hated himself, in the moment, for what he had done. For as much as the clothing before him had only brought him misery, Harry felt a strange connection to it. Harry had been forced upon the Dursleys and mangled by them in the ways that they saw fit. Despite all that they had done though Harry, in the same the fabric had, wanted to be loved by them.
"Anyway, he still lied about having his wand." Draco cleared his throat before speaking hoping to shut her up.
"It doesn't matter Sirius. He is still-"
"You know the language of flowers?" Narcissa asked surprised.
He supposed it was only a matter of time until he woke up but Harry wasn't prepared for the green walls that graced his vision. He expected more the antibiotic scent and white walls of Saint Mungo's.  The silver canopy of the bed above him should have given him an intimation as to where he was at but in his state of mind he wasn't thinking.
Too soft.
Harry, taking this as a dismissal, picked up his plate and stood up. Narcissa looked at him curiously before smiling and when Harry looked at Draco, the boy looked curious, too. "What is it?"
Harry rolls his eyes, "I'm not lying. I'm still under veritaserum."
He pulled up a board assuming Lucius would cover him and began to shift the wood below it trying to find something identifiable. He spotted a shoe rack hidden beneath a board and smiled remembering Petunia putting it in the cupboard when he was moved to a bedroom.
"I don't know where the dining room is." Harry stated, looking at Draco as if that should be obvious. Draco ran a hand through his hair and walked past Harry, down the stairs.
"And? How did Harry react."
"Professor?"
"Mature enough to see from your childish point of view."
Lucius stood up from the armchair. "Severus."
Sirius frowned and stepped forward, forcing himself into James's view.
"When we, me and Harry...I mean...Harry and I, when we return to Hogwarts, will I have to pretend to be his enemy?"
"How do you know about the basilisk?!" Harry exclaimed turning around to examine her.
Severus snorted and pulled a book off of his coffee table before tossing it to Lucius. "If you're curious then read up." Lucius caught the book and turned it over to read the title.
"I'm not hungry." Harry argued throwing his head back onto his pillow in a fit and rolling away from Draco. He felt a hand at his pants and looked down to see Draco's slender fingers pulling.
Harry glanced outside as he rubbed his bruised side. The sun was slowly melting into the earth as the day itself faded from existence. He couldn't help but wonder when his last day would be, with the Dursleys or maybe after he defeated Voldemort? He wasn't even sure he had the energy to defeat Voldemort, he could barely get out of bed since Sirius's death.
"I'm fine. Just lost my appetite; that's all."
"No time to spare then."
He knew if he did he wouldn't be able to get an answer. Would stop asking rather than force her to speak. James needed to know though. When he and Sirius had left Harry had been fine. Almost happy even.
"No, you never sit there. You hate that chair. You yell at me about it every time you get here."
"That's why everyone calls him 'he-who-must-not-be-named.'"
"I know," Pansy said looking at the carpet. A part of Draco couldn't help, but feel like he had wronged her. It was a new feeling. No, not new, but old. He hadn't felt guilty in a long time.
Lucius strode from the wall to take a seat next to Severus and squeezed the man's shoulder. The only kind of comfort Severus would ever allow after his father. Severus smiled at him in thanks.
It doesn't take him long to notice the blond boy across from him. Much less time to guess at who.
"Draco loves to tell the story." She said smiling, "Why don't you take a seat Harry?" She waved her arm in the direction of the other chair and he followed her direction, sitting down.
"What do you mean vague?"
"I think I'll leave that to you, Mr.Potter." She replied ignoring his questions as she disappeared through the french doors.
"It isn't exactly common for men to be gardeners is it?" He released the petal and stepped back to look at her.
"Why," harry asked. "Why would it matter to you? The boy who found happiness in my misery! Why don't you just gloat Malfoy? I mean this show that you have been putting on since Lucius saved my life! Why? I don't understand. Why pretend when you can outright hate me!" Harry's voice escalated as he continued. All of his settlements at their treatment, all of his insecurities rising to the surface.
They were human. Open to betrayal at any moment. Open to lying just as Dumbledore had. For the greater good, Harry. Always for the greater good, but never for him. It was never Harry they considered in those moments, but themselves. So wrapped up in what they wanted to achieve it didn't matter how much trust they crushed along the way.
AN~ Sorry this chapter is so short. I actually wrote it this morning and expected to write more of it later but ideas for another story are coming really easy so i'm going to spend the rest of the night focusing on that. Hope you enjoy, Deci. <3
"Did you tell Harry this?"
Remus and Sirius had no clue, to the best of Harry's knowledge. Harry had been concerned when he heard they wouldn't be taking him in. He wondered if they had figured it out and been disgusted, but they explained later on that Dumbledore felt it best that Harry remain with the Dursleys. While the two hugged Harry on a regular basis, at least when they met, they had never messed with Harry's arms or felt a scar.
"Don't worry about what you can't finish. I have some dogs out back who can finish our leftovers." She reassured him as she caught his look.
"We both know Harry suffered physical abuse." Lucius nodded his head waiting for Severus to continue and the other man sighed. "Neither of us have spoken to him about it since he first arrived... right?"
For the first time since Severus saw him on the stoop, he looked over at Harry Potter on his couch. "The Dark lord?"
Severus hummed in response, barely paying Lucius any attention. He spread a small amount onto Harry's scar watching as it bubbled for a moment then slid off.
"Draco, drop it."
"Oh, but I so would." Draco replied picking up the blanket he had stolen and after folding it, placed it back on the bed. "Breakfast is downstairs. Snape says you can walk so you're supposed to join us."
"I wouldn't call it saving exactly. I just pulled you from the rubble," Lucius says. Harry looks up to see him in the doorway. Dark robes covering everything, but his face. It left him looking almost sickly at times. The black clothing makes him so pale he looks unnatural.
The older slytherins looked at Draco, surprised. "I'm just saying, isn't it useless if Harry becomes depressed because of it. Dragging him away from his friends. Taking away his free will." Draco wasn't sure why he was defending Harry.The boy had considered Hogwarts to be the most dangerous option from the beginning. "Wouldn't that just corner him into defeating Voldemort?" However, it seemed wrong.
"Just forget about it Mr. Potter." Snape says. "If you continue to push yourself you'll only create more problems for me in the long run."
"Shit." Draco drops.
"I have no reason to lie to you."
"We will be. Draco, shouldn't you be heading off as well." Lucius said turning to his son.
Pansy rolled over, looking up at him with a smile. "I think that's the first time I've heard you apologize."
He remembers the bare minimum, but not much else. The fall must have been harder than Harry expected.
Narcissa paled and set her fork down before snapping her fingers. Poppy appeared with a 'pop' and bowed, her ears flopping against her head. "What do you need?"
"As much as they can be," Draco replied, watching him. When Harry met his gaze though, he didn't bother to avert his eyes.
Lucius couldn't.
Harry Potter lifted his head as his eyes snapped open. A hand reached up to rub his eye trying to wipe away what he had seen, but it didn't work. Eventually Harry let his hand drop into his lap the dead woman still lying on the floor before him. Ruby red hair covering her face in a mock imitation of a mask or last act of kindness.
Harry blinked before grabbing onto the hand letting it pull him up. "Did I really sleep that long?"
Harry wants to laugh at that, but he stops himself. "No, it's okay. I can do it myself." He doesn't think about it. He just applies the glamour. It isn't until her eyes widen that he realizes his own mistake.
"The Dursleys wouldn't let me outside much. But, when I had outside chores it was nice. Even though, the sun was hot and I was tired, I wasn't trapped inside."
When Severus had fully left the room, Draco looked questionably at Harry was only shrugged in response with a shake of his head. Draco huffed before putting his hand out for Harry, "I guess he's just in one of those moods. We need to get to dinner or my mother will throw another fit. She nearly chewed my father's ear off when you skipped out on breakfast and lunch."
"You didn't mean it Poppy. Everything is fine. You can head back to the kitchens now, Poppy." Narcissa comforted her, standing up as the loud crack resounded through the room.
"That doesn't matter! You shouldn't take someone's clothes off without their permission," Harry responded. He knew he wasn't going back to bed at this point and grabbed his glasses as he stood.
"But professor-"
"Harry only flinches." Lucius continued for him. Severus nodded and waved his wand in the direction of the kitchen, calling two mugs of tea to the table. They settled themselves on a couple of magazines and Severus picked them up. He moved them to a clear spot before shuffling the books into a pile.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You think this is funny! This is a lesson, boy, I will not have you lounging about while I work all day. I expect a warm meal when i return!" With each sentence Vernon increased Harry's pain in a new way. As blood entered his mouth from both outside and inside Harry realized this might not be a good thing.
This took forever! Well, that's a lie. I actually wrote it in an hour with my friend's help. However, coming up with the motivation took forever. My friend's super excited for the next chapter though so I might rush it. We'll see. I'm not making any more promises. I break them too easily. Have a wonderful day, guys! Hope you like my Draco.
Attempting to sit up Harry felt a hand resting on his chest stopping him, "I wouldn't suggest that, Mr.Potter." Snape's cold voice said in greeting.
"That's my son." Lucius smiled wrapping his arm around Draco's shoulder and steering him out of the dining room.
"Why am I here?" Harry asks.
"You and Harry made it very clear where our opinions should be. Your father and I decided it would be best if we let you boys make your decisions. After all, it won't be too long until you become adults. Whether Harry wishes to reveal his position to Dumbledore, whether Harry wishes to face the possibility of losing his best friends, and whether Harry wishes to risk losing you, that is all his decision."
A sigh escaped his lips as he rolled over, turning his attention to the wall. He must have accidentally activated the glamour. His fingers, which had not stopped tracing it, could feel where the scar began and where it ended. Another reason Ron and Hermione knew.
"Red is your favorite color?" Harry asked, ignoring the insult. He didn't know what to do now that he had the clothes. Part of him was uncomfortable standing next to Draco half naked, but another part-a more reasonable part- wanted to continue the conversation and see what happened.
She smiled and put another sandwich on Harry's plate to which Draco snickered. "They should be back by dinner." The vase still sat on the table but it was pushed to the side since they were eating.
"Later, Narcissa and I need to discuss something first."
"Harry its not here." Snape confirmed. "It wasn't with you when Lucius found you. He looked around for a bit but couldn't find it."
P.P.S Just count this as part of the last chapter. I posted this today because the last one was so short.
Ron had looked sympathetically at his suitcase and raked his eyes over Harry's body the moment they arrived on the train, searching, but never finding anything. Harry's glamour activated itself like clockwork every morning on September 1st. Harry, himself, wasn't sure what year he had started using it.
Harry's eyes narrowed at the wall of books. Averting his gaze came naturally to him, Vernon had enforced it. "Not entirely, sir."
"What?" Draco asked irritated at the sudden stop.
"Alright, just be back in time for dinner."
"I'm not sure how much I can help. I've never made a bouquet." Harry replied honestly. He did take care of Petunia's garden but he had never picked any of the flowers, he wasn't allowed too.
"I said that if you didn't get up you would become pant-less. Did I not?" Draco glared folding his arms across his chest.
"The mark?"
"So if I got your permission, then I could do it." Draco smirked watching as Harry tested his legs and stretched.
"We'll be back soon." Snape promised before he followed.
When Severus entered Harry's room, he didn't know what he was expecting. Maybe the boy would be reading a book or had just woken up and was rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, or maybe the child had taken to playing a one man game, though Severus didn't know many.
By the time Harry Potter is done crying, the cookies are burnt. He can smell it. Lily had waved her wand at some point, probably turning off the alarm so it wouldn't interrupt his sobs. Harry cringed at the thought.
"I was a baby when I did that. It doesn't count."
"He wouldn't stop yelling at me the first couple of days I came here so I asked him what his name was. I think I may have shocked him because he couldn't speak for a good minute." Harry said as he chuckled at the memory.
"Yes, Mrs. Narcissa." She nodded eagerly popping out and back in with a blue vase in her hands which she passed to Narcissa.
"A single utterance of his name could bring death eaters into the area within minutes," Snape agreed, smiling sadly. "It helps quell any resistances. Minor resistances anyway."
"It's not," Draco paused drawing in a breath. It isn't a lie, right? I do want to kill Harry Potter. I do! I'm sure of it. So why...why can't I just say it.
Harry pulls away from her, grimacing. "I'm sorry about your shirt."
By all accounts Snape was supposed to be a double agent for the light, but Harry had grown familiar with lying while living with the Dursleys. He knew that one lie could grow quickly. He also knew that lying became easier the more you did it. Being a legilimens could only make it easier for the man.
"Yes you did. You're so concerned with keeping everyone out that you don't even bother to think about what you say." Draco sneered looking him in the eye, "You're so selfish Potter." Selfish.
"You already have," Sirius said as he left.
____/\____
It is a difficult to raise one's feet or hands when one does not wish to. Harry Potter knows this very well as he descends the staircase ahead of Draco. The other boy only a mere couple steps away, but Harry couldn't bring himself to speak.
"Those?" Harry questioned. They both knew what 'those' was and Draco definitely knew that Harry knew. Neither of them wanted to clarify what 'those' was though. Draco because he didn't want to admit that someone he had once considered to be his enemy had suffered and Harry because he didn't want to look weak.
Yes. He does remember the stairs. A familiar ache in his bones, his right arm sluggish as he makes a fist.
"Malfoy?!"
"I told you death eaters."
"Why would you lie, Mr.Potter?" Snape asked grabbing Harry's hands so he wouldn't tear the fabric.
He heard the floo activate and assumed that the oldest Malfoy and Snape were back, but he didn't want to see anyone in his current mood. He climbed the stairs and opened the door to his room. Falling onto to the bed, his eyes closed immediately and released him into a blissful sleep with no dreams.
For all he knew, they were keeping him here until Voldemort decided to kill him. Harry looked back up at Narcissa as she spoke. "You know I don't like talking about that man, Draco." Her voice was stern, but she smiled, still the image of peace and happiness. "They said where they were going when they left. They're just visiting Diagon Alley."
Harry bit his lip and grabbed the two items. "No, I suppose not. I'm sorry, Draco." The other boy blinked at the frank apology, uncertain what to say. Harry just nodded in acceptance at the dismal response before making his way back to his temporary room.
When Snape watches Harry flex his fingers and arm he can't help but wonder if he knows. Yet when Harry looks down his glamour is in place. A nifty potion he had learned that senses nearby magic. Even unconscious it will activate in the presence of anything not muggle.
Draco seems to reach the same conclusion at Harry's silence because he drops the wrist. "Sev hates wasting potions." He says as if that explains everything.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Blaise."
"What of the wards?"
"I don't have time for your games."
Potter?
"I'm sure he just plans on finishing it later."
"Draco. It's Draco."
Harry had lived most of his life in silence, so he left. It didn't seem right for him to enjoy the quiet anymore. Not after meeting the Malfoys, or this version of them. This version of the Malfoys were not bad people. Draco was snarky but he wasn't as big of an ass as he was in school. Narcissa seemed to like to talk to him. Lucius and Snape had actually helped him. Harry wasn't sure where he was supposed to stand anymore.
"I think I am," Harry replied, unsure. He had never been asked if he was happy with something before.
"Don't talk about it here." James interrupted. "We'll go to my rooms to discuss it. Sirius you should get looked at by Poppy."
A knock penetrated his thoughts and Harry turned to the door trying to get rid of the excess fear that still had his limbs weak. He considered standing, but couldn't find a reason too. "Come in," harry decided to say instead. He didn't know who was at the door, but it shouldn't matter. The gryffindor had nothing to hide.
"You think you're so much better than me and my dear family. Why?! Because of that stupid wizard blood in your system." Vernon pulled Harry up to eye level, "Maybe I should drain you of it." Vernon's eyes had taken on an evil glint as he threw Harry down the stairs.
P.S. The person I normally have read through these before I post them isn't responding at the moment, so I might make changes later. ( I will mention it in the author's note of my next chapter if I do)
"Morning Pansy." Draco called out as he stepped out of the fireplace. He waved at her place on the couch before walking to the kitchen. "Did you not eat breakfast?" She called back, probably in the middle of a book.
Harry practically growled from his seat as he stood up glaring at them. "If I am not included in that discussion then what makes you guys any different from Dumbledore?" With those words, Harry stormed from the room.
"Your eye color is green, dimwit." Draco replied, smirking, as he grabbed a piece of Harry's hair and let it slide between his fingers. "I can understand why you would be proud of it though." He smiled and let go of the strand leaving Harry speechless. They stood there, awkwardly, for a couple of minutes until Draco cleared his throat.
AN~ Not gonna try to hide it. Pansy is super ooc in this, but I like nice Pansy. She's well...nice. Hope you guys enjoy xD <3
"He's in Hogwarts?"
"Lucius and Severus were young when they joined the dark lord." Narcissa began, her voice heavy. She folded her hands over the table, looking every pit the proper woman she was bred to be. "They had no idea what they were doing. Severus regretted his choice immediately after your mother's death but Lucius took a bit longer. We only transferred to the light three years ago. "
"I didn't..."
Luck would have been not being discovered at all.
"I don't understand why I have to go over there," Draco snapped. "It's not like I'm friends with her. She's stupid for not following the dark lord and so are you guys." He sneered at his godfather before turning on heel to go to his room, but a hand grabbed his robe, pulling it tight.
It's more of a wayward connection than anything. The video flickering constantly as they watch and the audio in snatches. Snatches are all they need to understand what's happening.
"Does she? Do I? Severus you are not alone anymore. When you agreed-"
The older man wrinkled his nose. "I don't have time to play with children. I'm going down to the potions room. Lucius would you care to join me?"
The other man shrugged and pulled his coat tighter around his body. "Everyone reacts to it differently. A slytherin girl who's mother laid a hand on the girl all break would break down and cry the moment someone raised their voice but..."
"Mr. Potter, I'm afraid you have the wrong idea." Harry might have found the words comforting if they weren't coming from Malfoy.
"Whatever." Pansy protested still looking concerned as she grabbed her book from the table. She glanced at the wall clock, noticing that Draco hadn't been there ten minutes and he already had her tense. She turned back to her page to continue reading.
"Boy, stop being selfish! Get up and make me my breakfast!"
"Where are they?"
"Once or twice." Harry said grimacing as he felt the sun on his back again. He looked down at his full plate and scowled before picking up his fork.
The syltherin's eyes were crinkled and tired, a completely different look from the one that Harry had grown used too. "You missed a lot last night. My mother wanted to apologize to you personally, but when she sent Poppy to check on you, you were already asleep. She didn't mean what she said Potter."
"As if I would believe that. Show me your arms." Harry looks pointedly at Snape when he says this, knowing the man bears the mark.
"Poppy." He called before waiting a few moments for the elf to appear. "Bring me the tray of food mother sent to Harry's room." A nod and a pop left the two boys alone again.
Lucius pulls his cane out of his pocket, unshrinking it in front of him. The familiar silver cool to the touch. "As I said I was nearby when I felt it. An outward explosion of magic. It wasn't antagonistic however so I wasn't concerned. I followed it to Privet Drive. The boy was unconscious."
"He is a special case."
His hair is loose, ungelled, as it follows his movements when he looks up. "And so the golden lion awakens, gracing us with his presence." Draco's mouth hasn't changed at all.
"I suppose you're happy you got your wand back." Snape joked as he stood up and walked to the bed. "I wanted to apologize." Harry looked up in surprise as Snape took a seat in an uncomfortable looking, wooden chair. He realized it was the same chair Snape was sitting in when he woke up. He wondered how long Snape sat there for.
The gryffindor didn't glance at the portrait of Abraxas as the man had grown accustomed to him visiting and after the first three days decided Harry wasn't worth the trouble. Those three days had been a pain though, Harry had to admit that Abraxas was one of the more determined Malfoys that he had met.
It's not much of an explanation, but it's all that Severus needs. "You went to a muggle town? Coincidentally the one near Harr-this boy's residence?"
Draco Malfoy knew when he was cornered. It wasn't difficult to tell especially since he had grown up being cornered by his parents and godfather into doing things. With one last glare at his parents and a toss of the normal, "I really dislike you two sometimes", Draco left the room.
Draco bit his tongue before he could retort and sighed. "Is this really necessary? I was just sent here by my father. I don't even like you."
"Yes, Harry." Snape continued, still not noticing his use of Harry's first name, "Luckily Mr. Malfoy was called to join the raid. By the time he arrived, your house was in ruins and he thought you were dead. He pulled a couple of boards up wanting to confirm your death before he left and found you under one.
Lily looked up, "You aren't suggesting?"
"It would be good for you, harry." Snape agreed with Lucius cutting his pancakes. Neither him nor Lucius were certain how Narcissa would react to be alone with Harry.
Lucius sighs as he repositions Harry. "Can you at least attempt to take care of my gift?" He smirks as he asks knowing full well Severus won't answer.
"Fine, I didn't." Harry admitted still pawing uselessly at Snape's robes. "Just take me back to get it."
"Red is a gryffindor color." Harry elucidated playing with the jeans. Draco turned back to look at him. His hand was on his hip in the perfect replication of the average teenage girl and his eyes glared a hole into Harry's.
"It's a little late for that," Severus said. The man closed the book he was reading, his finger holding his place. "You might as well be cramming for a test. If you really do need help in your classes then I will help you at Hogwarts. We can meet up once a week for tutoring if you wish."
As Lucius moved to set him back in bed he noticed Snape sitting on the grey couch that Draco had been on earlier. he nodded at him and placed Harry on the covers before turning to leave.
As if reading his thoughts, Harry visibly relaxed and looked at him curiously. It was as if Severus had never seen him shaking or cringing away. The boy was still huddled in the corner, but Severus couldn't sense any fear from him anymore. It was as if Severus had imagined everything. Maybe I did. I mean, who's to say I didn't?
She smiled at him, "Good morning Harry. Did you sleep well?" Taken aback he only nodded, unsure where to sit. Draco decided that for him as he took the seat next to Snape and began to pile his plate with bacon and pancakes.
Harry's eyes roamed the room until they came down to his hands, which had begun to squirm and clash before breaking apart. "Why are you being so nice to me, sir?"
He tried to brush off his own feelings. Release the frog in his throat and restart the fiery temper he was known so well for. But, he couldn't. In those moments of anger he had realized exactly how close he had grown to them.
____/\____
Harry nearly slapped him right then. The tension had left the room the moment Narcissa confirmed that they weren't called and Draco just had to call it back like it was a dog that needed to be fed.
"Don't talk to James that way," Sirius growled moving in front of the other man. But James stopped him. Wouldn't let the man touch Harry. For what? Who was he protecting?
"Impossible to forget," Draco murmurers
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco sighed in relief and pulled his plate back to himself. Something in her voice must have told him that Narcissa was telling the truth because Harry couldn't see another way those simple words would banish the fear. "So, what are they doing then?"
"No 'buts'. Lucius and I will return to Privet Drive and examine the rubble. I'm sure even us mediocre wizards compared the great Harry Potter can trace the magic from the explosion. You will rest here with Draco to keep an eye on you."
He looked like an artist with paintbrushes and canvases scattered around the floor, haphazardly. It looked similar to the wreckage that was the Dursleys' house. "Do you need something?" Despite his friendly appearance the man's voice was cold and Harry shook his head before leaving.
It's awkward between them as she raises her wand first towards her own clothes then towards his. As if remembering his earlier flinch she stops, "Can I?" He nods and she straightens his own clothing, taking out wrinkles he had never noticed before. "I can get rid of your puffy eyes too. Or at least glamour them. The spell was very helpful for me at Hogwarts, James, your father, wasn't very good at expressing his interest."
Even if Draco was tall for his age, Severus stood at the impressive height that his last growth spurt had given him, easily an inch or two taller than the other slytherin. Severus made a movement that was close to a shrug before turning and walking out of the room leaving Draco and Harry speechless.
"And if it caused later damage to the eye? How would you know?" Snape asked as he moved his wand toward Harry. He whispered a spell so low he could barely hear it.
"We know what Lucius knows but not about anything before that. We believe the death eaters were there for an hour before Lucius arrived. The bruising on your side agrees with this." Snape explained.
"When are they coming back?" Draco asked his mother.
"Wandless magic? Glamour wandless magic? Harry James Potter, how much did you use that spell? To get this kind of mastery over it..."
He turned back to Lucius as he heard him whispering and saw Lucius's wand tap him before he felt something descend down his skin. "A disillusionment charm?" Harry guessed.
"I'm sorry."
Harry flinched and pushed himself back into the wall, shivering. A face appeared in his mind for a moment before disappearing. That picture, harry thought, but the couple danced from his mind before he could react.
"Birds of Paradise? I thought these were Crane flowers." Harry replied detached as he caressed a petal.
Harry smiled at the idea of Abraxas shouting profanities at Snape before fully taking it what the other man had said. "I should let you get back to reading. I was just here to pick up a couple of books." Harry said as he made his way to the left corner of the room.
"The boy isn't stupid, Severus. If he's been beaten his whole life, then I think he would be able to predict his own healing time. He might notice if they don't heal any faster."
"Where the bloody hell am I?" Harry asks, moving to sit up, groaning when his vision blurs. He grabs the sheets as much as he can, squeezing them. When this doesn't help, Harry reaches up to grab at his hair pulling it.
Draco realizing Pansy was right stood up and moved to his much preferred red armchair. "Damn thing doesn't go with the furniture."
He smiled and couldn't help but step forward as he caught sight of a group of Crane flowers. "You know about Birds of Paradise?" Narcissa asked moving beside him to admire the orange petals that looked like wings.
"It doesn't matter if he has a point," Severus frowned. "It's for his own safety that we do this."
"I thought you might sleep through dinner too. I asked Severus to wake you up." Draco explained to Harry before looking at him expectantly, but Severus just shook his head. He shrugged a bit, before hesitating and leaving.
Draco had heard from his mother that when people spoke about the things they love their eyes sparkle and their mouths move faster than before or their hands follow along like those of a conductor leading an orchestra. Draco had believed it. He had seen Severus's eyes when he was making a difficult potion or discussing theory with his father. He had seen it in his father's eyes when he boasted about his day at work or when Draco and he discussed what they would get Draco's mother for her birthday.
"You will?" harry asked. He wasn't certain if he should agree even if Lucius offered.
"I guess I'll grab a bite to eat with her."
"It should be over there." Harry said pointing to where he thought the staircase would be. "You can put me down." Lucius looked unsure for a second but at Harry's exasperated look released him.
"What about the bouquet?" Harry asked surprised as he saw that she had already stood up.
Future AN~ Updated <3       O3O  <------- Help me, I can't make emoticons.
"I'm happy I switched sides while I could." Lucius agreed sitting down in his seat across the desk. He looked at the books that covered his walls in thought, hoping one would contain the answers he sought.
I meant to put Hermione and Draco in this chapter (the other versions), but I got distracted by angst.
"Of course, love." Narcissa rarely used that pet name with her son, but occasionally it slipped.
"He would never forget anything. He always makes a list."
As Harry stared at the lump before him, he was reminded of how truly powerless he was and found himself apologizing. The words tumbling out of his mouth before he could harness them, completely out of control. The fabric hadn't asked to be used in such a way. It had no choice. The fabric couldn't decide who bought it and cared for it. It had no choice in what happened to it.
"We can talk about all sorts of things." Narcissa comforted him pulling his plate to her and putting three pancakes on top. She slid it back, "Have you ever gardened, Mr.Potter?'
Harry snorted but didn't comment on the quip as Draco led him across the hall and into another room. This one was similar to his but with blue walls and green sheets. A wooden wardrobe sat next to the bed opposite the nightstand.
Harry grinned at her and picked up the vase, "It isn't perfect but I like it." Narcissa smiled at it too. Harry wasn't sure if she would understand that he wasn't only speaking about the flowers but he hoped she would. The Malfoys were not perfect but in Harry's mind they weren't the Dursleys.
Of course, that was the point. Harry discovered very quickly after Vernon's first beating that the voices had no power over his pain. It clouded his mind in ways that vanquished the voices just as many wizards wished they could Voldemort. However, Voldemort was his job. Harry had to take care of him even if he didn't want too. Even if the idea of killing him caused bile to run up his throat.
He can still feel Draco's fingers on his wrist. The burn of it. Harry has hated physical contact ever since the first time Vernon slapped him. Still can't stand it despite the efforts of the Weasleys.
As the slytherins continued to pass pleasantries around him, Harry found himself staring at a scuff on the table. The only mark it appeared to have. A tiny wedge cut into it by what was most likely a fork. It was only one line, but Harry wondered why Narcissa hadn't fixed it yet, or, as horrifying as it was to imagine, replaced the entire table. From what he had seen, the family prided themselves on perfection.
"Of course."
Swinging his legs off the bed, Harry stood up on shaky legs and made his way over to his suitcase. A couple of bags sat next to the suitcase. Those were not his target. Harry's gaze wondered until he found them. The hand me downs.
"Who else would I be?" Snape asks as he moves closer. Harry can barely see him with his bare vision, but he tries. He squints until he can make out Snape's robe floating behind him. The damn thing must be spelled because every time it happens the robe seems to follow the same current of wind. "Draco please find Mr. Potter's glasses. I'm afraid he'll injure himself farther with how much he is squinting at me."
He refused to look back in the mirror as he stripped down and stepped into the shower. He pulled the white knob out and twisted it to the hot side.
"You're reading about how to talk to victims of abuse?" Lucius asked, incredulously. "Severus, isn't your personal experience enough?"
The bed is empty. Satin, green sheets slipping down his skin so soft he barely notices them. Harry had never felt such quality before and despite himself, he reaches out to touch it.
"The Dark Lord?" Draco asked incredulously. "Why would we do that?"
Draco was silent as he glared at her. She smiled deviously before continuing, "So, my dear friend, Draco Malfoy, what happened this morning."
"I do not serve the Dark Lord," Malfoy confirms. "Have you ever heard of the taboo curse, Mr. Potter?"
"You can't be serious?"
"Of course," Lucius rolled his eyes. "I mean, what would I even say to the boy?"
"The spell is supposed to pull him to us, right?"
"So you think its embarrassing?" She asked watching him twist his hands, "Draco helps me with the garden." She smiled as she spotted a pot full of crimson flowers. " He planted these."
Thanks~
"How narcissistic of you."
Harry wants to yell at him. Who the hell was Draco to think he could touch Harry? Act like his friend by doing unnecessary things. Hermione and Ron never bothered to stop Harry in these moments. They already knew it was the only thing that could help Harry. Draco is not an acquaintance or even a friend, much less Hermione or Ron.
The black walls closed on him like the walls of his cupboard and he was relieved to see one of the paintings from earlier. He stepped forward taking a closer look at the portrait, his hand rubbing his chin. The plump man sat still for a minute staring out of a window that sat outside his room.
The woman on the floor disappeared and Harry stared at his once bloodstained hand for a long moment before running it through his hair. He pulled it back into view as if expecting the blood to reappear before shaking his head, numbly, as he saw it clean.
"I'm alright. Thank you though." Harry argued while still trying to be polite.
Harry bit his lip, "I guess I'm doing a lot of conclusion jumping today."
The bright blue and red cars brought a new hint of excitement that the residents of Privet Drive hadn't seen for ages, so those who didn't have to work and those who didn't have plans stood outside their doors or in front of the rubble, hugging their own torsos, as they gossiped among themselves.
Opening the door, Harry glanced out into the hall looking for Draco. He wanted to ask the other teen if he could have some paper and a quill. Harry had not brought his own of course.
Life can be a surprising, can't it? I'm glad you are worried about me, though the circumstances are disagreeable to say the least. Your owl, or Ron's-frankly I cannot remember-I suppose, has quite the attitude. I don't think I will be coming to the Weasley's before Hogwarts, like I always do. I'm a little 'tied' up at the moment, not literally of course. This letter is all over the place, but I'm sure you'll sort it out Hermione. You always do.
Being only sixteen, Harry was still underage and after his last run in with underage magic, Harry did not want to be caught again. He paused in his thoughts, contemplative. "They wouldn't-"
"Leave Harry alone. He has enough to deal with as it is." Narcissa reprimanded them and then smiled at Harry, "I'll be in my garden all day if you want to talk about anything." Snape shared a glance with Lucius shocked as Harry smiled back.
He had gone too far. Sirius grabbed his arm and yanked Harry toward him. Yet, Harry had expected it. Prepared for it. Even as Sirius pulled Harry was twisting and then Sirius was gone. Not gone. Across the room. The man slammed into the wall and hit the ground hard.
The boy narrowed his eyes and sneered, "in your dreams pug."
Harry bit his lip as he considered his situation. A Gryffindor in a room full of Slytherins. A "boy-who-lived" in a room of current and future death eaters. People that should want him dead. He had been so caught up in the familiar banter with Snape and Malfoy that he had forgotten to think. To consider the war they were fighting.
Lucius leans on his cane as he considers him. Did Severus want the truth here? The most likely answer: no. He already knew. They both did. Severus wanted Lucius to lie to him. To make everything better.
"We'll figure it out," Lucius spoke up. "Draco will help too, I'm sure."
She frowned, concerned, "You just went there Tuesday. What do you have left to get?" Harry began to eat hoping they wouldn't start arguing. Vernon and Petunia frequently argued over him. This often led to Vernon getting physical and Vernon was never physical with Petunia.
After that, it wasn't a question of how to please the dark lord to Draco, but a question of if that was still his goal. His parents revealed to him a couple months later that they didn't support the dark lord anymore and Draco began to question himself. This person that he built...this bossy, refined, and narcissistic person he became to please the dark lord. Was this person who he really wanted to be?
"How about you bring Harry with you. He could use a bit of time out of the house." Lucius offered with a look in his eye.
"Leaving it alone won't teach this child his place! Children are meant to be taken care of not given responsibilities."
Lucius blinked and shared a glance with Narcissa before explaining, "We discussed it last night and agreed that the safest course is for you to spend the school year here. Severus can slip away from school occasionally to teach you potions and defense against the dark arts while Narcissa and I manage the rest."
Snape rubbed his head and Lucius finally spoke, "What happened to you, Harry? How much do you remember?" As the realization dawned on Harry he wondered if he should tell the truth. That it wasn't the death eaters who almost beat him to death but his uncle. That he was happy they were dead and he wouldn't have to go back anymore.
Harry, bewildered, only shook his head in response. Narcissa was becoming more and more surprising every minute.
It wasn't that it didn't hurt. The bruises that had not disappeared yet were indeed part of the worst of his injuries. Harry Potter wasn't sure when the other, more minor ones, had healed. The days had blurred together at Malfoy manor.
They were always blunt with each other. So blunt they scared others. Even Remus. James couldn't help his surprise though. He hadn't expected Sirius to argue. The situation was too volatile for an argument. "It's my so-"
Harry understood even if Snape didn't think he would. Forcing people to call him 'The Dark Lord' or 'he-who-must-not-be-named' dehumanized Voldemort. Any small resistances unable to even call the man by his name would be discouraged every time they discussed him. Any small resistances too misinformed to know better would be killed.
His body hurt, Harry smiled. He couldn't hear them anymore, those nasty voices that penetrated his thoughts, they were gone.
"Red is not a gryffindor color. Red is its own color." Draco argued turning back to his nightstand. He grabbed his clock from the top and began to fiddle with it. "If you believe I'll let you gryffindorks ruin my favorite color, you're mistaken."
"He's lying Snape." Lucius said pacing around his own office. Snape glared at him from his seat at Lucius's desk as he picked up the medical report the healer had left.
"That's strange."
Harry says that they killed his relatives and beat him up. One of the death eaters apparently let him go or something and Harry said he ran to his room before they could catch him. That he locked himself inside and they burned the house down in response."
Trusting someone else to survive.
"Of course. Doesn't every gardener?"
Turning on heel, Draco decided it would be best to go to the library. Severus wasn't known to lie, but he couldn't be sure anymore. In fact, Draco Malfoy was beginning to become unsure of everything.
Draco still glared at it every other minute, but he had agreed to it after his mother had scolded him. "What are they doing anyway? The dark lord didn't call them, did he?" Narcissa cringed and Harry tensed as Voldemort was mentioned.
"This isn't the time for heroics, boy. Your life is on the line," Severus said.
"But it does matter. Don't you see?" Sirius looked manic as he spoke, eyes wide. "We summoned him with dark magic."
"Now you're bringing houses into this? How mature are you?"
However, he was Harry Potter. He was the boy who lived and the savior of the wizarding world. Heroes weren't supposed to beaten by their uncles. Heroes are supposed to fight back and win. Harry lost.
AN~ Hi guys this is Deci, I would like to have a really awesome excuse for not writing for so long but I don't. I just didn't feel like it for a while, forgive me. o,o - my attempt at a puppy face xD
"So what are you going to do?"
"Writing someone, are we?" Draco asked. His eyes shifted as he considered whether or not he should trust Harry. He didn't want to force the boy to promise not to give away his location but on the off chance that Harry did so, it could be detrimental to Draco's father and their position as spies.
"Because I understand now." As Severus spoke Harry looked up from his hands, curious. "I misjudged you and mistreated you. For that, I apologize."
"You don't have to ever clean your plates, Mr.Potter. The elves will take care of that," Draco's mother affirmed. Harry flinched as they returned to a last name basis before nodded and leaving the room.
"Fine." Snape said unhappy with Harry's response, "Don't ask for my help later."
"Alright then," the man said before he strolled out of the room.
Draco raised an eyebrow, smirking. "Come on Hermione. People hated me emotionally, but physically..." He smirks as he looks back at the cranny. "Good times."
"He's a guest is this house, but he-"
Sirius massaged his thigh as he spoke, nearly growling. "Kid knows wandless magic?"
"Sorry. I didn't mean to be so rude."
Snape rolled his eyes at the gryffindor's back and opened his book. "I am perfectly capable of holding a conversation, but I appreciate the gesture. The offer on tutoring still stands, Potter. You need only ask."
Hermione laughed, "That's not it works Draco. A ghost can't haunt another ghost. We'll be haunting each other."
"I'm surprised you got him to be quiet at all. The only person he will listen to is a Malfoy. If Lucius hadn't told him to leave me alone, and this was at the threat of burning the man's portrait, then I doubt I would get the peace I do now."
So uhh my friend didn't read this yet, but I'm deciding to post it. I also made it twice my normal size because I felt bad that I'm a couple hours late. I got distracted. I mean is Starmyu a bl anime or not? I'm so confused because the show is almost pushing them together, but it's not. Anyway, I hope you like this chapter. I wasn't really sure what to do and the fluff only appears at the end and I didn't do the Lucius chapter. It just didn't seem necessary for this scene like I thought it would. All this was planned a couple hours ago and I'm doing at 3 am despite my better judgement so I might wake up and change it. However, I like the fluff at the end. Is that even fluff? I wanted them to cuddle, but... the whole potter thing happened and now its a joke...or not. I got an idea. want to reveal, but i cant. anyway, so long. peace. have a blast. see ya later. hasta la vista?
"Harry." Draco's snarky voice said in greeting, "Get up. Breakfast." Harry groaned and turned to the other side of the bed. He didn't feel like getting up, especially if it was what Draco wanted. "I'll steal more than just your blanket if you don't get up. You'll find yourself pant-less in a couple minutes."
He took another glance around the room, his eyes catching on the empty frame. "Where is Abraxas?"
AN~ I don't know all the proper British terms (like pants being used for underwear) so I'm not using any of them in this story. If I say pants I mean Jeans or pajama pants. If I say underwear ;) I mean underwear. Love you, Deci. <3
"Sirius I suggest you go see Poppy before I do something we'll both regret."
"Don't have to be so defensive, Harry. I have some paper and quills in my room." Draco raised his eyebrow at Harry's tone before making his way back into his own room. Harry followed behind, diligently.
"I can't remember." Harry says and it's mostly true.
"Runs right off. Do you want to remove it?"
"Malfoys?" Harry asked as he began to rub in the salve. The effect was immediate and he nodded to Snape in thanks.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco?" Pansy inquired looking uncertain, "Why are you sitting there?"
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, "I was actually planning on taking it the kitchen and washing it. Was I not supposed to?"
"Lucius," he breathes. "Is that?"
Lucius looked at him with something like approval before nodding. "Where is your wand?"
It was, surprisingly, Severus who made himself visible when he opened the door. Harry idly wondered why the older man was visiting him as he waited for him to speak. However, he didn't say anything. Though, his face appeared to be blank there was a stiffness to the man's posture that left Harry shrinking into his corner. The silhouette of Severus appeared to widen against the wall taking on a bulbous shape that left Harry's depleted mind in a dreamlike state.
However, Draco didn't think anyone's eyes could quite compare to Harry's though Severus might disagree with him later.
"Oi!" He shouted, jumping up and crawling back to the hedboard. "What are you doing?!"
"Right, sorry Draco." Hermione said as she carved a rune deeper into the floor.
"I would never miss dinner, mother. I know how much it means to you." Draco said as he took the seat next to Severus, directly across from Harry. "Though the idea of locking myself in my room and reading was tempting."
He set a brisk pace giving Harry no time to admire the paintings that were hung every couple of feet. "It's just in here." Draco intoned pushing open a door to reveal a large black table and pristine silver walls. Lucius sat at the head of the table with Narcissa on his right and Snape on his left.
Draco didn't have a reason when he checked on Harry later in the day, but he did. The boy still hadn't moved, huddled up in the corner of the room and clutching the sheet like it might run away. Draco ran a hand through his hair and left. If Harry was still asleep there wasn't much of a reason for him to stay.
Yea, see it feels kinda empty and useless. But, my friend who beta reads for me said it was good. Oh yea! Next chapter is gonna have fluff and half of it from Lucius's pov or Severus's. However, the fluff will be drarry... If I make it lucius and severus fluff I gotta tell ya it'll be friendly fluff. In this fanfic I love Narcissa and Lucius together so I can't that. Wow, I've taken up space.
"Some might call it fate, Severus."
"Hoping to bring up that worthless grade of yours in potions?"
Draco huffed and stabbed his fork into a corner of his sandwich, which he had decided to cut into pieces. "You and I both know they went there this Tuesday." Harry frowned and looked at his hands.
"I know. It's a glamour."
"As if you need to ask. Shut up and help me Malfoy."
I wouldn't have. I would never. Why would I...I didn't even know her? Did I?
"So," Draco pauses looking for words. "He's in a different world from our own...with his parents? Who are bullying him?"
"It was mostly my fault." Harry finally responded, sighing. "The moment I realized my wand was gone, I started worrying about my position at Hogwarts and took it out on you." He looked at the brown door in front of him in thought.
Snape can't know.
"Thank you." Harry said looking at her as she grabbed his plate. She startled and dropped it. The plate stopped a couple inches from the floor and Harry looked at to see Narcissa moving her wand.
He picked up a strand, pulling on it and scrunching it, hoping to bring it back to life. He shook his head and dropped it. He noticed the shower behind him and saw a towel on the rack. He smiled. He didn't think the Malfoys would be mad if he used some water.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And?" Draco asked confused.
"Says the slytherin."
"Oh, don't be ridiculous Draco. I doubt they're bullying him. Harry's just being dramatic as per usual. Although, in this case his dramatism makes sense."
"How would you know?"
"Mr. Malfoy." There was a lot of bite in Snape's tone, but Lucius only rolled his eyes in turn.
"We're bringing him back, right?"
"They did?!" Harry shouted and Draco looked up to his eyes shining. "So I'll get to see Hermione and Ron again. Neville will probably lose his frog on the train again and I'm sure that Luna will say something weird. Something about nargles most likely. Speaking of which, do you know what nargles are Draco?"
"Like I said, Harry. Curiosity." Lucius answered before turning in place and apparating them to Privet Drive.
Draco could help harry get to dinner. Severus needed to talk to Lucius for a bit.
"Draco darling, how long ago were you two enemies?"
"Pansy chased me out of the house," Draco replied distantly unable to look away from the bruises, "What are those?"
He remembers yelling. Uncle Vernon getting so angry his skin turned vermilion and then a fist coming towards him. Stairs?
Draco Malfoy was another story entirely. The patches had been rough at first, specifically before their first agreement and their first fight since friendship-if it could be called that. However, after their meeting where Harry slipped about the Dursleys it was as if they were walking on egg shells. Harry wasn't sure if Draco was too scared to talk to him about his summers or if Draco was trying to be courteous, but the effect was lost on him.
AN~ OH HELLS YES I WENT THERE! It's so late. Someone buy me coffee. Anyway, hope you enjoy and all that stuff. Hearts, hearts and, oh my god, my heartue.
Annyeong!!!! Cringy, eh? Honestly, I'm not super sure about this chapter... It just seemed kinda there. No importance, but it felt necessary and I hate time skips so... well long ones anyway. The next chapter is coming out tomorrow since I have time. Now, that I've backed myself into that corner, please, enjoy this chapter created through my blood, sweat, and tears. Just kidding... At least, about the blood part. ;)
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why would you bring him here? No. Why would you have the boy in the first place Lucius." It's less of a question and more of an accusation. Severus' tone was too hurried and angry to be anything else. His voice is low, wary of any interference.
"Of course!" Poppy grinned and took the plate off the corner before disappearing. The 'pop' left Harry flinching this time and he rubbed his arms, trying to get rid of the goosebumps.
"Father, can I visit Pansy today?" Draco asked after he finished a bite of bacon.
"Yes, nargles! And wrackspurts or moon frogs!"
He bit his lip and looked at Narcissa, who at the moment was looking at him in concern. "Harry are you alright? You're looking a little pale." Her voice was softer than when she had spoken to Draco.
"Poppy is sorry. Poppy didn't mean to drop the plate." Poppy repeated as Narcissa put the plate back on the table then dropped to her knees in front of the elf.
"Professor?" Harry choked and then coughed, his hands moving to rub his throat.
"I suppose." She agreed before she continued. "What would make people think you have no dignity? You defeated the dark lord." She looked at him curiously, noting the way his fingernails were bitten down.
He bit his lip...They might count it. What had happened after I passed out? Did I perform magic? Harry drew a weary hand across his face before shaking it. I shouldn't think about this now. I have things to do.
He was irritated with himself and with Draco. He wanted to stop and fix things, but his pride silenced him. The way in which Draco had said his last name left a sour taste in the gryffindor's mouth. Each step felt hollow and Harry wasn't sure why he continued down or why they had started to fight again, for that matter. Except, the reason, itself, could be simple: their past couldn't be forgotten.
Harry, on the other hand, was seething. "Hogwarts is my home." His eyes returned to the mark as he continued. "I can't stay here forever. Dumbledore will find me eventually and I won't have you guys getting wrapped up in this anymore."
"Name someone."
"You don't have to stand there. Take a seat, Mr. Potter." A voice, that Harry recognized as Severus's said from behind the chair as a hand waved around it in greeting. "I won't bite."
"As if," Harry yells. "I'll be bored out of my mind in bed and forced to suffer a prat."
Draco slid his hand across the line in the book. An old one that he had found in the back of the library.
Severus ran a hand through his hair and sighed then dropped down next to the couch. "Why would he use a glamour?"
Harry could remember Ron's face, clear as day, when he had grabbed Harry's arm in third year and felt the mark. He had curiously turned over Harry's arm, who had stilled momentarily unable to breathe. The boy twisted it and turned it, but the skin revealed nothing, it was completely unmarred. Ron's face had twisted until he looked constipated before he finally dropped Harry's arms and returned to his game of chess. Harry had flicked his wrist as if he was stretching it and let his eyes begin to take in the words of his book once again.
Harry Potter sat up in bed and looked at the black clock on his bedside table. That wasn't right, not his bedside table. His temporary bedside table upon which sat his temporary clock. He asked Poppy to get him a clock and, while she looked confused at first, after a quick explanation she brought him one. It appeared to be old, probably an antique knowing the Malfoys.
"You're still a child. You didn't know who you wanted to be. You only knew who you were supposed to be, Draco." Severus grabbed his chin and forced him to look the man in the eye. "Don't ever tell me that you want to be a killer. I've known you since you were a child. Telling me such a blatant lie is stupid."
"Weird?"
Snape snorted and uncrossed his legs. "That old fool? He saw me and fled to Lucius's study. He's probably irritating the man as we speak. How did you know who he was?"
"You really do have some weird friends, Potter."
"Clearly."
"Does everything have to be so... slytherin?" Harry spoke, unsure of himself.
Plus, the slytherin still had some questions for his godfather. In the first place, Harry Potter was a human not an object so obviously a horcrux could be placed in living things. Draco paused on the staircase and leaned against the wall for a moment considering what he needed to do. The Malfoy library was one of the biggest libraries known and would most likely have the information he needed, but it would take time. However, Draco was starting to wonder how much of the truth his guardians would tell him, considering that they're willing to lie to each other.
Draco scoffed as he pulled out a sheet of parchment and a quill, holding it out to Harry. "You didn't seem to trying very hard to be nice either."
Draco sighed and threw away his apple. Pansy might be right. The story was plausible, but Potter lied before that. He followed Pansy into the living room and collapsed onto a purple armchair in thought.
"Might," Severus agreed.
"Because that was all for show! My parents are spies for the light, if I was nice to you in front of everyone it would be obvious that they were faking it and they would be killed." Draco snarled placing his feet between the door and the wall. "I will not be the cause of my parents' death just to make you feel better."
It wasn't veritaserum?
Harry's voice comes across before the visual does. "What? Come to bully your precious son too?"
"Your son?" Harry snapped rolling his eyes. "As if you would know what your son needs."
Sliding open the french door he stepped back into the dining room. The table looked small inside, the chairs all pushed in. He looked around letting the silence sink in as he compared it to that morning. There was no freshly cooked breakfast smell and no conversation to end the quiet.
"Lied about what?"
"Severus? Is he okay?" A voice asked from the hallway and a blond poked his head into the room. Draco didn't look an ounce uncertain and took a step inside when he saw that Harry was awake. "I thought you might sleep through dinner too. I asked Severus to wake you up." Draco explained as he continued into the room until he stood by his godfather.
"I'm not sure what to do." The man ran a hand through his black hair and took a sip of his tea. "I used to dream of escaping my own father but I was never sure what i wanted people to say after they found out. Sympathy? No, that just made me feel worse. Hatred? Definitely not. Them being happy that I escaped felt like I had never belonged to my father in the first place."
Harry turned to find Narcissa and smiled. "One of my friends had sent a letter and I thought it would be better not to leave her worrying for too long." Harry began and noticed Narcissa's frown deepen."I didn't mention any of you, if that's what you're worried about."
"Lucius Malfoy saved me?" he asks again because he still can't wrap his head around it.
"What about the basilisk?" Narcissa asked as she took a seat at the glass table.
"Be careful!" Narcissa called after them as she called a house elf. "Poppy, can you get me a vase?"
"You'll never have to worry about your position at Hogwarts, Harry." Snape stated fluffing Harry's hair before reaching over to the bedside table and grabbing a vial Harry didn't notice before. "You should get some rest," Snape said handing him the potion. "It's a sleeping draught."
"Tell him that Pansy laughed."
When Harry had let it slip, he had expected Draco to be angry or laugh, but the boy had slid over the topic like it wasn't breached. At the same time that Harry appreciated his actions, he also hated them. Harry, for whatever reason, wanted someone, anyone, to be angry for him.
"Boys," Hermione says, rolling her eyes. She opens up the journal beside her and almost misses his response.
Harry stepped back at Draco's tone before he steadied himself and glared. "Of course not. My favorite color is green." He squeezed his arm, angry that he let his anger take over. Draco glanced at him curiously.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You have to take me back! Please, I know where it is!" Harry begged grabbing Snape's coat.
"My father and Snape were acting weird." He replied grabbing an apple. He turned to head back but found Pansy in the doorway.
"You aren't alone anymore, Potter." Draco grinned letting Harry's last name roll of his tongue like it was natural. "Also, my parents and Severus gave up on it. Forcing you to stay here that is. I guess they came to the conclusion that there was no point keeping you here if you didn't want to be."
"Any reason you should be waiting for me to wake up?" Harry retorted leaning against the bedpost as he found his prior adrenaline rush gone.
Harry blinked. Then, the boy blinked again. He couldn't wrap his mind around the idea of Snape apologizing. Even if it had already happened, Harry hadn't felt that Snape was really apologizing then. Now, though, it felt real. Harry could somehow feel that the man was sorry.
Harry shrugged nonchalantly before looking at Draco, determined. "So what if I am?"
He had never before exposed himself so much to another person, the thought concerned him. He wasn't supposed to be getting close to them. He would leave them soon. After dealing with Greyback. He couldn't stay. This time it would be him who leaves.
The silence hung around them like a dark cloud until they entered the dining room. Lucius, who sat at the head of the table, looked at them curiously before his gaze lingered on Draco, questioning.
Harry twisted the knob and leaned his head against the warm tiles. The bruises were more extensive than he thought, littering his back and legs like freckles. He rubbed his face before stepping out of the shower. He couldn't see into the mirror and assumed he had the water hotter than he thought.
He can hear Draco moving, but he doesn't bother opening his eyes to track the other boy's movement. Harry couldn't even if he wanted to. So when Draco's fingers wrap around Harry's wrist squeezing lightly, Harry flinches.
"Just start the spell Granger."
Harry shivered as the cold air caressed his skin. His mind traveled back to the cupboard and its scratchy old towel that he used as a blanket and he wondered if the Malfoys were a dream. A sweet dream like the one he had of his mother and father.
"I suspected earlier, but this confirms it." Lily said.
"Shut up!" Harry yelled at the portraits. "It doesn't matter anymore. I haven't been a child for years so, just, shut up."
"Severus, is he okay?"
"-When I agreed I did not expect to be hounded by you two. Once again Lucius, explain."
Severus steps back from the door letting Lucius tap it open more with his foot as he moves to clear the nearby couch. The walls are lined with bookshelves leaving barely enough room for Lucius to move as he drops Harry down.
While they had both expressed their concern, neither of them had been angry on his behalf or taken the matter to someone else, someone who might be able to help. Of course, Harry remembered with a snort, he had taken to someone else and been refused. Dumbledore had blamed him.
She cleared her throat, "It isn't much of a story but we, the Malfoys, are now members of the 'light' side." She stressed the word as if it were wrong and Harry supposed she was right. The light side could not be truly good, not if they were murdering people. They could not be good, especially, because they had Dumbledore.
"They are known either way." Narcissa assured him. She looked uncertain as she continued, "I thought you said you weren't a gardener Harry?" His hands played with the petal as he nodded.
"Right."
"I think I've had enough adventure for the day." Draco answered as he stood and stretched. "I'm going to retire for the night. I'll see you at breakfast father, Harry." He said nodding at both of them before leaving.
Snape looks at him pointedly and Draco corrects himself. "Draco."
Harry still didn't know how he fit in here. Both, Narcissa and Draco, had confirmed to him that they were spies and planned on severing all ties with the man after he was killed, but Harry wasn't sure they were telling the truth.
"Gone. The boy was under the rubble. I didn't have time to look around so I grabbed the boy and fled. I couldn't exactly go to Malfoy Manor with him and of course, you live with the godforsaken muggles, so I had to carry the boy."
"Oh." Harry whispered, "I'm guessing death eaters attacked then?" He picked at the sheet in thought wondering how the Malfoys fit in still refusing to believe that they had rescued him.
"I'm not sure what you want me to do," Lucius admitted. He was leaning against the fireplace while Severus sat on the couch. Books were strewn across the coffee table and the curtains pulled tight.
"Yes, I'm very curious as to where your wand ended up." He stood and walked over to the bed.
"Of course I did," Draco replied with a pout. "I thought it might make him feel more comfortable around her."
"Don't touch me." Harry croaked as he pushed past James.
"Any reason you should be smiling after just hearing that your guardians hit the cauldron?" Draco inquired fingering a silver ring that rested on his right middle finger.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You didn't have your wand with you when we found you, so who is to say you had it then?"
P.S. : Yes, I am safe.
Draco smiles cruelly. "I'm sorry what was that? You do know mumbling is frowned upon in high society, don't you know? Or do you not have parents to teach you such a thing."
"Potters at your house?" Pansy asked and then burst into laughter. Draco rolled his eyes as he took a bite.
"We aren't death eaters," Draco says.
"Harry?" Draco asked stepping into the room and looking at him nervously. He put a hand on the bedpost waiting for Harry to respond.
"That sounds reasonable. What makes you think he's lying?" Pansy restated looking exasperated. "I really thought you would have something juicy." She murmured standing up and heading back to the living room.
At first Harry's numb. He sits blankly still thinking. Mind turning. Then, just as the door opens, Harry leaps up.
"That doesn't matter. Just take me back." Harry whispered unable to make eye contact.
He smirks again, shrugging as much as he can with Harry Potter in his arms. "Just doing my wizardly duty. If you will let me in I can explain."
"What did you do?"
"Not that I can see. A minor one on his arm, but I think it's from the Triwizard Tournament."
"I wouldn't suggest talking either." Snape reprimanded reaching for some salve that sat on the bedside table. "This will help with the pain. Just rub it on your throat." He passed Harry the salve, cringing at the sight of his neck. "I'm gonna go get the Malfoys. They would want to know you're awake."
"I'm not sure. The only thing I ca-"
____/\____
"If it wasn't for Ron and Hermione I would have died before meeting the basilisk. They get far too little credit." Harry's lip curled as he spoke and he glared at the white floor below them.
"I was nearby when it happened." Lucius starts as he sits in the armchair. He sighs and waves his wand, dishes moving into place as he begins to brew tea. Severus never offered him any even when Lucius came by with permission. "Narcissa and I fought this morning."
Luckily he had a spare container of ink in his suitcase so he didn't have to go to Draco to ask for that. Setting the items up on the empty desk, he sank down into the chair. Running his hands through his hair he began to wonder why he couldn't keep the snark out of his voice when speaking to Draco before the owl hooted, reminding him to write the letter.
Harry nodded waiting until he heard the click of the door before he cheered. He wouldn't have to go back anymore. He knew he shouldn't be happy that they died but he couldn't stop the little bubble of excitement in his chest that fed his smile.
"We are grow adults, Harry. We know what we can handle." Lucius continued, "besides it has already been decided."
Harry crawled to the side of the bed, which he still considered far too big for him, and set his legs on the ground. Harry had taken to going to the library lately, much to Draco's chagrin. The blond had tried to stop him and offered to go flying with him, but Harry knew what he needed though he wouldn't tell Draco. Harry needed to study.
"Oh Harry," Hermione sighs.
"Sir, why are you helping me?" Harry asked looking at the bumps that scattered the walls.
"Just a couple things." He said looking at Severus who tapped her foot under the table. She startled and then smiled.
"Boy! Wheres my dinner?!" Vernon exclaimed as he stomped up the stairs. Harry was tired, so incredibly tired of listening to Vernon's foul mouth speak. He just wanted it to end, all of it. Even his own life.
"Yes, it burned for a moment when I left."
Pansy found it easy to help Draco though. She forced him to apologize many more times after that until Draco was used to it. He didn't reply with a snarky comment anymore. Well, most of the time. Old habits die hard.
Her voice faltered and Harry nodded at her, encouragingly, despite the fact that she couldn't see him. He decided he liked the way the red and silver flowers looked against the blue and began to order them.
When Harry wakes up the first thing he notices is the massive hammer in his head. He can't think beyond the consistent thumping and moving feels impossible. Still he opens his eyes. The light is blinding, but he blinks until he can see.
Harry doesn't blame it, instead he sits up in the bed. The pounding returns with a vengeance.
The way the cobblestones break off in parts and how the houses lean over as if they might swallow him whole.
Lucius' tea floated to him from the kitchen as Severus leaned closer to Harry. "He doesn't have any injuries?"
Draco sighed, "Start the spell Hermione."
"Thank you." Harry said just before Lucius left and he turned and smiled at him before closing the door. Harry stared at the silver sheets as he twisted his wand in his hand. "I suppose you're mad at me." Harry whispered breaking the silence.
"Wretched place. Nearly as bad as yours is Severus."
"Would you like to explain what happened?"
Lucius's hands tightened unconsciously around Harry's body as they landed in between the two houses across what used to be the Dursleys' lawn. Police crowded the cement road redirecting traffic as reporters and investigators tried to understand what happened.
"Good idea Draco." Lucius smirked as he pushed Snape out the door. "Just have one of the elfs hose off the balcony when you're done."
"I don't know." Draco admitted looking at her white cabinets. "My father said that he heard about a raid on Potter's house, but he was busy so he arrived an hour later. He found Harry under the rubble and pulled him out.
Dear Hermione,
He pulled it out and reached his hand even father back before his hand found the worn out brown suitcase that stowed his wand and magic items. Grinning he dug it out of the pile and opening it, pulled his wand out.
Harry Potter doesn't stir in Lucius' arms until he is standing outside Severus' house. The boy moves and whimpers a moment, but settles back down. Lucius pulls a strange comfort from Harry's own uneasiness here. He hates Spinner's End.
"Oh yea," Harry whispered as they left his room. Draco snagged the light before closing the door letting Harry walk in front of him. "I forgot that they left." Harry looked a little worried for a second and Draco couldn't help but grab his wrist to keep him from going ahead.
"I might just do that. I don't know what we could talk about though, but I've always loved gardens." Harry agreed. He wasn't sure if he could count Narcissa as an ally, but he didn't want to make her mad just in case.
At least, in their surroundings, Harry specified as he thought of their attitudes. Even when, Poppy had brought out the food, Harry still found himself absorbed in the mark. His fork absentmindedly stabbed a piece of meat and bringing it to his mouth, but he didn't draw his eyes from it.
Harry subconsciously rubbed his arms as a tingling of regret crossed his mind. He had invited the death eaters in. He had broken the peace that once covered this street like a warm blanket. It was his fault that these cars and lights disrupted the daily lives of everyone and made them abnormal.
Potter, no... the gryffindor, had no reason to trust Draco enough to want him to know about the abuse so Severus couldn't ask him about what happened. At least, not without Draco coming in moments after.
Harry still remembered when Dumbledore had first told him, he had held it in until the meeting was over and scurried to the nearest bathroom to empty his stomach. The sour taste had invaded his mouth just as he suspected it would for the rest of his life if he killed someone.
He shouldn't say that. Shouldn't reprimand James for something he didn't do. Yet, he can't think properly. It was all crumbling again. Returning to Hogwarts; to Dumbledore and his lies.
"That makes no sense. Death eaters don't kick people. When you said they beat you up last night, I thought you meant they cursed you."
His robe skims the dirty ground, but he doesn't bother to pick it up.
"My wand?!" Harry looked around frantically shoving his hands in his pockets.
Harry took a shaky breathe in an attempt to collect himself and with one last tear, let the fabric lay in a mistreated pile. Despite everything the Dursleys had done to him, despite it all. Harry had still yearned,though it was not for discovery or vengeance.
A couple days after his parents told him, he visited Pansy.
She laughed grabbing the edges of her chair, "My god! Draco, I knew you were a virgin but good god!" Her book hit the ground as she held her stomach, squirming in her chair.
"I never asked you to do that!"
"He's strong. I was wondering why he wasn't concerned about being wandless among us. But why did he get so angry when you lied about the veritaserum?"
Draco scowled as he entered the room, his eyes landing on the offending pot of flowers that attempted to destroy the room's color scheme. "What in the bloody hell is that monstrosity?"
Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy had been pleasant at the very least and quite the conversationalists at the most, though, Harry hadn't spoken much to Lucius. As for Severus, well, the man had no way with words, he stormed into rooms more than he walked, and he frequently fled away from something he didn't want to deal with using his potions as an excuse, or maybe he just had unique timing. Either way, the adults, throughout the little time Harry had seen them, tried to make him feel comfortable at the manor.
Pansy laughed for a while after that and Draco soon learned that it was something she did often, especially when she was unsure of how she was feeling. The girl found it easier to laugh and pretend she was happy then to face her own emotions. Which was something Draco hadn't figured out how to help her with to this day.
I'll probably edit in the morning more since my beta reader and I were tired by the time I finished writing. Again. It seems like it's the only time I'm actually able to finish. Early hour writing is the best until you have to edit.
"I don't suppose you could scoot over?" Draco decided to ask as he smiled at Harry. The other boy glared at him, but relinquished the left of the rock. "You like the outdoors?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"So what more do you need to know?"
Narcissa sighed and looked at him pointedly. "At least you know what you did wrong."
"I didn't- I just wanted to get to know him better." Lily whispered. "We hazed the first years like that all the time. Pretending a drink contained veritaserum because even the thought would be enough. I didn't...Why would he..?"
Harry's lip lifted at the corner and he tilted his head to the side as if he were considering it. "You might be right but I like it."
"I was wondering if you boys would make it," Narcissa spoke up from Lucius's left. She smiled at Harry and patted the spot beside her, encouraging him to sit down. The younger boy smiled and gave in to her request. He was happy that Narcissa wasn't mad at him despite the obvious glare he was getting from Severus and Draco.
