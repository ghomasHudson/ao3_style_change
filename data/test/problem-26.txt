Laughing, Harry shook his head. “I am by now long gone from that miracle student. I think Slughorn knows by now that nothing I did there was the actual me.”
Harry smiled and moved his finger in tiny circles on his neck. He knew that his husband always relaxed that way and he was right again, as Draco leaned closer to kiss his earlobe again, his eyes closed.
He cleared his throat. “Just make sure to write down your own name on the adoption papers, just in case.” He was surprised how annoyed he sounded and almost chuckled over his words. And then he would have started to laugh loudly when he saw Hermione frowning and looking at him a little funny.
The Hogwarts professor chuckled and took a treat for Aurora out of her pocket and gave it to her. Alamar could swear that he saw their Krimnee with huge eyes as she purred happily and went off to the kitchen. There, she lay down under the table, chewing contently.
Harry stopped for a small moment, before he got himself together again and joined the dance move again. “How on Earth can you see through my disguise spell? I once even got away from Hermione that way.”
Harry crossed his legs and took his hand, moving his fingers over his soft skin. He knew better than to force Draco to say whatever was making him that emotional. With time, his husband was going to tell him what was going on in his mind.
“Well, I do have a…” husband who has made it his mission to change Harry’s way of thinking about food. He was succeeding very fast and Harry was even looking forward to eating dinner or lunch with him. None of that he actually wanted to tell McGonagall, so he quickly invented something, knowing full well that she would hear the little pause in his sentence. “… a dietary coach, or whatever they’re named. He’s looking at what I’m eating all day and tells me if I’m eating well or not.” Which wasn’t actually far from the truth.
It worked out perfectly and he stood outside of Hogwarts. Smirking, he looked down at Olaf, who seemed to be okay. So, he headed up the long way to the castle, only to be surprised by three people.
He looked up at Nicolai, who still had the same begging eyes that he had when they were in a relationship a few years back. “Don’t you have anybody else?”
Draco quickly turned around to see Severus standing at the open door with raised eyebrows. His mask of neutrality faltered quickly, once he stepped aside to let them in. He smiled at them and they sat down by his table, which for some reason was clear now.
Harry laughed and shook his head. “Let’s be serious for a few moments: Do you want to continue with this Mind Healer?”
“You are such a good boy, Harry!” Pansy beamed at him, which made Potter squeal and he laughed happily. Seeing this made Draco smile over how innocent baby Potter was, even though there were some really heavy things in his past.
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry looked at a book on the table as if this was the most important thing on this world. “Don’t know. It just felt right to be here.”
Harry smiled softly and he closed the short distance without any more words. Draco felt electricity travel through his body as soon as their lips locked and he sighed into the kiss. He had waited so long for this and for Harry.
And well, he found his essay at the bottom and when he picked it up, there was another parchment that got his attention. He quickly cleaned up the rest – placing the books in a neat row on his desk, parchments on the right and grabbed the one that had gotten his interest.
“I love you, Draco Alexander Potter. And you’re perfect for me the way you are, with all the bad memories inside you and your sleepless nights and flaws. Because these just make you perfect for me.”
He kissed his forehead and just wanted to turn around, when Harry caught his wrist. Frowning, Draco looked at him. “Don’t say that, love. You’re not nothing without me.”
“You need to be faster, Weasel!” Nott said and sighed frustrated, though Harry had his suspicions that he wasn’t actually frustrated. “We found so much, I had to grab another piece of parchment!”
“Absolutely not” Draco answered, ignoring the shiver that ran down his spine, and hit his ward over the head with the parchment, which led to Harry chuckling and leaving the room.
Harry declined. “Thank you, Kingsley. I think I’m done with the Aurors. I need to start enjoying my life. I’ve gotten out of a war surrounding me,
Getting up, he decided to take a look around Grimmauld Place 12. He hadn’t been here in a very, very long time. And maybe he could also find some clothes that weren’t the Azkaban Prisoner outfit. He didn’t need to make it that obvious that he had escaped the high-security prison.
Before he could thing more of it, Maria got up and motioned him to follow her. As he did, he curiously looked into the rooms they passed. The one on the right was filled with cabinets and folders and a lot of paper. The room on the left was apparently a meeting room with a comfortable looking couch, a TV and a few other things one would find in their living room. Including a bookshelf. Sadly, Draco didn’t have time to inspect the books as Maria knocked on the door furhter towards the kitchen and opened it.
Smiling, Draco leaned over Harry, kissing him softly. His boyfriend didn’t want to tell the world about them without his consent. That was the best thing he ever heard. “Harry, as long as you’re by my side, I know I can do anything.”
Draco thought his heart skip a beat as he felt his panic take over. Potter was gone? He almost jumped to his feet, before he walked closer to Fred Weasley, trying his hardest to hide any emotions under his pureblood trained mask. he failed miserably. “What do you mean you can’t find him?!”
“What fun” Harry commented and shook his head. His eyes suddenly fell onto a parchment lying next to Malfoy. He had taken a few steps inside the room and didn't seem to have noticed the paper. “Did you lose a letter?”
Sighing, Draco nodded. “I’m really afraid of hearing what he went through in his seventh year. Do any of you know what they were doing travelling around the UK?”
“Why?” Draco touched his hair again, grabbing a few more strains and looking at it. It was so weird! The color was magnificent. It was beautiful and even though it was a five year old wizard who changed his hair, it was perfectly done. Almost professional.
Draco exhaled shakingly and his eyes trailed down Harry’s chest, before he looked at him again, still somewhat scared. “How can I know that this is you and not some stupid potion?”
Draco blankly stared at Evan and needed about two or three seconds to realize that Evan just basically told him that he wasn’t going to accept living as a single. And that once again showed Draco why he had broken up with him and decided not to go with Evan to the Masquerade Ball his mother was holding. That and the fact that Evan was a Muggle and would probably freak out over having to see his parent’s estate. And witches and wizards.
“In your dreams, Malfoy” Harry answered and rolled his eyes. He could see Draco swallowing down a probably stupid answer, one that would very likely reveal that they had married.
“Hold your horses, Susan. We can do that after breakfast. Or at least, after I’ve eaten” Harry chuckled and grinned, as the Hufflepuff nodded eagerly and went back to sit down.
“Well, usually I like to play with the owls then, but I can certainly make space for Harry, if you’d like to have me as a babysitter?” Lovegood smiled widely and Draco nodded weakly.
Potter rubbed his forehead and frowned. He played with the curtain, running his fingers over the seam and probably just enjoying how it felt. He spoke after a few moments of silence. “I don’t feel like I belong in this friendship anymore. They’re much happier without me.”
“Damn, I love this fucking stuff,” she declared heartily, signaling Harry to cheers by raising up her glass. He clicked his glass against hers and smiled. The truth was, he had never really liked mulled mead. But he would never take away Ida’s happiness of him bringing a bottle year after year.
Ron was far less than willing to give the care of his wife over to Harry. Ron attempted to cast another charm (one Harry knew won’t do much of anything), when Draco appeared at Harry’s shoulder. Without warning, he shoved Ron to the side and began a round of spells Harry never would have thought to use. Draco’s extensive research on Chann was coming into good use.
Harry didn’t want to ask, but he couldn’t stop himself, “What about the Room of Requirement?” he said this so quietly that he hoped maybe Draco didn’t hear.
“They have a point there, Mum,” Bill said to Molly, “We can tell them what we know, which isn’t much.”
Harry thought of all the times Draco was there for Harry, in his own weird Draco way. Harry had hidden from these parts of their friendship. He had pushed Draco away for them. And now, Ginny of all people was helping him realize this wasn’t the answer.
“Harry, I want you to be happy!” she wailed, “I just don’t know how to handle this! Ginny is so close to me…”
Malfoy looked almost surprised at Harry’s sudden aggression. He hesitated, then said, his voice even, “I don’t hate you.”
“Of course not,” Harry said seriously. He avoided Draco’s strong gaze so that he wouldn’t see there was more to the story than that.
“Go on,” Remmins stated as he spotted Aviary. He made his way to her. After wrapping her in a quick hug, they began to talk urgently as they walked towards Ida and Aviary’s office.
Harry laughed, “Hermione, you have proved to Ministries time and time again that you and the rest of the British Ministry will do anything to aid the wizarding world. Even the Spanish Minister likes you.”
The four of them stayed for about ten minutes. Healer Patrick had told Seamus that Dean would make a full recovery, but that he was going to remain in a deep sleep for at least a day. Hermione tried to talk Seamus into taking a break and getting a tea, but he refused to leave Dean’s side. She instead went to the canteen and returned minutes later with a tea, in which Seamus gulped down speedily. As they made to leave, Hermione and Ginny decided to stay behind with Seamus for a while, so only Ron and Harry left the room.
Hermione sighed again, but gave Harry a soft smile, “You’re right Harry, of course you are. I just don’t want any Ministries to think we aren’t doing everything to prevent more attacks.”
Ida’s cousin was the coach of Puddlemere United, a man named Aries Reyes. Harry had only met him a couple of times but he agreed with his wife and sister-in-law in saying the man was a wanker. Ida’s family came from a long line of wealthy pureblood Filipino wizards and unfortunately, the manager of Puddlemere United was eager to employ fellow purebloods. Angelina and Oliver were disgusted by the complete injustice of this employment and the incompetence of their coach. Both had been Puddlemere fans their whole life and worked hard to make sure the team stayed away from any acts of bigotry and that they still managed to bring respect to the Puddlemere name. This wasn’t that hard, considering the fact Reyes didn’t bother to show up to half of the practices and when he did, he made useless plays that Oliver changed without him noticing. That didn’t stop Angelina, Oliver, Ginny and much of the quidditch world from despising the entitlement and self-absorbance of the man.
Harry laughed sharply, “I’m glad to know you think Draco is more dangerous than nine years of Auror work.”
“I thought I did,” Ginny spat, “But for you to accuse Blaise without telling me? For you to send him to the Aurors with only circumstantial evidence?”
“Well, you said ‘we need to talk’” Harry said, “Which I took as you had something important to tell me.”
The rest of them stood near the edge of Dean’s bed, holding onto each other. Dean looked like all the patients post- poison-- frail and tired, skin tinged with an odd orange that could be seen even with Dean’s dark complexion. The terrors of the attacks felt stronger than they had ever before as he looked at Dean. It was bad enough knowing innocent muggles were victims to their merciless attacks. Now one of his closest friends was lying weak on a hospital bed, when he should be out there helping victims. Harry began to shake uncontrollably. He reached for Ginny and she hugged him again, murmuring soft words in his ear. He needed to protect them. All of his friends, family. No other muggleborns or purebloods trying to help would die on his watch. He may not be an Auror any more, but he had Draco. He was going to help if it was the last thing he did.
Ron snorted as he appeared from the front yard, “It’s true. Rose was the easiest child in the world. I wish I could say the same for this one,” his whispered as he nodded back at Hermione, who was leading their son Hugo towards the group.
With that, Malfoy stood up and exited through the door, leaving Harry somehow even more confused than before.
“Harry?” Draco asked, his voice strained. He and Aviary were still gripping tightly to Harry’s arm, “Where the hell are we?”
Harry was lying in bed, a book stretched unread across his lap. He hated being alone in his room while the rest of the house clung to silence; even Lily had gone to sleep. Ginny was not home yet, although Harry had assumed “a couple drinks with the team” wouldn’t take until past midnight. Harry shifted in bed. He had thought this lingering feeling of emptiness would go away once he had left the Auror office. He had felt better after the decision; Harry had known for awhile that he had been unhappy with his job. Admitting this to himself had been the hardest part of his decision to leave. Harry had decided in sixth year he wanted to be an Auror and he had never looked back, not even momentarily. He’d never even explored any other job options. Hermione had been the one at school who looked intensively through every pamphlet they had received on career choices. That is probably why she found the perfect job for herself. Hermione was the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. With all of his closest friends finding obvious satisfaction in their respective professions, Harry felt odd with his disenfranchisement by his own career. It’s not that Harry had hated being an Auror. There were many things he had enjoyed; the opportunity to help protect people being the highest on the list. But Harry had felt for too long that his whole life was one long fight against the Dark Arts, and after a while he felt trapped in his past and the person everyone expected him to be. Becoming a healer was something new that felt so right. He could help the wizarding community while making a new world for himself. Despite this, Harry still felt restless. And guilty. He had a wonderful wife, three healthy, smart and inquisitive kids and more friends and family than he deserved. Harry shouldn’t feel anything but incomplete with the long list of positive factors in his life. While Harry could tell himself this over and over, it didn’t change the way he felt or stop his brain from going at a mile a minute. What Harry needed was a distraction, which he hoped would come in the form of Ginny any minute now.
“Draco,” Harry said, reaching across the couch to envelope him in a hug. Draco was tense and clearly reluctant at first, but he soon gave in and let Harry hug him. Harry could feel him softly crying into Harry’s shoulder, and Harry let him. Harry caught a smell of Draco’s scent, a strong vanilla he now associated with the man, and he quickly pulled back, heart suddenly racing. Harry spiked his hair up with his fingers in a way that mirrored Draco and decided to look anywhere but the man in front of him. All he wanted to do now was apparate home and draw a bath and forget about liking Draco’s smell (it couldn’t mean anything, now could it?). But he couldn’t. He had something to say.
Harry tapped lightly on the door frame, causing Hermione to send a long streak of black down her parchment in shock.
“We’re coming!” Al screeched. Harry heard a door bang open and two pairs of feet rushing towards the landing. Harry let out a gasp as he saw what Rose and Al were carrying as they made their way down the stairs to where Harry was standing. They had what appeared to be none other than the family owl, Darren, in an enormous kite form. Harry could immediately recognize the white rims around their distinctive tawny owl’s eyes and the long streak of missing fur on his back from his old owner, who had trained him with physical abuse. Harry lost any feeling of anger he had at the two for taking an eternity to get ready. The kite was extraordinary, representing Darren in mid flight with a wingspan about the size of Harry himself (okay, probably taller, but Harry didn’t really want to admit that to himself). He was amazed at their level of detail and craftsmanship without any magic at their disposal.
“Because it is!” Harry jumped up, fully aware he was being rude but not caring in the slightest, “I need to leave.”
Seamus huffed, “I didn’t know what was happening at the time! We thought it was some ridiculous prank, remember? Anyway, I never said it was the best night of my life,” he paused for dramatic effect, “It was clearly the night we saw the Weird Sisters in concert!”
“Thank goodness,” Seb said sarcastically, “I wouldn’t want the stories you never listen to to be too boring.”
“Actually, there are more than you think, but you’re right. It’s not a good time for an attack. From what we were able to overhear, it sounds as if this attack is much less about poisoning and more about taking control of the Ministry,” Ron explained.
Harry reached into his back pocket and pulled out the phone, knowing full well most of the people that would call were already at the Burrow. A small bout of panic sprang up in his chest as he spotted the name ‘Draco Malfoy’ flashing across the small screen.
He opened the door and breathed in the stinging winter air. His face was flushed and his pulse was racing; he felt out of control. He couldn’t believe Ron and Padma. He thought he could trust them to work with him and Draco. This was going to destroy everything Draco had been working on and it was all his fault.
“Dad!” The loud yell from outside of his door took Harry out of his deep revoir of thoughts. Despite the abruptness of the address, James knocked on the door of the room.
Padma gasped at this while Ida and Harry began to laugh. “I was only trying to help, Av,” Padma said defensively, sending a half-hearted glare at Aviary.
Ida laughed at this and waved a bartender over, “We are going to need some vodka shots,” she said determinedly. Turning to Harry, she said, “I can't stop you from being Malfoy’s friend. But I can stop you from leaving this pub without enjoying my company. Let’s not talk about this anymore.”
The two sat in silence for a while. Harry turned over what Ginny had said in his mind. The rage was ebbing away. He didn’t want to hate Ginny, not for this mistake. He wasn’t ready to drop the fact that she had cheated on him. Yet he didn’t want to yell anymore.
As Ginny settled in an armchair to talk, Harry made his way to the kitchen to help with lunch, yelling for James to do the same. All adults and kids took turns helping Molly with dinner. This week he, James, Roxanne, Bill, Fleur and Bill and Fleur’s son, Louis, were on the list. Fleur was talking to the group as Harry entered,
Harry felt that’s exactly what Malfoy was doing, “You know,” Harry snapped, “I’m also a part of your job. It wouldn’t hurt you to act kindly to me for one bloody afternoon. You could at least pretend you don’t hate me, it wouldn’t kill you.”
The urgent energy that had consumed the room when Draco dragged Harry in had dissipated. All was left was the nasty realization of what the poison was doing to hundreds of innocent people. The whole idea was so despicably genius that it made Harry’s stomach feel like it was made of lead. He couldn’t fathom the amount of people this poison could spread to overtime. Looking over at Draco, he could tell he was feeling the same thing; an all consuming sense of dread, anger and disgust.
“He’s quite easy to please,” Harry heard Ron mutter to Aviary as Seamus turned to talk to Ida about how cool her hair was (she had two braids rolled into buns on the sides of her head. In the middle of each bun was a sparkler that must have been charmed to remain burning without catching her hair on fire. Harry was also very impressed, and he wasn’t the only one. Luna was on the edge of her seat, staring with fascination at the sparklers).
Harry sat up quickly, his heart racing. He couldn’t believe he was having these thoughts. Draco trusted Blaise. Ginny trusted Blaise. There was no reason he shouldn’t.
“You could change the mind of the most stubborn group of people in the Ministry?” Malfoy finished for him.
Aries bristled silently as Harry walked out of the room with his head high. He hoped beyond hope that the Cannons would win, despite Angelina and Oliver being on Puddlemere. Aries needed to be taken down about fifty pegs.
“Hermione…” Ron hesitated, then seemed to make a decision, “No. You need your rest. You’ve been through enough today.”
Harry was more than surprised at the causal question. Hesitating, he inquired, “What does this have to do with my interview?”
Without another word, Draco raised his wand and disappeared into the blackness of the night, back to his son and ex-wife and another world Harry would never be a part of.
Draco, who had been sitting in silence, began to speak when he heard this, “You own the house?!” he asked.
To his surprise, Seamus dove for the wand and grabbed it off of the ground. Harry had no time to wonder what he was doing there, because Ron, Padma, Neville and Ginny appeared moments later. Ron and Neville both cast a stupefy on Aries, knocking him out cold within seconds. Ginny aimed her wand at Ida, casting a Petrificus Totalus.
“Yeah, it is,” Seb agreed, “I’m thinking of having people give speeches before we start protesting. Like in a large tent or something. People can talk about their own coming out stories and the good and bad things they have dealt with while living as an openly LGBTQ wizard or witch.”
“They really do love that game,” Molly observed as Dom scored a goal and her whole team rallied around her, shouting cheers.
Padma looked at Pansy and then said, “It was after the whole scone throwing debacle. I realized that the real reason I was so upset with Pans had nothing to do with her political opinions.”
It occurred to Harry now that he hadn’t told Molly about him and Draco yet. His heart hammering, he realized he would have to do that now. He opened his mouth to tell her, but she spoke first.
“Well, at least I can still get at least one hex in per day. To keep me sane,” Malfoy said, smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, “Are you sure, Potter?”
“No, I have something to say,” he asserted, “I’m not going to lie to you. Being an ex-Death Eater is something that taints who you are. There’s no way around that. But Draco, just because the past exists doesn’t mean it has to define who you are going to be. I have never, in my entire life, met someone who cares so much about atoning for the wrongs they committed. You work every single day to bring justice to our community. I can easily say no one impresses me more. Draco, I was the person who hated you most while we were growing up. I saw you as nothing more than a devious child who would soon aid to the Dark Arts. But, as a think back, that’s not all I saw. I was also intrigued by you. A part of me always knew you were more than you let on. You were so quick to defend yourself, so quick to hide anything real about yourself, that it made me wonder who you really were. And now I know. The real you, the one you defined all by yourself, is the most extraordinary person I have ever met. Yes, you’re defensive. And confusing. And bloody complicated. But you inspire me everyday with your compassion and your relentless drive to fight for what’s right. Draco,” Harry finished, almost out of breath, “You are so much more than your past. The people that matter will see that.”
“Actually,” Seamus continued, “I always kind thought you were a bit queer. For awhile, I thought you had the hots for Cedric.”
“It’s reassuring to see that the Imperius attacks have stopped in the last couple of weeks,” Ida’s voice in the room filled the silence that had fallen over it, “It makes me feel as though our work is making something of a difference.”
“You like him! And this…” he gestured toward himself and Harry, “Was some sort of messed up ploy to make him jealous?”
Harry threw a sheet of paper at Draco’s head, “I did fine enough to become an Auror, so I couldn’t have been that bad! Not everyone has to use the Hermione and Draco technique to get good grades.”
“We are doing something, Potter! We have to figure it out ourselves, prove that we are right. As of involving the Aurors with our evidence, they will only continue to claim it's all circumstantial and not take it seriously. And they wouldn’t be wrong,” Malfoy picked at the corner of a menu as he continued, “We have no solid proof. But we know. Right?”
“Things can be better, Harry,” she soothed, running her hand along the back of his head, “Whatever you are feeling, I am there for you. I will always love you, no matter what.”
“Was there no time for her to tell me this?” Harry asked absentmindedly, knowing that’s not the takeaway of what James is saying but feeling slightly upset at the fact Ginny left without bothering to say goodbye herself.
“Alright, Harry,” Draco emphasized, “Do you maybe want to head back to the Burrow since I made such a mess of your afternoon?”
“That’s incredible!” Harry said, “Surely you know my friend, Hermione? She’s the head of International Magical Cooperation at the Ministry.”
“To tell her to place the bug,” Draco answered simply, “I gave her multiple ones weeks ago. If I have Aurors on the inside, I might as well give them all the tools I can.”
Harry felt a little guilty at these words; although the attacks were still at the forefront of his mind, his main reason for avoiding Seb had to do with the fact he was like a bright and over smiley version of Draco, and Harry hadn’t wanted the constant reminder of his seemingly one-sided love. Now, it stung even more to see Seb, but it hurt less than facing his friends and family at a time like this. They would all want to discuss the divorce and Harry’s sexuality and the hell that had become Harry’s life in the past few days, and that’s the last thing he needed right now. He was hoping Seb would just be a positive spin on his sadness and a good distraction from everything that was happening in his life.
“Here it is,” Ron said softly after stopping in front of a hospital room door. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny followed him in. Dean was lying on the white bed in the center of the room, reminiscent of Aries and Blaise only hours earlier, but far more tragic. He was sleeping softly. Seamus was sitting in the chair next to the bed, his hand interwoven with Dean’s as he stared done at the man in question. At the sound of the four pairs of feet against the hard floor, Seamus looked up. His eyes were red and glassy, but a smile broke out on his face when he recognized his friends.
Pansy looked at him, as if she knew what he was thinking. “Someone hurt baby Harry, Draco. His cousin pushed him down the stairs! He wasn’t even two years old. What do you think happens in the next few years? Do you remember how small and thin Potter was when we first saw him? I thought he was someone accidentally asked to join Hogwarts two years too early.
Sighing, Draco looked back over the lake. That was a very good question. He hadn’t understood it himself yet, though he knew it deep inside his heart that he’d finally had enough of the Ministry.
His mother had read the book to him and he’d had nightmares about this book for a week and his French wasn’t even that good. But Harry had actually gone far beyond his own French skill set, so… who knew what Harry was going through.
“Depends on what you’ve made” Draco grinned and turned to the rather rich looking breakfast. There was so much on the table that it looked as if there was no free space. “And it looks like you’ve made everything.”
Harry jerked as he felt Draco’s lips on the back of his neck. He shivered and stepped back, trying to make his husband stop. He should have known better than to force Draco to do something… He felt his arms snake around his body – too low for just a hug.
Potter seemed a little restless, so Draco pulled his teddy bear out of a bag and his ward’s eyes grew big. “Yes!” he stated and Draco chuckled, giving him the bear, which made Potter say something in his French-English-mix.
After the initial silence, Weasley was the first one to speak up. “They mentally abused him: They put bars at his window, so he couldn’t escape.”
Pansy arched her eyebrows quickly and smirked. “If you’re ever late, you have now been officially warned!”
“Normal horses or magical ones?” Harry asked and put the brush back in favour of grabbing the lesson plan hanging on the entrance.
Harry wordlessly stepped back and motioned to the kitchen table. Since the kitchen was next to the entrance it wasn’t really an inconvenience to invite people to sit down there. And he could always make tea without having to tell the guests to wait for a few minutes until he was back with the beverage.
They entered the Three Broomsticks and walked after Ron who sat down on a long table, where Blaise and Pansy had chosen to sit. Blaise was already buying a round of Butterbeer and by the time Harry and Hermione had gotten to the table, he placed them in front of everyone.
There are still a few countries that might change their mind: Switzerland is still on the verge of choosing either side. It might be best to leave while it’s still open and Italy has seen a more relaxed approach to the creature laws. For now, Italy might be the next country to open the borders. We’ll keep informing you if anything changes.
“There’s an emergency, I’ve got to go. Just head down the next corridor to your right. You can’t miss it.” With that he hurried back into the direction where they had been coming from.
“On second thought” he started and turned back to Harry, “I’ll go and meet the Minister by the front and lead him in.” He walked off, while Harry bit back a smirk.
“I wake up in cold sweat, feeling the Dark Lord breathing down my neck” Draco answered and shivered with even the memory of the nightmares. “I can see his eyes in the dark in every corner. I can see him sometimes when I’m sleep deprived in every teacher.”
“Of course” Harry answered. There was a weird knowing grin on his face. Before he could comment more or before Draco could say something, Pansy walked by and told Harry to go to bed, since they were going to do the work! And it was already three a.m.
Opening his shop on the afternoon again, Draco stopped at the threshold and frowned slightly. It had been so normal to have Harry around and now, him not being around was a little… empty. Shaking his head, he opened the door. He smirked when the trumpets sounded, just remembering how Harry had always laughed at the sound of them and placed the cup of coffee on the front desk. He turned the radio on and whistled along to the song playing. As he walked past the picture which Harry seemed to have taken a liking to, he stopped and turned.
Just as quietly as they had walked up the stairs before, they did that again and landed on the floor, where Ron and Nott should have looked around. Harry couldn’t find any signs of life and he turned to look at Malfoy, frowning.
Before he could go any further however, he felt himself pulled away. Finally, after resisting a first, he separated, glaring at the person next to him. Draco seemed to have the same reaction as the Gryffindor next to them held up his hands, his wand ready to use in an arm wand holster, sticking out.
“Really?” Jason widened his eyes, before he smirked. “The Christmas Banquet of a certain Pansy Chevalier?”
Neville chuckled and shoved Harry slightly. As the official Auror to arrest Skeeter that day, he had known everything about that.
Oh, he was enjoying this too much! Draco inhaled loudly and Harry got ready for the shouting match. His husband didn’t disappoint. “WHY DID YOU BRING THE ONLY THING TO THIS SCHOOL THAT HAS DESTROYED MY SANITY! FORCEFULLY BEING TRANSFIGURED IS A
Chuckling, Harry motioned her to the small kitchen at the end of the hallway. “You don’t need to ask me that, ‘Mione. Maria is a phenomenal cook and whenever she catches me not really eating, I’m ordered to come by her house and eat. In a way, she’s worse than Molly.”
The Department of Will Assessments thanks you for having found the lost will of James Fleamont Potter. You are hereby officially invited to the will reading, taking place
Draco accepted the peace offer and they shook hand. Soon after, Fred joined as well and they took a piece of treacle tart each, disappearing into the stair case again. Through all of this commotion, Mrs. Weasley, well Molly, sat in her chair, watching with wise eyes over what was happening. And Draco actually caught her raising her eyebrows when Harry climbed up the couch to sit next to him.
“Harry,” he emphasized, “You can’t treat me this way. If you are uncomfortable working with me, you need to tell me instead of treating me with disrespect.”
“I got to Sorry Fred three times, Uncle Harry!” Roxanne said giddily, as Lily jumped out of Angelina’s lap to wrap herself around Harry’s legs.
Harry let out a laugh; the first real one he had given in days, “Are you sure it wasn’t you staring at my arse?”
If Harry wasn’t mistaken, Padma didn’t look as upset as these words warranted. He knew Padma well enough to know she loved every aspect of her job, even the less glamorous parts. In all honesty, she would make a great Head Auror one day, much better than he would have. Harry may have been good at his job, but Padma was better; she was more diligent, eager and determined than anyone else in the department. Not that he would ever tell Ron that; he knew how much his friend secretly wanted to be Head Auror someday.
Malfoy snorted and replied, “You’re strange, Potter.” He leaned back in his chair as he turned sideways to look at Harry.
Harry looked eagerly at Ida, “Did you all find some new evidence? Or discover anything about the attacks?”
“Zabini wasn’t going to get the Head of Security job,” she showed Harry the paper. At the top, the name ‘Hugo Ranz’ was listed as the new head of security, “Ranz was. Then the next day, Ranz disappeared and Zabini was declared as Kingsley’s new choice. The Aurors focused on Ranz’s disappearance only. He was already working in Security and was a promising candidate, so we thought he was taken out by the Imperius Attacker. But, Harry,” she turned to him in excitement, “What if that’s not the takeaway? What if Ranz disappeared solely for Zabini to take his position? What if Zabini himself caused the disappearance? It would explain how Zabini was chosen out of everyone to head the department!”
“She really did it all, didn’t she?” Ron asked, his voice dangerously soft. Then, without warning, he kicked the chair in front of him, sending it across the room.
“Yes,” Padma sighed, “I think we’ll have to pull an all nighter by the looks of these paperwork stacks.”
“That sounds really cool,” Harry said. His racing mind was forming many more questions about Scorpius’s magical creature loving mother, but he thought it to be highly inappropriate to ask them to a child, no matter how articulate and intelligent this particular child appeared to be. Harry wanted to know whether Malfoy’s wife was of pureblood heritage, and how Malfoy had ended up with someone who held a profession that seemed far from what Malfoy deemed acceptable while at Hogwarts. Harry had not forgotten Malfoy’s attempts to get Hagrid fired in Care of Magical Creatures and his blatant disrespect for both the class and the creatures involved in it. Above all, though, he wondered whether Malfoy’s wife held the same prejudiced views of muggles and muggleborns the Malfoys and Blacks had held for centuries.
No, he liked these nights, because they were safe. No sane human being would go outside, the floo network wasn’t to be trusted with the earth shattering from thunder and possible lightning strokes and the long thick rain made it unable to see anything in front of you in any further distance than your outstretched arm.
Harry snorted and shook his head. “No. But you always do something and Kira said sometimes you go back home and fight with other fairies for your land. So you’re a warrior.”
Silence. Both were just drinking their hot chocolates and Harry was clearly trying not to look at Draco. However, he knew that with time and patience, his ward be manage to gain enough energy to tell him what was going on in his mind.
Harry nodded and got up with some difficulties. “I’ll head to bed. You are very welcome to stay in whatever room you’d like. Everything in the upper floors is empty; I haven’t been up there in a year.”
“Of course, Sirius” Draco smiled and walked out of the kitchen and out of the pub without looking at the guest, even though he thought he had seen a rude gesture towards him.
“You’re going through all emotions at once, huh, little bear?” Draco smirked and ruffled through Potter’s hair, while he squealed.
Draco rubbed his forehead. “I got a letter from Potter’s mother, accompanied by the official will from Potter’s father.”
When he had almost reached the dungeons, he heard footsteps behind him and sure enough – once again – Severus had gotten a hold of him and motioned for him to take the teddy bear. Draco sighed and shook his head.
As a vampire, Alamar would be shipped back to Croatia or wherever they thought vampires were from. And once he was shipped back there, he was in the system. No creature wanted that. There had only been a few reports of creatures who survived and ran away after years inside it. What they said wasn’t good.
Harry threw his head back while he burst out laughing. It sounded so different, so confident. “Honest to God, Theo, this time I did not intent on scaring you. I thought you heard me coming!”
His manager laughed lightly. “Everything’s fine, Harry. Don’t worry about us or the customers, we’re great.”
Draco was surprised that this statement actually worked. Maybe it wasn’t just this, maybe Potters friends were a little worried about what had happened to him, so they were happy that someone was tracing his steps.
“I doubt that” Draco grinned and turned around. “Now get rid of all these stupid clothes and get the fuck in here!”
He looked over to the table where Draco was and saw him fuming and glaring at him, though now it seemed to be his turn to only barely keep it together as he turned back to Pansy and said something, which made her look at him now. Shrugging his shoulders, Harry looked at the box, Hannah was opening. He wasn’t really in the mood to play a game – well, any other than the one Draco and he were currently playing – but he still stayed.
“Oh, we all have sleepless nights” Blaise sighed. “Pansy and I have had a shitty day and we couldn’t get any peace, so we decided to make a little music.”
The Gryffindor had apparently decided quickly and approved. “Could you still get either of my little helpers?”
“I don’t think I’m the right person for him. Maybe I should give him to his friends. They... they might work better with him. Also, he might start to remember me and we hated each other in school.” Draco stopped and widened his eyes. “Oh you brainless hoodwink! You gave me Veritaserum! Why would you do that!?”
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry looked at the boiling water and poured it over the tea, watching it settling down. “Ever since I got cursed, I believe.” He remembered how in St. Mungo’s everyone had just thought it was the cause of some kind of medicine he had been given. Nowadays, they didn’t even check anymore.
“This is not the last time we’ve talked about this! You’re still my son and I will do anything in my power so you won’t throw your life away.” He swore a few more things as he opened the door and walked out.
After Harry left Seb, he fire called Ginny and kids and told them he would be home after he made a stop at Hermione’s. He told Ginny he had a question for Hermione visa ve healing, which was a lie. Harry supposed that because of the real purpose of his visit, he was in the clear for a lie tonight.
“Oh, yes, plenty, Mr. Brayan,” Malfoy said, trying his best to look pleased to continue with the interview, although Harry could spot the clear annoyance blooming behind his facade of a smile, “I’m sure I can fit whatever you have to say about Mr. Potter into my story.”
Harry’s head whipped back towards the match. Kingston must have spotted the snitch, because his broom was soaring across the field at a speed Harry knew all too well. The Cannons seeker, Alisha Waint, was on his tail. Harry and the rest of the stadium held their breath as he watched the race towards the snitch. The only one who seemed to be moving besides the seekers was the trolley wizard, who was still determined to sell his food. Harry watched Waint creep up on Kingston until the two were neck in neck. Ginny had been right about her seeker; the girl sure could fly. Then, suddenly, Waint did a nose dive towards the ground while Kingston continued to soar forward. Kingston stopped moments later, and looked, like the rest of the stadium, at Waint. She had landed feet first on the ground and had one arm in the air. In a moment of heavy anticipation, she opened her fist, revealing the snitch captured inside. A roar of cheers burst throughout the stadium. Harry saw Ginny run across the field, red hair flying as she launched herself at her seeker and embraced her in a triumphant hug. Harry jumped to his feet and cheered at the top of his lungs as pride for Ginny overcame him. He reached down to pick up his daughter, who was screaming herself hoarse, when a blood-curdling scream pierced through the waves of cheers.
Malfoy nodded solemnly, “A bloody disciple more like it. And my father tried to pretend he hated the music as well, but I never bought it. I saw him once put on one of her albums while alone in his study.”
“They are,” he agreed sharply, “But right now I have a job to do. They shouldn’t have been here at all.”
After a while of lying like this, Ginny pulled away. Al and James moved to sit on either side of Harry. Lily stayed curled up at his side, a constant reminder that nothing had changed. These kids were still the most important thing in the world to him.
As the kids all decided on the order they would sit in, Hermione gave Harry a long hug and pulled back with a look of sympathy that consumed her face and made Harry look away. Harry was glad that Ron hadn’t heard about any of Harry and Ginny’s love lives, because the two were already in an awkward enough situation as it was. It had been a week since Christmas, and Harry had been stalling working together on the investigation to prevent the multiple unwanted conversations that would follow. He was avoiding Ron and Padma because he was still so upset with them that he knew talking rationally at the moment wasn’t in his arsenal. He was avoiding Draco because, well, looking at him reminded Harry of everything that was confusing and messy and too damn complicated in his life.
“You little Snake! I will get you!” he called and ran after Harry who was surprisingly fast. That however didn’t stop Blaise from chasing after Harry. “Come back here!”
Draco sighed. There was no way around this. Harry would probably not refuse to meet her and therefore would be found in the Manor this afternoon. Rolling his eyes, Draco threw the letter onto the floor. There was no way around it: He needed to go to the Manor as well.
“Very funny, Draco” Pansy rolled her eyes and sighed. “It’s actually three if you count the two half birds in me.”
“Holy shit, I am so sorry! I didn’t know, Nick!” Harry widened his eyes and placed the cup of tea back on the table. Watching his ex closely, he saw how he was actually fighting the tears. Even though they weren’t together anymore, Harry really wanted to hold him. He still decided against it – something was holding him back, and he didn’t know what it was.
“Hey, guys” she smiled at them nonchalantly and then at Harry who grinned back at her, while he continued eating a piece of Toast happily again. “Did you hear that the DADA professor left? He went back to America – said there’s much less depression in the air.”
“This is the reason I came by actually…” Before his old friend could continue, Harry held up his hands and looked remorseful.
“You work for Dumbledore?” Eric asked and looked up from his tea. Alamar could see him almost chasing her out of their house.
Smirking, Harry pulled Draco into another kiss. He always felt so happy whenever he was close to the Slytherin. Just the warmth of the other man’s skin, the smell of his shampoo and the careful eyes on him… all of that was what he never knew he needed.
With the text sent, Harry turned his attention to the client room, quickly cleaning up everything, placing books back into the book shelve and correcting all the little details, which he had started to love. Finally, he placed a spell onto it that fluffed the cushions and cleaned up everything he hadn’t noticed. Which wasn’t much.
In his shop, he found Pansy standing in the middle. Draco stopped shortly and wondered how she would react when she’d see Potter following him. However, out of all the things he had imagined, he would have never thought to see her widening her eyes and running towards him to
She had always been able to run around and never got caught for anything. Mostly because she was the brains to Harry’s… stupidity and Ron was the person with wizarding knowledge. So while he could stop any idiot acts Hermione was about to do, Harry was also usually the one to just go through fire, making her acts irrelevant as they had to save him from whatever stupid thing he had gotten into.
“Alright!” Seamus called and stopped up, stepping between them. Harry was a little surprised and he could tell that Draco was as well, though he hid it perfectly. “Stop it, both of you!” He had his hands up, looking at the two of them. “You need to talk it out.”
Ian narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest. He turned to Potter and looked at him, while the other man was eating slowly. “Did your rebound guy just threaten a food critic?!”
If they had been a couple before the accident happened, would he have taken care of Harry? Hell yes. “Of course!”
As if Severus had read his mind – which he probably was – he smiled at Draco and then turned to Harry again. “I will see you here in my office once you’re in your normal age range again. Until then, you’ll have to listen to any rules Draco sets for you. I hope you understand that he’s your Magical Guardian.”
The young woman nodded and practically beamed at him. “He helped me find my husband. We’re happily married for almost five years and I can’t think of another way to find someone. In return, we decided to offer him a place to meet potential customers.”
Daphne snorted. “Come on, Harry” she grinned. He thought that she did a really bad job in hiding the malicious glee in her expression, as she continued. “What did you do with the Muggles?”
As if Aurora realised someone was talking about her, she raised her head and looked at Minerva McGonagall and meowed before stretching and rolling on her back, exposing her belly. This was the ultimate show of trust. Apparently, Aurora trusted their guest completely.
“Stop, please” Draco panted, as he separated just quick enough to say these words, before kissing Harry again. His brain was just sending mixed signals. But all he really wanted was to be kissing Harry.
Harry chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. “Most of them don’t exist anymore. So she might know more, now!” He then turned back to his friend, hoping she would answer his question from earlier.
Nodding, Alamar softly brushed a lose hair strain out of Harry’s face. “See you in a few hours then. I’ll make sure to have some cookies ready, if you want.”
Harry snorted. “Jee thanks. I think I’ll spend my Christmas here. I’ll talk to you once you’re okay with me dating whoever I want.”
Draco chuckled and placed his hand again on his stomach right of top of Harry’s. “And yes, this one truly was an accident. I had put up the magical blocks as usual, but Harry’s just too powerful a wizard. Might have to change to Muggle protection, huh, love?”
You should also include a bed time story. They might be not ready to listen to stories and might try eating the book, however, by reading to your child they get familiar with your voice and with time learn that reading books isn’t as bad as people think it is. Even picture books are perfect for babies; cuddle up and read something together.
“Why?” Theodore asked and frowned as he looked over to his wife, who was in a rather heated discussion at the girl’s table.
Ginny chuckled. “Don’t worry, Harry, you had a rather strong excuse. I mean, I saw you as baby.” She pushed some of Harry’s strains of hair out of his face and smiled. “Actually, talking about that, I am really disappointed that I can’t have a small Harry Potter running around my living room. You make an adorable baby!”
Harry really couldn’t handle it. He glared at him and then burst out: “Fuck off!” With that he ran into the woods, Padfoot behind him and he slid behind a rock, throwing up a few charms, before he snorted a laugh and fell to the floor, almost dying of laughter.
He smiled and placed his arm around her, pulling her a little closer. If there had ever been a distance between them, it had clearly disappeared, as they seemed closer than ever.
Accepting the offered hand, he greeted the boy with impeccable manners. “Benjamin Brown. Nice to meet you.”
“Mate, you’re a terrible liar!” Ron motioned to the red color on his shirt and Harry looked down and made it disappear, though not before waiting about a second for Pansy to catch it.
He cleaned the plates and the kitchen, before he walked out and saw to his surprise no more Potter but Ian, Neil and his boss, Quentin King.
His ex sat down and placed everything on the table, looking at him sternly. “Most important question, Harry: Did you or did you not have sex in the castle?”
“I could tell he was going to dark places. He said he could make people do bad things. He could speak to snakes and that he could hurt the other children.”
Draco snuck closer and peered into the opening, though beside thousands of shadows there was nothing inside. He inhaled deeply and walked in. As he stepped over the threshold, magical fires lit up along the upper walls of the library and Draco widened his eyes at the sight of it.
“Interesting” she said and smiled. “Late yesterday evening, Hermione, Ron, Pansy, Blaise and Anthony had come by and told me that I needed to do something as apparently this class reunion was the reason you and Draco were having arguments after arguments.”
“Nothing really. I’m still working tirelessly to get some kind of approval in the Ministry.” Jason sighed, but accepted the cup of tea.
Draco sat up and looked down at his ward, who had his eyes closed, but grinned broadly. “Harry, you’re just asking for me to tell you you’re not getting any dessert today!”
Draco frowned slightly. Did they know what happened to their friend? They must have… Well actually, maybe everybody knew what happened to Potter. If their Savior suddenly disappeared, they all would probably like to figure out what happened. Draco almost laughed, when he thought about how bad Finnigan must be feeling over turning the Savior into a baby.
“We know.” Kingsley chuckled. “It’s not really my duty, but I would like to tell you nonetheless; I will not accept you as Head Auror until you’re twenty-five. I hope you understand.”
“I think” Draco finally started and bit his lower lip. “I’m not sure if… I…” He groaned, frustrated, and rubbed his face with his free hand.
Millicent sat on a blanket, calmly reading a book while hiding away under a warming charm. Grinning, Draco quickly forgot about his meeting with Severus, where he had told him that due to his reputation and position in the war, his favored job as an Auror was not going to work out. They wanted people with clean registers, such as Potter or Weasley. People who had fought on the right side and won.
“Sirius Black. It was nothing special, a summer romance and him telling me that nobody could ever know.” Snape smiled sadly. “After that summer, he went back to bullying me with his friends. But it hurt so much more.”
“Yes” Draco answered and turned back to his clothes, grabbing a new white shirt, before he headed down into the showers.
Draco couldn’t resist and started to laugh. It got the attention of Harry who was playing in the mud and jumped up, running at the two of them. “What are you talking about?” he asked and placed himself in the middle of them. He seemed incredibly happy and Draco had realized rather quickly that he had stopped wincing whenever someone touched him. Actually, he was back to his old self. Somehow, Draco was sure that it worked that way, because he had never done something bad, like beaten him or...
Harry held out his hand and chuckled over the now shocked Malfoy. How the tables had turned. “Let’s shake on it, Malfoy.”
“I’m not drugged up, darling. I’m doing this, because I want to” Harry commented and moved on all fours towards his husband, softly forcing him to lie down. Draco followed, though hesitantly. Harry kissed his temples. “You are my one and only.”
Harry chuckled and Draco heard a door open again. “I’m almost done, Maria, one second” he said and turned back to Draco. “I’ll see you tomorrow then. Don’t worry about the matchmaking, I’ll find your special someone by the time the ball comes around, okay?”
Before he could say anything however, Potter placed a kiss on his lips. Draco rolled his eyes. “I said it before and I will say it again: I hate you.”
“How did you get in here, Harry?” Draco asked and sat up in his bed, clearly confused. He wasn't so much confussed as to why his ward was here... Harry knew he could always come and talk to him. He was more confursed that he was still wearing his white shirt, though it was really crumpled and his trousers were not looking that nice as well. Not that he would have really cared: Harry was here! In his room!
“Dag!” Pansy called out and hugged the owl who seemed rather happy to see them. He really had transformed from the shy owl in a dark corner to the beautiful, stunning and confident owl he now was. The letter on his feet was from Harry.
“What I wanted to say is that you can always ask Harry, now that he’s got all his memories back” he continued after a short silence.
“Yeah” Draco confirmed and smiled weakly. That didn’t sound good. Even though Harry was doing well physically, it looked like his head was still playing tricks on him. Maybe the curse was far worse than Draco thought… “Who else is here?”
Before he could start with the client room, his phone vibrated and he took it out to see a text from Ginny.
Kevin stood next to him again and shook his head. “I will never be able to understand this craft. Even trying to find a perfect couple is complicated, but this...?! They never said anything about rose pedals falling from the sky! How in Merlin’s name did you figure out that they wanted that?!”
“Well, where we come from, every child knows your name” the man who wasn’t Eric said and motioned to his own forehead.
“I just know that Gregory went to Russia after Hogwarts was finished. Something about starting anew.” Hannah shrugged her shoulders. “I think Anthony is a Healer in St Mungo’s?” She looked at her husband, as if to confirm that her information was true.
Nodding, Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I can’t let the fake lawyer leave without a little showdown” he said as if that was the worst idea ever.
Severus passed the wine over to him and Draco sighed. “Why did I think wine was a good idea, yesterday?”
Once again, McGonagall explained what her intentions were with this room and how proud she was of it. Apparently, a lot of students came here to learn or study about the history of Hogwarts.
However, he had no idea who these portraits were. Maybe Dumbledore had one there? Or his godfather. He seemed to be close to him. It was also possible that the werewolf or other people would be in there. Draco had no idea.
It was quite for a few moments, until the Minister nodded. “I understand. You’ve been in contact with the bad side of what humans do ever since you were a small child. It’s only natural that you want to find something else.”
“Nope” Teddy sat down by the kitchen table and grinned. “I think Heinrich has powers over the tree house as well, because it was really warm inside. I slept very well!”
He couldn’t stop himself but interrupt again: “I am not your son.” Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “But it’s nice to hear you got out. You didn’t do nearly enough, though.”
“I’m supposed to be the most important person in this room!” At this, both Potter and Draco started laughing and Ian walked out rather angry.
Draco rolled his eyes, but motioned his ward to follow him. “Let’s get you clean, Harry. We need to give a good first impression to this gentleman, right?”
Malfoy chuckled and again shrugged his shoulders, as if he was showing his empathy like that. And with that, he climbed up the ladder. Harry shook his head and looked at the walls. Why did it always have to come down to him?! Shaking his head, he finally followed his Auror partner up the ladder and placed the torch in the middle of the room right next to the trapdoor. As soon as he had left the room, it went out. This house really was watching him.
Well, even if there was a serial killer coming to his place, Draco was sure that with his level of magic, Potter could easily defend himself.
to swear” Severus snarled. He looked at Granger, who smartly kept her mouth shut while Weasley glared at his professor.
Harry started laughing and Draco chuckled as well, while even Remus laughed over how clumsy this thing was. Remus stepped in front of the Boggart and it quickly transformed into little Teddy… transforming into a werewolf.
Harry caught him sharing a look with Alamar who smiled and nodded softly. Stuffing more chips into his mouth, Harry nodded and waited to find out where this was going to go.
Finally, eight days after they had finished their studies at Hogwarts, Pansy came over and moved into Severus’ guest bedroom, Draco’s room or rather Severus’ study. And with her arrival came a rather distinct owl.
The Minister checked his watch and sighed. “Well, I must be going. Keep up the good work, though, Harry. One day you’ll end up as Head Auror.”
Lucius frowned at him and seemingly just wanted to open the door completely and walk by Draco, when the door opened on its own and Harry appeared there. He was sporting ripped jeans and a sleeveless dark green shirt. On his side was their daughter and Draco found a protecting bubble charm around her. Harry had apparently also set up a view block of the crib in the back so Lucius wouldn't be able to see their baby boy.
“Let me just tell you, that you need to hide this thing between the two of you a little more. There have already been a lot of theories from everyone” Pansy said and smirked, before she added: “Neville thinks you’re in a relationship.”
This made Dean beam and he nodded, eagerly. “I’m looking forward to that! Thank you so much, Harry! You’ll make a great Headmaster.”
The Slytherin had a telling grin on his lips, as if not even he did believe what he was saying. They stopped in front of the Room of Requirement and while they waited for the door to build, Draco leaned forward, placing his forehead on Harry’s. “The second I saw you on these damn stairs, I knew you were the man for me. And you didn’t judge me, you let me be me and helped me through everything. You’re not only my husband, Harry. You are my best friend, my personal saviour and my biggest reason to stay alive.”
Ron grinned. “Well, I’ve already volunteered to be the DADA-professor. If you’d be interested, I can also be Head of House for Gryffindor.”
“I just thought I’d thank you for another nice evening” Harry couldn’t really reveal that there were people listening. However, if Toby had been a wizard, he would have clearly been in Slytherin, so his manager caught up rather quickly.
things about him. So, he would rather stay out here, hope that Harry would... somehow remember good things about him too. He had been raising him, right? That was a good thing?
“Neither did I” Harry admitted and smiled softly. “My soul mate told me and got me in contact with a Muggle association that helped me pick out the correct dog for my psychological problems, which turned out to be PTSD.”
“Aviary, cast the shock spell on him!” Draco instructed, referring to the large man she had apparated in with who was shaking harder than the rest of them. As Draco fired spell after spell, he yelled at Padma to cast anapneo on her patient. Harry rushed towards Padma and began to replicate the charms Draco had cast on Hermione and the blond woman moments ago. Thankfully, his own research and his ability to learn quickly in urgent situations paid off; the charms he had cast worked and the man was shaking less and less as Harry continued to fire spells.
With that, the room sloped away from the topic of Draco Malfoy and back into the wedding planning of Parvati and Lavender. Grateful for the distraction, Harry mentally prepared to make up with Ginny, Ron and Draco later. If he ever figured out what to say to them, of course.
Dean heaved a loud sigh, “I guess I can only hope our wedding night made the top ten of your best nights.”
“Of course,” Ginny replied, her voice tinted with a coldness that stung Harry, “Well, good luck. I hope it goes well.’
With all that in mind, Harry was also trying to deal with the fact that Christmas was only days away. Not to mention the larger problem about what to say to Dean and Seamus. Dean had only recently left his bed in St. Mungos and was now recovering at home. This gave Harry faith that he and Seamus hadn’t… well… shagged. Harry knew the longer he waited to tell them the more of a chance this abstinence was going to end, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. If he knew Dean, he was in bed miserable, desperate to get back to his job. The last thing he needed after the traumatic events of the hospital attack was Harry telling him that he had lost all ability to reproduce and that he could spread this to his husband. Harry focused on meeting with Draco, Ron and Padma and ignored the guilt building up inside him. Thankfully, Draco hadn’t asked him about it. Draco hadn’t asked him much of anything, lately, that wasn’t directly related to the case. Harry knew Draco wasn’t over how rude he had acted by blatantly ignoring him for a week straight, but whenever he tried to bring it up, Draco waved him away and told him to focus on the investigation. With all of this on his mind as the weeks gave way to Christmas Eve, it was no wonder Harry felt anything but the Christmas spirit.
“Was this house really the headquarters to the Order?” she asked. Harry heard a hint of excitement in her voice for the first time since she had arrived at his house that evening.
Harry made his way to the next room and read the note on the door. His instructions for Zabini were nearly identical to his instructions for Reyes. Their injuries were probably similar. Harry only knew that Aries had broken his arm from falling from a high altitude during quidditch. That left Harry to wonder whether Blaise had anything to do with it, but he hadn’t wanted to ask Reyes out of reluctance to talk to the prick anymore than he had to.
Padma shook her head, “Not exactly. But Ron, Ida, Aviary and I have been in charge of sending Aurors to patrol muggle communities where we believe strikes are most likely to happen. So far, we seemed to have stopped attacks for the time being. We haven’t seen any usual activity in awhile.”
The bright early morning sun was streaming through the curtains in Harry’s bedroom, making it impossible for him to go back to sleep. He chose to sit up in bed, head propped against his three pillows as he replayed the previous night at Dean and Seamus’s apartment in his head. Seamus had told Harry that Draco was not only upset over their argument, but upset enough to tell Blaise about it. Draco obviously valued their friendship to some degree, perhaps more than Harry had thought. Sure, there were plenty of times, like last Sunday, when Draco had told Harry to come to the park just so he could run his thoughts by him. But there were other times where Draco seemed still reluctant to share information with Harry, as if it cost him too much to share everything with him. Harry knew they had created a friendship of sorts, but he didn’t know how Draco regarded that friendship. Then again, Draco had agreed to call Harry by his first name, something Harry couldn’t have envisioned in his wildest dreams. The event was so momentous Harry could hardly believe he had basically forced Draco to call him Harry the week before. Maybe it all goes to show they have created a legitimate friendship that either of them knew how to handle. That, Harry reasoned with himself, is why he felt a strange feeling to hug Draco the other day. The two had formed an unlikely friendship that neither was prepared to handle. They actually cared about each other no. There wasn’t any way for that not to be weird, right?
Harry looked at Ginny frantically. This wasn’t the way he wanted to tell his best friend that he was getting a divorce from Ron’s sister.
“Like to drag out the story, don’t you?” Malfoy mumbled, scratching down Harry’s words on a parchment.
The sight made Harry laugh. This laugh came with a surging feeling of relief. It felt so good to laugh after last night and this morning. He sat down at the table and took his own slice of blueberry pie (it was the only pie he would eat; he did suppose he was a bit picky) and began to eat.
Ron nodded and he and Hermione left the room. Draco walked over to the bed and bent down, giving Harry a painfully slow kiss.
“Neither of them are big touchers, though,” Aviary pointed out, “Actually, they kind of both hate most contact in general.”
Draco stared at him for a second, expressionless. Then he said forcefully, “Come through before I change my mind.”
“No,” Scorpius responded, once again excited, “She works as an expert on magical creatures! The first floor, as you probably know, is for patients that have been hurt by magical creatures. She works with healers to help cure patients with injuries from the most random animals I have ever heard of. And I know plenty,” Scorpius continued, “My mom got me my first book on magical creatures when I was only four years old!”
“I know that,” Harry murmured, “I faced many of them myself. But, does it really matter what someone is born into? Dumbledore once told me something about how people prove who they are when they grow up and separate from their family’s ideals. Malfoy has his own views now, which are quite the opposite of his parents.”
Harry felt a wave of guilt wash over him. Why hadn’t he gone straight home to his kids? What was he thinking, going to Draco’s?
“Precisely,” Draco declared, standing up to pace the room, “This is monumental information. We can’t risk letting Kareach know we are onto them. And there is no bloody way not a single person in the ministry isn’t involved in this.”
“Kareach? The rumored Voldemort- esque society?” Hermione asked skeptically, “Once again, what does that have to do with any of this?”
The glare sent a shiver up Harry’s spine that he quickly jotted down as guilt, “No, I’m done screaming. For the time being. You never know how our conversions will go.”
Taking a deep breath, he braced himself as he looked up at Draco, the words of Blaise’s interrogation on his lips, when Draco moved forward.
“Potter!” Brayan shouted, running over to Harry and giving him an unexpected hug, “We are so glad you are alive! I was just with Draco Malfoy, and he said you were hit by what could have been a killing curse. I was besides myself with worry.”
“Hermione,” Harry reassured, “You have most likely been sending owls and answering floo calls all day. You can’t stay in the office all night. You and all the Aurors deserve a chance to recoup. The Ministry will not fall apart in your absence.”
Draco stared at him for a second, a look of panic overtaking him. Harry tried to find something to say but felt like his brain was moving too fast to produce intelligible words. Draco turned and began to run towards the edge of the bleachers, leaving Harry in a cocoon of desire and longing so acute he didn’t know if he could get himself to move. Slowly, he got up and made his way to the loo. There was no way he could face his family now when everything, from his tousled hair to stinging lips, suggested he had just made out with a bloke underneath the bleachers at the most important match of his wife’s career.
“I wouldn’t put it past her,” Harry said, remembering the fierce Bat-Bogey hexes Ginny gave while at Hogwarts.
Nodding, she sighed. “He doesn’t know me. I’ve been keeping an eye on little Harry Potter. And I was very surprised to see him in this very house, enjoying himself.”
“Actually, yes. That is an amazing idea.” Harry nodded and thought for a while. “Call it the Potter Papers and that way I can always be ahead of the news published about me and I can defend myself
When Harry realized that Draco stood there, leaning at the book cases, he looked up and grinned. “Hey Dray! Want to play with us?”
When he turned back to the pub, she must have seen him looking at the brunt wood, since she quickly offered up some explanation. “Oh that! That was the Big Fire! This was our town hall, which we never used, but it was nice to know it existed. Right before Sirius came to live with us, it was blazing fiercely. We could stop it from burning down, but we never rebuilt it. Sirius had the idea of the pub and decided to stay and rebuild it. He left the burnt wood here behind glass for some reason.”
Now, it only was about nine months until the baby was born… should Harry really be pregnant, which was highly unlikely. Or maybe… maybe it was likely. Harry felt butterflies in his stomach, thinking about having a baby. It was a good feeling.
Please to not give Harry to his relatives. My husband’s family is too old to live until Harry reaches Hogwarts’ age limit. If he’s to live with them, he will be surely put into the Muggle Orphan System. This isn’t all that bad. Do not – under any circumstance – give my son to my sister and her husband. They have a small boy as well. They will ignore Harry and hate him for having magic in his blood. I know they hate him: they already do and we’ve just seen each other twice in the last few months. Even if you think that it will be good for Harry to grow up surrounded by family – do NOT hand him over to her.
“What?” Minerva widened her eyes and leaned forward. “Albus, this is very bad news! What if the Death Eaters got him? He’s just a small child! We need to find him. We should alert the press and...”
Draco was slightly surprised by this question, but decided to answer it honestly. “All the time, Harry.”
He found Draco in the kitchen. His eyes were teary and he stared at a potion that stood in the middle of the table.
“Harry, what is going on with you?” Hermione asked, while he placed his phone back in his pocket. He felt it vibrating and hoped that Draco had agreed to send him some help. Or maybe he was coming himself! That would be the highlight of this evening.
Okay, so Draco had a terrible secret. Not really terrible, but he would never ever want anybody to find out about it. He loved… Muggle romance movies. They were terrible – nobody ever met like that in real life anyway and how they portrayed the love and things that happened had always annoyed him.
“Draco Malfoy!” a sudden voice was calling through the shop. A redheaded man walked out with a huge smile over his face. A day like this could happen?
Draco let go of a peaceful and relaxed sigh. He closed his eyes and rested his head on Harry’s legs. “I never would have thought something like that would happen to me. Like... me being happy...”
Ron was speechless, which Harry thought was also too good to be true. He let a fake yawn go and stretched. “Mate, I need to go to sleep, I hope you understand. We can continue this amazing discussion tomorrow, if you want to.”
His godfather sighed. “For that to know, I do have to tell you about his past or rather mine. Lily, his mother, had finally gotten us fools – by that I mean her husband and me – to talk to each other. We weren’t friends, by no means but she wanted us to at least be able to be in a room without trying to kill each other. Lily took Potter to meet me a few times before they died and every time I gave him this teddy bear to play with.”
And well, once the first sun beams hit England, the Golden Boy had disappeared. Nobody was ever going to find him in the UK ever again – at least for a few years. Eric and Alamar had made sure of that.
Once the tea was done, Harry poured it into a mug and the strong smell of jasmine green tea with a less strong fragrance of cherry blossoms and honey hit the air. It shouldn’t work very well together, but it was the only thing that helped during the night.
Since Great Britain is one of the most powerful nations, there are a few countries that have closed their borders for creatures and keep a close watch for any movement. Here are the countries that aren’t safe at the moment, adding to the list of last month: Germany, Poland, France, Spain, Netherland and Belgium.
Harry smirked slightly. “At this rate, I would be disappointed if there wasn’t something up there.” He gave Draco a quick wave and walked into the room, where he stopped dead in his tracks. As he turned around, he looked at Draco. “I forgot to ask you, but do you have a wand?”
You know I’ve been researching every second of free time I get! There’s just nothing that has all your symptoms! Maybe you just think that all of that is part of one curse, but your mind is just playing tricks on you.
Well, this was new. He almost looked desperate. In fact, he was desperate. He had lost something and just now found out by accident. And at present, he wasn’t able to figure out what had happened.
Harry’s friends would ostracize him should they realise he was into Draco Malfoy of all people... He needed to ask someone else. Someone who wasn’t as judgemental or wouldn’t tell his friends. At least not for now. Harry’s eyes fell on Neville and he nodded, getting up.
Draco quickly took it away and shook his head. “We’re not starting with dessert! And I have no idea what you’re saying.”
“You could have died?” Pansy widened her eyes in clear shock. Even Draco wasn’t sure whether or not the mediwitch had told him the whole truth.
“Neville got kicked out of his home when he went with me, because running away from the Aurors isn’t really what you’re supposed to do. So, he’s not really doing all that well. I tried making him come tonight as well, but he kept repeating that he was only going to see you, when he had a job” Harry sighed and shrugged his shoulders. “So that’s what we did with our lives the last week. And that’s only summarizing the first five days.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, while Kingsley told Draco he would be investigating this as soon as he had the paperwork filed. And with that he left. Draco could tell that Harry’s mind was racing with ideas and whatever else there was to find in there.
Harry got up from his chair and walked over to him, quickly pinning him to the cupboards without any means of escaping, as his hands were on each side of his hips. Draco looked up with a one-sided grin. He raised his eyebrows, waiting for a response.
Nodding, Pansy shrugged her shoulders. “I know. There’s nothing you can do. Granger already told me that she won’t take ‘No’ for an answer. And I mean… we both know what happens when you try and go against her wishes, right?”
My taste has returned, thank God. I found my interest in cooking again, whenever I find the strength to do something for longer periods. I still can’t keep things down for long, but I really enjoyed eating. Luckily, I don’t have to stop.
In answer to this, Blaise laughed loudly. “I’ve got Harry by my side. Bad luck will never reach us, right, babe?”
Smiling softly, Harry started playing with Draco’s hair. “What if someone comes in and sees this, darling?”
“Snow!” With that, Harry pressed some snow down Malfoy’s collar. The Slytherin shrieked and jumped away from Harry, though the action was already done and the icy water ran down on the inside of his shirt.
The Slytherin let his hands wander over Harry’s hair. “I have not the slightest idea, love” he purred and pecked his lips. “But it’s been the best decision I’ve made in my entire life.”
Pansy laughed and turned back to her ice tea. While the elves placed ice cream on the table and another two ice teas, Harry sat down. Pansy didn’t seem very surprised, nor did she seem convinced by her own words, which was a little weird.
“I have no idea” Draco responded and grinned. He looked at the house. “Do you like the name Heinrich?”
Harry Potter checked his watch, before he stopped. And while he stood there, watching the small second hand racing around the never ending path, he realized that once again for the second time in one week, he was late.
Harry held up his hands. “Fine.” He groaned. “I won’t say anything stupid towards him for the next three days. I promise.”
Pansy growled. She actually growled at Draco and threw her hair back rather dramatically. “Stop being pessimistic, Draco. Do something to get out of this depressive mood you’re in. Maybe go to bed, darling. A new day might give you new ideas or at least a little break.”
Harry grinned, whistling for Padfoot who came running. “See you next week” he said, before Draco apparated them back to Hogwarts. This evening had been a nice ending to this crazy week. There should be nothing else happening.
Draco chuckled and leaned back into Harry’s embrace. He looked at Emmet who was holding his ears and looking after Lily and Severus rather annoyed. Harry cast a quick silent charm over their son and he relaxed.
The news of how Draco had lost his name, had travelled rather fast and were proven on Monday, when one of the professors had wanted to tell Draco to do something, but couldn’t get his name out. For the morning, people had called him Mr. Nemo, Latin for nobody. Too many of Draco’s classmates (from all different houses) had however revolted and it had in the afternoon quickly changed to Mr. Perdita, which wasn’t much better. It just meant that he was lost, which… yes, he was. But people shouldn’t have to point it out to him. He did feel honored that his classmates stuck together and at least
When he wanted to turn away and head to bed, Potter suddenly opened his teary eyes and looked at Draco. He stopped in the middle of his movements and smiled softly at the Gryffindor. “Yes, bear, how are you doing?” He noticed how soft his voice had gotten, though he couldn’t care less. Something had changed.
Draco frowned. If Granger hadn’t known something like that, how would she know about all the other stuff?! Maybe Potter kept most of these things secret, not wanting to make his friends concerned for his well-being…
As they sat down without any words – Pansy next to her boyfriend, Draco next to her and Blaise, Theodore and Millicent on the other side – the door opened again and Hermione walked in, next to Weasley, Finnigan and Padma Patil. The last two were really weird additions to their little group, Draco thought. He wondered why they were here, but decided not to say anything. Actually, none of the people present had been saying anything.
“Well, my dog is actually a psychiatric service dog and helps me with my PTSD that I have from when I was a child and then with everything surrounding the war.” Harry finally explained. “I guess it was stupid leaving him behind, since all of this has the possibility of giving me PTSD.”
“It’s Luna, Ron. I’m sure she manages to get in wherever she wants. She knows all kinds of secret passages” Hermione explained, giving him a pointed look, since he hadn’t gotten back to reading the book.
“Nobody thinks of a perfect pureblood girl with a dirty mind. That’s how I survived this long. Smile, wave,
Professor Snape also hadn’t been the nicest to them, as they were doing an explosive potion. One wrong ingredient and the whole cauldron could literally explode. Draco had already a bet running with basically everyone of Slytherin that either Potter or Finnigan would be exploding their potions today. Other people were betting on Longbottom or Granger, while others thought that Weasley looked a little too confident.
That’s all for today. Too tired to research more. My energy levels are leaving me so fast, I’m sleeping for the most part of the day. If I were to die in my sleep, that would be nice. Goodbye cruel world.
“You know what?” Hannah said somewhat excited. “That is so true! It shouldn’t have taken Harry more than two hours to get his dog!”
Draco smirked and just wanted to say something, when Potter’s ex decided to show them that he was still here. “Hello!? You can’t just ignore me!”
So, Draco complied and told his friends what had happened and how long this was going to last. Also, apparently, since he was in Slytherin, Potter was allowed to stay with him. Draco wasn’t really happy about it, but maybe he could somehow take Potter’s memories of the place when he was older. Once he had finished his fairy tale, everyone seemed gobsmacked.
Draco shook his head and watched as Potter got back to drawing. “This shouldn’t be possible, right?” he asked, only slightly concerned.
His best friend glared at her homework essay from Astrology and groaned. “I heard some Gryffindors talking. He was in this group: they said how Slytherin’s okay now, but how we could never be normal. They said we could never find happiness and love and even like our lives!”
“It’s not even about the hairs, Pans. It’s about the fact that I was a jerk to him. I bullied him for losing his parent, for Merlin’s sake!” Draco rubbed his forehead. Should Potter actually get all of his memory back, he was surely not willing to stay with him. He had done and said some really mean and hurtful things over the past few years and even though Potter was a very forgiving person, he wasn’t sure that the Gryffindor was ever going to forgive him.
“Of course!” Her smiled widened and she motioned him to follow her. They walked around the corner, where a few booths were set up as if they were for private meetings. “Milos is almost never on time. Anything I can get you?”
Well, there was nothing easier. Alamar pressed the door handle and it opened through the power of the welcoming vampire spirit emitting from the door mat. Whoever had invented them and made them normal was Alamar’s favourite person – well right after Eric, of course.
Ever since they had been on the run, he had hated the dark nights. He couldn’t sleep in the dark, not when he thought he could see Nagini’s eyes everywhere. And what if the trappers were back and had surrounded him? He needed to stay awake, keep himself safe and stay alert at any time.
He sat down and looked at the table, where his hot chocolate had magically changed owners and Eric smirked at his husband when his eyes finally reached him, while Harry tried his hardest not to smile over their actions. Alamar shrugged his shoulders and opened the book to start the fairy tale Harry had never heard.
Chuckling, Draco sat down on the floor, his daughter on his lap and Merlin walking around them, while their daughter petted him softly. Just then the door was opened again and Harry appeared. Draco turned to look at him and saw his husband with a huge grin on his face. It was a loving, handsome grin.
to clarify: I am not a fan of physical violence and I will not have someone go over there and beat her to death or something! My question is just... if something were to happen to her, would you mind? ;)
In this week, Draco had been able to take Potter to all the private classes. Blaise had accepted looking after Potter in his free period, where Draco had to go to class for the Study of Ancient Runes. Well, Pansy had gladly looked after her new boyfriend – which was how Draco called Potter in front of her – when he had to go to Astronomy.
“Eric has a gift for guessing people’s names” the man sitting at the table said. “He’s got a talent, though he’s not always right about it.”
Harry smirked, placing a hand around his husband’s waist. “Thank you, Parvati. Means a lot, really.”
When he finally made it, he braced himself, walked in front of the room and heard a door appear. Draco opened it quickly to find… an empty and rather dismal looking room. There were a lot of dirty white looking pillars and quite a lot of windows, even though it didn’t actually have windows around. They had been magically created and the scenery in front of it was equally as magical. It reminded Draco a lot of the Ministry.
“Fuck,” Malfoy mumbled, looking down accusingly at his empty glass, “I forgot about that. I wasn’t going to finish the last of that glass.”
James rolled his eyes but grabbed Lily’s hand and led her over to the large group of cousins that was growing as more and more families arrived.
Now that he was here with Hermione looking back at him, he wasn’t sure he could tell her. Sure, he had told Ida, but that had been a moment of traumatic and frantic desperation. And, as much as he loved Ida, he didn’t have the same connection with her. Hermione had been his best friend since he was eleven. She knew him extremely well. Ida knew him well, but not in this way. He had been through hell with Hermione and she had always been there for him. This was the same girl he had brought on a hunt for Horcruxes. The same girl he had set a framed mass-murderer free with. The same girl who would do anything for him. Telling her this felt like what Seb had said: that it would change their entire friendship. Just like Seb, though, he needed to be brave enough to move past that and just tell his full truth.
“Okay,” Harry said softly. Seamus stood up and helped Dean to his feet. They looked to Harry, who shook his head, “I’ll stay out with Draco for a moment.”
Ida shook her head, the long braids running down to her waist moving accordingly, “No, they were not. They are good people, just privileged. Yes, even Aries,” Ida added as Ginny made a skeptical grimace, “Aries is a prat through and through, but he isn’t inherently… well… evil.” She shuddered and then continued, “None of our family holds prejudiced views. Our ancestors have seen too thoroughly acts of injustice against people for things they cannot control. That’s actually why I became an Auror here in England. I wanted to help fight to make the world better for others as moving to England did for me. Now, of course, the Ministry of the Philippines is much better under the direction of Aquino, which is a relief for all of us.”
Draco seemed to be thinking of what to say. Harry tried to ignore the pang his heart gave as he watched the feelings of worry and guilt flash across Draco’s face.
“It would!” Harry jumped back as if the paper was on fire, “I can’t believe this! What if it is him? He’s been messing with my wife and my… Draco,” he finished lamely.
“Harry!” she said loudly enough that Harry turned back around. She looked terrified, even more so as she began to cast silencing charms around the room.
“Thank you, sir. It’s really been all my pleasure, getting to work under you and all.” Harry knew he was sounding like a bit of a teacher’s pet, but he had learned from the best. Hermione had always won the support and admiration of all of her professors, so it wouldn’t hurt for Harry to play into Brayan’s clear excitement for him.
“Thanks Rachel, I can take it from here.” Harry gave the young, blonde-headed girl a polite smile and turned to walk down the corridor.
The name felt weird to say, as if it was tabooed like Voldemort’s name had once been. He had never said Draco’s name if he could avoid it. Harry hadn’t realized how much it bothered him; but if the two were friends now, shouldn’t they call each other by their proper names? Harry was determined to break the schoolboy taboo and address Draco by his actual name, not the surname Harry knew Draco did not value as much as he once did.
“Why are you still up here? James has the field trip today and he has to be up early,” Ginny huffed as she moved across the room towards the door to the hallway.
He apparated to Ida’s house on the evening of the twenty seventh, bottle of mulled mead in hand (Ida’s favorite). Ida’s living room matched Ida’s personality perfectly: orderly, but filled with a personality and scheme of bright colors unparalleled by any other. He admired once again the large Filipino flag Ida had embroidered herself that hung over her couch. Harry knew that while Ida did have negative experiences living under the Filipino Ministry throughout her childhood, she still held her culture in high esteem and did whatever she could to help make sure the new minister, Aquino, had everything she needed to provide for a new generation of Filipino wizards and witches smoothly. Ida still went back once or twice a year to aid her talents as an Auror and volunteer with private Ministry organizations.
As Hermione pulled back, she murmured something so softly that only Harry could hear, “You need to tell her, Harry.”
“It’s true,” Padma confirmed, “I already choose the tall, dark and handsome bloke in the corner,” she gestured towards the right of the bar. Harry gave a start. The man was Blaise Zabini!
Harry realized his kids were all listening in stunned silence. He told himself that there was no way they wouldn’t find all of this out eventually, so it wouldn’t hurt for them to hear it now.
Surprised at the sudden change in Malfoy’s behavior, Harry said nothing. He wondered if the new Malfoy he had briefly witnessed was only for his family’s benefit.
“Healer Brayan!” Brayan exclaimed, moving to pat Harry on the back, “I’m sure Harry here has told you plenty about me over the course of your little interview!”
“I’m queer!” Harry yelled, “I like more than just women. I’m not entirely sure how to label myself. I haven’t really figured that out yet. But that’s not what matters. The point is that I have had messy feelings for a man that I don’t know to deal with. That’s much different than your little affair with whatever wanker you’ve been pining after.”
As the words left his mouth, he knew they weren’t even close to being what Aviary needed to hear. Nothing would be. What happened to her was something that could never be fixed with words.
“Everything’s drenched in mud from practice, I don’t think you want me to do that.” Angelina explained, glancing down at the white carpet of Harry’s living room. But before she could protest more, her arms gave out and her equipment landed all over the floor.
“I haven’t given up searching!” Harry retorted defensively, “I still look every night before I go to sleep! Ginny thinks I’m the world’s best student.”
Harry dropped his nephew’s hand and moved past his friends and family into the yard. He barely made it to a bush before he hurled directly into it. His head spinning, he sat down on the porch steps and began to sob into his hands. He was with Dean when the attack happened. He could have stopped all of this. What if Seamus and Dean had already had sex? Then they couldn’t use either of their sperm. He knew adoption was an option, but he absolutely hated having to take their desire to use surrogacy away from them. With his usual irrational behavior, he reached for the phone in his pocket and began to dial Draco’s number from memory. He needed to talk to someone that would understand his pain completely. Sure, Ron and Padma were inside, but he didn’t want to talk to them about how to handle this. Draco was the one who knew what to do and what to say.
Harry walked into the Healer training room today with excitement. Despite his lingering exhaustion from the days before, Harry knew he would feel better once he was at St. Mungos with concrete directions to follow and a sense of purpose. No, he wasn’t a Healer yet, but he was working towards that and was aiding Healers on the way. He could feel purposeful knowing that.
Nott rolled his eyes and pressed the door handle down, as if to show that it didn’t work. The door clicked and the Slytherin widened his eyes, tearing open the door and walking out with out-stretched arms. “Freedom at last!”
Harry watched it closely. He hadn't really realized how much Malfoy had changed. While he still seemed to be annoyed by him, he was much calmer and even joked with him. Harry was sure that he wasn't the only one who had received mind healing therapy during their last year. Malfoy couldn't be so calm without it. While Nott gave his friend the list and Ron once again argued over how easy it seemed to Nott and Malfoy to get along while he hadn’t gotten any information from the dark haired Slytherin, Harry shook his head. He turned to the door and watched the door closely.
Draco chuckled. He motioned to the ring. “That’s what Heinrich showed me. A juniper family heir loom. I think it works quite well with your eyes.”
In their special corner, someone had added a playpen and Draco placed Potter inside, giving him his teddy bear and just some baby book, he had found on the table. After Potter seemed to be happy there, he sat down, head in his hands, groaning over his situation.
To his surprise, Harry shook his head. “I don’t really mind. As long as you’re not going to be a creep about it. If I see you staring at me from the corner of the room when I wake up, I will call the Ministry immediately and have you arrested again.” Harry grinned. “That’s my worst nightmare, to see something in the corner of the room.”
Before he could think of something hopefully funny to say, a voice broke through the silent room and Harry looked to the door, where Daphne stood and stared at the animals playing – or attacking more likely.
“Good, I think.” At the amused look from Neville, Harry decided to tell him what he meant with ‘I think’. “I can’t really tell. Next to people asking me what I want to do with my life now that I’ve basically served my purpose and others telling me I should start a cult...”
“How long ago did that happen?” Draco shook his head. If he would have called any of his friends ‘teacup’ that would have probably resulted in a not so friendly duel.
Potter nodded and stroked with Draco’s... or rather Benjamin’s brown hair. “Then why would you want to go back? You could... you could stay here with me.”
He poured some coffee walking over to him and offering it to his husband. Draco accepted it and smiled. He mouthed ‘thank you’ and sat down by the table, while Harry headed back to the stove.
Nodding, Harry agreed. “I know, ‘Mione. But when I’m with him, I feel so... alive. He makes me see that sometimes life is good. Tragedy happens, but nature always moves on.”
“Harry!” another voice sounded and Harry didn’t even have to turn around to know it was Hermione who hurried through the room to pull him into a tight hug as well. “I missed you!”
“We talked to him about two months ago; he said he was heading towards York. I’m pretty sure he’s going to go to Scotland.”
“We bonded after the war. Nevermind that, am I right? You’re not interested in trying to find someone too pureblooded?”
Harry groaned and let go of Draco so he could sit up properly – well as properly as possible in a huge bed. “How long did we sleep?”
“’Mione…” Harry said calmly and looked at the empty cup of tea. “Why did you…” he left the sentence unfinished and sighed. A love potion. Of course. It was so stupid of him to think that Hermione was going to let things unfinished. Draco had gotten one and he had just assumed that since his husband had received it, there was nothing else circulating.
“Hold on! You can’t just say Chamber of Secrets without… I don’t know. That thing actually exists?” Millicent asked, clearly confused and maybe even a little scared.
“Thank you. And thanks for the coffee.” Draco chuckled, while Harry shrugged his shoulders and walked closer. “You honestly don’t need to stay. Kevin needs you in the office, right?”
“Darling?” Harry turned to Draco when he pulled the thin jumper over his head. “What would have happened if we really had hated each other and I had tried to withstand the love potion?”
In the Common Room, Blaise and Pansy had once again built up their music compartment and even though they had tried to cast a strong silencing charm, they hadn’t managed to do so. As soon as Harry and Draco had passed through it, Draco felt his boyfriend strengthening the charm and it warmed his heart.
“So Harry” Eric started and smiled. “You know how we took you away from your relatives? There was a reason why we left the country.”
Draco shrugged his shoulders. “We’ve been separated for five months already, Evan. I never wanted to get back together. I have my own life right now. You should as well.”
“Everything is resolved. And if he takes the potions, there won’t be any repercussions” the Druid stated and smiled. “I was even able to heal the scar on his forehead. It’s still there, but not as visible and weirdly shaped. The scar was apparently a place to hide a curse and since Dwarfbart removed the curse, everything is fine.”
“Sure.” Harry rolled his eyes after he made sure Ron heard the sarcasm. “I’m in the kitchen, by the way. Not that anybody asked, but I do not want a certain someone to find me” he said. If he knew his meddling friends, Draco would be forced into the kitchen, maybe Pansy would actually try to seal it and Harry could give him the potion… just in case. Neville would make sure that Draco wouldn't eat anything with a love potion inside until then, hopefully.
Humming happily, Harry nuzzled deeper into the crook of his husband’s neck, wishing for this class reunion to be over now rather than tomorrow. He just wanted to be home, snuggle up with the love of his life in bed, enjoy a lazy day of reading, snuggling,, cooking together, maybe a little sex, whatever.
It took a while until Harry had stopped trembling and crying. Draco held him tight, wanting to give him as much comfort as he could. He could tell that Harry was absolutely exhausted, when he inhaled deeply and leaned at his shoulders.
Neville summoned two glasses of fire whiskey. “Nevertheless. The weekend is here and I am free! I’m heading to St. Mungo’s, tomorrow. Should we meet up in Diagon Alley?”
Harry turned, kissing him. “I know, darling.” He turned his husband on his back and kissed him softly again. “I love you, Draco.”
That moment, the door was opened again and Draco Malfoy walked in with his friend Pansy Parkinson in tow. They seemed to be talking about a former Slytherin Prefect who had been sent to Azkaban and was now free again, since the Ministry had admitted to just imprisoning him due to lack of any actual investigation.
Parkinson shrugged her shoulders. “You got me. My parents have a small estate in Cornwall. The Ministry took it and has all the horses and animals there. I don’t want them to sell either the house or the animals. Could you talk to the Ministry and maybe put a good word in for me?”
Malfoy apparently already waited for them. “Weasley’s hurt, I see. What happened?” he asked, while he performed a few spells.
Well, Pansy thought he would come back, but even she thought it would take at least a week. Now it was about twenty four hours and he was standing in Draco’s room.
By the way, yes I know half of these comments are mine, answering your comments, but without your comments first, I would have had nothing to answer to, so in my opinion, this is still worth a huge thank you and another chapter ;)
However, Draco just shrugged his shoulders. He pulled a small piece of paper out of his pocket, enlarged it and gave it to Harry. Curiously, Harry opened the bow that seemed to keep everything together and found his own flyer. Remade.
Harry woke up in the middle of the night to his stomach rumbling and hurting like hell. He rolled to his side and pushed the blanket around his hurting body part, so it was a little supported. Groaning, he pulled his legs closer.
There was a giggle around the Common Room and Draco shook his head.  It was nearly midnight! “Why is he still awake, Theodore? Pansy!”
With another kiss on his temple, Harry placed his arms around his husband and got up. Padfoot jumped down as well and walked over to the door to the dormitories. He pushed it open for Harry and continued walking up the stairs. Smirking softly, Harry followed his dog. He carried his husband up the stairs and snuck into his room. Neville already knew he was married to Draco and well… Ron was going to find out in the morning that they didn’t hate each other.
Draco glared at him, though it didn’t have any impact, as Harry snorted. Shaking his head, Draco shoved him to the side and rolled his eyes.
Pansy smiled. “You have more feelings towards him that you want to admit, Dray. However, I felt the exact same thing! It’s awesome that he feels safe here! Also, it kind of is his house now…”
“Why thank you, love. I think we can agree that we both are rather amazing at playing our class mates, though I am honestly not sure how we could top this tomorrow.”
“Victor thinks you’ve killed a man and are avoiding police. Preston believes that you are actually married, but had an affair and somehow there’s also a child involved.” Potter frowned, while Draco smirked about their theories. “Connor considers the option that you are actually a maniac trying to kill everyone in this village.” Potter shrugged his shoulders, smirking, and Draco had to place his orange juice on the table so he wouldn’t spill it, laughing. “Oh, and James feels that you’re looking for the girl that broke your heart, after she ran away from you, because you asked her to marry you and she said no. Or the other way around, I don’t remember.”
Draco’s heart was indecisive. On the one hand he was very sad that Harry had another nightmare and he wished he knew how to stop them, but on the other hand... he came to find him! He trusted him so much that he walked out of the safety of his bed to be with him.
“I don’t know. It reminds me of how happy you were and that even if I made some mistakes… You didn’t see them.”
Pansy definitely assumed something, when afternoon came around and Draco was incredibly nervous, walking circles in his own room. He had been nervous all day long, even though first he'd had no idea why. The only thing he knew was that Harry had been the center of his thoughts lately.
Harry sighed and turned around to look at the people discussing this problem. “We could maybe jump out of the window?”
Softly brushing a strain of loose hair out of Harry’s face, Draco smiled up at his boyfriend. “I’m not a pureblood wizard anymore. I couldn’t care less about how to behave properly.”
Sighing, Draco decided to interrupt his best friend, since she seemed to start explaining the whole history if the spell, which Harry really didn’t need to know to understand what happened. “With the spell, you take a person’s life as an example and perform this spell on any number of people you want. The spell gives the chosen victims everything that happened to the example. Sometimes you can take things away, but normally you just give them everything.”
Draco chuckled and hugged his ward. “Thank you Harry! But why did you organize a whole party in my name?”
Potter frowned and tilted his head slightly. Draco inhaled and tried to keep his composure. There was something about the Gryffindor in this light at this hour with this look that made it really hard for Draco to think about anything else but dragging him into his room and having his wicked way with him.
Aurora walked out from under the table and jumped up onto her lap. Minerva chuckled and petted her as well. “And I will be missing you too, Aurora. Keep an eye out for little Harry for me, will you?”
The party is like last year on the 25th. Charlie can’t come earlier and George said, he usually gets the most sales tomorrow. Please come by and tell Draco that he just needs to live with Ron’s careful ignorance. That is if you and him are together. I do kind of think that’s going on, since you haven’t answered anything. I will be on my best behavior.
Madam Pomfrey looked at Draco and smiled. “The last time I saw you, Mr. Malfoy, you were going under the name of Black. I assumed you didn’t want to upset any healers.”
Well, he had finished his Healers Studies, but found no practical work. St. Mungo’s wasn’t going to accept him, since everyone was scared of him. And there were not really any hospitals around that needed his help. In fact, whenever he had asked for practical work so he could finally finish his apprenticeship, they just told him that they had already found someone for that position. So, he had given up on that and went into another profession. One, where he could also work with Muggles who didn't know what he had done during the war.
Finally, after a good two minutes, he pulled himself to his feet and walked to the kitchen, Draco right behind him. He opened a kitchen cabinet and grabbed a green glowing potion in an identical vial as the one he had given his former classmate.
Blaise looked up as if he was incredibly confused by this answer. “You don’t? Didn’t the Aurors give you basically a free-pass to join them?”
Draco rolled his eyes over how Harry was pretending to be brave. “There are so many more bad memories coming your way, Harry! Are you sure?”
“Grunvur, you’re back.” Draco nodded and motioned to Harry. “My ward would like to transfer a vault. We would like to invite the new owners to have a look inside and if they don’t want any of it, we’d like to have it cleared.”
RW knows I want a divorce, do you want to take this game a little further and be the person who doesn’t want it? Or should we just bathe in our deep hatred? Both scenarios would be fine with me. I’m having fun, so thank you. And sleep tight, love. If you have a nightmare, come and get me, I’d do anything for you.
Pansy shook her head and grabbed a new and improved vial of the nutrition potion, handing it over to Harry. “Who knew that Gryffindors were that deep?”
“Oh you mean, us running away from danger?” Harry offered and snorted. Hermione rolled her eyes at him and shoved him slightly.
“Hey!” Harry called out, but couldn't bite back his laughter, which was quickly followed by Draco's and Ron's and then everyone else's. Draco placed a tired out Caellum back into the crib and accio'd two more glasses.
“He wanted to protect his family. I tried to help as well, but I did kind of have my own problems. I’m really sorry you got taken in by this mess.” Severus poured some whiskey into the glasses and walked back to the table.
“I know. That’s why I said it. Back to bed!” Draco demanded and pointed at the door, where Harry’s room was.
Harry grinned. “Yes. Yes, I want to marry you. And we’re not doing it over, because that was pretty much perfect.”
In the huge Auror office, the sheer noice of people talking and discussing files made Harry wince. He bit his lips, angry about a reaction he should have under controll by now and shook his head. He tried to sneak towards his small cubicle, however, he was soon found by Ronald Weasley, sporting a rather huge black eye.
Harry snorted and rolled his eyes. “This is the second time you brought someone here that isn’t in our year!”
“Mate, you have a huge hickey on your neck. Like… really, cover it up, Harry!” His trained eyes seemed to almost try and investigate him, when Harry actually blushed and shrugged his shoulders. Neville sighed and continued: “You didn’t have that this morning, so we know for a fact, you were somewhere else.
He only stopped, once a shadow fell over him. Hermione stood there shaking her head as well. “What are
“What Eric wants to say” Alamar interrupted and fondly shook his head over how much Eric was saying, “you can stay with us. However, should you decide that we’re not a good match, there’s a rather good magical organisation for orphans in Russia, so...”
And so, the evening ended in Blaise reading the book in French, Theodore working on his charms and Pansy and Millicent doing a group project about endangered species of plants for Herbology. Draco leaned at the couch, watching his friends and his ward enjoy the evening. He knew he had to give Potter’s friends a little bit of time with him. Even though he didn’t like it, it was important to Granger and Weasley and for some reason he wanted to be nice to them.
“You think I don’t know what you did?!” he asked quietly and dangerously, before stealing a fork full of scrambled eggs from the pan. He grabbed an empty glass by the sink and threw it against the wall, next to where Harry had indicated the listening spell was activated.
Well, Draco was sure that Harry was going to find a way for some sort of freedom, but in general, nobody thought it was possible.
“Please remind me in the morning, that there’s something else I need to discuss with you. McGonagall's asked me to take over Hogwarts.”
“I think we should head to breakfast, Harry!” she advised and they walked down the stairs, laughing and grinning about what had just happened.
Theodore smirked. “I made an offer he couldn’t refuse. He’s not allowed to scare me again – on purpose – and I’m giving him the best and hopefully easiest tutoring he’s ever had.”
Harry snorted. When Draco met his gaze, he was turning even redder. “You are never satisfied, no matter what I do. For some reason, you’ve got endless sexual energy.”
“I do, thank you. I’m still trying to reach your height of popularity, though” Draco smirked and grabbed another serving of fish and chips. “Have you not eaten anything since the time you arrived here?”
Frowning, Draco looked at Millicent and shook his head. “I’ll give Pansy a Patronus to go to the Astronomy Tower, you go and see what happens at the edge of the Forbidden Forest, I’ll check the Room of Requirement.”
In the meantime, I wish you a good last few weeks as Hogwarts. Try to enjoy them – even with Transfigurations.
Meanwhile, it seemed as if the white haired wizard seemed to have gotten his confusion out of the way. He stepped forward and shook his head. “I’m sorry, but can someone tell me what’s going on?!”
“It’s nothing, really. It’ll go away in a few hours” Draco answered and hoped his emotionless pureblood mask was enough to fool his godfather. Well, he should have known that this man knew him better than his own parents knew him.
While he sat down, he suddenly remembered how he had been early far too much at Pansy’s and the door had suddenly opened to reveal a basically walking snowman. It had been Potter who for some weird reason thought it would be a good idea to walk there.
The Slytherin rolled his eyes. “Still. It wasn’t what should have been said. Even Pansy told me off for such a comment.”
Draco raised his eyebrows, but grinned. “I can do that, L... Neville. But I will continue calling Weasley that way, so if he complains to you about why I’m calling you by your first name... You’ll have to live with that.”
Shaking his head, Draco quickly disregarded his clothes, took a quick shower and was read to attack the world in less than fifteen minutes – even if most of that time was spent to take care of his bed head. Once he was out of his room, he heard laughter which he could match to each of his friends rather fast.
Thank you so much for your nice letter. It took me by surprise to hear from you so soon, however, I always enjoy getting mail, so don’t hesitate to write.
The Slytherin grinned and put a book mark into the journal, before he closed it. “It means that your curse is a kind of ‘origin’ curse. It has to find a way to connect to the curse almost a year ago and only then can it continue. If we break the connection to the origin, the curse will just go away, like a bad meal.”
Right now, he sat with Hermione – even though Neville had indeed confirmed that it was her idea to make this particular platonic love potion and she was also the one to give it to him – and Parvati. They were discussing some political changes, which Harry was entirely uninterested in. He assumed that as a Slytherin, you kind of had to be interested in politics, just to keep your family safe.
Draco burst out laughing, while the background noises dropped to almost nothing. Harry couldn’t help but smirk. “You’re deliciously…” the quick pause was a clear indicator to Harry that he wanted to say ‘evil’, though with the people listening on his end, he couldn’t really say that without making them suspicious. “… amazing. I love it.”
“Yes, another session with a couple’s therapist!” Dean said from the safety of a Protego at the very end of the room. It seemed as if he was scared Draco or Harry were going to throw a hex at him just for suggesting it.
By the end, both Pansy and Neville were in tears and Harry had also had quite some problem not making a noise.
When they passed the staircase, Draco waved at Harry and left through the door to the family tree, where he pushed the head of one of them. Harry leaned at the door frame and watched him cross the room and then turn around.
“Maybe you need some back-up” Neville offered. “Someone who can make them freak out even more. Or at least kill any doubt before it’s had a reason to be there.”
Harry grinned: That was what he loved most about his husband. He was up to anything if Harry just as much as asked for it. Nothing was going to stop him. “Alright, that’s the end up that conversation. Love you, try not to laugh like a maniac when you’re ending the call.”
“Morning Maria, I come bearing coffee.” He grinned as she looked up. “I did not tell the barista to make it as black as my skin, since you would have gotten pure milk without coffee by then. I don’t think that sentence works for me” he chuckled.
“Doubtful” Malfoy shrugged his shoulders. “Maybe the Ministry has records, but these two had to be extremely sneaky with their relationship, so I don’t believe that there’s any proof.” He sighed. “Let’s finish examining everything and maybe we can look at the records tomorrow.”
“Thank you for telling me Dray. I have feelings for you as well and I would like to see where it goes. As for that other thing…” Harry smirked, pretending as if it wasn’t such a big deal. “Just think about it that way: If we would have been together before I was turned into a baby, you would have taken care of me as well, right?”
The man with pointy ears ruffled through Alamar’s hair and the other man rolled his eyes, as if to show Harry that he hated it, though he didn’t even try to stop it. It was the first time for quite some time that Boy... Harry showed a smile. It was soft and sheepish, but it existed and he immediately felt safe with these two men.
Granger looked at them without saying anything for a few moments, then nodded. She motioned them to follow her and Weasley into an empty room, which was close to the Gryffindor Common Room entrance.
In the kitchen is coffee and breakfast. Feel free to look through the apartment – you won’t find my present for you if that’s what you’re looking for.
Harry laughed sheepishly. “He keeps asking me for help. Even though I know for a fact that he has more creature knowledge than I have. And a few weeks ago when it was really nice out, he told me to get out of the castle and we walked through the Forbidden Forest and enjoyed a picnic surrounded by animals, which he fed and...”
Did he know more than Granger? That was actually interesting that he could deal with children better than she could! Or maybe it was just today, he didn’t want to think that he was actually smarter than she was.
It seemed as if Weaslette hadn’t heard what he said, since she just continued talking. “You can’t just attack him. I know you don’t like Aurors and whatnot, but
Harry has finally turned thirteen – a while ago actually – and I’ve taught him the Patronus. It feels weird since I know you’ve been the one to teach him when he was younger. As a matter of fact that is also one of the reasons I’m writing you today.
He looked over at Harry who grew a lopsided smirk. “Welcome to the team then, Neville.” Harry chuckled.
Draco flushed, while Harry washed his face and hands. While they headed back to their spot, Pansy put her arm around Draco’s ward and pressed him against her. “Harry, maybe you’re eating too fast?”
Draco rolled his eyes and sat up. Harry stopped the massage and smiled at him. Draco returned the smile. “Give me at least a clue. Only one word.”
Harry hugged him back tightly and pulled him onto his laps falling to the floor now. “I love you!” Draco whispered between his tears.
Hermione frowned. “What do you mean? Wait, how did I not find this store, since you have the best books? And since when did you get into books, Harry?”
Right now, he turned his head to look over his shoulder towards Potter, who beamed at him and then at Draco. As soon as he realized that Draco could see him, he squealed again and Draco laughed triumphantly.
Seamus sniggered. “We still have the bingo sheets, Dean. Let’s just wait it out and then have some fun! We don’t have to stay that long.”
Mason looked at it and turned to Harry. “You are the best, Harry. Thank you so much for all you’ve done so far. It has been an incredible ride with your company.” All along, Jennifer was nodding vehemently and Harry chuckled.
Now, both Severus and Draco were floored by Harry’s analysis of the situation and he frowned, looking at them both before turning back to Draco. He was clearly expecting something. Draco felt the potion tugging inside him and he smiled.
Harry chuckled. “I have my ways.” He winked at her. “But don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. As long as you’ll stop secretly taking pictures of Draco and me.”
happens” Draco rolled his eyes, but smiled a second later. “Thank you, Remus. If Pansy or Theodore have a question about DADA, could I tell them to write you? I think it would help them prepare.”
His eyes focussed on the ceiling with the little light he was given by the cracked window and the moon. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest, as if it had transformed into a musical with a drummer solo. It was suddenly so hard to breathe, even though he really tried to take as many deep breaths as he could. His entire body was trembling and he pushed the blanket away.
“I’d rather not, Mr. Malfoy. It’s High Magic and could when used often damage a child’s brain” the mediwitch explained.
Eric chuckled softly and a ruffling of sheets made Alamar think that he likely sat down on Harry’s bed. “She’s a protector, you know. And I think all she wants to do right now is to make sure that you’re doing okay. Are you okay, Cowboy?”
“These questions aren’t easy!” Ron growled and stared daggers at the book he had been reading. Harry bit back a grin, mostly because Hermione would have been angry at him as well if she had seen that he didn’t really take it as serious as she did. Well, who did take it as serious as she did?!
Harry jumped up and walked over, hugging Ron. “You’re like my brother, Ron! I know it was hard and for what it’s worth, I forgive you, even though I don’t think you did anything wrong.”
The former Gryffindor let go of Draco, panted and started to laugh quietly. “Are you telling me to stop kissing you, when you continue? I am confused.”
“Well, Severus. It’s not getting boring around here.” He wanted to say something else, when Draco smirked.
“Peter? What’s going on?” He really hoped that this man hadn’t once again messed up everything. For some weird reason, he had a tendency for always doing the one thing that was uncalled for in almost every situation.
When they walked down the stairs, far too slow, Harry turned around, pushing Draco against the wall. “You’re the worst person on this entire planet, my love” he whispered between kisses and smiled against his lips. “I love you so much, you annoying tease.”
That hex shot across the room and ended up catching Ron who had jumped onto the couch. He squealed and landed on the floor again.
They were sitting in room 203 in the Ministry, waiting for the other people to arrive. The room was a little different. Everything – literally everything; walls, chairs, carpet – was velvet and dark red. Only the table had been carved out of light brown wood. Draco couldn’t really see what kind of wood, since his expertise lay in different areas, but he could still appreciate something nice.
When the three of them sat down and Dwarfbart sat on his chair as well, he looked at the child intrigued. “Is that Harry Potter?”
Draco smirked and shrugged his shoulders, leaning on the wall. “That’s not surprising. I don’t think you ever understood what was going on.”
It ended with a huge line as if the paper had been torn away from the writer. Harry frowned. There was something else going on in this house. It seemed to have absorbed the pain coming from this letter.
He didn’t even wait what his best friend had to say, simply climbed into his bed and turned off the light on his bedside table. A few seconds later, the light was fully turned off and he saw Ron heading out. Grabbing his phone, Harry decided to quickly shot a text to his husband.
