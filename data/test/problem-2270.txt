Ron looked slightly disappointed. “We could meet in Diagon Alley, I suppose,” he suggested, after a moment. “I’ve still got to buy something for Ginny.”
Thankfully, Harry is saved from explaining himself by Hermione, who rushes out of the kitchen with a letter in her hand, looking more distressed than Harry has seen her in quite some time.  'Harry, there you are,' she says, flustered.  'And Malfoy, you too.  We've just got letters.'
'Malfoy's mum might, actually,' Harry remembered, thinking of the cool pressure of her hands as she felt for his pulse. 'She was definitely willing to negotiate when it was Malfoy. But—isn't it—playing dirty?'
“Looks like the Seekers have spotted the Snitch,” Ackerley was booming, his voice mingling with the crowd’s screams to create a dull roar in Harry’s ears. “Harry Potter’s in the lead for Gryffindor—but Draco Malfoy’s fast on his heels—"
'Okay, okay. I'm just suggesting that perhaps you let McGonagall know next time, instead of taking charge.'
'I don't think you do!'  Neville is glowering at him in a way that Neville never would have challenged Harry Potter as a first-year.  They stare at each other, and Neville says sullenly, 'Why is he even here, anyway?'
Harry knew he was flushing, and when Madam Rosmerta set his Butterbeer on the table, he gave her a profoundly grateful look. Uncapping the bottle, he took several swigs of it before he was finally able to look at Tonks again.
“Great,” Tonks said, and, without preamble, added, “My rooms, eight o’ clock!” She swung one leg back over the bench and, tousling Ginny’s hair, set off back for the table of Professors, whistling some irreverent tune that probably had a lot of awful words to it. Harry thought Sirius would probably have known it.
'I'm coming, Potter.'  The corner of Malfoy's mouth twitches.  'It'd make the Veela too happy if I didn't.'
'No, I am doing this here, because I don't really fancy spending more time with you right now!' Ginny exclaimed. 'You want to have this argument? Fine, let's have it. I thought things would be different now, after the war, but they aren't, they haven't been for months!'
At the end of breakfast, just as he was following Ron and Hermione out into the hallway, Ginny dashed over and caught him by the arm.
Harry frowned, skipping several paragraphs, which told him more than he had ever wanted to know about interior decorating.
, lightly, as if nothing at all had just happened. She squeezed his knee again. “Sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to jump on you like that. I just figured—"
But Harry had thought, naively perhaps, that what had happened at Grimmauld Place had changed some things between them. Maybe he’d been wrong. Was this the issue they’d been dancing around all this time?
'I was sorry about that,' Narcissa murmured, glancing over her shoulder at Harry, who scowled right back. 'When he died. I told Bella, I told her—'
“You never know,” Ron insisted. “It’s a bit fishy, don’t you think, Harry? Shouldn’t Ravenclaws date
But up near the dais, Flitwick squeaked, 'Abercrombie, Melania!' and scarcely did the tiny girl clamber onto the stool before the Sorting Hat shouted, 'GRYFFINDOR!' All around Harry, the students erupted in cheers; Harry could see Euan Abercrombie several chairs away, pounding on the table and looking pleased.
“Harry,” Remus said, his voice firm, “you are doing what you can. What you’ve done with the DA is more than we ever hoped for. How you’ve proven yourself against Voldemort is more than anyone could ask. And Harry, people take strength from the very fact that you’re alive, don’t you know that?”
“Perhaps,” Snape hissed, his eyes glittering dangerously, “you do not belong in a NEWT level course, Potter.”
Harry's days were divided as they always were when Hermione and Ron were having a row; he ate meals with Ron and sat in the library with Hermione, flew with Ron and sat through Defense between the two of them. Ron's birthday had been the hardest, as he naturally felt Harry should spend the day with him, while Hermione insisted that everyone else would be celebrating Ron's birthday, and therefore, Harry should keep her company in the meantime. Each of them wanted his continual companionship, and he was actually relieved to catch a moment alone.
No. No, he shouldn’t wonder. Malfoy had just accused Ron of sleeping with his sister, after all, without a second thought. And this was the boy he wanted to—
." Ron had been in charge of eliminating stray pictures of Harry during the war. He had always secretly resented the job, but anyway, now he is dead. So is Harry. Harry forgets this sometimes.
It was certainly Tonks who was speaking, though none of them could make out any specific words. Finally, Ginny stepped up and rapped loudly on the door. The rest of them hung back, waiting.
Harry looked at him, at the shadows around his face and the way he was looking back at Harry, half-apprehensive, half-shocked, his lips slightly parted. “Yeah,” Harry said.
'We're Dumbledore's Army,' Ginny says from the back of the crowd.  Her voice rings over everyone, and they go quiet to listen.  She says again, 'We're still Dumbledore's Army.  Just for real this time.'
They both watched the little phosphorescent fish swim by the windows. Malfoy's expression was closed, the green lake light washing over his pointed features, making him look sicklier than usual. For a fleeting moment, Harry thought of what the Sorting Hat had said, and imagined what it might have been like, if this common room had been his, if he had spent the past seven years reading beside the white serpent candles, watching lunar fish swim by with Pansy Parkinson.
“Well, it’s a shame he didn’t succeed!” Draco snarled, such ferocity in his voice that Harry almost recoiled. “I hope next time it’s Granger! I hope my father has to use a thousand Scouring Charms to wash off all her dirty, disgusting blood! I hope Weasley has to watch her die!”
'I had my reasons!' Malfoy snarled. 'What was the alternative? It did save my family, barely but it did! You think I'm like you, Potter? Trying to save people, the people who're important to me?'
“Everybody’s scared of something,” Tonks said. “You should know that. Harry, I didn’t give away any Order secrets, I even bargained for Moody’s life, that’s why Bellatrix escaped. I thought I could—help—"
After a minute, Ron said, “Oh. Good luck.” He yanked the curtains shut around his bed, and Harry suspected that Ron was probably off to have a good wank. He wished, for a second, that his life was uncomplicated enough to do the same. Up til the day before, it had been, more or less. He could pull himself off to nameless witches Seamus had tacked up, and if his fantasies were mostly vague and quick, what of it?
Cho was waiting for him there, Cho who was older and thinner and a little bit quieter, but who still pinked up when he took her arm and smiled at him shyly from behind her coffee cup. Their table was covered in confetti, and Harry thought back to where they had sat three years ago, though to Harry it felt more like a decade.
“I’m sorry I snapped at you,” he said, after a few minutes. Draco didn’t say anything at first, but Harry knew he wasn’t asleep and had heard him.
Draco laughed again, but this time it was darker and huskier. He loomed over Harry, one hand caressing his naked abdomen. “Maybe I just need you to remind me how
Vesper was restless. She always was at these sort of events, just anxious to get it over with. Sitting still had never been her strong suit, nor had listening to speeches that rambled on for a long time.
She gaped at him. “How can you just stand there and-“ She shook her head, disbelieving. “How could you let this happen? How could you do this to me?”
The staccato beat of the music felt like a cocoon around him, or perhaps that was the mass of bodies pressing into him, running their hands over him, encouraging him to move as they were moving. Draco did, following the example of those around him. This was hardly like the dancing he had grown up with; it was much easier, no required set of steps, just flowing and moving by intuition, letting the music be the guide.
It had been a while, too, since he had used his commanding voice in bed, and he had nearly forgotten the way it made Draco’s pupils dilate. The blond quickly flipped himself so he was on his stomach, practically offering himself to Harry with the way he was arching his lithe, muscular back. Harry took a moment to admire it, as well as Draco’s sculpted arse, before he grabbed his wand and cast a cleansing charm, then started playing at Draco’s entrance with his fingers. They were both in a bit of a hurry, yes, but Draco still needed some preparation, and Harry knew just how he wanted to do it.
They compared gifts, and Harry told Draco about his time at the Burrow with the Weasleys. The family had grown considerably since their Hogwarts days, and now there were multiple grandchildren running around and filling the house with noise, Harry said.
Harry looked at him and blinked. “Draco,” he said, sighing. “I’m sorry. Yeah, um… could you give us a few minutes?”
“Yes. Of course I did. But I had no idea if you’d go for it. I thought it might be too strange for you, given our history.”
“An association with the Malfoy family might signify certain other alliances,” Draco explained irritably. “Fudge is paranoid, so he’s overzealous. You can see where it might lead.”
. He had his wand in hand and looked as if he'd hex the first person to take the smallest step in his direction.
'Of course I do,' Harry exclaimed. He pulled the sword from Hermione's bag, lent to him for this occasion, and handed it to Griphook. 'I always intended to give this to you.'
'They aren't, not to guard Azkaban, but they're still using them for things like this. More controlled situations, they're calling them. Oh, didn't I keep telling you, I've been writing all these letters—and I think it's happening quickly, the Ministry likes to wrap their dirty business up as fast as possible—'
'I didn't say you had to trust him,' says Harry, whose patience has worn thin after hanging on the wall for an hour listening to Malfoy alternate between complaining and insisting that if Harry had not taken his wand, he could have escaped already.  'Ron, I don't trust him.  But Dumbledore said he would keep Malfoy and his family safe, and Malfoy said he'd give us Snape, so—'
'I'm not doing a press conference,' Harry says, 'and I'm not entering into any kind of alliance with the Ministry.  I'm proposing to work with you for one thing.  Not
"You can't judge people by how powerful they are," Harry shot back, certain Hermione would have tomes full of statistics of her own to refute each of Draco's claims. "So what if they don't have magic? Even if that is true, which I doubt, so what? There's nothing less noble, less human about them! You can't treat them like they don't exist!"
'Would you rather Professor Weasley, Mr. Potter?' McGonagall asked dryly. 'I've given him this year's seventh years for counseling, and taken all of you off his hands. Technically, you're in your eighth year. It's a special case.'
Senselessly, Harry wondered if Pansy knew, and what she would say if he asked her. Then he thought about Pansy, sobbing in the Slytherin dungeons, in an empty dormitory, and he felt worse.
Harry put his wand to his temple and began to siphon away memories: the Astronomy Tower that night . . . his dreams of Voldemort ordering a petrified Malfoy to perform the Cruciatus Curse . . . Malfoy in the bathroom whispering, 'He'll kill my whole family' . . . Malfoy at the Manor turning away from Harry . . .
'Oh.' Harry cast desperately for something else to say, but the only thing he could think about was Cormac McLaggen at Keeper tryouts in his sixth year, and he didn't think Hermione would look favorably on his use of her rule-breaking as a conversation starter. 'Um, handy charms, aren't they? For, I mean, if you want to confuse someone. I used one when we broke into Gringotts.'
'Or should I say,' added Malfoy, his tone sharper, smirking now, 'what are you doing creeping about after hours? I am a Prefect, you know.'
Malfoy drew his shirt over his head and unconsciously started to fold it before Harry stepped forward and yanked it away. 'Leave it,' Harry muttered. Malfoy's skin was warm under his splayed hand, the ridges of his ribs and the heartbeat Harry found when his palm skidded upwards. There was scarring, too, and Harry ran his fingers over it.
'Well, I think it's kind of mean, Harry, to be honest,' Ginny said frankly. 'I think it's, it's rude, is what it is. I would never want anybody to do that with me and I think it's terrible that you would do that to anybody. I don't think that's the sort of person I want to be with, anyway.'
Into Malfoy’s neck, Harry said, ‘Malfoy, god,’ and a little muttered, helpless, because he’d been thinking about it since arriving in his drafty, dark house, ‘wanna fuck you.’
'I expect to see you at breakfast tomorrow,' Harry said. 'At the Slytherin table, like I have all six years I've been there. You can even fling porridge at me if you want.'
'What's going on?' Hermione said as she sat down in the seat Malfoy had just vacated. 'Are you all right?'
Harry is about to open his mouth to tell Malfoy off, but Hermione gets there first.  'I slapped you once,' she says, 'and I'd do it again, don't you think I wouldn't.  That's the problem with you.  Thinking you're better than other people, thinking that means you can order them around.  When I think about how your family treated Dobby—and all because most witches and wizards have been socialized to think they've got the right to keep house-elves enslaved, that house-elves don't want to be free, that house-elves aren't quite like
'Home,' Malfoy echoes drowsily, something in his voice.  It might be resentment, agreement, resignation.  Harry can't tell.
'Herm—' Ron starts, but she shushes him.  'I mean it,' Hermione says.  'Malfoy, they're already in place.  Do you know how much time and effort that would save us?'
'I couldn't,' Hermione repeated. 'Honestly, Harry. Malfoy knew some kind of spell, I've studied it a lot, trying to break it, but it's really good. I think it's related to
“They do have a staff room,” Hermione said, a bit too scathingly. “Honestly.” There were a few voices, and she frowned.
'And I suppose they'd know better than we would if you were yourself?' Hermione demands.  'We'll wait at least an hour, in case it's Polyjuice Potion.  Meanwhile, there's got to be a spell to figure out if someone is himself, hasn't there?  I'll look in the library while we're waiting—'
“Cho was a Ravenclaw,” Hermione said impatiently. “And as for Anthony, if you happen to be insinuating—"
Malfoy just looks at him.  After a moment, Harry turns back towards the doors.  'Listen, I'm going to Hagrid's for a bit.  You can come if you want.'
“Yeah, you should’ve,” Ron said frankly, sounding slightly put off. “But I talked to Hermione about it. And I reckon I would have gone a bit mad, hearing it with no warning.” He folded his arms. “I can’t say as I like you being friendly with Malfoy, but I can’t stop you.”
Far off, there was the burbling of a fountain, the sinking sun. Then the gate swung open and he was admitted.
They sat in silence for another few moments. And then, as simple as that, as if nothing had been said between Harry’s entrance into the room and now, Tonks flashed him a grin and said, “Gave me the shock of a lifetime to see you in that club.”
Which was better, really: he already remembered the press of Draco’s lips just before he fell asleep, and he still wanked over the way Draco sank to his knees and took Harry in his mouth. Sometimes he remembered the way Draco had looked, broken, on the dungeon floor. The curve of his smile. Sometimes he doubted himself.
Ron looked at him, his hands stuck in the pockets of his robes. In the dim light of the common room, Harry couldn’t make out the expression on Ron’s face. After a moment, Ron said carefully, “You were out with him, weren’t you?”
Malfoy eyed him and for a split second, Harry thought he wasn't going to say anything, and then he replied, 'Hey yourself, Potter,' before strutting off down the hall.
'A code?'  Malfoy looks intrigued at the possibility, but his surprised interest says everything; even if he were smart enough to think up a code for his letters, it hasn't crossed his mind until now.  'It's not a spy letter, Potter, all right?  I just needed to tell her something.'
It had been Seamus who had doubted him, the past year, and avoided him, but it had also been Seamus who had illegally bought Firewhiskey for the Gryffindor party after Harry's Quidditch victory in November, and Seamus who had pin-ups of half-naked girls all over his corner of the room, and Seamus who had a laugh so distinctive that, even in the midst of studying in a crowded common room, Harry usually looked up and cracked a grin . . .
'Oh, loads better,' Hagrid says.  'I've bin bringin' 'im clothes, he don't like some of them but he's improvin' every day—yeh saw 'im at Dumbledore's funeral, did yeh, all dressed up?'
'Good morning,' she said seriously. 'Breakfast will begin momentarily. But first, I have a few words to say. Will everyone please stand?'
'I was kind of,' Harry said halfway through, one hand going instinctively to flatten his hair. 'Immature, or. You know.'
“You admitting that it’s someone you don’t want to be is the answer. Your fears don’t have to become you, Draco. Fears are irrational and relying on them to give you an insight will only lead to those fears winning.”
“I don’t want to wait,” Draco blurted without thinking. “I wish I didn’t have to wait. That I could have puppy love, or my first heartbreak, or my first relationship. But Merlin knows I’m not ready. Emotionally or realistically. I’m 14 and scared of the future. It’s not the life I would’ve chosen for myself, but it’s the one I have.”
Draco wasn’t sure what to expect for his first Care of Magical Creature lesson, but what he got wasn’t it. Hagrid had never exactly had his confidence, but he was open to trying. Mostly.
Draco bit his lip as he tried to decide if letting Potter in was a good idea. He couldn’t tell anyone about Regulus, but he could still say
He wished it wasn’t so complicated. The more he got to know Regulus, the more he mourned the person he would never meet.
“I know what people think I am, and I know what some people expect me to be. But myself? I don’t know if I want to know.”
“I don’t know what to say,” Draco whispered. “I want to say it’ll get better, but false hope never did anything for anyone.”
Draco debated about whether to let it go, or to say something. When he could feel Dobby’s frown against his palm, he knew his answer.
“Thanks.” Greg looks pleased with himself. “I’ve always loved the Floos. Spent ages working on the network in Wales. It’s a shame you couldn’t visit. I sent owls.”
“Normally, I’d say it’s just how the world is, but that’s a terrible answer. I think part of it is that people are uneducated. They don’t realize that they were born with advantages and privileges that others don’t have. It’s not something that’s usually noticed until pointed out. Even if they aren’t cruel, they still benefit from those circumstances.”
Draco takes the remote and experimentally flicks through a couple of channels, excitement rushing through him. “I’ve never had a television before.”
In less than a minute, Draco is fast asleep, dreaming of kisses in dark corridors, green eyes and the way the sun never quite sets on Little Compton Street.
“I’m…” Harry’s sentence leaves him in a shudder and the damp heat of his climax spreads between them.
“You said you liked to make people wait,” Harry points out. If he’s aiming for innocent, he’s fucking terrible at it. He looks filthy, as if he wants to go to bed and have a long, thorough, shag. “I was being good.”
Whispers broke out as Umbridge placed her clipboard on her hip and eyed him closely. He knew that she expected a different answer. It was obvious she
have use, Potter. You always have. You were no doubt destined to be who you are. I was supposed to be a mindless heir for a cruel man. And I couldn’t even do that without having a complex.”
haven’t performed a lot of Dark Magic, it still left a residue, it still left pieces that my core has been around for so long.”
“I’m not telling you to not be suspicious,” Draco reassured. “I’m just telling you to keep an open mind. People might surprise you, that’s all.”
“I didn’t think.” Draco drops the wards, allowing Potter to stumble through. “I couldn’t imagine any reason for you to want to come to the Manor.”
Little Compton Street is humming with activity, and the stretch of boarded up bars have taken on a new lease of life, with their shiny windows and fresh paintwork. Not all have reopened as they were, and one of the shop frontages declares
“Did you know that Black was given a sentence without a trial?” Potter asked, not looking up as he jumped right into a conversation.
“Ginny.” Draco holds out his hand and Ginny gives him an odd look, so he pretends he was reaching for his drink. “How are you?”
“You were, and you weren’t.” Draco puts his coffee down and crosses his legs. “The whole battle doesn’t rest on your shoulders, this time. There are plenty of people who will support you. My name is unlikely to help anything, but I’m extremely rich, Potter.”
Draco felt his eye twitch in annoyance, but he said nothing and focused on the proper wand placement Neville was showing him.
“No. Of course not.” Draco rolls his eyes. “I’ve been spending the last few days talking to my owl. I’m bored out of my mind.”
“The hexes were easy, the intermediate jinxes only took a little bit of practice, and the shields were a breeze. So
“Well you did less damage than Lockhart,” Draco said, hoping to cheer Dobby up. “The man is an idiot.”
has been whirring through Draco’s head since the previous week, and Draco has so many questions it’s driving him insane. The finer details behind Potter’s coming out and the article in the
truth of it is that being gay wizards gives Draco and Harry a history and a purpose which, for the first time since Potter refused to shake Draco’s hand, is fully aligned.
“No.” Draco shrugs. “I don’t care,” he says, a little meanly. “I’m sure your countryside cottage is delightful. We can make jam.” Draco’s not sure quite why he’s being such a prick, but self-preservation has kicked in, and as the crawling, claustrophobic sensation prickling under his skin intensifies, he’s desperate to create a bit of distance between himself and Harry.
“Want to do everything with you.” Harry’s voice is gruff, his lips damp against Draco’s. “I’ve wanted this for such a long time.”
. It’s different to Draco’s other experiences which have largely involved sprinting towards climax with rough hands, the taste of a stranger on his tongue and the hard, heavy press of an unknown man’s fingers on his hips. This time there’s no doubt in Draco’s mind who’s kissing him. The taste of Harry’s magic and the familiar, soapy scent of him is overwhelming. Draco pulls Harry as close as he can, a dizzying, heady kiss with all the build-up of the last few weeks released with beautiful, brutal force.
, in this little bit of London that’s hidden away from the judgment of the masses. If he closes his eyes he can feel the heat of warm bodies pressed together and the restless vibrations of music beneath his feet. Draco wonders if Harry feels it too, this deference to the ghosts of the past.
“Ask you what?” Draco feigns innocence, largely unsuccessfully if Potter’s expression is anything to go by.
When Draco looked at his father, he thought he would see anger or perhaps his eyes would have shown a plea, a plea for him to do as the Dark Lord wished. But as Draco looked at his father, the only thing he saw was recognition.
“Are you into rimming?” Harry asks, ever so casually. His voice is still low and rough, and he squeezes his hand to emphasise the question.
That had Draco’s brows furrowing. “Potter has nothing to do with this.” The lie was minimal—but not worth thinking about. Potter wasn’t responsible for Draco’s thoughts.
A bitter smile stretched Neville’s lips and Draco entwined their arms in comfort. It was odd that Augusta could care about other people but ignore her own Grandson’s suffering.
,” Blaise said in a laugh that was full of disbelief. “I’d be awake all night if we were to really go there.”
Draco rubbed the back of his neck. No one had ever talked to him about his mistakes, it was vulnerable, and he didn’t like it.
“And who’s to say your father didn’t do the same?” Draco asked gently. “I can’t condemn him for being a bully, that would make me a hypocrite. Nor can I offer an opinion on whether he truly changed or not. Everyone’s path to change is different. What I did might not be the same thing your father did. It depends on the person and whether they truly mean it.”
The Howler multiplied into three and they all began smoking. In Draco’s panic, he threw them on the floor and sent a bombarda at them.
The silence that followed was quite nice and Draco had been about to doze off when three shouts jerked him into an upright position.
This song is from the Tom Robinson Band's 'Power in the Darkness' LP which contained multiple rock/punk anthems of despair and anger at the British political system. Glad to be Gay was originally written by Tom Robinson for 1976 London Pride. It was first released in 1978 and because of its controversial and political lyrics, BBC Radio One refused to play the song, a decision which was subverted when DJ John Peel, widely recognised for promoting alternative talent, played the song.
“When were you in New York?” Draco stares at Potter. He’s always wanted to go to New York, but it’s always felt like the kind of place to go to with someone else. Besides, he would have to visit Pansy if he went there and he’s been avoiding her for a while, for reasons he chooses not to examine too closely.
Draco frowned as he placed his chin in the palm of his hand. “Why? You said she had one bottle already, any past that and it reaches toxic levels for a house elf.”
Instead he smoothed down the front of his hot pink blazer and fussed with the silver chains and powder-blue neckerchief for the umpteenth time. Turning side-on, Harry took a moment to admire the way the snug trousers hugged his arse, before turning back again and admiring his form: the extra breadth provided by the shoulder pads, and the crisp, sleek lines across his chest to the vee where the jacket fronts met just above his navel. It really was quite dramatic. He picked another piece of fluff off the smooth black t-shirt under the blazer before winking at his reflection and deciding that he really didn't mind this
.” Potter lifts his eyebrows up and down as if his past with Draco involves something far happier than war, jealousy and a lot of regret.
Draco dropped his hand as he thought it through, mind already numb at the realization that he would have to choose a side sooner than he thought.
“Here we are.” Harry takes his keys from his pocket and he uses them to buzz them into a house in a private gated mews close to Bermondsey Street. When they reach the door to his flat after an uncomfortable moment on opposite ends of the lift, Harry puts his keys on a small table by the door and gives Draco a grin. “Home.”
“I know that.” Draco rolled his eyes as he stepped closer to Potter. “The circumstance is out of your hands, but that doesn’t mean what you do from here is no longer your decision.”
He glared when he thought of Regulus’ death. “What drives me mad is that no one knew. The Ministry still had him down as a missing person for years after his death. Until it was assumed that he had died sometime during the war. Everyone who knew he was a Death Eater believes he ran away, like a coward would. But really, he died fighting the Dark Lord’s beliefs. He died doing the right thing, and not a fucking soul knows about it.”
“I was hoping to get my cock sucked.” Draco folds his arms and glares at Harry. “You seemed otherwise occupied, so I thought I might as well entertain myself.”
.” Harry gives Draco another heart-stopping kiss. “If I wanted to tell them about Little Compton Street, what would you think?” He pauses, worrying his lip between his teeth, his expression so earnest. “If I wanted to tell them about us, maybe. That too.”
“I’ve left you stuff out if you want to borrow a change of clothes,” Potter says. His cheeks are pink from the shower and his hair is damp and rumpled. He’s mouth-watering. “Resize them if you like. It’s just pyjamas. Unless you want to go out for breakfast?”
“Time?” Draco asked as he, too, rolled on his side. “What’s going on in your head? What are you worried about?”
“I’m proud of who I am, proud of who my father was, even if he made mistakes—he loved me, I know he did. His actions shouldn’t be taken out on me, nor should I be held accountable. I just wish Snape could see that. If he wants to blame someone, then why can’t it be my father? Why should I be the conduit for his grudges?”
He looked to Dumbledore and was startled to find his eyes on Draco. There was an intensity there that he had never been on the receiving end of when it came to Dumbledore.
Harry says something that sounds vaguely grubby, but Draco is already half asleep before he finishes.
His mother liked to leave the country from time to time, but not his father. His father liked to reiterate the belief that any business associate that wouldn’t come to him, was one not worth it. The fact that they both were to leave proved that
“Yeah.” Harry kisses Draco back and it nearly turns into something, before Draco pulls away reluctantly. He slides his hands over Harry’s waist, down to his hips and up again. He doesn’t want to stop touching Harry. He wants to stretch out on a bed with him and really take his time, but it’s going to have to wait.
“He doesn’t need to know,” Draco said to Madam Pomfrey, eyes pleading as he tried not to fidget on the hospital wing bed.
“You are kind of matted though. I wonder if you’ll let me fix that.” He kept talking, hoping to soothe the dog as he kept his voice quiet and calm.
“I didn’t expect to see you here,” Draco said as he sat next to Potter on the log in their usual spot by the lake. “But with Dumbledore gone, I suppose your lessons have been put on hold.”
“You have been a loyal Death Eater,” the Dark Lord said during a moment of calm as he walked around Draco’s father with a ‘
The dog didn’t calm down, but that wasn’t a surprise, Draco didn’t hold faith in his calming abilities—that was Neville’s area of expertise.
“It’s not a one-time thing,” Neville whispered as he held onto Draco just as tight. “You are always welcome, Draco,
“As fascinating as all of this is,” Draco drawled as he straightened his robes. “I’ll leave them in your capable hands, Potter.”
Draco had had to put up heavy silencing charms when he moved in because of his nightmares. He renewed them regularly, which meant that Git could now make as much noise as he liked without any fear of disturbing the landlord.
“Is that so?” Severus looked to Draco and he tried to jerk his head towards the fireplace in a way that would suggest the Potter had gone through, but he was never good at reading Severus.
“Is it?” Potter pushes his glasses up his nose and gives Draco a sheepish smile. “Have you played this snake thing?”
“I didn’t mean to ruin your plans.” Harry doesn’t sound sorry at all, and at this minute Draco couldn’t give a fuck about The Ivy.
That stung, but Draco couldn’t ignore that his father had ensured he would make the team. As far as insults go, it was mild and easily ignored.
Potter looked at him, and he wished the awed look wasn’t there, it wasn’t fair that one look from Potter could turn his stomach to mush.
“It could have been worse. I’ve had a baby dragon, a rare breed of flesh-eating pygmy puff and a three-foot-long Hippogriff egg before,” Harry says. He sounds remarkably cheerful about it.
“My father is dead, Potter.” Draco has a drink of his coffee too quickly and the liquid burns his throat. “Unlike you I have little desire to resurrect ghosts. Based on past form however, I can’t imagine he would have been thrilled.”
Harry presses a kiss to Draco’s neck, his laugh muffled. After a moment’s quiet, his warm lips travel in a curve along Draco’s neck and over his jaw. “I’m not crying. And if I was, it wouldn’t be because I’m kissing you, you tit.”
“Alright,” Draco mumbled as he shrugged once and began to walk away. “But you can’t be disappointed if I’m right. I did warn you.”
Umbridge marched forward, the sound of her heels the only noise heard in the silence that stretched.”
As he left her office and walked down the hall, he went over all the recent changes. It wasn’t just the school that had changed, and soon enough, Draco would be able to show how much he had changed as well.
Harry grins at Draco and looks around to make sure no one is listening to their conversation. The pub is quieter than the Christopher Street Inn, and the only person remotely within in earshot is engrossed by a magical jukebox in the corner of the room.
Green light exploded outward as it lit up the clearing briefly. The colour had Draco nervous and he hoped his father wouldn’t kill the Muggles.
“Do you want to go out for breakfast?” Harry approaches the sofa so he’s back in Draco’s eyeline, which is somewhat inconvenient for Draco’s semi-erect cock. “There’s this place down the road that does brunch. It’s cool, full of lots of old gym stuff from a Muggle school.”
“Black could very well be the lead singer. Makes sense if you consider his singing abilities. What do you think, Draco? You’re his cousin.”
Harry seems relieved, even though Draco’s quite sure he’s been naked in a flash with other people who have come back to the flat. It doesn’t cause the same tug of jealousy as it might, because it makes Draco glad that they’re not just getting straight to the fucking in an attempt to ignore the need for a proper conversation at some stage. He doesn’t have any interest in being one of Harry Potter’s one-night stands.
“I apologise for that.” Draco has heard Potter sing in the shower too, and it isn’t pretty. “Is there any way to make him stop?”
“It’s been nearly thirty-six hours. I think that’s pretty good, considering there was a time we couldn’t do thirty-six minutes.” Harry hands Draco his clothes, which have been freshly washed and folded with cleaning charms. He must have done that when Draco was asleep. “Do you want to change?”
It was clear by many of the students’ faces that they weren’t taking it seriously. Some looked to Potter, while others just frowned. Were they reconsidering their belief of his words? Realizing that Potter’s stance coupled with the Sorting hat made more of a promising statement? Or were they wondering if it was separate? Was it a human thing to never notice what was right there? Or just stupidity?
,” Potter whispered, voice barely reaching Draco’s ears. “Voldemort killed him, and you know it.” Potter was shaking, and that alone had Draco wondering why people had a hard time believing him. It was clear that Potter was telling the truth, the proof was in his actions, words and even his gestures.
The café on the River Thames isn’t part of a chain that Draco recognises. It’s a one-off, arty sort of place with crisp white walls and huge floor to ceiling windows. He has to admit that the artwork in the clean, bright restaurant is striking, with splashes of colour and sharp angles. The vantage point is quite spectacular, with the tall windows offering views of the iconic Tower Bridge. Small speedboats bounce over the water and a heavy metal anchor and cable on the walkway outside give a nod to the nautical history of the area. With the cobbled streets and waterfront cafés, the whole area reminds Draco of portside villages abroad. It would be the perfect place for a glass of chilled rose and a lazy brunch, were it not for the dark clouds overhead and the oppressive weight of the air just before a thunderstorm.
A commotion drew their attention to Lupin standing in front of Potter as a white orb became the Boggart’s shape.
across the front, largely because he helped Potter make the damn thing. “I imagine I’ll be arrested by Aurors if it looks as though I’m trying to involve myself with the Ministry.”
Draco’s mouth parted in surprise; something he wasn’t proud of. As whispers and angry cries broke out across the great hall, he only had eyes for Potter.
Draco looked out the window as the sound of a wand leaving its sheath could be heard. The silence of the room was just as silent as his mother and he wondered if that meant something.
“Back then I hated anyone and anything that was Dark. I fought so hard to prove myself to the people around me. I wanted to distance myself from my family, and I left my brother behind because he didn’t want the same things. If he wasn’t going to fight with me, then I was going to fight without him.”
“Please tell me how attacking Potter with a bludger was saving him?” Draco asked as he hid inside a passageway Dobby found. He wasn’t sure, but it looked like it went on for a while—the path could go out into the courtyard or even end up past the whomping willow.
Millicent narrows her eyes. “I know you’re not the sort to spend the night talking about boobs and fanny as you’ve never been particularly fond of either, so I’ll keep this short.” She runs a hand over her shirt. “Sometimes people like me want a bit of binding. I do those. Magical binders.” She drums her fingers on the table. “Shirts and stuff for people who are a bit larger and can’t get them to fit right. I do a bit of bespoke tailoring for those that want it. Grubbly-Plank said she’s putting in an order.”
With very slow, deliberate movements, Draco took his wand out of his winter coat and whispered a warming charm, pulling his magic back as much as possible. The bird was so small that he didn’t want to overheat it or cause burns.
“Dumbledore approved of this lesson, regardless of whatever you feel. This lesson is needed for your survival.”
“It would appear that you know how to run,” Draco whispered lowly, aware that Weasley was edging closer to them.
’s photographers are camped outside Godric’s Hollow and Grimmauld Place, just waiting for a picture of me looking like I’m losing my marbles. Nobody knows where my flat is, because nobody would think I have any interest living somewhere Muggle.”
Draco pulls a face even though there’s nothing remotely disgusting about Potter. If there was, Draco wouldn’t be in this mess in the first place.
“I know.” Harry takes a gulp of breath and pushes a hand through his hair. He has a wild-eyed look about him and his face contorts into a grimace. “
When Moody’s eye widened, Draco almost wanted to stop talking, but now that it had begun, he couldn’t stop.
He sat down next to Neville before looking to the girl. She was rather curious. Her long hair was free to her waist, wand tangled in her hair as he assumed she tried to place it behind her ear, a necklace made of butterbeer caps and she was reading a magazine upside down.
Lupin stood up straighter, indignation taking root. “Mister Malfoy, if you are trying to threaten me—”
He had a hunch that Lovegood and Neville would make great friends. All he had to do was convince Neville first.
and Draco knows what the public think of the fact the Malfoys retained a significant portion of their wealth after the war. He doesn’t want to pull at that thread when he and Potter seem to have reached a tentative truce of sorts. Draco can’t help the niggling feeling that any attempt to explain the impact the post-war years had on the Malfoy family would amount to defending the indefensible.
Draco sat on the log he liked to think was his as he stared at the Black Lake. It was difficult to find time to do nothing, what with the increased homework load and the extra care he had to put into studying. If Umbridge was a competent teacher, he wouldn’t have to study as hard.
“Yeah.” Harry doesn’t sound convincing in the slightest and everything is just a little bit warmer and more hopeful than before. “Obviously.”
She looked at him expectantly when he said nothing. Her smile dimmed, and she began to rifle through her drawers.
“Thank you?” Neville looked to Draco, with his face full of questions and his hands moving in uncertainty.
McGonagall gives him a sharp look. “Come, now, Mr Potter. I don’t keep my private life a secret because I’m ashamed of it. Wil has been to countless balls and events with me, I just doubt you ever paid much mind. My private affairs are such because I’m a private person. You would know little more of my business if I had the misfortune to find myself married to a man.”
“Potter… he’s something I never planned for. My life has been crumbling for a while, and then Potter came in with his subtle jabs and our lakeside conversations as if he belonged there. I’ve never known what I wanted when it came to him, never really thought about it until it was right in my face.”
“No, the article just gave me the push I needed.” Harry pulls a face. “Kingsley was supportive and as for some of the others, I just thought they were making stupid jokes. I didn’t realise the Aurors had a history involving arresting gay men for no reason at all. Some of them are old enough to have been working for the Ministry in the sixties.”
“These are on the house,” he says. He follows it up with a bright smile, all white teeth and flirtatious promise.
“If that leaves this room, I will murder you Potter and blame it on the monster that resides in the Chamber!”
Harry is passionate and forceful in everything he does. Draco slides his hand over Harry’s cock wondering how that might translate in the bedroom, moving his head back on the sofa and allowing himself to luxuriate in the thought of it. He rubs his thumb over the head of Harry’s cock and adds a twist on the upstroke, digging the fingers of his free hand into Potter’s bare thigh. Harry is so responsive. He can’t just be still in Draco’s lap. He shifts and squirms, his breathing heavy as he mouths over Draco’s jawline with little finesse. His lips find a particularly sensitive part of Draco’s neck and he sucks on it, his stubble scratchy against Draco’s skin.
“You mean to tell me that he hasn’t fully prepared you for any sort of Occlumency before he immediately breaks open your mind with Legilimency?”
Black raised a hand and moved tentatively towards the letters on the table. “Do you mind if I read these.”
Draco lifted his head up from where he had previously placed it in his free hand. He groaned internally at the sight of the bloody golden trio.
that you know that messing with the mind is dangerous. But performing Legilimency on someone who doesn’t even know the basics of Occlumency?”
“Yes,” Draco says. A wave of unexpected emotion crashes over him and he clutches onto his glass. “I hate him.” Draco can’t look at Harry. “I hate him for the things he taught me to believe in. I hate that he let my mother die because he was too arrogant to believe Muggles could have a cure. I have to hate him because he’s everything I despise, and everything I don’t want to be anymore.”
Draco had received a simple note from his father telling him to offer any aid he could to Umbridge—fat chance of that.
want his opinion, they had only been looking for a reason to go against him. It was smart on their end, but Draco hadn’t chosen a wand yesterday—they’d have to try harder than that to get to him.
“Regulus believed in things he never got a chance to show, and I hate it. I hate that no one saw the good in him, no one thought he could have redemption if given the chance. Regulus was someone who was self-aware enough to know that he had made mistakes, but those mistakes didn’t define him. Regulus was a good person, and I want the world to know that, I
“What exactly does make you hot and bothered?” Harry asks again, clearly trying to keep his tone conversational. “Just out of interest.”
Draco grinned when a small Capuchin monkey floated near his knees. He looked up and his grin grew wider when he realized it was Neville’s Patronus. He had never been as proud of another person as he was in that moment.
This pub is named after the American gay lib and transgender activists Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Marsha P. Johnson was at the forefront of the 1969 Stonewall Riots, a founder of the Gay Liberation Front and with Sylvia Rivera co-founded the STAR, a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens and trans women of colour. The importance of trans women of colour like Marsha P. Johnson and the impact they suffered as a result of the AIDS crisis can have a tendency to be erased from accounts of the gay lib movement. In a speech at Christopher Street Liberation Rally (1973) Rivera said:
“Thank you. I—I don’t think I can accept it just yet—” He bit his lip as he realized that he might just one day need to accept the offer. While he didn’t think his father would harm him, much, it could get worse over time—especially when his path was made clear.
There was still so much to Regulus that Draco didn’t know, and he wanted to get to know him, wanted to get to know the only person who could relate to Draco so well.
"Alright," Harry called back. He spared his reflection one final look before heading up to their bedroom.
A frustrated huff left Draco’s mouth at the accusation. It wasn’t as if it was an outlandish question. Not with the way things were handled with Hagrid.
“Easier said than done,” said Potter almost wistfully. “I hear what you are saying, and I appreciate it, but I don’t know how to use any of it.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “The memory, you dolt. Whatever memory you are using to fuel the spell isn’t good enough.”
“Just that he’s been happier of late. Said the war had started to catch up with him and they were worried he was going to do something stupid.”
“Clothes?” Draco tries to keep the surprise out of his voice. He remembers Millicent being plainly dressed and stocky, he can’t imagine her showing collections at Diagon Alley Fashion Week. “Seriously?”
“You’re welcome.” Draco studies his nearly empty bottle, before draining the last of his lager. “More booze?”
, that are expected to attract large crowds to Little Compton Street that afternoon. For the first time, the sky is charmed with the warmth of the sun on a hot summer’s day, and the magical rays cast their light around the courtyard, making the highly polished windows and the spruced-up bar frontages glisten and shine.
“I never asked for a pet again,” Draco concluded. “Horrible walk down memory lane. Depressing, actually, but it seemed to fit the mood.”
much easier for the Dark Lord. You are cracking him open and leaving him vulnerable. Unless… that’s what you want.”
Draco smiled slightly as they began to bicker. Gryffindors might not be good for anything, but at least they were entertaining.
The front cover was an older photo of Potter taken during the Triwizard Tournament, and he wondered if that was a strategic move to remind the viewers of Potter’s age during the incident.
“Probably not.” Potter doesn’t look like he’s going anywhere. Instead, he beckons the waiter over and orders another full English. “I’ll have tea with that, please.”
The sound the door made as it closed echoed around the room, but Draco couldn't take his eyes off of Regulus.
“Hey, I remember that!” Potter said, his voice held triumph to it. “We tried to open it—oh Merlin, we tried to open a Horcrux.”
. The trace of old magic is particularly strong here, just as it was by the boarded-up bars of the earlier stretches of Little Compton Street. The whole place is full of echoes, like the faint pulse of music somewhere just out of reach.
“Oh good, I’ve been looking for some paper to burn.” Draco leans back in the circle of Harry’s arms, which have increasingly started to feel like home. “How many people?”
“Potter managed to charm you. Not that that is surprising. He seems the type to be able to charm a Bowtruckle off a tree too. Merlin, that must make you easily susceptible. Although if that’s the case, what does that say about me?”
Draco arched a brow in disbelief. “Tell that to your past self. I distinctly remember some of your schemes that were far from wise.”
Paul’s grin fades and he squeezes his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Come on, now. You’ve done a lot already. There’s plenty more that would have died if it hadn’t been for you. You-Know-Who would have found Little Compton Street in the end and I can’t imagine it would have been pretty if he had.”
“No more than you, I bet.” Harry grins at Draco and pushes a hand through his hair. “I want to try it again with you, though. Let’s do it.”
“I can’t imagine that working for one minute.” Draco really can’t. There’s a powerful honesty in everything Harry does. An openness that Draco can’t understand, being as Slytherin as he is. Even now with Harry so schooled in the art of answering questions without really giving anything of himself away, he’s still fundamentally, irrepressibly, Harry. His emotions show all over his face, his fire and fight present in every pulse and twist of his magic. Over the last few weeks his demeanour has changed and now there’s a weightlessness that seems to have been brought about by the ability to speak his truth, in a street full of strangers with its rainbows billowing in the breeze.
As he entered the library, he caught sight of Potter poring over many different books. Draco bit his lip, unsure if his presence would be welcome.
As far as first kisses went, Draco had nothing to compare it to, but when Potter’s lips touched his own, he might have gasped, or maybe it was a sigh—possibly all in his head.
Oh, he had, he just ignored it. Most of his housemates from 5th year and up had joined her group. They paraded around the common room drunk on borrowed power.
Draco blinked rapidly, unsure if it was an instance where Severus actually wanted a reply or if he was just seeking someone to listen to him.
“Another time.” Potter puts some money on the table and stands, putting his bag over his shoulder. “Bye, Malfoy.”
“I don’t have trouble with that.” Harry sounds slightly croaky. “I don’t have trouble with that at all.” He leans in towards Draco, his voice low. “Let’s say—hypothetically—that you were with someone who liked the sound of that but hadn’t had that sort of experience before. How would you, um, want it?”
The lack of knowledge caused Draco to sigh in annoyance. Why was there no class for students who grew up in muggle homes? Vital information was passed up that could have been useful before now.
“Some of your scores have you as the highest in the class, as it should be, but others have you coming in second to the mudblood.”
“I’m versatile, if that was your question.” Draco makes it sound casual, as if he’s not sitting unthinkably close to Potter, talking about sexual preferences.
When no growling commenced, Draco unmatted the knots of fur with magic and placed cleaning charms on the dog as well.
“Are you alright?” Potter rushed down the stairs faster than Draco expected, and before he could register that, Potter pulled him away from Dobby and led him to a room that resembled a study. His mind went back to the one he had just left, and he couldn’t help but flinch.
For the most part, it was clear that the students didn’t want to say anything bad about Hagrid. He listened in amusement as Brown explained how eccentric the Blast-Ended skrewts were, and how they made her glad to partake in the course. He wasn’t entirely sure he would have been able to lie as well as her if that had been him.
“You don’t know what was going on. It might have been a ménage à trois. Perhaps Lupin joined in on Sundays.” Draco snickers at the thought. It’s always the quiet ones.
“Absolutely,” Potter agreed easily. “Neville gives the best hugs.” It was accompanied with a wink and it had Draco rolling his eyes.
“What about phone sex?” Harry’s definitely up to something. Draco can tell from the way his voice has that hum to it. “Ever tried that?”
He wanted to tell Potter that he was perfectly fine, wanted to snark him, wanted to tease back, but he didn’t have the energy. His knee made contact with the rough feel of wood and it was enough for Draco to reach forward and hold onto it as he sat down gingerly.
Draco shook his head in confusion. “What are you—” His breath caught as Sirius pulled off the wrapping paper.
Draco couldn’t shake the whisperers, they followed him everywhere. Speculations that were outlandish, and the decrees that Umbridge kept tacking to the walls.
“Kreacher,” Draco spoke up softly as he stood up and made his way over. It took some effort to kneel, his body still ached.
“Don’t be rude about Terry.” Harry grins at Draco. “It’s from Hagrid. A birthday gift. Don’t worry, it’s harmless now. I’ve had it neutered.”
have anything to be ashamed of when it comes to my choice of partner.” Draco takes a breath, tightening his grip on Harry’s arm and hoping this doesn’t end with either of them getting Splinched. “It’s serious for me too.” He takes a breath, his voice lowering because the Muggles are giving them odd looks. “It’s serious for me too,” he repeats.
When Potter argued back, tone angry but the underlying pleading to be believed, Draco wished that he wouldn’t. He knew Potter was right, knew that the truth was there, but Umbridge wasn’t the papers. She wasn’t the
When Draco walked forward, he could see that Longbottom was watching him, but not with pity—only concern.
A wave of emotion crashes over Draco and he closes his eyes. “Thank you,” he says. “Your opinion matters to me.” There’s not a hint of irony, sarcasm or teasing in his tone. It’s the truth.
Draco walked down the stairs that lead to the Great Hall nervously. Many people had asked him who he was going with, but he hadn’t wanted to say. Not with any chance it might make it to his father earlier than expected.
“This is my place, Potter,” Draco hisses. He leans forward in his seat so as not to create a scene. “There’s a terrible pub down the street. I think the Muggles call it a
Draco’s head snapped up, eyebrows arched. The triumphant gleam to his father’s eyes was ignored as his mind began to race.
Draco does groan now, very glad he’s no longer in Covent Garden or anywhere other people might hear.
Paul snorts. “Because the Ministry liked to pretend he didn’t exist, even though they knew damn well he did. He sent hundreds of Howlers to them and the
“All work and no play, Malfoy.” Potter has the cheek to shake his head as if Draco is somehow lacking in the fun department. “Did you put your number in here?”
“We’ll have to draw Umbridge away from her office, but we’ll need lookouts.” She pointed towards Neville and Luna. “That’s where they will come in handy.”
“Deviants and Perverts Yule Ball.” Draco turns the leaflet in his hands with a smile. “How…festive.”
“Enemy?” Draco asked as his brows arched. “Krum is the enemy? Enemy of what? He’s got a unibrow and off centered feet—I’ve seen kneazles with meaner dispositions.”
Draco takes a moment to consider Potter’s appearance, with a quick glance over the top of his coffee cup. He’s taller than he was, but still just a little shorter than Draco, with a wiry athleticism. His hair is the same thick, messy shock of black it’s always been. His features are neither chiselled or sharp but there’s a definition to the slight curve of his cheekbones and the firm lines of his jaw that is instantly pleasing to Draco. Even the eyes—sinfully hidden behind Potter’s terrible black-rimmed glasses—are a pleasing shade of green, one of Potter’s most distinctive hallmarks together with the scar which is currently hidden beneath a swoop of hair. In truth though, it’s not so much the architecture of Potter’s face that holds the most appeal. It’s the way he wears his emotions on the surface of it, from the sunny smile and teasing, almost flirtatious look of amusement to the way his expression can alter as quickly as the sky just before rain. Potter has aged, of course, and in those cloudy moments he loses the restless boyishness that reminds Draco of the Potter of old, laughing with Weasley and Granger or whooping with delight on the Quidditch pitch.
“Do I have to do this myself?” Draco keeps his hand moving, not at all close to coming but making sure he’s fully hard before Harry pushes his hand away.
'In the past,' Ron said swiftly, as if hoping to avoid an age-old argument of Hermione's. 'I came back, didn't I?'
Malfoy didn't say anything, but he didn't resist either, when Harry drew his chin closer and brought their mouths together. After a second or so, Malfoy's mouth opened under his. Early morning light was streaming through the curtains, and it was not at all rough like Harry expected; Malfoy kissed hesitantly, warm and slow. It was both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time: Ginny had always tasted faintly of the peppermint lip gloss she used, to the point where even Peppermint Humbugs reminded Harry of her, but Malfoy only tasted like spit and sleep. His tongue was swiping at the underside of Harry's, persistent little strokes that were making Harry's whole body wake up, and it felt a bit like someone had just taken off a Disillusionment Charm, warm shivers running straight down his spine. Malfoy seemed to think so too, because he made a contented sound against Harry's mouth; his hand crept up and traced over the shell of Harry's ear, fingers tugging gently at his hair . . .
“Voldemort does,” Harry said, rather casually, and stood up. “Here.” Malfoy’s wand clattered to the floor, and he grabbed for it, scowling. “It was a challenge because I wanted you to fight back. Now will you let me help you with Defense?”
'Little Teddy's father saved my son's life,' Mrs. Malfoy continued. 'Like it or not, Teddy and Draco are the last remaining Blacks of our line. They are the future of this family.'
“I suppose so,” Harry replied vacantly, preoccupied with a different train of thought. All that she’d said about Slytherin had got him thinking. “Hey, Hermione. Would you, er, would you know a Dark artifact if you saw one?”
“Oliver Wood?” Harry repeated, feeling a little ill. Oliver Wood was out there telling people about how Harry Potter had nearly died because he fell off his broom? The thought made him slightly queasy. “I suppose everybody’s laughing at me, then—how Harry Potter fell off his broom.”
“But that’s awful,” she exclaimed. “Now we know they’re going to strike, but we haven’t a clue where. Did you leave anything out, Harry? Bellatrix didn’t say anything else?”
'Well,' Harry said, then took a deep breath. Wasn't Hermione always telling him he was too stubborn by far? 'I'm sorry too. For, for not being nice.'
,' she said pointedly in Harry's direction, and sparing a glare for Ron, she stomped off into the castle.
He slipped it into his pocket, just as Snape strode by looking particularly dour. “Not paying attention as usual, I see,” Snape sneered down at him. “You wouldn’t happen to know the next step in this draught, would you, Mr. Potter?”
“What reason would Malfoy have to help you with Potions?” Ron burst in. “He hates you, Harry! But if somebody told him to get close to you, then he would, right? I mean, you put his dad in Azkaban, why would he want to study Potions with you?”
'Hermione doesn't care about any of that,' Harry insisted. 'She's known you forever. Also, you're taller.'
“Go see what’s wrong now,” Remus sighed, and Harry moved to the doorway to look. Draco was standing in front of the portrait, arms folded, and he was almost smiling. Harry moved closer.
They followed her out of the hubbub of the Great Hall and through the doors; once they were shut, it was silent, shadows stretching across the stone. Harry thought he could hear the wind whistling outside the heavy castle doors.
“I’m not the only one!” Harry retorted, aware that across the room, Malfoy was sniggering at the news that he’d needed Dumbledore’s help just to get in the class. “You just said it yourself, we’re all incompetent failures.”
'Well, if he isn't careful, he will,' Hermione snapped. 'Anyway, do you want to study for our Charms exam? I had Flitwick replicate several copies of previous year's exams for me to practice on.'
Harry swallowed. He would talk to Malfoy. That’s what he would do. And Malfoy would say something horrible about Sirius and fleas and lost pets and Harry would punch him and that would be the end of it. Once he saw how rotten Malfoy was, it wouldn’t matter. He’d send Tonks an owl in the morning. And he’d find Malfoy and everything would settle itself.
'That was different,' Harry said hastily. 'I don't—I thought he was up to something, and I was right, I never cared about his breakfast, okay?'
Harry was meeting Draco that evening in the Room of Requirement, though he waited until the end of their lesson before even broaching the topic. “You, er, haven’t been in Potions lately,” he muttered, just as Draco tucked away his wand.
'Really?' Malfoy said, a little breathlessly, and then he did move, and Harry made a whimpering noise he wasn't aware he could. There was a split-second moment in which Harry couldn't tell if Malfoy were pressed up against him on purpose or on accident, Malfoy's face turned away from him—a crinkle of paper and then Harry shifted, barely conscious of what he was doing, so that their bodies collided, Malfoy's thigh flush up against Harry's, and Malfoy was hard, he was sucking in a sharp hiss of a breath—
Draco’s breath hissed out when Harry worked one finger inside him, and Harry had trouble breathing himself when Draco clenched around him, slick and hot. Draco’s prick was glistening with precome as he fisted it lazily, and his breath sounded shaky and uneven as Harry slid his finger in and out of him, one, then two.
“You can call me whatever you want,” Harry assured him, and then saw the smirk unfurling on Malfoy’s face and amended, “Within reason, that is. If I say it’s okay.”
“Bet she loves that, getting it from her brothers and her father. I shouldn’t think your fat old mother keeps him happy anymore—"
'And I'm the Head of Gryffindor House,' Charlie added; this time Ron actually punched his fist in the air. 'Can't have anybody else stealing our Quidditch glory, now can I?'
'Well, a good education is nothing to sneer at,' Hermione said, ignoring the look Ron gave her. 'Harry, what about you?'
here?' She pointed an accusing finger at Harry, and he was reminded of her similar gesture in the Great Hall at the beginning of the Battle of Hogwarts. 'Draco,' Pansy said, 'Draco, Draco, you know I can't go back there. It's bad enough with my brother, don't you see? How can you stand it there? Why are you wasting your time when you could be—'
“Fuck you, Potter,” Malfoy hissed out. He was wide-eyed, backed up as far against the wall as he could go, and his eyes kept flickering down to Harry’s wand and back up to his face.
“On Bellatrix,” Harry qualified, feeling ill at the way Ron looked at him. But he couldn’t stop now. “Last year at the Department of Mysteries. It didn’t last very long. But I’ve practiced a couple times since the Hogsmeade attack.”
Compared to Harry, Draco’s tone turned abruptly level and cold. It was a shock, after they’d been screaming, and yet it sounded loud in the suddenly silent hallway. He said, somehow furiously calm, “I wouldn’t exist to him, Potter. He wouldn’t be my father any longer.”
'I'm not stopping you from playing professional Quidditch!' exclaimed Harry, who thought Ginny would make a brilliant Quidditch player. He remembered talking to her once about Gwenog Jones and the Harpies. 'I—how could you think I would—'
'Like we were,' Charlie put in, patting Hagrid's solid shoulder. Across the room, the tea kettle began to whistle, and Hagrid lumbered to his feet to pull it off the fire. With a wink while Hagrid's back was turned, Charlie slipped half his stoat sandwich under the table, and shortly Harry heard the unmistakable slobbering noises that meant Fang was gobbling it up.
Harry ignores him and sidles out of his portrait. When you're dead and one-dimensional, Harry has found, it is easier to walk away from things. Even if you're walking sideways.
'There is no need to thank me,' Dumbledore says, his tone even.  'There is one more thing.  My pensieve is protected from unwanted viewers.  I've left it to you, of course, but one can never tell whose hands a thing like that will fall into.'
Harry didn’t tell anyone about the Fidelius Charm, but he felt, in the days after, that everyone could tell: it felt strange, walking around with something inside him that no one, not even Dumbledore, knew. It was somehow warming, and somehow terrifying, that he was carrying something so key to two people’s lives, which he could let slip at any time. But to have it, like it was locked up inside him, maybe that was a bit like forgiveness, in its own way.
Reluctantly, Harry pocketed his wand and put his hand to his nose, finally realizing how awful his face must look. He tried to take his time leaving, curious despite himself to hear what Snape might have to say, but Snape only gave him a sharp look and pulled Draco into the classroom. Harry heard what might have been, “You should know . . . your father in . . .” but just then, the door slammed shut, and Harry was left alone in the empty hallway.
Still, he was preoccupied with whom the man could be when he stepped out of The Three Broomsticks into the bright November cold, and he was caught entirely off guard when Malfoy seized him by the elbow and dragged him around the side of the building.
'Spells,' Malfoy said vaguely. 'What do you want, Potter? What are you doing, popping up everywhere?'
'She's eleven years old!' Hermione hisses in his ear, sounding scandalized.  'She hasn't even started at Beauxbatons yet!'
'Shut your mouth about Ginny,' Harry snapped, then glanced over his shoulder at Madam Pince, who was scowling a warning at him. He lowered his voice. 'I mean it, I'm sick of you insulting the Weasleys!'
'All the better that you didn't, then,' Harry snapped, pulling him back to the present. 'Honestly, Malfoy.'
For her part, Hermione sniffed, apparently fed up with both of them, and settled back in her chair with
'I'll talk about her however I like,' Malfoy spat back. 'Pity my aunt never finished her off when she had the chance. We had to clean the carpet, you know, can't be having her filthy blood under our feet—'
“Wait until I’m on my deathbed, Potter, and then you’ll be sorry,” Draco said, still looking put off, but he sat down anyway. Weak sunlight filtered into the room and washed over them, making Draco look even paler as he sat there, carefully picking out his pieces. His forehead was creased in concentration, and Harry watched him, watched his nimble fingers and the way he frowned and the shift of the shadows around his neck as his shirt collar peeked open. And for a moment, nothing else, none of it, mattered.
Harry wasn't sure what to do with his. He had a feeling that he had some negotiating to do with the Gringotts' goblins before he could return to his vault.
‘I want you to be happy, Harry. I just don’t want you to be pining for this grand romance you think you could have had, when it never would have—’
'Now see here, I haven't got the time to hang around all night,' the Fat Lady harrumphed before Hermione could start in again. 'Honestly, you students! Are you coming in or staying out?'
The shop turned out to be the Magical Menagerie, and Ron nearly knocked over a large tabby cat as he stumbled inside. The cat yowled in agitation and Ron looked at it with great annoyance, then gave Harry the same look. “It’s not funny,” he said indignantly, but this only made Harry snort and turn towards the offended cat to hide his knowing smile.
Malfoy, as it turns out, is sitting alone by the front of the house, his robes unbuttoned, the sleeves of his shirt rolled up.  His head is tipping sleepily back against the side of the Burrow.  An industrious chicken is strutting nearby, occasionally squawking in Malfoy's direction.
'Well, there you go,' Ron said. 'Sorry, Harry, but you weren't with her, were you? You weren't treating her very nicely, and you haven't even been spending all that much time with her.'
. For nearly a year he had run on adrenaline and desperation, on and on through the forests, hunting for Horcruxes and hunted himself, and now, when he had only to sleep and wake up in the morning, eat breakfasts and cheer on the Cannons, the task seemed, at times, insurmountable. If Kingsley had only asked him to help track down the last Death Eaters . . . or perhaps to round up the Dementors still lingering in particularly dismal corners of London . . .
He looked down at the card sitting next to his plate. 'Dumbledore once said we had to keep fighting,' Harry remembered. 'That it could never be quite eradicated, but if we kept on, perhaps it could be kept at bay.'
Pansy interrupted by throwing her arms around Malfoy, who made a small noise of surprise. 'Drunk or not,' she said, 'Draco, I think you look like shit.'
“I can’t, I’ve—Potions,” he hastily explained, pushing Tonks away, “Potions essay, going to be late—good luck in Wales—if you’re even going to Wales—"
Malfoy stared at him for what seemed longer than necessary, but whatever it was, he shook it off. 'I like Penelope,' he said at last. 'She was kind to me when no one else was. But I don't have
Harry said desperately, “But Remus knows, he met him over the holidays, he showed him pictures of Sirius and my dad. Remus—"
Hermione frowned. 'You're only seventeen, Harry. I know it was hard to think about life after the war, but that doesn't mean that everything will stay the same forever. People do change. Contrary to popular belief, not everyone meets the love of their life on the Hogwarts Express.'
“’Night,” came Ron’s voice, out of the darkness. There was nothing but breathing for a moment, and then Ron said, “Hey, Harry?”
'Yeah, that almost killed me,' Ron said and Harry sobered. 'Anyway, I think he's a slimy git, but if you're fine with it, have at it.'
They walked quickly, not speaking, though Ginny kept casting knowing looks at Hermione and grinning, upon which Hermione would press her lips together, as if to keep from smiling. At this, Ron would glower at the floor, and Harry would hurry them along, eager to get to Tonks and hopefully change the subject.
He was silent and did not look at Professor Kothari, nor acknowledge that he was late; behind him came Blaise Zabini, then Millicent Bulstrode, Pansy Parkinson, Theodore Nott, and two other Slytherin girls whose names Harry thought might be Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis. They all followed him wordlessly, and when Draco stopped beside Harry’s desk on his way to his seat, they all stopped behind him.
He hadn't planned to follow, but at Hermione's insistence, he hurried off, catching up to her on the second floor staircase. Though he drew level, she didn't slow her furious pace. 'Gin,' Harry called. 'Ginny, I'm sorry. Will you hold on a second? Come on—'
. You’re nobody. You don’t deserve my fucking touch, Malfoy. You don’t even deserve me looking at you.”
?' Pansy echoed. She looked about as happy as if she'd just swallowed a mouthful of Stinksap. 'That's what this is about? Is that why
“Oh, no,” Tonks said. “Everybody thinks you’re a hero. Caught the Snitch, hit by Bludgers, nearly died . . . it’s just what your public wants to hear.”
Harry ended up seated beside Lisa Turpin, a tidy, brown-haired girl who gave him an appraising look when he sat down. She’d walked in with Anthony, and Harry supposed Hermione had asked her to partner with him. He was too busy to mind, however; glancing around the classroom, he found that the class, already small, was over half Slytherin. Across the aisle, Malfoy leaned over to Blaise and whispered loudly, “
'I'll see what I find,' Aberforth nods.  He looks almost amused.  'Anything else, while you're at it?'
“I don’t want to sit down!” Harry shot back. Dumbledore only raised an eyebrow at him as if to say, as you wish, which left Harry standing rather awkwardly in the middle of the office. Tonks, Andromeda, and Dumbledore were all looking at him patiently, awaiting his next outburst. It was nearly enough to send him into one.
“Be that as it may, I want you to be careful.” She looked at him solemnly for a long moment before standing up and stacking her books in a pile. “I’ve got to go to the library before curfew. But, Harry, if you don’t tell Ron at least part of this, soon, I’m going to tell him. Because he deserves to know. But I also think that he deserves to hear it from you.”
Harry frowned. He’d expected repayment in exact change, even if Malfoy had been forced to borrow money from Parkinson. Or even, if Malfoy had been particularly rotten, the quills themselves, returned to him. Instead, he’d got . . . this. Whatever it was.
“If your dad’s all you lose out of this,” he said, simply, “you should feel lucky, Malfoy.” And with that, he turned away and walked out of the dungeons without a backwards glance.
For an odd reason, Harry thought of Dudley and his habit of breaking things when furious. Now that he thought about it, Malfoy did seem like the sort to ferociously protect his own belongings. Yeah, he'd break other people's things before he broke his own.
Harry stands there for a few minutes, looking out at the dark and wondering what he is really doing, and if any of it makes sense.  Then, he ducks back inside, pulls out the second blanket, and flicks off the light.
'Very original,' Harry snorted. Students had been snogging there since, he wagered, Godric Gryffindor's time.
Her hair is hanging limp around her shoulders and the instant he speaks, her eyes redden with unshed tears.  Before he can even come to terms with the fact that Pansy Parkinson might be about to
“Maybe Lupin will come back,” Harry said hopefully. “He’s only doing Order stuff now, isn’t he? Anyway, nobody cares if he’s a werewolf, now that Lucius Malfoy’s not on the board.”
Harry nodded, despite an odd reluctance, which he thought Hermione could sense. It wasn’t that he was protecting Malfoy. Why would he want to protect someone who was supporting Voldemort? But ever since he’d seen Malfoy slump out of Tonks’s rooms, cringing away from Moody, he’d felt—
They went to the beach later, the three of them, Hermione barefoot and the full sky, their robes flapping in the wind. Hermione devised a kite from a transfigured scrap of parchment and a thread she picked from the sleeve of her robe and engorged. It dived through the air like a dancing bird and Ron picked up Hermione and swung her, shrieking, in a circle. Harry held the kite. The color of the sky reminded him of Malfoy, that bruised, determined gray.
“Well, I—" Hermione faltered, looking uncertain. “I told Anthony I’d partner with him when he asked me. I’d forgotten Ron wouldn’t be there,” she explained, seeing Harry’s panicked expression. “Oh, Harry, you can work with somebody else, don’t look at me like that!”
'We aren't working, this isn't working,' she snapped. 'It's been like this since last year, you running off to do whatever you like, and leaving me to wonder what's going on and if you're all right, and when you'll tell me what's going on. I thought it'd be different after the war but it isn't, you're still keeping secrets. You don't think I can handle anything, you don't want me to be part of it.'
Neville is looking at Harry as if he expects Harry to clear it up in a moment, to explain everything away.  Harry swallows.  'Well,' he says, 'there were only two of them, weren't there?'
Harry moved closer, though; everything was out of focus without his glasses. He eventually collided with Malfoy's warm limbs and tried to make sense of them, tracing a hand down his arm, thumb wrapping around his wrist. Malfoy turned his face into Harry's shoulder and Harry skimmed his hand up Malfoy's back, feeling him shudder gently at the touch. He looked all mussed now, hair rumpled from sleep and pajama top askew, and Harry was sure he was not much better. When he slipped his fingers through Malfoy's hair, Malfoy made a small noise that was almost contented.
'Wait!' Ron says, jolting Harry out of his thoughts.  'Harry, hey!  Didn't you make Kreacher and Dobby follow him?  Didn't you have them tail him to find out what he was—'
‘Yes.’ He rolled onto his side and actually looked up at Malfoy, who had his legs over the edge of the bed but was now turned back, looking at Harry. Hazy pre-dawn light softened the sharp lines of his profile. ‘I usually am, when you leave.’
The common room was empty and still, the only sound the crackle of the fire. Though it was only the first night, he saw things littered around already: someone's ink-stained Transfiguration text, a broken chess piece, a handful of Exploding Snap cards. Over by the window, someone's toad was hopping from sill to sill as if hoping for escape. The fire was still going merrily, though in the dark the flames cast long shadows on the walls.
Hermione snorted. “Come on, you two,” she said wryly. “We should get back too, before the Blibbering Humdingers come.”
It’s a quiet affair, no reporters, no photographers at all. Hermione’s the only one with a camera—Muggle pictures only, Harry insists—and she snaps as much as she can: Charlie, straightening George’s robes; Fleur, holding Victoire’s hand with her left, as her right settles on her pregnant belly; the roses wrapped around the ends of the pews, dark red, a sad color.  Harry hadn’t wanted an autumn wedding at first, had thought all weddings should be summer ones like the first he’d attended, but fall is Ginny’s favorite season.  Fall, like Ginny, all gold and red, coming down the aisle towards him and hushing her mum out of the side of her mouth, half-laughing, walking faster as if she can’t stop herself.  She folds into him so easily when she reaches him, her back warm and exposed against the palm of his hand, and she giggles, says, ‘Fancy meeting you here,’ and from the back of the church, Harry hears Hermione’s camera snap, hears Arthur Weasley give a small cough.
Draco could tell that Severus was speaking from personal experience and it had his back straightening. His godfather wasn’t one to open up, and it was enough for Draco to
“Yes, well.” Draco shakes his head and doesn’t look at Harry. “Not tonight. I don’t want to talk about that tonight.”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, he didn’t bother to look up as he took the books from her hands. “I don’t think I’ll be able to read both before summer holiday happens.”
When Alpsi apparated in, Draco knew it was a summons, and by the screams from below, he knew it hadn’t been his father who made the decision.
Harry stares at Draco for one long, cold minute. “You’ve always been a selfish bloody coward. I hope you enjoy mooching around London by yourself and talking to your owl in that big lonely house of yours. God forbid you’d ever take a chance at being happy.”
He tried not to grimace at that. “I have something I want to talk to you about. I want to talk about Regulus.”
His entire life had been changed from Regulus’ letters. It couldn't end now, not when he still felt like lessons needed to be learned, and paths needed to be chosen. Regulus couldn’t leave his life, not in such a confusing manner. Not when Draco still wasn’t sure what had happened to Regulus, wasn’t sure how his cousin had met an early departure.
A pointed jab to his side had Draco sighing as he made room for Dobby to lay next to him. If Dobby really did want to stop whatever his father was planning, then it would make sense to go to Potter. Dumbledore’s golden boy would be the prime person to present evidence to.
To try. That’s what the crux of it was. Draco wasn’t sure how his own path would go, but he would try—because that’s all he could do.
“That’s where you are wrong,” Draco whispered, eyes falling to the letter as he thought of the path Regulus walked down. “Some things can’t be fixed.”
Draco bit his lip to stop from further laughing. He had to run when Neville narrowed his eyes, he knew what that look meant.
) to dragon-hide boots. One of the most welcome new additions sits squarely between the Joiners and the site for the new Centaurs. Bulstrode’s Binders and Bespoke Tailoring.
Draco knew that Neville had a hard time with lessons as it was, but he couldn’t look into excited eyes and offer anything but an affirmative. If Neville wanted to teach him, then who was he to deny that?
They stared at each other, and Draco wished he knew what Potter’s problem was. There seemed to be a discord since they last talked, and he didn’t like it.
“I’m saying that whatever you do from now on, make sure it’s at your pace, and at your whim. Dumbledore is—” Draco grimaced as he tried to refrain from being judgmental. “He’s pretty rigid in his beliefs, probably a side effect of being old.”
Draco let out an exaggerated gasp but paused at the bottom of the stairs to kiss Harry’s cheek in greeting.
The tremor to Neville’s voice had Draco’s eyes closing tightly as hatred for his aunt flared strongly. He knew that it had happened when he had been just a baby, but that didn’t change the empathy that welled up.
“What do you want, Potter?” It wasn’t necessarily a sneer, but it wasn’t exactly polite either. “I happen to be busy, so if you’ve just come to harass us, I’d rather you pull out your wand right now and have done with it.”
The hall was quiet, though they could both hear the muffled shouts from inside. 'It won't be as bad now,' Harry said. 'They aren't bringing the Dementors back.'
'Charlie doesn't seem to mind special treatment, actually,' Hermione said, leaning against a pillar. 'Malfoy would be wasting his time buying chocolates, since all the girls are doing it. Asking for extra lessons, and thanking him with sweets and flowers and things. Haven't you been in his office lately? It's overflowing.'
Malfoy steps out the door, looking belligerently embarrassed.  'I never,' he says, 'I never got my license.  There wasn't—my birthday wasn't til June, and by then—'
Over at the Slytherin table, Pansy Parkinson and Daphne Greengrass were the only ones in sight, both looking determined to stand their ground. When Harry left Ron and Hermione and began moving towards them, however, Pansy paled.
'Because of you,' Malfoy says, but it's not rancor in his voice; in fact, it's almost like a question.
the article had read. Next to the article, there had been a strip of fugitive pictures. One of them was Lucius Malfoy. Another, Dolohov, and Harry had recognized the scowling faces of Macnair and Rookwood.
It was sometime in February when he woke to Malfoy sitting up beside him. It was still that foggy window of time between sleep and daylight, and the rustle of blankets stirred something warm in Harry’s chest, the same rush of fondness that used to well up when he woke in the tent and heard the low murmur of Hermione and Ron talking outside, or the clink of Hermione’s spoon against her teacup as she sat with her book, the quiet intimacy of lives overlapping.
'I meant that we saved his life!' Ron exclaimed. 'Don't get me wrong, I don't want to have dinner at Malfoy's house—'
Ron snorts from where he's sitting, able to hear the whole thing.  'More importantly, Smith,' he says, 'do you happen to have a big gold cup lying about your house?  Because we need it.'
“Doesn’t matter if your dad’s out of Azkaban,” Ron shot at him. “He’s dead meat. And you’re never getting your stuff back. My dad said the Ministry’s taken it all.”
They're both quiet for a long time, and Harry starts to think that Malfoy has fallen asleep when he hears Malfoy's teeth chatter.  'Oh, for god's sakes,' he says, and rolls over, yanking his blanket with him, until he encounters something warm that yelps.
comes.  'Anything good?' Ron asks, wandering into the kitchen with his dress robes draped over his arm.  His hair is sticking up in the back, and he looks as if he's just woken up.
She was smiling over at them fondly. 'I'm glad Malfoy has his friends back,' she mused. 'He looks happier, doesn't he?'
'Probably because everyone else is busy pairing off,' Harry snapped. 'Excuse me if I don't want to watch you lot staring at each other and holding hands all day.'
They stared at one another, Malfoy like a cornered animal. 'That's the point!' he snarled at last. 'If I had to, to
“I’d do it again,” Harry said roughly, dangerously. “Don’t you ever doubt it. I wouldn’t even hesitate.”
“You are an abysmal failure, Potter,” Snape snarled at him during the next Occlumency lesson, glaring at him from where he stood beside his desk. “I have been working with you since last Christmas, and you have hardly made progress! That hopeless worm Longbottom could do better.”
“—Pritchard passes, and—oh, interception from Gryffindor, a nice save from Ginny Weasley! Back towards Slytherin, and she dodges Baddock, nice turn there, ready to—oh, that must’ve hurt, Bludger to the side—now Baddock’s got it, there they go—throws to Pucey, who dodges MacDonald—oh, and it’s back to Baddock now, great bit of teamwork there—and he’s heading for goal, he’s shooting—Ron Weasley as Keeper, stretches out to block—"
'Right,' Harry says, glancing away from Malfoy to hide his smile.  'And I'll do the Apparating.  You can't even make it across the room on a good day.'
They hadn’t spoken of the kiss since it had happened the day before; Draco had come down for dinner and they had acted as if nothing at all had happened, though he didn’t speak to Harry until halfway through the meal. Unable to conceal his relief that Draco hadn’t fled, Harry had kept glancing at him when he wasn’t looking. And to make matters worse, Remus had been watching both of them curiously, as if he could sense that something was not quite right.
'Stop, Potter,' he said at last. 'Look, it doesn't matter, I've said I don't want to talk about it.'
At the top of the stairs, a life size statue waited, and his head swiveled slowly to look at Harry as he ran past. On the wall, several dim figures fled from portrait to portrait to watch him, most of them as pale and blonde as Draco. His feet were pounding on ringing tile and he grasped the doorknob of the first door he saw, though it twisted wildly in his grasp and bit him. He seized it again and wrenched the door open.
'Yeah,' Malfoy said. He'd gone pale while Harry was speaking, and his fingers were white where they clutched his wand. 'I, I know that.'
Harry stared at him before turning back to the wall. He knew how it felt, he supposed, to be so singled out —that night at the club—
“Yeah,” Harry said absently, pulling out his wand. Glancing around the classroom, he saw former DA members settling into dueling stances, looking confident. He felt an odd surge of pride. Across the room, Ernie Macmillan gave him a friendly smile.
He looked even paler than he had that afternoon, something scared and angry in his posture. Yet at the sight of Harry and his friends, Malfoy’s expression went from bitterly relieved to furious in a second.
Harry did not particularly want to think about it, much less talk about it, but he leaned against the wall, exhausted, and said dully, “I was going to practice some Defense by myself. So I went to the Room of Requirement, but Draco—I thought it was Draco—he was there. And he apologized—we’d been fighting, see—and we.” Harry flushed, trying to look anywhere but at Dumbledore, whose twinkly blue eyes seemed to already know. “We, um, sort of made up. But I got angry, and we were arguing—"
When he reaches the fireplace, he sees Hermione on her knees, leaning towards someone in the fire.  '. . . has got to be an easier way,' she is saying, brow furrowed.  'Polyjuice Potion is just too easy to obtain.  The fake Mad-Eye Moody had us fooled for nearly a year.  I'm still not certain that Harry's himself—'
“It’s funny, I could have sworn there were actual methods to Occlumency. Proper protocols, a set guideline, and definitely a good teacher.”
Draco sighed and continued filling up the water bowls. No, thinking about Hogwarts didn’t do him any good. He couldn’t change his past and he was stuck in a present where he couldn’t even afford to write to his mother without saving up, so letters to friends were unfortunately out of the question at the moment. Ironic for someone working in an owlery... But at least he had “his” owls for company.
Draco shrugged playfully. “You’ve never been to one of my father’s charity events. Tradition is archaic in most cases. Besides, you never wanted to be a champion in the first place. Live a little, be a rebel—I thought Gryffindors liked to break the mould.”
Of course, he understood why his mother had needed a change of scenery. The death of her husband in an Azkaban prison riot had nearly broken her. Draco hadn’t known what to do or how to help her at the time. Thankfully, her sister Andromeda had reached out to her, recognising in her a kindred spirit, their grief reconciling the two sisters; both having lost a loved one in the war and now needing to get away from all the memories surrounding them.
As a flash of red shot out of his father’s wand, Draco’s mind was too distracted to care about the sting of a hex.
Draco pulled Dobby into a hug, amused by the surprised squeak that was released. “I missed you too.”
In the end Draco decides not to go to the courts, more restless than usual at this point in the afternoon. The itch beneath his skin has intensified in recent weeks, like the electric closeness of the air before a thunderstorm. At some point he stopped grasping the days by the hands and living each one with defiant purpose. Now his aimless wandering through the streets of London is an exercise in whiling away time in the expectation that
“I’m not sure.” Draco frowns and takes in the bars, many of which have thick layers of dust on their windows. He moves closer to one, rubbing his hand over the glass but all the grime seems to be on the inside, not the out. Draco can’t shake the image of a past full of dreams never fully realised. Where did all the witches and wizards of Little Compton Street go, when Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade have no more spaces for them than they did all those decades ago?
“Really?” Potter asks, amused. “You seem very interested in the things I get up to. Hermione gave me a book, if you’d like some tips. There’s this really nifty thing you can do if you’re in the middle of—”
Dobby’s ears drooped as he looked to the ground. “Winky be knowing, Draco. She doesn’t care, misses her old Master.”
“I best be going,” Draco said, closing his cloak tighter around him. “It was nice talking to you, Potter.”
. He remembered how much Aunt Petunia gushed when Dudley would sing along with it whenever it played on the radio—tunelessly, but he didn't dare to say it! Harry, of course, was scarcely allowed to make noise, much less
The examiner rushed forward and helped guide Potter into a sitting position, but Draco couldn’t hear what had been said. It was obvious by the way Potter shook his head that he was declining further assistance, either to the hospital wing or something else.
“Am I Sirius Black in this scenario?” Draco doesn’t care to point out that on the basis of the evidence they have to hand Black was probably head over heels for James Potter who ended up marrying his pretty redhead. There’s a certain irony to the situation that isn’t lost on Draco.
“Plenty.” Harry steadfastly doesn’t say anything further, until the silence gets somewhat uncomfortable. He raises his eyebrows at Draco. “If you reckon his ghost should hex my bollocks off just for reading the thing, I can’t imagine you think he’d be happy if I started sharing his secrets?”
Draco closed his eyes tightly, ever thankful he took a chance and put himself out there. Neville may be a brash Gryffindor, and an idiot sometimes, but he truly was a great friend.
“How are we supposed to check?” Potter’s eyes were still on Draco, but the question had been directed elsewhere.
The room had been his safe haven for so long; it had been the place of many conversations with Dobby, many games and tickle wars between them. His room had been lived in happily, despite the circumstances.
The narrowing of the Hippogriff’s eyes should have been warning enough, but Dobby always did tell Draco he could be stupid at times.
“I have a few more days of denial ahead of me,” whispered Draco as he held Potter’s hand to his cheek, unwilling to let the comfort leave.
“What happens if she Vanishes them?” That would have been his first thought if things had been reversed.
Most of his path had been both singular in the direction and in means of comfort—it had been lonely. But going forward would be filled with many people; people who cared about him and wanted to be there.
Draco’s eyes were wide by the time he finished the letter. Kreacher? What use would the Dark Lord have for a house elf? The fact that Regulus had been worried, caused Draco to become worried.
Before Draco could try and come up with something witty or slightly comforting to say, Potter looked up at him through his lashes, and suddenly he couldn’t remember his line of thought.
The door swung open easily, something Draco was suspicious of. After Umbridge’s office had been broken into, he figured there would be
“Might as well.” Harry murmurs a spell which brings up a hazy clock face, showing the time to be three in the morning. It shivers, shimmers and fades. “We’ve been here for hours.”
Draco’s heart flips which is very dangerous territory. It could only have been more perfect if Potter had said
“Regulus spoke of you in his letters, how you have always known who you are and what you wanted. He didn’t have that, he didn’t know what he was supposed to be, so he listened to your mother until there was nothing but her wishes propelling him. Can you tell me that he could have confided in you without you trying to change him as she had? Would you have been unbiased? Or would you have hated him for his choices?”
“For the record I don’t actually want to be fisted,” Draco says in a murmur. “The other things though...”  he thinks the satisfied
Draco winced as he picked at the duvet. “You can just call me Draco. I’m not your Master, and I never should have been in the first place.”
It wasn’t hard to believe, not with the clues laid out, but why did his status as a werewolf matter? It was bigotry all over again, only it wasn’t geared at Muggles or Muggleborns.
“It’s not like home,” Neville remarked, gesturing towards their own bleak tent where Draco’s father had peacocks tied out front.
“Sure, Malfoy. Whatever you say.” Harry’s leg presses against Draco’s again and neither of them make any move to pull away.
He pulled another book towards him, albeit reluctantly, when the sound of a peck on the window had him craning his neck in time to see a familiar owl. Draco rushed forward and grabbed the letter. Usually, the owl left quickly, but on its way out, the owl stopped on his shoulder to nuzzle the side of his head before it took off.
“The temperature spells are beginning to wear off and the roof is leaking again. This is NOT a fallen-in country house where a bunch of owls found refuge. This is the Owl Post Owlery in Diagon Alley! It should be the finest in the country!”
With each word Dumbledore spoke, Umbridge became paler and paler until her face was ashen, and her hands trembled.
“I’m sure she would be horrified,” Black said in a deadpan tone, and Draco had never been more curious in his life. Just what went on in the Noble House of Black?
“There are plenty of rooms to choose from,” Black continued as if Lupin hadn’t spoken. “I’d say my home is your home but let’s face it, no one wants to live here. Except maybe Kreacher, and is that
Chaos ensued when Potter returned with the Triwizard cup in one hand and the other clutching a dead body—Diggory’s dead body.
It wasn’t a surprise, not after the other names had been mentioned. He knew from his mother that Bellatrix was high up in the Dark Lord’s circle.
Weasley shook his head as he glared off into the distance. Patil grunted before she stormed away, shooting Weasley her own look of contempt.
“He thinks they know who killed your father.” Harry sighs and pushes a hand through his hair. “You might not believe anyone cares, but the Ministry doesn’t let cases go unsolved, not anymore. I asked Kingsley to let me know if he had any news while I was on leave.” Harry winces. “I thought it might be easier coming from me.”
Draco ran a hand through his hair as he shook his head. "I didn't realize that treating others with human decency was a problem."
Unlike the other part of Little Compton Street, the courtyard has the appearance of being open air, but like the brickwork archway that too is an illusion. The sky is as false as the one in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. The rain has been relentless in London, but here the sky is like sunset on a hot summer day. The clouds are burnished reds and oranges, the hazy brilliance of it making everything warmer than Draco’s ever felt under London’s rainy skies. He wonders if Little Compton Street is always like this: a place where the sun never rises or sets. Draco can’t tell if it’s supposed to signify the cusp of night or the promise of a breaking dawn, but it lends a timeless beauty to the courtyard and the surrounding hostelries. An enormous rainbow flag billows and wafts in the breeze, hanging from the sky without anything keeping it in place. Everywhere Draco looks there are new things to see—bright lights in a thousand different colours, imprints of fairy wings which flutter and shimmer when the light catches them, thick, waxy candles marking out paths for the people walking along the cobbles and a huge, brightly coloured tent with a pointed roof sitting on a wide expanse of green grass, with a rickety wooden sign declaring the space to be Compton Common.
Draco knocked on the door harder than normal and snorted when he could hear Sirius complaining louder than the screams of Walburga.
“Maybe.” The barman shrugs. “Most folk that come here remember the seventies, when the Ministry was corrupted and nobody knew who to trust. I don’t know if they’d be happy to see Aurors walking around Little Compton Street.” He gives Harry an apologetic look. “We lost a lot of people and things never quite recovered after that. Word of mouth only goes so far if people are scared of talking.”
Harry’s cheeks flush red and he rubs his jaw, embarrassed. “Hermione does a lot of things. She, err, has all sorts of causes.”
Draco wasn’t sure what Weasley said in response, but he wasn’t surprised that they were trying to figure it out.
, the first creep of advertising that almost certainly won’t be the last. The brick walls are covered with advertising for male grooming products, magical lube companies promising
Draco felt a little pity as Potter was forced to listen to his Valentine in public. But really, he was just amused. It wasn’t until he looked down at his feet and noticed a diary that his amusement faded into confusion.
Harry rolls his eyes. “It was mainly because I don’t believe in holding grudges and I think she’s changed. A bit. She even asked after Hermione, through gritted teeth.” He grins at Draco. “I just don’t think she likes me, much.”
Draco understands the frustration, even though he knows that statistically the chances of Potter having contracted even an annoying but swiftly curable STI are remote. Draco has had his own moments and things he regrets. For the most part though he wants to wipe the embarrassment from Harry's face, desperate not to add
Despite the chaos of the day, so much pressure had been lifted off his shoulders, and he was tired of denying himself what he wanted.
“I never thought it would be,” Draco replies. He can’t imagine Harry not doing something with institutional gravitas that allows him to do honourable things.
“Some Herbologists refuse to take in plants from certain countries, and only because of origin and not because of death factor.”
Draco watched Neville place a hand to his chin and couldn’t help but appreciate the change in their friendship. Sure, it was clear that Neville still thought she was madder than all could be, but at least he was listening.
“You fancied me.” Draco sits back in the seat, sure his disbelief must be written all over his face.
Draco bowed, silently praying he wasn’t about to be attacked with the back of his neck open for the taking.
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. Warning Potter was the extent of his help—he didn’t want to do much else.
They stared at each other, and Draco hoped Potter could understand the words that he wasn’t voicing. So much should be said, so much needed to be brought up, but as always, Potter
The sounds of his classmates talking at once had Draco sighing as Hagrid carried him to the Hospital Wing.
When Dobby appeared determined, Draco briefly wondered what other crazy idea he would come up with next. If Dobby wasn’t careful, he would harm Potter rather than protect him.
The sound of the door closing cut off anything Moody would have said and it was exactly what Draco wanted. Part of him wondered if he would regret his outburst, but the sounds of the other students and the look on Neville’s face hardened his resolve. No—he wouldn’t regret any of it.
Draco wasn’t sure if it was a smart decision. He knew he would get too many questions and it would even make it back to his father, but he wasn’t so sure he could walk a path alone. He wasn’t strong like Potter, nor did he have the support system as others. If Draco was destined to only have a handful of friends, then he wanted to make them count.
“I changed already, Neville. I used to believe in his words, used to want nothing more than his plan for me. I used to want that pride. What does that say about me?”
When they stopped by Weasley to relax, Potter immediately began regaling Weasley of what they heard.
Draco shrugged, not wanting to show his hand early. Besides, it wasn’t as if Severus’ opinion would hold that much weight. Facts and opinions were two separate things.
Severus cleared his throat before he looked at Draco closely. “He died sometime during the war. Not too long after you were born.”
He tried not to let that get to him, tried not to care that his father would never care about him, but it stung—hurt more than he cared to admit.
“Anyway.” Harry continues as if he hasn’t just further demonstrated his lack of respect for the dead, “She wouldn’t know the first thing about Sirius. She hated him. I’m not asking her anything.”
Before Draco could really delve into the thought deeper, he became distracted by the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher’s speech.
“Theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examinations. Which is the whole point, is it not? As long as you have studied the theory, there is no reason to think you won’t pass the tests.”
throws Draco’s mood to shit, with its pictures of Harry and Ginny walking through the streets of Diagon Alley. Harry is bundled up warm, his Gryffindor scarf around his neck, and Ginny looks better than ever with a brilliant shine to her auburn hair and fashionable skinny jeans and a big, cape-style overcoat. They make it look so easy, strolling through the streets together and as hard as he tries, Draco can’t imagine himself in Weasley’s position, looking across at Harry with shining eyes, laughing at his jokes.
Draco shook his head violently. “Maybe the first lesson, your mind might be more active, but that’s to be expected. But as time passes, you should become more firm in your practices. If your mind is feeling broken into, then there is a problem.”
“Rudolphus needs additional rest and fortifying treats. He just delivered a long-distance express letter from Greece. And Agnes seems to have had another run-in with Mrs Eccleston’s cat. See to it that the scratches heal properly!”
Draco grabbed a book on the history of imprisoned Muggles during the Global Wizarding War and set out to find an alcove where he could read in peace when he came across Granger, Potter and Weasley surrounded by a mountain of books.
It was strange. Draco would have taken theoretical lessons with Moody over practical ones in a heartbeat, but with Umbridge it was the opposite. Her goals weren’t to educate them, but to give them only part of the information, and see who could pass.
Regulus had been someone who knew they made mistakes and aimed to teach the next generation, even if it was only one person.
“I’ll show you around. I know how nosy you are,” Harry says. It’s rich, considering Harry is one who asks impertinent questions about whether people enjoy using sex toys or not.
“It’s not magical. It’s stupid. You can throw it in the bin if you like.” Draco’s cheeks heat and he tugs his collar away from his neck. “It was a joke.”
The last remaining minutes felt longer than the full hour they had already taken. He stared down at the parchment, his eyes unseeing and not focused on the words.
Potter’s eyes trace Draco’s body with a slow up and down, before settling on his face once more. “Maybe.”
Potter’s brows burrowed before he laughed, somewhat wetly. “Is that like drawing the shorter stick?”
“How do you know this?” The suspicion in Black had spread to Lupin as both stared at him with their arms crossed and their foreheads pinched.
he gets off on it. He gets off on the filthy, glorious fantasy of being stretched open and fucked. He thinks he might be a bit of a size queen at heart, or at least fantasy Draco is. He suspects real Draco might not take too kindly to an actual fist up his arse, not that he cares if other people like to do it.
, Greg. I don’t care if you get on with Weasley, you should be friends with him. We all need friends.”
As Draco sighed, he realized he was still staring at Potter. Usually, Potter tended to glare—something Draco loved to see; anger simmering in Potter’s eyes was always something that could lift his mood—but Potter wasn’t glaring. No, there was open curiosity there, and he wasn’t sure what to do with it.
“Because people were giving me peculiar looks and I had to leave, despite having arranged a late lunch at The Ivy.”
“Can you keep a secret?” Potter leans forward, the air of a co-conspirator about him. It makes the moment intimate and warm.
“That’s because it doesn’t matter to me,” Regulus explained, eyes soft and a patient smile in place. “I told you from the beginning that I would always love whoever you turned out to be. Death Eater or not.”
Draco looked up and down Dobby, glad to see that his sack had been upgraded to something that was at least clean.
Harry brushes his lips against the base of Draco’s cock, mouthing lightly over his balls. “Everything you say makes me want to fuck you.”
“He’s in the Ministry. There’s a room in the Department of Mysteries full of shelves covered in these little glass balls, and they’re at the end of row ninety-seven. He’s trying to use Sirius to get whatever it is he wants from in there. I think he’s torturing him, he said he’ll end up killing him.”
McGonagall gave him a weeks’ worth of detention, but it was worth it. Anything was worth not having to listen to his father.
“Longbottom!” Draco yelled loudly as the majority of those in the class were making their way into the Great Hall for lunch.
“You could come for a pint with us,” Greg offers. He doesn’t look certain about it, but Draco appreciates the offer more than he can say.
Perhaps Potter was right. The choice itself didn’t matter as much as Draco being the one to decide did. As long as he was the deciding factor, then it
. He has his father to thank for that, too. People are distrustful of Malfoys who claim to have repented for their sins.
Draco’s phone rings and he answers it with a roll of his eyes. “I might have known you couldn’t resist the promise of something involving sex.”
“I think you can bullshit your way out of anything,” Neville returned with a wide grin as Draco glared at him.
It wasn’t until he walked into the Great Hall and took in the Gryffindor table covered in letters, and the rest of the students with copies of the
“Don’t be obtuse.” Draco leans over to take a forkful of Potter’s cake because if he’s going to sit there moaning like he’s an extra in a budget porno, the least he can do is share some of his chocolate cake. “I didn’t know you owned property in Diagon Alley.”
“Right,” Draco yawned and got up from the bed. “Bath, food, sleep. First you, then me. And maybe a name for you, what do you think?”
“Just give her a sickle and she’ll shut up,” Finnigan grumbled loud enough for everyone else in the hall to hear.
Harry makes a strangled sound and sucks at a particularly sensitive part of Draco's neck. “Fuck, yes. I want you to call me if you want it. Get me over just because you need me. Call me at midnight, I don’t care. Get me hard and use me, however you like.”
Draco was walking past the shops in Hogsmeade, not really paying attention to his surroundings. Neville had detention with Snape, and that left either waiting around pathetically for him or to go to Hogsmeade alone.
Harry’s laughter is warm in Draco’s ear. The sound sends pleasure through Draco’s body and he gets a sudden, powerful image of Harry on his knees with the Muggle telly flickering in the background.
How does one change for the better? Was there a way to do that? Realization couldn’t be the only step, there were other things that he could do to genuinely change.
McGonagall looks between Draco and Harry and sighs. “You two be careful. I can’t imagine this will be easy for either of you, but if it makes you happy you certainly have the support of the Hogwarts Staff, or those I can vouch for in any event.”
“Don’t try to weasel out if it.” Draco can’t resist smirking at Harry. “I didn’t realise. These last two months must have been torture for you.”
“I want it to be inclusive. You would think that Herbology wouldn’t have social constructs, but the exclusionary methods some people go to astound me.”
“It’s the song from Black’s diary.” Draco brushes his fingers against Harry’s jumper, which is just as soft and warm as it looks. “An excellent choice.”
“I didn’t expect it to get blown out of proportion. I didn’t expect for my father to act like he gives a damn.”
“I’m no angel. I might not take everything under the sun now, because I don't think that was helping. I still like sex. I usually go to saunas when I feel the need.”
When Draco pushed open the door, he saw a chair waiting for him. He sighed, knowing it meant he would be expected to linger.
There was an appeal there. Draco was good at judging people, but he also liked the idea of not picking anything.
“I remember.” Harry’s tone doesn’t hold any judgment or condemnation. He’s serious, but dispassionate, neither apologetic or triumphant. “They asked us to keep an eye on you all when the Wizengamot overturned the convictions of anyone under the age of twenty-one.”
“Power in the hands of those who would use it on the innocent are dangerous. I’m not suggesting that Hagrid shouldn’t have used a tamer animal for third years, but that doesn’t mean his teaching should be called into question by the government. It’s a school matter, one that should be handled internally.”
“For fuck’s sake,” Black said loudly as he opened and closed the door repeatedly. “The first time was supposed to get you to stop.”
When his father continued to stare, Draco tried not to fidget—such an action would only prove it was all a farce.
It’s damned near impossible to think clearly with Harry talking in that husky way of his, sliding Draco’s shirt off his shoulders and letting it pool to the floor. Harry moves his hands to the buckle of Draco’s belt and he mouths over his jawline, in a damp path up to Draco’s ear.
“But it shouldn’t be like that!” Draco cried, running his hands through his hair. “You shouldn’t have to make peace. You should be doing what you want, what you love to do.”
Draco took a step back. He took a deep breath before grabbing hold of Potter’s sleeve and dragging him to an empty classroom.
“I hate the press,” Draco says, bitterly. “Although you probably think I deserve everything they say about me.”
Neville laughed before he wiped his eyes. “No, you wouldn’t. Just as you know I wouldn’t actually kill anyone.”
Draco can’t quite place the singer, but he has a sense he’s met her before. The ruddy face with its bold, distinctive features is both familiar and not. She looks like a well-dressed gentleman from another era, with a waistcoat and pocket watch that Draco instantly admires. She has grey hair arranged in a quiff of sorts, and a jovial expression on her face. She stops to whisper something to a woman on the table closest to the stage, whose hair is piled on her head in a tidy bun.
“That doesn’t explain anything. I’m sure half the students today knew their fear and faced it anyway.”
It wasn’t until Draco caught sight of a familiar mop of messy hair that he knew his day would get interesting.
He looked down to the torn pages of the paper and couldn't help but wonder if it was an omen. Would he be split in the same way when his father demands a certain route? Would he be torn as easily as a newspaper? Or would he have a backbone somewhere?
As Umbridge talked about change and the things she aimed to improve, he couldn’t help but frown. It was clear that she wasn’t entering the year as a teacher, or someone who cared about teaching the next generation—no, she was concerned about the Ministry. Or more importantly, the Ministry’s politics.
The days after their departure were just as hectic as if they had never left. Several students stepped up in an attempt to replace the Weasley twins. The pranks weren’t nearly as good, but it kept Umbridge busy, and that was always fun to watch. The teachers seemed to ignore it for the most part, and it had him curious as to whether the students or the teachers hated her more.
“Your turn to ask a question,” Draco says. Thinking about the choices he made since the war is almost as depressing as thinking about the choices he made during it.
“If you like.” Harry tugs Draco into a kiss, his voice deep with arousal. “I’m actually looking forward to this.”
“With the breakout, the disappearances and even the deaths, things are getting serious, and I want to be ready. I want to be able to make a difference.”
Harry captures Draco’s hand and kisses it, before shifting closer, running his hand down Draco’s chest to his belly. “I cut you open, once.”
Draco pockets his wand and decides not to spend any longer on Potter and his hair-brained schemes. “There’s nothing here for me. Enjoy your evening, if you manage to get inside.”
“And not a single Wrackspurt,” she said more to herself than them. “So strange. No Nargles in sight either.”
“They know darkness, their existence brings debate—those who will vilify them and condemn them one minute but then use them for their own benefit the next. They are an omen, a bad symbol among society, and yet, people can’t stop talking about them.”
“I didn’t know you were visiting anyone,” Weasley bellowed with not much tact as he tried to look over the divisions keeping the beds separated.
“But Harry, you’ve never been there,” Granger said, voice still soft. “You’ve only dreamed about the place, that’s all.”
Harry’s cheeks get hot and Ginny snorts under her breath. “You two can stop that until Millie gets here. Keep it clean, Malfoy.”
Paul leads them outside, taking them down a side street away from the main courtyard. They stop in front of a ramshackle row of shops which are all boarded up. On the brickwork is a huge poster with weathered print reading
Draco clenched his hands briefly as he tried to maintain a calm expression. It was hard listening to his father and continue to be what was expected of him.
“I shouldn’t care whether Potter remains fixed in his position. My ability to be good isn’t dependent on someone else. And I should do it for me.”
“Okay.” Draco feels suddenly awkward, and in the end settles for leaning in and pressing a kiss to Harry’s jaw which wasn’t quite the intended target. “Thanks, Potter.”
“Being good is so hard,” Draco said, eyes still closed. “Why is that? Why is it easy to do the wrong thing?”
a role model, just not in the way one would expect. Every major life lesson had been something Regulus taught him. He had learned who he wanted to be and what he didn’t want to become through the letters. Regulus had shaped everything, had changed so much.
“That’s because those who don’t understand will vilify it. Don’t let them shame you into hiding it.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Draco said innocently, eyes wide as he adopted a look that had stopped working on Dobby when he had been three. “Sir.” The last bit was added with a tiny smirk that he just couldn’t hide.
Draco blinked rapidly when large fingers tentatively touched the back of his hands. “Even if you were busy with a dozen unreasonable tasks, you always made time for me. Whether it was a new adventure that you imagined we would one day go on, or if it was gossip from the other house elves. You’re my best friend, and I’m only just now realizing how wrong that is.”
The Dark Lord did not resemble something human. The mixture of animalistic features was startling. Red eyes peered into his own, and Draco thanked everything he had that he had taught himself Occlumency as the stare increased in intensity. Long pale fingers toyed with a wand as if it were unimportant, but Draco knew that it was for show. Thin lips were quirked in an oddly pleasant manner, but he could see right through it. There was a dangerous tilt to the Dark Lord’s lips and it put him on edge.
The difference was his emotions. Draco had cared for Potter each time they had kissed previously, but not with as much vigour, nor as deeply. As their lips moved slowly, Draco held on to Potter.
Harry runs a hand down Draco’s back and brushes his lips against Draco’s ear, which sends shivers down Draco’s spine. Harry’s hands are truly sublime. “That’ll do for starters. Then I want to see that bedroom of yours. The one where you were a snotty teenager, wanking over me.”
He watched Potter move to his other side and had to wonder why Dobby had asked in the first place. It wasn’t until Dobby winked at him that he realized there wasn’t a reason at all. Merlin, he loved Dobby.
Draco refuses to let Potter see how much that rankles, even though it does. He’s determined not to get into a debate on this kind of thing with Harry Potter, boy wonder, saviour of the wizarding world, erstwhile Auror and benevolent do-gooder. Draco is sure that despite his efforts to get back to a position where he can face looking at himself in the mirror every morning, Harry would still have something of an upper hand. He self-consciously scratches at the Mark on his forearm, hidden by the cotton of his shirt.
you.” Harry growls out his words and fucks Draco harder. His voice is rough as he pats and rubs inside Draco, sliding his fingers out entirely and then working them back in again, hard. “Ever been fisted, Malfoy?”
He smiled as he thought to all of Regulus’ letters and the repeated emphasis on being who he wanted to be.
He watched Harry leave with a small smile. When he looked up he tried to flush at the soft way Sirius looked between them.
. Was it easy for Regulus because he made mistakes? Was it easy to be righteous once wrong? Or was it hard to be wrong? Was there bravery in admitting one’s flaws?
A glance towards Madam Pince showed she was watching him closely and with suspicion, but Draco wasn’t sure how to ask for what he wanted. She wasn’t exactly a nice person.
“That’s what you say,” Draco mutters. His bad mood lifts a little, but he still has a restless itch under his skin, a dissatisfaction he can’t quite place. “You were doing something with boxes. Weasley is carrying a little Potter sproglet according to the news.”
Harry gives Draco another slow kiss, before slicking his fingers with lube. He moves to the side of Draco, pressing against him and kissing his neck with maddening sweetness. Draco doesn’t want tender. He’s so horny he just wants Harry to take him to all of those places Draco’s been thinking about from the moment he started developing an inconvenient fetish for Potter’s hands. He mutters a curse under his breath when Harry gets him in a position that holds him open, Draco's leg thrown over Potter’s side. He wraps an arm around Harry’s neck as Harry shifts behind him, fisting his hand in Harry’s hair. Harry might not be overly muscular or large, but he’s strong and he keeps Draco in place as he slides slick fingers over Draco, teasing him by applying pressure but never slipping inside.
The last part was practically shouted, spit flying everywhere. Draco sighed quietly. And people always said he was dramatic. He already knew what was coming next.
Paul sighs. “Wizards can’t half be arrogant twats thinking they’re impervious to everything. There’s plenty that can’t be remedied with magic, and it’s not just this.”
sort of person, when it comes to sex. He believes in setting boundaries and establishing full, enthusiastic consent, but it’s not the kind of thing he feels the need to keep checking. Now, though, there’s more pulsing through his veins than desire. He can feel it in the clutch of his heart, the way his breath hitches at the look in Harry’s face as much as it does at the physical sensation of fucking.
Harry lightens a little, the tension leaving his shoulders. “You were right about Hermione. Me and Ron have a laugh about her sometimes, caring about stuff so much. Maybe we should—”
“I really want to know who these bloody sources are,” Harry grumbles. He rakes his hand through his hair and sighs. “I’ll see how it goes at the Ministry.”
Draco tried to withhold a laugh, but his shoulders shook. “What would you call it then? He’s in the hospital wing.”
“That’s because they only had eyes for each other,” Neville chimed in with enough of a smug tone that Draco squeezed Potter’s hand.
“It doesn’t work like that.” Draco shrugs. “It wasn’t as if we made a collective decision. People started to leave. Theo went to work for an investment bank in Hong Kong. He was the first to go. He was always close to Blaise and when he went to visit Theo, he came back full of stories of a different world. It showed him there was more to life than Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade and the people who whispered about us wherever we went. He’s fluent in enough languages that he could move to Europe. He ended up taking a job in Milan. I think he spent some time in Spain and Portugal too, and now he’s back in Italy.”
The Slytherin common room was louder than ever as outraged students gossiped about what had happened during the match.
"You are the Potter boy," he said. "You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. My name is Firenze," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.
"This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year," said Fred. "We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us."
"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red- oh..." His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, "You've forgotten something..."
"Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze. "The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times."
Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.
"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the-- wait a moment-- was that the Snitch?!"
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"
"We've got the invisibility cloak," said Harry slowly. "It shouldn't be too difficult- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert."
