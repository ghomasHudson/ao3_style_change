“I bet I would have done better than you think Malfoy, the Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin but I asked it not to,” Harry replied quietly. He’d only admitted that to Albus after his son had confessed his fear at being place in the house.
The days and nights began to blur together for Harry, endless piles of paperwork, running back and forth until he could no longer feel his feet and collapsing into bed in the wee hours of the morning. Along with the increased worry over the impending attack on another pure blood family, Harry was concerned with seemingly random attacks on half bloods all over the country.
“Ron, have you seen Malfoy?” Harry asked.
Having an excuse of checking Draco’s wards once a day gave Harry a reason to at least send him a letter to announce himself. Trying to put more into the letters then just when he was apparating over proved more difficult however. Should he ask how Malfoy’s day was? If he needed to make another run to town for deliveries? It all sounded trite and forced. Surely, if Malfoy needed anything like that he would let Harry know. Perhaps he just needed to stop trying so hard.
“What sort of present would make you feel better?”
-Harry
“The all night Fire Whiskey binging or inviting me over so you could get something more than oatmeal for breakfast?” Harry asked.
Hermione passed another plate loaded with food across to her awaiting kids, “definitely could have gone longer without the drinking.”
"Leave it to the Ministry to be as incompetent as ever, four families are dead and you know nothing. Since their attack didn't go as planned should I be on the lookout for a return visit?" Draco scoffed.
Albus looked dubious before taking a deep breath and nodding. Harry nodded back and stood up to steer his son in the direction of the table the rest of their family was impatiently waiting at. Ginny cast them questioning looks but Albus ducked his head behind his menu and Harry mouthed ‘later’ to her before mimicking his son.
“Sorry mate, I haven’t had nearly enough to drink for this discussion. I’ll see you both this Friday for dinner, right?” Harry asked, getting a scowl from Ron at the clear abandonment and a nod from Hermione.
With the forgotten parchment in hand, Harry bid Neville good-bye as the Herbology professor tried to wrangle the Medusa Vine back into place amongst the greenhouse's rafters and joined Draco outside. "Are you alright Malfoy?"
This very same flat was the one he came home to that evening after double-checking the newest set of wards around Malfoy Manor. It was sparsely decorated, as Harry spent very minimal time there. It had a strange combination of both Wizarding and Muggle appliances which always seemed to fascinate Ron whenever he'd stop by. He had a clock very similar to Mrs. Weasley's with hands depicting each of his loved ones and where they currently were. Magical moving pictures in frames were scattered along several surfaces throughout the flat, while the kitchen boasted a dishwasher that was completely muggle and the living room had a television and DVD player. Ginny had always thought his muggle things were strange eccentricities as if he either couldn't let go of his childhood pre-magic or was too lazy to cast a dish cleaning charm after he ate. Harry however felt as though he'd finally found the perfect balance of the two worlds he lived in.
It was almost easy to leave the house he'd lived in for the last 15 years and not look back. The hard part was deciding where to go next, although Ron and Hermione would always welcome him. Their house was quite full and although he still owned Grimmauld Place, it was still too creepy for him to stay very long; especially alone. So Harry had stayed in a hotel while looking for a flat nearer to the ministry.
“Dear Malfoy,
Harry was quite relieved after spending the afternoon talking to Ron, even if it meant the paperwork on his desk had quadrupled. Several times Harry was tempted to tell Ron about his discussions with Draco, but in the end resisted, simply telling him of the attack and resulting issues. Ron was predictably unconcerned for Draco’s wellbeing but refrained from any name-calling.
Harry could practically feel the eye roll from Hermione accompanying her message and groaned at the obviousness. Unfortunately, soup was hardly going to help and if Draco wanted soup he had a house elf for that. Not to mention Draco may question the safety of anything coming from him in food form; honestly too risky.
"Several are going to Madam Pomfrey at Hogwarts. General things really, mostly bases for more complex potions that require special herbs that are grown in their greenhouses or restricted ingredients that are locked up in the Potion Master's storeroom for lessons. After that I have a few customers in Diagon Alley," Draco replied, stepping up to his fireplace and grabbing a handful of Floo Powder.
Albus and Scorpius turned to their father’s and gave them hugs, Scorpius looking a bit more worn around the edges as Albus hauled him away. Moments later the two boys stared from a carriage window, waving manically at them as the train began to pull away. Harry could swear he saw a tear trace down Scorpius’ cheek just before they were too far away to see and he turned worriedly to Draco.
“It’s alright, just take your time, keep breathing,” Harry murmured softly, rubbing gentle circles on Draco’s back.
“Well, now we don’t have to worry about all that anymore. There are no Hogwarts houses to separate us, no Quiddich matches to fight over and nobody left to impress,” Harry said with a slight smile.
Neville chuckled at Draco's antics. "Don't worry Draco, that's only a Medusa Vine, I think it likes bright things."
Realizing the afternoon was nearly gone, Harry slid from the stool he'd been occupying and wandered closer to where the two were taking notes. Coming up behind Draco, Harry's eyes grew wide and he quickly bit his lip to stifle the burst of laughter that was threatening to explode from him. The Medusa Vine very obviously was not put off from Draco's earlier avoidance and had quite literally taken root in the man's blonde locks at the back of his head. It had started at the very bottom and slowly crept up each pale strand, weaving through and around them in the most intricate knots Harry had ever seen. The tendrils had continued up to the base of Draco's skull and were now inching their way around his head creating a living green crown.
Before clarification on the issue could be resolved several people suddenly appeared through their Floo in their adjoining living room. Molly Weasley was first to step out, followed by Ginny, James, Albus and Lily who looked equally surprised to see Harry, Ron and Hermione crowded around the kitchen island as they were standing in the living room. Molly was first to break the stupor, bustling over to greet everyone and give hugs while the rest mimicked her.
Harry took a moment to word his response; worried that Hermione thought he’d become obsessive over Malfoy like he’d been accused of during their days at Hogwarts. “I know you meant well when you stepped in to help Hermione, and I do appreciate the help, but I wish you’d talk to me more before you start ordering everyone around; especially me. I’m sorry if it seemed like I wasn’t concerned with my other work after Malfoy was attacked, but it was our first break in the attackers current pattern and I was really hoping it would mean we were close to catching them.”
“It’s blood weird seeing the two of them together like that,” Ron said in bewilderment.
“They’ve got a lot going on right now and I don’t want to bother them. Honestly the reply was plenty, and they seemed to enjoy the book, even offered for me to borrow it,” Harry said, giving her a reassuring smile and tucking into his Shepard’s Pie. He still wasn’t sure what Hermione would think about him getting so personally involved with Draco. His wards were still around the manor, being checked weekly and until the attackers were caught, Harry couldn’t be sure it was safe.
Harry looked incredulous, “you got railroaded by a child?’
"Potter, I have several potions that need to be delivered today. If you wish to accompany me, meet me at the manor at noon."
"And if we have Aurors surrounding the place all the time we may never catch them before they move on again. If it takes them nearly a month to resupply themselves, and they weren't able to get through Malfoy Manor's wards the first time, they'll likely take even more time and come back more heavily armed, perhaps even use magic that we can trace," Hermione explained.
-Harry
With full stomachs, the kitchen magiked to clean itself and the children off to bed, Harry, Ron and Hermione headed into the living room to relax with a bottle of Fire Whiskey.
“Of course I could have, but Scorpius insisted he wanted to come, saying it wouldn’t be the same if he missed out and everyone else was going to be here,” Draco replied.
After Harry had promised himself to leave Draco well enough alone, he made sure only to send a nightly message of when he had planned to check the manor’s wards and made sure to keep his invisibility cloak on the entire time. Every few evenings he was sure he detected some minor disturbances, but except for more frequent checks there was nothing Harry could do. When he mentioned it to Hermione she assured him that of course Malfoy’s safety was important but she refused to allow him more Aurours for round the clock surveillance again. He knew they were stretched incredibly thing as it was, trying to cover all their targets plus keep enough man power available for any other catastrophes that cropped up but he felt like one more person wasn’t really too much to ask for.
“Dad, Uncle Fred gave us all these gummies for free, they make your tongue grow fur!” Albus exclaimed excitedly.
“Harry, your job isn’t to protect Malfoy, you’re not a bodyguard. As for his reputation, you all ready stood up and told the entire Wizengamot your opinions but most people need to have someone to blame for their pain and he’s an easy scapegoat. I know it’s not fair, and Malfoy doesn’t deserve their hatred, but the more attention you call to it the more people are going to react. I seriously doubt his family wants to see his picture splashed across the papers because you caused a major scene trying to defend him against aged old witches and wizards who lost their loved ones to Voldemort and his Death Eaters,” Hermione reasoned.
Draco’s eyes widened, his jaw going slack. “You would have tried to help me against The Dark Lord? After everything I’d done to you and your friends?”
“You went to all that trouble and then never checked in again?” Hermione asked, completely dumbfounded.
“No, Astoria’s parents know what they’ve read in the papers but we’ve agreed it’s not good for her to know and there’s no reason to frighten Scorpius with any of it,” Draco replied.
“Not yet, but soon. She had a maladictus, a blood curse that no doctor in the entire world can cure. Since coming back from holiday she’s been weaker, barely able to leave her bed. The doctors that have been to see her say she’s in the final stages,” Draco explained, his voice emotionless and flat with exhaustion.
Harry took a deep breath and slowly let it out, resisting Malfoy's usual catty banter. "I'm afraid the attack on your house this morning was the fifth of its kind over the last several months. Every attack has been on a pureblood family that had sided with Voldemort during the uprising. So far you're the only one to have survived Malfoy."
“So just because the tell her to, Granger is going to try running every aspect of The Ministry? How’s that going for her?” Draco asked with a roll of his eyes.
“I heard Snape say something similar to Dumbledore one time, that he couldn’t just pretend, he had to be mindlessly committed like Belatrix and Pettigrew or he’d be found out. He had to do whatever it took to convince Voldemort, there was no limit to his madness,” Harry said, feeling a heaviness fill his chest at the topic.
"Your wife or son wouldn't have told anyone?" Harry asked.
Harry's silent grin was no help and Neville soon realized he wasn't even looking at him but rather across the table. Turning his head, Neville's eyes shot wide in surprise as he saw the source of his friend's mirth.
The dwarf snorted but held out one hand with money while the other snatched the vials. "Same time next month?"
“You seem to have trouble keeping this one from running away Potter,” Draco smirked over the boys’ heads.
“Come on Harry, we passed notes back and forth all afternoon like grade schoolers. You were asking what sort of get well gift to get them, remember?” Hermione replied.
Harry figured that made sense, he loved lavishing the Weasleys with gifts come the holidays but knew they felt bad not being able to return the sort of quality, even if he never asked it of them. He needed to figure out something more personal then for Draco, but what fo you get for someone who can buy anything they want already?
"You have some interesting customers. He was the last for today?" Harry asked.
“Dad, I’m gonna go help Scorpius find his books, be right back,” Albus interjected, giving Harry a quick smile before tugging the youngest Malfoy into the crowd.
“Why? What good would it do you?” Draco asked skeptically.
"There have been six attacks now, let's not spread our resources too thin, we need to be concentrating on who is doing this. I've had non-stop owls coming in from pureblood families demanding to know what we're doing to stop these attacks. There have been a few accusations that because I'm muggle-born I may not be putting the highest priority on this," Hermione replied with a resigned sigh.
“I never thought to hear you bashing pure bloods Malfoy, where’s your pride?” Harry snickered.
“Seemed like a good idea at the time and I wanted to try repaying the Weasleys for everything they’d done for me,” Harry shrugged.
“This feels really personal still, but I doubt it’s one person working alone and I doubt they’re very involved with the wizarding community because nobody is talking. The pure bloods are just as clueless and even those who work between the wizards and the muggles haven’t heard anything,” Harry said with a sigh.
Harry groaned and pulled himself away. “I do not want to know how or why you know that.”
Draco refused to meet Harry’s eyes, focusing instead on the flames once more leaping in the grandiose fireplace. “My father was willing to give up his former ties to the Dark Lord once he was destroyed, he had my mother and she’d just given birth to me. He believed in keeping magical bloodlines pure but not by destroying all muggles; that’s genocide. But he didn’t have a choice once he was called back, if he didn’t go willingly someone would have come looking and he didn’t want my mother or me involved. Little good that did obviously. My father had to go along with what the Dark Lord wanted, he knew any show of restraint or hesitance would mean our heads on the chopping block.”
"Or they may very well move on and leave me alone. But even after five attacks you still know squat about them or what they'll do. Does that mean you're going to leave me and my family here then, hoping that they won't come back and try again?" Draco asked indignantly.
Harry smiled, he was glad they’d been able to have a somewhat normal conversation, at least for them again. Hopefully he wouldn’t put his foot in his mouth and ruin it before he left, though the temptation to ask about Astoria was now niggling at the back of his mind.
Harry didn’t see Draco much for the next week, his visits in the evenings either extremely late or so brief they merely nodded to each other in passing. He took Draco’s suggestion and began looking into all possible ministry officials who could possibly hold a grudge against former Death Eaters or Voldemort supporters. It was tiresome, lengthy work, which he had to keep completely private. The Wizengamot council members were always thought to be above reproach, thoroughly vetted before they were assigned to their posts. They were backed by the entire Ministry and the wizarding community and were supposed to be completely impartial in order to oversee trials and convict the guilty. It was not advisably to go against them whatsoever, and what Harry was doing was akin to treason.
From one store to another the group steadily worked through the entire supply list, even stopping at Draco’s preferred high end potions shop to pick up a few ingredients he needed. The children finally dragged them into the Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes Joke Shop much to Draco’s dismay.
“What’s the best thing to send someone who’s not feeling well?”
“Please, he wouldn’t have lasted one day in Slytherin,” Draco replied dryly.
"Please don't move Draco, the Medusa Vine has gotten wrapped in your hair. You'll shred it if you go any further," Neville explained.
"I also want at least one Auror on the Malfoy's at all times, I'm sure we can spare at least a single person, maybe one of the new recruits," he suggested.
“Well, unless I’m stuck in the basement trying to brew something, I have nothing but time, however since my restrictions allow minimal travel and I refuse to skulk around The Ministry, if you want to visit you’ll have to come here Potter. But do send a request first, both Astoria and Scorpius will be home soon and I won’t have you popping in and out at all hours disturbing us,” Draco said with a sniff.
Draco snorted with a grin, “would have been much more satisfying to completely corrupt the Wizarding World’s Savior. Can you imagine, The Golden Boy, sorted into Slytherin and friends of Death Eater Lucius Malfoy’s son? The papers would have had a field day.”
“It’s a good thing Astoria and Scorpius had some time together this summer. I bet they really enjoyed it,” Harry commented, trying to lighten the oppressive air.
“And it could be Harry, but we can’t just ignore these cases, they’re killing innocent people,” Hermione replied.
Harry knelt between the two boys, oohing and ahhing over each item they showed him. Casting quick glances over at Draco and Scorpius showed the two examining the items, eyes bright with soft smiles.
With a wave of his hand he dismissed the elf and considered the package. It was well wrapped, but not flashy, obviously not done by Potter. It wasn’t a large package, nor was it heavy and the note attached was rather curious. Carefully slipping the ribbon off the edges, Draco un-taped it and looked at the rather thick book in his hands. The note now made much more sense and a small smirk crossed his face.
Draco wrinkled his nose, "What could he possibly be using Fanged Geraniums for? They're just a useless houseplant."
“And what if he leaves the manor Hermione? He had a mob following him down the street yelling insults at him only a few weeks ago. If they’d pulled their wands he could have been hurt, or worse,” Harry argued, his voice rising slightly.
“Actually, Ron got a call from work and had to go in for awhile. I was just finishing making dinner, are you hungry?” Hermione said, heading back into the kitchen.
The streets and stores were full to bursting as they always were the week before the school term began and Ron suggested that they split up in oder to get all the necessary supplies. The girls, Molly, Hermione, Ginny, Rose and Lily trooped off together while Harry, Ron, Hugo, James and Albus went another way, all agreeing to meet up later for lunch.
Harry reached over and laid a hand overtop hers that was squeezing the pen so tightly it was threatening to snap. “I know it doesn’t make this easier Hermione, but we are narrowing it down. We’re getting closer to the real reason behind this, which will make catching them easier.”
“You do have a hero complex Potter. I don’t think I could do it. I don’t actually like fighting, but if someone challenges me I don’t want to be seen as weak or helpless,” Draco replied.
Draco didn’t speak for a long time, just stared quietly at Harry. “I’m surprised after everything, you don’t agree with them. You know more of what really happened then anyone. You know I took The Mark, that the Dark Lord wanted me to kill Dumbledore. Why did you bother standing up for me during the trials? Why are you here, now?”
Draco shook his head before leaning back against the couch cushions, his body going lax as his eyes slipped closed. “I’m not going anywhere Potter, there’s no need to worry about me collapsing again.”
Ron was turning scarlet trying not to be baited into the disturbing turn the conversation had taken while Harry was quickly backing out of the room in mock horror.
Ron’s eyes scanned the crowd. “He was right behind you when you came in, yeah?”
"Thank you, Harry, I'm sorry my contact wasn't more helpful. Hopefully, now I can keep a lid on the attack on Malfoy Manor. Since Malfoy isn't talking to anyone and the house is still standing nobody is exactly sure what happened and are only guessing that it may have connections to the recent bombings. I can not have reporters camped outside Malfoy's front lawn if we hope to catch these guys," Hermione replied.
Draco gave a small nod, wrapping his hands around the teacup after setting the saucer on the coffee table and staring into the liquid as though it held all of life’s answers. Harry briefly wondered if Draco had learned the art of tea leaf divination in any of Trelawney’s classes but thought better than to ask. Most likely their opinion on the woman was probably quite similar.
"I've already got Aurors going through all the evidence from every explosion looking for any similar parts and I'm going to start pulling records of any abandoned houses being blown up recently since the end of the wars," Harry assured her.
“Why do you even care Potter? You’re savior complex over riding your good sense again? There is nothing for you to fix and nobody to save,” Draco replied sternly, striding once more towards the house.
“Malfoy,
"I can't tell Malfoy we're setting him up Hermione, so what am I supposed to do in the meantime?" Harry asked in frustration.
As Hermione served them both up she noticed the slump of Harry’s shoulders, the downcast tilt to his eyes and how his entire body was practically screaming ‘not happy!’
"Neville, you said your Medusa Vine liked bright things, right?" Harry interrupted, trying not to choke on his laughter.
Draco didn’t look impressed. “How could you tell when Lovegood stopped spouting her gibberish long enough to say something that may be meaningful? If I was to have taken her seriously, my entire future had already been predicted in the Quibbler.”
"Well I'm certainly not going to stay here and be publicly humiliated by them," Draco sneered, stalking away from the crowd.
"Neville, good to see you again," Harry greeted as they walked into the greenhouse that now resembled something akin to a well organized jungle.
“Bloody hell, the two of you teaming up would have razed the entire school to the ground,” Ron replied, a look of utter horror on his face at the thought. Harry and Draco exchanged glances, bemused looks on both their faces.
“Of course not Harry, I always cook enough for leftovers and I’m glad of the company; it’s far too quiet all alone in the house,” Hermione laughed.
Draco collapsed down onto the couch and shot Harry a weary look. “How do you do it Potter? How do you stay so bloody optimistic even when you know there’s no hope you’ll win?”
Harry’s brain seemed to come to a screeching halt, he wasn’t sure what he had expected Draco to say; honestly his behavior had baffled him. But his wife dying of an incurable curse made something twist sharply in his gut. Harry couldn’t imagine if it were Ginny or even Hermione, after everyone else he’d already lost; it would be just too much.
“Or it could be the next part of their plan, they took out the pure blood wizarding families and now they’re after the half bloods who practice magic as well. Whoever they are it seems like they hate magic as much as those who have it,” Hermione added.
Hours later with a half eaten sandwich that lay forgotten on the coffee table, Draco felt exhaustion drag at his eyelids. Glancing at the clock proved it to be nearly midnight and he swore quietly under his breath. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d let himself get that absorbed in a book, let alone one on Quiddich. It had been years since he’d even kept up on who was playing, or played himself. Draco supposed if things had gone differently at the end of his time at Hogwarts he may have considered a career as a professional Quiddich Seeker, but as things were there just wasn’t any call for an ex-Death Eater.
“You’re right Ron, I’ve been trying to keep work at work but every time I try to talk to her she’s sending me off on another errand or reassigning more of my Aurors and I can barely keep up with anything anymore,” Harry sighed in defeat.
"Hermione, you can't just go over my head and start reappointing my staff however you see fit. I was expecting to have a guard around Malfoy Manor and instead find out that in their absence someone was there today," Harry fumed.
“Well, I can’t say it’s been quiet unfortunately. I have a strong feeling that since they couldn’t get to Malfoy they tried moving on to their other Death Eater targets only to find them heavily guarded, so they moved on to pure blood supporters. We’ve had four smaller attacks on business’ and homes where the people were half bloods who only married pure bloods or worked with them and were trying to up their blood status. It’s seemed rather random if you’re only reading the papers, they’re saying these attacks are due to copycats but the pure bloods are a small tight knit community, they know everyone and anyone who wants to be one. Thankfully they’re so scared right now so they’re not talking to the papers, they don’t want to draw any attention to themselves,” Hermione answered.
The food was delicious, as always, Hermione really had come far from their year camping out while hunting Horcruxes. As the food warmed his stomach he began to relax a bit, and his brain started to pick over his conversation with Draco again.
“She’s always been an overachiever Malfoy. Anything less then perfection is simply not allowed in any aspect of her life,” Harry smirked.
-Harry
Draco barely managed to keep the scowl off his face, “fine.”
Dinner was indeed delicious as Ron’s cooking was now nearly comparable to his mum’s in quality. Hermione had tried her best to keep talk of work abscent from the conversation at dinner but found it difficult as it was nearly all consuming for herself and Harry these days and all she could think to talk to him about. Ron, bless his heart was all too ready with a funny, distracting story about his work, what crazy concoctions Fred and Lee Jordan were attempting and whether or not his brother’s suspicious disappearances mid afternoon had anything to do with Angelina’s sudden random visits. Harry was glad for the diversion and a reason to laugh until his jaw ached.
Somehow the entire bottle of Fire Whiskey managed to get emptied between the three of them and Harry fell into a heavy, half drunk slumber on their couch that night. Hermione couldn’t remember even leaving the living room, but was pretty sure Ron had gotten her to bed at some point since it was a total blank to her. Ron simply chuckled at the two the next morning as Hermione nursed a very strong cup of coffee while Harry expertly put together an English breakfast that would have made his mum proud.
“Are you sure it’s not too much trouble?” Harry worried.
“Someone who made really bad choices when they were younger. Someone who had to hurt people in order to stay alive,” Harry answered.
H. Potter”
“I’d already met him Malfoy, I’d seen him kill complete innocents just because they saw him. I didn’t want anyone else having to go through that. I knew your father was probably pushing you to obey but I hoped Dumbledore could do something to get you out of that situation. Then later on, I figured you had made your choice, that you’d taken The Mark because it was what you wanted. That you truly believed all the vile things your father and Voldemort were saying,” Harry admitted.
“Bloody hell, Harry we’re late for lunch!” Ron suddenly cried, catching site of the giant clock at the top of the Gringott’s Bank. Everyone’s eyes flew upwards, mixed gasps and exclamations’ coming out in response.
Harry took a deep breath, trying not to let himself get riled. “The war was a long time ago Malfoy and you aren’t your father. You didn’t do any of those things that old man accused you of.”
Up ahead Harry could see the tension coiling in the back of Draco, how his right hand opened and closed spastically as if he'd like to take a swing at the man. For a moment he was actually glad Draco didn't have his wand, though the man did seem on the verge of a well deserving hex. Harry continued to keep a watchful eye on the crowd as Draco led them down a dim alley. As soon as they were out of eyesight most of the onlookers broke off and went about their business, and eventually several of the people from the store the elderly man had come from managed to herd him back inside.
"And Malfoy so far has been the only survivor, which could mean he's still a target," Hermione mused thoughtfully.
“Or I suppose I could have corrupted you, brought Voldemort’s number one Death Eater’s son over to the good side. Had you join Dumbledore’s army and fight for us,” Harry smirked.
"I told you not to show your face around here again! We don't want your kind here, you Death Eater!" the old man yelled, spittle flying from his mouth as he shook his fist at Draco.
"How did you start making potions for Madam Pomfry? Didn't Professor Snape do that before?" Harry asked.
Harry watched satisfied as Hermione made a few more notes to her napkins before tucking back into her own forgotten meal. Although it wasn’t quite the break through everyone was hoping for, they’d exhausted all their other leads and had felt uselessly futile at keeping anyone else safe lately while more people died and the local wizarding community demanded action. He wondered briefly if he should tell Draco, but he wasn’t sure whether or not the man cared anymore. Draco certainly had larger, more pressing concerns at the moment.
“I went through every record possible, even dug up information on their family’s and past members but with the exception of Barty Crouch Sr. and his son there’s almost nothing to find. Most of them are true, loyal pure bloods who would as soon attack one of their own as themselves,” Harry explained.
The sound of a pop cracked in the room and Ron suddenly apparated, looking a bit puzzled at the scene in front of him. “What’s all this then?”
“All right, I promise Malfoy. Shouldn’t Astoria be in a hospital? The manor could be attacked again,” Harry asked, hating his impulsive need to bring it up again.
“Quiddich Teams From Around The World and a golden Snitch bookmark to match”
"I got held up with some of my earlier deliveries, my apologies. I brought double your usual order this time; no extra cost," Draco explained, pulling out six vials.
“Still no progress then Potter?” Draco asked, seeking Harry out that evening as he checked the wards.
“Been awhile since we’ve done this, eh?” Ron said, as their kids eagerly crowded around the kitchen island for Uncle Harry’s breakfast.
"Muggles are definitely skilled in killing each other in the most heinous ways possible but why would they come after the Dark Lord's supporters? Most of the families who were involved are either in prison or in hiding. How do they even know about us?" Draco asked.
“If you could play Seeker for any team, who would it be?”
"No really Draco, I promise I'd never plant anything dangerous. I'd never forgive myself if anyone got hurt," Neville croaked.
“For the most part she’s kept out of the Auror’s business, let me run things as I see fit; so long as I keep up on my reports. But some of the pure blood families are accusing her of siding with the muggles instead of trying to catch the attackers,” Harry explained.
“Saw this and thought of you”
A pale-skinned, blonde-haired man paced irritably between the table and roaring fireplace, his hands scrubbing at his face before whirling towards a female Aurour with a loud and curt reply.
“Was wondering if I should tell Malfoy,” Harry muttered distractedly.
Hi all, I hope someone out there is still reading this and enjoying it. Let me know by leaving me a quick comment. I've got several chapters to post and the updates should keep coming regularly, so subscribe so you don't miss anything.
Harry nodded and slid an arm under Draco’s shoulder, slowly lifting him upright into a sitting position. Draco sagged heavily against his arm, his head dropping forward as though he had no muscles to help keep him up.
Hermione set her fork down, trying to process the strange question. “Change how exactly?”
"I've had mandatory gag orders placed on every newspaper since the first attack, but word and rumors are still flying faster then I can keep up with. I'm still curious how they're finding all the families who've been in isolation since the wars. We didn't even know where Jugson had gone to, let alone that he and his family were so close. So, the guards can keep an eye out on Malfoy Manor for a few days but after that I want all the Aurors tracking down every possible target, their friends, cousins, or known associates so maybe we can stop this before it happens again," Hermione said.
Draco jerked away, his eyes hardening, as his nostrils flared, “it’s none of your business Potter. Scorpius and I will be fine, so for once in your life, leave it alone.”
"That would take a majority vote of the Wizengamot to reverse, which would take too much time and be too public. Whoever is orchestrating these attacks would find out and track Malfoy and his family down," Hermione said.
"Yes Mr. Potter but this afternoon we all got new orders. I thought you knew sir," Diggle stammered.
-Harry
The response came in short order, though it was not what Harry expected.
“It may be a diversion to throw us off since we’ve got so many of the possible targets under constant surveillance,” Harry suggested.
“Any changes?” Harry asked as the apparated just outside the rear lawn.
Draco stopped walking and stared at Harry. "Surprise? That's it, just surprise Potter? Wouldn't you be shocked, outraged that the head of Hogwarts would dare put your children in the same room as me?"
“Golden Boy,” Draco muttered under his breath as the two waded further into the shop.
“So it has happened before then. Have they threatened you?” Harry asked.
Harry tried not to laugh at the haughty attitude Draco was trying to display as if he were doing Harry a great favor of some sort. “I promise Malfoy, no unannounced visits, though if you need something my door at the ministry is always open and they know how to reach me no matter where I am.”
“It’s wasn’t your fault Potter, no need to apologize,” Draco replied tiredly, causing Harry to pause in his flight from the room.
"I've been appointed liaison between the Aurors who are chasing down the last of the Dark Lord's supporters and Death Eaters and the Minister herself. I'm to keep a log of everyone they find and report directly to her," Diggle explained, his voice petering out as he quickly realized he was now in the line of fire between Head Auror Harry Potter and the Minister of Magic Hermione Granger.
“Not in finding out who’s behind the attacks unfortunately. We have a pretty solid list of any possible targets though. Hermione’s hopeful that if we keep an eye on them we may be able to catch them before any more damage is done,” Harry replied.

“Everyone’s already against the Slytherin house. We don’t have to be against each other,” he said, swiping Draco’s essay from beneath his quill. “It’d be worth it to talk befriend the Slytherins, then, and not just stick with your two lackeys.”
“Can you do better?” Ron asked, sounding a reasonable mix of awkward and casual.
“But you didn’t because I was the only one who thought to bring money!”
“They don’t know either.”
They sat down, leaving a chair in between them, and Potter poured the buttons and needles gently onto the table. Then he started picking up the buttons and putting them back in the box.
Draco looked at his slimy hands in disgust before disappearing the remains of meat and juices. He turned to Potter and did the same. “What was that for?”
“Right, it’s getting dark,” Draco said, despite it being noon.
He heard voices inside of Lupin’s classroom. Draco stopped and looked around the hallway. There was no sign of Potter, despite their detention starting now. Cautiously, Draco pressed his ear against the door. He could hear Lupin talking.
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, we definitely do those things. But… Something is off. It’s my father’s fault. Everything he did when he was younger and-”
The fight Ron and Hermione had wasn’t massive in volume or length, but in the effect it was monumental. They hadn’t spoken in two weeks. Harry was in a bit of a crossroads, given he very much agreed that Crookshanks had it out for Scabbers. However, he didn’t have the heart to tell Ron that Scabbers had likely lived well past his natural lifespan. The best he could do is not give as cold a shoulder to Hermione, who was content to focus on the hours worth of homework she had.
Draco slipped his hands under Harry’s shirt and Harry yelped and fell back. “Your hands are freezing, you prat!”
“I know. He should. But you haven’t been a saint in the past, and they both have a bit of pent up anger,” Harry said, grabbing one of Draco’s hands. “It’s not your fault, and they don’t know that you and your dad are separate people, yet.”
“He can make it work. I’ll get Crabbe and Goyle out of the room and we can meet there,” Draco replied. Nine?”
He looked outside. It was a rare sunny day despite the frigid temperature, and he had a feeling Hermione would bring them outside so she could study in the pleasant weather. And he could guess they were still curious as to why he had gotten back so early and why he didn't want to talk about anything that happened.
Still holding his right hand, Draco leaned back in his chair and kicked one leg up over the other. Potter was slumped so far back in his seat that he was a few inches shorter than Draco. He was tempted to say something, but wasn’t sure how willing he was to push his luck. Snape was sure to get him out of trouble; he was willing to bet that he’d get away with a day of detention, two days at most.
“Yeah. Don’t worry about it. I guess I am doing an awful job at this.”
Hermione took Ron’s arm. “Yes, let’s leave Harry alone with… Well, come on.” Harry watched as Hermione dragged Ron away.
“The Weasley twins, the Beaters.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Obviously!” He grabbed Harry’s wrist and dragged him to the witch statue, leaving Harry lost in a daze of physical contact. He opened the passage and went in first, Draco close behind him, his breath on Harry’s neck. He felt like he was going insane.
With that not exactly comfortable thought, he drifted off into an uneasy sleep.
“Sure. Me, Ron, and Hermione all can fit under without our feet showing.”
“I go to the classroom, and then I’m done,” Hermione replied. Harry got the hint and didn’t push it.
For their part, they handled it well. Hermione seemed more put off than Ron, which Harry was not expecting (though if you asked him why, he wouldn’t be able to explain it). “Hermione, what’s your problem?” Ron asked, surprisingly defensive.
“And that’s a penalty for both sides,” Lee Jordan continued. “Spinnet goes for Gryffindor first.”
The weather was perfect. The wind wasn’t too strong and the sun not too bright, allowing for fantastic visibility and flying conditions. Draco continued to follow Harry, and Harry found his attention split between the pitch and his boyfriend. Draco was significantly smaller than the last seeker, but the uniform had been shrunk to fit him handsomely. Green had always complimented him well, and the few blonde hairs that were out of place added a handsome, almost playful feeling.
Harry had the idea that they were probably going to agree to something incredibly stupid. “Yes. And?”
Next was Pansy. The puppy turned into a beautiful woman with impossibly blonde hair, shimmering skin, soft red lips, long lashes, and curves in all the right placed. He heard Crabbe and Goyle gulp behind him. The woman came closer to Pansy, grinning and holding out her arms, but the closer she came the more Draco saw that her teeth were sharp and her hands were clawed. With a steely voice, Pansy said, “Riddikulus,” and the woman’s dress ripped, exposing her bra. The class roared in laughter, and Draco caught Pansy blushing as she moved to the side for his turn.
“Professor Hagrid,” Pansy began, looking as though she was trying not to show she had just stepped in raw sewage. Hagrid’s face screwed up in confusion and hurt. “My friends and I would like to personally appeal to the Minister in defense of your Hippogriff.”
They lifted into the sky, and Harry relished how smoothly the Firebolt responded to his movements. He knew after their last practices that his team would excel. Oliver was performing better than he ever had, and Angelina, Katie, and Alicia had them up to an 80 point lead.
“Fine,” Harry lied. Draco didn’t pick up on it, or if he did he didn’t ask.
The crowd erupted in anger as two bludgers were hit directly at Oliver, who nearly fell of the broom. “It seems that Slytherin has no qualms about playing dirty today, as they seemed to have realized they have no skill otherwise,” Lee Jordan said, McGonagall clearly protesting in the background. “Johnson scores the penalty!” Draco scowled. “And Spinnet recovers quickly and scores again!”
“Fine,” Harry lied. “I’m tired though. I think I’m turning in for the night.”
“What are you doing?” Harry asked.
Draco turned red. “Harry.” Pansy and Blaise glanced at each other, blank faced. Draco coughed and focused back on Ron. “What happened last night?”
O fuck y'all. So basically whenever I get an email about kudos on this story I'm like "??" but I get so happy that you guys like it. Leave a comment babes, I'd love to hear what you think. Until next time~
(See the end of the chapter for
Filch walked Potter and him down to Hagrid’s hut, grumbling the whole way to remind them how worthless he found them. The giant oaf- though, if he was going to be good on his promise to Potter, he might as well extend polite thoughts toward his favorite professor- opened the door and grinned.
“Well, his dad’s a prick.”
“Professor!” Granger interjected. McGonagall turned to face her, fury in her eyes, and Granger, taken aback, said, “Ron was trying to pull Crabbe and Goyle off of Harry. He wasn’t trying to hurt anyone.”
Draco shifted a bit and raised his chin. “I’m glad Weasley saw Sirius Black.”
“I’m not asking you to go easy on me, because that would be like saying you’re better than me, which I’m not saying, but would it be so awful to make sure your boyfriend wins a match?” Draco, of course, knew that was out of the question, not only because Ron had placed a bet, but because of Harry’s competitive nature.
Pansy stood up and came over to him to gently pet his hair. “It’ll be okay. It might go away now that you can talk about it.”
Lupin turned to look at Potter, who was looking down at the ground with a slight blush on his face. “Hey,” he muttered.
Draco put his hands to his temples. “That's a Grim, you idiot. It's serious stuff. Aren't you at least a little concerned since Sirius Black is trying to kill you?”
Yes, he wanted Ron, Hermione, and Draco to get along. He was certain they would if Draco continued to be real instead of aloof.
Harry was grateful to hide under the invisibility cloak until they were back in the tunnel. “So. Biting, huh?” Draco asked.
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“Calm down,” Harry said, placing a hand on his shoulder in his best attempt of comfort.
“Take me to dinner first, Potter.”
“Don’t leave all of it for me.”
Draco looked at Harry for permission, who responded with a look that hopefully conveyed
“I don't want to bug him, actually, but the Grim is real! You can go from thinking magic is fake to accepting it in a heartbeat but the weird stuff that comes with it is too much?”
Gryffindor tower partied well into the night until Percy told everyone he had NEWTS to study for. Sent back to their rooms, Ron found some blood and rat hair on his bed, Scabbers nowhere to be found.
“Nothing,” he replied. “Draco feels bad.”
Part of Draco wanted to bite back. However, he replied honestly. “I had to wake up early this morning. Four in the morning early.”
Draco returned to the common room in a much more annoyed mood than when he left. Pansy hadn’t returned and he tried to focus again on his homework. Their detention would be with Hagrid tonight, and Draco was not looking forward to his return to the Forbidden Forest. If it wasn’t for how embarrassing the situation was, he would’ve written his father about the excessive punishments used by the school.
“We can?”
“We certainly will, Miss Granger,” McGonagall said, and she went outside the common room to speak with the portrait, Ron directly behind her and everyone else standing as close to the entrance as possible. “Sir Cadogan, did you let Sirius Black into the common room.”
“How big is the invisibility cloak?” Pansy asked.
“Please don't go out again, Harry,” Hermione said, turning her page. Harry simply grinned at Ron.
“They aren’t too happy it’s you, but it could be worse.” He nodded. “They won’t say anything. Even if they wanted to, they wouldn’t do that to me.”
Harry followed Draco to the Quidditch pitch, the grounds empty as everyone spent the crisp morning in the Great Hall. The locker rooms were no good, as eventually a team would come in, and the field would soon be crowded. But the rafters beneath the bleachers were a good spot to hide, and Harry pulled back some of the fabric to let Draco in first.
“No. I just told my parents I wanted to stay caught up in my classes. Besides, Pansy is stuck here.”
“I’m going to have some fun.” He straightened his robes and ran a hand through his hair, making sure it was neat, as Crabbe and Goyle stood up.
Draco paled. “Right. I’ll meet up with you guys later then?”
“Greengrass.” Daphne looked up. “Do you know where Pansy is?”
“What’s the matter?” He was sitting with Draco, in one of their private corners. He wasn’t there, and he knew Draco would notice it. In his head, all he could think about was Sirius Black, and how he betrayed his best friends. It was tearing him apart; he was angry all the time.
“And one more detention.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’ll do the buttons, thank you very much,” Draco said, grabbing some of the buttons. “I don’t trust you enough to not squash them.”
“That sucks. Professor Snape couldn’t get you out of it?”
“Gryffindor starts with the Quaffle, Johnson to Bell, then Bell to Spinnet, and back to Johnson, who scores early!” The applause was deafening, and the score was 10-0 Gryffindor. As Lee Jordan continued narrating, Harry noticed Draco was trailing not too far behind him.
“Yes, actually,” Harry replied, taking Ron’s bishop and losing a knight.
“We could get butterbeer?”
“Ow.” They turned around, Hermione’s face red, to see Pansy and Blaise approaching them in the flesh. “And here I was all eager to start this group project.” Blaise nodded at them all, and Harry got the feeling that they were all, likely, in over their heads.
“Just walking around.”
“Okay, fine, jeez.” Draco picked up the box and looked away. “I’m sorry, okay? I am. It’ll stop today.”
“Doubt I’d be allowed to roam around free if I was.”
He was puffed up, angry and passionate. And so close. Harry reached out and grabbed his face. Immediately Draco was sated. “What-”
“I’m proud I live in a manor, thank you very much.”
Harry nodded. If not Quidditch, then maybe… Draco? The Hogsmeade trip? Certainly that was more exhilarating than his first time flying.
Automatically, Draco looked to Potter, who shrugged and left without a word. Draco swallowed and said, “What’s the matter, Professor?”
“Exactly! Wait, why wouldn’t I?”
Before Hagrid could respond a vase near the window shattered. Pansy jumped, and many things happened in succession. Ron shouted, “Scabbers!” and the mangy rat ran across the floor. Ron dove, Fang barked, Hermione shouted, “I knew Crookshanks would never!”
Ron turned to Harry for confirmation. “I’m not really the best judge. The Dursley’s hate everyone.”
“Oh. I’m sorry.”
“I could’ve bought food.”
Now Weasley jumped up, and another tall redhead made an appearance. “What’s going on?” The Head Boy grabbed his brother and pulled him back down. “You three, go back to the Slytherin table.”
Draco sat next to Potter and took the box of buttons. “I can handle a few beetles, you know,” Potter said.
“They can?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Shut up,” Harry said, punching him lightly in the gut. Draco cuffed his shoulder and they both erupted into laughter as Harry fake kicked at Draco’s knees.
He focused his attention once more on the few buttons he had left. Potter had finished the needles and was putting the matchsticks in the box. Finished, Draco picked up the box and brought it up to McGonagall’s desk. “We finished, Professor.”
He pulled apart from Draco. His heart was either beating so fast he couldn’t feel it or had completely stopped. Draco was in shock. Harry was sure he was, too.
“Exactly. Five points to Slytherin. So, how do you think we would go about fighting a boggart if it could take the form of your greatest fear?” He looked to the rest of the class expectantly. Tentatively, Daphne raised her hand, and he said, “Yes, Ms. Greengrass?”
Potter huffed, looked up, and said, “I’ll help.”
“And you weren’t caught?”
Ron groaned. “Mate, you know you’re like a brother to me, and I am completely fine with your choices. But please don’t make me spend any time with Malfoy.”
He knew why she was ignoring him; he wasn’t an idiot. He just didn’t know how he could apologize. Apologizing would mean opening up about his fear, which would mean opening up about everything else he had been feeling. He couldn’t admit he liked Potter to himself, much less anyone else.
“He’s not even talented. If it was Mudblood Granger, at least he’d have a reason to like her.”
“Exactly. Not so special now, Potter. Can’t even walk up and down stairs properly. What an idiot.”
“Crabbe and Goyle are my friends,” Draco huffed, but Blaise didn’t buy it. “Look, I’ll talk to her, okay? But everyone else chose to ignore me just because of my father. Everyone fears the Malfoy name.”
“Bullshit,” she hissed as they heard footsteps down the hall. “I noticed how you used to look at Blaise, and I know how you feel about Potter. If I came out to you, you have to do the same for me.”
Ron snorted. “What’d he say?”
Hagrid’s eyes flickered back and forth before he moved to let them inside his hut. He stopped Harry. “What did you do?”
Draco shoved his face into his pillow. This was awful. He had to get Potter’s stupid face out of his head. His thoughts wandered to Quidditch, which was generally a horrible experience thanks to the crippling feelings of self-doubt that came from losing a game he had been playing since he could ride a broom to a brat who picked it up for the first time but two years prior. But Harry was an athlete by nature; he was lithe and quick and likely somewhat strong, strong enough to make Draco wonder about certain things he would rather not think about.
It was as though they won the Quidditch cup in the Gryffindor common room. Harry managed to slip away from the celebrations and sneak down to one of the spots he and Draco met up at. Sure enough, he was waiting.
“Well, make sure they know we are.” He glared at Harry with no malice, and Harry couldn’t stop him as he went back to Hogwarts.
“Who?”
Draco glared and stepped toward Harry, who took a step back so his back was pressed against a tree. “Listen, I might not be some selfless hero like you, but I’m certainly not evil and maybe I don't want to see you fucking dead!”
They parted ways without a word. Draco had assumed the truce would be for the duration of the detentions. Still, a small part of him was disappointed. Whatever. It wasn’t as if they’d come out of these detentions as friends.
“Those don’t count,” Draco blushed.
Harry rolled his eyes. “It's not the Grim,” he replied, breaking their argument up before it could go on any longer. “I'm behind on homework and Oliver is insane. Is that enough?”
They weren't the only students enjoying the weather. Some first years were playing games while older students simply walked alongside the lake. Harry looked around at everyone around them and spotted white blonde hair. There was no way Draco had always been this present and Harry was only noticing now, as he always had noticed Draco. He had to be following him.
“Fine. I trust you.” Harry wasn’t quite sure how to explain how hearing that made him feel. Alarmingly, he wanted Draco to trust him. Him conceding this far gave him an electric feeling. He thought about what Hermione said, and he wasn’t so sure he was firm in his choice to not date Draco. More than this could be nice. More than this would mean Draco’s family, though, and the response of their peers. And whether or not Draco could be serious about this.
“Okay. Good.”
“I was hoping I could speak with you about that.” Professor Snape nodded, and they stepped out of the office. “I should hope I can leave you two alone for five minutes.”
“There they are,” Hagrid said, and he tossed a piece of meat into the grass. It hit the ground then was lifted into the air, and bits of it began to disappear.
And there's the second chapter for the day. I hope you guys enjoyed, and I cannot begin to tell you how much I appreciate all the love this has gotten. Whenever I get kudos I get all warm and fuzzy and gay. Stay safe, stay healthy, and I hope to see you all again soon. Until next time~

“We can’t talk about this now. But… Later. We’ll come to the Slytherin common room,” Harry said, flying, as he usually did, by the seat of his pants.
“I like you a lot more than I thought I did.”
He stood up and tried to not noticeably pull his eyes from Potter’s mouth. As he and Snape walked out of McGonagall’s office, he could hear McGonagall resume scolding Potter. “Go see Madame Pomfrey, Draco.”
“Can we talk somewhere private?” Draco looked up from his work to see Pansy.
“Just like your dad, Draco. Too much of a coward to do your own dirty work, so you’re hoping Black does it for you.” It stung, but it was probably fair. He went after Potter’s parents every other week. “At least you’re decent enough to rely on a criminal. You’re dad wasn’t capable enough for something a little girl could do.”
“Right. Well, they gave me a map.” Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out the Marauder's Map. “I solemnly swear I’m up to no good,” he said, ignoring Draco’s odd look and tapping it with his wand. Sure enough, the ink blossomed into a map of Hogwarts. “See? It shows where everyone is.”
“There still are dementors everywhere! How were you going to propose we sneak out?” Draco made a face very much along the lines of I-asked-you-first, and Harry sighed. “Fred and George, you know them right?”
Lifting his head up, he pressed his wand against his ripped essay, said, “Reparo,” and continued writing. He would just see if the House Elves would bring him food back in the common room after his detention.
And he still kissed him.
“I don’t give a shit, Draco.”
“Keep talking,” Draco said.
They walked to the pitch, the cheering more thunderous than ever before. Harry and Draco avoided the others eyes as the teams faced off. Oliver and Flint glared, tried to break each other’s hands, then half-listened as the rules were reiterated.
The mood of the Gryffindor team soured that of the whole house, and Hermione was doing her best to not pay attention to it. Though, as Harry saw the piles of books surrounding her as she did homework, she likely didn’t have the capacity to care about it.
“Yeah.” Draco had almost forgotten about that. Defense Against the Dark Arts had been unusually eventful. “Joint detention or something; we have to serve it together and get along or else we’ll keep getting more.”
In a shaky voice, Draco replied, “What do you care?”
“-and Pansy and Blaise in the Slytherin common room.” Draco took a few steps around, letting go of the map but still looking. “Amazing! It really shows everything!”
Hagrid’s eyes narrowed, but he didn’t mention it further. “You lot shouldn’t be here. Kids shouldn’t watch what’s.... Well.” He trailed off, and his eyes became misty.
“Same way he got out,” Pansy replied. She got up and nudged Draco, not unkindly. “I’m going to find Daphne. I don’t need my quota for stupidity being filled so early in the day.”
“Maybe we should’ve practiced without the boggart, first.”
Hagrid opened the door and Harry, Ron, and Hermione scurried out. “Right, come in, then,” Hagrid said.
“Maybe golden boy could talk the Minister out of it. Right? Because you didn’t get in trouble for underage magic,” Blaise said, a bit clipped in tone.
The Head Weasel explained what happened and Draco pushed himself up and looked around. His hand hurt, his thumb especially, and his ribs hurt from where Potter had punched him. Potter was propped up against the table, a red mark on his cheek and his glasses somewhere on the floor. Granger was pulling up Weasley, who didn’t look hurt, and Crabbe and Goyle got to their feet, also unharmed. Everyone in the Great Hall was looking at them. He could see the other Weasleys standing a ways away, as though prepared to have jumped in, and he could see Pansy and Daphne, standing up to see what trouble Draco had made for himself.
“I’d bet they are,” Harry said. “I told Draco to put his galleons on Ravenclaw.”
Draco stared in detached disgust as Hagrid left them to tend to the invisible creatures. Potter reached into the bucket and threw a piece. “Are you going to help?” he asked.
“Obviously.” Ron sighed. “Let's just go back and wait for him.”
“The map.” Lupin stuck his hand out and Harry gave it to him without a second thought. His mouth fell open. “The Marauder's map… Where did you find this? Filch took this years ago…”
“Did you get detention for fighting Potter?” Blaise asked.
“Because they're gay, idiot!”
It was easier to meet in a quiet corridor with most of the students gone. Draco came to one of their usual spots, near a window in a hallway rarely used. “I figured I’d find you somewhere,” he said.
“Aye, of course!”
“Oh, he’s blushing!” Hermione exclaimed.
He almost asked what Lupin’s boggart was, for he hadn’t seen it in the commotion of his last class, but he stopped himself. “What is it, then?”
“Perhaps you should’ve thought about that before you provoked Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall said, sending him an oddly gentle glare. “You will also be serving these detentions together. Hopefully you’ll learn how to coexist without resorting to violence.”
“Mr. Malfoy, please return to your common room.” Lupin said, looking at him odd.
Draco’s face blanched, and he turned to face Pansy, trying his best to hide any of the obvious fear on his face. He wanted her to start laughing at the absurdity of Draco having any feelings other than loathing for the Gryffindor prat. Instead, her face was still, as if she was trying her best to stay neutral and allow for Draco’s assumptions to bounce right off of her and back to him. “Good night, Pansy,” he said, his voice suddenly dry.
“It’s called being nice.”
“He’s a prat, too,” Ron said.
“Where'd he go?” They both looked around frantically. That was Hermione. As Draco began to look around for a clearer path, Harry was pulling his invisibility cloak out of his pocket. He pulled Draco close to him and threw it over them both, pulling Draco down so they were crouching.
“Put them back in the box before you transfigure them so they don’t escape,” Draco mimicked as childishly as he possibly could. “Some of us aren’t idiots, Potter.”
“Tell me about it,” Draco replied.
Potter climbed down the ladder and said, “I don’t run away from a fight!”
“I didn’t even know we were coming to Hogsmeade until you dragged me here!”
Draco looked down to hide his blush. “Don’t mention it.”
“Dean and Seamus are just as worried about the match. You’d think they’ve been placing bets.”
Once they were out, Draco asked, “What now?”
“Draco?”
“Right.”
Harry was, at the moment, quite the opposite of fine. Once all of the professors left the Three Broomsticks he ran, holding his invisibility cloak closer with the goal of getting to Honeydukes as fast as possible. Sirius Black was his godfather. He was their best friend and he sold them out. It made everything so much worse somehow.
“Nope. McGonagall already assigned the detention by then.”
“I can only care so much about how busy she is,” Ron said. “She insisted she take every class.”
They clinked the bottles together and clinked. It was chilled from the cold air and not nearly as satisfying as the warmth from inside the Three Broomsticks, yet it was the best thing Harry had ever tasted. “Thanks. I’ll pay you back when we get back to Hogwarts.”
“She’s worried about you, but she’s too proud to say it.”
Harry looked at Ron, thought for a moment if he really wanted to say it, then said, “We should all hang out.”
And the screams returned, and Harry was felled instantly. His mother’s voice dragged him down, and he slipped into it, somewhere close to willingly.
“What?”
“Right. I’m sorry, Harry, it’s just-”
Hermione stood up and pulled them both into a hug. “I was right, but you’re forgiven.”
“And then he scoffed at me! Scoffed! Who does he think he is?”
They pulled apart from each other, both bright red and embarrassed to their bones.
“Good night.” He tiptoed into his dorm, where Crabbe, Goyle, Nott, and Blaise all slept. He closed the door as quietly as he could and crawled into his bed, distracted by the concept of having feelings for Potter.
“I didn’t know you were staying over break.” He meant it to come out a little miffed, but he sounded happy. “Did anything happen?”
Pansy shot up and slapped him, and they both froze. The sound seemed deafening, and they held their breath as they expected someone to wake up. But all that happened was Blaise shifting under his blanket, and they both sighed.
Draco rolled his eyes but did scrub harder at the splotches on the tanks. By the time he had finished his first tank, Potter had finished both of his. “A little help?”
“Oh. Okay. So… What exactly?”
The Ravenclaw girl was a pretty girl named Cho Chang. She was an excellent Seeker with a good broom, but so was Harry. And he had the Firebolt.
It was quick. Harry didn't want to say it was too quick for his liking, though that was the case. His mouth was soft and tasted minty.
“You’re uncomfortable.”
Quidditch was miserable, and Harry was beginning to resent even being on the team. Surely anyone with a broom would be better than he was on the school brooms, which moved at clunky, uneven speeds and vibrated uncomfortably at certain heights. This was it. This was his worst moment. Going to practice and trying to catch the snitch only for the broom to revolt entirely. Oliver’s wails in the showers could be heard by all of Gryffindor.
“He was standing over me with a knife! The curtains were slashed and, and I think he thought I was Harry because when I woke up and screamed he was gone! ” Ron said, barely breathing between sentences. All of Gryffindor was awake, and Hermione was next to Ron, holding onto his arm. Harry was somewhere between panic and feeling nothing. Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all wearing varying expressions of morbid excitement.
Draco abruptly stood up, and Goyle asked, “What are you doing?”
“How’d it go?” Draco asked.
Hagrid shook his head and Fang looked nervously up at him before finally sniffing the Slytherins, who couldn’t mask their fear. He grabbed a plate of… dubious baked goods and turned back to them. “Fine. Eat if you’re goin’ to stay.”
“Muggles are weird. It can’t really be a wizard thing. Most people are fine with it.”
Eventually, he got himself out of his bed and joined Ron and Hermione to get breakfast. “What happened last night?” Hermione asked, jumping right into it.
I'm back my friends! I'm starting to think I'll have this finished before college at the rate I'm writing! Hopefully. Fingers crossed y'all. I hope you guys enjoyed, and hopefully the timeline isn't so egregious compared to the canon one. Until next time~
She huffed and faced him to say, “Yes. And you’re going to admit it.”
“Alright then.” Potter finished the matchsticks and turned to help Draco. “Not used to waking up at four?”
“Shut up,” Draco said. “Anyway, I buy you food-” Draco raised his hand to Harry’s mouth to stop further protest, “-and we talk and kiss and stuff.”
In the weeks that passed, Draco became noticeably less tense about Hermione and Ron’s knowledge of their… Arrangement? Predicament? It hurt Harry’s head to think about it. His stomach would twist and turn and he’d feel very light and heavy all at once. It was easier to focus on little things. He was starting to get grateful whenever found the time in her packed schedule to sit down and force him and Ron to do their homework. And Oliver’s dedicated practice schedule kept him too tired to stay up late thinking about Draco.
He fell down to his knees as though someone knocked him down. In his head he heard a thud and a shriek. He was no longer flying.
Draco felt like he was shaking. They were still facing each other, mere inches apart. All he could think about was Sirius Black himself, lanky and grimy with madness in his eyes, bursting through the doors. “You’re shaking.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked impressed. “And it still works this good? Even the really pricey ones quit working after a few years.” Harry shrugged. Draco swallowed. “Right, well. Are you?”
He got back to the Slytherin common room. It hadn’t even been an hour, so it was hardly late, but Pansy was nowhere to be found.
“I didn’t expect you to be… Nice? Don’t worry about it, we don’t have to switch.”
“Don’t kill my boyfriend, please.” Ron gave a small laugh, and Harry grinned. Hermione looked between them and smiled.
“I'm not gay!”
“Obviously.”
“He’s Malfoy,” Hermione replied. “He’s a bully and he’ll probably sell you out the first chance he gets. And… Well, would you want to date a boy in general?”
Twenty more points, Harry thought.
“I’m going to be keeping this,” Lupin said, holding up the map. Harry didn’t protest, though he desperately wanted to. “And remember. We’ll start your private lessons in January. Have a pleasant rest of your break.”
Hermione groaned. “I don’t want to be working with Pansy on this.”
She looked in the box and gave them both a small, sincere smile. “That was faster than I expected. I hope you’ve realized it isn’t so hard to not be at each other’s throats all the time?” They both murmured an agreement. “Very good. You’re both dismissed. I’ll will send you the details of your next detention tomorrow.”
Quietly, Draco said, “Do you think the You-Know-Who is really coming back?” Crabbe and Goyle shrugged in unison, and Draco was reminded that it was doubtful they thought much of anything about anything. As usual, Draco was left to ponder this on his own. Every year something had happened. Quirrel had been trying to bring He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named back, then the Mudbloods had been attacked. Both instances had the Dark Lord appear in one way or the other.
“You’d date a boy, then?” Hermione asked, and it was impossible to hide the judgement in her voice.
Hermione nodded. “Is it about Sirius Black? Quidditch? Why have you started disappearing?”
He lifted his head. Ron, tall and awkward as ever, was standing at the door frame, clearly worried about him. “What?”
The boggart seemed to have figured it out, though. The woman was changing shape again, growing slightly taller, more masculine, more…
“Okay.” Draco looked to the window, where he could see sunlight starting to fade in from above the lake. “I want to go back to sleep, if you don’t mind.”
“What?” Harry stood up and tugged the cloak off of Draco.
“Alright.”
“What?” Ron asked back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And you won’t be going?”
Ron glanced at Harry and launched into his tale. “I woke up, and Sirius Black was standing over me. He had a knife, and had torn up the curtains. He mistook me for Harry, because it was dark and we were all sleeping. When he saw me, he tried to kill me so there wouldn’t be any witnesses. So I stood up and fought him off-”
“Maybe he just went back to grab something, and Draco felt like bugging him.”
The Slytherins got into a line, and Draco wasn’t stubborn enough to ignore the nervous excitement they all felt. Even if Lupin looked like he had been living on the streets all his life, he was a few steps up from the moron they had last year.
“Bye,” Harry replied, never having felt more embarrassed in his life.
“Weasley!” They all turned to look at Draco, Pansy, and Blaise.They were outside between classes, mostly alone. Harry felt guilty at the unease of seeing three Slytherins at once.
“Might wanna ask the idiots next to you about literacy,” Weasley quipped. Flanked by Crabbe and Goyle, Draco felt both of them tense up, and he felt mildly impressed that they knew what literacy meant.
Hey! I'm back quicker than I thought I'd be. I'm glad you guys seemed to enjoy the first chapter, despite how short it was. Don't worry. We're getting into plot and fluff. I hope you enjoyed. Also! I do not have my copy of the third book on me as of writing it, so I'm playing kind of fast and loose with the official timeline. If you read this and think, "Wait, this doesn't happen until a few chapters later," you're probably right! You are more than welcome to tell me; one day I will return to edit and that will be worked in. Until next time~
“We’ll manage,” Hermione said.
“You know what I mean.”
“Nothing.” She looked up from her nails into Draco’s eyes and he repeated, “Nothing! I’m tired, okay? I’ll just head to bed.”
“Right. Draco? Draco? Out of anyone?” Hermione asked.
“Look, you’ve been injured enough times for me to be worried. Merlin knows how your friends manage to stick around you.”
“Between you and Hermione, I’m gonna be left alone.”
“I got it back!” Harry shouted as he came back into the common room. Ron, George, and Fred all whooped, and Oliver fell to his knees and let out a sob. He looked at Hermione, who was glaring at him, and he felt a pit in his stomach. He grabbed Ron and brought him to her table, which was overflowing with books.
“Hi.”
“Absolutely,” Harry replied.
Draco didn’t bother to look back at Blaise as they walked down to the dungeons, and Blaise made no attempt to spark up a conversation. Draco wished Crabbe and Goyle had tried to drag him away instead, so he could be around people who wouldn’t try to figure out why his father was evidently his greatest fear.
More footsteps, and Hermione skid to a stop behind Ron. “You shouldn’t have run off like that! What if your cloak fell off or if you got caught in Honeydukes or coming back in or-”
“Talking about my father because you don’t know yours?”
Pansy,
“You’re mixing us up.”
“I can afford my own sweets.”
“You what?” His eyes darted between her and Blaise, and then behind them to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
Pansy turned and walked away. “Are you going to still talk to me?”
“Shocking,” Potter replied. “Well, actually scrub the tank instead of gliding over it. You’re not doing anything, and I don’t want to end up cleaning all of these.”
He held onto his first time flying as best he could through his mother’s screams and choked out, “Expecto patronum! Expecto-”
‘Perhaps it was a nightmare, Mr. Weasley?” McGonagall said.
“What?” Then it clicked, and Draco realized that Pansy knew exactly what he was. Which was fine. She was queer, she would know more than anyone how sensitive his situation was. But the words were stuck in his throat, and he could only say, “You’re wrong.”
To the snow, Harry said, “You’re good. For the past two years I thought you were absolutely evil, but I know better now. I know the you behind whatever you’ve put up for everyone else.” To Draco’s hand, which was clutching a patch of grass for dear life, he said, “I think you’re beautiful. I think you know that, you walk with a weird swagger, but you are. Even if you look a bit like a prat.” Draco let out a dry laugh, and Harry said, to his chest, “You’ve been driving me crazy. I didn’t know what we were or what you wanted, and I’m scared I might ruin your life. But I want to keep seeing you.”
“I know you aren’t fond of Harry. And I understand the Slytherin-Gryffindor rivalry; that was certainly just as prominent when I was a student. I think you two have more in common than you think, though. I remember petty feuds from my past, and I wonder if nipping them in the bud like this would’ve been more beneficial.”
“Buckbeak deserves a last defense,” Hermione insisted. Harry looked out the window to see the Hippogriff sleeping, tied up to a post. Completely unaware.
“Objectively, he’s handsome,” Harry replied.
“You think he’s handsome, huh?” Draco nudged him, and Harry leant to the side dramatically.
His stomach growled, and he groaned and put his head into his arms. He had plenty of time to get dinner before his detention, but that would mean running into Pansy, and though he had said he would try talking to her he was far from ready for it.
“Expecto patronum!” he yelled, thinking of everything in tandem, now. Quidditch, and how he was allowed to have fun. Ron and Hermione, his first friends. Draco.
Crabbe almost dropped his fork. “Where is he?”
He didn’t talk with Draco about his plans for Christmas break. It was a surprise to see him at the Slytherin table with Pansy and another Slytherin he didn’t really know. “I didn’t know Malfoy stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas break,” Ron said, voicing Harry’s thoughts.
Ancient Runes was considerably more painful as the runes melted into each other before his eyes and Granger seemed to be making an effort to be more obnoxious than usual. Draco was about to knock himself out with his textbook by the time they were let out of class. He sat with Pansy at meals and felt happy to see her again; though it had only been a bit more than a day, he didn’t appreciate the reminder that she was his only friend.
“Still-”
“Wake up.”
Draco and Ron were betting through Harry, which was for the best and also likely the closest they could get to actual communication. Harry kept Draco’s snide remarks about Ron’s poverty to himself, Harry kept Ron’s snide remarks about Draco’s family to himself, and he was currently holding the pot of 3 galleons under his bed. Winner take all. Both were also requesting Harry assure their separate victory.
“You should go back to your common room. What if it’s Sirius Black?” Draco asked.
“Be a bit weird for you to have a drink with yourself, wouldn’t it?” Secretly, Harry appreciated how absurd Draco looked seemingly talking to himself.
“Why do you care all of a sudden?”
Then they were all forcibly pulled apart. From where he was strewn on the floor, Draco could see McGonagall, though he would’ve known it was her when she said, in a booming voice, “What are you doing?”
Draco let out a sharp laugh. “My ears would bleed! Ugh, and his face. He’s hideous. He’s all gaunt-y and gross and his eyes are too green and pretty-”
He made his way to the Gryffindor common room. “Where’ve you been?” Ron asked.
The silence was deafening. Then a few people screamed, and everyone started to talk until McGonagall and Percy managed to quiet everyone. “Sir Cadogan! How could you let him in?”
They were all strained and tired. Ron was still mad at Draco and the Malfoys in general, Hermione was exhausted, and Harry was just tired.
“No!” Malfoy said. “I refuse to spend another second with him! He broke my thumb!”
Tears had formed in the corners of her eyes, and her voice had slowly raised during her quick monologue until she was nearly yelling. “Pansy, quiet down before you wake everyone up by saying you’re queer!”
“I thought so too.”
“Nobody knows what they look like,” Blaise replied. “They change their form to look like your worst fear.”
“Not Malfoy for sure,” Harry replied confidently, not really feeling it. It was impossible to explain that Draco had been kinder, much to his word that he would leave Harry’s friends alone. He had extended this to professors and other Gryffindors. He was capable of growing.
“Oh. Okay. I was just wondering if you wanted to hang out or something.”
Potter grabbed Draco’s hand and shoved it into the bucket despite Draco’s protests. He pressed Draco’s hand into a fist around one of the pieces of meat, and he gagged as he felt it squish in between his fingers. Potter let go and Draco shrieked, pulled his hand out of the bucket, and threw the meat away.
Potter took off his robes and rolled his sleeves up to his elbows. Draco tore his eyes away from the light brown skin and tried not to imagine being held by him. He did the same and brushed his hair back with his hand, not excited for the upcoming task.
The note from McGonagall requested him at her office at eight again. He said goodbye to Pansy, grinned when he saw how relieved Blaise felt, and left for the classroom. Potter was waiting at a desk, two boxes in front of him.
“According to Mary, hiding in her basement.” Pansy grinned and took her paper back. “It’s all bull. I doubt Black is anywhere but Hogsmeade.”
“Of course. Your secret is safe with me.”
“We were just messing with each other,” Harry said.
Harry fell asleep only after he thought about his mother’s voice. For the first time since they had died, he was able to hear her.
“Enough,” McGonagall said, and they fell silent. “If you two fight during any of these detentions, you’ll be given another one. I suggest you two learn how to get along.”
“Got it. Thanks.” Frowning, Draco returned to his own room, where he was alone. And so it appeared he was back to only Crabbe and Goyle.
“I want to kill Sirius Black because my parents trusted him more than anything and honestly if either of you did that to me I’d be too devastated for words and I can’t imagine how anyone can be so evil and frankly I’m tired of Voldemort always trying to kill me in one way or another and I’ve been snogging Draco and my broom’s broken so I don’t know how I’ll play in our match against Ravenclaw and I still have about twenty essays to do and-”
“Let’s go to Hogsmeade, then. We can sneak out under the invisibility cloak. And you weren’t able to go on the last trip. I can show you around.” Draco was grinning, more than he usually allowed himself to, and his cheeks were tinted red. He was beautiful.
Draco sneered, and Harry grinned. They were inches apart, and Draco had moved himself, quite willingly, so his back was to a broad piece of wood. Dust floated around them, and some had made a light coating on his hair. It would soon be gone once they were in the air, so Harry took the moment to appreciate his imperfection. “Don’t fall of your broom this time?” Draco said.
They came to the exit to Honeydukes, and Harry carefully opened the door. Seeing nobody, he slipped through, helped Draco up, and put the invisibility cloak over both of them. “Don’t want anyone seeing us coming out of the back room,” Harry whispered, dreadfully close to Draco’s ear. He was sure he didn’t imagine his shiver.
“Up to you,” Harry replied.
“He is,” Draco replied. “It’s so unfair.”
Harry’s head whipped to the door. From outside, he heard Dumbledore’s familiar voice. “Yes, the pumpkins came in beautifully this year. Hagrid is a wonderful groundskeeper.”
Taken aback, Draco replied, “Fine. Fixed, now.”
Lupin nodded. “It’s not an easy spell. You hold your wand just so, and say expecto patronum. But you must think of something that makes you truly happy. Happier than anything, something to hold onto while the dementor tries to chip away at your sanity. That’s what makes it so difficult.”
“Yes, everyone can stay,” Harry said.
“You finished it already,” Pansy replied, looking at her perfectly filed nails. “What’s going on with you, Draco?”
“You just looked at each other.”
“What about your family? No expensive, exotic vacations? No extravagant Christmases?”
Right now, they were sitting in a dim spot and just talking, their hands brushing together whenever they moved. “Hogsmeade trip tomorrow,” Draco said.
Lupin picked Blaise, who said, “A boggart.”
“I’ve just never been on a date before,” Harry said.
“Right.” Draco sat on the windowsill next to Harry. They weren’t touching, but he was uncomfortably aware that they could be. They he could reach his hand over and take Draco’s, to rest his head on his shoulder and wrap an arm across his back until they were holding each other. He looked warm, more so in the drafty castle.
“Leave him alone,” Ron replied. Hermione gave him a withering look but he ignored her, and Harry was grateful for it. He didn't know if he would tell them, or if he could, but he would do it on his own terms only.
“Is anyone?” Draco snorted.
“Right. See you, Harry.”
The change from confusion to rage was immediate. “What?!”
“What?”
“Just because you trust them doesn’t mean I do!”
Draco was almost certain he dissociated and missed the next ten minutes as Harry helped him clean the tank. Before he realized it, they had put away the sponges, vanished the water in the buckets, and dried the tanks.
Harry swallowed. “I’m tired.”
Draco grimaced and got into the common room. The misunderstanding hung heavy over his head. He wouldn’t run and tell, obviously, but he felt dirty being privy to information because Blaise thought he was in a similar position.
“‘Mione, we’ve been over this, it’s fine if he wants to be with a guy. We just want it to be a better guy,” Ron said, surprisingly gentle.
“I don't know!”
“And we were trying to get Potter off of Draco,” Crabbe said.
Harry trudged through the snow, wondering fleetingly if anyone cared that footprints were coming from nobody. Once he was closer to the field and away from any onlookers, he slipped the cloak back into his pocket, shivering slightly. Perhaps if he and Draco were smarter they would’ve thought to dress in warmer clothes first.
“Right, thanks.”
“How is Ginny?”
“Are you insane?” Ron and Pansy said in unison.
“If you ever touch me again-” Draco began to shout, but he noticed that Potter was grinning, his handsome green eyes sparkling. “What?”
The boggart was released, and it didn’t go much better. The screams were louder now, his grip on his wand and his voice both felt weaker, and Lupin stepped in sooner than last time. As Harry ate his chocolate, Lupin said, “It’s harder the longer you go. You were already weakened from the first time. It would be best to stop for the night.”
So Harry flew as fast as he could away from the Snitch, doing his best to keep an eye on it. Draco was well behind him, the Nimbus 2001 no match for the Firebolt. He slowed to a stop and turned to Draco. “Whoops. Missed it.”
“Why is Pansy stuck here?”
“Alright, you’re really focused on his scar, Draco.”
“My name’s Ron.” Draco grimaced, and Harry was beginning to regret most things.
“Please. I’ve been flying longer than you’ve known you were a wizard.”
Draco eyed them all now that he was closer. It looked like Weasley and Potter rolled out of bed in their robes for how rumpled they were. Draco doubted Potter ever attempted to comb his hair, and it was hard to tell if Weasley’s face was covered in acne, freckles, or both. He’d give it to Granger, her clothes were tidy, but her hair gave him the distinct impression she had been struck by lightning, and the bucked teeth made her look like a mouse. “Read the news lately, Potter? Or do you rely on Granger to read it to you?”
He glared at him. “Be my guest. Put them back in the box before you transfigure them so they don’t escape.”
“About us.”
They agreed on it, but nobody was quite happy. It felt like nothing had been accomplished, and Harry could see the defeat on Draco’s face as he snuck them back out.
“Professor, we could ask Sir Cadogan if he let anyone in? That’s the only way anyone could get in,” Hermione said.
The day flew by in a haze of disappointment and pain. Transfiguration was fine, and he got through Potions by ignoring Potter completely, even though Crabbe and Goyle couldn’t quite understand why. Pansy ignored him.
Before Ron could say anything, Harry agreed, “I shouldn't have provoked him.”
“Good. She might as well root for them next match,” Harry said.
“It was nothing,” Harry replied. Thank Merlin he didn’t know.
“How’s he avoiding the dementors?” Goyle asked.
“We all know.”
“Until our detentions are over,” Draco agreed, his heart threatening to jump out of his throat and proclaim, “HARRY POTTER I LOVE HARRY POTTER PLEASE KISS ME HARRY POTTER.”
As the match against Slytherin drew closer, all of Hogwarts was hectic. Percy, in the spirit of his brother, asked Harry to win the match for the sake of a bet he made with his girlfriend. The week leading up to the match, McGonagall laid off a noticeable amount of homework, and Snape piled on a noticeable amount of extra work for the Gryffindors (when Harry noticed only Gryffindors got extra assignments, he turned to glare at Draco, who grinned and stuck out his tongue). Lupin gave an encouraging pep talk about Harry’s father after a private lesson, and even the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws seemed on his side. The whole school seemed to have taken a deep breath that it only promised to release after the match.
“It’ll be quick.” Draco closed his books and followed Pansy out of the common room and into an empty hallway. Few people were wandering the halls as classes were still in session. “I told you my secret, now you tell me yours.”
“The what?” Draco asked. He glanced at Potter who look just as confused.
The intensity of the crowd had reached a peak. The raw emotion emanated, and different cheers and chants melded into a mass of white noise. Harry flew quicker around the pitch, his eyes scanning until they landed on a gold flutter close to the ground. He dove for real and Draco followed, keeping up better than he expected. They were neck and neck after the snitch, their fingers both outstretched. Harry tipped forward, his hand brushed past Draco’s, and he nearly lost balance as he caught the Snitch.
“Get over yourself,” Draco replied, moving to sprawl on top of Harry. Calmer now, Draco pressed light kisses to Harry’s face, moving down to his neck. Harry slipped his hand up the back of Draco’s shirt, and he shrieked. “You’re freezing!”
“You’re all too busy,” he said. “You can’t be comin’ out here at night, and Hermione’s got too many classes.”
“Yeah, from a wealthy family that often goes to Hogsmeade for shopping. Honestly, Harry, use that brain of yours. I know you’ve got one.” Grateful for the dark tunnel, Harry blushed.
“Would you be jealous if I did spend all of break with Blaise?” Though the tone was still teasing, Draco suddenly looked vulnerable.
Then Scabbers screamed, and Ron howled in pain as a dark figure leapt out and grabbed his leg.
Now that he had the Firebolt, he was spending more time with Ron and Hermione. Well, Ron at least, as Hermione was nearly frantic from the exponential growth of her work. They could spend some time researching for Buckbeak’s case, but he was busy with Quidditch and the Patronus.
Harry shrugged. Obviously he couldn’t tell them he was sneaking around to snog and, even worse, occasionally talk to Draco. They knew he wasn’t always running off to Quidditch (though that did take up the majority of his free time). And they knew his Patronus lessons with Professor Lupin were limited.
He looked crushed. “Okay.” He stood up, unusually quick and awkward. The invisibility cloak pulled at his shoulders and off of Harry, creating the effect of half of Draco's torso going missing.
“No,” Harry groaned.
“It’s good that you’re learning how to get rid of them. I wish I could,” Draco shuddered. “I don’t faint, but I don’t feel good, either.”
“What, and we just hang out? For a day?”
“Harry! And Malfoy, I’ve been expecting you two. I can take them from here, Filch.” Filch seemed more than happy to leave as Hagrid came out of his hut. “Right then, you won’t be doing much, we aren’t going into the forest this time. We’ll just be on the edge of it, you’ll be helping me with the thestrals.”
Second: This will most certainly be finished with a part 2. I do not know when that will be posted, but it will be sooner than the month long hiatus I put y'all through (I'm so sorry college and work and life, you know?)
“Gay?” Draco nodded. “I don't think so.”
“Why'd you kiss me?”
“Figure it out.”
Harry ran. He was out the door and back in the Gryffindor common room before he knew where his feet were taking him. It was too early. Ron and Hermione would wait for him in the common room, but they weren’t alone.
“He can’t,” Harry replied. In truth, he hadn’t spoken to Draco about it, but had an idea of where things would go. “His dad wouldn’t listen.”
Ron was awake waiting for him, and Hermione was awake doing homework as far from him as possible. They still hadn’t spoken since McGonagall took the Firebolt. It was a sore spot neither of them were over (though possibly nobody was as distraught to Oliver, who had apparently taken to crying in the shower again).
“Works with me.”
“Fine. They don’t count and this is a date.” Draco visibly lightened. “So… are we dating?” Draco didn’t respond at first. “Have we been? I didn’t really know if we were going to call… this anything.”
Draco looked at Potter, who was staring back at him. Conflict brought people together. In some situations, they could unite against the common enemy, the enemy being school authority, and forge an odd bond. But Draco hated Potter for his words and the pain in his chest, so he glared at him, feeling a little less smitten by his eyes.
“Why would you tell them? They probably think you’re disgusting, and they’ll tell everyone about me, and, oh Merlin-”
“Yeah. Right.” They worked in silence. Draco was loathe to admit it, but the newly transfigured beetles well contained in the box, thought they crawled around and over each other. Potter had the needles spread out on the table as he transfigured them back into matchsticks. Draco kept his eyes glued to the buttons. He was unbearably close to Potter. He could see the small flecks of different shades of green in his eyes, could see how his messy hair fell over his old, breaking glasses, how he pursed his lips as he focused-
Draco did fall back asleep once Pansy had left, but it had been a while after, and he only ended up catching a quick extra thirty minutes. He and Pansy were groggy the whole day, and he was grateful Hagrid had cowered so much to his father to reduce lessons to caring to flobberworms. He noticed the occasional glances Potter would take toward him; he figured this was his way of making sure he didn’t fake anymore injuries.
“No problem.” Blaise glanced down both ends of the hallway, and, seeing nobody, leaned closer to Draco and said, quietly, “I knew the look on your dad’s face. I’ve seen it on… Enough people. If you ever want to talk about anything, I’m here.”
Pansy rolled her eyes and leaned closer to Draco. “Listen. We’re the same.”
Ariel gave him a shiny-eyed smile. "I just like hearing it."
"Oh, I'm not that interesting. I mostly spend my free time reading and practicing magic."
"You're the best Ron and I fucking love you," Harry said, dapping him. "But also—are we really doing this?"
"I'm the most powerful dark wizard that ever lived! You should be telling me I'm great every day! You should be spending all day telling me you're proud of me! You should be singing my praises! Literally! You—"
"Maybe." She said and they laughed.
Voldemort came out of the corner of her eye, using his wand to carry the same two matching teacups and teakettle from yesterday. The tea set assembled itself onto the table before de-animating itself in the center as he took his seat across from her, smiling.
"We should make this a weekly thing." He said, trying and failing to sound off-hand as he suggested, "Maybe make Mondays into Mother-Son days."
"Narcissa so nice to see you! How are you? How is the family?"
"How did you do that?" He demanded, half-flabbergasted and half-beseeching.
His lipless mouth curled wider, revealing two sets of small, sharp teeth. "How's your hand doing, Albus?" He asked with a throaty chuckle. With mock sympathy, he added, "From what I've heard…it's looking awful." He pouted then let out a snake-like laugh as he taunted, "Ah…but I guess that's what you get for taking things that don't belong to you."
"I love you more than I hate him. Which is saying something because I really, really, really fucking hate that kid."
"How did it go?" She asked as he climbed into bed with her.
Ariel plunged forward. Her mouth landed on his softly but quickly their soft kisses got rougher, hungrier, more insatiable. Soon, they were all hands, groping, touching, clutching at another, their bodies pressed so hard into each other they looked like two halves of cells trying to fuse together, all gasps and moans and empty of thought. Ariel straddled his waist and rubbed her unclothed mound into his covered erection and they moaned loudly with anticipation.
"Why don't you sell it? We'll split whatever you get." Snape said with a smile. "That way you have money to start your new life and I don't go to Azkaban for possession of and attempting to sell stolen merfolk artifact."
"What?" He breathed.
Ariel hesitated but the coward in her spoke first, "Tonight? Sure. Why not?"
A sly smile broke out of Snape's grudging face before he relented and took a swig of Firewhiskey.
Snape looked at Dumbledore who wagged his chin towards her. Snape took his cue and went to her side, giving her a small embrace which she gratefully took. "There is nothing wrong with you. You were just trying to be there for a child who needed it most." When he let go of her, he told her, "Unfortunately for you, no good deed in this universe goes unpunished."
"Mama felt weird." He explained with a snake-like grin. "Or do you prefer, mom? Ooh or madre? Wait—what am I saying, we're not Italian."
Ariel watched him disappear inside the house. When he was gone, she turned her attention to Narcissa who stood by, waiting for her command.
With his ego bruised, the wizard stormed towards Ariel chasing her down until he managed to yank her by the wrist and force her to face him. He had his wand out, his mouth opened ready to deliver cruel retaliation, but Ariel stopped him dead.
"You know you're a lightweight for an evil wizard." She said as she took a seat on the edge of the bed. "You barely had half a cup before you were passed out."
"Why did you wake me then?" Nagini snapped.
"No one."
Voldemort gave him an odd smile when Snape didn't elaborate any further than asked after another short beat, "Any announcements you'd like to make?"
"My Lord," he began but neither of them turned their heads to acknowledge his entrance.
"Ah, little Draco, back from school," Voldemort remarked once the pair came before him. "How was your fall term?"
"I imagine you ran...wild."
Voldemort shushed him then used his wand to send Nagini through the air like a venomous blimp. Draco's heart raced when he saw the mischievous glint in the Dark Lord's eyes. He should have known. He wasn't there to clean up a dusty house. He was there to help because the Dark Lord wanted little Draco would dispose of Ariel's corpse and to know: no one was spared from his wrath. Not even his own mother.
"Would you mind…?"
It was twenty minutes after midnight and already a shit day for Snape. Then again, it was just another shit day in a shit year amongst a shitty lifetime.
Voldemort took his seat on the cushion beside her. "Fair enough." He flipped to the end of the book, waited for Ariel to give him the cue to start, then, in his best grade school reading-aloud-to-the-class voice, read her his personal favorite childhood story, "the Tale of the Three Brothers".
Snape made a small smile in spite of himself. "You and your optimism." Then after a small silence, he added, "I'm going to miss you."
"Desire her?" He echoed, repulsed. "Ugh! You think that because I worship the woman that I want… ugh!?"
"Well," Bellatrix said with a wide-toothed smile as she took the bottle of wine from Narcissa, walked over to Ariel and refilled the teacup that sat beside her on the floor, "Cheers to you on becoming an official potions-maker."
“You look…” Voldemort began. “Vexed.”
Narcissa was in one of the guest rooms, nursing a bottle of vampire wine while she laid in bed and stared dejectedly out the second-story window when her bedroom door opened with a bang and from the doorway stood Lord Voldemort.
Voldemort wilted in his seat, looking mildly disappointed but unsurprised. “I know.” He said. He lifted his lips and forced out a smile. “And I respect your… (sigh) moral objections.”
Desperate for adventure, Ariel hopped out of her chair, grabbed her mug of wine, and said with a sincere smile, "I would love that."
He cut her a sideways glance. His upper lip quirked then stretched into a slanted smile.
She turned her head to meet his gaze and as if reading his thoughts told him, "This must be a dream come true for you." When he was too dumbstruck to reply with anything other than a smile, she giggled and turned her eyes back to the ceiling. "You have bragging rights for life, professor. A lot of men would kill to be able to say they fucked a mermaid."
Tom gave her a closed-lipped smile. "Probably from all that drinking."
Voldemort scooped himself a generous spoonful of sugar stealing a surreptitious glance or two at his guest as he stirred his tea. Ariel snapped out of her reverie long enough to catch one of his jackal-like grins.
"Ooh! What is it?" He asked as he watched her climb from her chair and pull a badly wrapped package from underneath the couch.
"No love interests?" asked Arista slyly.
He tried to soothe himself by pacing and drinking water and holding his breath for ten-second increments (he was on the working theory that he was merely experiencing the rarely heard of silent hiccups) but none of them made the horrible feeling go away. Defeated, and filled with dread, he sought Nagini for advice.
The whisper network told him Scrimgeour had taken up in a family friend's unused summer cottage. "Apparently, he doesn't feel safe at home," Voldemort said with a boisterous laugh. Snape felt a burning hatred for him. How dare he use Ariel's body and voice to deceive and create havoc but all he could do was stand there, his wand burning in his pocket with bitter impotence, as Voldemort tapped his shoulder and stole him away. The two of them showed up on Scrimgeour's doorstep covered from head to toe in blood-soaked rags looking like the twin faces of pure misery. Voldemort even gave Ariel's clone a black eye and a cut on their shared collar bone to play up the story.
"Um…actually—"
Lucius and Narcissa watched in befuddlement as the Dark Lord threw his head back and unleashed a hearty laugh into the sky. Crows fled their nests in swarms, camouflaging the dull blueish grey sky with their black feathers. Lucius turned his head to ask Narcissa, who the hell is this drunk woman that the Dark Lord looks at like she's his dearest, but he only watched as his wife bravely emerged into the backyard. He followed her, his chest constricting the closer he stepped towards the white table. He overheard the Dark Lord, who pretended not to notice their presence, tell the red-headed woman, "You never told me you used to hang around with pirates."
"Oh crap," Hermione remarked once the laughter died done and she lifted her wrist to check the time. "It's 2:30."
Harry shook his head at him. "If you were going to be so uppity about clean glasses, why did you come in here?"
Epilogue:
Once the panic settled down and Draco was on the other side of the house, crying over how shitty it is to clean without magic ("how do muggles do this every day?!"), did Ariel turn to Voldemort and say, "Happy birthday."
In fact, he had looked forward to this particular day for a week now. For his only plan for that day was to feed Nagini and curl up with his new favorite read: the little shit known as Draco Malfoy's diary.
Narcissa paced the laboratory a thousand times in their absence. Her racing heart bashed against the inside of her chest as her mind circled back to every possible worst-case scenario: What if Lucius gets caught? What if they all get caught? What if she made a critical error and got them all killed? And what fate worse than death would await her and her family should something happen to Ariel? She white-knuckled the neck of an unopened bottle of wine, convinced at any second, death would come for her and everyone she loved.
All perfect days come to an end. Tom's ended when he saw his reflection at the bottom of his Polyjuice brew vial.
Ariel chuckled. "Have you lived under the sea? It fucking sucks. It's cold. I'm never warm. You're always getting chased by something that wants to eat you or fuck you or just plain kill you. You have no idea how easy it is to accidentally swim into a predator's mouth. And—it's never been home to me. I never felt at home when I was in the ocean. Even when I was with my family. But those few days I spent on land…those was the happiest days of my life. I felt like—like myself when I was on land. And I would give anything just to be happy with myself like that again. Even for a second."
"Albus, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it for myself," Snape swore stealing surreptitious glances at Ariel's depressed body as she laid stomach first on the floor in front of the fireplace. "But he really seems to adore her."
"No sir. Everything is as it was when we last spoke." Snape said calmly.
They rematerialized in a bare, dimly lit room. Ariel was struck immediately by the barrenness of the place: Aside from a meager chair that sat against the back wall beside an unused fireplace, like a squatter, everything about the place indicated that it was long abandoned. Cobwebs stretched from the ceiling to the floor in thick streams. No paintings or pictures decorated the walls. It was a decidedly unloved place. She felt a chill swim through her veins when she looked down at her bare feet discovered they trampled on years' worth of dust.
"Why are you so obsessed with me?" Draco demanded when the bartender handed Harry his drink and left to go restock the Fire Whiskey keg.
Stepping back into Diagon Alley, her hair caught the attention of a random asshole who felt entitled to her time.
"I spent decades on that army! Decades!" He raged. "I would've unleashed it too. I would've enslaved the world with them, in two years, tops. Is that good enough for you now? Mom?" He threw his arms at the mess of rocks, face wild with fury. "Will anything I ever do be good enough for you?!"
Ariel's face turned magenta and they both feared for a moment she was going to burst out crying again but she swallowed the sadness whole and instead gave him tucked-in-lip smile. "I'll try."
"You'll slit my throat and feed me to Nagini."
Simultaneously, they looked over at Hermione, seeking approval.
"Me-rope?" Ariel asked, after the moment of silence had passed. "Mer-op?"
"Stop trying to play matchmaker, old man."
"What is all this for, My Lord?" Snape asked with Ariel's melodic voice.
Ahead, in the lake, stood what looked like a birdbath.
"I love you," Draco said in a childish little voice as he crawled underneath Snape's blankets.
She beamed at him. "I appreciate that Tommy. I know how much you hate the kid."
For one awful second the Dark Lord stared at him, injecting himself into his mind, determining his lies. But then an instant later the Dark Lord's face softened and the hardness in his voice creased when he said, "I don't doubt that Severus. And as it stands, no, I wouldn't be upset if you two were to marry. I wouldn't go to the wedding because I think they're boring and the idea of marriage as a legally binding contract as idiotic but I'd send a gift and try not to torture you too much for being her husband."
The shopkeeper eyed Ariel's body with a quick vertical glance through before she turned on her heel, disappeared into the back and returned, minutes later, brandishing a plain pale pink long-sleeved dress with an asymmetrical hem that hung above the ankle. "It's fairy-made but the bottom was torn up by feral goblins so that's why it's eighty percent off."
“Yeah.” It felt like a lie. It tasted like a lie when it left her tongue. But for some reason, even as she stood on feet coated in giant blood, staring into the face of a man she knew would kill her with a smile on his hideous, noseless, lipless face should she fail to meet his expectations of her, she wanted to be there. Or rather, she knew she had to be there. “I don’t think we’ve ever seen each other for two days in a row. Thought we could change that.”
She went quiet again then asked, voice dripping with morbid curiosity, "What's it like?"
Ariel stared at him, overcome by a multitude of emotions. "Really?" She choked out.
"Really?" He asked, somewhat surprised. "Hm, I didn't expect him to tell you so soon. He usually dragggggs these things out for as long as he could." He glanced at Troubled Ariel and said, "We don't have to talk about this now."
More nothingness.
"Which one was yours?" He asked, impressed for it was no small feat to get a recipe published in that magazine (he must have submitted fifty times before they accepted any of his ideas).
Hogwarts, despites its beauty at nights, felt more like a catacomb lately. A catacomb that rarely offered peace of sleep but instead waves after wave of disappointment, miseries and some of the dumbest young people on the face of the Earth.
Chapter Nine: Conceal
"You were just... nervous. There were too many people—"
"Hello." He said.
Snape's throat went dry. He forced his gaze to her beautiful face, feeling his pants grow tighter the harder he fought to keep his eyes from diverting down to the rest of her body. "You're truly welcome." He murmured.
Snape remembered being in a bar. It was late and he had a vague feeling telling him that he should be going somewhere, looking for someone. Then a male silvery voice came from the side and said, "Hey handsome. Can I buy you a drink?"
Bellatrix went ahead with a solemn face and averted eyes as she gave Lord Voldemort and the pseudo-siren she had kidnapped a low, unyielding bow. "My Lord." She said with deep reverence. Then she picked up her back only to bent it again for Ariel tips of her long scraggly brown hair brushed the floor before Ariel's still-bare-feet, her voice almost halting as she pled, "Lady Ariel." To Ariel's discomfort, Bellatrix took the groveling one step further by dropping to her knees, crawling closer to Ariel, grabbing her by the hand and profusely kissing her fingers, pleading in-between wet kisses, "Forgive me for my earlier trespasses." (Kiss kiss kiss) "I know I deserve to be punished for my earlier trespasses" (kiss kiss kiss) "but had I known—"
It was the nicest compliment someone had ever given him, outside of his accomplishments. And the best part, it was sincere.
"Of course, My Lord," Narcissa assured as she corked the bottle of wine, tucked it under her pillow, and sat upright in her bed attentively. "How—how can I help you?"
He walked her to the fireplace, handed her a handful of floo powder and kissed her farewell.
She let out an ashamed moan, thinking she had passed out on the ground from drinking when a slip of paper sticking out from underneath a small purple velvet string bag caught her eye. She picked up the paper. It read,
"It's true." Draco piped up. "I love cleaning without magic. I find it peaceful."
A blinding rage threatened to pour out of the Dark Lord but he managed to suppress it long enough to join in on Fenrir as the werewolf chuckled salaciously.
"Uh-huh," said Ariel, in-between sniffles.
"Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think that my collection's complete? Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything…"
He let out a wheezy little laugh. "That's exactly what I thought too. Oh... who would have guessed?"
Hermione let out an uproarious laugh. Then she propped her fist under her chin, turned her glassy eyes onto Ron and asked, coaxingly, "What about you, Ronald? Are you going to defend your best friend's honor and fight me?"
Ariel had set a glass of water in front of him. When he caught her eye, she looked away as if embarrassed.
He didn't even realize his own hunger until she mentioned it. The mere suggestion caused his stomach to churn loudly.
"I don't care," he croaked, his tears rolling down her tail and blending in with the drops of lake water that hadn't yet evaporated.
“I don’t understand…” she whispered.
Oh, don't act all prissy. The first thing she told you when you met was about how she murdered her husband. You didn't seem to mind then.
He plopped his catch on the space in front of Draco and took the chair opposite of him.
“Everything!” She gaped. She felt suddenly unhinged. Sitting in this garden in this house of blood having morning tea with the world’s most diabolical wizard underneath an Indian summer sun pretending like they were mother and son. She looked up and saw Tom’s ghost dissipate from the table, leaving only the Dark Lord. She knew then and there she was a fool to think she could change him back into the boy she barely knew. With that, she abruptly got to her feet and said, “I gotta go.”
If they were ever going to be in the Dark Lord's good graces again, he would have to prove himself able to make up for his father's shortcomings. He would have to be a good spy. He would have to prove himself craftier, smarter than his father. He had to be the perfect, clever, stoic servant. Like his godfather.
"Harry," Ron began, sobered. "Hermione's right. He's not worth it. Let's just go back to the dorms."
"Want to hear a funny story?"
Ron threw down his quill and let out a loud happy sigh looking like the happiest motherfucker that ever fucked. He was sitting in the eating hall with his two best friends and they were all bent over textbooks or reading material of some kind for Hermione had finished her assignments an hour ago and had started reading the paper.
There was an awkward pause. "She's uh...got a bit of a crush on you."
The mouse made out a terrible, high-pitched squeak, convulsed twice, then collapsed, dead against the stone-made fireplace.
Eventually, Nagini got bored with the chase and she crawled down from the ceiling, into the middle of the kitchen floor, and kept still.
She looked like she'd rather throw up, Draco observed but Ariel took her cue and stood before the room, clearing her throat like a diplomat before unleashing her glorious mezzo purr onto the room,
They held each other in silence for a moment before Snape broke it by saying, "The house looks magnificent."
It took them a half hour to say goodbye. Every hug lingered. Every tiny space on his face had been kissed or pinched and touched. And when they weren't taking turns dousing him with affections, they were stretching out last minutes conversations with Ariel.
"You should see her in combat. I've seen this magnificent beast take down creatures four times her size," said Voldemort as he went to the kitchen.
"I call bullshit," Narcissa said.
"H-how fast can you…?"
"Tonight, right now." He said wand in hand knees plunged into the mud. He was about to reach into his pocket for his wand when a thought crossed his mind and he stopped himself to unbutton his cloak and laid the cloth down on the wet ground. He gestured for Ariel to lie on it which she did and then he took his wand out and said, "Okay. I must warn you this is going to sting for a bit."
He winked at her once then left the room, leaving Narcissa to resume her solitary drinking her mind spinning with the formation of a new plan to save her son's life.
"I do." He said in a measured tone. "But, if I might ask, why are you asking me such a thing?"
"Nar, have you lost your mind?" Lucius said in a terrified whisper. His pale face lost the little bit of color it had at that moment. He hoped against hope that the Dark Lord had forgiven him for his trespasses at last summer. He thought the red-headed woman was his gesture of clemency. But if he didn't send for him, then that means the Dark Lord still hadn't accepted his failure to retrieve the prophecy. Which only meant one thing. "You've doomed us both."
This has to be a dream, he told himself later, after they switched to three other positions before ultimately, he came so hard he saw stars and collapsed, a sweaty panting heap of flesh and spent pleasure, beside this beautiful creature. How can this be real? He asked himself as he turned his head and watched Ariel's profile deliver a big dumb smile to the ceiling.
The mouse jumped onto the inside of the wall and started climbing.
"Well, it's a game where one person will say a word and you say the first word that pops to mind."
"Oh, don't be such a prude, Potter," Draco replied coyly, inching closer towards him, reveling in the discomfort he was sure to create. "There's no shame in desiring other men."
He smiled and blinked. "Not at all. Which is saying something for me because I usually run out of energy for all human interaction once I hit the ten-minute mark."
"Oh, nothing much," Ariel replied. "Kinda drifted around for a while, excavating sunken ships, making potions. Other than getting my legs back, the most exciting thing that's happened to me in the last six decades was getting one of my recipes published."
Ariel smiled and gave him a two-shouldered shrug.
“Yes, but I’m sure that doesn’t help your case with her. She despises him as well.”
By six weeks, they were practically living together, effectively splitting their free time together between Hogwarts and Spinner's End. Ariel moved into his childhood home since there was no sense in hunting for a new home when his sat unlived in for 9 months out of the year and spent her days thoroughly enjoying full use of his laboratory while he worked after which they would rejoin in the evenings and enjoy each other's intimacy.
"Walk much, Potter?" Draco sneered before he shouldered past Harry and rushed into the bar's entrance.
