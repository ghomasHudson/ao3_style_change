“PopRocks?” Eve echoes as Draco growls in clear agitation and stands, reaching up to his bags above.
Thus far Draco’s favorite class is Transfiguration. He adores the subject and finds McGonagall to be by far the most competent of all his teachers up to this point. She is clear and precise, stern but patient, and capable of describing each of her lessons in varying ways to differing students. It also doesn’t hurt that Draco has all those extra books she suggested for him and on their first lesson Draco manages to be the only Slytherin first year to turn his match into a needle.
“Well, sometimes it is through our survival that we eventually find our happiest memories, and sometimes our happiest memories lead us to try even harder to survive,” Granger explains, head tilting. “It depends on the individual, and it IS just a theory, but it might be worth considering.”
He moves to leave and allow Sophie to get back to… whatever the girls are doing, but abruptly the girl is snagging his arm to keep him still. She’s frowning again, looking thoughtful, before she says, “Wait here a sec.”
Draco hums, looking back down at his book, but then looks back up with furrowed brows and a very displeased twist to his lips. “Why do
“He’s really nice, too… And his voice is super deep because some people aren’t screwed over by puberty, apparently.”
“You were so spectacular, protecting your cousin like that, and giving me a family I get to love again. Your soul shown bright that night, showing its true nature.”
“So it wasn’t really realization, it was resignation,” Harry summarizes, and when Draco looks down at him he seems sad.
He plops back into his seat with a deep scowl, a tight feeling in his chest, and a bright red flush of embarrassment over his face. “Heart of gold,” he scoffs, “Cannot believe that specky git would stoop so low. Heart of gold.”
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Granger sniffs, the usual bite in her words gone, and she looks back down at her book. It’s a textbook, it seems.
“Did anyone think to consider how I might feel about that?” the pale boy demands, a fire in his chest he recognizes as panic and anxiety, which he carefully covers up with indignation.
“Dumbledore’s gone, fled, to cover for me,” Harry continues, ignoring Granger as his voice begins to mount. “He was our only defense and now he’s gone and I couldn’t do
“It’s just…” Draco starts, trailing off, then glances back at the windows. “We have such a great opportunity here, I don’t want to waste it.”
“It makes them unfit for their positions,” Draco snarls. “’The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.’ Franklin Delano Roosevelt,” he recites the quote like he’d learned it yesterday, but in reality it has been in his head for many, many years. He’d read it originally in the World War 2 museum at an exhibit that showed all the major leaders through the war. “Their fear makes things worse, not better. They are creating more problems that they will surely blame someone else for down the line.”
Technically, Dobby found the slinky while cleaning up some of Draco’s old toys and hadn’t understood what it was. Wizards didn’t have slinkies, after all, but the house elf had been entertained by the metal spiral when Draco had demonstrated it.
it. I understood why it was important, but I could hardly do it. All my speeches in front of the class were messy and I got SO sweaty, but this one speech… I dunno, I just had a bad day, told my professor, and she let me record it at home instead.”
He deserved it. There was no telling what the following years would bring, but he would have all of them by his side in one way or another.
When he returns and drops into his bed, Harry has already burrowed into the blankets and the other beds’ curtains have been closed. With a flick of his wand, Draco shuts his own curtains, finally offering some privacy, and he peers down at Harry.
But, as the term goes on, Draco begins to wonder if Granger was right. Edgecombe is definitely twitchier and more anxious, but she doesn’t make any move. Perhaps she had simply been further spooked of negative circumstances to her actions while visiting family. Perhaps she simply needed to move past it.
Draco and Harry have a few more minutes of quiet chatter after they properly introduce themselves before Madam Malkin lets them know how much they owe. Draco pays for his and Harry says he sees his parents outside and he’ll hopefully see Draco later.
Draco didn’t even mind Max’s or Max’s father’s rambling. They’d ended up in a new room, this one outlining the specific branches of each major power’s armies. They’d already gone through the Allied Forces and were now on the Axis Powers.
It doesn’t take long. It comes as no surprise Hermione Granger is sitting near the front of the train by one of the exits. She probably wants to be one of the first ones out, Draco suspects, and of course she has her nose buried in a book. This time, however, her wand also sits in her hand.
The Slytherin can’t move, his mouth hanging open, awestruck as he stares at what he’s created. The thestral shakes out its head again, at peace to stand right before him in all its glory, and Draco feels like an idiot for just… standing there.
Eve finds them right before the train begins to move, opening the compartment door and looking down at the slumbering Potter and researching Draco. When Draco looks back up at her she arches a brow and says, “Ah, yes… order had been returned to the universe.”
“A smooth transition from conversation topics, Max, you are truly a master,” the blonde says, but leans over the side of the tub, arms momentarily flailing, until he gets ahold of a small, cardboard box sitting on the tile.
“Harry,” Max replies, mimicking Potter’s tone perfectly. Draco and Potter sit side-by-side on the floor of the tower, the radio in Draco’s lap, with their homework thankfully done and conversation beginning to pitter off.
And it didn’t stop feeling surreal, either, because that wasn’t the only time Harry snuck in. They had so few places where they could be themselves, hidden away from the majority of the school body and Umbridge, it made perfect sense to exploit the password entry system for their houses. Well, Harry exploited it, really. The Gryffindor still slipped his own password to Draco whenever it changed, but the boys in Harry’s dorm weren’t all on their side.
“Do not wander off like that again, Draco,” Narcissa says, voice firm, but her face and posture showing nothing as they walk through a crowd of her peers. “It has only been two months since you last--” Since Draco went missing in Muggle London, he finishes in his head when his mother cuts herself off.
Draco hums, silver eyes examining the other boy thoughtfully, and nods. Okay, so… houses equaled like-minded students. Ravenclaw, the one McGonagall had mentioned, sounded fine. He knew he was smart, and he had always been curious, but he also knew there was plenty more to him than that.
Mr. and Mrs. Nubble didn’t have any major going-away gifts for him, but they did wish him well and told him to write. They wanted to hear about everything, mostly to make sure the school was up to their standards.
“‘Only one?’ Majority of the DA hasn’t mastered both charms. What are you talking about?” Draco questions, and now it’s Harry’s turn to look baffled.
“I regret to inform you that I have no intention of dying anytime soon,” Draco says, attempting to be light, but Potter just whimpers.
“I have a question,” Potter speaks up, wiggling his fork between his fingers. “If that portrait is stuck to the wall forever… Why not just remove the wall?”
“What is happening here?” Umbridge questions as well, she and Draco watching as Edgecombe scrambles for a compact mirror in her robes and pulls it out. When she opens it and finally looks at herself, she abruptly drops the mirror with a shriek that makes the cats in Umbridge’s plates flee. Tears are welling up in her eyes as she furiously scrubs at her forehead, despite the pain it surely must cause.
“That’s right,” Granger adds brightly, being shaken out of her own surprise as she also hurries forward. “All of the Unforgiveables require a clear path from caster to target.”
Lucius yells, his wand flying away with the attack, but then his furious, grey eyes are back on Draco. He sneers, cold and awful, and lashes out with his cane at the snow leopard’s head. It collides with a crack, dazing Draco for a moment, and Lucius lurches to recollect his wand before Draco can recover.
Before the dragon Harry stands, staring up at it in shock before he’s spinning around to face his friends. He says nothing at first, no one does, but then he’s throwing his arms out and barking a shocked, amazed laugh.
Yes, this would certainly be interesting. And so, so satisfying. They couldn’t deny anything anymore.
“Thank you. That’s the point,” Draco smirks back at him, then arches a brow and gives the man’s wardrobe a onceover. He was wearing thick robes for the weather that were lined with remarkably thick, grey fur. It made him look like he’d finally gained some weight. “Warm in there?”
For a moment Harry works his mouth like he can’t figure out what to say, opening and closing it before swallowing and shaking his head in a panic. “Of-of course not! I just… I was… I was supposed to be somewhere else, is all,” Harry finishes lamely, looking back down at the table. Some of his nerves seem to be shifting now that he’s talking and now he just looks sad.
After a very pleasant breakfast Draco had made his way to McGonagall’s office to ask her if there was any news on getting him a new broom. Vivian’s anti-jinx clasp made Draco feel a bit more at ease, but only just, and he really felt a broom of his own would make him more confident about the whole thing.
” he attempts and, for a moment, it appears to begin working. The stone wall where he points his wand begins to break apart, but halfway through it simply stops.
Sometimes it was over a quiz at school that hardly meant anything. Sometimes it was over a “level on a video game” they couldn’t get past. Sometimes it was over something Eric said or did that was so deeply ingrained in sibling behavior it left Draco puzzled and lost. Sometimes it was over something small and pointless that happened at school or home or the park.
“Are you ever going to let us look at that book?” Draco says pleasantly as he takes a seat in the library. Across from him sits Leandra, the Geoscript in her hands, and Eve beside her.
Karkaroff and Maxime only had one star each. Despite being new arrivals, and Draco being aware of Karkaroff’s Death Eater background, it didn’t fit with either of them that they would sabotage their own school’s chances of winning.
With a resolve to act as normally as possible Draco decides to just ignore them, opening his new book and beginning to read about the adventures of a character named Bilbo Baggins. At some point he manages to maneuver the half empty box of jellybeans and the chocolate frog onto his lap, which took some rather painful jostling, before he settles.
When Edgecombe finally stands from her table, shaky on her feet, the three boys wait a few seconds before standing and following after her at a safe distance. They needed to tail her and see where she was going before fully jumping to conclusions. Right now, all they had was a hunch.
“Opposite,” the blond moans into the cushions of the couch, muffled dreadfully, but still heard. He can practically
The major focus of Draco’s investigation had very quickly shifted to Barty Crouch, but that didn’t mean he intended to ignore some of his other suspects, one of whom he was having a hard time getting to.
” Max’s voice echoes through the empty Astronomy Tower and Draco holds the radio out a little farther from his ear with a cringe. Harry, clearly laughing at him, takes the radio into his own hands. It was hard balancing it with only one working arm, after all.
Thankfully, their well-timed return had worked perfectly. The twins had set off another distraction, pulling Umbridge away and giving Draco and Weasley the opportunity to slip back into Hogwarts through her fireplace. The only people who would know about their usage of the floo network out and in of Hogwarts would be themselves and, probably, Dumbledore. Dumbledore seemed to know everything that happened in these walls.
Class ends a moment later and before she can slip away Draco grabs ahold of Pansy’s arm in the corridor just outside of the classroom. To her credit she doesn’t yank free from him, instead looking coolly down at his hand until he lets go. He still keeps his glare in place.
“And do not speak to those Weasley’s,” she continues, her hiccup already forgotten. “They are beneath you.”
Draco does not know the timeline of the Chinese dynasties, and thus cannot garner a proper estimate, but he can only assume it has been a very, very long time since the Lung Dragon arrived here. Long before the Ministry of Magic was officially established, apparently.
“Hermione, really, you must be seeing things,” he denies, waving his hands in front of his face in a frantic move to dissuade her.
Dumbledore’s smile stays steady as he removes his wand. “I think that is quite reasonable. Wouldn’t you agree, Sirius?” he says and, with a flick of his wand, the door to Flitwick’s office unlocks and creaks open. Slowly, like he’s not entirely sure this is all real or not, Sirius Black steps out.
The halls are filled with echoing cries, spells banging off the cold stone, the Inquisitorial Squad far too eager to do harm. Even with the DA’s head start, their enemies are vicious and have no qualms hurting them to get them to stop.
“I am glad you are enjoying yourself,” McGonagall cuts into his thoughts and he looks to her and she’s smiling kindly at him, “But we cannot stay for long. You are more than welcome to explore on another day. For now, collect some of the coins so we may be off.” Draco nods, feeling a new, eager energy in his veins as he turns around and begins scooping gold, silver, and bronze coins into his backpack, careful not to damage Mrs. Nubble’s phone.
In the end, Eve had sent a Howler to Draco to yell at him for worrying too much and they’d decided to just play it by ear.
“Harry…” Draco says slowly, more confused than he’s been all day, frozen in place just inside the door. “What… How…?” He feels like a fool, unable to form a proper question, and slowly Harry is giving him an amused, smug smile, clearly entertained.
Draco looked up at McGonagall thoughtfully. So they went out of their way to stay secret, that made sense, but it still didn’t explain how they did it. Or why.
By the time she reemerges, a lilypad on her head and laughter booming around her, Draco has merged with the crowd and offers up a discreet grin and salute to the twins above him.
Draco pushes his way fully into the office, shutting the door behind him, and standing before his Astronomy teacher as confidently as he can. He can’t sit. The chair has a chess set in it made of glass.
Draco lets out a small noise of shock, knees feeling like Jell-O as he sways towards the vault. He looks around, not sure where to even begin. His eyes stray to a black cane leaning against a table nearby with a silver snake head at the top before his eyes continue to wander.
Harry shrugs. “It never came up.” Feeling he won’t get anything else out of the boy Draco falls silent, dropping the subject for the time being. So, Harry’s mother was a professor at Hogwarts. And in potions, no less, a subject Draco had been especially interested in. It was certainly intriguing.
But then the redhead is sighing deeply and saying, just loud enough to be heard over the crowd, “Sorry about all that.” Draco blinks, obviously shocked, and he snaps his mouth shut after it falls open. Ron glances over and turns red with embarrassment. “You don’t have to look so surprised, the both of you!” Draco glances back at Harry to see the boy also looks shocked, his brows raised high until they are hidden by his mess hair.
But the best part is that no one bothers them with any of the bullshit that made the end of the year so difficult. They are left to their peace, laughing and eating and reading together.
“Magic without a wand is raw. For some, it is this that makes it more malleable,” she begins, looking back at Longbottom, who was helping out a younger Hufflepuff student who was still working on their Levitation Spell. “But for most, it becomes tied to our mindset. Confidence, happiness, positivity. These mentalities assist in the flow of magic in all forms.”
“You are still upset that they will not share all of their information with you,” Draco observes honestly, and Potter heaves a deep sigh.
He gets sent to his room after that, where he locks the door and hardly comes out for the rest of the holidays. Luckily, to better his mood, Tana brings him a package from Max and their family. There is a Christmas gift from each of the Muggles.
The glamour wavers, then melts away, and Sophie Roper stands there glaring down at Millicent like she’s the scum on her shoe. “You can’t, can you?” Sophie hisses, furious, “Because you know it’s wrong. He was a kid just like the rest of us, and now he’s dead. But HEY! At least Bulstrode doesn’t care. Give a round of applause to Bulstrode, everybody! She’s better than the murder of an innocent boy because it makes her feel better.” Sophie gives two, loud, slow claps, before spitting at Millicent, and, like a lightning storm, stomping away.
During the quick exchange Ron leans behind Harry and stage whispers, “Hagrid and Harry’s parents have known each other for ages. I’ve never met him, but he always seemed pretty nice. Plus--” Draco doesn’t get to hear what “plus” is because suddenly there is movement behind him and Greg is shooting off to the side like a rocket. The entire group of young students falls silent as the large boy lands on the ground, crouching and hands together, then stands up hastily. His short hair and robes are covered with dirt, but he doesn’t seem to mind as he turns around, something clutched between his hands. A few kids off to the side - a tall, skinny boy and a short, fat girl - snicker, and Draco’s eyes thin at them.
“Anguis!” Theodore calls as they get near enough to their common room, but then he runs smack into the unchanged brick wall and falls backwards onto his rear, clutching his nose.
“Next time, take a breath before you run off,” Duke says, handing Draco the note with a playful smirk. It was so unlike the Auror Draco knew. “If someone else had seen this… Well, you all could have been in a lot more danger.”
The clack of wood against stone has Draco looking back towards McGonagall where she is setting down a four-legged stool with a raggedy, old hat set atop that. She was apparently done speaking and Draco has a moment to feel bad about ignoring her so much, but then a tear in the hat splits open like a mouth and it begins to
As the train nears their destination and a few, late holiday presents can be passed out – a bag of PopRocks has been given to each in the compartment and Ginny has passed Draco a Christmas package from the Weasley family – Draco decides to get down to business.
“You have an inclination towards explosions,” Tracey states bluntly, head very slowly tilting to one side, “What if you blow up someone’s internal organs while they are still inside them?”
In the end Max buys a “yoyo” and Draco a “slinky.” He can’t bring himself to even look at the WW2 themed toys. And besides, Draco thinks, as strange as his slinky might be, he probably got the superior toy because, whatever a yoyo is supposed to do, all Max manages to do is tangle their own feet up trying to play with it and trip onto their face.
“The Malfoys are one of the oldest known wizarding families within our world. They have accumulated quite the fortune,” McGonagall glances down at Draco as he falls into step by her side, following the grumpy goblin that was apparently helping them. “And now it falls to you.”
we prefer them, it is so much more convenient to have someone who already has a foothold here, don’t you see, but times have changed! I have a whole speech planned for you all when we got to the common room.”
“Hey, we’re all Slytherin, here!” Pansy calls and, thanks to her track record, Draco can’t tell if she’s faking being offended, or she actually is. “We have to look out for each other, you know that.”
An undercut. If worn with slicked, well-kept hair it could still be seen as proper and pureblood-appropriate, but the purposefully messy style Eve had given him certainly wasn’t. Rather than have his hair be slicked back as he usually did, she’d styled it forward, some strands falling in his eyes and face, without getting in the way of vision. She’s also gotten Sophie to cast a charm on it to keep it in place without gel, allowing it to keep its volume and softness.
Potter turns red, pulls his hand away, and spins around all in one movement that lasts a second, leaving Draco startled and wide-eyed. The Boy-Who-Lived is quick to rejoin the class, immediately springing into the next lesson. From just over his shoulder, Draco spots Weasley glancing his way and shaking his head mournfully.
It wasn’t much of a bummer for Draco that there was an age cap for the tournament, either, since he had no intention of risking his life for something like a single trophy, but he would certainly be enjoying getting to watch the proceedings. It was bound to be all kinds of entertaining.
“What evil were they responding to?” Draco asks instead of lingering on the idea of a story where the good guys could screw up so badly, too. The question, however, is met with sudden silence, the whole family staring at him like he had just grown a second, horrifying head. Which is something Draco has heard of before, but he doubts happens around Muggles.
“If I’m a dragon I’ll torch both of you,” Draco snarls, sitting down on his bed and crossing his legs beneath him.
Eventually, the sound of fighting picks back up again, distantly, and Draco puts a bit more hustle in his steps. He twists around fallen shelves and, when the debris becomes too thick, he leaps gracefully up toppled metal and stone.
“I’ve only ever been to the zoo,” Potter is explaining and while Draco knows a zoo is where one can view animals, he does not know how it pertains to the current situation. “I set a python on my cousin.”
“I fight for myself,” Draco replies after a time, but it doesn’t come out as confident as he would have liked. It nearly sounds like a question, and judging by Sinistra’s extended stare, she likely can sense his uncertainty as well.
Draco’s eyes narrowed, fingers absently running down Muddy’s smooth body as she coiled up on his chest, right above his scar. Could whatever it was have been brought here to Hogwarts? Draco knew so few locations within the Wizarding World, so he had very little evidence for or against that thought, but…
“I was curious about this as well,” McGonagall says evenly, looking down her nose at Draco and the boy’s glower fades, quickly shrinking away from the woman’s gaze.
“Ten-four, Dray-buddy!” Draco sighs, deeply, and the muggleborn Slytherin continues, “I’m just workin’ on a little doo-dad. A bit of a gadget. A gizmo, if you will.” She holds up the metal device. It looks kind of like a rudder made of orangish-gold, with leather straps and all kinds of dials. It looks like it could be attached to a pole… Or…
One things Draco Malfoy was quickly learning about Muggles was that they were violent. His parents had insinuated as much before, but standing in the WW2 museum, looking at all the different kinds of machines built, specifically, to kill another person… it was a little horrifying.
(“Well done, Ron!” Granger had clapped happily as the shadowy form of an ox emerged from Weasley’s wand. The ginger laughed loudly as his ox and Granger’s bear began to play-wrestle.
Eventually Pomfrey tells them all to be quiet and Draco has a moment to walk around and check on everything. Mad-Eye, the real one, is laying asleep and recovering, and Flitwick has been laid out in the bed beside him.
“Strange, don’t you think?” Moody says as Draco takes his seat again. He sounds conversational, but everyone in the room knows better than to fall for that, “All your
The first time Draco cries over his radio it is over something stupid. He cannot remember what for, he’d been seven at the time, and it wasn’t really what was important. What had been important was Max quietly soothing him, speaking kind words over their connection and urging Draco to take deep breathes.
“Harry helped you?” Draco asks, suddenly fully invested in the conversation. Weasley gives him a smug, knowing look, which Draco swiftly glares back at.
Potter reads over the description for a moment, mumbling the incantation to himself a few times, then stands up. He makes a sharp motion with his wand, as shown in the book, then points it at his feet and says, “
Draco arches a brow as he and Harry exchange a look, then turn back to watch the mother and daughter conversation. Slowly, after a few swift blinks, Ms. Hushburn throws her spoon-hand skyward and makes a sharp noise of realization. “Ohhh, yes, yes. You like girls now. You still break his heart. Should feel ashamed.”
“Did I really just do that?” Harry whispers urgently to Draco, his own, green eyes wide in realization, and Draco nods slowly.
It feels like a rollercoaster. A particularly terrifying one, especially since they have no harness or seatbelts. They should really have seatbelts.
The blonde’s eyes widen and he hardly thinks twice before he is snatching the letter from her hands, ignoring her displeased grunt at his behavior. He quickly takes out the parchment he had so enviously stared after for the last week and begins to read.
They’d snapped at Draco, clearly not in the mood, and the two had dropped it, moving on to talk about something else.
Right, his letter to Sirius. He had written over twenty drafts by then but had grown so stressed from it all he’d started avoiding the subject. What was he supposed to say? “Hey, I’m your cousin and also famous. Why did you abandon me?” Not even Draco thought that would be fair. He didn’t have all the facts, of course he didn’t, so he didn’t want to start pointing fingers… yet.
“Good thing mommy’s teaching potions, don’t you think, Potter?” comes a nasty voice and Draco nearly tumbles over as Millicent knocks her larger shoulder into his side. She smirks at them as Draco rights himself and glares. “She’ll be able to give you all the best grades, won’t she?”
Draco tells them he’ll meet up with them later and rushes out, hurrying back to his own compartment to get his things. Vincent and Greg are just leaving as he gets there, smiling in greeting just as Hermione also makes her appearance, looking partially defeated for having not found Trevor, but mostly excited for finally seeing their school.
Maybe the Shrieking Shack? Students could take the secret passage there under the Whomping Willow. But that would take a while to get to…
If the dementors were no longer guarding them, however, that meant they’d be significantly easier to break out.
“We didn’t exactly ask them,” Draco drawls sarcastically, finally urging Longbottom to bring Hermione over to their other, injured friends.
Draco ends up running around through the forest as a snow leopard, his photos forgotten, and time passes by without his notice. He’s still fuming when he makes his way back to the castle, but he thankfully doesn’t want to hex anyone’s heads off anymore.
“You were stabbed, Draco,” Harry finally whispers, voice weak, and the arms that had looped around Draco’s middle tighten. “I watched you get stabbed by your own crazy aunt right after you risked your life to save Sirius. And Sirius--” Harry’s voice cracks, arms tightening even further. His very body language is desperate as his voice is abruptly lost to sobs.
A year later he died, suspected of a broken heart, to which it took every fiber of Draco’s being not to scoff. A broken heart wasn’t a cause of death, but rumors weren’t meant to be very accurate.
“You are the poshest asshole I have ever had the misfortune of meeting,” Ron Weasley says roughly, sounding less cheerful than his brothers.
Hope you liked what you read! We're finally making some progress with these boys! Oh, and also the story. Progress in that too. There's just so much that happens in this year, it's tough to get so much in to a satisfactory level.
“But what are we supposed to do to ‘educate society?’ I can’t even drive yet!” Max whines miserably and Draco chews at his lip in thought.
” Granger says sharply, flicking out her wand, and suddenly Chopin’s Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2 is playing in Draco’s head on loop and he squawks, indignant.
The blunt comment very clearly startles the Muggleborn, because she sits ramrod straight, looking at Draco with wide eyes, her eyebrows high on her forehead. “P-pardon?”
“Ignore him,” Potter calls from behind one of the many trees, still removing ornaments. “You don’t have to kiss if you don’t want to.”
Too-large hand-me-down clothes. Short and skinny beyond what he should be. Eating every single thing on his plate even when he didn’t look hungry. Room so clean and tidy, as if something out of place was a punishable offense. Twitchy in confined spaces. Loosening shoulders as soon as he stepped away from 4 Privet Drive.
Their balance gets thrown when Draco pushes a bit more than he needs and then they’re tumbling back onto the couch, blanket getting tangled up around them, and yelps leaving both of their lips. They blink at each other, surprised to still be on the couch and not the floor, before they both begin to giggle, hysteric, and Harry bumps their foreheads together.
Draco, silent as can be, turns away and maneuvers through approaching crowds of students and heads back towards the castle and, hopefully, answers.
“I allow my students a reprieve they dearly need from other inter-house prejudice, but not for nothing. I am aware any time someone passes through my wards,” Sinistra explains, hand still outstretched, “The flying part was a logical guess.”
The snap of camera shutters is what has Theodore looking up in surprise, like a unicorn caught at wand point, Draco thinks. It was the first Tuesday evening of the week back after Christmas Break. Draco and the Golden Trio had already had a planned fight in the halls, Umbridge was still a toad, and a wandless tutoring lesson was to take place later that very evening.
“How else do you expect people to believe us?” Draco arches a brow and Sirius glares a little harder.
The fight between Draco and Potter had been about two weeks ago, maybe a little less, and the boy still wouldn’t talk to him. Draco didn’t much care, but if he planned to stay the Easter Holiday at Sirius’s it may become aggravating.
“It shouldn’t be much longer now,” Granger says, glancing up at the sky. The moon is full tonight, but the clouds partly cover it. It still bathes the grounds in silvery light, however, which will help when Draco gets to finally take a picture. They were attempting to stay hidden, so a camera flash was out of the question.
, Quaffle tumbling away from him, and he has to grab hold of the handle so he doesn’t get thrown off.
Unless… they didn’t want to destroy it. The prophecy appeared to be the only thing Voldemort was interested in right then. With it sitting here, in the basement of the Ministry of Magic, Voldemort would run quite the risk of outing himself to the public if he showed up here.
“They’re jerks… not monsters,” Potter mumbles, repeating Draco from that night that felt like years ago.
“Can I tell Ron and Hermione about Max?” Potter asks, voice deceptively calm that it takes a moment for Draco to realize what he’s asked.
They’d all left the Room of Requirement afterwards, adjusted it into a guest bedroom, and let Skeeter inside on her own. Unbeknownst to the reporter, Draco had placed multiple charms on the door that would tell him if she attempted to leave and snoop around.
” she says calmly, and from the tip of her finger flies the blinding light of her Patronus, the streams of light weaving together into an absolutely massive shape.
“Oh, do stop your nonsense, Patil,” Draco snaps, glaring over at the frightened girl. He doesn’t mean to attract the entire classes attention, however, but that’s precisely what he gets. All eyes turning to him and he swiftly stands up a little straighter. Oops. “That’s all unfounded superstitions. They’re—”
Crabbe gives a hesitant shrug before mumbling, “I don’t know…” Goyle nods along in agreement, clearly uncertain as well, and Draco eyes the two in confusion. They didn’t know? But their fathers were Death Eaters as much as Draco’s, and they’d never shown any disagreement with the pureblood agenda before. Where was this coming from?
Rather than shatter on impact, however, the earth splinters when the black orb lands, the orb completely unscathed.
“And this is what our Militus personifies,” Draco concludes and Sinistra gives a half nod, her shoulders shifting in a way that might be identified as a shrug.
He set the document aside for Sirius, though, since he’d voiced concerns over the woman in the past.
“Never again,” Draco groans, shutting his eyes and trying to bury his face in the pillow, ignoring Harry’s laughter.
Potter sits on the windowsill just behind him, feet dangling by Draco’s shoulder, occasionally nudging him as they sway. The radio currently sits in the Gryffindor’s lap.
“They’re… they’re, uh…” Neville is trying to speak, eyes jumping all over the place, unsure where to look, “They’re the same thing… right?”
He’d left Eve’s note on Duke’s desk. The note saying Harry had run from the Order and the exact address of where he was now. Draco was an idiot.
“That is what many people use when referring to you. That and The-Boy-Who-Lived,” she explains. So… it was like his title? Or a nickname? It kind of reminded him of how they called that evil wizard “You-Know-Who,” or whatever it was. Wizards had interesting naming conventions…
“You don’t understand,” Harry said, leaning towards her over the table, a deranged look on his face. This had been the messiest of all his exams, that was for certain. “I told Professor Marchbanks she should have died
“The Inquisitorial Squad will have ultimate power,” Granger finishes, her expression twisting in upset anger.
“Don’t ask me to get her to go easy on you,” the bespectacled boy says, trying to sound confident, but his voice wobbles. Draco suspects they all know that that wasn’t what Millicent was planning on asking.
“Young master? Are you well?” Tana asks, clearly seeing the discomfort on the young wizard’s face, and he forces himself into a cool, collected state.
It makes Draco want to puff up and preen, but he holds himself together. He has to appear unaffected to absolutely ensure no one can connect him back to the articles. He still gets a few knowing glances from a few members of the DA, but he ignores them.
“I copied documents from the Records Department. How many times do I have to say it?” Draco snaps, slowly lowering his hands when he thinks Granger is done screaming. The best way, he found, to deal with his crippling fears, was snark.
Draco snarls at them, a rumbling noise that doesn’t sound entirely human, and the majority of the younger students shriek and run away.
“What if, though… it’s something else?” Draco motions towards the Room of Requirement, just a vague wave of his hand, and his gaze grows sharp. “Most of the memories you’ve told me you use are momentary. You do protect someone, but only in that instant. Other threats arise later on to be dealt with. But what about the DA?”
“She just wanted to say hello to Harry. You couldn’t have kept your mouth shut for once in your life?” Granger scrubs angrily at her hair.
“Yes,” Hushburn smirks, “That was their goal. Killing some random teenager named Draco Malfoy ten years after it was released,” she looks back down at her own book, “Baby…”
“The wand is a most important part of every witch and wizard, Mr. Malfoy,” Ollivander is saying as he measures across Draco’s knuckles, “It is an extension of one’s self. Tricky stuff, finding the right one, but so very rewarding.” With a snap the measuring tape very suddenly retracts and Ollivander pockets it. His expression looked distant, like he was thinking in some other world, and he turns away to start rummaging through the boxes. “The wand picks the owner, you see, so let us try out a few options.”
“That’s it, Potter!” Draco scrambles to grab his wand, Potter quickly springing to his feet, grinning, and ducking out of the compartment. Half-hysterical laughter escapes the Boy-Who-Lived-To-Infuriate-Draco-Malfoy as he runs down the hall, Draco leaning out the compartment to fire hexes after him. He only returns to his compartment, shutting the door tight behind him, when other students’ heads begin peeking out into the hall, looking for the source of the commotion.
“Don’t know. I refuse to open it,” Harry grumbles, “It’s clear he just wants an excuse to rush off into danger, and I’m not going to give it to him. I’m not going to
“We’re in a hall filled with beasts we’ll likely never see again. Sorry to sound like Hagrid, but what did you expect me to do?” Weasley snaps back. They’ve both managed to get to their feet by now and are struggling to continue down the hall, tracking water everywhere.
“Salazar’s wand, no!” Draco turns to look at Potter in disbelief, “Not unless your Militus is a dragon itself, which it probably isn’t! I am suggesting it be used to distract the dragon, give it something else to fight with for a bit. Whatever you need to do, at least you’ll have some time with this.”
It is as Leandra is pulling back the book, looking particularly confused, that the wards wobble and Granger makes her appearance. Almost immediately the bushy-haired girl has zeroed in on the mysterious heirloom, clearly seeing how Leandra had been retrieving it from showing Draco, and her whole body seizes up.
Draco can’t help but feel like a hypocrite the more he looks at his Militus and he isn’t sure what to do about that.
Draco knows that Harry had a lesson. They were on a strict schedule and Draco was often prepared for Harry to join him in the Slytherin dorm rooms afterwards. Hell, the other Slytherin boys knew, by now, that Harry had occlumency lessons on Mondays and Wednesdays.
“Me? Well, my shoulder is healing, you already know that--” Draco begins, a little perplexed, but Harry shakes his head.
It takes Draco a little while to figure out where Eve’s apartment actually is, however, because the numbers feel like they don’t make sense to him and he doubles back on more than one occasion.
“I…” Draco falters, voice high as he processed what this could all mean. “I think it could have been Sinistra.”
“I wouldn’t really classify you as a ‘beast’,” Potter says, smiling innocently when Draco’s glare lands on him.
The trunk begins to shake violently again, screams coming from within despite being opened wide, and Draco yelps before glaring at it. “I’m working on it, okay?” he snaps and, because he felt vindicated at this point, stuffs the invisibility cloak into his satchel. This all probably belonged to the interloper anyway, so who cared if he took some things?
This lock does not open as easily, but it does not require a Shockwave Spell to burst it open, either. This time, Draco’s small Reductor Curse is enough to make the lock spring open and the lid to snap up.
“Max. Apologies for cutting to the chase, but is your brother there? Longbottom could use a pep talk,” Draco requests, smirking over when the Gryffindor looks back at him, eyes wide and frantic.
“You can’t adopt every stray you see, you know,” he hisses and she looks unaffected, simply pulling out her book once more.
“Ah, sorry, sorry, didn’t mean to scare you!” says the boy with a smile that looks rather sheepish, “Nice hair, by the way.”
“They aren’t? Don’t you still go to… to that school on Sundays?” Draco demands, feeling himself grow confused.
Tracey perks up at that, just a little, and says, “What you see is what you know, until you know what you see. Luna said that once.” Draco thinks he actually remembers the Ravenclaw saying that, too.
“You figure any of them out?” Draco asks, moving to grab Tootsie’s cage and set it up next. Hermione coo’s at the bird sweetly, making the pale wizard roll his eyes.
The next worst part of the month is that he hardly gets to speak to Max or their family. With all the work he puts in during the day, far more than he has consistently done ever, he just wants to go straight to bed when he gets home. He has attempted conversation while lying under his covers, warning Max he’s bound to drift off at any time, then proceeding to fall asleep in the middle of a Max Ramble.
After the last school year Draco had found more comfort in his solitude than anything else. Crabbe and Goyle were more frustrating than ever and he denied every offer his parents gave for them to drop by or vice versa. And speaking of his parents, they wouldn’t stop “reassuring” him that all would work out for their family in the long run. They were right to assume Draco was pulling away from them. They were wrong to assume why.
Max is silent for a moment and Draco wonders, momentarily, if he’s snapped too hard at them. Their voice filters through a second later, however, and it sounds faint with wonder. “The meaning of life is to answer the question, ‘what is the meaning of life?’ Damn, Draco, that’s deep. Who knew you had it in you!”
Draco takes that moment to come up beside Potter and throw an arm around his shoulder, enjoying the jump he feels through the other boy, and leans towards his ear. “Hey there, roomie,” he smirks, and Potter turns wide, aghast eyes on him.
Draco feels a little bit like Max, thinking about some of the rants they’d gone on when it came to animals. They’d felt so strongly about everything, but animals they could go on for hours about without fail.
“With everyone’s consent, I could cast the curse as needed,” Draco offers, but his eyes are still on Potter, who very abruptly turns fully towards him and is moving to grab his wrist.
He heaves a breath, the air burning on the way down, then tosses his satchel and camera into a poorly lit corner before dashing down the Astronomy Tower steps. He’s not thinking - he’s even aware that he’s not thinking as he continues to not think - but he just can’t control himself as his mind keeps jumping around.
The flash of green through Draco’s camera lens makes him scream, lurching backwards and dropping the camera with a clatter. He knew that green flash. Any witch or wizard with a half decent knowledge of curses would know it. Draco had even seen it recently in his Defense Against the Dark Arts class.
“Oh, I would pay to see that. You should be interested, Weasley. If you were his manager maybe you would be able to pay for a new uniform.”
“Want to go up to the Astronomy Tower and talk to Max?” Draco asks after a few beats of awkward silence, and Potter sags with a breath of relief, finally looking up and nodding.
“Correct. Five points to Slytherin. What is the difference between Astronomy and Astrology?” That one is answered by Padma, earning Ravenclaw five points, and a few more questions are thrown around, each correct answer earning that student’s house five points.
Draco doesn’t know who yells the spell, only that they are close enough to be heard and now, gleaming sinisterly in the sky above, is the Dark Mark. HIS mark, reappearing again for the first time since the dark lord’s demise.
Looking behind him, slowly, Draco finds none other than Mrs. Norris, puffed up and back arched and red eyes hungry for death as she stares Draco down.
“I just sprayed canned cheese up my nose two days ago just to see what would happen! Do I seem like the kind of person who should be making
Potter keeps smiling, and despite it being a warm, summer day he wears the beanie their Muggle family sent him, which is black with a gold
Eventually, before either can even begin to formulate a conversation, Eve and her mother are coming back and making suggestions for dinner. Ms. Hushburn wants to cook for them, but they’re all so hungry and worn out that they really don’t want to wait, so Draco gets to experience the Muggle invention “pizza” for the first time.
“Bumpkin,” he mumbles, just loud enough for the other boy to hear him, and Weasley looks over sharply, his brows up in his hairline from surprise. Then, slowly, Weasley’s shoulders sag and he smiles ruefully, shaking his head.
Draco scoffs, shaking out his head and walking alongside the other Slytherins, trying to focus on the class instead of his personal issues.
“Teachers have my sympathy,” the bespectacled boy grumbles, still looking down at his parchment where he’d scribbled out schedule after schedule, uncertain what would flow best.
“The Ministry and the mediwitches will keep researching this new and fascinating phenomenon, because that’s what they do, and maybe one day we’ll be able to wake Sirius back up. None of this is ideal, Harry… but at least this way you’ve given Sirius a chance.”
“You have all the weekend to do that,” Harry groans when Draco returns and takes a seat in a large, wing-backed chair. “Why are you doing it now?”
For the rest of the evening Draco works on his homework, occasionally getting dragged into helping Sophie or telling Tracey that, “No, I haven’t heard of a spell that makes your skin venomous. No, I will not help you look it up,” or finally getting Harry to join in and just write a little of his History of Magic essay. It does a good job of distracting him, but eventually, as he lies in bed awake, Draco can’t keep his mind from wandering back to that Gringotts article.
Then he hears the sound of a bug. Heavy, buzzing wings. Draco peaks around the corner and spies what looks like… a beetle? On a windowsill? That can’t be right. He’s never seen an insect quite like that native to this area, and Draco has been taking all kinds of pictures around the grounds for years now. In addition, it is the middle of winter, snow is on the ground, a beetle shouldn’t be crawling around at this time.
The three of them are silent for a few moment, Draco keeping a straight face, Potter smirking, and Weasley looking even more lost than before. Then Draco’s taking a deep breath and his head falls, “Nevermind, this is already awful.”
“Yeah, but I’m the one that has to live with him,” Draco whines, sagging, then pouts when he hears Harry laugh.
The trio begins walking back towards their class, Potter snagging Draco’s arm as they pass and dragging him along. “I can walk on my own,” he snaps grumpily.
When Draco is just turned fifteen, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned, and Lucius Malfoy is sighted as one of the Death Eaters that returned to his side… Draco must accept that the real monsters out there may very well be wearing his father’s face.
Sinistra even manages to chase Umbridge off when she comes up to observe, saying something along the lines of, “If you feel lacking in the field of wandless magic, Dolores, I will be happy to fill in the gaps. Uagadou is best at this practice, after all.” Somehow, with Sinistra’s empty voice, the words seem even more biting, and Umbridge excuses herself in a huff.
The girl is slouched over, both hands over her mouth, trying desperately to not break out laughing in the middle of the café, her shoulders shaking and tears in her eyes.
“It’s a spectacular opportunity,” he tries, sitting in the plush chair across from Umbridge’s desk. “To learn the techniques of an entirely different wizarding school? Who would turn something like that down?”
“Ah, actually, no,” Max’s father says, looking to the photo, “That would be very impossible back then.”
Draco didn’t have some sixth, Potter sense, yet somehow he still managed to find Potter when he ran away. Sometimes he was alone, sometimes with Granger and Weasley. Sometimes they would all end up going walking, sometimes they would sit and eat an inappropriate amount of candy, sometimes Draco would play violin for them, sometimes Granger and Potter would watch Weasley wipe the floor with Draco in wizard’s chess - despite Draco’s claims he allowed the ginger to win, the trio still laughed at him - sometimes, if no one was anywhere near, Draco would shift and let Potter cling to him like a security blanket…
Then, a tiny tug at the base of his robes and a soft, familiar, “Young Master Draco? I’m here to retrieve you.” Draco turns around then looks down, surprised to find Tana standing before him. He supposes, with the whole mess with Lucius, that Narcissa might not be ready  to face public society just yet, so sending a house elf would make sense…
“Well… well… well…” Umbridge says, voice pitched high and sweet, and her eyes twinkle in vicious, vicious victory. She looks like a monster, like the ones in stories and fairy tales.
There’s a bang on the other end of the connection, like Max might have hit something, and Draco snaps his mouth shut, his eyes wide. How was someone even supposed to respond to that? How could anyone? It hadn’t even been directed at Draco and it left him feeling nauseous. How had Max dealt with something like that in the moment?
“Perfect, you’re awake,” Crabbe says, “We wanted to ask if you could get Granger to proofread these.” Both boys then hold out their parchments to Harry, who numbly takes them before they can be smacked into his face, his expression shell-shocked.
Lucius had wanted to go to the Quidditch World Cup right as it was starting, completely avoiding the crowds and the vendors, but Draco had wanted otherwise. This would be Draco’s first time going to a World Cup and he wanted to walk around, particularly away from his father, and enjoy the entire evening, even though it was sure to be filthy and exhausting.
After that, Eve has a dark python slipping from her wand, the massive thing slithering around the feet of the DA and tripping some of them up. The Slytherin girl cackles, a little hysterical, as she follows her Militus around, bright-eyed and excited.
Sinistra’s office was just down the corridor from the Astronomy Tower. The door looked like any others in the castle save for the single, silver star that hung on the front. Harry was the one to reach out and knock, but before his knuckles even touch wood the door opens inward on its own. The two boys look to each other, the dread pooling in their chests wanting to overflow.
He had, apparently, remembered that only himself and Voldemort could touch it and, despite his curiosity, had thought it better than to even mess with it until he knew what was going on.
Which immediately sets off alarm bells in Draco’s head, thinking he is about to have to listen to the lecture to end all lectures, except once Narcissa is gone Lucius is simply telling Draco to retrieve the portkey he used to arrive earlier.
“Understatement,” Draco mumbles, trying desperately to dig his mind out of the downward spiral it was quickly taking. His eyes flick to the redhead, who is turning red-faced as Hermione tears him a new one. “He… he sees things in black and white a lot, I reckon?” Mrs. Nubble said, often, that the law may see a lot of things in black and white, but people just weren’t like that in reality. It had always been one of her less liked facts about being a lawyer.
“She wasn’t after me, right? She only stunned me,” Vivian is saying and finally she pulls her hand from her bag, something gripped tightly in her fist. “I can go down and see if the coast is clear. You two should find a place to hide until I message you on this.” She hands over whatever she’s holding to Harry, and when Draco leans over to look at it he sees a chunky, black walkie-talkie. “These things are garbage if you wanna have a conversation,” Vivian sighs, “But I can get a word or two to you. If I say the word bad, don’t come down. If I say good, you’re in the clear.”
Now, as the OWLs were drawing closer, Draco was beginning to see what she meant, and they hadn’t even taken the tests yet.
Also, fun fact, the stories about Max's school are all actual things that have happened to myself. They were such ridiculous stories I felt they had to be included somewhere.
“That could be quite helpful,” Draco observes, being honest, but scowls the moment the ginger looks at him with his stupid grin.
The Hufflepuff looks up at Draco, cheeks puffing out as she pouts, expression unhappy. “No, I am not. This is important to me and I will not squander my family name for the sake of curiosity,” she says, huffier than usual. Probably because Granger wouldn’t stop asking to read it and Draco was an asshole who liked to push people’s buttons.
“Oh my god, who cares if it’s not a cone? It’s the same process!” Eve groans, rolling her eyes skyward, then focusing on Potter again with a more pleasant smile. “That’s really clever, actually. So many spells have such simple ways of circumventing them if you just approach them from a different angle.”
Draco chances a glance back at the student body. He makes eye contact with Granger and Weasley first, the two of them clearly having spotted Moody as well, and they exchange a nod. Draco also spots Eve, Pansy, and Blaise removing their wands, clearly ready to start mischief as they smirk at each.
“They’re already getting teased by some of the boys, so don’t you start either,” Hermione warns, glaring over at the blonde, and he raises his hands in surrender. “And speaking of boys!” Hermione’s voice was rising, and it almost seemed like her hair was puffing up as she got more frustrated. “Neville is fine, even if he keeps his distance, and Greg and Vincent are kind, young men… But the other three? They’re so… They’re such… BOYS!”
“You reckless, foolish, idiot of a boy!” Granger flails her hands uselessly, like she wants to smack Draco, or strangle him, or something along those lines.
“I am familiar with the Militus Charm,” Sinistra nods and Draco feels some of his tense nerves wash out of his body in relief. Professor Sinistra, the quiet, withdrawn Astronomy teacher, was full of surprises.
“Oh, really, now?” Ginny smirks, a mischievous glint to her eyes that looks a little dangerous, too. “Harry,” she looks to the Boy-Who-Lived, “Don’t worry about a thing. I’ve got this handled.”
“I do,” she replies, not letting Skeeter’s attitude get to her. “I want you to interview Harry on everything that happened to him during the Triwizard Tournament.”
“Potter,” he greets coldly when the other boy is finally within range, and Potter clearly scowls angrily.
They keep moving closer to the massive structure until the boats are rolling underneath the castle to a hidden dock where they all clamber out, a new excitement rolling through the group. “Alrigh’, calm down the lot o’ yeh,” Hagrid collects their attention, but he seems mostly amused by the young witches and wizards and their boundless energy. He leads them up to a large door that creaks when he pulls it open to reveal Professor McGonagall in all her stern, composed glory. “Here’s the firs’ years for yeh, Professor,” Hagrid says, his chest puffed out, and the woman nods once at him.
“Mouthful…” Ada mumbles and Draco has to agree with her, but she is ultimately ignored save for a scathing glance from McGonagall.
Harry doesn’t say anything, just nods a greeting, clearly not certain he can trust this man just yet. Draco hates to admit it, but he’s on the same boat. He has no idea why Duke would be here.
Max was panicking, which was weird. Draco had known them for years, but in the middle of August in 1995 Max began their own school year…
Although… it did give him a bit of an idea. His Reductor Curse was clearly not powerful enough, but perhaps he could manage something small?
The following evening Draco found himself scowling at his dinner, Harry beside him not looking much better. They had only just come in from their first meeting with Marcus Flint and both boys agreed the guy was a complete tool. “Cliché jock” almost seemed like too nice a term for him.
Everything feels normal again, they no longer appear to be standing on a wall, and instead find themselves in a positively HUGE hall. The walls are made of glass and the vaulted ceiling is so high up Draco sees birds flying above them but can’t identify them from this distance. There are doors that line the hall, and thanks to the glass walls they can see that the doors lead into equally sized glass domes, each with a compressed world within. The immediate one to their right appears to be a swamp of some kind, and the one to their left is completely underwater.
“Is it really that big of a deal?” he questions, feeling oddly defensive. He really didn’t need Hermione gushing over him for this. He didn’t even DO anything. If he wanted Hermione to start praising him, he wanted it to be over something legitimate.
There’s noise to his side, from the radio, but Draco can’t hear it. It is all garbled and distant, like someone yelling through water. Then there’s noise in front of him, but he can’t hear that either.
“This isn’t working,” Harry suddenly cuts in, looking sullen, his shoulders sagging, as he comes over to the table and plops down at Draco’s empty side. He slouches in his seat, watching as Weasley keeps attempting, growing more and more furious.
“I didn’t realize you two lived together,” Draco says while trying to set up a spreadsheet for his future BSL lessons. He was already learning more than he’d planned just from sitting and talking to the two boys.
“You mind if we start with Algebra? It’s the next test I’ve got,” Max says and Draco shrugs, even though he can’t be seen.
“Yeah, Draco?” Max asks, sounding a little absent. They were both working on their individual homework, Draco getting to occasionally hear very frustrated grumblings about numbers and angles.
I've wanted to explore a lot of cultures in the Harry Potter universe while writing Radiowave and I'm finally getting the chance to in this chapter! With that in mind: if you see anything that is blatantly wrong (y'know outside of all the magic of course) or you want to clear anything up about your culture that I try to depict? Let me know! The last thing I want to do is insult someone when I'm trying to bring awareness and world building!
The world shifts, shrinking and collapsing and reasserting itself as Draco springs up, body expanding, clothes re-emerging, and limbs wobbly. Very wobbly.
When the article does drop the whole castle is abuzz. Up until then it had only been a rumor that a body had been found in Hogsmeade, but now everyone knows.
The clouds have yet to fully dissipate, but aren’t as thick, and Sinistra raises a hand and waves it once through the air, the clouds moving out of the way like she was simply wiping them off a window. And without a single word or wand. She then turns back to the class and begins her lesson on the stars and a few choice constellations.
“Be right with you,” a man’s voice calls. The blonde startles, holding Tootsie’s cage a little tighter, and the owl hoots at him to be more careful. He pouts down at her, sets the cage beside McGonagall, then walks further into the store. He peeks down one line of shelves just in time to see an old man with silver hair and beard stepping off a stool and walking towards him. His eyes are pale and silvery with a deep knowledge Draco has no idea how to fathom.
“Have fun up there, Potter?” he jeers, smirking when he gains his target’s attention. “You really need to work on your bad boy glower. That? Up there? That was terrible! I could see right through to your candy floss heart.” Potter glares up at him immediately, only making Draco smirk wider. “Yes, yes, that’s the one! Just imagine the camera’s me and you’ll do splendid.”
“I am here for the game. Who wins is of little interest,” Draco responds, then narrows his eyes. “Why are you speaking to me? Have you nothing better to do?”
“Oh, no, because they’re herders,” Eve keeps smirking, “They tell all the other animals what to do.”
Draco, for a while, stares at Potter even more, head shifting through emotions. Then, slowly, his expression changes to something harder as an unexplainable anger washes over him. He isn’t sure why he’s so angry all of a sudden, but he immediately knows what he’s going to do.
Draco arches a brow. “I do not have a cast, and that example is shockingly specific. Are you speaking from experience?”
“You’re in the Ministry, father! Could you get them to do something ‘beneficial’?” Draco brightens, eagerly waiting for his father to reply. His father was powerful and demanding, both at home and at work. Draco wanted to be just like him.
Draco stares back, frozen, but then Harry is breaking away and moving towards him at a march. Draco hops down, shifts back into a human, and then has his arms full of Harry.
“It probably was left somewhere, then. Likely Ravenclaw Tower. If she wasn’t planning on coming to the meeting that night she wouldn’t have needed her Galleon, right?” the boy wonder suggests, the rest of their group falling silent in consideration. It was a logical assumption. Draco couldn’t guess where else the Galleon might be. He wasn’t lying when he’d said Umbridge would brag about a find like that.
Draco reaches out to trace the words with a finger, cutting the girl off and ignoring her unhappy huff. Their colors were green and silver, their element was water, their common room was somewhere in the dungeon, and most importantly their mascot was a serpent. Draco’s eyes widen and he remembers his family vault with the silver snakes and emerald eyes. This… this had to be the house his parents had been in.
It is getting closer and closer to the time for the DA to meet, however, and Draco knows that he and the twins will be missed if they don’t show up. It could set off a panic in the group that could end up being unfounded if Edgecombe didn’t just do anything already.
“Invisibility cloaks are fragile,” Eve says, watching how the air seems to warp around the “invisible” parts of Theodore and Tracey’s bodies. “Expanding it like we did likely strains the magic.”
Once Harry has been tied up, Draco lowers his wand and glances around, taking proper stock of the room. Weasley and Longbottom are still being held by Verteaux and Goyle, but now Hermione, Ginny, and Luna have been gagged while their hands are held viciously behind them by Pansy, Montague, and Theodore. The rest of the Inquisitorial Squad lingers against the walls, watching Umbridge approach Harry in the center of her office.
Slowly, blessedly, the shaking does begin to dwindle, Potter’s hands having found their way to curl into Draco’s pajama shirt, and the Boy-Who-Lived begins to slip back into the realm of sleep.
Except it seemed he just wasn’t going to get very lucky today because Theodore begins to smirk, vicious and cruel, and takes a single step forward to a lower stand. “I will. What do I have to worry about? You’ll only just end up running away in the end and I can go back to bed.”
doesn’t even know how he’s going to respond; he just knows Potter shouldn’t be afraid of him like this.
Tracey and Weasley are the last two to go and, while in the Locked Room, Harry pulls off his cloak for just a moment to breathe. He looks like he’s jittering with adrenaline, but his eyes are glowing with hope and excitement. Draco can’t mirror that feeling, his tail swishing nervously.
The memory of him tricking the Dursley’s over the summer to allow Harry a chance to be a teenage boy. The memory of Draco charging at Barty Crouch Jr in his animagus form, attacking the dark wizard to get Harry away from him. He thinks of outsmarting the Minister in third year to free Sirius and condemn Peter Pettigrew, all at Harry’s request. He thinks of catching Harry before he fell to his death during a Quidditch game, surrounded by dementors.
He shrugs helplessly and, with one fluid motion, shifts into a snow leopard. Not a moment after does he realize something is very, very wrong. Professor McGonagall had mentioned that, as an animal, Draco would become more aware of the environment around him. Yes, his senses would be enhanced, but he would also notice a heightened sense when it came to barometric pressure. It was how most animals became aware of natural disasters long before they hit.
Skeeter swallows, eyes wide, and Draco notices he’s begun to lean forward so he straightens himself out and clears his throat. “But… this is all just ‘pretend’… Right?” He doesn’t wait for an answer, “Right. Well, I’m off to work damage control. Ta-ta, Skeeter!” And he turns around and stalks out of the room, posture a far cry from his serene expression.
“Maybe peak tourist season really isn’t a good time to look for peace and quiet,” Potter says with an arched brow and they both turn to head back to the road and call the Knight Bus back to pick them up.
He makes his way over, as requested, and finds Snape already waiting for him, looking as dour and unhappy as ever. “Mr. Malfoy,” he begins, which tells Draco this is a serious conversation, not a friendly one. Or as friendly as Severus Snape can be.
Then, with a final pat to Draco’s shoulder, he turns and leaves. Draco shifts towards the door, moving to close it, and whispering to the beetle still hidden under the hood of his robes, “Keep tabs on him.” The beetle swiftly buzzes through the door and Draco shuts it, releasing a sigh and sagging.
Harry had always had a darker skin tone, but usually Draco only compared these kinds of things to himself and didn’t think beyond that. That left
Then, feeling confident and pleased and certain no crowds of wizards would materialize out of nowhere if he said this, he outstretches his hand and says, “I’m Draco Malfoy, by the way.” Mr. and Mrs. Nubble had always said a good introduction was important for making friends and connections alike. Always be direct and firm, have a strong handshake, and smile just enough to be comfortable.
Weasley quickly reddens when everyone’s attention shifts to him, but he steadies himself and attempts to speak. “Well, with all the young wizards - and witch - in the house we were always trying to one-up each other… Charlie was always the most creative with that stuff, but Percy always had more success getting things to work. It was never anything that impressive, though.”
He regularly had tea with Umbridge, usually the day of a DA meeting so as to get a read on her knowledge over the secret organization. So far, she was none-the-wiser, but that still meant Draco had to listen to her vitriol. Draco hated to think that at any time of his life he’d sounded anything like this woman.
“Yeah, Eric, those babies need a new mommy!” Max says, voice encouraging as the crying begins to die down a bit.
“Harry,” Draco says softly, hand moving down Harry’s arm to circle his wrist, pressing against the pulse, and raising his other hand to cup Harry’s jaw. The lion’s heart is fast and wild, a complete contrast to the quiet shock of his body, and it worries Draco. What on earth had happened?
“Then you should work on your spell work,” Draco advises, then opens up his satchel and starts digging around in it. “Here. Look over this. Granger can show you how to identify the safe spells for you to learn.”
“That’s just a kink, that’s not special.” Eve snorts and Leandra squawks beside her, swatting at her arm, which only succeeds in making her girlfriend grin and cackle in response.
In the end Draco decides to grab the Turbo XX from his room and head outside to practice. Harry called him a natural on the broom, but Draco knew he still had plenty of work to do.
“Hmm, just thinking. I just turned thirteen. Can you believe we’ve known each other for more than half our lives?” Max sounds wistful and distant, but in a good way. They sound like they’re in a daydream.
“The Black family… I thought I was a Malfoy,” Draco finally hisses, brows pinching more and more in confusion.
“I…” Draco pauses to take a deep breath, running a hand through his hair. The shaved parts were getting quite long again. “I apologize as well. While I still stand by the fact that you should be more aware of your actions I, perhaps, approached things too… antagonistically.”
“Just a couple new varieties on their sickly sweets, or whatever they’re calling them now,” Lee shrugs.
“They don’t,” Draco mumbles, only half listening, but is then pulled out of his thoughts by a tap at the window. Both boys look over at a giant, hairy man holding ice cream cones that look comically small in his hands. He’s smiling in at the other boy and, before he can consider his wording, Draco comments, “Look at that! What does an oaf like that want?”
“I suppose not,” Draco agrees, wincing a little bit at Sophie’s quick movements. She’s a little rougher than Eve, but also seems more assured. “We’ve never hung out much outside classes. I know you excel in Transfiguration and Charms, but that’s about it.”
“Do you truly believe I wouldn’t say anything if I didn’t want you around? What, to spare your feelings?
“Merlin’s beard! What is wrong with your face?!” he yelps in alarm, pointing at the Ravenclaw’s face. Edgecombe stutters, losing track of herself, before reaching up to touch her forehead in confusion. She yelps in surprise, then groans in mild pain, and swiftly retracts her hands, her eyes wide with shock and horror.
“What about the others?” he demands, strength slowly returning to his voice. Madam Pomfrey’s lips thin a bit, but then she’s stepping away from the bed. Draco wants to demand she come back, but almost immediately new faces are taking her place.
“I don’t know…” the Gryffindor whispers, “You flinched and I suddenly had to do something, but there isn’t anything I can do, anymore.” Draco feels the other’s fingers curl into fists against his stomach. The pain and shock has finally faded enough that Draco can really look at Harry, process that he’s real and standing right in front of him, and take in just how stunningly beautiful he is.
“Hogwarts, like the disease?” Draco interrupts and immediately feels like he could smack himself. Really? That’s where he went? He couldn’t ask how the woman knew his name? No, he had to ask whether Frederick’s comment was true.
Watching his godfather mess with the Gryffindors at every turn was one of Draco’s favorite pastimes, but this was even better. This time it was because of Draco that these self-righteous felines were getting what was coming to them.
“We’re doing better,” Harry offers, finally sitting up straight to look back at the girls. “Are you guys okay? We heard what you did.”
The goblin removes the key and hands it back to McGonagall, who hands it to Draco. “Keep that safe,” she tells him and he nods, twisting to put it into a secure pocket on his backpack while the goblin shoves the door the rest of the way open.
They wouldn’t be able to fix it, but they could make it easier. That was the point of all of this. Soon, things would become far less controllable. Chaos was just around the bend, and not the fun kind. They needed to enjoy this calm before the storm while it lasted.
“Then we get some extra sleep in,” comes a muffled, agitated voice from Theodore’s bed and they look over to see him glaring at them, still laying down. “Which I would quite like to have considering we don’t have a first period today, so shut up and get lost already.”
Ada Babbage was the middle foster child and had chaotic, dark curls she kept in a ponytail, sharp, clever blue eyes, and a rebellious, uncaring streak that put her at odds with Frederick on more than one occasion. She would probably be Draco’s favorite, if one could say he had favorites. Yes, they all looked out for each other. Yes, the Nubbles took good care of them. Yes, Frederick, Ada, and Draco shared an experience not many others could understand. That didn’t make them “family.” They didn’t feel like that to Draco, and apparently the same went for the other two kids.
A new development that also came during the summer was the Muggle care packages. Although… perhaps “care package” was a bit too generous. Really, it was just Max finding out about a Muggle candy Draco had never tried, assumed it was because he was English, then sent him a small box stuffed hazardously with bags of all kinds of sweets.
Eve’s blue eyes are unimpressed when Draco smiles back at her, her arms crossed. Draco can see black, leather gloves covering her hands, but he doesn’t comment on them.
Then there had been Winky, who had once been Barty Crouch’s house elf but was now here. She was properly distraught by the predicament, despite Granger attempting to teach her about her rights, when she had mentioned how much she hated Ludo Bagman.
And then, as sudden as it started, the figures stop. They go completely still in their twisted positions and the twirling of the room stills. For a moment, everything is motionless, including the teenagers, but then the blacks and whites of the room begin to meld again. The colors smear and dull until they are back to the calmer, neutral grey.
Except everything isn’t exactly sunshine and roses for the Gryffindor trio, which is made abundantly clear when Eve and Draco join Granger in the library.
Apparently, Muggles had a different meaning for WW. “World War 2.” Draco wants to scoff. A world war? Oh, please. A war that spanned the globe, not one but two, and he had never heard about it? What a joke. Muggles were probably just entertaining themselves with some made up story. He’d admit, it was probably famous if it was getting its own museum, but it seemed ridiculous. Muggles were ridiculous.
“Her mother is in the Ministry, isn’t she?” Pansy questions from her place in her bed. Draco had been dragged into the fifth-year girl’s dorm room by Eve, who wanted to spruce up his undercut before the winter break. Draco had argued at first, seeing as he was trying to look like the perfect pureblood right now, but Eve had reminded him that there were ways of styling his hair to look all nice, proper, and boring.
There appears to be some instinctive knowledge within his new body, and although he trips up a few times, face planting and tumbling with a litany of angry squeaks, he’s able to get the hang of sprinting through the tall grass as fast as he can.
“Where does Umbridge think I am?” he demands instead, because he needs to know what part he will play.
Draco doesn’t know how to take any of it. Not only was someone sending him letters on the regular, but he hadn’t been able to read a single one, and his anger was mounting. He kept catching himself glaring at his foster parents whenever he could, furious with them no matter how much they thought they were doing the right thing. The right thing sucked, and he wanted his letters already.
They’d had plans for so many scenarios, but this? With the enemy already breathing down their necks? They had no plan for this. Draco had no plan for this. What was he supposed to do? He had to think on his toes, but he was frozen where he stood. What could he do?!
“I nodded off…” Potter begins, sheepish, and one of his hands discreetly curls into Draco’s robes as he speaks. Draco doesn’t comment on it. “I’ve been having dreams sometimes… of Voldemort.” The rest of them flinch at the name, but Potter keeps going. “He’s always so angry, talking about plans or people doing things wrong, and I always wake up with my scar burning.”
, you know. I talked to Professor Potter and Hermione had been right, our potion was wrong, and then I heard she hadn’t shown up to her classes and…” Pansy sighs, eyes moving from Draco to Hermione. “I didn’t mean to make you cry. Irritate you, maybe. Get you off my back, definitely. Not cry…”
then spins around to glare furiously at Harry Potter. “Why do you insist on sneaking up on me like that?!” he demands, voice shrill, and Potter grins at him.
“An astute observation, Granger. Tell me, have you noticed the sky is blue again today? Apologies if that blows your mind.”
“Families are complicated,” Draco says with a deep sigh, shoulders sagging, which jostles Potter but the boy doesn’t move, apparently still comfortable leaning against Draco.
At the end of the DA meeting Harry begins wrapping everything up and offering some final remarks. “We’ll keep up with the speed we’re at, but I’d like to, soon, begin work on the Patronus Charm.” An excited murmur ripples through the room, the students immediately brightening up at the concept, and Harry waits for silence. “It’ll take a few more lessons, but go ahead and start thinking about the happiest memory you can think of. Write a few down if you have to, and…”
“Right…” Draco says slowly, eyes thinning. “Let’s say I actually believed you,” he begins, ignoring the affronted look on his boyfriend’s face, “do you have a decent explanation why you were so intent on staring off into the middle distance? You looked like a soldier back from war.”
“I think it’s sweet Neville’s found someone he can talk so freely to,” Harry says, trying to make Draco feel better even with the laughter in his voice, but the blond only groans louder.
“Deal,” he agrees and then they make their way out of the hall with a good-bye to a few of the Gryffindors that had been talking with them. They begin walking in the direction of the owlery, taking their time since they don’t have their first period class, and continue chatting.
“Well, we better hurry to Potions if we don’t want to be late,” she announces and grudgingly Harry and Ron agree, standing as well. Draco is already up, excitement coursing through his veins as they make their way towards the dungeons. Potions, aka magic chemistry, here he comes.
Draco looks to the black orb in the center of the room, sitting completely silent, like nothing has happened. Like
Skeeter has taken a step back, not expecting this kind of threatening from a teenager, but Draco isn’t finished. “I have never trusted you, and you have never trusted me, but now allow me to put that into words. You will never be able to trust me because the moment, the
The burning feels more pointed as it goes on, for minutes, hours, days, he doesn’t know, but now it feels like it is moving with a purpose, the reassembly given a form and meaning that slowly takes shape within Draco’s mind.
What it had really been about was his father attempting to stomp down on werewolf rights, calling them a threat to everyone else, and Draco had repeated what Lucius had said in Muggle terms.
I do this with all my other stories so I'm gonna do it here too. Chapter song! Sometimes it'll play into the theme of the chapter, other times it is what I was listening to while writing, or maybe it's just something I wanted to share with y'all!
Draco rolls his eyes and finally turns away from the display to pull out his other bag of M&M’s. Potter eyes him with an arched brow.
“Harry, no,” Granger says, shaking her head and moving as if she wants to come sit with her friend. “This isn’t your fault.”
“Oh, I think Harry will hand over that prophecy if he wants his friends to stop hurting, don’t you think?”
“Just fine, Tana. Take this book and put it with the rest in my closet, will you?” he holds the book out without looking at it. He had bookshelves, but his Muggle books couldn’t go there, they stood out too much. The records he could hide, but not the books so often in paperback.
“Well, count me in!” Vivian grins right back, “I can get to Sinistra easier than you two, so we can work as a team on this.”
“Got some good news right before this session,” Draco replies, trying to fight off a grin. Sinistra stares at him a moment, unmoving and considering, before nodding.
“Pureblood wizarding family unassociated with the Sacred Twenty-Eight,” Draco replies. He knew just about every pureblood family name in the UK. He knew which ones were high-standing, which were mediocre, which were blood-traitors, and which were outsiders. The Kader family were outsiders, having come in from Egypt a few generations back. “I’ve never heard of any particular heirlooms of theirs, however.”
prat. Can everybody stop asking me already?” Harry snaps, hackles rising as he takes a look around the table, clearly having noticed Granger and Weasley’s looks.
“Don’t you love it?” Harry says wistfully at his side, also peering over the edge, but his eyes are locked on the horizon, and Draco scowls at him.
“They’re delicious!” Max adds, grinning just as brightly. Draco eyes them suspiciously, considering the strange food combination. That didn’t sound very delicious…
He had been unable to sneak down over the break, namely because he’d found out about the Lung Dragon near the end of it all and he’d used his remaining days to scout out the Department of Mysteries. Plus, if he suddenly disappeared for hours on end Duke wouldn’t be able to efficiently cover him. This was all fine, thought, especially when he’d started planning and managed to nab some of his father’s specialized floo powder.
McGonagall turns to the remaining four students, her eyes only marginally softer. “You all are lucky to have survived this, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win your house five points and Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”
“I think it shimmied a little, but that might just be the wind,” Potter grumbles, then looks over at him. “You?”
“What is going on over there?” Draco demands almost immediately, worried something had happened and someone might be hurt.
When they finally bid good-bye and Draco slips the radio back into his bag, shrunken down and hidden, he sighs and rubs his own brow. “They are going to lose those glasses so many times,” he mumbles.
“No argument there,” Draco shrugs, then crosses his arms. “But his goal? Was to get a rise out of you. And you gave that to him.”
“Well, he has his godfather, who’s fighting for custody, but there’s some legal problems keeping him back,” Draco sighs, thinking of Sirius, alone in his hated, childhood home, struggling with Ministry red tape.
As usually, he was regularly looking after her, keeping track of her movements, and this time Draco goes still when he sees just how pale and sickly the girl has gotten. She’s fidgeting in her seat, looking repeatedly to Cho Chang beside her, then looks over at the staff table. She hasn’t told on them, Granger’s jinxed parchment would have gone into effect if she had, but…
“You know, you weren’t this angry when he and I were fighting earlier,” Potter says suspiciously, then quiets down when Granger swings around to glare at him.
Draco smirks, applauding Granger’s cursing capabilities, and catches Edgecombe’s eye for a moment. She’s horrified again, tears rolling down her face, and it is clear she won’t be saying much else until she manages to calm down.
Trying to cover just how unbalanced he feels over this, Draco smirks thinly and says, “I like you begging for my help. Do it more.”
Potter was never told, it wouldn’t do to have him fretting over Barty Crouch lurking in unknown corners of the school, unseen but scheming, and Draco was able to continue to investigate in peace.
“You need to lay off the treacle tart, Potter,” Draco grunts to himself, trying to keep from losing his balance, but then, because the universe can’t give Draco a break, Potter’s spiraling Nimbus 2000, now without owner, nails Draco right in the face. It flings stars into his vision and makes it very hard to breathe through his nose all of a sudden.
Her expression was now carefully held together, stern and cold, and they all waited with bated breath for her to speak.
“Nothing... Nothing,” Umbridge is snarling under her breath as she looks around, seemingly unaware of her audience.
Granger is called back in, told her idea has been accepted, but only on the terms that Draco and she work together to organize the tutoring lessons. Granger looks appropriately furious at this, which pleases Umbridge, and the deal is done.
Draco wants to say that nothing has frightened him, but that isn’t true. Something has certainly shaken him, at the very least, and it is the very same thing that Max suspects Lucius of fearing.
Max, the half-Swedish Muggle, who had so very “kindly” taught Draco how to read and interpret runes from their source material.
Draco looks back down at his paws, flexing them and shifting his weight some, before standing onto all fours. Jumping and climbing sounded perfect. He’d loved getting up high as a human, it made sense he’d enjoy it as an Animagus.
They would be going over the stars, constellations, and movements of planets and how they could affect magic. Most affects were subtle, but for some practices and spells it was important to know the positions of the celestial bodies. It was also helpful culturally, as they would be going over the stories behind constellations in some cases.
On Monday morning Draco, and all the rest of the Slytherins, woke up to a notice on the bulletin board that flying classes would begin on Thursday for the first years. It was also to be a shared class with the Gryffindors, much to Draco and Harry’s joy. They ignored Theodore and Millicent’s rude comments about it entirely.
Save for the stop and the dementor appearance, it was by far Draco’s favorite train ride to this day.
If only Hermione was there. Their brains combined could have figured this out. Or maybe she had already known with her obsessive studies on the history of Hogwarts and all things wizard-y. But both of them had been so wrapped up in getting ready for their own trips the last few days they’d forgotten that going together was an option.
And, because it is on Draco’s mind thanks to Snape, and Skeeter reminding him how many potions and potion ingredients are within the Ministry to be used as necessary, Draco can’t help but think of Polyjuice Potion.
He did have a pack of M&Ms for Potter, though, just in case he came back to the castle more frustrated than usual.
He didn’t know why these things happened to him. He already had a notably un-normal life in his foster home, but it felt like fate just wouldn’t give him a break. He was pale as snow with light, light blonde hair that made him stand out no matter where he was. They had wondered if perhaps he were albino, but after a doctor’s visit it was determined he was just like this.
At least now they could gross out their friends with impromptu kisses and overdramatic declarations of their devotion to one another. It was remarkably entertaining, both of them giggling like loons every time Weasley or Theodore shrieked, or Pansy and Blaise chucked food at them, or Eve and Hermione booed like a dissatisfied audience.
“Well, if we’re speaking hypothetically here,” George taps at his chin, “Then, hypothetically, you found out some pretty scandalous information on a Mr. Ludo Bagman and thought we could benefit from it.”
“You haven’t really shut up about it, so I’d say a decent amount,” Blaise calls, earning a few chuckles, and Draco’s eyes narrow in frustration.
He crouches beside the door’s hinges and points his wand squarely at the metal nails holding the door in the wall. A few, swift curses later and the nails were reduced to nothing.
“Hello,” he says in a distant, haunting voice and Draco inwardly groans. He had been really hoping Tracey received her strange behavior from her mother, but no luck. They would just have to deal with this now.
“So… they didn’t give you some toy you wanted…?” Max questions slowly that evening over their radio. Draco wasn’t sure how to translate a wand to Muggle speech, so instead he’d simply claimed it was an English thing and Max wouldn’t understand. It had gotten them into a bit of a tiff, but that hardly lasted long.
“You know,” Harry begins when Vivian runs off, singing at the top of her lungs, “Despite the blood chilling terror of fighting an actual mountain troll… I think this might be my favorite Halloween ever.”
Draco chuffs in a way he hopes is affirmative. There was just something so nice about curling up as a snow leopard and taking a nap. He couldn’t do it often, since he was an unregistered Animagus and had to be careful, but whenever he had the chance it was a nice treat.
“Old enough, Mr. Malfoy,” he replies cheekily which, fine, that’s fair, but Draco is still curious. “Now, shall we begin?”
“Heya, Draco!” says a pair of identical gingers after they’ve broken off from their family to approach him. Draco sighs.
For a little while they’d ignored Harry and Draco, allowing them both to wake up and sort themselves out. Harry scrubbed at his face with his shirt, then tried to help Draco right his bedhead.
“I was frightened, Headmaster, and I wasn’t entirely sure I was correct,” Draco half lies. He had been frightened, but he had been nearly one hundred percent positive he’d seen the Killing Curse.
“Alright, let’s go to your room,” she says around her candy. Her scowl loses some of its heat, though, thanks to the candy when Draco arches a brow at her. “What? Do you want your hair carved or not?” she manages to snap, then turns and marches out towards the boys’ dorms.
Draco looks up, brows furrowed, at the sing-song comment. There, leaning against his library table, are Fred and George Weasley. They’re smiling at Draco pleasantly, but he knows better than to trust that smile. Especially on these two.
“We’re all pretty decent at the Earworm Jinx, too,” Eve says, “Get enough people with the same song stuck in their head and it is bound to start a stir.”
Comfy-looking shirts, sweatpants, jeans, jackets, and a beanie sit inside, and Potter unfolds each to look at them in amazement. “You are aware you bought your own clothes not too long ago in London, yes?” Draco smirks, sitting at the foot of the bed, watching Potter’s face. It had to be one of the most stunning sights he’d seen in a while.
“It looks like it’s starving…” Draco says quietly. The creature was big, but even from this distance he could tell it was all skin and bones.
“He…” Max pauses, sounding uncertain, before a deep sigh comes through the radio. “He’s my Mama’s Papa. After my grammy died, he and my mama had a big falling out over… something serious. I dunno. We’ve never been back since.”
A few more pleasantries are exchanged before Flint must return home, and then Draco is rushing at his father to wrap him in a quick hug. He doesn’t stay long, hugs aren’t to be drawn out, nor common, things, but he is so overwhelmed with emotions he can’t help it.
Eventually the car slid to a stop in front of Kings Cross Station and Mrs. Nubble stepped out to help Draco gather his things onto a cart at the front. She patted him down and ran a hand over his slicked back hair, a decision on her part Draco would no doubt be adjusting the second he got away.
“I’m going to get Luna. This is ridiculous,” Sophie finally groans, grabbing Daphne’s elbow and dragging her away. As they go, Draco can hear Daphne ranting and Sophie blandly telling her to calm down.
“My talented son,” she says quietly, urging Draco to smile back, before gesturing to his violin. It’s made of a shimmery white material that almost looks like marble. “Tell me where to find all of the chords,” she tells him, and he is eager to show her.
“I was thinking of asking Professor McGonagall. Can’t leave the castle grounds during term, right? But maybe she could take me to Diagon Alley over Christmas break,” Draco replies, shrugging, “I’ll just keep borrowing Professor Sinistra’s Turbo XX until then.”
But Lucius was hardly around. He wasn’t even at his own home often anymore, leaving Draco and Narcissa to their own devices, coming up with excuses for Draco’s absences but never needing to use them.
“Ron…” Eve gives Weasley an unimpressed look, head cocked to one side judgmentally, “Let’s be real. If you don’t hear the name
Air catches in Draco’s throat and he stops, their dance over, but still clinging to each other, like somehow if they look at each other that will ruin everything.
Harry is silent for a long, long time, turning to face forward again and Draco leans back down to nuzzle his hair. “Whatever is bothering you…” the blond whispers, just loud enough for his boyfriend to hear, “You’re still you. Infuriating, stubborn, heroic, idiotic, careless--”
“Because they’re all too nice,” Draco rolls his eyes, restraining the urge to rub at his arm where it would surely bruise. “They won’t tell you your real problem.”
“I have a plan coming up soon. I hope to use a little… trip I have in the making to get information on multiple people,” Draco replies, eyes thinning. “I assume you must want some of this information?”
When the door appears after they thrice pass the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, thinking of what they need, they enter into a room that is absolutely perfect for their needs.
“Obviously,” Potter snorts as he watches, next, Weasley mimic Granger, only to yelp in surprise and slap a hand over his mouth. He’s wide-eyed and shocked, which makes the rest of them grin at him, but he’s too focused on the new candy to notice or care. A moment later he swallows, then pours another pile into his hand.
“Definitely,” he nods, kicking his backpack under the seat, “I also have a few spells I saw I wanted to try.” His first thought was the unlocking spell McGonagall had used on Tootsie’s cage. It had been the first spell he’d seen that he’d also caught the words for and he really wanted to try it out.
“Only if they slow down, for Merlin’s sake,” the girl snarks, but doesn’t quite manage a smile. It’s fine. What else can they do?
Draco hesitates, his fork halfway to his mouth where he sits in the dining room of Malfoy Manor. Despite not seeing much of his father over the Christmas Break, that didn’t mean Draco didn’t see him at all.
“Harry is fine, remember?” Eve says lowly, squeezing his arm until it hurts, and she doesn’t let up until he’s breathing deeply and ducking his head. He felt exhausted, utterly drained, and he hated it. He needed to be strong. He needed to be better than this and go find his heroic, idiot boyfriend. He had to SEE that Harry was okay.
Crabbe and Goyle were obvious. They were morons and hardly counted as friends, but they were by his side regularly and both completely clueless. They made convenient subjects of his photos, but were often messy, making surely distasteful images.
There are a few new mixtapes for Potter’s Walkman, plus a brand-new set of headphones, likely Max’s father’s doing.
“Ah yes, the photos from our local detective. Photos that have led to no new leads and no captures. Photos that have only brought about your freedom, Black. It makes me wonder,” Fudge hisses, all venom and fear mixed into one.
Thankfully, he doesn’t have to wait long until the girl is hurrying back out of her dorm, a bag under one arm, and a fistful of Jelly Slugs with one already dangling from her mouth. It takes her a second of finagling - with no help from Draco - to shut the door behind her then turn towards him.
“Then I must not know you. Yes, yes, I heard you the first time,” Potter waves his hand dismissively at him.
Harry doesn’t say anything in response, but he does offer a thankful smile. Draco smiles back, a small thing, before his hand is running up Harry’s back to card his fingers through dark curls.
“Well, I couldn’t come up with anything befitting the whole thing, so I was going to ask you to Hogsmeade with me,” Draco attempts for suave, but falters when Harry cringes in distaste.
“Blindfolds? Is that why they’ve always been such awful players?” Potter questions with fake innocence and Draco shoots him a glare, before sighing deeply.
He looks down forlornly at the Slytherin crest on his robes. They could do so much better than that… He knew they could.
“Blatantly a pseudonym,” Draco snarls, glare like silver fire. “The information in here could have only come from a bug on the wall!”
He heaves a deep sigh, turns back around, and waves over his shoulder. “Very well. I’ll meet you there,” he calls back and hears the sound of footsteps through the snow as they head off.
And this Gryffindor… Draco glances at the other boy, who had fallen silent and thoughtful, smile distant. Nothing sounded wrong about it. Bravery and chivalry were important. He doesn’t think he fits that definition at all, but he doesn’t see any major issues with it either. Did this boy have a problem with it, though?
When the decree comes out that no new clubs can be started without express permission from High Inquisitor Umbridge, Draco feels both self-satisfied and furious. Self-satisfied because he had, in fact, told the Golden Trio they weren’t sneaky at all and this was proof of that. Furious because… well, because of everything else.
Potter hesitates, eying the book like it, or Draco, might bite him, before he shifts and moves over to sit beside Draco, leaning in close to get a good look at the pages.
“I can assure you, Bulgaria is a real place,” Draco deadpans, rolling his eyes and pinching the bridge of his nose.
They leave Weasley for last, since he isn’t actually hurting anyone and they are hoping the curse on him will wear off over time.
The only one missing is Percy Weasley, the previous stand-in for Barty Crouch, but Draco had heard from Ron Weasley that his elder brother had been called into questioning following the discovery of his boss’s body.
Draco releases a sharp shriek in pain, which he will refuse he ever made for as long as he lives, and Pomfrey swiftly ties up his arm once it has been relocated. She gives him a concoction of medical potions and rubs a salve into his shoulder. He’s bound to bruise something fierce, both on his nose and his shoulder, but he should be fine if he takes it easy.
Draco eventually moves on to another Charms book Hermione had, curiously going over each spell he found, wondering what the limits of this magic may be, and Hermione moves to a book on the history of Hogwarts. While Draco was interested on what they could eventually do, it seemed Hermione was interested in what had already been done. He supposes she wants to get a better foothold in this Wizarding World, and so does Draco, but he figures they could always do that later.
“He was being sarcastic, Tracey,” Hermione huffs, glaring at Theodore when he goes to protest, “No one is breaking the law.”
The trip up to Hogwarts becomes a blur. He hardly even has the conscious thought that it is strange Hagrid doesn’t greet the students. He also hardly notes the thestrals at the front of the carriages. Eve, Leandra, Pansy, and Blaise sit with him on the way up, but Draco hardly talks to them, too wrapped up in trying to figure out what had been going through Potter’s head.
“You’re amazing, mate!” the ginger is yelling, the two Gryffindors hugging their friend and bouncing with excitement.
“And we’ve never heard of them,” Harry adds, “So, if we could find one and talk to it, we could get the people to start asking why they had never heard of them before, whether it is due to Ministry interference or not.”
“I heard you the first hundred times,” Potter grumbles, walking beside him with a lantern in one hand. Both boys have their wands out as well, ready to throw up sparks if they need to.
“You are insinuating that Slytherins have hearts, you realize,” Draco drawls with a roll of his eyes.
Draco feels his breath actually catch and he splutters for a moment, a tight grip around his heart as he says as firmly as he can, “Not your friend. Besides, I thought that one was the worst friend?”
Draco could groan. If anyone could beat Max in shear, rambling capabilities, it was their father. “Nothing you need concern yourself with, old man,” Draco snaps, not in the mood for this either, and he moves to shut off his radio.
“That’s a cool owl,” the other boy decides to say, pointing to Tootsie who had tucked her head under her wing for a nap.
“Hello, Draco,” Luna greets pleasantly as Theodore, who was clutching his chest from the surprise, glares at him.
“A scandalous story about the Ministry that you expect to get published in the Prophet? Oh, I really must hear this,” Skeeter arches a thin eyebrow that is very clearly not the same color as the hair atop her head.
Draco snorts at that, in clear agreement. It seemed the only people who liked Umbridge were the people who got something out of her. Which meant only the most stereotypically Slytherin Slytherins could stand her. Unfortunately, these were also the most vocal Slytherins…
“Yeah, Draco?” Harry asks, stepping towards him so they can speak more easily while Weasley and Granger bicker.
“You find nice girl like Harry, Evangeline,” Ms. Hushburn is swiftly back to addressing her daughter, who groans.
“They’re the ones that so desperately want to be Gryffindors,” Millicent smiles widely. Draco, distantly, thinks she looks kind of like a muppet. “They’re the ones that should… test themselves.”
“Yes, Madam Pomfrey,” Draco groans, in no mood to even attempt to build up a tantrum of any kind. He was awake, but at what cost? He felt utterly spent and he desperately wanted to get some more sleep in. Who knew healing was so exhausting?
When the Entrance Chamber finally settles Weasley grips Draco’s shoulder to keep from teetering over in his dizziness. “That’s what you get for trying to keep up with the doors,” Draco deadpans to the ginger, before stepping away and moving to one of the twelve doors.
He never does get a proper answer for his questions, but that evening, during a wandless tutoring lesson up in the Astronomy Tower, he notices Potter looking at his fresh undercut, followed by the boy wonder tripping over his own feet.
Crabbe and Goyle are silent, and Draco turns to leave as the rest of Slytherin team begins to slip in. He ignores Montague and his black eye, but he doesn’t miss a few passing comments.
“Yeah, dude. People were stupid,” Max agrees mournfully and the young wizard needs a moment to gather himself again.
He already knows Barty Crouch has a son, also named Barty Crouch, who was sentenced to Azkaban by his own father for the torture and insanity of Neville Longbottom’s parents. He also knows the Lestrange’s were involved. Reading the transcript of the actual court proceedings is a little hard, though, Crouch Jr. begging his father to let him go, that he didn’t do anything, and not to send him back to the dementors.
When Harry ducks his head in embarrassment Draco moves to follow him, bending forwards so he can get back into Harry’s line of sight. “I’m serious. You have a talent and drive to help others that sometimes greatly concerns me.”
Draco glances around at the hall as the sorting continues and spots Ron looking over at them, his face stony, and Draco isn’t a fan of whatever that might mean, so he looks away. Lily Potter also keeps glancing over at them, but Draco is thankful to see she doesn’t look disappointed, only worried. He had liked the woman so far; he would have hated to see her judging her child over something like this.
“The what?” the blonde arches a brow, thoroughly confused by the title. He’d never heard of anything called the Creature Files.
After that he returns to the manor, finally sitting down with his own mother and attempting to decompress. It works a little. One of the house elves brings them tea, they talk about Draco’s classes, about his feelings on Umbridge, and how he is getting along with his schoolmates. There is a tightness in Draco’s gut, however, that never quite goes away, not while he’s in Malfoy Manor and his father could make a reappearance at any time.
do this, he’s always been good at compartmentalizing and acting, but that sure as hell doesn’t mean he likes it.
“Tilt the broom down!” Greg calls, he and Vincent looking pale as their friend goes higher and higher. Neville looks down and Draco can see he’s paled too, his eyes wide as saucers when he sees the ground getting further and further, and then he’s tipping sideways.
“Yes…” Harry whispers, looking up at him, “I figure… it’s about time we addressed that Militus Charm you’ve been so eager to work on.” Draco’s eyes widen and Harry smiles, seeming pleased by the reaction, as Granger and Weasley walk up.
” Wand pointed at the lock, though, he hears nothing. He tries the handle anyway and sighs when it doesn’t budge. He’d expected a bit more resistance than a simple Unlocking Charm could handle, but it was still frustrating.
“Moving on,” Eve cuts in, hands on her hips, and gives Draco a stern look. “I’m through with you here. My focus is Hermione now. You go get changed.”
“Alright boys, I’m done with you both. You’re free to go,” Madam Malkin suddenly says, stopping Draco from questioning the boy on why he seemed so upset. She stands and the adjusted robes fly off both boys’ shoulders. The blonde glances at the older witch in confusion. How had they finished at the same time if Draco had gotten there so much earlier? Malkin simply smiles back at him and says, “Always so nice to see children getting along,” then ushers them out of the room and back to the entrance.
“Keep sending me cassettes as well, actually. I can send them off to Potter’s home,” Draco pulls out a sheet of paper Potter had given him with the words “4 Privet Drive in Little Whinging, Surrey” written on it.
Draco always forces a smile, thanking them for their praise, before heading off to see if Cecil Duke had any work for him to do.
“For the Goblins. They hardly care about any articles printed on him. They need something to hold over him outside of The Prophet.”
But a fortune? Draco had a fortune? He wasn’t even sure what to imagine, especially since he had no idea what to expect with any of this wizarding stuff. He could never have expected any of this, couldn’t have imagined his life becoming this, and he still wasn’t entirely sure if it was a dream or not.
Draco turns to Hermione, hoping to use her as a distraction, but she had already abandoned Ron and is talking instead to a tall female ghost, eagerly asking question after question, much to the ghost’s apparent amusement. Draco sees a rather fat ghost tell them he’d love to see them sorted into Hufflepuff, then hears another ghost get called Nearly Headless Nick. Draco looks over just in time to see that ghost pull his head off sideways like it is on a hinge.
The first step would be to keep the mandrake leaf in his mouth from one full moon to the next. Then it would need to be mixed with a partially premade potion, which Draco had no issue in doing, the chrysalis, the dew, and a piece of his own hair. After that he would need to wait until a lightning storm to drink it, and until then recite the incantation
Soft footsteps enter the common room and Draco and Harry lower themselves to the floor to look under the chair. They see fluffy, pink slippers and the bottom of a matching bathrobe. They’ve stopped by one of the couches in the middle of the room and appear to be looking around before calling, quietly, “Draco?”
They wanted him to mingle with the rich kids, so he would do that, but the other children? They should be fair game. Besides, considering he had only ever made friends with a middle-class Muggle from America while only really having Crabbe and Goyle as lackies, not friends, it was safe to say Draco would probably have better chances with the poor children.
Nonetheless, the following day Draco takes up his mother’s offer to practice with her wand, even if he is huffy the entire time.
“Come ooooon. Mama says this is how to greet new friends! You’re being rude!” Max whines, hand wiggling in front of Draco’s face, and the six-year-old’s sharp but young mind latches onto one word.
It takes a few minutes of rummaging and tossing and digging, and Draco is just beginning to consider checking the drawers or just giving up and finding Snape, when his hand comes in contact with some kind of parchment. He grabs it, feels the heft and weight beneath, and rips it out.
“Okay, so where was I?” Max mumbles and Draco smiles a little. If being there to help the strange Muggle get through their nightmares meant helping them study for a subject they weren’t even taking just because they were curious… then so be it.
“I believe this is yours,” she says through gritted teeth, trying to keep her composure, and she holds out her hand where she grips a squirming Muddy.
The Slytherin boy arches a brow, but plays along and looks down. Sure enough, the Geoscript pages are empty. They look yellowed with age and slightly frayed at the edges. There also seems to be a faint, green glow emanating from the crease.
“Uagadou does not use wands,” Sinistra says, looking to the blonde, “Though I do own one for more complex spellwork.” Then she is outstretching her arm and holding the broom out to Draco without a word. Draco swallows, nerves trying to get the better of him, but he manages to reach out and take the broom in both his hands. Harry leans towards him to get a look as well.
So, he does just that, locking the door, and goes to the window. He has to climb into the tub to reach it, then sits on the rim of porcelain and cradles the radio in both hands.
He says it with enough sincerity and earnest meaning in his eyes it takes a moment for Lupin to realize he’s pulling his leg. Once he does, though, he barks a startled laugh, finding the comment funny instead of disrespectful. Draco smirks to himself and quickly slips out the door, heading to Transfiguration.
With classes for the day over, they both head up to the library together. Eve is already waiting, leisurely reading a romance novel Daphne Greengrass offered her, and scowling or cackling at every other word. Draco thinks he hears her mumble, “’Meat rod’?” before devolving into a fit of hushed giggling, while Draco and Potter pull out textbooks.
Here Ada’s smirk turns into a grin. “He took a shower and it turned blue!” she laughs loudly and Draco looks back at her, panic building in his gut. What? It had gotten WORSE? “Oh, relax, you big worry wart. It faded after that.” One of the reasons Ada was Draco’s least disliked was her complete disregard for these unexplainable events. Where the Nubbles and Frederick demanded answers and got frustrated when he had none, Ada thought it was all rather wicked and funny.
“And it isn’t safe for us to go back to our dorms right now,” Harry adds, looking just as tired and crestfallen as Draco feels.
After hearing all this, Draco had made it his mission to convince Potter to begin using Columba if he needed to send any messages, but Potter was stubborn, as usual. He didn’t see any issue use his incredibly recognizable, snowy owl. He hadn’t seen any issues with Filch, just that he’d gotten a wrong tip, or was being pranked. Why should he not use Hedwig to send his letters.
The expected jiggle doesn’t come, and instead the handle twists with no issue and Blaise pushes the door open slowly. From their vantage point, the room looks to be a perfect split of pitch black on the left and pure white on the right.
“I don’t understand it either,” Leandra admits carefully, then sighs and looks down at the book. “I can see everything just fine, but no one else can.”
The boy’s body quivers and he uncurls just enough to look up through his damp, clinging lashes at Draco. “Please don’t be. You’re… you’re doing what you can. It’s not like you’ve been told anything, either… You…” Potter hesitates, biting his lip, bubbles of sobs and hiccups coming up as he considers something. Slowly his hands unfurl from the back of Draco’s robes and instead moves to fiddle with the front of them, like he doesn’t even realize what he’s doing.
“I’ll do what I can,” Potter nods, a fire in his green eyes that Draco had learned meant the other boy meant business.
“Then we’ll ask Trelawney,” Draco says suddenly, straightening up in realization. “Or Dumbledore, if he ever shows up again!”
He stays the perfectly well-behaved pureblood, his hair slicked back and the buzzed part growing just a little bit longer, always prepared to offer a cordial smile to any passing officials and compliment for the higher-ups. He was perfect, well behaved, and a sparkling example of everything Fudge wanted all wizarding children to be.
“If anyone can change it, it’s your generation,” Sirius says, voice meaningful as he looks to the bushy-haired girl.
I have deemed you useless to me? I will find every. Last. Speck. Of dirt on you and make them diamonds for the public to skewer you with. Your social demise will befit the old witches of Salem, who will look down on you and say,
“We have Kreacher for all that!” Walburga roars, fury in her eyes, and Draco swallows. So much for trying to play peacekeeper. He’d never been good at that, so he wasn’t entirely sure why he’d tried. “I adore that a
“That’s brilliant!” Potter takes the camera to look at it, searching for some kind of sign that it is magically altered, but finding none. “You three invented this?”
“Bad, like… I’m not sure. I’m with Potter for a few days and am attempting to offer him a reprieve from some of his recent stresses, but I had not met his family until now… I did not see anything, but they rubbed me the wrong way,” he tries to explain, finding, for once, his words fighting him.
“Sure… Let’s go with that,” Draco nods, then begins to giggle when Harry uses his free hand to punch at Draco’s thigh.
McGonagall hums in agreement before waving a finger at him. “Close your mouth, now, and let’s be off,” she says and begins to walk, the crowd splitting for her like butter, and Draco hurries to stay close behind so as not to be caught up and lost.
“Should we…” Potter mumbles, then gulps around the lump in his throat. “Should we… talk about… the other thing that happened…?”
“At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,” Granger snaps, looking more irate than furious. “They got on with pure talent!”
The first of September. It was finally the day. Finally, Draco would get to set off on his magical, school adventure, away from his foster family, all on his own. He would get to learn spells and tricks and all kinds of things one could only dream of.
Draco snorts, nodding and leaning against his broom. “Tell me about it,” he agrees. He was still surprised how behind the Wizarding World was when it came to technology. Certainly, they had magic, but a telephone couldn’t hurt, either.
“Whatever, you just have a snooty tongue or something,” Max grumbles, “Don’t like anything unless it’s
“Yes. Yes he is,” says a witch Draco recognizes as their prefect, Gemma Farley, who has brilliant, blue eyes, a thin nose, and curly, black hair. “Want some potatoes, Draco? You look like a dang twig.” Draco tilts his head in confusion before looking where Gemma is motioning to the table. A gasp escapes him when he realizes piles upon piles of food has appeared all along the tables, seemingly out of nowhere. But… how? Where had it come from? And how had he missed its appearance?
Harry and Draco both go into a long-winded spiel about Charms, a class they both greatly enjoy, then Draco talks about Transfiguration and Harry complains that they need a new DADA teacher because he really, really wanted to learn effective, defense spells. Hagrid laughs as all three boys groan when asked about History of Magic. Herbology seems to be the only subject Ron feels remotely confident in, if only because his mother has a garden back at his home and he recognizes some of the plants.
“Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the Slytherins had the worst of it,” Fred continues. Draco understood the extra cruel treatment to Harry - the perceived leader - and Weasley and Granger - the leader’s best friends - but why the Slytherins?
Harry glares for a long, heated moment as Bellatrix giggles at him, her wand pointed in their general direction. Then, the Boy-Who-Lived is digging into his pocket and pulling out a prophecy record. The Death Eaters immediately light up, unable to tell that this record means nothing to all of them.
Draco peers nervously over the edge of the Astronomy tower, the rooftops of the rest of the castle far below. He liked heights, usually. He enjoyed climbing and relaxing in tree branches or atop statues. It was a habit Hermione and the Nubbles despised, but he enjoyed quite a lot.
“I’m surprised it wasn’t earlier than that,” Draco observes when the laughter dies down. “Didn’t that rotten family make you tend their gardens? I’m amazed you never ran into a little rat snake or something while doing that.”
Draco’s eyes widen as panic takes him over. He hadn’t hid the radio. He doesn’t think he’d even turned it off, which meant Max had likely heard everything. Had they said anything incriminating? Anything that would frighten the Muggle away? Had he… had he… Oh, Merlin, had he fucked up?
“You’ve been a slippery one, I will give you that,” Lucius says as Bellatrix begins to prowl around the gathered teens, slow and measured, her eyes flicking through all of them with a gleeful smile. “But the race is run. Hand over the prophecy like a good boy.”
Blinking a few times before realization dawns, Draco reaches to the buttons on his well-worn, blue polo, undoes them, and pulls down the collar. He always thought the blossoming lightning scar on his chest was cool. It looked kind of like an explosion, the markings slightly darker and indented on his pale skin. To think he had got it from some kind of spell meant to kill him. A spell that had killed his parents…
The Slytherin startles back from the voice almost immediately in front of him, his eyes widening as he looks around for the source of it but sees nothing. He hadn’t imagined that, right? He couldn’t possibly be going crazy, too.
“Apparently she stole it without anyone seeing, then took it upon herself to go snooping whenever the message on it showed up. It took her a few tries, but she eventually followed some students to the Room of Requirement, then went and told Umbridge,” Draco says.
It is while he is ranting over how unfair the Slytherin jocks are that Draco begins to truly bond with Ron Weasley. Dinners after practice are usually spent at the Gryffindor table, as far away from their teammates as they can get, and Draco holds nothing back as he vents. Ron, and a lot of the Gryffindors, think his word choices are particularly funny and often times will join in with their own stories about the Slytherin team.
He doesn’t find Lupin in his office, however. Instead, the gruff-looking man nearly bumps into Draco as they both turn a corner, a packed suitcase already in his hand and a travel cloak over his shoulders. He was already leaving, Draco quickly realizes, but he stops to give Draco a calm smile.
When Draco looks back Harry is glaring at the bathroom door, his displeasure at Theodore palpable, but then he’s smiling reassuringly at Draco, squeezing his shoulder. “It’ll be fine,” he whispers and finally Draco lets out a breath, allowing himself to believe the boy.
Harry snorts at that. “I’ll consider it,” he says, but Draco doubts he really will, and then they are moving swiftly through the now vacant corridor, heading for the library.
“Draco?” The blonde looks over to find Tracey Davis standing in his path out of the hall, blinking big, blank eyes at him and holding a sheet of folded parchment in her hand. He walks up to her, head tilted expectantly. “I got your note. You needed to talk to me?”
The thestral blows out a breath of warm air, ruffling the boys’ hair, and Theodore scowls around his fear. The creature’s breath really wasn’t the most pleasant smell, Draco would give him that… But then it sniffs at Theodore - Once. Twice – before nudging its beak against his shoulder.
“Look who the prophecy is about,” Draco says quietly, watching as Harry’s eyes widen behind his glasses.
“See? Cool looking, right?” Harry says to his friend and Ron nods like he’s mesmerized, eyes bugged out while he stares at the lightning scar. Draco can’t help the blush on his face and he pushes the shirt collar back up.
you go with?” Harry had snapped, doing a valent effort of ignoring Granger to keep from blowing up at her and her babying.
“Didn’t have Chang, you mean,” Draco drawls, because he can’t help himself, and smirks when Potter looks up at him sharply. The other boy opens and closes his mouth a few times, like a fish out of water, but then decides whatever he wants to say isn’t worth it.
“They really aren’t that bad, guys,” Harry mumbles, eyes flicking to Draco across the table. “Draco’s been really nice to have around, too.” A whole bunch of eyes suddenly turn to Draco, having only just then realized he had sat down at their table, and the blonde sits up a little straighter.
“Names! I demand names! And addresses! Eric and me’ll catch a flight and he can drive me and then we can handle things!”
This is when Draco begins to process that the museum must be biased. There is clear praise to the Allied Forces and condemnation to the Axis Powers, but look at what only one of the Allied Forces had done. Look at the death they’d caused. What more happened that the museum wasn’t showing?
It still takes a while, though, of torture on Draco’s part, before there is finally a knock at the door. Draco turns in his seat, looking back at the door, as Umbridge calls for whoever it might be to enter.
And now Bellatrix Lestrange was free once again. Draco’s absolutely insane aunt, Narcissa Malfoy’s sister, Sirius Black’s cousin, was out in the world once more. Draco had hardly been able to eat after reading that…
“No, you idiot,” Draco stands as well, approaching the other and grabbing his wrist. Potter swiftly looks back at him. “I’m rescuing you from yourself.”
“How can it be Belgian if it is from Everest?” Draco questions with an arched brow, smirking at Max’s disgruntled reaction.
Draco falls silent, staring at Snape with a blank expression. He hadn’t had a tone, but that hardly mattered. He was currently on Snape’s shitlist and he would do well to get off it. He wasn’t going to become another Potter.
Harry’s head is already shaking. “No. No, she isn’t happy with us, but she understands how important the DA is. I don’t think she’s too happy with Marietta, either, because of what she did, but she wants to show her support by staying with her friend.”
Unless she’d said it on purpose? Could what Voldemort be looking for… could it be in the Hall of Prophecies?
He also didn’t know what his Animagus form would be, but… to have something like that as a backup sure wouldn’t hurt. He could just as easily gain an Animagus form and then never use it again. No one would know but himself and a few, choice individuals.
“I had a few suggestions. Draco had a few suggestions. We see what we’re all feeling and go for it,” Eve replies. Her suggestions are mall, spa, ice cream, and sight-seeing. Draco’s suggestions are cinema, local concert, food vendors, and museums.
