Harry stood with his hand outstretched for several heart beats as the Professor simply stared at him, his dark dark eyes conveying equal parts confusion and anger. As the seconds seemed to slip into minutes without the Professor moving or speaking Harry slowly started to move his hand back to his side. Had he done something wrong? Harrys’ mind whorled with anxiety and confusion. He had been as polite as he knew to be. Was it considered rude for a child to address an adult in the wizarding world? Harrys’ heart thudded painfully as an anxiety fueled though flitted through his mind. Could it..could it just be him? “Of course it’s you.” a cold voice that sounded suspiciously like Uncle Vernon snarled in his mind. “He can tell you're a no good, worthless FREAK just by looking at you! He can tell you’ll never amount to anything, that you don’t belong! You’ll be back in your cupboard in no time!” A warm long fingered hand firmly gripping his drew him from his dark spiraling thoughts.
Orange and purple galaxies spun sedately on lemon yellow robes as Albus Dumbledore paced in the Headmasters office of Hogwarts under the watchful eye of his phoenix familiar Fawkes. If it had been any other year Fawkes would have allowed the rhythmic pacing of his bonded to lull him to sleep, but not this year. This year was special, this year Harry Potter would rejoin the Wizarding World. Flames danced along glistening red and gold feathers in a display of excitement every time he thought about it. Finally, after ten years, he would get to see the young one again.
Harry followed Hagrid up the large white marble steps of Gringotts to a set of gold colored doors, which were flanked by two of the strangest beings Harry had ever seen. They were just a touch shorter than Harry with large sloping foreheads, pointed ears, dark eyes,and rows of sharp teeth. Both were clad in rich looking red and gold uniformes with what could only be the Gringotts crest on the right breast pocket. Harry accidentally made eye contact with one and received a sinister sharp toothed grin when a high pitched voice called out to them. “Hagrid! There you are. I was beginning to wonder if you hadn’t got lost.”
Thank you for all of the kudos! I'm very excited and happy that so many people seem to like my work. I should warn you that I'm writing this as I go so updates will not be on a schedule. As before this chapter was beta read by the ever wonderful Isfethime. Constructive criticism is always welcome. Thank you and enjoy.
Harry tore his gaze from the rather bloodthirsty grin he was being graced with in order to search for the person who had called out to Hagrid. The tiny, smartly dressed man staring up at them was not what he was expecting. Harry couldn’t help the way his eyes flickered between the small man before him and the beings by the doors. They shared the same sharp cheekbones, long fingered hands, and small dark eyes. It was clear to Harry that this man must be related to those strange beings in some way. Harry was so lost in his appraisal of the man that he jerked slightly when Hagrid spoke and two sets of eyes turned to him.
Harry rubbed the back of his head gently, hoping to dispel the lingering pain, while he watched Hagrid. He couldn’t really be famous could he? He had never, to his knowledge, done anything noteworthy. There had to be some kind of mistake, he was no one special. Just as Harry was going to ask why he was famous Hagrid tapped a single brick on the wall three times. The question died on Harrys’ lips as the bricks began to wiggle and move; revealing an elegant archway. Hagrid smiled at Harrys’ stunned expression and with an all encompassing sweep of his arm said “Welcome Harry to Diagon Alley!”
After receiving a heartfelt “Course not professor!” Albus sends Hagrid about his task with a fond smile. Returning to his chair Albus sits down heavily, with a weary sigh and closes his eyes. Several minutes pass with the only sound in the office coming from the many strange whirling devices that line the walls and the crackle of the fire. From his perch atop the headmasters’ chair Fawkes contemplates all he has heard and considers what he might do next. As a creature of pure, unending magic he can break his bond to Dumbledore whenever he should choose to do so. Breaking the bond however would leave him with no reason to stay within Hogwarts. Just as Fawkes decides he’ll stay for the time being to keep an eye on the manipulative old wizard, Dumbledore straightens suddenly. Flapping his wings indignantly as the chair rocks with Albus’s movement, Fawkes watches as he reaches across the desk for parchment and a self-inking quill. Dumbledore sets about writing several short notes and once again speaks quietly to himself.
Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, did NOT make mistakes. This was an irrefutable fact in his mind and a point on which he prided himself. He would never brag of such a thing of course; he didn’t feel he needed to. Dumbledore had in fact denied his infallibility on several occasions. Those who could say they knew him well saw him as a paragon of Light and Justice, a steadfast defender of the weak and oppressed. His closest confidants would tell all who asked that Albus Dumbledore was a good friend and to many a kindly grandfather.
Though not many would believe it Albus Dumbledore was a master manipulator (at least to his own mind). Every aspect of his personality, from his garish robes to the twinkle in the blue eyes hidden behind half moon spectacles, was carefully orchestrated to draw people in. His every word and action carefully planned and weighed to ensure that the fame and power that came with his defeat of the Dark Wizard Grindewald never weaned or wavered.
“Harry, this is Professor Flitwick.” Hagrid indicated to the tiny man with a broad sweep of his large hand. “ He’ll be one o’yer Professors at Hogwarts.”
Chapter 3
Hagrid smiled absently as he counted bricks in the wall with his umbrella. “Yer famous Harry! Didn’t I tell you that?”
“Yes, yes that’s the only course of action available really.” Dumbledore muttered as he paced clearly lost in thought. “I’ll simply have to send someone to collect the boy. I can’t send one of the professors though, they would never agree with the way those muggles treat him. I can’t trust any of them to not interfere.” Albus stroked his long silver beard in thought as he completed a circuit. Blue eyes twinkled as he hit upon an idea. “Hagrid, that great oaf, is unfailingly loyal to me and non to bright. He’ll never even notice something off about the treatment of the boy and if he does he won’t say anything to anyone.”
First and foremost I do not own Harry Potter or any of the current characters in this story. I am writing this strictly for my own amusement and am not making any money from it. That being said I can't begin to apologize for it taking me two years to get this out. Thank you to any who has stuck with me. A big thank you to my beta readers: You guys rock.
Too the majority of Wizarding Britain Dumbledore was known to be powerful, compassionate, and wise; if a bit eccentric and fashion challenged. Albus was seen displaying these traits readily and without reservation in his day to day life. His wisdom and compassion where right at home in the solemn chambers of the Wizengamot; and was often sought after by the Minister. It was well known that he was much loved by the students and staff of Hogwarts. There where few indeed who would be willing to entertain the idea that everything about one Albus Dumbledore was an act of subtle manipulation.
“Yes.”
He leaned against the railing, trying to clear his head of the claustrophobia that had come over him so suddenly as he had lay in the bed in his room, a small unimpressive space even by the most impoverished of wizard standards. The wind was colder than he expected, with a smell that was both familiar and different. He had ridden his broom often enough along the shores of the lake and even out over the waters in his time at Hogwarts, and had spent enough holidays along coastlines, to know the smell and taste of the sea.
His mother had touched his face, a gentle rub of her thumb across the blotch on his cheek, and told him they were not without wands. She had given him the slim case then, long as his forearm and half as wide, a glossy black leather that had felt foul and heavy in his hands though it weighed no more than a textbook. Then they were hurrying away, out into the crowds of people along the docks queueing in to board their ships or offload onto the shore.
Go back further…
Replacing Percy’s precious schoolboy scribbles with Draco’s anti-doomsday plans seemed a perfect tribute to them both.
Since the journal was a reference book for fifth year Ron didn’t bother giving it a browse, his head still spinning from the last two he’d tried to make sense of. All pros and cons, itemized dates and numbers and names that Ron probably could make sense of if he really tried and also had the accompanying actual book to read, but since he didn’t he had very swiftly given up.
Why would Malfoy make any small changes at all if he intended to completely stop the war? No, someone wanting to win a war wouldn’t plot to save enemies on the other side.
Well, he’d have to see about giving it a home, when he got back. It was the least he could do, seeing as how he couldn’t save the prat himself.
What came next?
“More?”
“I’m Not Going back to fix your mistakes” says Ron, who then realizes his life is kinda perfect but goes back in time anyway specifically to fix Draco’s mistakes.
Harry looked down at his hands, no doubt judging all the effort he’d put in for Draco Malfoy, and wondering if it had all been worth it in the end for someone who hadn’t bothered to even face his mistakes let alone correct them.
Look at him, big tough Auror, how many stakeouts had he been through, hours he’d pushed through pouring over paperwork or standing watch, and he could barely keep his eyes open. Sure it was past 2 in the morning, but he’d slept enough given his bedtime.
Hermione was his guiding light, he’d decided that early on, nothing he changed could change THEM, not so long as he didn’t let it. They were a team, the most perfect team, and this time he’d be everything she could possibly need for all the time they had together and not make such an ass of himself. Hermione wouldn’t let him down, certainly not when it came to books, he was sure this next one would be exactly what he needed, and there wasn’t a more perfect home for it then Hogwarts A History.
“The prototype was destroyed.” Malfoy managed, “Nott-“
He’d been sitting on his bed staring down at the blank notebook, his wand raised and ready to cast, waiting for something to happen after he had swallowed the pensieve capsule. He didn’t know if it would happen right away, or if it would take time, or if he would even be able to tell if anything was different at all.
“I think you should paint it blue.” He said, and Ron raised a brow in question. “The car, it should be grey-blue. Like his eyes.” He tilted his head with a grimace disguised as a smirk. “A homage I guess.”
“You never know,” Draco muttered, but that wasn’t why he didn’t go, and she knew it.
The rest of the emails were short after that, one or two a week instead of the whole conversations every day, and no longer on good terms. Ron tried to make it obvious that they now knew each other’s identity, though they only referred, when they did need to call each other anything, by the age old nicknames of Weasel and Ferret. The emails painted a terse, vague story of their purely professional mutual interest in restoring the car.
After Ron didn’t know how long he lay in his bed, staring up at his ceiling, wand still in his hand, book on his stomach.
Get up.
“No no no,” she cast warming charms on her rain poncho and threw it around him, rubbing his hands between hers and breathing on them, he could smell the oil she used in her hair and it grounded him like he was biting into a cold tart fruit. “Let’s get you off the floor, come on, up up up.” She tried to pull him by his numb hands but his body didn’t move.
Her raised middle finger was the last he saw of her as he followed her out the door, locking it behind them, though he heard her holler at the top of her lungs to the students celebrating outside, “Zòt olé manjé? Lets go lets go! Food is that way.” and smiled towards the end of the hall, where she was surely ushering everyone into the building to the cafeteria where a late dinner would be waiting for their victorious team.
“Don’t you use my brother against me,” Ron’s voice went cold, went hard.
“We arrested Nott,” Ron explained, “He was obliviated, and had this on him.” Ron pried Draco’s weakening fingers off the device and swung it around to his back as he worked, focusing again on the injuries that just kept reopening. “You need St. Mugo’s, I should have owled them before I came, I don’t think I can side along you and keep you alive at the same time.”
He thinks that it had been that moment he had decided to go back in time. Guilt maybe, and a weird sense of duty. Harry was his best mate, close as brothers, and Ron had never even known how deeply he had felt the loss of his schoolyard rival. Ron had lived quite pleasantly this past decade without the perpetual threat of the pointy faced menace, and Hermione had no shortage of ignorant heads to butt against among the ministry as she championed her magical creatures rights campaign.
Draco had feared it, all these years he’d been so afraid of the reaction he’d receive when he came home, and he knew objectively that her anger had been for the husband who had dragged them into this terrible impossible predicament, this death sentence, but in his heart he was her son and she had look at him so viciously, hated him.
“How did you-” Malfoy tried before the pain of speaking seized him, causing his body to bow up off the ground and wreck the hasty first aid Ron had managed, ripping open the new skin that was trying to knit the wounds together.
It was a beautiful thing, a near perfect replica of the ones he had seen in the Ministry, but with a few very important changes.
Draco hadn’t followed them to the dungeons the way he had intended.
“I didn’t know how to feel.” She admitted when he pressed. “I wanted someone to pay, we are all hurting so much and we need people to pay for it, to find some closure. Bellatrix is gone, Voldemort is gone, but the scar is still here.” She traced her arm, and Ron pulled her more firmly against him as she cried. “I didn’t know what I wanted. She saved Harry, it terrifies me what could have happened, sometimes I think about it and there’s so many ways it could have gone wrong. He died, he came back but he died and there’s no assurance he would survive again. I think about it so much I can’t breathe. He was helpless and hurting and alone and she’s the only one who could save him, and I hate her anyway. I think,” she had a wretched look on her face as she met his eyes, “I think I hate her more for helping him while I couldn’t then I hate all of them for anything else.” She confessed. “I didn’t now how to feel, so I didn’t know what to do but…” she crumpled the paper in her lap and let her head fall back, eyes closed, “but I think I’m relieved now. I didn’t have to make any choice at all, and for some reason it doesn’t feel as terrible as I thought it would.”
Ron remembered the arguments, just as loud as Harry’s had been with Kingsley, between them when Harry had first mentioned his plan to save the Malfoys. Ron had wanted nothing to do with it, and had outright refused to participate. He had made no comment, no quote in the paper, no agreement with Harry when asked even after the article had been ran. Dean and Olivander had been grateful to Harry and though not happy about the task they hadn’t exactly fought him on it, Xenophilius had still been a wreck of guilt for trying to turn them over and had easily agreed with Harry that a parent would do anything to protect their own. Luna, in her dreamy way, had smiled and touched Harry lightly on the cheek as if proud of him.
He reread the last few lines, trying to remember where he was going with his pros and cons of joining Umbridge’s little student task force. Deciding that he’d pretty much picked that topic to the bone he flipped the cover closed and opened a fresh journal, writing  ‘Reference book 12, accompanied Book 5 Year 1995-1996”
‘If I was visible you’d have seen me by now,’ oh, oh. Ron griped his collar, feeling that subtle flex deep in his throat that came with long internal arguments. ‘Even someone as thick as you can’t miss me in such small quarters. You really lived like this?’
Somehow worse was that because of Ron’s affiliation he was not permitted to work the case, which meant Harry was not permitted to work the case, and when they were eventually pulled from Nott’s when the two were linked it left them with nothing to do but snipe at each other. The ministry was no doubt certain there was a third person involved, it was what Ron would suspect, who obliviated Nott and killed Draco, and because Ron had known Draco and hidden it Harry could not hunt them down, was being forced to continue his leave to prevent him from badgering the investigators, and was pacing his home like a caged lion waiting for the chance to strike.
“Ride back with me?” Ron had asked, prepared to be rebuffed and tentatively hopeful when Harry had jerked his head in a nod and strode away.
The paper would have made any trial the Ministry tried to hold a nightmare. Harry had used the Quibbler to speak out against the Ministry during Fudge’s crusade, and had already confirmed the rumors his taunts about Snape during his duel with Voldemort had spawned. This next article could give the Malfoys an opening to claim they had defected and operated as spies. Without Snape, Dumbledore, Remus, or Serius to speak against them and Harry openly praising them there was no possibility Kingsley could win.
He blinked again, frowning and the wand finally stilled. The irritation at himself wasn’t… what t normally was when he was caught between actions like this.
Draco didn’t have favorites, whatever Bernadette and the others liked to say, but every year there was one or two that hovered a little closer in his personal space then he intended, needed a little more of his attention. Demaurius hadn’t really done more than any other student, wasn’t even the type of smart-assed or petulant student Draco usually found himself drawn to, trying to untie the knots they tied themselves up in. Demaurius had simply taken up too much space, been too big and too quiet and too intimidating as he struggled with his schoolwork at a table that none of the student assistants had wanted to approach him. So Draco had been the one to sit with him, thinking the children so silly. Demaurius was a little wider about the shoulders but a full head shorter then Greg or Vince.
Harry snorted and Ron couldn’t help but grin.
“Go back.” Malfoy said simply, “Go back further.”
Traveling back in time only to be killed by his own mother was not ideal.
Those raw red rimmed eyes squinted open at him, bitter and suspicious. “Yes.”
If he fell asleep now would he dream of it?
It was a moment of inattention, as he balanced the case one handed and flipped the single latch, cracking it open to reveal neat rows of wands set into velvet.
Ron had not had the time to prepare that answer like he had the emails. Once the Aurors arrived he’d had no time alone in the shop, no time to really think, but his mind had always been a little different, worked a little different, then other peoples. He saw patterns, drew paths and potentials. It was a skill he had honed these ten years as an Auror, and one he used to begin the outline of his cover story.
“For what?” Ron demanded, “Why do you want me to swallow your memories?”
If not for the journal…
(See the end of the chapter for
So Ron added one last lie to his fake emails, and in that last line hinted that Draco might need help.
It isn’t a good thing, for a child, to look so intimidating in an environment where the adults tried to maintain absolute authority. So often they were sorted into the pile of ‘problem children’ and never washed the label off.
Ron held the little device in his hands, oh wow his hands were really really red, he had blood all over him how had he not even noticed? He giggled, knew he was hysterical, and tried to focus, tried to calm down. He leaned back, gripping the wheel in one hand and the time turner in the other, closed his eyes, and just breathed. He wouldn’t be any help like this, but he had time, he was sure he had time, he had watched Draco die and then wandered the shop the last time.
Turning again towards the car, the car that Draco had pointed to with the last of his strength, that Ron had sat inside of as the Time-turner had attempted to pull him forward, but had instead sent him back. Back to when he had first used it, five minutes into the past.
Ron didn’t want to look.
Ron surged up and rushed to it, grabbing for the handle too fast it slipped out of his bloody fingers causing him to struggle with opening it for precious seconds.
Breathe in, Breathe Out.
“They won’t heal.” Draco seemed to be losing strength, or maybe just his will to keep talking. “The dittany bought some time, but they will come back. They’re in a time loop Weasley, there’s no saving me from this.”
Draco had become accustomed to the dances these many years, and found comfort in the beat It felt like it could reach him no matter where he went in the world, if it could find him even into the supposed quiet of the library.
“You can’t mean to say you were so very far into the future?” Draco brushed off his distress with a casual sniff.
Ron had let the issue drop after that. They both had. Neither had ever bothered with anything about the Malfoys or Draco since, a tentative ceasefire with Harry that had lasted for years. Though Ron had suspected Harry had never given up his search, and in his capacity as caregiver for Teddy had made tentative ties with Narcissa through Andromeda, Ron had not been involved in that area of his life. It was not a secret or a lie, just a silent mutual agreement to not talk about.
“Oh, yes.” Ron dumped his bag out, bandages and wraps and vials of potions scattering on the floor. Draco groaned as he turned on his side and raised himself on an elbow, snatching up the closest vial and reading the label before uncorking it and drinking that. “I… didn’t know you could do that.”
He should stop rolling the wand at least.
“Book 4, year 1994,
It wasn’t exactly a fair thing to say, Ron had his own experience with a splinching and he knew the victim couldn’t really control how the body reacted to that much trauma, but he wasn’t really feeling gracious bedside manner at the moment.
Ron had his own list of things to change this go round.
He hadn’t died that fast the first time. He’d lived long enough to at least tell him to…
“No Weasley, I do not, except that it is an injury I had avoided by way of jump.”
Harry studied him for a while, wheels turning in his head. Harry was probably thinking of the time turner in the bowels of the ministry, of five minutes to change or save a life, to alter everything forever. “I..” he looked like he couldn’t find the words and the moment stretched endlessly, then he sighed and fell, it seemed, into defeat. “He wasn’t ever going to change,” Harry spoke into the world a truth they all knew, but speaking it felt like a betrayal of everything they all worked for. “I don’t want to say he wasn’t worth saving, but I don’t think he’d have changed if he hadn’t been a victim to it himself.” And that was the thing, wasn’t it, a person shouldn’t have had to fear for their own life to acknowledge that condemning others to death was wrong. “After the war.. I don’t know. I don’t know how I could have done more for him. One moment he was there, giving me his wand, then he was gone, and not even his parents knew where.”
“Forget?” Draco smiled, a mean little thing. “Because it never happened, because I went back, and I stopped it.”
Merlin, where was his wife when he needed her?
Draco checked the last page of his journal one last time, marking clearly what date he had finished it, before pointing his wand and casting.
It was towards the end, as Ron finished covering his tracks, that he added a key line on a whim. A comment asking to meet, on a day Ron had begged off from his family to hide under a glamour in a bar and watch the Chuddly Cannons in a match that he had swore up and down he hadn’t cared about. Ron knew it would be a flag, that he would be questioned about it, but he also knew Draco would eventually be tied to Nott. The same trail that had led investigators to his corpse last time would be followed again, and Draco would be caught up in the scandal of an illegal time turner.
Children, neglected and ostracized children especially, grew so easily attached to those who offered their hand. To have a single adult in all the school that knew you by name and smiled when you came by, the simplest of actions drew them in.
Only it wasn’t a corpse, and it was staring back. Draco Malfoy, laying exactly where he had left him, with a growing pool of blood and squinted open raw red eyes. Ron gaped, looking down at the time turner, which was indeed still running, then over to the car, still sitting quiet and ruined without wheels or a bonnet.
“Alright then Ron, good luck.”
“He was going to see you,” Ron lied again so easily, hadn’t even meant to except that he couldn’t bear to let her leave thinking her son had lived just a few kilometers away and not found her worthy of his visit. “It was what we fought over the most, coming out of hiding. When I, the last time we met he said… that he didn’t know how.” Ron recalled the journal, a line from a day he hadn’t seen as important. Draco had gone to the manor some point in the summer after 6
Though as he snuck in and out of Percy’s room, who was likely to have the most uselessly filled and discarded notebooks, he came to face another problem he’d not quite accounted for.
Ron felt a weight on him now, his stomach a cramped mess of anxiety as he looked to the very very small stack of usable parchment and the dauntingly large number of tiny blue pills still in the bottle.
“You lost a lot of blood, and those cuts are not completely healed, you need-“
The book was still on his stomach, a weight every time he breathed. He felt the impression of the hard cover against his tense fingers.
Then placing the new one on top of said book 5 he pointed his wand at the finished journal and cast.
Heh, he had a bedtime again. Ron flopped back on his bed staring up at his ceiling, exposed wood a familiar comfort. He and Harry had spelled quidditch posters to the ceiling the summer before the Quiditch World Cup, and more added after even with all the chaos of that night attack. He’d not done much before that, though his walls had some of his childhood decorations, posters he’d loved in his brother’s rooms that they gave him as they got new things, drawings they’d done, the wrappers of some of his favorite candy with witty jokes or inspirational sayings he’d wanted to save at some point. A few of his chocolate frog cards when he had first started collecting them and hadn’t wanted his mother to throw them away but before he’d gotten them their case. All making a patchwork attempt at decorations, sticky charms his parents had place for him or his brothers had cast for him in secrecy. Next summer it will be filled with Cannons posters and newspaper clippings, eventually Sirius would make his way to the wall via his adorable little sister trying to terrify him and never come down until Ron moved out.
If book 4 covered to reference book 10, Ron didn’t even want to GUESS how many other books he’d have to read, and non of them were labeled.
Draco watched the last of the students board the school buses, chattering excitedly, carefully preserved and protected formal wear all wrapped up in their arms. “You really ain’t comin?” Demaurius asked, his large square body barely squeezing through the folded doors of the old rattling bus. He wasn’t particularly tall, barely reaching to Draco’s chin, but he had always had the presence of someone so much bigger than those around him.
“Frrr-from before.”
“I asked if you were sure it as okay? I know you wanted to go too.”
“Why couldn’t you have just left well enough be you ass.” He snarled down at the corpse.
They never did, and he was beginning to suspect he was in fact the only magical presence here, on this one boat, beyond the reach of any authority hunting him. Somehow instead of relief it terrified him more. A lone wizard among muggles.
It had been a tense few days, after he had confounded his way through the ticket and security check and into an unoccupied room within the first class, constantly obliviating staff and passengers, lifting their muggle money and charming his way into meals and drinks. He had spent every waking moment hiding in his room waiting for his actions to be discovered by some magical presence aboard and the authorities brought it, for his identity to be revealed.
“I’m not going to fix your life for you.” Ron told him, though it probably wasn’t something someone should say to a dying person. Draco cracked one bloodshot eye at him and managed to grin.
Except…
No, Ron just hadn’t wanted to see. Because he knew, somehow he’d always known.
“No,” he closed his eyes again, “only one person knew it.”
“Exscribo Sensus.”
Against his intentions Ron snickered as he reinterred his room and got back to work, taking a moment to appreciate his haul, lament his loss, and eventually decide that if he ran out of material he could sacrifice his own textbooks to the bizarre raffle he was about to play with a bottle of magic pills.
Why goes back in time to the same day and follows 20 different people? It had to be 20, he had references to the location of everyone from Ginny to the Minister to the fucking house elf. He had probably followed along behind his father and their merry band of psychopaths to capture and torture the muggle family hosting the event.
In the event of travel to this year as the last Jump see accompanying reference notebooks 8,9,10 for all possible actions to take during the World Cup in regards to the established relationships and actions taken up to this date. Recommended to jump to either the end of the Hogwarts school year or the beginning of summer, most optimal dates and times to avoid conflict or interference with Harry Potter and Serious Black listed on page 3 point 2 on ref book 8.
“But it’s been… I should be..?”
He’d miss her, when he finally could go back. He’d miss a lot of people, but he’d miss her the most, her and Clavel.
The students were dancing, he could hear the beat of the drums through the walls, through the silencing charms and muffling spells and noise canceling padding of the library, you could always hear the drums in this school, like a pulse, be it the work of magic or ghosts or just good acoustics the drums always carried.
“What?”
“Love you too Dimples.”
“Damn it Malfoy.” He kicked out at Draco’s leg, but there was no reaction. There wouldn’t be, not ever again.
Ron is going back because he chooses to, its a selfish and entirely calculated action that he knows he doesn’t have to make. It’s strategy, and as an adult who has helped topple Governments and Dark Lords and is married to Hermione Granger, he’s kind of proud of his ability to plan and predict enemy moves. With Draco’s Detailed research And his own strategic brilliance he’s a little Overconfident they’ll work things out.
So why did he have a journal filled with plans to change things?
He rolled up, and wow didn’t that feel good to just bounce right up in bed no creaky back no extra padding around the gut, and snagged his wand, casting the quietest of silencing charms and lumos, shoving his glowing wand into a discarded shirt to dim it enough to sneak about without blinding anyone.
He’d reached for her, but her eyes had gone hard and furious, a twisted hatred that Draco had never seen in her, and she turned away striding along with head high and shoulders firm.
Cold.
Ron flipped the journal closed and stalked towards the muggle machinery, the same old beat up car he had last seen as a teen. How Malfoy had recovered his parent’s flying car he’d never know, but that the thing was gutted and sitting in a corner under a tarp had hurt. It had saved his life, his and Harry’s, and Malfoy had been picking it apart like a scavenger bird.
“So you don’t really know why you’re cut to ribbons?”
“Draco!” Bernadette dumped her crawfish traps on the wood floor and had him in her arms before he even noticed she’d returned. “Draco look at me. Look.” She forced his face up, her hands were hot as tears, the tears that wouldn’t come. “Ça çé mové you are so old cher, what happened?”
But he hadn’t decided on what point that was yet. Ron flopped back onto his bed as he realized this.
“I didn’t break the bloody law to travel back just to not save your pasty ass you-” Malfoy cut him off by putting a blood coated hand on his cheek and forcibly turning his head to the side, towards the array of muggle items in the corner of the shack.
Ron could tell him the exact feel of grit and condensation turned slime on stone and iron bars, the taste of metal in his mouth and the ache in his throat as he threw himself against his bindings, desperate for Hermione. The rage and pain and horror of hearing her tortured beyond his reach.
“Harry,” he wet his lips and tried to speak. They’d just left the funeral, nothing had changed from the last time except that Narcissa had walked up to him before leaving and had griped his hand in her two thin ones, white skinned and trembling, and murmured a tear choked thank you that he hadn’t deserved.  Her eyes had only met his for a moment before sliding off into the distance where his car was, for a fearful instant he thought she knew, but she had only saw it as the last thing her son had touched. “What color will you pain it?” She had asked.
Ron stood on shaky legs, not quite ready to let go of his anger. Not quite ready to let go at all. Death wasn’t new to him, but it really wasn’t anything he was comfortable with.
‘Hope that hurt, you greasy piece of shit.’ Flitted through his head just on the wrong side of repulsion, wondering how he could have forgotten that the past also included Scabbers the Rat in its list of people to deal with.
Time travel was not something that could be fully understood, because time was not a thing that could be studied, only experienced.
One more book, he promised himself, and made an anxious little spectacle of choosing just which book it was. Though it didn’t mater, of course, because he’d do the rest later, the fact that this was the last for the night made it feel like it had to make up for the others.
Draco gasped, mouth working like a fish, but the pain already stole his voice. Ron could see it now, the slow clean parting of the flesh, like some invisible knife was opening him up. Ron uncorked the first of the handful of dittany vials he’d swiped from the cabinet and began pouring it as the wounds opened, racing the lines, trying to anticipate based on his last two jumps where they would open.
Draco was a touchy subject, even after all these years. His sudden disappearance after the battle, the manhunt as the Ministry had tried to capture all fleeing DeathEaters, Harry’s near violent arguments with Kingsley and Percy and his dad about Draco and Narcissa’s role in saving them. A fight that had only doubled in intensity once Narcissa and Lucius had been arrested boarding a muggle cruise to Canada. Draco had been nowhere to be found, and no amount of interrogation had made the couple reveal his whereabouts. They had, though, been willing to cut a deal with Kingsley under Harry’s insistent pressure and the threat of an article, drafted by Luna and ready for print in her father’s next paper, of Lady Malfoy’s role in saving Harry’s life and the use of Draco’s wand in Voldemort’s eventual defeat.
He was… he was in his office. The one he shared with Harry.
And he was right, of course he was, and not just because the injury had been magically created. Ron nodded, and Harry clapped his shoulder with a flat smile and furrowed brow that didn’t quite convey any real emotion except that there were emotions involved but anything beyond mere existence didn’t need to be acknowledged. Ron made a strained looking smile back and Harry got out, clearing his throat as he held the door open for one last goodbye.
Then Ron was cut out.
“Do you know who it was?” Harry asked suddenly, staring out the window of the car as the world passed. Ron breathed deep, trying to be grateful they were talking, that he didn’t have to make the first move. “Who he was afraid of?”
Tonight he’d polish up the last loose threads of his journal, he’d already perfected the pensieve capsules, when he made his last jump he’d patent and sell it, but for now it was the perfect hiding place.
He stayed like that a minute or two, not really regretting his choices so much as cursing one nasty little ferret who had made everything sound so simple and easy in his stupid diary only to have a full on obstacle course in the follow ups, casually discussing the pros and cons of inflicting self harm to better collect a few drops from Harry Potter’s ocean of a messiah complex.
She’d turned to him, this once powerful woman, and looked at the man she saw as her husband with eyes of despair. Lucius was supposed to be in Azkaban, the breakout wouldn’t happen for a few more hours, but Draco didn’t bother to worry about this one discrepancy, he wanted to see his mother, had never stopped wanting to see her. He stood before her, a man of near 30, and wanted to run to her as keenly as he had as a child tormented by the very birds he’d just ordered the elves to rescue.
Again.
“Someone has to help Mione with Nott, and since I married her guess that’ll be me.” He said, not really remembering if that’s what he had said before. He stared down at the open file, the arrest report of one Theodore Nott, who had been found acting erratic, aggressive, and showing signs of being obliviated. With a Time Turner on his person. Harry laughed, and Ron came around his desk to crouch down by the fireplace, folder in hand and strained smile on his face. He knew what day it was now, and what time, and he didn’t have the luxury of a chat. “You take your girl, mate, I’ll handle mine.”
Taking up his and and the pill bottle he closed his eyes, wishing upon his wife’s beautiful face like he’d wish on a star, and chose blindly.
He loved them. He let that soak into him now, let it swell and fill him in a way he’d been promised he was allowed to do by the counselor. He loved his family, his kids, his wife, his friends. He loved Harry, and he loved this life they had all built for themselves. He was not regretful of it, and he knew, with a surety that Harry no doubt felt himself as he sat in this car, that they would grow and heal and move on from this tragedy. Harry and Ginny would marry, Narcissa and Andromeda would continue to devote themselves to Teddy, his father would help him finish fixing the car.
“I think, the time to save himself would have been when he met you.” Harry finally answered, meeting Ron’s eyes and there was a resolve there, a firm understanding of where they’d go from here. “I think Draco had all the chances we could give him. I don’t think Time Travel would have helped him more.”
“What-” Draco’s throat worked as a slice opened up his neck and across his jaw, “is that?”
Ron could close his eyes and see how his room would change in the years to come, but for now his ceiling was bare. It felt… like it was actually sinking in.
“No. He didn’t tell me who it was.”
Move on, move forward, instead of desperately trying to go back.
It took some doing, sneaking in and out, and some quiet contemplation as he lamented not having a Marauders Map of his own home and the obstacles he ran into or stepped on, the realization and mental ransacking of his own memories to recall if his brothers had ever told them WHEN exactly they found the map and if they had it with them now, and the likelihood of success should he try to steal it. Eventually he made it back to his room with an armful of old textbooks, discarded paperbacks, and beyond salvageable notebooks slated for transfiguring or kindling depending on the need.
It was a mistake a mistake a mistake.
House Elf Winky, possible ally, page 15 ref book 8 pros/cons points 1-10 possible scenarios to approach or capture page 16 points 1-10. Hogwarts with Winky page 17 points 1-5 Winky at Malfoy Manor page 19 points 1-7
Of course Ron was questioned, and upon producing the emails was questioned even more, why had he not revealed Draco Malfoy’s whereabouts, why had he not alerted the Ministry of his Father’s lost illegal car, what had Draco been worried about? And finally, how had he known Draco was in danger?
If only they had arrested Nott when Malfoy was still alive, instead of tracking their ties and finding the poor bastard’s corpse months old in this… muggle auto shop.
A stitch of pain tugged under Ron’s ribs, and that horrible anxious worry he’d always had but ignored simmered in his gut. The apprehension as he had fought with Harry over the trial, as he had ignored anything to do with Draco for years until the man had been found dead and rotting, ignored Harry’s closeness with Miss Malfoy. The questions he had hinted at as he search his sister’s face, asking her how everything was, and hearing just how obsessed Harry had always been. Never stopped looking, just not where Ron could see.
It only took a moment, the gel capsule dissolved as soon as it hit his mouth always leaving a sharp charcoal taste as he tried to swallow, and he was lost in visions.
“He’d been gone so long, afraid so long, I don’t think he knew how to come back. Muggles didn’t know about him, didn’t judge him, he was safe. Until someone found him.” Ron covered her hands with his other one, they were cold and gripped him so tightly, like he was her last lifeline. Just off a ways Harry and Andromeda stood silently, facing each other like they were in conversation, but listening intently to his every word. “I didn’t know who, but he was being pressured into something.” Another lie, but Ron wasn’t supposed to know they’d tied it to the Nott case yet. “And it was starting to scare him, I know they threatened to reveal him, and he… if he was going to live like a wizard again he wanted to face you first. He made me promise not to say anything until he told you.” Ron squeezed her hands, “He was going to tell you.”
“You too mate, have fun.”
“Merlin Malfoy, do you think I’ve the skills to do this myself?” Ron gagged as the freshly healed parts of the wounds started to peel apart in front of his very eyes. “This is so far beyond anything I can handle.”
The world didn’t end just because Draco Malfoy had died. In fact, if Draco had taken a moment to accept his fate, to look at his past choices and mistakes and all the bad he’d done and just found the will to do better, BE better, he wouldn’t have lost his life in the first place. He had a family, a home, and a support network waiting for him, if he had only mustered the strength to return to it.
“Not you,” Draco scoffed, “You just take the journals, find something else to give my memories to, and not me either. I’ll be no help to you even with them.”
He knew he blinked, because he had the strange feeling that he could hear each eyelid like the soft thump of his own heart beat.
“He didn’t seem in danger though,” Ron supplied, gripping the wheel in frustration as he elaborated on his story, the same excuse he’d given the Aurors who demanded why he hadn’t brought Draco in for protection. “He was nervous, but he had been the same when we’d first met. Took us forever to finally meet up, and when he saw me he just went pale. Like I was a dementor there to steal his soul.” Harry’s fingers gripped the handle above the window a little tighter. “I think if he had a wand he’d have cursed me, I don’t really remember how I felt. Shocked, I guess. It took me a second to recognize him. He’d grown a bit of a beard, I was more interested in his auto shop, thinking “Dad would love this place,” then I looked at him and he looked so fucking terrified I thought someone was behind me and turned. Then he passed out.”
The bus headed off after that, two long yellow boxes that Draco and Clavel did their best to keep rattling on for just one more year. Just one more year. Just one more year.
“Do you know the counter spell?”
He wandered to it, flipping the pages back to the passage that made his decision for him, though the whole rotten thing had been one guilt trip after another.
“Don’t be an idiot Weasley,” Draco huffed a laugh, “it’s been far longer than five minutes already.”
He could still hear the screams.
She’d only been gone an hour, just to go down and collect the traps for dinner, but an hour was more than enough for several jumps. He was just going to revisit a few places, just to observe, no changes, nothing important that would need too much writing. He had promised not to get lost in his work.
Something shuddered, like a heart palpitation, and Ron remembered only then that he had literally just woken up as an eleven year old boy who had never used a wand in his life, no matter how he had begged his older brothers to just try it out, and this wand in particular had never done exactly as he’d liked.
The notes went on and on in a similar vein, Ron skimmed after the first 3 pages, feeling that same sick ache in his gut as when he had first seen his second hand wand and it’s exposed core. Malfoy’s methodical plotting of how he could create minor changes in his relationship with Harry, Hermione, and him, mostly focusing on stealing the poor house elf Crouch had been using, and then how to get through Ministry protocols until his father collected him, or how to reunite with his father if they didn’t detain him.
P.S. I'm very sorry if I have completely messed up Hagrid's accent.
Frightened emerald eyes locked onto the shocked murky brown of the bartender. Harrys’ mind reeled in confusion as the man; Tom? Was that what Hagrid had called him?: rushed from behind the bar and grasped his hand tightly, pumping it up and down furiously. How did this man know his name? Harry was certain he had never met the man before, and he had a scruffy hard worked look about him that said he was most assuredly not welcome with the Dursleys. Harry didn’t have long to ponder the surrealness of someone knowing his name as pure pandemonium  had erupted the moment Tom had reached him. Harrys’ confusion morphed to terror as the pubs patrons rushed forward, pushing and shoving each other in an attempt to reach him.
Hagrid leaned forward slightly, his face and voice hopeful. “How will yeh be wantn’ me teh help sir? It’s only professors what can fetch students yeah?”
Dumbledore took a few moments to survey the man in front of him. Standing over 8feet tall and being wide enough to have to squeeze through most doors sideways, Hagrid was quite the impressive figure. His long dark tangles hair and beard coupled with his small dark eyes gave him a wild dangerous look that belied his softer that kitten fur nature. Dumbledore was certain Hagrid was the perfect choice to seen after young Harry as not many were brave enough to hassle the giant man.
As Flitwick rounded the corner vanishing form view, Fawkes flashed back to the headmaster’s office. With the return of his familiar and noting the late hour, Dumbledore made his way to his bed humming contently as he went. Fawkes watched the wizard as he settled himself for the nigh. Tucking his head under a wing Fawkes drifted into a peaceful sleep, content in the knowledge that Albus Dumbledore would learn only a fool willingly breaks a promise to a phoenix.
Fawkes knew he would get to see young Harry again if they could get his letter to him. Something along the lines of a thousand letters had be sent to the young boy with no reply to be he had. It was most curious and was the reason behind Dumbledore’s pacing. Just as Fawkes was beginning to think he might take that nap after all, Albus began muttering to himself. This was not a habit Albus had ever indulged in in the may long years that Fawkes had known him and thus shocked him into true wakefulness.
Fawkes gave a soft musical trill, bobbing his head in affirmation before flying to a nearby banister to watch Filius gather his things. As a half goblin Filius was well suited to the task he did not know he had been set: exposing the abuse of Harry Potter. Magically powerful, cleaver, and long-lived goblins cherish children more than any other magical race because of their low birth rates. Child abuse is a crime punishable by death under goblin law. Fawkes knew this ingrained knowledge would make Flitwick’s reaction to Dumbledore’s lies and Harrys abuse extraordinary.
Harry stood nervously outside of the classroom on the 3rd floor. He was trying to muster up the nerve to knock, but his arm didn’t seem to want to move. ‘He may not even be in there.’ Harry reasoned with himself.
“G’night.” Harry said as he headed in the direction of the boys dorms. All of the students who had elected to come back to Hogwarts for an 8th year had been moved to their own set of dorms away from the other students. This was mostly because the 8th years had been given some liberties that the younger students didn’t have such as being allowed to leave the school grounds whenever they wished and not actually having a curfew. Seeing as they were all legally adults McGonagall had seen no reason to set such restrictions so long as they were respectful and acted responsibly.
“No.” He paused. “Will you be my boyfriend?”
“I don’t want to fight or argue. I just want to finish this year at Hogwarts. I was hoping we could try to put the past behind us.” Harry tried to be as open as possible so Draco would believe him. He really didn’t see a point to their feud anymore. Draco seemed to think about it for a long time before he nodded.
“They don’t really fit I suppose I just haven’t gotten around to going shopping.” Harry said feeling a bit embarrassed. He didn’t really care what he was wearing when he was on the run from Voldemort, but he supposed he should try to dress a little nicer since he could actually go out and shop for himself now. Draco made a frustrated noise and finally settled on an over sized black t-shirt that was a little wrinkled, but didn’t have any holes and a pair of jeans that only had one hole in the knee.
“You didn’t eat dinner.” Harry stated. Draco frowned at the box.
“You’re one to talk.” Harry said as he held up a pair of briefs. Draco tisked and flicked his wand at the article of clothing. It folded itself and dropped into the trunk. Draco continued his packing, but Harry could see his ears turning red. Once the trunk was all packed Draco tapped it with his wand. It floated up between them and he led it from the room. Harry followed him out and kept an eye on the glaring boil-covered Slytherins in the back of the room. Once they reached the main floor Draco stopped Harry.
"Er right thanks."
As Harry neared the corridor that Malfoy was in he ducked into an alcove and pulled on the invisibility cloak. He checked the map again and saw that Malfoy’s dot was moving out of the room and down the hall. He was debating between leaving it alone and following Malfoy when he heard voices around the corner. He’d been so focused on Malfoy’s dot that he hadn’t noticed three other dots coming up on the hallway as well. Harry rounded the corner to walk past them.
“I’ve got it from here you can go ahead and join up with your pals now.” Draco waved him off.
“If I cannot be seen like this, don’t you think it would be best if only I were under the cloak?” Draco asked once again spelling it out.
It had been four days since that conversation and while Draco did stay in the 8th year dorms he continued to make himself scarce. He was never seen in the common room and he only stayed in the dorms to sleep. The rest of the time no one was really sure where he went. Aside from Harry, of course, who could be found rather frequently referencing a folded scrap of parchment. He wasn’t even being subtle about checking the map anymore which is why on the 4th morning of Draco avoiding everyone else Harry pulled out the map and checked it while eating breakfast at the Gryffindor table. He heard Hermione sigh on his left and Ron snickered on his right. He ignored them both and continued searching the map. He finally spotted the familiar dot once again in the empty classroom on the 3rd floor. Harry frowned at that. What was in that room that made him keep going there?
“So, you and Malfoy…” Ron said trailing off.
“I don’t know.” Harry said.
“Er, no, I’m not.” Harry was slightly worried about where this was going. His heart was hammering. He was only inches from Malfoy’s chest.
“Oh, right you would have been really well off standing in the middle of the hallway in the buff.” Harry shot back heatedly. Draco didn’t seem to have much to say about that. He frowned and looked around them.
“oh. OH, Yes. Right.” Harry quickly slipped out from under the cloak, but kept his hand curled around the hem. “What are you going to do?” Harry asked.
“And we know you know where to find him.” Ron said with finality. Harry slouched back into the couch.
“You always wanted me to come to you if anything was wrong, right?” He asked getting right to the point.
Actually, that gave him an idea. Harry’s eyes slid to the extra bed next to his that still stood in the room. The one that was supposed to belong to Malfoy. After another moment of thought Harry made up his mind and started heading for the door as Draco finished pulling on the pair of trainers.
Harry hesitated.
Harry had never been the best with words, so he made a quick decision and leaned forward. He paused when his lips were millimeters from Draco’s, giving him the chance to pull away. Instead of pulling back Draco closed the gap and sealed his lips on Harry’s. Relief washed through Harry and he deepened the kiss. His brain was short circuiting, he couldn’t believe this was really happening. He leaned forward and one of his hands slid from Draco’s hip to his back. Draco stumbled back a little, but Harry was holding onto him. One of Draco’s hands went to cup his face, the other sliding into his hair at the nape of his neck. Harry shivered at the sensation and swiped his tongue over Draco’s. Draco moaned and that lit a fire in Harry’s chest.
“I’m naked.” Harry’s face flamed.
“Two of those three were from your own house. What if they’re waiting for you back at the dorms?” Draco didn’t immediately respond to that. Harry wished he could see his face to try to gauge what he was thinking.
“Which one?” She asked sounding exasperated.
“Ugh. It is.” The middle one answered, a girl with short brown hair looking to be about the same age except she wore Ravenclaw robes.
Harry was phenomenally confused by whatever Ron was trying to say but he could tell he was trying to be a good friend so he just accepted it.
There's some smut in this chapter. Not a ton, but you have been warned.
“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted this.” Harry told him. Draco’s eyes snapped open and searched his face for any sign of a lie. When he found none he swallowed hard.
“You’re wardrobe really is quite horrendous.” Draco informed him as he pulled out a very over sized shirt and tossed it to the side.
“…I care about you too.”
“Hm.” He heard on his right and turned quickly to find Ron had read the note over his shoulder.
“I’m going to go put these away.” Harry told them, clearing his throat. Hermione and Ron made eye contact.
“No one will bother you anywhere else either if I have anything to say about it.” Draco snorted, but secretly loved the protectiveness in his voice.
He must have sounded as helpless as he felt because Narcissa suddenly had a concerned frown on her face.
“You wouldn’t.”
“Honestly Potter where did these come from? There’s no way any of this would have ever fit you. They can’t possibly be your clothes.”
“I’m aware.”
“Maybe when you’re looking, but when you’re not he never stops looking at you.” Hermione informed him. “And now the gift…”
“What do you mean? He’s practically avoiding me at all costs.” He insisted trying not to sound hurt. This seemed to only spur them on.
“They’re hand me downs from my cousin. He was rather large and the charms I use wear off after a while.” Harry explained distractedly as he waved his wand and started shrinking the clothes. The spell wasn’t necessarily supposed to be used on clothes which is why it wore off and the clothes never looked like they fit just right, but it did the job of making them more wearable and that was all Harry had needed before. He wore his school robes most of the time anyway. Draco was looking rather confused now.
“Lucius made his own choices in the first war and they carried over to this one. There is nowhere to place blame except with him. I’m certain your speaking on our behalf was the sole reason he was given a reduced sentence rather than a life sentence and that is much more than we expected.” When Harry looked up next Narcissa was giving him a light smile. “I believe it is best to put the past behind us and try to continue on. It won’t be easy, but I’m sure we’ll manage.”
“You shouldn’t thank me. I likely wouldn’t have if Draco hadn’t still been in the school.” There was defiance in her eyes telling him not to argue. To not make her out to be a hero when her intentions had never been to save Harry.
He backed Draco up another step until they were fully in the room and closed the door behind them. As soon as he heard the door snap shut Draco surged forward and pressed Harry against the door, kissing him with new vigor. It was Harry’s turn to moan into the kiss. His hands slid back to Draco’s hips and he followed the waistband to the Slytherin’s back. One hand slid down to cup Draco’s arse the other slid up Draco’s shirt to explore the bare skin of his back. Draco groaned and their lips separated briefly.
"G'night." He replied as he climbed into bed and pulled up the covers.
“Why didn’t you move in there in the first place?” Draco seemed to contemplate him before answering.
“um.” Harry said intelligently doing his very best to not let his eyes wander. He may have caught sight of thin white scars on Malfoy’s chest and then a black shape on his left wrist before Malfoy turned his wrist towards himself effectively blocking it from view. He forced himself to drag his eyes back up to meet Malfoy’s icy ones. He found it equally hard to maintain eye contact and decided it was a losing battle no matter where he looked.
“Potter.” He said flatly.
“Go get him.” Ron said giving Harry a light shove off the couch.
“Why is that?” she asked, not pressing, but at least sounding like she cared about his answer and maybe that’s why he told her what had been on his mind.
Draco swiftly walked to the dormitories and led Harry into the room. Draco walked to the bed at the end and started opening drawers and packing his trunk. Harry mostly just stood off to the side, but couldn’t help himself when he peered into the trunk. He saw an article of clothing and his lips twitched.
Once, earlier in the year Harry had overheard a couple of younger Gryffindors trying to antagonize Malfoy while he was in the library. Malfoy had simply continued working and ignored the ugly words from the younger students. Annoyed, Harry had immediately stormed over and told them off. When he turned around Malfoy had left and Harry felt vaguely disappointed.
Harry thought back to the summer leading up to this year. He had gone to Malfoy manner to return the wand he stole and Narcissa had invited him in for tea. He hadn’t felt capable of refusing so he found himself in the sitting room of Malfoy manner, back rigid in a chair sipping tea with his childhood nemesis’ mother. She asked after his health politely and he stuttered out an answer that he was fine and he hoped she was as well. There was a minute of awkward silence before Harry couldn’t come up with anymore polite conversation and said what was on his mind.
He thought about the interaction every so often and used it as his excuse to feel no guilt about pulling out the map and looking it over to find the dot that read Draco Malfoy, which is exactly what he did that night before going to bed. He did it most nights now that he thought about it.
“I would like that too.” He said quietly.
Harry smiled back and gave a small nod. The conversation turned to lighter topics if a little stilted, but Harry relaxed in his chair a little.
“We love you Harry.” Hermione told him as they broke apart. She kept her hand on his back and Ron kept his arm around Harry’s shoulders.
He glanced over to the couch that he was laying in front of. ‘Well, maybe not too alone.’ he thought as he subtly observed Ron and Hermione cuddling on the couch. It wasn’t uncommon for his two best friends to show affection in public like this seeing as they were a couple. It also wasn’t uncommon for Harry to feel a little lonely when he saw it. He was immensely happy for them of course, but sometimes he wondered of he would ever achieve that level of intimacy with someone else. He wondered if anyone would be able to see past the scar on his forehead and treat him like a normal person. That he could be a person someone else loved just for the pure fact that he was Harry, not the savior of the Wizarding world. Just Harry. He let out a slow breath and cast a quick tempus. It was nearly eleven. He took another moment to take in the warmth of the fire before he heaved himself up.
“Isn’t that the Malfoy prat?” one of the Slytherins asked gesturing in front of them. He was a taller slim boy probably in his 6th year. Harry slowed down, but the group continued to walk several yards behind Malfoy.
“I wanted to thank you.” Harry blurted out. “For lying for me. You saved my life.” Narcissa carefully set her tea back on her saucer.
“Are you sure?” Harry received a very deadpan look in response. “Alright, but you better actually go up to the dorms. I will write her if I have to.” Draco paled slightly before his ears reddened again and Harry grinned. “I’ll see you later then.” Harry said and walked off to enter the great hall for dinner.
"What?" He asked. Ron's lips twitched.
“Back to your dorm.” Draco’s confusion only grew.
“Back in the Slytherin dorms?” Harry asked.
“You know what I mean, like, together. A couple.” There were only two other people in the common room, and they appeared to be on their way out. Ron kept his voice low, but Harry still felt the need to look around to make sure no one had heard.
“Thank you, Potter, but I can get on without your help. You needn’t run to my aid at every opportunity.” He spat sounding rather annoyed. Harry was only incensed by his words.
“Which is why we’re moving your things to the 8th year dorm where they should have been in the first place.” Draco didn’t seem to know how to respond to that. He seemed torn between the decision to be rude or follow Harry’s lead and be civil. There was silence and then a lot of jumbled words while Draco settled on what to say.
“Mate. You really can’t see it?”
Harry sighed as he stared at the dot lingering in the Slytherin dorms. He wondered what the blonde’s problem was. Couldn’t he see that he was only trying to help. That he was trying to resolve the animosity between them. He was still examining the map when Ron came into the dorms. Harry cleared the map and put it away in his trunk. When he turned around Ron was watching him.
“I wasn’t very hungry.” Draco answered still not taking the box. Harry shrugged and set the box down on top of Draco’s trunk.
“There’s the hero complex.”
“I think I’ll head to bed.” He announced to Ron and Hermione.
Harry merely hummed noncommittally and continued walking. Draco grumbled the rest of the way to the common room and once they arrived Harry waited patiently for Draco to open the door. Draco threw an irritated look at Harry before giving the password and leading them inside. Immediately heads turned to stare at golden boy Harry Potter walking into the Slytherin common room. Harry was thankful most of the students were still at dinner or this would be even worse.
‘Okay fine.’ Harry thought. ‘Big guns.’
Harry walked over and stood in front of Draco. He extended his hand. Draco’s lips twitched up at the action and he reached out and shook Harry’s hand. His hand was cool and soft in Harry’s. Right about then is when Ron walked into the room and Harry and Draco released each other’s hands.
Harry froze.
“No one in the 8th year dorms will lay a finger on you.” Harry assured him sounding determined and certain of his words before his voice softened. “Which is more than I can say for those other students, so I would appreciate it if you’d move your things in.”
“Thanks for the clothes.” Harry said. That surprised a laugh out of Draco.
“I know, but I expected any room you inhabited to be drenched in Gryffindor colors.” Harry rolled his eyes at that and flipped his trunk open.
"No problem. G'night Harry." He said as he grabbed his bed clothes and headed to the bathroom.
Harry tightened his arms around Draco. It wouldn’t be easy, but they would be okay and for the first time since the war ended Harry knew what he wanted.
"Really?" Harry asked felling a little skeptical of Ron's words.
“What do you mean together?”
“You’re naked.” It was his turn to point it out now. Malfoy huffed from under the cloak.
“Yes. I’ll be your boyfriend.” Harry let out a breathy laugh and they kissed again until Harry felt like his lungs would burst if he didn’t get regular air. They pulled back and tidied each other up.
Once back at the common room he saw no sign of Ron or Hermione and headed up to the dorms. Draco was the only one in the room so far. He looked mildly nervous when the door opened but relaxed a little when he realized it was Harry. Harry held up the box of food and went to hand it to Draco.
His face warmed.
“Hm. What’s that spell you mentioned the other day?” The third one asked the girl quietly, another boy around the same age with sandy blond hair and also in Slytherin robes.
“You’re right.” He admitted sounding unenthusiastic.
Harry took a deep breath.
“Um. Well.” He couldn’t really think of much else to say. He felt a little helpless and decided to just go for honesty. “I’m not really sure.”
“Why are you doing all this?” He sounded suspicious.  Harry frowned in response.
“God, Harry.” He breathed, and that absolutely set Harry off all over again. Harry whirled them around so he had Draco pressed against the wall next to the door. He kissed him hard and pulled Draco’s hips against his own desperately needing the contact and gasped at the stiffness he felt press against him. When he pulled his face back Draco was beautifully flushed but wouldn’t meet his eyes.
“Doesn’t really matter. You can borrow my trainers to get back to the dorms.” Harry was bothered by the thought of Draco going back to the Slytherin dorms when his own housemates were so antagonistic. Truth be told he was bothered by Malfoy being anywhere that he couldn’t keep an eye on him. He had promised to keep an eye on things to Narcissa after all.
“There’s nothing to see.” Harry insisted. Hermione frowned.
“I recently had a very similar conversation with Draco.” She informed him. Harry’s eyebrows shot up.
“This cloak is rather thin.” He commented.
“Why would I be dating Draco?” Harry asked sounding slightly frantic. Ron gave Hermione a pleading look.
“Yeah, mum’d kill you if you didn’t thank him.” Ron added. “Manners and all that rubbish.”
“Now?” Harry asked, alarmed.
“McGonagall wanted to have a word. Draco Malfoy will be staying with us in the 8th year dorms and she didn’t want any fuss over it so she warned me and asked me to mention it to anyone who may have a problem. She says we’re to leave each other alone and not get into any fights.”
"Weird. It's impossible for her to of survived that. Did you have a healer with you?" Harry could see the boys confusion whirling around, and felt the giddy excitement rising in himself.
Both boys nodded again, "She's gonna be our baby sister!"
H: It sounds like she loved you.
"I-I'm sorry." He hiccuped, wiping his eyes on his sleeve. Severus stepped to the side, "I got S-Sev'rus cause you was hurted a-and," another small hiccup and a quiet sob, "I din' wan you t-to be hurted."
Harry did so, and Draco looked at him expectantly, "Go on kid, he's waiting." Draco took the quill from Harry and began to write.
"Well I have too much money and nothing to buy, so it only makes sense that I spoil you."
"Just a spur of the moment, sir. And thank you. I was actually wondering if there is any etiquette class? Not for the entire school, just Slytherins. Because as a Slytherin I do not wish for myself to be made fun of or to make a fool of myself. I have learned of it, and follow it, but it was from a very old book, and I am unsure how accurate it is. Plus, I sense over a quarter of the students in this room to be muggle raised half-bloods, and there is three muggleborns that I have personally noticed."
T: His name was Karkoden Thomas Black.
"Do you have any evidence, memories perhaps?"
Ginny and Karkoden were safely under a silencing charm, drawing.
"You okay?"
"Where to first, young man?"
Harry was grateful Tom didn't ask about his family. But still confused.
S: I don't doubt you are.
Since the boy went through his cleansing, his true looks came to seep through. His hair curled, and was growing darker, his freckles faded and eyes glowed in a way that was true to the Black line. He lost some pudge, and shot up about four inches. He was still slightly recognisable as a Weasley, but Narcissa said his old looks would be gone by the time he would go back to school, if he wanted to.
"Only for a few hours, love. I'll be back before you know it. I'm going to get you things, okay?"
Once the great feast was finished, a sixth year prefect lead all the first years to the first year common room, telling them all the password was 'pureblood'. How unique of them, Harry thought, smirking. Once all the first years were in a line, the prefects started talking, Professor Snape standing in the background.
Harry was eight now. Tom was eager to meet him, the boy had only grown stronger and was itching to get his wand, to hurt everyone that wronged him. Besides Tom of course, because he helped more than harmed him.
Draco and Ginny got along very well, and Narcissa planned on doing a mental evaluation on her, because she showed to be at similar levels to Draco when he was regressed. Narcissa assumed it was the trauma, but she wasn't sure how the girl would cope when Draco went back to school.
"Erm, hi," He managed, after swallowing.
The court room was silent, before minister fudge nodded, and called Lucius up in her place, with a word of viewing the memories and physical proof after the hearing.
The two made their way down the alley, Harry sticking impossibly close to Severus.
Just as they swished out of sight with the green flames, Draco's lip started quivering,  and Harry sighed, "Now, don't cry. Come on, its lunch after this period, then straight after we have potions, then we can go straight back to our dorm." He explained clearly and took the smaller boys hand, leading him to their common room. Draco nodded solemnly, hugging a white teddy bear to his chest, which adorned a black tie and top hat.
