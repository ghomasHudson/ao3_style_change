“Well, don’t hold it in,” muttered Draco, over the sound of clattering. “I wouldn’t want you to strain your poor Gryffindor soul.”
“You have time,” she told him. “You can take your time. To just think. But…I would just say, make sure you choose things for the right reasons. That’s all, Harry.”
“I think I’m gay,” said Oceania thoughtfully.
Malfoy’s eyes went big over the edge of the flask. “
“I’m not saying you have to do anything about it,” Harry continued. “That’s not why I’m telling you. It’s just – I thought it should be said. It seemed like the right thing to do.”
“No.” Harry sat down and put the file on the table. “He said they were fine.”
“Alright,” he said, feeling Malfoy’s eyes on him as he answered. “Sure.”
“I have an idea for your visual poem,” Malfoy said when whatever euphoria he’d been held in had subsided enough to speak again. He wiped the corner of his lips with the napkin.
“I know
Blaise lifted both of his very pointed brows. “
Jane sat down, resting her head on one outstretched talon and lolling it to the side as she stared at Harry.
“I’m not sure,” said Harry. “I think I’m having a bit of an identity crisis, maybe. Other than that, all fine.”
“Oh yeah?” Charlie leaned in conspiratorially, his expression very serious. “That’s okay, Harry. Don’t you worry. Just tell me about them.”
said Harry. He knew he wasn’t earning himself any brownie points, but it was the
Draco looked at him. Then he looked away. He was about to lose his temper. He did not like to lose his temper at work.
“No, I –” Harry yanked out a handful of grass with his fist. “No, I knew, but. But.” He sighed. “I didn’t know it was a real thing.”
been presumptuous.”
“Unfortunately,” he said, turning back to face the table. “I have not. My apologies.”
“Have you,” Harry says. “Have you ever thought about going somewhere? Like, together?”
“Urm.” Harry cleared his throat. He was careful not to look at Malfoy. “Yes. I did.”
“What?” he asked, banishing the image from his mind.
The straw paused for a moment. Then it started stirring the other way.
“Oh. Urm. Not really. I mean sometimes. In the back of my mind.”
Malfoy doesn’t talk to her about it after. In fact, neither of them talk about anything – Harry slips out the next morning, and goes home and showers until her skin wrinkles on all the pads of her fingers. She then sits down, on her bed, and lies back to stare at the ceiling.
Harry swallowed again. A breeze rushed over the skin of the loch, wrinkling it, and Harry closed his eyes in time to feel it on his eyelids.
He looked back over at him. Draco was watching him closely.
“Thanks,” Harry had said. His eyes had been burning a hole into Draco’s skull.
Eventually the person said: “Draco,” without turning around. Malfoy’s body relaxed.
Like…how…” He trailed off, unable to help making yet another awkward hand gesture.
Malfoy raised the point of his chin. “No, it’s just the place. An educational opportunity, you can’t pass it up.” He paused thoughtfully. “A cornucopia of cultural wealth.” Another pause. “A fecund field of cognisance.”
Malfoy huffed out a half-laugh. Then, also like he couldn’t help himself: “I don’t know many straight men who crochet.”
Charlie was perfectly eager to have Harry join, despite having never been particularly close. When Harry had asked how to prepare, Charlie had said, “Just bring a positive attitude Harry! That’s all any of us need around here. But just, you know, make sure it’s sturdy.”
“Stop,” ordered Malfoy, “Stop moving. If you move I’ll fuck it up.”
“I see them,” said Draco. Pansy and Blaise raised a brow at him in eerie unison.
I'm afraid this chapter had more weight than crack, since I have to have *something* to work with. Regardless, I hope it still makes sense with what's come before. I wrote most of this just now, a direct result of reading Lettered's new chapters of By The Grace. Who else is reading it? Surely everyone in the drarry community (god, what a phrase). Please, fangirl about it with me. Lettered has singlehandedly ruined my life, and dominatrix Draco exists merely to lap at the wounds.
Charlie stared at him and Harry shifted uncomfortably.
Luna handed him the mug with green tassel on it. They both drank in silence. It really was pretty good hot chocolate.
Oceania stared at them blankly, which was so unlike her that it was highly disconcerting. Harry’s darted looks between the two of them.
She turned back to knitting. Harry openly stared at her, and wondered if she was high right now. It occurred to him that it was quite possible that she was always high, and that it had simply escaped his notice (which wasn’t a difficult manoeuvre).
There wasn’t much to do once he was done. He was grateful it was evening. He cleaned his teeth, and fell asleep almost immediately anyway.
Draco takes off her coat and pulls out a surviving cup. She’s just reaching for the pot when the unfamiliar catches her eye.
“Malfoy,” he said, and heard Malfoy shift his head on the grass next to him. “How did you know you were gay?”
She said, “So, it’s finally starting.”
“Alright there?”
Harry blinked down at it. He couldn’t quite get his body to work as fast as normal.
“Vise.”
Harry felt more
He liked it when it worked out like that.
,” said Draco, and then kept saying it.
The door opened. A familiar voice was saying, “You’re lat- ” but promptly cut off. Harry looked up.
Draco turned around. Low and behold; t’was Harry Fuckwit-Potter.
Harry waved, an awkward little flop.
“That's good,” says Harry, still smiling. “It's the chemical in male sweat that releases the gay into your brain.”
Harry had never considered himself religious. But even he wasn’t stupid enough that he couldn’t see the appeal.
“Hey,” said Draco. Harry smiled. There was so much sweetness in his chest.
Harry felt everything inside him freeze up.
Harry stopped reaching for his suitcase. He straightened up.
“At least someone likes me.”
Draco leaned down. For a moment Harry thought he was going to put his mouth on it and made to stop him, but then Draco went higher and licked a stripe up Harry’s abdomen.
“You’ve been here before, too,” he said. It wasn’t a question.
Harry turned his head, smirking. Malfoy really was leaning. “Is that financial literacy I smell?”
It was probably a little bit sacrilegious to turn up to a religious festival with a hangover.
He began his practice.
“Draco,” said Harry, and his voice had the gravelly edge to it that was so loved. “I’m asking you out because I want you, you idiot. Can’t you tell?”
“It’s more like silence. When something in you goes silent. Then you know.”
They sat in silence for a few moments, marinating in their own bowling deficiencies and sipping on the soft drinks. The bowling alley was nice, slightly run-down, and now mostly empty, an upshot of having spent the last hour here. There were strips of neon lights decorating the ceiling, which Harry supposed made the excitement of rolling a ball down the length of a corridor until it hit something even more exhilarating.
“Treat
“I need to just –” He tried to point towards the cafeteria, but it was a vague flapping gesture.
On fifth morning, he decided to try adding mediation to the end of his practices. On sixth, Hayden caught him as he was heading back to the hotel.
Or maybe none of that had been a lie. Maybe Malfoy was right. He’d said that Harry didn’t see him as a proper person, and he had been right. Draco Malfoy, Hogwarts pupil, had been a complete and utter prick, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t a human being.
There was a pause. Then he felt Draco lean forward in his seat. “Like what?”
With his eyes closed, it was like he was in the clearing again. He could smell the grass; could feel the cool air on his cheek. Everything became very, very clear. It was like these last few weeks had been a dream – everything else had been a bad memory. This was real. Harry felt real.
Draco hitched his hip. Really, he had nothing to lose.
“I live close by,” said Harry, knowing now that he had been trying to say it all evening. “No wine, but there’s firewhiskey.”
He got a glass of water. Leaned there with one light on above him, white and lonely. He drank the water. He put it down in the sink, and then he closed his eyes.
She came over immediately, wrapping her arms around his head and pulling him into her chest tightly. Harry reached for her too, desperately, and somehow she ended up in his lap, clutching onto him. She had started crying again. He was crying just a bit too, and buried his face in her shoulder to hide it. She smelled like childhood and cleverness and
Harry scrambled up and stepped away, turning to cover his face. “God,” he said through his hands and tears. He hated the way his voice sounded. “Don’t.”
“Do you think you’re selfish, Harry?” asked Hayden slowly. Harry stared at their mouth again, and as he did he remembered something he had been curious about earlier, but now suddenly seemed crucial.
There was a brief silence. Then the girl held out a hand. “I’m Oceania,” she said, “What do you like to be called?”
Something pink squirmed in Harry’s stomach. His breath caught in his throat, and he couldn’t get it to keep going down.
He didn’t know what he had expected to happen now he had come back. The blue inside him was thriving, already being so familiar with its surroundings. Surely, it hadn’t been so bad when he was away?
“The hell you haven’t.” Charlie slapped his back mannishly, in a way that reminded Harry so abruptly and acutely of Ron that it almost hurt. “You came here, didn’t you, on your own? Ready to learn? And you’ve done so much. Just look at you.”
“Let him sleep it off,” said Malfoy, “That way, come morning, he can pretend it never happened and we can pretend it isn’t our fault.”
Harry threw up his arms as well.
“Fuck it,” said Harry. “You know what? Sure. Let’s do my fucking makeup.”
“Yes.” Harry felt himself smiling. He leaned back further. “I have to stay in character sometimes.”
Malfoy opened and closed his mouth. “My routine?”
“Mind if I sit beside you?”
For a beginning.
It was once a library. A family archive of books and papers. In the most technical terms it still was. The large open space still had rows upon rows of books and the walls were all covered well. Draco had been seven when he’d begged for his own barre and dancing space. He’d begged for one of the off rooms in the library to be his. He’d cried and whined and refused to eat for weeks.
“Get a haircut”
“Mum and Sis are in there.”
“...Nah” He answered slowly.
He’d never seen male ballet dancers before. He agreed with Ginny in his head. They looked
“Why are we even doing contemporary?” Harry groaned.
He smiled with cruelty, a smile he’d learned from Vincent. ”Oh I can agree with the latter. Pompously rich? Slso yes. Don’t think I can’t see the hypocrisy though
Moody walked over and dropped the halls keys into his hand like he did most days. “Stay here until you get that punch right. Give the keys to Mrs Weasley after.”
Draco found Harry not caring made Draco want to speak more. “It’s like my entire life takes place in the afternoons here, and no matter how cold it gets the sky is always stained orange. We seem to live during a constant sunset.”
“I don’t remember, I was a baby.”
The rest of the year. Children going through it. A runaway, A transfer.
Harry kept the ballet class on his mind. He tried not to. Something about what he had done felt wrong. Dirty. He's sure Amos wouldn't have approved and ignoring the one time try would have been for the best. He attempted to dismiss it. Try as he might though it was impossible.
She see’s Cedric walk across the kitchen and easily picks him up onto the table. “Dance.” He commands.
Harry felt an offended sting in his chest, mostly because her words were true. He stayed silent until he realised, “Hey! You're a dancer too.”
“Did it behind his back for a while.”
The afternoon was warm and orange like most afternoons were. Harry looked around and huffed. Ron lived in the nice part of town. He had a lawn and the people near their home owned dogs. Molly opened the door and tilted her head at the sight of Harry.
It had been almost a week when she finally looked up from their dinner table and announced.
She didn’t bat an eyelash before introducing herself, seemingly knowing he didn't remember who she was. “Hermione.”
Harry quickly hung up and paced around in a trance. Cedric walked in and looked confused by the sight. “What’s going on?”
He gets closer but Amos doesn’t stop walking. There's a shake in his step and the other miners look away.
and fall into amateur moves. Many including yourself will find it easy to
Harry's glad the sky is pink and the wind is warm. "Did you ever meet James Potter?"
Cedric doesn’t say much. He’s stressed Harry can tell. The only encouraging words he gets are few.
“Obviously. I think Seamus wants to hunt while ‘Mione wants to find. Other than that—Dean, Lavender, Parvati and I want to find a clearing to play soccer.”
Harry sighed. “I guess? I—I mean I have to be.”
Ron snorts. “Only barley. Ginny disconnected the landline so you couldn’t call mum the day of your audition. She tried to stop you from going.”
"W—well it's like the ground is so hot you know? Or I am. It's like, my feet have to move or I'll burn. I have to dance or there won't be an I anymore."
“It’s okay. It’s
“Put that on.”
“Good.”
“This isn’t the way son.”
“Doesn't matter! The mere fact that I was in such an incident makes me dubious enough.” Draco countered.
Draco had seen her dance though, and she was terrible. She was terrible and she didn’t care. It was an insult to the ballet.
Draco was a little taken aback, he hadn’t noticed
“There's a difference between dance and contact sports.”
He pulls on his father's coat and walks backwards to face him.
“Here.” Ron pulls Harry’s hand towards himself and lets them rest on the inside of his jacket.
“I am,” said Harry. He was getting good at this honesty thing.
“It’s not –” said Draco, and swallowed. “Okay. That’s…okay. Thank you.”
“She’s always liked me better,” Pansy drawled, her lids still lowered. “I can do everything you can do, but with cleavage.”
“Alright, alright.” Malfoy took his wrist away and stared straight ahead. “I s’pose it’s just like…the build. And like, hands. And – shoulders and stuff.”
“Oh,” she said, and smiled. “Hey. You alright?”
Malfoy suddenly stood to attention and strode back into his house. Harry double-checked the number on the door before resigning himself to following, since the door had been left wide open.
“Are you sorry? About…how I feel. Or are you just sorry that I’m not teaching you anymore?”
A twig on the ground broke behind him. Malfoy was stepping forward. Harry felt his back muscles tense up so much it was almost painful. He waited for the awful awkwardness in Malfoy’s voice.
“Harry?” he said, his voice faint, “Do you really need to be doing this here?”
Maybe Harry was mad, he thought. It would explain a lot of things.
“All the time,” said Malfoy. “Doesn’t that make you feel big and strong and pitying?”
Draco broke away to glower at the floor. “Jane flew away.”
“Oh,” said Harry, and tried not to sound too confused. Hayden got up, and took both their empty bowls back to the kitchen.
Scissoring is totally not a thing.
“No,” said Harry immediately.
“Didn’t know you liked girls then, Potter.” She sneers, draping herself back against the counter and taking a long sip of something red with a lemon slice.
Malfoy punched him with the water bottle.
Neither of them spoke of what had happened that night, but the next day Draco found a blanket made of fur that was not his, draped over his body, and Potter’s voice was no longer laced in acid when he spoke to him.
“Pelts, at a great price for the upcoming winter!”
“Calm down, Alfred.” The inn keeper said earning a wild look from the terrified man.
“I’m not used to being out in the wild.” Draco murmured, closing his eyes when a gust of cool wind blew through the trees.
“My name is Draco, “ He lowered his voice to almost a whisper as he continued,  “I was an initiate at the Church and Father—”
“It’ll be awhile until we reach another town like this one, are you sure you got everything you need?” Potter’s question came as they arrived at the cobblestone bridge that led out of the city.
“I’ve got everything.”
“It’s nice to know my capture is worth a measly 30 coins.” Draco said derisively, nose scrunching up.
“When the Church took me away from my home, I left behind a piece of my heart.” Draco said earnestly. “I don’t know if my parents are still alive, but I couldn’t stand another day without finding out.”
He felt Potter’s hands on his shoulders and saw his lips form around words he couldn’t hear. Strong arms held him as his entire world faded to black.
Draco’s eyes widened at the hushed conversation to his right. The two older men were sitting at a table near the wall, heads bent low. He heard Potter shift in his seat, no doubt having caught that snippet of conversation himself. They were sitting at the bar, the only other patrons beside the two older men and the inn keeper.
When the smoke cleared only dark ashes remained.
Just as his face began to redden once more, a strong hand pulled him along, disrupting his thoughts.
Through the door behind the bar was a set of stairs that led to a dark hallway with a few wooden doors. Draco followed Potter until they reached a surprisingly cozy room. It was heavily decorated with various paintings, tapestries, wooden carvings, and bronze figurines. A fireplace was situated on the opposite side of where Draco was standing, it was unlit, but had a neat stack of firewood at its base. He had not been in a place with one since he left the Church.
The owners of The Burrow weren’t what he’d imagined them to be. The couple exuded a warm and calming presence that counteracted with the raucous of the tavern’s clientele.
It was only after they’d had their share of food and water that they prepared to continue their travel.
“What
, Draco caught himself before saying that last word. He looked away when Potter’s eyes bore into his. Potter released his hold on him and walked ahead, Draco following quietly behind.
“How…” The man breathed out, turning confused eyes toward Draco.
There were four men left standing, all of them wielding weapons.
Another chilly current of wind passed through the woods, Draco closed his eyes again, and leaned his head back on the rough bark of the tree, hoping that he was tired enough to fall asleep quickly.
Draco shook his head, “No, I am not.”
life I never asked for. One where I was constantly watched and never had a moment of true peace.” Draco turned his glare toward Potter, jaw tensed with thinly veiled anger. The man really knew how to flare Draco’s temper.
“That should…” Draco trailed off, his eyes growing heavy. The pounding of his head deafening.
Draco jolted up; eyes frantic as he looked in every direction. The heavy thumping of his heart echoed in his ears, deafening.
Draco had stayed silent after that. It was obvious that whatever had happened that morning between Potter and the woman had put his new traveling companion in a foul mood. Perhaps, a lovers quarrel, Draco’s mind supplied.
“This man…if he were rounding up support by dark creatures the Church would have known, but I’d never…” Draco’s words died off at Potter’s short snort.
Draco shrugged his shoulders, offering the baffled man a small smile. The man’s expression was too amusing, and Draco couldn’t stop himself from reacting to it, even if he was still nervous. Half-truths would have to do for now, he didn’t want to risk turning Potter even more against him.
that?” Potter asked, chest heaving.
“Come with me, but be warned, one false move and I won’t hesitate to strike you down,
“I…I’m sorry about your parents.” The words came before Draco could think better of them. They fell flat amidst everything Potter had told him, the cruel tragedy of losing one’s parents so young. The thought made him ache for his own. He couldn’t quiet remember his mother’s smile, or her gentle fingers soothing over his hair. His father’s stern yet loving voice faded each year, his mind cinching around whatever precious memory he still had left. However, he still had the hope of seeing them one day, something Potter did not.
The tavern was nestled in between two long abandoned buildings, reached only through a dank, poorly lit alleyway. On the side of its chipping wooden door, hung an old sign that read, “The Burrow.” The tavern was owned by a seemingly unassuming middle-aged couple, the Weasley’s. They, along with their children, welcomed everyone into their tavern, but had no qualms in disposing of troublesome patrons. The tavern, with its faded walls and strong liquor, was frequented by low-class workmen, rogues, bandits, and, most importantly, by mercenaries. Groups of men and women gathered here in order to drink away their earnings, or to offer their services to those folk desperate enough to enter The Burrow.
A thousand things ran through Draco’s head, but all he could choke out was a faint, “Why?”
“So, you
They departed the following morning after receiving a few items in gratitude for what they had done. Draco watched as Potter shook hands with some of the villagers, a bright smile on his face. He wondered if this was how Potter had looked before he’d decided to change his course in life. A valiant mercenary heeding the call of people in need.
“It’s that man from the inn.” Draco whispered, taking a step back as Potter took one forward.
“You’re a
A hush fell over the crowd and many dispersed and returned to their homes. Draco followed Potter as he returned to the inn. Once inside, the inn keeper called them over.
“They refused to bow down to his whims. He went to my parents for support, an alliance of sorts, but they could see he was dangerous. He spoke of chaos and turmoil but bathed those words in honey to lessen the acidic taste.”
Draco stood as soon as the man walked back into the tavern, and nearly tripped over the hem his too-large cloak. His hands quickly went to his hood again, pulling it tight over his head as he swayed from nearly falling.
“…talked about it, Gin.”
“Are you balding? You do strike me as the vain type.” Potter grinned, and Draco fumed sending the man a vicious glare.
“No. I should have told you.” Draco said, slumping against a tree. He was feeling drained again. “Not only am I being persecuted by the Church for escaping, which already carries a hefty sentence, but I'm also a target for being Elven. Traveling with me
“Balding?! I’ll have you know I have excellent hair, which is more than I can say about that unruly mess of hair on your head.” Draco said, arms crossed tightly over his shoulders.
The first time Draco had used his magic in front of others his father had been furious. He’d snatched Draco up by the back of his collar and had dragged him away from the scene he’d created. Draco had watched the eyes of those that had surrounded him, some shone with gratitude and others with raw, unadulterated fear.
“Dragged away by what?” Draco nearly jumped when Potter’s voice rang out. He turned to find Potter rising from his seat next to him and going over to the men’s table.
“Winters in my hometown were harsh. The crops died and we are left to scavenge what we could in order to survive. Most of the animals left, and people with weak constitution didn’t make it through the season. Looters, most of which were dressed in Imperial uniforms, ransacked the smaller villages and left people with nothing. I never understood why they only did this during the winter. Now, I know. People are too weak to fight back when they are starving and freezing to death.” Draco was panting by the end, his hands trembling against his lap. He looked away from Potter’s somber expression, his chest heaving from the boiling anger under his skin. This anger was not geared towards Potter this time. It was for the blurry faces of those who came and took what they pleased. For those who took everything his parents had worked so hard to gain, not caring that they were slowly killing away everything they touched.
“I tried to stop it. I tried. It won’t let me. It won’t let me.” The gruff voice muttered, getting louder the closer the man got. Draco held his breath, trying to keep from bolting. Potter withdrew his sword, his stance changing into a defensive one.
“Yes, hiding in plain sight. I know he is going to try and take over the capital there, as well as the Church.” Draco couldn’t contain his gasp. Could one man hold that much power?
“…I have to…”
“I have been able to do this ever since I can remember. Because of this,” Draco flexed his fingers, “the Church took me from my home. That’s why…that’s why I will help you in any way I can in order for you to reach the Imperial City. I don’t have much, but I can also offer you a bit of gold. Just, please, allow me to accompany you.” Draco urged, desperate to reunite with his hometown, with his nearly-forgotten family.
“I’m sorry for…
The silence that fell between them was the longest Draco had ever experienced. His palms itched and his legs felt restless. The harsh thumping of his heart echoed inside his ears and his throat tightened.
“How did this happen?” Another asked, a small sleeping child clutched to her chest. When Potter looked lost for words, Draco spoke up.
“Fine. I’d be a fool to turn you away after learning of your
“Thank you.” Potter said before he laid down to sleep. Draco mirrored his movements and curled into himself.
With that they set off in the early morning sun toward the path that would lead them closer to Draco’s hometown.
Thank you for the initial support. <3
a priest?” Potter accused.
“What about
“By this time, I’m sure the Church is looking for you, and even if they suspect what your destination will be, they don’t know what route you’ll take. When rumor spreads that a priest came through here, most will say you were heading to a town near Northpass. Even if they catch on to the lie, they wouldn’t risk not checking that area as well, since it’s the shortest route toward the Imperial city. We, on the other hand, will travel west, it’s longer and a bit more dangerous, but we’ll at least get a head start.”
“So, I told you about my reasons for this journey, what are yours?” Potter asked after they’d covered a good bit of land.
“Watch.” Was all Draco said before he dropped the knife and held his other hand against his bleeding wound. His hand glowed a soft white. He closed his eyes and breathed in slowly through his nose when he felt the wound begin to close. It didn’t hurt, but he could feel his skin stretching and pinching together.
“Jewelry, precious stones, and hand-crafted ornaments for that special someone!”
Potter grunted his response and used his foot to tear Alfred away from his sword. The two men lunged at each other again, Potter getting another clean strike across one of Alfred's arms. The screeching that resulted from the injury had Draco shivering.
“A thrall.” Draco responded, eyes searching the area surrounding them.
“No, i-it’s not…”
Suddenly fierce brown eyes turned to look at him, and Draco quickly looked away. He was grateful his hood obscured the dark flush that creeped up his face. Draco occupied himself with re-examining the contents inside of his satchel until Potter was ready to leave.
“Maybe it’s not hungry tonight.” Draco said as they reached the edge of the village. A thin creek split the ground, the sound of running water calming his nerves. Past the creek he could see the dark outline of the forest that lay beyond.
“Fine, but first you need to eat. You look about ready to pass out again.”
?” The words were said with such disgust, Draco cringed, taking a small step back.
“Um, well from back at the last inn we stayed at. I had a peek while you were sleeping.” Potter’s voice was much lower, and Draco could swear he saw a dusting of red blush on the man’s bronze colored cheeks. Draco pondered this information for a moment. The only sounds coming from the birds and the soft breeze.
Draco looked around in amazement at all the makeshift stands surrounding the streets. Merchants of all ages were showcasing their products at the top of their voices, trying to gain the attention of all those who roamed the market. They’d finally made it to the next big city.
“What are you doing?” Potter asked as Draco took a small step back from him.
It was the sweet songs of birds that roused Draco from his sleep. He blinked up at the swaying tree branches above him, watching as the sunlight played with the shadows of the falling leaves. It was at that moment, that everything came back to him.
As Potter explained this, he began to peel off his armor. It occurred to Draco then that it was the first time he’d seen the other man without it on. Underneath the heavy looking armor, Potter’s body was big. The man had broad shoulders and a wide, muscular chest that was barely hidden by the cotton material of his undershirt. The mercenary’s appearance made Draco feel slightly inadequate. Inside of the Church, Draco had been kept under watchful supervision by the knights. He’d never been able to train or engage in any kind of physical combat. Draco had kept himself active in anyway he could, mostly by running errands for Father Severus or by tending to the large garden. He would spend hours watering and maintaining the plants and herbs used for poultices and potions.
Potter gave a humorless chuckle.
Draco stilled, dropping his eyes to the floor.
“I...I just don’t want people to recognize me that easily as the priest that escaped.” Draco was finally able to come up with a decent reply, another half-truth. Potter hummed.
“You. You talked…”
“Your capture, my
Draco stood awkwardly by the door frame as the man sat down in a wooden chair on the opposite side of the room, gaze sweeping over his form.
“That man is the one that gave me my scar. He did so on the night he killed my parents.”
After the silence dragged on, Potter spoke up again.
“I’ve killed plenty of man-eating beasts before, don’t worry.” Potter grinned. Draco wouldn’t believe Potter’s confidence if it weren’t for the man’s impressive build. Being ambushed in the dead of night was one thing but stalking and hunting down prey was something Draco wanted to see Potter do. If from far away.
This was who Draco was looking for. His description matched the one Father Severus had shown him. The priest had been sure this young man was Draco’s way out of the city. Draco had not had time to ask how he was sure this man would help him before the man had disappeared.
Draco took a deep breath and concentrated on a spell. He let the magic in the air flow through his core, the restless spirits heeding his call, and fire erupted from beneath Alfred’s feet. The man screamed, an inhuman noise that pierced the night sky.
“Are you gentlemen, looking for a bit of entertainment?” The woman smiled slyly, fluttering her long eyelashes. Draco’s face flushed upon realizing what the woman was offering. He took a step back, bumping into Potter’s side.
The group of men… of monsters, howled and jeered. Draco closed his eyes, ignoring the tears of anger that welled in his eyes, and willed the sounds around him to disappear. The words of the ancient language he’d fervently studied flowed through his mind. He connected his mind, his body, and his soul to the restless Spirits inhabiting the forest. He repeated the Old words, words that formed an intricate spell that seduced the Spirits and caused a sharp clap of thunder to rang out. The hands around him loosened as the man fell to the ground after being struck and Draco broke free, silently reciting the spells he had memorized. He targeted the surge of lightning coming from the tips of his fingers toward one of the men holding Potter down and watched as Potter leapt to his feet. Potter shoved the other man, landing a sold punch right at the man’s face, knocking him out.
They departed as the sun began its trek over the horizon. Potter mostly stayed silent for the first few hours of their journey. A journey they would make mostly on foot, since traveling by horseback attracted more attention. Draco had asked Potter how long he thought their journey would take. After consideration, Potter replied in a dry tone that he’d heard the trip by horseback was around a fortnight, so it would take them at least twice as long as that.
“Wonder how much gold they’ll withhold if I cut off your pretty pointy ears?”
“Stay close.” Potter ordered as they left the safety of the inn. Dark clouds moved through the dark blue sky, letting only a sliver of moonlight for illumination. The air was soft, causing the leaves of the trees to sway effortlessly. Aside from that, it was so very quiet. Suspiciously so.
“It’s not even that cold.” He heard the other mutter. Draco glanced over at him and watched as the man settled down against the trunk of a tree, still wearing his black plated armor. He wondered if the armor provided him with more coverage against the gusting winds. If it did, he was no one to talk about it not being that cold. Draco sat down on a softened patch of grass, curling his cloak around himself. He’d have to buy a different outfit at the text town they stopped at. His Church robes would more than likely just place a marker on his back for the Imperial knights.
They traveled until Potter found a spot he deemed safe enough to rest for the evening. Here the trees were thicker and closely condensed. It was nothing compared to a warm bed, but at least they weren’t out in the open. The roads leading to the city they left behind were a good distance away.
Draco was seated at the exact same spot in the tavern two days later. The atmosphere was much more subdued given the early hour in the morning. He sipped on the warm tea the Weasley matron had made for him when he arrived. When he’d tried to pay for it, the older woman had brushed it off.
“I’m sorry.” Draco sniffled out when his father took hold of his shoulders, wild eyes pinning Draco’s watery gaze.
“N-no, I’m not…it's a rather long story. If you would allow me one moment to explain…” Draco mumbled, he was quickly losing his nerve. Perhaps, he should look elsewhere for a solution to his predicament. The noisy atmosphere of the tavern grew in intensity, sending Draco on edge. The few eyes on them were a mix of curiosity and distrust.
“And, who the hell are you?” Draco flinched back at the gruff voice. The man’s eyes narrowed into slits. He took a step toward Draco, imposing and threatening. A few raucous laughs tore into the smoke-filled air. Draco felt his face heat, his own glare beginning to form. He stood his ground and tried not to let the nervous swarm in his stomach sway his voice.
“P-Probably… but you shouldn’t concern yourself with that. As soon as we reach that city, you won’t hear or see me again. Please, I promise no trouble will come out of it for you once we reach our destination.” Draco kept his head down, eyes squeezed shut. The silence dragged on and with it Draco’s hope of making it out of this wretched place.
“I’ll show you the reason why I was taken to the Church.” As he said this, Draco reached into his cloak and pulled out a small knife. Its hilt was a dark green and the double-edged blade was made of durable steel. It was the only weapon Draco carried with him. Potter threw him a look that easily read “you-better-remember-what-I-said.”
“Now the only one who is not officially queer is Harry,” Draco announced, after he’d had his second glass. He said this casually, like it was a common truth.
since Hogwarts.”
“Don’t get too comfortable straight boy,” said Malfoy, smirking, “She’s not about that life.”
“Don’t feel bad about it,” she said, “Just keep coming to the classes. And maybe get some leggings. That’s what helped Draco.”
Harry was looking at him in the bathroom mirror. Draco could feel the heat of his blood.
Draco remembered everything. He was going to remember everything for the rest of his life. And it was important now that he clarify the difference between being respectful and kind to Harry, because he
Once, afterwards, Harry even asks: “When did you know you liked girls?” They’re on the bed breathing heavily, Malfoy on her back, Harry on her side, glancing down at her. She’s acutely aware of the curves of her own body – acutely aware of being a woman, of being desired by another woman – she can’t stop tracing that curve, that dip between her hips and ribs.
“You passed out,” Malfoy wheezed, clutching his knee. “You fucking passed
“When did you come here?” Harry asked, distracted, and Tom raised the brow just a little higher.
As Harry thought back on it more, he realised that Draco had often looked that way. It seemed obvious now he had the word. Why hadn’t he realised it before?
“It,” he said. “I…it was different.”
“Me too,” said Harry, feeling a little stupid. “I was looking for a mat, actually.”
“Thanks for that.” Harry said it to his untouched tumbler, sitting on the coffee table. It looked unmovable. “Why’d you like me, then?”
“Sick,” Ron had said, “But like, also, not sick. Fourth year was enough dragons for me.”
Harry stared. He didn’t want to just – stare, but that’s what he did.
“Are you alright?” he asked.
“Did you say something?” he asked lightly. Draco slapped his thigh, but it wasn’t very hard and he was exhaling a little shakily. Harry wished he could see his face.
“Is that a real pole?” asked Harry.
Harry was kissing him. Draco’s head fell back, his hand slowing. They’d never kissed before; the heat, the sweet closeness of it was entirely new.
“Because,” said Harry. “We’re going for a flight.”
“You are,” said Oceania, gripping his arm. “Don’t let these big bad boys tell you otherwise.”
He had liked it.
“It’s just Harry,” said Harry. “And who?”
“I know.” The words were light.
“Daphne du Maurier.” Draco pulls out
Malfoy was looking at him looking.
Harry felt himself flush. A quick glance at Draco assured that he was also a) flushed, and b) refusing to look in Harry’s direction.
“Right, Hi.” Harry checked his watch. “Malfoy, are you going to be ready soon?”
Harry realised he had put the butter in upside down. He quickly righted it.
“Are you,” Harry had to catch his breath. He felt like it’d been punched out of him. The ache in his eyes was long forgotten. “Are you seriously judging me right now?”
Luna kept looking at him. “You know,” she said, after a moment. “I still think you could really like Pansy and Blaise. You didn’t get a good impression of her, I think, the other night.”
“Ah,” said Oceania, and nodded again. Then she looked at him, and leaned in a little. “And why does that make you a liar?”
Malfoy laughed unnecessarily.
“Here,” Hayden was passing him a bottle. “It’s not firewhisky, but it’s still good.”
And then he was unravelling. His mind was floating, somewhere above him, maybe. He was understanding now, that there were layers to himself. If he turned the loud part off, he found something tender and honest and deeply profound. It was intimate. He felt so close to himself.
Oceania pulled out a muscle tank. She held it out to Harry like a peace offering.
It was still sunny. He dodged into the tree line, following no path, his heavy feet trampling the grass. It got darker quickly. The trees around him thickened, long lines of ink being pulled out of the ground.
“You work for Vise.”
“Honey. I always bring the dip,” said Oceania, and leaned over to kiss her on the cheek. Luna looked faintly pleased, although whether this was a result of the prospective dip or the display of affection was unclear.
“Oh, for the love of –” Malfoy had turned back around and was staring at the pair of them hopelessly. “Really, Potter, you couldn’t take some responsibility?”
– then stepped past him, going to hang the jacket on the coat rack by the door.
Was it possible to be brilliant at painting and absolute shit at knitting? Harry blinked one more time at the elephant leg/dolphin/oil spill/tarmac tree trunk and vowed to never, ever tell Oceania this.
“You said she was good,” Harry offered, because he was still curious about the peculiar tenderness between the two of them.
“On the bookshelf.”
“Merlin,” said Malfoy, appearing at the bald man’s left. He had to squeeze past the shoulder pads. “You’re early.”
“Jesus god,” said Harry.
“Harry, I don’t think that you can’t think for yourself.”
Harry opened his mouth, but found all his protests wanting. He closed it, blinking, and then inhaled and relaxed his shoulders. Malfoy was pretending to fiddle with the lid of lipstick, but was watching closely.
Maybe it was the new place. He got dressed and went outside, stood on the plane that overlooked the cafeteria and the mountain-tops and the dragons. The air was cold and blue, biting at his cheeks, pulling at his clothes. He didn’t want to go back inside.
Well. He was done with the past, was what he was.
“So you
Harry shrugged, a little defensive. “What’s wrong with that?”
Draco is silent for a long moment, and Harry starts to turn around when Draco pushes her away and stands up, tossing the apple core in the bin. Harry watches her get dressed properly.
Harry felt himself blush hard again, right from the root of his spine. “Oh.”
“No,” said Harry. Then just in case it wasn’t clear – “We needed to discuss the video footage.”
His thin brows were almost invisible in the lighting. Harry blinked up at him, waiting.
“I didn’t know you were fucking other people.” is all she says.
Delia’s eyes widened.
Hayden raised the other brow, and then set them both down. Presumably, all that brow-lifting caused headaches after a while.
it said.
“Where’s Oceania anyway?” Harry asked. She had been suspiciously absent all day. He had saved her one of the cookies.
This just seemed like a regular nightclub. Not that Harry had been to many of those, either.
“God,” he said, “God, this is awful.”
“So,” said Harry, as they trailed after Oceania and her hair. “Oceania’s got her persimmons, you’ve got your blue cheese…what’s Draco’s religion?”
“You didn’t think I was asking you because I liked you.”
“Right,” said Draco. He balled his hands into fists.
“You can always talk to the others about it,” she said, once he’d gotten control of his breathing again. “They’ll all be really nice about it. Especially Draco.”
“Hey,” said Harry, a bit breathless from surprise. Hayden raised a brow at him and reached past him to grab a pair of chopsticks. Malfoy frowned.
All of a sudden, Harry couldn’t stand it. He sat up. The room was spinning. He grasped the mattress, gasping. Were the walls concaving?
He walked directly over to Harry after seeing him walk in. He was fascinated by the fact that there was a large snake curled around his figure and Harry was acting like it was the most normal thing in the world. Putting that aside for the moment however, he held his hand out and hoped for the best.
Although he was confused as to how she knew about his tattoo he happily obliged, accidentally conjuring a couch for her to sit on while he was looking for a place to put her down. She looked a bit startled but not very surprised which was odd because not many wizards could wandlessly and wordlessly conjure even the smallest of objects. He sat across from her on his bed and began to roll his sleeve up, still awestruck by the intricate colors and patterns of the design on his arm that hadn't been there mere minutes ago.
Jared had joined the Ravenclaw team in his third year but he hadn't been promoted to seeker until this year when Cho quit. Harry had previously been excited to play against a new seeker, they had pretty much stayed the same all throughout his Hogwarts career but after this morning's fiasco, he was more anxious to just utterly embarass him in his first game.
"Oh! Yes of course sorry professor i was talking to Sidereum, yes, that sounds right I think that will be his name" his smile was so genuine it made Minerva's heart ache a little, she hadn't seen him happy in so long.
"What do you reckon you'll do 'Mione, after you get your NEWT's, I think I'm still going to be an auror."
"Petunia! That retched boy has snuck a snake into this house!" Vernon had started screaming once again and although it rattled Harry, he felt oddly comforted by the snake that had coiled itself all around his figure surprisingly quickly. He had read up on this snake when the trio was in the library after they had figured out that the voices Harry was hearing was hissing from the pipes. He didn't remember much but he knew they could grow up to 10 meters and this one had hatched at about 3 meters long which was impressive even for this breed. He also remembered that it was very rare and super venomous but he couldn't recall any specifics.
"WAIT! You have a mental bond with him? Harry this is crazy hold on give me one second I have to write all of this down, this means you must have a First Degree bond, oh I must get pictures of your tattoo Harry. I wonder if you can-"
"That's quite enough Harry I don't need to know about your fantasies I just need you to come to class with me."
"Calm down Harry I have as much time as you need to answer your questions, for starters, a third Degree bond with a familiar is represented by a non-moving black tattoo that stays around the area of your wrist, the specific bond is quite common and while they don't share a mental bond, it does boost the magic of the wizard a little. A Second Degree bond is what Voldemort and Nagini had, it is signified by a black non-moving elbow length tattoo, they can speak telepathically and the bond exponentially increases their capacity for magic, those are less common but tend to be quite predictable. First Degree bonds however are exceedingly rare and often differ in what effects they may have on the wizard and animal, their tattoos are arm length very colourful and they tend to appear as if they are moving. Yours appears to be a particularly strong one Harry. While we do not know the full effects this may have on you I can say for sure that you share a full mental bond with Sidereum here and you can not only communicate telepathically but you both have complete access to the other's mind."
"PARTY TIME BITCHES!" Blaise was running down the stands screaming, it had been quite a long time since they had won a match by that much and he was always looking for an excuse to throw a party, this just seemed like a good reason.
Harry, Hermione and Ron went to lunch and he decided to let them in on his plan while they were eating.
"The only thing I can't figure out is why he's indigo, I thought they were normally black" Harry had consulted as many books as he could, he even asked Sidereum about it but he hadn't managed to find an answer. He had hoped it was in one of his past memories which Sidereum could view and see exactly what it was Harry had read which had made harry ecstatic because he would never have to fail tests again, but there were still no answers to be found.
Harry looked down disappointed, he would have wished to see her dance again, maybe even watch Daniel’s performance.
Harry started to walk down the hall. The blond boy looked around conflicted before walking after the other. When they entered the senior room Malfoy analysed the space before stepping back. “Where not allowed down here.”
mother had passed.
It would have been a weird site for an outsider. Had any other boy come across the site and they would have become utterly perplexed. Either way this scene wasn’t new to Draco such as it wasn’t new to Potter either.
“You bet! Came from Ireland. First time in London actually.”
Harry was sick of this problem. Absolutely sick of it. As he swallowed and the violins inside him got louder and angrier.
It had been a right shock to turn around and find his Father evil eyeing him in the middle of class. Harry paused and stood still. He felt his fathers hard eyes hit him as he stopped dancing. Surprisingly Luna continued.
None of the girls even glanced at him a second time when he came out after their warm ups. Mrs Weasley didn’t even smile at him. She just handed him the shoes and talked to the piano man about music.
Draco coughed from across the room. Seamus seemed to turn red and giggle before composing himself. Snape looked unimpressed as he replied. “Yes. I am aware.”
Dean turned to him. “I reckon we’ll be starting to prepare for the end of year recital soon.”
“Yes you do. You can join in today if you want.”
had something to prove.
Sometimes boxing and Ballet run during the same hours. Harry doesn’t care about the looks the other boys give him, in fact he’s quite glad about it in that they only look. They don’t have an excuse to punch him anymore. He's long since left the secret of his dance behind. Moody stares too. Harry reckons he wanted him to be a fighter. He thinks that’s only because of the scar though. His hair is longer now. He can hardly notice it in the mirror.
Originally written August 2020
She pulled him into a tight hug before letting him go. “Go on Harry, it’s nearly time.”
“Like what?”
“Maybe I
When the music stopped Harry almost smiled.
He quickly pulled them out. “There right here!”
They tilt their heads. The words fall out into the stream of the air and Harry can't work them up. “—It’s like —like there's so much energy inside me that it needs to be let out. It travels through my nerves and I just need to move you know? I guess that’s what it’s like. Like I'm a puppet and music is stringing me along. Or like the world is on fire.”
He stretched next to her in practice. She was mumbling something to herself when he spoke. “Why do you try so hard?”
Harry faintly remembered little conversation, he mainly remembered his worry and anger. “Is that the reason?”
Harry's first year. A new mentor, a new challenge. How will he face his the rest of his year when forced to partner up with his new rival?
“Ginny’s.”
” He sneers.
“Mum reckons the moment I turned thirteen I shot up a foot.”
Draco could feel his heart race and decidedly forced himself to ignore it. He berated himself for his thoughts and sat upon the stairs glumly, feeling the slight shiver of the cold.
Snape nodded in approval. “Yes Mr Malfoy, very good. As males we are to provide the bravado to a performance and show off our strength. The females work on elegance, posture, flight and what have you. Of course dance can be done by anyone but the ballet is here to show off your strengths. Seamus Again!”
Amos fumed. “You're not going.”
Harry didn’t know if he could imagine himself being like that. Harry wasn't breathtaking, He was just...
Draco thought about this. “I guess the only people I'd count as cousins aren’t… the best kind of people.”
He stomped into the locker room. A familiar anger seethed into him aimed at no one but himself. He groaned. He
Amos slaps his shoulder.
“Every Sunday then, be back here to practise.”
Potter seemed annoyed at the subtle insult but seemed intrigued.
“Not all songs are about that.”
Potter seemed to chuckle. “You should have seen my dad’s reaction when he found out I did Ballet. You would have thought I killed his eldest… yeah that was not fun.”
"Her Ballet classes you arse."
Harry let’s slip a smile. Ginny twirls her hair.
Draco huffed from beside him and Harry took their small break to gaze at himself within the opposing mirror. Harry had to admit his own appearance almost shocked himself. Cedric had wrestled Harry to the floor the moment he’d gotten home demanding he get his hair out of his eyes, which had then led to all his hair being buzzed off.
Harry brings Ron to the boxing hall. They turn the lights on and hope no one notices. They can faintly hear chatter from the downstairs soup kitchen. Drunk miners singing and laughing. Harry wonders if his Dad is down there.
Draco coughed and heaved before forcing a snort away. “I—
Malfoy rubbed his eyes but seemed to calm. “Tempo, timing. Snape will have us preparing our arm strength soon. Dean can leap better than all of us, Seamus has been trying to lift Lavender behind everyone's back and I think he's almost there,
“I’m like your only friend.”
“Fifth, this’ll be my last year at White lodge.
Draco knew it was cliché but coming back to school felt oddly like returning home. He stood in front of that main entrance and felt something he’d never had before. It was warm and loud and almost felt like poetry thrumming inside his skull. Millions of sweet adjectives and literary words flowed through him like a sunbeam and for a moment— he let himself close his eyes, look up and bathe in the warmth of this particular movement within his chest. He let his right hand reach up and clutch at the fabric above his heart and for that moment Draco was at peace. The water was still and the clouds unmoving.
Dean seemed to notice their staring contest and laughed. “Wicked scar right? He won’t tell us how he got it, we're taking bets.”
Draco let his voice raise. “No you mustn't! Everything's fine Father
Draco. That what you say is true.” He drawled menacingly.
Like most schools this one started out it’s year with a mostly boring assembly. Harry had managed to find a seat next to Seamus and his friend. Fortunately—
He waited for a moment but the other boy didn’t reply, so instead he turned and kept his eyes on the roundabout. He sat glumly and started to sway slowly to a tune he couldn’t hear.
“Me too kid.”
She shrugged. “If it’s a fox hole it would have been empty beside pups anyway. They hunt at night.”
afraid of what others will think though. He's always afraid of something.
Draco took his father's silence and prepared himself for the question he wanted to ask. “Why is Mother out of bed?”
“Class dismissed.”
Harry's eyebrows scrunched in confusion. He’d read through all the pamphlets so he wasn’t sure who he could miss such a...
Harry snapped his eyes open and shook his head. He pushed down the thoughts he was sure were wrong though he couldn't find a reason why.
“You know a bunch of boys do ballet.”
“It’s not his fault.”
Harry glared at Amos as he rubbed his temple and didn’t speak a word.
Dean’s expression seemed to drop at the mention of the girls. It was a weird sight that happened almost everyday and despite Harry’s knack for watching he found it difficult to draw any conclusions about what he saw. This being Dean's disappointment at the word
Two boys danced together that year, just as they had once before, just as they had in a new way. One danced for a passion, and a person to forget. One danced for the music, and a tune he couldn’t get out of his head. They danced together and green never left grey as they formed the steps that would form future words they couldn't speak yet.
The blonde dickhead looked concerned. “Are you okay? It’s just an audition.”
The blond boy looked him up and down before shrugging in turn. "You're not very punctual are you Harry? I guess lets just hope you dance better than you speak."
Over time Harry had learned a few things during Ballet class. He’d learned first to fifth position and was quite proud at how fast he’d gotten them. He was still behind the girls though. He knew that. He remembered Ginny mentioning that Dancers had to start young. He wondered if he started too late. Half the girls could already spin and come back to the same spot.
Harry studied the maps of Roehampton and Richmond Park he’d been given thoroughly... or as best as he could force himself to stare at a page for so long. Never in his life had he travelled so far along and so alone. He'd come to find the bus didn’t go into the park and he’d have to walk quite a trek to get to White lodge so he tried to familiarise himself with the landscape.
"Harry! You really must hurry up we're going to be late for Transfiguration again, Mcgonagall will give you detention if you show up late."
"You're going downstairs like that? I always knew you were a slob Potter but this is a new level of sloppiness even for you."
"I think we missed the trolley witch, I'm going to go see if I can find her." Ron looked a bit confused but Hermione gave him an understanding nod. He had decided to just walk through the compartments for a bit to cool down because he really didn't have anywhere he could really go. It was pretty uneventful and people mostly left him alone but the stares were still awful so he decided to really go looking for the trolley witch. He found her pretty quickly and he got some pumpkin pasties and Bertie Botts every flavor beans. He got back to his compartment to find Ron and Lavender deep in a conversation he wish he could unhear and Hermione was reading a book looking very uncomfortable by the window.
Turns out, Harry can't even seem to have dinner without causing a scene. This one however was quite welcome to him.
"There are WHAT? You mean to tell me that I have been desperately trying to burn all of these things into my mind permanently since First year and there was a spell I could use to help?!" Draco looked positively livid that he had been deprived of this for so many years.
"To you, it's Potter. As well as anyone else who judges another person based on past actions they were not only forced into under duress and obviously regret." Draco was so confused as to why Harry was defending him and Jared looked completely shattered, like his confidence had never be there in the first place. "I probably would have done the same thing for my family if they weren't all dead." While Draco was a bit uncomfortable with how casually he mentioned his entire family being dead like it was the most normal thing in the world, he also felt like someone finally understood what he went through and how hard it was.
"Thank you Harry, you seem to be doing alright now and I'm afraid I must get back to the school to finish preparations for the year but I hope to see you soon." She set some protective spells around his room and apparated back to Hogwarts.
"Alright lads, I think it's Blaise's turn to give the pep talk" Harry said adding a dramatic sigh at the end.
Headmaster Mcgonagall apparated directly into the Dursley home which startled Vernon out of his original ranting. However it did not take long for him to start yelling at the strange new wizard. Minerva walked right past him up to Harry's bedroom anyway, worried for Harry's life because there had been a magical explosion that originated from his house. Mcgonagall had feared the worst, that a new dark wizard had replaced Voldemort's power vacuum or that he had come back from the dead again to finish him off. She did not however expect to discover the only First Degree familiar bond in the last 800 years.
"Merlin 'Mione, let the man breathe for a minute he's obviously exhausted." This infuriated Hermione even more than before and she turned to Ron and started yelling at him. Harry had nearly gotten to the dormitory hallway but they caught him before he could.
Harry gave a nod to Draco and thanked them both right as both Ginny and Ron came up beside them. Ron sneered at Draco decided to leave it be for now.
*****
Lavender cut through his thoughts like a knife "we've been here for some time and" yup, her voice still unsettled him relentlessly "it seems we've finished with our food, what do you say we get to shopping?" A chorus of yeses erupted from the table so they left a hefty sum of money and left the shop.
Soon conversation began to shift to Hermione and Ron. Harry knew that they had decided that they didn't want to date after the war but he had no idea just how much they had moved on from each other. Lavender had matured a surprising amount and she was no longer disgustingly clingy, she had decided to work as a robe designer and she was going to apprentice at Madam Malkin's during her last year at Hogwarts. Ron had asked her out on a whim when he saw her over summer break and grew to love the new person she was. Harry was not surprised by Hermione's new found fondness of Fred. She had never been very in love with Ron because he was a bit dull for her but Fred had always been clever and unpredictable and exciting. They had started dating a couple of weeks ago but Hermione was blown away by his spontaneousness.
Sorry I haven't gotten the third chapter up yet, its been a rough week and we have to put my dog down soon so i'm a bit distracted. I promise I am working on it but it's probably going to be another day or two. Im so super sorry and I really hope you guys still want to read this.
Harry hadn't realized just how long he had been wandering until Hermione's patronus came and found him. Startled at the thought of how furious Mcgonagall would be if he was out this late the first night of school, he vanished the muggle radio with a wave of his hand and was about to run up to the castle when he had the thought that he should at least try to sell the illusion that he needed a wand. He picked up a broad branch that we could whittle into a wand and called out to Sidereum.
Something in Harry didn't feel quite as alone anymore, he felt safe and he thought that even though so many things had gone wrong, this one could go right for him.
"Whatever Harry, have fun with your revenge, but I don't want to be involve this time I'm just going to take notes or something." Ron, take notes?! Probably not, he'll probably just fall asleep three minutes in.
"I don't know why you're helping me but thank you. Also uh, I don't know my schedule, do you know where I could find that?"
"What a beautiful feint Potter, you had Jared barreling into the ground face first, he hadn't even managed to get back on his broom by the time you caught the snitch." Draco had an arrogance in his tone but his eyes showed thankfulness to Harry for embarrassing the backstabbing prick much more than necessary.
Harry had missed it but he was so distracted in that moment to notice the look Malfoy had on his face when he heard Harry was in his house. No one could be sure but it looked like hope, which was a very good look on him. Harry was not however too distracted to notice the hexes that flew at him when Sidereum had reared up and he was very grateful for the protective charms he had cast beforehand. He strutted over to the Slytherin table with the biggest grin on his face and feeling like he was finally where he was supposed to be the whole time. He sat down next to Malfoy, not really knowing of anyone else who wouldn't hex him on sight and shot an apologetic look at Ron and Hermione. They seemed a bit dissappointed they wouldn't be in the same house anymore but they also looked happy for Harry.
Draco woke up and got changed not bothering to look at who the rest of his roommates after he spotted Jared. Jared had been one of the people who had hated Draco from the very beginning. Even before he was a death eater, Jared would bully and hex him on sight and with how often he got out of it, Draco was personally surprised he wasn't in Slytherin. He took his time in the shower and spent a good hour on his hair. He was about to head down to breakfast when he spotted Potter. 'What in the bloody hell is Potter doing in my room'. He didn't think he had said anything but apparently he had because Potter had responded,
"Yes, Harry" he liked it when she called him Harry, it made him feel like just a normal person. "Of course I can explain this all to you, but first, I will need some help up and for you to show me the tattoo i'm sure you've already noticed"
No Potter was many things but he was NOT cute no his embarrassment was merely entertaining.
A couple questions for you guys.
"Now who's the flustered one?"
But why would she be doing that?
"All the eighth years are automatically invited! Invite whoever you bloody well like as long as none of them kill my buzz." Everyone had heard of how amazing Blaise's parties were but no one outside of Slytherin had been invited until now, inter-house unity or something like that I guess.
Harry loved that about the twins, either of them could take the most ridiculous or upsetting situation and make jokes about it. It helped a lot with everyone's recovery after the war. He wasn't sure where to begin, the surge of magic collapsing back in on him, maybe how Sidereum acted a lot like Draco. Draco, he thought about him a lot and it frustrated him to no end. Pushing all thoughts of Draco back into a box and burying it somewhere inside his mind he decided to start with the tattoo because everyone seemed to be so fascinated by it. He had worn a short sleeved muggle shirt under his robes for this exact reason. His friends were so predictable with what fascinated them. He chuckled to himself and shrugged off his robes to reveal the tattoo, still as vibrant and full of life as it had been when it first appeared. After a few very long seconds and some audible gasps from his friends and people watching near them, Harry put his robes back on and explained what the different tattoo's signified. Hermione already knew all of this of course but she pretended to be fascinated for the sake of the others.
He went to get back to surveillance height when he spotted it, he saw the actual snitch. He darted after it and started to do intricate twists and turns to keep Jared from following him just in case he had recovered from his face-five with the ground. After a couple of minutes, he managed to snatch it out of the air but not before Ginny had scored several more goals with the help of their teammates.
"Yes Potter?"
He immediately started scribbling down the events of what happened out of order but very detailed and at one point he said something about it being 'unsettlingly slytherin of him' and Sidereum interjected evidently upset.
Harry returned to the common room positively beaming, while he recounted exactly what happened to his two best mates.
"Well, now that spot of trouble has been fixed I can try my best to explain this situation to you."  She just sat for a moment and Harry could see the wheels spinning in her brain trying to figure out where to begin. "First I must ask you Harry, if you know what a familiar bond is?"
"OH!, oh yes of course he must have been talking about you, your the one who's going to explain this I reckon." Harry was talking very fast while his face flushed at the rather obvious conclusion he had just come to.
"I am NOT in love with him Ron I am just uh... I don't know what but I'm not in love with him no I couldn't be."
"I have successfully raided the candy supply off of the trolley! Who wants some? I got way more than I need."
There was a deafening pop right as he was about to fall asleep and Harry dropped the book on his own face. "Ow!" he started rubbing his forehead a little too vigorously and it left a red mark. He got up from his bed after adequate over exaggerated huffing and stumbled backwards when he was greeted by a rather large midnight blue egg hissing at him. He panicked and scrambled back into the re-barred window hitting his head for the second time which made him very frustrated.
It was a very nice day in Diagon Alley, there were only a couple clouds and the sky was bright with the suns rays that seemed to slash through the atmosphere of mourning everyone seemed so adamant in upholding. The only thing out of the ordinary was Harry Potter walking through Wizarding London with a frighteningly large Venenata snake.
"Draco you do know that there are recollection spells you can use right?" There was concern on his face as well as a bit of awe that Draco had managed to remember every incantation and wand movement up until now without any help from memory spells.
"Regardless I'm not having a fellow Slytherin wearing that to the Great Hall, I'll get you your coffee and something to eat but I insist you shower and change before classes." Harry was very surprised at Malfoy's willingness to help him but he also didn't want to deal with all the stares and Hermione and Ron's concerned faces when he turned up to breakfast with bags under his eyes.
"I swear mate, you know your never going to eat that much candy but you get it anyway, you've done it since first year!" Ron laughed at how clueless Harry was even to his own appetite.
"Yeah, right well just don't get too drunk. Nothing good ever happens when you're that drunk." Ron said with a smirk.
This didn't have to be Draco's problem after all, he did find it a bit odd that Granger's patronus was an otter of all things though. Draco accio-ed his broom after trying to walk and remembering just how much he had walked in the last hour and flew back up to his dormitory. Pansy started questioning him the moment he walked through the portrait hole and he settled on just telling her that he had seen Granger and Weasley looking and figured they would find him faster. He announced that he was tired and going to head to bed to avoid the rest of the questions he knew Pansy would have. Having no where else he could really disappear he settled for actually looking for his luggage with was supposed to be outside of his room. It took a while to find because it was pretty high up in the dorms but he was happy, it meant that he could look down on the grounds if he ever wanted to, which he did pretty frequently. It looked like he would be rooming with a Ravenclaw a Hufflepuff and another Slytherin, he wasn't sure who though because he didn't recognize the luggage. He changed into his emerald green silk pajamas and hopped into his bed, he fell asleep pretty quickly nestled under his silver and green covers.
"Where were you that you had to run so fast to get here? Bloody hell Harry get your snake under control before I hex it into next week! We were worried sick, you can't just up and get sorted out of our house and then disappear for FOUR HOURS you git!" Even Ron looked a bit frightened of Hermione at this point, it was one thing to yell at Harry but a highly venomous snake that could kill you in ten seconds flat? That was a new level of brave and it startled everyone in the common room.
He immediately felt bad for Potter and told him to just shower and get dressed or something like that. He had been panicking most of the conversation at the fact that he was going to be living in the same room and bloody Harry Potter for the rest of the year. It did however have one benefit, the two were taking the same classes and if since Draco managed to convince Harry to walk with him to classes, he wouldn't be so constantly hexed in the hallways for his part in the war. He was extremely grateful for his planning ahead when he realized just
"Sidereum" he corrected.
told him that he shrieks which in itself was embarassing. After that Harry had said he was going to go to breakfast and in his panic he had said something about Potter being a slob but rather than retaliating with a bitter remark like he thought Harry would, but instead he just said something about nobody caring and he just sounded so
"Harry? have you picked out a name? You have been sitting there quietly for some time." Minerva was a bit concerned but hid it well.
Malfoy leaned back, eyebrows pushing into a fold. When Malfoy was uncertain, his eyebrows formed a crease that was more a dot than a line.
Delia turned her head to face him in the manner of a possessed doll. “But Harry,” she said, “the article is finished.”
“Trust you to get hung up that part,” said Malfoy, right as Benjamin said, “And just like that, the evening is sorted.”
said Hermione again. Harry laughed.
“Did you like exercising back in Scotland?” asked Oceania as they walked. Harry blinked, the sun catching in his eye.
It had been so long since he’d been on his own around other people. There were so many other people. The city centre was a vast, vivid, interweaving thing. He couldn’t stop looking at all these strangers, all busy on their own strands of existence.
“Have you actually read all of these?” Harry asked, as he half sat down on a worn copy of “Lady Chatterly’s Lover” and also a copy of “Knitting a Scarf in A Day for Dummies”. His tea wobbled precariously in his cup.
“She’s good.”
“Because it matters,” said Draco and then pressed his lips together tightly. He didn’t know why he did this. He didn’t know why he did –
“That’s okay,” said Oceania, but she’d stopped trying to hide the smirk. Harry rolled his eyes.
“I suppose so,” agreed Harry, grinning. “Are you going to braid my hair for me?”
“Hmm?”
“Fuck,” moans Malfoy, and Harry reaches down, hooking her knees around her shoulders.
did you know? What tipped you off? What did it feel like?”
“Oh, hello Harry,” said Oceania, “How was it?”
Harry cleared his throat. “You’re with your dragon,” he said intelligently.
“There’ll be good days and bad days.” Malfoy reached out to stroke Jane and she flinched back. He pursed his lips. “You can’t let it get to you.”
“You’re awful,” says Harry, laughter still caught in the back of his throat, and spontaneously wraps an arm around Draco’s waist and a hand around the nape of his neck and pulls him in for a hearty snog. Draco makes a startled sound, and grips onto Harry’s shoulders. He’s just really getting quite into it when Harry suddenly breaks away and drops him into a dip. Draco gives a shout of alarm, and then Harry’s laughing face is so close to him, appearing out of the velvet darkness and the stars, and his arms are so strong around his waist.
They went into plank and chaturanged down. Up into upward dog – his shoulders back, opening his heart to the sun – and then back, downward dog and then one leg up, high, high as it would reach, before bending it and bringing it forward between his hands. They pushed back and forth and
Harry was the realest thing.
Malfoy quoted extravagantly, and Harry looked over at him.
She was watching him. He was waiting for – he wasn’t sure what for. For her to breathe fire onto him. For her to suddenly stand up and claw him. For her to snap her long sharp teeth in his direction. He was sitting in front of her, and he was completely vulnerable.
The indent was mostly gone, but there was still something tense about his posture, clearly fighting just beneath the skin. Harry let him battle it out a little longer, and then rubbed his thumb across his knuckles again. Malfoy’s lips touched each other faintly, and the indent disappeared completely.
Harry glanced down at his suitcase. “Think so. I’ve probably forgotten something though. You know me.”
“It’s not my fault he kind of looks like a girl,” he muttered irritably, and then froze, worried he’d broken some kind of universal gay law and had been horribly offensive, but Oceania just started giggling.
Malfoy was there, and he was frowning, looking at Harry as though he’d never seen him from this angle before. Cautious, and intensely curious. Harry inhaled and exhaled, and then he slumped forward. Malfoy caught him just in time. They were crumpled on the kitchen floor.
Harry dropped the camera bag. He swore and bent down to pick it up. He didn’t need to look up to tell that Malfoy was thrilled to finally get a rise out of him.
He cleared his throat and gave it a heartfelt stab. “So. Why don’t you tell me about your routine?”
“You should. Just because he’s not there doesn’t mean you’re not family.”
Harry winced, but his tone was light. “Fine. Fit. Dementor-ready.”
“Did you?”
“Maybe not to you,” snapped Harry.
in that way, would feel good. But the truth of it was that, in a very real way, it was incredibly uncomfortable. He felt as if his skin was crawling. He couldn’t understand it.
Harry rolled his eyes. There was simply no way to hold a normal conversation with Malfoy.
“Like quiet indignation,” says Potter.
“I like it,” said Malfoy.
Harry blinked. “The green one.”
Harry’s mouth tasted gross. He found a small bathroom filled with paint supplies and ceramic sea animals, and rinsed it, getting the worse of the taste out. He splashed his face, and glanced at the bags under his eyes in the mirror. Then glanced again. He couldn’t tell if he looked different from a few months ago, or if he was just tired.
“Are you ever going to tell me properly about it?”
Harry stiffened.
“Osh.” Malfoy was sliding off the bed. Harry chanced a glance over. He looked – well, not
“Just like that,” Harry said, “Suck it just like that. You’re such a good boy, so good showing Daddy how well you suck it.”
It was Draco Malfoy.
“You believed me.” Looking at Malfoy now, with gleeful mirth practically glittering from his skin, he looked at lot more like he had at school. “You actually think I wear a little pink dress.”
“What?” says Harry.
“Is that what you meant when you said you were…queer?” Harry asked, somewhat timidly.
Luna grinned. “I like the way you speak,” she allowed. “But it’s mostly because you’re very attractive.”
“M…Motter. No. Po…Palfoy. Polfoy. Polf.”
“I hate you to my very core,” said Oceania, and rolled over to the fruits and vegetables. As she passed, Hayden winked emotionlessly at Harry.
“Fancy seeing a huge untamed dragon in the sky!” Draco interjected.
“I thought…” he began slowly, clearly mulling things over. “I thought that would be something you’d like. I clean up nice, you know.”
Harry is suddenly reaching over him, and returns with his arms full of Doritos.
“Sure,” said the shopkeeper. “Long as you buy something.”
at first.”
“Very nice,” he drawled.
“I don’t know, actually.” Malfoy’s voice was mild.
“Well, then,” said Draco, and he sounded amused. There a pause that stretched out. Harry couldn’t believe how awkward this was.
When the shots arrived, they all clinked glasses before downing it, except for Oceania, who poured hers into the milkshake hybrid and began to sip casually, ignoring the raised brows of the girl behind the counter.
Draco sounded genuinely confused. “You don’t?” he asked. “What else would it be?”
“You have to know that the dances are not just describing the story of Buddhism being introduced to Tibet,” he had said immediately before it started. “But are also depicting the personal awakening of the individual.”
let it just be said that I never anticipated that bowling would become such a present part of this story.
“I’m not good at…teaching.”
It’s only later when it seems to dawn on Harry that shopping in another country is not as simple a task as one uncultured British plebeian might presume.
Luna nodded thoughtfully. “You were gone for a while.”
“When was the last time?” asked Hayden, curious.
“It wouldn’t be if you just told me what it is,” Harry sniped, starting to lose his patience.
Malfoy turned back to look at him. The light from the window made it hard to see his eyes; the entire right side of his form doused in sunshine, and Harry still had so much trouble when it came to reading him anyway.
Oceania kicked him in the shin cheerfully. Harry didn’t know who Jackson Pollock was, but he agreed with Malfoy’s tone. His sunflower might be terrifying, but at least it
“Neither can I,” Charlie said cheerfully. “But I didn’t get sorted into Gryffindor to stand idly by whilst there are ceilings to be painted. Come on, Harry. Be a champ.”
“Why not?” she asked.
He began to laugh, felt her join in from where she was shaking on his lap. Once he’d started, he found he couldn’t stop.
Malfoy looked even more surprised.
Mayo squirmed against his neck. Harry felt that this was unfairly endearing of him. He said, “Come off it Malfoy, it’s not my fault your dragon likes me so much.”
“You did what?” murmured Draco. His face was pressed into the leather of the sofa, his pale hair falling in soft strands across his cheek. He smelt like everything Harry had missed. He tilted his head and smiled.
But Malfoy doesn’t shut up. She opens her eyes, smiling sweetly at Harry, eyes cruel.
“Do what?” asked Harry. Malfoy still hadn’t let go of his wrist.
Hermione smiled back. She had always been so brave.
“That “purity” bullshit. Selfless “I shall do no harm” shit. Keep up.”
They were walking back to her cottage together when Harry felt it. The curious, magical tugging to the side of him, perhaps towards the set of trees to his right. He touched Oceania’s shoulder.
“It’s kind of hot.” says Harry, walking briskly to keep up. Draco feels his cheeks flare up, and raises his chin.
Harry frowned at him.
Draco tilted his head to the side. “You have to feel what she feels,” he said, and Harry could tell from the way he said that he understood the weight of this. He looked away.
He stepped close to the back of the blond head and lowered his voice. “Is that you Astoria?”
Draco is silent, pulling on her robes as she avoids Harry’s eye in the mirror. The sound of swishing material folding in on itself fills the room.
In the end, Pansy didn’t get the most expensive option. She got the octopus rolls. And a shot of sake.
Harry looked out the window for a moment. He wished, in that moment, that living wasn’t the effort that it was. He wanted everything to be easy, just for once. Was that so wrong? Did it make him a coward, to not want things to be difficult?
Malfoy laughed abruptly, a shocked sound. “
Malfoy looked at him. “Not to escape yourself,” he said after a moment, “To become bigger. To become more yourself.”
Sex is just a different sort of honesty.
“That’ll teach you,” he said triumphantly around the grin, the bowl still clutched in his hands. “Vegetarians bite back.”
And there was a man in the loch, his white back a small shape against the water, sinking deeper into the loch –
(It made it better. Of course it did.)
“I see,” said Malfoy again. “And what is the video to be of?”
When she opens it, Harry Potter is standing in her doorway.
Draco swallowed. He was flushed all over. He glanced down at the ground and then nodded.
Harry’s stomach lurched. He didn’t know if it was fear or excitement. He didn’t know what he was feeling. He drank the whiskey sour.
“I can go,” offered Oceania.
“Alright,” said Malfoy. “Shall we sit down?”
Harry just smiles and strokes Draco’s cheek with her thumb.
“Sometimes. During the war. Tonight.”
“Okay.”
Harry still felt watched. “Thanks,” he said, and took a large gulp. He tried to give it back to Hayden, but they shook their hand. Harry paused awkwardly, and then looked over to Malfoy and handed it to him.
Harry kind of wanted to ask, but the pressure was now entirely on him to inject at least a modicum of professionalism into the conversation. Otherwise, he was simply sitting in Draco Malfoy’s kitchen having a gossip about his sex life.
“Harry!” cried Charlie, struggling to sit up. “Draco! Osh..aynee…Oshaynee! Oshayneenah!”
Harry looked up. Malfoy took his chin, albeit gently, between his thumb and forefinger. Harry was aware that he was holding his breath, but couldn’t stop.
“I got your letter,” Harry said once they were all seated and pretending that the tea was cool enough to sip at. They both looked up at him. He couldn’t meet their eyes.
here – between the mountains and trees and great blue sky, the parts of him that were tucked away fluttered up and unravelled, great sprawling landscapes of thoughts, feelings – a form of honesty that encompassed the world and swallowed it whole. Osh helped. No one had ever loved him like that before.
Malfoy came and sat beside him. Harry could practically smell his amusement. He growled and rolled over, well aware he was throwing a toddler tantrum but to fed up to care.
“No,” Harry answered truthfully. Then he caught himself. “I think it might’ve been though, if I’d sat down and thought about it.”
Harry scratched his head. “Sorry,” he murmured. “Didn’t get a lot of sleep.”
“That was so bad,” he was saying, pushing the words past the eruptions of laughter that sounded like they were trying to suffocate him. Harry wished they would. “That was – oh god – truly fucking awful. You’re a mess, Harry. You’re an absolute mess. I just can’t –”
“Let me,” he whispers, dragging his mouth gently across the skin. “Let me take you home. I can light you up, as well.”
“Merlin.” Malfoy pushed himself off the island and went around to the sink, back to Harry. There, he filled a glass with water, the muggle way. He drank it slowly, pacing himself. Harry waited.
“Harry,” she said, and to his alarm her eyes were bright and shining as if she might cry again. “Maybe I…or maybe we don’t say this enough to each other, but – you are one of the most important people to us. To me. And I don’t want to have any unnecessary distance between us. Do you understand?”
“Yeah,” says Ron. “All the dudes. And lesbians, I guess.”
Harry rubbed his hands over his face. The silence expanded, filling the room to press at his skin, his ribcage.
Harry didn’t think Hayden was cold either, now he thought about it. He remembered the pub with the Lotus, and the exchange with the man Harry had accidentally witnessed. No, Hayden wasn’t cold. They just weren’t fully here.
“Fuck,” Harry says again, panting as they step out from behind the glass barricade of the air-conditioned air-port and onto the dusty pavement. “This really isn't England, huh.”
“Okay,” said Harry, and lay down next to him. He looked up at the sky.
“Have you guys seen the stick yet?” Harry asked.
He turned around, his face bare. “What I want is so simple. So very simple. We can pretend it isn’t, but it is. We can pretend this is about me, but it’s about you, Harry.”
Luna lived in a very blue house. It wasn’t the sort of light, gentle blue middle class Caucasian women typically put in the bathrooms to create a calming, sea-themed effect – it was a loud, pigmented, no-nonsense kind of blue. The kind of blue that wanted you to know, without a doubt, that it was Blue with a capital B, and it wasn’t interested in your complicated mixed-shade opinions. It was the kind of blue that came straight from the bottle.
He was sick of feeling like a goddamn foreigner.
Then he got up. Harry watched as he walked away to the training room. Stupidly, inexplicably, he felt a bit like crying. He didn’t understand why this was happening the way it was. How it had come to this in the first place.
“Turn around,” she says, and turns Draco around. Draco looks down and grasps her head, kneading her fingers through all that thick black hair, heavy with the shower water trickling down the line of her back; her velvet skin, russet brown and luminous against the dull white of the bathtub, and then Harry leans up and kisses her stomach, mouthing her belly button, sucking one breast into her unforgiving mouth.
He didn’t seem drunk. But he looked happy enough to be here, even in his monk robe.
“You have feelings?” said Malfoy, sitting down. His tray had a multitude of fruits on it, each in its own section, as well as a single scone and pile of cream. “Dammit, I’ve forgotten a fork.”
Draco didn’t say anything. All that happened was that his mouth moved, almost inadvertently, and his thumb twitched over his clenched fist. The air came rushing back into Harry’s lungs like water. He gasped.
“Okay, Harry.” says Hermione, after a couple awkward seconds. “That’s fine.” She puts a hand over Harry’s.
“Do you?” He can just hear Harry’s grin get wider.
Now Harry did stop walking. He turned to look at her. “Why do you say that?” he asked.
the wetness and slide and heat – Harry grips her thighs hard enough to bruise – and pulls her in, and groans, her voice strangled –
“What did he say?” said Hayden slowly. They looked like they were trying very hard not to smile. Harry didn’t appreciate it.
“Is this a typical Charlie Night?” asked Harry, turning back to Charlie.
When did it start? Draco wasn’t sure. For so long everything had been narrow-sighted – actions following each other, things he had to do – making it through the day, the month, the year, this entire fucking life – he hadn’t been able to afford to think. To think about it. About anything.
“No. Well. I’m not sure if Mal – Draco still wants to teach me.” Malfoy smiled down at his tray.
Harry rolled over further, until he was on his belly. He blinked up at her, a little stupidly, but mostly content. “Osh,” he said. “Do you ever get the feeling that Draco is flirting with me?”
Malfoy sat up a bit and closed his notebook. He glanced away, towards the mountains.
“What do you mean,” he said quietly. “When you say “not quite right”?”
“I won’t flirt with you if you don’t want me to, Harry,” he said, and then waved his hand. “Come on, or we really will miss the dances. Stop hugging that tree.”
“I thought it’d be fun,” he said simply.
One of the things Draco especially liked about Harry was that he was so simple. Not that he was stupid, even if Draco occasionally liked to make fun of him for it, or that he was boring, but that he was willing to take life at face-value. Maybe it was a flaw. But when Draco said he felt a certain way or wanted a certain thing, Harry almost always took his word for it.
The walk back is always shorter than the walk there. Draco comes down the stone path and goes into her cottage. Somehow, it seems even smaller than before, but that’s okay. The paint is peeling off in places as well, and at least that she can improve.
Hayden smiled in the corner of their mouth. “Charlie likes to pretend they don’t.”
“It’s not
in the gay world. Harry, the word gay is primarily for men. Why do you think they’re always talking about boy on boy couples?”
“Oh really?” Malfoy’s voice was half-hysterical, muffled beneath his fingers. “Oh, truly, what would I do without you Potter? Who else would point out the bleeding obvious for me? What other astute observations shall we make on this fine afternoon? Could air, perhaps, be directed through the nasal passage? Do dragons have wings? Is the sky fucking
“I wanted to be friends,” he said.
Harry leaned down, his face pressed against the mat. The foam was cool against his face, and he could feel the sun on his back.
“Thank you,” Harry croaked.
“Not right now,” she agreed easily. “But you will be after you go into the bathroom and put it on.”
Malfoy’s voice was shockingly loud in the clearing. Harry felt himself jump. He was sure there were spots of red rising under his cheekbones as well.
“Back for more, are you Potter?”
“You’d think so,” murmurs Harry. “Given the things you tell me to get me off when we fuck.”
The long line of Draco Malfoy’s back had been the brightest thing the night Harry had found him. The naked curve of it had allowed the moonlight to slide down it like a living thing, before dripping white down into the blueness of the loch. As Harry had swam closer to him, one of Draco’s pale hands had flickered, fingers drawing in ripples that had enclosed the shape of them like wedding rings. For a moment, when Harry had been swimming, he had thought that Draco wasn’t real. He had thought it was something that his mind had fashioned up for him.
okay, I’m sorry, you don’t have to
Hello, hello, welcome back. Merry Belated Christmas.
Harry looked at her. He looked at the table. He looked at Pansy.
“Just call him,” said Delia. “It’s not like you’re busy.”
Harry couldn’t breathe.
“Nothing. And he’s great.” A cold hand ran over his forehead. “Fucking peachy, Charlie.”
“I’m not going to miss them,” Harry told him. “I’m just approaching at my own pace.”
“Oh yeah,” Charlie said loudly. Oceania giggled, her arms wrapped around his neck, which was probably wise, what with the way he was swaying. “That was kind of gross. No offense Malfoy. But it was a bit gross.”
“You want to stay, don’t you?” He whispered furiously. Fear filled Draco’s chest, his heart speeding up.
“Too bad, we coulda had fun, handsome.” She said this while looking up at Potter, a grin taking over her mouth.
“Don’t know.” The first man answered, eyeing Potter suspiciously.
“I don’t know.” Potter replied quietly, and Draco was sure the man would leave it at that. He closed his eyes and tried to doze off.
“I think the Church’s priorities have been skewed for some time, don’t you?”
One of the men lunged at Potter, sword in hand. In the flurry of movement, Draco missed when Potter acquired the man’s sword, but not when Potter plunged the sword into the man, blood spilling onto the ground. This action enraged the rest of the men, who lunged themselves at Potter all at once. Draco’s nerves consumed him as he watched the brutal fight unfold before him. He was frozen to the spot, only reacting when a dagger punctured Potter’s chest. He couldn’t see exactly how badly the man was injured, but he couldn’t just stand by. Trying to calm his erratic breathing, Draco focused and recited the most powerful spell he knew by memory. He faintly heard the boisterous cheering of the Spirits around him before a strong gust of wind mingled with scorching flames engulfed the remaining men. They didn’t even have time to scream before the fire consumed them.
Draco’s eyes narrowed and he leaned closer to Potter.
“A scar then, or some sort of disfigurement? Your face looks nice from what I can see, so maybe—” Draco cut him off, cheeks heating.
“I’m looking for a man.” Potter began. “He is an expert in hiding in the shadows and has drummed up support for his
violate my privacy and all.” Draco countered, smiling lightly.
They moved through the winding trails of the village, scanning for anything out of place. There was nothing.
“No.”
“I-I’m sorry, father. Pansy, she was d-dying and I—”
hungry.
“As it’ll be fair when you answer some of my questions since you
“Tickets to the Coliseum, half price for the next hour!”
“…heard her husband got dragged away last night, poor thing.”
A look of clarity dawned on Potter’s face before he nodded, “He frequents the market. I know who he is.” That was all of the explanation given. Draco didn’t want to push his luck, so he let his curiosity ebb. Secrets, secrets everywhere.
Just as one man pulled out a large, curved dagger and the other reached for his axe, an arrow flew right in between them. One of the men stumbled to avoid getting hit and the other tumbled over a chair. Draco found a petite young woman with long, fiery red hair at the end of the bow that had fired the arrow.  Draco watched on as a well-built young man stepped out through a door from behind the bar, and easily clutched the two men by their shirts before he tossed them out of the tavern.
“Why did you tell that woman that I was a priest?” Draco asked as he sat down on his neatly made bed. They’d arrived at the only inn that still had rooms available for travelers shortly before nightfall. The inn was large, with a bustling cafeteria, a good-sized training ground, which was used by those travelers who came to compete in the local coliseum. The thing that had excited Draco the most were the private baths they offered. He’d taken his time to wipe away the dirt and grime off of him, taking extra care to wash his hair, the pale blond locks reaching his mid-back. He’d also discarded his old robes and purchased a pair of durable black trousers and a long-sleeved shirt to keep him warm. He, of course, kept his cloak firmly secured over his shoulders and over his head.
They left the lively Inn the following morning after a hearty breakfast, meat had been served – oh how long had he gone without meat? – and a quick trip to the market. Draco bought some dried fruits and nuts, a small wedge of cheese, and a few herbs. Potter had stuck close to him and had only bought a few strips of dried meat and asked to have their flasks refilled with water. Draco noticed him eyeing a few pieces of jewelry and he couldn’t stop himself from asking the man about the woman from back at the tavern.
Draco didn’t argue with that.
“Woah, hey, don’t get up so fast.” The familiar voice said, and Potter was suddenly in front of him, looking a little disheveled and bruised but otherwise fine. He held his hands up, palms facing toward Draco as if he were trying to calm a wild, frightened animal.
“What is someone like you doing here, and why are you looking for me?” Potter’s voice was stern, but the bite of disgust was gone.
They continued on their way with renewed energy. Both clearly set on what they had to do, but unaware of the winding road they were descending upon.
“You didn’t leave, even though I…”
will come for you.”
“Yes, they will.”
.” The last word was said with such venom that it had Draco sitting up and facing the other man. The room was dark enough that he couldn’t fully see Potter’s face, but he could practically feel the hatred radiating off of him.
A particularly strong gust of wind rattled the branches overhead and nipped at Draco’s face. They’d finally reached the neighboring forest, and Draco noticed how the large trees they were trekking through were beginning to lose their greenish coloring. A few reddened leaves littered the ground and the branches of the tall trees appeared dull and listless. Winter was fast approaching.
Draco stayed silent as the scene unfolded. Potter asked the men a few more questions but wasn’t able to get any more information about what the creature looked like. Draco made his own inferences given the little details he had. A creature with the taste for human flesh narrowed it down to a few options, and none of them were ones Draco wanted to encounter.
“I didn’t see any tracks anywhere, did you?” Draco asked, eyeing the land surrounding them. He had expected to find some sort of animal or creature prints on the ground, but the soil seemed undisturbed everywhere they’d searched. The only signs of movement on the ground were regular human footprints.
A snap of a twig had Draco jumping, wide eyes turning toward the source of the noise. He saw a man emerge from behind one of the wooden houses, eyes glowing an eerily red. He stalked forward toward them, his gait stilted and stiff.
“Alfred was the one who’d started telling everyone to stay indoors after sundown. Said there was a creature out here taking animals and killing people.” A woman said, tears running down her cheeks.
.” Potter intoned, voice low and cutting.
“You’re not trying to stop him all by yourself, are you?” Inexplicably panic rose up Draco’s throat.
He fell asleep to the sound of Potter’s soft, even breathing.
Draco was just about finished with his tea when he heard the rough sound of a door slam and a pair of arguing voices. He looked up and saw as Potter and a redheaded young woman rounded the side of the bar. Draco recognized her as the archer from his first visit here. They seemed to be in a serious argument, but they kept their voices low enough that Draco couldn’t make out much of what they were saying.
“No.” The firm retort had Draco curling into himself, head bent low. Shame heated his face.
“Cut off its head!” Draco yelled over the creature’s cries. Potter moved quickly, getting a clear cut through the creature’s neck. Draco urged the flames to consume the still moving remains, watching in disgust as the smoke turned a deep black.
“Neither have I. Only in the pages of the books I’ve read.” Draco crouched down next to Potter. “After draining the bodies of the villagers, it probably dumped them somewhere in the forest.”
“It may have been a traveler that passed by a few days ago. Alfred’s will was not yet gone, he tried to fight it, but the influence he was under grew stronger with each nightfall. A skilled vampire is able to hide its true nature, although why it only chose to enthrall just one among you is strange.”
“The master vampire that enthralled him must have already left this place. They don’t usually leave their thralls to their own devices, but the reckless ones do so in order to create a panic.” Draco paused. “It’s strange, though. Vampires have been dormant for years now, it’s been over a century since there’s been reports of an attack.” The Church kept very detailed reports of dark creature attacks, and vampires were low risk on the list. What would make them start acting up now?
“I’ll find out soon enough.” Potter said, moving toward the door. Draco followed, drawing his hood over his head, and tying it securely. He nearly ran into Potter’s back when the man stopped.
“And, won’t going to the city they rule over the most lead to your eventual capture?”
put you at great risk, and you had a right to know that before accepting my offer.”
“I didn’t think seeing a woman like that would affect you this much.” The words weren’t mocking, but they still caused Draco to drown in embarrassment.
Draco tripped over his words, trying and failing to come up with a lie.
“A-a word, please.” He croaked, unable to keep his voice from shaking. The man stopped and turned to face Draco, mouth set in a thin line and eyes unfazed by any emotion. He was an intimidating figure, tall of stature and with a strong build no doubt a result of his dangerous work. His eyes were a striking green, and there was a peculiar scar on his forehead, peeking out from behind the black strands of his unruly hair.
The ambush. The blood. The revelation.
payment.
“Then how can you—” Draco held his hand up in order to cut off the rest of the words. He was growing a little frustrated with the black-haired man.
?” His father had asked once they’d gotten home, the anger in his face mingling with the desperation in his voice. He’d never looked this haggard and Draco couldn’t help the tremble that overtook his hands.
“You’re injured.” Draco reached out and dragged Potter down to his level. His head was pounding terribly, and his hands shook as he tried to remove the man’s armor. Potter’s hands replaced Draco’s when his only fumbled.
Draco awoke with a start when he felt hands descend upon his body. His mouth opened, but he was unable to scream when a rough hand pressed itself against his lips. His eyes, unfocused and still full of sleep, shifted in every direction to try and make sense of what was happening. His heart stopped when he saw the fuzzy image of Potter struggling in the ground, two large men pinning him down as a third held a sword to his head. Potter was bloodied and bruised.
They argued over whether or not a fire was necessary, Draco insisted it was while Potter declared it was too dangerous. They could be easily spotted by the smoke, Potter said in an irritated tone that left Draco frowning. Potter was right, of course, but would he always carry with him that sour disposition?
Draco looked up in time to see the man walking in the direction of the bar. With fumbling fingers, he adjusted his satchel and hurried after the man, not even bothering to correct him again.
“I’m making connections that may not be there, but if they are could mean a whole lot more trouble than I’d originally thought.”
“O-oh, n-no, we’re j-just—”
“Oh no, you’ll get no answers from me since you haven’t answered any of my questions.” Potter’s tone was lighthearted. Draco was a little thrown off by the man’s change in attitude, but it wasn’t altogether unpleasant or unwelcome.
Draco wanted to say that he understood if Potter wanted to leave him. That his situation would lead them down a dangerous road, and Potter had every right to leave and not look back. He didn’t owe Draco anything, didn’t even know him that well to care what happened to him, but…the words wouldn’t come. Draco was so terribly afraid of being left alone again. He was selfish and didn’t want to lose the man’s companionship. He’d never been able to stand the solitude.
“How?!” Draco all but squawked, cringing at the high-pitched tone of his own voice.
Those had been Father Severus’ parting words.
His head spun and throbbed, and Draco fell to his knees. He’d never used such powerful spells before, the Church prohibited their Initiates from performing them.
He would finally get away; he would finally reclaim his own path.
After a few more casual words between them, Potter announced he was going to take a bath and left Draco alone in the room. Draco laid down on his bed, covering himself with the blankets. He was exhausted and it didn’t take long for his eyes to shut and sleep to overcome him.
He’d read about these creatures, though there was little known of them because of their reclusiveness. Fire usually did the trick in destroying them, along with…
Potter chuckled softly at that.
He opened his eyes when the sensation ended. A soft gasp left his lips when he saw that the other man was right in front of him, his wide, green eyes glued onto Draco’s still glowing hand. When Draco removed the hand from above his wrist the glowing came to an end and revealed the healed wound. All that was left behind was a smear of dried blood.
“Perhaps, we should get going.” Draco whispered to Potter when the man returned to his seat. Potter stared down at him, frowning. The man’s silence spoke volumes.
“He’s enthralled, Potter!” Draco shouted. “Don’t let him bite you!”
“We won’t make it to the next town today. Let’s set up camp around here for tonight.” The gruff voice pulled him away from his assessment of the rapidly dying vegetation.
.” A shiver of dread raced down Draco’s back and his entire body began to tremble. Draco groaned when the man pulled off his hood.
“We’ll get ourselves one tasty reward for this one, don’t you think so, men?” A depraved voice sounded off from behind Draco as the hand around his waist tightened painfully. Rowdy laughter followed that statement.
“What about him here?” One of the men holding Potter down asked, his pudgy face dirtied and riddled with scars.
“A town south of the Imperial City. It can only be reached by ship, which I plan to take at the southern harbor.” Draco had his entire trip planned out. Father Severus had provided much needed insight on the comings and goings of the city and which ship he could board that would take him across the Green Sea. If he just followed his path carefully, and with Potter’s help reaching the city, Draco was sure he’d see his family soon.
The bloody gash underneath Potter’s shirt ran vertically along the man’s ribcage, in an area the armor plates didn’t cover. Ignoring his headache, Draco gently pressed his hand against the wound. His hand immediately glowed a soft white and the gash slowly began to close. He heard Potter hiss at the sensation as he ran his hand down the wound, effectively healing it.
Draco straightened his back, mouth slightly agape. When the other raised a brow in question, Draco nodded fiercely. He couldn’t believe this was happening.
Their conversation was put on hold when some of the villagers came out of their homes. Whispers broke out that turned into louder chatter, a few of them coming to thank Potter and him for what they’d done.
Draco slept soundly for the first time in a long while and was unaware of Potter returning to the room minutes later, or of the curious gaze directed at him.
Draco didn’t know how to respond. He himself was proof that the Church’s focus on tracking dark creatures was no longer a priority. They cared more about finding those Touched by magic than they did anything else.
“Who did this to you, Alfred?” Potter asked.
“You aren’t the only one they’re going to be looking for. I don’t care what you are, or why they’re after you. We made a deal and I am a man of my word.” His solemn response wasn’t what Draco was expecting. Potter looked determined, the fierce look in his eyes catching Draco’s breath.
“No, she’s not.” Potter replied and then countered with a question of his own, “Why do you want to know?”
The man’s eyes grew a little, but they returned to their cold state immediately.
“You aren’t coming with me, Draco.” The firm voice the man used had Draco fidgeting, but he had already come to terms with his resolve.
“Some monster feeding off us is what.” The second man said, terrified voice wavering. “It’s been comin’ at night for the past week! First it took the farm animals and now it’s comin’ for us.”
“Oh, right. Well, I actually...I already knew.” Draco snapped his eyes back up, watching as Potter rubbed the back of his neck, a bashful look on his face.
“I heard of you through Father Severus, I don’t know how he knew of you, but he was adamant that I find you.”
“No. Contact with the world outside of the Church is forbidden until one takes the Rites. Even then, very few Priests are actually allowed to leave.” Draco turned to find a horrified look on Potter’s face.
“He goes by the name Voldemort.” Potter said solemnly. Draco had never heard that name before.
He wasn’t
“One last question, if you escaped from the Church, won’t they be searching for you?”
“Most creatures that hunt hide only long enough to stalk their prey, but once they catch it, they care very little about who sees them. This one waits until nightfall to hunt and drags its prey away from the village to feed. Perhaps, it has a nest around here?” Draco pondered out loud. Potter hummed in answer, getting up from his seat.
There was little else to say after that. They retreated into their room and Draco dropped himself onto his bed, not caring about the various holes in the blanket that covered the tattered cot.
And so,
I shouldn’t have violated your privacy—”
“What are you thinking?” Draco asked, eyes fixed on the ceiling. He heard Potter shuffle out of his armor and the creaking of the bed as the man settled into it.
“I would if I could.” Potter’s voice was soft, a sadness that had not been there before lacing his words. Potter remained quiet for a moment.
Damn his curiosity.
“I can’t stop it. I can’t stop it. I can’t stop it.” Alfred’s movements became twitchy, a groan leaving his mouth as sharp teeth gleamed in the moonlight. Alfred stood still, sniffing the air before him, and suddenly he moved. Alfred rushed forward with deadly speed, disjointed hand reaching for Potter.
“Stay behind me.” Potter barked out as he reached Draco’s side, shielding Draco with his body. Draco’s mind reeled, surely, surely Potter had seen him. Seen what he was, and yet the man was still willing to protect him. Draco wiped at his eyes, steeling his emotions.
Draco jumped out from behind Potter, eyes frantic as he saw the two men make contact. Potter’s sword dug into Alfred’s abdomen, but this didn’t slow the man down.

When he entered his home the music stopped. The house was silent and dared Harry to speak against it.
It was exhilarating. Violins and orchestras put together by a lass with the voice of an angel. She sings and his mother screams. He thinks the song screamed too. The music had filled the car like water. Cool to the skin. He didn’t know noise could be cold. He didn’t know a lot of things.
He makes his way to go but Penny grabs his arm. “Harry wait!”
Harry ran with boxes in hand, Daniel trailing behind him.
“What are they doing?”
“It’s been nearly two years ‘Mione. It took you two years.”
Dean, Potter and Seamus were in the same bar across from Draco. As they stretched the boys began to chatter.
He pauses. “Letters supposed to arrive this week.”
Harry had collected more books. Miss had even given him a few pamphlets to read through. It all fascinated him.
. Funny that. Harry's first true heartbreak wasn't lost love or mind numbing loss. It wasn't even his fault. Just circumstance. God damn circumstance that made the earth shake and the heavens cry. Within seconds Harry watched his brother walk out of that courthouse and he pulled himself away from the wall to follow. All he could do was follow. No words formed and his throat felt dry in despair. The rooms blurred around him and seemed to move along while he stayed still. The only thing in focus was him, and the time.

“That could be a fox hole you know.” He reminded her.
Amos pats his back and looks on sadly. “Leave him be.”
reasons for lying and asking about it in front of the person he'd lied to would probably not have been the brightest idea. Harry pretending to look oblivious walked towards the front of the school.
The blond boy raised an eyebrow. "What's your name?"
“Dean Thomas.” The boy next to Seamus looked stunned. Dean turned to Seamus and they whispered together excitedly. Harry didn’t know how they could already be friends.
Draco paused and raised his eyebrows. “Pardon?”
He scoffed. ‘What have you been doing all these years to make you this shite then?”
"What if I don't want to!"
There were empty old rooms in one corner of the lodge. He wasn’t sure if they were out of bounds or not but he didn’t seem to really care, and he wandered them nonetheless.
He lied in his bed that night. A shared Room with Cedirc who had previously slapped him on the head for using his record. Harry just laid there and thought. He thought about his mother, who had been so devastated by a death the memory had planted itself into the music of his mind. He thought about James Potter, a man he’d never really met but shared a name with. A man who was said to have shared a stark resemblance to his son. The son he goes and dies on. The son who wasn't his son anymore.
“Did you hear? Apparently they approved so many lads this year there's going to be a small class of boys separately, about five I think.”
Harry bit his lip. “Dunno never been.”
Hermione seemed to almost cry though Harry couldn’t quite tell. For a moment it sounded like a sad bitter laugh. “My mother…”
so. "No." he gulped.
She turned to him. “Are you a lover of the arts, mister Diggory?”
“Lilly Evans, my mother remarried. She died a couple years ago.”
“I mean…It’s a tad odd for a ballet class to be dancing to. I mean we're not even doing ballet!”
Blaise seemed to find then the right moment to speak. “
Dean was true in his words. Draco could have guessed he knew everything relevant there is to know about his classmates, but their homes he hadn’t really thought about.
Dean laughed. “Harry, you eat like a whale and dance like there's no tomorrow. If you don’t end up those two things then I’ll shrink.”
Harry knew he’d never been the best at making friends. The only people he could really count up until ballet was was Ron. Ginny and Luna had only come into the picture recently.
He didn't know if his words were an insult or not. They still seemed to sting and he wanted to sigh in relief when his name was called.
He wiped his eyes. “I’ll miss you.”
“Well...there are few times we're
Harry let out a weak smile.
Snape raised an expectant eyebrow when the blond boy's hand shot up. “Draco, yes?”
They were practising his performance one afternoon. Harry proud of his progress but still failing in Malfoy’s eyes. "It’s just wherever I’m around him, he’s insufferable! He’s so high and mighty! And! he fills a quiet room with
He felt like a fool then, Stumbling and getting the timing wrong he knew. Malfoy had pointed out every flaw he had and watching the two people he’d come to admire analyse him could have been disastrous.

He eyes it off curiously. “Won’t your dad notice?”
He raised an eyebrow. “What's that got to do with it?”

She leaned down and lifted his leg up higher. “Heel out. Drop your hip.”
“Express what?”
“Don’t be stupid.”
Harry stopped trying to direct his Grandma to the proper grave. If she realised that her daughter-in-laws headstone had been graffitied she would have just gotten upset.
Amos shakes in anger and turns to see Harry standing there shocked.
Ron rolled his eyes. “Yeah you better.”

He bright grin spread across his face. A charming pleased smile stared back from the mirror. He looked towards Mrs Weasley proud.
.” every jump a boy made.
She seemed to chuckle maniacally and look around nervously.
“I don’t think that’s the kind of life I want Ron.”
The first time he tried to pirouette at home he fell into the bathtub. In hindsight he didn’t think it was a very good idea to fill the tub up before his impromptu practise.
"Again, what?"
“Once the next holidays are over.”
He visits his mother's grave one last time with his father. They sit in front of it and clean up the graffiti.
“Jesus Christ Harry, you're a disgrace to them gloves and the traditions of this boxing hall.”
Harry forced straight face. "It’s perfectly normal. Loads of people do it."
He can feel the tears again. Slower this time. He thinks she might cry too.
“I need help.”
“Dad...If I change my mind can I come back?
Every time he went, without fail, he would find Malfoy with the same conflicted expression towards the landline. After Harry was noticed most times Malfoy would loom at him. Sneer or mumble something insulting before walking away, sometimes he wouldn't even lift his gaze away from the phone. the boy wouldn’t even flinch or waver and the two boys would both stand silent and still and bathe in the orange sunset and warm walls.
Amos never thought he’d try to cross the picket line. He thought he had enough pride to not. But this wasn't about pride anymore. He got dirty knowing looks from the other men attempting to board the bus to the mines.
He stays silent and breathes heavily and looks down. She holds her hands in front of her mouth and steps forward. They don't look at each other.
Draco caught his breath and coughed a little before speaking. “What’s Everington like? I've never lived anywhere other than London before.”
thought came upon his head causing an unpleasant choking fit that Draco also seemed to ignore.
“I ‘ave!” He defended.
Greg slumped against a wall and looked across book spines. “We've been dropped off, our parents are all having dinner together.”

“What do we have.”
“Just a few quick announcements. I hope everyone can refrain from shoe storage browsing out of hours this year as there have been a few instances of damage and some new commissioned pieces we want to keep ready for the end of year performances. Upper years are free to go.”
"It's near where my mother lives, close to the city."
Ginny thinks about this. “—Bill once told me some men are so afraid of what others will think, they don’t stop to wonder if that thinking is even bad or not. I don't think what people might think of you is bad Harry. Others might but... I think sometimes people are so afraid of judgement, they don't even ponder if that judgement is founded or not.”
“It’s for Harry!” Amos grabs his son. “We’ve got to give him a chance, Cedric.”
He was glad Cedric wasn’t home when Amos sat him down. The man pushed him to the other side of the table.
He regretted the words the moment he spoke them.
“You haven't been practising!”
“It’s either this or we never get it. Make your choice.”
Amos kept this on his mind, even while he scolded the boy his Cedric had once called a friend.
“Mcgonagall said she heard they were already delivered to the changing rooms!”
Harry gulps. “You gotta start training from when you're young.”
Amos walked off to leave Harry to glare at the gloves. He hated that he was supposed to honour gloves from someone he'd never met and had no relation to. Cedric had never gone to boxing and no one had cared about that. Harry didn't want the expectations. They constricted his heart like a snake catching mice.
Vincent and Greg were
“...My mother. She’s maybe danced every role imaginable in the ballet. Fathers a pianist. My grandmother taught the art in Italy. It was to be expected.”
“Does this mate o’ yours have any brains?”
Cedric looked side to side in search for Amos and sighed when he found no sight of the man, probably asleep upstairs. “How urgent is this?”
“...Sorry.”
Harry wondered if Daniel and Penelope danced together.

There was an old man who stood out the front towards the end of the assembly. Harry was shocked at how long his beard was and how rugged and sleepy he looked. The man seemed to absorb light and looked completely out of place. It made Harry feel better as most of the adults dressed like they were headed to a fancy dinner. This man had an old purple coat and a seemingly scratchy barrette upon his snow white thin hair. The man looked comfortable amongst the stage and no one seemed to blink an eye at his appearance.
“That's why they say people 'get pissed' Harry.”
I wrote all of this out on paper before typing this out, seeing as I usually read each chapter about twice I already did this while typing and I am to tired to re-read again lol. If there are any issues that's probably why. Still this method was faster seeing as I achieved writing this within two days so maybe I will stick with this method. Who knows!
Seamus walked back and Snape seemed to think this a teaching moment. “Can anyone tell me why

"When?"
“What's all that shouting?” Dean called from the clearing.

Harry’s eyes widened and turned to Daniel. “Really?”
“Shove it old man.”

.” He seemed to add the last part with hesitance.
His eyes follow the bus and ignore how his body is pushed backwards as he tries to get forwards.
Harry looked towards mirror Malfoy. “Did you look like your mother?”
Draco paused his humming to sigh. “I don’t know? Why is anyone afraid of anything?”
The piano was louder past the make shift barrier.
He’d tricked himself into thinking he would today. Maybe he actually would have if not for the ballet class across the halls.
Ginny grins devilishly at her brother. “One of us has to.”
And then the world

Draco Malfoy and Harry lots-of-last-names figure out their new situation, argue with each other and other's, and have unacknowledged eye contact.
Harry looked at him shocked and Seamus seemed to flush. “I mean, you're both good! Plus he’s going to be all tall and skinny when he grows, and Hermione said she reckons you’ll be broad and fit."
“I hope for
“Not long, a year and a bit.”
Some days his routine had to swerve though. Some days he’d wake up to find his grandmother missing.
Malfoy sent a cruel look Harry’s way before shooting his hand up.
Amos pumps his fist in the air. “Fuck yeah!” His voice is hoarse and shaky.
Draco couldn’t help but let out a chuckle. Dean looked back and Draco forced his expression still.
Seamus seems to mouth ‘

Potter shook his head slightly with his thinking eyes closed. “Not true, I can name so many songs not about those two things.”
“This your first audition? How long have you been training? Yeah I've been doing this or two years now.” His questions didn't wait for answers.
Mcgongall addressed the class broadly. “This year we will focus on many things to improve your
They both had a fire within them, an urge or passion. Snape wasn’t one for metaphors but he knew where they had the capabilities to go.
“I think I like it.”
He found himself practising almost anywhere. Behind the school with Ron. In his bedroom with music playing. Usually in the bathroom.
He shrugged. “Dunno, guess were just the type of people meant to hate each other.”

but I didn’t really care. At least Not until it started getting cold and dark. I didn’t know where to go.”
Amos leans his head against the log fence. "Then it was more dull Harry. Under the surface. I loved her like one loves a flower. It wasn't until after when I fell In love with her."
Harry waved off the boy before staring at the lodge once more. There seemed to be kids and parents all around sorting things out and Harry couldn’t find it within himself to move much further.
Malfoy looked up and frowned. “What do you want?”
Molly Weasley finds their house. She tries to explain to his father. She hasn't realised there is no explaining. No words that could convince or draw sympathy from the shaky man. “Harry missed a very important audition today.”
Ron walked along the curb with his arms out. “Ginny told me your dad found out. Said he made a right scene in the middle of class.”
! Blaise Zabini. Draco Malfoy. ”
Draco wondered how Potter walked around with his hair as long as it was. He was almost convinced the other boy couldn’t see half the time. With his fringe so long sometimes it covered his glasses. The rest of his hair was at a normal length all besides that one anomaly. He wondered if the other boy would come back next year with the fringe gone. He wondered If he would come back with those out of place green eyes in view for all the world to see.
“You're a horrible friend.”
Mrs Weasley didn’t seem to like it either as she walked up to him and stepped on his foot, firm but not enough to hurt. “Boots off! What size are you?”
Mrs Weasley leaned over him and pointed ahead. “Find a spot of that
“What is it?”
was where his thoughts resides. This was all he thought about. Dreamed about. This was what he had.
“Don’t you dare Harry!” She commands.
Harry faced the blond boy. He was beautiful and lean and his skin was unblemished and smooth. He was perfect. He was perfect and Harry was
“Yes Harry?”
Editors note: Three in one day! Editing is way easier than writing that's for sure. I forgot how much I liked my head-canons and little flairs in this story. Toning down on the swearing a little bit even though Harry does it an eleven year old doesn't really think in swears. I was also trying to rush through the early ears back then to get to the romance but now I kind of which i'd sat in the younger years more. At least I didn't get too far.
Harry nodded a little dumbfounded and forced through a smile.
“London.”
Lucius turned to face his son and though his face was mostly obscured by shadow, Draco could see the never ending suspicion he expressed. “I will contact the school and request his transference immediately. If not his then yours.”
He couldn’t see the girls but they weren’t the ones that were interesting anyway. They were blocked off by mirrors brought up by Moody to the other boys dismay. What
...Harry preferred to watch everyone walk into the boxing hall before he did. To walk in there meant he couldn't leave for an hour. He treasured the few moments prior he had, standing outside the Everington Boys Club with his granddad's old boxing gloves hanging round his shoulders. He made the silence tortured as he kicked the sturdy blue door against the trashcan lazily while boys he knew were bound to knock him in the face in half an hour walked past by without a care. He wondered if most of the other boys enjoyed the sport. He reckoned they might.
She brings him back out to practise again. She isn’t less careful with her words. She’s straight forwards and watches him continue to fail. He doesn’t feel like failing. He hates the idea.
He only wished the other boy had the sense to achieve the distance he couldn’t.
, then out of each one fell pairs of dark red shiny pointe shoes.
One of the older men spoke up. “Name?”
“W—What cathedral?”
to be good Harry,
He’s glad she’s strong. His hurtful words did nothing to dent her. His eyes are still red in the mirror. But he doesn’t stop.
She smiled. “What’s your name?”
The group seemed to look around at each other as Draco walked into the dark.
He doesn’t think twice before running towards him.
“Dad! Some dancers are as fit as athletes.”
The dance still continues though. He lies with his legs up and he hasn’t walked normally in nearly ten months.
They both laughed as Ron dragged the rope Harry had climbed up. They ventured throughout the hall and Harry felt as if he was flying. Cold stiff stuffy air hit his face and fought against his laugh. He dropped down as quickly as he’d got up there.
He could have sworn the music made him move.
Harry paused. "Why would anyone do Ballet?"
“Durham? Isn’t there an amazing cathedral there?”
Happy Reading!
Harry looked across the room despite himself. A stringy weak built boy with a rabbity appearance and a face almost too confident for the one he had stood next to an unsurprisingly bored Blaise.
“Then why do you want
Harry almost smiles. “You think so?”
“Head down.”
Harry, who was horribly offended, confused and quite honestly embarrassed turned red. “Shove it!”
Snape ignored his mortified students. “

knows his father should be showing up any moment with the car, and to avoid a fuss he really should push the other boy away and go sit somewhere else.
His face slowly reddened.
He came to resent his own complementary statement when he himself had to leap in front of the class.
The next part he did on a whim. He ran towards the wall behind his dad before bouncing off of it and turning back. He prepared himself and flipped. The world spun and he caught himself into a cartwheel, more wobbly than he could have done but impressive nonetheless.
There was hope.
“Why don’t you join in?” She asked earnestly.
Draco taped his feet on the cold stone. “What are most songs about? Love, heartbreak.”
Draco kept his head high as he waited for Potter to figure out his stance. “
Harry holds it in his hands. "What are the twins gonna do? After high school."
Draco was mighty sure sneaking out would not be a good idea. The consequences of being caught was not a particular fate he felt the need to experience… even so.
Dean chuckled awkwardly. “Be sure to tell your mum her name sounds stupid. No offence mate.”
Harry had never meant to hear the secret. Never mind how he’d noticed Hermione’s disappearance after lunch and never mind how he just so happened to stumble upon that specific hallway. Just because he’d never meant to doesn’t mean he didn’t.
‘What are you doing Harry?”
“Cause you do.”
Draco shook his head. He hated how seriously he thought. He wondered if he had given up his childhood to these thoughts. He glanced backwards finally facing Potter and reckoned—
Harry stomps on the table and runs off. The plates are still rattling as he leaves.
. He looked up to see his dad standing in the hall's doorway. A few other drunk miners where behind him and seemed to walk away at the sight. Harry looked over to Ron who in panic was quickly pulling the tutu off.
She took a puff and paid him no mind. “
Potter the stupidly enthralling boy, he’d brought in magazines and letters from a friend. All these things detailing the specific uses of cosmetic materials and tips he gladly shared amongst the class. Lipsticks and face paints where handed out a plenty when they were given a little freedom after their first few attempts and soon Draco watched as an entire class laughed as they applied glue to their eyebrows and drew humongous fake smiles atop their own.
. With broad movements that turned to elegant steps into broader and
Harry grumbled and hugs his knees. Ron continues.
Harry bit back his tongue and watched the table explode. Dean looked at her with wide eyes. “What?”
Harry had never really taken the time to think about what he wanted to be when he grew up. Now it was all he thought about. The possibilities could have seemed endless, but they weren't. There was only one path he thought about. One road into his future that nagged at him and reached down into the very depth of child like wonder and hope he never thought he'd see again. No there was only one thing on his mind. One thing he had even thought bout before Miss and maybe even before ballet.
“Are you going to tell me what happened to your forehead then or is that a mystery for another day?”
Harry trudged along silently with his suitcase rattling along the concrete. The park was large and went on for miles around him. All he could see was green lovey hills spanning acres and acres around him. He felt so small. Harry couldn’t imagine anyone owning such a large estate. He couldn’t picture a place so big having once been sealed off from the public.
Draco flinched, seeming to imagine the pain.
Ron ushered him towards him and his sisters shared bedroom. Harry looked around the house trying to spot anyone else.
it's true. His thoughts were confined, stretched towards a few things and not much else. Ginny was nice sure. Something stopped him from speaking further though.
“Don't tell me… Is this the boy that broke your nose?”
Snape seemed to look between the both of them unamused before sighing and walking off.
. He thought his shoes were made to minimise the noise, but without the music it was blatantly obvious.
In turn Potter met Draco’s eyes and almost let his lips turn up before frowning. Draco stayed in an almost defensive stance while Potter made note of where his eyes had gone.
Harry loved dancing. That was clear to him. He loved the burn, the excitement that rose within him when he did it. His heart quickened at the sense of camaraderie he felt when him and his teacher danced in sync, like they could predict each other's movement and bounce off the others' actions.
Out of all of his endeavours general classes were maybe the worst part of his day, and he wasn’t a hundred percent sure if his limbs were sore from writing or dancing. His teacher for general science was a small squat woman who went by Miss Sprout. This was his only really remarkable class not for the subject but for the people.
“It’s too bad you know. I would have liked to see you dance.”
“That makes sense.”
And every time, the two were forced to stay late to practise. It was frustrating as all the other boys had progressed to practising with music.
It’s not painful. Pretty mild in comparison to boxing. But he thinks maybe this type of pain hurts the most. The Inside kind.
“The one in Durham…”
Draco scoffed before walking past him. “And
Harry had done his best to keep his distance. Dean and Seamus sat with him for most meals, and Hermione never ended up too far away. He would also go through most of the general classes on opposite sides of the room from the other boy. It was practise that seemed to force them to interact.
“You should stand up to him.”
Cedric handed over the landline. “Took you long enough, guy on the other side sounds worried.”
He can’t help but let out a laugh. “It’s the first thing that came to mind.”
Harry waited in the change rooms the entirety of boxing. It wasn't hard. Sitting down humming to himself was another one of his many skills. Of course he wasn’t exactly sure why he was doing it. Just merely half an hour ago he was determined to try at boxing once more, just like usual. But then he’d seen Mrs Weasley.
His anger doesn’t subside. “It’s fine for you! You're not the one doing it!”
Daniel cracked his back. “He kinda has too.”
Penelope patted Harry’s shoulder. “How bout you come round here tomorrow afternoon? You can watch us practise?”
His words made no sense to Draco. “But she’s sick—”

“Christ... Can’t you be a ballet dancer here?”
Narcissa smiled and Draco almost winced. “Your father requests your presence.”
Draco moved backwards and tried his mightiest to not let his ears turn red as the boy brushed past in a surprisingly gentle motion. “R—Right.”
The compliment made his cheeks turn red. He chewed the inside of his lip.
Malfoy huffed and Harry could have sworn his eyes were glossy. “My parents are very busy people, they don’t have time for a silly performance when I'm only in first year.”
Draco took his words and left. He kicked the doorway in his own pettiness on his way out and sighed. He had a feeling this would be a long holiday.
Draco paused and Dean nudged him with his elbow. “C’mon. It’ll be fun.”
“How long did it take you to get it like that?”
Harry sighed. “Night then.”
“He’ll just think it’s the twins.”
“I do. I hate that I do but I do.”
“Don’t raise your voice at me!”
He bangs on the mat. He can feel the tears well up before he even speaks. He’s got his escape plan and he can hear his heart thump rapidly within his chest.
Lavender tutted. “what’s your damage, Draco? You can't just openly be a dick.”
“Stop moving so carelessly, dance with purpose.”
Small Harry wasn’t paying attention to his crying mother. He cried all the time so action wasn’t anything new. What was new was the

“Stop that tapping! You going to tell me what's going on here?”
“It's normal for lasses Harry! You're a boy! Lads do soccer or boxing—or wrestling Harry.”
“Mum’s unfulfilled, that’s why she does ballet.”
Potter seemed to debate his next action before frowning and shrugging the other boy off. “Suite yourself then, christ.”
Greg replied. “Our liberties vanished when you took all your family's lenience and went to a bloody ballet school. Our parents can't afford us failing.”
create such a noise. Stop being so
His eyes were drawn to the last circle.
“In general classes.”
Harry leaned out the door from the waiting room. “Dad!” he whispered. “I can’t do it.”
“At least you two are practising
“What year are you in?” he asked.
“Harry?” A shrill surprised voice whizzed from beside Harry.
“That’ll take too long!”
Hope you enjoyed!
Harry sat there perplexed. He didn’t know if he was surprised at the odds or surprised at the fact that the universe just seemed to push him towards the boy he had assaulted for no reason. He gulped.
“Well nice to meet you Harry. I’m Penelope. Do you think you could maybe do me a favour and help me carry these boxes to the room? It’s just a few halls down.”
Harry leaned against the doorway. “She give you it?”
Miss called that type of dance contemporary. Before Harry would have just called it movement. This type of dance was well suited to his boots though. The hard noise they made could almost add to the song and he was glad to see how fun dance could be without structured and practise.
Amos gasped and took a step back.
Draco stepped on his foot on the way out. The other boy pushed him into the wall. Draco almost laughed.
A beat. A Cruel idea “Oh so you can dance then huh?”
Harry swallowed. “Dunno, I like to dance. I didn’t like boxing.”
He didn’t really want to fight himself or Miss on the matter. He promptly leaned down to untie his boots. In a few swift seconds he saw something drop next to him. Off white ballet shoes taunted him from the floor while Mrs Wealey taunted him from above.
The teachers had handed out schedules as well. Harry groaned reading through it. He knew he still
Snape nodded to the smug boy.
The weirdest thing to come out of it though was that he found himself throughout random moments of the day with his leg pointed out. His toes seemed to point themselves and his undefined bony hips dropped when he walked. Sometimes Ron would look at him weirdly when he stared at his legs under the school desks. This because he'd find himself arching it out like Miss had shown him during nearly all hours of the day.
Draco took a cautious step back before replying. “What she needed to hear. She can’t keep dancing like it is her side hustle. It’s obvious she hated it.”
Draco breathed heavily and Harry could almost feel his shaky breath come through the phone.
“I don’t have the money.”
Harry grumbles. “This has been a shite Christmas.”
Not when he just got here. “I’ll be sure to.”
Harry had been thankful that some length had reappeared before school had started back up but unfortunately there had been no hiding his scar.
The bus bobbed beneath his feet as the sky turned from pink to blue and became bright within the hill green landscape he'd come to find outside the watery window. He took a deep breath and breathed in the smell of smoke and freedom that filled his heart will the love only a child could have about the future. He burned with excitement and nervousness and every few seconds his body shook itself from nerve to nerve almost as if to remind him that he wasn't dreaming.
Sometimes when the two boys became worn out and tired and couldn't find the energy to speak small sliver of progress was made. Sometimes when the afternoon became quiet Harry could close his eyes and practise slow and steady movements to the sombre and restful noises of Malfoy’s footwork, but whenever he seemed to get comfortable Malfoy would take the chance to insult his posture or arm positions and another word full fight would begin.
“You say it like it’s an insult.” Dean expressed humorously.
He thinks Ron might be begging him to stop with his eyes. Harry couldn’t. He refused.
Harry missed the audition. What will become of his dream now. What is eleven year old to do when all the world seems to do is crumble.
“Says you, your proper shite at ballet.”
Draco himself had never liked his home. The walls were too dark and Victorian and the rooms each held their own secrets. It had never been a safely built home for a child and Draco thought himself lucky a maid or servant was around every corner growing up.
Penelope was going to Covet garden with all the other older students. She already had a company ready to take her under them and her career was about to start. Harry was five years under her and she could even be retired by the time he starts. This could be the last night he ever sees her dance.
“I don’t mind.”
Harry wonders if his dad wished he’d had more kids. Wonders if he and Lilly ever planned on having more. It probably wouldn’t help much with the money situation but what did he really know about the money situation. Moody had once told him that miners are born not made. Harry did not like Moody
“Fuck off!”

He wipes his nose and whispers. “I got in…”
Harry nodded understandingly. “You’ll get through it.”
"Grandma used to.”

“What are you doing?”
Harry thought about this. “Dunno...I guess it’s like electricity.”
Harry took in the man’s words.
“Why?” Harry questioned.

“Where's Daniel?”

“It was an accident!”
Shed raised an eyebrow at him and walked over. “You owe me fifty pence.”
Ron tapped his foot impatiently.
No one picks up.
He usually found himself next to a girl named Luna when he wasn't being the laughing stock of the class. Luna was a bit like Ginny in the fact that she doesn’t really do Ballet. She usually just twirls around and looks like she's lost. She speaks in riddles and goes on about nothing in particular. Ginny seemed to find her compelling. Luna reminds him of his Grandma.
Penelope smiled. “The teachers allow us older years some extra practise as long as we don’t damage the room.”
“The way you dance, It’s very feminine.”
Draco disciplined his expression before speaking. “Oh...Of course. Lead the way.”
He nodded sheepishly. “Negative attention is better than no attention right?”
“Think about it for a moment—What would the theatres think If they found out two of this schools dancers had gotten into a fight and were

from the before. They don't feel like memories though. Memories move.
“I’m sure you know Harry but at this school we have a strict no violence policy.” The Scottish lady explained.
—waiting to pull him up, then a pat on the back until he was ready to move again.
There was something about the other boy that thoroughly pissed Harry off. During classes he could always find Malfoy practising near the Zabini boy. During meals Harry would also see the two sitting and eating near the boys from the larger classes. Harry was sure he only noticed this due to the boisterous loudness that was Malfoy. He talked without any boundary and seemed to lead most of the conversations amongst his table. He could almost admire the boys confidence. A natural leader if not for his bratty attitude and cruel words.
Thankfully he wasn’t the only one to fall over in class. Ginny didn’t even try, she just stood there. Watched or walked away.
There were a few times she'd say the same thing Draco did. The same advice. Harry never wavered when he heard her though. She was kind and useful and helped where Malfoy couldn’t.
Potter scowled. “What right have you to shout at a girl like that!”
“Seamus Finnigan.” Seamus fist pumped to himself and looked at Harry with wide surprised eyes.
“What kind of house doesn't have a vases?”
“It’s seven in the morning.”
“I’m glad you think so, the school commissioned them on my behalf for the end of year performance. They are
Potter was the first to approach. “Hermione! Draco what did you do?”
Draco hadn’t really spoken much
Harry knocked on the door and felt his eyes rise up in shock when his friend opened the door with a

Harry stuck out his tongue and Draco ran a finger across his neck in a slashing motion.
She walked off. “Just a second.”
“Usually my Father takes us to Italy, of course he’s incredibly busy this year so I’ll most likely spend my time with a tutor. My father values my education outside of school”
Harry knew he should have felt more conflicted the first time he purposefully went to the seniors practise. Daniel’s doubt should have been enough to keep him away. It wasn’t. Penny's grin as he slowly entered was enough to cement his fixture to stay.
