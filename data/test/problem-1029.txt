“You’re welcome to go to the Apothecary,” the witch smiled widely, revealing yellowed gums and a missing tooth. “Or you could try Lavendine’s?”
It was a Saturday in Malfoy’s memories. Harry was sat cross legged on the bathroom floor whilst the other man fussed about with his creams. For some reason, Malfoy had gotten rather dressed up today, to the extent that Harry wondered if he was planning to go into the Ministry on his weekend.
It was clearly the start of the working day as hoards of wizards and witches came filing out en masse in sharp black suits and bulging briefcases.
and throwing the marble at the floorboards. A moment later there was a loud popping noise and a cloud of orange smoke wafted around the sofa.
“I’ll take milk, no sugars,” Harry instructed cheerfully as he sat down on his preferred chair with a battered, circular, blue cushion. “And a shortbread biscuit if you’ve got any left over?”
“Doubt it,” Ron replied, scrunching up his face. “I reckon if Pewterfoot had said it would be me and you rooting around in here, Malfoy would probably have refused to give them up. Bugger would probably have walked himself straight to Azkaban.”
“That’s real?” Draco snapped, all his defensiveness momentarily forgotten. The Sorcha Curse was meant to turn six of your loved ones into swans and, until you had sewn six cloaks of stinging nettle leaves, they couldn’t be turned back into humans.
Malfoy cast the sponge to one side and picked up a small silver spatula, using it to lever off scaly patches of what looked like corroded metal.
That was another thing that made Harry feel mildly guilty. Through Malfoy’s memories it had become obvious that the other man clearly missed living in a magical abode, often reminiscing about the enchantments soaked into the walls of the manor over centuries of use and exposure. Malfoy’s modest apartment was very much a new build with little of the history that Malfoy seemed to hold in such high regard.
Harry chewed on his lip as he thought back to the pile of job offers he had received after the War. He had discarded them all of course, his heart set on becoming an auror with Ron.
Draco realised that Harry was cutting them both thick wedges of cake as he sat down on one of the sturdy oak chairs at the kitchen table. “Aren’t we going to be late for your own party?” Draco enquired.
“I think I’ll manage,” Draco replied, “I have an excellent memory and if that fails me, I can always use the Gringotts pensieve.”
The back door was already propped open by a rather frightening ornamental sculpture of a snallgaster that Luna had gifted Harry for his birthday. Harry hissed as his bare feet hit the cold damp grass the lawn.
Draco jumped as he heard the bedroom door open. He hurried out of the bathroom to see Harry standing there with a plate atop of which sat two very large burgers.
Malfoy turned away from them to unbutton his robes, folding them neatly and stacking them on top of a set of shelves.
“Yeah, but let me tell you how we broke it,” Bill grinned, leaning forwards and diving into an exciting account of the investigation. Draco was on the edge of his seat for most of it, desperately jealous that he hadn’t been there to see it all happen. For some reason, Harry was still grinning like an inane idiot in the background but Draco tried to pay him no heed.
“Yes,” Luna mystically replied with a contented nod before slurping her own drink which bright pink and adorned with two paper parasols. “Apples suit your hair.”
“Well we can’t all be posh and hairless,” Harry shifted uncomfortably, feeling a little embarrassed for his former self under Malfoy’s probable criticisms. After the removal of the horcrux, Harry’s body had enjoyed somewhat of a growth spurt. Along with new height and muscles, had also come a thatch of thick, coarse hair across his chest and down his stomach. Harry supposed Malfoy thought all men should be like Francis Featherhorn, waxed like a Malfoy Manor ballroom floor.
The notches in Malfoy’s spine stood out as he bent over to take off his socks and when he straightened again Harry noticed there was now a sparse golden dusting of hair across his chest and a slightly darker trail below his belly button. Malfoy was all sharp edges, pointed bones and semi translucent skin, yet there was a beauty there too. Harry half expected to see great feathered wings sprout from the knife edge shoulder blades, confirming some aura of the ethereal, the unknown.
“Such as?” Ron prompted as an alarming crunching and squelching sound emanated from the now dimly glowing fish tank.
“How often do you feed the house magic?” Draco frowned. He knelt down to run his fingers across the floorboards but the spells felt stale. This was surprising given that Draco knew Harry was a powerful wizard.
“Oh shut up you,” Draco smiled fondly, “besides we all know what’s going to happen. I’m going to absolutely outshine Granger in general knowledge and his entire bunch of Gryffindors will weep with gratitude.”
“You know what I miss?” Malfoy began as Lisette formed in the kitchen, leaning against a counter and listening attentively. “Holidays,” Malfoy concluded. “Marlene was going on about the villa her and her auror boyfriend have booked in Tuscany this summer.”
“Teddy, I asked you to wait for me you incorrigible brat,” an older woman with grey streaked black hair apparated into view. She was wearing a long green skirt with a white blouse and her face was still the spitting image of Bellatrix’s.
Harry cast another tempus charm, despite him not even having put his wand away from the last one. It was now 17:18. He should have suggested meeting Draco somewhere else, the atrium was far too crowded, especially as it was the end of the working day for most departments.
“That’s what you need,” Magalie sighed as she brought her sock clad feet up underneath her on the sofa.
“Well,” Malfoy cleared his throat, “Father thought it was rather embarrassing, you know, not to be very good at an endeavour. So he told me if I discovered I wasn’t going to be respectable at something then I shouldn’t try it at all.” Malfoy looked a little awkward now as he picked up a jar of polish and dipped in a rag so as to start rubbing circles on the belly of his cauldron. “It was one of the reasons he took away my violin when I ten. He said it was painfully apparent I wasn’t going to excel in anything musical so we should just pretend that the whole thing had never happened.”
“Just in time for lunch,” Ron grinned before his face deflated, “I mean, that was a bit dumb, sorry. He’ll probably be going home to wash and sleep or something. Know I would after nearly a month in the cells.”
“Maybe that’s your key to political change then?” Philippe suggested with an amused raise of a bushy eyebrow, “Reverse psychology.”
“Happy birthday Draco,” Harry said quietly as the room dissolved into giggles and badly sung snatches of French songs.
“What kind of underwear?” Draco continued. “I just want to get the full picture of your undeniable sartorial elegance right in my mind.”
“Yes, it’s been rather hot,” he nodded, “and as lovely as it is, it’s decidedly less comfortable in the Ministry where the cooling charms are as effective as an asthmatic puffskein breathing on you.”
“Complimentary bookmark with every purchase over forty galleons,” the witch announced, pointing to a small display on the edge of the counter. “Which one do you want?”
“Ah fuck,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, “you’re right, I’m sorry, that was totally inappropriate of me. I bloody suck at flirting.”
“I’ve been thinking about taking a holiday,” Harry announced, “somewhere I haven’t been before. I’d like a beach and a pool, maybe one of those coconuts that you can drink out of.” Harry watched as Malfoy carefully sealed the lid back on his Tupperware and cast a freshening spell on his teeth.
“Just do a plait,” Magalie suggested, “and use the apple fragrance spray, it’s less overpowering than the geranium or the lavender. Plus then if anyone comments on it you can say you just ate an apple.”
Draco smiled, feeling very pleased with himself as he followed Harry out onto an overgrown patio. Calling the primitive wilderness outside the back door a ‘garden’ was a bit generous but Draco supposed one could do wonders with a pair of charmed shears and some pent up aggression.
“You kind of…” Draco trailed off in amazement. Maybe he hadn’t been reading too much into things after all.
“Oh god,” Harry groaned as he glanced back up to see memory Malfoy happily chatting away with his apparently imaginary friend.
“Nah, just a late one with some old mates – Michael Corner was there actually, says he saw you lot at the Hairy Gooseberry a while back.”
“Some sort of clerk?” Harry ventured, feeling a little guilty. There were hundreds of people working in the Ministry and other than the big name roles like auror or unspeakable, he hadn’t really ever put much effort into finding out what they all got up to.
Malfoy clutched the marble tightly before quickly drawing out his wand and sending a flurry of tidying charms at his ransacked apartment. Once he was satisfied everything was back to order, Malfoy hurried into the kitchen where on the table was the cupcake he had bought earlier, only now there was a single candle stuck into its purple frosting.
“But by the time I’d reached the Steppe, all of the horned Noboskian Gnomes had gone,” Luna sighed, extracting the paper umbrella from her bright pink cocktail and charming it to spin in circles. “I suppose I should have expected an early migration this year, given the swarm of Callipian Cobshackles that came across the Himalaya.”
That’s not true,” Potter screwed his face up making him look like a teenager again, bar the unshaved mess that Draco supposed could constitute a beard if you were being generous.
“That’s overstating it a touch,” Harry replied grimly, thinking back to broken noses on rickety trains, blood and tears in a cold, damp bathroom, a terrified shake of a head through the swollen eyes of a stinging hex.
By the time Malfoy arrived home it was grey and raining, dirty puddles had formed in pavement dips and there was a muggy condensation on the apartment windows.
“Vain tosser,” Ron shook his head as Malfoy cast a mirror charm and fussed over his hair. Harry noticed the other man rearranging some of the strands at the front to cover the areas that were thinning. It felt like an awkward moment to witness. It was clear that Malfoy put great emphasis on how others viewed him and he would probably hate to be seen in moments of weakness like this.
“Um,” the boy blinked at him, “she’s at lunch? Along with everybody else. I’m an intern though so I have –“
“No,” Ron replied carefully, “you should finish your section on the Streatham report so we can make the department meeting in time.”
“Okay,” Draco agreed, “I’ll go now then, or I’ll be too tired to swim tomorrow and you’ll have to fish my drowned body out of the pool.”
!” Harry bit out, his fingertips slipping on the gnarled wood of the wand but not quite managing to pick it up.
“Mind out of the gutter please Harry,” Draco smirked, “I was simply referring to something other people don’t know about.”
“Fine, I’ll take tea,” Harry replied. The two of them edged forwards, trying to work out the flask’s contents when suddenly the door banged open with a jolt. All three of them flinched violently, Malfoy causing himself to splutter slightly and spill a thick red fluid on his sleeve.
“You’re flirting with me?” Draco wrapped his arms around his chest, feeling a little self conscious. “Why?”
Anyway, a few weeks later, on his birthday, a small silver pot had arrived from Paris, where Narcissa was currently residing.
“Oh my god, Harry,” Ron whispered. Harry looked up to see that Ron was peering down at the remnants of the orange marble that Malfoy had been fiddling with earlier. “I know what this is! George looked into charms like this to see if there was some loophole in the U.K. laws on it.”
Harry couldn’t help himself letting out a surprised laugh. He took a few steps forward again and perched himself on the edge of Malfoy’s desk. “To be fair,” he grinned, “it was only a baby sea serpent, they’re like the size of single bed, and it wasn’t all that aggressive, I think it just had conjunctivitis.”
“He did, did he?” Harry muttered as he looked around and realised that yes, he could spot quite a few fellow aurors, all looking remarkably relaxed and casual out of their usual red uniforms.
“I was on the opposite side to him in a war that happened,” Draco swallowed thickly, the wine suddenly feeling sticky.
“Showcasing your obsession with my girlfriend again Malfoy?” Ed Winshaw appeared with a tray of food and a disgusted look on his face. “Did they let you out already then? I suppose corruption really does run deep. Then again, what do
Harry swallowed thickly as the other man started to lever himself up from the bath, glistening trails of suds sluicing down his slender torso and pale skin. Malfoy’s nipples were small and surprisingly pink, haloed by barely there golden hairs. Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes as he heard Malfoy’s wet feet on the tiles and the sound of a towel being dabbed against soft, damp skin.
Alexandre nodded in greeting to Draco before shrugging and speaking in thickly accented English, “I am not understanding why you would use this approach for a curse without, um, how to say? A core that is concrete?”
“Harry,” Ron sighed, setting down his quill and pinching the bridge of his nose, “I highly doubt Draco thinks you’re ignoring him. Considering you owl him a fresh pastry every morning, have written four apology letters, left a six pack of Diet Pepsi on his desk with instructions on how to revive his dying houseplant and,
Harry tried to make sense of what the other man had said whilst Lisette cocked her head and gestured, thankfully, for Malfoy to explain.
“Sorry mate,” Ron gagged, pressing the back of his freckled hand to his mouth and reaching blindly for his can of ginger ale that was now becoming necessary for their daily assignment.
“Let’s just get this over with,” Harry muttered, taking a step towards the bowl and checking his notes. “Right, we’re going in on the twelfth of May.”
“Well yeah,” Harry gave a small smile, “I kept worrying I hadn’t said the right thing in each one so I’d write a new one and the cycle continued.”
“No good ideas start with the phrase ‘those kinds of people’” Harry replied woodenly, ignoring Ron’s curious look as Pewterfoot promptly dismissed them.
“I’m not trying to set anyone up!” Harry cried exasperatedly, although both he and Ron were chuckling at the absurdity of it all. “I just think that if I’m enjoying his company, surely lots of other people would too?”
“He’s really interested in all this theory stuff actually,” Potter continued, ignorant of Draco’s internal disparagement. “You’d probably get on well with him.”
“Bloody French,” Ron muttered. Despite a lovely annual Burgundy holiday with the Weasleys, in this moment, Harry couldn’t help but agree. Cerisier and Laurent were completely out of order. Harry tried to squash down the niggling feeling that he might not have been so annoyed if the suspect in question wasn’t Draco Malfoy. After all, it had been Harry who had first suspected Malfoy of dark over a decade ago.
month? He was spending plenty of time with Odette, Meri, Matthew, Theresa and Nick, to the point that he had barely even used the charmed marbles.
“That’s different mate,” Ron shot Harry an aggrieved look. “It was just some bloody chocolate eggs with plastic chicks inside charmed to sing Happy Easter.”
“Of course,” Harry agreed, nuzzling at Draco’s cheek and somehow controlling himself to stay perfectly still. Draco could see it was an effort though, Harry’s muscles were quivering and he was breathing hard.
A team of janitorial staff were scurrying to and fro waving their wands and stationing cooling charms at certain pressure points. Draco found himself jostled and nudged in the crowds, slipping slightly so the fingers of his right hand grazed the surface of the fountain in the middle of the space. Draco sighed in slight relief as he found the water to be pleasantly cool. He half considered stripping naked and just diving in the bloody thing, it wasn’t like his reputation could fall any lower at this point.
It was already gone midday when he spotted Harry again, the other man having stripped down to his swim shorts and now dive bombing into the pool, much to the delight of a gaggle of squealing children.
“I’m glad it sounds more heroic than it was,” Harry laughed with a wince as he stood up and gingerly stretched out his muscles. He had probably been working out a little too much recently but one of the perks of working for the Ministry was access to a fully equipped, state of the art gym.
eh? Maybe you should offer to go back to hers and take a closer look at her fern if you know what I mean.”
“It does seem unlikely,” Harry agreed. Ron looked relieved, gulping down the rest of his drink whilst Harry returned to the pensieve and dipped back under.
“Well,” Pewterfoot sighed, “we didn’t have to go far to get them and Laurent and Cerisier saw no reason to wait. But the matter is… sensitive.”
“H-he wanted to shoot it down for a roast,” Malfoy continued, still chuckling hysterically, “but the Captain said it would be terrible luck and instead gave father a bottle of seaweed shampoo.”
“I’m quite certain, Sir,” Harry replied through gritted teeth. The most violent thing he’d seen Malfoy do was gleefully crack the top of his crème brûlée with a teaspoon.
“I heard Bill talking about it at the Burrow, you know Ron’s brother – he’s a Gringott’s curse breaker,” Potter explained as Draco nodded. Typical of course, that a Weasley would hold Draco’s dream job, if this ‘Bill’ was anything like his younger brother Draco had little hope for the world at large.
“Wait!” Harry cried. “Shit, Malfoy – I remember on Tuesday you put a marble in the sugar pot!” He jumped up and rushed over to the shelf, pointing at the antique Wedgwood sugar pot that stood next to Narcissa’s card. “Come on Malfoy, just remember please – it’s right here!”
“Time to go,” Harry muttered to himself, there was no way in hell he could justify staying to watch Malfoy spread a thick creamy gel across his bare buttocks. He drew out his wand and cast the spell just as Malfoy let out another hiss of pain and his bum gave a final jiggle.
“What on Earth are you talking about?” Harry asked, he had never heard of anything like this. “Are you trying to tell me that Malfoy’s girlfriend is the magical equivalent of a blow up doll?”
“Wouldn’t have wanted any other way,” Harry grinned, there was something unsaid in his expression. “Besides, I wouldn’t worry, there’s a big joint party with Neville tomorrow at Ron and Hermione’s house.  I’d like you to come actually.”
It was a scene, funnily enough, from a book that Harry actually recognized. Luna had bought him the Starfall science fiction trilogy for Christmas last year and it had been rather entertaining reading about wizards in space. Harry was a little surprised that Malfoy enjoyed something like that though.
They finally did depart for the Weasley-Granger abode, but only after another cheeky slice of cake. Draco looked up at the pretty Tudor style cottage with painted white between aged black beams. The house was quite long and a little uneven with gabled ends. The flowerbeds at the front were filled with colourful hollyhocks, lavender and delphiniums, a trailing trellis of white roses climbed up to the second floor windows. The porch jutted out with a space to leave wellington boots and a hedgehog shaped shoe brush. There was a curved steel hippogriff hoof shoe hanging above the entranceway, a popular superstition, and the front door was painted a jolly yellow.
“I believe so,” Draco replied, his throat dry as his gaze flickered to the unreadable expression of Andromeda behind him.
“Absolutely not!” Draco protested. “I’ve already drafted my resignation letter for first thing Monday morning and have sent out feelers for a research position in Patagonia.”
Draco never went to the canteen, he supposed he must have done a few times at the beginning. However, nothing quite reminds you that you’re a social pariah like walking through a food hall of a hundred judgmental faces whilst trying to balance an apple and a bowl of minestrone on a flimsy plastic tray.
Harry gave a pleased sounding grunt as he slowed down, working Draco through it. Draco whined as his body became overstimulated, like pins and needles rippling across his skin. Harry began to pull out when Draco grabbed his wrist and made a noise of protest.
“Oh!” Magalie piped up confidently, “Now I understand. So you’ve decided to go meet Harry Potter and his friends after all.”
Harry snorted, “I think you’re right in that there might actually be more chance of me befriending Draco Malfoy before Ginny finally settles down.” He trailed off however as he saw Luna’s frown of confusion.
Ron grinned sheepishly across the room at their boss as the coffee machine let out a series of loud clunks and gurgles before spitting a load of froth in a cup. Harry grimaced as they went to take their seats, metal legs scraping against the flagstone floor.
“Yeah,” Ron sniffed, “that and the word is he buggered up his forms for the Trunkworth Case so they had to let the main suspect walk scott-free. I think Pewterfoot was this close to sacking him.”
“Yes, I thought you might not be best pleased,” Pewterfoot huffed, “but I couldn’t get hold of you could I? Apparently you were sprinting all across the west country whilst I had Cerisier and Laurent breathing down my neck.”
“Wait,” Harry smiled, holding up his hands placatingly, “I didn’t know cuddles were being offered, that changes everything.”
“No, but I’m going to,” Draco replied firmly. “I’m going to help Bill with this new curse they’re trying to crack. Did you know they’ve had to set up a temporary lily pad pond to house all the victims?”
“Bloody hell Malfoy, calm down,” Harry yelped as Malfoy walked straight through him in a bee line for the sofa, which, judging from the state of the cushions had already been searched.
“Hey!” Harry beamed. The other man was wearing faded blue shorts and a salmon pink T-shirt that complimented his skin tone.
Harry moved onto his knees, taking his cock in his hand and jerking himself off as he stared down at Draco adoringly. Draco smiled dazedly back up at him, reaching out to trace Harry’s lips with his fingers. Harry groaned before squeezing his eyes shut and coming over Draco’s chest, some pooling against Draco’s throat.
“I dunno, doesn’t always have to be pastries,” Potter grinned, “I could stretch for a banana sometimes, maybe a salad pot from Pret.”
He fast forwarded the rest of the day until it was the end of work and Malfoy was walking up the steps to the atrium with his briefcase in hand. Ahead of them there was a sudden flash of red and the sound of loud laughter. Harry flinched as Draco suddenly plastered himself against the wall, his briefcase up by his chest as if to shield himself.
“Snallygaster wishbones,” Draco clicked his fingers, remembering Luna’s essay, “you talked about Eierkuchen’s field studies on using the wishbone marrow in regenerative potions. But you didn’t mention Nachtnebel's treatise on how any form of marrow could lead to premature calcination – why not?”
“Hello Magalie,” Harry smiled, he could see Draco watching him out of the corner of his eye. “My name’s Harry. It’s a real pleasure to meet you at last.”
“I took a chance on you, you know!” Picklemarsh huffed. “It’s not like you were exactly qualified for this job.”
Harry watched as a clearly still fuming Malfoy deposited the coins on the till before swiping his bags and securing them within his robes. He turned to glare at the other customers, one of them shrugged nonchalantly at him, “war criminal,” she stated, smirking as Malfoy turned a deeper shade of red.
Draco laughed miserably at himself. “Because I’m not, things are a little different now. There are people who enjoy my company, not just the little Gryffindors you tried to so eagerly set me up with at the pub.”
“Just a pumpkin juice for me please,” Harry nodded, grinning and rolling his eyes at the cajoling from his friends over selecting such a childish beverage. Harry knew there were plenty of other non alcoholic drinks to choose from but there was something about pumpkin juice that made him feel at home.
“You wouldn’t dare!” the knocker gasped indignantly, its brass cheeks swelling up. “Of all the common, tasteless –“
“This kitchen has a seasonal charm on it,” Draco explained, it’s quite common in wizarding houses. Rooms change depending on the time of year. This wall is glitched between summer and winter. I imagine in the winter it probably has spare cabinets and maybe a tapestry but in the summer it should be…” Draco trailed off, sticking his tongue out as he reached around the back of the nearest surface, trying to find the charm trigger. Finally, his fingers closed around a small metal latch which he yanked forcefully.
“Fine, if you’re not going to shut up until I give myself a perfunctory dunk in the pool,” he huffed. “But I need to pop inside first.”
Teddy paused before looking over at Draco, his hair fading from green to brown then back again. “We’re related aren’t we?” he asked bluntly.
“I come here with Luna on Wednesdays,” Harry told Draco as they settled down at a quiet corner table by the window. The flower boxes outside were in glorious bloom, sporting shades of blue and purple.
He sighed as he wandered into his bedroom and began to change into pajamas. At any rate, if Harry had been watching Draco’s memories carefully it would have been made abundantly clear that Draco didn’t know what he was doing in that area. Perhaps it was wishful thinking anyway, Harry was probably this close and teasing with all his friends. Draco finally had Harry Potter’s attention and he didn’t want to cock it up by assuming things.
to say that, it was literally in her charms when he stopped short and remembered Odette wasn’t Magalie, or Lisette, or Philippe. Odette was real, and if she had decided Draco wasn’t worth three knuts then there would have been nothing he could do about it, no resetting spells or legilimency to get her to say exactly what he needed to hear.
During their third pensieve session Ron’s motion sickness got too bad for them to viably continue and they had to withdraw, leaving Malfoy munching on his singular lunch time prune. The reason for the prune, Harry had uncovered from one of Malfoy’s conversations with Magalie was a touch of minor bowel problems after accidentally eating some dairy cheese.
Harry thought this was a little unfair, he and Ron had worked very hard on getting the bottom of the Marshpiddle case and even been hexed by an elderly wizard who thought they were trying to get his prize vegetable award revoked.
Harry wondered how embarrassed Malfoy must have felt in that moment, having a previously shunned family member witnessing such an encounter. Harry groaned, that was just
“No, wait,” Harry shook his head, “I mean just because this is something I really should have waited until we were in private to tell you. Plus, I know Hermione will say I should have given you more time after what happened but then you turned up at my house with a homemade cake and those bloody swimming trunks.”
The title screen of Lilac Close hung in front of them as Malfoy twisted the cap of his orange marble and whispered the incantation.
This time it was Potter’s turn to splutter into his glass, the other man was still wheezing when Luna absently passed him a pink cocktail umbrella as if that would sort him out somehow.
“No point in wearing them if you’re not going to get wet,” Harry shrugged, flicking his hand across the pool’s surface a sending a spray of droplets against Draco’s pale legs. Draco chewed on the inside of his cheek as he glanced around.
“Circe’s tits, I nearly did myself in trying to keep up with Potter during matches and I was actually half decent!” Malfoy pulled a face.
“Should I be expecting your resignation letter Malfoy?” Picklemarsh asked, sitting back in his leather swivel chair, the back of which had been draped with some sort of wooden chiropractor beads.
Harry tasted like orange and mint, probably from the Pimms he had been drinking earlier and his mouth was hot and wet. Draco moaned as he felt the other man’s tongue rub against his, Harry’s fingers were now tangled up in Draco’s hair, caressing the back of his scalp. Draco felt boneless, pretty sure that Harry was keeping them both upright as he tipped his head back and Harry separated their lips only to press damp breathed open mouthed kisses against Draco’s neck.
“You’re an angel Mione,” Memory Harry grinned, pulling his shirt back down and giving her a quick peck on the cheek.
“Well I think it’s lovely you’re spending time with Draco,” Luna declared, stacking their empty pots together and sending them over to the washing area.
“Can I take it this means you like my body?” Harry asked, there was a hint of nerves in his voice which prevented Draco from replying with a characteristic tease.
“No!” Harry burst out laughing, Draco was now looking completely revolted. “Rap as in rap music, like speaking really fast to a beat.”
Harry was a little loathed to admit that he had actually followed last week’s plot line quite closely.
“No, it’s quite alright,” Luna smiled, “I wanted to save it you see, I’m writing my own book and I thought it would be good material.”
Draco was enjoying finally having someone to talk to about quidditch, especially given the fantastic season the Falcons were experiencing. Apparently Matthew had been a Ravenclaw, two years ahead of Draco, whilst Meredith had been a Hufflepuff three years below, albeit known as Malcolm back then.
Draco snorted lightly, “Could have fooled me Potter, you must have sent me five parchments worth of notes since I was exonerated.”
“Anyway,” Ron shook his head, “Sod that for a bag of pixies, you’re coming over here for a barbeque.”
There was something dulled about the outfit though, whilst the individual garments were clearly meticulously cared for, it was obvious that they weren’t new. The trousers were very slightly faded in places and there was a barely visible, but still there, tear in the brocade material of the waistcoat. In fact, the only item of clothing that seemed to be in perfect shape were Malfoy’s polished shoes.
“Oh I don’t know,” Draco sighed, “aren’t you the apple of every witch’s eye at the Ministry? I’ve heard there’s been over a hundred pre-orders on that charity calendar you’re doing.”
Harry’s hand curved over his hip before caressing his arse again. Draco looked down at the boxers Harry was wearing, they were tented and straining with a damp patch.
“But I can’t imagine he’ll react very well,” Hermione looked worried now, “in fact, he might get quite cross with you.”
Draco paused before folding his used napkin up neatly, “I was under the impression that you and the youngest Weasley were no longer an item?” he appeared to be steadfastly avoiding Harry’s eyes.
“Maybe we shall,” Malfoy smirked. Harry glanced across to see that Ron was still staring open mouthed at the interaction. This Malfoy, this at home with his beautiful French girlfriend Malfoy, seemed relaxed and playful in a way that Harry could never have envisaged.
After Marlene’s incessant chattering, Harry had admittedly fast forwarded through a good section of Malfoy’s memory of the working day and had evidently missed the action. He felt a bit guilty, he was after all, meant to be diligently cataloguing Malfoy’s every move. However, it had become blindingly apparent that Malfoy had absolutely no connection to the Dark Ring potion smugglers and the contraband crushed Pixie fingernails he occasionally ordered were actually part of his ongoing experimentation with tattoo removal serum. Harry had witnessed the most recent failed application of the potion as Malfoy’s frustrated tears had dripped off his sharp nose and onto the blurred, but persisting, form of the Dark Mark.
Harry watched as Malfoy carefully peeled back the lid of his pre filled glass so as not to spill any of the contents. There was a plate of sliced uncooked carrots on the coffee table along with a terracotta bowl of homemade hummus. Delicately torn fronds of parsley had been placed on the surface to quite a pleasing effect.
“I think I must put on a stone every time I come here,” Harry laughed affectionately. Andromeda always knew how to lay on a good afternoon spread. Harry had clocked off work early that day on account of wanting to be present for Teddy’s termly parent-teacher floo meetings. After hearing that whilst maintaining decent grades, Teddy had also managed to turn his Potions Professor’s hair into black and white badger stripes, Andromeda had suggested a strong cup of Earl Grey.
Harry shifted on his seat, the potion smuggling business had been established to be operating between the two cities.
“Of course,” Malfoy sighed to the empty room, “Ackley Wendleson was trained as a chaser only to switch to seeker when he signed with the Ballycastle Bats. It’s pretty obvious in the way he plays as well.”
“It’s quiz night,” Draco sighed, “at the Hairy Gooseberry – where is my bloody sock? Why am I trying to put on my shoe without my sock?!”
“You should come see it actually,” Harry blurted out as Malfoy’s eyebrows crept up his forehead. “I’ve been there over ten years now and I still haven’t figured out how the house works. There’s loads of weird nooks and crannies that shift when I’m not looking and an entire hallway which refuses to light up. Plus no one can get the attic curtains open. Hermione’s got theories it’s about pureblood architecture or something?”
“If you’re going to bring me pastries every time someone in this god forsaken place spites me then I’m going to get very fat,” Draco replied bluntly. For some reason this made Potter’s full lips curl up in a sheepish smile.
“Yes, I should imagine he is,” Luna nodded, levitating the jar of sprinkles over to a table where a harassed looking witch was trying to calm down her two bawling toddlers. “I mean you have to agree to have your memories probed don’t you? Why would you ever do that if you’re guilty?”
After having exhausted themselves by looking all round the house, Harry and Draco had ordered take out, which Draco still maintained was sacrilege when you had a kitchen like Harry’s, before they had settled down in the brown living room.
. He must have watched Draco diligently applying re-growth potions every night before bed, measuring the shedding in his little diary that he kept in the bathroom cupboard.
He imagined Malfoy sat on his ratty yellow sofa watching Lilac Close all alone, who would laugh at his ridiculous impressions of Francis Featherhorn? Who would he turn to in exaggerated surprise at the weekly inevitable plot twist?
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, feeling very tired. He could still hear the rustling paper of the animation charm on the wedding invite above his head and wondered how many goals would be scored before it fizzled out.
“I mean, unless, maybe the ferret’s been really insulting to him or something?” Ron suggested. “Perhaps he tried it on with Ed’s girlfriend, what’s her name? Marlene?”
Draco reached out to smooth away the frown with his thumb when Harry’s eyes cracked open, blurry and green.
“The mind boggles,” Draco smiled, his grey eyes meeting Harry’s. Harry fumbled with his spoon, Draco was looking so much healthier than he had been upon his release. There was a glow to his skin and his cheeks seemed less sunken. “So,” Draco cleared his throat and put his hands together, “I believe I was promised an exclusive tell all interview with the great Harry Potter?”
“You could at least try to smarten yourself up a bit,” Winshaw hissed across at Malfoy, whose hands were rigidly gripping the sides of the desk. “Wash your shirt occasionally yeah?” Winshaw chuckled, pointing to a tomato stain that Malfoy had evidently missed on his left sleeve. Winshaw left a moment later to join his girlfriend as Malfoy let out a strangled exhale before scrambling to use his wand on the offending stain.
One of Draco’s many administrative responsibilities was proof reading and logging auror reports. Draco hated that job most of all. He would pore over the reports, most of which read like they had been penned by a five year old. Yet he would still find himself turning green with envy at the exciting exploits they detailed.
“Oh please,” Malfoy scoffed, returning back to the sofa carrying a wizarding chess set. “Picklemarsh doesn’t listen to a word I say. In fact, if people knew a suggestion had come from me they would probably go out of their way to do the exact opposite!”
Malfoy stared at the card for a moment, the very corner of his mouth twitching up slightly before he nodded and pocketed it.
“You alright?” Harry whispered to Draco, nudging his shoulder as they made their way through the house. Another thing Draco knew he preferred about Grimmauld Place was its potential for windows. Older buildings like this one always suffered a little from being a touch dark inside during the summer months.
“No,” Draco held out his hand whilst wiping his eyes with the other. “I can die happy now, now I know what Harry Potter sounds like when he’s taking a dump.”
“No, it’s nothing,” Harry split apart his custard cream as Andromeda rolled her eyes. She had always said Harry was as bad as toddler when it came to table manners. “I’ve just, I mean, I’ve run into Draco Malfoy a few times recently,” Harry winced as he tried to word it in a way that wouldn’t reveal too many confidential case details.
Draco could have hugged Hermione, as she took that moment to start up a loud conversation about governmental funding, distracting the rest of the table whilst Draco attempted to subtly sniff himself, maybe he had used too much of the tonic after all?
Harry had already noticed thankfully that Penny’s partner, Ed Winshaw, wasn’t present at the barbeque. He wondered if Ron had neglected to invite the other man after seeing him being such an arsehole to Malfoy in his memories? Probably not though, Harry couldn’t imagine Ron being that indignant on Malfoy’s behalf, perhaps Ed had already buggered off on his Italian holiday with Marlene.
happened, after you came in Draco got all mortified and then refused to be alone with me for the rest of the afternoon.”
“Regardless, it was decided that the two of you would have a better chance of recognizing any out of place behaviour. Also, having been at school together, you will be familiar with the suspect’s magical signature, so it will be easier to tell if there have been any memory alterations,” Pewterfoot nodded, making it clear the matter had already been decided.
“They’re quite short,” Draco said quietly, refusing to look at Harry or acknowledge the blush that was probably clouding his milk white chest. “I can assure you they were considered the fashion on the continent but I know in England now people tend to wear such items down to their knees like they’re going skateboarding or something.”
“Bugger,” Ron said after casting a tempus, “we need to get a wiggle on, you know Pewterfoot hates latecomers.”
who she was talking to? Malfoy however, seemed strangely content with her response and instead walked over to a corner desk, partially hidden from view by a large, leaning filing cabinet.
“Magalie’s?” Harry cocked his head quizzically, “she always sings along with her in the kitche…” Harry trailed off as his face drained of colour. Draco felt as if someone had dumped a cauldron of ice water over his head. Pure, unadulterated horror was filtering through his veins and there was a panicked ringing in his ears.
“I, um, I wasn’t necessarily, I just thought it might be nice to finger you whilst I jerked you off?” Harry raised his eyebrows.
Harry leaned closer into Hermione and lowered his voice as the others began to chat amongst themselves. “You don’t think I’ve messed it up do you?”
“Yes, thank you Ron,” Hermione sighed, tuning in to their discussion, “I think the whole pub knows what you mean and quite frankly it’s insulting and a very dated way of talking about the relationship between a -”
“Well it’s a slippery slope until your forties now,” Draco announced, licking his finger before turning over a page.
“Oh fuck,” Harry exclaimed, recognizing exactly what was happening. He wrenched open his robes again with enough force to send his wand spinning through the air before it clattered noisily across the floorboards. “
“Would really love it if you stopped insinuating I’m an alcoholic with the mental age of a five year old,” Harry grumbled.
“Yeah,” Harry nodded enthusiastically, “Hermione’s working on a weather charm so there’s going to lots of settled snow and Molly’s already banging on about winter foliage centrepieces, I never knew there were so many types of variegated holly. Mind you, Luna keeps telling us holly’s infested with jumping nargles, which apparently are
“How did he lose his shirt?” Malfoy asked, a little suspicious. Harry couldn’t help but agree, he was sure that when Francis Featherhorn had entered the water he had been wearing at least three layers.
“Yeah?” Draco asked lamely, looking down and fidgeting with the buttons of the tight dark blue shirt he had on. It was silk, hand stitched from Milan and accentuated the slenderness of his waist without serving to make him look emaciated. He had also dragged out a pair of jeans that he had acquired a few summers ago. He had, upon Lisette and Magalie’s urges, decided he would reinvent himself as a confident young gay wizard who could get away with skin tight jeans and going into a bar alone.
“Oh!” Malfoy whimpered before whispering a spell that Harry couldn’t quite hear. What it did became evident a moment later, however, when Malfoy’s fingers turned wet and glistening. Malfoy grunted before rolling onto his side, facing Harry and swapping his hands. Harry could no longer see what Malfoy was doing with his arse but he had a pretty good idea as the other man’s mouth formed a perfect ‘O’ and his eyes flickered open, glazed over with blown pupils.
Malfoy, for all his cold pointy-ness, was not exactly unattractive. His face still bore the hallmarks of aristocracy, albeit now without the unpleasant sneer. His hair, although thin and wispy was a rather ethereal colouring that suited his pale skin. Whilst Harry had done his best to always fast forward through the changing of clothes he couldn’t help but appreciate the other man’s slender waist and long legs. Sure, Malfoy wasn’t the type of looker that would get double takes on the street, but there was still something about him that made Harry want to keep looking.
“Ron and I think the potions smuggling is just a side operation,” Harry told Pewterfoot, “a way of funding a faction of the Twisted Gnosis.”
Harry always made a point to eat as much as possible before coming into Malfoy’s memories, considering how many mouth watering dishes the other man seemed to cook up on a regular basis. He tried to remember what
Draco smiled softly, there was something about Harry Potter’s sheer bloody mindedness, his absolute surety that made one want to trust him. It was easy to see how the other man had become the leader of an army at only eighteen.  Why his gaggle of friends were so incredibly loyal they were practically family.
“That some sort of stock cube?” Ron asked as Draco took a small orange marble like object out of a cupboard and murmured an incantation.
Harry burst out laughing as the vision of a horrified Lucius Malfoy with bird poop dribbling down his pristine blond locks flashed across his eyes.
Harry shook his head, embarrassed by his own thoughts. He was going stir crazy, spending every working moment in these memories. He needed to get out and remember what it felt like to live his own life for a change.
“Actually Sir,” Draco stared down at the Gringotts contract in front of him, each page penned in perfectly neat Goblin script and stamped with a magical seal that glimmered from gold to silver to bronze and back again. “I’d like to see you in your office.”
Instead, Draco got to do data entry, the expensive green feathered quill he had especially treated himself to five Christmases ago went woefully underused. The most recent auror report that Draco had been made to translate into comprehensible English had been written by the golden boy himself – Harry Potter.
Draco had made it as far as the end of the street before scurrying home and deciding it would be far safer to stay in with Magalie and watch Lilac Close.
“You brought me a cinnamon swirl?” Draco asked suspiciously, his fingers already having moved of their own accord and taken the pastry before settling it on top of the desk in front of him.
“But you said the food was good?” Harry ventured, not sure what else he could offer on this topic of conversation, having very little idea what either a Noboskian Gnome or a Callipian Cobshackle was.
“I need more wine,” Draco sighed, reaching across everybody to nab the bottle, table manners be damned.
“It makes no sense!” Draco half shrieked, managing to spray himself in the eye with his apple tonic and blinking gingerly.
Harry eyed the assortment of takeout menus critically. Kreacher was never up for cooking anything other than a rather watery spag bol and Harry always felt too exhausted by the end of the working day to attempt to wrangle his semi sentient kitchen. He knew that wizarding houses had personalities of their own, but really, the kitchen was extraordinarily stubborn.
There was a loud whoosh as the brick wall in front of them dissolved into large French patio doors, gleaming glass in white wood frames. The doors folded back as bright sunshine bathed the kitchen and a gust of sweet smelling fresh air swept in from the outside.
“Oh Harry, I’m sorry, it’s just you look like we’re back in school and Hagrid told us that flobberworms have IQs of 203.”
“Bugger,” Pewterfoot huffed, “there goes another angelfish.” He shook his head before redirecting his attention towards Harry and Ron. “Well, for one, the suspect’s mother currently resides in Paris.”
Draco rolled his eyes as he summoned the sugar pot and then brought the two steaming mugs over to the table.  Harry took a sip of his, smacking his lips in contentment before frowning at a spherical object sat beside a small pile of newspapers.
“Malfoy’s up to his old tricks?” Ron asked, cocking his head to one side. “Even after you went and bloody defended him at the trials!”
Harry trembled as he withdrew his wand from under the bed along with a few cobwebs. He cast the fast forwarding spell just as Malfoy reached for his own wand to murmur a cleaning charm.
“Do you have any idea why a harmonising fern might turn yellow?” Harry asked, taking a sip of his beer.
Draco opened his mouth to ask Potter what his obsession was with this damned pub quiz? Maybe there was going to a be a section on pureblood customs or something and so Potter needed Malfoy for the team. As soon as Draco began dismissing this as utter nonsense he realised that Potter had already fled the bookshop, leaving the faint smell of bergamot in the air. Had
The legal offices also appeared to be deserted, was there some great skiving off work conspiracy that Draco didn’t know about? Was he destined to be the only sodding fool in the entire place to
“Chocolate hobnob?” Andromeda asked as she shuffled back into the parlour with an overburdened tea tray.
“Bloody hell,” Harry laughed, “one moment you’re giving me a hard time for not having any hobbies and now you’re –“
“Apart from my house elf Kreacher,” Harry explained, “Hermione and Ron were always saying I should sell it and go somewhere smaller and cosier, but…it’s a link  you know?” he glanced at Draco who was looking pensive. Harry remembered how much history and family heirlooms meant to the other man. The way he treasured the few items he had in his modern muggle flat, so far removed from where he had grown up.
“You!” Draco shouted, causing the boy to inhale his snack before coughing violently. “I’m looking for Odette Seaver,” Draco continued, unperturbed as the boy coughed and glared at him. “I need help with these damn Italian forms and she –“ Draco rooted around in his pocket before drawing out the embossed business card, “she gave me her card!” Draco wasn’t particularly sure why he needed to add that last detail, for all this miniature cretin knew, Draco and Odette could be life long friends.
“Are you the one that reads all my reports?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrows. “If I’d known I would have tried to spice them up a little.”
“She’s not real,” Ron replied, looking up at Harry with a shocked expression, “I think she’s a charm.”
“Draco!” she cried exuberantly. “I think you’ve caught the sun, your nose is – oh!” she noticed Harry and blinked at him.
by Grigori Yefimovich Ras – wait, that’s in the wrong section,” Malfoy tutted before withdrawing the book and placing it on the shelf behind him. He turned back to the Potions sections before letting out a pleased ‘A-ha!”.
“Don’t remind me,” Harry huffed. “My mouth tasted like frogspawn for weeks no matter what toothpaste I used.”
“Fishcake went down the wrong way,” Draco croaked. “Is there a reason why you’re de-robing in the middle of the living room?”
“I always wanted to be…” Malfoy stopped and cleared his throat as he took the first move, pushing one of his pieces two spaces forward.
There were about eight more questions on seemingly random topics before the quiz moved on to the sports section which Ron, Draco, Dean and Harry eagerly shouted the answers to.
“Maybe you should,” Harry suggested, glancing over at Draco with an unreadable expression. Harry’s gold rimmed glasses were slipping slightly down his nose and Draco’s fingers itched to reach out and push them back up. “I think it’s probably time don’t you? I see Andromeda fortnightly for afternoon tea and Teddy’ll be back from Hogwarts for the summer soon, maybe you could join me at some point?”
“Because,” Luna began as one of her pink umbrellas twirled across to Draco and landed in his Pimms. “I attended a selection of snallygaster dissections, humane of course, along with the Baltimore Institute of Creature Research, and we concluded that snallygaster marrow in the area that Eierkuchen was investigating, contains trace elements of black sand.”
The absence of natural sunlight in the basement was already making Harry’s skin feel sallow and shrunken. He wondered if it felt more like home to Malfoy? Having spent most of his school life in the Slytherin common rooms below the lake.
“Was he?” Harry frowned, thinking back to the sneering eleven year old whose handshake he had refused on the first day, his memories jumped forwards to a polished school shoe crunching down on his nose in an empty train carriage. “Yeah, I’m not so sure about that Luna.”
Over the last year there had been a resurgence of illegal potions operations with many contraband elixirs smuggled between London and Paris. Harry and Ron were the lead aurors for the British side of things but so far, despite several undercover operations, had come up short on any hard evidence, aside from bringing in a low level dealer a week previous. The French aurors assigned to the case, Cerisier and Laurent had arrived a couple of days later and yet had already dropped a number of not too subtle criticisms about the DMLE’s handling of the operation.
A moment later, however, Malfoy got tangled up in his own trousers, hopping and lurching once across the room before tumbling down onto his backside.
“I reckon you would have liked being a curse breaker,” Harry murmured absently, watching as Draco massaged his temples. The other man’s skin was so white it almost looked fragile, with blue veins visible at the surface. It was like he was made of fine bone china. Aunt Petunia had inherited a set of teacups once, the sides so thin that even precious Dudley wasn’t allowed to use them. Instead, they gathered dust on a display cabinet shelf.
“Draco,” Harry’s voice sounded wrecked as he pulled back to gaze up at Draco with dark eyes, pupils blown so wide that black nearly eclipsed the green. “I want to touch you, may I?”
Harry blinked rapidly a few times before sitting up a little straighter in the chair. Malfoy thought he had muscles? I mean sure, Harry was quite proud of his physique nowadays and Hugo and Rose thought it was funny to hang off his biceps like some sort of jungle gym but the fact that
magic,” Draco interjected witheringly as Harry grinned. He knew the other man was only doing it to wind him up.
Harry thought a little guiltily of the large patch of untended wilderness that lurked out the back door of Grimmauld Place. He wasn’t sure that the forest of nettles had seen a pair of shears in the last half a century. Sirius had certainly never fussed over his begonias or potting compost.
It was a relatively crowded Saturday in Diagon Alley, the Christmas decorations hadn’t gone up yet, that wouldn’t happen until December but Harry was looking forward to when they did.
“Getting off track Ron!” Harry snapped. “My point is I just wanted Draco to feel like we were on equal footing a bit more. Like I thought if he saw me accidentally dropping my glasses in the loo or spending half an hour trying to make my beard even it might help.”
Right now though, Draco was running on humidity sodden frustration and he powered walked up and down the rows with grim determination, looking for Odette. The other woman perhaps not might be thrilled that the stranger she had run into weeks ago in a lift was now going to accost her lunch regarding Italian bureaucracy but Draco was mindful of the sheer amount of work he had to get through today. He just couldn’t afford give Picklemarsh any excuse to fire him and Draco was sure the fetid old fart was searching for one like niffler on a gold hunt.
Over the last thirteen years he’d had little call to interact with the slender, blond ex Slytherin. He knew Malfoy worked on one of the lower levels as he occasionally had to deal with requests for more information regarding improperly filled out auror reports. Malfoy had always managed to infuse his abruptly concise messages with as much distain as possible.
Draco waited until the owl had flown off before ambling over to the window and jerking it open. No matter what he did, the wood of the sash always stuck, unless it was left open in the evening by mistake and then it would wait until you were suitably relaxed, drifting off into sleep before it would slam down with a vengeance.
“Wait,” Potter said quickly, taking a step after him and causing Draco to pause curiously. “I, um, your hair looks nice today.”
“Not bloody likely,” Ron snorted, “my patties are always singed to perfection, nah the blighter’s oozing from his armpits as we speak. He accidentally let it slip to Angelina on Sunday evening.”
The history section was up next and it became a quickfire round to see who could get to the answer first between Draco and Hermione. Every time Draco managed it he inclined his head slightly towards Harry to catch the other man’s impressed expression.
nemesis,” Draco amended as Odette still rolled her eyes, “suddenly had front row seats to every minutiae of your life.”
“Marlene,” Draco nodded coldly. Harry smiled as the blond threaded their fingers together and Marlene’s eyes followed the movement, widening when she realised the other hand belonged to Harry Potter.
“Oh no,” Magalie sighed as she fizzled into place in the living room and took one look at Draco. “Oh, mon chéri, I’m so sorry.”
“Oh my god!” Harry exclaimed rushing forwards, “I’ve always hated how there were no windows in here – look, it leads straight on onto the garden!”
Harry shivered involuntarily. After the war, there had been plenty of nut jobs attempting one dark ritual or another in order to try and bring Voldemort back. He knew it was impossible but still, the idea that anyone would even
“I’m not really…” Harry began but Luna clapped her hands together loudly as if she had just been struck by a brilliant idea.
Harry chewed on his lip whilst nodding. Ron was right in one respect, they had done this plenty of times and whilst the violating nature of the new memory laws were always being criticized in the papers they had also saved a lot of innocent people from being wrongly convicted. Harry wondered if Malfoy would be one of them.
“Yes, I think he may have gathered that information from rather questionable sources,” Hermione sighed, “but my point is you’ve seemed a little down for a while now, I honestly think Ron was just trying to help. You know how he has to be proactive about these things.”
“Huh,” Ron stated, squinting at Harry’s chin, “I think you’ve just made it more pointy to be brutally honest.”
“Any more burning questions?” Harry asked as they made their way up the north side of Diagon Alley towards the park.
“Plus,” Malfoy clearly wasn’t finished and seemed to be on a gleeful roll as Lisette nodded dutifully along, “you’d think with all his money that Potty could at least afford a uniform that actually fit!”
By the time Draco got back to his office there was a Ministry pygmy owl sitting on his desk. Draco unrolled the parchment.
“Draco – is everything alright?” Harry asked, peering around to seemingly ascertain whether Draco was being chased by a crazed axe murderer or something.
Potter laughed. Not a forced, this is social interaction etiquette laughter, but a real chuckle, as if they engaged in this sort of banter all the time.
“Thank you for being with him to cook dinner,” Harry continued, “to watch Lilac Close. Thank you for complimenting him, for listening to him like he should be listened to. Thank you for singing with him, those old French songs that I now can’t get out of my head,” Harry laughed. “Thank you for being his friend when he needed you.”
“Since when does Grimmauld Place have a garden?” Ron asked. Harry guess it was a fair enough question. Harry had only discovered the large expanse himself after the war when he had gotten tired of searching for the back door key and simply blasted it open to find he had been transported to Jumanji, although there were a few more disgruntled hedgehogs than stampeding elephants.
“Draco,” Lisette began with a look of bemused consternation, “you can’t even keep a harmonising fern alive.”
“I’ve seen him sleeping with that thing,” Ron’s eyes widened, “sometimes if you walk past his cupboard you can hear really weird rubbery sounds –“
“Good,” Draco nodded, pushing all thoughts of the ridiculousness of the situation to the back of his mind. “Because there’s sticky toffee pudding for dessert and the cream in the fridge needs using up.”
“Oh leave off Ed, right I want you to come look at that villa I mentioned, it’s Tuscany or Turkey I reckon and we need to decide which,” Marlene scolded lightly, tottering over to her desk in high heels and magicking up some images of holiday destinations on a hovering screen.
“No,” Malfoy replied, his voice quiet as if not to disturb the other passengers. “I ordered it online from Tom de Plume, it’s a Tom Thursby original. You can get the calamus personalized for your grip style and select the density of afterfeather, I chose a thinner rachis because although you have to redo the self inking charm more often I find it’s nicer to have more weight at the tip if you’re going to be…” Malfoy trailed off, his face reddening as he realised his voice had gained in excited volume and everyone was now staring curiously at him.
Harry looked like he wanted to say something back when the door burst open and a very frazzle looking Hermione jumped into his arms. “Happy birthday Harry!” she shouted before a young looking boy with strawberry blonde hair appeared and attached himself to her leg, staring shyly up at Harry and Draco.
Harry nodded politely to the passing witches and wizards, some of whom greeted him by name. He had already said hello to Arthur Weasley who had informed Harry that he was very much looking forward to the big upcoming party at Ron and Hermione’s.
“Oh baby boy, look at you,” Magalie tutted, reaching out and trailing her fingers softly through Draco’s hair. He normally kept it in a small ponytail, but more often than not the shorter strands would fall free and frame his angular face. “You’ve been overworking yourself again haven’t you?”
It had been a custom order this time, three different colours for three different people. It had made the purchase more expensive but Draco was good with money, only splashing out when he wanted a treat. He glanced down at the key:
Draco arrived at the steps of Grimmauld Place ten minutes early. He already regretted not casting an enlargement charm on the trunks he had on under his shorts, they were from when he was younger and a certain Harry Potter had been sending him fewer pastries.
“I’d heard he was dating someone in the Ministry,” Harry scratched his chin, watching as Winshaw noticed Malfoy in the corner.
“It’s beautiful isn’t it?” Harry grinned, sliding his gaze to Draco. “You can see why no one ever wants to come hang out at my place now right?”
“Nah,” Harry replied, shoving a forkful of coffee cake into his mouth and groaning happily. “It doesn’t really start until eleven but I was going to get there early to help set up, but then,
“What?” Matthew threw up his hands with a guilty smile, “This is what we do on Wednesdays, we compare notes on whose colleagues are the most incompetent and the winner gets their share of the lunch bill covered.”
Harry jerked back to where Penny was cocking her head at him with a small smile. “I asked, if you could pass me the ketchup?”
“You’re hopeless,” Odette sighed, “do you want a dairy free rocky road or a millionaires shortbread? I’m popping back up to the till to get something sweet.”
“Sup Harry?” Neville smiled cheerfully. After school, Neville had spent some time abroad penning a variety of well received research papers on South American aquatic Herbology before taking up the teaching position at Hogwarts when Sprout retired.
“Oh!” Potter’s face lit up like his team had just won the Quidditch world cup. Maybe he was a huge fan of that particular restaurant? Although Draco had a hard time imagining Potter seeking out small French bistros in his spare time. “Okay, maybe another day!”
Potter looked nice too, not that that was particularly surprising. The other man was wearing an obnoxiously red T-shirt with faded denims and what were once presumably white trainers. Only somehow the whole outfit just seemed to compliment Potter’s aesthetic, with his hairbrush allergic bird’s nest, unshaven facial hair and milk coffee coloured skin.
“I’m going now,” Draco announced in a shaking voice, turning on his heel and making a beeline for the exit. He stormed straight past the woman posing a question about the Bloodied Barnacle Ghost Ship mutiny of 1809, through the main body of the pub and out onto Pottleshot Lane.
“Where the bloody hell –“ Harry muttered, hissing as he trod on an upturned rake and recognizing it as one of the
“I,” Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, “I mean maybe, sure, we’ll probably run into each other at the Ministry some time.”
“Picklemarsh wants the Munich report on his desk by four pm,” Marlene informed him with a placid smile. Draco pulled a face before huffing.
Draco tuned the boy out as he looked round in surprise. He supposed the time of day did somewhat explain the mass exodus from the offices. Draco turned to stalk back out of the offices, catching a murmured ‘rude’ from somewhere behind him as he left.
“Yeah,” Harry chewed on the inside of his cheek, “I think he’ll be quite upset if he finds out it was me in there though”
“You’d know all about worms,” Draco muttered as Marlene strutted away. He pulled out his wand to vanish his perspiration before casting a tempus, one minute past nine and he already had a tension headache.
’ which Harry promptly did, letting out a laugh as the broom folded open into a silhouette cut out scene of a quidditch pitch complete with charmed bludgers flying through hoops.
Draco found himself upside down in a medley of disorientating bubbles before strong arms closed around his waist and hauled him upwards. Draco gasped as he and Harry breached the water’s surface and emerged back into the sunshine and general noises of the party.
“A cruel and just punishment,” Hermione mused. “I’m sorry if he’s rather put you on the spot by inviting Penny Solomon but I think he’s under the impression that –“
“Oh I see,” Luna pursed her lips thoughtfully before beginning to pick out each blue sprinkle individually and depositing it on Harry’s ice cream. “That makes sense, you always did listen to him very carefully.”
“And this is a catastrophe how?” Magalie asked, pointing to Draco’s missing sock on the back of the rocking chair.
“Oh!” Harry piped up, settling down on the coffee table. “You’ve lost your marbles?” He laughed before realizing that Malfoy had actually started shaking, his hands still firmly pressed against his face.
“Cerisier and Laurent are clutching at straws,” Ron groaned during the meeting in Pewterfoot’s office. Harry nodded in agreement, he could think of a few choice French insults he had learned from Magalie that he wouldn’t mind employing right about now.
“I can…” Harry asked questioningly, his eyes were narrowed assessingly and he was staring at Draco in a way that made the other man want to hide back under the duvet.
Draco froze somewhere between the A’s section of the bookshelf he was perusing, what in Merlin’s name was Potter going on about now? If he was angling for something it was still too nubilous for Draco to make out.
He sighed before putting the card away and reaching for the small pile of concerned letters he had found from his mother waiting in the mailbox. Incarcerated for an entire bloody month or thereabouts and the Ministry hadn’t even thought to let Draco’s only remaining close family know that he was okay.
“If Mr. Malfoy surrendered his memories, and they, along with his statement on Veritaserum match up with his proclaimed innocence then it will be enough to stop the Bureau des Aurors sequestering him back to Paris.” Pewterfoot explained.
,” Ron exclaimed, exasperated. “Does he just subsist on the fumes of his own self importance or something? I hardly think the Ministry would fall apart if he went and had a bloody taco.”
“Anything you want,” Harry laughed, “honestly I’ve suspected for some time now that there might be colony of doxies up there so I just keep the door shut.”
“The charm is stuck,” Draco murmured, reaching out to hover his palm a few centimetres away from the bricks.
Ron rolled his eyes dramatically, “You’d think the woman would have had enough of her children’s weddings by now, but nooo, apparently because it’s her only girl it’s
“I agree with you Hermione,” Harry sighed. “You know I do, but it might be the only way to clear him of suspicion and he gave up the memories voluntarily.”
Luna had never really bought into the typical boarding school habit of calling people by their surnames. Harry prodded at the blue sprinkles, whose dye was now melting in with his green pistachio scoop.
“You know it’s rude to leave in the middle of a conversation,” Harry huffed, trailing after the other man. He knew Malfoy’s weekend morning routine pretty well by now but instead of going into the kitchen for breakfast first thing like usual, Malfoy headed straight to the living room window where he had installed a post collection box. Harry had one of the devices too, the inherent charms unlocked when owls approached and allowed them to deposit their mail whilst a treat was dispensed.
“That Francis Featherhorn, what a dreamboat am I right?” Magalie sighed happily. “I don’t know why they’re thinking of having him take that job offer in Switzerland, I mean if he goes then where’s the eye candy? Johnathon Turnbell? I don’t think so.”
“Weasley’s burgers better be impeccable,” Draco muttered as he grabbed his wand from the nearby table and pulled his T-shirt back on.
“Oh is that what that was?” Draco had a twinkle in his eye as he shucked off his gardening gloves. “I assumed Kreacher had brought another date home.”
“Yeah,” Ron grinned, “It’ll be great, the weather forecast says it’ll be sunny all day from ten and I figured I’d round up a good crowd of people and I’ve already put in an order for a shi-“ he stopped abruptly and put his hands over his son’s ears, lowering his voice, “a
“Draco,” Odette smiled, “do you think maybe that’s overreacting? I mean call me selfish, but I’m quite enjoying your company and Patagonia’s a little far for you to still make Sunday brunch.”
“Tosser,” Harry grinned, “um to be honest, just baggy boxers, last night’s were grey with a hole in the left leg.”
“Well you better get on that then,” he replied, trying to focus on the document in front of him from the Ministère des Affaires Magiques. “Seeing as I only deal with the French and Italian liason offices.”
Harry snapped his eyes up at a strange sound. Draco was hunched over, wisps of blond hair covering his expression but his shoulders were shaking.
be. He supposed he had always figured the other man would have wanted to be a businessman of some sort, or perhaps work in finance or as a minister. If the War hadn’t happened of course.
“I reckon it was payback, for that artifacts deal that went wrong last week,” Ron nodded. “Anyway, Pewterfoot wants to see us.”
After the table cheered for more cocktails on account of it still being hot and sunny, Draco cleared his throat to regain Hermione and Luna’s attention before realizing with a pleased flush that he had never actually lost it.
The Ministry canteen was split into two different areas, the first was where you picked up your food, waiting in line with a tray. There were only a few seating tables in this area and they were mainly reserved for department heads and visitors. The next room along was a large space with long metal tables and benches in a setup that was vaguely similar to Hogwarts but with much more utilitarian décor. There were also the odd large round tables with flatpackable chairs that tended to get usurped by the more ‘cliquey’ of departments, such as the aurors or the Ministry’s curse breaker faculty.
“Oh I don’t give a fudge about political change,” Malfoy sighed as he set up the pawns on the chequered board, flicking one of knights on the head as the horse tried to bite his fingertip. “Not really. Politics was more my father’s game and look where that got him.”
“She thought I should take Malfoy as my plus one,” Harry snorted before realizing the room had gone silent.
“If I’d only known that spending a couple of weeks in the ferret’s head would finally tucker you out,” Ron snorted.
had been doing at this precise moment only weeks ago. Being a Friday night, Harry supposed it would have been a pub evening along with the usual crowd.
“Why would you want to ask me about it?” Draco continued. “I’m not a trained curse breaker, I file things for a living.”
It was almost ironic, seeing as how in the holding cells, bored out of his mind, Draco had actually taken to pretending that Magalie, Philippe and Lisette were in there with him. After his release, however, he felt so embarrassed by this seeming indicator of insanity that he just couldn’t stomach any more imaginary conversations.
“Excuse me?” Hermione put her hands on her hips. “Harry what exactly have you been teaching my children?”
“Another round anyone?” Dean asked loudly, jumping up and clapping Neville on the back whilst the other man stared forlornly at the sodden parasol in his Guinness.
“I’ll have you know these are very expensive silk from Paris,” Draco informed him, slapping at Harry’s meaty fingers that were threatening to tear the fabric.
“There,” Harry nodded as the recognizable frame of Draco Malfoy eventually emerged last from the elevator in front of them. It was the first time in over a decade that Harry had really had a chance to get a good look at the other man.
“Excuse me?” Malfoy frowned at the other man, looking round as if to check that Winshaw really was addressing him.
“You mean you’re worried all the biscuits will be gone,” Harry said dryly as he stood up all the same and followed Ron out of the office.
Harry sighed and tipped his head back against the tiled wall, the grout of which had turned black in places.
“It’s good your stomach’s feeling better,” Harry commented as he watched Malfoy open up his lunchbox, which was lacking the usual prune addition. “You know you really should try eating in the canteen some day, they’ve got a good selection for different food allergies and intolerances. Actually they do a wicked slice of gluten free apple pie.”
“Well,” Ron coughed after a few moments loaded pause. “I guess it’s a little meaty? But that’s a good thing right? Mione’s always complaining that my rear’s a bit like a pancake see?”
“I wouldn’t have asked if I wasn’t,” Draco said tartly. “There are some pajamas you can enlarge in the bottom drawer and a spare toothbrush in the bathroom cabinet, I don’t want to share my bed with someone whose breath smells like ketchup and bean burger.”
“Don’t forget to stop by Paula’s Pestles to pick up a cushioning charm for that one brain cell of yours!” Malfoy screamed down the street as a woman with children shot him a dirty look and steered sharply out of the way. “Must be painful to have it rattling about alone in such a big empty space!”
“Ah, I reckon most lads wanted to be an auror growing up didn’t they?” Matthew looked around the table at the blank responding faces.
“Oh for heaven’s sakes Harry, bugger off and go find him,” Hermione snapped, causing everyone in the circle to stare at her wide eyed.
His desk was exactly how Draco had left it, thank heavens for small mercies as he was very particular about the way things were organized and catalogued. He was just checking his inbox tray when Marlene’s face appeared round the filing cabinet that separated his space from the rest of them.
“Harry,” Harry supplied, still looking determined. Somewhere from behind them a grandfather clock struck midnight. Draco would have to be getting home soon he supposed, but his body didn’t want to cooperate with him.
of December and would take place at Samuel’s family home in Herefordshire. Harry grinned as he noticed that his plus one option had been vigorously underlined in red ink. He guessed that was Ginny’s doing, cheeky mare.
“Yes,” Draco agreed thoughtfully with Magalie, the less ammo he gave Potter’s friends to tease him with, the better. Not that he was necessarily expecting mocking, I mean it was Potter after all who had made a point to say that they were all adults now. Draco stopped for a moment to mull over whether Potter had said that as a warning to
“Potter,” Draco snapped, causing the other man to jump in surprise and blink at him owlishly. “Are you suggesting that I should let you leer at my arse because it’s your
Harry watched as a couple of other aurors gathered around them listening to Ron’s exaggerated tale of a highly aggressive bull that Dankworth had hit with a stinging hex. Memory Harry’s hair was sopping wet and slicked back from the downpour outside and he had taken off his glasses to clean them with his sodden white shirt.
You could fit twenty spice racks in Harry’s kitchen if you wanted, not that Harry would know what to do with them. Salt and pepper were about his limit unfortunately.
“True Loaf or Bernadette’s Buns?” Harry asked absently, he rather favoured the latter himself due to their cinnamon swirls that weren’t too dry and had a thick wedge of cinnamon butter in the centre. He grinned as Malfoy made his way to Bernadette’s, the golden bell above the door tinkling happily to announce a customer. Malfoy perused the dairy free section with the same studied care that he had taken in the bookshops, Harry huffed a laugh as the other man’s face lit up in delight upon evidently finding what he wanted.
“I suppose I could come see your ridiculously neglected house,” Draco sighed wearily, if only to visit your bathroom and witness where the musical magic happens.”
“Cheers,” Harry grinned, “I reckon it’ll be alright. Luna tells me I’m the sort of ‘handsome’ that will get better with age.”
“See?” Harry turned back to Malfoy who was still looking a little stunned. “Great things happen when you don’t hide behind your briefcase all the time.”
Harry gulped, his words caught in his throat as he was confronted with the reflection of Malfoy’s naked arse cheeks. They were small and pert, a ghostly white in colour and the left one jiggled as Malfoy poked and prodded it before summoning a healing lotion.
“Everyone buys potion ingredients,” Harry interjected, well apart from him, he was crap at potions and tended to buy them ready bottled.
Draco glared at Malene before taking another pointed bite of the pastry, licking the icing from his lip. Marlene pulled a disgusted face before turning to stride back over to her side of the office. On her way, however, a furious looking eagle owl sped past her ear, causing Marlene to let out an almighty screech and careen into the nearest filing cabinet.
“No idea,” Ron shrugged, “but obviously with Boot being the one to catch them, half the Ministry knew by Monday and apparently Marlene punched Winshaw in the middle of the main atrium!”
The strange thing was, that the odd little run ins with Potter kept happening, even at the weekend. Draco had never before encountered Potter whilst out and about in wizarding London and yet now here he was again, standing in front of Draco in Banbury Cheese bookshop with a dopey smile on his face.
Harry accidentally inhaled a large sip of his pumpkin juice and spent the next two minutes being aggressively hit on the back by a wheezing Ron.
Draco still couldn’t remember her. He had felt uncomfortably nervous at first, wondering if she might recognize him from the Carrow’s reign of terror but Meredith, or Meri as she preferred, had simply commiserated with him on having had Binns as a history professor.
The fact that some smug face aurors had been privy to Draco’s memories was bad enough. He tried to catalogue every potentially shameful or embarrassing thing he had done over the time period in question. He wondered how far the investigation confidentiality would actually stretch for an ex death eater dancing around the kitchen in his underpants whilst his imaginary friend belted out the lyrics to
“Teddy,” Harry cleared his throat to catch the young man’s attention from bickering with his grandmother. “I’d like to introduce you to Draco Malfoy.”
“And you live there alone?” Draco enquired, waving a meandering wasp away from them as they walked through the park gates.
“Quidditch and the weather, right,” Draco nodded decisively, although he somewhat remembered Weasley supporting the Canons at school and after Sunday had seen the absolute demolishing of them by the Falcons, anything Draco said now could be taken as insult. “The weather it is,” Draco muttered before turning round to Magalie and grimacing. “I’m going now so I have to end your charm, I’m sorry I know there’s still fifty minutes left.”
“True,” Pewterfoot nodded, “but the establishments Mr. Malfoy frequents are known for some under the table dealings, Asphodel Fields in particular we’ve had to ring up a few times on illegal procurement practices.” Pewterfoot shuffled through some notes on his desk, reading a list of bullet points. “We have also established that Malfoy receives monthly owls from Paris.”
“I wasn’t doing anything in the memories,” Harry muttered, “they were just me at home, getting takeout and spilling it down myself, arguing with Kreacher about throwing away that toilet plunger he’s so attached to –“
“Stop being rude and cuddle me,” Harry ordered, stretching out his arm to allow Draco to shimmy over and nestle against his chest whilst still continuing to read.
“The pub,” Potter grinned, “The Hairy Gooseberry on Pottleshot Lane, we’ll be there from six pm but the quiz starts at around seven.”
Harry took a deep breath, wondering if anyone would notice if he hurled a pair of cheeky hedge shears, the ends of the handles decked out in red stilettos, at his ‘previously’ best friend’s back.
? Perhaps he thought Draco might show up and start poking fun at Weasley’s ineptitude or god forbid, Granger’s blood status. Well if Potter thought that lowly of Draco then why on Earth was he inviting him to the pub?
“By the way,” Penny was licking the sauce from her fingertips as Harry looked around for a napkin. “Do you know why one of your friends called Neville was telling me to use Pepsi on my fern earlier?”
“Draco!” Harry said, jumping up as the other man walked cautiously towards him. Draco was wearing his periwinkle blue waistcoat, his robes tucked over his arm. Draco’s hair was in an uncharacteristically messy bun, as if he had untied it at some point during the day before gathering it back up with a plain black ribbon.
However, it didn’t look like Draco was going to be showing up anyway. Maybe Draco had already left early so as to avoid Harry? Perhaps he hadn’t even come into work today and there was a pile of uneaten pastries sat on a basement desk somewhere.
Despite the seizing of the family’s assets, Malfoy had seemingly managed to hang onto a few treasured heirlooms and antiques. These items he would bring out every so often to show to Philippe or Lisette and excitedly tell them of its provenance and the magic within. Harry thought of all the artifacts in Grimmauld Place that he had unceremoniously bundled into the attic before sealing the door.
“Draco!” Harry had obviously followed him. Draco caught the other man’s pleading expression as he raised his wand and apparated away.
Both Harry and Lisette raised their eyebrows at this declaration. Malfoy huffed as he turned over the scrubbing brush to the coarser side, its previous white colour now a muddied layer of grime. “I mean think about it, fresh potion ingredients are absolutely exorbitant and that’s if I can even get the buggers to sell to me. Plus, the mail order ones where I can use a different name always arrive wilted and bruised.”
He stumbled about trying to undo his shoelaces whilst stretching across and snatching impatiently at the package. It smelled like lavender and marzipan as Draco finally snagged it with long, bony fingers and went to settle on the sofa. Draco emptied the contents onto the pale yellow couch cover and studied them.
“That…might be even stranger,” Draco concluded, although he looked a little less like he was reconsidering occupying the same space as Harry ever again. “What on Earth do you rap about?”
Harry turned in the direction Lisette was pointing to see the common wizarding houseplant in a very sad state. The leaf of each frond was meant to emit a different note and were one to brush past a healthy specimen it would emit a lovely sounding harmony. Malfoy’s plant, however, had turned an alarming shade of yellow.
“You again?” drawled the brass knocker. “I heard from the guttering that you’re actually a Black so I suppose I should apologise for my previous manner.” The cast metal face rearranged itself into a pained looking expression that Draco supposed was mean to be contrite.
Draco apparated home before allowing himself to ask the question that had been on the tip of his tongue. Was Harry trying to be
Harry supposed maybe Narcissa and Malfoy were meant to meet today. Being a modern, muggle flat, there was no fireplace at Malfoy’s residence, meaning he had to walk to the communal floo point a few streets over in the mornings. This also meant that Harry had never seen any of Malfoy’s friends or family making a floo call like Ron, Hermione, Luna and Neville so often did to Harry. Although, perhaps the only person who would have floo called Malfoy would have been Narcissa, given the notable absence of other social engagements and the use of the Pop Up Pals Harry had concluded that Malfoy’s real life friends had somewhat left the picture.
As was usual of Saturdays, Malfoy had taken a trip to the quieter northern end of Diagon. Whilst everyone knew the infamous alleyway that marked the start of wizarding London, there were in fact many other streets and squares branching off of it, along with a few, small but really rather pleasant parks.
“I mean,” Harry made a noise of embarrassment, “I live alone, so I don’t really care how I’m dressed.”
“Alright, here we go,” Dean Thomas clapped his hands together eagerly, “there’s fifty galleons in the pot tonight lads, split between the nine of us that’s about five galleons and nine sickles each, not too shabby eh?”
“Excuse me?” Draco scrunched up his nose in confusion, it made him look slightly adorable. “What exactly are you wrapping? I certainly hope you don’t wrap birthday gifts up on the loo – that’s disgustingly unhygienic Harry.”
“I’ve always been fascinated by the theory of rapid calcination precluding true distillation in restorative draughts,” Hermione added thoughtfully.
“Don’t look at me like that Mione,” Ron gestured to his wife, “you don’t know how good you’ve got it at St. Mungo’s. I’m telling you Nev, I was in there on Thursday and it was like the inside of a refrigerator.”
Draco hauled himself out of bed before traipsing groggily to the kitchen, making sure to accio a hangover potion on the way. The potion served to rid him of the painful percussion section that had taken up residence behind Draco’s eyeballs.
“I’ve got a garden,” Potter added pointedly, looking a little shifty as if he was admitting to Draco that he liked to moonlight as a cabaret dancer at weekends. “I,” Potter cleared his throat, running his fingers up and down the gathered condensation of his glass, Draco tracked the movement. “It’s quite a big one, but I never go out there, I mean I want to. I think, I think it would look nice with some roses in it.”
Draco had to agree, the actor was completely his type, a good muscular figure, darker skin and unruly black hair.
Draco tried not to obviously look too smug as he reached for another piece of crusty bread. “Not to mention that I spent most of today trying to rework auror reports that wouldn’t even win a participation star in Kindergarten.”
Harry settled down into the large blue armchair whilst Malfoy was nestled on the sofa. It was a Friday night in the memories and apparently that meant wine and another episode of a terrible wizarding soap opera.
“Go on,” Potter grinned, “It’s only two syllables, I’m sure someone brilliant at ‘smart stuff’ could manage it.”
“So you’re here to propose are you?” Draco smirked, leaning against the doorway and folding his arms across his chest. “I can assure you Potter I won’t settle for anything less than four carats.”
“Oh fuck,” Harry hissed as his gaze fell on Malfoy. The other man had shucked his pajama bottoms off and unbuttoned his shirt, perhaps he had never even done it up in the first place. His pale skin was faintly illuminated by the candlelight and bathed in a sheen of sweat, suggesting he had been at this a while. Malfoy’s face was red and scrunched up, his lower lip caught between his teeth and his eyes pressed firmly closed. The curve of the other man’s spine was arched up off the duvet and his knees were spread apart, fallen open so wide that his thighs were quivering with the stretch.
“Oh, you should have seen the auror brigade today!” Malfoy announced, drawing Harry out of his reverie. “Stampeding down the corridor like a punnet of caffeinated strawberries.”
“I know it was you,” Harry snapped, glaring at Winshaw, “you’re the one that gave the witness report about Draco. You realise if I reported it to Pewterfoot it would go on your record that you wasted departmental time and resources, distracting attention from solving an important case?”
he would put some pizzazz into that report. He would probably use a few extended metaphors to really ham it up, maybe a sprinkling of harmless hyperbole.
“What the fuck?!” Ron screeched as Draco felt around for a moment before his fingers landed on a small jar of dried herbs.
“Then he would have confirmed that you do indeed have bowel movements like 99.9% of the rest of the population,” Odette frowned. “Plus, you know aurors can execute fast forwarding spells in those Pensieve Probes, it’s not like they sit around whilst you clip your toenails.”
“What’s up?” Harry questioned, walking forwards to stand beside the other man who jerked up frantically to pull open a utensils drawer, rummaging through the odds and ends stored within.
“No, wait, please,” Harry reached out to lightly touch Draco’s hand, lowering his wand again. “I have something I want to say.”
Draco shifted and looked round the table as he realised that he might have potentially just sounded a little rude. Thankfully, only Potter and Hermione seemed to be listening in on the exchange.
“Absolutely fine,” Draco replied, careful not to let his voice come out too high pitched. He still hadn’t removed his fingers from Harry’s chest, in fact they seemed to be moving of their own accord, gently feeling across the skin there.
“Still wears glasses,” Malfoy hiccoughed, tipping a generous portion of the wine he was drinking into the stew. “But they’re wire framed now and they’re always slipping down that stupid nose of his.”
“Ah, would this be something to do with why I didn’t hear from you for weeks after giving you my card?” she questioned, passing Draco her slices of boiled egg. “You know we can still sue the department right? For profiling you and discrimination.”
“Right,” Ron nodded, every ounce of confusion he was feeling clearly etched across his face. Ron had never been able to mask his thoughts very well, it was one of the reasons Harry tended to lead point in interrogations.
“We’ve had an anonymous tip,” Pewterfoot continued, “identifying one of the ring by name. The suspect in question is sitting in custody right now.”
“If you must know, I need to adjust my swimshorts,” Draco explained stiffly, “I haven’t worn them since my last holiday with mother to the French Riviera and that was many years ago. They’re a little…tight.”
“Alright!” Picklemarsh’s voice boomed out as he stormed out from his own office, “What in Merlin’s name is going on with all these non Ministry owls, Malfoy if you’re conducting personal business during work hours I’ll –“
“Right,” Draco cleared his throat.  “Well I suppose it’s for the best we’ve established you didn’t mean it.”
“Yes,” Draco replied, sliding his eyes towards Harry carefully, “I assume you had nothing to do with it?”
, who he hadn’t talked to in thirteen years, had noticed was rather surprising, perhaps a little flattering?
“Mon chéri,” the woman sighed, pouting as perched herself on top of the kitchen table. There was now a glass of red wine in her hands that Harry hadn’t noticed either of them pouring. “Was today truly awful? You look exhausted.”
“God damn it!” Pewterfoot muttered before noticing them. “Oh fantastic – Weasley, where the hell did you get those brilliant pellets from last time? It turns out they’re the only things Nautilus will eat without throwing an ink fit!”
“First question!” the witch announced before Draco could question Potter’s green fingered intentions. “Who won the Quidditch World Cup in ’79?”
“You’ve always wanted to be a curse breaker,” Philippe nodded, his eyes twinkling, it reminded Draco vaguely of Potter but he tried to shake those thoughts away.
know what all the strange runes etched into the chimney meant? Hermione had given it a go but said she couldn’t locate enough relevant historical texts. Would Malfoy have blustered and protested when Harry tore down the practically ancient Siberian Silk Spider curtains because he couldn’t figure out how to get the dust out of them? It irked Harry a little, he had worked hard for his life, lost loved ones and made terrible sacrifices to now have all these things that perhaps the man sitting in front of him might actually be able to appreciate in a way Harry couldn’t?
“Course she does,” Ron snorted, “Ten years of marriage mean I’ve learned not to make rookie mistakes. Actually, she’s inviting some her friends from Mungo’s too, do you remember Silvia and Momoko? Nice couple, moved over from the States a few years back.”
The meeting was predictably dull, a few reprimands regarding late reports and a couple of other issues were addressed. At the end Pewterfoot dismissed everyone with a reminder that there was a visitor from the U.S. Auror Division the following months and he wanted everything looking shipshape.
Draco seemed to be thinking for a few moments. “What’s your house like? You’ve spent nearly a month inside my flat but I don’t even know where you live.”
“I um, I didn’t see it actually,” Harry scratched the back of his head, “I just heard Malfoy mention it.”
“Oh fuck you!” Harry laughed, lurching forwards to dunk Draco’s head under the water and roaring with laughter as the other man came back up spluttering and thrashing.
Harry tucked his wand back into his robes before looking around. The room was lacking the usual faint purple haze, only a single candle hovering over in the corner of the room. Harry blinked a few times to accustom himself to the darkness. It was surprising Malfoy had fallen asleep already, he normally stayed up for at least another hour reading.
“Perfectly well,” Draco replied, slightly breathless, trying to angle his hips away from Harry. However it was too late as the other man’s face morphed into a knowing smirk and he raised a bushy eyebrow.
“You’re an angel,” Draco smiled gratefully, knowing he had seen the damn thing somewhere, it was lucky Magalie was partially linked to him through legilimency. Speaking of which, he really didn’t have time to explain the whole back story right now so instead he located his wand before casting another charm.
“When I was fourteen we spent a fortnight in Japan, travelling around Kansai,” Malfoy continued, “but what was even more exciting the year after was the cruise that mother insisted we go on round Cape Horn. An al…” Malfoy appeared to be finding it difficult to finish his sentence, his face crumpled up in giggles, “An a-albatross shat on father’s head!”
“I have literally no idea what you are saying,” Harry replied blankly, “but if you can do something that helps me change my living room from the dodgy brown colour it currently is, I will be forever in your debt.”
“How did you pass Potions, Potter?” Draco huffed. “The sand would need to be prebonded with the marrow which is impossible to do post mortem.”
A moment later Ron let out a loud shout announcing that the first round of burgers and hotdogs were ready and the crowd shuffled forwards.
That was when Draco had stopped cold and realised, he had never truly had any friends. And the chances of making any now were laughable. The closest he had was Marlene who worked in the office next to him and was dating Auror Winshaw. Marlene didn’t actively seem to detest Draco to the same extent as his other colleagues.
“Oh I’d say a solid eleven,” Draco beamed before pausing outside of Fortescue’s. “Despite what I said, I think we’ve actually got a little time before we need to leave you know.”
Harry exhaled through his nose in amusement, thinking of how the memory they had just come from had spent an hour at five am in Malfoy’s bathroom whilst he organized all his skincare potions by alphabetical primary ingredients.
“H-how…” Draco flicked his eyes to where the rest of the table had mostly fallen silent. Ron was grimacing at Harry whilst Hermione was anxiously biting her lip. “It was you,” Draco said, the words coming unbidden. “You were the aurors assigned to my case, you, oh
“He’s,” Harry began before sighing, not quite sure how to sum up what he had seen over the last week. Malfoy was so achingly similar to the boy he had known at school in some ways and yet in others it was like a totally different person.
“Maybe,” Harry said shiftily, acting like he wasn’t quite sure if he should smile or not. “Those trunks are a little tight, especially when wet.”
He was furious at everything and everyone, Marlene for being such a cow, her smug auror boyfriend for probably reporting Draco to the aurors in the first place, the nameless aurors who had watched his memories and now had a horrible power over Draco, like some humiliation sword of Damocles hovering over the molten puddle of his dignity, which like everything else had turned to mush in this godforsake heat. Furthermore, Draco was now being forced to wear his clothes like some sort of wandering minstrel, perhaps he should just transfigure his briefcase into a lute and bloody well have at it!
Harry was pretty sure Malfoy would have chosen the Dementor’s Kiss over Harry Potter being privy to such information.
Harry found himself smiling, stirring his remaining puddle of ice cream with the mini wooden spoon. “He’s funny and he’s still very clever too, actually,” Harry grinned, “he’s got one of your books.”
“Just pray that Pewterfoot doesn’t give him the Datchet case,” Harry grumbled as the department head finally made an entrance.
“Yeah,” Harry cleared his throat, “mine’s definitely not like that. It’s pretty clear he’s innocent.”
“I’d watch yourself if I were you Boot,” Ed Winshaw stated with an innocent smile, coming up behind them. “Apparently Malfoy’s a
“Too bad they can’t drag Galespawn out of retirement for the upcoming match against the Magpies,” Draco stage whispered to Harry, thoroughly enjoying himself, “I reckon if the Canons charmed his zimmerframe to fly they might actually stand a better chance than they do right now.”
“Yup,” Harry nodded, wondering if he could borrow one of George’s themed shovels to dig himself further into this hole. “Penny…Penelope Clearwater!”
Draco stopped himself from rolling his own eyes, Potter looked so shocked to see him, the git probably hadn’t even realised that Draco still worked for the Ministry.
“I was thinking of planting some wailing wisteria,” Harry informed her, “it’s a great potions substitute for Bitter Root you know,” Harry realised he was just regurgitating what Malfoy had said.
“Peasant!” he growled at her before charging out of the shop. Harry jogged to keep up with Malfoy as he stormed angrily down the street before taking a sharp left. Harry watched as the other man leant up against the back wall of Fortescue’s, hidden from the main alley.
Ron shuddered, that had apparently happened to two other aurors who were no longer speaking to each other.
Harry’s large hand snaked round to grab Draco’s arse cheek, pinching into the flesh. His thumb grazed the hem of Draco’s trousers, dipping just below the fabric and stroking the skin. Draco leaned forwards to allow Harry better access, pressing the other man’s face against his chest and panting into the crown of his head.
Malfoy paused before quickly scratching out the phrase ‘in later life’. Harry wondered if the other man was afraid of unintentionally offending his mother.
“’Little peck’ eh?” Harry smirked, staring hard at Draco until the other man blushed. “I don’t know what kind of kisses you’re used to but I think that was pretty racy.”
“Then again,” Malfoy sniffed, “he could probably have demanded to become headmaster and she would have passed the keys to the castle to him quicker than you can say ‘meritocracy’.”
“Just to talk,” Harry quickly reassured him. “I feel weird about how we left things earlier. I don’t want to think I scared you off by kissing you.”
“You’re amazing!” Harry cried happily, reaching out to drag Draco into a brief but tight hug. Draco gasped as Harry drew away, hurrying off to inspect a patch of venomous tentacula that was sprouting from a stone planter.
“Of course not,” Harry shook his head enthusiastically, “I haven’t even spoken to Bill since the pub, if he’s hiring you Draco it’s because he thinks you’re brilliant.” Harry grinned as he saw Draco’s cheeks flush, the other man seemed to be trying to contain a smile.
Ron was right, any alcohol left in your system had been shown to have quite a nasty effect when combined with memory vials and there had been cases of wizards and witches drowning in their own pensieves whilst intoxicated.
“I’ll feed you in a moment Nautilus,” Pewterfoot muttered, waving his hand at the depressed looking cephalopod.
“I’m starting to understand why Comet haven’t put you in a customer facing position,” Odette scoffed.
“I,” Draco paused, he was indeed looking for Birdwhistle’s new tome on the role of isopsephy in curse creation. “How do you know about that? I would have thought the last book you read was at school.”
“Oh wow,” Harry groaned, smacking his hand against his face, “I think I must have sunstroke or something.”
“Exactly,” Harry nodded solemnly, trying not to smile. “Look, just take a breather, accio some of our late reports and get on with them whilst I go back in there.”
“Want me to take them off?” Harry asked, noticing the other man’s attention. Draco nodded as Harry grinned and shucked himself out of the bottoms. Harry’s cock jutted proudly upwards from a thatch of black hair, it was thick and beautiful with heavy balls and a shiny tip. Harry’s slit gaped as Draco stared transfixed at it, a glob of precome pearling on the bulging head before running down Harry’s veined shaft.
“You know what, never mind,” Ron shouted, “vegan is healthy!” and he spun on his heels before making a hasty exit.
“Change of plan,” Draco stated, summoning a book from over in the corner and dimming the lights until only the candle on the wall above the bed was still flickering. “I’m going to read for a little bit. Did you want to borrow a book or something?”
“Thank god for that spell,” Ron chuckled, “do you remember the last probe we had to do? The suspect got food poisoning on the third night. I’ve never cast so quickly in my life.”
“Nah, I’m fine thanks,” Harry replied, resting back against the headboard as the clock struck midnight. He figured that that might have been his favourite birthday so far.
“I did not,” Harry protested before staring down at his dessert. “You know if you don’t like the blue ones you could just vanish them?”
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, pushing open the door, “think I’m just a bit tired. I was wondering if I should put in for some leave after this case. I’ve got quite a bit stored up.”
Draco’s body still tingled in the places where Harry had touched and he had to step back inside the kitchen to try to cool himself down.
“Is it from Ink Wellingtons?” the woman questioned, “Only I don’t think I’ve seen one like that in there before.”
“You,” Draco sighed as Harry stood in the doorway. “You really are something else Harry Potter.” He laughed wetly before tipping his forehead against his knees. “I’m going to get rid of those bloody marbles first thing tomorrow morning.”
put out by having to wait for an extra thirty seconds for the floo. “One of the new flavours is fig.”
“Something good I hope,” Harry replied. “It’s a pool party, do you have swimming trunks? I can transfigure some of mine to your size if not.”
“Absolutely not!” Draco protested but the damage had been done and his new found friends were already giggling and elbowing each other.
Hermione laughed and elbowed Harry’s arm. “No, you big tit. Stop acting all defensive, we don’t care if you never shack up with anyone. It was more you’ve just seemed a bit aimless recently. I mean you work so hard but what do you really do for yourself outside of work?”
“Tomato soup!” Ron grinned triumphantly as Malfoy swore under his breath before aiming various spells at the offending stain.
“Sounds great,” Harry beamed. Out of all of Ginny’s boyfriends he had always liked Samuel the most. The other man was a physical therapist for professional quidditch players and had a calm and quiet demeanour. “I actually did find out about it before I saw the invite though – Luna told me.”
“If the Dark Ring’s doing deals with Rome as well as London then we should get Boot and Robson involved,” Ron added. Harry knew that Terry Boot had been undercover for a while in order to crack the Bianchi case but there were still members of the operation that they hadn’t been able to pin anything on.
“Why? You not hungry?” Draco replied meekly. Magalie must have sensed the necessary emotional cues from the legilimency bond and immediately swept across the room with a beaming grin.
Harry and Ron strolled in as Auror Winshaw smiled in welcome, raising up a cup of what smelled blessedly like coffee.
“I have six Newts with Outstanding, I took a dual advanced translation certificate in both French and Italian, I attended workshops on fili-“
Harry groaned and slumped back in his chair, “I didn’t want to send him anything too weird because that’s kind of like unsolicited dick pics.”
“I,” Potter began before licking his lips, Draco tracked the movement and for one crazed moment wondered if he should offer Potter some of his homemade lip balm. “Were you looking for me?” Potter asked.
“I’m sorry you have to deal with that shit,” Harry stated miserably as he sat beside the other man, watching a nearby couple sharing a picnic on a tartan blanket. “He probably isn’t very happy in his own life and wants to lash out at someone.” Harry stopped as he realised that Malfoy wasn’t very happy in his life either and had yet to verbally attack someone unprovoked on the street.
“It’s just plain incompetence, that’s what it is!” Picklemarsh bellowed, a bobble head figurine of a quidditch player from the seventies started to nod voraciously in agreement on his desk.
“Oh I don’t mind the blue ones,” Luna smiled serenely, “they all taste the same actually. But tell me more, was this recently you talked to Draco?”
Harry wondered if that was because it was the only thing you could usually see from under the robes.
“Narcissa?” Andromeda questioned with a surprised look. “No, never. Last I heard she was living in France.”
Harry frowned as he realised that here was Malfoy, desperate to go out and see the world but unable to do so whilst Harry, with his enormous Gringott’s account barely took a day off work. In fact, the last trip for ‘fun’ that Harry had taken had been accompanying Teddy to an Appleby Arrows away game. Harry wasn’t even sure why he didn’t bother to travel anywhere unless it was for work. It wasn’t that he was particularly a homebody, in fact he really only saw Grimmauld Place as a place to eat sleep and occasionally bring people back to.
“Fuck, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” Harry mumbled, averting his eyes and hurrying over to the bed, underneath which he had finally spotted his wand. Harry made a noise of hysterical frustration as he leaned against the side of the mattress in order to try and extend his arm underneath the small gap. His face was only inches away from Malfoy’s. The other man was letting out rhythmic whimpers now in time with the thrusts of the arm half hidden behind his back.
“BON ANNIVERSAIRE DRACO!” Magalie’s voice sung loudly through the kitchen as she appeared beside them.
“Oh poor Draco!” Magalie exclaimed, laughing. “I suppose we shall have rhubarb crumble for dessert as well?”
“It’s already started!” Magalie exclaimed, pointing to the Magiscreen where Featherhorn now seemed to be involved in some form of fisticuffs with a mean looking wizard brandishing a gardening hoe. “Draco, how could you let me miss the beginning?” She pouted prettily at Malfoy who looked relieved and shrugged with a rueful smile.
Harry gasped as he recollected a memory from Second Year. Hannah Abbot had brought her French horn to breakfast in order to show her friends that she had mastered Au claire de la lune. The performance had been a little wobbly but the assembled Hufflepuffs had clapped all the same. Harry remembered that Malfoy had sneered and said something about how useless playing an instrument was and couldn’t Hannah have devoted her time to attempting a passable grade in Potions? At the time, Harry had been fuming, trying to hold Neville back from slapping the condescending smirk off of the platinum blond’s face.
Harry thought of Malfoy’s kitchen, it was probably an sixth of the size of Harry’s but for some reason it always felt warm. Charmed white wax candles gave it a homely glow whilst the fridge was covered in dragon themed magnets that held down grocery lists. Harry hadn’t been able to imagine Malfoy sitting down to write a shopping list until he had witnessed the other man hunched over with his quill and cross referencing a recipe book for the exact kind of mushrooms he required.
“I haven’t got that syndrome,” Harry sighed resignedly. “He’s just different now. I…I quite like him.”
Draco tutted and pushed the other man’s fingers away before sitting up, effectively depositing an amused looking Harry on his lap before he began tugged at Harry’s shirt, indicating he wanted it gone.
as seeker. Can you imagine if a mal-coordinated jellyfish like Ashford had actually had to face a competent seeker like Potter?”
Malfoy’s kitchen was also full to the brim of different pots, pans and stirring instruments, including an uncharacteristically adorable egg timer that Harry gathered Narcissa had sent over from Paris. It was in the shape of a chicken and when the time was up it would start singing the song ‘Alouette, Gentille Alouette’ and flapping its wings until you tapped it on the beak.
“Bloody hell,” Harry muttered, shifting on the chair and instinctively reaching down to rearrange the crotch of his trousers.
“Are you asking for my approval Potter?” Draco peered over at the proffered pastry. “Yes, looks edible to me, good pastry to icing ratio.”
Draco nodded as Harry looked relieved, inching slowly out of Draco. Draco gasped, he felt so strange and empty but Harry quickly filled him up again with one of his fingers, it was just the right size to allay the ache without being too much.
“Ah,” Draco nodded in understanding, “Le fait est que, comme je m'efforcerai de vous l'expliquer en Francais…”
“It’s a lovely day isn’t it?” Penny stated valiantly as Harry stood there with all the social graces of a kumquat.
Draco nodded to himself and fished out an orange marble, rolling it carefully around in his fingers before whispering “
“Right!” Harry agreed. “I thought it must be something like that. I tried to repaint the living room last spring and by the next morning it had all peeled off in great swathes.”
“Don’t worry so much,” Magalie reassured him dutifully, “just stick to neutral topics like qudditch or the weather.”
“Oh wow, this is weird,” Harry murmured as he followed Draco and looked around at the familiar space full of pots, pans and dried herbs.
“It’s been two weeks Ron,” Harry tapped his fingers on his desk, loud enough to cause the vein in Ron’s left temple to bulge out like it sometimes did.
“Get all the girls running for the hills more like,” Draco retorted. He stretched happily out on Harry’s sofa, which, like a lot of the furniture in Grimmauld Place, was dark green and a darn sight more comfortable than Draco’s yellow one from the budget section of IKEA.
“But why didn’t you put all that in your essay?” Draco asked Luna. “It would certainly clear a lot of criticisms up. I mean, not that I was criticizing your work, I mean…”
Harry jerked his head up to see a rather irate looking Ed Winshaw stood in front of Malfoy, his arm was linked around Malfoy’s coworker Marlene.
“Don’t be absurd,” Draco employed his poshest intonation. “If I was seen publicly digging into a bowl full of Iceberg my entire legacy would be ruined.”
Harry chanced looking up to see that Hermione was now sat very straight on the sofa, pursing her lips whilst Ron’s face had contorted somewhere between concern and horror.
“This ‘stuff’,” Draco repeated witheringly, hoping he was conveying to Potter quite how unimpressed he was.
Every other Wednesday after work, Harry made time to catch up with Luna when she was in the country. He was glad that they had agreed early on to do so because he wasn’t always the best at reaching out and he always tremendously enjoyed himself when he was with her.
“That’s not your fault ‘Mione,” Ron scrunched up his face, “he was bloody awful to you at school, the things he used to say.”
“Oh mate,” Ron’s face turned somber, “please don’t tell me you’ll be inviting the ferret to the next barbeque.”
Harry was about to comment on how Malfoy might even get Hermione for his healer when the other man stood up, shaking off the offending trousers. He hobbled over to the mirror before peeling down the back of his boxers so as to inspect the already purpling bruise.
“That was distinctly unpleasant,” Harry agreed, pulling a face at the memory, although it had resulted in a rather nifty conviction for illegal artifact theft.
They had all had a little bit too much wine with their lunch but it had served to infuse Draco with a pleasant buzz as he snorted at a joke that Matthew was telling. Odette’s friends were an odd assortment of people that seemed to share the same sharp wit and distain of unnecessary paperwork. Matthew didn’t actually even work at the Ministry but had a job at Comet Brooms in the aerodynamic design department.
Draco stared at Harry thoughtfully for a moment before reaching over to pick up the marble, twisting the top off and murmuring the incantation.
“He just bloody told you it wasn’t his job,” Harry snapped, pushing himself away from the wall where he had been leaning and bearing down on Picklemarsh. Both of the men from the memory, however, predictably ignored him.
The latter was a criminal organization of European witches and wizards who were comprised of cult like political beliefs. In fact, only a week ago the Twisted Gnosis had been blamed for the robbery of a selection of dark artifacts from the wizarding wing of the Louvre. Two months before that, a cursed goblet had gone missing from the Uffizi in Florence, although the connection had only become apparent after the Parisian heist. The goblet and a necklace from the Louvre shared a provenance, having once been in the collection of a notoriously dark alchemist from the sixteenth century. An alchemist whose works were the founding manifesto for the Twisted Gnosis.
“Oh no!” Harry gasped. “That’s not what I meant – Ginny and I haven’t been together since school, Merlin no, she’s getting married to a bloke called Samuel in December.”
“Merlin,” Draco gasped, this was far more exciting than all those saucy encounters he would read about in Witch Weekly. Harry appeared to be intent on devouring Draco whole, sucking and nipping at his skin whilst he used his other hand to press into the curve of Draco’s lower back, nudging them even closer.
Draco gave him a withering look before reaching out his long fingers and pinching them around Harry’s bicep before pulling them both into the floo.
Draco groaned, “Merlin nothing’s changed in thirteen years has it? At seventeen it was me crying in a bathroom talking to a ghost because a madman expected me to fix a cabinet and at thirty-one it was me crying in a bathroom talking to a charm because my hair serum isn’t working.”
Harry clenched his jaw as Ron shot him a warning look, Pewterfoot could come in at any moment now and seeing as the French had mostly taken over the Dark Ring case in order to track down the Bianchi family, Ron and Harry, along with most of the department had been trying to angle for lead on the Datchet decapitations.
“Well,” Ron put up his finger and grinned at his sister, “on account of my delicate constitution, we’ve decided it’s best that Harry does the memory dives whilst I get on with reports.”
“Merlin, I miss holidays,” Malfoy murmured, scooping out the contents of a stock pots into a saucepan of simmering water. “When I was younger we never missed a ski season, used to reserve a joint chalet in Courcheval with the Goyles,” Malfoy let out a barking laugh. “You should have seen Goyle on skis, Circe’s tits it was like someone had strapped oiled planks to a mal-coordinated troll.”
“Potter, we haven’t spoken in a decade,” Draco affected his best apathetic drawl, “for what godforsaken reason would I be looking for
Harry rolled his eyes and tried to remember that he actually loved this man. “Yes, you’re right, insufferable but right.”
There were three designs, one evidently meant for children as it depicted an animated cackling Babbity Rabbity who swiftly dissolved into the shape of a rabbit and hopped about the piece of card. The second bookmark showed a Georgian era gaggle of women, blushing and hiding behind their fans whilst a rather dashing looking man waved his wand about. Malfoy’s lips quirked a little at that one but he picked up the third design as his final choice.
Potter was probably constantly inundated with social engagements, if you were to sit down and probe Potter’s memories, Draco imagined it would be a whirlwind of dinner parties, games nights, exotic holidays, probably even a plethora of candlelit dinners with the never ceasing line of admirers.
“It’s, what?” Harry frowned before realization dawned across his features. “Oh no – this is just a cinnamon swirl, you know – to eat.”
“Does he?” Luna laughed delightedly, shoveling up a large spoonful of dripping butterscotch. “I suppose he was always very concerned with what you thought of him.”
“Too much legilimency!” Draco squawked, firing his wand at her again before slumping against the bedroom wall to recuperate.
Harry sighed miserably as Magalie reached up to try and wipe something from Draco’s cheek, her finger shimmering and dissipating before it made contact with white skin. There was a momentary flicker of something longing in Draco’s grey eyes before he collected himself and turned back to the cooking.
“There’s a particularly vicious one in Ron’s flowerbed,” Potter grinned as if letting Draco in on a secret. “I reckon it’s a bit partial to him as we think we saw it before at the Burrow – it must have followed him all the way there when he moved out.”
Malfoy, he had found, tended to favour the sound of a light breeze and the hazy projection of lavender fields. Harry wondered if there was also a conjured fragrance of the flowers, although it being a memory he couldn’t ever know.
“You’re real and you like me,” Draco murmured, smiling to himself as he stuff his face full of chocolatey goodness.
“Jesus Marls, I know you said he’s creepy but this is pushing it don’t you reckon? You know if you keep harassing my girlfriend like this we’ll put a report in at the Ministry,” Winshaw huffed. Harry felt a wash of sympathy go through his body as Malfoy’s eyes snapped to Marlene’s with a hurt, questioning look. Marlene looked a little uncomfortable but refused to meet Malfoy’s eyes as she gazed across the street.
Harry grinned before the fire flickered out, he was already looking forward to it, Ron’s barbeque skills were pretty legendary and it would be nice to be outside in the fresh air for once rather than being stuck inside the windowless pensieve room. Harry felt a strange twang of discomfort as he wondered how Malfoy was getting on in the Ministry’s holding cells?
“Obsessed,” Ron nodded as Harry pretended to busy himself with paperwork. “That’s what you are, bloody sixth year all over again.”
“Well I suppose someone had to see it,” Draco said, “now was there a reason you wanted to meet Potter –“
It had taken Draco a while to actually let himself converse with the ‘Pop Up Pals’ as one might another real human being. He had felt so foolish about the whole damn thing. But gradually, after the first time Magalie had asked him how his day went, or Lisette had giggled at his puffed up auror impression, Draco had realised his loneliness suddenly felt a lot more manageable.
Draco fingered the business card that the legal affairs worker from the lift had given him, her name had been Odette, her blue hair reminding Draco of the merpeople that used to swim past the windows in the Slytherin common room. Perhaps he could bribe her with home cooking in order to help him sue the Ministry for emotional damage? Plus, he wouldn’t put it past Pewterfoot to leave the investigation on Draco’s permanent record, despite acquittal. Even if Draco’s hopes of career advancement had been slim before they were practically zero now.
“I, um,” Draco took a step back but bashed his hip painfully into the window ledge, he wobbled before reaching out to steady himself. Unfortunately the nearest solid object was Harry, so this resulted in Draco’s palm being flat against a strong pectoral, his fingers threaded through the dark hair.
“Christ,” Malfoy mumbled, removing his arm and using his sleeve to mop at his brow. He looked exhausted Harry noticed, dark circles under his eyes from having stayed late at the office the previous night attempting to file a new mountain of reports.
“Good day,” Malfoy replied, his voice still painfully posh. He enunciated each consonant and vowel like his tongue was training for Olympic gymnastics. “Do you have a potions section? I’m looking for the new one from Caliban Porphyry.”
“Look, just, I thought it might be nice okay? I’d quite like to catch up with you and we’re all adults now and I mean we go to the same bloody place of work as each other every day for crying out loud!” Potter let out a forced sounding laugh, “It’s the Hairy Gooseberry.”
He held his breath a moment later as Potter leaned in, “Sorry if it felt weird to use your first name like that, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted me to yell your surname in public,” Potter blanched, “I mean – not that you should be ashamed of ‘Malfoy’ or anything –“
“Yes, well they suggested you two could do that whilst they track down Mario Bianchi,” Pewterfoot rolled his eyes.
“Oh stop,” Draco sighed, “that sounds like a line from Lilac Close, which having watched my memories, I’m sure you’re depressingly familiar with. The truth is we hadn’t talked since school before this and I wasn’t exactly pleasant to you then. You were assigned a case as an auror and you did your job. I was just...” Draco forced himself to look up at Harry. “I was horribly embarrassed. You have a history of witnessing me at inopportune moments, often during my lowest points.”
“Wait,” Harry frowned, “is this why George didn’t show up for the pub quiz yesterday? He said he got food poisoning from your barbeque!”
Harry watched as Malfoy pulled out a mid-sized hardback with a woodblock style print cover. He could see that it was the book that Malfoy had enquired about and the other man wore a faint smile as he opened to a random page containing botanical drawings and potions related arithmancy formulae. Harry was sure Hermione would have been able to understand what the book was about but all Harry could deduce was that it was some sort of potions theory.
Draco twisted the lid off the marble one handed whilst trying to get into his other shoe, hopping around his bedroom like a gazelle who had stepped on a bee.
Harry thought of Malfoy hiding from Harry in a Ministry corridor, the breathy sound of his name on the other man’s lips.
“How thoughtful of you,” Draco bit out. He could feel his armpits growing damp and he was itching to cast a drying spell before the silk got stained but he did not want to do so in front of Marlene. God, how had Draco even ever considered her a semi friend? It was pathetic.
“Mr. Malfoy was very reticent, however, to allow us access to his memories,” Pewterfoot continued, ignoring Ron’s outburst.
Draco ignored her in favour of biting into his swirl, the pastry was golden and flaky and just right.
It had been Narcissa’s fault really. In his mid twenties Draco had fallen into a black cloud of depression. It was when the cat calling on the streets and the hate mail to his various ‘meant to be secret’ P.O. boxes had just seemed insurmountable. Narcissa had suggested Draco reconnecting with some of his old friends, in order to get a bit of a support circle going.
“Ugh, what are you? Hagrid’s slobbering boarhound?” Draco squealed, wriggling to try and get away to no avail, Harry had him pinned. The other man simply laughed before continuing in his quest to taste every inch of Draco’s exposed skin.
“No!” Harry replied, looking aghast and hurriedly shucking the new shirt on. It was navy blue with the yellow emblem of crossed brooms on the chest. “Merlin, no Draco, I was honestly just teasing. I’m sorry. That was shitty of me.”
Once they were both topless Harry spun them round again so Draco was sat astride him, gasping as Harry aligned their crotches and ground up in small circular movements while they kissed.
Three hours later, Draco was ready to grab a broom and fly to the Italian liaison office to beat them over the head with the stack of completely unintelligible legalese he had been provided with. He hadn’t even started on the bloody Munich report yet. He groaned as he finally got the end of form A14, only to find out that he shouldn’t have filled it in if he had ticked yes to any question on form C26.
“Draco,” Harry whispered, moving his own hand to cup the other man’s chin and gently tugging so they were looking at each other. Draco’s tongue darted out to wet his lips as Harry’s face drew closer.
where Captain Peridot and the crew of the Nemean get stranded on the planet after Dr. Sangork sabotages their –“
Harry knew that Malfoy had been excluded from the returning batch of students who opted to complete their eighth year so as to sit their exams. “I mean that’s only one fewer than Hermione and she was always in the library…” Harry sighed as he followed Malfoy through the labyrinth of dingy corridors before crossing over the Ministry’s main atrium to the lifts that would take them to the Floo.
“Of course you bloody are,” Harry rolled his eyes, “it’s not exactly a fun titbit I like to open conversations with, can you imagine?
Malfoy took the book downstairs to the till where it was rung up at ten galleons, making Harry wince. That was nearly a week’s worth of groceries. Malfoy seemed to have been expecting the price, however as he calmly handed over the gold before the book was returned to him in a brown paper bag.
your faces when the Canons get through to the semis on Saturday. Not that I ever see that blond git anyway.”
“Yeah, that too. I never invite friends over here because they just look kind of miserable here to be honest, and I get it, it’s dark and the whole place smells a bit like fossilized troll.”
“Unlikely,” Andromeda chirped, “Isn’t Rose going to Hogwarts this September? I reckon they might do a double celebration, like we did with Teddy.”
“Oh yes, you meet Luna for ice cream Wednesdays don’t’ you?” Hermione said, leaning back on their sofa which was covered in a red crochet blanket. “How is she?”
“I should hope not,” Draco sniffed, “I thought perhaps you’d developed a taste for it after the Great Lake episode during the Triwizard Cup.”
“It’s so wonderful to see the sun shining and such a full house here at the Hairy Gooseberry,” the witch was continuing talking when Ron leaned into the table with a sly grin.
, for some inexplicable reason, sent him three vials of your own memories despite knowing he probably doesn’t have access to a pensieve. I mean what were you even doing in the memories?!”
“It certainly is,” Harry grinned, grabbing hold of Draco and flipping him round before cuddling up to him tightly. A considerable bulge was now pressed against Draco’s backside and hairy tanned forearms were wrapped around his chest.
“What did you expect?” Harry smiled with amusement at Ron’s familiar impatience, “For him to intermittently jump up on his desk and proclaim his undying hatred for all muggle borns?”
“Well,” Hermione sucked thoughtfully on her lip, “he was always really rather good at potions and I suppose he is no longer in possession of a house elf after the Malfoys had the majority of their assets seized.”
exactly do you think had to pick up that slack whilst you took an unannounced holiday?” Marlene retorted indignantly.
“Winshaw and Penny?” Harry exclaimed, “Bloody hell, they kept that quiet, how long’s it been going on for?”
which was a pay for hour service available to those who did not own their own bird. Harry had used it numerous times too, not having ever found it in himself to permanently replace Hedwig.
“What,” Draco began, summoning all his reserve courage.  “What is it you want from me Harry? Do you want my forgiveness? Do you want me to fix up your house? Do you want to just not feel guilty when you see me out and about, wondering if I’m still sat all alone at home taking to imaginary French people?”
“Neil Galespawn,” Ron informed Yasmin before pointing at Draco and a happily giggling Harry. “You’re both arseholes.”
“Nasty rot infestation you’ve got down here Marlene,” Winshaw snorted as his girlfriend rolled her eyes. Harry watched as Draco’s face paled and tightened, screwing the lid back on his soup and staring intensely at the paperwork in front of him.
“Well sometimes Magalie,” Malfoy unhooked a dark green apron from the wall before tying it around his neck and grabbing a wooden spoon to hold up defiantly as Magalie giggled, “a man just needs some damn comforting on a Monday evening.”
“What are you doing for your birthday?” Andromeda asked, her voice turning cheery and slightly teasing. Harry laughed despite himself, everyone knew he had little choice in the matter of celebrations. The Weasleys would undoubtedly hold some sort of large garden party, last year they had strung up snitch shaped fairy lights across the trees and, thanks to an extension charm, created a quarter sized quidditch pitch decked out in Gryffindor colours.
For some reason it made Harry feel like a stone had settled in his stomach as he forced another gulp of now luke warm tea.
“Please, they’re doing loads of dairy free options too now,” Harry repeated, ignoring the pointed clearing of throats behind them, he highly doubted anyone was going to be
“Not today,” Malfoy repeated as sympathy welled up in Harry’s chest. Poor Malfoy must have been even more affected by the run in with Marlene and Winshaw than he had realised.
He glanced around the cramped, windowless space and wondered how he would feel if the only adventures he had were through someone else’s badly written accounts.
“Don’t you normally go to the pub with your friends on Fridays?” Draco asked, his face a little tighter.
“This,” Harry felt himself flounder, “this sausage is not cooked,” he half shouted the last bit of information in Percy’s face, brandishing his hot dog as evidence before turning on his heels and stalking over to where Hermione was retying Rose’s unruly hair up with a scrunchie.
“Those rat bastards!” Ron exclaimed, causing the squid in the corner of the room to saturate its tank in a cloud of opaque ink, a single silver eye glaring through the darkness. “They just want to take all the bloody credit.”
Harry took another gulp of his tea as he imagined Malfoy diligently scouring the pages of trashy magazines for animated coupons. It was such an incongruous image to the sneering boy at school who boasted only the best copper cauldron imported from Germany.
Harry laughed as he pulled himself back upright, grinning over at Malfoy who had inadvertently whipped up a large dollop of floating bubbles which settled gracefully on his head like a bonnet.
“Draco...” Harry made a frustrated sound, picking his glasses back up and putting them on. “Fuck, look I’m pretty terrible at articulating myself.”
“Just a moment,” Malfoy called out distractedly. Harry walked back to the sofa to read Malfoy’s note, he knew he should probably just be fast forwarding through the entire thing, this clearly wasn’t anything to do with the investigation but he couldn’t help himself. Malfoy’s handwriting was, as always, incredibly neat and stylish, slanting slightly to the right in tightly looped cursive.
“You know the actual fossilized troll limb in the entrance hall might be to blame for that,” Draco commented wryly.
“You didn’t do the blood drop ritual first?” Draco frowned. “Without that, how did you expect to commune with the foundations?”
“Grimmauld Place could be just as stunning,” Draco huffed, feeling a little affronted on behalf of the London house, “it just requires a little understanding and coaxing.”
“Cake, swimwear and foreign languages, it’s a wonder Witch Weekly haven’t cracked the code sooner,” Draco huffed, “they’re always running articles on how to win a man’s heart.”
“You make it sound like I drink too much,” Harry protested, “I’m always the one ordering pumpkin juice.”
“Good lad!” Pewterfoot nodded. “Nice to know I still have some competent aurors around here. Now, let’s talk decapitations, apparently the head was actually pickled in vinegar this time…”
Harry laughed, but it sounded fond. “And as for what I want, yeah I would bloody love for you to forgive me. No, I don’t expect you to fix my house for me, I just kind of wanted to show you it because I thought you might be able to appreciate it, I don’t know anything about pure blood donut magic,”
“Mmnph,” Malfoy’s voice was breathless and slightly strangled. Harry, having scoured most of the bedroom floor by now had come to the devastating conclusion that the wand must have rolled
Harry took a deep breath before closing his mouth and bracing himself, looking back up at Draco. The other man’s eyes were wide and the corner of his mouth was twitching.
“I’m not a merman!” Hugo screeched, half tipping over Harry’s shoulder to kick his legs out of the water. “Look – I’ve got feet!”
“Keeping count are you?” Winshaw scoffed. Harry didn’t think for one moment that the other auror was genuine in his concerns about Malfoy’s designs on his girlfriend, the arsehat was probably just bored and wanted someone to mess with. “What are you even up to, sneaking about with an unmarked bag?” Winshaw gestured to Malfoy’s bookshop purchase before snatching it from the other man’s hands.
“Dear Lord,” Malfoy exclaimed, although it sounded a little squeaky. When Harry glanced back over he was surprised to see that Malfoy was glued to the screen and sporting a faint blush.
“No,” Draco shook his head, chuffed that he might know some obscure knowledge that the other witch didn’t and they hadn’t even got to the quiz section of the evening yet. “That was due to Durchdenwald, who was Potions professor at Durmstrang at the time, claiming that Nachtnebel fudged his data but it was later revealed that Nachnebel had just had an affair with Durchdenwald’s wife so Durchdenwald bribed a house elf to slip sparrow entrails into Nachtnebel’s cauldrons when he demonstrated his theory at the European Potions Fair that year.”
“Yes, magical creatures’ bones to be precise,” Luna elaborated, “I contributed to a book on them you see so I thought it might be good conversation.”
Harry’s desiccated house elf had turned up at one point to express his profuse joy at finally having a Black by blood in the house. Even though Harry had rolled his eyes behind the creature’s back he hadn’t looked too offended.
Harry grimaced as he realised his mistake, if he let on to Ron that he had actually started holding full blown one sided conversations with Malfoy in the memories he might find himself carted off to the Janus Thickey ward. “I mean listening to him chat, you know with his…”
Marlene’s mouth dropped open as Draco sent her a chilling smile before he and Harry side stepped past the unhappy looking couple and continued down the street.
Ron had been doing his best to suck up to Pewterfoot by even being him horribly expensive magisquid pellets from the petshop on Diagon.
Nevertheless, it did nothing to quell the slightly empty feeling Harry experienced now every time he arrived home at Grimmauld Place and stared forlornly into his own dark, echoing kitchen, not daring to imagine what Malfoy would do with all that space. Maybe the other man would finally be able to organize his pans how he wanted? Goodness knows Malfoy complained to Lisette enough about having to use shrinking and extending charms every time he needed to use something from the spice rack.
“I take it you finally checked your mail then,” Ron grinned ruefully. “Sorry mate but Ginny literally cast a spell on us to make sure we couldn’t let the cat out of the bag until people had seen their invitations. You know how I can’t keep my mouth shut half the time but I didn’t fancy being covered in giant green pustules for a week.”
“Alright then,” Harry said, brushing the crumbs of his recent pecan plait off his robes and getting up. It had only been five hours since he had last seen Draco but he was already missing the other man dreadfully. He couldn’t let that slip to Ron though or he would never hear the end of it.
“Fuck,” Malfoy barked at the empty alleyway that appeared to be used for storing the bins. “Fucking stupid…
Harry smiled guiltily as he steered a still wriggling Hugo towards his mother before swimming over to where Draco was sitting. “Are you coming in?” Harry asked. He had taken his glasses off and droplets of water were trailing down Harry’s brown skin, gleaming in the day’s bright sunshine. “You did bring swimmers right? If not, I’m sure Ron’s got a Canon’s orange pair you could borrow?” Harry laughed as Draco glared at him.
“We’re called the Gnarly Gnomes,” Potter told Draco with a smile that made Draco’s heart skitter. Potter’s cheeks had flushed slightly red and Draco figured the other man was a little bit tipsy given that he kept leaning closer to Draco as if misjudging the width of his own chair. “On account of all the Weasley’s gardens being infested with gnomes.”
Draco snapped his eyes up to see if Potter was mocking him, however the other man was still smiling in a disturbingly fond sort of way. Maybe Potter was going through a mid life crisis and wanted to try and recreate their school days? Perhaps he was currently rounding up all the old Slytherins he could find? In that case, Draco wouldn’t disappoint.
“Oh, I know, so stop your grumbling,” Hermione rolled her eyes, “honestly, you’re like Hugo when I tell him to tidy his room.”
Harry didn’t reply, the month of May could still be quite chilly and despite heating charms, the Ministry was mostly situated underground, allowing pervasive damp to creep through until the heat of summer finally banished it. Besides, Malfoy didn’t exactly look like he had much fat on him, perhaps he felt the cold more than most.
There was a letter of appreciation for his patronage from Camille as always, although Draco guessed the letters were mass produced by now and signed with a standard charm. Then there were six small silver pots. Draco flicked open the lid of the first pot with his perfectly trimmed nail and peered inside, sure enough there were five different coloured marbles held within.
“Harry!” Ron boomed, evidently well into his beer. “Glad you made it, I was just showing Penny the watering can George got me for my birthday last year.”
Harry froze, his eyes wide and not even daring to blink. Malfoy’s spasms slowly lowered in intensity, his face half buried in the pillow before he collapsed, boneless and spent in his own mess. Fingers slipped stickily from between his reddened arse cheeks.
in Malfoy’s memories. In fact, spending the evening, albeit afternoon in the real world, with Malfoy in his little kitchen, belting out Charles Trenet’s ‘La Mer’ whilst Malfoy used a wooden spoon as a makeshift microphone had become somewhat comforting.
Harry propped the quidditch pitch up on his mantelpiece before grabbing a handful of floo powder and chucking it into the fireplace.
Harry recalled back at school Malfoy would regularly receive packages of lotions and creams from France, Italy, Korean and occasionally Japan. Now the only mail Malfoy received from abroad were apparently the monthly supply of Pop Up Pals and handwritten letters from his mother.
“I’m still going to change,” Draco informed him, his heart was beating madly in his chest and Draco figured it might be wise to seclude himself indoors for a few moments before he did something embarrassing.
“Ten Galleons,” the shriveled witch behind the counter announced after placing all the bags on a cumbersome set of scales.
Since meeting the Pop Up Pals in Malfoy’s memories, Harry had done a little bit of research on the physics of the charms. Whilst each ‘friend’ was designed to best reflect what type of companionship was required of them they sometimes inevitably responded to the worries and concerns given off by the real wizard or witch’s aura. In such moments it was possible to reset the charm before they started embodying all your inner anxieties. Harry sat back on his chair, watching as Malfoy daintily licked the hummus from a carrot stick before crunching into it with relish
After his conversation with Bill and Alexandre, which had excitedly resulted in murmurings of a French – English professional curse breaking exchange conference, Draco had found himself dragged into the middle of debate with Luna and some dubious looking wizards about the application of osseous tissue in potion curatives.
!” Malfoy declared. “Potter and Weasley, I mean can they do no wrong? You should have seen them, surrounded by adoring fans and trigger happy photographers.”
Draco didn’t trust himself to speak, instead nodding before reaching back and partially pulling his trousers down so the elastic pressed half way down his arse. Harry seemed to take this as an invitation to lay Draco back before carefully sliding them all the way off.
“Oh god,” Harry winced, “sorry about that, I was telling him about a friend’s houseplant and I think he must have got confused.”
“I got Ron a blackberry turnover,” Potter continued in a manner that made Draco wholly unsure as to what response it was exactly that the other man was expecting? Did Potter want Draco to ask what he got for himself? Was this some sort of strange test?
Harry snorted, leading them through the house to the kitchen, which was looking lighter and warmer than when Draco had found it yesterday. The magic appeared to be coming alive again as Harry took out a couple of plates and a knife from a drawer. “I can definitely promise that,” Harry grinned, “the headmistress is currently out of the country visiting the summer school at Ilvermorny.”
Draco jerked his head up in surprise, “Merlin’s balls Harry, please don’t tell me you just ushered in your thirty first year of life sitting on a sofa with me eating mediocre takeout?”
“Which Canon’s seeker famously caught the snitch in –“ the witch was reading, when Draco snorted and turned to Harry.
Draco laughed before he could help himself, “Oh? One of my friends works for Comet if you need me to get you a sample half sized version fit for the occasion?”
Draco hummed as he tapped his quill against a new roll of parchment, he wasn’t sure whether to tell his mother he had come down with a nasty case of mumblemumps or a vicious onslaught of spattergroit. The latter seemed extreme but he was having a hard time finding a reason as to why he wouldn’t have been able to write. In the end he settled for an unidentified infectious disease that wouldn’t have allowed the nurses to bring him quill or paper. It wasn’t too much of a stretch to then insinuate their incompetence, or prejudices, also caused them to neglect sending word to Narcissa.
“Hey,” Harry said, leaning forwards, “shit, sorry, it’s okay. God, I know this has already happened and you can’t even hear me…” Harry sighed, at a complete loss of what to do. He had wondered when Malfoy was going to run out of the Pop Up Pals marbles, he’d been using them more sparingly over the last week.
. Not that I’m complaining mind you – it’s probably better for the world at large if Potter renders himself infertile and we don’t have to deal with any mini scarheads causing havoc all over the place.”
Draco rolled his eyes before slipping his sandals off and pushing his shorts down, simultaneously tearing off his own T-shirt before he could gage Harry’s reaction.
“Blooming ridiculous,” Ron muttered again as the levitating clipboards hovered over to each assembled team along with a self inking quill.
“It’s not,” Draco croaked, turning on his side and kissing him again. It was, it was too much, but not in the way Harry was probably worrying about. Besides, if it stopped Draco wasn’t sure he would get through it, in fact he might just dissolve into a puddle in the middle of the bed.
“Yeah, alright,” Harry wracked his brain before settling on something that he hoped Draco would deem suitably embarrassing. “I sort of…rap when I’m on the toilet.”
“Do they?” Harry cocked his head curiously. “I’m pretty sure all my friends think I’m a bit of an idiot to be honest and I know for sure Teddy thinks I’m ‘cringe’, he tells me so regularly.”
“Mate,” Ron grimaced, “no one in their right mind would stick their head in that thing unless they wanted to catch something nasty.”
Besides, Harry had made sure to angle himself in such a way that he couldn’t see anything beneath the inch thick layer of bubbles Malfoy had whipped up with a steaming purple potion. All that was visible were the very tops of Malfoy’s shoulders and his knees which had turned a bright pink from the hot water.
,” Harry bit out, immediately falling to all fours and desperately feeling around for it. He sat up as another heavy gasp of breath echoed through the otherwise silence.
Harry’s eyes snapped up as Malfoy spoke for the first time. His voice, although still cold and posh, had lost its loud, imperious nature. The witch, Marlene, whose hair was big and curled, gave him a cursory grunt. Harry waited for Malfoy to snap at her, didn’t she
“Draco!” Magalie cried as she appeared, her smiling face turning to confusion. “Ah, but you are wearing your best outfit – are you leaving already? You only just activated me.”
“Well maybe you should have packed your things last night instead of taking Hugo to the fireworks,” Draco hummed smugly, picking up his gardening basket and walking back into the house.
“Potter,” Lisette concluded as Malfoy wheeled round with extravagant flare, a spatula full of stew flying off in the other direction.
“Bones?” Draco ventured tentatively. Maybe Potter was starting a cult and that was why he had invited Draco, everyone knew a Malfoy couldn’t resist a good cult.
Hermione laughed before nudging an empty glass towards Draco along with a full pitcher of what was presumably Pimms or some kind of fruity cocktail. “Help yourself,” she instructed, “we thought we’d make the use of the good weather whilst it was still here.”
“So what you’re saying is Harry Potter somehow accessed your memories? I’m confused, how can someone –“
“I mean that interview he gave the Prophet about not finding school games challenging enough,” Malfoy sneered. “Maybe that’s because the Gryffindor team at the time had
“The very same,” Luna beamed. Draco wriggled in his chair, he had thought Luna was just spouting her school days brand of unintelligible gibberish but this was actually something interesting.
“Yeah, maybe,” Harry mumbled, watching as Draco continued to smooth out his shirt until seemingly content there was not a speck of soup left on it before he returned to his papers.
“And all this time you’ve just been ordering take out,” Draco muttered, moving over to the east wall and frowning. There were no cupboards on this wall, just unadorned bricks that occasionally flickered like one of Draco’s Pop Up Pals.
“I don’t know why it’s done that,” Malfoy frowned indignantly at the plant, as if he couldn’t quite believe the audacity. He sighed, “I suppose you’re right, it’s just… I was never able to do anything I wasn’t good at.”
Harry grunted, he had noticed that Malfoy’s colleague had been particularly chatty to anyone and everyone today, clearly taking the opportunity to brag about her booked vacation.
“Wasn’t Nachnebel’s work discredited?” Hermione asked, obviously also well read on the subject. Draco guessed she was also coming at it from the perspective of a Healer who used regenerative potions on a daily basis.
“I don’t have a syndrome,” Harry grumbled petulantly. “I just think he’s a bit lonely and yeah, okay I guess I feel a little sorry for him.”
“Oh, you can tell he likes cooking,” Ron noted as they surveyed the kitchen. What little space there was was covered in various pots and pans, bottles of sauces, spice jars and recipe books, some of which were written in other languages.
“I could walk in and they could all be waiting there to pelt me with out of date doxy eggs?” Draco suggested.
“I know a lot about curses,” Malfoy continued, he was biting his lower lip now. Harry had noticed Malfoy often did it when he was deep in thought. Harry half wanted to reach out and stop the other man before it bled again.
“Had a nice old laugh at the pathetic little Death Eater who doesn’t have any friends so he has to conjure them?” Draco continued, willing himself to just shut the hell up and storm out of there. Thank god the muffling charm was still active on their table so at least the entire pub couldn’t witness this.
“I go rock climbing,” Harry protested, before realizing that was the world’s biggest lie. He hadn’t been rock climbing in years and had only done it the once because his then boyfriend had insisted.
“An albatross pooped on Lucius Malfoy’s head once,” Harry blurted out as Luna paused and turned her owlish blue eyes towards him.
“Yes, I’d heard,” Draco nodded, “just as long as you promise me I’m not going to be faced with McGonagall in a bikini.”
A momentary flash of hurt passed across Potter’s features before his cheerful grin was back, albeit a little tighter. The change made Draco’s insides wobble with something akin to regret.
“Draco!” Harry yelled as he trod water with a giggling Hugo Weasley using him like jungle gym. “Save me will you? I’m being dragged down to the depths by this vicious little merman!”
The floor was thick flagstones, upon closer inspection Draco could tell it was black Welsh slate, probably from a wizarding mine as it held warming charms that would mean your toes never got cold on its surface, even in the dead of winter. There was a pantry leading off from one side, the walls of which were threaded with preservation magic.
Harry gestured frustratedly as Malfoy finally pulled his hands away from his face and stood up, walking back towards the kitchen.
“Awesome,” Ron sighed at the sparkling new black coffee machine, which looked a little too heavy for the collapsible metal table it was sitting on.
“Oh ho ho!” Picklemarsh exploded into a laugh that Harry felt would be more at place on the stage of a pantomime than a Ministry Administration office. “Well then, if you think you’re so much damn cleverer than the rest of us –“ Picklemarsh spread out his hands, “why don’t you go and get yourself a poncy job eh? Worthy of your
Malfoy groaned, before stamping angrily over to the park, flinging himself down on a wrought iron bench that was partially hidden by a horse chestnut tree.
Draco rolled his eyes his agreement, although he had noticed since his return to the Ministry that Potter seemed to have acquired a new set of looser uniform. Witches must be crying their eyes out all over the place.
Draco wondered if Potter had noticed how painfully, perpetually dateless Draco was? He was sure Magalie had teased Draco about his lack of romantic experience several times over the month of May. Potter’s memories, on the other hand, would probably be rated R18 whilst the most action Draco ever saw was his own…
“Draco,” Odette reached out and squeezed his shoulder sympathetically, “from what you’ve told me of Harry Potter he’s a decent person, I don’t think you need to torture yourself like this.”
Draco stared at Harry’s still sleeping face. There were small, barely there wrinkles at the sides of his eyes and his full lips were slightly dry. He was also devastatingly, horribly handsome, his dark eyelashes twitching and a faint crease appearing between his thick brows.
The first thing Draco did upon returning home was double strengthen all his wards. Undoubtedly if he had been in Draco’s memories for a month then Harry would know where he lived. Draco made absolutely sure that no one could get within a foot of the front door before sitting down on his sofa.
“How long does it take to wear off?” Draco frowned as a young boy started terrorising his sister by stealing all the food of her plate with his new found extremity, like a frog might gobble up flies.
Occasionally, Harry would catch a glimpse of almost silver hair down the end of a corridor or across the courtyard but he had never seen Malfoy at the canteen or any of the Ministry end of year parties. With the amount of employees the Ministry had it wasn’t that surprising that Ron hadn’t noticed Malfoy.
As a result, the jeans had never actually been worn and still retained a stiffness in the material, creaking slightly whenever Draco bent down. Hopefully, any embarrassing noises would be covered by a pub’s general ambience.
Harry trotted after Malfoy until they were in the lift. For some inexplicable reason each of the Ministry lifts had completely different décor. One of them was dented aluminum walls like the kind you’d find in a multi storey car park, another was all plush red carpet and marble sides like a Park Avenue hotel. This one sported a rather faded floral carpet and lemon linoleum walls. It reminded Harry of the elevator in the Milanese apartment block he had done stake out with Ron in.
