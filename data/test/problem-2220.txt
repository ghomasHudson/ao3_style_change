‘It’s not fair!’ Draco wailed, and Harry’s chest clenched uncomfortably. He hated seeing Draco upset.
He needn’t have worried. He’d only been walking five minutes when someone apparated right in front of him, blocking his path. They were facing the wrong way, but Draco would know that hair anywhere.
“It appears you’re perving on me, Potter. I don’t recall inviting you in.” Harry frowned before realising that she’d taken off her jumper to heal her arm. She must have been wearing another long-sleeved shirt underneath it as she was standing inches away from him in only her bra. Instantly he stepped away, letting go of her hand. His face was blazing hot and his stomach curled with embarrassment.
“Good. You will be escorted to a cell where you will be held pending questioning. You have the right to seek legal representation. If you cannot provide your own, legal counsel will be provided for you. You are entitled to one floo call which someone will be sent to your holding cell to arrange. Is there anything you wish to say? I must advise you that you do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.” She said it with a flat tone that suggested she said the same thing a hundred times a day. It occurred to Draco that all of this was being done in a crazy backwards order, which suggested they were particularly bothered about treating him properly.
It seemed to be going well. There was actually a flicker of hope inside him that he hadn’t messed the whole thing up – at least, not to an unsalvageable extent, but there was something about that Latin phrase that was putting him off.
‘No. I thought maybe things didn’t sound great, but I didn’t know if that was just normal separation anxiety.’ He warmed his hands against his tea mug and wondered how they were going to deal with everything. He felt like he was waiting for so many things – he was waiting for Teddy to come home to find out what was going on, he was waiting for his magic to come back so that things could get back to normal. What else was he waiting for that he didn’t even realise? What if he waited forever for things that were never coming?
‘Scourgify.’ Ella watched with fascination as the scribble lifted off the page, leaving her half-completed puzzle behind. She blinked away the tears that were weighing heavy on her eyelashes.
‘I promise you, that the Ministry is more than aware of your allegiances Malfoy, and anyone who wants to question them will answer to me personally.’
‘I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t want to be. I love you, ok?’ Harry looked at him for a long moment.
Draco thought.
‘Draco, no. I didn't mean it like that it's just- I'll think about it, ok?’ His head snapped back up.
He strode over to a cabinet in the corner of the living room/kitchen and pulled out a battered old pensieve. It had belonged to his grandfather and Draco had managed to save it from the Manor before it had been auctioned off as ‘war reparations’. Draco wasn’t bitter, he needed an excuse not to live in that death trap anymore.
‘He’s invited you on another date.’ He said flatly. Harry’s eyes scanned the message Draco had just read and he saw his grip on the phone become so tight his fingers turned white.
.’ Draco cringed as Harry quoted his eleven-year-old self back to him. He was such a snotty kid, he couldn’t even deny it.
‘Yeah, we did.’ Harry turned his head to the side and kissed Draco cheek. Draco was hit with the domesticity of it all, even though the novelty should’ve worn off by now. He wasn’t sure he would ever be used to it, really. He’d never expected to have a family like this in a million years. Before his father had died, he’d thought he would marry whomever he saw fit to match him with and deal with the consequences of being with a woman. Lie back and think of England as Pansy used to joke. Then, after his father died, Draco knew he could never live a lie like that, but it wouldn’t matter anyway because no one would want to be associated with him.
‘Yes. I know it looks bad, but I just never got around to changing it back. You have to understand, with my family history-’
He prised her away from him. ‘No, no hiding. Come on, tell me what happened.’
‘We don’t need to go now, do we? I know you can apparate across oceans Mr The-Rules-Don’t-Apply-To-Me, but there’s no way I can side-along with you. I can get Spungen to arrange us a portkey. He’s got the Ministère des Affaires Magiques de la France in his back pocket, he’s so old.’
“I’ll leave that to the general public if you don’t mind, Potter. They have more than enough to go around. They might even throw in a fruit basket if you ask nicely.”
He was in his favourite coffee shop near Mayfair and for once he had decided to read the Prophet, to make sure he was up-to-date with the wizard stock market. It wasn’t strictly relevant to him, but Goblins were notorious for undermining wizards’ intelligence with their quips. Draco was no fool, his father had taught him well when it came to negotiations.
‘Oh my love, no. No one is going to take me away from you, darling. Especially not an arse like Smith.’ Draco cracked a small smile. Harry hadn’t even met the man. ‘There we go. There’s my favourite smile. He’s just jealous of how beautiful my husband is.’ His face dropped when he realised what he said, but Draco didn’t give him a chance to think about it too much. He stole another kiss from him. This one slower and sickly sweet but less frantic now that he was beginning to calm down.
‘What the hell are you playing at?’ Draco spit, his wand digging into Harry’s neck.
The weeping branches of the willow obscured them enough from view that Harry felt like they were the only two people in the world, and from here he didn’t have to worry about Draco’s silky white skin burning under the harsh sun.
“Harry stoooop,” he whines, but he doesn’t put up much fight.
‘Maybe it’s time you did something new? Get your mind away from Potter. Go on a date, buy some new clothes, take up golf or something.’ Draco rolled his eyes.
‘It hasn’t been easy, I’m not really…in control of things. Harry’s doing his best to help but he really is busy, and he can’t be there all the time. Having Teddy home has helped so much though. It’s honestly not the same without him…’ He felt like he was saying the same things over and over. After Christmas things would be different though. He swore it.
“Harry, how are you feeling?” Sirius gave him a small smile and Harry could see the worry in his eyes behind the dark shades which matched Lyra’s.
Harry discovered he had marinated chicken with it. Then he started dipping apples in it. Next he put it in risotto. But the final straw came for Harry when he put it in brownies. Just… why. In actual fact, some of these, despite sounding weird, were kind of nice. Unfortunately, when hummus had been on the menu for seven meals in a row, Harry was about a minute away from losing his mind.
” Harry pulled on the blanket but all that happened was that it ripped in half, leaving Harry with an end that said
‘Harry…’ Draco’s eyes pricked with hot tears as he tried to force his breathing to remain steady. His chest burned with the effort, but he refused to make a scene at Harry’s birthday.
However, knowing that a spell in Azkaban
“Feeling better?” She asked him when she set down the tea beside him, made exactly how he likes it. “You can read the letter if you are.”
“He could be anywhere right now. He could be dead!” Draco screeches. This isn’t the first time Harry has been in this position, but it’s certainly the worst time. It’s three in the morning and he has had to drag Draco out of bed to make him aware of the situation. There’s only one lamp lit in the room and it does nothing to help the state Draco’s in. His hair is sticking up on one side, there are deep circles under his eyes, and the shirt he was sleeping in is hanging off one shoulder. Actually, now that Harry is looking…
scar, but the notes I’ve been sent from St Mungo’s indicate your subconscious has blocked a significant proportion of memory. I can’t do those without someone else present to act as an anchor. Again, I suggest you bring Harry. It’s not the same as counselling, you don’t have to tell him anything you don’t want to, but he seems like the best option for success. It’s something to think about.’
“Um, the same.”
Nevertheless, Ginny glared at him as she sat down and remained cold throughout the meal. Draco gripped Harry’s hand tightly under the table throughout and took comfort in the way Harry’s thumb brushed over the back of his knuckles. It made eating difficult, but it was worth it and Harry never complained.
‘I don’t want to taint this place for you. That wasn’t the point of coming here.’ Draco sighed and shook his head.
‘No! I won’t stop! This is unbelievable. I can’t believe you fucking lied to me. It’s like I don’t even know you anymore and I-’
‘What do you want Wood. I didn’t leave my family to listen to you spout nonsense. This has to stop.’ Harry’s voice was low and cold and Draco wished he could see his face, just for a second.
Harry’s hand inched out towards Draco and for a brief moment he considered the possibility that Harry wasn’t reaching out for him at all, simply that he wanted
‘He didn’t know about you because there’s nothing to tell. I don’t go around telling every stranger I meet on the street about you, do I? That’s none of his business. Maybe if you hadn’t started screaming in my face, we could’ve talked about it rationally. Your recovery on the other hand, is actually important.’ Draco sighed. He wasn’t sure what to believe – it felt like there was something Harry wasn’t saying. He could, however, shut him up about this recovery thing.
The same mediwitch he’d seen before returned a few minutes after Hermione left.
‘Ted, you’re getting a bit old for this.’ Draco said, trying to distribute Teddy’s weight more evenly. Teddy let out a sob and all but buried himself in Draco. Draco was floundering, Teddy had never behaved like this before and Draco had no idea what he was doing. He decided the safest course of action was to, probably quite awkwardly, pat his back and wait to let him talk.
Hermione’s office was easy to spot. There was an entire floor of the Ministry dedicated to the Minister’s offices and his advisors, and as his new PA, Hermione’s office was right next door. Draco smiled at the gleaming gold plaque which now read
paradigm.” This was one of the few times Draco regretted knowing Latin because even though he wasn’t familiar with the term, he most certainly knew what it meant, and he really rather hoped it wasn’t what he thought it was.
He’d hesitated because the store would be very close to some of the muggle hotels which lined the Seine. It was so close to the beautiful church of Saint Julien and from the street corner he’d have a view of Notre-Dame and he wondered why he’d been so hesitant before, maybe it was because he was scared of creating too many roots here.
‘Draco, Draco! Daphne is washing my hair with shampoo! And condishonerer! It smells like strawberries!’ His heart squeezed at the was she stumbled through saying conditioner.
“You two have an amazing bond. How long has he been staying with you? You never said.” Luna took the opportunity while the fox was distracted by Harry to start spell casting. None of them were spells Harry had seen before, so he couldn’t follow what she was doing. Was it crazy that the fox was so attached to him when it had only been in the flat for one night? Harry was just as taken with him too, even though he didn’t want to admit that to anyone else.
Early on he’d taken to singing quietly the few songs he remembered the words to, only so that he didn’t lose the ability to speak and in the absence of his piano. It was evening, although it was hard to tell when the sky remained the same shade of stormy grey at all times. He could tell on this occasion by the faint glow of a waxing gibbous behind the clouds. He tried to think about which potions ingredients would be best to harvest during a waxing gibbous, but he was too tired. He was always too tired these days. Looking out at the glowing white circle, he was reminded of a song his mother used to sing when he was small.
Making his way downstairs he paused outside the tapestry room. A cold shiver ran down his spine just at the atmosphere in that part of the landing, yet he was still tempted to open the door. His hand hovered over the door handle. On one hand, seeing the anomaly in the fabric might set him off again and he couldn’t handle more of the dizziness. On the other hand, with a clearer head it might confirm some of his suspicions.
‘The garden was always so beautiful,’ Harry said, his voice still thick. His thumb grazed Draco’s lower back gently and it felt as though it was burning through the blue shirt he’d chosen that morning. ‘I couldn’t let it go to waste. It’s still one of my favourite parts of the house. It has you written all over it,’ he said with a dry laugh. Draco thought he must be able to feel his ragged breaths with his hand positioned where it was, but Draco refused to look at him and admit defeat. Harry wasn’t wrong though; the garden was done up with banners and fairy lights which only brought out the vibrancy of the flowers. Someone had scattered beanbags across the lawn and the kids were having a whale of the time trying to jump between them.
The scents of cedar and grapefruit assaulted Draco’s senses again and left him feeling dizzy. His grip on the front of Harry’s robes tightened and Harry let out a strangled kind of whine as he was pulled even closer to Draco’s chest. Draco never wanted the feeling of Harry’s lips moving against his own to stop, and he especially didn’t want to have to confront whatever it was he thought he was doing, but he was quickly running out of air. Eventually he was forced to pull away, the both of them flushed and panting slightly.
That’s why he’d started volunteering at the orphanage.
He glanced down at Teddy and saw that the little boy’s face had also fallen. Well done Harry, scare the poor boy more.
“We wrote to Remus,” Lyra was saying. “We think it would be good for you to have someone around. Other than us that is. It’s not good for you to spend so much time alone…”
‘Well…I…er. Look, Draco,’ she said, putting on her professional voice. ‘It isn’t my place. I’ve said my piece about you and Harry. If you have an issue you need to talk to him about it. You really scared him yesterday and he went full on Head Auror mode on us all. Yes, he didn’t need to do all that, but that’s just what he’s like.’
It was then that he realised that he hadn’t seen his friends since the day he had come back from the Ministry. There had been no word from Blaise or Theo or Greg. Maybe Pansy had kept them informed on his behalf, but then she had been so preoccupied by Granger…
The next morning the entire castle was buzzing with the gossip that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy spent the night outside together. Some said they duelled by moonlight, others said they had a midnight quidditch match. Professor McGonagall put an end to the rumours when they moved on from duelling and turned into a different kind of wand fight.
not to come back. Maybe he’d found exactly what he was looking for and didn’t see any reason to come back to Draco. Any reason to come back. Period. Not to Draco.
Kingsley looked wearily at Harry and Draco sneaked a glance in his direction. He looked far better than Draco did, a little tanned in fact. Probably been on a fancy getaway with Leggy-Blonde. Harry was tense, very tense actually. It wouldn’t be obvious to many people, but Draco knew. The small twitch in his sharp jawline, the way he held himself just a little straighter than was natural to him, his nervous habit of attempting to smooth his hair down. As if anything could tame the bird’s nest.
‘It says you’ve had to deal with a lot in your life and you’re still finding ways to do that. And that’s ok. There are as many good things you have done. You raised Teddy. That little boy is the shining star he is because he had you to teach him how. I had the courage to go through with opening the orphanage because you made me believe I didn’t have to be defined by being The Chosen One.’ Had Draco really done all that? ‘Why are you so scared of me? I’m not going anywhere just because of this. You’re making yourself sick keeping it all to yourself. I don’t understand why you can’t just let me in.’ He started shaking Draco with his frustration.
“Wasn’t I supposed to be doing something?”
‘Of course love.’ Harry barely so much as blinked and Draco was enveloped in a furnace level heat.
‘Was this house owned by the Blacks or by the Malfoys?’
‘You’ve done all these amazing things. You became Head Auror, you opened a damned orphanage. You found ways to use your talents to do good and that’s amazing. After you and I split up, I went to shit. I was weak, I was a mess, I did nothing useful. What does that say about me?’
‘Weeks? How long have I been here?’ Her face crumpled and his stomach dropped. Just how much had he missed?
‘Looks perfect to me!’ He sat in the chair next to the pair and they chatted about unicorns and princess and dragons because Ella had watched quite a few muggle children’s films over Christmas. It seemed the orphanage’s idea of entertainment was plonking the kids in front of the screen and hoping it would occupy them all day. Some things still needed work.
“I had better go,” Granger said hesitantly as his fingers landed on the last chord. Any atmosphere built by the ebb and flow of the piece evaporated in an instant. Pansy’s chin left Draco’s shoulder and in a blink of any eye she had flung her arms around Granger’s neck and was kissing her fervently.
“You’ll love this part. You have to make a username – it’s what people will see when they look at your profile.”
He looked down at his Grinch jumper once more and sighed in resignation. He hoped no one really thought he was a Grinch, he actually loved Christmas. He took his own handful of floo powder and closed his eyes as he stepped into the fireplace – sometimes it helped with the nausea.
“That’ll be in the modern section then,” he told her, pointing towards the bookcase on the far right. He glanced over at the small desk his father had added to this room. It wasn’t as intricate and ostentatious as the desk in his study, but he had added a simpler one to this room, presumably so he didn’t have to lug heavy books and delicate manuscripts across different floors. There was a quill abandoned on the scratched surface, its tip stained with dried black ink. Draco wondered what it was his father had been researching the last time he had been in here.
‘I’ll think about it but right now I really need to analyse these samples. I think I might be on to something here.’ He said as one of his samples started giving him some bizarre readings. Pansy huffed at being turfed out of his lab.
“Only because you kept going on and on about how much fun it is! This is a nightmare!”
‘Deep breath, I got you.’ He finally managed to take in a lungful of air and he immediately felt a bit better. Ella was back on her feet looking at him with childish concern and he forced a weak smile. He took Harry’s hand tightly in his own and looked around.
‘What’s that?’ He tried to keep his voice even, but it came out strained.
Harry’s hand was splayed across Draco’s stomach, right where his pyjama top had ridden up. The exposed skin was practically burning with Draco’s overwhelming awareness of Harry, but he couldn’t bring himself to loosen up the tense posture he’d adopted the second Harry had reached for him.
As the screaming reached unbearable levels, and Harry was sure his eardrums were bleeding, he managed to find a gap around the edge of the curtain. In its panic, the fox had wrapped most of the fabric around itself. Harry pulled the loose edge and the fox tumbled around until it righted itself and glared at Harry. He would have been worried, knowing the ferocity of an angry fox, but with one ear up and one ear down where it had taken a tumble, Harry could only think how cute it was.
“He’d be proud. He wouldn’t have wanted George taking it all on by himself.” Ron glanced back at Harry and gave him a weak smile. They never talked about Fred, but Harry got the impression Ron took it the hardest of all the siblings – maybe even more so than George. George was adamant that it was impossible to lose a twin because he could always tell what Fred was thinking.
‘Draco.’
Draco was blown away. He knew the decision had been unfair, but once the goblins made their choice, no force on earth could usually sway them. Included in the envelope, were the deeds to the Malfoy property in France. Draco hadn’t realised that his father had already transferred ownership to Draco by the time of his arrest. Of course, Draco shouldn’t have been surprised – Lucius had always been ruthless and calculating when it came to the Malfoy Estate. Vault 726 was the vault his father had set up for him when he was a child. It was customary in pureblood families to do so as although Draco was already set to inherit the Estate as the sole heir, it was assumed that the money would be used to keep his bride until such time that it was necessary for him to take over.
‘I want to talk to him. No one seems to understand that. I don’t want to spend my life keeping everything to myself, but how do people talk about these things? How am I supposed to trust anyone enough to say these things to? I don’t want to be ungrateful, I don’t want him to think I don’t love him but how am I supposed to trust him when he pulls stunts like this? You’d know the answer. You always had an answer. Not always the right one though – I can say that now you can’t clip me around the ear.’ He laughed a hollow laugh which make him cough violently into the cold air.
Two things happened immediately after Draco regained consciousness. First, he sneezed. It appeared his nighttime foray into the grounds during the storm really had cost him dearly. Second, and as a result of the sneeze, he became aware of a rather large lump on his forehead, presumably due to his head hitting the ground. He could feel the lump but couldn’t touch it. It was then he understood that his hands were tied.
‘Draco! I wasn’t expecting to see you.’ She walked around the box she’d been packing to greet him with a hug. He was getting so many of those recently.
‘Be careful, Draco. All this secrecy, this is how it started last time.’ He sighed, he knew she was right.
‘I know you will sweetheart. Just don’t forget to write ok? Even if it is just to stop me worrying.’ Teddy rolled his eyes but nodded anyway.
‘Why?’ He asked her, playing with his lasagne instead of eating it. He’s not sure why he got it, Harry always preferred lasagne to him, even though Draco perfected the recipe quite quickly.
‘Oh wow. Ok. Give me five minutes to get everyone out of here. Try to contact the Minister for me, please?’ Draco appreciated Harry’s attempt at civility and he dashed off to speak to Kingsley’s secretary.
“Why did you move here?” He asked her. It definitely startled her.
‘Definitely.’ Draco replied, his voice strained. They looked at each other for a long time, Draco searching Harry’s green eyes as if looking for something lost. He still had that stubble he’d had during their meeting with Kingsley and Draco had to admit that he much preferred that to when he was clean shaven. Draco thought Harry had over-groomed himself during their relationship, thinking Draco expected that of him. He didn’t, he just wanted Harry to be himself.
‘No. I mean both of you are good and bad but you’re useless on your own.’ Draco snorted at the idea that Harry was useless without him. He’d set up a damn orphanage for crying out loud. He appreciated the sentiment though.
“My help.” He repeats flatly. “Why would I be able to help you? I’m entirely the wrong sort.” Harry doesn’t blame Malfoy for being dubious, in fact he almost laughs at the reference to one of their earliest interactions all those years ago, but he really could use Malfoy’s help, so he tries not to be antagonistic.
Harry hated Hermione.
He slipped the journal into his bedside drawer along with his glasses and followed Harry to his study, where he was at his desk pulling a stack of papers out from the top drawer.
is this I hear about you moving to France?’ Draco wasn’t too proud to admit that Pansy scared him
The following day was a Friday, and Draco kept his head down at work and tried his best to avoid Harry at all costs. He didn’t want to play with Harry’s emotions any more than he already had done. The only thing getting him through the day was the thought of having Teddy for the weekend.
“How did we win the war?” He asked her quietly. His own voice sounded as if it was underwater. He could feel himself being dragged deep under the current and he wanted to let it take him. But first he needed to hear this. She seemed stunned for a minute and he guessed it was the last question she expected him to ask.
‘Anger, I guess. Embarrassment mostly. It was in the paper and everyone except me knew all about it and no one had said anything. I’ve been reliant on him since I lost my magic and I don’t know what I would do without him. I thought he loved me and the whole time and he’s been lying to me.’ The deep feeling of despair he’d been drowning in that night he’d cried alone in the guest room came back. It was like a darkness casting a shadow over him.
“Oh come off it, Granger. You know what I mean. Early modern if you will. There are manuscripts in this room that date back to ninth-century France, the seventeenth is absolutely modern.”
‘My research friends thought it would be best if you didn’t. Those spells are only really meant for light damage or trauma. Maybe in early-onset dementia patients at the most. They shouldn’t be mixed with dark magic at all.’ That didn’t instil confidence in Draco – should he trust Smith’s abilities? ‘Anyway, I started doing some of my own research into horcrux related magic. My position at the Ministry gives me access to far more restricted source material than most, although I’m sure it’s not a patch on your family’s collection, Draco.’ Of course, why had it never occurred to him to look through the Malfoy family library? It was one of the few things he’d actually saved from the Manor.
‘Bonjour messieurs. Bienvenue à la Pâtisserie Jules!’
“The clutch is still dipped!”
‘She’d just always showing up and Dad forgets about me. I know it’s selfish but I’m going to school and I want to see him.’ Teddy curled up in a ball and Draco’s chest ached for him. He didn’t deserve such a sweet boy.
‘I’m not here to tell you anything. I’m here to listen to what you have to say. It’s never crossed your mind why it was him? Why not Harry or your mother or one of your friends? Why you father?’
‘I guess you’re right,’ he said quietly. Harry shifted, turning his body to face Draco who kept staring ahead at the photo of them on their wedding day on the opposite wall.
‘Shit!’ He yelped, ruining their little moment. Draco didn’t know what to say. He supposed he was grateful he wasn’t the only one nervous about the day’s events. Draco had been having dreams about it for days. He must’ve planned how to tell Teddy everything a hundred times over but none of it seemed right. Maybe he’d just been overthinking it. They were getting back together, Draco had moved to the continent and back again and nearly died in the process. That was about it.
‘What? Why? What’s happening?’ He tried to ask as Harry steered him to the bottom of the stairs and gave him quite a forceful nudge in the small on his back.
They lapsed into silence again. After a couple of minutes, it was clear Granger could no longer withstand the quiet, so she flipped open the file closest to her. On top of it was a photo of him he’d never seen before and didn’t remember having taken.
‘Sorry love.’ Harry pulled the muggle phone out of his pocket and stood up to answer it out of earshot. It clicked as he flipped the screen open and Draco winced. He hated that blasted phone with a passion. If they hadn’t been split when Harry bought it, he would’ve screamed blue murder until he put the damn thing back. He had been contemplating getting Ron to add extra warding to the house so it wouldn’t work when they were home. Harry had bought one so that he’d be contactable by muggle means of course. It made sense, but that didn’t mean Draco had to like it.
‘Oh shut up. You know how I feel about seeing you in those reading glasses.’ Harry flicked his wand and the wine started pouring itself. Draco was only grateful he hadn’t picked an expensive vintage although he probably didn’t even know the wine cellar existed, much less be able to pick an acceptable wine. Why they were drinking in the middle of the afternoon he didn’t want to know, they weren’t as young as they had once been and the closer Draco got to turning thirty, the less he handled his drink.
‘Have you heard from Teddy? How’s Hogwarts treating him?’ Hermione asked as she walked into the room. Her curly hair was still a little damp, but she seemed much less flustered than she had been when he’d dropped into her office.
The next morning a case file landed on Draco’s desk with a complete list of all the locations Runcorn and Hopkirk had been spotted at since they’d begun tailing them.
Johnny’s confusion had worn off and he clambered over the two of them and started smacking strawberry smelling kisses all over Draco’s face. He wanted to be disgusted, he really did, his father would’ve taken it as the greatest insult ever. He couldn’t though, it was far too cute. Instead, he laughed loudly and let Johnny have his fun.
to be found? If I were him, I’d have cut my loses years ago. You’ve seen the way they mob him in the streets, it’s no way to live.” As she spoke Draco stared at the smudge of bright red lipstick in the left corner of her mouth. Only she would show up to his house for a breakfast date at eight in the morning with a full face of make up and stilettos.
“No! No, it’s nothing like that.” He scratches the back of his head nervously. “I actually was hoping for your help…” He tries very hard not to bite his lip, a habit he has developed that drives Ginny mad, but he can’t quite manage it. Malfoy’s eyes flicker to Harry’s lips and narrow, but he makes no comment.
‘Go and do something useful, Kreacher.’ Harry barked irritably at him. He didn’t need to be dusting Harry’s limited-edition snitch collection, Harry had seen him do that three times already this week and he swore he was doing it on purpose just to piss him off.
She didn’t miss a beat. “Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t slap you again.” His anger flared.
The thought of living the rest of his life not knowing if Potter was alive or dead was like a black hole opening up inside him. There had been opportunities to make amends. At almost any time during school Draco could have chosen to be a better person. He could have apologised; done the right thing. Potter would never have returned any of Draco’s affections, he knew that, but they could have been friends.
Harry had to take that literally.
‘Smith mentioned it. He said some of the tests they did at St Mungo’s revealed I have repressed memories or some such rubbish.’ He eventually took the seat he had sat her in to fix her hair, and she almost disappeared into the one behind her desk, it was set so low.
‘Take your time, love. There’s no rush. I’m here.’ Harry went to pull away, but Draco held him closer. He needed him or he wouldn’t get through it.
‘Surprise?’ Draco said weakly. He finally spotted his wand; hidden in plain sight on the kitchen counter. He walked past Harry and picked it up. He knew a decent amount of healing charms, so he began to levitate fragments of glass from his arm.
‘I remember. And you’re right, he’d hate those.’ Instead, Draco chose a simple style, but picked one with self-cleaning charms that kept away the dust. The creepy old witch was still staring at him after he’d paid, but they both left the shop without paying her any mind.
The notion of being taken away from Potter made Draco panic, this heart beating wildly and the prickle of anxiety running down his limbs. He absolutely could not lose Potter again. Under no circumstances could he allow that to happen.
“…Shouldn’t we call someone to take it away?” The weasel was saying.
‘Of course. Well, I suppose you wanted to spend time with your new girlfriend, since I hear from Teddy she’s started inviting herself ‘round to the house.’ Draco said stiffly. Harry sighed.
‘You really didn’t listen when I told you about Dubai, did you? I was Regional Manager for the UWICEF Gulf Area Office.’ Draco supposed he was expected to understand the significance of that, but he didn’t. He knew what UWICEF was of course – the United Wizards International Children’s Emergency Fund. It had been a favourite charity of his mother’s.
‘He invited you. To our house. His house. His.’ Draco corrected himself, but it was too late. Pansy gave him one of her most piercing looks and Draco felt like she was looking at his soul.
Harry was stunned. He had watched Draco in the Great Hall during every mealtime for seven years and never once had he seen him have less than impeccable table manners. Yet here he was, stood in the middle of Harry’s kitchen, eating standing up, with hummus covered fingers.
“You moved in with Luna. That night at the open mic you were wearing her clothes. It’s different and a wondered why. Did you still live at the manor before?”
‘You got me a cooking lesson with Gabriel Verne?’ Harry grinned at him cheekily.
‘Ah, comme l’auteur!’ Monseiur Verne laughed heartily.
things he had paid no attention to before.
‘Daddy…? Can these plants be used in potions too? I’ve never see any of them before.’ He let Teddy pull him away from Harry and into the Japanese garden.
‘Come off it, Draco. Stop playing games with me.’ Harry shot back.
Granger was already there waiting for him.
before he got his call. It was completely illegal considering they hadn’t actually charged him with anything, but as an ex Death Eater it would hardly make any difference even if he did complain. Which he couldn’t do from a holding cell anyway.
“Was it any use at all?” Harry asked him helplessly.
‘There’s nothing for it. We’ll just have to come out with it all. Teddy knows now, that’s what we were waiting for. The timing…isn’t ideal, but it’ll keep him off your back.’ Harry looked startled.
Hermione picked up the book she’d kept open to show them earlier. She flicked through a few pages quickly, skimming the paper gently with her fingertips as she went. A few stray curls fell from where she’d had them tucked behind her ear, but she didn’t seem to notice them hanging in her face.
He flooed back home to Teddy not half an hour after he left.
Granger watched the two of them as if she wasn’t supposed to be there. He thought about whether she had begun to like him, or whether she had only been putting up with him for the sake of Pansy and the chance to sort this mess out with Potter. She had stayed in the Manor on a number of occasions whilst they’d been planning, but of course Pansy’s guest rooms were at the opposite side of the house from his. And then there was that strange moment the night before when she had thanked him…
This time he didn’t hide his stare when he observed how her face changed in the golden light. It was still a long and pointy face, but the glow highlighted the fullness of her mouth and the curve of her cupid’s bow, the precise arch of her eyebrows and the flawlessness of her skin. He had spent so many years staring at her across the hall at Hogwarts, trying to figure out what she was talking about and what she was planning, and yet he had never noticed any of these things before.
‘Since your ex-husband disconnected your floo and set up Ministry strength wards around your current place of residence.’ Hermione said as she sat down next to Teddy. The table was small and cramped and Draco had once thrown a fit when Hermione had tried to cast some less-than-legal expansion charms.
“You don’t understand,” Harry said quietly. He had only come here to give him his wand back... he should have kept his mouth shut.
‘I told you when you invested in me, I would forever be in your debt. I meant it.’ Going against everything her parents wanted, Daphne set up an elite hair salon on the very outskirts of wizarding London. Her parents, as purebloods equally as strict as Draco’s own family, had cut her off as a result and Draco had invested a great deal in helping her start up years ago. Now the salon was so popular the waitlist could get up to six months long for a consultation.
‘I don’t care about the ‘damn’ case.’ Harry growled. That got Draco’s attention.
It was a coin which looked like a regular galleon, but he knew from experience it was something more. Briefly, he considered that it might have been one of the original coins that the Dumbledore group used in their fifth year, but the chances of Granger having kept those seemed small to him. He had destroyed the ones he’d made himself in sixth year, mostly because they were highly incriminating.
Draco’s head felt like a firecracker ready to explode when he woke up the following morning. As soon as he stirred and turned over, he sneezed with such force he was nearly sick. He’d always had a knack for coming down with a cold at the most inopportune moments – a piano recital, exam week, Christmas Day, you name it. Served him right for standing outside in the middle of a storm.
“Oh. Yes, well. I have a special relationship with the DMLE – they rarely say no to me.”
‘You’re not going to die, are you?’ Teddy asked him, climbing up onto the window seat. There wasn’t quite enough space for the both of them, so Draco pulled his knees up to his chest. Teddy seemed to be over his strange cuddling turn.
Her face lit up with excitement. “Yes! Of course! Why didn’t I think of that?” Draco wanted to say it was because she wasn’t the only one with a brain, but now wasn’t the time to start an argument and she had done a lot of the hard work so far.
‘It’s ok. You’ll learn how to control it better when you’re older. Did it scare you?’ She nodded and sniffled.
‘What’s up with you today, hm?’ Harry asked him. He felt a kiss being pressed into his hair and he bit his lip to hide his smile, even though he didn’t need to.
‘I’m fine, Harry.’ He snapped. ‘Did you see the state of her though? I can’t do it anymore. I can’t keep coming here and seeing the kids all the time knowing that one day they’re going to be the heart of someone else’s family. I’ve lost enough people Harry, you have too. I don’t know why I’ve bonded with her more than the others, I wish I did, but I can’t put myself through it anymore.’
‘Oh. It’s a new phone, it’s called an iPhone 3G. 3G is muggle internet that works wirelessly. It’s supposed to be the fastest one yet. I just got this, but they’ve been out a while now. Apparently, I should have emails on the go and the internet on that old flip thing was useless.’ He went off on a tangent about all the fancy muggle technological things Draco didn’t want to know about. Harry didn’t notice the way the teacup shook in Draco’s long fingers, or the way he was staring at a point just beyond his head instead of looking at him properly.
“Granger, how familiar are you with the third declension?”
‘Yes, Master Harry, Kreacher
Lyra and Sirius were having a heated discussion about whether it was right for her to have invited Remus, even though it was actually Harry’s idea. Sirius didn’t seem angry about it, but Harry could tell he was worried. However, Harry couldn’t contribute to the conversation because he felt as though he’d been struck dumb by a strong
He walked back into the kitchen as if he hadn’t heard a thing and sat down with the pair of them. Teddy sat next to Harry but dashed to the seat opposite Draco, as if he thought he would disappear if he couldn’t see him.
She was really quite fluent in body language. That, or Draco knew her far too well. He supposed that if what Granger had said was true, and a Malfoy really was involved, there would be a paper trail back to the Manor. There was over a century’s worth of material stored up within the house’s many twisting corridors and hidden rooms.
‘Have you met my family? Honestly, you’ve done
‘Draco, it doesn’t have to be like this.’ Hermione sighed sadly. He’d taken her to a new Italian place not far from the Ministry – muggle – and away from prying eyes and ears.
“Oh don’t be like that,” she snapped, “he would do the same and if he tries to say otherwise he’s lying.” Right there and then Draco had a brainwave.
‘I don’t want them to get used to me,’ he admitted. ‘It’s not my job to be here and they need to understand that.’ She sipped her tea and her brow furrowed.
, not to ask for help
‘I know baby, but you need to listen to me.’ She didn’t look the same as she had the last time he saw her. Before she died she’d been painfully thin, her cheeks sunken and her complexion yellowed.
‘I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I swear I didn’t mean to shout at you, you didn’t do anything.’ He pulled the boy into his arms and held him while he cried. He’d been so angry he hadn’t even thought that Teddy might’ve heard everything. He couldn’t bring himself to explain. He didn’t even know how to. It was taking every inch of his self-control to hold himself together.
It felt like no more than five minutes later when he was roused by someone poking him on the cheek. He groaned and tried to turn over, his head feeling woolly, but the poking only got more persistent.
The effect was instantaneous. No sooner had his front paws landed in the dirt and he’d swished his tail once, than the world around him began to blur again. He couldn’t exactly explain how, but the settling of his and Granger’s spell had coincided with his first animagus transformation and something had clearly gone awry.
‘Don’t thank me. I love you and I want to do this. I’m just glad you’re still ok. I promised you I wouldn’t lose you again and I meant it.’ Draco just couldn’t bring himself to say it back, despite the tidal wave of feelings he was feeling towards him. He couldn’t and he wouldn’t say it until he knew Harry deserved to hear it. It didn’t stop him from pressing his lips right above Harry’s heart. Such was the mess that was their relationship. He felt more at peace as he fell asleep than he had in months, and he couldn’t decide why that was.
‘Honestly you two are as bad as each other. How’s anything supposed to work if you don’t talk to each other?’ Draco opened his mouth to respond when a cloud of noise permeated the atmosphere and he realised the rest of the hoard had descended.
‘Harry, no.’ Draco pushed him to arm’s length and reached for the potion. He needed to get himself under control. He downed the potion in one and set the vial back down on the counter.
‘Oh, really? And I suppose you don’t count going to Gringotts and messing with my finances as lying then?’ He didn’t want to get angry again, he really didn’t, but Harry could be so full of shit sometimes.
‘How dare you imply that my relationship with Teddy is less important than yours. Remus and Tonks
‘Dad charmed the baubles to act like bludgers and they chased us around the living room. We used pillows to whack them at each other. It was great!’ Teddy gushed excitedly. Draco dropped half a pastry back onto the plate in his other hand.
‘You do know I’m not actually a bed, don’t you?’ Harry complained as Draco threw a leg over him and moved his arm so he could lay across his stomach.
“Thanks.” He took a gulp even though it was freshly made and burned his tongue. It gave him something to do though because he felt a little awkward sitting in Grimmauld’s kitchen in the middle of the night waiting for someone to address the elephant in the room. He watched as Lyra moved a chess piece carefully – the black pawn turned to the white one diagonally opposite it and sliced through the middle of it, crumbling the white pawn to pieces.
His bite wound throbbed as he wrestled against Aspen’s fervent digging into his pocket while they waited for the house to appear. Harry knocked on the door even though he would usually walk right in, only just thinking about the fact that he hadn’t even told Sirius they were coming.
“You know I’ve never taken a single breath without him?” He says in a small voice. Harry feels as though all the breath has been sucked out of his body. He’s never thought about it that way. “Orion is four and a half minutes older than me, so technically I’ve never known life without him.” It’s a rather dramatic statement considering the mission was over and Orion had simply missed their portkey home, but the principle is harrowing, nonetheless. Harry’s sure he would be a wreck too if he’d shared his whole life with one person that way.
‘Alright. I’m going to make hot chocolate. You choose some film or other.’ He wandered over to the kitchen knowing full well he
To top it all off, he only made it halfway back to the Manor before his dampened protective charms failed. The rain quickly soaked through the silk and drenched his skin. Lightening continued to flash, and thunder continued to roar as he plodded miserably back to the Manor through lawns quickly turning to quagmires. Having used most of his wand’s power on the charms, he had to remove his clothes and dry off the muggle way. By the time he made it back to the warmth of his bed he was shivering uncontrollably. It was gone six in the morning by then, so he felt no guilt in calling one of the elves to light the fire in his room. It left him with little time to sleep, but he would take whatever he could get.
‘He’s useless that one.’ He winked at Ted who glanced at Harry, waiting for him to take the bait.
, but I sincerely doubt he had anything to do with it. From what I know he was an editor for an anti-muggle serial. He’d hardly have been the type to try crossing over to the land of the dead.” Although now that he said it out loud, it did sound rather like a Malfoy pastime.
He re-joined the festivities just as Arthur was teaching them all how to play a muggle game he’d heard about at work called headbands. It seemed straightforward enough. It was at that point Teddy came over for a hug.
‘It’s fine.’ He didn’t want Harry to worry about him for no reason, even though it really did hurt a lot. Draco watched as Harry healed his wound and cast a tergeo on the blood that was already drying. Draco remembered a time when he wouldn’t let Harry anywhere near his left arm for fear he’d remind him about his mark and run off. How the times had changed.
‘I need to rest for a bit. I’m sorry, but I can’t concentrate right now. Let me sleep for an hour and then we can talk? You can explore a little while I’m gone if you want.’ Draco stood up slowly, checking he wouldn’t make himself dizzy. Harry was on his feet in an instant too.
‘Um, yes, I’m fairly confident we did,’ he said. Harry’s awkwardness rubbing off on him. That was a highly unfortunate choice of words considering the circumstances. ‘About that-’ He began.
“Restore it?” Lyra seemed shocked and had gone very white. “Why would you want to do that? Surely now is the time to destroy it.”
‘One of those weekends then.’ Draco said with an amused smile as they stepped into the floo together.
“You broke up with her, Ron. You can’t complain when she’s not here waiting with a cup of tea.” Harry shuffled off into the kitchen to put the kettle on because despite their youth, neither of them could sleep without a cuppa. In a way it was probably a good thing Hermione wasn’t here waiting with a cup of tea because they’d have been kept awake for at least an hour longer listening to another of her rants about not becoming a Stepford Wife.
“Tell you what’s real?” Lyra turned but then stood very still as Harry came to stand in front of her. Her face was carefully blank, and pain clamped down on his chest. He needed to see what she was feeling so he could understand but she almost never gave anything away in her expression and they weren’t yet comfortable enough with each other for him to risk asking.
ago.” If Draco had a wand, he would have hexed her right there and then. But he didn’t. So, he imagined it instead. Whilst that time he made her teeth grow in school was hilarious, now he’d go for something a little more mature – like an instant scalping hex or maybe even
‘There you are!’ He jumped when Harry opened the door to the summer house. ‘You shouldn’t be in here love, your circulation…’
He knew he shouldn’t. He really didn’t care, but he found himself turning to page six anyway. He dropped the other copies on the floor when he saw the host of photographs someone had taken. In the first one it looked as though they were holding hands, but it was also a wintery day and half the crowd was huddled against the cold so it could easily have been the angle. Draco knew how clever those photographers could be when they wanted to. The second photo was glaringly obvious. A piece of Harry’s hair had flopped down over his face as it was wont to do – much to Draco’s annoyance – and Wood was pushing it back off his face, obviously using it as an excuse to run his fingers through his hair. The final one, the one which had Draco’s heart beating at a hundred miles an hour, was of the two of them with their heads bent closely together, almost as if…no. They couldn’t be. Draco wouldn’t be duped by that bullcrap.
The scream haunted Draco all hours of the day and night. Ever since the first dementor attack he had been trying to understand why he heard such a blood curdling sound. In the height of his delirium, he had seen nothing but green eyes behind his own eyelids, unknown voices and heinous laughter echoing around him like ghosts. At one point he’d begged for it to be over, although he’s still not sure whether he actually made a sound. He doesn’t even remember if the dementors came for him.
‘What is it?’
Harry ran one hand through Draco’s perfect blond hair as he continued to run his other gently down his spine. Draco shifted a little and Harry paused, wondering if he’d disturbed him. Draco had always been a light sleeper.
‘Oh. But you just got here?’ Draco didn’t have to look to know he’d upset Harry, but it wasn’t like this was easy for him.
Harry thought back to the last time he saw Remus, but the memory was too foggy for him to see it clearly. “I think he still loves you, you know.” Sirius cleared his throat awkwardly.
He must have fallen asleep at some point because he started when a shadow appeared over his face. His eyes shot open to find Draco standing over him, his blond hair gleaming in the sunlight.
The pain was quite literally blinding. It seems to get worse with each second as his pain receptors continued to fire and the sensation flared. He unceremoniously batted the crazy animal away and curled into the foetal position on the bed, biting his lip so hard to keep from crying out that he drew blood.
He tossed and turned for hours, unable to sleep without the comfort of Harry sleeping next to him. He didn’t realise the difference it made knowing he was just feet away but wasn’t next to him. His words were burned into Draco’s brain, running in a loop through his mind every time he thought he was about to drop off.
‘Less time for what?’ Draco probed him gently. Teddy sometimes had trouble getting his words out when he got worked up.
Adjusting to life with a fox was much harder than Harry had anticipated. Although he regularly checked in with Luna, who was doing an amazing job of teaching Harry how to look after Aspen and making sure he was healthy, there was only so much she could do.
“And you won’t know life without him for a very long time,” Harry reassured him, “if at all!” He quickly amends as an afterthought.
Half way through the meal, Bill turned to Harry. ‘So, Harry, tell me about how the orphanage is doing. Fleur tried to fill me in, but she’d heard it from Mum who heard it from Ron who’d heard it from Hermione and by that point honestly she could’ve been saying any old tosh.’ Harry happily launched into a brief explanation of what they were trying to achieve, and Draco was suitably impressed. He hadn’t seen him so animated outside their own home in a long time.
‘No, because they all remembered exactly what they were doing when they took ill.’ Draco said with a realisation. ‘Oh. I can’t believe I didn’t see this before!’ Draco said with a cry of frustration.
‘I suppose it’s because they kind of look like roses. Only circular windows ever get called rose windows. They’re a particular style of Gothic architecture, so there are a lot of modern windows like these in England because of the Gothic revival. Sometimes they’re called Catherine windows. I think that’s probably where muggles get the name Catherine wheels from.’
“Of course, love.”
‘What about you though? He’s watching out for you, isn’t he? And don’t have a go, I know you’re fully capable of looking after yourself, but mate, you nearly died. You might be decent now but honestly if that had happened when we were at school…I’d have had a great time taking the absolute piss. A Malfoy of all people without magic…’ Draco laughed a quite raucous laugh, very unusual for him, and out of the corner of his eye he saw Harry’s head turn in his direction.
‘Why is it that everyone else hears about this stuff before I do?’ Draco moaned. Slumping down on his stool. Pansy shrugged.
‘Sooo, you and I,’ she said, poking him in the chest, ‘are going to work together to get this damn support network set up. I’m not having magical children disappear into the abyss. Not on my watch!’ There was a glint in her eye, one he remembered from school, except now instead of looking malicious, it was more like a mad genius. He wasn’t entirely sure if that was better.
‘Of course. Anything.’
“Well…I maybe have done some digging…”
Draco Malfoy officially has no dignity left. His meeting was absolutely abysmal. “Thank you, Mr Malfoy, you’ll be hearing from us soon.” Bullshit. In all his years with dealing with Gringotts, he’d never come away without a deal. His father would be completely and utterly ashamed of him.
Still, Draco lived with him. He was there when he woke up in the morning and there when he went to sleep at night. Surely, he would’ve picked up on something. And Wood, he’d seemed genuinely so surprised to think that Draco and Harry- oh. They’d tried so hard to keep it all concealed from everyone except their family, for both Draco’s sake and for Teddy’s. Yet Draco had been so annoyed to see Wood’s smug face that he’d effectively admitted he was back together with Harry. Wouldn’t that be the perfect thing for Wood to run to the press to? He was a social climber – he’d be paid well for the story, he’d get on the good side of the journalists, he’d be credited as the man with inside knowledge. But he hadn’t done any of that. Why? Because it didn’t benefit him. Because if the truth got to the papers, he’d have no leverage to blackmail Harry with. Harry would only play his games if he thought it would protect his family. Why would he do it if there was nothing left to protect?
“Aha! By George I think I’ve got it!” Harry is utterly bemused that Malfoy knows that reference but dutifully returns to Malfoy’s side. His eyes are filled with glittering excitement and for a moment Harry thinks he looks genuinely beautiful, but he pushes the thought aside to concentrate on the reason he’s here.
“Um, yeah I guess.”
“Nothing? Nothing at all? No… I don’t know, pulling sensation? What happens when you touch the wand?” Draco reached out and picked up Potter’s wand. A flare of warmth shot up his hand, but it didn’t go beyond his wrist. It was the same kind of feeling he had when he picked up his own wand.
‘Well now that wasn’t very nice! Come here, I think I need a hug.’ Draco chased him around the kitchen, trying to cover him in flour too, but Harry was way too fast. They both descended into laughter until Harry got hiccups and they had to calm down. They ended up sprawled on the floor, the pancake batter long forgotten.
Transfiguration went on forever and Harry spent most of the class trying to think about what Draco wanted to say to him. Their friendship was less tentative than it had been, but Harry knew he had been holding back a lot. It was difficult to settle into a rhythm of friendship with Draco when Harry spent most their time together thinking about how beautiful Draco was. He didn’t really understand how it had happened but coming back for eighth year had suddenly meant he had time to actually
In the early hours of the morning he’d had enough of pretending he was going to sleep. He got up out of bed and went downstairs to find his journal. It wasn’t the same as a real person, but he supposed it would do. He was surprised to find a light on in the living room.
Draco watched the pair of them talk animatedly as they ate. Teddy didn’t seem nearly as cagy as he had in his letters which Draco was glad of. Still, he had a feeling that he wasn’t telling them something, and the note he’d found in his trunk was currently burning a hole in Draco’s pocket. He supposed it was his own damn fault for wearing skinny jeans. There was no space for anything in any pocket.
“What is it?” Harry tries not to get his hopes up but he thinks of the poor little boy who called out in the dark for ‘the nice Mister Potter man’ who was going to make everything better and his heart constricted in his chest.
‘Really?’ Teddy’s eyes went wide with interest. Ironic considering he’d only just been telling them how he wasn’t all that interested in quidditch. Still, he’d always found it sweet the way Teddy put Harry on a pedestal. Draco had done the same with his own father at that age, although Harry more than deserved his place.
When Ella returned, they bid farewell to Daphne and took the floo back to the orphanage.
‘And yet I’m here.’ Draco’s heart pounded, his head span, his mind was racing at a hundred miles an hour.
‘Well, although there seems to be little progress, there are also no signs of regression, so I think we can call that a win, Mr Malfoy,’ the creepy mediwitch said as she finished probing Draco for what felt like the hundredth time.
Draco was kept in that holding cell.
‘Not today, darling. He’s at home. Where I should be.’ He cast a sideways glance at Hermione who nodded.
“Do you think you would have been burned off the tapestry?” He asked when there was enough space between them to fit a hippogriff. He tried to keep his voice steady but
‘I just wanted to get it right. It would have to go through so much testing and trials, and I’d have needed so many stamps of approval. I didn’t mind testing it out on myself since I would only have me to blame, but if I had opened the shop and hurt someone because I brewed it wrong… It’s people’s lives. They deserve someone who’s dedicated to the cause.’
The house was out of the city, thankfully. Away from prying eyes and traffic noise. Draco had never done that well in London anyway, having grown up in the Wiltshire countryside. He picked up his coat and scarf from the wonky coat rack. He hoped it wouldn’t be too cold outside.
Harry caught his arm and kissed his mark. ‘This didn’t matter back then, and it doesn’t matter now. It’s a complication, it’s not a reflection of who you are. Is that what this is about? You don’t want me there because you think if I know what’s causing all this I’ll leave?’ It felt as though Harry was looking right into his soul and he couldn’t stand it.
He made up his mind to go to the Ministry. It wasn’t exactly a long floo trip from where he was. He had of course been told not to perform any magic unless under supervision of a medical professional which technically meant he was even further away from his goal than he had been when he started.
‘Shut up Ron, you were in bed until eight this morning!’
‘I love you. Both of you. A lot.’ He said.
‘Harry,’ he whimpered pathetically. He shouldn’t have taken this job. Not when he was so set on leaving. He couldn’t be around Harry for more than a few minutes without wishing with every fibre of his being that things could be different.
Draco spend the next few weeks visiting the chateau daily, helping Spungen repair the internal fixtures and the subsidence. He spent hours trawling the narrow-cobbled back streets of wizard Paris, looking for books on architectural charms. He repaired the cracks in the ceilings, the damp on the walls, he reattached chandeliers and high-vaulted curtain rails. He learned specialist restorations charms for the portraits, carefully siphoning off layers of dust and debris without damaging the structure of the paint beneath. He re-varnished the frames and replaced their hangings.
“Come on,” he cooed at his fox, who definitely enjoyed being pandered to. He scooped him up in his arms ready to go when Aspen had one of his funny turns. Except this was worse than any that had come before. He thrashed in Harry’s arms and whipped him ferociously with his tail.
Draco didn’t know what to say. This hadn’t been what he’d expected at all. It didn’t help the pain of knowing that Harry had slept with someone else, he wasn’t sure anything ever would, but he couldn’t blame him for being the victim or for trying to clean up the mess. However badly he’d done it.
‘The first reason why I’m so nervous,’ Harry said from beside him. He didn’t make any move to approach the building, which Draco appreciated. His eyes were trained on the vermillion door – it was so fancy it was partially obscured behind a gate and a security guard. He supposed that was for the bar below ground. ‘If you don’t want to do this, we can go somewhere else. I just thought…I don’t know. I thought maybe if I brought you here and we had the date we were supposed to have, maybe you’d understand how sorry I am about everything I did to you. That, and how serious I am about making this work.’ Draco didn’t want to ask what “this” was. He was scared. He didn’t want Harry to want him just because he was sick, but he also didn’t want to hear him say it if that really was the truth. Did Harry even know? He unlinked his arm from Harry’s but gripped his hand tightly instead.
“Not exactly what I was hoping for,” Harry muttered as he folded the letter back up. He hadn’t expected it to be a walk in the park by any means, but the look on Sirius’ face when he’d brought up Remus had made him think that it was Remus who had ceased contact.
“No, no, it’s fine.” Harry kept a healthy medical supply out of habit now. Ron nodded and left to go to bed. Harry listened as his footsteps retreated down the hall and he turned back to the fox still cowering in the corner. Ignoring the sting of the scratches on his arms a while longer, he tried to coax the poor thing towards the makeshift bed. It wouldn’t budge from the corner.
‘Daddy, it’s ok if you want to go somewhere. I can manage here by myself.’ Draco nearly jumped out of his skin when Teddy seemed to magically appear in the living room. Wait…he hadn’t? No, surely not. Draco had just zoned out.
‘Next week.’ He said quietly.
“What’s going on here?” Remus asked just as Aspen burst free from Ron’s grip. He skittered across the floor towards Harry, who was busy propping himself up on his elbows, feeling awkward and embarrassed. Aspen jumped into Harry’s lap and keened at him, his head tilted to the left and his ears twitching. Aspen had never settled with Ron well, but Harry didn’t find it too coincidental that he had made a run for the floo, until he saw Aspen’s eyes.
Until then Draco hadn’t even known the veil was real. It had only ever been the stuff of legend. The entire point of it, so Draco had heard, was that it was a gateway to the beyond. The one point of contact between the living and the dead. A one-way system. He himself had never seen it, only heard about it from his father, but he never wanted to go near it if it could be avoided. Yet, in some way, Draco understood why Potter had done it. Potter had never expected to survive The Dark Lord, to some extent neither had Draco, and he probably thought he had nothing to lose by trying.
‘Harry, please, I’m sorry I didn’t mean that. It’s just, that’s not fair. You can’t walk into my flat and take my stuff and think that’s ok.’ Draco would discuss this like the adults they were, not the children they behaved like.
‘I often recommend going away somewhere to have talks like those. Find some neutral ground – somewhere where there aren’t any memories or any history.’ Draco wasn’t very good at going to new places. Shouldn’t Smith know that? He was a bloody mind healer after all. ‘I’d also like to try some mind spells. There aren’t any blockages in your mind the way you might expect with an
He didn’t know if it was a delayed reaction to the spell they had tried to cast, or if it was fear alone that had prompted it, but Draco had definitely transformed into his animagus. It meant he would be able to dart and weave around the remaining hit wizards – if he could time it well. Except, as he tried to figure out how to balance with four legs and… a tail? Definitely a tail, his vision blurred and instead of the Veil and the deep amphitheatre-style room, all he could see was bright green eyes. He couldn’t tell if he was still in the Ministry of if he had been transported elsewhere, but Potter was right there, grinning at Draco, opening his arms for him.
‘Something like that!’ She said, her face flush with…alcohol? That didn’t seem very Hermione.
Two hours later and Harry is about to lose his mind. Malfoy has given him the few English volumes that he thinks are relevant, but even those are heavy reading and some of them are in such old English that they may as well be French, or, in the case of one in particular dedication to disembowelling curses, German.
‘No, don’t.’ He mumbled as Draco turned over to face away from him. Before Draco could protest, Harry looped an arm around his waist and pulled him against his chest, tangling their legs together in a way that meant Draco would no doubt wake them both up too much if he tried to disentangle them. As he was enveloped by Harry’s body heat, he felt his resolve disappear. He wanted to push Harry away and tell him no, he couldn’t do this to him, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He should never have agreed when Harry begged him to sleep in their bed because he would never sleep without him.
‘Shit!’ He hissed as he felt a sharp pain and bloody began running down his arm.
‘Hufflepuff is amazing! We definitely have the best house. We get all the extra food from dinner, so it doesn’t get wasted. We give some to the animals of course, and the first years get to go first because sometimes it helps with homesickness. The house elves are super nice to us too because we talk to them because we’re right next to the kitchen. We so have the best house. Oh, sorry.’
He spotted Harry and Teddy loading Teddy’s trunk onto the train. He was clutching onto the owl Draco had bought him from Eeyelops which Teddy had named Eltanin because it was the brightest star in the Draco constellation. He’d been ecstatic when Draco had bought him the eagle owl and hadn’t stopped talking about him since. Draco was just glad he’d have a well-bred owl that wouldn’t drop his letters in the river like Draco’s first ever owl had.
‘Oh.’ He focused on his teacup, drinking it way too quickly.
‘Oh, really? I didn’t know. I haven’t seen him in a long time.’ Outright lie – strike two.
For once Draco wasn’t the one to cry. Oh, the irony. He stood stock still and though his heart shattered at the way Harry’s face crumpled in front of him, he couldn’t cry anymore. He hardly moved and Harry tried to pull him into an embrace. His body was brittle and unyielding as if he’d sustained some kind of stun spell damage. Harry pulled at him harder and he tried to wrench himself away. He couldn’t stand there anymore, he couldn’t listen to his own thoughts anymore. He wanted them to stop.
‘You’re pretty!’ Ella said bluntly. Daphne bent down to her level.
Despite everything, the letter made him smile. There was someone on the other side who knew he was here and who cared enough to write. He was about to pick up the item she’d included, presumably the thing that had made the envelope so heavy, when a cold descended over the room. Draco was struck with the distinct and horrifying feeling that he would never be happy again in his life. The cold dread seeped through his skin and down into his bones and he wanted desperately to be anywhere but there. Quickly, he shoved the letter out of his way under the ‘pillow’ – nothing more than a bunch up old woollen blanket worn thin in parts – that rested on the bare ground.
“It doesn’t specify…” She turned the page over and then back again, “anywhere.” They stood there in silence for a while. Draco felt like an ominous cloud had opened above his head and released a deluge of rain over him. Even if this experiment had been successful, which was improbable, even if they could replicate it, which was unlikely, there was no guarantee there was anything to connect to.
‘No, I didn’t want to make him mad.’ Teddy said quietly.
‘Isn’t that the quidditch player? Oh, look darling, that’s Harry Potter! What a coincidence. You really should go over there. It would do your reputation wonders if you were to finally put all that rivalry rubbish behind you.’ Draco frowned at his mother. His reputation? He didn’t need to fix that, he’d already bloody married the man!
‘He was always going to come back though, wasn’t he? He promised me he’d be here when I came back.’ Teddy’s confidence in Draco was betrayed by the wobble in his voice. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
‘Harry this is neither the time nor the place.’ He repeated his own words back to him.
‘Yeah, you’re right. Do you want to take him?’ Harry turned to Draco. ‘I’m stealing your weekend with him after all.’ Draco nodded but didn’t reply. Harry lifted Teddy off Draco’s arm and he wiggled his fingers to get the blood flowing more quickly. Teddy stirred a little at the movement and Draco debated on waking him up to walk him upstairs. He thought better of it, so he cast a featherweight charm and lifted Teddy up to take him to bed.
‘You can say both. There are no right answers here. Have you considered telling Harry about this? He may not be aware of how you feel about your relationship. I’m sure if he did, he might be able to assuage some of your confusion.’ Draco sighed. He knew he and Harry needed to talk, but the thing was that they did so well without it. Early on they’d become able to understand each other without the necessity of conversation – Harry had never been a man of many words. Draco thought maybe some of that had rubbed off on him.
“You must be mad! We can’t keep a fox in here!”
‘You could be speaking another language right now and I’d still have no idea what you were talking about.’
“How did you know that?”
‘He found a letter, right on the top of the table. In those early days when you were in the hospital, I wrote you letters. I don’t know why, they didn’t help. I thought maybe if I was never going to see you again it might feel like I could still talk to you. It sounds stupid.’ He was pacing back and forth now.
‘No, he doesn’t, he calls me Draco.’ He said cautiously.
‘I’m sorry.’ Harry didn’t release his hold on his hand which was probably a good thing since he really just wanted to bolt.
‘Draco doesn’t have to speak to your teachers when you’ve been naughty, does he?’ Harry gave her his best don’t mess with me look which had terrified Teddy until last year. Ella was unsurprisingly less moved, but she did as she was told and put her book back on the shelf.
‘How do you feel?’
“What-” his question was swallowed by a sound not too dissimilar to a howl which erupted from Aspen. Harry dashed over and unbolted the shutters so that Aspen could see the early morning sky beyond. It was dull as ditch water and the street below was a sludgy mess of sleet and mud where it was lit by streetlamps. Aspen pushed up onto his hind legs and pressed his front paws against the glass, turning back to look at Harry like the answer was obvious.
At that very moment there was a whoosh of magic and a thump from downstairs. Harry’s heart jumped to his throat. Despite how discombobulated he felt, a fizz of excitement bubbled in his chest. Remus could get through the wards; that had to be a good thing, didn’t it?
‘It’s me,’ Harry said quietly. Draco sensed him kneel in front of Draco on the sofa, but he was too tired to open his eyes again. ‘What are you doing sleeping here, hm? You should’ve gone to bed hours ago.’ He was jostled as Harry lifted him up from the sofa and started carrying him towards his bedroom. Show off. Auror training looked good on him, Draco thought idly as he swayed a little in Harry’s arms. Draco used to laugh at him because he was forever forgetting he was a wizard. Most wizards with Harry’s kind of raw power wouldn’t even hesitate to levitate Draco to his bed, but not Harry. Draco would laugh now but he was far too tired and he was quite enjoying Harry’s warmth.
‘I’m just so angry. She’s so clever but she still so small. I didn’t buy the building so that I could watch them have their hearts broken.’ Draco felt him sag against him as his anger dissipated.
“Malfoy,”
‘Daddy will get better, won’t he?’ Teddy was asking Harry. Draco went to cast a muffilato on himself, momentarily forgetting that he couldn’t. He supressed a groan of frustration.
He pushed himself up off Harry’s chest and turned away from him.
Harry shows him where to find his profile with his follows and followers, how to find new blogs to follow, and like and comment on their posts. Then he takes out his phone and shows Draco a miniature version of the webcity they’ve just seen. On the smaller version Harry shows him the button at the bottom of the screen which allows him to ‘upload existing or take new photo’.
“The modern section?” Granger was staring at him with one raised eyebrow. “Seventeenth century, modern?”
Ella was very excited to go to school, but she was so clever she hadn’t been learning very much. She was waiting for the other kids to catch up. In the meantime, Draco had been reading with her as much as he could to keep her intellectually stimulated. She was coming along very well, he was sure her reading age was at least double her actual age.
The first time Harry remembered seeing Malfoy after they left school was one unsuspecting Wednesday evening when Ron had dragged Harry to an open mic night at a newly opened pub on Diagon called The Silver Fox. The room was close with all the people who had packed themselves in like sardines to listen. It was uncomfortable for Harry because he was always anxious about being recognised when he left the safety of his home, but the dim evening light and the sea of people afforded him rare anonymity.
“Good. Because I already invited the were- Lupin to Grimmauld this afternoon.”
‘You want my help sir? Are you sure about that?’ Kingsley sighed over the floo, dropping the professionalism for a minute.
‘I’m sorry…’ He heard himself say but it sounded warped as the cold feeling in his body made his head swim. He’d sounded like his father – he’d always been terrified of turning into his father. He looked down at Ella and tucked a loose curl behind her ear.
‘Hello lovelies! Perfect weather for tinglinger fishing huh?’ Draco simply nodded and hugged her. He knew better than to question Luna by now.
‘I was trying to be thorough.’ Draco sniffed.
Whilst Draco was surprised that Granger had showed up and not one of his few friends, in a way he wasn’t surprised she had taken an interest. Although she claimed not the care about him, she was also Potter’s best friend. As the star legal associate at the best wizarding law firm in the country, she was probably the only friend of Potter’s who had a chance of getting somewhere.
‘Harry!’ He ran over to him, but Smith threw an arm in his way to stop him.
He didn’t know any charm that would alert him to the magical…properties? genetics? characteristics? of the fox, so he wasn’t quite sure what it was he was looking for if he were to try and find out for himself. There was no other option but to ask someone... but who?
‘Draco, I really think that-’
Friday 30
“And you
‘Don’t do thi-’
He had woken up with a terrible crick in his neck, under a hideous Canons blanket, the garish orange hurting his eyes. For a minute he couldn’t figure out why he wasn’t in his bed. The light was streaming through the window, wholly unperturbed by the ravaged curtains that hung there. It was miraculous enough that he had slept through the night, he supposed it would be too much to ask for there to be nothing out of place.
Harry is examining a painting that caught his eye when Malfoy returns, a tea tray floating behind him. It’s of a young girl, maybe eight or ten, with long dark hair plaited and hanging down her left side to her waist. She’s wearing a scarlet winter coat with large black buttons, and sitting portrait style with her hands clasped neatly in her lap. Although her posture is prim and proper, something in her eyes suggests a wildness about her.
She flushed and looked down at the floor. “No, of course not.” But he knew that she was. Still, this wasn’t something she would be able to help him with, even if her worry was genuine.
‘You’re going to be the death of me.’ He muttered.
“Shut up, Potter. I just did what you were too scared to do.” Her grip on his little finger was fierce, but he didn’t shake her off. “You’ll thank me for it later.”
Sirius gave him a sad smile. “Yes, at one time. It was very hard for him, all those years I was in Azkaban. I think he found it difficult to understand how the boy he knew could have done such a terrible thing. I don’t blame him really.”
“Then you have a reason not to slap me again.”
‘Thank you. Send him to the Head Auror’s office as quickly as possible. We’ve no time to lose.’ He was back downstairs in Harry’s office as quickly as the Ministry lifts could take him.
‘Harry, love, I have no idea what any of that means.’ Harry grinned at him.
‘No! Dress! Princess Mumma!’ Rose squealed. She was a child of few, but very concise words.
‘But I-’
He set his tea down on the windowsill and stood to investigate when he saw something he never expected to see again in his life. Every muscle, every ligament, every tendon in his body seized up at the same time.
“I don’t need your gratitude, Granger. I’m not doing this for you.” Despite being able to make out her outline, her expressions were too marred by shadow to be decipherable.
To Harry’s credit, the party had been a raging success. Pansy had brought him a cake from a fancy French patisserie on her way from Dubai. Which quite frankly was the best cake Draco had ever eaten, possibly even better than his wedding cake. Ok no, nothing was better than that. Teddy was fast asleep tucked up next to Draco. His arm was going a bit numb from supporting the boy’s head and neck, but it was worth it if it meant Teddy wouldn’t be sore when he woke up. Rose and Hugo had worn him out terribly.
“Please don’t make this difficult.” She sighed. He didn’t want to make anything difficult, not really, but he’d been quietly seething in isolation for days and he was using every inch of control to remain civil.
When they landed just outside the house, Teddy caught them both in a hug, pushing them into each other and forcing Harry’s arm around Draco’s shoulders to keep them balanced.
“They’re not from these parts, a bit like him.”
‘I’m just so confused Hermione. At the time I felt like Harry was constantly pushing me into doing things and going places that I didn’t want to go. I thought he wanted me to be someone I wasn’t, but now I’m wondering if it was all me.’ He couldn’t get the new feeling of guilt out of his mind.
But he wasn’t going to worry about that now. He was going to the aspen trees to clear his head. It was beautifully sunny that afternoon, and the dappled shade of the tall trees was a welcome relief for his pale skin. What he came to do here most often was to work on his animagus form. Granger had managed to smuggle him the potions ingredients he had needed to brew the potion which prepared his body to transform. It had been a nightmare to brew, but now that he had done it there were just two hurdles left. The first of which, was to figure out what form he was going to take.
‘Push my day back by fifteen minutes. This is important.’ He said to her. She was less than impressed, but didn’t dare question him, and began scrabbling around for random pieces of parchment. Draco knew she wouldn’t last the year out, she was clearly far too poorly organised for such a position.
When they were getting ready to leave, Draco turned to Hermione. ‘Can we talk for a second?’ Harry gave him a nervous look and he pretended he hadn’t noticed.
“I don’t speak Latin but that definitely sounds something like solar and repel.”  Malfoy’s eyes brighten even more and he’s almost bouncing on the balls of his feet. Harry has always known Malfoy is practically a genius, but he’s never really seen it to this extent before.
He wondered if Blaise had done anything with the décor in the salon as he had with the chateau. Draco really should go back there, poor Spungen probably hadn’t seen a soul in months. The place screamed of Blaise’s love of monochrome. White marble tiled floors, black leather chairs, glittering silver mirrors. It was all very upmarket and very muggle. He supposed that was very much the point.
‘Of course I haven’t,’ Draco sniffed. ‘I’ve seen hide nor hair of him since I started. He even got Weasley and Macmillan to take me to that hideous warehouse.’
Harry had been observing the sky. The blue was turning slowly grey and cloud had started looming over them. It seemed Harry would have to take over again soon, although prising Draco out of the driver’s seat would be a challenge in itself.
‘Yeah. I just missed you. I haven’t seen you for hours.’ That made Draco smile and Teddy sat with him for a while before Dominique and Fred Jr distracted him again.
‘Really? Why?’ She looked at him like he was stupid.
‘Harry, baby, you’re hilarious.’ Wood was staggering around, and Draco realised he was incredibly drunk. Didn’t he have family to go to?
He was pulled from his thoughts when the door opened once again.
‘It must just be your all-powerful presence.’ He said seriously. Harry grinned, and Draco kissed the grin right off his face. Kissing Harry had always been his favourite past-time.
A quick scourgify and some essence of dittany later and it looked like his arms would be fine. Ron was already snoring loudly at the far end of the flat and Harry felt bone tired. Of course, as soon as he tried to go to bed, the fox's screeching started up again.
Draco’s coffee tasted like ash. That was really saying something because Draco imported to finest coffee he could legally get his hands on. Thankfully, one of the things Draco hadn’t lost in the divorce was the rights Harry and Hermione had worked so hard to give him after the war. One of those was a license to import potions ingredients from Europe. Draco may have swung the lead a bit by importing coffee beans, but in his defence, he never claimed to be perfect.
‘I really need to go. Thanks for letting me stay.’ She dropped her mug in the sink and kissed him on the cheek before disappearing through the floo, all whilst he didn’t change positions.
Draco remembered sitting in the common room, the fire blazing a lurid green colour after the fourth years had been practising the colour changing charm. He couldn’t remember why the conversation happened, only that his friends had been a lot wiser than he.
‘Damn right. When exactly did you think you were going to tell me you’re still using my name,
“It’s mostly chickpeas and garlic,” Harry told him, thinking about the time he’d tried to make hummus with beetroot. It didn’t go down well…
‘DADDY!’ Draco’s attention was drawn away from Harry when Teddy came bounding up to them. He launched himself into the non-existent gap between the two of them, except instead of feeling the crushing weight of a little boy against his side, Draco felt like he’d been slammed into a side-along apparition completely unawares. He felt the temperature around him drop and he shivered. He’d been dressed for the summer sun and that been ripped so cruelly from him.
‘What the hell? Why didn’t you say anything? Draco, this is amazing! You can do magic!’ Draco gave him a weak smile. He hadn’t shown anyone for a reason, because it wasn’t as black and white as that.
He was furious. Apparently, the agreement that the Prophet wouldn’t report on Draco dissolved along with his marriage. His head fell into his hands as he realised that the goblins would absolutely have heard about this and Draco was absolutely not getting his loan.
‘Love you.’
‘You’ve got to stop being so hot-headed.’ Draco told him. ‘Between the pair of us, Teddy’s going to turn out an absolute headcase.’
‘I suppose I should get up.’ Harry brought their hands up to his face and kissed the back of Draco’s hand.
‘Minister.’ Draco greeted formerly whilst trying to disguise his current attire.
“You should be the one telling me that.” She snapped. He couldn’t quite tell if she was referring to the noise that had startled her, or the whole affair with him taking ill. Either way, he couldn’t hide the twist of a smirk forming on his face. He didn’t know how he felt about the fact that he enjoyed her being annoyed at him. Only Malfoy could actually be angry instead of worried. Or maybe for her they were the same thing.
Teddy lived with Harry now that Andromeda was getting on a bit. Draco had been furious when Harry had moved him in without consulting Draco first, but Draco hadn’t been able to stay angry for long, not when Teddy was so cute, and Harry was so smitten. The poor woman hadn’t been spared in any way though, since her home had become a half-way house so that Draco and Harry needn’t see anything of each other.
‘Of course not. I just wasn’t feeling very well that’s all. I’m fine, you don’t have to worry.’ Draco did his best to reassure him, but it wasn’t really his strong suit.
Where would he go? What would he do? He really did love Harry, even if he was a world class tool. When he wasn’t so angry and so stoic, he loved harder than anyone he’d ever met and would ever be likely to meet again. He didn’t want anyone else. He wanted the Harry he fell in love with all those years ago.
“I don’t get it,” Ron said bluntly. Harry sighed. He had known it would be a long shot, and now he had exposed his growing madness to everyone who was important to him. But then, an idea formed in his mind.
“I think abandoning the Dark Lord in the middle of the biggest battle the wizarding world has ever seen is probably enough for a hefty singe. Luckily for me there’s no one left to do it.” The casual way in which she said it while leaning one shoulder against the windowpane was at odds with the way the blood froze in Harry’s veins. He shot across the room with such speed that the room span so fast his head might have toppled right off his shoulders.
Should he confront Harry? Confront might be the wrong word. He didn’t know Harry had even done anything, all he had were easily misconstrued photographs. He should say something though, shouldn’t he? After all, if Harry had nothing to hide, he’d get a simple response and that would be that. But then, would it make Draco look paranoid? Would it make him seem even more ridiculous? What would Harry think of him if he immediately thought the worst of him when in fact, he’d done nothing at all?
“Shit!” He hissed, wiping his hand with his napkin and peering with dismay at his reddened hand. The pitfalls of highly sensitive skin.
He’d decided he didn’t want their creations to be the same, so he chose to fill his with marmalade as would have been common in the 18th Century, whilst Harry was going for the modern crème pâtissière.
“Explain what?” His best friend asked him. It struck Harry that this was possibly the longest he’d kept something from Ron, and it wasn’t a nice realisation.
considering the alternatives? Am I the
‘Draco…?’ Harry’s hand was on his shoulder and Draco was snapped back to reality. He didn’t say anything. Instead his gripped the front of Harry’s jumper and kissed him forcefully.
‘Come here.’ He held a hand out to Draco and motioned for him to join him on the other sofa. Draco took his offer and slunk down next to him. ‘Listen to me. You’re making a big step coming here and doing this, and I want to help you the best way I can. Biting my head off isn’t going to get us anywhere, so just take a deep breath and let’s talk.’ Damn Harry for being so right all the time, it made Draco’s insides crawl. And why did he have to sit there looking so beautiful when Draco just wanted to be mad at him.
‘Have you changed your mind about talking to me about Harry?’ Smith asked him ten minutes in. He’d been told if he walked out of another session before his hour was up, he’d be going back to the ward and would not be allowed to leave until his next healer appointment.
faith in me.” It was then that he noticed an amused smile pulling at the corners of her mouth, and he realised she was having him on.
Even though he had come here for a specific purpose, and even though he should have been responsible and kept his visit short, he found himself desperate to extend the time he had with Malfoy. It was the longest they had ever been alone together, and it was also the longest period of time she’d actually acknowledged his presence. He wanted it to mean something.
He was about to give the wand back when he realised something was off. “Hang on… you still look like you!” He was filled with panic that her Polyjuice had worn off without her noticing, thereby quashing their rescue mission before they’d even started.
‘I’m really proud of you, you did really well today. I know it must have taken it out of you.’ Harry said as he stroked Draco’s back gently. He could’ve dropped off to sleep right there but he couldn’t help but preen at the praise.
‘H-h-h-hannah s-scribbled all over m-my new pu-pu-’ Draco looked down to the table where there was a children’s crossword puzzle book with neat letters written in the blank squares with a giant splodge of crayon in the middle of the page.
After their lesson, they were seated in the corner of the main shop where they could eat and drink coffee. Really it was lunchtime by the time they were finished but Draco didn’t really care. He watched the tourists amble down the cobbled streets looking equal parts excited and lost. There were a lot of them around here since they weren’t far from Notre Dame.
He didn’t argue, however. He went upstairs and pulled out the bespoke suit he’d bought not long after the wedding. He’d had to alter the tailoring charms around his arse slightly since, but he’d never tell a soul that – not even Harry. It wasn’t exactly important anyway, he’d always been built like a string bean compared to Harry’s more toned physique. Besides, it wasn’t as though Harry would complain about there being a little more of Draco’s arse than before.
‘Is it that bad? It might be selfish of me but I just…I don’t- I don't think I’m ready to share you with the world again just yet.’ His head swam with all the things he used to be accused of – of corrupting Harry or using him to improve his reputation or even using him to get into the healer training programme. Perhaps that hurt the most of all. He worked damn hard for those exams, he was more than capable of getting in without help from anyone.
‘What the hell is this?’ A file was shoved directly into his chest and he nearly dropped it as the force of the impact knocked the air out of him. Draco immediately recognised it as his Ministry personnel file. He opened it and on the first page was his basic information and a thankfully updated headshot. It had originally been his Azkaban mugshot, not his finest hour.
‘I see.’ He said stiffly.
‘I’m surprised you came Draco.’ Neville said. They weren’t exactly friends, but they’d learned to be civil over the years.
‘You didn’t.’ His voice sounded as hoarse as Harry’s had earlier and no doubt he looked a mess. Harry’s head snapped up in his direction and his eyes widened. They’d lost their vibrant green shade and instead were ambery in the lamplight.
“Ah, Mr Malfoy, so kind of you to join us.” There was a man standing over him, peering down like he was examining a specimen. Draco’s instinct was to fight his restraints and get away from him. He thrashed against invisible barriers as he tried to free himself, but all it did was make his head swim and cause the man in front of him, presumably someone from the DMLE, to laugh cruelly. So much for a post-war reform of the system.
“Ok, good. Now you need to dip the clutch again and change into third.” They were driving down the country roads on a particularly warm spring day. Draco had been very against the idea of a car, but Harry really wanted one. Of course, when Harry ignored Draco completely and went and bought one, Draco couldn’t handle not partaking in the fun.
It wasn’t the same now though. He supposed much of that feeling must’ve come from knowing Harry was here waiting for him. The house hadn’t been enveloped in magic long enough to be quite as sentient as the manor or the Black estate, but Draco thought he could feel a little something from the wards, as if they were happy to see him again. After all, he helped create them.
‘Granger don’t tell me you’ve taken a job being Kingsley’s lacky. You’re better than that!’ He couldn’t believe his ears.
‘Open the paper and tell me what I saw isn’t real.’ Draco’s voice wavered and Harry went very quiet. He unfolded the paper slowly and turned the pages over as though trying to put off the inevitable. The room was very still, so much so that they would have heard a pin drop. Harry’s face was blank as he stared down at the photographs on an endless loop.
That was odd. It was the time the Dark Lord had been living in his house, eating at his table, sleeping in his wing. He didn't recall the last time he had reviewed those memories, even though they were important. Wasn't that simply because he'd been focusing on understanding his divorce? Come to think of it, he didn't exactly remember much about that time-
‘My father was a terrible person. He put us all in danger and he deserved what he got.’ That was usually all Draco had to say on the matter.
There was nothing, but there was pain. It was like he’d been thrown into the fiery pits of hell and left to burn out. White hot lances of pain whipped at him from all angles and he imagined this must be what it was like when a star died.
? I-”
‘He had…strict principles we were expected to adhere to,’ he said eventually. He tried to say as little as he could to satisfy his healer without having to say much. It didn’t seem to work.
‘Sorry, I just thought you’d appreciate the help,’ Harry said sheepishly, rubbing at his neck as he always did when he was nervous. ‘I’m not telling you anyway, you’ll see when we get there.’ Damn Harry and his bloody surprises.
The following week, he started his new job at the ministry. Harry had given him his own lab in the bowels of the Ministry. Draco would’ve thought that Harry was being generous in giving him the most state-of-the-art lab money could buy, but he knew there was no coincidence that his lab was as far away from Harry’s office as physically possible.
“Are you thinking about Potter again? Or your little project? I really can’t decide which is worse. Probably mooning over Potter, but then I would so love to watch you coughing up fur balls.” A couple of weeks ago, Pansy had showed up unannounced, again, and found Draco researching animagi. It was an ongoing project he had begun months ago but which had been fruitless so far.
‘I swear you have more of these things than Hermione.’
‘No.’ He admitted. He didn’t know how to explain the pain in his chest when Harry reacted like that. Did he really think Draco had stolen from him? ‘But none of this started after the divorce, it happened after my magic was separated.’
Draco was only allowed to go home after he’d been cleared by a mind healer. It had been decided that the potions were doing little to help his energy levels, and the focus instead should be on his mental healthcare. Draco thought it was bullshit really. He had anxiety, that much was true, but the idea that he was stopping his own recovery? Ludicrous.
Before Draco could even think about the inappropriate nature of the gesture. He pulled one of Harry’s hands away from his face and held it.
‘Our kids?’ Harry’s smile faded and suddenly the atmosphere in the room changed. Draco was not happy that he was confined to a hospital bed and couldn’t run away from the wave of emotion that came across him when Harry looked at him that way; intensely and unblinkingly, with that trademark sparkle in his green irises.
“You need the Manor library,” Malfoy finished for him. They had been through a whole pot of tea and then another whilst Harry had explained to Malfoy what research he had done and what he had found so far, which was practically nothing.
“Thanks,” he muttered groggily. Trying to sit up properly he became aware of a weight on his lap. Settling his glasses on his nose properly, he realised there was a pair of large, molten silver eyes staring at him unblinkingly. They almost glowed in the semi darkness and despite being a source of calm to him just days ago, in the near dark it was clear they were the exact same eyes he had stared into through the misty archway in his dreams and that made him uneasy.
‘Shh, shh. I’m here, it’s me. You’re ok.’ Harry whispered in his ear as Draco tried too hard to regain control of himself. He was gasping in breaths too quickly and he was at a high risk of hyperventilating, but Harry stayed whispering in his ear, acting like an anchor for him to hold onto.
‘So you wouldn’t know about that article then.’ He pointed to the crumpled copy of the
Granger pondered this for a second before turning her gaze away from the Veil. “I say the wand. There’ll be no point trying it on you if the magic doesn’t take to the wand.” Draco nodded, trying to ignore the feeling that he was being submerged in water. He really didn’t like it down here.
Draco had nearly made his way to the lifts when a firm hand clamped down on his shoulder. He wheeled around, his wand out ready to defend himself, only to find Harry standing entirely too close.
‘Don’t be sorry. I’m here, I’ve got you. We’ll bring Teddy home to see you. I promise he understands. No one is angry with you, ok? We love you. I love you. Shhh, shhh. Please don’t cry. I’m right here.’ Draco only held onto him tighter and let Harry whisper in his ear everything he needed to hear.
hugs from me though. It’s the least you can do.’ She smiled at him widely.
‘I’m sorry. It was bad, I get it. I just know how much it means to you that you feel like you earn your living but the thing is, you don’t have to do it all on your own, it’s ok to let other people do things for you once in a while.’ Draco still didn’t think Harry had done the right thing, but he could understand that he meant well.
‘You would’ve come?’ Harry asked hopefully. Draco thought about it.
Except Potter hadn’t had to deal with the consequences. That was left for everyone else.
“Aren’t you going to read me my rights?” It was hard for him to keep his chin up, his head feeling as heavy as a bludger, but he couldn’t help trying to maintain his dignity for a little while longer.
‘I’m sorry. I don’t like to think about it. He’s all I have.’ He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He was doing that a lot, but it didn’t always help.
‘Draco? Have you got a minute?’ Harry’s head popped around the edge of the door. Draco was disappointed to see he’d finally shaved. He’d gotten used to the way his stubble had made his jawline look so sharp it could cut glass.
“What are you doing?” He asked her, much like he had a before when he had felt the same groggy feeling at the flat and she had fetched him water.
‘Oh dear, Mr Potter. You’ve got yourself into a right state. What’s the matter? You seem to be getting much better to me, that’s good, no?’ She smiled at him kindly and his insides cramped with guilt. He didn’t deserve niceties.
He was waiting in the reception area of the private wizarding clinic in Harley Street. The whole building was under muggle repellent charms which acted much like disillusionment charms except they didn’t deceive witches and wizards.
‘Alright, alright, we’re coming.’ Harry said exasperatedly. Draco snorted because he was in fact an over-grown child. ‘Shut up you,’ Harry hissed in his ear before he let him go. They followed Teddy downstairs, having agreed to take the floo to The Burrow.
‘Mr Potter,’ he found himself correcting automatically. He didn’t really care, but she’d had her face within an inch of his own for the past fifteen minutes and she had the direst case of halitosis Draco had ever had the misfortune of encountering.
‘I don’t care about that. I care about not telling you Harry’s business. He has enough to worry about without me discussing him behind his back.’ Draco would not compromise on this. He wouldn’t.
‘I’m sorry your highness. You’re free to go and get your beauty sleep.’ She looked as though she was going to smack him in the arm until she realised he was back to being an invalid and thought better of it.
He proceeded to read her the first three pages whilst she sat curled up in silence in his lap. He’d never known her be so quiet, although it seemed she’d finally calmed down, so he risked broaching the topic.
‘Help me pick out some vials and a storage case?’ He asked Teddy, turning his back to the miserable witch. He had no time for negativite nellies at the minute.
“Yes?” They were interrupted as Tressy, with three other elves behind her like a tiny angry mob, appeared in the room with a crack.
‘Don’t worry about it, he’ll get used to you. Just keep doing what you normally do, and he’ll adjust.’ She gave him an encouraging smile and he tried to believe her.
‘Oh yeah, there you go again with
‘Harry sent the cavalry?’ He asked, his voice sounding bored. Hermione whipped around. She was dressed oddly formally for a Saturday afternoon in a pale pink evening dress and dangling diamond earrings far too fancy to have been bought by a Weasley.
‘You and Potter are on again then? I have to say I’m surprised.’ Daphne said to him as she put the bottles back on the shelf and rinsed the sink out. Draco raised his eyebrows at her.
He imagined Potter flying besides him, the breeze making his wild black hair look even more ridiculous. His glasses would slide down his nose and he would waver slightly left each time he pushed them back up with his forefinger. Draco remembered all of this. He had memorised Potter’s every move on a broom from the very first time he had seen him fly – when he’d had Longbottom’s stupid Remembrall clasped tightly in his hand. What a little shit he had been back then.
Harry expected Sirius to take them into the kitchen where they usually sat together, but this time he led them up to the room where Harry remembered the Black family tapestry was, although he didn’t come up here much.
His heart nearly stopped mid-beat when his eyes landed on a new face and a new name. Same eyes, same hair colour, same pointed features, just as he had expected. The name beneath the face read
“What is it?” Draco peered into the pot as if it would attack him.
‘Are you sure?’
‘Thnks.’ He mumbled. He heard Harry turn to leave and he reached out with an arm that felt too heavy and a bit fuzzy. ‘Stay,’ he said. Harry paused, and Draco didn’t dare try to open his eyes.
‘You really want to share this…with me?’ Harry spun in circles as he took it all in.
“She knows that. And she also knows that if something happens to you, that will be her too.” Granger pursed her lips as if she hadn’t considered that before.
‘Honestly, Harry. Only you could forget you have an Order of Merlin!’ He said once he’d caught his breath.
He turned over as slowly and carefully as he could possibly do so, not knowing if his bed partner was a heavy or light sleeper. Normally, he’d have gotten straight out of bed, collected his things and gone, without a second look. This was different; he was hurting from saying his goodbyes the day before, and he’d be so alone when he left that he just wanted to soak in this feeling, even if it was fake affection. Nothing could have prepared him for the sight he saw.
‘But you always buy Dad’s present first? It’s like…tradition.’ The puzzled look on Teddy’s face was adorable. Draco felt even more guilty following it though, he’d never had trouble buying Harry presents before.
‘So, how’s that project of yours going?’ Ron asked him after his wife had disappeared inside the house. Draco started.
‘I know, I know, you don’t have to explain.’ Harry told him quietly and for once, Draco was inclined to believe him.
“I didn't noticed until you said it, but I’m shattered.” Ron yawned loudly and stretched his arms high above his head. Harry was exhausted too and glancing at the clock he realised it was already nearly two in the morning. He was sure it hadn’t been that late when they’d got back.
Ouch Blaise, too close to home.
Forty minutes later and Draco had fluffed every cushion and pillow in the house, started cooking a chicken and prepped enough veg to feed the five thousand. And yet Harry and Teddy still weren’t home.
And so, at the end of Draco Potter’s agreement with Hermione Granger-Weasley, Draco found himself lounging in the living room of his old marital home, surrounded by the best, and the worst, of his memories, and he realised the only thing he’d ever needed was the man who lay with him, ready to risk it all for one last chance at happiness.
‘I don’t want to,’ Teddy mumbled. Curling up into Draco like a small kid. His heart ached, it really did. He was such a sweet boy.
‘That doesn’t look good.’ He murmured. More for himself than for Harry.
Harry thumped his head against Draco’s chest and groaned.
‘I promise nothing ever happened with Teddy. I’m just on edge because he went to Hogwarts. He doesn’t know a thing I swear. Please don’t take him from me.’
Gritting his teeth, he flung the bedsheets off and got out of bed. The clock on his bedside table read just after five in the morning and he groaned miserably. This wasn’t an opportunity he could afford to miss however, so he dragged himself downstairs, wrapping a silk dressing gown around him as he went. He had kept most of his dressing gowns as his mother embroidered his name beneath the family crest herself and they always reminded him of her, but they provided little to no warmth, especially in the early hours of the morning when the air was bitterly cold.
“What are you-” he croaked.
best friend! You might be in love with him but he sure as hell doesn’t love you!” Her words sliced through him his Aunt Bella’s dagger. He knew she was lashing out because she was scared, but he could feel his own anger surging upwards from where he’d been keeping it locked away while he focused on everything else.
‘Where’s Harry? Hermione, where’s Harry? I have to apologise. I left him to deal with Teddy again. God they’re both going to hate me. Right after I accused Harry of-’ He’d dreamt about Harry and Wood. He still didn’t even what was going on between them. Fuck he’d made such a mess of things again.
‘I’m sure he’d much rather you be here getting better than you see him off to school and make yourself sicker, yes dear? I’m positive he loves you very much. As does that husband of yours. He’s been here every day. Talked to you for hours while you were awake, even when you had no idea what was going on. He adores you, you know.’ Draco didn’t remember being awake except when Pansy was here.
When Draco stirred the following morning, his warming charms had dropped overnight, and his body temperature potion had worn off. Hermione was already up and dressed and finishing her morning tea, eager to get home. He didn’t blame her; international portkeys were a drain on your magic and she probably missed Hugo and Rose terribly. Draco was the same with Teddy when he was that age.
Draco frowned. ‘Mastered a wand? When did you master my wand?’ He flushed embarrassingly as the innuendo, feeling even more ridiculous when Harry wiggled his eyebrows at him.
Even the sugar snaps weren’t a distraction for long. Aspen loudly chewed his way through one and a half before he sensed Sirius approaching, at which point he snarled and launched himself across the room.
‘They do still like you. You didn’t do anything wrong. Sometimes grown-ups have important things to do. They had to go away, and they know how much you love your friends and they didn’t want you to miss them.’ Her wispy little eyebrows furrowed, and her lips thinned.
‘This variety is untraceable in the bloodstream by diagnostic magic if combined with the right ingredients. Someone was definitely keen to cover their tracks. I have the magical signature on file, so it will be traceable if anyone comes across it again. I’ll need to consult with the healer overseeing the patients in order to reverse engineer a cure.’
‘Draco are you even listening? You’ve been standing still a long time. Is everything alright?’ He jumped when Harry pulled the shower curtain back. The water was spraying all over his body although he obviously didn’t care since he was still in his boxers. Draco turned to repeat – one must never wash one’s hair only once. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.
‘I’m fine. Just not sure I’m ready for everyone.’ He said honestly.
“It’s funny you should come today of all days. I was just sorting through that awful library, throwing away some of my family’s gruesome dark magic books.” Sirius seemed to shiver, but Harry might have imagined it. “I found a spell I thought I might use to restore the tapestry.”
‘I bet you know a hell of a lot more than I do,’ he said nervously. Draco frowned.
“I thought about that, but I also think burning people from a tapestry because they don’t share the same ideals as us is a dangerous route to take. I never got on with my family, and you both know how much of a disappointment I was to my mother, but I want to remember how far we have come since then.” Harry had never really thought about it that way, but he supposed if people forgot why the war happened, there’d be no reason why it couldn’t happen again.
He slid across the bed, closing the distance between himself and Harry, and plastered himself against Harry’s bare back. He always found it amusing that Harry either slept in his boxers or completely naked no matter what time of year it was. It looked ridiculous compared to the full-length pyjamas Draco preferred in the winter. He put an arm over Harry and rested his hand against his chest, hoping his hands weren’t too cold against his skin. He pressed a kiss against his shoulder and tried his best to keep himself together. Tonight wasn’t about him.
His arm throbbed where Aspen had bitten him. He didn’t think he had drawn blood, but that didn’t make much difference to the pain level. Belatedly, he realised he hadn’t cast the regular disillusionment charm. Although it was perfectly legal to keep a domesticated fox, he guessed most people wouldn’t be accustomed to him carrying one around the streets of London. It was difficult, but he managed to grip Aspen with one arm just long enough to discreetly slip his wand out and cast the charm.
‘I’m not twisting your words, Harry.’ Draco said calmly. ‘I’m just pointing out that in an amicable divorce you should do all those things. If you have a problem with that then we can re-negotiate.’ He watched as Harry’s anger turned cold.
‘I started doing some research after Draco told me his mind healer wanted to try mind spells on him.’ Harry looked at Draco.
‘No, I do. It was selfish of me to make you stay in a place you weren’t happy in, I didn’t realise how bad things really were. I would never have suggested it if I’d known.’ Hermione had come to visit him after a three-day conference in Brussels where she’d been debating whether European magical authorities had the right to share information on known criminal activities between states, or whether it was an infringement of human rights of people who may be suspected but not charged with anything. Draco thought it was fascinating, and he admired her drive and passion on the subject immensely.
‘He’ll be ok, won’t he?’ Draco didn’t know why Harry was looking to him for this. Draco had never been the strong one of their relationship, he’d never been nearly as self-assured, despite what people thought. He’d rebuilt his entire life since the war and then again since the divorce and he wasn’t sure how much more he had left in him.
He recognised the handwriting on the topmost envelope – he could spot Hermione’s neat cursive easily amongst the average chicken scratch print any day. He’d have thought Hermione would’ve floo called if there was something important to say, so he eagerly pulled open the letter to find out what might’ve convinced her epistolary communication was better. He took a seat on the nearest armchair, although it wasn’t the most comfortable.
With a pop they arrived at their destination and the breath was knocked from his lungs. They stood on the corner of the very restaurant they had supposed to have visited the night they had their last fight as a married couple. He was lost for words. His throated tightened and his eyes burned with tears. Why would Harry bring him here of all places?
“Pretty much.”
, is the least of your worries right now. The first thing we need to do, is to figure out what’s going on with you. This thing,’ he trailed his fingertips across the blackened skin, ‘will sort itself out later. One step at a time.’ His fingers trailed down to Draco’s palm where they rested for a second before he took his hand back.
“Well, figure something out, would you?” Ron dumped his cereal bowl in the sink. “The sooner the better,” he added, walking out the front door and letting it slam shut behind him and shaking the whole flat. Harry frowned at the hallway. Ron was often grumpy in the morning but never quite that brusque.
‘Since when did I ever do anything the way I’m supposed to,’ he smirked. Harry briefly glanced sideways at Teddy who was staring at them with his mouth agape like a fish.
department and you are
“Really? I suppose it makes sense; fire-breathing dragons, Gryffindors. You Gryffindors are pretty hot-headed… but I can pick something else if you want…”
She slammed her teacup down and he heard the clink of a hairline crack forming in the china. Luckily it wasn’t the antique set.
‘No.’ He said quietly, forcing his breathing to remain steady.
‘Dad said I had to let you sleep longer, because you need lots more energy than I do. We decided we should have breakfast in bed.’ Teddy pointed at the tray of food enthusiastically and Draco couldn’t help but feel his excitement was infectious. He looked between the two most important people in his life and a lump formed in his throat. These people really cared about him – as much as he cared about them. They loved him and they wanted to spend their Christmas with his sorry arse.
‘Something that’s second nature. Ok.
magic? It seemed pretty magical to me.”
“You just don’t understand, Potter. Hummus is life.” No, Harry didn’t understand, but what made matters worse was the frankly indecent sight of Draco licking hummus off his fingers. Even though it should have been disgusting, seeing Draco’s tongue moving like that made Harry’s mouth go dry.
‘Neither of those people were Death Eaters.’ The
‘I know I wanted to wait until you were better before dealing with him, but that was mainly because I wanted to protect you from the added stress. But you know anyway now so…’ He turned to look at him and found his expression full of hope.
‘Ten? What does that feel like? I don’t think I’ve slept later than six for the past three years!’ Weasel laughed.
‘Sorry. It’s just a lot to adjust to, you know? He’s up to his eyeballs in orphanage stuff and Teddy’s just got back from Hogwarts, so there’s a lot to keep up with.’ Ron nodded.
Suddenly, with an outburst from Pansy, time started moving at the right speed again.
He took a memory vial from the back of his cabinet. It was one he’d never reviewed at all, it was even collecting dust. There was a ring on the shelf where the vial had stood, and he was hit with a realisation that whilst he’d viewed his and Harry’s last fight a hundred times over, he’d never confronted some of the harder parts of their relationship.
Harry tried very hard not to look at her. “Oh. Uhhh, I could just call him fox?”
“You said the victims have an adverse reaction to sunlight,” Malfoy says gruffly, his voice noticeable uneven. Harry is please when he keeps his sleeves at his elbows and walks over to a bookcase in the corner. It’s not easy to work out whether he’s doing it because he’s looking for something or if it’s because he wants to get away from Harry.
‘Well, aren’t you going to say it back?’ Draco looked at Harry who gave him a shit-eating grin, the bastard.
‘Look, I- shit. I slept with him, ok? But it was just the once! And it was a mistake! I even-’
‘I see,’ said Smith, ‘and that is your primary concern? What about yourself? Would Harry want you to sit in silence or would he want you to get better?’ Draco was starting to feel cornered.
“Uh, Malfoy,” Harry says as he opens the first of the books. It turns out to be a handwritten manuscript.
, but his own house elf was a whole other matter.
‘Calm down Draco, it’s nothing like that. I bought an old manor house I’d like to turn into an orphanage.’ He said. Draco’s eyebrows shot up towards his hairline and it made his head ache, but it was worth it because Harry manage to elaborate. ‘I decided quite a while ago that I didn’t want to be an auror anymore,’ he began. ‘Then the Head Auror opportunity came up and I took it on as a favour to Kingsley. He didn’t have anyone else who was capable of taking on the role and I couldn’t leave him in the shit like that.’
He collided with Harry violently, Harry’s arms bracketing him like he knew he wanted to run. He beat against his chest and if he’d had the presence of mind, he’d probably have known he was leaving bruises Harry certainly didn’t deserve.
‘That’s fantastic!’ He exclaimed, smiling brightly. Both Pansy and Harry seemed pleased with his reaction, which was good considering he normally reacted very badly to surprises.
‘Draco, I always piss you off.’ Draco lifted his feet from Harry’s lap and repositioned himself so that he could plaster himself to Harry’s side. Harry wrapped an arm around him and Draco was hit with an unexpected feeling of coming home.
‘What kind of dream?’ Draco stopped to smell a rose bush. He’d always loved the smell of roses, even if it was incredibly cliché. He stepped away and took a deep breath of the fresh air. It was earthy and clean, and he felt himself unwind. He had never been a massively outdoorsy person, but he did love gardens. Ever since he was a child and he’d spent time in the Manor gardens avoiding his father… ‘Draco?’ Harry prompted. He shook his head slightly.
He went back to Regulus’ room, but Lyra wasn’t there. She must have gone downstairs, so he decided to find some clothes and join her. Aspen started screaming at him the moment he entered the room, but he didn’t want to give him any attention. He’d decided to be needy at the most inopportune moment and Harry needed focus so he could figure out what he wanted to do next. Tell Lyra everything is what he should do, what he had tried to do, but he wondered if the moment had passed. Even if it hadn’t, there would be people downstairs besides Lyra and he wasn’t sure he wanted to announce to half the people he knew that he was slowly losing his marbles.
‘I don’t need to go home, sweetheart. This is home.’ He watched Teddy’s face very carefully. At first, he started to frown. His brow didn’t quite furrow properly before surprise registered.
“If you’re going to be like that, I’ll walk out that door and never speak to you again.” He snapped, standing up and going to get his coat. He wasn’t ready to brave the freezing November day, nor did he want to come away empty handed, but he wasn’t going to enable her ignorance.
The Autumn was perishing in Paris. Draco grabbed the thick woollen cloak he’d last used as part of his disguise in that strange London clinic. He jumped as he heard a clatter and he looked down to find the bottle of pills Harry had been given when they’d gone. That was strange, he could’ve sworn he’d checked them in as evidence. He looked at the bottle and noticed some of them were missing, which were probably the ones he’d had sent to the lab for testing. He slipped them back into his robe pocket and made a mental note to owl them to the Ministry the next day after he’d bought himself a new night flying friend. He’d finally decided he had enough money to bother investing in a new owl.
His body felt too foreign as he watched Potter stumbling about the kitchen trying to figure out what to do with a fox. Draco took the time to assess the sensations he had been barraged with when he had initially transformed. The almost-extrasensory perception that came with his sharpened sense of smell and vision, the new centre of gravity and crazy agility. It wasn’t exactly an unpleasant feeling, to be a fox, but he also hadn’t yet learned his vulpine personality, and he could feel the fox’s instinct to run vying with his own to stay.
‘He’s Belgian Potter you heathen. Cut him some slack anyway,’ he said tiredly, ‘it’s not easy being the most intelligent person in the room. He has to let off some steam somehow.’
Suddenly bright green light exploded through the room. It filled every crack and every corner and reminded Draco sickeningly of the Avada Kedavra curse. His father laughed manically as a scorching hot pain lanced through Draco from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. He heard himself scream in agony as he staggered, unable to take his own weight. He desperately fumbled around in the green for his wand, he didn’t remember dropping it. All he could think was that he needed Harry. Something like this wasn’t normal, even by wizarding standards, and Draco needed Harry.
nicely.” He smiled at her sweetly.
By the time the sun was setting, Draco was exhausted. He found himself sitting on the swing seat at the western end of the garden. He’d chosen to put it here because it meant he could see Harry in the kitchen, Teddy playing in the sand pit they’d built him when he was small, and he’d still have a perfect view of the flowerbeds.
He checked back in on Teddy as he left the bathroom, but he hadn’t stirred. Draco paused for a minute to watch the steady rise of his back. His hair was still Draco’s shade of blond and Draco took a minute to think about how lucky he was that he had such a kind hearted little boy in his life who loved him blindly.
Eventually his potions took the edge off the morning’s shock, and Draco wondered how cold the winters would get here. He hadn’t had much luck finding a suitable lot for his apothecary, and he hadn’t even tried to find any suppliers because he’d been so focused on his new chateau. It was coming along well, and with Spungen’s help Draco was sure by the end of the next week it would be ready for Pansy and Blaise to do-over. Draco had of course set strict rules on design themes so that it would remain in-keeping with the style and history of the building, but they both seemed very excited at the prospect and Draco felt lucky that he had such supportive friends. Nevertheless, he knew his own fragility, and he pondered the wisdom of staying in a cold flat through the winter, the autumn had been tough enough.
‘Ugh, only you could make the French Ministry of Magic sound hot. Please tell me they call it MAMF.’ Draco pulled on Harry’s hand and led him upstairs to a room he hadn’t shown him yet.
Draco groaned. ‘Just come here you twat.’ There was another chuckled and the warmth returned to his cheek. He realised that Harry had been peppering his face with kisses. He tried to reach out for him, but Harry wasn’t having any of it. He finally gave in and opened his eyes to find Harry staring at him, propped up on one elbow.
“Why?” Although something had shifted between them, he still had a hard time understanding the concept of her trying to help him. He wondered whether she had talked about him with Luna, whether she talked about him at all.
‘YES!’ Draco laughed as Harry jumped up from the sofa and started rooting through the boxes. They had a very strict tradition when it came to putting the Christmas tree up. They always got a tree from one of the local farmers, which Harry had lugged in the day before. Draco had tried to help but since he couldn’t use magic, he hadn’t been much help. This year’s tree was huge – easily eight feet tall. It was a good job the living room had a high ceiling. Draco put on muggle Christmas music, he could blast Mariah Carey like no one else. This was one of the few times a year when Draco threw caution to the wind and acted like an idiot. He had Harry grinning like a fool within the first couple of minutes.
“Um… hi,” he said awkwardly, not really knowing what to do with himself. It was the middle of the night and yet they were all sitting up… waiting? Worrying? He wasn’t sure, but it also meant a lot to him that these people cared enough about him to do that.
‘Je vais vous apprendre à faire des mille-feuilles.’ Draco’s smile grew. His grandmother on his father’s side used to make mille-feuille when he was small, although she’d died when he was five, so he hadn’t had homemade ones in a long time. In his peripheral vision he could see Harry looking grumpy.
‘Well, as nice as that might be. There are more important things to talk about. How are you feeling? Are you in pain? Does the healer know you’re awake yet?’ It was Draco’s turn to roll his eyes.
‘Grace is trying to solve the murder and this man won’t let her because she’s a girl. He’s mean.’ He grinned and her when her little brows furrowed, and her lips pursed. It was one of the cutest things he’d ever seen.
‘Only time will tell I suppose. I don’t know what I expected, considering I live here now, and he was going to figure it out either way, but I thought we’d have more time than that. I thought we could tell him all of it slowly – break him in.’ Harry sat on their bed much the same way he had just found him sitting on Teddy’s. They both should be tired by now, yet somehow Draco felt like he’d downed an entire vat of black coffee.
‘Draco-’ He could see Harry turn towards him in his peripheral vision, but he didn’t dare look. He couldn’t handle Harry’s sympathy face, it would kill him slowly from the inside.
Just as he was about to fall asleep, he was jolted awake by Harry grabbing his bandaged hand. He didn’t say anything as he unravelled the gauze and revealed the inch-long slash across his palm. He pulled his wand out even though he didn’t really need it, and Draco watched as the skin knitted back together.
The music was terrible and far too loud, and Draco had a buzzing in his ears that made it difficult to concentrate so he kept downing shots of Tequila until the lights blurred and he couldn’t tell his arse from his elbow. He’d lost Pansy who knows how long ago but he didn’t much care because he was having a great time. At least, he thought he was.
‘You can tell me if you need to leave, Daddy. I know you don’t like lots of people. It’s ok, one of my friends at Hogwarts is claustrophobic and we have to look after him when there’s quidditch – he doesn’t like being in the stands. He gets that funny breathing thing you do. It’s not exactly the same, but close enough, right?’ Draco’s heart swelled with pride.
‘You’re awake!’ He jumped as the door swung open and Hermione stepped in, looking an odd combination of surprised and ecstatic. Draco huffed a strangled laugh and was hit with a wave of pain which radiated out from his sternum through to his little toes. At least he knew he had toes again. ‘Yeah, you’ll be feeling like that for a while.’ She said when he groaned in pain.
He paused before tipping the memory into the pensieve. He had a gut wrenching feeling that if he viewed this memory now, so long after it happened, his entire view of his marriage would change. He wasn’t sure he was willing to admit the blame. He couldn’t deny any longer that he still loved Harry. Hell, he was as in love with him now as he had ever been, but that couldn’t change what had broken between them. Could he ever forgive himself if it really was his own fault? Could he ever look at Harry again knowing what he did to him, to them?
Draco’s eyes roamed across Harry’s open and sleeping face. He ran a finger lightly down his strong, straight nose and across his smooth cheek. Draco’s heart swelled with both gratitude and sadness. He thought about all the times he’d woken up to this and never appreciated it, how grateful he was that he’d get one more chance to do it now. But there was also a sadness, that this would be the last time.
Draco fell backwards from the pensieve when the memory ended, his hands shaking and his mind whirring. Harry had been terrifying. Would he really have hurt Wood? Would he really blackmail him right back? Surely his Harry was too good a person to ever consider it.
‘Tell me about Wood.’ He said abruptly. Harry’s entire body went rigid in an instant.
‘You harm so much as a hair on his head Oliver and I swear I’ll obliterate you. It’ll be like you never existed. I don’t know what you think you’re going to achieve with these stupid games, but I promise you when he’s strong enough they’ll come to an end.’ He’d never heard Harry talk like that before. He wondered if this was the side of him criminals had seen when he’d been an auror. No wonder he’d been so good at his job – his demeanour sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
“Take a seat, Harry. I’ll get you some tea. You need it.” Remus pulled a chair out for him as he stood and walked over to the kettle, looking as comfortable as if it was his own home. All eyes were still on him as he sat down. He looked at Ron.
The entire room blazed like a solar flare. Draco screwed his eyes tightly shut for fear that his eyeballs would melt right out of his head. The whisperings from the Veil rose like a cacophony of sound and yet he still couldn’t make out what they were saying. He couldn’t see Granger even though he knew she was right in front of him. As the flare of light reduced, Draco realised it was emanating from him towards the Veil. This could be it, the moment they had been waiting for. Any second now Potter would walk right out of the Veil and he’d smile and say, “was I gone long?”
‘Go to sleep, love.’ Harry mumbled into his ear once more. Draco shivered when he felt his breath brush over his skin and unashamedly wriggled closer to Harry. As much as he didn’t want to, he fell asleep within five minutes – being wrapped up in Harry ridding him of his inner turmoil.
‘You’re a lucky man, Mr Malfoy. For a while there we weren’t sure you were coming back to us.’ She finished taking whatever readings she was monitoring and put the clipboard back down at the end of his bed.
Draco was disappointed he hadn’t made it to the orphanage again before Christmas, but when Christmas Day dawned, he was still feeling happier than he had in a long time. Thankfully Teddy was old enough now that he’d stopped waking them up at five in the morning, although when Draco glanced at the clock, he wasn’t sure that half past seven was quite the improvement he’d been hoping for.
‘Draco, you have to try. Please. Not for me, not for anyone else, but for yourself. I know how strong you are and how much you’ve been through. You just need to trust yourself enough.’ Harry looked so determined, so sure, so unwavering. But Draco was none of those things.
“The werewolf. You want me to help you set my cousin up with a werewolf.” Her tone was flat and even though brightness of the falsified summer was still shining, wasn’t enough to make her long face look pleasant. Harry felt a flare of irritation.
