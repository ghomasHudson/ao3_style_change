“Do you need opened up again?” He could feel Draco straddling his thighs through the thin netting covering them, and he could hear the slick sounds of him lubing up.
Draco was getting fingered, quick and hard.
He thought they should thank them, Harry and Draco both, should do something for the Dom’s.
that’s sweeping through his body again, and again.
Draco smirked, he’d been avoiding Harry’s prostate, now he went right for it. Harry jumped. And then went very still as he moaned, long and loud, and Draco kept up a directed massage, slipping in a third finger.
Harry never earned punishment, Draco got one what seemed like everyday.
Harry follows and almost loses strength in his neck from the slight tilt forward. Recovery’s going to take the rest of the day at this rate.
He gave the wrinkled skin another pet then got to work on slicking up. Making sure to be diligent under the eyes of the Doms. He took his time spreading Harry’s arse, and wetting his rim with his index finger and slipping it in just an inch.
Harry had let himself be pulled in without thought, not understanding why Draco had made the detour. They were just deep enough in to go unnoticed by a passerby when Draco let go of his wrist, still monologging about fringe or fabric cuts or something Harry couldn’t follow.
He’d almost held out, had said no when Draco asked, but Draco knew him as well as Josh did.
“Harry…” The name foreign and familiar all at once. He searched his face, hand squeezing absent-mindedly. “How long have you been in the scene?”
secrets.
” (quiet, concerned, the compassion was back).
The stream slows. Draco steps closer and it ends. Theres a puddle under their feet and Harry almost can’t think about it without his legs giving out, which…
“Yes.”
He tried to remember who’d been at the club, who Nate had spoken with or who was nearby during their play, but it was all a blur. The faces dissolved into one another, overtaken by the memory of being hard for 2 hours straight, fingered and showcased in the middle of the club.
Dom. Josh
His fist thought was who was most likely staring him down as he woke and how far away his wand was. But as the sleep cleared from his brain, he realized he probably wasn’t being held hostage in some dark-wizard’s basement. He thought it might be Sunday, and therefore unlikely he was even on call for the Aurors.
As they eat, they speak lightly, there’s a lot to dive into and work through still, but not yet. They’re not in scene so everyone’s relaxed and acting as themselves. And Harry thinks about how the Doms must have known, like Josh knew, what was going to happen, last night and this morning. How they saw an opportunity and set the whole thing up. How they made it so Draco and Harry would wake up together, naked, in the same bed and more or less on the same page.
Harry used to be able to dance for Josh for hours, now he doubted he’d last five more minutes without breaking a rule, or just… keening over.
Draco usually tried to leave something out, like certain actions during the war that he regretted, or how he didn’t trust his father anymore. His crush on Potter. At first it was only because sharing really wasn’t his strong suit. Then it was because of the punishment that followed after his secret keeping, and the increasingly creative ways Nate would come up with to get the information out of him.
“Yeah.”
They’d met in France three years ago, both with English heritage and plans to move back to London in a few years.
thighs. And plump arse which was now getting squeezed in Draco’s hands. He dipped his thumbs into Harry’s crack (
Harry’s shyness was back, he looked down and hunched his shoulders as he opened his thighs to Josh’s prodding. The Dom’s hand slid upwards until his thumb and forefinger framed Harry’s tenting erection, like he was showcasing it. Draco moaned (not against the rules, he was awful at keeping them stifled, Nate couldn’t keep up with all the punishments) and Harry blushed in response, tucking his head into Josh’s neck.
.” with his head tipping back, eyes closed.) And not again after that.
So now Nate knew everything. Which made it especially weird when he started keeping something from Draco, usually he practiced what he preached.
Harry realized Draco was asking for his explicit consent, and his heart tripped at the how respected and treasured it made him feel. He smiled wide, then put on his best sub-voice, allowing some desperation to spill in and sighing theatrically. “
Draco chuckles and says “I need to shake off."
They listen as the women’s voices fade, and then Draco’s kissing him again, and Harry doesn’t feel so cold anymore. His throat’ll be mottled before they’re done. The dizziness doesn’t go. All army can feel is the wall he’s sinking into, the body sinking into him.
Harry… Harry had no idea what to say. What to think. He wasn’t thinking. He was just staring and trying really hard not to be scared. “
To get under his skin and prove he was the only one who could effect him so much. To be absolutely singular in his ability to get a rise out of Harry fucking Potter.
And well,
And then there were lips on his. Soft and sweet and plump and breathless only for a moment before Harry open his mouth with his own and slipped his tongue in deep. Draco let himself be taken for a second, savoured Harry’s wanting, plunging mouth, before giving back as much as he could. This wasn’t a Dom he was kissing, he didn’t have to submit, he didn’t want to. This was
But this? This felt like a reward. And he had no
He needs to—
And he was strict about secrets, and knowing his sub as well as possible. Draco doesn’t communicate well, so Nate would set tasks for him in the early days. He’d ask him to write about a subject (his parents, the war, Hogwarts, so on), put down everything he could, and Nate would study the passages afterward.
, and his head tilts back more. What little tension had remained in his body moves to his hips which twitch forward.
He looked down in surprise, then looked up in shock.
“Are you alright?” He spoke quietly enough that Draco knew the other’s couldn’t hear, the care and kindness in his voice was rare in a scene. Draco opened his mouth but remembered he hadn’t been given permission to speak. “You can speak babe, the scene hasn’t started yet.”
“The sign-”
Harry, you should have seen your face. Never seen you so lost in it. So consumed. So desperate. You looked a second away from falling to your knees and begging.” Harry feels a tongue, hot and wet, slide up his throat to his ear. Then teeth biting, harder than a nip, on the lobe. Harry might be moaning, he’s not sure. There’s static in his ears. “You don’t have to beg though. Not ever. No need. I’ll give it to you. Whenever, whatever. I don’t mind. I love it.
Wondering why there are fingers undoing his flies.
Harry was hopeful enough to believe Draco hadn’t noticed, but not stupid enough to. Yet the blonde never watched Harry watch the alley, never turned obviously towards him ,or away from him, when they approached it, never paused in his walk, his speech or his gestures.
Draco wondered if Harry would come untouched.
Harry seemed dazed but took the hint all the same. He positioned himself on the (very large) bed, right in the centre on his knees. Having all three pairs of eyes on him made Harry shy again, but at Josh’s nod, he began moving his hips in slow sensuous figure eights.

Draco buries one hand in Harry’s hair, sets his lips on top of Harry’s ear and asks
And on display they were. Every time Harry peeked over Draco’s shoulder he spotted three more people staring at them. It was beginning to feel like the majority of the club was watching. While Harry felt timid, Draco was clearly loving all the extra attention. The longer they danced, the more his hands roved Harry’s body, the tighter he gripped and the harder he got. His hands would slip under Harry’s shirt to scratch at his stomach or lower back, then pinch at his nipples, causing Harry to whine into the skin of his throat. He’s pull at Harry’s hair to get him to mouth at his throat and sink his palms down to grope at his thighs, his arse… his balls.
They didn’t talk about it.
And the whole room caved in.
The oncoming anxiety attack was stopped swiftly and smoothly by Nate’s hand on his shoulder. Draco had just enough mind to take a breath and keep from panicking while he listened to what Josh said next.
But Harry saw something calculating in his eyes every time they turned towards each other to begin the double-apparition back, Draco’s hands on his arms and gazes locked. Grey eyes sparked and smouldered with some kind of understanding Harry himself didn’t possess.
So either he took the risk and jumped, or he walked away.
He looms. And Harry clutches at his arms while Draco gets everything in place. His flies are undone, his pants pulled down just past the root of his cock, hard and restricted, and then Draco’s is in there with his. Warm and soft and familiar and so,
Draco laughed. “No… Well, yes I suppose that might be one of the smaller reason, but no. It’s not why. If you’re asking me what attracted me to the scene, that was all masochism and a fetish for impact play. But if your asking why it suits me so well… I guess I finally gave in to needing some sense of accountability. As much as I loved being spoiled as a kid, I need to be restrained a lot more now… Also, you know, I love it.” He gave Harry a wicked smile, then looked back down to his work. His rhythm was speeding up, Harry was panting again. “And then there’s Nate… You?”
to just trust Draco to take him there. Easy, and terrifying. Harry clung (
It took Harry three inhalations to find the courage, and four exhales to push down the
So he nodded, and trusted Nate to get him through this safely, and Josh not to be some asshole pretending to be… this, and allowed himself to get swept up into the chaos and intensity of the night.

Draco’s issues concerning the whole affair. But once the reminder of Potter and the war stopped sending him in a spiral, Nate never
Harry took a breath, the tension in his shoulders ratcheting up again, but he answered obediently.
It was as stern as Draco had heard Josh’s voice yet, which itself made arousal tighten in his chest. (Though Nate never called him by his name during a scene, only ‘boy’.) Immediately Harry let go of Draco and clasped his hands behind his own back. He leaned back and put an inch of space between their bodies. It was suddenly obvious how loud their kissing and moaning had been in the now quiet room with only their obnoxious panting to be heard.
“Draco?!” The other man kept talking, apparently adjusting his pants (he was still getting used to muggle clothing) where Harry couldn’t quite see. Looking around the alley he began to ask “What are you-”
Obediently, and with a coy smile, Harry took his place on Josh’s lap, impaling himself as he went down. Soon he was settled and Josh went back to sipping whatever drink he had in his hand.
After sharing a school with the man for seven years, a war, and a rivalry, he was surprised there was much more to learn at all.
His eyes stuck on Harry’s crotch.
Draco scoffed. “Have you seen Nate? He’s built like a Hippogriff.”
He hooked a hand under Draco’s knee and pulled his leg up and off Harry, holding it up in the air, bent so his ass was more open than before. He deepened his thrust and took advantage of the position, hitting Draco’s prostate every motion forward and sending ripples of pleasure through him. His nails dug into Draco’s thigh, and he bit down hard on Draco’s throat, scraping his teeth against the skin.
Josh was mouthing at his neck again, paying no mind to what Harry was saying. Harry’s whole body was quaking with Josh’s assertive thrusts.
Harry gave a shrug and closed his eyes, sinking down into the mattress, determined to enjoy having a hand on his cock while he answered the question. “Josh got me into the scene, but our dynamic clicked almost right away. It was all a little inevitable, if I’m honest. I hate all the fame and attention and expectations of being
“Good.
We aren’t doing this unless you focus. I need you to focus.” (In. Out.) “What’s your safeword?”
“Including Harry?”
I’ll make you come.”
He didn’t want to come. He didn’t want to disobey, but doing so felt impossible pinned between these two people who effected him so powerfully. He started to beg. Half-formed words and whimpers falling from his mouth in hopes that Josh would be merciful (Harry knew he wouldn’t be), “I can’t” and “I’m close” and “Please, please,
feel was Draco’s eyes hungrily soaking up Harry’s prone and delivered body.
Draco asks again if he wants it, tells him to repeat his safeword, pulls Harry in slowly, with plenty opportunity to change his mind. He snogs Harry as he pushes him once again into the brick wall. Draco undoes his flies while Harry undoes his coat, and they snog a little more.
He almost missed the signal Nate sent their way when a particularly nervous sub was finishing up with Draco’s arse under the harsh hand of his Dominatrix. But he did see it, and the next thing he knew, Josh was nudging him to standing and across the room. His arse was sensitive after being stretched open for so long, it twinged with every step. His cock hadn’t had a chance to go down either, not with the constant view of Draco’s arse getting filled by various bodies.
maybe… I’m really thirsty today. And it’s a bit chilly, so an extra cup of tea after lunch wouldn’t be uncalled for…”
from tail bone to the nape of his neck. Draco jumped, head dropping back in a loud and shameless moan as a shiver worked its way through him violently.
Perhaps he should have known better.
“Does he really want it?” Draco could hear the wonder in his own voice.
Also he wanted to watch as Harry almost fell asleep in his post-orgasmic haze while getting fucked forcefully by Josh.
Right. (In… out,
Harry didn’t know what else to do, so he nodded, and tried to let go of some of the stiffness in his limbs. Then he took a breath and let Draco lead him home with another “ok.”

The happiness and bliss left over from last night was reigniting by the smarting in his arse and leaked back into him, inspiring a blissful chuckle. “Fuck.” His voice was deep and rough: evidence of the night before.
Draco’s hands are both on his shoulders. He was showing ‘serious’ and ‘don’t push it’ and was probably getting desperate. He’d finished his second cup of tea forty minutes ago (
, and then remembers it’s not that kind. Draco has evolved from rutting against Harry’s stomach to wanking off on his shirt. He’s still going, but only just barely, when Harry realizes what the movement over his abdomen is. Is awake enough to be annoyed about the splatter on his shirt just before it happens.
He wondered what they’d come up with, and if it could, in anyway, live up to the last twenty-four hours.
Draco was dressed in his trademark leather trousers (and nothing else), Harry in his typical lace knickers and one of his sheer, unbuttoned shirts. Draco had spent an hour before departure shaving his legs (the muggle way because he knew how much it worked harry up).
Harry was accidentally immersed, distracted by the cut Draco’s figure against the darkened brick, the almost invisible line of piss protruding from his form and splattering against the wall.
He’s entirely focused on Draco asking, “Ready?” and Harry really should ask for clarification. He doesn’t need to though. “Slow, remember? Just like last time. But this time…” He smirks, “Front row seat.” His hand goes to his cock.
Draco was close again, right in front of him, concern on his face, mixed with confusion and hesitation and… fuck. Harry was still thinking about the puddle behind him. What was wrong with him?
He thought about years of animosity and mirrored roles in a war. He thought about bad decisions and mistakes that weren’t actually choices that still haunted him some nights. He thought of burning green eyes and all those things Nate whispered in his ear when he’s getting fucked within an inch of his life.
“Why don’t you tell our guests what you told me last Tuesday?” Josh asked.
“I told you about our past. How we used to hate each other all the time—”
This was the game tonight: they were to put on a show for their Doms (and whoever else happened to enjoy it), they were to dance and touch but no more. They’ve been at it for an hour now at least, and Harry was beginning to think that if he’d been here with some other ridiculously hot sub, one with a bit more self-control, or patience, this would be an easier task to. As it was, Draco was selfish and ruthless and deliciously addictive.
Draco switches hands, sucking on the head of his cock. He keeps jacking Harry off, fast and hard, while his other hand snakes around back to Harry’s arse. He roughly hooks two fingers into his hole and pulls at his rim, stretching the wet, sensitive skin and making Harry’s hips buck. He comes in an instant, right into Draco’s mouth with a groan, arching his back.
Circe,
Quick as anything, it was over. Like time had slowed with the hiss and splatter of public urination and then caught up with itself. Draco’s flies were tightened, his clothes pulled to their correct positions and his body turned back towards Harry, already forgetting the wet, dripping stain he’d left on the wall behind him.
“Harry.”
He could
Harry let Josh have his way with Harry’s skin, arms tight around his waist, and he watched Draco’s punishment unfold. Soon, Nate was finished with the whip. Draco was still naked, his hands tied behind his back. Out of one of the clubs little side tables, Nate pulls out a bottle of lube.
Draco smirked, “What do you love?”
What he
In a flash, almost all Draco’s panic was replaced with arousal.
Harry pulled his pants off roughly, scratching as he went.
in this house and didn’t want whatever they were planning, they’d all get cursed out by sentient magic anyway. He knew that mutual assured destruction had been established: if one of them went to the press, so would the other.
Josh was examining his nails in the obnoxious, pompous way Dom’s had sometimes (the same way Draco used to act) and nonchalantly said “His name’s Harry Potter.”
Draco’s whole world shrank in the anticipation, dragging the moment out and heightening the rush. Harry had been watching
The contracts also said that Harry and Draco were free to do whatever they wanted together, when they were alone. Harry had asked (begged) for that specifically.
Harry let out a small groan and turned his head to face away from those piercing, intense (stunning) eyes. He was laying on his stomach like usual, and shifting in an aborted attempt to ignore whoever was in his bed caused the sore and stretching sensation in his arse make itself known.
All the way out.
, he was hot, rubbing Draco off, a slave to the other man’s movement’s and will. He caught himself pushing his ass back and tilting his hips, not to get Draco to move, but so he might better show off for whoever was watching.
And then the break, the hiss and splash and drip. The push as Draco rocked back onto his heels, the release at the back of his neck before his head swung first back then forward, and the lessening tension, shoulders to feet, while he settled into the rush.
And he’d dressed
He needs to
Sometimes Harry hates Draco’s tendency to speak in abstracts as much as he loves it. Knows Draco can be unbearably explicit when it suits him but enjoys watching Harry while he puts it all together and realizes what it is Draco wants. Harry wants.
“C’mon Harry” Draco whined quietly into his ear. “Slick me up, I know you can… I know you want to.” Harry could picture it, the way Draco would slide in, wet and and pushy, in front of everyone. How he’d take what he wanted and damn the consequences. How he’d use Harry and make sure he loved it.
Not even in Draco’s wildest, most indulgent fantasies, did he ever imagine what happened next. And there had been some exceptional ones.
It really is so very warm. Like bath water, or a perfect cuppa. And it’s cooling quickly and the shock of temperature change only serves to rile him more and it must show because Draco moans. The vibrations sinking into his hair and scalp and skull and Harry would kiss him so good if he could just gain control over his body.
Everything they did together was exacerbated and intoxicated by the other. Not that play was simple or easy before they connected, but now it was so much more so: intense and overwhelming and sometimes downright unbearable.
Light and distanced and definitely coming from the cobble street to their right.
With excitement thrumming through his heart, Draco jumped across the bed to push Harry sideways onto his back. From there he could press his hands to Harry’s chest, slide them indulgently down his torso and grip his hips, feasting on the visual or Harry Potter’s prick, there for the taking. Then he glided his fingers down his thighs and caught the knickers around his knees. He slipped them off Harry’s feet and, while staring directly into Harry’s eyes, raised them to his face a took a whiff, moaning at the smell of B.O. and pre-come.
Except it wasn’t any risk at all.
Josh paused in his introduction, apparently waiting to see if Draco would say anything, ask who this other man was who wanted Draco (
“I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I wouldn’t have… If I did.” Draco (thank Merlin) wasn’t staring at his dick anymore. The confusion was gone, leaving behind something that looked like sympathy and understanding and clearly Draco knew something Harry didn’t because he still had no idea. He felt a hand close gently on his wrist, “Hey, it’s ok. OK?”
“Good, now rub me off.” Harry was past trying to resist. He got to work on opening Draco’s flies and wrapping a hand around Draco’s cock while the other man got to opening him up properly.
Two fingers, then three.
“Potter—”
Draco’s eyes rolled back into his head, his mouth open in a silent scream, he couldn’t
’-clothes-and-out-the-door. Draco fulfilled his Sunday ritual half past eleven, but stopped before entering the forced-dressing phase. Instead, he smoothly transitioned from goading-into-compliance to sitting down closely (warm-heavy-tight thigh pressed slightly on top of one of Harry’s) and placing a hand on Harry’s forearm before meeting his eyes. Draco didn’t wear ‘serious’ or ‘’compassionate’ very often, but when he did… well. He wore it well but that’s beside the point.
He can’t move, paralyzed and pinned and loving it.
Draco took stock. He was more than overwhelmed, but that was normal. He was still a little worried, but only about Harry and how he might react to Draco. Nate says they’ll get to that.
Draco was biting his lip in anticipation, hunger surely written all over his face.
They stopped. And so did the normal.
“Fuck the war. And fuck childhood rivalries too. Do you want this as much as I do?”
“Harry? Seriously, are you ok? I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable, didn’t think… we had dorm-mates for seven years, and- Harry?”
He turned back to Draco, the smirk staining his expression matched and mirrored back at him.
Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t even move.
It felt different. More dangerous, strange and unpredictable. Perhaps for the first time since his foray into BDSM Harry had found himself fascinated and attracted to something he truly never expected of himself. All the discipline and orders and submission and sex, it had always been there, simmering somewhere under the surface. But piss? (Watersports, Josh told him.) He hadn’t expected this at all.
give out then. But only for a second, not enough to force him down, he bounces back and leans harder in to the bricks.
And then they stopped. Josh bit down harshly on Harry’s neck (Harry could practically feel the word
Actually that’s not entirely true, they
“Come on out Harry. He’s said yes.”
The closer they got to Draco’s prone form, the more obvious it became how much the Doms had planned the whole night out. Josh positioned Harry directly behind Draco’s arse so he could see clearly the gapping and glistening hole. When he said, “you’re going to fuck him” Harry suddenly wasn’t sure if Draco was the one getting punished, or he was.
Once faced with a table full of brunch, and two amused looking Doms, Draco announces to the room at large, “We’re hungry.”
They were good like that, contrary and compatible: when Harry pulled, Draco pushed, where Harry was gentle, soft and slow, Draco was rough and hard and couldn’t take his time if it bloody killed him.
Harry pushed Draco back onto the bed sideways and snogged him again, grinding down into Draco’s palm. He pulled away again after only a moment, “are you going to fuck me over afterwards?”
He sucked on his tongue, tugged at his lips, nibbled and nipped and scratched with his teeth until he could feel Harry’s lips swell with it. And every time Draco pushed, Harry pushed back harder. Every second control flipped from one to the other as they fought each other with their mouths. And then with their bodies as Harry tightened his hold and shifted his hips so they were grinding against one another (as much as Draco could without any leverage). Their chests pressed together as they panted and Harry’s thighs clutching at Draco’s enough to hurt.
Draco’s eyes were trained on the other man, legs pressed together as he sat diagonally on Josh’s lap to face Draco almost directly. Harry was looking directly into Josh’s eyes, and Draco could recognize nervousness in his straight back and scrunched eyebrows, surprised and relieved he could still read him.
Harry’s eyes had dropped closed as he sunk into the feeling of being touched, shivers skating across his naked skin. He nodded. “Is it sensitive?” He nodded again.
exciting.
And then Harry can
He reached out with his foot slowly, just enough to slide his toes over Harry’s ankle. They got a good five seconds of skin on skin contact, lighting zipping between them, and jostled by the vigorous thrusts while Draco bit his own lip. Then Nate inevitably realized what he was doing.
“Harry?”
Draco had to dig his nails into his own palms to keep from grabbing his cock through his pants or rubbing up against Nates palm. Next, Harry slipped his thumbs under them hem of his knickers (Draco seriously couldn’t get over Harry Potter in knickers) and slinkily pushed them down his thighs.
He also understands the legality of public urination.
That sign was universally understood as an invitation for anyone in the club to fuck the sub being presented. Nate would, of course, sit close by and keep a close eye on things, ready to tell anyone to fuck off if they weren’t courteous, or grant permission for anything beyond the understood limits. Harry was overcome with anticipation, he’d noticed Draco’s kink for getting passed around in the contract and now he’d get to see it in action. He couldn’t wait to see who would approach first.
Draco thrusted harder. He didn’t hear the door opening again, but he felt the bed dip at both corners near the headboard. Before he could untangle himself, he felt someone pull him roughly back into Nate’s chest. His own nipples were given a rough twist, more painful than what he’d done to Harry, causing him to moan and arch his back.
Except it’s good. Really, very good. And safe and close and warm and so,
it seemed).
He realized he was moaning, loud and unsupervised, but that was normal too.
“Three years. You?”
And then he was rolling onto his side, head on a pillow and facing Harry, who laid beside him. His lips were red and swollen, his face was messy with lube a saliva, making Draco want to reach out and clean him up. With his tongue. Draco leaned in, stretching his neck, he could feel the heads of their cocks bumping into one another and thought he might be able to reach down with his bound hands. Their mouths were centimetres apart when Nate pulled him back roughly by the hair. “No touching. Harry, be a good boy and hold his wrists still, but no other contact than that. Understand?” He pulled again at Draco’s hair and Draco groaned but nodded.
Harry could remember it from last night, picture it in his head, long and thin and pale, and now forcing its way into Harry’s arse.
Draco asks if he’s sure once more. (“
“Well then, we’re good.”
Instead he focused on
It was too early for this.
Draco, quick as those whips he loves so much, places a hand over Harry’s mouth and under his nose and Harry thinks he could get out if he wanted to but doesn’t. They’re shrouded in shadows and so close no one could see anything even if they were standing right beside them and silently, invisibly, they watch two women pass beyond the sun-lit opening of the alley, completely unnoticed.
many things at this point. Maybe the fact that Draco’s technically just broken the law in front of an auror, or how he’d
“Lovely baby. Now give us a spin, let Draco see all the sides. We worked so hard prettying you up for him, best give him a chance to appreciate.”
So Draco pulled out all the stops.
Draco brings him back with a gentle pinch over his chin, thumb and crooked forefinger of his right hadn’t (not the one still holding his cock, (
allowed himself to indulge. More and more all the time. He always took a moment to savour it: the first bite of chocolate pastry or french truffle, the first slide of wine down his throat, of whiskey on his tongue, the first slide of his cock up Harry’s arse, the first stark sting of the whip, the first brutal impact of the paddle, the first languid slide of tongue.
“Safeword?”
“Slow.” He says, pulling at Harry’s collar and Harry still doesn’t understand. Only recognizes the echo of what Draco had reassured him earlier about
He’s hard again by the time they get home to the Dom’s on the couch, and cuddles and praises and Draco re-telling the story in really extremely explicit detail and Harry hiding his face in Josh’s shoulder. He comes two more times before a shower and bed. And he doesn’t have the mental energy to think about what next time might be like.
The third time it happens, it happens only a week later.
The other man also took a seat in the opposite chair and nodded to Draco in acquiesce while looking at Nate. Nate nodded his go ahead and the other man addressed Draco directly.
The Dom’s finished up shortly, Josh summoned the duvet and they all tucked in for the night without moving from where they were. Nate undid Draco’s cuffs but Harry never let go of his hands.
“We can quit at
Ok with what? Harry once again has no idea what’s going on. “Draco.”
“That was a good one.” He muttered quietly to Draco, still not completely awake.
And he was hard as a rock.
. It was like… Little French cobble street, tea and toast and icing staining the corner of Draco’s mouth, and all that bright happy normalcy. But they were stepping into this claustrophobic alleyway, hidden away in the middle of all that sunlight, dark and gritty and
Relieved that their ability to know one another so well translated into group play, Draco nodded. Nate fetched them from his pocket, unshrinking them, then kneed his way to where Draco was still hovering over Harry.
Harry shook his head, Josh had fucked him enough times in the mornings for him to know he’d still be loose from the night before. It’ be a stretch, but it’s be an enjoyable one.
keep Harry paying attention to
And then he watches, frozen, as Draco shifts his weight (that’s all it takes, it should probably be harder then that, for the impact it leaves) and groans at the scratch of denim on his foreskin (must be like fire) and leaves those few rare drops of piss to sink into the cloth tight over Harry’s crotch. He feels the press and rub right through to his cock.
One such ritual was his weekly Sunday lunch to a little French wizarding village somewhere north of Paris, where he would eat the same salad and ratatouille dish at the same little French restaurant, walk the same little cobble-stone path to the same little French bakery where he
Harry reached a hand out towards the bedside table, and summoned the lube he knew was in there, wandlessly and wordlessly. He tossed it back to Draco, face buried in the pillow.
Their crotches were still pressed together and Draco let himself thrust up, once, the movement small enough that the Dom’s might not catch it (but what was the fun in that?). Harry’s eyes widened and he mouthed a scandalized ‘
Or, he tried to. Until Draco’s whining got ridiculous and the pureblood stopped taking no for an answer. But still, they didn’t talk about it. And they walked down the same little cobble street like nothing had ever happened.
Josh is
Like an exit.
“Ok. Ok. It’s alright.” Draco watched as Josh smoothed his palms down Harry’s arms and spoke to him softly, let him lean back and comfort him. Draco didn’t crave that brand of attention as a sub, but he was pleased to see someone treat Harry like he was precious. Nobody ever did when they were younger, everyone just through him to the fire.
“And do you still?”
wanted it for a while (which, frankly Draco didn’t
Harry wasn’t entirely sure what was going on.
There was no finesse, no purposeful angling of the hips or hesitancy. It wasn’t gracious or deliberate or even particularly well delivered. It was the most raw fucking Harry had ever experienced. Even Josh couldn’t help but spare a thought or two for Harry in his most unforgiving moods. And because of all this, it didn’t last particularly long.
Harry lazily nodded once. Draco picked Harry up so he was sitting in between Draco's legs, facing away. He kept playing with Harry's hair with one hand and used the other to wrap around his boyfriend.
Hermione looked to a certain red-haired woman,
"Look, Draco, you're my son. Doing this would be leaving the family. Would you ever leave your own family? Why on Merlin's beard would you ever not want to stay anymore?"
"He was messing with my mind. Like Malfoy said..."
Harry and Draco sat in the living room with the other members of the Order. But Harry quickly noticed something was off.
"But they were mean to you-"
Once Harry was gone, he grabbed his wand and muttered a spell no one else could hear with his eyes closed in concentration.
The tone of Lucius' words softened slightly,
"Hardly! It's an honest to god surprise that my parents haven't already disowned me yet in the 5 minutes it's been since we escaped. That aside, I carry the Black lineage. My mother was a Black, as am I."
"And you don't think they would be disturbed to see me there?"
best friend too. And look how Peter Pettigrew turned out."
Harry absentmindedly answered,
"Ha-Harry, are you okay?"
"What, how we finally stopped hating each other?"
Back in the room, an image began to materialize before them, from a first-person perspective. The view moved around wildly in between a Harry sitting on the bed, looking frightened, and a seething Lucius Malfoy.
Draco threw his arms around Harry's waist, knocking the wind out of Harry. In a steely, solid voice that was the exact opposite of Harry's just a moment before, he spoke with gritted teeth,
"Me..."
"We're out of there, we got away. We're safe. We're safe now. We're in Grimmauld Place, he can't find us here. My father can't hurt us here. We're safe. Dearest, we're safe."
Draco scoffed with a roll of his eyes. Harry retorted,
"Clearly not!"
"Young man, you swore at your professor, your headmaster...Dumbledore! Now you have some 'splainin' to do or you'll be sent to your room."
Draco's face scrunched up and sighed,
Harry jumped up and took hold of Draco in case the boy fell.
Draco, in contrast, responded in an airy and sweet tone,
"Sorry. You insult was actually quite good,"
He opened it up and smiled at Ron and Hermione, who were standing there surprised. He wasn't exactly sure why; they knew he was here. They had seen him yesterday. He smiled awkwardly and welcomed,
"We're safe. You're safe. You're safe because you're with people who love you. Professor Lupin, Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ron,"
Lucius stomped forward and dragged up Draco's wrist so sharply that Harry wondered if it had broken Draco's wrist. Pressing his thumb into the skin that showed the dark mark, Lucius spat in his son's face,
Luckily, he felt a small tingling sensation go through him as he crossed the magical border with Harry's body limping behind him.
"If it is any consolation, we won't be sending you back there. You don't owe them anything, and you're not abandoning them by leaving. You're saving yourself, and that is an incredibly brave thing to do."
"You weren't looking too hot either,
Harry balled up his fist multiple times and looked away,
He curled up into a ball, under the impression that Draco had left.
Draco felt his chest constrict and his stomach turn into a tight knot. He tried to get air in, but his chest just wouldn't let him. His mind and vision went hazy and he felt himself lose his balance. He stumbled a bit and grasped his head and hair, trying to steady himself.
Ron shook his head,
"Oh god, really?"
Draco's body racked with silent tears as Harry's eyes widened, not knowing what to do. Draco covered his mouth with his left hand and shut his eyes, not in a feminine or dainty manner, but in a rather animalistic way, desperate to make sure that his parents in the next room over didn't hear his sobbing.
Harry blinked a few times and shook his head, seemingly to clear his thoughts. There was finally some recognition in his eyes as he answered,
The adrenaline and motivation that shot through his body somehow gave him the ability to take his hand out of his father's, a striking shock to the man who wasn't used to being retaliated against. He dove over to the other side of his bed and quickly grabbed the bottomless bag from underneath it then snaked his arm around Harry's waist.
"No, you're a Malfoy."
Hermione squeezed her eyes tight and held her arms close to her body,
It felt as those it was coming from their own bodies, the vibrating in their chest as the steely, unmovable voice declared as he pointed to his parents,
She pulled back and sat back with Ron, who sent a smile to his best friend.
Harry smiled and thanked Draco by hugging him. When they separated, Harry hopped off the bed and held his hand out to take, When he felt Draco's hand fall into his, he squeezed tightly, then felt a squeeze back.
Of course, he had left. Why would he put up with all of Harry's emotions? He should have known better than to believe Draco would stay, but he had really thought...
"Yes."
"Maybe we should start the meeting off with talking about it?"
Draco looked up to the clock on the opposite side of his room, reading it and seeing it was 6:32 in the afternoon. He bit his lip. He couldn't help but worry. What if Harry had been kidnapped, being held ransom by some street rats? Or taken by the Dark Lord? What if he has gotten lost on his way here? Why on God's green Earth would he be late, even if it was just by two minutes-
As they sat down, Harry's eyes widened,
"This is why I don't want to stay anymore."
Harry gave Draco a worried side-eye, but Draco just smiled and nodded. He watched as Harry left the living room.
"You learn. If you let every reminder getcha down, then you'll never be...up."
"Hey...sorry for all of that..."
They both sat up in the bed, sighing at the same time, adding a slightly comical air.
"How do we know he isn't spying?"
They walked out of the room to go eat.
"And you didn't find that suspicious in the slightest?"
"Now we just have to decide a time-"
"So..."
"No. We asked him not to come. Specifically,"
"Why can't it just be simple, for once?"
"I dissociated. It's basically when...um...it's really hard to explain-"
"Well, that's someday. This is today."
His eyes widened and he shot up, hyperventilating as he looked around the room for Draco. He didn't see him.
Harry bit his bottom lip and avoided Draco's eyes. Draco recalled the date written on the board and supplied it for Harry,
Remus got up from the couch and went out into the hallway where Draco and Harry were sitting. He tapped Harry lightly on the shoulder but pulled back when the boy flinched.
you leave Sirius in Azkaban, all those years. You saved me, why not him? There's no way you didn't know about his innocence."
"July 31st, 1980."
"What was the question?"
"Oh-um, thank you, Kreacher."
"No no, it's fine. It's fine! I'll just go somewhere else. I understand. It's totally okay!"
"There will never be a moment when I don't want you to come back. I promise."
Harry let out a mixture or a giggle and sigh, answering sincerely,
Draco gripped Harry's hand tighter and covered his mouth as he began to cry. Ron's eyes widened and he fidgeted a bit, not knowing what to do. This seemed to be the general mood.
Once satisfied, he used a quick charm to place all of his clothed neatly in the drawer and then headed downstairs to start breakfast.
Nobody said anything, and Draco took that as them allowing him to leave. He walked with Harry, who looked scared once again. Draco stopped 3/4ths of the way up the steps where they were hidden from the view of others and looked at Harry, repeating himself calmly,
"The Order of the Phoenix has meetings there, but besides that no."
"When were you born?"
Draco reentered the room with a tea plate and enough cups for everyone. He quietly poured it out, and his eyes were noticeably let red and puffed.  He passed a cup to Harry as the boy continued talking,
After deliberation and a painfully tense room, Hermione set her pencil down forcefully, catching everyone's attention.
Draco looked down at the suds in the sink and he simply shook his head,
For once, he was happy he had been stopped from removing his memory that time he had a particularly bad breakdown related to the Dursley's. Because now, now he might be able to help Draco in a way he wasn't sure just anyone would be able to. Harry, following his previous train of thought, spoke up,
Draco replied plainly,
"No, we have very strong wards all over the house."
Until something did.
It went black as Draco shut his eyes tight, then the magical screen disappeared.
"Is he always like that?"
Draco didn't want to ruin this moment. After all, 'The Chosen One' probably wouldn't have these as often, it at all, once the war truly began. But, he had to.
Draco just stared down at the ground as he grasped onto Harry and shook his head back and forth hysterically,
"Nope. Just hid and said not to wait up for him. Oh, and to tell you to come by after the end of class."
Harry turned back around, and they slept.
"Why didn't you just...leave?"
Draco woke up the next day curled around Harry. He was quite drowsy from staying up late with Harry, listening to his babbling and crying. He also didn't regret it one bit.
Harry moved his hands up to Draco's neck and cupped his cheeks,
"They're good for each other."
"I don't want to talk about it."
A few people opened their mouths' to talk, but Harry interrupted,
"Just egg and toast. I don't have much of an appetite. You?"
He stood before The Fat Lady and proudly proclaimed,
"It is technically my estate even though you guys meet here, so I get to decide who stays and who leaves. And Draco,"
Ron furrowed his eyebrows,
Draco subconsciously gripped his left forearm where his Dark Mark lay, looking to the side. Draco felt his hand be removed and his sleeve being pushed up by Harry, who then pecked it softly, just as he had done countless times before. First when Draco had just received it, second when he hid from Harry in fear of hatred, and then third, fourth, fifth, and so on. Harry never broke eye-contact the entire time. Harry responded earnestly with a soft smile,
"Who are you?"
Draco was getting antsy while Hermione was getting exasperated, and Harry just stood there awkwardly. He gulped,
He took a quick glance at the door and saw that their new potions professor had yet to walk in through the door, so he decided to swiftly walk towards it and leave.
Harry rubbed his arm comfortingly. Draco looked up and relaxed under Harry's gaze. He stood up from the couch,
"Was it because of what I did yesterda-"
Remus trod carefully,
"Oh, like the..."
He ran into the space between the building. If his theory was wrong...well...he didn't have time to think about that.
On impulse, Draco pointed back,
he never would.
Draco turned the faucet off and turns to Harry,
Harry nodded.
Sitting Harry down onto the couch, still oblivious to the crowd in the kitchen that was spying on them, he sat down and faced Harry, wrapping his arms around him. Then he went to pull back, remembering how he hated being touched when he had moments like these, only to be surprisingly pulled back into Harry's arms.
At 6:30 that night, the couple begrudgingly got up off of the couch to go make themselves' look presentable and clean the house up a bit before the Order Of The Phoenix meeting.
"Yes,"
"Could you not get your pretty little hands dirty?"
"But knowing them, they won't be able to get anything done and focus on said 'pressing matters' if they're more worried about us."
Draco mumbled something only Harry heard,
"It was getting to be too much. Everything they wanted me to be was...impossible. They made me do things I didn't want to do, and I had to listen. I had to follow."
Harry gasped dramatically and brought his hand to his chest,
Draco laid down on the bed and patted the spot next to him. Harry crawled over.
Draco rushed to his boyfriend's side and tapped him on the shoulder, startling Harry.
Ron rolled his eyes, and spat exasperated,
"Since Harry doesn't want to talk about it, maybe Draco can go first?"
Luckily, he wasn't underage, so he could do it all with magic without the Trace being put on him, which he thanked Merlin for. Of course, he didn't hold a vendetta against muggles anymore, but the idea of getting down on his hands and knees to scrub the floor still wasn't an appealing one.
Draco sat down on top of it cross-legged, while Harry sat in front of him with his legs in a 'W' position and his hands out in front of him.
Getting enveloped in a hug, Harry immediately wrapped his arms around him, letting Draco snuggle his face into Harry's neck while he wrapped his arm's around his lover's waist.
The sound of Dumbledore's voice caused everyone to snap their heads towards him. He stroked his beard and squinted at Draco's pleading eyes.
They cuddled on the couch for a long while, staying silent and letting the other's presence ward off the negative and venomous thoughts trying to make their way into the two lovers' conscience.
"Are you okay explaining with me? I know you...y'know...were like that as well, and I don't think I'll be able to explain it to them well."
Harry straightened out his body and then balled up, leaning into Draco's chest. Draco wrapped both arms around his lover and rested his head on Harry's.
Harry chanced a peek at Dumbledore and saw him peering through his spectacles at Harry. Harry quickly averted his eyes in fear he would make eye-contact. After what happened the day before, Harry didn't need to be thinking of Dumbledore.
Draco couldn't fight the smile off of his face and made the decision. Harry lit up when he realized all that was left was to decide a date to run, then his Draco will finally be rid of those horrid parents. Though they never laid a hand on Draco (which he was thankful for; he didn't think he would be able to think logically if they had), Harry had seen the mental and emotional damage Draco endured.
"So...do we
"Where's Harry?"
They ate their breakfast quietly on the couch, holding each other's hands and just enjoying their lover's company. Once they finished, they went upstairs and took turns taking a nice, warm, relaxing shower.
She sent a look to Mr. Weasley, who instantly made a face of realization. His shoulders dropped and he took the hand of his lover, who pulled him into the room with Ron and Hermione in it, wanting to see if any of the others noticed the same things.
Draco contemplated for only a moment before Harry perked up and shook him back and forth. Harry exclaimed,
"I don't understand how that fellow can be so chipper."
Nobody could just...focus! Not with the sound of Harry, their
"But you said yourself there was nowhere else to go but here. Where are you supposed to go?"
"You can't keep coming through the window...you'll get caught someday..."
Draco stuttered horribly, never making it past the first syllable of a word. Lucius' eyes widened and then darkened as he connected the dots. The volcano erupted,
"What?! No! Now, why would think that."
"What happened yesterday?"
No amount of insincere apologies, guilt-trips, threats, and blackmails could keep him trapped any longer. For he had found a key. Now,
"Yes, it was, but that's beside the point. Anyway, he sees me in the mirror, and I try to use some spell that I didn't know what it did."
"You weren't here when I woke up. Now that I think about it, it's kinda stupid."
Dumbledore's eyes seemed to lose their twinkle, and he simply answered gravely,
Harry cooed at Draco. Draco's face, somber before, now had a wide smile replace the sour expression the moment he saw his boyfriend. He sat up from his bed and sprinted over, nearly knocking Harry over.
Draco sighed and dropped his perfect posture, grabbing his ankles and gripping them tightly. His lips began to quiver and Harry looked up in alarm. Finally, Draco made eye-contact with Harry and mumbled in a defeated, broken voice,
Remus looked up,
"I would be."
He whipped around on his heel to face Dumbledore, and the gaze in Harry's eye was rotten. It could have killed a man. He forgot all about stupid things like dignity or respect and snapped.
"Draco! Today's Saturday!"
"Come inside."
Remus tried his hardest to keep his voice steady,
"We're dating."
Harry kinda looked down, a bit embarrassed,
Harry straightened out his body,
Hermione cocked her head,
They all watched as Draco dove away and grabbed Harry's shaking body, along with a bag and his wand.
"So... what are we going to tell the others? They will be meeting again tonight, in case you didn't know."
Harry only smirked and giggled at his boyfriend and friend's expressions, who were both appalled by Harry's comment.
He smiled at the group then at Draco, who was smiling back.
They stood up and held hands as they walked back into the room in silence. Nobody spoke. The only sound that could be heard was that of the wind outside. Molly finally spoke,
"I'll be here. And when I'm not I'll come back. Whether you want me to or not."
Harry just sniffled and smiled,
"Has this happened to you too, Draco?"
Draco strode out of the room with his head held high and posture perfect. Remus muttered,
Draco just chuckled and shook his head at the nickname for Dumbledore. He sighed lovingly and kissed Harry again, then rested his forehead against Harry's.
Harry pulled his hands close to his chest and gripped his fingers around his wand subconsciously as he felt a single tear drip down his cheek. His voice went even shakier than before as he spoke in a broken whisper,
Draco needed to get help immediately.
"Will my parents be able to find me?"
Ron smiled slightly, which Hermione didn't miss. She turned back,
"That's okay. We don't want to push you. But please...please tell us what was happening when you almost wiped your memory. And when you escaped Malfoy Manor."
"Not in front of others~"
"I can't let you in!"
that someday."
Harry rolled his eyes,
"Exsto imajini."
Draco's face betrayed concern, but he just kissed Harry one more time before taking them both over to the bed.
A silver wisp of hair left his head. He pointed his wand forward and cast a spell,
Draco hiccuped a few times,
"That's not the full story~"
Their minds slipped, and they began to wonder, is this really that bad? This must be normal for him, it can't be too bad. They had fallen into the same trap Lucius had set for his own son.
Arthur held his wife as he finished her thought,
"Harry." Harry conceded, finally answering,
Draco sighed,
Ron couldn't fight off his grin as he turned to Hermione and replied,
Hermione was thinking long and hard.
"He's done weirder."
"Okay guys, I know you guys are a couple, but please stop doing your weird version of flirting and finish explaining."
Remus, Dumbledore, along with Mrs. and Mr. Weasley walked through the door to a red-faced Draco and a Ron and Hermione that looked scarred for life. They looked towards Harry who just shrugged his shoulders smugly. Draco sputtered,
Draco cracked a smirk, but it wasn't the usual smug look. It was mischievous, cunning, and honestly, Harry thought it was hot.
"You win this time. But you better not act that way in front of anyone else. Dear Merlin, you've scarred Weasely and Granger, and that's two too many."
"They would at first, but I can explain it to them."
After a bit of contemplating, he climbed into the bed with Harry, partly from not knowing where else to go, partly from wanting to delay talking to the others for as long as possible, partly from exhaustion, mostly from not wanting to leave Harry alone in this state. Just as he was drifting off, he felt an arm wrap around him and smiled.
"No wonder he had gone into hysterics..."
As they cleaned the dishes from the meals earlier that day, they pitched each other ideas for how to explain this whole situation to the Order.
"Why not?"
"...im sorry..."
"Darling, wait-"
It was only Remus and Dumbledore left. Remus looked over at Dumbledore and asked defeated,
"Tittilando."
Draco looked down and got quieter as he spoke.
"I just do. I know him wel-"
"Really? For me it's the opposite; I can't even fathom eating anything whenever my anxiety messes with me."
"Are we just going to ignore it?"
He took Harry's other hand,
"I'm not a member of the order, Harry. Isn't it obvious?"
"But you've always liked him. You're his teacher's pet!"
"But Harry, you must understand, it was for the greater good-"
"I don't break my promises."
Draco got defensive,
As he walked up the stairs, he thought he could hear faint sniffles. He quickened his pace and made his way to their shared room, seeing Harry curled up on the bed.
This calmed Harry down a bit, and he leaned into Draco's touch. Humming sweetly he shut his eyes and let the corners of his mouth turn up.
"Harry?"
"I'm going to see a friend. Tiddlywinks."
Hermione playfully rolled her eyes and responded,
"I agree whole-heartedly. Now can we please proceed with the meeting?"
Draco looked down at Harry and began to play with the man's hair.
Ron cut in,
The doorbell rang just as Draco set down the last plate onto the drying rack. He quickly dried his hands on a towel and scurried over to the door as quickly as possible.
The intimate moment came to a gentle close when Harry pulled away and both fluttered their eyelids open, smiling softly and looking into the other's eyes. Harry's ended the silence with,
Draco nodded. Remus tilted his head to the side,
"Don't make promises you know you can't keep."
"Septem-nonono, October..."
"Yes. Yes, he is."
Draco looked at Harry with a goofy and hopeful smile,
"Probably. We can't just
He turned back to see that Harry was now fine, and handed the cup to him. Harry took the cup and sipped the water, only to gulp it all down after Draco sent him a look.
"Guys...he
How could Dumbledore have done that? When did that break down happen? How did Ron handle it? How did
"The Order has their meeting at 12:00 instead of 7:00 today!"
Ron looked somberly at Remus, his parents, and arguable most importantly, Dumbledore. He shook his head and asked,
Draco cocked an eyebrow,
Kreacher popped into the living room with a crack.
talk about it for...forever."
He pocketed his wand and went to walk out and follow Harry, but stopped in the doorway and turned back to say,
"Master Draco, Kreacher has finished the meal Master Draco asked Kreacher to cook. It is nice to have a Pureblood back in the house, Master Draco."
"We let you stay here. Once you have completed a task."
"THIS! This is who you are! We serve the Dark Lord, and we lead the most virtuous life possible!
Everyone else looked away, causing Harry to subconsciously scoot a little closer to his lover. Hermione answered for everyone,
How he had tried his hardest to walk as quietly as possible whenever in her house, how he was always just so thin after breaks, how ecstatic he had been at the love of their family, only allowing some people to touch him, and the flinching, oh Merlin the flinching! She had always thought Harry was being polite and well-behaved when he always insisted on doing the chores, but now she knew better.
Harry's shoulder stiffened out of surprise; he had forgotten how important promises were to some people. His had so often been broken.
Harry didn't open his eyes, but his brows furrowed. He frowned and crossed his arms, pouting,
know? Did you leave him there, even though you knew?"
"He had to get out of the house because of...of um...reasons..."
"Where's Dumbledore?"
"i left the manor but i still cant escape it all..."
"It's not as simple as 'just leave'. There was nowhere that would have me, and there was nowhere I could go that my parents--and eventually the other Death Eaters--wouldn't eventually find me. And it was my home. I couldn't just leave home."
Draco flinched slightly at the use of the name he hated with a burning passion, and the tone he knew too well, mustering up an explanation,
Dumbledore mused at the situation before him, expecting the reaction and not being nearly as shocked as everyone else.
"Is there not anybody else there?"
"Oh shit!"
"You know, Harry, sometimes I-"
"You can come back now. It's finished."
Draco tenderly undressed Harry to change him into pajamas, trying his best in this odd circumstance to not look, and respect his boyfriend's privacy. Once Harry was in pajamas, Draco laid him on the bed and placed the cover over him.
Humming in agreement, Draco kept playing with Harry's hair. Even though this probably wasn't the best time, he knew that no time would ever be a good time. So, he diverted the conversation and asked directly,
"them! You know very well what you did!"
"Whatever could you mean, Draco?"
"I don't break my promises."
Ron shook his head in disbelief as he got up out of the chair and put his hands up as if in surrender. The screech of wood against wood pained everyone's ears, and he stepped out of the room. Hermione quickly followed.
Harry followed Draco's gaze to the door and didn't say anything while glancing between it and his secret lover, knowing from the countless times he had snuck in that Draco was checking for Lucius and Narcissa.
"October 15th, 1998."
Harry stared at the wall. Draco picked him up and made Harry turn to face him,
"What do you mean?"
Harry was still blank and unresponsive while Draco kept his eyes up, swearing to himself not to be deterred so quickly after the victory he had just won. Remus stepped forward, the first to talk,
A silence fell over the room. Despite it, Remus continues,
"Are we just going to ignore Draco going into hysterics? Are we just going to ignore how they are together? Are we just going to ignore Harry having a breakdown? Are we just going to ignore the literal sobs upstairs?!"
"I'm not gonna give some long story since it's not my story to tell, but Harry almost wiping his memory is true. I found him in the dorm room alone sitting on his bed, wand in hand. He was really about to do it..."
"Shut the fuck up with your 'greater good' bullshit."
"And where is that, exactly?"
"How ya' feeling?"
"I came through your window, your parents caught us, you escaped and dragged me along with you, we got here, and everyone was surprised."
"Did you
Harry looked Draco in the eye and mirrored Draco's statement from the day before but with a smile this time,
"Draco! To find you in bed with a boy, Harry Potter no less! You are an ungrateful, absolute piece of shit! Merlin, I can't even stand to look at you. Remember all those times we took care of you, put up with you, fed you! And this is how you thank us?! Turning into a faggot and traitor! Is this why you refused the arrangement we made for you with Pansy?! Because you would rather live as a horrible mistake than redeem yourself?!"
"Well,"
Remus began,
Remus balled up his fist, held his head high, and strode out of the room, leaving Dumbledore all alone.
The lovers looked at the door with guilt and fear etched into every scar and crease of their faces at the exact moment it opened to show Lucius and Narcissa, mortified.
"Harry, we can't afford anyone leaking any information. I'm sorry."
"I think so too."
Draco continued nonsensically rambling nothings. Unlike the rest of the Order, who was distraught from looking at the break down happening right before their eyes, Dumbledore raised his hand.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows,
Draco chuckled slightly,
"Why are you leaving?"
"Whatever do you mean? Anyway, there he was, brooding in the mirror, being all dramatic, but he sees me in the mirror looking at him."
Draco rolled his eyes with a scoff and smirked,
"Hey! Um...Harry's in the kitchen washing some dishes."
"Is today a sad day or a tired day?"
"You made me lose all three of my friends in one night. Why?"
The rest of the day passed almost in a blur, with his full-time work training for his Potions Mastery and his column writing during the week, Draco invariably had chores to do on his days off. As he worked in his small patch of a garden which grew basil and tomatoes, mentally checking it off his list of chores, Draco chuckled internally at what his 11-year-old self would have thought had he known that working for his livelihood, staying in almost all nights of the week and doing his own housework was the future he had to look forward to. Draco almost laughed out loud when he remembered that a favourite daydream of 11-year-old Draco had been marrying a well-bred and beautiful woman and taking over all the Malfoy business concerns while being an admired and respected member of society, with people kowtowing to his wishes and accepting his word as the final say in all matters.
Several hours later, Draco emerged from the daze he had fallen into while reading the book. He was, quite frankly, shocked at how absorbed he had been, he couldn’t remember the last time he had finished a book in a single sitting. While the book was fresh in his mind, Draco started on his first draft:
Pansy smirked at him, “This is the Muggle version of Veritaserum, darling. They call it Truth Serum, and I tried it last month when I was out with Ne---new friends. And as for how these bottles got here, that is quite easy – I just brought them over the last time we met and put them at the back of your cabinet. I knew you would never find them, given that you never drink anything but a glass of Firewhiskey on your own, and the only other person who comes to this house is Blaise and I know that prick always brings his own elf-made wine because everything else is just too lowly for his self-professed exquisite taste.”
But he supposed there was some value in what Pansy had said to him, he did feel
Draco resented the implication that he was not ‘over himself’ and proceeded to tell Pansy so in his most no-nonsense tone. Predictably, it had no effect on her. Unless smirking at him counted as an effect, and if it did, it certainly wasn’t the desired effect.
x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x
Love is when you know that if your everyday started like this, you would be happy forever.
On Monday morning, the noted exception to the 7.30 rule, Draco found himself blinking awake when the sun was much higher in the sky than expected. Casting a Tempus, Draco found to his shock that it was close to 11. Although Draco had built-in Monday as the day he had a lie-in, he never woke later than 9, so he quickly got washed and dressed, ready to take on the rest of Monday. He may not have an alarm for Monday but that didn’t mean he had no schedule for the day. On Mondays, his Editor would usually owl back with comments on Draco’s latest column, which Draco would work on all day and send the final version by evening for publication the coming Sunday.
It is the exchanged ‘how was your day’s and ‘I love you’ which you never forget to say to each other at night. The ‘thank yous’ after your (invariably mind-blowing) orgasms.
Love is hearing him say your name, softly, as rarely as you say his. Your name has never sounded as good as it does when he says it. He doesn’t say it very often either. You discussed it once, but neither of you are very sure why you don’t take each other’s names. That’s just how it is.
By 9 pm that night, when Pansy had still not shown up, Draco was almost hopeful that she had changed her mind and was willing to let his column be published in its present form. However, if he was realistic, knowing Pansy as he did, Draco was doubtful that she would have forsaken the chance to yell at him for his perceived flaws in the way that only one’s bossy best friend could.
So, with a glass of merlot in his hand and good old John on his lap (the book, naughty), Draco looked towards his weekend with reasonable anticipation. Five years after the War, capitalized as it would always be in his mind, Draco’s low-drama, low-excitement life was a hard-won thing and something he had not expected to be able to achieve. With the anticipation of a new book to read, Draco took a large sip from his drink and got to it.
Pansy glared at him, gulped down her drink in one go and continued as if he had not said anything. “Draco, for Salazar’s sake stop talking rot and let me finish my point while you finish your drink. Despite your juvenile assertions in the afternoon, I have read Alexandra’s book and I do think you are not doing it justice. The book is written with the best of intentions and could improve the lives of many people who are living with their past mistakes and fears. Your review makes the book sound both useless and manipulative and that could not be further from the truth.” Pansy pulled out her wand and refilled both their drinks again.
Once again, Draco was reminded of what a Slytherin Pansy was, and also how well she could read him. He watched as she poured some brandy, some orange liqueur and lemon juice into two glasses, taking one for herself and passing the other to him.
It is knowing that you can fight viciously because you trust him to not leave you and he trusts you the same way and even the most vicious fight can’t change that.
At this point in his internal monologue, Draco realized he was even more drunk than he had previously assumed. There were two tells: the first was that he called Voldemort by his name in his mind, something he could never manage sober. The second was the fact that Draco had acknowledged that sixth and seventh year had happened, something he did not otherwise allow himself to do. Perhaps there was some value in what Pansy had been ranting about – maybe he did have a slight tendency to box things up and shove them away rather than acknowledge the truth of his feelings and his ‘trauma’.
Unfortunately, it was possible that the several drinks had impacted his persuasive ability somewhat, because he was sure he had made his point before – “s-s-so Pansy darling, it just cannot stand, you see. This book epi-epimot-epitomises everything goody-two-shoes and soft and everything I don’t condone. If this Alexandra witch is to be believed, you can just apologise for your mistakes and everyone will forgive you! You know that’s not true Pans! First of all, if I started apologizing to everyone I hurt, that would have to become my only task for years to accomplish, and also!” Draco hiccupped and took another good swallow of his drink, “these are really quite potent for drinks that Muggles came up with. Anyway, as I was sh-sh-shaying – imagine if I went up to Granger or Weasley or even Potter and apologized to them about my mistakes! They would be more likely to curse me than forgive me, and I say this knowing their painful Gryffindor dislike of Dark curses. So there!” Draco felt that his ending probably needed some work, but he was sure this argument would have convinced Pansy.
Out-maneouvered by Pansy’s Slytherin strategems, Draco resigned himself to a complete disrupted evening schedule and decided to complete his evening tasks in advance to prepare for Pansy.
“So I take it you are here in the capacity of my Editor’s assistant and not my friend” Draco smirked, knowing that Pansy would be affronted at being called Editor’s assistant rather than Assistant Editor. “And anyway, what do you mean rot? I think it should be amply clear that Alexandra Humboldt and her nonsensical book do not pass muster by my standards.”
It is waking up a few hours later, knowing with absolute certainty that he’s up, he’s dressed and he’s walking around the house as he does every morning.
Love is how your names sound together. Draco and Harry.
So sorry for the delay in uploading this chapter! Work has been bonkers! Kudos and comments are so so so appreciated!
“Potter was terrible at Potions! Good think he didn’t have to defend wizarding kind with a potion or we would all be dead! And more to the point - I was not
Well, Pansy seemed to have come determined on a fight, so a fight she would have. Draco gave her his most arrogant smirk – “Why, Pansy darling, you talk as if you’ve actually read the book and we both know you don’t read. So why don’t you stick to what you do best – shopping, gossiping, occasionally working, and let me focus on the reading and reviewing?” By the time he finished his sentence, Pansy’s eyes were narrowed with anger.
One advantage of today’s otherwise disastrous evening was that Draco was truly sozzled in a way he had not allowed himself to be the last 5 years. Partly because being sozzled on a regular basis did not really lend itself to an orderly life; and partly because in the horrific days of his sixth and seventh year at Hogwarts he had been more often drunk than not, finding alcohol the only solace in an otherwise terrifying world. Once Voldemort was defeated, Draco promised himself that he would never be in a situation where alcohol dependency was the only way to survive.
“A Muggle concoction, darling – well, well, you certainly have moved on from your school years. Who exactly are these new friends, Pansy? I don’t remember you mentioning them, and you have been looking especially lively lately. Anything interesting to share?” Draco quirked his eyebrow at Pansy, taking the glass and sniffing it tentatively before taking a sip. “This is surprisingly good” he added somewhat grudgingly.
Sitting down to breakfast, Draco flipped through the Daily Prophet – much as he hated that dross, it paid to stay updated when one’s career relied on reviewing the latest fads. As always, Potter had been photographed no fewer than 6 times in the paper, going in and out of shops in Diagon Alley, with thinly-veiled insinuations that he had developed various unsavoury habits after quitting the Aurors a year ago. Draco grimaced as he took in Potter’s glare from the cover of the Prophet: if looks could kill, the photographer for this shot would be dead ten times over. The cover photo seemed to be of Potter leaving a pub late some night. He was with a companion, although only a profile was visible, so it was unclear if the companion was the Weasley sister or some new paramour.
Potter! We were rivals! Arch-nemesisis…nemeses! We hated each other and we were on opposite sides of the war and if anyone was obsessed with anyone it was Potter who was obsessed with me! Don’t you remember him following me around all year – I had to get Greg and Vince to…” at that, Draco’s voice trailed off, unwilling to linger on memories of Greg or Vince; one lost forever and the other lost to him – it was too painful to consider.
That conniving bint, Draco thought to himself, but it was more with affection than anger.
Love is not the big things that you have done for each other, you pretending not to recognise him, him saving your life, your mother saving his. Love is the everyday, the simplicity, the familiarity, the security of having someone to whom you come first.
and the actual letters will be
Sure enough, just as Draco was about to start making his post-prandial chamomile tea when his Floo dinged and Pansy came back through, still dressed in her work clothes and somehow looking as fresh as she had earlier. Maybe yelling at your friends kept you youthful and energetic? Draco wondered if he should try doing more of it before realizing that his only close friend was Pansy and she would definitely yell back.
So there Pansy, Draco thought to himself, he could acknowledge every bloody thing he wanted.
“Pansy, darling, you look amazing as always. To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?” Draco asked, moving towards Pansy with a smile. Pansy gave him a haughty look from under her lashes, which he took to mean he had displeased her in some way; he did not yet know what, but undoubtedly he was about to find out.
Taking a healthy gulp, Draco felt like he was back on solid ground. He could argue about this stupid book for hours. It was his own life and his own sodding failures he did not want to talk about.
Having completed the first of the promised letters, Draco berated himself and the cocktails from hell that he had another such letter to write. All this baring your true self business was very bad on the ego. It wasn’t so much that Draco didn’t realise he had been a less-than-stellar child, he certainly did; but having to relive that part of his life was extremely unpleasant.
Love is the fact that his name is so precious in your mouth that you blush every time you say it. You can hear it in your mind, but you call him by his name so rarely. Maybe because it feels almost unbelievable that you have the right to say his name. Maybe because you think your face cannot hide how you feel about him when his name is on your lips so you just don’t take it. Maybe because you think you only have a finite number of times you can say his name, so you’re saving them to last this lifetime and beyond.
Well, Draco thought to himself with a grimace, he could acknowledge his feelings if he really wanted to. He could acknowledge the fact that at 16 he had realized that his life had been a sham, he could acknowledge the utter betrayal and pain he felt after Voldemort’s return when it sunk in that his father, whom he had idolized for most of his childhood and adolescence, was nothing but a power-hungry bigot. Draco could even acknowledge that he was truly, truly grateful to Potter every single day. Not only for saving his life, not only for speaking for him and his mother at the trials but for just existing and defeating Voldemort and being so good that Draco had been forced to acknowledge that goodness existed.
Draco suddenly realized he had overwatered his tomato plant so badly he could almost hear the plant drowning and gasping for breath, and he quickly charmed away the extra water from the plant, murmured a quick apology to it for his distraction (Merlin, he was talking to plants now) and went in to make himself a soothing cup of tea and find something else to occupy his time.
“Very Hufflepuff of you, Pans, all these
“Finally,” Draco murmured, “we are getting to the actual reason you came here. I almost thought you had only come to harangue me over non-existent problems.”
“Pansy, what the fuck are these bottles and how did they get into my house?” Draco hissed at her, annoyed both by her preaching and the fact that she seemed to be more familiar with his alcohol cabinet than he was.
“For fuck’s sake Pansy, I have NO idea where you think you get off with your bloody righteousness.
Plus, Draco thought that his reviews did reveal something of his personality, even if not his identity. You could build an image of the author from his views and his language: someone with high standards, exquisite taste, someone who understood his position in society as an arbiter of fashion, and most of all, someone who was a jaded cynic. Someone who could be counted on to entertain and to devastate with his words, but not someone who would openly wear his feelings on his sleeve, visible on his face and in his impossibly green eyes. If this hypothetical someone was to have green eyes, of course. This was definitely a hypothetical someone who was definitely
“Pansy, Pansy, Pansy, you poor innocent soul” Draco was surprised he could say that with a serious face, but he ploughed on, “you’re confused about their intentions! I admit, none of the Golden Trio cursed us in Hogwarts, and for that matter, they may even have defended us a time or two when some gits tried to attack us, but that does not mean they want our apologies or regret or friendship or affection! This simply won’t do, Pansy, you’re withering away waiting for their affection and you’re never going to get it. You must move on, Pansy dearest, this moping isn’t good for you.” Draco was sure this argument would have convinced her. It had to.
