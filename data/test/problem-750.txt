"Well, Pansy's not only a lot more eloquent, but also a lot more violent. She'd beat you up for your obvious machinations."
"Second class mail please," Draco said politely, handing over his application when he finally reached the counter. He handed over the sweaty pile of coins he had prepared beforehand even while the lady was weighing his item. He had researched the postal system thoroughly, and could recite the entire price table if required.
"How about you? Are you going to visit Narcissa in Bordeaux? Will you be spending Christmas with your mother?"
"Yes, I—" he stopped himself. He had never imagined that he would ever speak so plainly about his feelings. For the longest time, he had lost himself in his plots to convince Harry that he was worthy of his time and love, only to convey his affection through his hands, his tongue, and his body. He had entered the arrangement with his eyes open as a contractor of professional services, and there was no space for his feelings. His flights of fancy were a disgrace, but it was worse to trigger the termination for convenience clause in their contract. "The letters reminded me that I was unworthy of your time, that our relationship is a contractual agreement. I forget that all this is fake so often, and I would think about seeing you next all the time, about our home and how many children we could have, and I would think about it when I was with you, when you were gone, and the letters helped me to remember that it's not my future nor my present reality."
"But Malfoy's friends are so weird!" Harry complained just as an origami crane settled gracefully in front of him. He looked up only to see the Malfoy chatting with one of the younger Slytherins.
"What did you get now?" Malfoy scrambled over with poorly disguised excitement. "Come on, give it to Draco," he said as he tugged on the bundle.
"Well, you have me now, does it count?" Harry asked as he settled his hand on Draco's waist, an earnest expression on his face.
"Alright, that sounds good," Harry continued to nod. "No skipping lunch though," he pointed at Malfoy accusingly when he remembered. He mimicked Malfoy's eye roll.
He had set aside concerns about his image, writing about coming of age duties and the stress, before requesting for wisdom and a pillar of support. Seven out of fifteen of them had gone unanswered, six had returned with unrelated advice, of which five of those had invited his family to visit during Lunar New Year. The last two letters had been carefully probing and equally vague, and Draco had been so happy for a whole week, that Pansy had refused to sit with him.
Harry waved his wand for the calendar to flip ahead, watching Draco as he took in the exclusive photograph. Draco felt his mouth dry at the picture of a wet, naked, and half hard Potter standing in the sea. Water reaching in the middle of his cock, Harry tilted his head as he combed his matted hair back carelessly. He burst into laughter when a strong wave collided against him.
"You better continue with that. Leave the less important things to me," Draco said quickly as he burrowed his legs deeper with a smirk. He tore the envelope open.
"Oh, no. It doesn't. I've just been in possession of your preferences for more than twenty years,” she raised her brow at him delicately.
"Well, the amounts of maturity we possess between the two of us would definitely impress everyone." He shrugged before quickly switching topics. "To be honest, I wouldn't have believed that we could manage half a day without maiming each other too seriously."
to open it and it's not even mine!" He gaped when Malfoy only continued to prepare for his shower. He was sure that he had seen the flicker of intrigue in Malfoy's eyes before it had quickly flashed to fright and deliberate nonchalance.
Walking back to their dorms after a sumptuous weekend breakfast at the Great Hall, Potter bumped his shoulder against Draco's while recounting the Quidditch match he had caught on the Wireless the day before.
"Oh," Draco looked away in embarrassment even though his careful delight was obvious. It was moments like this that endeared Draco to Harry deeply—Draco tried his best to come across uncaring and abrasive, but he was actually thoughtful, eager to please and terribly awkward.
Pansy was leaning over Hermione while Hermione's neck craned back to look at her. Draco was confused by the sight before him—Hermione had set her quill aside in favor of the interaction, and she didn’t seem put out on having her concentration broken, or affected by Pansy's smirk.
"Your wandless has improved," Hermione commented, rubbing her neck as she waved off his apologies. Harry could only stare uncaringly at the both of them. He didn't want to start another argument, but they would have known about his wandless if they had decided to spare even a bit of time to help rebuild Hogwarts together.
Harry stood in the middle of his new quarters, hands on his waist as he made a slow turn. He looked at the light filtering through the gauze blinds, the mantelpiece adorned with photographs chronicling Teddy's childhood, the doors leading to his bedroom and the study, the shaky bookshelf stuffed with books from his previous jobs, and a thick rug under the overstuffed leather sofa he had both brought from Grimmauld Place. Being constantly on the road had left him with few possessions—there had been little that had been essential, his trunk unexpanded when he left for Hogwarts.
In a grey vest thrown atop a crisp white button down and a marching set of grey pants, Potter looked like every wet dream Draco had ever had, his sharp attire accentuating his natural, if not slightly dangerous appeal. Draco felt his cheeks flush as he shifted in his seat.
"Don't think about it too much. And drink up before you sleep!" Ron called out when Harry lumbered off huffily. Everybody was brushing him off today and it was frustrating, if not hurtful.
“Merlin, it’s ridiculous,” Draco swore under his breath as he replaced the vial in Harry’s hand impatiently with a concentrated bath concoction that boasted calming and muscle relaxing properties.
“No, it’s not. It’s seven cakes only,” Harry argued as he paid for his purchases, ignoring the confused look from the usual cashier that had returned from her break.
While his future depended on his grades, there was only so much that it could help when the Malfoy name was so utterly ruined. The truth was that the broom had come to be synonymous with his failure in the Room of Requirements and the culmination of his loss of control. His mind healer had told him to view it as an escape, as a source of freedom, but Draco simply couldn’t relinquish the firm comfort of the ground.
It was illogical that there was only one shared narrow entrance and exit to the Hufflepuff common room. An entering student could not do so when another was exiting and vice versa, he elaborated in earnest. Much less running back to the dorms to pick up a forgotten essay in the morning. A whole line of students would be waiting to exit, making entering impossible.
Taking the London underground never ceased to be awe inspiring – from working the ticketing machines to watching the trains pull up, Draco had come to the fact that Muggles were incredibly intelligent individuals with great forays into the field of component design, a branch of study they called
Shrugging when Malfoy didn't react, Harry returned to his book, trying to make himself look busy as he thought about Ron and Hermione's arrival, and the presents he had ordered for Malfoy.
Draco looked up in confusion as Weasley elbowed Potter, who had been reading about weed removal in magical gardens and houses.
Potter's face darkened similarly. "Well, Teddy's definitely old enough for a toy broom." Potter crossed his arms on the table like the heathen that he truly was.
Harry slanted his eyes at him. "Of course, that's why you've spent two years creating three potions."
"I had a great time there," Harry said as he bumped his shoulder against Draco's in an attempt to comfort. The arrangements for The Quiet had been bound by robust nondisclosure agreements between the proprietor and the lodger.
"We all make mistakes, Potter. What good would they be if we can't learn and then joke about them after?" He combed his fingers through his hair. "I must say though, that I trusted that you would recognise me and spare my life." He continued unrepentant as he wiggled his brows in challenge.
me! Do you know how long I spent finding that present for you?" Harry felt his heart aching as he remembered how Draco had insulted his gift yesterday just because he wanted Harry to what, cry for him?
"It's your hair. You didn't manage to tame your cowlick," Harry said quietly as he reached over to attempt it himself.
"Sexy," he finished as he finally nuzzled against the fattened cock, pressing a kiss to the underside of it as he sank to his knees, trailing to the leaking tip with his tongue before sucking the engorged head wetly. Conjuring lube wandlessly (having constant sex with a wizard really changed things), Draco reached to fondle Harry's balls, relishing in the breathless moans escaping from his lover.
Draco closed his eyes as he touched his forehead weakly. "This is like sixth year all over again," he mumbled to himself disbelievingly. Harry seemed to have taken it upon himself to sleuth through his private activities.
The ill-timing of Pansy's remark with Potter's presence was not lost on Draco. He pulled his friend forward towards the train, only for her to hold her ground.
"Pans, we're just a little confused, and we'd like to talk. Can we go somewhere more private?" Hermione said as she pulled her boyfriend away from Pansy.
Narcissa nodded with an amused smile. "I don't think that his ego would ever recover if you said no."
"Potter, fuck!" Malfoy scolded as he pressed a hand over his heart. "Where's your manners, you can't just barge in here and–" he lowered his voice into a sharp whisper when Harry shushed him. "–scare people like this! Didn't your mother–" Malfoy paused, flushing with embarrassment.
Quickening his pace when Draco arched into him, Harry pressed his moans against Draco's neck as the pleasure mounted in him.
"Found it on the table. You're not using it so it's mine," Draco shrugged as he made a short note on the parchment. Harry had been converted by Draco to use biros instead of a quill, and his handwriting now looked better than Draco's slanted scrawl. The downside to the convenience and improvement in penmanship was that his pens were always disappearing.
"Mate," Ron said with a slow shake of his head and a look of what seemed like pity. "It's getting a bit out of hand."
Draco had been grateful for their presence when he had settled into Hampstead. It had taken him a while to orient himself and assimilate into Muggle culture, but he had eventually managed.
The deep resignation on Harry's face dissolved momentarily when he looked up to wave the gratitude away. Countless of interdepartmental memos and updates had come in overnight, and he was busy reading them.
Likewise, Hermione did not hold back - "Harry's not wrong, you know? You don't even tell me things, and we're supposed to be friends," Hermione gave Draco a pointed look when he shifted uncomfortably at the F word.
Grabbing his cloak for lunch, he finally noticed the missive on his desk. It was plain and unassuming, but Draco felt his heart race as he looked at it. No interdepartmental notes had arrived at his table, and for a letter to simply materialise? Looking around the room, he reached for the letter carefully. It unfolded at his touch.
Draco felt his cheeks flush as he rearranged himself with a forced air of nonchalance. Bloody Blaise and Pansy. He had hardly been staring adoringly! Knowing the couple, Pansy would learn about his staring in no time, and he would hear no end of it. "I think that you've gotten yourself mixed up with me, Blaise. Though I'm sure that everyone on the platform has gotten a good glimpse of Pansy's arse."
“Oi, Malfoy,” Harry complained when Draco continued to look dramatically into space, subjecting them to the elements. The rain cloud above them was only getting darker, the puddle in the corridor steadily expanding, and Harry looked like he was beginning to fear for his life, if not from a lightning strike, or a massive cold from being so wet in Scotland’s miserable winter. He shoved Draco, motioning for him to get along with the counterspell, lest he insisted on another round of thunderstorm to ensure that he had mastered the counterspell. Harry flicked his wet fringe out of his spectacles, glaring at Draco when he only brought the atmospheric charm to a drizzle instead of ceasing it entirely. “Show off,” he complained, casting an impervious charm for himself and following it with drying spells.
Neither catching up with his notes-making for Transfiguration nor studying for Potions appealed to him. Biting the inside of his mouth, he slumped in his chair as he peeked at Malfoy who was frowning while reading a book about Ancient Runes. He returned to inspect his list. He couldn't start Potions without Malfoy's help, but he was also too hungry to sit through a month's worth of notes-making without food in his belly.
"Harry," he called out sharply when the other only continued to follow him with his eyes. "Harry, any books to return?" He asked as he stood in front of his friend, ready to leave for Russell Square.
"Alright, thanks for attending and complying with the dress code. Look forward to the next eighth year party!" Seamus interrupted as he clapped his hands loudly.
Hermione beamed at him while Weasley watched on with wry amusement as he combed through Hermione's bushy hair with his fingers.
"So be it, then. You'll have to come up top amongst all the Aurors. You're not allowed to tamper the test papers of others, encourage them to throw the paper, or try to attain a copy of the paper before the test," he said as he turned the heat on high.
"A splash of milk and three sugars. Was I wrong?" Mrs. Malfoy said as she squeezed a bit of lemon in hers.
“I'll probably need a little more than that since we'll be missing three lessons," Harry suggested hopefully. This way he would definitely be able to see Draco even if he didn't want to visit the Burrow.
Granger looked at the both of them thoughtfully. "A lack of action to see through the change. You seem more inclined to watch it play out in comfort. Nothing against you nor the Slytherin house in general, but I second Malfoy's judgement."
Leaving Hogwarts worried, Draco wondered if Harry would turn up for the interhouse gathering at Three Broomsticks in the evening. He was disappointed that he would only be able to apologise for not being there for Harry's match an entire day later.
"Yeah, she's been busy with fittings for the entire school, but I don't have to meet her every day, you know?" Draco replied with a frown, confused by the direction of their conversation.
"What does that mean? Are you going to work at Hogwarts as a faculty member? What about the Aurors? This isn’t an offer letter, Potter." Draco asked in rapid fire, his face pink from agitation.
"Healer Draco?" Potter repeated as his eyes returned to Draco once more, giving him a slow once over. Draco desperately tried not to react to the sound of his first name in Potter's timbre.
“Do you want to vanish it?” He asked as he tried his best to focus on opening his own present instead. He wished that he had been a lot prissier about his wrappers just so that it would take longer. “Oh bloody,” he instead burst into laughter at the sight of his gift.
This is my first fic! This is going to be slow moving I think, I’m going to post as often as possible.
After class, when Ron was still complaining about how he couldn’t do it, but Hermione got it on her first try, they headed to transfiguration. In the hall, he got lost in his thoughts. What would a mind healer be like? Would Dumbledore or McGonagall be talking to the Dursley’s? Would it make a difference? Would the ministry get involved?
They reached the common room and the smell of a hangover potion drifted their way. The boys walked over to a table near the fire where Draco had a cauldron set up. Draco sighed, and said, “You too? I brewed this originally for Pansy, but I guess everyone but me got drunk last night.”
Harry smiled and pulled Draco into a kiss. Murmuring against his lips, Harry said, “I hope you keep doing art. And maybe take up the violin again?”
He put his forehead on his knees and tried to breathe, but it didn’t do much. He suddenly heard a voice calling out to him “Come on Harry, breathe. Deep breaths.” He could feel the voice take a couple of loud, deep, breaths and he tried to copy it. Slowly, he found it slightly easier to breathe.
“I grew up with my aunt and uncle Dursley. They lied about everything in my life, told me my parents were unemployed drunks  and died in a car accident, and tried to hide the fact that I was a wizard..” He paused, trying to decide what to say next, but just as he was about to continue, Draco interrupted. “I can’t believe that the boy who lived, Harry Potter grew up as a muggle.”
“Most of them were burned. I chose my favorites, and they were hung on the wall of my room.” Draco paused again and looked at Harry. The brunette noticed and gave a soft smile, leaning forward and giving his boyfriend a soft kiss.
The two layed next to each other, Harry snuggling up against Draco’s side. Draco was the first to speak. “I have a lot of scars. The dark mark… is something else too. I’m guessing you have just as many.” Harry nodded, waiting for the blonde to finish. “I… I think we should show each other all our scars before we do anything more, so there are no surprises.” Harry nodded and sat up and finished shrugging the shirt off his shoulders.
So... I was planning on skipping ahead to eight year after five but then this got pushed back a chapter, and I really liked writing about Gregor. So, let me know whether you think I should skip ahead or add a couple chapters in between, maybe one for each year(other than seventh, I don’t really want to write about the war, though I might add some flashbacks later on). This was a long one so I hope you enjoyed. Oh, and I just wanted to say that the name Gregor Collins is completely random, I used a random name generator until I found a name I didn’t hate.
Pansy asked, “What in Merlin’s beard is the silent treatment?” Luna laughed at her girlfriend and said, “It’s when a person doesn't talk to or ignores someone else because they are or annoyed at that person.”
The game continued for a little while longer, but nothing exciting or interesting happened. As 9:30 rolled around Hermione spoke up. “We do have classes starting tomorrow. We should all head to bed; we shouldn’t be late for our first day of class.”
Draco sighed. “Just because he broke up with the Weaselette, doesn't mean he’s gay,” he said with an eye roll. Pansy just smiled. They reached the Eighth year table and everyone sat down and as usual, the food magically appeared and they dug in.
Draco smiled but waited a moment before speaking. “I never said I was a good artist. Anyway, where was I?”
Gregor looked impressed. “Correct. Along with those, it’s much stronger than is necessary. I’m sure if you found somebody to personally brew your potions, they could brew a version that wears off more quickly and is weaker, but we don’t have those kinds of resources.”
Harry said, “My nightmares often cause panic attacks. It would be nice, Ron, if you could try to get me out of the room or the other boys out of the room. I really don’t want them to see me like that.”
After a moment Harry started to speak, “It started ok I guess. We have our own table and common room. It is going pretty smoothly, and it was really nice to get to know the Slytherins, and not be expected to fight with them.” He took a deep breath and finished with a smile, “Draco has changed a lot. He-he’s actually very sweet… I’m bi, and we are dating.”
Harry was so surprised that he just sat there and stared at the two women, only snapping out of his daze when Luna said, “Truth or Dare, Harry.”
“Draco and I walked into the common room. Hermionie was on the verge of tears, and everyone was silent.” Harry paused, trying to figure out what to say next. “Ron was in my room, and I talked to him for a minute before I went to talk to Hermionie. Basically, Hermionie wanted more in the bedroom, and Ron wasn’t up for it. He decided that Hermionie was better off without him.”
“It's Luna. Nothing too serious, Madam Pomfrey should have her fixed up soon. She fell out of a tree she was climbing, looking for nargles. She broke her arm, but I don’t think it was too bad. Just wanted to let you know.”
Harry quickly responded, “Oh, no. I just kinda figured that you wouldn’t want everybody to know our business. I’m kinda used to it, being Harry Potter and all. It’s kinda annoying.”
As they pulled away from each other, he took a deep breath before saying, “Will you go out with me, Draco?” His heart warmed at the smile that spread across Draco’s face when he responded with a quiet yes.
Everyone laughed and Hermionie said, “We chose to come, and with someone other than them you might not fail. Plus we wanna see you hex Draco. We know if we did it to him, he would fire back, but he wouldn’t hurt you.”
Smiling, Parkinson explained the rules. “If you chicken out of either a truth or dare, you take a shot. If someone brings up the war, everyone takes a shot. Got it?” Everyone nodded. Pansy smiled and said, “Good. Draco, you start.”
Draco’s eyes widened in surprise. “Since when are you a bottom?! There is no way! I’ve known you for longer than I can remember, and I always thought you would be a top!”
Draco slowly sat up and pulled off the shirt, folding it up neatly to organize his thoughts. “The ones on this hand were from the fire, in the room of requirement. There are the ones all over my chest from that night in the bathroom. There are some self-inflicted ones on my arms, then… there are the ones on my back.” Draco then turned around, talking over his shoulder. “These… were from my father’s belt.”
When he was flying, he was always in his own little world. He was separated from all the drama in the waking world. He didn’t have to think about if his grades would be good enough for his father, or if he would be beaten because of the dark mark that was forced upon him. He didn’t have to worry if he could get a suitable job.
He woke up with a pounding headache. He turned over and groaned, remembering what happened last night, or parts of it. Why had he gotten so drunk on a school night? He turned over and literally rolled out of bed and as he picked himself up off the floor, he just hoped that someone had brewed up a hangover potion.
“Actually, yes. I was wondering about my privacy. I don’t really want the prophet talking all about my childhood. It wasn’t exactly ideal, or very bright.” Gregor answered immediately, “I promise that anything said in here, stays in here. I completely understand that you don’t want more attention than you already have. Anything else?”
They all headed back to their common room, and someone broke out the fire whiskey. As they all celebrated the Gryffindors victory, Draco found himself gravitating towards Harry, and silently scolded himself. Harry didn’t want to be with him, Harry wasn’t even gay.
“I-I-I’ll be alright for now. I probably won’t stop being off until it stops raining, but we can go back to class now. I’ll be ok.”  He slowly stood up, and his legs giving out once, but,  he managed to walk back into the classroom.
As the Trio walked down to the lake, he started to wonder what Hermione and Ron’s reactions would be. Hermione would probably be a bit concerned and immediately run off to the library to do research. Ron- who knows what Ron will say.
The Hufflepuff meekly said, “I’m sorry.” Hie cast his eyes on the ground with tears welling in them. Harry breathed in deeply and said, “I understand that you think that Draco is a murderer, but you need to get to know people before you go hexing them. Would you have hexed him if he was anybody else?”
A blush crept up his neck up till his face and Harry rubbed the back of his neck with a hand and asked, “How did you know?”
They reached the classroom and filed in. Starting class, the professor collected the essays they had for homework, and had them turning rats into water goblets. Ron at least had a fuzzy goblet with a tail. Hermione’s, of course was perfect. He couldn’t focus, therefore his was still very much a rat.
As his free period came to an end, he went down to the common room where he met the rest of the Eighth years on their way to DADA. The class passed uneventfully, and soon people were heading to lunch. As lunch started, it started raining outside.
As his mind started spiraling out, he slowly drifted in to an uneasy sleep. With his mind still going crazy, he had nightmares, back to being trapped in that closet, starving, scared, the times when he had beef beaten with Uncle Vernons belt, or when Dudley would beat him to a pulp. Or Malfoy spilling to the papers, the whole world knowing about where he lived.
He woke up in a surprisingly good mood. It was Monday, and his first time meeting Gregor was yesterday. He woke Ron up and threw his robes on. He ran down the stairs. He spotted Hermione and said, “Let’s go down to breakfast early. I want to say hi to Hagrid during lunch, so that means we should stop at the kitchens after breakfast, if we actually want to eat.”
Well. Thank you to my beta, Liiizzaabeth_Rose. Sorry I didn’t update in a while, I’ve had a kinda crazy life right now.
Sam looked skeptical, and he said, “Well, I think that he would hex me back. Or at least give me the silent treatment.” All the purebloods looked puzzled, and those who grew up with muggles laughed.
He got dressed and trudged over to wake Ron up, assuming that Hermione hadn’t gotten as drunk and had already started eating breakfast. He knocked on the door and heard a come in, but not from Ron. He walked in and saw that Ron and Hermionie were standing across the room from each other.
Harry has the next fact about Neville. “One time, in first year actually, Hermione, Ron, and I were sneaking out of the common room, and Neville stood up to us and told us not to. Hermione jinxed him. Full body-bind.”
The game continued until Gregor knocked the tower over. They played once more, before Gregor looked at his watch, and said, “Well, it’s late. You should get back to Hogwarts. I hope to see you in a week?” Harry smiled and nodded, and (a bit nervously) walked into the fire.
Ron laughed and said, “You seem so worried about it. There are more people than you think who are bi. Myself included, though I do lean towards girls.”
Draco slowly let his boyfriend down, keeping his eyes locked with Harry’s. “I don’t know. I’ve never done this before, and you are the first guy I kissed.” Harry looked away, embarrassed; his eyes widened slightly when he felt Draco’s hand softly grip his chin and forced him to look at Draco’s face once again. He saw beautiful silver-blue eyes looking into his green ones.
He chuckled and said, “Well, I don’t really want to do this, but I have a lot of homework I need to get done. Do you wanna help?”
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just a nightmare.” As he saw everybody but Ron go back to bed, he said quietly so the others couldn’t hear, “It was about one time at the Dursley’s. I’m okay now, just a little on edge. I’m not going to be able to sleep for the rest of the night. If you need me, I’ll be in the common room.
The kid shook his head, still cowering away from Harry. Draco moved away from his boyfriend, and towards the first year. At first, the child cowered from him, but Draco bent down and laughed, “I’m not gonna hurt you. I just wanted to show you, I’m not mean, or cold at all. I… I never actually killed anyone in the war.”
The rest of the week passed by uneventfully. As the weekend rolled around Hermione said to him in passing, “Oh yeah, McGonagall wants to see you.” He had been sitting in the common room, trying to get his potions essay done, but his mind kept wandering to where that week had taken him.
Harry was surprised, this was very accurate and it seemed as if Gregor had read his mind. “Yeah. Especially if space is as small as a broom cupboard, or if I wake up from the dream in the middle of it, I sometimes feel like I’m still in the nightmare. It’s a horrible feeling.”
Hours went by and Draco and Harry were still in the room talking about nothing and staying in each other’s company and admiring the wonderful view. Harry pressed a kiss to the top of Draco’s head before saying, “Are you ready to keep telling me about how amazing of an artist you are?”
When they finished dinner and reached the common room, they were all laughing. It was surprising how well they got along when they weren’t on opposite sides of the war. Most of the group sat down on the floor by the fire to chat. Everybody else either studied or had something else they were supposed to do.
Harry smiled again and said, “Thank you, but…” He sighed. “I don’t know. I know we should talk about this, but I don’t know if I want to or if I’m ready to. For now, let’s just hang out, and we can talk about it some other time.”
Gregor stayed silent, knowing that Harry would start talking when he was ready. After a minute, Harry finally spoke up. “This week has been really busy, and honestly, really tiring. Ron and Hermionie broke up. Draco and I spent some time with a first year who tried to hex Draco. Draco and I started opening up to each other about our childhoods.”
As Harry sat down, he said, “Monday was amazing, but by the end of Tuesday everything went downhill.”
The blonde snorted with laughter, saying, “Why on earth would I do that? I want everyone to know we are together. Unless… you don’t want that?”
As they ate, Pansy told him, “You really should just ask him out. I have a hunch that he isn’t straight.” Maybe he wasn’t straight, and Pansy was right, but he would wait until the other boy came out. If he ever did.
Harry had been facing the entrance, and he spun. Harry started making his way to the back, as fast as he could. He paused partway, spotting something. He grabbed it, bringing it with him. “Hey, look what I found!” The brunette held up a mostly intact violin. Draco chuckled. “I don’t think that thing is gonna work. And I haven’t played in years.” Harry rolled his eyes and finished making his way to his boyfriend.
After that, most people had a free period, while others had Arithmancy. Hermionie headed off to class while Harry pulled Ron aside to tell him what happened. After he had told the whole story, he said, “I’m gonna go to the library, there is something I want to look up. I’ll meet you for lunch?” Ron nodded his assent before they went their own ways.
Draco smiled, but before he could talk, someone banged on the door. Harry rolled his eyes before taking a deep breath, taking a step away from the door, and yelling, “Come in!”
He walked over to her, and in a hushed whisper said, “Harry has been crying himself to sleep since the beginning of the year. I brought it up just now and he said to grab you and meet down by the lake. I think he has something to tell us.”
Hermione was the first to respond, saying, “I don’t see why not. Is there a reason you want us to come?”
Harry smiled gently and said, “I still have more to tell if you want to listen.” The blonde shook his head in disbelief. “There’s more?” Harry just gave a small nod.
Frowning slightly, he said, “I’m wondering what outsiders think of me. I heard some older students in the hall talking, saying that I must’ve had everything handed to me.” He sighed.
After McGonagall dismissed the class, Harry walked up to her desk. “What can I do for you, Mr. Potter?”
When the tower was finished, Gregor said, “Why don’t you start?” He pulled a piece from towards the bottom that was blue. He set it on the top and drew the top blue card. “What is your favorite pastime?” He read aloud. “Well, I don’t have much free time, but when I do, I like to read fiction.”
When he walked into the common room, only Ron and Hermione were up, quietly talking. When they saw him they jumped up and as Hermione hugged him, Ron asked, “How did it go, mate?” He shrugged and said, “Better than I expected.” Hermione stepped back and said, “Well, I think we should all get to bed. We do have classes tomorrow.”
He slid down the wall, struggling to breathe. He was shaking, and couldn’t stand. He placed his head in between his knees and did his best to breathe. He sat there for several minutes before a person, who he believed to be Hermoine, came out of the classroom and kneeled in front of him.
As they finished the circle, a few interesting facts were revealed, but most of them were pretty dull. Pansy and Luna were now dating, as of that morning. Other than that, Blaise had never had a serious relationship before.
Gregor stood up and said, “Well, that’s all the time we have for today. If there is anything else, we can talk more another time. For now, you three enjoy the rest of the week. It’s supposed to be sunny all week! Bye!”
He packed his stuff up and headed down to McGonagall’s office. He knocked and heard a “Come in!” from inside. As he opened the door, she said, “Oh it’s you Mr. Potter! Thank you for coming down. I wanted to inform you that you now have an recurring appointment on Sunday evenings at 7:30, just after supper, with a mind healer. I wanted to ask you, would you rather floo or portkey?”
Hermionie sighed and said, “As well as I could be, I suppose.” She glanced at Draco, giving him a skeptical look. The blonde cast his eyes down. Hermionie sighed again and said, “Draco, I think I can trust you. I don’t want to hold grudges from before the war, and I’m doing my best to forget old quarrels.” The blonde looked up, his cheeks tinged pink.
Harry was surprised; whoever it was must be pretty good at hiding it or didn’t spend much time with them. He glanced around the room, trying to figure out who it was, and Draco noticed. “He’s not in here,” he laughed.
Pansy said, “Wait, I wanna see it when he hexs you, can we come with you after dinner?” Harry laughed as Draco glared at Pansy.
Letting out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding, he said sincerely, “Thank you. I’m going to go to bed now, Goodnight.”
“Have a seat,” McGonagall said, gesturing to the empty seat across from her desk. “I have a feeling this is going to take awhile.”
Of course, Harry was the other seeker, so they had very little chance. The only way for them to win was if their chasers did better than the other teams, and their keeper would have to block a lot of shots.
As they left the classroom and headed up to Gryffindor tower, he started thinking. What all had Hermione told professor McGonagall? What would the professor do? Would he go back to the Dursley’s?
Getting up, he, Ron and Hermione grabbed their books and headed to charms. Charms was pretty boring, with only Hermione really listening to Professor Flitwick drone on. The most interesting part of class was when Seamus somehow set his feather on fire, though what they were trying to do was levitate it.
Ron gave a slight laugh, “It gets worse?! Oh Merlin, mate, I really hope that never happens. But seriously, if it does happen, what can we do to help?” He thought. He didn’t know. “I don’t know. I’ve never had someone there to help me. I’ll ask and see if Gregor knows anything.”
At that he smiled. “Ron knows more about something than you?” He said in disbelief. Hermione giggled, “Probably.” At this, Ron walked up. “What’s so funny?” “Mate, how much do you know about mind healers?” “Well,” he reasoned, “Apparently they are like muggle counselors, but don’t trust me on that. Most work for St. Mungo’s, but not all. They are mostly there for people who need someone to talk to, and are supposed to help with coping techniques, and give good advice. Other than that, I don’t know much.”
Hermionie said hesitantly, “I don’t want to ruin the moment, but why don’t you guys go back to the dormitory? It sounds like it’s been a really long day for everyone.” Harry nodded and reached out for Draco’s hand. “Let’s go relax.”
Theodore Nott laughed and said, “Did you know that in fifth year, Blaise and Draco hooked up. Now reminder, Blaise is straight.” As everyone looked at the two, Draco smirked, and Blaise had a furious blush.
“Ok, so that’s something to think about and possibly to bring up with both of your friends. What else happened this week?”
He continued, “Don’t ever think that there is anything you should change about yourself. Is there anything else you would like to share with me?” He thought, “Not really, at least not that I can think of right now. I feel kinda crazy right now, it’s like I had been living with somebody on my back, and they just hopped off. Thank you.”
As everybody got up, people started heading to their rooms. Ron and Hermione had joint rooms, and Harry’s was across the hall from theirs, connecting with Blaise. Dean and Seamus have connecting rooms, and Neville and Nott were next to each other.
Hermione was next. “Umm... As you know, I’m a Muggle-born, and my parents are dentists. They take care of people’s teeth.” Looking around, a lot of people looked surprised, mostly those who grew up in wizarding families.
Finally he said, “I’m sorry. McGonagall wanted to talk to me about the Dursley’s, after she told Malfoy off for not doing his homework. He listened at the door. He heard everything. He told me something about when he was a kid so we were even.”
An uncomfortable silence hung over them until Draco looked into Harry’s eyes and stated, “I’m sorry. Please don’t let this get in the way-” Harry didn’t let him finished and crashed his lips against the blonde’s.
Draco gave an exasperated look, “Oh no. You have way too much information about me either way. Umm… Truth, I guess. I’m pretty sure I know what you are going to say, and this will be less harmful.”
“Most of these are just from scratches compared to others, but the words on the back of my hand were Umbridge’s doing. This big one on my chest was from a locket that turned out to be a Horcrux. Then there is the one on my forehead, everybody knows the story of that one, I- I don’t really have any other major ones, but I do have a lot more.” Harry shifted, hiding the scars on his hand.
Smiling, Harry said, “Yeah. I’ll talk to McGonagall and make sure it’s ok, but I don’t see why it wouldn’t. Bye!”
Draco was leading Harry through the hallways, and the brunette soon realized where they were heading. Draco let go of his boyfriend’s hand, pacing in front of the stretch of wall. When the door appeared, Draco opened it. It was the Room of Requirement. The room of lost things. The come and go room.
Hermoine rolled her eyes and said that yes, she will come and that she wonders what the other two would do without her.
I hope you enjoyed! I’m working on the next chapter, and I’m pretty exited about it! Thanks for reading!
“Why are you two boys up!” a voice came from behind them. As they both turned and groaned, Hermione sat down next to them on the sofa. Glancing at each other, they both started talking at once. “Harry couldn’t sleep-“ “I had a nightmare-“ Rolling her eyes Hermione said, “Harry, you first, it sounds like you started this.”
Harry made eye contact with the blonde and said, “One of the things I like about you is that you changed. Not that I like your past, but not everybody can change like that.”
Hermione was the one that answered. “Well, you could, but it’s effects take too long to wear off, and using it often can have negative side effects and could cause dependency.”
Harry was stunned, and a wave of nervousness swept through him. “Yeah?” He said again. Draco took a deep breath and sighed before continuing.
Gregor said, “Hey, it’s ok. I know that was probably hard to say, but this room is a safe space, it’s ok if you cry. It’s ok if you yell, this is a place for you to get everything out. There is never any judgment in this room. Got it?”
Ron sputtered and was quick to defend himself, saying, “The locket was enchanted. Whoever was wearing it was always in a bad mood. Anyways, did anybody know that Harry has an invisibility cloak?” Harry stared at his longest friend. He had not expected this piece of information to be revealed.
They reached their first class, potions, and everyone sat down. Slughorn then started class, “Today we are going to be starting our liquid luck potions. Everybody, please pair up.” Mostly the couples were together, minus Ron and Hermionie, but everyone else was just with their friends, and he ended up with Draco.
It was Friday evening, and they were getting ready to play Never have I Ever. Everyone sat in a big semi-circle in front of the fire. The couples were all sitting next to each other, and everyone else filled in the gaps. There were a couple of bottles of fire whiskey scattered around the circle.
Harry saw that Ron and Hermione were both sitting in one of the many sofas found in the common room, along with a few other students who he didn’t know. He walked over to his friends and said that he needed to talk to them tomorrow after classes near the lake.
As everyone got prepared for bed and drifted off, Harry thought of all the things he had learned tonight. He hadn’t realized how many people were bent, or how many people had gotten together. And... Parkinson and Luna could actually become a thing... Wouldn’t that be something?
“I don’t know. I-I think it’s going to be awhile. I know that he’s changed, and I’m trying, but… I’m not sure that I’ll ever be completely ok with him. I am really trying.”
So. Draco had a crush on him. His mind caught back up, and he locked eyes with Draco. He noticed that Draco wasn’t saying anything and was just staring and Harry gestured for Draco to follow him and walked out of the room. He headed to his room and waited for Draco to enter.
Just then, Fred and George stood up on the other end of the table and yelled, Fred first. “Angelina Johnson, I like you! Do you wanna go out with me?” Following quick in succession, George yelled, “Katie Bell, I like you! Do you wanna go out with me?” Jumping down from the table, they headed over to their respective girls, presumably to talk to them.
Harry shifted so he was sitting cross-legged facing his only friends. Taking a deep breath, he started talking. “I grew up with muggles. My aunt and uncle, they don’t like me, never have. I grew up not knowing I was a wizard.”
They stood in front of the cage and stared at the creature. It was about a meter long and looked like a scorpion, but with bird wings, and feet. The blue eyes were staring at them, and the stinger was a pinkish color.
“I love you, Harry, truly. I hope you know that.” Draco said, his voice overflowing with the affections he held for the brunette.
Parkinson nodded and said, “New rule. Whatever is revealed in this room, stay in the room got it?” looking at everyone with a slight glare.
He then stepped into the fire and with a final wave goodbye, was whooshed away by the flames. The next thing he knew, he was already back in the common room, being spitted out by the fireplace.
Taking a deep breath, he responded, “Yes. I kinda told Ron about this before, but apparently, I have had panic attacks.”  He shuddered. “I freak out about things, for example, small spaces, cupboards, and thunderstorms. I want you two to be able to help me avoid those things, so I don’t get triggered, along with being able to help me get through them.”
When she reached the steps she saw the boys on their way back to the castle. She stood there, waiting for them. Harry still had silent tears running down his face.
As Harry pulled out his book, Draco set up their cauldron. “I’ll go get the ingredients,” Harry said. He then went to the small supply cupboard. As he reached out for the ingredients, a boggart suddenly appeared. The shapeless creature started to swirl and shift to his greatest nightmare. But before the creature could take shape, he quickly yelled out “Riddikulus!”
He was taken aback. This was not what he had been expecting. Draco-had wanted to be friends? Why had he always been so mean to him? He decided that the past should be left in the past and to be friends with Draco.
All he had to do was keep Harry away from the snitch, and catch it if he could. He chanced a glance towards Harry and saw that he was quickly being overtaken, and was falling behind again. He pushed forward with all he had, but it wasn't quite enough. As they reached the spot where they had seen the flash of gold, they spun, neither spotting the golded winged sphere that they were seeking.
She stood up saying, “Ron, give him a hug. I’m going to go talk to her.” She turned and rushed up to the castle. As she ran up the stairs to the professors office the thought about what to say. She never spoke without thinking it through.
The three all said goodbye and whooshed back to Hogwarts. For now, the three were happy and carefree; in the future, that might change.
Looking a bit nervous, Malfoy said, “Because to the public we are. Together I mean,” Malfoy glanced at Pansy, who gave a tiny nod. “We both knew for a long time, second-year I’d reckon that we were bent. We both grew up in pureblood families where it was unacceptable. We never really came out; there wasn’t really a point. We are former death eaters; no one wants to date us. So, we just continued the charade to please both our families. It’s not like there's anything we can do anyway.”
Harry chewed on his lip before saying, “I guess for now we can try to keep it at Hogwarts. I don’t think it would be good if the Prophet found out that I was in a gay relationship. I personally don't care, but I’ve also had that amount of publicity for years.”
Draco sighed and realized that they were avoiding it. His mind was racing with thoughts, but all that would come out of his mouth was, “Ok.” If Harry was brave enough to confront his demons, surely he can too.
Harry silently thanked his boyfriend then spoke up, “What can I do to cheer you up again?” Hermione sighed again. “I don’t know. I wonder if he even still wants to be friends.”
Looking mortified, Hermione said, “Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry!” Ron piped up, saying, “Yeah, we’re so sorry mate. I wish we would have waited for you, then Malfoy couldn’t have listened.” Sighing Harry said, “No, it’s ok. Nothing can be done about it now.”
Harry sighed. “I know, but… I want him to see that people change. I do think he knows that even if he doesn't realize it and I think he and Hermoine are going to split up very soon. ”
They reached the lake, and Hermione laid down a blanket for them to sit on. That all sat down and just sat in silence for a moment. It was a comfortable kind of silence, not an awkward silence.
Pansy let out a squeal, and said, “We need to play that sometime… Maybe if there is a time when fewer of us are couples…”
“I… I’m not sure. Turns out, during a war, you don’t have a lot of time to experiment.” Harry said with a cheeky smile.
Draco sighed with a slight smile. “More people than you think have panic attacks after the war, I’ve seen almost everyone in eighth year have one. I’ve also had them as long as I can remember.”
"And you're an arsehole. Like you said, the biggest arse ever." Patting Draco on he back when he started to grumble about being insulted, Harry was aware that his anger had subsided. He shook his head quietly, resigned to the fact that he was too easily manipulated by Draco. Watching Draco cry made his heart ache and Draco would probably always have that in his arsenal.
“Getting more books,” he said quietly, long familiar with the way Hermione waved him away without looking up. Walking towards the stacks, he checked to make sure the coast was clear before pulling out the message box from his fifth cousin once removed in China.
"Potter," she greeted evenly when the trio neared. "Weasley, Granger. I do hope that they'll get better when school starts." She gestured at the awestruck audience coolly. Draco squeezed her arm in comfort, acknowledging her ploy in redeeming their image. She had likewise penned a letter to Potter apologizing for suggesting the school to offer him up. In a response befitting of The Chosen One, Potter had replied that he hardly remembered the incident, and that they had all been frightened children. Pansy had broken down in relief then.
"No," Harry mumbled, wondering if he should vanish the gift entirely. Malfoy would murder him, but it would be worth forgoing the humiliation of sharing what he had gotten.
"Potter, you can sacrifice your life just to reach the Arc, but it wouldn't do to bring me along." He finally grinned as he smoothed the French linen of his shirt.
All sense left Harry as Malfoy's agitated refrain suddenly sounded like an command—and any commands from Malfoy had to be challenged. "I shan't! I
Harry nodded as he gaped at the change. The shops had got louder—if it was even possible, and the shopfront for the Weasley’s Wizarding Wonders had tripled in size. A rival line of phones from across the pond had set up opposite them.
"Mate, it's the Diggory business from third year," Weasley explained, leaning in slightly as settled his hand on his girlfriend's thigh.
The rest of the evening passed in a blur for Draco. Seated beside Granger and opposite Potter who had indeed ended up in Hufflepuff, Draco was reticent, entirely occupied by his thoughts. He spent the meal completely missing Blaise who was trying to catch his eye from the Slytherin table where he sat beside Weasley.
Enclosed is a book on the Gods of Love in different cultures worldwide. Even though we are disciples of the same master, our manuals and tools are contextualized according to our branches. You can guess the tools of the trade of our family across the cultures. I hope that it will be an interesting read for you.
"Hermione asked if you had a red to go along with the lasagna from Molly," Harry said, leaning against the door of the dressing room.

"Erm," Harry began guiltily. He had subscribed to the medical research journal that Malfoy often published his papers in since Hermione had mentioned it in passing years ago, and he would always skim the content page of the quarterly publication before tossing it out when it didn't have anything from Malfoy. He had the exact journals that Narcissa had on her shelves, and would often travel with one of the four copies as a sleeping aid. "Maybe?" He said sheepishly.

Harry looked at Malfoy uneasily, distinctly wrong-footed. Was he supposed to laugh?  Did they make jokes about their younger selves? Where had Malfoy disappeared to all these years? Why did he have to visit Greg?
Greg looked disbelievingly at him, cakes suspended in mid-air. “You’ve been obsessed with Draco your whole life?”
“It’s a good idea,” he defended with a laugh. “It’s hard to buy presents for so many people. I have the Weasleys—” he mimed losing count on his fingers in amusement, “Hermione and Ron, you...”
Draco's cheeks flushed in obvious pleasure, his eyes bright from the reminder as the sharp line of his shoulders loosened. It was a title he was incredibly proud of, having won it since his first year. "Don't blah blah blah me," he said, just to be contrary.
Malfoy stared straight at him for a long moment, as if trying to employ Legilimency on him. Harry smiled guilelessly as he repeated his message as loud as possible in his head.
“Erm, none for me, thanks. It’s a big day and I want to-” he waved his hand at his head in general. “Sober and all.”
1. Pretend to not notice, do not treat them differently from other students unless it gets too bad. How bad is too bad? Ask Draco!!!
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him. He cast a suspicious look at Harry's mop of hair before transfiguring the gift wrapper to a mirror. "It's not too bad," he said in surprise, pouting when he noticed the loose strand of hair.
Pansy hummed in agreement as she slipped her arm into his waiting one. They waved goodbye to their friends, and Draco looked heavily at Harry, hoping that he would understand.
Teddy twisted his left foot back and forth as he looked at the floor. "The cookies were calling me," he said quietly. "I don't want pasketti today."
Potter shook his head before looking at his book once more. "I'm thinking of going into magical home refurbishment," he said, his entire body language defensive as he rubbed his finger against the corner of the book. "I don't want to continue chasing bad guys, and I've found that I quite enjoy Charms."
whenever he brought up Malfoy, but it was downright mean whenever they started to shut him up before he could even begin. It had to be said that while Harry was always talking about Malfoy, the regarding topics were a lot more varied than what Hermione  and Ron presented them to be.
"I hope not," Harry shook his head. He levitated it back to Draco. "Can you open it for me? I'd do it myself, but—" he shrugged at the legs on his lap.
Unlike his lover, Draco felt challenged by verbal expressions of affection. His parents had never been particularly demonstrative of their love, instead manifesting it in their indulgence of him. He could interpret his mother's love from the meals she sent him, and he reciprocated through equivalent gestures whenever he saw something she might like.
Draco felt his face heat up at the vulnerable question. Pushing Harry away with a hand on his silly face, he huffed at the laughter he received. "Desist with the mush! Please abide by the established ban, Potter!" He shoved his partner's shoulder when the mocking persisted.
"I'll go. I'm interested," Potter interrupted. "I'm really interested. And happy to be invited. I've never been to a magical zoo before." He raised his brows at Draco with a playful smile. "We might have to work around our schedules though, but wow!"
Harry startled at the address, gaping as he took in the sight of Mrs. Malfoy in a blue Muggle dress at the entryway of the house.
"I'll miss you over the Holidays," Draco said after a while, playing with the hair on the nape of Harry's neck while he looked beyond Harry's shoulder in typical Draco caginess.
"Yours would be more sensible," Draco said with forced casualness, grateful for Harry's effusiveness. He didn't know how Pansy and Theo managed to keep their relationship alive with all the second guessing to save face.
"Well it's definitely not those for sure, but I mean—" Potter looked straight at Draco. "Finch-Fletchley managed to get a proper date with you, which definitely counts as something in my book."
The consideration Malfoy put into his studies could rival Hermione's. Malfoy would pack his bag every night before he turned in, filing his notes and essays before checking his calendar to gather the assignments and textbooks for the next day. Having accustomed to throwing a lightening charm on his schoolbag, Harry would bring all of his textbooks with him. Unlike Malfoy's desk, Harry's comprised of messy stacks of papers he pulled out of his bag whenever it became hard to search for items. He had also sworn to file his notes away a month ago, but to no success.
"Well, firstly there was the chocolate frog card that you were looking for. It seemed too convenient that Harry would get something that made you so excited. Secondly, it was how Harry’s partner knew how to circumvent the gift exchange spells with the annual subscription. I was initially convinced that it was a Slytherin, but none of us–” he smirked at Harry, “care that much about Harry that much. Well except for me,” he corrected when Harry made a noise of protest.
Draco jumped, hurriedly hiding the remaining letters when Harry approached the table with an expression of distaste. "What smell?" he asked.
Harry shook his head adamantly as he shrunk the boxes to a more manageable size. “Seven cakes only. I haven't been obsessed for twenty years,” he said.
"Thanks," he whispered to Malfoy, nudging the apple when Malfoy frowned at him, lips in a twisted sulk.
Catching Pansy's eye, he decided to take a gamble. "I'm going back first," he announced to the tables. "It's been a long day," he explained, nodding at Hermione when she stopped nuzzling Weasley, who was apparently an affectionate drunk.
It was a goal much too lofty in Draco's opinion. Firstly, it was simply impossible to remember seven other people's resolutions, and secondly, they would all be too polite to point out each others’ failures. Lastly, her boyfriend hadn't even thought about the entire activity, which in his opinion,
Draco Malfoy reminds us why he is our darling and the Saviour of Wizarding fashion. Returning with bold choices, his custom suit from Winthralls is reminiscent of the metallic purple suit he wore to the Selwyn's Fundraiser last year. Never a dull showing, he looks like walking sex, and he knows it.
"Going for a jog?" Draco asked, as casually as he would about a patient's well-being. He hummed pleasantly as Potter replied with a confused throaty noise that made him sound like a cornered crup.
Malfoy’s bottom lip was white from how hard he was biting it. “Yes, I—” he ran his fingers through his hair, his mind obviously elsewhere. “I just—six years is a lot,” he said disbelievingly, flushing when Harry only returned an unimpressed look. “I didn’t mean it, I’m sorry. It’s just—” he pressed the back of his palm against his mouth as he breathed in deeply.
"I'll write to you," he told Greg as they gave each other a quick one armed hug. "Pansy," he nodded, the air between them heavy with unsaid words. Just as he made to leave with his coat on, Pansy pulled him in for a hug. "Tread carefully but take the chance when it arises," she whispered before pulling back. He mulled over her words as he pecked her on the cheek.
"Can someone please give me some context? What's with the consent speech. Likewise without consent?" Potter asked to three incredulous looks.
"No," Draco disagreed as he widened the space between Harry's thumb and index finger. "You're Harry Potter. You can't be a teeny tiny WEEP."
"I had to sneak letters to Hermione to get that for you because you were always around! You were trying to catch me getting things for you, weren't you?" Harry accused when he finally made the connection. He clenched his fists when Draco only bit his lips guiltily. He was vibrating out of his skin in anger, and his palms were hurting from the sharp press of his nails.
"No," Malfoy replied primly, tucking his fringe behind his ear as he settled back down to continue with his book.
Draco idly thought that their confrontation could have been better conducted in a warmer environment. "
No job offer would arrive, and couldn’t it be a homemade diner devoid of terms? It could be a date, and Harry would cook while Draco would bring a suitable bottle of wine or make some dessert…
Harry sighed with faux helplessness, "I thought that I was going to be the violent one on this date, but it seems like you're stealing my only role."
"Malfoy, no. Wait," he pleaded. He held onto Malfoy's bony wrist only to be flung off violently as Malfoy continued to pack. The both of them paused when the door to the dungeon opened. Harry felt his heart speed up at the sight of the Slytherins.
to be a reality, surely that was too much? But the arrows were humming against his skin, eager to please, desperate to be used.
"Seamus has a ton of these that he leaves lying around. I used to lift some from him," Harry said as he flipped open to a random page, pausing at the picture of a man nosing at the length of a thick flaccid cock hungrily, his eyes fluttering as if intoxicated by his submission. Lifting the length on his face, he slides the cock into his mouth, lavishing in the weight of it on his tongue before replaying immediately. The both of them were entranced.
"If this is one of your games, this isn't the time," he said while Hermione tried to hold him back. She quickly cast a Muffliato around them as she dispersed the crowd around them.
of the arrow to ask Harry on a date. Harry grinned at him conspiratorially as the suggestion sunk in, and the thrill and pleasure that coursed through him almost made Draco stagger. The stretch of his skin eased by a fraction, and Draco was immensely grateful despite how slight it was. It was impossible to trick the magic on him when they both knew that it didn’t count as a date.
Harry scribbled onto a piece of torn parchment, folding it into approximate quarters before sending it across the Great Hall towards Malfoy.
A variety of sarcastic comments ran through Draco's mind at Harry's assurance. He blinked when he noticed Harry looking at him for confirmation.
Between wrapping the present with Hermione, plotting to become Malfoy's Potions partner, wondering when he could request for his Potions coaching and waiting for Malfoy's return, Harry had spent the entire day thinking about his roommate. He was disappointed when Malfoy only shrugged as he hung up his robes.
“I’m not—” Harry exhaled heavily, “I just want to talk about it. It’s hard to talk back and forth over email, or get you to talk to me at all. You’d either fob me off to some intern or avoid me.” He felt vindicated by the flash of guilt on Malfoy’s face.
factor to the pastime. "There's only so much gardening and shopping a person can do before they become batty," Narcissa confided.
Draco frowned at the patient who wisely rolled his sleeve back down. "Teddy, isn't that too big for you?" He asked as waved the forms off to their respective departments, shaking his head at the mark that Teddy had replicated on his arm. Andromeda would eviscerate him if it stayed. "How about something smaller like Harry's?" He suggested as he brushed Teddy's fringe back to rub at where Potter's infamous scar sat.
Harry clapped loudly at the end of the announcements, pushing Ron away when his friend wiggled his brows insufferably at him. He really shouldn't have told his friends why he was late.
Thecentral figure of their religion had, like Merlin, conducted great feats for the commoners, inspiring admiration. Which secretly reminded him of Potter – like Jesus, Potter had sacrificed himself for the students of Hogwarts, and had been reborn. When Draco had mentioned the parallels to Pansy, he had been pinched so hard that it had left a bruise on his thigh. Had he none of his friends, Draco would have become one of his Potter's followers. It was unthinkable.
"Can you help me to get my handkerchief," Draco asked as he started to tear up again. Quickly summoning one from upstairs, he dabbed at Draco's tears. Draco waved him away, staring at the ceiling wiping his eyes intermittently as he sniffled softly.
"I see, have a great work out, Potter," Draco said mildly with a cordial nod as he began to leave. If there was a little more sway in his hips, it would only have been a coincidence.
"Yes well, the day has been quite pleasant," he looked to Potter for confirmation, smirking at the nod he received. "Therefore, I would like to invite you to the annual Black family vacation. We're bringing Teddy to Paris to visit Le Zoo Magique, the leading educational and cruelty-free magical zoo." Draco experienced a mild panic at the frown on Potter's blank face. "You are under no obligation to accept my invitation. I merely extended it on the assumption that you might not have visited it, and would be interested in doing so. Also, young Theodore has expressed great—"
Teddy hummed before pushing the plate on the counter towards them. "Cookies?" He looked at them guilelessly.
Draco felt his heart calm as he processed the information. Nobody else knew about Severus’ spell; he would be fine.
Harry lifted himself off the doorframe to stand before him. “Let me,” he said, his voice rough as he placed his hands over Draco’s. Draco barely registered the callouses on Harry’s hands—his heart starting to rabbit at a frenzied pace, his legs weak from the developments. He dropped his hands.
Draco narrowed his eyes at her as he set the book down. He tried to convey that she shouldn't mess around with the Golden Trio, frustrated when Pansy only tilted her head as she continued to smile lazily at him.
A day after the disastrous event with Potter, Draco had approached Pansy for help to throw Potter's scent off. He had sat through the requisite "We've been telling you this from the beginning!", the "This obsession is getting ridiculous, you need to get over Potter" and the worst, the "Draco you need to stop running away from your feelings, we are all worried for you" spiel before receiving the advice that he needed.
"Anyway, shouldn't the both of you be on first names already?" Hermione asked when the laughter subsided.
Harry froze at the door of the hospital wing when five pairs of eyes turned towards him the moment he stepped in. Pansy was in Malfoy's bed, an arm around his shoulder.
Pansy shrugged coolly. "Nothing. I was just passing by when I saw Granger by her lonesome. I was keeping her company until you returned."
“Well, why should I ask for a second date when the first isn’t good? If you want me to ask for a second date, you’d better make sure that everything goes well," he titled his head as he looked at Harry challengingly.
Harry looked strangely bashful as he considered the offer. “Okay. Just that one. And The Quibbler if you have it?”
"I'll sometimes regress and I'll think about how funny it would be to trip you up, and I don't think about how you'll feel. I'm an arse," Draco repeated when Harry glared at him with all the spite he could muster.
"Fine," Draco said. His friends cheered. Ron slapped him on the back while Harry blinked at him in disbelief. "I'll do it, but you'll have to sign up for Bainbridge & Daughters. Secondly, I will also have access to your nasty letters and serve them cease and desist orders. Thirdly, any other excursions will be according to my schedule. I will also be remunerated for my headache."
The judgement in Harry's face evaporated immediately as it was replaced with what Draco had always feared—horror. He swiped at his stubborn tears furiously as he pushed Harry's hand away.
Draco shook his head in disapproval. "Teddy takes after you," he said as he walked out of the kitchen.
"Erm, so I was a little concerned about how you were doing, and they wanted me to talk to you, but I didn't know how to start, so they rigged it. So that I could do something for you. But I didn't know! I was confused when it happened!" He defended as he raised his both hands reflexively in innocence.
. And he was still fine yesterday morning," he insisted with a smile that reached his eyes. In this dire period, their conversation was conducted with pureblood subterfuge. With their periodic full bodied laughter and casual smiles, no one would have realised that they were in fact strategising.
Draco shoved at him for the jibe. "I had to confirm my suspicions! You were so good at acting, I had to test you just to be sure. I mean,
of his bloodline weighing him down on each shoulder. He had been so deep in thoughts of self-pity and loathing that morning, flinching and curling into himself when Harry had touched him. Draco’s expression must have been frightful when he whirled around, Harry’s face immediately shuttering, leaving him alone, and now he had nobody to talk to.
“Well, I see where you’re coming from with the campaign, but—” he broke off as he watched Malfoy eye the rest of the cakes in the box wistfully as if considering whether to have another. “Do you want to go for lunch? We can talk over lunch. I’ll buy.”
Draco had begun exploring Muggle religions to ensure that he could provide the emotional support the patients' parents might need. It was an interesting branch of knowledge to him. He now understood why some of the Muggleborns his year had called out to God in exclamation.
“Yeah,” Draco nodded as he shoved his hands in his pockets. “Shall we shower first? We could open them before we turn in.”
"Yes, there were. I like rules so I would have set them up," Malfoy said, swiping his fringe backwards huffily before crossing his arms in a sulk.
Apparating across the field, he blinked when the wards embraced him. The magic was old, warm and familiar, but the frequency was nothing that he had come across recently. Harry stood still at the porch leading to the house, resisting the urge to push his magic into the core of the property that was calling to him like his own home.
Draco nodded, pushing his damp fringe backwards as he dabbed the beads of sweat at his hairline. "I finally got some pink pearls," he explained, decanting a serving to a vial. The last few trials with Harry had been short of disappointments, and his looks had not been enhanced at all.
"Look, I think that you should sleep. You drank quite a bit today–" he held up a hand when Harry tried to protest, "–we'll talk tomorrow, alright?" He searched Harry's eyes for his response, nodding in satisfaction at what he apparently saw.
"Erm," Potter's index finger darted between Draco and the door belonging to Draco's Muggle one night stand before scratching his sideburns where a short curl had escaped his messy topknot. Potter continued to gape uselessly at him.
The hall quieted when the Headmistress took her position at the podium. She straightened her notes before beginning in a stately manner, “Hogwarts, has always prided itself on its diversity, embracing and nurturing the best in its students. However, in the midst of competition, we have forgotten what we are capable of when we come together–a school, generations of inquisitive students, a better future for our friends and families.”
Draco broke his fourth rule as he wondered about a nude Harry Potter. It would probably be equally delightful if not more so, he speculated. Draco sighed to himself as Hester floated their cakes to them for tea. He was now getting maudlin and inappropriate. Thanking Merlin for Pansy's absence as he helped himself to the cake, he blinked at the refreshing flavour.
"I'll need a life-saving boyfriend like you in future," he joked, making a sharp noise in his throat when he saw his present.
“Yeah—Draco!” Teddy exclaimed, running over when he noticed his second cousin in the shop. Harry’s head swivelled around from his inspection of the menu. Indeed there Malfoy was, his hair as shiny as it was in his display picture in
"Stop with that crawling thing," Potter groaned. "Just a few days ago I was wondering if I’m going to wear out the knees of my trousers. Me, thinking about this rubbish!" Potter pinched the bridge of his nose as he sighed. "But it's actually nice though, I think. It's nice being a Hufflepuff."
Draco had returned from Training and Assessment at GOSH to find Sneezy excitedly hopping about with a Hogwarts letter in hand.
. anyhow, I also resolve to play more with young Teddy throughout the year, and lastly, to expand my social circle." He continued resolutely, ignoring the anger expressed against the injustice on his behalf.
"Granger's horribly indecisive, did you know? It took her close to an hour to choose one present, and Weasley's a complete pushover, standing around even while complaining. Bloody Gryffindors, honestly. They're both so enthusiastic that it's almost pitiful."
The war had taught him many things, of which that his inheritance was never infallible. He would not make the same mistake twice and ruin the friendship that he had come to treasure. Resolving to do the least to satisfy the compulsion of the arrow, processed the words on his tongue carefully before he spoke. “Anything’s good. You can cook your favourite dishes too.”
Draco's eyes bulged at the second revelation of the night. Harry was revealing everything tonight, and Draco was wrong-footed. He had never mentioned his side project to Harry.
Harry felt himself flush. He had referenced the train incident in sixth year where Malfoy had stepped on his face in the note. Did Malfoy's comment imply that he appreciated the humour?
Something in Draco's voice–possibly the smugness–triggered Ron's attention. His hand froze in mid-air as he turned to look at Draco. Setting his spoon down carefully, he narrowed his eyes at Draco, then Harry. "Does he know?” He hissed at Harry.
“I got a paper cut yesterday,” Malfoy said, his eyes bright with amusement as he handed the extra fork to his friend.
His body had also betrayed him, bursting into shivers whenever Harry touched him. It was as if he could never escape his past, the
"That's rich coming from you. You guys are practically plastered together," Ginny waved at the both of them.
Draco pet the arm around him, his heart tender. Harry perked up when Ginevra finally returned her attention to Luna. Taking the opportunity, he reached over to dust the snow off Harry’s messy hair, the disappointment at the continued influence of the arrow immediately dissipating when he took in Harry’s bright eyes and wide smile, cheeks flushed from the cold. The sight of Harry's happiness still made his heart lift.
"Badly," Malfoy replied with an eye roll. "Pansy’s bent on maximum debauchery, and all I want to do is sleep," he sighed as he squeezed Harry's consoling hand on his knee.
"Harry has been looking down since Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood got together. We just wanted to comfort him," her companion said quietly.
"I could beg," Harry said as he pulled his dark green sweatshirt off, making an annoyed noise when his shirt refused to stay down. "What," he asked when he noticed Malfoy staring. He rearranged his crooked spectacles.
Draco now lived life on a day-to-day basis with nobody to satisfy. The freedom was immense, and he squandered it lavishly, better understanding the field of psychology, and Muggles.
Harry flushed as he looked at Malfoy's friends surreptitiously in embarrassment. "Well, I mean-" he tried to explain. "You don't have to open them with me, I don't mind just seeing them afterwards," he hissed desperately when Zabini, Nott and Goyle started to snicker.
"Aren't you familiar with our schedule? What are the chances of Draco Malfoy being an Archer?" Potter mused as he stared him down, mischief in his eyes. "I remember your fervent support of the Tornadoes."
"Wait. Here's good," Draco announced when the distance seemed close to what his mother typically preferred when they visited. Looking around, he reached into his blazer with a Muggle coin in hand while subtly transfiguring it into a picnic mat. Pretending to pull it out of his garment, Draco tried his best to ignore how close Potter was standing.
"I'm sorry for being late!" Harry apologised brightly as he unshrunk the Prophet that he had purchased in the morning. "Is that my pen that you're sucking," he exclaimed.
Draco stared at him incredulously, lips twitching from the force of controlling his laughter. He compensated by making a show of focusing on his mille crêpe.
"Harry?" Draco called out as he tread towards his walk-in wardrobe carefully, wand in hand. He made a curious noise at the sight of Potter surrounded by what seemed to be the contents of an entire wardrobe, levitated.
Similarly, it was easy to see why there was a discrimination against the Hufflepuffs when accessing the common room necessitated crawling. It was inconceivable that one would be required to grovel multiple times a day in school, and with prolonged exposure, he wrote, it would have negative consequences on a person's psyche.
Hermione Granger, Junior Officer, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has proposed a law to improve privacy for individuals. Individuals and corporations whose actions have inconvenienced others can be fined up to five thousand galleons and/or be sent to Azkaban for three years. Harry Potter welcomed the proposal.
"Teddy, Draco's house is really big. We can spread out just a little. Maybe I can go here?" He pointed to the branch by the side.
“Of course. Nobody compares,” Harry said sincerely. There was a literal lemon lookalike atop a tart, complete with the bumpy texture, and on another, a fresh flower was surrounded by berries. Goyle’s creations were a work of art, and Harry’s mouth was already watering at the sight of the selection.
Draco shook himself off as he tore the present open clumsily. He blinked at the note in surprise. "Harry, look! Let's go ice-skating!" He ran over to jostle him when he failed to get the attention that he desired.
Draco rolled his eyes in fond annoyance, his heart warm from the return of their familiar camaraderie. "He wasn't
"No," Harry blurted as with a sharp shake of his head. "No, I'm fine," he repeated, looking strangely frightened as Draco frowned at him in scrutiny.
"Test me? What do you mean?" Harry's brows creased as he stared at Draco. As he ran through Draco's comments from the past few days, he finally understood.
," Malfoy said in awe as he pulled the publication out of the wrapper. He fell onto Harry's bed almost distractedly, eyes following the trail of water running down the cover model's sculpted chest. The black haired model ran his tongue over his bottom lip as he brushed his left nipple. Malfoy's hand was trembling as he flipped it open. "Oh," he said breathlessly at the picture of two men kissing hungrily on a bed.
“That’s a nice problem to have,” he said, and it was, regardless of the anxiety and the planning that had begun in November as he watched his peers catalog their hobbies and personalities.
"It's okay, it's okay," Harry soothed as he wrapped an arm around Draco's neck, while the other pet Draco's head comfortingly.
Draco exhaled in amusement. "Wouldn't it be a shame if you didn't come up top in the revised Documentation, Forms, and Filing course?"
"You can't control that, mate. Focusing on it only makes you feel guiltier. You need to think about how you wanted to make him happy and how that feedback was essential. Do you already have your last gift?" He raised his eyebrows at the negative. "Better make it good then. Get something properly convincing to show that you know him better, you know? That it was worth it and all."
"Potions genius and more," Nott remarked quietly. Harry felt his cheeks flush as Malfoy's hand jerked while flipping his textbook.
Draco watched as Potter chewed on the corner of his bottom lip. Frankly, the short intervals between the occasions of close contact with Potter was alarming. Given the size of the English magical community and his cordial relationship with Hermione (Draco would even count her as a friend if he had adequate alcohol content in his bloodstream) it was obviously impractical to avoid Potter entirely, but the previous normal of once every quarter had somehow been upended since his last one night stand in February.
“Of course not! You’ll need to fill it first,” Teddy said with a roll of his eyes as he lifted it to eye level. “Everyone would be so jealous,” he said to himself.
Harry offered a nod when Malfoy seemed expectant. He didn't want to start blabbering about his bad decisions to another Malfoy. "Erm, I'm worried that I won't like the job."
"Draco, do you have a wine—" Harry said as he stepped out of the Floo without invitation. "Merlin, what's that smell?"
Anyway, those events are a logistical nightmare and they're probably desperate to have you, thus the early invitations. You don't have to go for everything, you can send them a nominal amount or donate something for auction if they're fundraisers. But some are not too bad, especially when the food and drinks are good. Always bring a friend who can pull you away from sticky situations.
“No, no! We look at it separately!” Harry explained, groaning when he realised that the clarification had not been helpful at all.
Draco smiled at Potter's enthusiasm, raising a brow when the man fumbled, pausing with palpable hesitation. "I guess that it's sort of like this? Chinese food and the Blacks, sort of." Potter shrugged, his shoulders caving in as he bit his lips.
Draco felt his face flame from Potter's unflinching honesty. They were both fully clothed, hands above each other's clothes, but Draco had never experienced such deep intimacy with any of his other lovers—inclusive of the Muggle he had seen throughout the first year of Healer school. He pressed his face into Potter's chest in embarrassment, unable to fathom how he had ended up in Potter's arms, yet too timid to question it in case it disappeared before his eyes.
"Fine. I'll know about it soon anyway." He waved for Draco to continue packing. "Save some of that sixth year sentiments for later, will you? Hate sex would be fun."
"Why did you do that!" he complained, swiping at his cheek and howling when the red of Pansy's lipstick showed on his grey glove.
"I'll write tonight if I have the time to. Tell Pansy whatever," Draco said with a wry smile as he flicked a privacy spell in the couple's direction before heading for the train. Nobody else needed to watch Pansy and Blaise rutting against each other like dogs in heat.
Harry’s eyes darted about shiftily. “Of course not,” he scoffed. “I didn’t mean that. I thought you were referring to the thirty cakes, not the six on the side.” He felt cornered and desperate, “I mean, I wasn't around for seventh year, but I thought about Malfoy even when we were, you know, running, erm for our lives and all, so I thought that it would be seven, not six, and thirty one, not thirty because we're thirty one years old.” He was quickly losing control of his mouth. There was surely no need for such clarifications, but it was always like this with Greg.
in a low voice. Adamantly keeping his eyes on his book, Draco floated over the lunch Sneezy had prepared for Blaise, together with a stack of the sleazy Muggle romance titles that Blaise had requested, hoping for some peace and quiet for the rest of the ride.
"I'm not," he corrected without thinking, as Potter raised a brow in challenge before dropping his eyes to Draco's tie. The yellow tie had been beside his green one this morning, together with a piece of yarn, indicating that Sneezy and Worry had came by. "Well, I'm here for Blaise," Draco said, waving at this friend who was now smirking beside him, blatantly reading his private letter to Pansy.
"Are you all returning to Hogwarts?" Potter asked, gesturing at the Slytherins before returning to look at Draco.
“Yes, show me, Harry,” Draco said in amusement, his smile strangely showing no malice. Had they progressed onto first names? Weren’t they supposed to be professional at work?
It was unlike any kiss that either of them had had, the bone-deep rush of magic rushing through their bodies as if released from a dam where it had been waiting so long for. Harry felt the recognition of their soulbond in his magical core, the magic desperate and hungry to bond with Draco. He moaned, rutting into Draco when Draco cupped his face, the pad of his thumb pressing into his mark. Draco's lips were soft and gentle even while his tongue was hungry and feverish.
Draco had gone white from the responsibility thrust upon him. Upset, he had confronted the Headmistress to relinquish the title after their dismissal. He was not blind to the lack of confidence the student body had in him, nor unaware of the atrocities he had endorsed in his seventh year. To entrust him the role was simply unthinkable.
"No way!" Harry exclaimed as he tried his best to not fall onto Ron. Inebriated, Malfoy was not only chatty and more dramatic, but also terribly floppy.
"Fuck off, Potter," Malfoy replied without looking up as his quill continued to move across his parchment.
The sudden resurgence of the Malfoy who gave it as good as he got was overwhelming for Harry. Malfoy's shoulders were tight, his mouth twisted, and he seemed ready to leap at him for a fight. Harry hadn't realised how much he had missed this side of Malfoy. The tired, mousy demeanour disturbed him.
book, didn't I? After stripping the glamours, I had you tap your wand on it while unconscious. You didn't expect people to search for it, and it's nothing particularly incriminating, so the security isn't that high." He thumbed his nose proudly like the top student in Documents, Forms, and Filing that he was.
Draco pulled back to slap his significant other on the chest. "It's for charity," he repeated. "Also, everyone was getting one. As a Malfoy, I needed to outdo everyone," he said haughtily, bursting into laughter with his lover.
"That's a secret," Malfoy said as he laced his fingers around Harry's. "But she's bent on knocking the Puffs off their pegs."
Draco was disappointed by the lack of sympathy he received. Blaise had advised him to apologise, if not to maintain the advantageous connection he had with Harry Potter.
Reaching for the Muggle tissues that he kept on his bedside table, Harry dabbed at the tears gently while Draco curled up on his bed. Vanishing the snot away as he cleaned Draco’s face, he squeezed Draco’s hands in consolation.
," he shook his head in amazement, pausing when he noticed Harry staring at him. "Aren't you going to eat your dessert?"
"There's um, a full frontal for November in this edition." Harry said as he gestured Draco towards him. Draco moved slowly towards the other man, head ringing from the dissonance of standing at the spot where he used to wank, with the object of his fantasy.
The letter was short. He read it twice over before focusing on the reason of their rejection. What did "lacking in its conclusion" mean? Which essay lacked in its conclusion? Had his application not been strong enough? He had submitted his year's worth of Thought evaluation, and the three newly created Potions where he had worked to influence the mental process of its drinker, or of the people around them. He had scored through libraries of research on Brain, Thought and Love, weaved in Muggle philosophy and scientific research for a holistic review. How could it not be enough?
Buoyant as he returned to the common room, he stopped short at the stench and the sight of a girl drenched in vinegar. Draco sighed to himself as he walked up to them. The Hufflepuff common room password was infamously simple, yet it was shameful how it seemed to be too difficult for
, and Harry felt like he had missed something, as usual. He stepped towards Malfoy's bed when he heard a noise of confusion.
“Oh, look! Blaise is calling me. Goodbye!” Ron announced, picking up his plate as he scampered away immediately to avoid Harry's ire.
Harry couldn't tear his eyes away from the flush on Malfoy's high cheekbones. His eyes were hesitant yet sharp and steady, as if he was cataloguing every detail in the pictures before him. Harry understood what Malfoy was experiencing; he had found Dudley's skin mag over the summer in the second year, and the memory was still branded in his mind–he had been frightened, awashed with uncomfortable arousal while intoxicated with burning curiosity and deviant excitement. It was the forbidden fruit that the pastor had talked about in school, and his palms were sweating, his stomach twisting as his loins clenched. He would fish for the magazine a few more times afterwards, simply for the mere experience of seeing it, of what he knew was wrong and debauched.
"Well, obviously they wouldn't be when you're bloody staring," he said impatiently. "Come on, there's still the café that I got the rainbow cakes from."
"Admiration letters, love potions, wedding proposals and the like. Mine sort of stopped when Hannah and I got together," Nevile shrugged.
Draco smiled to himself as his heart squeezed in the depths of affection he had for the man. He often worried about the future they would have together, but maybe, it would be just like his extra-extra-extra-extra-extra-large calendar—he would take it one month at a time, and always wait excitedly for the next.
Harry looked at the innocuous present lying on his bed once more. It was the last night he was spending with Draco before the winter break, but the present was calling out his name, and he had never been good at managing his impulses.
Following the noise, Draco skidded around the corner, sighing in exasperation when he saw his little cousin. "Teddy! Inside voice!" Draco scolded, his frown quickly smoothing when his cousin barreled into him in excitement. Picking the boy up easily with a sigh, he combed Teddy's platinum blond fringe backwards lightly as he connected the dots for Teddy's presence in the hospital.
Harry couldn’t breathe, his body was buzzing, and his mind was a complete mush. He circled his hands around Draco's waist as he pulled him closer, won't to even be an inch apart. The world fell away as their mouths continued to move against each other.
"Would you really? You've turned into a proper pacifist these days, honestly." Blaise smirked as he ambled in. "Making the world better, reading about prehistoric Potters, staring adoringly at Potter..." he trailed off, wriggling his brows as he settled on the opposite row of seats.
Harry chuckled at the image of an irate Malfoy. "How does he still have the time to be mad about my existence?" Harry sighed as he returned to look at the television.
Draco's brows knotted at his hesitation, lips slightly pursed as he pulled his hand back. Harry leapt across the table to grab his hand and swallow the morsel in a smooth motion.
Harry smoothed his thumb across the paper stuck to his hand, wondering if he could make out the name. Was it a safe draw?
Malfoy sat up sharply. There was a deep frown in his face. "It's a Pureblood and Slytherin thing. Feelings are hard," he said as he held Harry's forearm in a tight grip.
Harry had worn out his friends' empathy half a month into the eighth year of school, and it was bad enough that Hermione and Ron would exchange
Even though they would have a ridiculous number of arguments throughout the span of their lives, Harry would always look back to their first solstice together fondly; and it had all begun with an anonymous gift exchange.
! It's like you're just so desperate to write this year off and disappear after school. You don't even care about us, and it's bloody hurtful!" Potter shouted before snatching his book and storming off towards the dorm.
"Yep," Harry agreed with a wide smile as he tossed two Frogs onto Malfoy's bed, before levitating the rest to his schoolbag. He would give some out tomorrow and open the rest with Ron. Ron had been missing an Elphias Doge card for the longest time.
"Well, we can sit with the Slytherins tomorrow," Hermione said. "Nott did a really good presentation during Arithmancy today," she explained with a raised brow when both of her friends stared at her in shock.
"It's good," Potter said as he pushed his box over, motioning for Draco to try some. Draco looked at the offering, idly noting that Potter had only helped himself to a tiny corner of the cake. Setting his near Potter, Draco bit his lip as he reached for the cake. It was simply calling out his name too loudly for him to resist. He was only mortal after all.
Draco placed a palm on Potter's chest as he pushed him backwards, cursing the urge in his fingers to instead curl around Potter's windbreaker. His head felt dizzy from Potter's musky cologne, and wouldn't it be nice if he could rest for a bit in the curve where Potter's neck met his muscular shoulders? Or on Potter's shapely pectorals, he really wasn't picky. "Malfoys don't throw galleons at lost causes, Potter." Draco said airily as he straightened his sleeves. Alas, the wry humor.
think about constructing one on your own," she said sternly when she noticed Harry inspecting the metal badge of Hogwart's crest in awe.
For the first time, the answer didn't come easily to Draco. Unlike his usual modus operandi, he didn't want to roll off Harry, pick up his clothes, and return to an empty bed. But staying over was a commitment, and he didn't want to be the one who requested. At the same time, he didn't want to be the one left behind, much less by Harry. He pretended to consider as he fiddled with his bottles of cologne.
Draco paused when he felt the burn in his pocket, cursing under his breath as the ink dripped onto his parchment. Waving it away before it spread further, he glanced up to check that he hadn’t disrupted Hermione’s concentration. Homework had been piling up, and with the teachers’ self-guided learning initiative for the eighth years, the number of group projects he had was ridiculous.
Harry pulled Malfoy out of the way of a particularly vicious looking purple jinx, expelling the student's wand before immobilising her. The scuffle was over as quickly as it started.
"You, go sit with Potter so Blaise can't touch you. You, sit on your bloody hands because you're a fucking wanker. Bloody start already before I blackout from this stupidity," she kicked her friends lightly with her foot as she helped herself to Firewhiskey straight from the bottle.
"Are pastels your thing?" He held a bundle of ribbons against Malfoy's head with a frown. He had written to request for a catalogue from the Hogsmeade shop Lavender and Parvati used to talk about all the time, finally understanding the appeal of the establishment when he learnt about the self-tying and anti-loosening charms in their hair accessories.
Draco felt a tear slide down his temple before his vision went black. Finally, an instance where Harry Potter couldn't save him.
"Would you and Narcissa like to come to the Weasley's gathering? It'll be quite a bit, with the kids and all, but Andy and Teddy will be there. I mean, Ron wanted to invite you too, and Mrs Weasley wants you there, but I mean, if you want to, you know?" Potter mumbled, gesturing lazily as he leaned against Draco with his eyes closed.
them. More so than the other years, Harry felt reluctant to leave for the winter break. He desperately wished that Draco and him would still be on talking terms after dinner.
However, the realisation of his lack of qualifications for the application had left Draco in a bout of depression. He was not a team player, empathetic, particularly reliable, exceptionally compassionate, nor excellent in customer service. And to top everything off, he was at a complete lack of credible references to substantiate his character even if he chose to make up an entirely fictitious personality of himself. His godfather had been murdered by a megalomaniac, and he had orchestrated an infiltration of his school.
A conference is typically held every ten years and Handlers are randomly picked to attend. The next would be in 2003. However, the chances of being selected are slim, and it would be easier if you simply made a trip to visit us instead.
Also, it must be said that I no longer relish insulting you. I have matured from our schooldays. Please do not hold my behaviour from our last meeting as a reference of my current character. I lost control of myself and for that, I am deeply ashamed.
Everyone gaped at Malfoy for the specific comparison. He didn't seem to notice though, occupied at picking lint off his pants. "Any other woes from the
“And then it became an antiques shop, before it ended up as a hat shop,” Teddy said as he pulled him along.
"The Snitch somehow seemed to understand that you needed help to beat me, you know?" Harry finished, yelping when Draco swung the broom off his shoulder and started to hit him with it.
Harry tried his best react normally when Malfoy unwrapped the present–a pair of blue socks with cartoon Harry Potter faces over them.
"Yeah, dealing with both Teddy and you at the same time would be awful." Potter nodded grimly as he reached for the basket of bread between them.
"She's soo sexy," Brocklehurst slurred as she wedged herself clumsily beside Padma, "and smart." Padma pressed her face into Brocklehurst's neck in embarrassment when Seamus led a rowdy toast to them.
Harry had given Malfoy two presents in two days, and they had opened them together when he had returned from the infirmary. The Christmas themed pyjamas set had been better received than the
“It’s not about winning,” Harry said, paying no notice to how they were almost atop each other even after Smith had scampered off. Draco bit his lips at how casual Harry was with his Saviour of the Wizarding World status. Even their peers scrambled to give up seats for him. It was ridiculous.
"No, not really," Zabini replied with a wide smile as he leaned backwards in his seat. "We were just talking about how your Patronus woke Pansy up. It's a bit rude to be talking about you in your presence, so we stopped."
"Who else might you want to avoid on a date night," he mumbled as he rubbed his chin. "—been working with the Aurors... shouldn't have any new enemies..."
Malfoy blinked at him. "Alright, that's decent," he scribbled on his book with a flourish before leaning back to review the list. "That's acceptable," he shut the book proudly.
"Mate, here," Ron said as he set an apple before Harry forcefully. "Give this to Malfoy later during Transfiguration."
He held Draco close. “Then I will insist,” he said softly as he pressed a kiss on Draco’s fine hair.
"Yeah," Harry replied quickly as he desperately tried to keep his expressions in check. He stared at Hermione in amazement, amused when she refused to meet his eyes even while she continued supervising the name-drawing.
“The most clichéd place ever,” Draco said, bustling around as he started the fire and headed for the bar trolley in the corner. “One finger?” He offered as he raised a decanter.
Harry scoffed. "Of course not," he said, laughing with Ron as Hermione tutted at them disapprovingly.
Harry's day was ruined by Malfoy's allegations—he was too self-conscious to leave the wall to mingle with his
"Not really. It depends on what's said," Nott corrected. He refilled his cup, staunchly refusing to look up.
"M'kay, love you too. More." Harry said incoherently, his words slurring as he patted Draco's hand lightly. "You're 'dorable," Harry mumbled as he moved his hands away, burrowing deeper into his pillow.
Nonetheless, it was undeniable that Malfoy had been absolute rubbish at being a Death Eater. Despite Lucius' expectations, his villainous skills had never developed beyond insults, pranks, telltales and physical attacks. Likewise, Neville had told him that Malfoy had run interference by sending students to detention with Filch and playing up the humiliation of the tasks to satisfy the Carrows.
Draco's brows met his hairline as he looked at Ginny in disbelief. He was stunned to see similar thoughtful looks around the table. "Blaise, you're the only other Slytherin here. Tell them that it's stupid, please."
Draco opened his mouth to retort before realising that Harry was right. Instead of cruising at Muggle clubs to test the efficacy of his potions, he now had the offer of a willing participant. He grinned at Harry, relishing at his nervousness.
Please find enclosed a draft of the contract from my lawyer. A draft has been similarly shared with Bainbridge & Daughters.
"So you're probably going to get your second present today," Malfoy said suddenly as they made their way through the largely empty corridors.
"You forgot your duties regarding the party," Harry stated as he fed Malfoy another bite. "You have a meeting at Zabini and Goyle's at ten thirty."
“Your opinions are invalid, that’s what it is. I told you! I told you to take care of yourself, but you’re out there, opening the mails happily, and that Bubotuber pus!” He pressed his hands against his face, fingers under his spectacles as he trembled. “I should have known,” he said softly as he shook his head.
"WEEP can get quite offensive. Changing of old ways and stuff." Harry waved him away as he continued to consider the matter at hand. "What have you done now? I'm not the issue because you didn't say no to the date. Just the location, so the location is the problem. Who is going to be there? Who do you want to avoid? Who can get themselves on the reservations list?"
Nonetheless, it was undeniable that he had possibly outgrown his original friends in some areas. Pansy didn't always understand the topics of his new books, and frankly, she didn't quite care. "What do you think about abortion," he blurted, incredibly nervous as Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, catching him out for deflection.
Draco startled in guilt at the look of concern on Potter's face, realising that he had withdrawn into himself, ruining any conversation that they were having. "Yes, I'm alright. Just realised how small the tart was. How do you find your mille crêpe?" He enquired politely, having recommended it to Potter.
"But I never do it intentionally. I mean, when I saw how I had hurt you, and after Ron reminded us to have fun, I realised how I had ruined everything because I was being selfish and childish and I really hated myself. I don't know how I deserve you when I'm still that snotty little boy on the train that you hated upon sight. I'm an arsehole who really doesn't deserve anything," Draco was tearing up now and Harry quickly cast a glamour over him.
"Harry, you didn't get anything from them, did you?" Hermione asked with mild disapproval while Pansy curved against her, running her fingers through her hair as she pressed her tongue against her front teeth.
It was just as well that Neville and him were held as references for integrity–because it surely did not apply to Hermione, who had been appointed as Head Girl.
Harry hummed in agreement as he savoured the sweetness of his own gift. He had sat through similar rants with Hermione to know what was expected of him.
for Potter. The idea of it always made him shudder. The only feelings he had with regards to the speccy git was immense annoyance. Couldn't Potter have been a less fine specimen of a man?
As per previous observations, interactions with Harry Potter never lead to my expected outcomes. Conversations are also very fast, and my brain filter is unable to catch up. As usual, I am more suggestible around Harry Potter. This time, we did not argue, nor were any illogical concessions made.
Draco was in good spirits. He had just sent out the results of the final session of Documentation, Forms, and Filing, and Harry had scored full marks on the final paper–ten marks higher than the second highest scorer. Curiosity had been Harry's greatest motivator—he had sat right in front of the class, listened raptly, memorised the meagre class notes, and set up his own
"Draco!" Teddy exclaimed when he noticed Draco at the doorway. Dropping the half-eaten cookie in his hand, he ran towards Draco in excitement, his hair a sandy brown with dark brown spots the colour of chocolate chips.
drop Potions reading," Malfoy stated even while moving the item to the next day. He returned the book to his bag.
Harry stared at her in confusion as he processed the timeline. He burst into laughter, “a splash of milk and none if he's stressed?"
"I'll tell your friends to visit, first thing in the morning!" He yelled as Madam Promfrey waved him away.
fought with the crowds to purchase the book) where Thunderous had elaborated his insertion of a whole arm into a horny dragon's vagina to soothe her.
"Well, you shouldn't even be saying that someone is gay just because they stare at a few arses or tits," Harry said loudly to regain their attention, taking full advantage of the Muffliato they had set up at the start of lunch.
"Alright," Draco acquiesced with amusement as he waved the lights off. Pressing himself close, he regulated his breath with Harry's. The warm, strong weight of his lover in his arms left him with an indescribable contentment. Their relationship in the past three months between their first kiss in Paris and now had been hectic, to put it lightly. He was glad that they had made it through the media fury, conflicting schedules and most importantly, incredulous and insufferable friends. Harry had shared about wanting to know him better after hearing stories from Hermione (was Hermione matchmaking when she mentioned him to Harry and vice versa? Was he reading too much into it?), and he had talked about his growing attraction to Draco through their interactions in his usual disarming honesty that left Draco uncomfortable, embarrassed but unquantifiably happy.
Thanking the maître d'hôtel as they took their seats, Draco watched carefully as Potter reached for the menu without any beat of hesitation. He had been surprised when Potter had asked about his favourite restaurant in Paris, and subsequently insisted that they visit.
Harry blinked at the obvious bitterness in Draco's tone. Perhaps he had really been more blind than he had thought. Did Draco encourage him to follow up on the networks he had made during events to spark a mentorship fervour? Everything had really been in front of him, simply waiting for him to see properly.
"Potter, for the sake of Merlin and God, is this an inquisition?" Draco snapped as he folded his arms in disapproval.
"You'll have to make it up to me then," Draco said, smiling sweetly as he threaded his fingers between Harry's.
“I’ll buy you lunch if you do as well, or better than Hermione in NEWTs,” Harry said suddenly without opening his eyes.
There was only one person who would leave him gifts in the middle of the night—“Pepper?" he whispered, clenching his fist when the house-elf didn’t appear. It had been wishful thinking in the first place, he inhaled shakily, trying not to think about the dirt framing her face when he had buried her.
“Alright, I’ll be back in a few hours. You’ll need to get more rest for your body to recover. In the meanwhile, should I… send up the newspaper?” the Healer said speculatively to Harry.
Pace unfaltering as Harry's balls tightened, Draco bobbed up and down the warm length with hollowed cheeks as he reached between his own legs to match the unrelenting rhythm. Draco swirled his tongue on Harry's slit as Harry arched off the bed, orgasm tearing across his body, fingers going slack in Draco's hair.
It was unfortunate that between his work and the general anxiety of an imminent humiliation by Potter, he had not come up with the terribly obvious solution on his own. He could have otherwise skipped the messy conversation where Pansy had insisted that he had
Harry sat down awkwardly when Teddy left. He rewrapped the pot carefully for want of something to do, jumping when Malfoy spoke first.
"That's where I usually get the groceries for Wednesday," Draco pointed out as they walked down the street, their interlocked hands tucked into the pocket of his coat.
Draco grabbed his wrist. “No direct spellwork,” he said sharply, rolling his eyes at the look of embarrassment he received. “Umbrella.” He demonstrated with a flick of his wand as he dropped Harry’s hand belatedly, quickly attempting the similar thunderstorm spell to recover himself. The misery he felt from the rain soaking through his clothes helped clear his mind of his body’s treacherous response to physical contact with Harry.
"We were with Malfoy when we walked into an ambush. Seven students tried to attack him. This is not the first time, and they have also have been bullying other Slytherins," Hermione stated as the Headmistress' eyes swept back and forth between her students in anguish.
Draco raised a cool brow at Potter's words. It was such a typical Gryffindor behavior to not know what they were signing up for. "I don't usually bring them either but I figured that we were due for a conversation."
“It wasn’t. I learned it from Mother,” Draco said, checking the book that they had tossed a distance away when their duel had become serious.
"I didn't mean to start it," Draco said guiltily. Ron and Ginny would always argue at least once during their drinks, and he had unintentionally been the catalyst tonight.
"Potter! It's cursed!" Draco yelled out of the blue, laughing when the other startled, knocking the box out of his own hands. In his fumbling attempts to catch it, his fingers came into contact with the cufflinks anyway. "You should have seen your face!" Draco laughed as he mimicked Potter's comical movements.
Giving in to the propriety of his upbringing, Draco pushed his desert to the center of the table with the grace and manners befitting a Malfoy. He offered his spoon wordlessly, on a mission to not speak a word until they parted, just so that the date would seem even more disastrous, when he recounted it to his friends.
Harry moaned incoherently as he pressed his eyes closed. He wished that they would stop arguing. Also, Malfoy liked his apples peeled, quartered, and cored. Anyone would know this if they spent just a little bit of time on Malfoy.
"It's not so bad," Malfoy said after a while when Harry had chucked it out of sight. "It's useful at least. Actually, it's kind of thoughtful."
"Can't believe that you lost my cousin, Potter," Draco said as they stepped out of the hospital for lunch while Teddy visibly vibrated at the excitement of visiting a Muggle eatery, having gotten over the disappointment of not visiting Uncle George at Diagon Alley.
"Well, it would surely ease them into our relationship, wouldn't it?" Potter shrugged with careless ease, his eyes bright with mirth as he continued to slather unhealthy amounts of butter on his bread roll.
Goyle sat down heavily, sighing as he stretched his legs out. “You didn't get grievously injured, did you?”
"I really wouldn't know," he replied as he looked away quickly, eyes darting to Granger before settling onto Draco once more.
"A bit. I mean, you can sort of tell, and it fits, you know?" Ron said as he stopped outside his own room.
"Oh, shut up," Draco rolled his eyes at him in amusement. "I'll drag you down with me," he said as he pulled Harry's comforter and gestured for him to move.
The not-too-distant past would creep up on him often and catch him unaware, but he had to continue with his day as his mind healer had advised.
In all honesty, Draco spent the entirety of January considering whether to throw out the blasted Potter calendar before he had come to the inevitable fact that he could never part with it. There was no cure to the insatiable hunger, and Draco was resigned to salivate with the rest of the wizarding world over Potter's semi-nude form every month, foreseeable year and all of eternity.
Molly has decided to throw a birthday party for you whether or not you are around, and the damned thing starts right at seven in the morning.
"Potter, you're really," he paused exasperatedly to search for the right words. "You're really a whole level apart and then some."
Draco looked up from his page to meet her eyes. Surprised by the seriousness that he saw, he nodded in agreement in place of anything better.
Draco pressed the bottom half of their bodies close, their legs tangling together. A helpless noise between a moan and a sigh fell from Draco's lips when he accidentally rubbed their cocks against each other.
Harry shrugged as he sipped his butterbeer. "It started with questions about Muggle Studies, I think. Hermione likes her wit."
The Prophet has always treated the media-shy Saviour of the Wizarding World as a spectacle for quick galleons, and to be considered for an interview spoke of the Junior Auror's desperation. As a friend, I was glad to see him. As a reporter, I was ashamed.
"Think about Hogsmeade, alright? You could save me from a full day of Draco's overbearing presence," she said, addressing the second half of her comment towards Draco, who only glared at her.
Draco returned his attention to his table when the server returned with his crème brûlée and nothing for Mr "sweets are for kids". Thanking the server, Draco felt his mood recover as he marvelled the plate before him.
"Are you okay?" He asked afterward, the silence between them comfortable in their trek back to Hogwarts.
Draco poured hot water onto the teapot from the enchanted kettle before lifting the now-warm lid. He filled the teapot with water. His hands were steady as he then drained the pot evenly onto the filter and the pitcher.
Draco's brows raised in amusement. He had been recommending the public relations company he had on retainer for the longest time but to no avail. Apparently, all it took was to force his hand. "My remuneration is above the retainer fee," he clarified. Both Ginny and Ron sputtered in the background.
"Hello," he said nervously as he inspected Malfoy quickly, his heart twinging at Malfoy's swollen eyes. "Erm, morning," he corrected himself, smiling hopefully when Malfoy greeted him with a nod.
Draco returned his attention to the one-sided conversation his insufferable blind date was having with himself. "—differentiation of bond price with respect to the interest rate.  Because the bond price is always the same, the differentiation is always zero, which is the best investment anyone with any ounce of sense can make!"
“He’s a good boy,” Teddy said, petting his pot fondly as he set it down. “I’ll get you your favourites? Do you want anything else?” he asked Harry and Malfoy, thanking him when Harry handed him his wallet.
Draco wet his lips as he subtly looked around their table, hoping that nobody else was paying attention to the trainwreck that was happening. He made a face when he caught a piteous look from a dark haired girl. Nonetheless, Draco had really brought it upon himself, as usual.
"Cool!" Teddy breathed in awe as he reached to run his finger across what Draco knew to be a pink and ghastly scar. Draco had managed to isolate the plant's toxin and develop an antidote from the sample provided, and his feverishly gibbering patient had fully recovered after half a week of recuperation. The scar however, would take weeks to look better. Draco sighed, looking up at the startled laughter from his patient.
They rounded the corner. "Protego!" He shouted, jinxes bouncing off his shield as he pulled Malfoy backwards.
"My Father alluded that I led to his loss, and reminded me to marry a Pureblood girl–" Malfoy said flatly as if he was nothing of great concern "–regardless of my sexual proclivities."
Growing up, the tome of Roman classics had been one of his favourite books in the Manor Library and he remembered the story of Cupid and Psyche in the second half of the book. These were surely reminiscent of Cupid's arrows. He knew that the truth was often concealed in stories, events before a writing system passed down through narration, picking up embellishments as it transmitted from one generation to another. After all, didn’t the Muggles think that Merlin was a myth? However, for
Many things to do tonight; please prepare accordingly. Have also taken the liberty to inform Bainbridge & Daughters that we'll be going down tomorrow. They will be preparing their assessment and recommendation for your public image.
Draco kicked him on his shin reflexively before shooting him an apologetic look. "How did you even find it? How did you break in?"
Harry was reluctant to leave on his own and break the camaraderie–however one sided–that he had forged with Malfoy, but the other boy seemed so engrossed with his book. He wanted to avoid Malfoy's temper as much as possible.
"Are you alright?" Harry asked, reaching over to squeeze Draco's hand. Draco felt his heart stutter at the depth of concern in Harry's eyes. He had been pushing Harry away for so long but he had still stayed. Draco would never be able to give him everything that he deserved, but he would try, and maybe that would be enough. The papers would descend on them, and his classmates would gossip, but having Harry made him happy, and he would be brave. He would fight for the things he cared about.
Malfoy continued to chuckle as he combed his long fringe backwards. Harry's stomach twisted in hurt at Malfoy's callous response.
“Maybe you could try them on our friends this weekend,” Draco suggested, subtly inviting Harry to the Hogsmeade trip, no matter that it was pretty much given that he would join them since Pansy had invited Hermione, who would invite Ron—he had to fulfill the
"Seamus, knock it off," Hermione said as she pulled the boy off firmly by the arm, a small smile of amusement on her lips when she met Harry's bright eyes and flushed cheeks.
I wish that you didn't remind me about those events. I am already getting invites for the next six months! Bloody hell, it's
"Oh, right. They're a laugh," Harry agreed. "Do you think that you'll get anything today?" He asked, jogging a bit to catch up with Malfoy.
"I'm so sorry, er," Potter said, his eyes frantic as the grip of his hand tightened. "I don't know what happened. Are you okay?" He asked as he helped Draco sit up carefully, a hand on the small of Draco's back.
"Yeah, I will be. It'll be a quiet evening. Before the Dark Lord's return, my family would throw a lavish Christmas party every year." He shrugged to himself as Potter started to list against him on the sofa.
Harry smacked himself in the forehead, wincing when it connected more soundly than he had intended. He hadn't even informed Draco that he wouldn't be able to make it.
"You're so sleazy," Draco rolled his eyes in fond amusement as he returned to his essays. "Don't you have any marking to be done?" He poked Harry with his red biro.
It was so horribly perverted that Draco could no longer wank to his calendar, and the subsequent dry spell had left him mentally susceptible. When he had been cleared to attend the potions conference in Paris, Draco had—horror of horrors—imagined surreptitiously meeting Potter in Paris, even going so far as to entertain the idea of loitering around the Pride's pitch to surreptitiously meet Potter like a lovesick Harcher.
Thus, after reviewing your application, we have decided that we will not offer you an interview. We wish you the best in your future endeavours.
Unfolding the papers from the box, he translated his distant aunt’s matchmaking reports with a quick spell before skimming through them. He had come to see his inheritance as an honor, but with the passing of the first week of December, the pressure to fulfill his monthly matchmaking quota (beginning with one in his first calendar month) loomed over him heavily.
"Thanks," Harry said, reluctantly reaching for the urgent pile. His brows climbed as he read a note. "It's already addressed. Robards didn't know that I was out yesterday." He set down the original in his hand sheepishly.
Harry looked up to complain to Hermione about the paper when he finally registered the grave expression on his friend's face. He watched in confusion as Hermione frowned, her eyes widening as she pointed her jaw at the hat slightly.
"Did you erm-" he looked around the bed, brightening when he saw the gift exchange present on the bedside table. "You haven't opened it?"
Panic began to crawl over Draco's skin. Should he dismiss Finch-Fletchley immediately to escape Potter's humiliating sympathy? Or should he gesture something rude at Potter? While Draco had been deliberating his next move, Hermione seemed to notice that she had lost her friend's attention, and she turned around with a look of annoyance. Great, now two of the Golden Trio was pitying him. Oh joy, it was now officially three out of three. Draco couldn't remember when he had last been so fortunate.
"Didn't you tell him not to have so many cookies?" Draco crossed his arms as he turned to look at Harry with a frown.
“You’re not. There’s always new memories to be made,” Malfoy said with heavy reluctance. He looked away as he removed his hand.
“It’s faster this way, don’t you think? We’d be done with practice in no time,” Draco called over the volume, laughing at the fog that had begun to envelop him. Dismissing it, he hurriedly waved away the silenced tornado headed his direction.
"Potter will you cease with this nonsense!" Draco yelled as he tried to roll him over. "Hand it over this instant!"
“It’s about accessibility,” Dean said tiredly, his resignation evident that it was a tired argument.
"Is it really there?" Harry yelled as he tried to peer over Malfoy. "It is!" He gasped, yelping when Malfoy grabbed him by the back of his collar.
“Erm, they were concerned, I guess? That we weren't talking even though we were roommates," he said, slumping when Draco only raised an unimpressed brow at him.
"Thanks. You could do your hair, too. Keep it down or something," Draco said, eyeing Harry's fringe that had escaped his messy low bun. He returned the mirror back to a roll of parchment.
Sure, he had heard about Potter from Hermione, his cousin and his aunt, but he had never once talked to Potter properly nor sat across him for meals. The world had spun off its axis since the announcement of the charity calendars.
Draco jumped as a hand touched his shoulder. "Potter!" Draco greeted in shock, noting the mirth and intensity on the man's face as he felt his body reflexively clench in excitement.
Your date sounds like it'll be very violent. Can't believe that they agreed to go out with you at all. Do you need help from your wardrobe consultant?
"Yeah, erm, I was worrying about having the whole Harry Potter is your gifter conversation," he said, knowing better than to lie. He had embraced the fact that he was
," he emphasised as he looked at Malfoy while walking. "But I apologise for scaring you. And I accept your apologies." He grinned at Malfoy, knocking the side of his arm against him in amusement.
“I’ll kill you if you dump me,” Draco said non-sequitur, breaking the silence as he rubbed Harry’s soulmark forcefully.
Draco felt his cock harden as the photograph replayed, his eyes focusing on different parts of the picture each time. He desperately fought the urge to reach between his legs to stroke himself.
"How did you know that I was around?" Potter asked as he clumsily caught the gifts that Draco tossed over.
"Doesn't St Mungo's have a common intake for all of their trainee healers?" Girl Weasley interrupted. "Julie Whithall was talking about it," she explained when everyone looked at her in surprise.
"Anyway, I think that your gifter is brilliant. Can you tell me whenever you receive more gifts? I'd like to see them too," Harry asked as he pulled his spectacles off carelessly before setting it aside.
"I can't imagine Ron and Hermione shagging under the same roof as Mother," Draco said darkly as they continued to walk again.
Malfoy's brows creased in consideration. "Yeah, that's pretty awful. I hope that they're not too big a fan of Harry Potter," he pat Harry's shoulder comfortingly. Harry's stomach only sank further. The problem was that his giftee–Malfoy himself–wasn't too big a fan of Harry Potter in the first place.
"Harry Potter!" He announced as he pounced on Harry, "I'm your Secret Santa, Harry! Harry I love you!" He made noisy kissing noises over a squirming Harry, while the Hufflepuff girls looked on with poorly concealed jealousy.
Likewise, he had tried to convey his love for Harry in his gestures and tone, but he was aware of its inadequacy. After multiple taunts from his best friends, Draco had come to terms with the duration of his attraction to Harry, and the fact that he was a good person worthy of Harry's equivalent esteem. Draco wanted to work hard for his lover.
“I’m glad to be sitting here too,” Hermione said as she wiped the tears in her eyes away fiercely. Harry smiled at her in agreement.
Draco wiped his tears discretely as Teddy tried his best to loop the tinsel around the tree. Harry reached over to squeeze his left hand and held it in his.
"Then perhaps you shouldn't be prodding it with your wand," Draco advised as he walked towards his dressing room for a change of clothes.
"You guys are not going to force us to drink your poncey drinks, are you?" Harry asked Malfoy as he cupped his hands around his steaming mug of mulled wine, relishing in its warmth. Harry was reacting poorly to the winter this year and would wear multiple layers even indoors.
organically that it wasn't surprising that he had royally messed up his first and only attempt at officially making
"Of course I didn't," he said. "I didn't! I was very well behaved!" He insisted when Draco looked at him skeptically. "Can we talk about something sexier? Or whatever you do in that shop? I can't bear this sort of talk when we're going to part so soon," he begged.
"What?" Ron demanded when both Draco and Harry looked at him sharply. "He looks awful! He's projecting the leave-me-alone aura!"
"Gryffindor wouldn't serve you well," the Hat said suddenly. Draco rolled his eyes in response. He could have stated the same without any help. "You've outgrown Slytherin, and Ravenclaw would be too simple for you.
“Potter, etiquette,” Draco exclaimed, gesturing to himself, scowling when the strong gust of wind from Harry made him shiver. Quickly drying himself, he conjured a weak tornado, mindful of the book as he sent the wind towards Harry.
Malfoy's shoulders loosened as he exhaled in relief. Harry experienced a similar gratitude when the familiar weight of Malfoy against his side returned.
"I'm always good!" Teddy said exuberantly before he charged out of the kitchen while making swooshing noises.
Ron looked around quickly before bending close again. “The thing! The thing we did!” He elaborated in exasperation when Harry only continued to stare at him blankly.
Harry huffed in amusement as he closed his eyes. Draco took the opportunity to look at the shadow of Harry’s lashes against his cheeks, the slope of his nose, and the amused upturn of his lips.
"No, no. I'm just curious," Potter defended quickly. "I was wondering if you were going to be reading again, or whether you would be going out, since you look dressed for it, you know?" Potter was clearly flustered as he went to drag his hand through his hair before stopping when he remembered that he had his hair up in a messy bun.
"Hermione!" Draco greeted in surprise when he noticed his friend in his room. "I didn't hear you come in."
folder for practical application. In response, Draco had started to send out the hate mails to Baringstone in preparation of the last class. He was prepared to come clean about his perverse indulgence of the letters.
Privately, Harry worried if his tirade would only set Draco further from Pansy's favour. It had been evident yesterday that Pansy had been similarly gunning for Draco as she did him, and they were supposedly friends. Harry watched as Pansy suddenly slapped the table and started gesturing at Draco's face–oh crap–the Slytherins were grinning at him. He quickly shoveled more eggs into his mouth just for something to do. Should he sleep with his wand in hand if tonight in case Pansy came to slit his throat? He peeked at the happenings, unsurprised to see Draco cowering as Pansy began to list off her fingers while the Slytherins nodded in agreement. Draco seemed contrite as he worried at his lips, and Harry felt a wave of sympathy for him.
, the most powerful burn salve on the market and had made strides in the field of nerve regeneration and trauma management potions. As usual, even his concoctions at discovery stages were incredibly effective—Harry held no bitterness at the knowledge. After a particularly bad explosion during one of his earlier missions, he would have been left for dead had it not been for
"Wait, Malfoy," he called out as he tossed his tie onto his bed. He rattled off the series of spells Hermione had taught him to determine the safety of posts from strangers.
"Thanks," he said as he tucked his wand under his pillow, sighing when the lights in the room went out. "And for the short Potions lesson today," he added into the darkness. He bit his lips when Malfoy only grunted in response.
"Wait, can you hand this to him?" Vinegar girl suddenly burst out as she broke free, thrusting a letter and a box of chocolates towards him.
Anyway, I wouldn't have told them what you were wearing but I can see why you would worry. I'm getting more and more excited about your date! It's almost like I'm going on it too.
He opened the door that led to his rooms. He would make himself a spot of tea—that always helped to clear his mind. Taking a deep breath, he collected himself before reaching for the tea set that he had stowed away in his bookshelf. As he set it up carefully, he felt his mind calm. When he was younger, he used to relish the rare times Mother performed the tea ceremony during good weather days in the garden.
Weasley leapt into fury at the insinuation. "They wouldn't dare!" He exclaimed. "You're not that much of a ponce anymore now, are you? If a Weasley and a Malfoy can get along, I don't see why you can't be saving people!"
"Harry's always been bloody obsessed with you, and not knowing where you're disappearing to over the weekends is bloody killing him. You better do something by this week or I'll slice you apart." Weasley threatened, glaring at Draco. After a few moments of silence punctuated by his heavy breathing, he tossed Draco's quilt on the floor and stormed out.
He traced the familiar print of François Gérard's painting of "Cupid and Psyche" on its cover, marvelling at how smooth the paper felt. Was this Muggle paper? He wondered if Harry would know—the slight amusement evaporated when he flipped open the flimsy pieces of paper and read the short introduction.
"Normal people don't read such stuff," Potter said as he broke off into a yawn without closing his mouth. "Are you ever going to join us for Quidditch?" He asked as he dug his toes into Draco's thighs pointedly.
"Imagine having them working together in DMLE though." Weasley had a faraway look in his eyes as he thought about the top two students of their level enacting change from within the Ministry.
The bland smile Draco had on his face fell away when the door swung open with a flourish to reveal his one night stand's neighbour, Harry bloody Potter himself.
"Well, that's conflating antagonism and awe with stunted emotions!" He complained as he reached for the trifle himself.
“And finally, the best for the last!” Teddy exclaimed as he skipped towards a dark grey shop in glee.
Draco grinned unrepentantly as he straightened his school robes after the crawling. "Just completing our lesson for today."
Draco measured the man with narrowed eyes. After joining professional Quidditch, Potter had become an absolute media darling. Reporters swooned over Potter's playful charm and charisma, and Draco had listened to his convicted opinions on the Arrows' odds over the wireless. Potter fended off intrusive questions so casually that Father's eyes would have watered in envy. However, the Potter before him definitely didn't live up to his public image. If he had to be honest, Potter hadn't seemed like he had grown much from his Hogwarts days.
Harry refused to rise to the bait, settling instead for a straightforward death glare. Privately, it really was difficult given the distance between the respective tables, but Malfoy's distinctive colouring had always made things easier. Still, it wasn't something that he would tell Ron, especially when it would be used against him one day.
Draco made a strangled noise when Harry trailed a line of hot kisses upwards, nuzzling into his neck before biting it and immediately soothing the hurt with his tongue. Harry’s hand slipped under his shirt, pushing it upwards as he ran his hands across Draco’s back.
After thinking, Harry responded. “Well I’m not 100 percent sure, but I think being around people would help. Being on the lower floors might not help as most of the problem is the fear that walls might collapse. Outside might help; it’s not the storm itself that bothers me but being in an open space helps me a lot.”
Draco smiled and said, “Do your worst. You can not phase me,” as they moved on from Blaise’s embarrassment. All the Slytherins looked at each other, and they all had an evil glint in their eyes.
A little while later, the group decided to go in a circle and give fun facts about themselves and their peers to get to know each other. In the first round, they would share a fact about themselves. From then on, they would share a fact about someone else in the group. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dean, Seamus, Neville, Theo, Blaise, Draco, Pansy, and Luna were all playing and were sitting in that order.
It was Monday morning, so this afternoon he would be talking to Ron and Hermione. He woke up and did his typical scrambling around to get ready, along with waking Ron up.
“That explains how one day you were friends, and then somehow, the next day, you’re both gay and together,” Neville said.
As they walked down to Care of Magical Creatures, they chatted about what they would be learning about today. They reached Hagrid’s hut and saw a flying scorpion-like thing in a cage outside the hut.
They both gave up on seeking the snitch where they were and slowly flew back towards the middle of the pitch. It was a while longer before either of them saw that small flash of gold that they were looking for, but in the background, he could almost tell what was going on below him.
Harry whooshed through the floo to Gregor’s office. Though he could apparate, he found that it wasn’t the most fun to have to walk out of the Hogwarts wards in the colder months.
Harry was very surprised. He hadn’t expected that. He supposed he should tell Ron about Draco too… He took a deep breath before slowly saying, “I have a crush on Draco. We are now dating.”
“Yeah. The day was going fine, but that night I had a nightmare. That part is normal; I get them all the time. This time, Ron woke me up. He said I had been screaming and woke everybody up.” Harry took a deep breath and continued. “I finally woke up and told everybody to go back to bed and that I was fine. I then went down to the common room because I know I wouldn’t be able to sleep. Ron followed and we talked for a little while.”
For the rest of the time until his appointment they all studied and did their homework, though he and Ron did get distracted. By the time dinner rolled around, that had gotten almost all of their homework for the next week done. When they finished dinner, Ron and Hermione went back to the common room to finish their work, after dropping Harry at McGonagall’s office.
Harry let out a huff. “Remind me to thank her. Never thought I would be thanking Pansy Parkinson of all people.”
He hated talking about when he was a kid. And how on earth had McGonagall seemed to be able to read him so well? And then there was Malfoy! He was surprised at what Malfoy had suggested, but it made a lot of sense... and, that information... Malfoy’s after beat him? That didn’t seem like how he would act, with seeing how much from the outside it seemed like his father loved him.
In a shaky voice Malfoy said, “Whatever I did my father would find the wrong in it, he beat me every day.” All he said in response was “Even.”
That morning, they had double charms then double transfiguration. As he woke up, he thought about the day before.
She sat down with a sigh. “He’s right. I wanted something more interesting in the bedroom, but he isn’t up for that.” Harry glanced at Draco for support; the blonde spoke up, “I get it. I- I left one of my partners because of similar reasons.”
Harry laughed and said, “Just wait, you’ll see.” He dragged Draco through the portrait, and towards his room, sitting on his bed.
Pansy laughed and said, “Sometimes I just need a break from being bossy and uptight. It’s nice to let go.” Draco just shook his head and said, “Moving on, how about you go Hermionie? You don’t participate enough in these.”
Hermione sighed and responded, “Oh well, I suppose I will. Never have I ever been pinned down.” Draco, Pansy, Ron, Dean, Seamus, and Theo took their shots. Seeing as the last question was pretty much the opposite of this, no one was too surprised.
“I- Thank you.There isn’t really a reason for you to trust me, but you do. I don’t deserve that. Or Harry for that matter.”
As he looked around again, he noticed Harry staring at a spot near one of the stands. As he looked he saw a flash of gold before Harry was off. He raced off after him, a couple of meters behind. He gained a couple of feet and got far enough forward to bump into him. Harry took a second to shift back, and Draco was in the lead.
As everyone finished their breakfast and grabbed their bags before class Harry decided that he would go to the library in his free period while Hermionie had Arithmancy so he wouldn’t be pestered by her.
Harry just nodded, wanting to get the rest of the story out. “My cousin was always the star kid. He was a spoiled brat, almost like you used to be. Even if he got a horrible grade, and I got perfect grades, I would get punished. There was no winning for me. He also didn’t treat me very well. He always bullied me, and my aunt and uncle did nothing about it.”
“Mister Malfoy, I just wanted to inform you that the few essays of yours you have actually turned in, were quite amazing. I’m sure I would enjoy them even more, if you chose to turn more of them in. If you don’t, I’m afraid I will have to give you detention.” the witch said. Continuing, she said, “You may be dismissed. As for you Potter, have a seat.”
Harry smiled, returning the grip on his hand. The two walked out of the ROR and headed to the common room. They walked past the portrait, and Harry settled on one of the couches while Draco grabbed them tea in the kitchens. When he came back, Draco asked, “Do you want to play a game of chess?” Harry smiled and nodded, though he knew it was unlikely that he would win.
They were sitting in the hallway not far from the Room of Requirement talking about everything and nothing. The other grade years had more classes than them so it was pretty quiet. Harry leaned his head on his boyfriend's shoulder. They sat there for a while longer before a first-year Hufflepuff student walked past them. The first-year stopped in from t of them, drew their wand and a spell flew at Draco as the first-year yelled “You deserve that you Death-Eater murderer!”. Harry quickly cast a protego and a shield erupted from his wand, protecting him and his boyfriend. The Hufflepuff cowered and quickly scampered away. Harry stood up but was stopped by Draco. “Don’t bother love, It was just a stinging jinx and not a very good one, besides, it didn’t hit me and I’ve dealt with much, much worse hexes and curses thrown my way,” Draco said with what looks like a reassuring grin, albeit a forced one. Harry rolled his eyes scoffed, shrugging Draco’s hands off, and chased the first year.
“Wow, it does sound like it has been a really long week. Let’s start by working through what happened between Ron and Hermionie. I’m surprised they didn’t work out. I always thought they’d end up married and have a little family of their own. What happened?”
Ron dropped his head onto the table, and Harry could see that Ron’s shoulders kept on shuddering with soft, barely suppressed sobs, leaving his distraught mate’s lips. A few beats passed before Ron spoke again, his voice quiet and raspy, face still hidden as he tried to hide how much this affected him. “I broke up with her. I… I don’t think it would’ve worked out. I need a simpler relationship, and she needs more than I can give her.”
They all sat down, Harry on the chair closest to the door, Ron and Hermione on the sofa next to each other, and Gregor in the other chair.
They practiced for an hour before it was time for dinner and the trio went to the Great Hall. Sam went to sit at the Hufflepuff table, and the older boys went to sit at the eighth year table. When they sat down, they were bombarded with questions about who 1the kid was, and why they were hanging out with him. Both Pansy and Hermionie said, “Who is that first-year Hufflepuff kid? And why are you hanging out with him?”
He felt kind of bad for adding, “and I don’t want people to start throwing curses as you because you’re gay either,” but it was true, and a realistic possibility.
Gray eyes looked from the sunlight bathed sky to the green eyes staring at him. Draco searched his boyfriend's eyes, looking for pity or other things he didn’t need. When he didn’t see anything other than love, he smiled and looked back to the sky.
Draco glanced over at his boyfriend before responding, “I think they will still be friends, they have too much history, and you Gryffindor lot are very sentimental people; I doubt they’ll throw away 8 years of friendship over a failed relationship. But I don’t think they will get back together. One, I think they are both right, Hermionie wants something more in the bedroom, and Ron isn’t the right one to give it to her. Two, I know that someone else in our year that fancies her, and I think he is going to make his very move soon once he caught wind that Hermonie is now available.”
Harry hesitated. He didn’t know if it was a good idea to give Malfoy’s secret away. Still, he remembered that Gregor had said that whatever was said in here, stays in here. So, he took a deep breath and responded in a quiet voice, “He told me that his father beats him every day.”
Harry smiled and said, “Even I can help put some color on those deathly pale cheeks. One time I caught him eavesdropping on a private conversation I had with Professor McGonagall.”
Sam giggled and pulled his wand from his bag, which he had sat on the floor. “You know you should always keep your wand on you. You never know when one of your enemies is going to throw a hex at you, and you wanna be able to grab it easily, best if you get a holster like me and have your wand on your body at all times,”
“I… Thank you. I’m sorry I got so upset, but your relatives, if you can even call them that, really didn’t treat you right. I feel even worse for how I treated you before, I didn’t know that much about your living situation. I’m sorry.”
He smiled. He had been doing a lot better since the war ended, and he had been able to go back to meeting with Gregor. He heard McGonagall start her speech, as she was the new headmaster, but he knew he didn’t have to listen. If there was something important, Hermione would let him know.
He was fighting back tears now. Hermione, as always, was one step ahead, and pulled a  tissue out and silently handed to him. He paused, and both of his best mates tried to hug him at once. As they leaned in, they bumped shoulders - hard. They at the same time said “ow” and rubbed their shoulders. They tried again and succeeded. Harry pulled back and croaked out a “thanks.”
Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath, he said in a carefully quite voice, “How much did you hear?” Quietly Malfoy responded, “All of it.“ As soon as this came out of his mouth he started, “I promise I won’t tell anyone, I-I-I...” In a very small voice he said, “Will you leave me alone if I tell you something about my childhood?” Inhaling sharply, he gave a quick nod, then they would each have a weapon against the other, and if they used their own, the other would use theirs against the other, it wouldn’t be worth the risk, they would be even.
Ron paused before saying, “Not right now. If you don’t mind, I’m just gonna stay here a while.” Ron lifted his head and smiled sadly at Harry. It hurt him to see his two best friends so distraught, but this was their problem, and he can’t do anything but silently give them support.
“You can see the sunset from here, and at night, all the stars and the constellations are visible. Draco, Sirius, Regulus, Andromeda.” Draco said quietly, playing with Harry’s hair.
Sam responded, “Now I don’t wanna do a hex, I wanna do a wandless hex!” The older boys laughed and Harry said, “Well, I’m sure that you could do that, but before you can do it without the wand, you need to be able to do it with the wand. Sam nodded and said, “Carry on with the lesson then.”
Draco knocked and tentatively walked in. As soon as he was across the threshold, he shut the door and threw up a wandless silencing charm.
Harry thought about how nice yesterday had been. He had been able to smile and laugh for what seemed like the first time in forever. It was kinda nice to not argue with the Slytherins just because they were the opposite house.
As they reached the great hall, the Trio sat down together as usual at the Gryffindor table. His mind must’ve wandered very far away because Hermione said, “Okay, what’s on your mind?”
As he entered the library, he spotted Hermione along one of the back rows of shelves. He walked over to her and she greeted, “Good morning Harry.” He responded, “Morning Hermione. Whatcha reading?” As she picked up another book, she explained. “I’m going through some of these books and seeing if I can’t find something that could help you with your nightmares.”
With this, Harry and Hermione shared a look and burst out laughing. “Ok, what is it you guys?” Hermione finally got out, “You know more about something than me!” With a look of disbelief, Ron started laughing too.
Harry laid out the blanket he grabbed on the grass near the lake and sat with his chin on his knees. It was a very nice day, with the sun shining but it wasn’t too hot. He heard running footsteps approaching but didn’t turn.
Hermione piped up with her question. “What would happen if he were to have a panic attack, and we couldn’t be there to help him? I mean, I’m sure others would be not helpful.”
Pansy was the first to go. “Never have I ever done it with a guy.” Harry’s glass stayed full, but most of the girls took shots, but Luna, Draco, Dean, Seamus, Neville, Theo, and of course Blaise took shots.
“I-I’m sorry. I’m sorry I made fun of you; I’m sorry I eavesdropped. I-I didn’t realize how hard you had it and that I would learn information that I didn’t want to know. That day I realized that I didn’t want to be your enemy. I told you that day about my father, not just so we were even, but because I wanted to get to know you. I know that after that, I still was not the nicest to you. I have no excuse for my behavior then. But... can we be friends?”
Ron said, “Well, that's one way to solve the problem.” Harry shrugged and Draco said, “Harry might have been yelling and scaring him, and it was the first thing that popped into my mind. When I’m in a tight situation, whatever pops into my head first happens.”
“Okay everyone listen up!” declared Hermione. “Every one work together to make a circle in front of the fire.” Looking around, he realized people were following the directions. He stood up and walked over to where one edge of the circle was forming and sat down. How bad could it be?
He reached the library, and after some searching, he found some of the stuff he wanted. He decided it would be better to read it in the safety of his room with no one looming over his shoulder. He left the library and walked back to his room with as little human contact as possible. He flopped down on his bed and read, though his mind did wander off several times.
Harry was surprised, though he realized that he shouldn’t have been, knowing what he knew from first year.
She laughed and said, “You’re right. Since no one else knows what it is, I'll even say it out loud. Who do you have a crush on?”
Sitting down next to her on the couch, he said quietly, “How much do you know about mind healers? I wanna know what to expect.” Closing her book slowly, she turned to face him. “I don’t know a lot about them. I’m guessing Ron knows more, or I can try to find something in the library.”
He grabbed the blonde’s shoulder with his other hand, shaking him gently. “There is nothing you can do. I’m safe now and not with them. I with you. Right here, right now. Can’t you feel me, Draco?  You don’t have to be mad. They already feel bad.” Slowly, the magic dissipated, leaving the room a mess. The table in front of them was shattered, and the mirror on the wall across from the couch was in shards on the ground.
He reached the ROR and he paced in front of the wall three times, and a big, wooden dor appeared. Harry then opened it and waited for Ron to get inside and closed the door shut. He sighed and turned. “When are you going to be ok with Draco?” He saw Ron physically droop a little.
He smiled and shook his head, trying to shake off the thoughts. He sat down across from his boyfriend and gently took Harry’s hand and kissing it gently.
Their lips moved together, Harry’s hands around the blonde's waist with Draco’s hand beside the brunette's head, and Harry’s hands wrapped around Draco’s neck. Harry then slowly started to relax. Draco moved his kisses down to Harry’s neck, who held back a moan. He waved his hand, with barely enough focus to get the silencing charm up.
He let out a sigh of relief and gave his professor a small smile and responded, “Thank you Professor McGonagall I better be off to lunch now.” He left the room and headed down to the great hall for lunch. As he walked down the halls, he thought about what he had read earlier. As his mind wandered around his sexuality, he thought about how he would tell Ron and Hermionie about it.
This messed with him a little, considering how wrong they were. It sent his mind to thinking about how others, who didn’t know him as well, perceived him. It didn’t bother him, just a bit curious.
Gregor pondered for a moment. “Well, most likely, everything would be okay. We should make sure all the professors know about panic attacks. Once we find out more, we can also try to avoid situations in class. Anything else?”
I hope you enjoyed! Thank you to my beta Liiizzaabeth_Rose! I had a bit of trouble with this chapter, so I’m sure there was more to fix than usual.
“Well, if you are going to teach that hex, love, you'll need your wand out,” Draco laughed. Harry rolled his eyes and pulled his wand out of his holster ad shot a discrete tripping jinx making Draco trip and glare at Harry who smirked and shrugged his shoulders innocently.
Harry quickly looked at his boyfriend, saying, “Oh love, you deserve us just as much as I deserve you. You never killed anyone. You saved me that time in the manor, and your mother saved me in the battle of Hogwarts.”
Pansy was the one to speak up about Theo. “Did you guys happen to know what happened the first night of fifth year?”
As she led Harry up the stairs, she pulled him into an unused classroom. Pulling a tissue from her bag, she wiped his tears away. After this, she conjured a cool, damp cloth and gently ran it over his face. Satisfied, she said, “Now no one can tell you were crying.”
Harry took a slow step into the room. Draco followed and then stepped ahead of the rubble. Harry stayed near the entrance, and Draco picked his way through the debris towards the back of the room, barely visible.
Harry sat down on the large armchair, Draco squeezing in next to him. They had decided that they needed to talk about their past, rather than just avoiding it and working around it. Harry looked down at his lap, nervously fiddling with his fingers, trying to work up the courage. They sat in silence for a moment before Harry started.
Harry reached over to his boyfriend for a kiss. The kiss turned into multiple, and soon Harry was sliding onto Draco’s lap. As they paused for a moment to catch their breath, Theo walked by, glancing at their red lips, laughed, “Get a room.”
Harry laughed and joined in on the impressions. “Turn to page three-hundred and…. ninety….four.” Harry drawled, pulling robes around him with a slight sneer on his face. Everyone laughed as they continued to imitate their old potions professor.
So I was gonna skip ahead to eighth year after last chapter, but it didn’t quite line up. I also thought a little explaining was due for that. I think that chapter ten is going to take place in eighth year. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed!
McGonagall looked at Harry with concern and pity in her eyes and responded, “Thank you kindly for telling me. I had my suspicion, Ms. Granger told me that she was leaving to try to calm you down. I understand that you don’t want your personal business to be common knowledge.”
His first night in his dorm, he didn’t cry himself to sleep. This was the first time that he can remember that he felt actually happy. The second night, he did, and someone heard him. Ron. This boy he was instant friends with, and he didn’t know he had heard him quietly sniffing.
I’m sorry these keep taking so long to post. My new goal is to post once a week, and mire often when I can.
Ron sighed and said, “Yeah, I am. I hope someone has brewed a hangover potion.” Harry smiled to himself, he had the same thought earlier.
Harry sighed. “I am still going to talk to McGonnagal in the morning. She can make an announcement to the whole school, and we don’t have to embarrass one specific kid. Anyways…” He trailed off, unsure how to put his next words. After a few moments, Draco said, “Hey, it’s alright to not talk about it all now. After all, this is the first week we’ve been together.”
Draco smiled, and a comfortable silence once again washed over them, which was once again broken by Draco started speaking softly.
Draco stood up and grabbed his boyfriend’s hand, dragging him away from the lunch they had just finished, whispering in his ear, “I want to show you my favorite place in the castle.” Harry smiled softly, still amazed that the blonde trusted him this much.
Thanks for reading! I would love constructive criticism! I hope you stick around! This was a little shorter than I thought, but hopefully most chapters will be longer!
With that Hermione headed one way and Ron and Harry the other. As they quietly got ready for bed, Harry thought the night over. Today had been a good day.
As they moved on, sharing facts about others, it got a lot more interesting. They had decided that they would go in the same order and give a fact about the person whose turns it was.
Draco brought his gray eyes to meet the emerald ones before saying, “I don’t mind. I want everyone to know that you’re off the market. But… we should talk about this more later.”  The blonde smiled and went back to eating, chatting with his friends and Harry knows, that nothing could go wrong with Draco by his side.
I hope you enjoyed! I think I am going to go for shorter chapters more often, rather than longer ones, partially because I know that I will forget to write... on that note, I will trust you guys to hold me responsible- here’s an Instagram just for you guys to remind me! @anikafangirl_  Thanks for reading, (plus I would love you forever if you left kudos or commented...) and bye for now!
It was Tuesday, and Draco and Harry were sitting together at lunch. The two had decided yesterday that they would talk this afternoon since they had a free period at the end of the day, so they would have more time.
Realizing he had been talking for a long time, and that he had started crying, he stopped. Gregor stood up and grabbed a box of tissues from his desk and set them in front of Harry, he sat back down. He crossed his legs and spoke up, “Wow. I didn’t really expect you to open up that much, especially in our first session, providing that you want to continue. I think I should tell you, though it probably won’t help much right away, you are perfect the way you are. There is nothing that you could have done, and you shouldn’t hate yourself.”
Hermione saw the opportunity and had taken it. By the morning, a motion was passed with near-unanimous support that Pansy, nor (pre-emptively) the Hufflepuffs in collective would be allowed to organise any subsequent eighth year parties.
"Whatever, I hope that you don't treat other Harchers this way." He smirked at the displeasure on Potter's face. "Don't sneer, Potter. You don't have the facial structure for it," Draco teased as he poked Potter's furrowed brow, laughing harder when he was swatted away.
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy's media representative requested for their clients' privacy, commenting that the duo were merely having a bit of sustenance. It is a timely reminder that even Harry Potter could possibly be as dull as you.
Privately, it was absolutely bizarre to hear his name on Malfoy's lips and he didn't think there was a need to change anything when it was fine–but everyone was looking at him and he didn't want to disappoint. He cleared his throat nervously, "I don't need your protection, Draco."
"I don't know," Malfoy said as he frowned at his gift. "Pansy has been mentioning about haircuts though," he said as he ran a hand through his hair, "but it's really quite thoughtful." He picked up the note to read it.
"There's nothing noble about supporting a competitor. They also copied the neon line remember?" Ginny said hotly.
"Get lost!" She snapped at Malfoy when he only gaped at her. Harry scrambled to make space for a sulky and tousled Malfoy.
"Release her!" Draco yelled at the sight of Ron grabbing his friend the moment Harry managed to penetrate the ward. He had rushed out of the Great Hall when he heard about the confrontation from the gossiping students.
"Baking cookies with Worry because 'Cousin Draco likes cookies'," Harry repeated in Teddy's childish, excited tone. "Are you okay? Didn't manage to get Morten?"
Draco bit his bottom lip as he observed Potter's easy confidence as he engaged the other man. Potter was really incredibly sexy, he thought idly to himself as he watched Potter's capable hands stack the menus. Draco imagined them tracing his body.
Harry swallowed. He registered the gravity of the situation, but he was unable to decipher what he had missed.
. Your Potions is so bad, you'll probably need to start from first year materials. Maybe you could speed it up if my boy helped you with that studying," he said as he sauntered down the aisle beside Malfoy lazily. He gave Malfoy a squeeze on the shoulder as he settled into the bench beside theirs in an unaffected sprawl.
Draco rolled his sleeves higher along his arm, sighing when he felt Potter's eyes following his movement. "Yes, I know that the colour doesn't favour me," he rolled his eyes. "It's like wrapping myself up with thirty Hufflepuff ties at once, but it’s the mandatory attire for the sharing session, you know?" He pulled Worry's latest forest green jumper on. "I try to avoid wearing the shirt as much as possible for the sake of my complexion, and everyone's well being" he continued, dabbing on his cologne in the mirror while Harry stood unmoving.
Harry nodded as he corroborated the presence he could feel in the third floor. He should really start in the identification wards so that he didn't end up killing someone.
The camera pans across a minimalist looking café, the lighting warm and the patterned yellow cushions on the benches inviting. A pair of hands are icing a round pink pastry with bunny ears. The steady hands draw a set of chocolate eyes and a soft curling mouth, before moving to the next.
Draco tugged at his hand sharply. "How would you know? Merlin, did you stay-" he cut himself off as he motioned for Harry to continue with his eyes.
Harry sighed as he fell back onto his bed. He had finally listened to Hermione and initiated conversation with Malfoy, but all these exchanges seemed more like harassment on his part.
"Did you get somebody good?" Harry asked when Malfoy finally returned from his nightly routine. Harry bit the insides of his cheek when he noticed the sudden stillness in the line of Malfoy's shoulders.
"Of course I do," Harry said, his voice rough and tinged with amusement. "It's nice to know that you don't have acne under your clothes."
It did not escape Draco that the Chosen One had forgotten about the streak of ingenuity he had previously with regards to the mint leaf. As expected, beyond the fluke in sixth year, Potter was but a below average Potions student.
"Fine, Potter. Fine!" Malfoy slammed his hand onto the bench to swipe his own textbook off. "You act like you're so benevolent but you're no better than your cronies. You want my blood, right? Fine!" Malfoy shouted, fumbling with his ingredients as his hands trembled with fury.
Heightyhill's Household Helpers—Draco marvelled darkly at the new stationery on his desk. He turned it around, stuck his finger clumsily into the flap, immediately dropping it when a blue spell shot towards his eyes, shattering and bouncing off the charmed lens on his dragonhide mask. Swearing loudly, he rounded his desk to inspect the singe in his wallpaper.
Draco still found it surreal that Potter would be receptive to the idea of spending an entire evening with him alone. Not counting the impromptu lunch with Teddy, it wasn't lost on him that Potter had been laughing at his misfortune the last time they had been in a restaurant. Now, they were sitting opposite each other. It was far from a date, though. A dinner between friends maybe?
The sky had only begun to lighten when Draco snapped to sudden consciousness on a Muggle's bed for the second time in the month. Removing the pale arm on him carefully, he mentally catalogued the crustiness in his nether regions. With his friends' preference for Muggle bars post-war and his unfortunate horniness since the start of the year, Draco had come to be familiar with the sensation of dried come in the morning.
He spooned another serving for Malfoy in wordless comfort. Dinner had been rushed under Malfoy's strict studying schedule, and Harry had privately shed a tear in gratitude when he had unwrapped the treacle tart on his bed.
In a typical fashion, Hermione had swiftly disappeared with Weasley to places Draco didn't want to think about; to engage in activities Draco definitely did not want to know about. It was most unfortunate that Draco did though, due to a fifth year prefect who had approached him with a haunted look one day. He had yelled at the boy, who had replied with equal ferocity that it was a shared burden.
