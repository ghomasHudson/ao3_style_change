“Is that why you’re being nice to me?” Harry asks, even though he knows that this has become something more than that, at least hopes it is. Still, the thought starts to trickle into his bones like ice and makes him more afraid than he thought it could.
“This wouldn’t just be a plot to mess up my chiseled good looks with some well placed hexes, would it?” Harry asks, trying to temper the awkwardness. He wants to kick himself when he remembers his conversation with Luna and the episode with the tea. He almost follows it with a desperate ‘no homo’ for all the good it would do him.
He half-hoped that the forest would bring him Harry again, but he didn’t know how to ask. He knew it brought out the bits of him he wanted to go dormant, that Harry brought out all of his nastiness and made him cruel. Even still, thinking about his attention made Draco’s skin prickle.
“Great. See you soon. When you have case updates.” Draco says, leaning against the counter as Jasmine gives him a cheerful wave and goodbye. As the door closes behind him, he hears Draco say “Not. A. Word.” to Jasmine, which he decides not to read into.
“Kinda,” Harry said. He couldn’t exactly come out and say what had actually been happening. There was no way he could phrase it without it sounding horrible. Probably because it was horrible, but somehow it was less so when he was the only one who knew. “It’s dumb.”
Draco comes down off the counter much later, and their cups are long empty, silence falling around them like new snow. He sets his mug in the sink and comes back to run his hand over the skin of Harry’s arm, leaving the kitchen without another word. Harry almost follows him but pauses to wash their mugs out instead, feeling sleepy and oddly domestic.
“Among others,” Draco says, sitting back on his heels. “Are there any I’m missing? If you take your shirt off are your organs just going to fall out?”
“So who are you asking to the ball?” Harry asked, after Draco had lead her through a few very rusty under-arm turns. It wasn’t quite as easy as just going for a spin,  and Malfoy gave her a number of disapproving looks even though she was trying her best.
“How should I know?” Harry says, feeling timelessness in the room again. He would almost think it was a charm except that he can’t sense the murmur of any enchantments.
“I’m bisexual, you freak,” she says, turning back to Hermione and Harry. “Draco’s an idiot cocksucker.”
“But your personal life is so interesting,” Harry pressed, letting Draco push her into an under-arm turn that ended quite badly. “I’m going as friends with Anthony, we’re going to wear teal.”
“Oh no, I didn’t mean it like that!” she says, looking a little embarrassed. “Harry, don’t tease me about the crossword puzzles, you know how I feel.”
“Do you want to like,” Harry stumbled over the words, unable to find one that didn’t make her cringe a little. “Maybe, do things together? And hold hands sometimes?”
He tugged Draco closer, trying to kiss him harder to see if he could find some place he might flicker out of existence, somewhere he wouldn’t ring so true. He hoped for that, some break in the illusion so he wouldn’t be able to delude himself into thinking it was real.
“Yeah, I can,” Harry said, in English, and the snake gave an irritated flick of its tongue. “I don’t know, I don’t think I can speak it.”
Draco nodded, resisting the urge to deny it just to push Harry further away. He looked down at Harry’s body and the water pooling around them, and had a sudden, more insidious thought about just what the forest had in mind. “Something like that.”
She leaned down closer to them, sending through a breeze that smelled like the first night, like roses and lakewater and bright winter air and sage and treacle tart. She made the ground just a little bit softer, made the spiderwebs glimmer softly in the low light of her trees
“Are you saying you don’t want to be my friend?” Harry asked, and then blundered on before Draco could answer. “Because last time I asked if you wanted me to leave you alone, you couldn’t answer me, and I want to be your friend. Fuck it, I said it. I want to be your stupid fucking friend. Because I think you’re funny sometimes and you are a good dancer and I don’t want to hate you anymore. It’s stupid. Our baggage is stupid.”
“Not so stupid as you act then, are you?” Draco said, almost brittle. “Okay Potter, friends, I guess.”
“Fair enough,” Harry says, taking down the last of the information. He’s impressed by how quickly Draco had compiled the suspect list, and the photos are a nice touch. “This a good place to start, hopefully one of these will pan out.”
Her next dance lesson with Draco, Harry arrived just as the stroke of eight. It had been exceptionally cold that day, and she was in a sweater Seamus had gotten from his aunt three Christmases prior but declared far too itchy to wear.
“Good,” she said, her voice menacing as she leaned in to smell him. “You smell normal, not like a lake.”
“What we wanted to tell you,” Harry begins, trying to drum up his auror training regarding hostage situations and talking down criminals. “Is that Draco and I- Well we-Have kind of-”
“Good,” Harry says, taking a shaky sip of wine. Draco looks at him strangely, a pale eyebrow arched up on his forehead, before he settled back into the couch and takes a gulp from his glass.
“It’s supposed to even out your skin tone,” Draco says, pulling a cream colored bottle from the bag. “It looks like this.”
“Those thorny unforgivables. At least you can usually tell,” Dara says, scrubbing her hands over her face. “Okay, let’s pay Rob a surprise visit tomorrow. Maybe we can startle him into giving something up, whatever that is.”
Someone, probably Blaise, wolf whistles, and Draco’s brain rematerializes as he figures out, after a few tense seconds of trial and error, how to stop kissing. He knows he’s bright red and that everyone is watching them, but he can’t take his eyes off Harry, who is looking at Draco with that same expression of intense concentration, like he’s working through a particularly difficult problem.
“It hurts,” Draco says after a while, in that same emotionless voice. “Seeing your memories hurts. I feel everything you feel. I didn’t know, I didn’t want to know.”
“Fine,” Draco says, looking quite perturbed. Harry has to admit that the Auror’s werewolf procedure of ‘find, assist, support’ seems a little stranger when it’s applied to his old schoolmate/enemy/accidental-gay-tabloid-scandal.
Draco sighed and rubbed at her chin, succeeding only in moving the bit of color around. Harry moved to help her, cleaning it off with the pad of her thumb.
Rob was interesting, something about the way that Jasmine had described him as “out of it” pinging his auror-senses. Harry had sent an owl asking to meet, claiming to be part of the potion regulations division of the Ministry, and was still waiting to hear back.
“I got a space print onesie secondhand a few years ago. It was boys XL but it definitely still fits,” another one adds, and Harry is more than a little jealous. Everyone is so lovely here, nice in a way that isn’t asking for anything in return. Harry’s lost Draco somewhere in the house but he feels welcome and he doesn’t completely mind.
Harry stood where Draco had left her, feeling very silly and very sorry for herself. She thought maybe she should vacate the dance floor, but Malfoy was cross with her again and quite a few people were watching her and so she thought the best course of action would be to stand there until she dissolved or the world swallowed her up.
Draco looks scandalized, and Harry tries to figure out how to disguise his laugh as a cough. Judging by Draco’s glare, he does a subpar job. “How bloody dare you.”
Draco runs his thumb over the healed cut and then takes Harry’s hands, turning them over and finding the series of long scratches left by a distressed baby dragon, long and angry down his wrist and all the way up his arm. He does another spell, the skin healing under his care.
Draco slides off of Harry, laying on his side and placing his very sticky hand directly on Harry’s stomach. Harry, his eyes closed and his breathing still ragged, opens an eye to level a look at Draco. “Is there a specific reason that I’m covered in come and you’re not? Or is this just how you are.”
“I remember when you were so proud,” the snake said, pulling its head back up to look him in the eye. “It used to get you into trouble.”
It wasn’t like they’d work anyway, not as lovers and probably not even as friends. Potter had the shortest fuse he’d ever seen and Draco didn’t know how to back down from anything. Even in the harlequin light of the forest Draco was just as close to screaming at Harry as he was to kissing him, and the light of day never made that any better.
Harry opens his eyes, meeting Draco’s gaze. He’s doing that thing again, looking at Harry like he’s going to eat him alive, and it’s so much, especially as Draco leans in to kiss him, as slow and gentle as the hand he’s sliding up and down Harry’s cock.
A smile flickers across Draco’s face. “The Slytherin Common room was my favourite, everyone would lay out on the floor and do their homework right before exams and the seventh years would bring everyone treats and help you if you needed.”
“I might literally be a genius,” Draco insists, and Harry lets it go when the frontwoman of the next band starts the set. They’re called Tin Girl Machine and they play songs that remind Harry of summer.
Draco sneaks his hands under Harry’s shirt, running his fingers across his stomach and over his chest. Harry is both muscular and soft, which hurts every one of Draco’s feelings and also makes him very hard. Harry moans a little when Draco pinches one of his nipples, and Draco is suddenly seized by the realization that they’re extremely making out in a hallway in a house that contains every single one of their friends. Draco removes his hands from under Harry’s shirt, which makes Harry whimper in a very appealing way that Draco is determined to not be distracted by. He takes Harry’s face in his hands, pressing their foreheads together and breathing hard out of his mouth.
Harry goes to take Draco’s cock in his hand and gasps when Draco intercepts his wrist. “I think we should focus on you first, hmm? I’d like to watch you come.”
He’d never thought of himself as overly good looking but Draco wanting to kiss him couldn’t be anything but aesthetic, nothing else made sense. Maybe Malfoy would have been into how fucked up it was, the feeling that they were doing something forbidden. Harry was, a little bit.
“Shut up,” Draco said, sounding like he was on the verge of hyperventilating as he pulled Harry through the edges of the forest and onto the lawn. They broke out of the forest and into the clean night, both of them still as real and solid and they’d been before.
Draco is looking at him curiously again, and Harry kicks himself for bringing the curious look back, when they’d been having such a nice time. “I didn’t mind.”
“This Yule Ball thing is not exactly making it easy to pass my classes,” Harry grumbled, fumbling through her papers as Parvati doodled something pretty on her paper. “Are you drawing?”
“Alright, we’ll do it the hard way,” Ginny turns to the room at large. Sometimes, Ginny is Draco’s favorite. “Who has kissed Ron. Fess up.”
“It’s true,” Harry said, smiling tentatively at him. Draco still looked chilled, small in the wintery air and Harry wanted to kiss him again to reassure himself that he wasn’t dreaming, to reassure himself that Draco wanted him like he’d said. “Do you mind if-” Harry trailed off, pulling a hand down his face and squinting at Draco. “I can’t believe you’re real and that you’re still standing here with me.”
Harry already knows he’s bad at this. He knows that if Draco tried he could open him up like overripe cantaloupe, that he could see everything. It’s such an overwhelming thought that it only manifests in a low hum of terror and doesn’t break through his composure.
“I’m back,” Draco said irritably, stepping into the clearing. He looked just as tired as he had at the beginning of the year, the circles under his eyes recarving themselves like they’d been waiting to creep back in.
Harry shakes his head. “Nothing that fancy, although they used to send me things from the wizarding world when I was stuck at my aunt and uncle’s.”
Draco sits up wide eyed, the violently-colored blanket crumpling around his torso. He looks terrified, and it’s such a disarming expression that it makes Harry want to throw the blanket back over his head. “
“Yeah,” Harry replies, then realizes that quidditch most certainly doesn’t count just as he receives an elbow to the side. “Just football mostly, I wasn’t that good,” he lies, drawing on his years of failed intramural sports as a kid.
“Depends on what it tells us, I suppose,” Draco says. “Jasmine is excited to meet you, so do try not to be quite as slovenly as usual.”
“And it looks like all limbs intact, nice!” Ron added, flipping her pencil in Harry’s direction. “Could you hand my pencil back?”
He felt his mind begin to drift after a few minutes, the day catching up to him as Harry read paragraphs about the inside of the ship in his quiet forest voice. He wasn’t aware of slipping off to sleep, only that when he was jerked back into consciousness, he was on the edge of the forest with his book in his hand, Harry already long gone.
“Oh,” Harry says, faintly recognizing the bottle. He keeps finding his gaze pulled back to Draco’s lips, where the red makes his cupid bow even sharper.
By the time they’re let into the apartment, Harry feels restless, hovering at Draco’s shoulder. It’s lovely and warm inside, the walls covered in art and posters and christmas lights, and there’s a whole group of interesting looking people with messy hair who all kiss Draco on the cheek and give Harry welcoming handshakes and hugs. It’s overwhelming, because no one asks him for an autograph and no one wants a picture with him, and he feels horribly disoriented by all of it.
Draco didn’t turn to face him, pressing his fingers through the web until it broke, fine silvery strands drifting down to land on his cuffs.
“None of your business,” Draco replied, snatching the book from Harry’s hand on the last syllable. “Goodbye, Potter.”
“That’s not a real thing,” Harry says, thinking about that inevitability, how he knew that he would be partnered with Draco even before opening the letter. “It’s just because we fight well together.”
For a long moment, Harry just stares at him like he’s forgotten how to speak English. He has his mouth open again for no discernible reason, and it’s making it very hard for Draco to think straight. Draco realizes that he’s willing to do just about anything for this to continue, up to and including figuring out how to hold a conversation with Harry Potter. Wonders never cease.
Hermione gives Pansy a deeply unimpressed look. “Pansy’s asking who’s the best kisser and she says I can’t say Ron and you’re the only other person here I’ve kissed.”
The repair shop is lit up with buzzing fluorescent lights and it smells like all the garages Harry’s ever been in, the walls lined with old tvs and refrigerators. Arthur Weasley would love it in here, all the strange, dirty parts and outdated machines. Above the cracked linoleum countertop is a sign that reads “Greg’s Repairs” in bright red font, the paint a little chipped. Harry slides the record player onto the counter, giving the bell on the counter a little ding as he scuffs his shoes on the dirty tile.
“I’m hoping for a blue one this year, although that purple snitch one from last year was truly fantastic,” Harry says, thinking fondly of the chunky, scratchy, purple creation. He has to wear a button up underneath it, but it’s the warmest thing in his wardrobe.
“I need your help,” Harry said when Ron finally blinked his eyes open, shushing him when he started to protest and pointing at the huge marks on his neck.
“The people need to know, Ron,” Ginny says, which Draco is loving from her. Draco’s favorite thing is when the Gryffindors turn on each other, which they’ll do for a laugh at even the slightest provocation.
“Can I ask what made you draw that conclusion?” they ask, calmly enough that Harry can almost convince himself it’s not any weirder than talking about the weather or their most recent Quibbler articles.
“I’ll tell him you think so,” Harry says, writing it importantly in his notebook as Draco comes out holding a case of bottles and a funnel.
Ginny has crossed the carpet and is kneeling in front of Harry. She takes his face in her hands. “Harry James, you have to tell me which of my brothers you’ve kissed. Is it Percy? Please tell me it’s not Percy.”
Harry is looking at him like he’s amusing again. “Do you think we could have the heart to heart after I make you come?” he asks, in a pretty piss poor imitation of Draco’s clipped drawl.
It moved not with a drift but with a slow pulsing rhythm that reminded Harry of breathing, all soft and delicate. The old oak forests he was used to gave way to towering evergreens and birches with loose strips of elegant white bark, the path turning to a carpet of moss that looked quite close to velvet. He was almost positive that if he reached down to touch it, it would be.
“You look disheveled,” Luna says, following his line of sight and getting a pot out for him. “Spaghetti and meatballs?”
“I’m not daydreaming about my secret lover, if that’s what you’re insinuating,” Harry quipped, reaching out to tap on her sleeve so she’d know he wasn’t really mad.
Harry was observing the proceedings, unsure why exactly Ron had decided to wrap her sister up like a sparkly black mummy but willing to let it happen, when the door creaked open.
Harry thought about saying that he’d missed him, but he didn’t think that would go over very well at all, so he just settled on nodding.
“You haven’t bought your tie yet, have you?” Harry asked Anthony during breakfast, pausing at the Ravenclaw table on the way over to her own.
“You haven’t exactly extended the hand of friendship,” Draco says. “You’re a hypocrite, Potter.” The sharp consonants of his surname reminds Harry too clearly of the moment of weakness when Draco had spoken his first name in soft exasperation. He wishes he didn’t remember, he doesn’t like how those thoughts connect.
They finish the bottle of wine and Harry realizes as he sends Draco back through the Floo, that once the case is over, they aren’t going to have any excuse to do this anymore. He thinks, with a fair bit of surprise, that he might even be a little bit sad about it.
“I’ve been around, you’re the one who dropped off the face of the Earth,” Harry replies, the truth in Malfoy’s words ringing in his ears. There’s an eerie undertone to all of it, an implication that Malfoy knows that there’s more to him than that.
Hermione frowns, tapping her foot against the wood floor while she considers her answer. “I don’t really understand what you mean, Harry.”
“You gonna tell me who it is?” Ron asked, pouring more of the liquid on the cotton ball and swabbing at Harry’s throat.
Draco is holding it together by some minor miracle until Harry strokes him just a little bit faster, and he comes across Harry’s chest. Still gasping, he kisses Harry’s neck again, teasing a moan from his mouth as he slides his hand over Harry’s cock. Harry is pliant and trembling, and when Draco twists his wrist he stills with a moan, coming into Draco’s hand.
“I’m sure I won’t be able to guess,” Harry says weakly, carrying the newspapers over to the recycling pile.
Harry didn’t stir, and Draco reached out tentatively to touch him, his hand hovering at Harry’s shoulder before settling on his hand. Draco took it, twining his fingers through Harry’s and wiggling them slightly.
“Just smart,” Draco replies, and Harry can’t tell how serious he’s being. “I tried to be friends with you and you’re only a half blood. Pureblood culture is just as much about power as bloodlines.”
He walked through the winding paths just for something to do with himself, listening as the trees swayed and odd bird calls drifted from their branches. He smelled the soft warmth of Spring in the air but couldn’t understand what any of it meant. He worried that maybe the forest wasn’t trying to tell him anything at all, that this was some strange dream that he should have woken up from by now. Then again, if it was a dream, he should at least be able to kiss someone pretty again.
Harry looks over at the clock, then looks away when he sees how early it is. “I really don’t have any other choices.”
“You are,” Harry said, watching the way he moved, all nerves and sharp angles. “Why do you think we’re here then?”
The boy blushed maroon and Harry let go of his shoulder, brushing away from him and off to class, not bothering to consider the larger implications of what he had done. Maybe it was his stupid hero complex, but it felt wrong for the whole school to bully them, even with their history. Harry didn’t have much fondness for bullies, not after his childhood.
It was beautiful, all the happiness they’d managed to find again, so much she could barely hold it anymore. She didn’t think she was going to cry but it was a similar feeling, like love or want, something base and wild that threatened to carry her under. It wouldn’t, but she wanted to wade into it, sit on the window and feel it for just a moment.
Dara sighs and looks up at the ceiling. Harry looks up at it too and sees that it’s boring and white, just like the rest of the room. “You know, I’m only saying this because we’re probably going to get Obliviated and forget this ever happened, but it wouldn’t kill you to actually let yourself have something you want for a change. I’ve watched you sidestep more romantic prospects than anyone, and it’s like you don’t even know you’re doing it. I used to think it was because you were still in love with Ginny, then I thought maybe you were ace or aro or something, but I don’t think that’s it. I don’t get it, dude.”
“Okay,” Harry replied, and the branches sagged back out, the air lightening around them as the whole forest grew dark, the phosphorescent leaves blinking out one by one until they were left in clean darkness.
“Excellent,” Draco replies, bringing a foot up onto the counter and tucking his chin onto his knee. “I’ll meet Ronald then.” He says the name like some strange animal he isn’t planning on touching.
“I thrifted this enormous cardigan last winter, it’s black and goes down to my feet, it’s honestly the warmest thing I own,” one of the girls says reverently.
“Hey! Not you too!” Ginny says to Luna, who smiles serenely. “No one else I’ve dated is allowed to kiss my brothers. New rule.” Ginny whips out her wand, pressing it to Harry’s throat, which Draco is dismayed to realize he also finds rather hot. “Fess up, Potter.” Draco is disconcerted by how much of this reminds him of how he has historically treated Harry.
“What are you up to?” He mused, unsurprised when the mist breathed out towards him instead of gracing him with an answer.
“Mum started in on the Christmas jumpers yesterday,” Ron begins, and Harry is grateful that they’re finally talking about something he can smile about without it feeling like a lie.
Harry sits down on the edge of the bed, running his hand through his sleep rumpled hair. “Wake up. Draco. Wake up.”
Harry starts heating the griddle back up, the silence hanging in the air. It’s farther from awkwardness and closer to newness, like they’re still figuring each other out. This feels like the oldest slow burn and yet they’ve barely been kissing for two weeks, throwing themselves into each other like bottle rockets or runaway stars.
Just before morning light, the forest pried them from each other with sad arms and regretful breaths, because she knew if she let them wake tangled, they would be impossible to rend.
There’s an awkward few minutes of whinging and complaining as Draco positions Ron’s fingers where they belong, before Draco casts a clean
Draco blinks at him slowly. He’s all cool colors and nothing like warmth. Harry wonders if he’s always been like that, if that’s the only way he can be. “Poetic justice.”
“I’ve got it,” Harry says, then hurries to get his explanation out. “Malfoy’s helping me with a case, I had to bribe him here.”
“No. Put a shirt on,” Draco says, and sits in the dining room chair as if he’s afraid it will bite him. “I am freaking out. Why aren’t you freaking out?”
Harry laughs, his eyes finding the pale skin of Draco’s cheek, slightly pink with what might be a blush. Harry can’t remember if his skin is always that color or if it's usually more washed out. He thinks Draco was pinker when he was younger, sallow when it all fell apart, and pink again in the aftermath. Harry doesn’t think too hard, he just wants, and then he reaches out to pause Draco’s chin, leaning in to press a lip print against his cheek. It shows up bright red and only slightly smudged against the darkening hue of Draco’s face.
“Really looked like he suffered through every moment,” Lee says, drawing up the check with a muttered spell and a wave of his wand. “Cheers lads, thanks for coming in. Harry, see you soon, be sure to bring your frenchy boyfriend back. Against all odds I’ve decided I like him.”
“Sounds like a git,” Draco said, though as someone who had once stomped Harry’s nose in, he wasn’t sure he was in a place to comment.
Harry finds himself stifling a laugh at the juvenile looking row of cubbies holding Draco’s expensive looking cloak.
“So I see,” Draco replies, looking like he’s trying very hard to tamp down his smile as he takes them, giving them a smell. “Lilac, Phlox, and red Rose? How romantic.”
“Fine, whatever,” Harry says, raising his wand. He has a feeling that maybe he can do this, even though in his lessons with Snape he’d never been allowed to try.
Draco glances over at Ron, who looks like he’s having a bit of an episode about the whole thing. Draco doesn’t like being on the same emotional level as Ron Weasley, but he’s concerned that this is just what the situation calls for.
Draco wants to know what the flames look like. He wants to know if the fake is believable. Harry could have told him that it was, but he wanted to see for himself.
Harry remembered how he’d died, screaming curses and not listening even when Draco had told him to stop. It was odd, to hear his name in her mouth so carefully, like she was afraid of sullying it.
“Nice,” Harry says. A compliment turns over in his throat, something he doesn’t quite know how to say. Draco had always been at the top of their class, a prefect, always just under Hermione, but Harry doesn’t think he really understood what that would mean until that moment, watching Draco sit across from him, looking pleased with himself.
charm earlier. Outside, the rain has picked up to a steady drizzle, and Harry registers that it almost doesn’t feel like time exists at all. “If you answer all my questions, we can go home sooner rather than later.”
Harry pushes his front door open with his hip, dropping grocery bags onto the floor with a series of dull thumps. He pauses, hands around a milk carton, noticing the sound of the tv coming from the living room.
“Lovely,” Draco murmured, running his hands across Harry’s chest, his thumbs running over Harry’s nipples. The smallest of smiles alit on his lips when Harry squirmed  and pressed up into the drag of his fingers, his hips jerking upward involuntarily “So lovely.”
“I think I just made friends with Gregory Goyle,” Hermione said, her forehead creased. “I think that he’s nice, when did he get nice?”
Go figure that Draco would even smell expensive. Harry was fairly sure she smelled like the apples in her shampoo.
Draco has arrived at Harry’s doorstep in a pair of dress robes with emerald piping with his hair slicked back like he used to wear it at school, a strand curling down artfully in front of his face. Harry, kindly, doesn’t tell him like he looks like a prat, as pissing Draco off is not what he needs to do right now and because he definitely still wants to kiss him so it doesn’t really count.
“See, you are a sad boy,” Ellen replies, and Harry can’t tell if she knows who he is or not. He suspects that Ellen is Draco’s squib friend, but calling him a sad boy doesn’t mean she knows he defeated the dark lord and he doesn’t know how to address that.
Harry does, peering into the tiny glass at the way his eyelids glisten gold and the red makes his lips look even fuller. “Oh.” Harry sets the mirror down, kissing the back of his hand and grinning when it leaves a lip print. “I was wondering if that would work.”
5. Seventeen snitches in Hogwarts history have flown into the Forbidden Forest instead of staying on the playing field.
“I always have to be Malfoy,” he said, mentally cursing his breathlessness. He knew Malfoys didn’t kiss boys, but he knew that Malfoys didn’t kill themselves either, didn’t go crazy and ruin everything. Malfoys didn’t choose the wrong side and they weren’t scared, but it was all he had.
“I chose toast!” Harry protests, gesturing weakly to the magical toaster, which, at his summons, cheerfully produces two pieces of perfect toast with a jingle.
Harry nods, willing himself not to think it’s a date. It’s very obviously a business meeting, the actual opposite of a date, but his brain keeps going ‘date?’ without his permission. Sitting across from Draco now, he feels a little foolish for being so terrified to bring him here, like he’d expected Draco to snap and start dramatically performing the time Harry fell from his broomstick third year.
Harry’s mop of hair is at Draco’s touch height, and he finds himself with his hands buried in Harry’s curls. Harry lets his eyes go a little closed as Draco plays with his hair, a far too familiar gesture for the amount of time they’ve been making out, which is about fifteen minutes total.
6. “Blood runs thicker than water,” Harry said, when Draco sat down on the bench in the middle of the night. He had on a face that wasn’t his. His clothes fit him the same way they had in the store: unsure and rumpled even when they were his size. Harry hadn’t remembered his clothes always fitting this way, but that was how they fit him then.
The tables were crowded when they walked in, but Draco’s eyes still found the top of Harry’s head immediately. His hair was just as mussed as it had been when Draco had left him the night before, and while he felt the expected wave of irritation, it was accompanied by the intense sensory memory of the way his hair felt soft under his hands.
He can sense as Draco gets his bearings, as he slows down and wallows. Harry watches, feels himself sneak out of the cabinet under the stairs. The rest is far from complete. Its a floor cold on his bare feet. It is the familiar ghost of hunger. It’s the reach for shrinking that never goes away. It’s the itch of old clothes. He wonders if Draco knows that sensation, and notices a small curl of confusion.
Harry tries to remember why he thought they were compatible, why he thought they were going to work. He believed it, for a few moments, when he got that letter he thought there was hope for them but he’s still not sure why. It felt inevitable, it still might, he’s just lost the thread. “It’s not like you’re going to tell me anything about yourself. You’ve made that very clear. We’re supposed to be on the same team now and you’re still treating me like an enemy.”
“Last time was a bit different than this time,” Harry said, reaching over to hold onto Draco’s wrist in apology. She did it slowly so Draco could pull back if she wanted to.
“It’s really hard, because you have to get the plate back on and stretch the band over the pin,” Draco says. “Hold it like this, you try.”
“I’d be surprised if he lasted through appetizers,” Harry affirms. Draco gathers up their newspapers, a smile making his face terribly soft.
“You didn’t wake me up and move me,” Draco replies, turning back over just to give Harry a peeved look. “It looks better on me anyway.”
“Great,” Draco says, sighing deep and starting towards the car. He comes around the passenger side and opens the door, motioning for Harry to take the back seat. “Ellen, this is Harry, it’s cool if he comes, right?”
They both pause, Draco sending a curse back his way, then a hex, then a quick volley of jinxes, which Harry blocks, sending back as good as he gets. He doesn’t get to do this often enough, fight with someone who fights so clean, so crisp, whose spells almost never miss and who lashes back with as much strength as Harry gives.
Sometimes Harry worries that it was less the love potion and more of an excuse to not feel ashamed, just once.
Harry nodded back, watching as he picked up his cloak and walked swiftly out of the clearing, the woods filling in behind him until there was nothing left of him but the barely lingering smell of herbs and the remnant crackle of his magic.
Draco pulls Harry back in with a guiding hand on his jaw, much more gently this time, their mouths soft when they meet. How Harry is so warm, Draco will never never know. Harry’s stubble is rough against Draco’s palm but his hair, when Draco slides a hand into it, is silky. He can’t even bring himself to be truly offended that it’s silky, because he’s touching it, and Harry is kissing Draco back. They both have their eyes open, which Draco had thought would be better somehow, but is so, so much worse. Harry’s eyes are a deep, vibrant green, and he looks like he’s concentrating very hard on the kissing, which makes Draco want to crawl on top of him and sexually destroy him.
That night, he returned the forest with shaking fingers and nerves sprouting heavy in his heart. He was never good at compartmentalizing but he’d tried his best. He shoved the forest memories into the pit in his stomach until the moment he left the castle and walked out into the chilly night air.
“You called us down here so you could announce that you’re friends now?” Hermione asks, raising her eyebrows. “I think an owl or text could have done, truly.”
All of Harry’s words feel inadequate, so he just scoots closer to Draco on the brick wall so their shoulders are touching, hoping that’s close enough to comfort. Draco jerks at the touch, looking over at Harry in surprise, before facing forward again, resting back against Harry’s shoulder.
“The red one’s nice,” Harry says, feeling the odd weight of the shimmer against his eyelids. He wonders if he looks pretty, if the shine is as striking on him as it is on Draco.
The girl brightens up. “Can you tell me what all of my flowers mean?” She holds her hands out expectantly, and Draco laughs, startling Harry, who can’t remember that sound ever being genuine.
“We go to the same school,” Draco snipped back as she slipped an arm around Harry. “But yeah,” she amended, in her soft voice. “I’ll see you.”
As it turned out, quite nearly the whole school did know by lunchtime, except for Draco, who didn’t know anything for sure, because he’d been too anxious to leave his room until five minutes before his first class of the morning.
“Pansy has been pestering me about a ministry position for years,” Draco confirms. “I think she’s used the words ‘real job’ about twenty times. Like anyone there would respect me, I’d be doing menial bullshit until I fucking died.”
66. Harry turns his handkerchief bright red and lays it on his pillow. He doesn’t want to touch it or let it out of his sight. Harry doesn’t know what’s gone wrong and there’s no one left to ask.
Draco considers protesting, but decides that he’d rather just remove his own clothing and get Harry naked faster. “Fine,” Draco says, pulling his cashmere sweater over his head. He resists the urge to fold it, because he knows Harry would tease him mercilessly, and instead gently lowers it off the side of the bed before undoing his button up. Harry is watching him hungrily, like he’s doing something very hot and minorly amusing. Draco has the suspicion that Harry has somehow clocked that he would like terribly to be folding his clothing as he removes it.
“I appreciate your faith in me,” Harry replied, sitting down on one of the desks pushed against the wall as Draco sketched out feet and arrows designed to show her where to dance.
“Oh you can come off it,” Dara says. “I know you’re sleeping together, you don’t have to give me that bullshit.”
“You said twenty-four other suppliers, correct?” Draco asks, returning the bottles to the box he’d carried them out in, now filled with potion. “I made thirty test jars, just in case. The potion takes a day or two to brew, so let me know sooner rather than later if you need any more. I’ve included usage instructions in the box for each individual supplier, but send any questions they have my way.”
She pursed her lips and he wished he could read her better. She wasn’t trying to punch him, which he would have deserved after everything. If he believed that the forest was conjuring people up for him to reconcile with, she wouldn’t have been a surprise.
“It wasn’t a compliment,” Draco says nastily, but Harry feels sure that he’s in on the joke. “Oh and Harry, you have something on your neck.” He slides out the door with a twiddle of his fingers.
“If I tell you you’re being absolutely ridiculous will it fall on deaf ears?” Hermione asked tiredly, still doing homework even as she talked.
24. One night, when Harry watched Ginny shoot cans from his bedroom window, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to Draco, that killing is never as easy as the innocent believe. He didn’t remember at which point they stopped being innocent. He thought he’d been grieving it since before he knew it was gone.
“Slytherins don’t leave their own behind,” Draco said, looking a bit more intense than the situation called for.
2. They went around in circles for days about Draco’s note. Harry spent a weekend slipping out of rooms when one of them started in on it until they cornered him in Grimmauld’s kitchen after breakfast, the dishes still dirty in the sink. Neville wouldn’t look him in the eye as he stood with his arms tightly crossed, Luna sitting blithely on the counter and Ginny in the doorway like she knew she was blocking his exit and was doing it just to force his hand, possibly for nothing more than her own entertainment.
“Should we do it now?” He’s not sure either of them are up for a fight, but maybe that’s the point. Draco looks almost excited, despite how exhausted he’d looked earlier.
“Think I could recognize you just by your eyes?” Draco replies, waiting as a girl lifts a record player onto the counter.
“I just wanted to say goodbye,” Harry said, forcing himself to look at Draco’s face, forcing himself to know it wasn’t really him.
“Of course,” Harry replies, finding himself lingering. He doesn’t know why he does this, why leaving Draco is always so difficult.
“Those were pity dates! Paavan only went with me because he was too chicken to ask anyone else,” Ron replied, then went a little red at the realization that she, too, had been too chicken to ask anyone else. “Regardless, I don’t want to dance with some slimy Slytherin just to make the big MG happy.”
“This is a good place to hide,” Harry says quietly, and he hopes Malfoy understands the implications of that statement. Some part of him wants permission to hide here too.
“It’s different,” Harry protests. “People just want to sleep with me because I’m famous. And they usually just yell, they aren’t like, I don’t know, nice and stuff?”
Harry was thinking that he knows what Draco smells like, that this will be something he will always know.
Harry tried to stifle a laugh, wondering what the best method for peeling Draco off of her would be. “Are you sure you don’t think I’m funny?”
“This is really strange,” Harry said, looking down at his quickly soaking pajamas and Draco’s wet face. He laughed a little to himself and took a bite of the peach, hoping it wouldn’t kill him. “Curiouser and curiouser.”
Harry didn’t know what happened to the clothes he went to battle in. He couldn’t really remember how he’d felt, only the scratch of a tag on the back of his neck, his blue t-shirt dark with sweat and dirt, a stain that covered the entire left sleeve that must have been blood.
Harry gaped at her, the frustrated tears gathering at the edges of her eyes and the defiant set of her shoulders and tried to fumble around for words. “You really want me to leave you alone?”
“Something like that,” Harry replies, feeling sheepish. He doesn’t know why he always ends up spilling so much, why he keeps giving and giving in the hopes that Draco will give him something back.
“I was wondering if you’d get here,” Draco said primly, as if he didn’t look like something out of the strangest erotic magazine Harry had ever seen.
“Nice to meet you Harry,” Ellen says, sneaking a glance at him in the rearview mirror before she jerks the car into the drive. “I’m Ellen.”
He worried both that the forest would tear them apart and also that she wouldn’t, with a pounding fear that made his ears ring. He was mostly worried that they’d separate and have to look at each other again, and then pick up all the pieces. He thought instead of that, they could just kiss forever until they were part of the forest, until they became trees, strong and intertwined.
“We don’t have to do physical stuff if it’s weird for you,” Draco says slowly. “I don’t need that from you, I just want to be like-” He coughs like he’s looking for a noise to fill the space. “I would like to be close to you too. When you yelled at me this morning I was going to leave but I didn’t really want to. I feel very calm here. This whole place feels like you.”
Blaise looks entirely unconcerned. “What? He’s very hot. We all know that. We have always known that.”
65. There’s a small pocket of ash left in the street. Harry doesn’t pocket any of it, doesn’t run his fingers through it. He doesn’t want to believe it’s Draco and so he doesn’t. It’s not Draco, he’d told Harry so. Draco is supposed to appear on Harry’s doorstep, hours later and when he doesn’t, Harry goes out and gardens for hours like a somnambulist, pulling weeds until there are none left.
“Thanks,” Harry says, slurping from the tea Luna has poured and then making a face, both because it tastes strange and because he’s burned the feeling out of his tongue. “What even is this?”
Harry drapes the blanket over them and watches Draco for any indication other than his quiet acceptance of the blanket that he cares about Harry’s presence. The plates are priced at four thousand pounds and Draco frowns even though he’s much closer than Harry would have been.
Draco fussed briefly with the fly of Harry’s trousers before giving up and palming his cock through the fabric, his fingers desperate and sure as Harry lost the ability to kiss him and bent his head to rest it on Draco’s shoulder instead.
Harry bent down to get it and winged it at her. “All limbs intact. There was a bit of yelling but nothing out of the ordinary.” It only felt a little bit like a fib, with what Draco had said about leaving her alone hanging heavier in Harry’s memory. It wore at her a little, the idea that Draco really had been ignoring her, that Harry didn’t really know how to ignore her back. That maybe neither of them really wanted that.
He kept expecting his feelings to return, kept expecting to be interested in her again, or anyone, but during the worst of his sleepless periods he didn’t feel anything strongly. Even now, after he’d so abruptly begun to sleep again, any whisper of non-platonic feelings for her seemed impossible to drum up.
Harry wants to ask if he can watch, but he doesn’t, just walks over to the armchair and falls into it. There’s a duct tape patch on the arm and he picks at it as Malfoy scoops up the record player and brings it to the back. Harry still has so many questions, all inane and important and battering around in his skull.
“Some combination,” Draco says, as airily as he can while Harry wraps his lube-slick hand around Draco’s cock.
“Poisonous snake pit?” Draco offers, leading them up to the counter and ordering something fancy and complicated. Harry orders next, hoping that their drinks take ten years and that they never have to go over and greet the girls. Unfortunately, their coffee arrives in minutes, and they have to trudge guiltily over to the table Hermione and Pansy are sitting at, looking alarmingly chummy.
“Did you know that first year she challenged me to a duel, and when I went to duel her, in my pajamas, she had the audacity to blow me off? She didn’t even show up to our duel! Also, would you happen to have a Potter Stinks button lying around at the bottom of your trunk, made by Draco Malfoy herself?” Harry said pointedly. “I am not the one with the problem.”
The forest was being especially gentle with him, making the air sweet and hanging the trees heavy with peaches for him to eat. The forest felt badly about the way that Harry and Draco had fought, as she’d hoped that the feelings they both held simmering inside themselves would have made them kinder.
“I do feel terrible for Ernie, he looked like he was going to pee himself with fright when they were dancing,” Harry said, turning very deliberately away from the Slytherins.
“I thought we both liked teal?” Anthony asked, squinting at her like she was speaking nonsense. In his favor, his coffee was fairly full and he had bags under his eyes.
“No problem, Potter. I love charity work,” Draco replied with his most winning smile before turning back to Pansy, who was raising her eyebrows at him.
“What do you mean am I sure? Of course I’m sure,” Draco says, like he knows what Harry’s trying to figure out how to ask and is offended that he’s even thought such a thing. “It’s certainly been tampered with. I’ve never made an imperfect potion.” He takes another imperious bite of crepe, and then concedes to Harry’s counter-argument, which is just to give Draco a dubious look until he caves. “Alright, well I really have never made an imperfect potion, but even if I had, this one would still have been tampered with. Whoever did it altered it in such a way that it looked, smelled, and behaved just like the real thing. That’s no accident. Faulty ingredients create faulty potions, only sabotage would be so undetectable.”
“Hello! Ministry business, please open up!” Dara calls, giving the door another authoritative series of knocks.
“Well then what’s the problem?” Harry snarled, prodding his wand towards Draco’s chest, wishing it would be over, that he could go back to bed and sleep and be okay again. That he could undo completely, stay here with the mirage and let that be the only thing left. “I’m sorry I even tried to say goodbye,” he said, turning on his heel to leave.
Draco feels a little lightheaded, but overall very appeased. It’s absolutely bonkers that he’s had sex with Blaise Zabini and that wasn’t the sexiest thing that’s ever happened to him. What a day. What a world. “This is the sexiest thing that’s ever happened to me,” Draco says, as if he’s commenting on the weather, and it makes Harry laugh, which has pretty much become Draco’s entire mission.
and he smiled, letting the snake curl around his wrist like a bracelet. He left it wrapped there as he made slow, steady progress through the forest, then made slow steady progress out of the forest and back up to bed, the serpent slipping from his wrist and back into the underbrush in a moment of distraction.
Draco’s breath echoed loud in his ears, his skin warm and growing tacky with sweat, real and solid and overwhelming. Lovely, Draco had said, with a casual sort of approval that drew a moan from Harry’s lips even in memory.
“Is there a possibility that I can stay up here forever instead of going downstairs and having the most awkward confrontation imaginable?” Draco asks, when what he’s really asking is if he can stay the night. He knows if he stays the night he’s going to be in love with Harry forever, but he’s very concerned that at some point that has already happened. Draco doesn’t think that Harry is in love with him yet, but he thinks they’ve made astoundingly good progress for one night.
Draco can’t imagine what Harry wants, but he suspects that he’s about to find out. Perhaps, Draco thinks with significant interest, he would like to kiss again. It’s possible that Harry would like to have a good ‘ol punch around for old times sake, which Draco has to admit he might find a bit hot as well, considering the circumstances. Draco absolutely can not believe this is actually happening. He doesn’t know if he’s overjoyed or needs a lobotomy. It’s that kind of crush.
“Haven’t gone over that in class yet,” Harry said, smiling because it felt like the right thing to do.
“Do you do this a lot?” Harry asks, coming up a bit closer, glancing down at the towel he’d brought in to hang up, having almost forgotten about it. The rack is close to the sink that Draco is standing at, and he tries to be inconspicuous as he drapes it over the peg.
It seemed, unfortunately, that they were immune to spellwork, and remained blotchy, purple and enormous on the skin on his neck. He traced the outline where Draco’s teeth had been, the memory of his eyes as he’d leaned in sharp in Harry’s brain. He thought that real Draco would be amused by this at least, to know that Harry would have to spend the entire day fussing with his scarf to keep them covered. Draco would probably laugh at him, which was stupid, since he was sleeping with someone and Draco wasn’t. It didn’t really matter, because Harry wasn’t actually sleeping with anyone.
“Elbow up. It’s sagging. Again,” Draco criticized, her frustration apparently overriding her desire to freeze Harry out with silence.
They’re quiet for a long moment, Draco singing along to ABBA quietly like Harry won’t notice if its not that loud, before he turns, affixing Harry with a strange look. “You’re aware that you aren’t actually under qualified, right?”
“Not sick,” he replied, taking a long sip of his tea. He didn’t think he could stomach food, there wasn’t much room in there around all the nerves.
“Congratulations, Neville,” Hermione adds, as Luna shoots a bunch of rainbow glitter out of their wand onto the carpet.
“You will be partnered up on the basis of house and respective height,” McGonagall said, swishing to the front of the room. “If you could please line up by height, girls on the left wall, boys on the right. Any gender nonconforming students may pick whichever line they feel most comfortable in.”
“Please,” Harry says, and exhales as Draco finally lets him go, leading him back into the austere little apartment to put the kettle on for tea.
Harry didn’t see Draco until group dance lessons with McGonagall on Monday, leaving her plenty of time to wonder just how much of their encounter at the victory party Draco remembered. Harry thought about straight up asking her, but information on Draco Malfoy’s favorite color wasn’t something to bandy about willy nilly.
“Yours?” Harry asks, searching Draco’s pale skin for scars he might have overlooked. He finds none on the skin he can see.
“Close your eyes,” Draco says, unscrewing the top to a gold pot and shifting closer to Harry. “I’m going to put this on your eyelids, its called eyeshadow.”
Draco looked down at the flowers, a grouping of three, six-petaled white and yellow blooms that Harry didn’t recognize. For a moment, Harry thought Draco might not respond. Draco took a deep breath, pushing out a response with a careful kind of nonchalance. “When he died all that was left was a bunch of scar tissue. It was ugly, so I covered it with something new. For me.”
“I’ve been studying the effects of solar energy on society at large. There’s a clear correlation between appearances of the northern lights and change, it’s all very interesting.” Luna tells him. An authority has started to seep into her speech and Harry feels quietly proud of her and her absurdity.
It wasn’t until he stumbled upon the source of the strongest smell that he was hit by why it all seemed so vaguely familiar. The thick heady scent of roses like the ones he used to wander through in the twilight back when the Manor was theirs. A winter day so cold it made his nose pink and numb, snow sparkling bright on the eaves. The sort of spice that made boys smell like boys, something sharp but so warm. Lake water. Lakes deeper and stranger than Draco knew, lakes filled with webbed plants, bug eyed fish, and unknown things.
Harry doesn’t answer for a long moment. “Didn’t really manage, but I had a lot of people who cared for me. Molly, mostly. She’s been like my mum.”
“It’s the only thing I know how to do, honestly.” He looks over at the wall, his voice dropping so it can barely be heard over the metalwork Belinda is doing. “I was bad at being an Auror. I wasn’t used to making my own choices and it used to be make me so anxious. I used to like, I don’t know, shut down? Everything reminded me of Voldemort and of dying. I hated that I couldn’t do it, but I just couldn’t.”
“Decaf for you, Harry?” Lee asks, leaning a lazy elbow on the back edge of Draco’s booth, the coffee pot in his hands. He has his dreads pulled back with a moon and stars handkerchief that Harry hasn’t seen before.
“I got off easy, it wasn’t about liking it,” Draco says with a shrug, rubbing his hand over the place where the Mark is, almost like he doesn’t realize he’s doing it. “But yeah, it was okay.” He goes quiet for a moment and Harry doesn’t interrupt his silence. “It was actually really nice being around muggles because the whole wizarding world hated me.”
“We, um,” Hermione fiddled with the strap on her bag, looking a bit nervous. “Luna and some of their friends are having a Knitting Club in the Ravenclaw Common Room Thursdays at eight. If you like knitting. I’m sure they’d love to have you.”
The kettle whistles in the background and Harry pulls back, blinking and flushed. Draco doesn’t let him go, just holds tight and blinks back, mouth half open, palms damp.
Harry lets them squabble, feeling much lighter than before. He’s kissing Draco and nothing in his life has fallen apart, and that’s better than he could have imagined. It’s far from perfect, he hasn’t even seen where Draco lives and Pansy still scares the life out of him, but he wants this to be something, wants to put time and heart into it so it works.
Harry, for his part, was having similar lake problems. He couldn’t imagine why he smelled the lake everywhere. It wasn’t like he’d gone in, and when he mentioned something to Luna, she’d cocked her head at him and asked if he was feeling alright. Luna assuming that he was hallucinating was probably the most worrying part of the whole debacle.
“You look tired, I don’t know, you haven’t been-” Haven’t been looking at me across the Great Hall. “I just wanted to be nice, alright?” Harry looked resolutely back down at the grass, feeling a bit stupid. He’d never actually tried being nice to Draco in real life, and realized belatedly that he had no idea how it would actually go. Draco had extended an offer of friendship first, but that had been years ago, years full of taunting and fighting.
“Harry, look at me,” Draco said, insistent and pressing his forehead hard against Harry’s. His words were staccato and undercut with a boiling hurt that Harry knew too well in his voice, too well not to try and kiss away. “Do you want me?”
“About forty pounds, including the cost of the belt,” Malfoy says. “You can leave and come back, it’ll take twenty minutes at the most.”
“You look even worse than yesterday,” they say plainly, hovering a photo from one piece of paper to another.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry says, and it’s comforting, but it’s also a truth. Voldemort is gone but the scars aren’t. His hands tremble some mornings and he can’t always shake the feeling that he’s being followed, that Voldemort is going to come back even though he saw his body fall.
“Where did you learn?” Harry pressed, and Draco grit her teeth, her attitude finally wearing through her silence.
The castle was the first one to give him a quiet push towards the forest, because it knew that he was thorny and tangled inside. The castle, on one night in early November, opened the doors of the Great Hall wide, pushing Draco Malfoy out into the night so he could hear the soft humming of the forest.
“A little,” Ron said. “Hermione’s out of her mind about it, keeps bugging me to ask you. But I figured if you wanted to tell me you would.”
“You’re going to mess up my lipstick,” she murmured against Harry’s mouth, but didn’t pull away, just held her closer, leaning forward and kissing her with a focused intensity.
“Back again,” Malfoy says, leaning on the counter with an unreadable expression. Harry thinks he used to be better at reading Malfoy’s emotions, all his petulance and scheming so obvious, and wonders if maybe Malfoy’s gotten better at hiding them. He has a worrying suspicion he was never as good at figuring him out as he thought.
“You can’t tell anyone,” she said, her voice dropping to a whisper that Harry almost couldn’t hear over the music.
“She has a no-contact sentence,” he says, a cold kind of diplomacy in his tone, like he’s tamping down some large and unwieldy feeling. “I’m surprised she’s lasted so long, it should be a death sentence.”
“I’m glad to hear it,” McGonagall said, making it sound distinctly like a warning as she went to check on other couples.
“Alright Hermione, only because you’re my very favorite genius friend, I’ll go do more research,” Harry says.
Harry feels a rush of frustration, begins counting down the days in his head. They only have a month, less than now. He’s already wondering what they’ll have to do if they can’t figure it out in time, if there’s enough backlog of the potion to keep everyone safe, if this is all part of some larger, more sinister plot. “Draco, we have to solve it.”
“Too wolfy even for you?” Harry teases, and Draco makes a performative little gagging noise which is so unexpected that Harry nearly chokes on his omelet.
“That’s just my face!” Hermione looks flabbergasted. “No one told me! You know I hate to be the last to know. I was the last to know when Ginny and Luna were fucking too.”
“Wrote it out in the snow with some fancy spell and then took her for a walk last night,” Ginny said, her hair blowing wild behind her. She was wearing half of her Quidditch gear and had her broom in one hand, her cheeks red with cold. “Too sappy for me, but they’ve been wandering around like lovesick puppies all morning so I guess it worked.”
“Spell I made up,” Draco said. “There’s a metal component they swallow that lives in the stomach. I cast a spell that activates it and then…” The smile wasn’t on Draco’s face but Harry knew what it would look like. A thin-lipped, cruel kind of levity. Harry hadn’t known what to make of him. “Did you like it?”
12. Harry and Draco met in odd places. They didn’t need to meet as much as they did. Harry had known this from the beginning and he had a feeling Draco knew, too. Maybe all their friends did. Maybe it had been obvious. They picked inauspicious wooded areas and sat on dry leaves or damp grass and Draco explained himself. He had a quieter voice than Harry remembered, careful with his words, snappish only about himself. Harry had wanted to tell him that he didn’t have to explain, but Harry liked to listen to him talk.
“Silly of them to believe such things,” Draco thinks, even though if he counts the veins in his wrists and the breaths he takes and the buttons as he does them up then maybe he won’t fall apart. “Can I ask you a very personal question?”
“They think they’re just superstitions,” Potter replies, and Draco counts the freckles on the bridge of his nose. Draco didn’t know he had freckles there. “Might as well be for the amount of good it did me.”
“I was jealous of you and I wanted what you had,” Draco says, his tone even and his grip tight. Harry feels like he’s stepped abruptly into a very cold puddle or a rainstorm and doesn’t know how to get out, his chest compressing as Draco stares at him. There’s some of his old dignified tendencies and pride in it and Harry is crumbling in the heat. “I also wanted you. And now I have you, and I feel like I’m going to lose you. That me being me is going to drive you away and that’s why its so hard for me to believe that you’d want me in your real life.”
“I know,” Draco responds, and he’s trying to be nice. He’s trying not to evaporate. He’s trying not to notice the way Potter smells. He’s failing.
Harry has been invited for low tea. Harry has been taken to Diagon Alley and fitted in a pair of nice dress robes because he literally doesn’t own anything that passes Draco’s inspection.
“Hey,” Harry says, the screen door smacking shut behind him. Draco doesn’t say anything and doesn’t turn around, but he doesn’t move away when Harry sidles up next to him. “Thanks for rescuing me.” Everything Harry says seems to make the frown lines on Draco’s face even worse. “It was brave of you.”
Harry prodded the bruises on his neck in the bright morning light of the bathroom, his feet cold on the tiles and a terrified twisting in his stomach. He’d tried to spell them off, even resorting to stealthily sorting through the skeevy magazines under Seamus’ bed in hopes that he’d be able to find something to help.
Harry winces at the crick in his neck, grimacing as he reaches up to rub at his face and his shoulder makes an unpleasant popping noise. He’s wandless, sore, disoriented, and sitting across the room from Dara, who has her back against the wall and her elbows resting on her knees.
“I want to suck you off, but I’m not doing it in a hallway. You have a bed here. Where is it,” Draco asks. He can’t believe he’s saying any of this, but here he is, being brave again.
“Is she going to come to the ball?” Harry asked. “I heard that everyone from our year who wants to can come back.”
Did you like that? I think its funny. Do you think I’m funny? I always did, but public opinion was rather fickle. No one seemed to think my dementor impression was funny, and honestly I’m not sure that one was in good taste. I don’t regret it, but it’s a bit sour considering the current circumstances.
“Well I was thinking, maybe, since we’re in different houses and it would still be inter house unity, I could switch partners? Just to help out? Maybe?” Harry offered, forcing herself to power through despite attracting the attention of most of the room as well as McGonagall’s piercing stare.
“Well now you’ve asked for it and you’ll see how you like it.” Harry wasn’t prepared for Draco to whirl around and close the distance between them, dropping to his knees in front of Harry and crashing into him with a kiss that sent Harry falling backwards. Draco grabbed a fistful of his hair to keep Harry from ending up on his back, their limbs hitting awkwardly against each other. Harry swam through the confusion into an abrupt state of wakefulness, realizing that whichever Draco this was, under all his layers, was a desire to kiss Harry.
“You’re so deliberately difficult sometimes. I feel like every single night I have to figure you out again.” Harry said, a wry grin twisting across his face. Draco in hiding, Draco hidden under layers of pretense and trying so, so hard. “What’s actually you?”
“Why not?” Harry asked. He looked into Draco’s eyes every time he got the chance and didn’t like what he saw there, sometimes. It didn’t keep him from looking. Dumbledore’s words floated back to him:
“How stupid?” Ron asked, flipping the magazine shut and scooting over so Harry had more room on the bed. “Fighting a troll at eleven years old stupid or bought my mum the wrong Christmas gift stupid?”
“You have to go,” she told him sternly as he sat next to her on the floor of her bedroom while she calmed down. “Don’t let Blaise convince them he’s the only charming one.”
“Apparently its a pretty popular art movement in the muggle world,” Hermione said, letting a long strand of bright blue yarn brush against her hand. “I don’t know anything about it, though my parents were never that into art either.”
The desire to visit Draco at the store flits idly through his head even though he doesn’t think he’d be welcome. He wonders if Draco is even there today or if he’s off with his mother, planning all of the complicated ceremonial things that come after death.
Harry thought she might have been about to get the hang out of it when she heard a commotion from the corner that sounded like it had her name on it.
He tried to hold onto it, beyond their mouths and their bodies and felt it raw and clean under his fingers, wilder magic than he’d ever known, tangled and twisted and needy as soon as he felt it. It wanted to tow him in and eat him up and he felt his own magic tug back at it, try to touch and tame it and sink deep inside it all the same.
“Please don’t spread it around,” Harry said, lowering his hand with a sigh. “No one’s supposed to know.”
22. “I can’t believe he did it,” Ginny said, hard mouthed with Harry in the garden, planting. Harry knew she was talking about Lucius.
Harry crept from the forest with a sleep heavy head, following Draco just far enough behind for them not to meet. Harry remembered how to sleep again and it was the moment he woke up the next morning, blinking back undisturbed rest, that he knew he’d return to the forest for as long as he had to.
He wondered who he would see in the forest this time, if Draco was the only person he’d ever meet on the winding paths. He’d thought at first that the forest was simply projecting people it knew well, that maybe one day he’d get Neville, Hagrid, Ron, or even Fang. He hoped ever so vaguely that he might see his parents again, the ghosts who’d visited him inside her branches. He just hoped he’d never have to face Voldemort again in the tangled branches, but he felt somehow that the forest wouldn’t do that to him, though he couldn’t place why.
“I’m not sure I trust you,” he said to the forest, knowing on some level that she was listening. He listened back, for the first time truly opened himself up and felt the forest’s mumbling brush of a laugh wash over his skin, felt her warmth for him even in his distrust, and realized that she wanted to help.
“I’m Jewish and I can tell you quite genuinely that I feel the spirit of Christmas,” Anthony said, grinning as they took a slow stroll around the tables and admired all the pretty details in the decorations.
“That’s not really our forte, is it?” Harry asks, then feels like he’s been a little too honest. “We don’t have to.”
“Large sweaters are great,” Anthony agreed. “I’m just not sure why Draco Malfoy continues to be your sworn enemy. When was the last time she was actually mean to you?”
Draco is quiet beside him, tapping his foot along to the rhythm. Emma rests her head on his shoulder for a while and it feels like they’re real friends.
Draco didn’t look at her, her eyes locked on something just outside the window. “I just get really irritated.”
“She’d have had to have a pretty good reason to meddle with your work,” Harry says, still writing her name on the list of suspects. “Or it’s been a long game.”
The first six months of Auror training and the subsequent exams are group-focused. They’re reminded time after time that being an Auror is about people, about sharing information, and working as a team. When Harry arrives at Auror headquarters for the second session, he is given an envelope and is pointed by the receptionist towards a small room in an empty, well lit hallway.
“It’s Ron’s.” Harry replies, positive that he’s hallucinating, that this is some bizarre dream and he’ll wake up in a cold sweat. It’s less awful than the ones he normally has, but what’s a new kind of psychosis at this point.
“I don’t know,” Harry says. “I would see people and know that I thought they were good-looking, or kind, and then think that I shouldn’t do it, because it never was— even with Ginny, with you and Cho and Cedric, I was never allowed— it was always this big deal and I didn’t know what to do so I just stopped trying.”
Harry laughs, then takes another look at Draco’s face, and laughs even harder. It is strange to have Draco in his house, and he doesn’t quite know what to do with the fact that it keeps happening. It occurs to Harry that maybe he should apologize for showing up at Draco’s flat the previous morning slightly tipsy and definitely bleeding. “I’m sorry about, you know, yesterday.” Draco’s smile shrinks a little, and Harry wonders which part was the part he did wrong. “I got your letter right as I got home from the pub and I just invited myself over.”
Harry has showered, made his best effort at a balanced meal, and flipped through both Quidditch Weekly and The Quibbler. He’s even tried to do the Quibbler’s notoriously difficult crossword puzzle, making it a fairly impressive quarter of the way in. It’s so deliberately obtuse that Hermione refuses point blank to do it, mainly because Ron is markedly better at it than she is, through sheer ability to come up with odd and unexpected answers. Luna’s philosophy on the crossword is that it should cater to all intelligences, meaning that it’s designed to be completed over the course of a week as a collaborative project. It’s really peak Luna, and it makes his head hurt.
That evening, when Draco finds him in the archives in the middle of an impressive spread of papers, he’s feeling much less positively about the whole thing.
“Maybe if you weren’t so fucking useless at this,” Draco spits, sitting up. “I’m not going to cast the cruciatus curse on you, and fuck you for asking me to. Just because I was a Death Eater doesn’t mean I’m okay with throwing Unforgivables around like bludgers at a quidditch match. Is that all you think I am?”
“I want to show you something,” the snake said, dipping his head at Draco in a gesture of respect. Draco stared at the snake in a moment of shock, before dipping his head quickly back, nearly dropping the book in the process.
Harry saw movement on the other side of the pond, slow and unthreatening, someone standing up, maybe. He couldn’t see who they were, just the slant of their body and how still they held, staring back across at him. He wondered who else could be wandering the Forbidden Forest at night, if there even was anyone else. It seemed suddenly far more likely to Harry that whoever it was, the forest had created them, drummed them up out of dirt and stray leaves.
Harry shrugs again, always at a loss. He tries to scrape some semblance of a reply together, wants to come up with something that could justify any of this vague feeling of wanting. “I think part of it is because you don’t really care if I like you or not. You’re honest.”
Someone takes the microphone and calls the next band up, three girls taking the stage, one on keyboard and the other two on guitar.
It was mostly surprising because he’d been sure that Draco didn’t have any experience with worn things, that he only ever got what was shiny and new. He wondered, as he walked out to the forest that night in the growing chill, if Draco’s words had also applied to worn people and if he’d even meant them to.
“Quit zoning out,” Draco snapped, and Harry found herself wrenched back into reality by the high pitched rasp of Draco’s voice. “You’re abysmal enough when you aren’t distracted.”
“She doesn’t even care about being my enemy anymore,” Harry complained. “She’s been ignoring me since we got back.”
“C’mon Malfoy, you’re stunned, not dead,” Harry mutters. He gives Draco a gentle push on the shoulder in much the same way that he would nudge something he suspected might explode.
Draco shakes his head longer than he should, but he still doesn’t leave. Harry is beginning to think the whole thing is that no matter what happens, neither of them are going to. “I can’t do this training. There are no books to tell me how to be okay with you knowing my secrets.”
“Of course she did,” Harry said, remembering her almost smugness out on the field earlier that day. “And she was okay about it? She wasn’t mad?”
“Your friends are weird, Potter,” Draco says, brushing the dust off of his very worse-for-wear sweater. “Extremely weird.”
Despite making it close to thirty pages in since dinner, he didn’t think he understood muggles any better. These muggles seemed awfully adventurous and obsessed with the sea, but he thought it might just be the book. He’d have to ask Harry, if he ever decided to show up.
“You’re the one staring at him.” She stuck a piece of muffin into her mouth. “I’ve been switching tables all year, I can’t believe you’re just noticing. Well, I suppose I can believe it, you’ve only just started to return to us, haven’t you?”
Draco just blinks at him for a moment, apparently unfazed. “I’m extremely charming you know, it’s not my fault you never noticed.”
“Merlin knows he needed it,” Draco replied quickly, pretending to read his textbook. Harry could be dumb and chivalrous and start fights with third years in the hallway, but now Draco didn’t owe him for that, at least.
“Harry.” They summon the angel hair pasta down from the cabinet and retrieve the meatballs from the freezer with another flick of their wand.
“I think he just used to follow Draco around and was mean by proxy,” Harry said, thinking of Draco’s assertion that Greg was sweet.
Forest Harry was bizarre, both rough and teasing, quick to jump to conclusions but also to smile at Draco when he least expected it. Some part of him had long assumed that the only way to talk to Harry was to be cruel to him, since friendship had always failed before. He’d never considered gentle teasing, that the sides of Harry’s mouth could twitch up in shared amusement.
“So you’ve said,” Harry says, trailing Draco out of the room and to the dormitory, where he strips out of his pajama top and rifles through his trunk for his robes, tugging them over his head and messing up his hair again.
“She’ll never go for it Ernie,” Harry said, trying to get through the crowded hallway. She was quite nearly late, and definitely didn’t have time to gently talk him down.
The air had gone more humid, swirling and warm, the ground not quite as rough as it had been before. Harry could feel their actions already slipping into routine.
“I don’t know, I think I’ve improved enough that she wouldn’t kill me,” Anthony said, giving Harry a cheeky little turn that she executed with a fair amount of wobbling but no actual falling to the floor. “Maybe just hex irreparably.”
“I’m pretty sure I don’t care at all about that, to be honest,” Harry says. Irritatingly enough, he doesn’t sound like he isn’t so hard he can barely think straight, which Draco is going to fix as soon as he’s finished processing this thought. “They’re all nosy prats and they can mind their own business for once in their lives.”
He wandered through the sweet air, a faint mist beginning to snake its way through the trees and pooling at his feet.
Draco thought perhaps, out of the all the terrible things he’d done, this might be the one to finally tear him apart. Harry kissed like Draco had always imagined he would, with a pushy sort of intensity, like he was trying to get his way even in that. Somehow Draco hadn’t imagined the desperate edge to his mouth or Harry’s hands on his waist as he pulled them close like lovers. He had almost hoped it would be more impersonal, that kissing a mirage of a boy in the forest wouldn’t destroy him so thoroughly.
“Why do you want me to leave so badly?” Harry asked, picking at old wounds. There were a million reasons for him to leave but he wanted to hear them.
Draco sips at the last dregs of his milkshake and doesn’t respond. Despite the seriousness of the situation, Harry is still moderately impressed by the speed with which he’s put away so much ice cream.
The forest, for her part, loved Draco Malfoy too. The forest loved him as it loved the centaurs and unicorns and the dark things in its deeps. The forest loved him with a ferocious and untidy passion from the moment he stepped inside, older than he had been during his first visit, more broken, more wise.
“I was trying to help Ernie!” Harry protested, wishing she could hit something. It felt like she was trying to fight a tornado, like the both of them were hurricanes smashing into each other.
“Of course not!” Harry replies indignantly, unsure whether or not to be pleased at the reaction or annoyed. He takes a long swig of his coffee, feeling completely ridiculous. “So technically, you both helped us out.”
“Less kissing,” Draco says with the smallest quirk of a smile. “Probably. You can never really be sure.”
Connie continues, as if she can’t sense their discomfort, which, maybe she can’t. “She had short blonde hair, wasn’t very pretty. Not enough chin.”
Harry absolutely is staring at him, and when Draco catches his eye, he jerks his head towards the kitchen door. Draco can’t imagine that Harry is insinuating what he thinks Harry is insinuating, but then he does the weird head jerk again, stands up rather awkwardly and leaves the kitchen.
Draco nods, taking a sip. He’s sitting very still but somehow he doesn’t look calm. Harry is reminded of animals playing dead or cats freezing before they strike, he’s not sure exactly which. “It was a three cup day, but I only had time for two at home.”
On the northern staircase, the red, blue, green, and yellow sections of yarn swayed in the candlelight. A new color was woven between them, a large swath of purple knit that would be discovered in the morning by wandering students traipsing down to the Great Hall for breakfast in makeup from the night before.
I hope you are well. Maybe you’re not. If I were actually sending these letters then maybe you would write back and tell me. Probably not, I don’t think I’m entitled to that sort of information. To be fair, if I were sending you these letters I probably wouldn’t tell you anything. Maybe if we were talking in person I could ask you and I’d be able to tell by your face. Severus used to say you were terrible at occlumency. At least there’s something in this world I’m better at than you. I bet that would make you mad, wouldn’t it? I bet you hated that for once you were shite at something. You are despicable, you make my chest tight.
“Yeah, he was telling me about my flowers,” Claudia replies. “Did you send flower code letters to Hermione and Ron?” She grins when she says the names, and Harry thinks he’s always going to be surprised by the way these kids say his friends names like they know them too.
“Doesn’t make sense for you to go for me,” Harry replied, feeling like an idiot even as the words left his mouth, like even now Draco wouldn’t want him.
Harry doesn’t know if he completely believes this, but he’s lousy at potions and Draco is being pretty convincing. “So you think someone wanted you to turn? Why?”
He was so caught up in the warmth of his skin that he barely noticed that they’d stopped kissing, their mouths pressed against one each other as Harry explored Draco’s body with his hand. He could feel the shake of Draco’s biceps as he held himself up, the clench and unclench of the muscles in his torso.
“She’s been in here for months now,” Draco says in leu of a reply, looking out at the graying day. November has crept in cold and windy, and Draco is always woefully underdressed. “They keep running tests but the flowers are so much a part of her body they’re having trouble taking them out. It hurts her to try and fight them.” There’s a pause. “The nurses think the flowers are going to take her over.”
?” Draco’s voice was loud enough that it rang down the stairway to where Harry, Hermione, and Ron were walking. “What in Merlin’s name is growing from the ceiling?”
Harry blanches, remembering when Pansy had phrased the question, unsettled that he still doesn’t have an acceptable answer. He’s beginning to formulate one somewhere in his subconscious but it makes him feel guilty and doesn’t make sense. “It’s just weird, after having him be such a big part of everything I was fighting against for him not to be around anymore. I feel like I’m not-” He pauses, sifting through his words. “I feel like I need him somehow?”
“Greg is the most loyal friend I’ve ever had,” Draco said, her face going closed. It was an expression Harry recognized, the closing that happened when she was going to cry. “We’ve known each other our whole lives since our families were really close.”
“Brave words from someone quoting Mrs. Weasley’s romance novels,” Harry says, packing his things back into his work bag.
“Ellen has work in the morning,” Harry replies, reaching for Draco’s arm. He melts into Harry’s touch, barely even humming disapproval when Harry guides him towards the door. “And I have to go, Ron’s picking me up for brunch in the morning.”
Harry hears Draco swear, but Ron begins to laugh, flinging open the stairwell door. “Oh, they think that’ll work? No Ministry hack is going to stop us, we’re the good guys.”
“You just wait until I retire,” Dara’s saying, her boots squelching in the mud. “I’m going to get my own swamp and you’ll only hear from me on Halloween and Christmas.”
Everything had the boring residue of destiny on it. He’d lost track of the amount of times he’d thought that surely it couldn’t get worse, the amount of times he’d thought “I’m not surprised anymore,” which wasn’t the same as really not being surprised. It was quietly admitting that you were still being taken aback by cruelty you wished you could be numb to.
“Don’t test me,” Draco said, but she didn’t tell her to give up or go away even though Harry knew she must have wanted to.
“We can’t just be friends after everything,” Draco said, sounding like the words were hard to get out, her face deliberately facing the floor so she wouldn’t have to look at Harry.
He couldn’t explain to them that Draco was trying, that he wasn’t so hateful anymore, that Harry couldn’t explain most of his attraction in the first place. He was beginning to wonder if sleep was worth all this, if the way he was getting better in some ways was ruined by the way Draco was tearing him apart.
“I don’t know how you stand like this and don’t look stupid,” Harry grumbled, trying to keep her head up and hold herself at the stilted angles Draco held so naturally.
Draco looks at him doubtfully, but takes his tea cup back and sits at the armchair across from him. In its cage, a small brown owl makes happy little morning noises, but otherwise the apartment has the same calm, semi-quiet that Harry’s does in the morning.
Dara smacks her forehead with her palm. “I forgot we didn’t have them,” she says. “We’ve been in here too long.”
“You can’t make fun of me,” Harry replies, because if she laughs he thinks he might have to move to the forest and spend the rest of his life as a hermit. He has camping experience. He could probably do it.
When night came and he finally slipped out, Blaise shot him a dirty grin that Draco didn’t have the energy to return. He thought telling someone might make him feel better but it just made him feel stupid, having someone else know that he was having his heart broken, like a month long operation gone wrong. He wanted it to be over, to pick himself up off the operating table and start healing, but he didn’t want it to stop, even though it felt like being cut open, like having someone reach inside his chest and squeeze. It felt like that, but it was still being touched.
Harry kissed him, because it was forest and it didn’t matter, because Draco was warm and vibrant and possibly the realest thing Harry had felt in months. It was stupid but he did it, because Draco had kissed him first. Draco’s lips had woken up some sleeping part of him and now he didn’t know how to put it to bed.
“I feel like I just got told off by a kitten,” Blaise said dismissively, brushing off his cloak and giving Draco a firm push in return.
Harry reaches up, running the pads of his fingers against the skin. He likes the kids because they don’t tip toe around him, are willing to poke at his scars and grin through it. “Not anymore, no. Not for years now.”
“Ah yes, actually, that one,” Ron says. “Wow there’s so much explaining to do. We need Hermione, she would have a. Hmm. What’s she call it. A Power Point. Merlin, that was a mess. That was not supposed to be half as messy as that, Hermione is not going to be happy.”
The final week before the Yule Ball came and went in a flash of dress buying, rehearsal, and the slow expansion of the fiber art sculpture.
“Are you afraid to know me?” Harry asks, and it could be a tease but he’s careful not to smile. He looks up and finds Draco’s eyes and challenges him the only way he knows how. “Is it so awful? Knowing everything I do? Everything I feel?”
“What I’m trying to prove, Draco,” Pansy interrupts. “Is that you want to kiss Harry and you’re not doing a half as good a job of pretending you don’t as you think you are.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said as Draco shook herself out, her posture straightening. “And  you’re right, your sexuality isn’t my business.”
“I think you’re enjoying this too much,” Harry says finally, knowing that opening up that can of flobberworms won’t end well.
Harry blinked at him, looking like he wasn’t sure whether it would be appropriate to laugh. “Like, my usual order?”
Draco rocked against him, his breath coming in quick gasps that rang in Harry’s ears like the rustle of the branches. He smelled slightly herbal, like some kind of nice soap that was almost familiar. Harry could feel his magic surging like it did whenever he was about to come, and tried to pull Draco more tightly to him to try and feel the thrum of his magic too. He could find it when he focused, the low hum of foreign power washing towards him, sparking and warm and beyond them.
Harry considers whispering a goodbye into the empty air, but disapparates before he can indulge the thought.
Draco looked as if she’d eaten something sour, and Harry fought the urge to laugh since she thought it would make Draco even more testy.
At which point Harry starts laughing and taking off his pants, while Draco pulls his clothes off and tells Harry very sternly to stop laughing while also laughing, and then they’re both naked and Harry is realizing once again just how beautiful Draco is, particularly with his clothes off.
“What about Weaselette?” Draco asks, then seems to reconsider it, waving his hand dismissively even as he amends it. “Sorry, her name’s Ginny or something?”
Harry thinks he might be able to do this forever, pulling Draco from between his legs and into his lap so they can be closer. Draco pulls away for a moment to brush his hair out of his eyes and Harry presses kisses down his jawline and onto his neck and hopes that Draco knows they’re a request to love him back. He doesn’t ask if this is just a fling or if Draco only likes it because it’s a secret but he sucks the pale skin of Draco’s neck until he’s sure it’ll bruise and that’s good enough.
“He was a scared kid and we both know that,” Hermione reprimands. “Not that that excuses his actions or how much of a general prat he is, but I thought you were better than this now. What do you want with him anyway?”
The instructions inside the envelope are deceptively simple, a paraphrase of the booklet they’d been told to study before arriving:
“Are you crying?” Harry asked, sidling up closer. It was the bathroom all over again, it was 6th year and Draco was crying and Harry was always helpless.
.” Harry half expects her to whip out a magnifying glass and deerstalker, and suspects that she would if not for the fact that the entire contents of her robes had been confiscated.
Harry felt, in an instant, the warmth of Draco’s skin and the way they’d always spoken like their words meant everything, like it wasn’t just a dream. In a way, he didn’t know how he hadn’t suspected, thought maybe he’d worked hard not to see. “No, it’s not.”
Harry has been waiting for this question, but by the time it arrives it surprises him. “I don’t know.”
Like considering a memory in a pensieve that should belong to him but doesn’t, Harry is dimly aware that one day he will be able to begin pairing socks again and picking sun hot tomatoes from the vine. Things happen to him, this will happen too.
“Ginny helped,” Ron replied jovially, handing Harry the paper that dictated where everything should be placed.
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco said, looking as if Harry had suggested far more bizarre than Yule Ball color choices. “Not in a million years.”
He nearly ran into Draco, who was walking in the opposite direction on the path, and when they met the Forest sent a wave of petals so thick they got caught in their hair and flew down their sleep shirts.
“Thank you,” he said, touching the bark of an old tree, no longer afraid to speak to her. She sighed back and he knew she was telling him that he was welcome, that he would always be welcome.
Harry doesn’t answer her and Ron comes back a short time later, the mood a little quieter even as he tries to crack jokes and tease them both.
He looks at Draco, and finds something familiar in his eyes, a gray intensity that he understands only because it’s how he feels. The tv slips from his fingers and crashes to the ground, the sound echoing in the narrow street.
Luckily, Harry Potter doesn’t seem to be interested in talking to Draco either, which is a whole new pie graph, because there’s a small percentage of Draco that wants Potter to want to talk to him. If Potter tried to talk to him then he would know that Draco is just fine and perfectly adjusted and still charming.
“I did think maybe it would be Pansy, but,” she shrugs delicately, apparently satisfied. “He’s much better than some of the other boys.”
Lee appears at their table with two steaming-hot plates hovering above his left shoulder, Draco’s milkshake in his hand. “Did I hear you say something about divine justice?” Lee asks, lowering their food in front of them. “It’s served.”
Harry tilted his head so Draco could get a better angle on his neck. “Are you the only version of you who wants to kiss me?”
“How do you talk to your acquaintances?” Harry prompted, looking particularly brazen about this new train of thought, even as it left Draco with a crawling pit in his chest.
11. When Voldemort died, everything was supposed to be over, but it wasn’t. Neville had said it, about snakes, that every time you cut off a head two new ones grow in its place.
He didn’t have classes with Harry, although he staunching avoided glancing at Granger, like looking at her would be looking at Harry by proxy. He knew it was ridiculous, that he should be better than hiding from Potter, but he unequivocally was not.
you’re awake! Harry we have been got! We have gotten got. We were so stupid. The potpourri! The biscuits! We were got by a old gossipy hag.”
The forest sensed the sulky heaviness in his footsteps and grew all of his favorite roses on the edges of the paths, making the air heavy with the smell of flowers. The forest felt the anger flow out of him, felt the petulance drip from his fingers and leave a hollow of tiredness in its place. He reminded her of a tree cut back for the winter, about to grow back larger and more beautiful, but still unsure how.
“Nice hickey,” he said, affecting something of his old swagger, trying to get Harry to play along with him, trying to forget that everything was so dire.
“I want to kiss you,” Harry says, blushing even as the words leave his mouth. Maybe he’s a masochist, there’s another explanation everyone would believe.
“Oh,” Harry responds, feeling a little lost. Malfoy has a bemused expression on his face, like Harry is the most bizarre thing he’s come across in ages.
Draco nods, gathers himself and returns to the kitchen. He sets a dishwashing spell on a few plates and returns to his bedroom for a bag, taking a few things out of it to leave on the table and then throwing it over his shoulder. “Okay.” Draco says, lingering at the door. Harry realizes belatedly that he’s on his way out, and jumps up to follow him, trailing him down the stairs, broom in hand.
Of course, sometimes the forest calls out to us, with the rustle of leaves in the night, vines sneaking through the cracks of windows, and alien bird calls in the early morning. Sometimes it’s impossible to resist.
Delia’s eyes light up and she tells him that she’s going to go there, her little watering can arms shaking with excitement. It’s not an overly interesting conversation, in fact, he’s had similar ones hundreds of times over, but he knows that for these kids, he’s the only person they’ll talk to all day that isn’t a nurse, that to them it’s the most riveting thing in the world. When he’s there, he feels like he’s making something better, but explaining it to everyone else makes it sound hollow. There’s no way to pretend that it’s better than being Head Auror and no one believes him when he says it.
Harry’s having tea with Hermione, and a mental crisis, among other things. She’s been chatting with him about the outreach project they’ve been working on to help muggleborn children’s parents better understand their children’s world and he keeps getting distracted by the feelings building in his gut.
“No, not yet,” Draco said, her eyes not quite meeting Harry’s. It felt like an incomplete thought but she didn’t add any more, just danced until the song ended before dropping Harry’s hands. “I think I’d like a bit of a break.”
“I wish I hadn’t kissed you,” Draco says, more to himself than to Harry. It hurts, even though Harry would much rather pretend it didn’t make him feel anything. “I don’t need to be your experiment after all of the shit we’ve done.”
Harry comes back to the repair shop a week later with nothing in his hands and finds Draco at the counter, paler than before. Harry can’t hear any music and Draco isn’t dancing, just slumped against against the counter, doodling something on a notepad.
They kissed until they began to stumble, heads too clouded to continue. They clutched at each other so they wouldn’t fall, kept their eyes closed so they wouldn’t have to see.
Hearing the word ‘Muggleborn’ come out of Draco’s mouth after years of the other one takes him by surprise, even though at this point it probably shouldn’t. His father had always paid lip service to doing the right thing when he was trying to clear his name and get back in the Ministry’s good graces, but the way Draco had said it, like it was normal, reminds Harry that Draco has always been a better man that his father was.
Draco might have begged mysterious prior commitments and/or a blood curse if he didn’t very secretly, usually have a very nice time. The party where they’d all made and brought their favorite soups, including one that Neville had made using herbs from his garden, remained the best meal Draco’d had since Hogwarts.
“You don’t think, you just feel,” Draco replies, the corner of his mouth quirking up. Harry can’t tell if he’s back to joking and doesn’t know which is scarier. Draco lifts Harry’s wrist up to his lips and presses a kiss against the soft brown skin on the inside of it, keeping it there and holding his gaze until Harry feels like he should know something more than he did before it. He’s not entire sure what it is but it feels weighty and significant and a little bit like old magic.
“You don’t even try to clear your mind,” Draco says, breaking eye contact and leaning back in the chair. He looks exhausted, the tremor in his hands visible in the low light. “You don’t even try.”
Harry wonders how much she’s heard, wonders how much even makes sense to her. He knows Draco probably hasn’t told her anything about himself but Harry thinks she might have the quiet perceptiveness gifted to many gray haired women.
“Yeah, oh yeah,” Harry says, stumbling over the words as he pushes the radio onto the counter. “It’s not playing.”
“I think a handshake will suffice. If you back out, I will scalp you,” Draco said. “My nails are probably sharp enough and if not, Pansy has a collection of fancy knives.”
“And we’re allowed to pester you about who you’re fucking,” Ron said, tossing a leaf in Harry’s direction with a cackle. “Best friends are so important.”
Harry smiled, feeling like she was dancing on clouds, like her feet barely touched the ground as they moved. “You are a good teacher, I wasn’t kidding about that.”
Draco has had one or two one night stands in his life and he’s already concerned that this feels like a whole lot more than that. Harry brushes his knuckles over Draco’s cheek and smiles at him and Draco thinks, with equal amounts of concern and elation, that this feels like maybe he wants it to happen every day forever and that there’s a distinct possibility that he could arrange that.
Pansy gives him one of her most withering looks. “Draco, you’re a homosexual and you kiss girls like one too.”
“I’ll remember that for next time.” The rain has started to pick up, pattering an even drum beat on the top of his shield charm. “If I take you back to the Healers and help you get sorted like I’m supposed to, how difficult are you going to make my life?”
Draco looks quietly pleased with himself, eating a piece of the croissant he’d been ignoring in favor of presenting his evidence. Harry flips back in his case notes, finding the questions he’d brought to ask Draco before Harry had known he’d gone full amateur detective.
2. Mexican herbologist Alicia Garcia went missing in the forest for one year in the depths of the forest and upon her return, refused to write anything concerning her disappearance.
It would be too much work, Harry thinks, to act out indignation, or fury. Too many people have died for Harry to think that any of them can understand anything anymore. He’s never going to try to explain to Neville that Draco is the kindest and most familiar anyone has ever been with his body, that Harry is horrible at being loved and now is no different.
50. Draco’s Dark Mark, faded like an old blood blister and churning a persistent yellow and purple bruise, keeps him as safe as it ever has. What he did at the Manor and to his father was reckless and they all knew it. He claimed it bought him more time, that the Death Eaters believed him persecuted as they were, on the run from Azkaban or no longer allowed to exert the same blameless sway over the Ministry. Draco plays it up to them, that they must be coming for him, fakes outrage, fakes fear. Privately, Harry wonders how hard he has to try to be afraid.
26. They were always waiting for something to really happen. Harry didn’t know if the something would be bad or good. Harry wondered if they would know what to do when it came.
“What can I do?” he asks after a long minute, holding the bowl awkwardly in front of him like a limb he’s lost feeling in.
“Maybe they’re all working together,” Hermione suggests. “So its harder to pin the blame on one of them?”
Draco looks on the verge of collapse again and Harry doesn’t know how to help either of them. He just stares, knows his eyes are going cold. He isn’t sure the last time he was this desperate and feels the muted horror of that helplessness.
“GIRLS!” Headmistress McGonagall’s voice cut through their shouting match, and she looked distinctly unamused when she came striding over to both of them. “I expected much better from both of you. You will have detention every night for the rest of this week, and you will either dance together or you will kill each other trying.”
Harry puts both of his hands on Draco’s shoulders and makes extremely intense eye contact with him. “It was so hot. I would like to do it again, possibly every day. Maybe more than once a day.”
Harry nods, because he had to say it, even though he knew Draco would shake his head and tell him no. He supposes they’ll never know how it would have been different, never be able to go back again and save each other. He knows his eleven year old self wouldn’t believe any of this, because Draco was just as awful as Harry was oblivious, but they’re both wiser now.
“But like, should we be-” Harry cut himself off this time by pressing his lips briefly back to Draco’s, cursing their magnetism. “Doing this? After all of our history?”
“Everyone who’s gotten back to us said their supply is okay. Told everyone it was urgent, so naturally we’re still waiting for about half.”
Draco burned and burned and then there was no more of him. The sharp mouth of the fire drew shadows that danced across the trees and then there was nothing but the afterimage behind Harry’s eyes as they fought to adjust, a rainbow mirage of past light and a thick darkness. There was a pile of ash that crackled and settled with magic.
“I didn’t hate you.” Harry doesn’t know why he says it, even though it’s true. He can’t remember the last time when hate was the only thing he felt towards Malfoy, when the feeling wasn’t tinged with a million other things like pity and sadness and anger.
Harry fussed with the fastener on Draco’s robe, pulling it off until he was only in a button up and trousers. So many pristine layers and Draco clutching at him with an almost violent fervor, breathing hard into his mouth.
“There was a snake,” Harry began, his forehead crinkling, and Draco felt the way that Harry spoke to him high in his throat, talking to him like he was an ally in that sylvan maze. Like Draco was one of his confidantes, friends, even. “It told me something about darkness?”
Ron looks at him, really looks at him, and doesn’t seem to know what he’s seeing. “Water flows faster than fire?”
Draco laughed at Harry’s expression, a delighted cackle that Harry had never heard sound so charming. “It’s just the forest, Merlin you should have seen your face.”
“I thought you would have higher standards about this kind of thing,” Harry says, touching himself idly as Draco watches.
“I knew you’d come back alive,” Hermione said as Harry climbed through the portrait hole at eight forty, her messy hair up in a ponytail. “How was it?”
“Who can?” Harry replied, cringing at yet another terrible fourth year Yule Ball memory, where she had ended up with a lot of eyelash glue on her hands and no eyelashes on her eyes. It wasn’t quite as bad as Marietta, who had apparently stuck her fake eyelashes on quite permanently with a sticking charm gone too well.
Harry’s the one who finally pulls back, holding Draco’s face in both hands so he can breathe for a moment. The lipstick is smeared like he thought it would be, dark red and paler pink around the curve of his mouth. Draco has something wild in his eyes and it makes Harry grin wider than he can fathom, leaning into Draco’s neck and dragging lipstick kisses across the skin there.
“That’s cool,” Ron said, voice level. “The Forbidden Forest is a weird place. Mum used to tell me she’d kill me if I ever went in alone. There are some nasty stories, it can eat people up.”
Harry was curled into the corner of the couch in the Gryffindor common room, watching the clock tick closer and closer to eight with growing dread. “I thought Ernie was exaggerating,” she said quietly. “I didn’t know. I could not have guessed.”
“Yeah, she talked me into it,” Draco said, turning to look at the snake. “They’re a little terrifying really.”
“Thanks,” he replies, sliding around the counter and heading for the door. Harry gives Belinda a wave as they leave, following Draco out onto the sidewalk, shivering in the chill November wind.
“They all seem kind of suspicious to me. Two of them have motives and Jasmine thought one of them seemed weird, which sometimes means guilty.”
“They did,” Draco said, even though his parents’ love for him hadn’t come close to saving them. Maybe it had only been meant to save him, and he wondered how they’d feel about their success.
Harry lifts his head, realizing that in the foggy blur of last night he’d forgotten to set an alarm. “How’d you get in?”
“Posture, Ms. Potter,” McGonagall said, her hands moving Harry’s shoulders up and back and adjusting her grip on Anthony’s hand. “I can assure you that getting just a bit closer to Mr. Goldstein will not be your death.”
Draco looks affronted, which Harry should have expected. “Are you quite finished insulting my spellwork, or did you have more you wanted to say?”
Draco scooted to the right that Harry could squeeze in next to her, both of them looking out on the snow.
“I just wish they’d up your dose of dreamless sleep,” Hermione said irritably, a furrow in her brow.
Draco gives him a long look, tilting his long pointed nose up into the cool air. “What if I told you that I know I’m bad?”
Harry nods, though he hasn’t seen them. He wonders why Connie thinks this is the kind of information he would have on hand just about at the time that he notices that the cloying floral smell is starting to make his head hurt.
Draco shakes his head. “Not exactly. There’s a thing called a flower press, if you put flowers between the pages the flowers flatten and dry out so you can use them for stuff.”
Harry realizes too late that he doesn’t know what to say. He remembers the muddy aftermath of the war, when Draco was going around looking so sorry, throwing money at anything that needed it, going to ministry charity balls and looking taciturn, drawn. Harry had expected it to feel good, seeing Draco fall from grace, but it hadn’t.
Draco cracks one of his tinderbox smiles. “Of course you’d assume you know me better than I know myself.”
The ‘forest’ part of the Forbidden Forest, new research suggests, may be slightly misleading. Renowned herbologist Jasmine Winthrop on her most recent research expedition, has discovered under the forest a vast, interconnected root system that stretches close to two miles into the Earth’s crust. Even more fascinating, is her deduction that the roots are not those of separate plants, but of a enormous clonal colony grown from one original tree.
“Sure they will, we’re friends now. Friends know each other’s favorite colors,” Harry replied with a grin. Draco frowned, crossing her arms over her chest until Harry relented. “I won’t tell, you big baby.”
Harry’s mind drifts back to the muggle repair shop, to Malfoy, quiet behind the counter. He almost wants to bring it up, but he doesn’t think he can do it without all his strange feelings bubbling up into his mouth.
Harry pictures reaching over to give Draco the kind of awkward conciliatory pats that he and Ron used to give each other before they figured out how to hug, but doesn’t think he could possibly manage to be casual about it. He’s also vaguely concerned it would cause Draco to go full wolf and take his hand off.
“We could try it,” Harry said with a noncommittal shrug, like Draco wasn’t the prettiest girl she’d ever met, like she hadn’t watched her out of the corner of her eye since she’d gotten to school. “Dating, or whatever.”
Pansy laughed, tipping her head back and leaning into him. Draco wrapped his armor tighter around himself, letting himself be dragged into the Great Hall where Harry sat with all his friends, shame pooled deep in his stomach.
“A blueberry muffin with minor anger issues that it’s working on,” Harry offers, which Draco can’t handle, at all, in any way.
“Can’t say I did, no,” Draco replied tartly, slinking into the communal bathroom with tired eyes. He felt vaguely shell shocked into awakeness, but knew the crash was soon on the horizon. The problem was that he could convince himself during the night that he’d be okay in the morning but his sleeplessness always dragged him back down.
“Neither did I,” Harry says, and he’s coming back to himself but there’s a reason he doesn’t think about that, a reason he can’t truly remember most of his childhood. He wonders for the first time if that’s okay.
“Did you make any progress on the case?” Hermione prods, crossing her legs in neatly pressed trousers. They’re wedged into a corner in the busiest sit-down lunch place in Diagon Alley, one with so many politicians and minor celebrities crammed into its plush velvet booths that no one pays them any mind.
“I think that went okay,” Harry begins quietly, because Narcissa didn’t curse him and she even told him to join Draco for tea more often if he wasn’t too busy. He hoists himself up on the counter next to Draco, who’s resting against the cabinet like he’s thinking about becoming a permanent fixture there. “Hey.”
“How did you even manage this?” Harry asked, narrowing her eyes at the riddles on each slip of paper.
Draco opens his mouth and then lets it close again, tilting his head to the side and furrowing his brow.
“Thought I’d abandoned you here in Slytherin attire?” Draco said with a cackle. “No, I wouldn’t do that.”
“Helga and Godric themselves send their accolades,” Harry says, grabbing his quill and starting in on the mountain of paperwork before them.
“I was in the middle of homework,” Hermione added, sounding irritated despite her initial feelings about the ball. “I still have three readings left to do.”
It had barely been more than two weeks in the forest and yet it felt both like it had taken years and like he’d only wandered in yesterday. He felt like he’d uncovered a world since then, uncovered a boy he’d never known and patched up his tired body. He thought maybe he should be angry, angry for knowing he should stop and angry at Draco for refusing to be real and refusing to love him but the ending had always been inevitable. No one, especially not him, could exist in the filmy embrace of the forest forever. It had always been transitive, always a temporary home.
“Oh that’s likely,” she scoffs, pursing her magenta lips. “Why can’t you just leave us alone? I think we’ve been punished enough, don’t you?”
Blaise pretended to look offended, though he knew his reputation as well as Draco did. “Fair enough. How about I tell you something about me, barter system style? Then we both have something on each other.”
“You and me both, Mione,” Harry replied, before zipping up into the air to join the game of keep away, her hair streaming out behind her.
“Are you going to tell me what’s wrong or do I have to wring it out of you?” she asks finally, setting her cup of tea down with a decisive clink.
Even after everything that’s happened, he still likes this one. It tastes like butterbeer and Ginny smells like fresh grass and victory and he’s so proud of everyone his chest is full with it. It feels like it’s supposed to: there’s him and the girl and all his classmates, and nothing has been ruined yet. It’s the sort of memory that will feel good forever, a patronus memory even, one that stays good even after everything around it ceases to exist, just because it existed.
“It fell,” Harry adds belatedly, but Malfoy just gives the smallest of laughs, a quiet exhalation that’s seems to surprise him.
“No real leads yet,” Harry says. “I’m crossing my fingers that his nosy neighbor is the old fashioned kind.”
Draco briefly considers pretending that he’s never kissed a boy and would like to do some personal research re: Harry Potter’s mouth, but Pansy knows far, far too much about his gay awakening for him to ever get away with it. It had been one rather exciting month around the time Durmstrang visited Hogwarts, where he, by hook or by crook, had managed to enchant three separate Ukrainian boys. They were good boys. They still send him very, very strong booze and invite him to go skiing sometimes.
“I’m sure she has some reason for not punishing her,” Hermione reasoned. “Maybe she’s hoping Malfoy will calm down if she lets things unfold naturally.”
“I smell nice,” Harry protests, trying to correct her posture and feeling like a class act idiot. “You’re a nightmare.”
“Of course you can, it’s still a part of you,” the snake hissed back, sliding up near closer to him, friendly, threatening. “You’re so afraid of all your darkness now.”
“It would be more interesting than staring at me across the breakfast table and defending my honor from Hufflepuff brats,” Draco replied with a huff, relishing in the theatrics of it all. He could feel the roses around him perk up at their sparring, the forest herself just as invested as he was.
“Yeah,” Harry says, all of his words catching and failing. Harry hasn’t seen Malfoy in the years since the trials and he doesn’t look all that different, maybe less emaciated, maybe a little older behind the eyes. He glances down at his arm, at the faded outline of the Mark and tries not to grimace, although he knows Malfoy notices the movement.
“My circulation’s bad,” Harry replied, trying to pry himself out of the death grip Draco had on his wrist. “I died, remember?”
Dara, at this proclamation, looks at Harry with what he can only describe as sheer, childish delight. Harry has a feeling that her delight has everything to do with whatever expression he has on, the likes of which he doesn’t care to imagine. He thinks he might be smiling, but it’s absolutely not a given.
“It is my sincere hope that I won’t hear about any more problems from any of you,” McGonagall said, the steel in her voice making it sound like a threat.
Draco would actually like to hold some kind of conversation with Harry, but he has the strong feeling that neither of them have the social skills to pull it off and moreover, that it’s all the better for Draco’s dignity if he refrains from attempting it. Harry forgiving him his regretful forays into wizard fascism is one thing; Harry reacting well to the fact that Draco wants to climb him like a tree is another story, one perhaps better left unbroached.
Harry decides then, immediately, that’s he’s not above begging, even a little bit. “Draco, please. Faster, I—“
“Well I know which one I’m here for,” Harry said, but waited obediently for Draco slide off her winter cloak and stand in front of her.
“Parseltongue, you absolute idiot,” Draco said, his hand clasped to the dark mark burned against his skin. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, talking to snakes like that?”
“Stuff,” Harry replies, feeling that same squirming guilt in his stomach. It’s the question he’s been asking himself since he stepped down as auror. The charity work takes up most of his time - giving talks at schools and letting sick kids think he’s some kind of hero - but it doesn’t feel like enough. “I’m visiting a hospital later today, actually.”
There’s something cheerful and pop-y playing and he has to smile at the thought of Malfoy working dourly as it plays. Malfoy sets the tv up on an enormous wooden table in the middle, scrawling out a Post-It Note and sticking it to the top of the tv.
“She just is, naturally?” Harry asked, wondering if perhaps she should play nice. Then, she thought about the way Draco screwed up her nose when she was trying to be catty, and decided that her response was completely justified.
“Come in quickly! You never know who could have an eye out!” She says, poking her head out after them, presumably to make sure they haven’t been tailed or spotted. “Harry Potter, is it? I’ve seen you in the papers.”
“I’m doing nothing of the sort!” he protests, even as Harry beams. The front bell chimes and Belinda goes to get it, slipping out the front curtain as Draco casts a neat cleaning spell on the machine. “You can’t just expect to be good at everything, Saint Potter.”
“He likes to think that he plays his cards very close to his chest,” Luna says. “But he’s transparent, like thin skin.”
The forest welcomed him like she always did when he crossed over into her borders. She was just a forest tonight, no flowers or strange breezes and he was sure that she knew what was to be done.
“Could have fooled me,” Harry said, and then felt a rush of guilt at the discomfort in Draco’s expression. He didn’t look disgusted, more lost, like he was walking into something he didn’t understand. “Sorry, that’s not fair.”
Harry still remembered Draco’s hands wrapped tightly around his middle and he scrubbed a bit harder with the soap in an effort to not remember so vividly. He was so tired he was almost unconscious on his feet, and thanked the forest for whatever magic it held in its branches that was making it so much easier for him to find sleep. He climbed into bed with shower-damp hair and was out almost as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Harry hasn’t seen him in years and he’s disoriented by how familiar it feels to be sitting next to him in someone’s tiny garden. Harry wants to be a completely different person than the one who was so messed up and unwound that he’d ended up trashed on expensive wine and with his tongue Draco’s throat. Sitting here, it doesn’t feel like much has changed.
The door unlocks for him, and Harry, feeling foolish now that he’s arrived, takes the stairs up to Draco’s flat. Draco looks entirely too put together for so early in the morning, waiting in his doorway as Harry comes to the landing. Harry feels acutely that he looks like he just stopped an international dragon smuggling ring and then spent the entire rest of the night taking victory shots at the pub and Draco is his usual immaculate self. Draco is looking at him in a way that he doesn’t know how to parse, and Harry looks down at his feet so he doesn’t have to meet Draco’s gaze.
Harry started to open her mouth, but was cut off by Draco. “Actually, forget I asked that, I’m sure you have more. Let’s just start.”
“I thought it was common knowledge,” Draco says with a dismissive jump of his eyebrows. For a moment he looks slightly more human again.
“Please, can we not yell for once-“ Neville said tiredly, and Hermione rounded on him, slamming her hand on the table.
“You never liked the attention,” Draco says quietly, and it feels too intimate for this space but Harry doesn’t ask him to stop. “I liked it. It used to kill me that everyone paid attention to you and you didn’t even care about it. You were too busy saving the world and I just wanted people to like me.”
“Four,” Ron replied absently, returning to her discussion of potentially explicit knitting projects without a beat of hesitation.
Draco is silent as Harry gives his address to the cabbie and Harry has a sneaking suspicion that Draco’s pleased about the whole thing. Harry sneaks a glance at him, watching the way the streetlights catch on the platinum color of his hair, the flush of his cheeks and how he slumps against the side of the seat.
“Be good,” Draco says, and Harry has to close his eyes and focus very hard on not being pushed over the edge. “You look gorgeous like this,” Draco says. He says it like it’s easy to say, like it’s true, and it makes Harry tremble. He wants to beg to hear it again, over and over, until he believes it.
Harry screwed up her face. “Doesn’t that sound weird though? Like us? Dating? It just sounds so, I don’t know.”
“Wouldn’t want you two to splinch,” she says with a wry smile. “I’m going to start kicking people out, I have work in the morning.”
It’s Monday and the shop is quiet, so Draco is playing Does Your Mother Know and giving Harry disapproving looks when he tries to dance. Harry’s dragged one of the duct taped stools behind the counter and sits next to Draco as he doodles mountains and flowers on the notepad.
“There’s an enormous underwater ship in it, and everyone in this other ship thinks it a huge fish of some kind so they try and kill it,” Draco said. “But they can’t, because it’s a magic underwater boat. I don’t know how muggles come up with these things. It’s not like they can have magic ships, this isn’t Durmstrang.”
Harry looks up, finding Draco looking pressed and neat in the green library light. He’s wearing a dark blue robe, one that means that Harry can see way more of his wrists than he's capable of handling. Harry can’t exactly pinpoint what is so upsetting to him about Draco’s wrists, but he thinks that the longer he looks at them the more upset he’s going to get, so he returns his gaze to firmly to the pile of newspapers. “I thought this was going to go better,” he says glumly, pushing a few towards Draco. “There’s no motive.”
Draco laughs, kissing up Harry’s neck to his ear and lingering there, just breathing. “Do you like me back yet or should I keep trying?”
Harry thinks maybe he needs to drink more, or there need to be more people in here so Ron and Hermione don’t notice the way he doesn’t always react the way he’s supposed to.
“Go apologize.” Anthony appeared at her side, holding Ernie in a loose dance hold. Ernie’s elbow was pointed towards the floor and he still looked terrified that anyone was expecting him to dance. “I don’t know what happened, but even Malfoy isn’t immune to apologies.”
For a moment, Draco hums with incredulous energy, and then he’s lobbed the remains of his drink against the wall and slammed the door behind him, leaving Harry in a soupy gray silence.
“Do you think maybe-” Draco stops, heaves a sigh, looks at the ceiling, then looks back to Harry. “I would like to come with you.”
Draco reached his hand out, slowly like he wasn’t sure he wanted to do it. Harry took his hand before he could snatch it back, feeling his skin and the small bones of his fingers, all undeniably real.
“Muggles know about those?” Draco asks, thinking of the earth magic they learned about, dream catchers and old rites.
“So much wine, so many self destructive coping mechanisms,” Harry says. The truth is, he’s not totally sure how it happened. It had seemed like such a bad and interesting idea that he couldn’t properly resist the impulse when it came to him. From this vantage point, Draco almost seems like a good idea, which makes it scarier than it’s ever been.
She looks less nervous than some of the kids he meets, maybe because she looks to be a little older than the others, edging closer to eleven or twelve.
“Can I pay you to make me a pair?” Blaise asked, looking completely enthralled by the pale blue knit. “They’re really warm.”
“Do you want, I can-” Harry rushed over to the desk, pulling out a bundle of tissues from the tissue box and running back over to present them to Draco, who was still staring out at the snow.
“Suicide jokes? Really?” Draco said, still keeping the vice grip on Harry’s wrist. Draco felt dark watery anger flow through him and he wanted to lash out at the forest somehow, for letting Harry be like this, for not making him anything like Draco wanted. “I’ve never pulled it off and you know it, that’s why I’m still fucking here.”
“You can stay here for as long as you want,” Harry replies, sneaking a glance at Draco. He’s worrying the edge of the blanket with his nervous fingers and his cheeks are blotchy pink.
“Earl gray and lavender,” Draco said. “I haven’t ever had anything else. Pansy thinks it’s bollocks, but its my favorite.”
Harry looked at the place where the lake lapped up on the shoreline, and began to pull at the grass so he wouldn’t worry at his fingers again. “It’s not about debts.”
“Oh, of course,” Connie says. She doesn’t seem to be as affected by the unnatural heat, and Harry can feel his dislike of her quickly mounting as he tries to discreetly daub sweat from his forehead. “She had on one of those big pink hats, the new ones from Madam Malkins, maybe you’ve seen them?”
Rob nods eagerly, like these are perfectly normal questions. Sometimes Harry can’t quite believe the extent to which the wizarding world runs on bullshit bureaucracy and whimsy. “Well, see, Puddlenik is a fiend with preserves and such, and the day I was visiting it was cucumber compote season, which was all well and good because I do love a cucumber compote.” Rob frowns. “But I get there and the toads smell the cucumber and they, well, they escape the basket, because, as I said, they’re fresh. So they escape the basket and you know how toads are with cucumbers.”
Malfoy snorts, a grin cracking his face open and exposing his always too-sharp teeth. “Pull me out of a fire and I’m still Malfoy to you?”
“Why?” she asked, the furrow in her brow growing deeper the longer he talked, like it did in class when she didn’t understand the lesson just yet. There was an ironic amusement in finally being able to stump her. “Why are you apologizing?”
Draco thought that agreeing might give him away, but he wanted to so badly it hurt. “The forest knows how to fix things.”
“Hermione said I looked nice!” Harry had protested, and Draco had let out a pitying sigh and whisked him to The Well Dressed Wizard to pick out something he deemed suitable.
56. “I’m going to need you to stop asking me to be safe,” Draco says, as he puts on his coat the next morning to return to wherever he’s staying now, with some group of Death Eater sympathizers or another. Harry makes an effort not to learn their names. “I don’t know how much longer I can say no to you. Don’t ask me again.”
“I should think our history would make it quite apt,” Draco mumbled, his mouth pressed to the stubble growing on Harry’s cheek. “Who fucks better than enemies?”
“Hermione would be furious with you for this,” Harry said, folding the corner carefully flat. “She hates when people destroy books.”
“I’m not afraid of it,” Harry hissed petulantly, his tongue flicking easily around the syllables like it’d been waiting to do so. Harry disliked the way the snake somehow managed to look knowing.
Harry’s sigh of relief is almost embarrassingly loud. “I don’t entirely know what happened, I found them by accident and then I couldn’t stop going back to see them.” He knows even as he begins that this isn’t going to make any sense, but getting any semblance of words out makes him feel a little better. “I didn’t think it was that weird, or any more weird than normal, and then we both got drunk and they kissed me and I told them that I liked them.” He cringes at the memory. “I think my exact words were ‘I have a crush on you.’”
“They’re high,” Draco clarifies, and then leans down to take Harry’s cock into his mouth. Harry makes a beautiful little noise when Draco does, shifting his hips to thrust into Draco’s mouth. Draco really does want Harry to suck him off too, but, as he undoes the buttons on his trousers and wraps his free hand around his own cock, he has a feeling that that’s just not a very practical goal for tonight.
Hermione will owl or Floo as soon if she needs anything, but in the meantime all they can do is wait, and potentially snack. Though Harry fully intends to help, as soon as he sits in one of Ron’s dining room chairs he immediately decides he’d much prefer to spectate as Ron prepares five sandwiches. Ron has set the radio to play highlights of the most recent Canon’s match, which Harry thinks is a very clever way of letting them all veg out after a startlingly high-octane past few hours.
“You can read her mind?” Harry asked incredulously, part of him rewinding to when he’d been so sure that Draco had been the heir of Slytherin.
Harry shrugs, taking a guilty sip of tea. He can’t imagine Ron’s reaction, but, considering he was the only one to be just as suspicious of Draco as Harry was, it probably won’t be pretty. It’s not like Harry has any justifications for his actions to persuade him. “I’ve been talking to Draco.”
Draco scowled. “Tell yours first. And I’m not telling you all of it.” His breath hopped and he thought about backing out. “And if your secret isn’t good enough you’re not getting anything from me.”
“Oh,” Draco says, pressing a kiss against Harry’s nose. “Can I give you one or will people ask questions?”
Harry raises his wand, noticing the muscle that jumps in Draco’s jaw as he does. He meets his eyes carefully, feeling the familiar calm of preparing to cast a complicated spell. “Legilimens.”
Harry has questions but he doesn’t ask them, even though they’re burning in his throat, and maybe he’s not as fiery as he used to be either. There aren’t any words that convey both that he’s sorry about everything and also that seeing Malfoy makes him feel like he’s eleven again. There’s no way to ask ‘don’t you feel like we’re somehow connected, like we were points of symmetry on different sides of the same line?’ or ‘wouldn’t things have been different if you hadn’t been such a self-obsessed prick or if I’d just taken your fucking hand?’
Draco suspected, though he wouldn’t have let it slip to anyone, that his mysterious affliction was a result of the kiss. As he curled up in his thick, emerald blankets he wondered what the physical effects were of kissing a mirage, if he’d caught some odd kind of cold.
It shouldn’t work like it does, they shouldn’t have been able to fix all the frayed wires and missing parts between them, and yet somehow, it works better than anything else Harry’s ever had.
When Harry slides that note into Draco’s bag he doesn’t think Draco will agree to meet him a second time, but he supposes they both have their reasons.
He managed, maybe for the first time all year, to resist glancing over at the Gryffindor table. It was only the oppressive fear that gripped him at the thought of Harry meeting his eyes that allowed it, but it was the smallest victory.
Invoking Ginny had to have been his third or fourth error. He should have invoked Luna. Classic rookie mistake. “Malfoy, I think you should just kiss Harry since you clearly want to so bad,” Ginny says, very evilly. She hasn’t even bothered to answer his kiwi question.
Draco glowers, fussing anxiously with his straw. “Will she tell? I’m aware that it’s a story. I’m surprised Rita Skeeter hasn’t smoked me out yet.”
“Oh,” Draco said, a small smile curling across his lips as he stared at Harry. “Of course, it’s the forest.”
She nods, the jewels in her hair glinting in the light as her head moves. She has a way of listening that makes Harry feel like she’s never heard anything more interesting and it’s as fascinating as it is disconcerting. “Service, of course.”
Dara seems to weigh it, then shakes her head. “Creative, but probably wrong. This isn’t some random ministry worker— look at our new flat. Whatever we stumbled into, it’s an operation. Kidnapping us is not only stupid, its kinda crazy. Who knows what the long game is— probably some cute little Obliviates, some cover story…” She scowls. “Better hope one of our genius friends on the Aurors break us out of here before that. I’ll be so pissed if I’m Obliviated and don’t know.”
Luna doesn’t seem overly surprised by this question, and this is simultaneously terrifying and slightly irritating.
He wasn’t sure he really believed that, but if he could shove the forest back into a box and forget about her then the humiliation wouldn’t sting so deeply.
He could smell the lake hanging heavy in the air and he bent down to roll his pajama pants up to his knees so they wouldn’t drag in the rising water. The air was warm, thick and humid like the deepest parts of Summer. A bird cawed in the distance, the sound unfamiliar and vaguely tropical. He looked around, finding the oaks and maples replaced with waxy rainforest leaves that dripped slowly into the growing swamp.
When Harry sees Draco leaning up against the sink in a loose tee shirt and dark green pajama bottoms, he nearly has a heart attack. He’d thought he was the only one in the eighth year dorms - everyone else in class or camped out in the library in preparation for their N.E.W.T.S - but there’s Draco, nose pressed nearly to the mirror, a tube of bright red lipstick in his hand.
Shame about Ginevra, I really thought that was going to work out for you. She seemed smitten, you seemed too stupid to tell a friendly tree from a woman. Is it really true you cheated? Seems like an un-saviory thing to do, but I’m sure you’re all torn up after the war and looking for love and affection and whatever. Pansy said she thought it was a bloke, which would just be delicious. I can’t really blame you, we all have our vices.
Nearby, Draco had been busying himself with a book he’d snuck out of the library. Normally, he didn’t sneak books out, but he didn’t particularly want anyone to find him reading this one, despite the fact that he quite liked appearing well read. It was thick, with a worn old cover: ‘20,000 Leagues Under the Sea’ embossed in fancy silver font.
Draco walks over to the loveseat and sits, quiet like he’s trying not to make any noise, all of his former bravado and snark gone. Harry knows he uses them as armor and weapons and yet he’s always surprised by how quickly they fall away. Harry cautiously takes his hand, feeling the immediate pressure of Draco’s fingers squeezing his own.
“No problem,” Draco replies. He knows that to anyone, they wouldn’t even look like acquaintances and it’s bizarre that they ever could have gotten there.
Quietly, without pretense, a soft rustling announced to him the presence of first one tiny snake, and then a few more. Draco clutched his wand more tightly and watched them slither closer to him, wide glassy eyes staring up at him in the dark.
“Have you read 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea?” Draco began slowly, speaking in that voice he’d perfected since the war, the one he used at his mother’s bedside when she was hysterical.
Pansy screams, the rest of the room erupts into pandemonium, and Ginny bonks Harry over the head a few times with a pillow. He takes it rather good naturedly. Why he looks so at home being manhandled is a line of thought Draco cannot possibly emotionally investigate.
“You’re shagging Malfoy and you didn’t bloody tell me?” He replies at full volume, setting his fork down with unnecessary force. “I can’t believe this. You told me when you had a crush on my bloody sister and not Malfoy?”
“The papers say a lot of things about my family,” Draco says, pressing the pen hard against the stack of paper. “Most of them aren’t true, but if we’re just a normal family it’s just so boring.”
Draco presses the long, slender line of his body against Harry’s, sliding his tongue into Harry’s mouth and moving his hand so it splays across Harry’s rib cage, pinning him there. It’s not at all like last time, when everything was so oversaturated and numb and ephemeral, both of them scrabbling for any kind of affection. Draco is kissing him like he’s trying to tell him something and it’s incredible, a sensation not unlike relief.
Draco, at his glance, lets his face fall expressionless, his voice clicking right back into his old drawl, his head at a tilt like a cat and his eyes hard as flint. “Did you have something you were trying to say, Potter?”
“I don’t think you can drive me away by being you,” Harry says, clearing his throat and fighting the blush on his cheeks. “I think everyone around me knew that my hatred for you was just a badly hidden obsession. It’s not really explainable for me, but I couldn’t leave you alone, even when I thought you were a prick.”
“We’re not technically shagging,” Harry protests quietly, unsure if its wise to interrupt Ron mid-tantrum.
“I can’t. Have. This. Conversation. Right now,” Draco says, quite laboriously, and Harry does not kiss him on the nose and tell him that he is a perfect and special treasure, only because he doesn’t think it would draw more of those incredible noises out of Draco’s mouth, which is really his number one priority. Now that Harry thinks about it, he does remember Draco being a bit loud, but he’s really in a position to appreciate it now.
The left side of Draco’s mouth is still quirked up on the side. “I don’t think I quite realized how it would feel to experience this while I’m actually on your side.”
The castle agreed, perhaps for a different reason than the forest did, because while the castle loved Draco Malfoy, the castle also loved Harry Potter with a sharp, mothering passion. The castle felt in her heart that Harry loved her in a way few others did, because she was the first home he’d ever had and they both knew it. The castle knew what most of the students kept in the gilt boxes behind their ribs, and she knew that Harry kept some of her in his, which flattered her greatly.
“Pansy is terribly suspicious,” Draco says, flopping down on the couch and pulling the eggplant blanket over his legs. He looks pleased about the whole thing, and Harry has the paranoid suspicion that he’s enjoying this ‘secret relationship’ thing quite a bit. He thinks he might be having trouble with the idea that Draco is interested in him at all. “Apparently she tried to visit the manor the day I was at yours and none of the house elves knew where I was.”
“Turned around,” Draco whispered. “I’m just turned around.” He pressed his lips back to Harry’s, kissing him with a thorough deepness that surprised Harry after all of his anger. He thought maybe he’d let the rest of it fall away, that the only thing that had to be left was this, just the softness of Draco’s lips as they moved slowly against his, figuring out just how each other kissed.
“And you’ve managed to look over at Draco Malfoy at least three times without compromising our dance routine,” Anthony said, giving her a bright grin.
Harry bites back the cranky remark he wants to make, and instead permits Dara to kick the wall for a solid twenty minutes, during which he develops a headache he can only sufficiently describe as a catastrophe.
“Think I haven’t let dumb things get to me?” Ron said, and Harry could hear deprecating smile in his voice.
Harry has a vivid flashback to when Draco went to go intimidate Pansy’s new boyfriend and has a horrible realization about the sort of vetting process he’s about to be subject to. He doesn’t think he’s ever done a single thing that would impress Blaise Zabini and can’t imagine he’ll manage it now.
“First thing, I don’t have a boyfriend, Second, I never do paperwork unless I can help it, and Thirdly, neither do you,” Harry says, which makes Dara laugh more.
“None of your business, thanks,” Harry says, hoping that the darkness will hide his blush as he finally wrests the shock blanket out of his pack and throws it over Draco’s body, curled and pale on the edge of someone’s petunias. He’s better, covered in the blanket, because it means that even if Harry really wants to look at him, he can’t.
“Is it true then, that you died?” She asks, setting a plate of rather strange looking biscuits in front of them.
“Plenty of monsters in this forest,” Draco said. “I think if we were going to get attacked we’d have crossed that bridge quite a while ago.”
Draco doesn’t speak, just grabs him by side of the head and presses their lips together with a serious kind of pressure. The lipstick makes everything feel strange and Harry thinks it's probably going to smear, especially as Draco moves his lips and Harry moves his in response, reaching for Draco’s waist or shirt or anything to pull him closer.
“Can I do anything?” she asked. Annoyance sparked up his spine even though he knew she was just trying to be nice.
“So that was weird, right?” Ron whispered as soon as they turned the corner. “Was that the most bizarre shit ever or am I losing it?”
“You aren’t going to win this,” Harry says. He’s only regained about twenty percent of his brain function and has just learned that he’s not really above begging, at all, even a little. “I’m so buff. My job is being buff. Your job is what? Being smart and stirring? My job is at least forty percent punching. If you make me wrestle you in this shower I may pull down the curtain in the process but I will win.”
“I had no idea,” Draco says, and it’s not pitying, just quiet and understanding. “My parents were lovely to me.”
“Just watching everyone,” Harry said, just a little pleased to have Draco’s undivided attention again. Watching her interact with the Gryffindors was thrilling, if quite stressful. Draco seemed determined to play nice, but it was still an exercise in hoping no one snapped and decided to fist fight. “I can’t knit, so.”
“This is not a problem anyone but you is having, Potter,” Draco says imperiously. His misdirection campaign is going fantastically. “You’re the common denominator in all of these kissing situations. You are the kiss-ee. The reigning king of slagdom.”
“Are we discussing the magical circumstances of Harry’s near death?” Ron put in, leaving a discussion with Neville about their homework to join the conversation. “My favorite circus trick, that. Do you think we could get him to do it on command? Maybe make a traveling show out of it?”
Harry tries to find his words back and but can’t seem to find the right ones. “I can’t begin to figure you out.”
“Had some interesting experiences with tea already this morning,” Harry replies, feeling especially morose. He’s forgotten how much he loves a good wallow, and thinks that’s probably not the best recollection to come upon.
Harry placed her hand carefully on Anthony’s shoulder as he moved his to her waist, both careful not to touch each other too much.
“We are trying our best at civility!” Harry protested, even though she knew they were right. She’d always hated Malfoy but it had never been that simmering righteous hatred she’d felt for Umbridge or the ire she’d felt for Snape but something that bordered much more closely on obsession. It’s not like she didn’t know, but the fact that everyone else seemed to know and drew their own conclusions was unsettling.
Potter’s eyes flick away and it takes all of Draco’s willpower not to tick his chin back up so they’re eye to eye again. Every part of him pouts ‘look at me’ and he counts the times Potter blinks so he won’t act on anything.
“Not entirely,” Harry said, looking over at the mirror to inspect the damage. He was worried about his scarf covering it, Draco had placed it irritatingly high. He had the feeling the forest hadn’t invented that bit, it seemed like the sort of irritating shite Real Draco would do too.
“How was everything?” Lee asks, sidling up to their table. It’s still dark outside, but the deeply quiet part of night that’s already thinking about becoming dawn in soft purples. The restaurant has quieted too, only a few stray night-shifters drinking coffee and shuffling newspapers over the hum of the jukebox.
“Not like, in a weird way, just like. I know people are scared of me. I know they think that I’m a monster.”
He reaches for Harry’s wrist, holding it between his fingers and studying it with gray eyes fixed in concentration. “I’m going to tell you a secret.”
“Don’t make me have to,” he replies, and doesn’t soften it. Harry feels like he deserves that. When he leaves, the sun is beginning to set, and he walks the way back to the alley deep in thought. He’s beginning to understand that Draco is becoming a fixation again, that somehow or another they’ve circled back to a strange amalgam of what they used to be, where this time, Harry tries to get under his skin and Draco stays ambivalent and elusive. He wonders when Draco’s going to stop humoring him, when he’ll give up the charade and tell him to stay out of his life.
“Nothing,” Harry said firmly, slapping his hand over the bruise on his neck and cursing himself for not locking the door. He’d thought Ron would have been able to spell it off, hadn’t been so pessimistic as to think he’d be stuck with the biggest bruise known to man on his neck all day.
Harry laughed and promised he would, his retort bleeding into Draco’s next question as the forest held them careful and loved in her arms, feeling like she’d finally shoved them together in the right way, finally found the places they hurt and stitched them up again.
“I think that’s an interesting response,” Luna says. “It would be surprising, I think, to many people.”
“Potter,” he begins. He can do this. If there’s anything Malfoys are good at, it’s high stakes social rituals. “May I kiss you.”
“I could really tell, what with you smoking out here all by yourself,” Potter responds, too close to be looking at him like that. Like he’s on fire too. Like they’re both on fire, like they’re going to burn this house down if they’re not careful. Like he doesn’t care.
“Sure,” Harry says, and Draco is moderately vindicated by the fact that Harry’s voice sounds at first like it’s not going to work.
Friday evening, he finds himself at a secondhand store buying an old, broken radio. He wants to pretend that it isn’t a conscious choice, but it was out of his way and he knows he’s doing it for a reason. He doesn’t go to the repair shop immediately, waiting until Saturday morning to trudge through the bustling streets.
“You probably could,” Harry replies, although he can’t think of anything Draco might say that would make him feel that old animosity.
Draco glances up, quickly, just long enough to catch Harry’s gaze and drop it again. “Everyone always made it sound very fashionable.”
Harry resists the urge to roll his eyes, which will only make Draco bristle further. “I thought as much.”
Harry doesn’t understand how Merope could think that boy could love her, her drugged and fooled lover, how she could imagine that when she stopped poisoning him he would stay with her. He is glad that Dumbledore doesn’t have that memory to place into his hands, the one where Tom’s father finds out and leaves. Truthfully, he can picture it well enough.
Harry sits there, feeling as if he’d been recently dragged from the bottom of a especially discomforting lake. Finally, when he can think of nothing else to do, he gathers his things and Floos home, the workday barely half over.
“I can’t wait,” Draco replied, sounding as if she’d rather die, and Harry had to stifle a giggle as she headed towards the Ravenclaw tower to learn all about Fiber Art.
“Terribly sorry, Mr. Potter. Someone already made me an offer about the toads,” she says, at which point he blacks out.
“Thanks,” Harry says, lingering in the middle of the kitchen. “We busted that dragon smuggling ring, rescued a bunch of Feathered Northerns.”
“I do not look like that,” Harry says, then, when Draco just laughs, repeats his objection even louder.
She scoots forward in her chair, resting her chin on her palm. “We can twenty questions it if it’s easier.”
Harry nodded, pausing only to move Ernie’s elbow level before following Draco out into the hallway, finding her standing with her arms crossed by the drinking fountain like she’d been waiting for Harry to show up.
“You’re welcome.” Draco takes a sip of his tea, sitting terribly straight and watching him. “Potter. Why are you here?”
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and pushed them into position in silence, already looking like she was close to smashing Harry into pieces. Harry wasn’t sure if this was better than when Draco was being snippy, as it made her feel like a piece of cardboard that Draco was reluctantly dancing with.
“So you’re still out for power?” Harry asks, feeling suddenly bare even though he’s the one who can’t leave Draco alone. He supposes he’d always wanted power too, loved the way magic gave him a way to be in control, gave him something to be other than the boy under the stairs. It’s different, but still the same.
Harry looks briefly pleased to be touched and then immediately unhappy. “Are you getting come on my face right now.”
Draco smiles, thin lipped and hiding his teeth, but not cold. “Don’t thank me. The first night, I thought I was going to have to trick you into helping me. I’m glad I haven’t had to.”
“Quite,” Draco says, an unmistakable gleam of pride in his eyes. “A convenience of having my own shop means that I can brew my own lycanthropy potion without anyone knowing I take it. The potion I took last night was from next month’s batch, and someone, somehow, has tampered with it.”
Draco, who has been looking just about everywhere other than Harry, finally looks at him. It’s horrible. Everywhere that his face isn’t brown, it is bright red, namely the tips of his ears and the apples of his cheeks. He looks so cute and terrified that Draco entirely forgets what he’s supposed to be saying and to what purpose.
“Really?” Harry replied, then tried to school her face into something that wasn’t abject shock when something dark came into Draco’s expression.
