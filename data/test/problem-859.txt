Draco was walking past a door that led outside when it was opened slowly, Harry poking his head in. He froze as Harry’s gaze fell on him. “Er, hi?”
“More than amazing,” Ron concurs, looking down at Hermione in her one shoulder, floor length black dress with the slit up the leg. “Brilliant, I’d say.”
“It’s your spot,” Draco protests.
Harry’s hand flies up, tussling his almost shoulder length hair. “And you’re keeping yours short. Are you just going to spout facts about me all night?”
“Get out.” Hermione tells the boys, moving and pulling Ron off the window sill and pushing him towards the door.
“Right. Thanks.” Draco replies, not looking over to Harry.
“Oh it was, was it?” Harry asks, running a hand through his messy hair.
“You’re crying. Must be something wrong.” Ron stares at him with sympathetic eyes.
Harry rolled his eyes, tugging his clothes off right there in front of Draco. As much as Draco hated to do it, he tore his gaze away and didn’t look up again until the bathroom door had shut behind Harry. Of course he should’ve just closed his bed curtains because he nearly chokes on his spit when Harry walks out in just a low hanging towel.
“Potions class? Husband?” Draco sounds out, looking at his healer with wide eyes.
“It looks like a rats nest,” Draco disagrees looking to Pansy. “Give me your brush.”
They stay that way, Draco reading and Harry trying hard not to stare, until Ron and Hermione fall asleep on each other. It seems as though Draco was waiting for the very moment they passed out because he marks his page and sets the book aside. “How was your Christmas?”
Granger rolls her eyes. “Not what I meant.”
“I don’t like tea,” Harry states as they approach the door.
“Harry James Potter!” Molly shouts, smacking him on the head with a towel. “Draco Malfoy was a young boy who’s parents forced him into things he should’ve never been introduced to. How do you think he felt, walking down to his parents, away from all his friends and into Voldemort’s arms?”
Harry leads him to a spot by the lake and conjures a large blanket for them sit on. Draco sits after Harry does, bending one leg at the knee to rest his arm on it. “You really like it here.”
Draco thinks on how to reply before he says, “You’re right. I hated you in early September. You saved my life and I just hated you, wanted nothing to do with you at all. Why would I possibly want to have you now?”
“Harry, please, I didn’t want mean to-“
“I’m sorry, I didn’t even think. I should’ve invited you to the Weasley’s with us.” Harry hurries to say and Draco waves him off.
Harry blinks down at him. “You’re gay?”
“That’s not true. They wish you hadn’t been forced to be there.” Harry explains, hoping Draco believe his words. “They know you were just a boy trying to please his parents.”
Draco nearly questions who Potter was speaking too in the woods but, he already knows the answer so he just responds, “And risk getting yourself in trouble?”
in the woods last night?” Draco counters, arching his eyebrows.
Both boys look to the owner of the voice and Harry greets them, “Headmistress McGonagall.”
“Shut up! I haven’t been
Harry sends Draco a glare but drags the brush through his hair all the same. His hair poofs out and he lets out a little groan before stealing a hair tie off of Hermione’s wrist and pulling his locks into a bun on the back of his head. “Better?”
“Dance?” Draco asks, eyes wide. “You want me to dance?”
Harry sends her a confused look. “What do you mean?”
“Ah, I see. So Weasley is just a sheep to be led?” Draco says in amusement.
Once the attention is off of him, he turns to Harry. “Thank you. You don’t have to take me, I’m sure you have someone you’d rather take.”
guy!” Pansy told him, smile wide and eyes hopeful.
Which is how he finds himself following Potter, at a safe distance, into the sparse woods and over to the lake. Potter’s never gone outside the castle, usually just wanders the halls late at night with a vacant look in his eye. Draco shivers against the night air and had he known Potter was just going to stare out on the lake for an hour, he’d have brought his coat. He’s getting ready to leave Potter to freeze by himself when Potter speaks, “This seems a bit silly. But I… I don’t know how else to talk to you.”
“A very dangerous action for you, Potter.”
“Well, Luna and Neville have been together since summer. Ron and Hermione, the same. Dean is still pretending not to be making heart eyes at Blaise every chance he gets,” Ginny explains, Dean turning bright red. “And I have my little secret admirer. You’re the only one luckless in love.”
He wakes with a gasp, sitting up abruptly. “Did it work?”
Draco looks at the little girl then to Potter who’s moving towards him with a smile on his face. “
“This one’s quite personal,” Ginny says, folding the paper up and slipping it under her robes before anyone can take it from her hands.
“Then she’s the stupidest girl alive,” Draco tells her and Pansy sends him a smile. He sighs when her eyes wander back to the Gryffindor table. “Just- Go over there after lunch and ask if you can speak with her. If she says she’s not interested, we can skip the rest of our classes and I’ll buy you all the chocolate you want at Hogsmeade this weekend.”
“I’m- I’m not day dreaming about a death eater!” Harry says in anger, instantly regretting it.
He has a plan to talk to Harry the second he gets back and grovel until Harry accepted his apology. But, when everyone arrives, Draco chickens out and stays shut in his room the entire day. The first morning back to classes, he convinced the elves to let him eat in the kitchens because he’s too afraid to enter the Great Hall.
“No, I don’t hate you.” Harry tells him, using his thumb to wipe a stray tear on Draco’s cheek. “I don’t like things you’ve done. But.. as Hermione puts it, I’ve always been a bit obsessed with you.”
Ten years later at their Hogwarts reunion, everyone will let them know that everyone had been making bets on them since before Christmas holidays. That no one was surprised when Harry kissed Draco, only surprised that it took them that long to admit it to everyone.
“You don’t need to apologize for her actions,” Granger says in a stern voice, cutting him. “I accept your apology for the rest of it but you don’t need to apologize for her.”
Draco swallows hard and looks down. Harry grabs Draco’s chin with a firm hand and tilts his face up to look at him. “Which is when I told you that you’re worth the fucking world. And then well, we fight about who really kissed who but, you get the picture.”
Draco doesn’t know how to act, he hasn’t been hugged so tightly since, Merlin, he can’t even remember. Potter sighs as Granger pulls back. Weasley is pulling him in then and he says, “She should feel bad. It could’ve ended up a lot worse.”
“You- You, too, Malfoy.” Harry stammers before turning and walking towards Ron and Hermione, who are sporting identical grins. “Not a word. Not a fucking word.”
Draco silently mourned the loss of the long locks. “Right. Of course.”
He watches with a pit in his stomach as Harry walks back to the school.
“Are you- Did I do something?”
“Sure, Draco. A friend.” Draco tries to decipher the emotion written on Harry’s face but it’s gone in second; Harry turning away to face Ron and making a joke about Seamus dating Lavender now.
“No reason we can’t help it along.” Harry says in a strange tone.
“Well, I was just-“ Draco starts.
She holds him and makes him match her breathing for ten minutes until he’s calm. He pulls away and she settles a worried look on his face. “What was that about?”
“Don’t worry about him, Mum, he’s too busy day dreaming about Malfoy.” Ron quips and Harry’s head snaps up.
“And why would I be talking to Weasley?” Draco asks.
“You’re taller,” Draco states before he can stop himself.
“It’s- It’s nothing against you. I would understand if you did.” Draco explains, fiddling with the bottom of Harry’s shirt. “I just thought it would hurt less if you didn’t know how much I really care for you. Or if people didn’t know. Or if you didn’t… If we didn’t..”
“C’mon, there must be somebody you find fit,” Pansy whined before blowing on his nails to dry them.
Harry looks over his shoulder, eyes falling on Malfoy, who’s laughing at something Blaise said. He looks back to Ginny and shrugs. “I’m just.. taking some time.”
wedding dresses.”
“How are you feeling?” Granger asks, cutting Potter off.
“You left after you heard what you wanted to hear!” Harry’s voice was hard and angry and it terrified Draco.
“Nothing is wrong.” Draco says, looking up at Harry. “I just want to get my things put away.”
Harry recoils back like he’s been stung and Draco pushes back from the table and snaps, “For someone who supposedly loves me, you sure are cruel.”
Harry licks his lips, nodding. Draco’s barely gotten the words out of his mouth before Harry’s kissing him again. They stumble back against the bed, Draco falling back when the back of his knees hit the bed. Harry follows him down, both of them moving up agains the pillows.
Draco could swear Harry is holding back laughter as he says, “Goodnight, Draco.”
Draco decides on a change of subject, “Why Astra?”
“I.. I was the one in the woods that night.” Draco can see the anger take over Harry’s face. “I didn’t mean to listen in. I didn’t even think-“
“I didn’t know,” Harry says, his voice low.
McGonagall looks to Draco for confirmation. He speaks only when Harry elbows him, “Yes, precisely. I wouldn’t want Harry to get killed by some sort of uh, creature when he’s just survived taking down Voldemort.”
Draco’s chest tightens when Harry turns and starts walking away from him. He scrambles to his feet, having to do a slight run to catch up to the taller boy. “Harry, I’m sorry!”
“I know.” Draco looks down at his hands, trying desperately not to cry. “I just can’t take seeing him look at me the way he did before.”
“You’ve been calling me that a lot lately.” Harry says into the darkness. “You’ve been whispering my name for two weeks.”
They spend the rest of lunch perfecting what Pansy is going say to Weaslette. When the lunch bell rings, Pansy’s face grows panicked and Draco sighs. “Go! I’ll be close in case we have to skip classes. Which we won’t because I’m sure she’s going to say yes.”
“Is that was brought on the two buns? And God, the frustration that he had trying to learn those stupid braids.” Ron lets out a groan at the thought of his best friend doing his hair.
“Yeah, I uh, I come here to talk to Sirius,” Harry confesses and Draco suddenly feels guilty.
“Malfoy, I’m- I’m sorry.” Harry says, tone sad and eyes sympathetic. “I never thought us being friends would affect your home life.”
Harry’s quiet for a long pause before, “Okay, we’ll go today.”
.” Harry nearly shouts and then Draco swallows him down. Harry lets out a moan so loud that Draco wonders if the silencing spell is going to conceal it. “Fuck, fuck, fuck. Feels so good.”
Draco must fall asleep reading one before he’s startled awake when Harry comes in the front door. He waits a moment before asking, “Where’s Astra?”
They’re laughing together and Harry’s shoulder brushes his. Draco takes a deep breath and settles a look on Harry. “How did we happen?”
Harry pressed a firm kiss to Draco’s forehead. “I’m not going anywhere, love. I’m here to stay. No matter what, okay? I love you.”
Harry looks to Draco and nods. “C’mon, I had dinner waiting in the oven for us.”
“From me.” Draco tells her, raising his eyebrows in a challenge. “I find it hardly fair that you can tutor Ron in the subjects he’s having a hard time in but Potter shouldn’t benefit from my tutoring.”
would do; answer honestly, “I have nightmares sometimes. Walking around, reading about some professor who used to work here ages ago or about a quidditch match Hufflepuff won, it helps to distract me and make me tired enough to fall back asleep.”
He eats a roasted lamb, potatoes and asparagus as Astra babbles to them both. Harry leaves him alone in the kitchen to give Astra a bath and put her to bed. Draco can’t sit with his thoughts so he stands and begins hand washing the dishes from dinner.
Harry smiles and grasps Draco’s wrist. “It’s quite alright, I’m used to you overreacting.”
Harry’s face falls and Draco must’ve said something wrong. “No. I think we should wait until the memories comes back.”
“Our daughter’s name was Asterope, meaning starry-face or lightning.” Draco says in one breath, his pointer finger tracing Harry’s scar. “Astra for short meaning of the stars. Poppy for the flowers I bring you when you’re cross with me.”
Harry cuts him off, “I go down to the lake to clear my head at night, I get terrible nightmares from the war. I thought I heard something a couple nights ago so, I asked Malfoy if he’d be willing to meet me at the door when I came in. Just to make sure I was okay.”
Harry carries him up the steps and makes love to him that night and Draco will never forget the look of absolute love and adoration on Harry’s eyes when he came inside of Draco.
“No, it’s fine. Maybe after Christmas Hols, you can meet him?” Pansy suggested with a hopeful smile.
Harry looks over to Draco and asks, “Would you dance with me?”
“No! I left before-“
spot.
Ron shakes his head. “Nah, pretty sure it’s a bloke. He everyone a month ago he gay, or at least bi. He’d wanted everyone to know because he thought this one guy was cute. Never told us who.”
“Only for you, Potter.”
Harry rolls his eyes with a fond expression on his face. He brings his hand up, his fingers trailing the line of Draco’s jaw. He brings a thumb over to trace Draco’s bottom lip. Draco stands very still, looking up at Harry with parted lips.
“You’re so dramatic,” Pansy whines with an exasperated tone. “What’re you fighting about?”
Harry looks annoyed before he says, “Do I have to do everything myself?”
“Well, obviously we came to sit with you,” Hermione tells him in an obvious tone. “Plus, it’s the warmest part of the library.”
“Maybe they will. But I’m tired of waiting for memories that I might never have.” Draco says quietly, drawing circles on Harry’s chest. “If the memory retrieval doesn’t work at least then we’ll know and we can get on with making new memories and having a life.”
Draco looks up from his notes when Ron and Hermione find their way to his table in the library. “What bring you two here?
The next morning at breakfast, Draco pointedly did not look at Potter. He took his seat, ate his toast and sipped his tea like a normal human being. If he kept his head down and didn’t look at Potter for a week or two, he could go back to keeping an eye on him. Then someone is sitting down beside him and when Draco looks over it’s Potter. He quirks an eyebrow and asks, “Can I help you, Potter?”
The couple nods and Draco walks stiffly to Harry. Harry pulls out his wand and Draco blinks before their standing in front of a large country home, cold air swirling around them.
“If that’s your story,” Draco taunts, looking back down at his notes, “Are you staying? There’s plenty of room at my table, nobody finds it fun to sit with a Malfoy anymore.”
“Never mind, I should’ve know better,” Harry spits out, hands going to gather his books.
Harry stares down at him with an unreadable expression. His hair was cropped short on the sides, long at the top and styled carefully so it resembled that of his hair in fifth year. “It was too much work.”
“Er, yeah.” Harry’s cheeks flame and he shuffles his feet. “I’m 6’4 now. Mrs. Weasley said it’s like it happened overnight.”
And for all that Draco’s done, he doesn’t know what good deed he did to deserve seeing Harry bend over his desk in just a towel. Draco takes a steadying breath, hoping Harry can’t feel Draco’s eyes on his ass. Draco slams his book closed and stands, “I uh, I just remembered I- I have to go.”
Harry licks his lip before opening them to say something but, he’s cut off by the sound of someone calling from the other end of the hall, “Mr. Potter? Mr. Malfoy?”
“I don’t know why you started with love letters in the first place,” Draco tells her with an exasperated tone.
Halloween passes without a party, much to Luna’s dismay. They’re a week into November and Draco isn’t surprised when Blaise tells them he’s going to sit with Dean at the Gryffindor table. He also isn’t suspired when he greets Dean with a kiss before settling in beside him and joining in the conversation like he’s meant to be there. Draco’s gaze wanders, finding Harry, who is letting Luna pull his hair back into a French braid.
“What did you expect me to say?”
“Dunno.” Harry responds, gathering his things and following Ron and Hermione to a carriage.
“Well.. I’m just- I didn’t think-“ Harry cuts his own stammering off with a sigh. He closes his eyes for a moment and takes a breath. “I just meant, that I’m glad. I didn’t realize it. I’m glad we can be after everything that’s happened.”
“I just.. I need to… go.”
The night of Slughorn’s party, Draco breathes deeply as he smoothes out his outfit. Ginny, Hermione and Pansy had picked it out the Saturday before at Hogsmeade. He wore a dark green turtleneck underneath a black blazer, black slacks and a pair loafers. He checked his hair once more before leaving his room and heading upstairs.
Chatter resumes between everyone once they realize the two single boys aren’t going to throw any tantrums at being left behind by their friends. Draco wonders why he’s suddenly nervous at the thought of spending a whole day with Harry alone.
“GQ?” Draco’s question was drowned out by the noise of the party when Harry opened the door. They walked in, arms linked, and made their way across the room to where Ron and Hermione stood.
He walked through random hallways, looking at pictures on the walls to try and calm his mind. This was usually a surefire way to make him sleepy enough to go back to bed without having to distract his mind from thought of the past couple of years.
Draco snorts at the thought of a Gryffindor who could’ve easily been Slytherin and the worst of the worst Slytherins raising a Hufflepuff daughter. “Think of the headlines.”
Draco watches as Harry sets down the girl, Astra, and she runs into the house. “This is home?”
Draco thought of Harry towering over him, hand tussling his long hair, light stubble on his face. “No, there’s nobody.”
He knew there was no way Potter would know for sure that he was the one in the woods. But, as Potter had put it, he’d been watching him.
“Maybe warn someone before you do that?” Draco says, making Harry laugh softly before pulling back in close to rest their head together.
“Hm,” Draco says, not trusting his voice. Who? Who was it that Harry had found cute? Who did he have a crush on? Why did feel so jealous of him?
Draco has the urge to pull Harry’s tie off and see if the blush goes all the way down his chest. He shakes his head to clear it before yawning. Harry moves off the bed, “You must be tired.”
Pansy smiles and stands with him, “Let’s go to dinner.”
Harry finds it hard to concentrate on anything that holiday. He’s too caught up in his own mind, wondering if Draco is having a good Christmas. If Draco’s family is treating him well. If Draco is missing him as much as Harry misses him.
“Damn it, Malfoy.” Harry spits out, sitting up in bed. “I don’t care that you dreamt about me.”
“I don’t care.” Harry retorts with a snort. “Besides, in case you haven’t noticed, they’re all quite in love with each other. I mean, when did Seamus and Lavender even start dating?”
“Well. Must be weird.” Weasley comments and Draco snorts.
“Oh,” Harry says in small voice.
“Thanks for that, they probably think I’m plotting to steal your soul now,” Draco says harshly, rolling his eyes, “Go back to your friends, Potter. Nobody was spying on you.”
Draco gives Hermione a small smile. “How was your Christmas?”
“I didn’t know they were.” Draco answers, eyebrows drawn together. “Probably because I’ve spent the better of the semester staring at you.”
When he awakes the next morning, there’s a note on the kitchen counter.
“Trust me, they’re insufferable,” Harry agrees, pulling Draco away from the couple. They spend the next hour making small talk with everyone and assuring everyone they’re only here as friends.
at the sight of Harry’s tears spilling over onto his cheeks. “I just wanted to make sure you were alright!”
Draco nods, “Usually, I would. But, we’re friends now and I thought you’d appreciate the gesture of me being honest.”
When they enter the Great Hall, Draco pushes his anxiety down and follows Pansy to the Gryffindor table. He pushes it down when everyone looks at him with surprised looks. And he especially pushes it down when Harry looks at with surprise and anger when he takes his usual seat between Dean and Harry.
Draco nods and let’s himself relax a little. They have a cup of tea and Hermione leaves him a couple books on memory triggering before she has to get back to Hogwarts.
The following morning finds Draco waiting outside the front doors for Harry. Pansy and Blaise had left him already to join Ginny and Dean. He shivered against the October air and pulling his winter jacket more tightly around him. He looked towards the hill where everyone was walking before he looked back to see Harry sauntering towards him. When he was close enough to hear, Draco starts. “Finally, I’ve been waiting out in the cold for ages.”
She eyes them both suspiciously before telling them, “I’m not sure I believe that you two are suddenly friends but, never the matter. Detention for you both tomorrow with Slughorn. Off to bed with you both.”
Harry grins and shakes his head. “No, you’re a sap for most everybody you care about. You just don’t hide it with me.”
He’s cut off by the door flinging open. Draco’s eyes widen at the sight of Harry fucking Potter standing there, holding a small girl in his arms. There’s a full beard on his face and his hair is long and pulled back into a low bun. Potter sets the small girl down and she runs to Draco’s side with a huge smile on her face. “Daddy, you’re okay!”
When he arrived where Harry was standing, he made a joke, “I see the hairbrush I got you was put to good use today. You look great.”
Draco sends him a small smile before picking his book up and resuming. It’s not ten minutes and Harry is holding very still because Draco Malfoy has fallen asleep on his shoulder. He carefully grabs Draco’s books and marks it before pushing it between his thigh and the wall of the train. He sits still as a statue until the train comes to a halt and Draco jerks awake.
“I only wanted to go to get answers from Slughorn for Dumbledore.” Harry stands, holding out a hand to Draco. “C’mon, lets ditch it.”
“Morning.” Draco whispers before he says, “I think we should try the memory retrieval.”
Their part of the table grows quiet before Luna says, “We’re all going on dates.”
They manage to keep it hidden for most of the semester. It’s the second week of June. McGonagall agrees to let the eighth years hold a small get together, not a party she insists, in an empty classroom.
“He really is glad you’re his friend, you know.” Draco turns his head to see Granger is standing and walking away from him.
Harry purses his lips before spitting out, “Fine. But if I find out you were listening in on private conversations, I’ll tell McGonagall.”
irresistible.”
Draco hesitates, looking down and then back up at Harry. “I told him it wasn’t possible. That I wouldn’t give up our friendship to appease him. But- He wants nothing to do with me if I’m friends with you. It’s a hard thing to overcome, the loss of a parent who doesn’t
“He was fussing with his hair in his room,” Hermione answers, rolling her eyes. “I think he has a crush on someone but he won’t admit it to anyone.”
“I’ll buy you another.” Harry mumbles on his way to kiss down Draco’s fucking lovely neck, sucking a purple/red spot that has Draco letting out breathy little moans. “I think something was said about you sucking me off.”
“Good thing I asked you first.”
“I wanted to be with my Mum. It’s hard for her, to reconcile with the fact that the man she married isn’t the same man who sleeps in her bed.” Draco confessed and Harry reaches out and squeezes his wrist. “Besides, the Weasley’s probably hate me. I was on the side of the war that killed their son.”
“Granger, I
He was glad that not many 8th year Slytherins had returned, it meant everybody left had gotten their own rooms. Which in turn, meant that Draco didn’t wake anybody up with his nightmares caused him to cry out in his sleep. He shivered against the chill in the air, never seeming to get warm after Voldemort had turned their house into a fucking icebox.
“Of course.” Harry blurts, gathering up his books, scarf and mittens and throwing them in the overhead compartment. Draco settles his things in the same place before siting beside Harry and promptly opening a book.
“Mr. Malfoy, you’re awake!” The healer says, smiling as she sets his chart down. “Do you know where you are?”
They kiss chastely for a moment before Harry’s tongue swipes along Draco’s bottom lip, making Draco gasp against Harry’s lips. Harry smiles into the kiss before pulling away, nipping at Draco’s bottom lip as he does. Draco takes few deep breaths, staring up at Harry with wide eyes. Harry’s mouth twitches before smiling a little and asking, “Was that okay?”
“If… If it was about us, together, it could be.” Harry starts, voice shaky. “Real, I mean. You and I.”
“Were
Harry’s laughter peters out and he swallows hard. “Are you sure you don’t want to wait until they come back?”
He doesn’t want to sleep that night, afraid he’ll see Harry and Astra. He doesn’t know how to.... move on from that. How do you move on from that sort of thing? It’s like- It’s like they’ve died. He has to press a fist to his mouth to muffle the sob that rips from his chest.
Draco stands there, arms dangling at his side and doesn’t know what to say. He then blurts out, “I’m sorry.”
“Did you need something?” Harry asks and Draco notices they’re alone now, everyone moving inside for lunch.
“You’re so convinced it’s a girl.” Harry retorts, shaking his head.
that maybe we could be friends.”
“Uh, yes,” Draco says, drawing the words out. “That’s been a pretty known fact since fifth year.”
Harry turns slightly to look at him before turning back to his paper. “Hermione told me some potions that have been known to help with memory recovery. They don’t interfere but rather coax the mind into remembering. I thought we could go to Diagon Alley and find some things.”
“I just know. I have a name picked out.” Draco tells him and Harry nods for him to go on. “Asterope Poppy Malfoy-Potter.”
They sneak out for walks at night, usually involving Harry pushing Draco against a tree and kissing him senseless. They still get into spats, arguing with each other until one of them snaps and surges forward for a biting kiss. It.. works. Not they thought it wouldn’t, they’ve always been good at making this push and pull thing work the way they wanted it to.
Draco pulls out his wand, closing his eyes tightly as he hears Potter stands and start walking into the forest. He quickly says a disillusion charm. He stands perfectly still and doesn’t make a fucking noise until Potter gives up and goes back inside.
Draco grabs the same plate he used the night before and sits, grabbing a few waffles. “What are we doing today?”
“Did you apologize?” Luna asks.
“Narcissa is a strong and terrifying woman.” Harry comments, making Draco huff out a laugh.
“As you wish, love.”
What he doesn’t bank on is Harry kissing him first. He’d just gotten back from a pick up game of quidditch with Blaise, Dean and Seamus. Draco had looked up over his book and raked his eyes over Harry’s dirty clothes with a disapproving look. “I hope you plan on showering before you get into your bed. I don’t want to smell you all night.”
Potter is silent as he crouches in front of Draco, who’s sitting on the edge of the bed now. He slips a pair of charcoal grey slacks past Draco’s ankles and when his hands reach his knees, Draco reaches out and grasps Potter’s wrist. Potter finally looks up and Draco can see the tears falling freely and unashamed. Draco can remember a time when he would’ve teased Potter for crying. It doesn’t seem possible now.
The first day of eighth year, Harry and Draco form a truce. They’ll cease the angry looks, the foul tones, the always at each others throats, and all the back and forth. Of course, they’re still Harry and Draco so they get into spats often. Mostly about Harry’s arm bumping his while they’re studying in the library. Or about how Draco wakes absurdly early, grunting out push-ups and sit-ups making Harry rip open his bed curtains and then they’re off. More importantly, they become sort of… friends.
Somehow, Draco drifts back to sleep.
They leave for Christmas break the day after he and Harry fight. Pansy is spending Christmas with the Weasley’s, her parents being in Azkaban for supporting Voldemort. Blaise and Dean are spending Christmas Eve at Blaise’s and Christmas Day at Dean’s. Luna and Neville were spending Christmas at Hogwarts. Draco’s sure that Harry is with the Weasley’s as well.
Days pass quickly after that, Astra going off to her private tutors for schooling. He and Harry spend most days talking of different things they’ve done. Their wedding, how Astra become about, Ron and Hermione’s trying for a baby, where the rest of their class ended up. Draco tells Harry stories about his childhood that he’s probably already heard but Harry listens with a steady gaze and attentive ear. They both grow impatient with Draco’s memories not coming back.
He’s laying beside Harry for seconds before Harry’s rolling over, tugging Draco’s black slacks and briefs down. Draco’s hips lift off the bed at the release of his dick and he gasps when Harry starts wanking him off with a lubed up hand.
They wait until the headmistress turns to head back around the corner before Harry turns back to face him. “Next time you have a nightmare, you should come to the lake. It’s very peaceful.”
?” Ron drawls out, face screwed up in disgust.
Potter takes a deep breath, sniffling and Draco wants to reach out, comfort him. But Draco Malfoy is the last person Potter would ever want comfort from. “Malfoy has been watching me like I’m going to start screaming at any second.”
It’s two days after Harry realizes they’re friends, a couple weeks before Christmas break. He finds Draco at their usual table, hidden in a back corner. He sinks into the chair across from Draco. “So, we’re friends.”
“Harry?”
Draco hits his chest lightly and they both laugh. They both quiet after a moment and Draco whispers, “I can see how we’d be happy together. How we are, were? Happy together.”
“Perhaps,” Draco agrees. If there was one thing Draco was unsure of, it was if Harry would ever forgive him.
Draco sighs and decides to do what a
Something that they haven’t felt without a lurking danger for a long time.
“Draco, the outfit really does look amazing on you,” Hermione tells him when they get close enough.
“Poppy?”
“It’s fine,” Harry protests, tussling the long curls. “I’ve got a nice bed head thing going on.”
“Oh?” Draco raises his eyebrows. “Let’s see, then.”
“Don’t worry, everyone knows Ron would do anything for you. As would Harry.” Draco lays back down, staring up into the leaves and reveling in the warmth of the sun.
“Yeah, so?” Draco shrugs. “I’m gay, Dean’s gay, Blaise. Pansy, Ginny. Plus, you told everyone else. What’s the big deal?”
They put away their clothes and their books in silence. Harry steals glances at Draco whenever he thinks Draco isn’t going to see. (Draco sees every time he looks over.) They speak at the same time, “I don’t care that you fell asleep on my shoulder.” “I’m not mad, my Father just made it clear that he doesn’t want us being friends.”
“You uh, you bring me poppy’s whenever I’m cross with you.” Harry explains, a blush creeping onto his face.
“It could be-“ Harry breaks off, clamping his mouth shut. He takes a moment before starting again, “I wouldn’t mind if you joined me.”
Draco sighs and gathers himself before going back to his Charms paper. Granger’s words bothered him, Potter wasn’t trying to have a normal anything. He didn’t know how to go back to normal, apparently. He didn’t know how to live a life without a villain to take down.
Draco’s sobbing now, mumbling Astra’s name. Harry sits beside him on the bed and cradles his face. “Malfoy, match my breathing.”
“Whatever, Weasley,” Draco spits out before pulling his arm from Ron’s grip and practically running towards the dungeons.
He collects his Early Grey, Chamomile and decides to grab a peppermint tea as well. He pays for it and looks around for Harry but, the a large group of students had just walked in. He goes outside to wait, holding his bag with a tight grip.
Draco trails behind Pansy as she approaches Ginny who’s walking with Harry out of the Great Hall. Ginny eyes her with apprehensive eyes as Pansy asks, “Can I speak to you? Alone?”
“Sorry.” Draco mumbles, standing to his feet quickly and disappearing with his things before Harry can stand himself.
“I know, I know. I don’t- I don’t know why I said that.” Harry forces out, swallowing the bile at the back of his throat thinking of how Draco must’ve felt with Voldemort in his house all those months.
Harry realizes then that he’s been so focused on not seeming happy that everyone had went and got happy. And suddenly, Harry has to kiss him. He can’t stop himself as he moves forward, pushing through people rather rudely. He doesn’t notice how the room goes quiet as he gets closer to Draco, who only notices him when Harry’s lips are on his.
Draco groaned, shaking his head. “Please, forget it. I’m not interested in anyone here.”
Draco spends Christmas Day drinking hot cocoa with Luna and Neville, opening his gift from his Mum (a new tea mug with a D on it), and desperately wishing Harry were with him.
Draco’s about to pry the door open when Harry grabs his forearm and asks, “Where are you going?”
“You- You were so... I just wanted to-“ Potter breaks off, looking down and going back to sliding the slacks up Draco’s legs. “We should wait to see if the memories come back on their own. “
“It’s alright.” Draco says softly, hesitating before running a finger down Harry’s nose. “I’m sorry for overreacting.”
Pansy nods and Ginny grins widely before pushing up on her toes and kissing Pansy sweetly on the cheek. Pansy’s cheeks flame and she asks, “Would you like to come with me to Hogsmeade this weekend?”
“You and Draco could go together?” Hermione suggest before she rushes to add, “As friends, I mean. Since you two are the only ones without dates.”
“Oh, babe.” Pansy leans forward then, pulling Draco into a tight hug. “If he looks at you like that, we’ll move tables.”
“You’re a dork.” Draco smiles, reaching out for it. “Thank you.”
Harry and Draco share a grin before the return to their own homework.
“Draco!”
“I’m in my 8th year at Hogwarts.” Draco says slowly. He swallows hard as he looks down at his left hand and sees the black metal band on his ring finger. “I cant be married. Who would want to-“
“I know that, now.” Draco answers and then brings Harry in for a kiss. “I’m still not ready for.. for sex but, I wouldn’t having your cock in my mouth.”
“Ron took care of it. He’s quite fond of both of you.” Harry says, a small smile forming at the look of disbelief on Draco’s face. “Lucius hasn’t been allowed around either of you since.”
Hermione smiles up at him and retorts, “Always the tone of surprise.”
New Years passes quickly and before he knows it, he’s back on the train to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione are whispering amongst themselves, giggling as they wait for the train to pull off. Harry’s staring out the window, trying to not feel as sullen as he probably looks. He looks up when the door slides open.
Draco doesn’t miss the way Potter flinches at the use of his last name. Draco wonders when Potter started calling him Draco in a soft voice instead of Malfoy in a distasteful tone. He has so many questions but he doesn’t have a chance to ask them because the small girls appears at the door again. “Aunt ‘Mione and Uncle Ron are here!”
Draco nods and Harry’s thumb rubs circles on the back of his hand. He takes both potions and falls asleep just after Harry whispers, “Come back to me, love.”
Instead, he found Luna and Neville, wrapped up together on the couch while they read. Luna looks up when he entered the library and she smiles. “Draco, what are you doing here? I thought you’d gone home.”
“No. No.” Draco shakes his head, it was real. He and Harry were real. Astra was real. “I cant leave them, they’re waiting for me.”
my husband?”
“Why were you looking for me?” Harry asks.
“May I?”
He must fall asleep because the next thing he knows, he’s being startled awake to someone banging on his door. He rubs his eyes, flinging the blankets off of him. When he opens the door, Pansy stands before him. “You didn’t meet me at the clock tower. And you missed lunch and the rest of class. And dinners about to start.”
“I got distracted.” Draco defends himself, pushing Harry down on the bed and kissing wet kisses down his chest. Harry’s squirming by the time Draco kisses down his stomach and all over his thighs.
“Stop worrying about me and tell me what you’re going to say to her,” Draco insists, pulling the attention from him.
“You like love letters?” Ron looks up from where he’s shoveling mashed potatoes into his mouth.
“Just, give us a clue. What do you look for in a girl?” Ginny asks as Draco sits up on the bed.
Once he’s in his room, he collapses on his bed while kicking off his shoes. He lays down, letting the tears fall freely as he pulls his blankets over his head.
“I owe you an apology,” Granger says in a curt voice.
Draco looks up, meeting Harry’s gaze. “You hate me.”
Hermione reaches across the table then, capturing his hand with a squeeze. “Which is perfectly fine. When you’re meant to be with someone, it’ll happen. No need to rush it.”
“I’m sorry, who?” Ron asks, confused.
“I know. Walk me to class?”
Harry wants to kiss Draco all night, wants to claim him so that people will stop asking if he likes anyone. So that the girls will stop teasing Draco about having a crush on some seventh year. (Which he doesn’t, by the way. ) But he can’t just allow himself to be happy publicly like that not when everyone is still grieving.
“Now, that I can work with,” Pansy states with a grin.
“Hey, look at me.” Harry says softly, making Draco bring his gaze back to Harry’s eyes. “Is that why you’ve been so apprehensive? With admitting your feelings, with telling people, with.. with sex? Because you thought I was going to leave you?”
“Draco. It’s so good to see you,” Hermione says, smiling at him. Harry looks at her with angry eyes making her gaze at him, annoyed. “Just because
“Harry?”
Draco’s heart soars with pride when the sixth year leaves and everyone congratulates Harry on coming out. Draco congratulates him later by telling Harry in actions rather than words that rutting against each other to get off is perfectly okay with him. Harry comes with a broken gasp and it’s Draco’s name on his lips that makes Draco come seconds later. They fall asleep wrapped so tightly around each other it’s a wonder they don’t lose circulation.
He dreams of fields of poppy’s, fingers gripping his chin and black curls.
Draco eyes it before shrugging, “Cute.”
school year,” Granger bites out before turning on her heel and disappearing back to the more populated parts of the library.
Draco sends her a look that has her rolling her eyes and pulling a brush out of her bag on the floor. He thanks her and turns back to Harry. “Brush your hair.”
They spend Valentines day holed up in their room, Draco admitting he’s not quite ready for it to move past making out. Harry assuring him that just making out is perfectly fine with him and that he doesn’t want to do anything until they’re both ready for it. Draco falls even more in love with him. They both agree that they want to keep it hidden for a while, both liking the idea of stolen glances and secret kisses.
“Are. We are happy together.” Harry says and then drags Draco over into chest. “I’m very tired. I don’t sleep well when you’re angry with me.”
Draco pretends not to notice Harry’s staring, smirking about it in his bed at night. He can’t pretend he’s not attracted to Potter, that he hasn’t had a crush on him since the day he saw him on the platform. Of course he only started thinking about Potter’s dick inside him over the past year or two. He’s biding his time, making Potter wait for it so that when Draco does kiss him, it’ll be all the better.
“I haven’t seen you in two weeks. You don’t want to see me?” Pansy asks, eyebrows drawn together in a hurt expression.
at you but sometimes, I happen to be looking in your general direction and you just so happen to be there,” Granger rushes to say, her eyes hardening.
Draco smirks, “You’ve been looking at me, Granger? I’m flattered though, not surprised. I’m much more dashing than Weasley.”
“No. My.. I have to go back.” Draco says insistently. He can feel himself start to have a panic attack and he so desperately wants Harry’s arms around him.
“Great, so I’m spoiling her and she’s going to end up just like me.” Draco spits out, feeling a taste of disgust in his mouth.
“I was- I was worried about you!” Draco’s heart is
“You- You are a cheat!” Draco objects but he’s already leaning in for another long kiss.
Draco gasps when Harry bites against the pale skin of his neck. Harry kisses back up before finding Draco’s lips again. They’re kissing and Draco’s hand keep grasping in Harry’s hair, wishing it was longer. He pulls away slightly, “Why did you cut your hair?”
“What can I do for you?” Ginny asks and Draco’s heart falls when he realizes Pansy is not going to stay on script.
“That she is.”
“We uh, we started-“
“Harry, where did you get those?” Hermione asks in a tight voice, eyes angry.
Nothing changes after that, they still study and eat lunch together and get into spats. But they smile a little easier now, no longer feeling the entire weight of what they’d done to each other. They fumble through an awkward goodbye when Harry’s leaving with Ron to the Weasley’s for the holidays. Draco rolls his eyes eventually after listening to Harry stammer for a full minute and a half, reaching a hand out and pulling Harry into a quick, tight hug. “Have a good holiday, Potter.”
“Hermione told me what happened.” Harry says, sitting beside Draco. Draco open his mouth to speak but Harry shakes his head. “I love you. I’m in love with you. I’m not going to leave you. I cut it off last night because I was scared that you would leave me if you couldn’t remember.”
Neville tilts his head before asking, “Why didn’t you go with Harry? You two are joined at the hip these days.”
“More than you know.” Draco answers, cupping his face.
It’s so easy to calm down when Harry’s touching him. So easy to look into Harry’s eyes and match his breathing. When he’s calmed down, Pomfrey leaves them alone and Hermione asks, “What did you dream?”
Draco suddenly feels very left out, eyes glancing between Blaise and Pansy who are both giving him apologetic looks.
“Do you buy tea bags or actual tea?”
“Draco, I have the
He turns his focus back to the girls and sees Ginny place her hand on Pansy’s forearm. Ginny gives her a small smile and asks, “It’s you, isn’t it? My letters?”
Harry’s head snaps up and searches Draco’s face before he surges forward, capturing Draco’s lips in a deep kiss. They spend a few minutes on the couch before Harry moves Draco’s legs around his waist and hoists them both up.
Draco’s laying under the large tree in the courtyard when Granger appears over his head. He stares up at her before sighing and sitting up. “What can I do for you?”
“Mr. Potter, we should wait to see if his memory comes back on his own. Giving him information now could cloud his memory retrieval process.” The healer interrupts and Draco sends her a glare. He wants to know how he ended up here. How he landed Harry Potter and how he has a life and daughter with him.
“Draco, calm down.” Hermione tells him softly. “You were hit with spell that slips you into a dream state. You dream about what you want most.”
“Draco?” Harry whispers, sitting up in bed. “Are you alright?”
Draco looks at Harry and
“Oh, for Merlin’s sake. I forgot how insufferable you were.” Harry groans out before softening his tone, “If Astra becomes anything like you, she’ll be amazing. We don’t spoil her, she is sweet and kind. We have a running joke that she’s going to end up a Hufflepuff. Which, could you imagine?”
Ginny sighs, running her hand over the spot in her robe that she’d stuck in her letter in. “I don’t know. All I know is, they’re in 8th year.”
“You just put it in water?” Harry asks, seeming disgusted.
Harry snorts when Ron’s face falls. He turns his attention back to Ginny, “So?”
“Pans, of course I want to see you, it’s just…” Draco trails off.
“Erm, I don’t know.”
“Save me your excuses, Malfoy.” Draco rears back like he’s been slapped at the sound of his surname coming out of Harry’s mouth like it’s a bad taste.
He’s ends up taking a nap and when he wakes, it’s dark in the room. He sits up quickly, taking quick, short breaths. He jumps when a hand smooths over the small of his back and then remembers. He sighs a breath of relief as Harry blinks sleepily. “You’re okay, I’m here.”
Draco feels as if his entire body is tingling as Harry deepens the kiss, moving Draco back against the bed and straddling him. Draco can feel his own hard cock brushing against Harry’s, separated only by his own sweatpants and Harry’s briefs. Harry’s hand slips around his neck and squeezes, making Draco gasp into his mouth. Harry’s mind must catch up to him because he’s off Draco in a second, “Fuck, I’m sorry. I didn’t- I got carried away.”
“You should fix that, then.” Draco retorts and Harry uses his hands to rip Draco’s shirt open, sending buttons flying. “Harry! That was a nice shirt!”
“Ginny can come with me,” Pansy assures him. “I’m not going to make you sit somewhere you’re not comfortable and I’m certainly not going to expect you to sit alone.”
“You were teaching your potions class. You were observing a student’s work and we’re really not sure how it happened but the potion wasn’t correct. Small explosion sent you flying back.” The healer explains and Draco’s mind tries to catch up. “Your husband has been called.”
“I think,” Ginny starts with her eyebrows set in confusion, “Maybe an older
The healer sighs and clears her throat. “He must’ve hit his head harder than we originally thought. He believes it’s still his 8th year at Hogwarts.”
“By listening in on my private conversations?” Harry screams, hand running through his hair in frustration.
Draco pauses for a moment before asking, “And my parents?”
Harry smirks and replies, “Gladly.”
“Oh, no,” Draco mumbled. Harry looked to him in confusion and Draco explained, “She’s trying to set me up with someone. I don’t want to be set up.”
Harry laughs, dropping his hand from Draco’s face. “I want you to wait until those memories come back. You’ll want to remember those on your own.”
The healers face falls and she asks, “When do you think it is, Mr. Malfoy?”
It’s dead silent as everyone waits for their reaction. Harry glances at him and Draco decides not to ruin the fun by refusing to go with Harry. “Great, I get to spend all day fending Potter off from his adoring fans.”
“Christmas can only be so good when you have Lucius as a father.” Draco says honestly and Harry’s heart hurts for him.
He’s setting the last dish in the drying rack when Harry brings Astra back down, her hair wet but braided back and donned in a fleece gown. “She’d like to say goodnight.”
“I’m sorry?” Draco asks, voice going up a pitch as his eyebrows raise.
There’s cheers and wolf whistles around the room as Harry shrugs and says, “Quite tired of hiding how much I love you.”
They stare at each other for a moment before Draco whispers, “Are you still mad?”
Ginny shoots her brother a smile before changing the subject. “So, Harry. You’re the only one left.”
“Probably where you get it.”
“Right. I thought you were going to dinner at Pansy and Ginny’s?” Draco asks, setting the book on the table by the couch.
They sit in silence for a long time before Draco stands in a rush of determination. “This is stupid. I’m not going too hide away just because Harry Potter doesn’t like me. It’s nothing unusual for me.”
It surprises Harry more than anything. He doesn’t quite realize they’re friends until one day, Dean leans around Blaise and asks, “Where’s Malfoy?” As if Harry is the one to know. Harry can’t fault him, he’d spent more time with Draco in the past months than anyone else. Which isn’t fair to Ron but Harry knows Ron’s had his hands a bit full with.. well, Hermione and navigating how to spend alone time with her when they don’t share a room.
“Because you’re friends with Harry. Which means, you and I are friends,” Granger explains as if it was so obvious. “And who Harry and I are friends with, Ron usually follows.”
“Let’s- go to your room,” Harry suggest and desire pools in Draco’s stomach.
of research to find out how to make her a product of both of us. She’s... Draco you
“Hm?”
“You barely spoke to me in September of our 8th year. I’m just... I don’t want your mind shutting me down and not remembering because you want to spite me.” Harry tells him and Draco looks away, not wanting him to see the hurt in his eyes.
Draco leaves and rushes up the steps before Harry can see him cry. He puts a locking spell that he knows Harry could disarm if he wanted but knows he won’t. He lays on the bed for an hour before there’s a knock on the door. “Astra and I are leaving. We’ll wait a few minutes if you want to go. If not, I understand.”
“No, that’s quite alright.” Draco says as Harry turns and his eyes look up the mans body. Draco clears his throat suddenly and turns on his side away from Harry. “Goodnight, Harry.”
“I do,” Harry tells him, the corners of his mouth twitching. Draco realizes then that Harry had experience a growth spurt over the summer. He was now towering over Draco, legs unbelievably long.
Of course that sends Harry into a panic, wondering if people hate him. Which makes him feel guilty because people shouldn’t hate him for being friends with Draco. Draco had tried time and time again to make up for his actions. As had Pansy and Blaise. And nobody was mad at Ginny for walking into the lunch room holding hands with Parkinson. Or at Dean for getting caught making out with Blaise in a closet. Of course, he and Draco were just friends so it shouldn’t even matter.
The next morning he wakes up and almost thinks it was all a dream until he realizes that Harry is wrapped around him like a serpent. Their limbs are all tangled together and Harry’s long hair is down, messy and fucking everywhere. He pokes Harry in the side repeatedly until the other man groans. Harry’s lips starts a trail of open mouth kisses down Draco’s neck and Draco freezes. “Harry?”
“We had a fight,” Draco answers.
“I don’t want to talk about it. It’ll never be reality.” Draco says, pulling his hands from Harry’s. “Can I go back to my room?”
Harry rolls his eyes and says, “Please, they’ll be too scared to approach me with you scowling. You won’t have to do anything out of the ordinary.”
“Okay, Potter, don’t make me hit you.”
“It’s nothing.” Harry watches Draco as he runs his finger over the infuser before wrapping it back up with careful hands. After Harry’s put it back in the bag, he tells Draco, “C’mon. I wanna go to the sweets shop. They have pumpkin fritters this time of year.”
“I know.” Hermione says, squeezing his hand. “But if you don’t, you’ll gain new memories with him. With Astra and with us.”
“Nothing,” Draco spits out, trying to escape Ron’s hold.
“Oh, Mol, look at how red his cheeks are.” Arthur jokes, making Harry cover his face with both hands.
“Yeah, okay,” Draco nods, taking Harry’s hand. He leads them down into the dungeons, opening his door with ease. He’s suddenly glad he’d tidied up earlier this morning.
“I’m sure I can find someone here you’re interested in,” Pansy says with a smirk.
Draco groans, screwing his face up in disgust. “As if I’d date anyone here.”
“Right, you want to go with a friend.” Draco was stupid to get his hope up, even for a second.
Draco freezes, watching as Potter sinks to his knees. “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now, Sirius. I don’t have anyone to save or a villain to take down. Am I meant to go back to school, now? Act like nothing happened? I can’t just- I broke up with Ginny. I’m- I think I might be gay. Or, Or, at least Bi? I don’t know. I wish you were here to help me.”
The corners of Harry’s mouth twitched. “Sure. Everyone else is.”
“He showed up when our engagement hit the papers. He said things that… I worked hard to get you to believe that you’re worthy of being loved and that you deserve a happy life. And his words nearly destroyed it all in one fell sweep.” Harry replied, jaw clenched. “He came with Narcissa to the hospital when Astra was born. Ron nearly attacked him when he made the comment that she was pretty for a half-blood.”
“Yes.” Draco answers with a smirk. “And you loved me. More than anything.”
“Actually, I asked Draco to go with me,” Harry says and Draco turns to him with wide eyes. “I don’t particularly want to go with one of the… obsessed fans and Luna’s going with Neville this year. I thought, why not Draco? He’s my friend and I’m sure he’d enjoy going.”
“I’d like to go with you.” Draco blinks at Harry’s confession. Harry wanted to go with him? As a date? Maybe
Harry convinces Hermione to let him take Draco to their shared room. Draco’s body is aching and sore so he has to lean on Harry the whole way there. When they reach the bedroom, Draco collapses on the bed and immediately slips under his blankets and curls up facing the wall. Harry lingers, “Do you need anything?”
“I’m sorry,
Harry stares at him for a moment before asking, “Do you really love me?”
“Draco,
“Before?” Pansy questions.
“Oh, sor-“ Draco cuts off as he lifts his eyes up to see Harry standing there. “You cut your hair.”
“It’s not even cold!” Harry proclaims. “Plus, I was getting some coins and I had to redo my locking spells on my trunk.”
Draco looked away to see everyone was dancing, holding each other close. He looks back to Harry and reluctantly nods. “Fine. Let’s dance.”
Harry whirls around, eyes angry and glistening with tears. “Why were you out here in the first place? Why were you following me?”
Draco clears his throat, as the little girl climbs her way up the side of the bed and curls into his side. “Uh, early September. We’ve just gotten accustomed to being roomed together.”
“You and your Mum are close.” Harry says and Draco can tells he’s angry. “I won’t allow your father to be around you or Astra.”
Harry sighs with a small smile forming on his face. “You just.. you make me curious. I want to know everything about you.”
“You have nothing to apologize for,” Draco whispers, leaning froward and dropping a kiss to Harry’s nose. “We’re here now, that’s all that matters.”
“Waking up to find out I’m married to Potter? Yeah, madly weird.” Draco doesn’t miss how Potter flinches again. He makes a mental note to try and call him Harry when he can.
Harry smiles down, lips swollen and an angry red. “Can we-“
“An older man?” Luna muses with a smile, leaning over into Neville who just takes Luna’s hand without looking up from his herbology book.
angry with Draco doesn’t mean the rest of have to be.”
“Won’t allow it?” Draco asks, eyebrows raised.
“I am rather dashing,” Draco agrees, making the trio all roll their eyes at him. “You look amazing yourself, Hermione.”
Harry blushes before changing the subject, “Who’s all going to Hogsmeade?”
He’s not looking where he’s going and bumps into someone. He doesn’t look up as he merely mumbles an apology. The person grabs his arm and he looks up and sees Ron looking at him with curious eyes. “Malfoy. What’s wrong?”
“Draco Malfoy.” She says sternly, face showing that she isn’t going to take no for an answer.
“I’m not giant!” Harry exclaims with a frown. Draco looks up, any further up and his neck would be in pain, and rolls his eyes at the taller boy. “Okay, fine, I’m a little taller now than most.”
One side of the bed has clothes everywhere, the other clean and pristine. There’s a bathroom but the door is only slightly cracked so Draco can’t see in. The closet is the same way as the nightstands, one side messy and the other perfectly clean. When he looks back to Harry, he’s wearing a patient look on his face. Harry makes the bed with a wave of his wand and gestures for Draco to sit. They sit with their legs crossed, facing each other.
“Please,
“Alright, Astra. Let’s go then.” He says, grabbing a briefcase and stretching an arm out to Draco. “Ron, Hermione... I’ll uh, we’ll talk later?”
And then he’s pushing Draco against the door and putting his hand around Draco’s slender neck. Draco barely has time to process what’s happening before Harry’s pulling him into a deep, wet kiss. Draco lets out a moan as tangles his hands into Harry’s hair, pulling him closer. They kiss for a long minute before Draco pulls away, his lips red and panting. “I was biding my time for that.”
“Maybe,” Draco muses noncommittally.
“I’ll take the couch tonight.” Harry informs him and Draco’s stomach sinks at the thought of being alone in an unfamiliar place.
“Good. Hermione and Puck have been begging him to get a dog.” Harry replies, running a hand down Draco’s arm and entangling their hands. “Tia called, she said the baby’s kicking.”
He sighs before explaining the kiss and Harry’s reaction and the note this morning. “What if my memories never come back and he leaves me and I have to go back to my parents?”
They’re a small class, some of them opting not to come back and some of them… Well, the war had claimed people. They play darts and dance and drink butter beer, they have
“Slughorn is doing another Christmas party this year,” Luna tells them two weeks later.
Harry’s face softens and he sighs, tracing Draco’s jawline with absent fingers. “I forgot you don’t like being alone at night. I’m sorry, of course we can share a bed.”
“Harry, the better part of your third.” Hermione snorts at Draco’s answer.
“Fuck, Draco. Your fucking
By the time he emerges, Harry is gone and the bed is empty and unmade. Draco rolls his eyes and grabs the wand he recognizes as his and makes the bed quickly. He finds a pair of black jeans and steals a sweater from off of Harry’s side before he pads downstairs. Astra is in the den, eating waffles and watching a muggle cartoon on the television. Harry greets hm with a smile and hands him a coffee. “We have a television?”
Draco nods and moves closer to Harry. “In case it wasn’t obvious, I’m not going anywhere. I’m- Damn it, Harry, I’m falling in love with you.”
“And what exactly could you have done to stop her?” Granger asked, making Draco’s face fall. “Exactly, nothing. She was a horrid bitch who got what was coming to her.”
Draco panics, hand reaching out to grasp Harry’s wrist. “Wait. I’m sorry. I’m.. I still think of everything you do as an ulterior motive to try and make me look stupid.”
Harry slows his walking to match Draco’s pace and they walk at his pace all the way to Hogsmeade. “Where do you wanna go first?”
“It was good. And yours?”
Draco’s eyebrows draw together, “That’s rid-“
Draco arches an eyebrow and gives him an unimpressed look. “Wow, Potter, I didn’t think I had to tell you that.”
“Whatever, let’s go.” Draco turns and starts walking, Harry catching up to him in no time. They walk down the hill in silence and Draco feels a little out of breath with how fast Harry is walking. “Excuse me, Giant, could you slow down?”
Draco sighs. “I wanted to try my hand at apologizing,
“I would love to,” Ginny agrees, both the girls smiling with red cheeks. “Could I come to your room later, I’d like to…”
“Erm, funny? Kind.” Draco felt stupid when Pansy and Ginny looked at them with blank expressions. “Fine, okay. I like a guy who can banter with me. I don’t want someone who’s going to get offended when I throw a teasing insult their way, I want someone who can dish it back to me. I like guys who are smart but, doesn’t go bragging about it. I want them to be confident in themselves but, not an arrogant ass. I want them to stand up for the little guy, to be brave in the face of danger.”
“Er, Mum is spending Christmas with my aunt and Teddy in Spain.” Draco shifts his weight as the couple mirror each other with confused expressions.
Draco lets them go and when he’s sure they’re gone, he removes the locking spell and goes downstairs. He examines the pictures on the wall, willing his mind to remember even just one of the moments. Granger and Weasleys wedding, Astra’s newborn photographs, he and Harry in Paris. There’s a picture of Pansy, Ginny, Granger, Weasley, Harry and him in front of Hogwarts. They’re all wrapped together and he sees himself gazing at Harry in udder adoration. Merlin, he wants this. He goes upstairs and opens every drawer in their room. After finding nothing of importance, he goes through Harry’s bedside table. He freezes when he sees a few bottles of lube, two dildos, and pair of handcuffs. He swallows hard before slamming the drawer shut. What in the fuck were they into?
“Good. Because I want to talk to about when exactly Parkinson is going to tell Ginny…”
.” Harry whines, bucking his hips when Draco’s just barely runs his fingertips over the tip of Harry’s cock.
“Not-“ Draco cuts off with a sigh, “How did
Draco peers up at Harry when he cuts off. “Can we what?”
“No, I put mine in a little metal infuser. I’ll probably need a new one soon but, it can wait.” Draco points to a small table with infuser on it. He turns back to the wall of teas and doesn’t notice Harry wander off.
It’s silent for all of five minutes before Harry’s disrupting the quiet. “So I was thinking-“
Draco looks like he’s going to say something harsh but instead, “I’m glad, too, Potter.”
“Your best friend hates me,” Draco spits out, clenching jaw to keep from letting out an embarrassing sob.
Draco’s gagging on it, Harry being a lot bigger than Draco could’ve imagined. He’s going slow at first until Harry’s hips buck up and insists he go faster. He pins Harry’s hips down and bobs his head up and down quickly, letting his tongue slip over the tip everyone he comes up. There’s drool dripping down his chin and his jaw fucking aches but, when Harry comes with a scream of Draco’s name, he knows it was worth it. Draco sucks him through his orgasm and pulls off with a pop, swallowing and wiping his mouth off on his hand.
“I think I’m going to tell her today,” Pansy says, bringing his attention back to her. Draco looks at her with raised eyebrows, gesturing for her to go on. “It’s just.. I want to hold her hand and kiss her and sit with her at lunch.”
“Well, for starters, I’m gay,” Draco tells her.
“Er, the bags?”
“That’s a lie,” Granger spits out. “Every time I look at you, you’re staring at him. What’re you up to, Malfoy?”
angry.”
They’re setting up the sleeping potion and the memory one. The healer comes over with both and a small smile on her face. “You’ll take the memory potion first and then the sleeping one. You’ll be asleep for around an hour and then when you wake up, we’ll know if it happened.”
“Yeah, cute,” Blaise agrees.
“I know. I was tired of waiting.” Harry replies, smirking a bit. “I thought for sure the towel thing would work.”
“It’s the paper. It leaves a taste.” Draco goes inside as Harry holds the door open for him. He leads Harry over to a wall full of glass jars that hold loose leaf tea. “I prefer Earl Grey in the mornings, it’s got a citrus flavor. I usually add a touch of honey to my morning cup. At night, I either drink Chamomile or Decaf Green Tea.”
“You’re a sap, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry shrugs. “I dunno, something snarky.”
Harry shakes his head. “Can’t stay mad at you for very long.”
“Okay,” Ginny draws out the word, “So what do you look for in a guy?”
Draco has to get out of here. He’s not meant to hear this, he shouldn’t have even stayed at long as he did. He turns, walking quickly and quietly but he steps on a twig and it breaks. He hides behind a large tree when Potter calls out, “Is someone there?”
“Erm, thank you.” Draco hesitates for a moment before saying, “I’m sorry, too. For.. everything. From the mud blood thing, to constantly picking on your appearance and your relationship with Weasley. For.. For Bella-“
Draco snorts, “Contrary to popular belief, the world does not revolve around you, Potter.”
“The hospital, obviously.” Draco drawls out. “What happened?”
“Nothing.”
“You forgot about it?” Harry repeats, eyebrows drawing together. “I said some pretty personal things. I mean, you heard me say I was gay.”
.” Harry says, his eyes wide and looking like he’d just seen the light.
“Merlin, Potter, put some clothes on.” Draco spits out but thinks,
Harry looks at him in surprise. “What?”
“What’s his problem?” Ron asks around a yawn. Harry purses his lips, shrugging and staring down at the book Draco had left behind.
“Really?” Draco asks. “You liked this party last time.”
Draco stares at Harry, trying to see anything else he’s missed. “You’re growing your hair out.”
“Then what’s wrong? You won’t even look at me.” Harry insists, dropping his things onto the ground.
“He thinks it’s still 8th year, early September.” Potter explains, and the couples faces both fall.
Everyone looks at her with surprised looks and she shrugs. “Their handwriting is in impeccable. The way they talk about certain things. The way they speak of marriage. It could very well be a more feminine man, which would be just as well. But, I wouldn’t mind it being a girl.”
And so they go home to their house on the countryside, walking up the familiar steps and tripping over Harry’s clothes strewn about. And they paint their daughter’s bedroom door purple with her name in black lettering. Harry grows his hair and beard out, making Draco squirm when he runs is chin down Draco’s thighs. They buy a television and hang pictures on the walls. Astra’s born and she fills their home with laughter and makes them feel complete. And they slip off into a little slice of heaven.
A few days later, Draco is in the library, drinking a peppermint tea with his little snake infuser settled in nicely. He’d used it every time he’d had a cup since Harry had given it to him.
“Is that okay?” Draco asks, looking down.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Of course, I did. He was just too angry to listen.”
It’s the end of November when Draco finds himself in Pansy’s room with her and Ginny. Ginny’s sitting at Pansy’s desk, doing a paper. Draco’s laying down, his eyes closed as Pansy paints nails black. “So, Draco. I haven’t forgotten about setting you up with someone.”
It’s quiet for a long time and Draco thinks that maybe Harry had fallen back asleep. “You don’t think they’re going to come back on their own?”
“Was this-“ Draco cuts off before he asks Harry if it was a date. He couldn’t face the rejection that he would feel when Harry told him it was just a day they’d had to spend together because their friends were in relationships. “Can I borrow your notes from yesterdays Charms class?”
“Well, Blaise is going to be dating Dean as soon as they get tired of the stolen glances and pining. And.. I think we both know Pansy is Ginny’s secret admirer,” Harry tells him as if those facts are supposed to explain why they should be friends.
“How’d Ron and Hermione take it?” Draco asks in soft voice.
“Begged to stay at Ron and ‘Mione’s. Ron can’t say no.” Harry explains, shrugging his winter coat off.
Draco smiles up at Harry. “Oh and you’re much better now?”
Christmas Day is joyous and loud and filled with so much love that Harry can barely stand it. He gives gifts and gets them in return but, he would’ve been happy even if there hadn’t been gift to be had.
“What makes you think I’m so vain I carry a brush around all the time?” Pansy objects.
her. I’ve never seen anyone able to get you to drop your defenses quicker than she can. She doesn’t want for anything.”
Pansy opens and closes her mouth several time and Harry winces behind Draco. He leans in close, his breath hot on Draco’s ear, and whispers, “She’s kind of crashing and burning.”
“Hi,” Draco replies before eyeing Harry’s hair. “Do you own a brush?”
“I’ve wanted this for so long,” Harry whispers, his breath hot against Draco’s neck where Harry’s trailing kisses.
Harry rolls his eyes and holds out his arm, “C’mon, GQ. Let’s go in.”
Draco draws a slow hand up, pushing Granger’s finger out of his face. He shakes his head and answers, “Like I told Boy Wonder this morning, the world doesn’t revolve around him. I haven’t been watching or spying on him.”
He stumbles into the person and grasps onto them for support. When he looks up, it’s Harry looming over him. “I found you.”
“Come on, Potter, you can walk me to class.” Draco pulls Harry off the wall he’s leaning on and they fall into step beside each other as they set off to Muggle Studies.
“Don’t tell Ron. He’ll just use it to tease me,” Granger requests with a faint blush on her cheeks.
“You like sitting with Ginny.”
Draco watches as Potter runs a hand over his face and he feels a ping of guilt. He hates causes Potter pain, not after all he’s already put the man through. Granger and Weasley are bumbling through the door and Granger is crossing the floor to bring him in for a hug. “I was so worried. I had to return back to the school, the first year who did this is just beside herself. She feels so bad.”
After visiting nearly every shop, Draco and Harry set off to walk back to Hogwarts. Draco had ended up buying Harry a hairbrush with the Gryffindor symbol on the back to make up for Harry’s gift. As they walked back, Harry with his bag of fritters and a hairbrush and Draco with his bag of tea and infuser, Draco felt nervous.
Draco laughs and pulls him in for another kiss. One that lasts all night.
Potter narrows his eyes but leaves Draco sitting alone at the end of the Slytherin table with his near empty cup of tea.
“The Weasley would never allow me to spend Christmas there.” Draco says in disbelief. “Not after Fred.”
“Thanks.” Harry sits, setting four different books on the table along with notes from various classes.
Harry was waiting at the end of the hallway and Draco’s breath caught in his throat at the sight of him. He was wearing a white button down, tight in all the right places, with the top few buttons open and showing the top of his chest off. It was tucked into a pair of tight, navy blue slacks that stopped just at his ankles where a pair of brown loafers started. His hair was down and laying perfectly as he smiled at Draco.
