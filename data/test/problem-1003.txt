“That is not what Scorpius gave you.”
“Ah,” Malfoy said, “I take it I may have missed the odd bit of news from our shores while I’ve been overseas?”
“Wh-what?” Harry spluttered in reply.
Draco knew that he shouldn’t have done it.
He made to get up, but Harry waved at him to sit down. “It doesn’t bother me, Malfoy,” Harry sighed. “How could it? I’ve done that too. I mean you’re not the only one who you know...”
“And, er, what did that entail?”
Harry just looked at him for a minute, dumbfounded. “What?”
Thankfully Harry didn’t answer, instead using his tongue to gently lap at the head of Draco’s cock now. Draco had been fantasising about this exact thing for weeks, and yet somehow none of his fantasies were as anywhere close to brilliant as the real thing. And Harry hadn’t even properly got started yet.
She waved to him cheerily as she headed out the door, not doing anything to alleviate the dread that Harry felt about what lay ahead of him. He had ten minutes now until the first interview, and he was going to use that time to make himself a good cup of tea. At least that way if the interview was a disaster, he’d still have something to enjoy.
“He was very clear that you’d used the word ‘knobhead’ when he related the story to me. You know you shouldn’t use that language in a professional environment, Harry,” she scolded.
His boyfriend was particularly displeased with him. Apparently six months without sex was something of an imposition for him, and Draco couldn’t really argue with that. He wasn’t delighted with that either, but then, as Draco had argued multiple times, this whole thing wasn’t even Draco’s fault. Not really.
The moment was ruined slightly by Harry’s overly excited reaction, as he misjudged how close Draco’s head was to his own, turning his enthusiastic nod of agreement into more of a head butt, leaving Draco to pull back from him with a sharp cry of pain.
Draco squeezed his hand gently in response. “You know they think I only got this job because you forced your friend to hire me. Plus I’m sick of seeing endless headlines about how I’ve somehow cursed you into being with me.”
“Um, we. We could probably, you know, touch other stuff. Through the floo. You know. Fun stuff.”
“That’s it, isn’t it Potter? Well, if you won’t be needing it, I may as well give it a good home. Can’t have it just lying about your office all day can we?”
“Can you tell me, please, why the fuck it is that you have my son doing detention today? And don’t tell me it’s because his end of year thank you gift wasn’t up to the standard that you’d expect like it says in this ridiculous little note! Surely even you aren’t that conceited?”
So now here he was on house arrest for six bloody months, with no visitors outside of the one approved house elf that was allowed to bring him essential supplies. Apparently his boyfriend didn’t count as an essential supply as much has Draco would have liked to argue that he very definitely was, so Draco was forced to communicate with him via owl and floo only.
“Let’s go,” Harry said, standing up and summoning his coat. “You know I haven’t got anything planned for dinner, so if you’re wanting to eat quickly then we better buy something on the way.”
“Really?” Harry asked. “I’ll be here.”
“Yes, okay, just hurry up, Potter,” Malfoy whined.
Harry groaned. He wanted to deny it outright, his mouth was even forming the words, but his body was completely betraying him and instead of saying something sensible, he just let out a strangled grunting sound. It wasn’t bloody fair. He didn’t even like Malfoy, but he couldn’t deny that the man did have a certain attractiveness about him.
“Sure. Have a good day, Harry.”
It was Harry’s turn to laugh at that. “You see I have some ideas, but it would be so much more fun to hear you say it.”
Harry gulped. He had opened a cake just like the one Scorpius was describing and had already scoffed down a good half of it. But surely this must still just be part of an elaborate prank?
Harry looked into the face of an inexplicably irate Draco Malfoy, his wand clutched tight in his fist, but thankfully not pointing in Harry’s direction.
“No I didn’t!”
“Would you want me to suck you?” Draco blurted out. “I mean, I don’t know if you’d like that obviously, I mean I just thought...”
It was Harry who was blushing furiously now, which was plainly ridiculous when he’d had his cock down the throat of the man in front of him only earlier that afternoon.
“You mean-”
“You really never stop, do you Malfoy?”
“Harry!” Draco cried in warning, “I’m gonna come!”
“Yeah, right, dancing. You know you can do that with more than a millimetre between you?”
Hermione sighed, but put up her hands in surrender as she made to stand up. “Fine, I’ll stay out of it. I’ll come and see you after your last interview. When are they getting here?”
Harry couldn’t understand why Malfoy was looking so bewildered, so he settled for just glaring at him. Scorpius to his credit just continued to write as though there had been no interruption.
“You know, I really do wonder sometimes just how you managed to save the world all those years ago, Potter. Now, I really better be going. I’ll send you an owl once I’ve found a suitable restaurant. It’s been a better afternoon than I anticipated.”
Harry waved away his apology. “It’s okay, you don’t need to apologise. I don’t blame you given the circumstances. If she weren’t my boss I’d have probably taken off from there as fast as I could too, to be honest.”
“Eloquent, Harry,” Draco said, his cheery grin belying his mocking tone.
Draco could have sworn that he heard a chuckle at that. Harry’s hand continued stroking up and down Draco’s shaft, a tortuous combination of wonderful and not nearly enough at the same time. Draco tried bucking his hips to get more from Harry, to speed up his rhythm, but that just made Harry slow down further, the utter sadist.
“Well, if I do the job well, then no one should know. The point was to handle any incidents quickly and calmly without causing a scene and running the risk of breaking the Statute.”
“Because I’m brilliant,” she answered instantly. “And besides, Draco, you know you’re more than capable of this. People just need to be assured of what’s happening. It’s been a week now since Granger announced that we had to cut all ties with Muggles. People want someone to reassure them.”
Draco smiled and nodded at his son, grateful for his occasional bouts of denseness. No, Potter - or Harry as he should now think of him - was most definitely not Draco’s Professor.
“You do. The Saviour of our world, devoting your life to ridding the world of dark forces. And yet, you aren’t brave enough to say whatever it is that you want to say to me.”
Malfoy was now standing far too close to him, his eyes piercing into Harry as though trying to read his mind. Harry suddenly wondered if Malfoy knew legilimency, and cursed himself for not having read the man’s résumé when he’d had the chance.
“Erm, Potter? I’m here for my interview for the secretary position,” Malfoy said, and Harry suspected that it wasn’t the first time that he’d told him this.
Malfoy smiled gently and drew in a shaky breath. “Yes,” he said carefully, “I do. The question is, do you think the same about me, Harry?”
Draco laughed. “She’s the Minister, Harry. Of course she expects a lot of her staff! I think today went well though.”
Hermione looked a little taken aback by the quick apology, but attempted a comforting smile in his direction. Harry was still feeling a little shellshocked by how quickly everything had just happened, and he couldn’t help but feel disappointed that Draco had just run out of there as fast as he had.
“Obviously,” Malfoy muttered, but his words lacked their usual venom due to him choosing that moment to rid himself of all his clothes with a quick flick of his wand.
“So?” Potter pressed. “What is it?”
“You seriously want to know what I think?”
“No, but you implied it. And I’m not for the record, not that it’s any of your bloody business.”
“Well, I guess this is it then, Potter. Probably the strangest job interview I’ve ever had, if I’m honest.”
Granger looked at him for a moment, concern etched into every line on her face. “That isn’t going to be easy. We’ll be asking people to stay away from family, friends. There’s plenty of businesses that sell to Muggles that will have to close. Do we have an alternative?”
“I didn’t, Professor. I’m sorry, I don’t know how my note ended up on that, but I swear I didn’t have anything to do with it.”
“Um, sir? I think there’s been a mistake. I swear, I just sent a treacle tart flavoured cake. I don’t know anything about - that,” Scorpius stuttered out.
Malfoy huffed. “Hardly. It’s a lovely place, Potter, and I won’t hear you disparage it. No, in the end, quite honestly, I had a bit of a falling out with the Minister. Erm, a personal matter, shall we say, but it made it rather difficult for me to remain his employee.”
The friction that position created was truly glorious in Harry’s opinion. He felt a slight terror that he might enjoy it too much, and then this would all be over far too soon. He vaguely wondered what Draco might want from him after today, but decided he didn’t want to stop doing exactly what he was doing right now.
Harry just swirled his tongue around the head of Draco’s cock by way of reply, before pushing himself back down onto Draco, somehow taking in even more than he had before. When Draco felt himself hit the back of Harry’s throat, he knew that it was all over for him. He started to feel himself tingle, his balls drew up tight, and the next moment he was coming in a rush, screaming Harry’s name over and over.
Hermione raised an eyebrow in his direction. “You have a plan,” she stated incredulously. “Now that just makes me suspicious Harry, because I have never known you to have a plan. Usually I have a plan, and you make it a point to ignore it.”
“And you know you still owe Aoife for covering for us last week,” Draco reminded him. “That was definitely outside of the secretary job description. You shouldn’t have screamed so loud.”
“Don’t look like that, Harry. Of course I’d love to straddle you on that ridiculous sofa and get straight to fucking, but I just don’t know if I can do the whole casual thing. Not with you. I can feel the heartbreak coming from a mile away.”
“Did you now? I’m intrigued.”
Harry grinned. “I believe you were going to bend yourself over my desk. Wasn’t sure what you were expecting me to do until you’d done that to be honest, so I thought I’d just enjoy the view.”
A swift knock on the door broke Harry from his reverie. The person didn’t wait for Harry to reply, throwing the door open with much more force than was strictly necessary.
All pretence of being professional now forgotten, Harry threw his hands up in exasperation. “Why would that bother me?”
They finished getting dressed in silence, and Malfoy made his way towards the door. He paused with his hand on the door handle, and turned to face Harry. “You know I still expect you to apologise to Scorpius. Even if there may have been certain, um, benefits, to our little discussion.”
“Because I know you, Harry,” Malfoy said, and Harry certainly picked up on the use of his first name again. “Maybe not as well as I once did, but you always worked best when you trusted your gut. So that’s how I think you got this position so young. You did what was right, you followed your intuition, and the results spoke for themselves. You can’t have changed that much, or you would have read every inch of my resumé before I arrived today.”
It was Draco’s turn to huff this time, as he crossed his arms and looked away from Harry. They’d had this argument every day since Draco was arrested and was awaiting his trial. Draco really didn’t agree that he had to just deal with that kind of crap, whatever Harry might say. Why shouldn’t he stand up for himself? For both of them?
Harry sat back in his chair, smiling slightly to himself that there was no way that Malfoy could refute that. He’d always loved scoring points over him; it was odd really how quickly the old rush of competitiveness came surging back between them.
“Yes?”
“I’ll have to conjure lube,” he croaked. “I don’t keep any in here,” he added lamely.
Harry grinned, because of course Draco would be worried about getting his clothes dirty in a moment like this.
“No!” Draco answered quickly. “I wasn’t thinking about that!”
“No! Piss off, Malfoy. You’ve had your laugh, so just leave me alone.”
“You’re upset,” Pansy said simply.
Harry shook his head. This was so ridiculous, but he didn’t think he’d ever been so turned on.
“You haven’t! I knew something seemed a little off about your reaction when I arrived. I thought you just didn’t believe that I’d turn up! But you don’t know anything about what I’ve been up to since school, do you?”
Malfoy beamed, every one of his features lighting up, and Harry thought he’d never seen anyone look more gorgeous. “Good,” Malfoy replied, his face flushing slightly. “That’s good.”
“Yes!” Harry answered, far too quickly. “I mean, you should stay. I shouldn’t have- I know I was wrong- but let’s at least talk some more.”
Harry felt his face flame red. “How did you...” he trailed off without finishing the question.
“No! Not because I don’t want to continue this,” Draco said, gesturing between the two of them and looking pointedly at Harry’s crotch. “But it’s 11.30. And I’m afraid if I get too carried away here, I might have some awkward questions to answer later this afternoon.”
That was fortunate really, or it would have been most improper of Draco to purchase that particular item for him. As it turned out though, he had been right that it was just the perfect little gift. He might never know just how he’d gotten so lucky to have a way into that office today, but getting lucky had certainly felt good.
Draco brought his hands up to cup Harry’s bum, gently kneading his cheeks. When he pushed Harry forward slightly, taking him in even deeper still, Harry let out a long, low groan. Draco was holding nothing back, encouraging Harry to keep thrusting and hitting the back of his throat.
“Well,” he began slowly, “you know how when we call each other, we can sort of touch? Like you’ve played with my hair, stroked my cheek and so on?”
“I had a good time, Harry. I hope you enjoy working with whoever it is that you end up hiring.”
“You were a nanny?” Harry asked, surprised. His current interviewee, Aoife, was slightly intimidating to him, but he must admit that she interested him much more than the unlikeable Dave.
“A little... a little bit of history?” Harry asked bewilderedly.
They stood there silent and immobile for a few moments, and Harry began to wonder what he was supposed to do now. He had no idea what the protocol was when admitting that you found your old high school enemy attractive, but he figured it probably wasn’t just standing about and looking awkward.
“Not waiting. Now. I want to touch you right now.”
“Well, yes, I was passing,” Hermione said, making herself comfortable in the seat opposite him. “And well, yes, Dean did mention that you were a little unhappy after your last interview, so I thought I better run interference so you didn’t bite my poor secretary’s head off this time.”
“So, um, right, yes, okay, Finland,” Harry mumbled meaninglessly. “Why come home now, though? If you’ve been there all this time?”
“If you’re worried that he somehow coerced me into this, then you shouldn’t be. I’m not going to be complaining about it. We’d already discussed that I wouldn’t be getting the role before... well, before what you unfortunately witnessed occurred. So, perhaps we could just forget that it ever happened?”
“Well then why are we here?!” Malfoy shouted.
Harry stared almost transfixed as Draco started to undress himself. He hadn’t been able to look at him this openly before now, and now that he had been given the opportunity to just watch him, he wasn’t going to waste it. Draco was undeniably one of the most handsome men that Harry had ever seen, and Harry felt his body responding.
“Oh shit! I’m so sorry, Draco! Are you okay?” Harry asked, sincerely hoping that he hadn’t just ruined his chance of doing any of what Draco had offered.
Harry just stared at him. He once again thought he must be hallucinating.
“I know. Look, I need to head off, I’m going out tonight with Seamus and a couple of the other guys from work. You’ll be alright?”
Harry just blinked. Malfoy had fantasised about him? Instead of saying something intelligent, all he could think to ask was, “what magazine?”
Draco’s shock was only clear for a moment before he shook his head and smiled, answering simply, “I love you too.”
“Let me guess. You happened to see my latest interviewee leaving?”
“How does that help?! Harry, do you have any idea how seriously inappropriate this is? This could end your career, you know. Human Resources don’t look fondly upon any kind of fraternisation in the workplace, and with this kind of power imbalance? I don’t like your odds.”
“What does?” Malfoy asked, looking at him in confusion.
“I want to,” Harry assured him quickly, realising that he was answering both the question that Draco was asking now, and the one that had been playing around in his own head for the last hour. “I mean, not just that. I mean, definitely that, but also more? Um, yeah.”
“Look, I better get going,” Hermione said. “I have a firecall scheduled with the French Minister in an hour and I really better prepare. I expect to hear all about your proposed new employee by the end of the day though, Harry!”
“How do you figure that?” Harry asked.
“Understandable. But you didn’t want to do higher education in the wizarding world?” Harry asked.
Pansy shook her head. “You really are clueless, darling. Although I suppose in this case I can forgive you on account of you being rather occupied trying to save our world. The people adore you. And they’re being remarkably compliant.”
Malfoy just mumbled incoherently, pushing the globes of his arse into Harry’s hands as much as he was able to without coming off the desk.
“Shocking. You mean you think it would be a bad look were one of your students to come across a partly used bottle of lube in the middle of a remedial Defence Against the Dark Arts session?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “As eloquent as ever, Potter. Fine, I’ll admit that it would be something of a fantasy for me since seeing you splashed across that ridiculous magazine for the last few years.”
The moment seemed to go on for eternity, and then he gave a yelp as he felt a hand wrap around his cock. He had no idea if Harry could hear him or not, but if he kept doing what he was doing, Draco honestly wasn’t going to be entirely interested in conversation anyway.
“Wow, Harry,” Draco sighed. “Fuck, you’re stunning.”
“Spit it out, Draco,” Harry laughed.
“Yeah, of course,” Harry answered, stepping back to allow Draco to enter. “Wait, Hermione told you to find me here? How did she find you?”
“I’m sorry, what did you say, Pansy?”
Harry shook his head quickly. “No, um, I mean yes, I’m satisfied. You can go, Scorpius.”
“So, what did you think?” Dean asked hurriedly. “Sorry, I know he was your first interview, but I just happened to see him leaving and thought I’d be cheeky.”
Judging from the shape and packaging of the boxes this year, the biggest threat seemed to be to his waistline. Given that he’d tediously had to accept Witch Weekly’s ridiculous Bachelor of the Year award for the last five years since his divorce however, perhaps scoffing as many chocolates as he could manage was in fact a brilliant plan.
“Wh-what did you say?” Harry choked out.
“Hang on,” he heard Harry say, “be patient. I’ve got something else I want to try.”
“And how do I know what that is?”
Instead, he would make do with a glass of firewhiskey and listening to a ridiculous programme on the wireless to take his mind off things. He could hope that he might bump into Draco somewhere; now that he would be based in Britain again it was possible that they would come across each other. The wizarding population in the country wasn’t so large after all.
It was Aoife’s turn to laugh now. “People always ask me that! But you know, it’s not all that different to any other job. I learned a lot. I’d never had to be so well organised before in my life than when I was trying to coordinate the schedules of a busy family. And yet, I don’t think anything could be quite as rewarding as it either. So, challenging, fascinating, full on and fun, plus a million things in between. That’s how I’d describe it.”
“I should probably go,” Malfoy said. “Thanks for meeting with me, Potter. It was more than I expected, really. I know this hasn’t exactly gone brilliantly, but I’m glad you heard me out.”
“Yes,” Harry said, almost out of reflex, making himself look directly at Malfoy. “Sure. Um, it’s fine.” Harry sat there awkwardly for another moment, playing with the hem of his sleeve.
“Excellent,” Draco said, stepping forward to give Harry a quick kiss on the cheek. “I’ll look forward to it.”
“I’m sorry, I was just trying to get something nice, and well, I mean it was Dad’s idea, but he promised that it was a favourite of yours back in your school days!”
“Oh. Right.”
“Well, I don’t know, I mean obviously we’re capable of getting along better now than we did at school.” Malfoy snorted, but waved for Harry to continue. “Maybe we could, um, start talking? You know, get to know each other better.”
“Am I?” Draco asked drily.
“Alright, err, sorry,” Harry replied stupidly, his mind beginning to fog over as he locked his eyes on Malfoy’s bottom, his cock becoming painfully hard. He stepped closer towards Malfoy, the dildo still clasped tight in his hand.
“Hmm. I’ll consider it. We should probably see how the first date goes though. Wouldn’t want to rush into anything too soon.” He winked exaggeratedly for effect and Harry just laughed again.
“Fuck,” Harry sighed, letting himself for the first time just admire Malfoy’s body openly, looking at his long lines and sharp angles, the pointy appearance from his youth having softened slightly with age. Harry’s body was certainly responding, and almost without thinking, he’d let a hand wander down to palm at his cock through his trousers.
Draco took the paper she was offering, and gave it a quick glance. Only a few sentences in and he was already blushing. Pansy hadn’t been lying, whoever these people were, they were clearly big fans of his updates, and what’s more, they seemed to be big fans of his.
“You didn’t want him to leave, did you? So I have to ask Harry - do you like him?”
Malfoy laughed, a bright, delightful sound that Harry would never have associated with him. “Oh, Potter, I don’t hate you. It’s been twenty years! I think we’ve moved on from our old school grudges, haven’t we?”
“Draco! Oh, thank you, I was worried you wouldn’t talk to me.”
Draco smiled at his son, taking the empty seat next to him. “Everything is fine, Scorpius, don’t worry. I think your Professor might even apologise to you. I made it clear that it was necessary that he do so.”
“It’s just - it’s actually... what it is, is that I was wondering...”
“Never mind,” Harry sighed, running his hand distractedly through his hair. Instead of leaving though, Malfoy stepped back towards Harry, with a curious look on his face.
“That’s not what I meant! I’m not going to use it.”
“Wecouldprobablytouchotherstuff.”
“You keep saying that, Potter. What is it that’s confusing you?”
Harry couldn’t believe that he was doing this, that he was about to take out and start waving about a bloody sex toy in the middle of his office in front of a student and Malfoy, but he supposed worse things had happened in his life.
“Well, if you didn’t, I really had been overestimating my skills.”
He could feel that Harry was similarly effected, as they ground their lower bodies against each other. Draco knew he could come just like this, just from rubbing against Harry in the middle of his lounge in broad daylight, and he found that he didn’t particularly care.
Malfoy kept grinning at him, and inexplicably took a step towards him. “An image you like, Potter?”
“Your cock there all ready for me?”
She surveyed him carefully for a moment. “You have an idea, don’t you? But you don’t think I’ll like it. Come on, Malfoy, you should know by now that I’ll at least hear you out.”
“You know, Potter, I have no idea why you’d be so upset about receiving that anyway. It’s very good quality.”
Harry shook his head, and ran his hands gently up and down Malfoy’s arms, in what he hoped was a consoling gesture. “Nothing, not like what you’re thinking. You just looked so smug, and I don’t know... it was kind of adorable.”
“Don’t blame me for this!”
All too soon they broke apart, but Harry didn’t step back. They were both breathing heavily, but Harry was relieved to see that Malfoy wasn’t looking like their kiss had disgusted him. Quite to contrary, he was looking rather pleased with himself, and Harry couldn’t stifle a small chuckle.
“Well, tell Hermione that she can take one of these so called great candidates, and I’ll have you.”
Harry looked up from his desk when he heard Hermione’s voice issuing from his doorway.
“Harry, are you asking me out?”
“Well I mean, last I checked, as a gay man myself I thought I could choose whether or not I liked certain foods. But you’re telling me now that supposedly gifting treacle tarts to a gay man is a bloody hate crime and I’m curious as to why!”
“Now just you wait one second there, Malfoy. I didn’t say you could take it. What would you do with it anyway?”
Harry shrugged, relaxing more now than he had since Malfoy had arrived. “Thanks. I know it could be worse, but I just hate the intrusion into my life. Bloody hard to do anything without someone turning up and trying to photograph me. They had a whole article exposing my indecision when it came to brands of bread, and what that said about me.”
“Yeah. It’s me,” Potter admitted. “I know you must think I’m weird. I just... I haven’t really been able to go out lately. I tend to only go to Muggle places, it keeps me from being harassed. And then recently...”
Draco laughed and made himself comfortable on one of the armchairs in the small living room of Harry’s flat, while Harry sat on the sofa across from him. “She didn’t have to work hard to find me, you know. I was looking like a fool standing outside your office waiting for you to come back. Fortunately she came past and directed me here. She said you probably wouldn’t mind.”
They stood there in silence for what felt like an eternity, but must have only been a few seconds. Harry was so conflicted. On the one hand his brain was telling him that this was ridiculous and he should be chasing Malfoy out of his office with a stinging hex for good measure.
“I’m close,” Harry grit out.
“So where have you been living then?”
“Yes!” Draco cried. “Fuck, yes, that’s brilliant, Harry. Please don’t stop.”
Harry’s eyes widened suddenly with a look of understanding. “Right! Okay. Of course, you should go. Don’t you have to meet Hermione first?”
“Wouldn’t you love to know? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I better get dressed and go to meet my son for dinner. I don’t think he’d believe me even if I told him what we did, but nonetheless, best to avoid any awkward conversations.”
“Do you really want me?” Draco asked quietly. “Only I’d quite like to kiss you now, but only if that’s something you’d be interested in.”
“At least I can see your face,” Draco conceded, reaching out and running his hand gently along Harry’s cheek. “I don’t know what I’d do if I couldn’t see you at all.”
“Yeah,” he eventually responded.
Bugger. Harry knew that was a stupid suggestion. He had a few that he usually relied on, but none of them were quite right for this situation.
“You do like that don’t you? You know, we could resolve the whole question of who keeps that delightful toy in a different way.” Malfoy was pinning him with a questioning look, some of his bravado fading a little as he tried to gauge Harry’s response.
“What?” Malfoy asked, an air of defensiveness creeping into his voice. “What’s funny?”
Harry hurriedly summoned his wand and conjured something to cover both himself and Draco, who was now sitting on the floor attempting to protect his modesty. Harry finally turned to face Hermione, who was looking more furious by the second.
“And yet, somehow, I don’t think that’s what you’re really worried about right now. And if it’s not my reaction that’s bothering you, then I’m left to guess that it’s Malfoy’s.”
“You’re ready for a second?”
“Yes,” Dean replied.
Harry had to force himself to take several deep breaths. Why the hell would Draco Malfoy have had any thoughts on Harry’s habits back when they were at school? He could believe that the absolute bastard would find this all very funny, although why he would drag his own son into it was beyond him really. He clearly hadn’t grown up in the slightest, regardless of what Hermione said.
“You haven’t been able to go anywhere because of the restrictions,” Draco finished for him. “I’m sorry,” he said, and was surprised that he genuinely meant it. “You know it’s the only thing we can do.”
Harry laughed. “No complaints here! It’s, um, not really something I’m into either. So I guess that’s good?”
“I think I’ll manage,” Harry replied croakily.
“Well, of course she would make the most sense,” Pansy said, a much too wicked smile on her face, “but she’s terribly busy, darling. So you see, as head of this charming department, you’re it.”
“While I don’t know if you would have asked your previous secretary to do anything of the sort, I can assure you that I am particularly skilled in financial matters as well. You see I was recently offered a post at Gringotts - which I’m sure you can imagine would have been exceedingly lucrative for me personally - but I didn’t feel that it would give me enough opportunities for progression. So, naturally, if you need someone to assist with accounts in this department, then, of course, I’m your guy.”
So it was that one morning nearly two months into his six month house arrest, Draco had what may have been his best idea yet, or the beginning of a complete disaster. Not wanting to wait to find out which it was, he grabbed some floo powder and called Harry immediately.
It took a moment, but Potter finally lifted his head and looked at Draco, the bravery he was so renowned for shining through at last.
Draco nodded. “Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. Sorry I know you’re usually busy in the day, but you don’t just have a minute to talk do you?”
Three months had passed since Draco’s interview-turned-rendezvous in Harry’s office, and it felt to Harry as though it had all passed by in a blur. Harry had completed a one month suspension and a professional standards course over what had transpired that day, on Hermione’s insistence that as Minister, she simply had to report something of that nature to Human Resources.
“Yes there is, you utter moron. The fact that you’re stuck here, and no matter how much I plead to the bloody minister, I’m not allowed to come and see you.”
“I’ve done it before,” Harry answered after a moment, “but you still have to tell me if I’m hurting you. I’ve never done it with you.”
He’d only just finished the last of his toast when he heard the floo chime. Not bothering to rush there right away, he helped himself to a large swig of pumpkin juice, as he finally heard Harry’s voice calling out to him.
Draco couldn’t sit still any longer. He leapt to his feet, Potter following suit seconds later, a look of confusion crossing his face.
Harry looked up and groaned. Dean was grinning down at him, the pile of résumés he’d just deposited on Harry’s desk feeling more to him like an unstable potion than anything to smile about.
“Relax, Potter. I have to say, I struggle to understand why you, of all people, would do such a thing. Care to enlighten me?”
“Well that’s a relief. Not that I minded the bit of role play that followed to be honest... although when do I ever mind the chance to bend you over the kitchen table and have my way with you? Now come on, a few minutes ago you were desperate for food, or so I recall.”
“Just waiting here, Potter,” Malfoy said cheekily, sighing dramatically for effect, and stretching out further across the polished wood of Harry’s desk.
Perhaps he shouldn’t be surprised. After all Scorpius and his own son Albus were very good friends, and Harry had to admit that Scorpius had always been pleasant when he’d been over to visit. Thankfully Harry hadn’t had to see too much of his father along the way, even if Hermione repeatedly told him that he was petty for holding on to school grudges.
“Is that right?” Potter asked softly.
“Can I help you?”
The answering snort was a little much in Harry’s opinion, but it was softened somewhat when Draco stood up and walked over to him, placing his knees either side of Harry’s thighs and kissing him clean on the mouth.
“Is that a yes then?” Harry said, when they resurfaced for air.
Silence fell between them, and Harry wished that the floor could swallow him up. Perhaps he could invent an emergency that would require the Head Auror to rush away. Was it too much to ask for a Dark Wizard to start firing off curses downtown to save him from his embarrassment?
“No, you know I don’t think we can, Professor. What on earth would the papers make of you discussing such things with your students?”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t think so. It’s possible there was one and it fell somewhere when I accidentally knocked everything on the floor though.”
“Yes, but how am I, of all people, reassuring to the public?” Draco insisted.
“Ah! Yes!” Malfoy shrieked suddenly, and Harry grinned, realising that he must have found that special spot inside of him. Keen to hear him cry out again, Harry pulled out slightly, before pushing the toy back inside Malfoy’s body more roughly than he had previously.
“You’re right,” he conceded, slumping further in his chair. “I’ve been stupid. I don’t know what I was thinking.”
“Yes,” Harry admitted. “It’s hardly a secret. Didn’t have much chance of that with the bloody Prophet following me around.” He shook his head and sighed, clenching and releasing his fists as he remembered that particular story breaking.
Malfoy reached his hand out and ran his hand down Harry’s cheek. “You’re sure, Potter? I don’t want you to do anything that you’re not comfortable with. But if you are sure, I’ll strip my trousers off this second and bend myself over that fine looking desk of yours.”
Throwing caution to the literal flames, Draco threw in some floo powder again, stripped his trousers and pants off, and then flung his lower body into the fireplace, hoping against all hope that the worst that would happen is that he’d be sent tumbling back out onto the cold tiles of his hearth.
“Your what? Potter you’re not making any sense.”
Harry sighed, knowing that Hermione was right. He’d been an idiot to do this, but he’d gotten carried away in the moment and let his urges override his common sense.
Scorpius appeared to visibly relax next to him. “That’s great, Dad, thank you. I know it’s silly to worry about it, but I am glad that he actually liked that cake.”
“It’s a long time, Harry. You’ve already complained about not getting to have sex for that long, but really there’s nothing stopping you.”
“You could, you know,” Malfoy groaned.
“I’ll let you know how I go,” he responded eventually.
“Excellent. So what exactly did you have in mind for me to touch then?”
Scorpius looked concernedly between his father and Harry for a moment, as if trying to figure out if he had really heard correctly. Clearly deciding that he may as well take his chances, he scooped his parchment and quill back into his bag, and headed straight for the door.
Draco nodded, a strange tingling rising in his body. He hadn’t quite believed it, not until he’d seen Potter in the flesh. But it was certainly true, Potter really had been the one to write all of those things, which could only mean one thing.
“What?”
Harry felt inwardly thrilled at the praise. He was still half worried that Malfoy would turn around and tell him how shit he was at this. He never would have believed it before today, but he sincerely wanted Malfoy to enjoy this now.
She laughed, tucking her long, dark hair behind her ears. “And that’s where you’re wrong. Seriously, Draco. There’s a whole newsletter here. Read it.”
“Leave it with me, Draco,” she replied with another grin.
“Hi,” Harry said, trying to hide the shock from his voice.
“Is this meant to be funny, Potter?”
Draco groaned. “Why did I hire you as my assistant again?”
What really was driving him crazy, as he had known that it would, was the lack of contact with Harry. In the year that they’d been together, they’d never gone so long without physical contact. Especially the intimate kind. The odd touch of each other’s face as they floo called back and forth really just didn’t cut it.
“Is that what you want?” Harry asked quietly.
Harry nodded. “Thanks, Dean. You didn’t have to do that.”
Harry hastened to comply, working a second finger inside Malfoy’s body. It slid in more easily than the first, which Harry took as an indication that Malfoy was relaxing into what they were doing.
“You don’t have to go,” Harry tried to say, but Draco just shook his head.
A very red-faced Hermione was standing shell shocked in the door, a pile of papers having scattered to the floor at her feet. Draco pulled back from Harry in alarm, causing the remainder of Harry’s release to splash across his face.
“No,” Harry said, “they’ve already written what they want to write about us. Come on, Draco, they’ve known about us for weeks now, surely that means we can hold hands without any drama?”
Slowly, he bent down to retrieve the box and it’s deeply disturbing contents. He didn’t care that Scorpius was days away from leaving Hogwarts forever, there was no way that he could let this slide. What kind of a sick joke was this?
“It’s Potter,” Pansy said. “Harry Potter is the head of your fan club.”
Harry frowned. “You mean that’s happened here?”
“There’s a difference between moving past school grudges and asking your former enemy to shove a dildo up your arse!”
“Excellent! I’ll talk to you then.”
“Then we risk the statute being broken beyond repair,” she sighed. “One hundred Muggles this week alone have witnessed obvious magic. How?”
Malfoy held out his hand, and Harry grasped it, feeling his palm start to sweat as they exchanged a brief shake of hands.
Harry nodded, quickly casting his usual privacy charms on the documents in his office to ensure they were secured before he left. He held his hand out to Draco, who took it after a brief moment of hesitation.
“You don’t?” Potter asked, looking rather shocked.
“Can you not find out who runs it?” Draco asked Pansy. “You’re always so good with little detective work.”
For the first time, Draco felt a pang of nervousness that had nothing to do with whether or not his idea was feasible, and was entirely to do with Harry’s reaction.
Scorpius nodded and scurried off, and not for the first time Harry was left wishing that the invitation to families of departing students had never been extended. As he heard the door click closed behind Scorpius, he turned to face the elder Malfoy, bracing himself for the explosion. It never came.
“Look, Potter, if you’re not going to even use that, I could always take it off your hands. After all, I’m a single man, and such things do come in handy.”
“Oh. Right,” Harry said.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh again, aware that this probably wasn’t the response that Malfoy would hope for after sex. Harry didn’t think he could pull off some kind of suave indifference though, so grinning like an excited crup would have to suffice.
“So? Wouldn’t you love to come down my throat, Harry?”
“I know,” he sighed, “but you wouldn’t have liked this guy either, Hermione. He was so full of himself. But don’t worry, I did like the woman that I just interviewed. You can go and tell Dean that so he doesn’t worry about me attacking him or something.”
Harry started to wonder if he’d ever get Dave out of his office. This was only the first interview, and if the other two were like this then Harry wouldn’t be surprised if his head had exploded by the end of the day.
Harry took a minute to process what she was saying. “You mean... you think he might want to see me again?”
Harry just groaned in response, palming himself through his trousers. Malfoy was fully naked now, and was inexplicably bending over to fold all his clothes by hand, giving Harry a wonderful view of his arse. Harry had to take several deep breaths to stop himself from spilling his load right then.
“What- um, what are you proposing?” Harry choked out, his voice much more high-pitched than he ever recalled it being.
“Hermione, listen, let me explain-”
Again, Malfoy huffed at him before answering. “If you must know, I had a brief relationship with the man’s son, and it didn’t end well. He got a little clingy, and I said some unkind things to help break it off... but needless to say that the Minister didn’t appreciate his darling little boy being spoken to in that way. So, it seemed a good opportunity for me to come home.”
“Well, what would you like to ask me then? You know, in terms of my qualifications for being your secretary?”
Draco looked at her. “Well, yes, I can tell that people are complying, that’s why the Obliviators haven’t been overrun... but that’s more likely to be the Minister’s influence than mine.”
Dean sighed dramatically and flopped into the chair across from Harry. “Seriously, mate. You know I’d love to help you out, but working for Hermione’s good for me. I’ve gone through all the candidates and I think those are the best for you. Interviews are set up for tomorrow.”
“Me!” Harry squeaked. “I thought your idea was for you to try it first! I don’t want my bits to be set on fire! Or turned into a bloody firework display.”
“Really? Then why did it have a little thank you note from him attached?”
“I think you’re a bloody sadist, is what I think,” Harry said. “What the hell were you thinking with that guy? He’s insane! Arrogant, rude, conceited... knobhead is what I thought best described him, even though I’m not certain it completely portrays just how awful he is!”
Chortling to himself with his own idea, he made to grab the parcel on top, but instead sent the entire stack crashing to the floor with a concerning cracking sound. Bloody hell, Harry thought.
“You will,” he promised, knowing full well that he’d never hear the end of it if she didn’t have all the details the moment he knew.
“We don’t know. Not yet. But we have to buy time to figure it all out.”
“I didn’t even know anyone did that,” Harry admitted, realising that with this admission he risked sounding rather stupid.
“Well, I haven’t only been based there. Potter, you have read my résumé, haven’t you?”
“Oh, believe me, you’ll have a hard time stopping yourself from snogging me once I’ve told you this news, but please refrain yourself. That would be entirely inappropriate.”
“Look, I know you’re angry, but don’t be ridiculous. You know how packed those clubs are. It was just a night out with some mates, we drank, we danced, and then I went home to my bed, all alone because my ridiculously gorgeous but equally idiotic boyfriend got himself put on house arrest.”
“So what made you decide to leave Finland then? Get too cold for you?”
“Can I say something, please, Minister?”
“You know back in school I couldn’t have imagined you ever saying anything like that about Hermione.”
“What?” Harry asked, intrigued. “What is it?”
“I’m sorry, Harry. Really sorry, you have no idea. But I have to go.”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that. He quickly pinched himself under the desk to make sure that he hadn’t somehow fallen asleep and started experiencing an odd dream.
“Of course. Well, I can understand why you’d want to be here then. So, um, what were you doing before your job in Finland? Have you done secretary work before?”
“So you’re claiming you didn’t send me this?” Harry asked, waving the ridiculously large toy above his head like some kind of madman.
“No, I guess not.”
“Yes, you fucking me. Wouldn’t you like that?”
From the odd passing comments he’d heard from Granger, it seemed that he still saw plenty of her and Weasley, but he otherwise spent his time alone in his large house in London. And apparently, he occupied himself by watching Draco at 1pm each day.
“I didn’t bite his head off,” Harry insisted, “I just pointed out that he chose a complete nutcase for me to interview.”
“Why not? Unless all the many stories about your sexuality were in fact lies.”
“So... do you, erm, accept my apology?” Malfoy asked finally, startling Harry who realised he’d been silent for an uncomfortably long time.
He was delighted to see that his words actually made Harry flush, a deep red surging it’s way up through his neck and into his face.
Draco gawped at him. “One time that happened!”
Harry laughed quietly. “I’m sorry about that. Look, Malfoy, you do have some great experience-”
Harry ran his hand along his neck again, noticing the first signs of a headache setting in. He didn’t want to admit that he might be wrong, because that would mean admitting that he’d called in a barely-of-age student to his office and brandished a dildo at him, which probably wasn’t what the school board would consider professional conduct.
Harry gulped. Malfoy had a point, but he didn’t want to admit it. “I’ve never tried to say I was brave,” he said instead, “other people have done that for me. But I’ve never claimed to be that myself.”
Harry looked up from the arrest report he was reading to see Draco standing next to his desk, his arms folded over his new robes and a small frown on his face.
He knew he sounded like a complete idiot, and he wouldn’t blame Malfoy for choosing now to point this out. How could he have ever forgotten that mess of gifts that he’d created? It wouldn’t be hard to believe that a card could come unstuck under such circumstances.
“She’s always been clever,” Harry said, not bothering to hold back his grin.
In the moments after Malfoy had spilled over Harry’s hand and onto his desk, Harry suddenly became very aware that he was still inside Malfoy’s body, and perhaps this would no longer be welcome. Very gently, he pulled himself out, quickly casting a cleaning charm on himself as he saw Malfoy turn around and do the same.
“I guess that’ll have to do for now. Look, love, I have to get to work, I just wanted to make sure you were fine first, okay? I’ll call you again tonight.”
The articles about Harry’s life while he was, according to the papers, “free” from Draco, had continued. Draco was getting better at ignoring the stories of Harry’s many supposed conquests, even if he had torn up this morning’s paper into shreds with his bare hands before casting an Incendio at the remains. His tolerance only extended so far after all.
“No,” Harry answered truthfully, “I’m glad it happened. I mean, I had a great time.”
“Er, thank you, Professor. I’ll see you later. Are you coming, Dad?”
Draco pulled a graph out of his briefcase and sent a quiet word of thanks to Stevenson in his department for producing it before this meeting.
“Right!” Harry finally interjected, cutting Dave off in the middle of another rant about his excellent abilities in broomstick making. “Thank you, Dave. I appreciate how... forthright you’ve been today. I’m sorry, but we’ve about run out of time as I do have other appointments waiting. But thank you for coming in.”
Malfoy shrugged. “I wouldn’t expect you to. She doesn’t get out much, not since father was locked away.”
“No,” Harry answered swiftly, summoning his office chair to sit in and gesturing for Draco to sit in the seat he had been in earlier. “Of course not! How could you - either of you - think I’d do that?”
Draco sighed, moving to look at the head in his floo. He wished that he’d had the forethought to actually make himself look a little more put together before now, but there was no time for that.
Draco shook his head. He hated that they were in this position. Suddenly everything that they’d had in place for centuries to protect their world and their ways was crumbling around them. Glamours were failing in front of Muggles, the Knight Bus had suddenly appeared in the middle of Oxford Street, alarming hundreds of Muggles who’d been going about their shopping, and witches and wizards seemed to be spotted with their wands every other minute.
With a sudden rush of understanding, Harry felt himself turn red as he realised what had happened. “Um, yes? I didn’t think anything had got out of place though!”
“What did you tell him?”
“Why would it have to be casual?” Harry asked eventually, “do you not like dating or something?”
A look of relief swept across Draco’s face, before he grinned right back at Harry and closed the distance between them.
“To go away and get back to Human Resources. And that he should stop being so nosy.”
Pansy strolled into the office waving something above her head. “You are going to love me!” she squealed, doing a little twirl as she spoke.
“She is a little intimidating.”
“Is that okay, Draco? Can you hear me?”
Harry checked his watch. “Ten minutes. No idea who they are, but at least they can’t be worse than Dave, right?”
“Am I not? I just don’t see why you had to involve your son in this endeavour of yours. You want to revert to being the tosser you were at Hogwarts then fine, but why would you involve your own son? Great example you’re setting there.”
Draco laughed, throwing his head back and running a hand through his hair.
“Ah yeah, you’re right. I just don’t know what kind of a gift says ‘thank you for turning up the wireless and then lying to the Minister because I was too stupid to cast a silencing charm while my boyfriend fucked me in my office!’ And there aren’t many people I can ask for advice on the issue...”
“It’s lucky that I love you,” Harry said in exasperation, before suddenly realising what he’d just admitted.
“It’s okay,” Malfoy interrupted, “you don’t need to say it, Potter. I’m sure you’ve got someone else you’d rather employ. Like I said, thanks for your time, anyway.”
He had almost finished his firewhiskey when he heard the faint knock on the door. At first, he wasn’t sure if he was just hearing things, but then it came again more insistently, and Harry leapt up.
Pushing the tip of the toy into Malfoy felt like something out of a dream. The moans and grunts coming from Malfoy’s mouth did nothing to make it feel more real either, because before today Harry could never have imagined him making such filthy noises. Right now he was wondering just why he’d never thought of Malfoy in this way before.
Draco flushed immediately red, and choked slightly on his own saliva. “Oh,” he said, when he’d regained the ability to speak, “I, um, wasn’t sure if you’d want to. Or do anything else really.”
“No, Scorpius, I think I’d like a little word with Professor Potter here first. I’ll meet you for dinner in the Great Hall later.”
“I know today will be tough for you,” Hermione said consolingly, “but just keep in mind that you need to get someone new here. It’s been months now since Maja resigned, and you can’t keep trying to do everything yourself.”
“Come on, it’s not that bad, Harry. There are some decent candidates in there.”
“Oh no,” Potter groaned. “Oh no, oh no, oh no.”
“It’s okay, Potter. I’m quite aware that he deserves to be in Azkaban, I’m not arguing otherwise. But it would be a lie to say that it hasn’t taken a toll on my mother.”
Finally, Harry came with a shout. Much to his horror though, he realised that he wasn’t the only one shrieking inside his office.
“Sure,” Harry replied, frowning slightly at Dean’s comment. Why wouldn’t he be open minded to the candidates? “Thanks, Dean. I’ll let you know how I get on.”
When he flung the door open, it was to see a very nervous looking Draco peering carefully at him and biting at his bottom lip.
“I barely know him! I hadn’t seen him for a decade or so until today! I just thought... I don’t know what I thought, but it didn’t involve running out the door at the first opportunity.”
Harry knew that he couldn’t last long and he slowed down to tell Draco as much. Draco grinned, releasing Harry’s cock with a small popping sound.
This time it was Hermione who burst out laughing. “Yes,” she said emphatically, “yes I do, Harry. So go on, chase him down and tell him whatever it is that you need to tell him.”
“Hey! That’s not true,” Harry shot back. Well. Not entirely true.
“You know, Draco, I really don’t care, as long as you get me off, and fast. I got so fucking close just by tasting you and I’m ready to pop any moment here.”
“If we’re going to be dating, you should probably call me Harry now, you know.”
Unfortunately Harry had to agree. He just wished that this whole thing would sort itself out without any input from him.
Scorpius was looking at him puzzled. “Your gift, Dad? You didn’t get him anything did you? He wasn’t your Professor.”
“Oh, fuck, that’s brilliant,” Malfoy said breathily.
Harry gulped, and for the briefest of moments considered denying it. He reminded himself that he was supposed to be brave based on his house sorting, and more importantly that he’d been single for what felt like forever. “Yes. I’m asking you out.”
“What are you on about? Tell me why it is that Scorpius is here with you when he should be making the most of his last few days here?!”
“Well, it was a lot of different things, but an important part of the role was checking passenger manifests. You know, the list of who is on an aeroplane? And if there were any known wizarding families there, I could inspect their bags myself as they arrived, ensuring that a Muggle didn’t come across anything that they shouldn’t.”
“Nicely answered,” Harry admitted. “I’ve never had kids myself, but my godchildren can be a serious handful at times! They’re wonderful though, and I wish I had more time with them.”
The next few weeks passed painfully slowly. Draco wished that he could at least have a decent meal; for all that the food provided by the ministry fully met his nutritional needs, the taste varied from bland to even more bland.
“What?” Malfoy asked.
Draco nodded. “I’m sorry for running off before.”
“Yes, Potter, that’s it, I’m so close,” Malfoy babbled.
“It’s okay,” Draco said, cutting Potter off before he got too far into his rambling. “You haven’t done anything wrong, as such.”
“Um,” Harry started, feeling his face turn red.
“And I’ve told you before, Dean is brilliant and completely and utterly off limits to you. Besides, you know as well as I do that he’ll be moving soon enough. I’m actually going to recommend him for a managerial position in Human Resources. After everything he’s just done for you, I’d say he’s more than qualified.”
Malfoy snapped his eyes up to meet Harry’s as he stepped into his trousers. “Well what were you imagining? As you were so keen to point out before, we’ve barely spoken for twenty years. This was fun, Potter, but I hardly think you’d want it shouted about in the press. And you know full well that it would be if any kind of word got out.”
Harry startled when he realised that he was expected to say something at this point. “Uh, yeah, mmm. That’s great.”
Harry shook his head, but couldn’t hold back a smile. “Oh, you definitely hadn’t been overestimating your skills. It was... I mean, you were brilliant. Really brilliant. Honestly, it was so bloody good, Draco.”
“It does make up for it. I mean, not entirely, obviously. But it helps.”
“Why?”
“Are you asking me out?” Malfoy asked finally. “If you’re wanting to get to know me like you say... that sounds an awful lot like dating.”
“Me?!” Draco exclaimed. “Why on earth should I be doing a press conference? Surely the Minister is better positioned. People love listening to her.”
Harry felt his heart racing. Had Malfoy just called him attractive? He found himself oddly flushed with the compliment, but unsure exactly what to do now. In truth, it was strange that Malfoy could have this effect on him after a decade without having laid eyes on him. But Harry would be lying if he said that he didn’t find Malfoy attractive now.
Malfoy snorted softly, but it wasn’t anything like the cruel way in which Harry remembered him doing so at school. It was terribly close to sounding fond.
Harry didn’t disappoint, but he was quickly starting to feel that he’d like to get rid of the bloody toy and replace it with his own cock. Malfoy was driving him crazy and he was becoming desperate to get inside him.
Draco stared at him for a minute, his mouth opening and closing as though he were struggling with what to say next. Harry was starting to get concerned that he’d said something wrong when at last he noticed a smile starting to form at the edges of his mouth.
A heavy silence settled between them, as Hermione continued to look at him with disappointment, and Harry realised the seriousness of what he’d just done.
“These are our predictions for various scenarios. And as you can see, without a temporary cutting of ties...”
Draco hung his head, a sense of shame washing over him. Of course Harry was right. “I do trust you,” he whispered after a moment, “it’s just hard seeing that. Reading it all. I don’t know how I’ll cope for six months.”
“Here you go.”
“Well then. I suppose you better get rid of that face of yours from my fireplace and replace it with your bloody gorgeous cock.”
“That much is obvious,” Hermione huffed. “This looks bad, Harry. You could easily be accused of using your position to obtain... favours.”
“Know?” Draco supplied helpfully. “Because you’re about as subtle as a Hippogriff in a tea room, Harry. But don’t stop, because I do love knowing that all I need to do is call you ‘Potter’ and it earns me a free chocolate bar.”
Harry found himself nodding although he wasn’t sure why. It sounded to him like Draco was rejecting him on an offer that he wasn’t aware that he’d made.
Malfoy nodded and swept from the room, leaving Harry alone to his thoughts. It had all happened so quickly that he still worried this might be some elaborate dream he’d concocted. He pinched himself hard, and when it hurt him something wicked, he figured this must actually be reality.
It was a new kind of magic for Draco. He couldn’t believe that he was here, in Harry Potter’s lap, having the life kissed out of him by the one person with which he’d never believed he had a chance.
“Oh. So you weren’t fucking all those eager looking men?”
“Of course I don’t, Harry. Only you. It’s always been only you.”
Carefully, Harry pulled out the dildo from Malfoy’s arse and threw it on the floor. There’d be time to clear it up later, but right now his attention was most definitely elsewhere.
As he came down from his climax, he was aware that Malfoy still hadn’t gone over the edge himself, so he began to pump his fist up and down Malfoy’s cock more and more quickly. He could tell as Malfoy finally reached his own orgasm with his whole body tensing, and his breathing becoming shaky and uneven.
“You fascinate me, you know, Potter,” Malfoy said, his eyes searching Harry’s face.
Harry huffed. He didn’t need the reminder. It was one of a number of things that he and Ginny had fought about over the years, before Harry had finally realised the real reason that he didn’t feel comfortable in the relationship.
“It was, yes,” she said with a small chuckle. “Growing up I’d always thought that I’d go back to Ireland to study, but Professor Longbottom had connections that could get me into Birmingham University without the usual problems that wizards and witches face, so I couldn’t turn that down.”
“Draco! Are you there?”
He dropped the box from sheer shock when he first saw what was inside. “What the fuck?!” Harry yelled, a mixture of disbelief and pain from where the box had struck his toe coursing through him.
Malfoy just looked at him for a moment. “I beg your pardon?”
Harry didn’t need another invitation. As Draco recommenced his frenzied action, Harry let himself just enjoy the feeling, allowing his orgasm to build.
“Yes, Harry?”
“I won’t say that it wasn’t a little odd to read people’s opinions on my outfits each day... but when I found out that it was you who appreciated them the most, well, I can’t say I had any complaints.”
“I should go,” Malfoy said. “I’ll let you get back to saving the country.” With that he turned around and made his way toward the door.
“I guess.”
Hermione shook her head and sighed audibly. “Harry, you know I think you’re an excellent Auror, but you are honestly terrible at reading people when it comes to your personal life. You’re just being plain thick if you think that he ran out of this room to get away from you.”
Harry smiled, and thought to himself that this time Dean had done fairly well. She’d become more friendly as they’d talked, and he was starting to see a future in which they could work well together.
Malfoy stared at him intently for a few moments and Harry felt a blush rising in his cheeks. Perhaps he’d completely missed the mark with what he was asking, and Malfoy had only wanted this to be a one time thing. Harry couldn’t deny that he’d be disappointed with that now, but he hadn’t thought to ask before, and Malfoy had only ever said that having sex with him was a fantasy, nothing more.
“You’re really surprised? Come on, this is me we’re talking about.”
“Harry,” Draco breathed, deepening the kiss, and pushing his body up against Harry’s. They stumbled slightly, taking a few steps back towards the chair that Harry had vacated moments earlier, Draco sliding down Harry until he was straddling him in the chair.
After what felt like an age, but in reality was likely only a few seconds, Draco leant forward and took Harry’s length into his mouth.
He reached out towards Malfoy, and grabbed his hand. “Wait,” he said again, only with more urgency this time. He pulled Malfoy back towards him, until there were only centimetres separating them.
“Of course,” Harry replied sincerely. “I really don’t understand how it happened. Or who even sent it, they can’t have included a note.”
“That you used to love them back at school! Obviously he was wrong... I’m sorry, Professor, I’ll do the detention, just tell me what you want me to do.”
“No, no, it was no trouble,” Harry babbled, standing up himself, and starting to make his way round to where Malfoy was sitting. He had the strangest urge to try and make Malfoy stay, although he couldn’t entirely explain why he wanted that when he knew that he wasn’t going to hire him.
Dean looked quite taken aback. “Really? I don’t think he’s that bad, Harry. And he does have a lot of relevant experience. Did you know they even wanted him at Gringotts? You could do worse than him, mate.”
“Well, I’m aware. Does this mean we can get back to doing what we were doing? I was enjoying that.”
Granger groaned and sat back in her chair. “Well, I suppose we better work on a plan to sell this to the magical community.”
“I think you know, Potter. Here we are, two single gay men, and there’s a gorgeous, well made dildo in front of us. Is it hard to imagine what we might do?”
“I do?”
Harry sighed. They’d had this conversation several times already, and he couldn’t be bothered playing it out all over again. He’d liked Maja, had come to trust her completely, and it was hard to try and replace that.
“Hey,” Draco said lamely, with what he was sure would be a ridiculously soppy smile gracing his features.
Harry swallowed heavily. He had done this before, but he also knew that he wasn’t particularly experienced with men yet and if they were going to do this, he did want to make it good for them both.
Draco nodded. It was odd really, how well he and Granger worked together. It certainly hadn’t been an easy process when he’d first started in his role at the Ministry, but they’d both been professional enough to maintain a working relationship. These days he had to admit that he had developed a deep respect for her as Minister, and sometimes he was terribly worried that he liked her as a person.
“You definitely used to think I was an idiot,” Harry replied at last, “or at least you said I was often enough.”
“Right,” Harry heard himself saying, wondering when he’d started taking such care to follow commands issued by Draco Malfoy of all people. Probably when he’d bent over Harry’s desk and offered his arse to him really. That would’ve done it.
The rest of the interview passed without great incident, and after an hour, Harry found himself waving Aoife off with a much more positive feeling than he’d had at the end of Dave’s interview.
“I- I’m sorry, that was out of line. I didn’t mean- never mind.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, you are my boyfriend, so what else would I call you? If you’re back to worrying about that stupid article that implied I was paying you for some kind of services...
“It does,” Harry said, after a moment.
His cock seemed to be thinking only one thing though, and he decided he’d just have to risk it. He couldn’t go on for four more months like this, that much was certain, and maybe having his bits burnt off might help crush his libido a bit. Not that he would necessarily even count on that at this point.
“What is it? Is something wrong?” Harry asked.
“It’s been good to see you, Potter. Really,” he added when Harry snorted. “Not the type of rejection I’m used to getting from an attractive man, but hey, like they say, the right one is out there someone. The right job, I mean.”
“Touch me,” Malfoy commanded suddenly, “please Potter. Fuck; stroke me.”
“But why would you even want to?” Harry squeaked after a moment. “You hate me!”
“I’ve changed since school, Potter,” Draco said softly. “I thought you might have guessed that.”
Draco threw him a careful glance, before answering. “I think you know. But I have to ask - what happened in your office - did you, I mean, do you wish that it hadn’t happened?”
“Look, love, I know why you did it,” Harry continued, “but look what’s happened now. You knew they’d throw the book at you for anything to do with Muggles.”
“Hmm, you do have a good point there,” Harry conceded. “Come on then, get your kit off. I think I could quite enjoy having a look at all of you.” He followed this with what he hoped was a sexy wink, and from Draco’s reaction he could tell that he hadn’t succeeded, but that Draco didn’t really mind.
Harry dropped his head into his hands and groaned. Trust Malfoy to still be able to get to him after so long out of his life. This was exactly why he’d been avoiding him despite any assurances that he’d changed.
Much to Harry’s annoyance, Malfoy didn’t take the hint and just stop talking. He seemed determined to make this day as humiliating as possible for Harry, which he supposed was partly his own fault, but he still didn’t appreciate it.
“That item that you’re so terribly upset about receiving. Someone’s gone to some expense for you.”
“An excellent question, Potter, and I can understand why it might seem a little unusual that I’d apply for the role given our previous history. Honestly, I think I could do this job well, and I’d like the challenge. There’s a large variety of work, and it would be nice to be based back in Britain.”
Harry watched Dean leave his office. He didn’t bother looking at the résumés that he’d left behind. He could see the three which had been charmed to glow green, sitting amongst the others which now had a faint red hue. Harry would wait for tomorrow and see who turned up, preferring to go with his gut instinct when he met them.
“I’m not going to last long,” Draco warned breathlessly, his embarrassment of his stamina disappearing with every little lick that Harry gave him.
“Neither did I,” Harry said honestly, “but it’s true. Then again, you’ve always been good at making me see things differently, Malfoy.”
“So, bedroom then?” Harry asked.
Not for the first time in his life, Harry found himself feeling both impressed with, and cursed by, Hermione’s astute observation skills.
Harry was relieved to hear that Malfoy was close to spilling over, because he knew that he couldn’t prevent his own orgasm now for more than a few moments. He gave a couple of urgent, powerful thrusts into Malfoy, and then came with a startled cry.
“You know you should try this yourself sometime. Don’t be so afraid to have something up there, Potter. It feels bloody amazing once you get into it.”
Finding Draco was easier said than done. He had been long gone from the Ministry by the time Harry had tried to follow him, and he’d now spent over an hour trying to track him down.
“Good,” Hermione said, relieved. “Now, you’re feeling confident on what you’ll ask? You don’t want any last minute advice on interviewing techniques?”
Harry wondered for a moment if his initial assessment had been fair. One word wasn’t enough to sum up everything that was wrong with Dave. Just how stuck up could one man be? He was somehow a more extreme version of Percy Weasley, and that was something that Harry had hoped to never come across, even if he must admit that he had started to get along quite well with Percy as they’d grown older.
“Well, Harry, are you just going to stand there all day or are you going to come over here and help us both have a good time?”
Two weeks passed by. Draco’s life had become so incredibly busy that he barely had time to breathe. He was grateful though that they seemed to be making progress. There had only been three instances of Muggles needing to have Obliviators deal with them the day before.
That had Malfoy laughing, and Harry was surprised to find how happy he was to get that reaction from the other man. “Well, Potter, to be honest, how did you not know what you were going to get before going into the store?”
From experience, Harry knew better than to pick an argument with Draco when he was hungry. In fact, these days whenever Draco started calling him insults or referring to him as ‘Potter’, Harry would immediately summon the nearest sweet treat and wait for Draco to return to his usual self, which at least softened the insults.
Malfoy sighed dramatically, and threw his arms in the air. “You’ve barely spoken to me for twenty years, and yet you seem convinced that after all this time I’d still want to make fun of you like we’re teenagers again?”
Draco smiled, and Harry looked at him questioningly. “What is it?”
“Yes, sir,” Scorpius said quietly, pulling out a piece of parchment and a quill as he sat down.
Harry laughed, and successfully distracted Draco with another kiss that left them both hard and gasping in no time. Harry let his hands wander down and grab hold of Draco’s arse, taking great delight in gripping the firm cheeks as Draco ground his hips up and down on top of Harry’s cock, which was straining inside his trousers.
“Of course! How is it fair that I’m being punished too? Only... he didn’t entirely see it that way. So no visits, I’m afraid.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s nothing,” he lied, “I’m fine. I’m guessing you’re going to have more to say to me though?”
“What - no, you’re just winding me up. Look, I’m sorry about all this with Scorpius, I’ll apologise to him later, but then could we just please forget that this happened?”
Harry pulled back slightly. “Is that a problem?”
His concern had been for nothing if Draco’s answering groan was anything to go by. Harry was thrilled to see that Draco was just as hard as he himself was, and that he appeared to be equally effected by this whole experience.
“Are we just going to stand here then?” Malfoy answered. “Or will I be able to kiss you sometime this century?”
“I am. I’ll be so grumpy soon that you’ll have to summon something from Honeydukes.”
“Thanks for coming in,” Harry said at last, releasing Malfoy’s hand and stuffing his hands awkwardly into his pockets for lack of anything better to do with them.
“I am really sorry,” Harry said imploringly, “I didn’t mean to! You just... got me a bit excited.”
Draco made an angry tutting noise. “Hardly. Although I can’t promise I’ll be polite if one starts talking to us like that again.” He didn’t even need to see Harry to know that he’d rolled his eyes.
“I can’t believe you, Harry,” she cut in. “What the hell are you thinking? Is this what you’ve been doing with the candidates? The test to see if you could get along - did you mean you got them to do - to do that to you?”
“Yes,” Malfoy said again. “Fine,” he sighed, noting Harry’s raised eyebrows, “perhaps more than a little. But, I’d appreciate if we could put that behind us. For what it’s worth, I am sorry for what I did to you in school, and you know... after.”
Harry nodded, although he wasn’t quite sure that he did fully understand Malfoy. He remained as much of a puzzle as he had been at school, just now Harry was feeling more and more as though he were a puzzle that Harry wanted to solve.
“I’m just grateful that she listened to me,” Draco admitted. “Plenty of Ministers wouldn’t, and in that case... well. All I can say is that I’m glad we had her in charge.”
Harry smiled, realising that despite his earlier thoughts about Malfoy still being a git, he did believe what he was saying. Perhaps he was still a git, just a more refined one.
“Hey, Dad,” Scorpius greeted warmly as Draco approached him at the Slytherin table. “Is everything okay with you and Professor Potter? He doesn’t still think it was me that sent that thing does he?”
“With us?” Draco finished for him, and Harry nodded. “Yes, of course I’m aware that the average idiot on the street can’t accept our relationship, but I would have expected the Wizengamot to hold themselves to a higher standard.”
It was truly glorious feeling Draco licking and sucking so enthusiastically around him. Harry threaded his fingers gently into Draco’s hair, loving the feel of Draco’s head bobbing backwards and forth as he sucked him.
Their kiss was slow and gentle as they began to ease into this new, unfamiliar territory between them. Harry felt Malfoy’s hand gently rubbing at his back, and he relaxed into the surprisingly tender touch.
Pansy laughed, waving her wand at the discarded file and making it soar over to Draco’s cabinet.
“Now, come on, we both need food. Plus I’m dying to hear what it was like working for Hermione. Tell me, is she really as tough on her secretary as Dean always implied?”
“You know I don’t like it either when people react like that to us kissing,” Harry sighed, “but Draco you can’t just punch people in the face every time you hear some kind of homophobic comment!”
“I don’t know, Harry, trust your gut. Isn’t that what you’re so famed for doing?”
“It wouldn’t be a problem, Potter. Look, if you can’t put our history behind you then that’s fine...”
Malfoy did bend himself over the desk at that point and wiggled his arse at Harry just to emphasise his point. Harry had to take a moment to compose himself before he felt he could safely cast the spell to rid himself of his clothes without accidentally vanishing his own cock along with them.
Draco scoffed defensively in reply. “Well she wasn’t the Minister for Magic back then, was she?”
“I must remember to choose gifts appropriately,” Harry responded after a moment, pleased with himself for the quick thinking. “Let’s say two hundred times. I should think that will be enough, and then we’ll forget this whole thing.”
“No problem,” Harry said.
“I have,” Potter replied. “I think that was a lot of what made your updates so fascinating to me. You’re so genuine, and caring, and I’ve always been drawn to you somehow. But seeing how you spoke now compared to back then... it was nice.”
“Well, that sure is one way to start a conversation about our kinks I guess,” Draco said.
Draco sighed, resigning himself to the fact that Harry was actually correct, and being the stubborn fool that he was, might be there for half the day if Draco didn’t answer him.
Pansy was looking at him curiously. “You haven’t seen it, have you?”
“And then I told the Brazilian Ambassador in no uncertain terms that there was really no need to make such a fuss about one little escaped dragon! I mean honestly. How fortunate that I’m fluent in Portuguese, wouldn’t you say?”
“Any idea when that might be?”
“I promise that I didn’t do or say anything that he took objection to,” Draco replied calmly. “He assures me that he did enjoy your actual gift, and he’ll pass on those sentiments to you when he gets the chance.”
“You’ll be fine. And you know that Granger will join you when necessary, so you don’t need to worry about the politics of it all. Just tell the people that their efforts aren’t in vain, and you’ll win everyone over.”
“Alright,” Harry muttered finally, “I’m just going to conjure a little more lube and then I’ll give you that finger you’ve been so keen for.”
“Stop!” Harry cried. “Far out, Malfoy. Just... that’s a bloody image.”
Potter flushed bright red at that, and brought his hands up to his face.
“What are you grinning at, Potter?”
Malfoy shot him a slightly surprised look, before covering it with a small cough and saying, “well, my last job was in Finland, as I’m sure you know. I was working for their Ministry at Helsinki Airport, trying to intercept any witches or wizards flying into the country who may have brought contraband items with them.”
“Well, Potter? You going to stand there looking or actually do something?”
His question was met with an incredulous look. “You can’t seriously be asking me that, Potter? Me, the villain of the war, left free to roam the streets? Oh yes, people are generally delighted to see me and beg me to sit down for a drink with them. Right.” Malfoy crossed his arms, and this time didn’t hold back from rolling his eyes at Harry.
“Of course it is! No one else would have got more than a fine. But you know the public still struggles...”
To his eternal gratitude, Hermione had managed to ensure that no word as to why he’d been suspended ever reached the press. Harry hoped that people assumed he’d had to go rogue to bring down some dangerous criminal and save countless lives, rather than that he had used an interview as a chance to get laid.
“Goodbye, Harry. And my apologies, Minister, for what you saw. I assure you that I usually conduct myself much more professionally.”
“Well, well, Potter. I had no idea that you’d be so curious about what I get up to. What would you like to know? How I’d carefully work myself open, using just enough lube to make sure that I could fit the tip of that in? Then I’d carefully insert it further and further until it was deep enough inside me to make my head spin...”
Harry looked at the two Malfoy men sat in front of him, and for the first time felt his confidence waning. The elder looked irate and ready to explode at any moment, while Scorpius was looking confused and a little nervous.
Harry shook his head, and turned to face Malfoy again. “Fine. Althoug I should point out that I have excellent taste in restaurants. There you go, that’s something you’ve learnt about me.”
“Goodbye, Harry. I might see you round.” Malfoy gave him what seemed like an almost sad smile as he turned around, and finally Harry clicked.
Harry nodded, unable to argue with Malfoy’s shrewd observations. He just wished that he knew what exactly Malfoy wanted from him now. Bravery was only useful so long as one had an inkling of when they needed to use it.
Almost on cue, a knock sounded on the door that Harry just knew would be Dean. Sure enough, the door swung open to reveal his tentative smile aimed in Harry’s direction.
“No, not at all. It’s a completely inappropriate gift as I think I’ve said repeatedly, and it’s the reason why we’re here.”
“I should warn you, Harry, that I’m very, very good at this. Just be prepared.”
A laugh rang out threw Harry’s office as Dean stood there shaking his head. “You know, Harry, only you would have that as your deciding factor in hiring someone. It’s fine if they’re useless, as long as we can have a good yarn! Good luck, mate, two to go!”
“I’m not the one acting like a teenager that just discovered the joys of sex. But hey, I’m flattered,” he added, pushing himself up from the desk and summoning his clothes. “You didn’t entirely disappoint me I must say.”
“No card on the actual gift Scorpius sent then? They didn’t just get switched?”
“Yessss, Potter,” Malfoy hissed. “Come on. Give me a finger.”
Right, so that was how he wanted to play it, Harry thought. He had to admit that Malfoy seemed to have changed somewhat, certainly in terms of appearance. His hair had grown slightly, giving him a more relaxed look than he’d ever had at school. His clothing too was different; he had chosen to incorporate some Muggle fashion elements into his outfit, the dark wizarding robes falling over an elegant suit. Harry had to admit that he looked good.
Potter made a small groan of embarrassment, but didn’t drop his gaze from Draco. “I meant it. It was all true. And you can hate me if you want, but I just feel something. I don’t know what exactly. But I just can’t get you out of my head. I don’t want to get you out of my head. I just want you.”
Harry had lost any willpower to walk away from Malfoy and he didn’t even try to pretend that that wasn’t exactly what he wanted.
This time it was Malfoy who laughed, his face lit up with a sort of manic glee. Harry felt something inside him crumple at the reaction, and he turned away to start finally getting dressed himself. After a moment, he felt Malfoy’s hand gently touch him on the back.
After taking a moment to compose himself, he cleared his throat and asked, “Are you honestly saying that you had nothing to do with this?”
Draco shook his head. “I don’t want to stop and let that mob get pictures of us together, bloody hell, Harry. We can talk about it when we get to your place.”
“You can’t be that thick, Malfoy. He told me himself that it was your idea. Wanted to humiliate me did you? Poke fun at my sexuality? Well congratulations, you’ve had your fun. I hope you got a bloody good laugh out of it.”
“I don’t care who you do or do not sleep with,” Harry hissed, wondering how on earth they’d got onto this topic. This was not the direction he’d meant for this interview to go in. “You’re the one who mentioned that... issue with the Finnish Minister’s son!”
“Honestly, no,” she replied with a shrug, “look, perhaps this isn’t something that I should say, but I’m not going to pretend to be someone else. I didn’t find a lot of the options for graduating Hogwarts students all that interesting. I didn’t know what to do, but I knew that I wanted to study more, and so I ended up studying education at Birmingham. And from there, I’ve done a few weird and wonderful things since.”
Draco hadn’t been lying - he really was ridiculously good at this. Harry only had a moment in which to feel a token of jealousy toward the other men that Draco had done this to, until he stopped caring about much at all other than his own pleasure.
“Potter!”
Draco chuckled. “Why, Harry Potter, I suppose that I am.”
“I hate my life,” Draco grumbled, throwing his file onto his desk and stripping off his tie. “Bunch of bloody annoying twits! They don’t listen to anything I say, do they?”
“Of course” Hermione answered primly.
“Fine. Enjoy your dinner, and I guess I’ll see you soon?”
Harry chuckled gently. “What, they didn’t report on my scandalous exploits in the local Belize papers?”
“True,” Harry sighed. “But I did enjoy this. A lot, actually. And I don’t know, I was sort of thinking...” he trailed off, unsure if he really wanted to voice his true thoughts.
“Well that’s good to hear. Dean came in about five times asking to know how you were getting on.”
Draco scowled. “Yes, and if I hadn’t, it would have been pretty easy to figure out given that over breakfast this morning, I read far too much detail about what you supposedly did to celebrate the beginning of the weekend.”
Malfoy seemed to struggle to avoid rolling his eyes, but composed himself before answering. “Yes,” he said, “prior to moving to Finland I had been working as the secretary for the head of the spell damage ward at Central Hospital in Belize City. Not the largest hospital in Central America, but we certainly had enough work to keep us all busy.”
“Be patient,” Harry grumbled, “if you want this done properly you have to give it some time.”
That made Harry laugh. “You never seemed to find that an issue at school, did you?”
“See, the thing is, well, it’s just that I was thinking, um, maybe if you thought it was a good idea too - -”
Potter gulped, a blush rising in his cheeks. His reaction certainly helped convince Draco that he’d come to the right place.
“I don’t. Sorry, I just don’t think I could work with you.”
“Tell me, Potter,” Draco said slowly, “did you mean it? A lot of those things you wrote about me... of a more, uh, intimate nature? Or was that just for the benefit of your readers?”
“I don’t think you’re an idiot, Harry,” Malfoy said gently, and the use of Harry’s first name had him snapping his eyes up to meet Malfoy’s head on. “I wouldn’t have come here if I thought you were. You’re the youngest Head Auror the Ministry has ever seen. I know some of what you accomplished as a field Auror, and I’d be lying if I said that I wasn’t impressed. So no, I don’t think you’re an idiot.”
Harry’s brain finally started firing up again, and he began stripping himself of his clothes, cursing the ridiculous Auror robes for being so fiddly. When at last he’d ridded himself of everything he’d been wearing, he stood facing Draco, hoping that he wouldn’t find fault with Harry’s appearance.
It was agonisingly slow at first as he gently pushed his finger inside Malfoy’s tight hole. Malfoy gasped slightly at the intrusion and so Harry waited, not wanting to rush things. He especially didn’t want Malfoy to change his mind and leave, because as surreal as this whole experience was, now that it was happening, Harry felt as if he’d never wanted anything so badly in his life.
Harry forced himself to nod finally, and gestured to the chair opposite his desk. Shit. This wasn’t good. He wasn’t at all prepared for this interview. Not in the least because he actually had no idea what Malfoy had been up to since high school, and he knew that Malfoy would pick up on the fact that Harry had been too lazy to read his résumé before the interview.
It was Harry’s turn to snort now, but he didn’t want to waste any more time. He brought his hands up to cup Malfoy’s face, and after what felt like an eternity, he finally brought their lips together.
Harry laughed loudly, not stopping to care that he might be coming across slightly manically.
Harry spun them around until the backs of Draco’s legs hit Harry’s desk. Taking the hint, he lifted himself slightly until he was sitting on the desk itself, and leant back enough to allow Harry to stand between his legs.
Finally, he decided he had to confront him. Perhaps it was Potter’s idea of a sick joke? Had he found out how attracted to him Draco had always been? It would seem odd though, as Draco had only briefly spoken to the man in years. No one saw much of Potter these days, not since he’d shut himself off from the world after the war.
“What can I do for you?” Potter asked once they’d made it to his living room. “Is everything okay? I haven’t broken the rules about meeting Muggles, or anything. Although why would you come to see someone about that, surely it would be law enforcement?”
Potter nodded. “Yeah. I know. Hermione is still one of my best friends, remember? Even if she’s been flat out with all this.”
“Apparently not. I must admit that I didn’t miss being followed and harassed while I was away. No one outside of this country has ever thought I was brewing an illegal potion when I made myself a cup of tea.”
“Oh fuck, Draco, you know I’m fucking willing. It’s been two sodding months since I got to put my hands on you and it’s driving me insane. I had to bloody wank at work the other day, did you know that? It’s a nightmare.”
Yet despite all their painful shared history, Potter somehow wanted to kiss Draco, and now they were standing in Potter’s living room on a cold Tuesday morning with their lips melding into one another, and Draco didn’t think he ever wanted to leave.
“It’s not what you think, Hermione,” Harry began, desperately hoping that she’d hear him out. “We’d finished the interview before any of this happened.”
“Ah, more, Potter, give me more, please,” Malfoy moaned.
Harry snorted. “I’m honoured you think so much of my stamina, really, but no, Draco. Look, this whole thing will only work if you trust me.”
While it was promising, Draco was still concerned. The magic they’d been performing was so minor that it shouldn’t have been obvious, and yet breaches had still occurred. It was bizarre, but he knew his team was closing in on a permanent solution, a new spell that they could use to protect themselves against prying Muggle eyes. He just needed everyone to hold on until it was in place.
“That perhaps it was part of his role in Human Resources to make sure that we weren’t shagging in the office again.”
“Pardon?”
She tutted and came into the room, settling herself in the chair opposite him and crossing her legs primly. “Not checking up as such,” she said, “but I did think I better see how you were doing before your interviews today. I know it’s not your favourite thing to do.”
