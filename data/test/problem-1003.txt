Hermione’s grin was almost feral. He always knew she had an inner cat or something, her claws might be small but they were sharp. She whirled around and left the classroom in a hurry...He regretted it already, but he knew that another part of his life was unfolding as it should.
Harry waited in the Room of Requirements for the rest of the Defense club to arrive.  He had invited Professor Snape and Professor Dumbledore for this one.  Harry described the room he would need to the headmaster when he arrived.  He implied that the task was important for saving a very important life.  From his original discussion with Hermione and the dates associated with his Augur powers, Sirius’ death was the greatest mistake that needed to be corrected.  Getting that part right was his main focus and goal.
“Are you ready for the next lesson?” Harry asked gently, trying to guide the conversation to a safe topic.
“I never said I did everything alone… Hermione has the best brains around, Ron’s strategy is perfect, and well, I improvise… we make a great team… Draco, well he is a balance that we never had…I think its a great addition” Harry sighed, they had such good times even in the darkest hours.  Harry noticed a look cross Severus’ face.
Harry turned to face her directly.  His face sobered as he spoke, “I am not Voldemort,” She flinched, “I do not command, I will not force people to do my bidding.  I offer advice, and sense.  I offer my friendship to those who need it, or want it.  So, it’s a simple question, with no strings or consequences.  Care to walk with me?” Harry asked again softening his tone, and gestured to the empty space beside him.
“Sir, I just wanted to say thank you.” Harry noted the raised eyebrow,”You have protected me more than once, and I owe you my life time over time. My mother would be so grateful. I hope we can start fresh, I am not my father, and I know him for what he was, and my mother for the wonderful girl she was and woman she became. Thank you.”
Harry laughed and reached out to take his hand. “It’s been dead a while now, it isn’t going to do anything, trust me.” His green eyes were comforting when Draco looked up at him.
Harry walked through the doors, and up to the sink.  He moved to the faucet he wanted.  And looked up at Draco.  He wanted to make sure he didn’t scare Draco, but Draco’s reaction was more than a welcome revelation.
“Petunia… is dinner ready, I am starving.” He said as he rounded the living room, only to fall with a loud thump as the stunning spell hit him in the chest.
Ron was lying on the floor, having passed out, no other students had stayed past the initial name-calling, just Pansy, Hermione, and Ron.  Hermione had concocted a scheme to see if her hunch about the two boys would pan out.
Ron of course was not thinking anything other than trying to erase the kiss from his mind… He didn’t like seeing anyone kiss.. unless it was Hermione and him, but they didn’t watch themselves… That line of thinking inspired other thoughts…
After the first several rounds were complete, and those that were stunned revived, he informed them that he would be paired with Professor Snape to demonstrate the Sonabona charm.
Harry woke up around 7:30. He at first thought he would be late for the meeting with Mrs. Malfoy, but was relieved after casting a glance at one of the bedside clocks that he had not overslept. Harry actually groomed himself. He knew presenting an unkempt appearance to a pureblood of high rank was considered rude, after all they had been forced to take etiquette classes as Aurors in their first year.
Harry growled when those hands gripped him, He brought Draco up by his hair and slammed his mouth onto Draco’s.  He took advantage of the gasp and let his tongue plunder the depths of Draco’s heat.  He took his time, biting and sucking on Draco’s tongue, drinking in the steady streams of moans coming from the blond.  He pulled away from Draco’s tempting mouth to whisper in Draco’s ear.
Draco shivered from his toes to his head, just those two words, flared his whole body, bringing a blush, he was sure imprinted on his face.
Harry slid in slowly and groaned when he felt Draco’s lips tighten around him. He pushed further in testing how far he could go before the blond would gag.  Harry’s cock got harder if that was possible when he heard the first gag. He pulled back and tightened his grip on Draco’s hair, he was getting lost in the darkness of the passion.  He plunged in hard, ramming his thick cock as far as last time and a bit further than the blond could take. Draco gagged and choked and Harry slid out slowly letting him capture air, then he slammed back in. Draco never broke eye contact even as tears welled up and slid down. Harry pulled out again and he let go of Draco’s head with one hand.  He let his thumb wipe a few tears from Draco’s cheek and he brought his thumb to his mouth to suck the salty tears off.
They walked around the dead monster, and Harry let go of his hand for just a moment to take something out of his cloak and place it just inside the mouth of the figurehead.  Harry cast a charm Draco had never heard, and then Harry moved back towards him.  He took a position behind Draco, and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist.  Draco held his breath as they took off into the chamber, flying to the top, then parallel with the walk way, and finally landing softly before the large door.  Harry whispered to it and it closed, Draco did not hear, his mind was filled with wonder at how Harry could see him through the mask of Malfoy.
Draco smiled back at him, grateful that Harry met him deed for deed.  He took Harry’s hand and shook it, no fire this time, just warmth and peace.  The peace was like a beautiful blanket settling over him, his heart slowed, his breathing relaxed.  Harry’s green eyes shined in welcome to him.
Once everyone had arrived, Harry formed them into groups.  Paring himself with Draco, Hermione with Ron, Ginny with Dean, and a few others he thought would work well together.  He wanted to pair them according to their strengths and weaknesses for this first session.
“It wasn’t the connections, Professor Potter.  I know he came to be convinced fully expecting to turn you down but was impressed so much that he left happy to participate.  They usually avoid these settings...You are quite the emissary.” She praised.
Draco looked up at the sound of wings, Hedwig was coming closer to him.  This was good, communication at least.  The beautiful bird extended her leg and he took the parchment.  He looked around but had nothing to offer her.  She only bowed her head a bit, and he pet her gently and let her take off once again.
At the two hour mark, Harry stood to wait.  The sight that appeared with a crack made him groan out in pleasure.  Draco smelled so delicious and looked ready to be fucked.  The silver eyes that met his own seemed to hold the same desire he had been feeling for hours now.  He waited. Needing to hear the words from that sinful mouth.
Draco was sorry he asked, the pain across Harry’s face was wrenching. He reached out and hugged his dark angel.
“With who?” Her voice shook considerably now… Harry walked over to her and let his hand fall to her shoulder.  She was falling into a pit… with no way out...
Harry went rigid. Severus Snape watched his student drain of every color known to man in seconds. Those green eyes turned up looked straight at him, and then rolled into the back of his head, and Harry was falling. Severus reacted quickly reaching for the boy before his head met stone.
“That’s all I can hope for.  By the way, you and Dean would make a cute couple.” Harry said, as he watched her blush from top to bottom.  He would miss the friendship they had, but he knew her heart belonged to Dean.  He was happy for her.
“Thank you both for your help.” Harry offered.  He turned towards the webbing as they departed, and delicately levitated it off the arch.  He then folded it into a small block and then shrunk it.  He banished the arch with a grim face.  He would succeed...
Harry relaxed, “You always were the one with the ability to make me feel better.”  She smiled back, “So… me and Ron?”
Teaching intrigued him. He enjoyed training new Aurors much better than actually pursuing dark wizards.  So in a way, Harry was in his element.
Draco complied immediately, his dick was leaking so bad that Harry had to reach out while walking to the other side of the bed. He dipped his fingers into Draco’s slit and pulled his fingers to his mouth. Draco moaned and arched into the air where Harry’s fingers were mere seconds ago. Draco let his head fall over the side of the bed as he watched Harry move around to him.
P.S.  Next chapter is my Favorite Chapter of well, the whole thing... but that's just me.  Sorry to leave you with a cliffy, but I'll post more in a few days.
Sirius was surprised by the ferocity in Severus’ voice. That voice filled him with forgotten hope. Severus’ mouth was making his thoughts hazy, and his body could not seem to stop throbbing with need. Each sentence brought Sirius closer to his sanity. He clung tighter to Severus and gasped into Severus’ mouth. He let himself go, giving himself up to Severus. He surrendered then, to Severus, to his need to believe his dark prince… He needed, and when Severus plunged into him, his body and soul felt right. There was no Sirius Black without Severus Snape. He let Severus expose his neck, his body already shaking with need. When Severus finally bit him, his world exploded behind his eyes, and he became centered. He came with the thought that he was all Severus wanted. Sirius was not even down from his bliss when Severus moved in him. Heat continued to flow as if his body had not already erupted. Each push drove him further reaching for more and he came again with Severus filling him. He could not move, and did not want to. Sirius let his soul be calmed by Severus’ words as he was carried to their bed.
“You are the best strategist I know, or will know Ron, so I need to run a few things by you and get your take on them… Care to help?” Harry asked.
“You are looking quite content, Draco… anything you wish to divulge?” Blaise pried, ever the one to search out news.
Draco looked at both of them, nodded, “I’m good.  I have decided the old rivalry is not worth continuing… I suggest you also let the past go and learn to be friends with Harry as well.  I have made my choice.”
“It’s alright mate, I won’t forget when it’s your turn.” Ron said, mischief in his eyes.  Hermione giggled.
Harry paced in front of the wall. When the door appeared he took Draco’s hand and opened it, hoping everything would be just right.
“Well, you did figure out she had an illegal animagus form...Use that and sweeten the deal by offering her an exclusive interview with yours truly” Harry said with a smile, “No pictures though… I want that outlined upfront.”
Draco’s eyes softened to a dove grey, “Not anymore, I would rather be happy right here than be as I always was without you.”  The sincerity of his tone was pure sweetness to Harry.
“Evidently while in Divination, I had a vision.” Hermione coughed, “Not a Voldemort vision, a real one. I lived over 20 years of my life in that vision. All of it happened to me in the span of what now looks to be just a class. I have confirmed some of it with the Headmaster, leaving me to believe that it is a real vision, but a rare one. The headmaster said he never heard of an ordinary wizard living through a vision, or of it lasting as long as mine, they only got specific events at specific times, or prophesies that needed to be deciphered. So, while I know the events of the next 20 years, I will only intervene when I need to, and only disclose information I feel will get us where we need to be. I won’t relive the pain and agony, nor will I let others sacrifice themselves for me. Unexpectedly, I have maintained my training, my knowledge, and my increased power and abilities.” Harry ended his little speech, looking at each of his friends who had wide eyes.
“Either time has thrown me back, or since I was in Professor Trelawney's class, I must have had a vision. Can you live a lifetime in a vision Professor?” Harry asked, looking genuinely curious.
Draco understood Harry was focused, this task was extremely important, though he did not really understand it.  There was an almost obsessiveness about this task for Harry.  Draco was just happy to be there in case of trouble, or just simply watch.
“I know…I know Severus... You couldn’t have Her… so you're settling for me... and..” Sirius started to back away as Severus advanced on him. Sirius never saw the wand, only found his thoughts and memories bared before Severus instantly.
Harry moved to stand behind Draco, wrapped both his arms around Draco’s waist, and then they moved as one, white smoke and a trail following them and Harry flew down the entrance and landed them safely at the bottom.
“Please what, Draco?” Harry whispered harshly. He did not let his grip go. The power that coursed through him made his cock twitch and harden even more.
Harry planned to show all this to Dumbledore this evening at his appointed meeting.  He was also looking forward to detentions with Professor Snape next week where he will teach the Potions Master how to create a wall occlusion.
“First, I’m sure you have done your own digging, and by now know the meaning of the vision, to mark me as the next Augur,” Harry insinuated, only to have Dumbledore give him a knowing smile, “Second, I need your help in devising a plan on how to keep the Malfoy family safe, but playable in the events that need to unfold.  Lastly, since the curriculum for defense this year for most students is severely lacking, Hermione and I have devised a way for me to teach only invited students how to properly defend themselves.” Harry reached into his robes and pulled out a few papers.
Professor Snape was waiting for Harry in the classroom that evening, and motioned for them to enter his chambers off to the left.   Harry followed him and waited just inside the inviting sitting room.  He felt apprehension slide up his spine… The Professor was not in a good mood, his muscles were strained and his jaw clenched.
Harry shook his head, “How is he? Who did it and why?”  Something inside him twisted at the thought of Draco in pain, Harry ignored it.
Harry was happy that his maturity was influencing his friends to rise above teenage issues.  It was a hard adjusting back into an environment where you are expected to be led, to listen, to follow the rules instead of making them and being in charge.  But he had always been in charge in his life, people had always looked up to him, he was born to lead, and now he knew how.
Severus held his face, not flinching only breathing. This boy, had gone beyond. “We will see Mr. Potter, and you're welcome.”
There was a bet.  And for the first time ever… Draco Malfoy lost.  The prince of Slytherin himself had lost a bet.  Now he had to pay up.  This would not be easy or fun.  The rules stated he had to kiss his worst enemy.  How in the world could he manage that?
Harry had forgotten this place, and as he climbed the stairs, parts of the visions started flashing around him.
“I know how you were raised, I know about your home life. Your father, your mother, and how you lived alone all your life until your death.  I know when you loved, you held on with all you had. I know when you pledged your loyalty, there was nothing you wouldn’t do, or nowhere would you not go.  You were neglected, used, and are still allowing yourself to be used by others.  I know you.  I know you think you were not made for relationships, but your whole life proves otherwise.  You hold your part of the relationship, even after the other party has died or deserted you.  I know you better than you know you. You need to allow yourself to find happiness Sir, of all people, you deserve to find it.  My mum would have wanted you happy.”  Harry stated, his voice unwavering, his eyes locked, pinning Severus with that gaze he first met in the infirmary not long ago.
Harry swung his legs over and walked up to her. “You madam, will suffer much if you don’t back off. You may not believe me or in the ‘sight’, but I know about you. Your drive to rid the world of half-bloods is greater than Voldemort’s, and your loathing for children is evident by your willingness to employ a blood quill for detentions, not to mention you would not hesitate to use unforgivables on students to further the ministry’s ideals. It won’t last, madam… And you will not break me.” Harry dropped his wand into his pocket, backed up two steps, performed some complicated hand gestures that were graceful yet intimidating, and she found her arms bound tightly together, her mouth sealed shut, and her feet glued to the ground. Her eyes stared hard daggers at Harry, promising retribution. “I will release you, but just know this. My vision of the future, made me live for over twenty years from this day, I was trained by the best Aurors the Ministry had after the war, and new spells and curses were developed. Do not mess with me or mine. The ministry will survive, and remain in power, and unless you change your tune, you will not be with it. Do I make myself clear Madam?” Harry gazed at her, locking on and not letting her look away, she nodded barely. “Good, we can work together, if you behave.” Harry offered, swirling one hand in another complicated pattern, and she found herself unlocked from her bindings.
Draco felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around, staring at two of his friends.  Blaise Zabini and Gregory Goyle.
Harry moved forward, before his courage faded, and wrapped his arms around the Potion’s master and hugged him.  A burden he did not understand fell away in that moment.  It took a longer while, before Snape reciprocated, with a quick squeeze and a light pat on the back.  That would do for now.  Snape was not one to understand affection, nor how to reciprocate it. But he would learn, learn for Lily, and learn for Harry.
When Harry came in, he was accosted by Hermione. She took his arm and dragged him to the nearest couch. She cast the Impervious privacy charm this time, having learned from Harry just how to perform the complicated wand maneuver.
A sharp crack on one arse cheek was Harry's response to silence.  Draco moaned loudly..."I need you to know..."
Draco Malfoy moved now, with purpose.  Since that day in the bathroom where the life within him drained, he had touched feelings like never before.  Down the dark halls, he moved silently.  He found his targets, Crabbe and Goyle, both had been included in plans that would devastate Harry and his cause.  He had to lead them into a place where they could be dealt with and away from the main fight.  Their encounter with Potter and friends in the Room of Requirements did not go as planned, and Draco found himself being engulfed in flames.  The feeling of life and death surrounded him.  He could taste death, and in that taste, he relished his own life and looked up to meet his salvation once again.  Everything inside him was alive when Harry touched him.   He was undone and broken before this man in everything he had done just to reveal himself to this one person.  His vulnerabilities, his strengths and his fears were all known to Harry.  Once this was all said and done, he would go back to the grey that was his life, but for now, in this moment, he would live and feel with Harry.  They moved as one on the broom out of the way of flames and falling piles of trash, books and larger objects.
“What I am going to say and ask may make little sense, but you will please just listen first. I know your rotation for watching the prophecy is soon Mr. Weasley.” Both men looked surprised, “I have something you will need and instructions. First,” He pulled out a small box. “There will be an attack on you while you are there. It is important Headmaster that you do not interfere with what will come,” Harry said then faced Arthur again, “Your attacker will be Voldemort’s familiar, a snake called Nagini. In that box is a bezor, take it before you start your shift, as a precaution against the venom.” Harry moved to a vial to hand to Arthur, “It is imperative you capture or stun the snake, if you immobilize it, pour this on it. It is a special potion, this must be done first. Keep the snake immobile and under the potion for at least 30 seconds,” Harry then reached for the package he pulled from his trunk, “Once the potion has sunk into the snake, you can kill it with this,” He opened the package to show a silver blade, with runes on the side, and a dark stain along the edge. “Don’t cut yourself with this, it is a Goblin made blade, on which I have added Basilisk Venom, Use this to kill the snake, and only this. Can you follow those instructions?” Harry asked.
The glow that came around him was soft, and enticing.  She leaned forward as if basking in the glow was the only thing she wanted.
Harry stood up, many eyes from the room shifted to their encounter.  Harry noted the defensive tension that Professor Snape exhibited out of the corner of his eye.  His Auror training still extended to his attention to details.  Professor Dumbledore, looked on with curiosity, and a twinkle, Harry had missed that twinkle.  Professor McGonagall made to get up, but Dumbledore's hand quietly laid on her arm to stop her.
It was empty, and filled with dust, which Draco cleared away quietly with his wand.  He helped Harry to sit in a chair in and waited.  He wondered if he should touch Harry, comfort him in some way.  The gesture rang awkward for him, so he waited.
Harry reluctantly, and slowly stood, following the curve of Draco’s back with his tongue, and finally nipping at the junction of neck and shoulder.  He turned Draco around in his arms and kissed him again, this time his own flavor and Draco’s mingled on their tongues.  He scooted them over to the side of the bed and eased himself onto it, his back to the headboard. Draco straddled him, and they just gazed at each other for a moment.
Draco was nervous as he stripped and folded his clothes.  He put everything on the chair in the corner and knelt at the foot of the bed.  So much anxiety was running through his veins.  He needed this, everything about this he needed.  He could see how much control he had tried to hold onto in his life.  So much so, that he had lost so much of himself to the life he lived.  His words and actions were driven by his life and his past.  Draco had felt so much in the past few hours.  Harry had been a driving force in his life for so long, negative for the most part, but if he had only opened his eyes sooner, he could have missed so much pain.  He could see the beauty in this surrender, he just wished it would last beyond this one night. He fought for so long and could see that he had caused his own pain and needed Harry to take it away.
“I never had this with her or anyone. Vision or not..” Harry breathed the words over Draco’s ear as he held his husband close. He felt the blond melt in his hold. So he licked the shell of Draco’s ear and smiled when he felt the shiver.
The following week, Harry worked effortlessly on his classes and then spent the rest of his free time in the room Dumbledore had let him use.  His first day he spent constructing the exact dimensions of the arch from memory out of stones he had brought in.  The actual dimensions were critical for the spiders when they arrived.  He needed their webbing to cover the whole arch.
Harry smiled, he had the perfect being…Someone who would never give up, never give in and was unshakable and loyal to a fault. “Dobby.”
Most of those replied affirmative, but he did have to repeat himself once on the notes portion of his instruction to one other student who did not understand.
The classroom was as dark as ever.  The smell of multiple potions ingredients permeated the stale air.  The houses of course were split on each side of the room as usual, with Harry near the front, sitting next to Hermione.  Harry saw Draco enter and go straight for the front of the class, Hermione turned around to greet him.
Harry stood up, needing to break the contact just so he could breathe.  Draco stood as well and they walked silently out of the Great Hall.
“All supporters will be free in January. I have to have everything in place to end this war 2 years earlier, I plan to have us all free by June. Mr. Malfoy will be critical to that plan. Please confer with your family. But I will warn you, if you choose to not help, I will reject the power offered to me as the Augur Saeculum, and cause everything to be as it was in my vision. I am willing to give up this power and knowledge, to ensure what needs to be done is done. And on that you have my oath as a Wizard on my magic.” Harry state, a golden string of glowing magic, encircled him, and then seeped into his heart.
Draco looked down and then back at Harry, “Yes” his voice was confident.  He felt in his bones the trust he had.
“Your wisdom and instructions in these matters, Harry, will not go unheeded.” Albus placated.  It was difficult looking at the young man before him, and yet hearing such wizened and authoritative words from him.  The headmaster was definitely not used to taking direction.   In all his years, he had never expected an Augur to be so young.  But an Augur was not to be trifled with.  They had tasks to complete, and there was no standing in their way. Any grown wizard understood that, and would be mental to try.  He smiled, this was turning out better than he had hoped.  Harry pulled him out of his musings.
“You are so sexy like this.  No pride or arrogance to mar your eyes.” Harry whispered to Draco.  Waiting to see the blond’s response.
“Nothing… I just came to say goodbye… I can’t be your plaything anymore.” Grey eyes so full of pain shifted around the room. Sirius’ hands were shaking as he took another drink from the whiskey bottle in his hand. Sirius’ posture was sloppy, his eyes darted around the room avoiding Severus.
Harry walked into the Great Hall and sat down next to Ron and Hermione.  They stopped talking as soon as he sat down, and he notice a blush creep up Hermione’s cheek.
Draco had entered his dorms, he was still floating it seemed.  There was no way he could forget that kiss.  Everything inside him responded to Harry.  He was so sure that Harry had felt nothing, but understanding dawned with that kiss.  Harry was just focused, on one thing, his task.  Draco would make sure not to distract him… too much.   Draco wanted more, and he usually got what he wanted.
Harry bolted out of the tower, he had to know. He ran fast, but his eyes were taking in everything, the walls, the portraits, the staircases, Hogwarts. He had one path, one direction, one hope and one fear. His eyes were filling now, tears at being back inside his head, surely that is what was happening. A hallucination maybe, he had to be dreaming. For a moment, his focus was lost, and he collided with something Large, warm, and billowy. A voice from the beyond graced his ears.
Her heart broke then… everything was true... her world was inside out and upside down… Her vision was already starting to go hazy from the mist gathering in her eyes...
“Hence you’re befriending him in the Great Hall yesterday and the mending of your rivalry?” The headmaster asked.
“Truce, Harry. Thank you, for sharing. Though how did you build a wall like that in your mind? Even with my extensive Occlumency skills I have only managed some barriers.” Severus pointed out.
Severus tried to comprehend what Harry was talking about.  The confusion must have been evident.  “You understand how a patronus charm works, Professor, it feeds off a happy or good memory, correct?” Harry inquired, when Severus inclined his head he continued. “The occlusion wall, is similar, the combination of occlumency and the entwined shield charms necessitates a dependency on balance between light and dark.  The light side of the balance comes from the combination of the happy memories that provide the needed strength to the shields.  The darker memories are a weakness for the charms, but a strength for the fabric.  Occlusion takes willpower, and more willpower is taken from the will and strength in the dark memories, but the shields are powered by the goodness and love reaching out to protect ourselves. In order for the two to work together, they need to have similar strengths. Make sense?  This is why you are good at Occlumency by itself.  You have the willpower to hold the memories from another’s detection.”
“No worries, Mr. Potter, you were not invading.  I got the hang of it, so next time we can work on the bad ones, and we’ll work from there. I do appreciate the training, it is much harder than Occluding alone, but from what I can tell so far, more effective.” Severus stated.
Harry’s eyes widened and then a wicked smile came to his mouth as Narcissa’s words penetrated his mind.    He wrote a reply to Mrs. Malfoy and tried to make it as readable as possible. He sent it off before he even opened the one he knew belonged to Draco.  No matter what it would say, he already knew his reply.  He scrawled it onto a small piece of parchment and sealed it with his wand.  The impression his magic left on the letter made the seal look like a kiss.  That would either shut the blond up or enflame him even more.  Harry laughed and then read through Draco’s letter.  It was more polite, but not what he wanted out of the arrogant prat.
The change in Draco’s voice was not something Harry was prepared for. Always used to the sneering, the cocky drawl, Draco’s voice always seemed to rub him the wrong way.
“I sent him on an errand to help Hermione.  I needed him out of the way for today.” Harry replied with a brilliant smile.
“You're not going to leave me hanging to go be with the Weasleys are you?” Sirius sounded concerned.
Once they were gone, Harry, Draco, Hermione and Ron, began to eat lunch.  Harry always loved a meal at Hogwarts.  It was always full of just about anything you could want.  Sandwiches of all kinds, hot meat, gravy, potatoes, and of course Treacle Tart. Harry never passed up Treacle Tart.
“I won’t direct anything at you, Madam Bones.  I want you to see what I am, then I will answer your questions.” Harry said.  He placed his wand on the table.  She narrowed her eyes.
Harry wanted to include Draco for this, but there was something that made him hold back the information for this task.  Harry ached having to focus on something other than Draco.  The defense club sessions were his only consolation.  There he could let his eyes drink in Draco, with the thought of their time together in the back of his mind.
“Malfoy?” Harry asked loud enough for the person to stop. Sure enough his school nemesis stopped and turned around, sneering as he did so.
Harry’s quick movements had them standing off to the corner, Draco’s back against one of the shelves, and a disillusionment charm cast.  And then Harry was there, lips crashing and claiming.  Draco was lost once again, the fire, the heat, the pleasure of just one kiss.  Harry had never tasted another like Draco, the intensity was mind-blowing.  Harry reached down and picked Draco up by the waist, and those leg wrapped around him bringing their pelvises into union.  Each gasped at the contact.  Harry drank in those gasps, and let his mouth move to take flesh from Draco’s pale neck into his heated mouth.  Silk and cream, that was Draco Malfoy, sweet and salty, everything.   Harry had to stop, he pushed himself, this thing with Draco was powerful, and neither was ready for the explosive passion that was waiting to crash over them.
Sirius was shaking, his heart shattered, his mind felt raped. He no longer cared, everything was laid bare now. He knew that somehow he had ruined everything again… only this time he had tasted glory and let it go. He drank the potion… He knew it was a sober up potion when Severus gave it to him. He just did not want the extra boost the alcohol gave him to go away. He already knew what he would feel like without it. His mind preyed upon him. He was worthless, juvenile, and definitely not Lily. How could he have ever compared? Lily was special, he was nothing. She was beautiful, compassionate, and perfect. He was broken, used and as imperfect as a person could become. He was so lost in berating himself that he did not hear Severus move closer, did not feel the hands on his shirt. The next thing he knew was that there was a searing heat mingling with a scent of bergamot and mint. His mouth was taken with a force so brutal his head hit the wall and he felt pain blossoming behind his head. His eyes flew to the fury in onyx temptation.
They both broke out into a fit of laughter.  What’s the point of anything if you can’t laugh about it.
“There is only one way to find out.  I asked Professor Snape here to administer Veritaserum which will force him to answer any question truthfully… we can modify his memory afterward if you like.” Harry explained.
“Ginny what?” Harry asked considerably taken aback by the question. His mind was still reeling from what had just happened.
Later that evening, Harry made his way to the headmaster’s office.  He was still unsure of the path for the Malfoy family, but he knew that with the headmaster’s help, they could come up with a plan.
“I was wondering if you would spend the day with me.  I have something important to do, and after, I would like to just spend some time with just you.” Harry said, trying not to trip over his own tongue.  Why was he so nervous?  He hadn’t felt this flustered since… never.
Harry just smiled up at the Professor, after yesterday’s reliving of the vision events, he was just glad to be near the old man.  Harry paused, “Can I hug you?” he asked giving in to his basic need.  Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled as he stood up and came around the desk.  There was always something about this young man that made him care more than any other student.  Harry embraced the man, another wave of relief swept over him, it was like the present was washing away the pain of the past, or vision in his case.
“Please…” Draco stalled eyeing Harry’s trousers, he licked his lips and then looked up into shining emerald eyes, “I need you.”
Her face went almost grey, “You will lose your memory of all the events of your vision, if you choose to let it go. And so will anyone you have talked to about the vision.”
Severus had tried to make his voice toneless not to scare the brat, but Harry seemed to flinch and stiffen anyway, and his eyes did open...very wide.
Harry’s started to hear silent whispers in his ear, and the tingle down his back told him, Mr. Malfoy had pressed the coin.
At first it seemed only a wisp, then more of the magical wisp flowed out of Draco’s wand and formed a rather large lion.  Harry was stunned, he had always envisioned a snake or dragon or some such nonsense. Several others in the room also seemed a bit shocked by the slight murmuring going on. Obviously many had still pegged Draco as a Death Eater.  Harry was glad, this just proved to the whole room, Draco was on their side to stay.
The holidays were approaching, and he knew that his plan would make things more difficult for the Malfoy’s but maybe there could be an upside to all this, at least in the end there would be.  He was sure that he wanted to spend the Holidays with Sirius, and if their plan for the Malfoy’s succeeded, he would offer them a chance to join them, if they were willing.
Harry met with the Headmaster and Severus on Thursday evening.  Severus and Albus stared up at the large archway and the intricate netting that covered the massive opening from top to bottom.  The webbing glistened like a multifaceted diamond.  Harry walked out from behind the huge arch and looked up at them and smiled.
“So when did you want to pay a visit to the Dursleys?” Severus asked, his face pinched with disgust.
“This first week we will learn the patronus charm, how to cast it, learn the appropriate applications it can be used for, and how to direct it for other purposes than protection.” Harry explained.
The handwriting was atrocious to say the least.  But at least he could read it.  Draco smiled at himself.  Well so far they were not attacking each other so that was good.  The new start could be just what they needed, though friends would be a problem on both sides.
He opened the pink cheeks and whispered a quick spell... And pushed his thick length into the tight hole.
A/N~  Part of the storm has now come...This chapter has held me captive.  Years and Years after writing this and many stories and books later... This is still and always will be my favorite chapter I ever wrote.  I had Fall Out Boys "My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark" on repeat! AND there is a bit of flashback timing in the beginning... so yeah don't get to confused.
Harry reached for Draco and pulled the man down to his side.  He placed a soft kiss on those pink ones and whispered in Draco’s ear.
Harry let her go and continued on his way to his room.  He was making a statement, drawing a line and he might involve more of the student body than he had anticipated.  He really had to be careful. He didn't want the Dark Lord to take it out on children. Pansy herself had no bad or good outcome from the war, her involvement or noninvolvement should have no effect on the balance, or so he thought, but he just wasn’t sure.  This was a chess game and all the pieces were in play.  Ron might be the best person to talk to on this one.  Unfortunately the key individual in question, was snoring rather loudly.
“Mrs. Malfoy, thank you for taking the time to see me. May I assume I can speak freely, without interruption so that you may understand why I have asked you to meet with me?” Harry asked, looking straight into her ice blue eyes.
They sipped their drinks, talked about various subjects. Harry asked Draco about his hopes for the future, his talents, his likes and dislikes, and they talked for what felt like an eternity.  They ate the food that the room provided, and danced a few more times.  Blissful was the only thing that could describe how Harry was feeling by the time they left.  Harry had to prepare for their next defense class, and Draco left to find his friends.  Harry was on cloud nine, when he got back to his room and flopped on his bed, a lopsided grin plastered on his face.
“Evidently your friendship did not sit well with one of his housemates.  He is mending, and that housemate has been reprimanded.  Professor Snape has it in hand.  Just be on guard.” Dumbledore warned.  Harry nodded.
Theodore understood the implications, his father will kill him for this, but Draco would not change sides without reason.  And the reason may be the key to his own survival.  He walked over to stand beside Pansy, “Good choice, Harry is more powerful than I estimated.” Pansy whispered.  Theodore understood her position, and shared it.
Harry penned a quick note and sent for Hedwig.  She flew to his window after a few minutes.  He took the time, as he had never really done, to pet her, talk to her and look at her.  She got a bit anxious for her task and nipped him a bit affectionately.  He tied the note to her leg and she took off.
This was one of those tangible moments.  Harry usually could not afford to let those happen when he had important plans to take care of, but this time, this moment he took for himself.
His wand hand cast a quick spell and he and the mutt just where he wanted him… panting, needy and naked. Their bodies were pressed together, Sirius’ legs were around Severus’ waist. He held on maneuvering Sirius to just the right angle and plunged in deep as he dropped Sirius down on his length. Sirius cried out his name. Severus stilled them both, and reached with one hand to tangle in dark hair. He pulled and Sirius did not fight him, exposing his neck.
“Mrs. Figg will let you stay with her I’m sure.  The papers need other formal signatures to release your vault.  I can call Dudley and let him know. What do you want Uncle Vernon to know?” Harry spoke softly.  She pulled away and sat down looking at her husband.  A coldness crept into her heart at the sight of the man, whale…He really was a whale… and Dudley would follow... She would do something… Her heart bore a viciousness that only a mother could feel as the faults against her family by this man were now laid at her feet.
“Why me?” She asked, even as understanding started to flow over her… He had chosen her and knew of her ambitions.  This revelation was an endorsement.
Harry pushed Draco up against the door they had just entered.  Draco felt the adrenaline rush through his body and the blood rush south.
“I know that.  Sometimes the other order members try to remind me I am no longer a teenager.” Sirius responded with an answering smile of his own.  Harry laughed.
Sirius let the words float over him, branding his heart, capturing his soul. He gasped again and again with the silk of that voice manipulating his body’s responses.
Harry almost lost his composure and his will power when he entered the room.  The sight was stunning.  Draco’s lean, pale form kneeling on the bed. His soft white-blond hair hanging just past his shoulders, the muscles in his chest were taut from the position of his hands.  The red scars that crisscrossed his chest, sent an electric shock straight to Harry’s groin.  Those were his marks, He had marked Draco. Draco’s cock looked painfully erect, bright red tip, glistening with drops of precum.  Harry licked his lips as he watched a drop fall to the bed.  So many commands raced through his mind in that one moment. He let his eyes lock with silver.
“Can you plant a memory of me finding out and storming out? that’s what I wish I could do.” She said with a trembling voice.
Harry waited for the outrage, the emotion, an outbreak or something.  What he didn’t expect was the slow smile on Narcissa’s face, a shine in the eyes of Lucius as he looked down at his son.  Evidently being linked with an Augur was respected, even if it was to Harry Potter.  Draco looked at his parents and nodded, then back at Harry locking gazes.
Once inside Severus’ personal lab, Harry brought out the box and unshrunk it and ended the disillusionment charm. Severus backed up a few steps.
Professor Dumbledore read over the notes and schedule… “Harry, this is actually the best curriculum I have seen these many years for this study. You have my blessing to proceed, and I would like to watch a time or two if you may… Some of these are new to me.  I shall have the castle amenable to your style so if any help is needed, I shall be notified immediately.  Very well thought out indeed.” He praised.
He pulled a vial from his cloak and pulled the stopper and used his wand to imbue the box with the potion.  Once the box glowed and the potion took hold, Harry noted the slight look of relief that Mrs. Malfoy exhibited.  He moved the box to his own cloak pocket.  In three weeks’ time another would be destroyed, and that would put two destroyed, two hidden.  That left the ring and the locket.  He had to wait for Mundungus to pilfer, that would ensure that Kreacher was won over. He would have to talk to Sirius to allow the home to look ‘available’ for plundering.
Harry tried to put his mind back in order, turned back towards Draco, and planted a quick perfunctory kiss on those pink lips.
Draco stood, and the others nodded, and then they exited the Great Hall… More riotous noise could be heard as they left.
Arthur looked very serious and looked to Albus who only nodded, his face grim. “Yes, I will make sure to follow the instructions perfectly.”
“My token to show our sincerity. We,” She looked back at Lucius who nodded, “Agree to your terms and will work however you need us to achieve your goal. But,” She glanced at Draco, then back to Harry, pinning him with her stare, “You hurt him…”
Severus groaned… Damn the Dark Lord for his plots and Damn Harry for saving people… He moved slowly to get out of the bed. Then leaned over and pushed on Sirius’ shoulder…
“I noticed you were nervous the last couple days, I figured I could try to help… Maybe another kiss...” Draco’s icy eyes were pools of mercury calling to Harry.
“Please place your books onto the table in front of you so I can have them collected.” He instructed.  The students began to murmur as they reached for their texts.
Sirius could only comply, his was so scared to find revulsion, anger and disinterest. But all he saw was fear and anger and something else he could not put his finger on. The press of Severus’ body against his own made him heated and he started to breathe more raggedly. He did not want to be aroused when his heart hurt so bad. He cursed his body. He gasped uncontrollably when Severus nipped his neck. His body shook in response and his groin strained painfully at his trousers.
“So do you want to meet when you are done with your important task?” Draco asked quietly when they were in the atrium just outside the doors the Great Hall.
Draco watched in a haze as Harry moved above him, his throat raw from so much fucking.  Yet when Harry bent down to taste him, he couldn’t even scream, only whimper.  He was already strung tight as a bow and then to watch Harry’s eyes as they devoured him, was extraordinary.  He was pulled from his haze as blinding pain sliced through him, and the ecstasy that came with the breach was otherworldly. He almost felt like his body was floating.
“There has been little resistance from the headmaster, Malfoy’s and even Professor Snape to my vision.  I would have expected more outburst or hesitation, at least from the Malfoy’s or Professor Snape or more especially Ron.” Harry confessed to Hermione.
Severus was not prepared for the hand to come out of the fire and grabbed his collar.  Before he knew what was what, he was falling on top of Black back in Grimmauld place, and found a pair of lips searching for his own.  They found his quickly and all reason and logic on how this couldn’t work was swiped out of his head.  Snape was locked to this man beneath him, strong arms holding him down while the mutt plundered his mouth, and he relaxed and gave in to the explosive pleasure washing over him.
“Well it’s Hermione...she’s my best friend...well besides you too of course,” Harry nodded with a smile and Ron continued, “I like her like that and all, but I don’t want to mess up all of our friendships...will it be too weird if I say yes?”
Draco shivered almost violently under the onslaught of sensation as his mouth was taken and his senses exploded around him. He fell into those dark green eyes and melted. He could only nod to Harry’s words. His body needed this man’s possession this night.  Whatever came after, he would willingly surrender to.  He had one last truth to impart.
Narcissa gasped, she never thought her son would contact Harry Potter.  After the war, the only contact their family had with him had been at the trials where Harry spoke for her and Draco.  She reached out her hand.
For Harry to be sent to him, that was an unexpected surprise.  Harry must really have done something great for the Malfoy’s for his mother to have given such a gift.  Though at this time, his mother may not know to whom Harry was sent.  He wasn’t sure if he should be the one to tell her.  In light of recent events, He probably should, so his father would know to meddle no more into Harry’s affairs.  If, as the coin suggests, they are the other half to each other, then his family will have to re-think their loyalties.   Draco was happy with that thought.  The Dark Lord had never appealed to him.  It really was his father’s teenage inclinations that got his family caught up in this mess.  His father could be brutal, no doubt, but not intentionally for no reason.  The whole incident with the diary had gone extremely wrong.  His father filled him in after the Chamber incident and Harry defeating the Basilisk. The School usually was very good at detecting Dark Artifacts that he was sure someone would catch it before any damage would be caused.   He had wanted that thing out of the house as it was starting to cause problems with his mother and father.  He had actually meant to slip it to Harry, but Ginny was closer.  He had remorse, but he would not allow the incident to be publicized and ruin the family name.
“I’ll teach you. In my vision, we Aurors worked with the Department of Mysteries to go beyond Occlumency, and work with mind shields. We paired the practice, until we found that our Occlusion could be manipulated into walls.” Harry offered.
Harry grinned wildly, “Only that he needed to stop living like a teenager and grow up.  Treat you with the respect you deserve.”
Draco’s eyes were on Harry, curiosity, and apprehension.  He couldn’t look away, Harry’s green eyes held him.
Severus nodded, and they both went and sat on the sitting room floor for an hour meditating, occluding and shield casting for the rest of the session.   Harry guided Snape on to building the wall foundation, it had to be strong neutral memories the light colored bricks that were numerous in Harry’s wall.  Bland to the touch, not worthy of notice.  A few more sessions, and Snape would have his wall built.
Harry was more than happy to sign the document. Harry put his wand, into his robes, and signed the document. After he finished signing, the document activated the portkey charm and Harry was whisked away.
Draco took an hour to scrub and wash his entire body inside and out.  Then took the rest of the time to try and find the right outfit.  The entire time, potions and his mother were no longer floating in his mind.  Green eyes looking down on him while he was worshiping a different part of Harry flowed effortlessly into his mind.  He was too far gone to remember his anger or his pride at this point. Draco had been sporting a hard-on since reading the first sentence of Harry’s reply.
The door opened from the ante chamber, and Professor Dumbledore entered.  He looked alert yet cautious.  The sparkle in his eye only returned when they fell on Harry.
Severus Snape was in awe, he had been enveloped in blinding pink light and a loud persistent sound was starting to blossom inside his head forcing his focus to diminish, and as quickly as it started it stopped.  No one had ever successfully blocked his Cruciatus before...No one.
“I have discussed it with her, I will refuse the power of the Augur, and let things play out as they had in my vision.  That is the only course I can see.” Harry said.
“Good Afternoon, Draco.  I trust your weekend is going well.” He spoke just a hint louder than normal, so not to be mistaken.
“I lived a hollow life for her memory… now I breathe each breath for you.” Severus captured a gasp he earned by lifting the mutt and pressing his erection hard into Sirius. He took his time, letting his tongue dance with his lovers. Letting their breath mingle until they were breathing as one body.
Well that was reasonable enough. If anything he was good at getting out of bad situations. He just had to plan what to say. If the meeting with Arthur goes as planned, one horcrux will be taken care of and without the knowledge of Voldemort understanding what is happening. The Delayed repercussion potion will come in handy. He had to start brewing the potion needed today… that way by Friday it will be ready. So much for relaxation.
“You just have all the luck don’t you pup?” Sirius said quietly. “I don’t know much about the Augur thing, I’ll do some looking here since we have a vast library.  Anything from the vision you want to talk about?  Are you allowed to?”
Severus did not let it be quick.  He returned the embrace properly and ruffled Harry’s hair, even though Harry was taller than him now.  He found that his ability to return affection and care was not lost.  He walked into his rooms to find his wayward lover and ensure there was no more whiskey and no more doubts.
“That’s for me to know and you to find out. Keep it up, or if you choose the better path, stop the house rivalry, drop the loyalty to the loser who calls himself the Dark Lord, by aligning yourself with all those against him.” Harry said, his offer hung in the air like a ghost wishing for substance.
Draco sat down next to Harry, whose stomach was leaping at the closeness.  He could already smell Draco and his freshly washed hair that Harry’s fingers itched to touch.
“Did he see the snake killed?” Harry asked, knowing that if he did, there was a possibility that the Dark Lord could see into Mr. Malfoy’s memories.
“Whatever I do, the Death Eaters may undo as far as obscuring.  Finding a way to put the muggles asleep in their own homes could prevent exposure.  I am not sure that is a job for the Order… That may be another path altogether. I will wait until the meeting to decide.” Harry said.
Harry sobered a bit, “What is uncomfortable Ron, is watching my two best friends, who are clearly made for each other by the way, ignore their feelings for each other and live with the pain of being apart.  I want you both to be happy, and I know you will both make each other happy.”
Harry thrust one more time only to collapse down on to the bed next to his lover... For once... he was broken, he was alive and he was Harry.
Harry’s mind was black, nothingness. And then he saw it, a wall. It loomed high over him. The majority of bricks were light, and medium shades, but the clumps of dark bricks caught his eye. He had never encountered a wall in someone’s mind. Then he saw a small figure approaching him. Harry.
His voice called out each power and the sound vibrated against the walls.  Each time he traced a rune he switched arms to let each one flow to the tip of his fingers.
They met in a clash of fury, arms gripping and pushing, legs sliding together in the water of a hot bath... and lips... they were branding each other.  Hot, melting and hungry.  Thier mouths fused and undulated, heated breaths fueling the passion.  Each intake of breath took the intensity higher, Draco's scent causing an almost dizzying high for Harry.  Draco was lost in the fire, his blood sang, his mind was blissful and his body completely alive.  There was no slowness between them, only rough touches.  They scrubbed hard as they washed death from their bodies, only to clash over and over again with passion.  Harry pushed hard against Draco's back, bending him over the edge of the massive tub.  He let his fingernails lightly score the pale flesh of Draco's back.  The gasps and needy moans were his reward.
Sirius’ body was assaulted with overwhelming sensory stimulation. Severus’ scent was dizzying. When he was lifted and pressed harder into the wall, he wrapped his legs around the darker man and gasped again when He felt Severus’ need for him. His heart bore the brunt of the assault with every word, it beat faster.
Harry stood still, just watching the blond in front of him. Processing what was just said was a bit difficult to say the least. Narcissa had given him a gift. Unknowingly it was her son. Harry was not sure what to make of this idea.
Finally, he called the rain to fall from the clouds and the fire was extinguished… He raised both hands and place them together, then gently rolled his hands back to back and pushed softly away, as if pushing the clouds apart… and all the elements fell away on the breeze that was gone soon after.
The last Friday in November found Harry waiting inside the headmaster’s office.  He knew better than to touch the Licorice snaps, and refused the curiosity of the pensive.  He already knew what he needed to know, so prying was unnecessary.  He perused the books that lined the wall of shelves.  So many good references here, he could get lost and Hermione would probably drop another baby at the sight.  Harry smiled at that thought… she loved being a mother and was really a good one.
“I’m amenable.” was all he said.  Harry saw there was much more left unspoken, but he wasn’t sure who would hear that in private, Mrs. Malfoy or himself.
Those coins were treasured objects.  Most often they were given to lovers for safe haven, and in most cases, save for one, kept within the family after the marriage.  That was actually how Narcissa came into possession of one.  Lucius had given her one after he fell in love with her after their school years.  It was for emergencies, but Narcissa had been curious.  During a long absence, which Lucius had to go and do business for his father in Albania, She used the coin.  And it dropped her right in the middle of Lucius’ bed chamber at one of the Albanian Malfoy properties.  He was upset, but they were both ecstatic to see they were meant to be together.  That event led to the proposal, eventual marriage and well everything else.
Draco nodded, he had not danced since the Yule Ball last year.  He hoped his feet worked.  Harry took his hand and swept him up into a lovely waltz.  Draco felt like he was floating as they whirled around the dance floor.  Harry’s hold was firm but not too tight, and the dance was slow enough that they could just look at each other. Draco was content, to dance, and breathe in Harry.  The scent of sandalwood and apples enveloped him in comfort.
That evening he had felt the Voldemort visions try to enter his mind, it was merely an irritating knock now and he chose to reject their entry for now, later they may be useful, but tonight it was merely a Ministry vision. It was late, and now he was awake. He lay in his bed categorizing the spells he would teach the students when they started at the end of October. So many useful spells came to mind. Some were easier than those he had taught the first time around, used less concentration. He would still work with them on their patronus charms, but now he would add a few of the new hexes he knew. Ginny’s Reduccio would be great, since it combined reducto and accio, shrinking and summoning the person could be very helpful in situations. Sectumtempus would be another. This was based off of Severus’ original spell, but instead of permanent damage, it was temporary and minimal blood loss inflicted as it was only skin deep. As a deterrent though, it was very effective.
“I’m not treating you like a girl, I’m showing you that you are important enough for me to be considerate of.” Harry explained softly, watching Draco sink into the chair, and pushing it in.
Harry felt.  He could distract himself with what he felt.  This with Draco was dangerous, if he lit the match, there is no telling what would happen.  Draco’s lips barely grazed his ear, and Harry could not take it.  The pull too strong, his will too weak.
“Civilly, why are you actually being civil? This is completely out of character for you.” Harry started, thinking it was obvious.
Pale hands became urgent, needing to feel Harry’s skin as well, their fumbling was making them both impatient.  Harry pulled his wand and spelled their tops off, leaving them in just trousers.  The relief was immediate, but the urgency increased.  Harry stroked each inch of pale flesh he could find, his mouth was quickly leaving marks all over the ivory skin, causing Draco to cry his name each time.
“Where have you been?  We were looking all over for you, and Dumbledore asked us to let him know if you were not back by 10, its 10:15 now!” She rushed through her words, all the while glowering at him.  That glower had never changed.  She had that way, similar to Ron’s mom, of making a person sit up and take notice, all with a look.  In fact she and Mrs. Weasley were so much alike, Ron often complained he had married his mother.
Escalation happened with Harry stepping in front of Weasley, and Draco moving in front of Pansy.  And Draco made his move.  He reached forward and grabbed Harry’s collar, and shoved him quickly against the nearest wall.  The element of surprise was good, he could kiss him quickly and then run before spells were cast.  Harry’s eyes were wide, and Draco quickly pressed his lips to Harry’s.
Harry stopped just inside Dumbledore’s office to see Molly Weasley, standing next to a bandaged Mr. Weasley.  At least it was only his arm this time, he noticed as the man held it gingerly.
“I owe your mother a debt, I will not discuss this with you. But if you want your family to retain its current position in wizarding society, I suggest you arrange a meeting for me and your mother in Hogsmeade. Bring your goons if you must, but if you value your way of life, I suggest you do so soon, before I cannot repair the damage that will be done by your inaction.” Harry was quite in his words.
Harry snickered a bit, then calmed himself at the awkward look from Hermione.  He sobered a bit. “I had a meeting with Mrs. Malfoy.  I am not at liberty to discuss details except with the headmaster.  Oh, and Draco and I have turned a new leaf towards friendship,” Harry replied, looking at Ron’s pinched red face.  Hermione raised both eyebrows.  It was unnerving how she could convey so much with just a single look… She made a great mom.
Harry started to fall back asleep, while mulling over the order of spells and hexes, curses and counters.
Harry breathed hard and tried to detach when his power showed her more than he had wanted.  He clawed for control, only to be soothed by his own power.  He finally let it go… His past laid bare, his soul displaying things he had hidden for so long...‘Take us where you will’ Harry thought.  When his power finally receded, she sat back tears streaming down her face.  He sat once more on a perfectly plump chair regaining control of his own emotions… He did what he always had done… Shoved memories and unwanted emotions inside a chest in his mind, hoping to not examine them again until far in the future.
One by one Harry showed him how to pull the hidden memories and shape them, into tight bricks, how to use the Occlusion fabric imbued with the shield and wrap each one up as a brick.  It saddened Harry how few bright happy memories the Professor actually possessed.   There were a lot of neutral memories, but that was standard.  The balance was going to be harder to maintain with so few happy memories.  He will have to help Severus build more, no matter how small, happy memories were powerful.  Harry went to pick up the last happy memory to help, and found it to be relatively new, and the aura that it gave off gave Harry the impression of Sirius.  Severus snatched the memory out of a surprised Harry’s hands, “I got this.” He said as he slowly pushed Harry out of his head.  Harry found himself staring at his professor with a wide grin.  He wiped it away before it could be seen, and decided to meditate while waiting for Severus.  Harry added his own new happy memory to the thick brick wall between two very dark bricks.
“Cum with me, Draco!” Harry cried as his release tore through him with the power of a lightning bolt striking him. Harry’s eyes never left Draco’s silver as he flew over the edge.  He collapsed onto Draco’s sticky stomach. He held onto the blond as they both tried to regain their breath.  Harry rolled them over onto the bed, he reached for his wand and cast several cleansing charms. He pulled a pain potion from his drawer as Draco snuggled closer.
Draco positioned himself, letting his own precum lubricate Harry’s entrance.  He pushed in and heard Harry groan in pleasure.  His own body captivated by the intense pressure being squeezed by Harry’s body.  He pulled out and pushed back in, absorbing the intensity of the heat of Harry.  All of Draco was centered on the joined part of their bodies.  His breath was slow, his heart was beating out of his chest.  The white heat of the pleasure was enough to bring tears to his eyes, he leaned forward and drew Harry upright.  He thrust in while reaching around and letting the drippings of Harry coat his hand.  He stroked each time he rocked his hips into Harry.  They were both making hissing noises, Draco bit down softly on Harry’s shoulder… Harry shuddered and spilled over Draco’s hand. The blond’s name spilling from an angel's lips.  Draco shuddered his own release when he felt Harry’s body clamp down on him taking him over the edge.
“That mutt cornered me at the last meeting practically begged me to forgive him, and then all of a sudden started to make logical sense on topics that usually he only had juvenile comments on.” Severus said with exasperation.
“Well… I won’t let him have all the fun. Come on, lets test out our own abilities.” Ron said as he leaned forward and took off...Draco not far behind.
Harry and his friends were eating lunch in the Great Hall, when Draco approached their table.  Draco was nervous, not sure how to start things, but he knew he wanted to be the one to show the first gesture.  His heart beat at a frantic pace, each step closer to the raven haired boy.  What would Harry do, now that he was letting his guard down, showing Draco to the school?
I don’t like your heavy handed ways, but they seem to serve a purpose. I have thought long and hard about what you said. As I do not have a favorable opinion of you, I do have to acknowledge your power. Your insight is on target. I do not relish the thought of working with you, but in light of recent events, you are the lesser of three evils. I will maintain my ministry post, and help where I can, though I do so reluctantly. If the balance of power shall be swayed, so too will my loyalty. I am not a blind follower, Mr. Potter. But I do see opportunity in aligning with the strong.
“I know it wasn’t him, Harry.  But it is hard for me to see the difference, and even harder for me to trust him.” Ginny replied, graceful as always.
In the hall, Harry sensed he was being followed once again.  He moved to a darker alcove off to his left and waited.
She grinned back, she had not been liking how Lavender had been looking at Ron lately, and maybe, she would forget her pride and just ask Ron out herself.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked, not taking his hand away, afraid the loss of color in Harry meant something foreboding.  The raven haired boy had quickly gone from peachy to ghost.  Harry’s body was trembling, and cold.  Draco stopped their movement.
Harry smiled darkly, as if he knew the obsessive need.  He slowly stood back, turned towards another door and flicked his wrist.  The sound of gushing water filled the silent room.  Harry turned towards the sound and entered the bath, slowly letting his jacket fall, and then the blue ash-filled shirt.  Draco followed and took his time disrobing as well.
Draco was quiet, he really didn’t know what to say.  For years he had envied Harry, the easy way the boy seemed to find glory, and how people flocked around him.  Draco had wanted that for himself.  The picture Harry painted, did not sound so appealing anymore.  How could one live such a caged existence?
Ron stared at two of the latest models, so Harry played fair after all... He grabbed the one on the right and all three headed out to the rear yard… The wards extended straight up according to Harry, so there would be no entrance from above, but they could fly as high as they wanted.  The yard was expensive, though not as long as the Quidditch pitch, it was wider though.
“Thank you.” was all he said before ascending the stairs, shielding his bed, and fell asleep with the last thought of Harry… that made him smile.
“If it’s important to you the old bat join us, I have no objections. I will behave like an adult. Promise.” Sirius conceded.
Harry moved his barefoot forward and he called for the flames, he could control them now.  They danced up from the stone into his body, he opened his mouth and the red flames rolled out and surrounded his body… cloaking him but not consuming.
“Ok, if you say so. Do we have to eat with them too? I don’t see any empty spots.” Greg said… he sounded as indifferent over the change as anyone could be.
Severus pulled out of Sirius’s mind. He was seething. He wanted to shake Sirius and get him to see sense, he also wanted to pummel Lupin for his interference. Evidently the wolf was miserable and wanted company. Severus moved towards one of his cabinets he had not needed in a long time, and pulled out a small purple vial. He walked back to the mutt who was staring off into space, evidently still reeling from the fact Severus just entered his mind.
After lunch Harry had a free study period which he used to relax in his room. Mr. Weasley would arrive to meet with him Friday evening, in Dumbledore’s office. No doubt the Headmaster wanted to know what was going on. There was a tap at his window that brought his attention. He opened it to let in a very elegant owl. He pulled a treat from his nightstand and offered it to the bird. He took the note and watched the bird neatly eat the treat, then fly out of the window.
Out in the hallway, they walked side by side, no persisting first period class.  “How are you feeling?” Harry asked, looking Draco over for obvious bruises.
Draco’s cries were soft and whispered, though desperate and amazing.  Harry had done that, the heat built higher in his veins, and he pulled his hand away from Draco’s cock to hold hard to Draco’s legs as he slammed in one last time.
The grey of life is consuming.  Every day it eats you, the bad and the good, though there is not much good going on right now.  How can you tell if you are even alive, when you go through the motions every day.  The pain in your life is dulled by the passionless expressions you display for the world.  In that one moment, he was bleeding, blood flowing into the pool of water on the floor in the bathroom at Hogwarts.  In that moment, he was alive, and those remorseful emerald eyes captured his.  In that moment all he wanted was to be known, to be alive.  His life was full of lies, but Harry was the only truth he knew.  The magnet of his anger and the only one who could make him bleed and know that he lives.  He was saved in that moment, by the chosen one.  Saved in a way that could only be expressed, as from himself and the grey life he leads.
Severus smiled at the thought of James Potter’s face if he heard Harry say ‘surrogate son’.  He could handle that… He patted Harry’s shoulder.  “Let’s get back to in then…”
“Harry, so far, all I hear from you is good sense, and sound logic.  Your mature, you have the same mind working as an adult, and the calmness.  Your anger is what used to get you into trouble, and you're rushing into things without thinking.  Luck is good, but sense is better.  I kind of like how you have changed.  You're still you, but better, more mature and definitely someone I can trust.” She assured, her warm comfort seemed to seep from her.
“I suspected, but oh my… I might need a cold shower.” Pansy replied, watching the scene before her.  Dark and light were oblivious to all but each other.
“It’s been at the school for as long as the school has been here, Sir. But cursed for only 50 years or so.” Harry added. He cleaned up and left the dungeon. He was tired and needed a good shower, his whole body felt gross from the brewing and potion making.
Draco merely nodded, his head dizzy with the pain and the overwhelming musk coming from where he buried his face.  He let his hands skim Harry’s leg and moved to unzip the trousers.  He did not understand the desperation he felt, but he fumbled as he moved fast to free the prize he was fantasizing about.  Just when he caught sight of the purple head and thickness of Harry’s cock his head was jerked back slightly away.  He cried out and looked up into stormy green eyes.
Harry turned and walked over to an old book cupboard where most of the old potions text books were kept, he opened it and rummaged around in it.
“You are not her... I would have gladly died because she was dead. But now I live every day, for you. I go to a madman with only the thoughts of a stupid mutt to keep me from doing something stupid.” Severus spoke against Sirius's neck, nipping down for punctuation.
Harry landed softly on the green grass, it was a bright meadow of flowers. He could not determine his location yet. He turned around to find a very elegant, but cool Narcissa Malfoy standing to one side of the meadow.
Ron accepted that.  Harry placed a map he made of Privet Drive on the desk in front of them.  Ron pointed out obvious places to have the Order members stationed, and the place where they should ‘leave’ their post.  “I suggest Remus, Tonks, Mad Eye, and Shacklebolt.  Those are who the Death Eaters would expect, though keep Dumbledore away, he does not need to be there if your power gets displayed.  Have Severus sit this one out, guarding Vincent or some such nonsense to keep his status quo for both sides open.”  He continued looking at the map, “You should be here, he pointed to a spot on the lawn.  Have the Death Eaters be directed to here,” He pointed to another spot.  He thought about it.  “If You-Know-Who arrives he will most likely go directly inside the house… So since you do not want a full confrontation, stay outside.  You can confine him to the house and he can see your full power that way. Sort of like a front-row seat.”
“I want to sign the papers and be gone tonight.  Can we do that?  Can we let Dudley know?” She started shaking...needing something, anything to keep her here and in the present… Her hand shook as she reached to wipe tears from her long face.  Thoughts of Dudley would hold her here.  A handkerchief was pressed into her palm as she tried to dry her eyes… There was no stopping the continuous flow of tears as her world flooded away from her.
“What do you propose, Mr. Potter? My family and I will consult, but I will ensure they follow the path that leads to their wellbeing. Whatever I did to help you, I am thankful you are here now. Our family is very honored to be graced by the council of the next Augur Saeculum.” Narcissa answered, extending her beautiful pale hand.
“Ahh, well as you can see, if we talk nicely, I have nothing bad to say to provoke you.” Harry said, “Want to start over, on the right foot?” he offered his hand as a gesture of goodwill.
“Then yes, you have my blessing, and my best wishes for your happiness.” She replied, standing to give Harry a hug.
Dinner was no exception to the usual.  Everyone kept to themselves, many just quickly ate and left to attend to other things.  The gossip over Harry and Draco’s friendship seemed to have died down as well… Old news it would seem.  Seamus found Harry this time, and expressed his apologies for his previous behavior.  Harry quickly forgave him and pulled out his pre-written invitation to the ‘defense club’.  Hermione did not understand why Harry prepared it, but now sat smiling at him because of his insight.  Seamus was grateful and excited clapping Harry on the back as he left.
Harry needed Draco like he needed to fly… when Draco entered him, he felt like he was flying.  His eyes saw nothing, and his mind floated in pleasure. Draco’s movements were slow and steady almost hitting that one spot that sent sparks flying through his body.  When he was drawn up, his mind fell apart as each thrust hit his prostate with precision… Draco’s soft bite over his sensitive skin was the breaking of his hold on his release… Feeling Draco follow was another bliss of it’s own…
Harry smiled, “That is called an Impervious Privacy Charm. Unbreakable by all except the caster. It is used by Aurors for interrogation purposes, but also when confidential information needs to be passed in public places. Give me a minute before you start asking questions. And I’ll explain a little not everything.”
Harry examined those bricks, he knew which memories they were, though their color seemed to have faded from black, to just very dark.  He would have to examine his memories soon to ensure the proper balance was maintained.
Harry was trying to get comfortable, but he couldn’t gain the rest he had hoped for.  No position felt comfortable, blanket bunched up, pillows fluffed, and still nothing.  He tossed and turned, and yet his mind would not turn off.  So he got up to finally accomplish the one thing he was looking forward to, yet scared of.  He padded over to his trunk, and fished out the mirror that had been long forgotten in his vision.  He moved then back to his bed and cast a simple privacy charm.
Voldemort was gone, Death Eaters were either in Azkaban or reformed. Even without that, most witches and wizards feared him and would not jeopardize their so-called security.  Harry had expected Voldemort’s death to be greeted with applause and happiness. Instead, He was greeted with fear and caution.  Sure his closest friends were still the same.  But the wizarding world both revered him and feared him.  Times were not like they were to the 11-year-old boy introduced to his fame for the first time. Even Ginny had feared him at first, but then she got over it.  Harry had never really forgiven her for that.  The girl had known what he was supposed to do, but when faced with reality, she couldn’t even look at him anymore.
“What about Ginny?” Ron asked, his tone tainted with rage. Ginny was family, and that was still a raw moment for him, and for the rest of the Weasleys.  They do not forgive a trespass so easily against one of their own.
“Understood, Mrs. Malfoy.  Thank you.” Harry bowed, then reached for the box she extended, “How did you know which one?”
Harry stood at the door of number 4 Privet Drive.  He was not sure if he really wanted to be here.  There were so many memories within this house.  None of them were good.  He knocked loudly and Snape stood off to the side waiting for him.
Green eyes danced dangerously, "Tell me what you want." One knee pressing hard into Draco's hardness.
“Wisdom” Harry’s voice roared through the room, his arms sweeping out around him in an upward arch and he traced the rune with one hand, a glowing green rune.
They had fun, pure fun and they all flew circles around each other.  Ron was good at sharp turns and Draco was good at stealth...Each had their skills that made them unique, but still fun.  Ron got back to Hogwarts using Harry’s cloak, promising to return it after class the next day.
“You can’t give up everything and be friends with Potter!  He is back, and you know our families will require our loyalty.” Vince spat, “Potty will be nothing but smear on the Dark Lord’s shoes.”
Professor Snape came out of the office, robes swirling around him, and a contemptuous look on his face.
“Move out the way Greg!” Draco shouted, pointed his wand directly at Vince’s head, “Incarcerous!”  Ropes flew out of his wand and wrapped his attacker quickly.  The force of the will behind the spell had sent so many ropes that Vincent looked like a mummy.
Draco stared back at the beast.  This is what Harry killed when he was 12?  This is what met Ginny and Harry. This is what Harry had to face because of his father?  Draco had been so smug and mean during that time.  Faced with the reality of his own ignorance, he felt undeserving, as if he would soil Harry by just touching him.  Draco tried to pull his hand away, but Harry held it firmly.  They stopped walking and Harry looked at him, he couldn’t meet Harry’s eyes.
Petunia thought about that.  She understood now, her view of her sister and her nephew were colored by her jealousy and her husband’s constant promoting of that belief, ‘different means freaks’.  She would wait though… what if crossed her mind.. this could be a trick.
“We can still form Dumbledore's Army for training the other students,” Harry said, looking at Hermione for a moment, who smiled at him, he had been resisting that year, “And I will teach a real defense against the dark art’s class that will not be found in these halls.”
“Then you rarely saw me out of the company of others. I can be what I want, when I am alone. I am tired of fighting, and tired of the stress.” Draco replied with a resigned sigh.
Harry was in Dumbledore’s office following dinner, he was patiently waiting for Arthur's arrival, all the while petting Fawkes. She was always an amazing bird. The Floo flared to life and Arthur stepped forward. Harry turned towards both men.
Their silver manes were identical, one was only slightly smaller than the other.  The form was perfect, the outline of tight muscles as they moved flowed beautifully.  There was no aggression, but a tension was between the two flawless forms.  Harry was mesmerized by the display, and shocked at the change in his own patronus.  In the next moment, just when it seemed one or the other would pounce, all the patronus’ dissipated and left the room quiet and immobile.
“Not an actual present, but sort of.  Can the Malfoy’s spend Christmas with us? Since they will have to pretend to not be on good terms, I figured they could Hide with us for Christmas and enjoy each other’s company.” Harry spoke rapidly trying to get it all out before Sirius blew up about it.
“Are you sure telling her is the right course of action. What if she tells the Minister?” Severus asked.
“I don’t understand.  My patronus never changed even after I married in my vision.  It always was the Stag you knew it to be.” Harry exclaimed rather intently.
Severus leaned forward as Harry detailed what happened in his vision and his thoughts on the plan he talked to Draco about.
Draco’s eye wavered a moment, but he truthfully shook his head.  He did not know Harry’s intentions.  He wanted them to be long term, needed them to be more than one night.  So he would beg for that.
When the music stopped Harry took his hand and led him over to a small table that had appeared.  A silver candelabra sat in the center, and two elegant glasses of butterbeer were on the table.  Harry held out the chair for Draco to sit, and winked when he was given a slight glare.
“Because I wanted your attention, your eyes on me, not on her.  I’m sorry, I know you loved her, she was kind, but she never saw you… not like I did… and you…you never saw me. I was angry, jealous, and I wanted to make you hurt like I did.  I’m sorry, I know I caused you pain, I’m sorry for pulling you here tonight and not asking.” Sirius bowed his head, he had finally relieved his burden, held for so many years. It was his main torture in Azkaban.
A/N~ A continuation of the same day well it builds on the previous day where the last chapter lets off.. and there is one more chapter to this same day as well... Sometimes there is just a lot going on in Harry's world. :D  I thought I would share some things... When I write Harry and a little bit for Dumbledore, I listen a lot to Christina Perri's song Human...take a listen, it truly is my idea of Harry.  For the Magical scenes such as Umbridge or Dung... 'My songs know what you did in the dark' by Fall Out Boys.  Augur book and upcoming Merlin talks, Lily's Theme from the soundtracks...  Listening to these might give you a 'feel' for how I feel my perception of these characters.
“I am working on the strategy to ensure everything is in place.  I am also looking to ensure any changes here on my side do nothing to upset the Dark Lord too much to discontinue his focus on obtaining the prophecy.  Everything hinges on that.  Any hints he could move faster than June on the prophecy would be appreciated.  Keeping him obsessed on the prophesy is key.  Other plan details are forming, and any that involve you, or your family, I will make you aware of.”  Harry explained.
Earlier that day the Order of the Phoenix had a meeting to finalize the schedule for the Hall of Prophecy rotations.  Dumbledore was adamant not to have any changes, and he imparted to the rest that they would be including Harry in some meetings in the future.
After most of his classmates had left, Harry lingered behind. He approached the professor who was busy at his desk. Those dark eyes leveled on him. “To what do I owe the honor, Mr. Potter.” Professor Snape sneered at him.
Severus look to see Sirius sway, bottle in hand and a look of pain on his face. The air felt heavy with something he could not place. The darkness was not something he was used to since Sirius stayed with him...but his eyes were adjusting.
“Waiting for news on a small project.  What are you doing?” Harry replied, turning his head to look at Draco.  Bad idea if he wanted to keep his focus and calm.
The school work and classes were tedious the rest of the day.  That evening before supper, they were informed that the ministry had decreed no participation in organizations, save for the sanctioned ones, that meant Quidditch was out for the entire year.  Umbridge had delivered the message, and it had spread like wild fire.  Harry just bided his time, this was not a great grievance, but still she should be watched.  So far, no inquisitor squad had been formed.
“You are mine, mutt... Not a plaything… mine. There is no ‘goodbye’.” He said the last with a feral growl erupting from his throat. He picked Sirius up and carried them back to their bed.
They entered the common room, and several eyes turned on them. Harry surveyed the room, he hurt seeing some of them again. If he played his cards right, this could all be over soon and they could all have peace to grow up. His eyes landed on Ginny, She was sitting next to Dean Thomas, talking and nothing got in the way of their conversation. There was a small pang of hurt, but it was easy to push aside when he saw how happy she was or would be once she dumped Michael Corner later this year. Harry moved over to an empty couch, joined by Ron and then Hermione. Harry saw others look covertly and others not so covertly over at them expecting to hear the conversation. Harry reached for his wand and cast the impervious privacy charm once again.
“Thank you for coming.  I need both of you for testing purposes.  All the charms work perfectly so there will be no damage to your persons, but I need to test a couple of scenarios.  One in which Professor Snape will be standing next to the webbing, and you, the headmaster will need to cast a spell at him, one I will try to use one of my charms on.  I need to find the right protective charm that will block a powerful spell, and also push Severus back against my webbing.  I have three in mind, but will need to test each one.” Harry explained.
Harry groaned at the look in Draco’s eyes as he spoke, the molten mercury stole his breath.  Parseltongue turned Draco on… Harry needed to remember that.
Severus could feel it, pain was the power that hung over the room. It was suffocating, and cutting. His mutt evidently was drunk, and hurt. He remembered the words that had changed his world not so long ago.
Harry walked alone to the Great Hall for breakfast and did not look back.  He knew it was a test, but an easy one.   He would not lie or force people, that was not who he was.
Once Harry had pulled away, Severus spoke more gently.  “Now can you tell me what you have said to that imbecile of a godfather about me?  The man is practically embarrassing as he tried to apologize to me for the past.”
He walked into the classroom, and noted that the Professor waited for him at the supply closet. Harry turned and shut the door, not locking it this time.
Draco had looked to Harry, and remembered that one touch in the woods.  That cleansing touch that seemed to ignite a heart that had shriveled long ago.  It was with this thought that his Patronus entered the room, he opened his eyes and smiled.  Had he tried before his friendship with Harry, either he would never have been able to cast one, or it would not represent his tie to the great lion of Gryffindor?  Others seemed to understand only one significance, his allegiance, but Hermione’s knowing gaze found his silver one, and he blushed down to his toes.
It was the Weasley that started it this time, instigating Pansy by mentioning her mom or some such nonsense.  Draco wasn’t listening, he was waiting.  Waiting for Harry to get involved as he always does.  The thought of kissing Harry was nerve-wracking, Draco felt nauseous, which he totally knew would happen.  However, a bet was a bet.
“I can’t talk here, help me to the classroom at the bottom of the tower... Too much to deal with here.” Harry said, breathless.  His face had lost all color, he was paler than Draco now.  Draco heaved an arm over one shoulder, and put his arm around Harry’s waist and they descended the stairs quickly.  Harry was having trouble breathing.  His eyes had glossed over as if he were in some other place.  Draco walked them to a nearby classroom.
“Excuse me, Professor. I need to speak to the Headmaster alone.” Harry stated, he sounded dignified even.
“During the war, every time we dispatched a dark artifact, it was like a homing beacon for Voldemort, he knew of the destruction which made him more dangerous, and he could then predict where we were going next. I found a connection between artifacts cursed with dark magic and their owners, the curse acted as a way for them to find it, or as a portal for them to act through when tampered, or for the curse to activate if the owner were no longer alive. This potion when applied to a container, instrument of destruction or the item itself, delayed the activation of the spell and allowed us time to capture the caster, or destroy the item without any negative repercussions. The department of Mysteries benefitted from the development, as they are the ones who study the dark artifacts the most.” Harry said, then went quiet, wondering if he gave away too much. He looked up at Professor Snape for a moment, then back at his work.
The opportunity presented itself later that day, just after 8th-year Potions.  Their normal Gryffindor/Slytherin squabble.  It was predictable really.  Every Tuesday and Thursday, as they filed out of the room, someone from either house would provoke the other, and the names would be called, a few pushes, and possibly a wand or two drawn... Same thing, different day.  Only this time, with his friends watching, Draco Malfoy would take it up a notch and get rid of his bet obligation.
As an Auror, this was one potion they could brew in their sleep along with the dittany, and he had Professor Snape to thank for being able to do it better than anyone else.  Now even his classmates stood a good chance at being able to do the best, after being afforded the best teaching by the best Professor.  A couple of times he had looked up and smiled at his professor. Though the man did not smile, he did quirk his lips.  There was no doubt that Professor Snape would see the potion results as a testament to how much better his teaching was.  In the end though, Professor Snape only nodded and accepted the potions as acceptable.
The meeting was concluded, with the Headmaster formally welcoming the Malfoy’s into the fold, and an explanation that he would provide support, should anything go wrong.  He did not state who was working for him, but that he had someone on the inside that will watch and act if needed.
Draco turned into the strong arms that waited for him and drifted to asleep, knowing now... all darkness and grey was gone.  As long as he was Harry's, he would be alive and free from the Iris of the Malfoy life.
December 18th, the night of Arthur's attack, was upon Harry quicker than he wanted it to be, yet still, it felt like an eternity.  Harry waited in the library for the sound that Madam Pince shooing people out.  On his study desk was a book on the Patronus Charms and their meanings, he hadn’t really given up finding his own answer, he also had not asked anyone either, afraid he already knew the real answer.  His focus was random, looking towards various student groups, his book and every now and then towards the windows.
Draco tried to turn his head away, but Harry’s soft fingers just guided his gaze back to those emerald eyes, piercing right down to his soul.
Albus Dumbledore came through the doors of the infirmary, followed by Professor McGonagall and Ron Weasley.
“I didn’t plan to enjoy it,” he said, his lashes drifting down so he didn’t have to see those searching eyes.
“Keep your wand with you when you go places like the loo or to bed.  Are you coming to the defense class tonight?” Harry asked quietly.
Harry’s focus was a beast of its own.  Harry could still perform while thinking of Draco, in a way it seemed that those thoughts helped his magic grow stronger.  There had been missions for the Auror department where his focus should have been broken, but the training subconsciously took over.  He was thankful for that training now.  There would be time for just them after he finished his project.
Draco was at his wits end waiting for Potter’s reply.  He had been nicer, there was no way the man could take offense now.  Unless he just wanted to be pompous. The bird tapped at his window and he let it in quickly and tore open the parchment.  It was his letter that returned with another small addition.
“Bygones, and all that, Mal... Draco.” Hermione said, offering her hand to him as well.  It was a peace offering and he knew it, it was also a challenge.  If he took it, he would deny the pureblood/muggle born line of thinking he had attested to for so long. If he refused, his friendship with Harry would be greatly at risk.  His thinking only lasted a brief moment, and he reached out and took her hand gently, and shook it delicately.
Beside the older man was a sallow looking man.  He had short neatly styled hair that was a mix of grey and brown.  The man did not look altogether that old, but there was an ancient air about him.  He was tall, but not as tall as Dumbledore.
“Next,” Harry looked at Hermione, “Can you research visions, and see if there are any documentation on ones such as mine, and the effects decisions have on them?”
It was two days before Halloween and Harry waited patiently inside the Room of Requirements, his impervious privacy charm was imbued into the walls, no one would have any inclination of what went on, nor have the ability to gain access while he taught.  He would not allow a repeat of his vision, where Umbridge broke into the room.
Harry needed to get them somewhere private and comfortable. He knew one of the classrooms would be good enough, and he could transfigure anything he needed to be comfortable there.  They entered a dark room, which smelled as if it hadn’t seen use in years. Harry started casting privacy charms and transfigured some of the desks into furniture, two chairs, a bed, and a table.
Turning he watched as his teacher pace about in his usual billowy manner.  The black gaze turned on him, pinning him to the spot.
Harry met Draco out on the veranda of their home.  They watched the sunset together, sipping tea, and enjoying the calm before the storm.
Those piercing eyes reached inside Draco.  They seemed to connect to the part of him that still burned since his last touch.  Draco inhaled sharply to steady his voice, “I have heard about that kind of vision only happening once.”
“You know nothing Vince.  I chose my side, I will stay. Now let me pass.” Draco’s eyes narrowed, his hand twitching while holding his wand.
It was the headmaster that broke the moment with a cough.  Harry looked away and calmed himself.  He looked back, seeing Draco trying as well to appear normal sliding that Malfoy mask into place, but Harry’s gaze stopped him, and Draco remained.  Harry would not let Draco slip back into becoming Malfoy, he wanted open honesty and emotion.
Hermione stood quickly, “Please do, Draco.” her voice was forced, but it was pleasant.  Ron only nodded, that was probably all Harry could expect for now.
“You don’t deserve to work for that prick,” Harry mumbled as he shooed the bird towards his window.  The owl hooted and took off.
Professor Snape sent a spell that collected each book and stacked them neatly into a tight corner of the room.  He then spelled the book on his desk to replicate and floated one copy per pair to the desks.
Draco laughed, “Did you think that he would have given up flying even with getting older?  It seems that I forgot how much he loved this.  We will have to do this more often.”
“So …” He tried to say something to break the tension, but nothing came to him.  Instead he went for humor, “You going snogging today Ron?”
“Good morning Pansy, Is Draco still asleep or is he roaming?” Harry asked trying to keep his tone jovial.
He couldn’t lower himself for Potter.  Then he thought of the pain his mother was in and sighed.  It was only words.  He could write the words at least.  He clenched his jaw and wrote the few words Potter had asked for.
There was no scene during breakfast on Monday, just all the houses gathered where they were supposed to be.  And the rest of the students milling about getting ready for their classes.  The first class for Harry was potions with the slytherins, and Harry was actually looking forward to it. Potions had continued to intrigue him after he had left Hogwarts, and he guessed Snape and that book had something to do with it.
Harry let his hand fall on the other cheek just as sharply, and hardened further at the following moan.
Harry turned, leaving a pensive Professor in his classroom. As he made his way to the great hall, he caught a flash of bright blond in the hallway.
Harry arrived later than he thought to the common room.  He slipped in quietly, hoping not to alarm anyone.  Someone coughed gently from the couch, and Harry turned to see Ron waiting for him.
Harry’s vision cleared and he found his hand resting on a crystal ball, and looked up to see the stunned face of a much younger Ronald Weasley. He turned his head and looked around, his eyes collided with eyes the size of dinner plates, set behind glasses that magnified them. Harry Potter stood quietly, surveyed the room with trepidation. Eyes landing on a pensive Lavender Brown, a haughty Draco Malfoy, a very alive Vincent Crabbe and many more.
“Sir, thank you for helping me with this. It is much appreciated.” Harry said. He pulled a parchment from his robes and handed the list to Professor Snape.
His body reacted to each footfall on the stairs.  His cock ached and dripped, his arms ached in an almost pleasurable pain as he held them behind his back.  He looked up with so much longing when Harry pushed open the door.
Harry got up and headed down to the dungeons, hoping the professor would have a moment for him to ask about some ingredients.
After they said their goodbyes Harry got ready for the next defense club meeting.  This would be an important one, Dumbledore would attend and so would Professor Snape.  It had to be perfect.
Harry stood and used his wand to shut the door. “I am just putting up a privacy charm,” he informed her before he cast the Impervious Privacy Charm.
Draco had always had a way of getting under his skin like nobody else. Though there was something about the blond that excited him.  No other spark of life flickered with the others in his life, only Draco.  This could be more fun than he had anticipated… and Mrs. Malfoy gave him full leeway.  He would take it.
“Don’t go without the instructions I left after Arthur's departure.  You will need those as much as he will, and when you find what you are looking for, I’ll need the box.” Harry spoke firmly.  He knew the headmaster understood the importance of the matter, but he could not help but emphasize it.
“Well, Ron won’t like it… he’s a hard enough time with the friends bit.” Hermione spoke quietly, but with some steel lining her voice, “I don’t like it, friends is one thing, but this…” She broke off… “Can we trust him?  I’m not sure about Ron, but I still have doubts.”
“Want to come over to our cottage and fly this evening? I could give you detention… break a few rules, curfew and all…” Harry offered, watching his friends eyes light up.
Draco screamed Harry’s name when he felt that amazing tongue dart inside him.  The euphoria was overtaking him and he needed release.
“He was the reason I was late in my second year. He tried to get me expelled…” Harry said with a smile of recollection.
“Very well, I will try my best. But do not expect favoritism Mr. Potter in class, everyone will be miserable.” Severus said, a slight quirk of a smile on his lips.
Severus was trying not to stare at the man offering apologies.  Sirius black was wearing tight fitting dark trousers, a white dress shirt, and a black blazer with gold cufflinks dangling on each sleeve.  The white dress shirt was open at the neck, the V revealing parts of his chest.  Severus was having a hard time focusing on his own smirk and keeping his own face placid.  Sirius must have bathed in cologne.  It was an overpowering scent that seemed to grab him and certain parts of his anatomy were beginning to notice.
“I forgot, you don’t know. But then again, I really don’t know why I am talking to you now like this.” Harry wondered.
Hermione was curious about his look, but she knew better than to pry.  They spoke the password and the Gargoyle moved so they could walk up to the Headmaster’s office.  Hermione waited just outside the main office.
“I have a potion that needs to be brewed before Friday, Sir. I would like to request the use of some of your ingredients. I will keep a list of what I use and replace them, but ordering them is out of the question due to time constraints.” Harry supplied.
Harry tried to convey what he felt, “My life was almost normal... after this,” his finger traced Draco’s parted lips, “normal will never be enough.”
“We will do what we can, thank you for all the thought you put into this, there is a plan in that head of yours right now, isn’t there.” He asked softly.
Severus looked at the headmaster, quirked an eyebrow and moved over to the bed. “Mr. Potter, open your eyes please, Madam Pomfrey needs to ask you a few questions.”
His hands smoothed their way up the front of Draco’s legs, but Harry remained on his knees.  He stopped just before touching Draco’s aching shaft.  Harry moved his hands to cup the pale cheeks in front of him, and he bent down to kiss each side, laving the skin with his tongue.
Harry could not move, afraid Draco would stop if he moved. His breath was stolen when Draco licked his entrance, his voice was not his to control.  When Draco speared him with his tongue, Harry saw stars… He wanted Draco to fill him tonight… needed His savior to be with him…
Draco licked a particularly soft muscle outline, letting the salt and spice of Harry compliment the scent of wild earth.  His hands reached around the front, letting his fingers slide against skin and hair, rough and hot.  Draco started to let himself go lower tasting Harry’s lower back, dropping soft kisses and taking some of Harry’s muscles in his mouth and running his tongue over the skin, letting go to leave a dark coloration.
Severus looked around the room, “I can keep it in my rooms for now, detention again Thursday. Can you get the test artifact by then?”
Severus broke the kiss and whispered in his most seductive voice, “She was a love I never should have had. You are a man I would die every day for, if I could not love you.”
Harry also mentioned that he would need both the Headmaster and Professor Snape’s help when he was ready to test his project.  Dumbledore assigned him a room in the third-floor corridor, close to where Harry met Fluffy in his first year. The headmaster also agreed to help Harry with whatever he needed to test his project.  When Severus finally arrived, he and the headmaster moved off to the side to observe.
Severus pulled out a bottle with a clear liquid in it.  He let go the stopper and three drops fell as Harry opened Vernon’s mouth…
That was not an offer that Harry had been expecting.   But it made Harry really think, so much could be put right.
Harry and Ron were content with their strategy.  Ron was snoring within minutes of laying down.  Harry on the other hand, was worried if the Malfoy’s would meet with him.  What if they did not accept his protection? Could he give up all he knew, give up Draco, and go back to the life in his vision?  Just in the small amount of time he had grown to know Draco, made the decision harder.  Why could he not have a simple straightforward life? Did he not deserve peace or normalcy?  Harry sighed deeply, crawled into his bed and let sleep claim him.
“Since I turned 11, I have found out how famous I am for something I had no control over.  From that point on, I have had no real freedom to just be ‘Harry’.  Always the ‘boy who lived’, the ‘chosen one’, the ‘savior of the wizarding world’, etc… never just me.  Now I get to add the title of ‘Augur Saeculum’ to the list of who I am without being me.” Harry’s eyes had lost their brilliance when he looked at Draco, “You and everyone else want all this power and fame, but you don’t realize that with it, you are just a shell of who you could be if you didn’t have to be something to everyone all the time.  I had hoped this vision would allow me to do things earlier so we all could have a somewhat normal life, but for me that seems impossible now.”
Draco, hair still being held tight, scooted closer and rubbed his face into Harry’s crotch while moaning “Please.” “Please” “Please” over and over.
Harry stayed his movements for just a brief moment.  Then pulled almost all the way out, only to slam back in once again.
Harry extended his hand and his quill flew into it. He penned a quick response at the end of the letter rolled it back up and tied it to the owl’s leg.  He handed a treat to the owl.
“Don’t move,” Harry growled out.  He rounded the other side of the bed and pulled Draco’s ass towards the other side.  He parted Draco’s thighs and growled an almost inhuman sound coming from his throat.  He bent down and in one swallow took all of Draco down his own waiting throat, he quickly staved off the blond’s orgasm and pulled back, savoring the taste on his lips.  He looked at Draco’s hole and let his saliva fall to coat the winking entrance.
Draco was breathless, though from the incredible sensation of Harry holding him, or the new way of travel that was exhilarating, he wasn’t sure.  When Harry let go, and Draco felt the loss, the heated imprint of Harry’s arms and body lingered.  Harry spoke in parseltongue again, to a very large door with snakes that moved.  Draco shivered once again, that voice was like a silken cocoon flowing over his skin delivering pleasure all over his body.
“Thank you, I will.” Draco stated, and both Harry and he took their seats among a throng of noise that grew around them.  Harry noted the large smiles at the Teacher’s table.  Well, not Professor Snape, but he wasn’t scowling so that meant he was pleased.  Student’s started to whisper, many furtive glances were sent their way, including Ginny Weasley.  Her glances were the most worrisome, there was something akin to fear in them.  Harry would have to talk to her separately.
Promptly at 8 o’clock, a sleek silver owl flew through his open window and dropped a parchment onto his bed. He opened it with sure hands.
“I’ll tell you how it turned out later.” Harry said, before Ron started to notice, which would not be that soon since he was engrossed in a very large sandwich.
He turned to face Professor Dumbledore who stood agape, “My apologies professor, this one needed some softening. I believe all people have some good in them, and I hope in the coming weeks I can count on your support behind some of my actions?”
In a way that coin was Draco’s salvation.  He felt more free and at ease now that Harry and he were friends.  Harry’s rejection of his friendship in first year stung more than any other interaction since.  All of it was beginning to make sense now.  Draco fell asleep that evening more at ease than he had been since the return of the madman.
“Whatever is past, is past.  We have a future that is all that matters.” Harry whispered, and sighed as he saw the acceptance wash over Draco.
They swirled around him, lighting the entire room in a brilliant rainbow effect.  They stopped swirling and he held out his arms, and each rune dropped to meet his tattoos… and they lit up like florescent lights on his skin as he absorbed them.
Harry watched her go… He knew it was the right decision.  The dominoes were falling into place… He could feel it, the nearness of the end of his task...Just a few more strategic placements and some time…
The runes died down to dark black once more. His eyes did not change...His hands swirled and the wind blew in and around the office, from nowhere…  he rolled his hands together and clouds started to form with the thunder above her, she was frightened now, as she saw the storms flash above her.  His foot fell softly, yet she felt the tremor under her feet. She backed up further.
They finalized some of the details and Harry was happy with their plan.  He would present it to the Order in a few days.
"I see you Draco Malfoy, for who you are." Harry told him not breaking the contact of either eyes or hands.  Slowly he pulled Draco closer.  The heated tears fell on Draco's face washing the blood and soot away in their path.  His hair was dark with soot, his face dark and damaged, but the streaks revealed pale skin underneath.  Harry's free arm encapsulated Draco, pulling the taller man to him.  They held on, this ride was not going to be easy, but together they would take on whatever life threw at them.  Draco knew that without Harry, he would be an empty shell once again.  Nothing they had been through for those many months stamped permanent, or even love or friendship.  Draco and Harry had just been.  Now Draco needed more.  "Where do you want to go from here?  I will follow no matter the choice." Draco whispered into Harry's ear. He felt the shiver, and his own body reacted to that.  "I died you know." Harry said.  Draco stiffened, the thought making his blood run cold. "I did not stay, as peaceful as it was. I had reasons to come back.  One of those reasons was you."  Harry revealed stretching just a bit to reach Draco's ear, "Do you want to go where I wish?"  His breath was heated as it spread out across the shell of Draco's ear, making the blond shiver involuntarily. A thumb caressed a stray tear and left a streak of pale skin as it was wiped away. "Do you want your blood to burn with mine?" Harry tantalized with his tongue as he spoke, tracing the outer shell of Draco's ear, causing Draco’s body to loosen, and Harry's arm to tighten. Draco could only nod, his throat was incapable of working, and the rest of his body was shaming him.  With Harry's tighter grip, Draco felt their bodies blink out of existence for just a moment before reappearing in a darkened room.
The words died in his ears, and when he felt two arms entwine around his neck, he flinched, waiting.  Soft arms and a hint of honey and lemon scent hit his senses.  Draco.
Harry started to get nervous the closer the date of Arthur's attack approached.  When Harry had finally found the perfect combination of charms, he couldn’t wait for Dumbledore and Severus to help him test it full scale.  He had hugged Draco wanting to share this unspoken moment with him.  Harry let the calming scent of Draco wash over him, seeping into his body and wash away his stress.  Draco did not press for more than he offered, and that made Harry’s heart grow.  Harry knew there was no turning back now, he was falling fast for this friend, this savior of his sanity.  Just holding Draco seemed to wash away the world that seemed to be crashing further in on him.  He knew that to the world, Harry Potter would always be more, more than a boy, more than a man, more than a wizard.  But here, in the arms of his own savior, he was just Harry, nothing more.
Severus stared at Harry, that book was very old, and he had forgotten all about it. Harry had improved, but he thought it really just that Harry seemed to be paying more attention. Maybe the vision Harry had, really changed him.
Severus moved closer to the webbing, and Harry showed the Headmaster where he needed to stand.  Harry moved to just the side and waited.  Dumbledore let a strong stinging hex go, Harry blocked it silently, but Severus still stood unmoved.  Harry frowned in concentration, and nodded back to Dumbledore.  The headmaster released a strong cutting hex… Harry’s wand was hidden, but pointed towards Severus, as he whispered, “tuverna”.  The hex flashed as if it hit Severus, he was thrown back, and then the image of Severus faded into a ghostly form as it traveled up the webbing.  Harry stood taller, smiled wider and then laughed.  Severus moved from behind the arch with a bewildered expression.
“Can we?” it was a soft whisper.  “Do you care what others see and say?” Harry asked, needing to know the answer.
“Those first seven, they need to be crushed once, then sliced. They get put in first, and heated until the smoke turns blue and they are just about crisp. Then we add the liquids in the order as on the page.” Harry instructed.
“What’s it going to be?  Whose side are you on?” Draco stated, looking at Vince, then at Theodore and Millicent.
His father was also known for his temper.  Poor Harry had triggered that when he freed Dobby… His father was already stressing out about how to keep things under wraps when the incident occurred.  Draco had been on the receiving end of that anger before.  His father said he had only meant to scare Harry, not actually kill him, but Dobby protected him.  For which Draco was now grateful.  And even with all that, what had Harry done for his family?  Something big, and far reaching.  Harry had mentioned something about his love life path.  And Draco pondered that a moment.  His soul still burned from their connection, but just the thought of Harry with someone else did not sit well with him.
Harry looked at the bag, he felt nothing, so he knew the Horcrux was destroyed, but maybe Professor Snape could use the ash for something.
Harry moved off his bed, still it felt off… His bed, the red hangings thick and rich, the sheets crimson and clean.  The bed was smaller than he was used to, or at least thought he was used to.  How strange it feels, knowing it was a vision, yet feeling like you are living a dream of memories.  He opened his nightstand drawer and retrieved a quill and small bit of parchment.  His heart gave a leap knowing Hedwig would be delivering this note.  No matter how many times he had seen her since the vision, he could not help smiling. She was beautiful, soft and alive.  Something about that bird had always touched him.  Even in his vision, he had never fully replaced her.  Ginny had a family owl, the boys got their own when they started, but Harry, he could never bring himself to actually purchase a new one for himself.  Hagrid tried once, but Harry refused and Hagrid kept the bird for himself.  Grief was an old friend in his life.
Harry nodded, why didn’t he remember that class?  Probably because he slept through each one with Professor Binns… “Well, one sign is they receive a vision where they live for some years, and gain knowledge of that.  They have to accomplish certain tasks to prove their power.”
Harry needed leverage and shifted them so that Draco was laying on his back and Harry could push deeper in.  Draco was panting with each thrust, Harry lowered himself so he could capture Draco’s screams with his own mouth.  The kisses were drugging, and driving them higher.  Each thrust carried them closer to heaven, and their bodies tightened and burned.  Draco met every thrust, Harry demanded every sound with his mouth.  Strong fingers wrapped themselves around Draco, and he could not hold back the bliss any longer.  Streams of hot wet jets shot from his shaft into Harry’s hands and all over their stomachs.  Harry followed, releasing Draco’s mouth to shout his own orgasm to the skies.  They both went limp, Harry rolling them over so as not to break the blissful contact.
Draco wanted to shriek and cuss and throw things.  The man was going to drive him crazy.  He knew he was the only person qualified enough for this potion.  He knew Draco had chosen him because he was the best.  But still, he refused to help!
Quicker than he was expecting the reply came.  Draco’s whole body shook with the reply.  Images that had nothing to do with potions and his mother filled his mind and he shivered.  Harry could not possibly go that far, could he?  Not, Harry… Wait when did he become Harry?  After you just fantasized about dropping to your knees for him. Draco shook his head… No Harry just meant to humiliate him, but at least in private.  Draco looked over the reply one last time and shivered again.
Harry tried to decide, how he should handle this. At this point the family had not done much, other than deliver the diary, and in his vision, Malfoy had turned out alright. And he still felt he owned Narcissa a great deal.
Severus pushed the vial into the man’s hands. “Drink” Severus ordered. Bloodshot eyes glared back at him. “NOW, before I make you.” There was a finality in Severus’ tone that would not be argued with.
“Pluck up the courage and snag Ron early, you will save some heartache for both of you if you do, otherwise it will be another couple of years, before he makes the first move.” Harry said, waiting for the shock to register on her face. She went beet red, then started to speak but said nothing. “Think about it, okay. Trust me.” Harry spoke ever so softly.
“I am not sure she knows, but she inadvertently gave me a gift that may affect her choice, though I am not sure how much.” Harry replied.
After the second week, Draco had taken to reminding Harry when it was time to leave.  His concentration was more severe after he had the entire web spun.  His spells were complex, and difficult, taking a lot of his willpower to cast and weave into each thread.  Draco would sometimes have to interrupt after an incantation and take him up to the tower to pass off to Hermione who would make him sleep.  Draco was getting worried, Harry was starting to get tense and anxious as the third week rolled on.  But on Tuesday Harry seemed to have a breakthrough in whatever he was doing.  Draco watched as Harry seemed to come alive in front of him, eyes bright, smile wide, and he had turned to Draco and hugged him.  Everything in Draco wanted to kiss Harry, but he wanted to let Harry have the focus he needed, he had promised that.  His own needs and wants could wait.
“Is he cheating now?” She asked trying to gain control of her emotions…The revelations were more than she expected, well she had not expected anything really.  Her sister… She could believe that of Lily… compassion was always there.  But her life, now would be upside down if she believed it all… Her life… a lie...No...
The searing pain grabbed both of them, Draco felt spears of fire ripping up his back, and Harry the tight vice threatening to consume him.
“Oh, and I almost forgot.  The next time you see Mundungus Fletcher, ask him to watch Grimmauld Place for an afternoon while we go out somewhere. It’s important that he be left alone there for some time.  You will understand afterwards.” Harry explained.
“I understand, it has not been easy for me either.  Pretending to be a student and falling back into a life that was well over 20 years ago for me.  It’s unnerving reliving memories that did not happen, and seeing people who were dead and gone, alive and walking.”  Harry said, exasperated.
Severus groaned audibly, here was his nemesis’ son and he was about to bare his soul just to hide his thoughts away.  Was it really worth it?  Severus’ scholarly side won out. Learning at any cost was a weakness for him.  He was drawn to power, and new ways to harness it.
“NO!” Severus pressed against Sirius harder. His entire body pinned the other man hard against the wall, “You will not leave me. Not for some silly conversation with a depressed werewolf.”
After they had said their goodbyes, Harry canceled the privacy charm and laid down.  His mind felt more at ease, calm and he drifted closer to sleep until he finally succumbed.
The enemy was forgotten, only the angel that stood before him mattered.  “Let’s show the world then,” Harry, said, bending down to capture those lips once again, this time, he let the charm drop and he went for the whole package. Lips, body, heart, and soul.  His lips crashed down taking everything Draco was offering, losing himself in the heated cavern.  Tasting Draco, and ignoring the gasps behind them and they both clung to each other.
It was dark, and Harry was scared.  Silenced by his word.  Fear crept all over him as he heard the malevolent voices above him.  Dumbledore was pleading with Professor Snape, and he watched as the green flash of death surrounded the headmaster.  Bellatrix sent up a gleeful screech, and raised her wand, casting the Dark Mark over the sky.
“You are my everything, from now until the end my sweet savior,” Harry spoke, his voice sweet and full of love. He changed their positions to hover just above Draco on the couch, and kissed his husband quickly before moving over to the other side to get up.
Severus positioned himself opposite Harry.  His Cruciatus was very strong, he only hoped Harry’s demonstration went well… He looked to the headmaster one more time and received the nod.
Harry nodded, “We have only a few months before she will be able to gain access once again, I cannot let that artifact stay in her vault. Can you retrieve it for me? I will provide all you need to contain its dark magic, all I need to know is when you plan on going so I can have the objects ready.”
“Of course I care, they were not good to me, but I do not want them dead.” Harry knew Draco just wanted to know, but still… They were family.
“Harry…” Draco all but whispered… "I need this, the pain, the surrender… I need it tonight.  Later we can do sweet if you want, but tonight I need all you can give.  I need all of you, darkness included.” He couldn’t bring himself to say it was his first time, he didn’t want to.  He needed to be reminded of how free he was in the sensations of deep surrender.
Harry grinned back, feeling like he was a schoolboy again… He was, he had to remind himself as he headed back to his dorms.  Getting flustered over his reaction to Draco was not on his list of things to do.  Harry understood the implications of ‘belonging together’, but he really did not know how to go about it.  He was usually focused on one thing at a time.  First it was Voldemort, then Auror training, then marriage and family, and work.  Balancing work and family was easy enough.  He had not tried to balance his relationship with Ginny and fight Voldemort, he only had one concentration.
They moved to the Professor’s private sitting room, where comfort was key.  Harry and Severus sat down, and got comfortable.
Severus was standing there staring as Sirius as if he had lost his mind.  Something in those words, struck him as true.  He couldn’t examine them now.  He couldn’t see what Black wanted him to see.  He needed time...Lots of time.
Harry looked at all three of them and began, “You are aware that Mrs. Malfoy imparted a certain coin to me?” all Malfoy heads nodded, “Not only did she gift me with a way back to a safe place, but with knowledge that I had not previously been aware of with or without my Augur vision.  She gave me another gift,” Draco started to blush.  Harry understood that to mean he had not said anything, “This gift allows me an opportunity to help your family in a plan that makes sense, but I do not manipulate people.  I want your input and your suggestions.” Each stared at him intently, eyes not moving, “Your son was waiting for me on the other end of that coin.”
“I need to talk to you Aunt Petunia.  Away from Uncle Vernon.” Harry said, emphasizing the word ‘away’.
Mr. Malfoy looked down at the small coin.  The significance was not lost on him, one Augur created a coin for safety and love, and another for communication and safety.  He did not suspect the boy to understand the significance in that moment, but looking at his wife, she too understood.  Gifted magical coins were a sign of trust.  It would be up to them to maintain the value of loyalty that lay in that coin.
“I am no longer a young innocent boy, headmaster.  I do not have to act as one at all times, but being a part of these meetings could be crucial.” Harry impressed.
“Someone was killed, you almost did it, but in the end, someone else carried out Voldemort’s request.” Harry replied.
“This is a gift bestowed by our family when a great service has been rendered, each adult carries one and only one and it is passed down if never gifted. The coin is special, it is charmed to take the person gifted, to their other half, or in absence of that a safe place.” Draco whispered, his eyes dropped their hold.
Everyone took the moment to close their eyes and think.  Ginny was the first to try, and a slight white wisp appeared.  Hermione was the very first to succeed, her otter patronus wound its way through the group.  Draco looked at Harry, closed his eyes, and cast his charm.
“Expecto Patronum”, The potions master cast his patronus, “Something is seriously wrong with Harry Potter, Come Quickly.” And the silver doe was gone. Severus carried Harry through the halls, and towards the hospital wing. All the while wondering what had gone wrong, the boy did not feel feverish, nor was his body shaking. He did not detect any magical signatures to signify a curse or jinx or other nonsense. Pomfrey would have a time with this one.
“Madam, I don’t care what makes the Minister happy. If you don’t work with me, you work against me, and this time around, you will not get very far. Do we understand each other Madam?” Harry stood his ground, though he was just a bit taller, it was his eyes that pierced her, causing her to nod. “Good.”
Her son’s face with tinged with red, forehead creased and his silver eyes were blazing when he turned back to her.  She watched his face fall into concern when he looked at her.
“In my Vision, my mother left my Aunt a vault and a property to go to her in case she divorced. In her letter, My Aunt mentioned it had been going on for years. I think I could get Severus to help with Veritaserum and find out… Possibly… I am not sure how I could convince my Aunt to work with us… Though it seems they are the target of Voldemort’s revenge against me.” Harry said.
Aberforth and the Headmaster invited Harry to a few of their get-togethers in Hogsmeade. It was usually full of good-natured talk over students, news the Prophet was printing and such. Harry enjoyed their company, but he was beginning to wonder if his news after his task would be welcome...
She was watching, the movements she knew well, but she had never cast one.  Only Aurors could, that was one of the spells they kept to themselves.  This professor always left her with more questions.
Lucius thought about that, separation from his wife was not something he took lightly.  Nor was the fact that the now public friendship going to cause a stir in the Dark Lord’s ranks.
Harry waited for most of the students to stream out of the Great Hall and managed to fall in with the crowd unnoticed. He broke away to go towards the dungeons and his detention with Professor Snape.
The first student dropped in, holding onto their invitation.  It was Draco Malfoy.  He looked around the empty room then back at Harry and smiled.
Draco gazed up into green fire, and let the bliss of living sweep over him as he released shouting, "YOURS!"
Everything was cut off as Lucius obviously broke the connection. Harry breathed again… he turned away from the questioning look of Draco and vomited. He was still heaving when he felt Draco’s hands on his back, trying to soothe him. Harry used his wand to clean everything. He turned to look at Draco. His eyes were startling to Draco. Fear, Anger and Revulsion were all there written in emerald.
“That was Mr. Malfoy, not Draco.  If you treat Draco as if he were his father, what makes you any more different than Professor Snape with how he treats us because he was terrorized by Gryffindors while he was in school?  And Professor Snape is working on it, now that it has been mentioned we are not them.” Harry cajoled.
Sirius had a bit of difficulty with the request, but after Harry explained that it was significant to his Augur task, Sirius relented.
Ron’s face turned as red as a tomato, Hermione choked on the drink she had been sipping, and Seamus just started doubling over in laughter.  At least someone go the joke.
It took Draco a while to let all of their conversation sink in.  He had walked Harry back to his dorms.  Harry’s friends met them in the corridor.  So much was left to know, and he knew Harry had not revealed everything, only certain parts that had disturbed him, and parts that revealed his reasons for helping the Malfoy family.  Draco was surprised at the revelation.  His mother, must have been in a state of worry, the fighting must have been bad if she had gone against the Dark Lord.
