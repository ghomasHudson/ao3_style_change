He carefully led Harry out into the hall and down the stairs until they were standing in front of where the portrait used to hang. He swiftly took the blindfold off, and stood back as Harry blinked a few times and took in the doorway.
Draco gripped Harry’s hand at that, giving him a piercing look.  “What,” he hissed.
They were right.  It was barely dawn when a gangly ten-year-old jumped into the middle of their bed.
“Absolutely,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand and giving the back of it a kiss.  “Let’s go.”
He shook himself, and turned to Ron.
The two men who sat opposite her knew better than to tell her that she didn’t have to go to so much trouble, and obediently took a few sandwiches and cakes each.  Harry looked down at his hot chocolate and saw that Molly had made the marshmallows look like little snowmen.  He was sure she had some on hand because Victoire, Bill and Fleur’s daughter, was over all of the time.
“Shhh.  I know, love.  I just want to look at you for a moment.  Gods.  How did you sit through dinner, talking about all that nonsense?”  He traced the rim of the base, ghosting his finger against the skin around it.  He lightly pushed on the base, making it press in a touch more, making Draco howl.
“Show off,” Draco smiled.
“It’ll be okay.  We’ll figure it out.”
“I know, but I love how polished you look everyday.  Makes me all hot and bothered to see you like that.”
Harry took that moment of hesitation to flip them.  He straddled Draco’s waist, taking off his own shirt.  He rubbed his hands up and down Draco’s chest, pinching his nipples.  This caused Draco to moan louder.  Harry could feel his pants getting tighter by the second.
They stared at each other for long moments.   Draco watched as Harry’s adams apple moved as he took a gulp of the firewhiskey.  He tried to think of something to say in order to defuse the tension in the room, but he couldn’t think of where to start.  He took a sip of his own drink, hoping that it would loosen his vocal cords, but they continued to sit there in silence.
“I want to, more than anything,” Draco said, gripping Harry’s hand.
Hermione opened hers to find a photo of herself, Ron, and Harry, sitting down by the lake, laughing at something.  They looked so carefree and, Harry thought when he first saw it, like what normal teenagers were supposed to look.
“If you would, may I ask that you both accompany me to Grimmauld to speak with Harry?  I’m sure he wouldn’t mind the intrusion, and then we may all hopefully understand a bit more of what occurred that night.”
It was a drawing of a giant red heart with ‘Harry + Draco’ written in green in the middle, and ‘Congradulashons!!’ written at the bottom, with the signature.  He sat staring at the picture for a few more moments, before standing and placing the picture on the refrigerator that was in the corner.
“Well, we’re going to provide food and drinks, and a special surprise, so they don’t need to worry about anything else, right?”
Harry walked over to the counter as he said, “Of course I did!  You’re my mate.  I couldn’t let your birthday just slip by again!”
in said war.  And yet, I didn’t feel the need to see a Healer.  But now… I needed to be able to talk to someone about what has been going on.
Harry sighed once more as he opened his door, slid his cloak off, and tossed it on his empty chair.
Draco started to interrupt, but Harry spoke over him.  “I am.  When you left me, sitting on my bed, I was hurt more than angry.”
Harry took a deep breath, steeling himself.
Smiling, Harry turned back.  “So, yeah, that's that.”  Draco squeezed his hand tight, before letting him go.  Harry turned and sat back down.
Draco went back in for another kiss.  After a few more minutes, Harry took a half-step back, and Draco grudgingly did the same.  “I should go.”
“I’m free!” she said, holding up three fingers.
“Harry! Are you here?” He realized it was Hermione yelling, as she walked out of the floo.
Harry could see out of the corner of his eye that several of his classmates had wondered the same thing.  He took a quick glance over at Ron and Hermione, both of whom were giving him determined looks.
They worked in silence for several minutes.  “Okay!  I think we’ve got everyone!”
“I love that little girl,” Harry said quietly.
Everyone raised their glasses, toasting each other, and then started counting down from ten.
“Harry!  What a pleasant surprise!”
“Didn’t think I needed to.  Didn’t know you’d be off.  Why are you off?”
“I’ll try.  I love you, too.”
Draco tried to plaster a smile onto his face, but was sure it came off more of a grimace.  “Nothing.”
The two chatted as Ron led the way towards the shop.  As they approached, Harry saw that it was named
Harry pulled back, making Draco groan in frustration.
A friendship had formed, that continued to grow until Draco’s 21
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s back, and Draco curled into his side.
“I’m sure you’ll be
“I’m sorry ma’am, we are out of stock of the new trick brooms.  We will not be getting a new shipment in until next Monday.”
Malfoy just made a noise of acknowledgement, and rubbed slightly at his shoulder.
“It all makes sense now,” Kingsley said as he sat back down.  “Alright, I understand.  Looks like we’re going to need to push our recruiting at Hogwarts again.  Mind if you’re on the team for that?  All of my top Aurors are starting families!  I’ll let Robards know.  Again, congratulations, Harry.”
“Everything alright?” Harry asked as Draco stepped between Harry and Blaise.
“You okay, mate?”  Ron looked sideways at him as they ascended the stairs.
“Well, the auror’s got a tip from the shopkeeper at the bookstore just inside Knockturn that they had just received a donation of a large collection from an old pureblood family,” Ron said.  “He said he didn’t want any trouble, and so asked if a couple of deputies could come and take a look, which surprised us all.
“Like I need to puff out my chest, and bang my fists, or something,” Harry laughed.
They tucked him in, and then he reached up both his hands, and Harry leant over to give him a hug and a kiss on the forehead.  Draco did the same, and retucked the blanket around him before turning off the light and stepping out in the hall.
Draco sighed, but said, “I don’t know.  It just kind of felt like the burning sensation that I felt when you gave me my wand back.”
The both gave him one more smack on each of his cheeks, and then set him back on the ground.
Draco leant up to give Harry a languid kiss on the lips.  “That sounds perfect.  Hold that thought just a moment, though; I really need to use the loo.”
Attaching his lips back on Draco’s, Harry continued to thrust up against him.  Draco’s hands were locked in Harry’s hair, pulling his mouth forcibly against Draco’s.
The house was loud chaos, as it always was, but they were all greeted warmly by Molly, who gave Narcissa an extra hug when she noticed her, and then shoo’d them off into the living room.  Harry and Draco took their bags up to Ron’s old room, where they would be staying for the night.  The room had been magicked larger, after all these years, and now had three large beds placed in it, as well as a crib.
“And are you now saying that
It was after midnight when the last person left.  Kreacher had already cleaned up the food and drinks, and moved everything else down to the kitchen, so as soon as they said goodnight to Pansy, they both turned and went up the stairs to the bedroom.
“It’s been a long time since I’ve—”
He sighed as he cast a tent into place.  He missed those days, if he were being honest with himself.  He missed his Harry.
Harry smiled, thinking to himself, There’s the bossy Malfoy I know and love.
“Well…”  Harry rubbed the back of his neck.  “I may have cheated a little.”
“Ron.  And no, no one is sitting there.”
Harry could hear the catch in his throat, and the tears that were threatening to pool up in his eyes. He sat back into the corner of the couch, and pulled Draco down to lay in between his legs and the back of the sofa, resting his head on Harry’s chest.
“Keep your fucking voice down! Draco and I—”
on your wall,” he said, pointing at the posters of the half-naked biker girls that Sirius had put up to annoy his parents.  Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
“Thanks, mate,” Bill said, gently escorting his wife into the lounge.
“What’s up, Ted?”  He pet Teddy’s hair, as the little boy looked up at his godfather.
“Indeed.”
He barely made it to the door when the floo flared up, emitting Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville, one-by-one.
They all gathered in the lounge, hugging and talking over one another.  Lucius looked like he wished he was anywhere else, but was pulled into a conversation by Blaise, and soon looked like he was at least moderately enjoying himself.
“What do we need to bring, Harry?”  Hannah asked, shyly.
“So, you write, and I’ll text?”
“What did he say?” Hermione asked as she and Ron sat on the bed, facing him.
Harry hesitated a moment before he sighed and said, “I’m engaged to be married.”
“Hey,” he quietly said, smile growing as Harry whipped around with a spatula in his hand.
Draco rolled his eyes, but as soon as he turned back around, Harry could see his shoulders shuddering, clear indication that he was laughing.  He took Draco’s hand, nudging his shoulder, and they went down to the study together, where they had put all of the gifts.
“Oh. Well, yes, it does bring up some bad memories, but at the same time, it makes me remember better times, too. We did have some great times. Before Hogwarts, even. I know every thinks they were just my ‘minions’ or my ‘bodyguards,’ but they were my best friends for years.”
“Hmmm.  I mean, what about neither.  We both know it wouldn’t be on for long, anyway.”
“You all are adults, and I expect you all to act as such.  I was hoping that I could tell you all this whilst everyone was getting along, but apparently, that is just too much to ask for with you lot.”  She shook her head.  “As I said, you are adults.  This means you are here in school by your own free will.”
“How did Nana decorate?”
“I would like that very much.”  He leaned over and gave her a kiss on her cheek.  She smiled at him as she stepped towards the stairs.  She waved goodbye, as did Teddy, and they disappeared up the stairs.
“Hmmm.  Just how much?”  He slipped his hand out from under Harry’s and moved it towards the button of his jeans.
“I also found one called an Orgasm, and a shot called a Wet Pussy.”
“The day before the attack.”
Harry pulled off his ring, and saw that Draco had had it etched with “I love you more,” too.  He started laughing, both clutching each other as they leant in for another kiss.
“Kreacher can manage, sir.”
“We had tea on Friday, and we saw you both at Sunday dinner, but he seemed fine.  He was talking with George and Bill and laughing and cutting up at the kids,” Hermione said.  She looked at Ron.
They clutched at each other, crying into each other’s shoulders.
Draco hesitated for a split second as Harry entered the bright, clean room.  He took a breath, and moved to sit across from Harry at the table.
“Oh, good, you haven’t started cooking.”
Draco leaned over and whispered in Harry’s ear, “I think he either missed you, or is really excited about hosting a festive party.  I’m thinking both, though.”
“Well, your girlfriend will be arriving this evening.  It’s been a few days since you’ve seen her.  I just presumed.”
“I’m sorry,” she said.  “I realize that I may have gone a bit mad, but I wanted your wedding day to be perfect.”
~*~*~*~*~
Standing there, Harry quickly took in the man before him.  Draco had dark circles under his eyes.  He looked even paler than usual, and his eyes held no light in them.  He was wearing a white button-up shirt and the jeans that Harry had convinced him to purchase.  Harry wanted to hex himself when his insides began to squirm with desire.
Everyone looked at each other before shrugging and mumbling I don’t know’s.
Happy Christmas!  I hope you all liked the idea of the photos!  I've always felt that Dennis would have shown Harry the hundreds of photos that had to have been in Colin's room.  I love the idea of it.
“Well?”
Teddy carefully got off of the chair, and then skipped to Draco’s side, taking the juice from him.  Draco walked over to Harry, slipping his arms around his waist and kissing his neck.  “Morning.”
“Please, talk to me.  Are you alright?”
Draco laughed.  “It would be a bit difficult to try and teach you that in one evening, but I can teach you a couple of things.”  He suddenly felt arms wrap around his middle and felt Harry’s breath against his ear.
Kreacher seemed to perk up at the thought of entertaining.  “Why did master not call Kreacher back sooner?  Kreacher would have had everything already done.”
“I also don’t want to even think about the report from Gringott’s telling us how little gold we have left, now.”
“Yes, but they can just wait a few minutes more.”  He smiled, as he tugged Harry up to their room.
“I’m fine,” he said, just as another shot of pain went through him.  He winced.
Harry was awoken again a couple of hours later by Kreacher apparating into his room to tell him Draco had arrived.  Looking over at the clock again, he saw that Draco was early.
Harry sighed, turning back around and pulling Draco’s hands around his stomach.  He caressed Draco’s legs lightly.  They lay there for several more minutes, both in their own heads.
Harry nodded, removing his hand and walked over to where the women stood, searching out one face.  He stuck out his hand at Parkinson, saying “Truce?”
Harry sighed, letting his mind wander as he turned on the telly.
Draco chuckled as he pulled out his wand and gripped Teddy’s right hand, Harry taking his left.  Draco tapped the wall, and the bricks moved to reveal the bustling Diagon Alley.
“Coming right up.”
Harry got up off the bed, walking around to the side table and opened the drawer.  He pulled out a bottle of lube and a toy, which caused Draco’s cock to twitch, and a drop of pre-come to form on the head.
Draco quickly looked back up at the woman, shaking his head, saying, “Pardon me.  You see… well, when Harry returned my wand...we believe it may have caused us to form a—a link?  I truly have no idea what it all means, but I believe that Harry needs to be a part of this conversation.  He has a bit more knowledge on the subject, if I’m being honest.”
Kreacher, having somewhat gotten used to the witch, bowed his head stiffly, and moved back into his nest.
Harry turned to say something to Draco, but stopped when he saw the tinge of pink on the blond’s cheeks and the dumbfounded look on his face.  “What’s wrong?”
“And you have mine.  Completely and irrevocably.  I love you.”
They looked at each other quickly before turning back to her and saying at the same time, “Absolutely not.”
Seeing the look on Draco’s face, his letter seemed to be about the same thing.  They looked up at each other and silently passed each other’s letters across to the other.
“Why?  Yes, he dumped you after you… yeah.  But, you still want to be with him, right?  So, just tell it to him straight.  Well, maybe not
Today's Prompt:
in my arms as we take a nap.”
They continued to hold hands as their waiter brought out their wine and salads.  Once their glasses had been filled, Harry raised a toast.
Harry kissed him deeply, replying, “Happy Christmas, Mr Malfoy-Potter.”
“The weekend of October 15
“Aren’t you? I just had to finish up some paperwork, and then I’m off until Monday.”
Ron and Hermione spoke at the same:
~*~*~
“Yes.  I believe mother discussed breakfast with her, so she should have it started.”
They smiled at her, and together they walked towards the large double doors.  Draco nodded to her, and she turned and with a flick of her wand, the doors opened.  They looked at each other once more, Draco gripping Harry’s fingers more tightly, and they followed her through the doors.
Draco caught it, back.  “I’m just worried what our families will say when they find out.”  Toss.
He turned on his side, laying his head on Draco’s chest.  “Why do we wait so long in between?”
Harry then told them about feeling a warmth when they would shake hands or bump into each other.
“I think it’s brilliant.  When is your office Christmas party, so I can give Bev a kiss?  I… if we do this, then we can literally do it whenever.  Forget May or June.  If we’re going to do this, why not Christmas Eve?”
On their first full day back, McGonagall had told them why she had requested them to arrive earlier than the other students.  Because their year had had the greatest impact on the war, she wanted each one to be a part in the restoration of the school.
“You mean there’s more?” Draco exclaimed.
Harry leaned against his shoulder, smirking. “Chose this one to remind you: I always win.”
“Exactly.  I…”  Toss.
“—be you could next…  Wait, really?”
“That’s an even easier problem to solve.”  She saw the even more confused look on Harry’s face, and huffed.  “Elope.”
“Stotts says I won’t have to speak at all.  As they’ve all pled guilty, they will receive their sentence, and we will be free to go.  I won’t have to speak!”  Harry could see how relieved he was with what had transpired.
to hang around her neck.  She’ll love it because it came from
“All I want for Christmas is you, naked, in our bed, and us having boring, married-life sex.”
With everyone watching, Lucius made his way up to Draco.  Harry held his breath as he took Draco’s hand and looked at the ring on his son’s finger.  He then pulled Draco into a quick hug and then turned and gripped Harry’s hand.  “Congratulations.”
Draco stood and walked towards the door, but stopped when he saw that Harry was still standing near the closet door.  Draco turned to him, giving him a questioning look.  “What?”
Harry had never skated before, but had seen it on the telly, so he kind of knew what to do.  Draco didn’t have the first clue, so took direction from Harry.  It didn’t take long until they were slicing across the ice, with Teddy in the middle.
The blush that appeared on Ron’s face had nothing to do with the winter air that swept by their table as several people came through the door.  “Well, er, you see…”  He smiled weakly at Harry, as he sat back down at the table.  Harry sat down across from him.  “I wanted to get Hermione a necklace, and I knew that if I bought it in Diagon, somehow, some way, it would get back to her, and I really want it to be a surprise.”
“Well, we need to finish this conversation at some point, and I’d prefer to do it sooner, rather than later.  I’m sure we can find someplace to talk.  Besides, I figured you might want to see Nott and Goyle,” he added with a shrug.
Just then, Professor Flitwick told the class about their essay that was due next class, and dismissed them.  Harry and Draco quickly put their things in their bags, and then walked side-by-side out into the corridor, where they both began laughing again.
He started pumping his cock into his hand, rubbing his thumb on the head each time Draco hit his prostate.
Draco sat up, causing Harry to have to grapple for the cushion so as to stay on the couch.  “What?”
Ron, Hermione, and Susan were working on a statue that was to be placed on the road, just after the Quidditch pitch.  Hermione told Harry that it was to have every name of the people that had been killed under Voldemort’s rein of horror, which included the first war; James and Lily Potter’s names would be on it.
“But, it’s Tuesday.”
“Well, honestly, when they first questioned me, I wasn’t sure it had actually happened.  I thought it was probably my imagination, or something.  It was days later, after going over it and over it, that I considered that maybe it actually did happen.”
Harry just shook his head as Hermione whispered something in Ron’s ear.  They did have compatible magic; he knew that for sure.  He had thought that they themselves were compatible, but he must have been mistaken.
He turned to Ron and Hermione, who were both looking at him with small smiles, eyes glistening.  “Are you serious?”
Teddy skipped out of the room, as Harry and Draco slumped back down in the bed at the same time.
He took the steps back up to the bedroom two at a time.  He walked back in and saw that Draco was exactly where he had left him.
Harry frowned as he walked out of the kitchen.  He tried to read between the lines of what Molly had just said.  He shook his head, heading up to his bedroom to finish wrapping presents.
At the mention of Draco, Harry perked up and stood to receive the letter.  He quickly read it, grin splitting his face.
“Sounds like the perfect plan, to me,” Harry said with a smile.  “Come on, we should probably get some sleep.  We all know Teddy won’t let us have a lie-in.”  He crawled into the large bed, pulling Draco into his arms.  “Goodnight, love.”
“I, er, I brought you lunch.  If you want?  And, er, I was hoping that we could talk?  I know you’re busy, but please?”  He offered one of the cups to Draco.
Draco looked completely gobsmacked as Harry continued.
“Ugh, I suppose.”  He stood up, pulling Draco up with him.
“But, it’s Wednesday!  Why in the here would they have a party in the middle of the week?”
Harry chuckled as he stood and went to his desk.  “Well, you do look mighty sexy with knitting needles in your hands.”
Malfoy looked a bit shocked, but took the parchment, read it a few times, and handed it back to Harry.
His fingers brushed against his bollocks, and Draco let out the most beautiful noise Harry had ever heard.
Ginny’s was taken during her stint as the Gryffindor Seeker, while Harry was banned in fifth year.  She made a sweeping flip, grin wide and hair flapping the wind, just before grabbing the Snitch.
“Why didn't you tell Dumbledore? Or McGonagall,” Millicent asked.
“No! Not at all!  Just have to finish the paperwork from the mission, and then I’m free for the rest of the day, actually, but I can put that off for a few.”
He lifted up his shoulder in a shrug.
“He just turned six months, the other day.”
“We’ll be there, and I’ll make sure they’re dressed and ready to go,” Hermione said with a smile and a nod.
Releasing Harry enough so that he could look him in the eyes, Draco asked, “Why is that?  Why didn’t you leave me?  You had the opportunity to get rid of me for good, and you didn’t do it.  Why not?”
He sent the packages back up to the shelf in the closet.  He sighed, rubbing his eyes under his glasses.
“After, he suddenly jumped up and said that we couldn’t be together anymore.  He gave me no real reason, just saying that he was tainted, and it could never work because he was a Death Eater, and I was Harry Potter.  Then he left.  The whole conversation lasted less than five minutes.”
“What happened?” Draco garbled, trying to sit up in the bed so he could see Harry better, but only managing a wince as pain shot through him.
“Come on! Come for me, love!”
The men each went a different way, and began walking around the store.  Harry was looking at side tables, finding some lovely ones made from mahogany.  He was walking around a bench, when he heard a “Hey, Po—Harry, come here.”
“That night, everything changed for me.  Literally, I died.  After that, nothing really mattered.  I honestly don’t even know how I got through the summer.  Every day, there was some reporter asking questions, or Kingsley owling me about joining the Auror’s, and then I had to sit through the trials.”
Ron and Hermione, who had both blushed when Harry spoke of sex, paled just as quickly when he mentioned death.
“Just a sec.”  Harry ran back up to his bedroom, grabbing the jumper that he had pulled out of his closet earlier.  Slipping it on, he patted his pockets to make sure he had everything.  Stepping back down to the second floor landing and moving into the sitting room to lock that floo, he had a thought.
“You can’t fall asleep on me, love.  It was your idea to write these invitations in the bath.”
He just shrugged his shoulders.  “Is breakfast ready?  I’m hungry.”
“Thanks.”  Harry poked Ginny on the shoulder as he passed her on the way to the stairs, nicking a piece of toast off her plate in the process, too.  He laughed as she swatted at him, so glad that they could be friends and joke around with each other.
Harry took another gulp of the amber liquid, and realized he was definitely starting to feel the effects.  His limbs were looser, and he felt as if he was beginning to float.
we could go to the Burrow.”
Draco looked down at the child in his arms, shrugging.  “I’ve got him.  No big deal.”
“Well, like Malfoy.”
Grabbing for his wand, he made sure his curtains were completely closed, and then cast a couple of spells so no could know what he was up to.  Slowly turning over, he pulled down his pajama pants, noting the wet spot that adorned the front of them.  His fully erect penis sprang up, slapping against his stomach.  His arousal was heady.  Carefully, he gripped his cock tightly.
Draco glared at the back of Harry’s head, as he watched his best mate walk out of their room.
Draco gave him a peck on the nose and stood up.  “You’ll see.”
The two of them were busy cleaning out the closet when Hermione came up with three cups of tea floating behind her.
Draco and Harry again looked at each other, trying to remember such events.  Harry turned and looked at their professor, saying, “A few times, when we shook hands, or nudged up against each other, there was a warmth in that extremity, but not as intense as the first time.”
“Sounds good!  See ya later, mate!”
“So, we decided to have pancakes for breakfast, before we go make a snowman!”  Teddy bent his knees in a mock hop, gripping the back of the chair.
Malfoy flicked his wand and conjured a small red and green marble.  With his Seeker reflexes, he grabbed the orb out of the air before it even had an inkling of falling to the ground.  Turning away from Harry, he shot red sparks into the air, and then transfigured one of the chairs in the room into a kettle.
They picked up their portkey, a small plastic keychain, and before they knew it, they were back in their living room.
After a few moments, Harry bucked his hips, and Draco took the hint, sliding out until just the tip remained, and then thrusting full stop back in.
“Why would you say that?”
Draco laughed, pointing forward.  “This way, come on.”  He started walking towards the back part of the field, Teddy right beside him asking continuous questions, and Harry trailing behind them.  When they made it to the rink, they all gasped in unison.
Harry took a deep breath and walked forward so that he was leaning directly over Albus Dumbledore’s head.  “Hello, sir,” he whispered.  “I believe this belongs here with you.”
He pulled on the jeans that he wore the day before, and summoned a shirt from the closet.  As he headed down to Teddy’s room, he heard the boy babbling.  Walking in, he wasn’t surprised to see his godson sitting up, playing with his lion.
They ate their supper, asking Teddy questions and talking about Christmas at the Burrow.  Teddy helped them clean up the kitchen once they were done, and then they decided to go up to the lounge.
He relished in the overwhelming feeling of joy that overtook him as he realized that he had slept with Draco.  Just as suddenly as that feeling of joy filled him, it was gone, and replaced with a feeling of confusion.  What had prompted Draco to come in in the middle of the night?  And it had been the middle of the night, because as Harry looked over at his clock sitting on the side table, he saw that it was only 5:30.  This made him think that Draco had come in around midnight, because he had gone to bed early, being exhausted from finishing the kitchen the night before.
“Malfoy.”
close.  “Come on, baby.  Come for me.”
“Fuck,” he whispered again, as his heart started slowing down to a normal beat.  He laid there, staring at the ceiling, as he brain started reliving the nightmare he’d just awoken from.
“What?!  Get off me!  Why?”
Harry’s face was completely red from exertion.  He knew he had been yelling quite loudly towards the end of that speech, but he didn’t care, either.  He had to make them see that they had to stick together in the aftermath of such tragedy.  He gave them a look, then said a bit calmer, “How are you not tired of all the hate?  I know I am.  It has seeped into my soul, and I just don’t want it to be a part of me anymore.  I’m done.  We need to stick together; if we continue with this ‘us and them’ nonsense, what’s to stop someone else from becoming a new Voldemort?”  He then turned and walked swiftly out of the door.
“Oh, Draco!”  Harry stepped back and moved to the foot of the bed so that Narcissa could come stand near Draco’s head.  “Darling, what happened?”
“Muggles are so silly,” Teddy said, still laughing.
The real thing was absolutely nowhere near Harry’s imagination.  Draco’s lips were unbelievably smooth.  He could taste a hint of wine on his tongue when it was thrust into his open mouth.  This caused Harry to moan, as he wrapped his arms around Draco, left hand gripping the blond’s left hip, and the fingers of his right, running through Draco’s soft, soft hair.
He heard voices coming from across the hall, so he walked over and peered in the doorway.  He could see several of his classmates—current and past—sitting around the large room, talking.
Harry was still laying in the middle of the couch, biscuit still in his hand.  Draco could feel his face redden in anger more by the second.  Seriously, love-of-his-life or not, he was going to kill him.
“And no worse off, sans a few sleepless nights, I might add.  But, I was told to pop by and alleviate any fears you may have had to the contrary.”
“Before dinner begins, I wanted to tell you that I am aware of what occurred in the common room.  Because of this, I want to make sure you understand: any wrong doings against a fellow student will result in a swift expulsion.  There will be a zero tolerance.  Do I make myself clear?”
“We will,” was recited in unison.
“Master Harry,” the old elf replied, bowing slightly.
“Oh, I'll still get my dessert.  But,” Harry said with a smirk, as he leaned up to bite Draco’s bottom lip, “it won't be ice cream that I'll be eating.”
“Good morning, mother; Professor.  To what do we owe this honour?”  He moved to his seat at the head of the table, sitting down.  While his father was away, he was the man of the house, and so sat accordingly.
“Happy New Year, darling!” Pansy said, coming forward to kiss Harry’s cheek.  He didn't know if he'd ever get used to being this close with the woman, but he realized he didn't mind it.  “We figured we’d just apparate, as Theo’s floo isn't connected.  Is Greg here?  He’s not much a fan of apparition, so he floo’d from mine, while we went to Theo’s. ”
There was a banging on the door, Andromeda looked from the screaming Teddy to the door, before swaddling the very distraught baby, and going to open the door. Teddy nearly got hit in the head with a hammer, but quick reflexes had her shifting her body so the hammer hit her in the opposite shoulder instead.
I learned my first lesson about being the Malfoy heir. I had to succeed by all costs. My grades were excellent, but I had failed by not making the Slytherin team. Forget the fact that First years were not allowed to have their own brooms, or try out for their House teams. If Harry Potter could do it, then so could a Malfoy. And Malfoy's could and would do it better.
Inheritance: The Complete Guide is a handbook created for the explicit purpose of explaining the manifestation of a Creatures’ inheritance and one's secondary gender. The handbook will answers all questions regarding the history, laws, anatomy, and behaviorism of the secondary gender. The handbook begins with a brief history of the fertility drop, the hypothesized theories behind it, and the need for change.

"THIRTY-SIX, BUT LAST YEAR...LAST YEAR I GOT THIRTY-SEVEN!" He shouted.
And with a final brick shoved back into place, the chieftess goblin disappeared behind a wall of solid brick.
Their alpha line included an array of products; lotions, soaps, patches, balms, and aerosols. This particular brand of scent blockers will not completely mask his alpha scent or make him nose-blind to the world like other inferior brands do, but instead neutralized his heavier alpha pheromones and allowed some of his natural scents through. The advantage of this is it allows for other alphas or omegas to identify him as such, without his pheromones overwhelming their senses.
Harry would have never thought he took advantage of having a cupboard to sleep in each night. At least it kept him out of the cold wind and damp mornings. Finding shelter at night was getting harder to find. He didn't have enough money to pay for room and board somewhere, and he frugal with the money he pilfered from his Aunt Petunia's purse. Harry found himself sleeping on park benches and in the shadow of stoops.
Harry knew he wasn't. One time at school, they served crab cakes and a kid, Liam was allergic. He had a silver bracelet on his wrist that said so. Liam gave him his portion. It was the most belly filling meal he had at school. Then Dudley and Pier forced Liam to eat one, and his whole face swelled up and he was run to the hospital. The school never served them again, they also banned strawberries and peanut butter.
“Boys boys. Stop this patterning at once, we do not have time for your flirting.” Andromeda said. “The sun will arise soon and we must prepare, now Cissy, you know the spell best.” She gestured towards the two boys.
“Why? Mr. and Mrs. Weasley didn’t teach their children such things. Ron couldn’t perform spells before Hogwarts, and Mrs. Weasley was the one who insisted on no magic.”
You are all so amazing and supportive. I am nearly to 1K subscribers.
Narcissa shared a look with her brunette sister. “Do you think we should try the counter-curse for the
When you call my name it's like a little prayer
Hari reached out his trembling hand to grasp the pale willow wand, two delicately strands twined around each other in an intimate dance. Hari felt the wood vibrate between his fingertips, and his magic hummed just beneath the surface of his skin.  “Spectacular!” Hari mumbled, giving the wand a quick flick sending whimsical bubbles in a rainbow of colors from its tips.
That night Hari dreamt he was walking down a dark hallway with the only source of light guiding him, a sliver of silver light spilling from the door frame in the distance.  As he walked the walls convexed outward, the ceiling shrank, and that beacon of light at the end of the hall stayed just out of reach.
Harry dug in with gusto; the croissant was buttery, the cheese hot, and the sausage smokey. He finished his in three bites, and he reached for a second, but Nik only pulled it out of reach and towards himself, his own cup of tea still in hand.
At first Draco was awkward as he speared his hand into the open end of the puppets body. He found himself apologizing to the ridiculous thing. He glanced uneasily across at Hari who looked on expectedly. “Okay Potter, what am I supposed to do now?”
, what once had been a grand entranceway, high ceilings décor with carved wooden serpents, complete with an overhead chandelier, but came into disrepair after the death of Walburga Black, leaving a poor and dusty echo of what was once the proud ancestral home to the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black.
“Avada Kedavra!” The first killing curse shoots out of the Hawthorn wand for Harry as it couldn’t do for Draco, unwilling to step over that last line into darkness. The green stream bounces off the mirror behind Kreacher’s head, comes hurling back towards Harry, narrowly missing him, but hits the portrait of Mrs. Black, and the frame falls off the wall blessingly silent.
"And whom might you be?" Draco asked the stranger who presumed to know him. The man wore Muggle clothes, tailored slacks and vest with his white sleeves rolled up quarter sleeve to reveal and expensive looking time piece and muscular forearms. Considering he himself was wearing woman's clothing, the fact the man wore Muggle clothes in the Muggle World, meant nothing. There was no telling if this was a wizard, a reporter, or simply a man justifiably thinking he was a Muggle hating Death Eater.
He was in the study that he did know, and he knew that his migraine must be from Kreacher's lesson on different types of Spirits. If Kreacher's idea was to raise Harry's spirits, then they have certainly crashed now.
... Draco thought, glancing at Hari's slim figure.
She knew Magical children didn't always mix well with Muggles. She knew that not all Muggle-born children responded to their letters and when someone from faculty went to investigate, intervene, and hopefully extract the magical from muggle for their first year, sometimes--sometimes the children didn't make it.
“I told you, Potter it’s not a diary…” He paused in his rant when he saw Hari’s teasing smile. Huffing, he resumed searching. Hari just let Draco search. He obviously had something in mind from the amount of times Hari tried pulling shirts out only to hear Draco’s irritated, ‘not that one, the materials all wrong’, or ‘that color doesn’t suit your coloring.’
“What are you doing here, Death Eater scum?” One hostile witch snarled. She had a rather horrid red hair, perhaps a botched  hair color charm done on her, and rather unlike Hermione Granger before fourth year, didn’t bother getting her teeth magically shrunk. Draco sniffed, beta, he thought with a sneer in return.
With a happy nod, Harry skipped behind Trout as he made his way to the farmers market. He wanted onions, celery, mushrooms, and garlic. If he could get his hands on it, oregano, parsley, and thyme. It was going to be a feast. Harry never ate so fine as he did with Trout.
Draco’s alpha instincts came to the forefront instantaneously. Draco was just about to do something rash like yank Hari outside the door again, or rip the invisibility cloak off his shoulders and roar loud enough to cause an avalanche from here in the Alps. Taking a deep breath in, his mind not catching up with what his body was doing, when he looked at Hari’s face. Hari Potter was not enjoying the attention that Draco believed, but was frozen stiff, petrified. His alpha instincts went from fight to flight. He had to protect what was his, and the only way to do that was to get Hari out of that situation. Some part of his mind must have still been functioning, because instead of pulling Hari backwards and out the front door, he was carefully adding pressure to Hari’s lower back, pushing him forward, urging him to move forward to the back alley and the entrance to Diagon Alley. The small pressure at the base of Hari’s spine must have knocked him out of whatever trance was keeping him rooted to the spot, because he took a shaky step forward and then another. The people in front of Hari suddenly fell quiet, parting like the Red Sea allowing Hari to pass.
"What was that about?" He asks as he takes his hat off and sits at the now vacant bar stool.
That vase had sat in her living room for over five years, the only keepsake of her dead sister she allowed in the house. Now it was shattered at her feet in the wake of Lily's son's feet.
“How do you know all this?” Hari asked intrigued.
Narcissa cupped her son’s cheek, “Draco…mon petite, you became my life, my only love. I would do anything for you. I wanted so much to protect you from your father, from the war, from the Dar…Voldemort.” Narcissa voice came alive with passion as she raised her burning eyes to her son’s, gripping his face tight between trembling white fingers. She laughed wetly. “I put my hand on the chest of the boy you loved, I felt his heartbeat and I knew…I knew we would prevail.”
“There are so many Weasley children; there probably wasn’t a spare wand, and perhaps Molly used it as a way corral her brood of children.”
"No, Never mind that." Narcissa waved the answer away before the words could even form out of Hari's mouth.
“Love is it?” Narcissa asked, fainting surprise and hiding a smile. It was so obvious to the keen eye of a mother that her son was in love.
“No one can help me,” His whole body was shaking. “I can’t do it…I can’t…It won’t work…and unless I do it soon…he says he’ll kill me…” Draco was beginning to realize the severity of his commitment to the Dark Lord. If he didn’t kill Dumbledore soon, if he didn’t fix the Vanishing Cabinet, he was dead.
After the letter was read, Draco was stunned speechless. He had no words. He sat shackled by his wrists to the chair in the middle of the coliseum like chamber, with his mother also shackled by her wrists, and father completely chained from head to foot. The Wizengamot was abuzz with chatter after the letter was read. Never had he been so embarrassed in such a public setting for all the Wizarding World to bear witness. Never had he been so humbled. Why is it that only Harry Potter could bring out these feelings in him? Would one testimony against thousands be enough to save his mother and possibly himself?
Sitting on the edge of one corner, Draco plopped back diagonal across the bed. Arms spread wide he stretched out with a goofy un-Malfoy like grin on his face. Grabbing a pillow he rolled, burying his face into the soft cotton. Grabbing another, he stuffed it between his knees. Face flushed, breath panting, and eyes dark with desire and hooded, he moaned out Hari’s name.

The sound of muffled snarls and crashing glass from the bathroom halted Hari in his tracks.
"You...no.  I can't... I can't sing. They'll laugh me off stage." Hari paled.
“Start in Dray’s room. He hasn’t been out in there in days.” Hari said, not turning from the stovetop. Draco flushed scarlet once more. Hari was going to turn him into a Gryffindor with the amount of red that stains his cheeks, or oh Salazar forbids,
I will admit that I am not always diligent in my writing, but classes are more time consuming than I thought. Before I knew it, all this time has passed without me writing. I think I am becoming obsessed with Harry bloody Potter. It's maddening. I know he is up to something with his two friends. Ever since the match with Hufflepuff in February, have I been improving my stealth of tracking
Sheryl loved to make an entrance.
Hari's hair was pleated in a double Dutch braid that framed his face like the hood of a cobra. On his brow sat a circuit of gold.
"Kreacher must serve Master Harry Potter, as last Master willed it. Besides all in prison, no family to serve and Manor to take care of once they’ve all be gone to Azkaban." Kreacher probably didn’t know he said that last bit out loud, the way he was mumbling it to himself, but old habits die hard, even with him being reborn a “new house elf” Kreacher was still the same in many ways.
"Anyway..." Hari answers. "As for what I've been doing...yeah renovating the townhouse has pretty much taken up much of my time." Hari says.
Confused now, Hari looked back at Draco and lost his breath at the sight.All Hari could think was,
Fighting back a sudden prickle of tears, she marched over to his crib. Taking the 15 month old beneath the armpits, and hosted the babe none too gently out of her son's crib.
He didn't even know his whole name before he entered primary school. Before then, he only answered to "Boy" or "Freak". Harry James Potter.
“Mon mère, what is it?” Draco asked in concern.
. And Draco was beautiful.
he thought as he watched Potter snap into action.
clothes from his bedroom floor, he slipped out the door and down the hall towards Draco's room. The door was closed tight and Hari hesitated outside the door. He noted the sliver of pale light beneath the door and decided to take a chance that the blonde was still awake. He gave three quick knuckled raps of the door and waited. There was no response. Deciding to just take a peek inside, Hari opened the door a crack and peered inside the room.
"Yes, yes." Sheryl clapped her hands impatiently and twisted her wrist to took at the time on the little oval surface. "If we don't call a cab soon, we'll miss the first rounds Karaoke on the sign in sheet."
In an uncharacteristic show of nerves, Narcissa wrung her hands. “You don’t understand the level of prejudice the Malfoy family held towards anyone with less than pure-blood. They came from a faction of purists that believed mixing with creature’s blood was an abomination to the wizarding race. They believed that it only tainted the wizarding blood more and that it was nothing more than bestiality.” She shuddered.   “They were monsters, hiding beneath a pretty face. And Half-breeds!” She growled out. “Such as half-giants, half-goblins, and others who had no control over their appearance since birth, were proof of the wrongness. And there I was, living among their tight nit social circles of elite pure-bloods, one of the things they despised more than Muggles.” Narcissa said with conviction in her voice, head nodding to everything she said, and angry tears running down her face.
+------
“DRACO! You're absolutely beautiful.” He yelled.
The walk up the aisle of goblins felt longer than the first trip he made at age eleven, and then a few months back, when he actually broke into Gringotts and stole an item from the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange.
Draco wearily followed and lowered himself to the floor. He sat first on his knees, but quickly ratified his position when he saw Hari adjust his legs to sit crisscross. Teddy was now sitting in the diamond formed between Hari’s knees. Hari rolled a rubber green ball with bumps all over it closer. He rolled it back and forth in front of Teddy. The baby tried to reach for the bright green thing, rolling in front of him.
Draco rubbed his nose into Hari's bare skin on his collarbone. "I always thought of it as a pretty tale Mother use to tell me as a child to explain our families creatures' blood. Hard to explain to a three or four year old that our family's blood had been experimented with. I don't know who, but with all the intrafamilial marriages, I wouldn't be surprised if one of my ancestors volunteered or was forced into it by a husband or father if the woman was perceived to be barren." Draco said as he continued his dragon's earlier motives of scenting Hari thoroughly.
“What’s next?” He asked around the frog in his throat.
"Prongslet! Wait!"
Draco gave Hari an odd look. "Some Black's don't tolerate spouses with creatures' blood unless they are beta. Like my fourth great uncle Sirius's line. There are no creature manifestation in that line. They are all beta, including your godfather."
"Hold the presses, is this news or is this news?" Blaise joked.
Together they spoke in unison, shouting tone heard over the sudden howl of wind, “Blood of my heart.” The red lines flared, and Hari felt the magic flood from his veins into Teddy’s and through Andromeda, then like the tide, washed back.
Petunia was humming as she prepared the final detail on the festive fruit cake to bring to her husband's office party for Christmas eve. She was dressed in a lovely cranberry button up blouse, and floral knee length skirt, stockings, and sensible heels. The only jewelry she wore was her wedding band, a pearl strung necklace, and matching earrings given to her by her husband on their last wedding anniversary.
Right as he said that, he felt a shift in the wards once more, not to different from when Kingsley tried to Floo in. The main difference being, they were invited in and the wards will automatically accept them. The reason he had Kingsley tell them the secret entrance was because Mad-Eye Moody's booby-trap was still at guard at the front door, and it was a pain. Bill Weasley said he'll come by in a few days and sort it out, he tried a number of things that same day he, Andromeda, and Teddy visited the bank. And wasn't that a trip all on its own. He now had access to his wizards gold at Gringotts and access to Muggle money he put in an account with Our Ally Banking, and he now had a London Driver's License, Passport, and fancy high end credit card with the names Hari J. Potter on them.
"How are you feeling, Dray?" Hari asked softly.
With an anguished scream, Harry pulled out the Hawthorn and Unicorn Hair wand that once belonged to Draco Malfoy and blew up the umbrella stand. Several portraits were also destroyed in the process, which caused Mrs. Black to scream louder. Somehow in all that chaos Harry was able to make out a small movement out of his peripheral vision.
Harry's body chilled. He recognized that silhouette he's been dodging them for days now. A police man was at the door, asking to be let in without the open sign on. Why?
I am taking a little break from SCES, while the other part of this series is put together between Q and I. I did say that was going to happen in my announcement months ago. Both of us have been very busy with life in general.
"Lock the door, Hari." Draco said. Hari pulled out his wand from his own invisible thigh sheath and locked the door from the inside, a few spells just to be safe.
“Blood of my life.” Hari croaked out. Misty red vines floated around his hand and up his arm, where Hari touched Teddy, they wrapped around his tiny body. For a moment he was afraid they would harm Teddy as they constricted off and on his own arms. But Teddy showed no signs of discomfort.
I have spent a lot of time contemplating my life circumstances. What would I change if I could? Would I make better choices to change the outcome of the war? What could I have done differently to save lives lost in the war? I've seen families torn apart by this war with family members choosing sides and becoming estranged from each other. I've seen all the worthless deaths and killings on both side, and am disgusted by how easily a life could end with a wave of a wand.
Hari smiles bashfully up at the tall blonde “I’m beginning to.” Nothing in his demeanor was faked and he wasn’t acting coy like that Muggle. This was, just Hari. Draco smiled back in return.
"What about I introduce you to a shelter, someone who can put in safely in a shelter, where no one would question you. There are so many homeless shelters since the 80's. Government's doing a piss poor job of the "Homeless Crisis" as they are called in the news.
Hari began to question his own intention with Draco. Perhaps he wasn’t being fair in agreeing to this date when he was so unsure of his feelings.
Why does that Weasel and Mud-blood always have to butt into other wizard’s business? I approached Potter, hoping to get him alone, to apologize for everything, and congratulate him on making Seeker. Harry is never just by himself.  So, I had an idea. I would openly challenge him to a duel, he’d accept and I would be able to apologize for my behavior in private. I Curse Father’s spies who make me keep up my pretense.
Draco sensed that something was wrong.  The small smile his mother graced him with was wrong, sad even. The scent she was letting off was overly sweet, like the smell of burning sugar.
Mrs. Malfoy went to Professor Snape in what she believed was a dire hour in her life. In June of 1995, after the Battle at the Department of Mysteries, Lucius Malfoy was captured and sent to Azkaban. In ire, Voldemort summoned what remained of his Death Eaters and conducted an initiation. Some of this information comes from the connection between our minds and the rest came from memories bestowed to me by Professor Snape. Draco Malfoy was given the Dark Mark and told to in order to finish his initiation he would have to kill Professor Albus Dumbledore before the end of term at all costs. It was presented to Draco Malfoy as a great honor, but Mrs. Malfoy saw the initiation for what it was, a punishment for his father’s failure, a death sentence.
“Oh, ha-ha.” Hari said sulkily. Getting down to the bottom of his soft-drink and rattled the ice sucking at air. Draco cringed slightly, the sound irritating his ears. To be honest this outdoor shopping centre as Hari called it, was very grating on all his senses.
Stay awesome!
Don't go to any public places (includes stores, schools, parks, libraries, etc) if you absolutely have to for risk of catching the virus and bringing it home to the more vulnerable. You can catch it and spread it without showing symptoms for 14 days.
Calculating Wizarding Currency:
Narcissa laughed. “Goodness no, we made it.” She sounded quite proud of herself.
It wasn’t easy, but Draco tried to steer the conversation  very difficult for Draco to keep his mouth shut, but he changed the subject. Reaching across the space between them to caress the feathers along the outside of the owl's facial disc near her hidden ears. “Do you have a name for this pretty girl?”
the leg-locking jinx, on. Well, actually I've been practicing it on Crabbe and Goyle with Blaise. (We are now on first name basis). It was hilarious to watch him bunny hop the Grand Staircase. It took him ages. I wish I had a camera to catch all on moving film.
His relatives never called him by his name, and talked about him like he wasn't even there. He was worse than the help, he was an indentured servant. His debt owed? Living in his relatives lavish broom cupboard, eating their splendid table scraps, and wearing Dudleys posh rags.
Draco looked apprehensively at Hari as he scurried across the street between cars, before turning towards his own path. He could see a block away, right where instructed, stood a dark tall figure leaning casually on a pole. As he approached his friends features came clearer into view. He was taller somehow than he remembered. He couldn't recall this detail at Crabbe and Goyle's funeral. But then again, he had other things on his mind back then.
He couldn’t be more happy right now. With a smile on his face he drifted off as well.

“Teddy…” Harry’s vision blurred and his mind went fuzzy and he heard what Kreacher was saying through a haze of fog.
As always,
Draco took the book back from Hari and flipped a few pages to the back. Almost like old families added births of children to an old bible, a list of names and letters were written in neat columns.  Draco pointed out a name at the top of the list. "Ursula Flint, the only known omega in the Black line through marriage, had five children, only omega to have her beat in amount of children born is Molly Prewett with seven children, all gingered and speckled." Draco laughed.
He thought.
With this growing pandemic, I've lost my job temporarily.
Draco laughed maliciously, stopping Sirius mid rant.
"Well then...Harry, call me Andromeda or Andra" When Harry went to open his mouth in protest Andromeda rolled right over him, "or we are back to surnames then, Mr. Potter."
Narcissa had not gone out into society since the wand excursion fiasco after being cleared of all charges by the wizengamot. They had rocks thrown at them for Salizar’s sake.
Try to hold a trace of what it was back then
Hari, ever modest says, “Well I didn’t even know the charms, and Kreacher had already started on the basement. We still need to clear the ground floor now that Dumbledore’s spectre is gone from the foyer. Whatever is down there, anyway?” Hari inquired.
The owl,
“You thought I didn’t? I am a teenager after all. I think about sex….” A too cold hand wrapped around Hari’s mouth to stop him from speaking any more.
The man only sighed long suffering, and pushed over a tray of sweetener. He then refilled Harry's cup and topped off his much larger one.
“That bastard! Those were mine, to be untouched. That goes against the prenuptial contract. The Goblins couldn’t have done that without written permission and my magical signiture.”
incantation to wake Draco up, when he began to stir. Draco mumbled something incoherently and pressed his body closer to Hari's. Hari's relief was short lived, as he realized that Draco was rubbing is hardening member against Hari's thigh provocatively. Hari felt the hard press of it against his thigh.
And so Kreacher began teaching Harry the finer things about Spirits, steadily getting him drunker and drunker, until Harry was collapsed over the bar, talking in a drunken slur and rambling. One arm was dangling off the edge, while the other was busy making imaginary designs on the wooden surface of the desk.
Andromeda herself, inched around the corner, out of sight of the commotion happening at her own doorstep. She had to see this gallant boy in action for herself.
Just a page lost in all its glory
Hari blinked out of the trance he was in, magic still singing in his blood. He looked down at Draco, brain trying to put two and two together in his head. Draco smirked up in satisfaction from his half reclined position. One elbow held his torso off the bed and the other kept Hari at a distance. Hari sat back sheepishly. He hadn’t realized he was crowding Draco.
“Oh, of course.  You—you are welcome any time,” Harry stammered.
“He told me about a ritual that would enable me to give back the wand, but told me there was a chance that I would still be able to use it.
“Good morning,” Draco said quietly.
Draco smiled as they wandered toward the apparition spot.  “And maybe we can bring Ted out this weekend and go skating?  I think he would love it.”
As the carriage started moving, Hermione asked Harry and Draco, who were sitting next to each other, “Do you two have plans for supper this evening?”
“Wait, what? I didn’t think you’d—”
“It’s my birfday!”
Harry had been so surprised by receiving a letter, he almost missed the fact that Draco, who was sitting across the table from him, received one, as well.  The envelope held the same seal as Harry’s.  When the other owl had disappeared, too, Draco looked up at Harry with a confused look.  Harry shrugged his shoulders and opened his letter.
“Whattimeisit?  Whatareyoudoinghere?”  He stretched his arms up towards the headboard, yawning loudly.  Draco could hear his bones popping.
Draco spluttered as he stared gobsmacked at her.  Well, lovely to know his friends spoke about him behind his back.
Another memory came back to him and, smiling, he reached under his pillow and brought out his Phoenix wand.  It warmed at his touch and he knew—everything was just as it should be.
Harry went to reach out for his hand again, but apparently thought better of it as his hand dropped into lap.
The best part of Harry’s laugh, though, was the look on his face.  Draco could remember the first time he saw Harry’s face when he was laughing; it was first year, in the Great Hall, during some feast.  He wouldn't admit it to anyone, but yes, he had watched Harry across the Hall just as often as Harry had watched him.  He could remember hearing this sound, echoing across the hall.  He looked over and saw Harry, head leant back, mouth wide open, laughing at something one of his friends said.  He leaned back over, huge smile on his face as he continued chuckling.
floor.
Draco took a step back, taking in Harry’s attire.  “Hmm, I love this shirt on you,” he said, running his hand down Harry’s chest.
“We will,” they recited as one.
At that moment, Draco was standing, and preparing to leave the hall.  Harry quickly told Orion to go back to the owlery, grabbed a piece of bacon for himself, and then followed Draco out into the entrance hall.
“Harry! There you are! I was wondering if you’d like to stand…” Wood, who had pushed through the crowd to talk to Harry, faded off as he took in Harry with his fingers laced through Draco’s.
“It’s lovely, Harry,” Hermione said.
“Honestly, Draco.  That is your kin.  I will admit, though, she doesn’t seem to have changed much from the last time I saw her.”
year.  They had talked through quite a few arguments over the years, all whilst tossing a quaffle.  The first time was in mid-February during their 8
“Yeah, you are.”
Leaning back, he saw the confused look on Draco’s face as the blond said, “That's it? That's all I get?”
Harry suddenly gripped Draco’s cock, stroking it in time with his thrusts.  “Come for me, love,” he grunted.  “Come with me!”
“He called me a ‘dirty Death Eater’ and told me that I deserved to die.
As his eyes cleared of sleep, he cast a glance around the room and finally realized what had woken him: there was a large, handsome-looking Horned Owl sitting on the window sill.  Harry quickly jumped up to let the bird in.  The owl hopped further inside, thrusting its leg out for Harry to un-attach its missive.
Walking past the gate out onto the lane, Harry turned around, yelling, “Not making any promises!” before turning on the spot and apparating to Grimmauld.
“Really, Ron.  It’s okay.  Yes, I wish I knew what the hell was going on in his head, but it’s Christmas, and I just want to enjoy the company of my family and friends.  Okay?”
“What are you talking about?”  Harry reached for Draco’s hand, but Draco just stepped away from Harry.
“How is it that you of all people are telling me to get with Malfoy?”
Draco continued to speak to Hermione, but Harry had stopped hearing what was being said, and was just watching Draco, instead.  He could see the sorrow etched in those grey eyes.  He was mystified by the man.  The more he stared at him, the more Harry realized how absolutely beautiful he was.  He had looked at him, sure, but never this close, and definitely not when Draco looked so sad and horrified at himself.
“Master Draco.”  Jissy, his mother’s house elf, stood beside his bed, looking up at him.  Draco blearily leaned over the edge of the bed to be able to look at the tiny creature.
Ollivander had given him specific instructions on how to do the transfer of powers, but also warned that because Harry had won the wand by force, it was possible that he would forever be able to use the wand in times of need.  Harry didn’t think anything of it, because really, why would he ever be close enough to Malfoy to need to use his wand?
Draco threw the ball to Harry, who sighed as he looked at his fiancé.  “Hon, we’re getting married in two days.  Yes, only Ron, Mione, Blaise, and Pans will know, but we will be married.  What’s the matter?”
“Hey, what’s wrong?”
“No, you need to be there.  Who knows what kind of trouble those new cadets can cause in one day.  You stay there, I’ll go home, and I’ll see you this evening, okay?  I love you.”
Harry looked up at Draco, giving him a quizzical look, only to receive a pursed look in return.  It took Harry a few seconds, but then it hit him full force.
Year’ than ‘the students that were unable to finish their education because they were too busy fighting for their lives against Voldemort,’ wouldn’t you?” Harry looked questioningly at Ron.
Harry stood as she did, shaking her hand.  Once she was gone, and he heard the floo flare, he turned and looked at Draco.  “Your mother is not at all what I imagined or remembered from this summer.”
Harry gave him a curious look.  “Plans?  Plans with
After putting all of his purchases into his trunk, and finding his new owl in the kitchen eating the scraps Kreacher was throwing at him, Harry decided that he should probably go and see Teddy and Andromeda before he left for school.  Telling Kreacher he would be back before dinner, he stepped in front of the floo, and fire-called Andromeda.
Harry smiled large, and knew Draco was doing the same in the room beside him.
“Fine, I give up. Do what you want,” was her only response, still looking down at her book.
Harry could feel how tense Draco was, sitting in the middle of the table, and was about to involve him in conversation, when he heard the rustling of feathers as a few owls came in through the ceiling.  Harry glanced up and saw that his owl was making his way towards the table.  He wasn’t expecting anything, so he wasn’t prepared for the owl to land right in front of his plate, holding a letter.
Harry wasted no time as he twisted away, landing precisely on the landing of the porch of number 12.
“I’ve used it in all of the rooms that have been completed.  I’ve used muggle switches and sockets in every room, too.”
Down the table, it was Hermione and Pansy’s turn to get a round.  “Draco, do you want another…what did you call it, Harry?”
“I’m fine.  Besides, it’ll make me drowsy, and I’m not—” He winced again as another shot of pain moved swiftly through him.
“I agree with Harry,” Ginny piped in.  “He may have been a slime ball, but I don’t think he truly could have done all that was necessary to become a
“Hey,” Harry said with a grin, turning back around to pull more cheese out.  “Enjoying your party?”
“Well, you have two more gifts to open,” Harry said with a shrug.
“What?”  Harry looked over at his godson.
Harry led them down to the second floor landing, opening up the door to the room that was where Ginny and Hermione had slept.  “I think I want to make this into an office of sorts.  Put shelves around the edges for books and the like, and then a large desk in the center.  This is what I drew up.”
Grabbing a plate and piling it with food, Harry walked over to one of the couches, and made himself comfortable.
“Hmmm… That's what she thinks.”
Draco stood there a moment.  He looked at the ground, and then looked back up at Harry.  “Thank you.”  He thrust his hand out at Harry.
Draco crawled over the top of him, leaning down to thrust his tongue in Harry’s mouth, letting his jutting prick slide against Harry’s, who let out a guttural groan.
“By complete accident, actually.  Like I said, I was putting some furniture up here, and I guess I accidentally cast a revealing charm and the door appeared.  I scanned it for any charms or curses, but, not finding anything, I opened it and discovered this.  It was completely overrun with weeds and trees and even a couple of pixies, but I’ve been cleaning it up when I get the chance.  Professor McGonagall helped me strengthen the temperature charm last week at Christmas, so that’s why it’s not cold.”
Harry rinsed out his mouth and turned so he was facing Draco.  “Yes, I’m beginning to.  I wish… Godric, I’m so sorry.” His chin hit his chest.
“Deconstruction, while the most fun, is also the messiest part of the job.  It’ll look amazing in a few days, though!” Harry beamed at his best friends.
Harry chuckled, shaking his head.  He levitated the plate of pancakes over to the table, and then carried the butter dish and some syrup over, sitting down in the same spot he had eaten dinner.  Draco did the same, and they helped Teddy cut up his food.
Harry laughed.  “I know I’ll lose but seeing Ron’s face when I hand you money will be worth it.  How about one?”
Ron and Hermione walked out of the sitting room and made their way down to the kitchen, where Harry and Draco had finished taking off all of the wallpaper and had torn out the walls surrounding Kreacher’s nest.  They had cast an enlargening charm to create a larger space for the elf.
She nodded in understanding, so Harry turned and tapped the bricks, which opened up to the bustling cobblestone path along Diagon Alley.  Even with Christmas only two days away, the weather was decently pleasant.  There were high, thin clouds, which let streams of sun through, and the temperature was near perfect for that time of year.
“Trust me, it was difficult.  But, it was worth it to see your face.  Besides, you’re one of my best friends!”
As the spaghetti was boiling, Draco opened a couple of the ‘junk’ drawers, as Ron liked to call them.  (“What?  They’re full of junk!  Random knobs!”)  Inside, he found some candles, and surprisingly a couple of bows.  He handed them to Teddy, who took them to the table and, standing on the bench, set them in the middle of the table, arranging them in a circle.
They both looked into the booth and burst into laughter as they saw that someone had put a large snowman inside the booth, carrot nose and all.
Harry walked back over to his bed, and pulled the curtains tight.  Curling into a ball, Harry closed his eyes and drifted back to sleep.
Draco sighed as he stared at the spot the man had just disappeared from.  “I’m afraid so.  I knew this day was too good to be true.”  He leant his head against Harry’s, closing his eyes and mentally preparing for the shit storm that was in their near future.
“Well, believe it. As a kid, I… well, I did most of the cooking.”  He looked down at the floor, thinking back on his childhood and his relatives.  He gave a small shudder.
Harry looked up from his plate and realized there were four sets of eyes looking at him.
As he stepped out of the fireplace at the Burrow, he could hear several voices coming from the kitchen.  Too many voices, in fact.  How many people did Molly invite to this thing?  Harry took a deep breath, and went to meet his fate.
Harry could hear the sarcasm, but the look on Draco’s face made it seem like it was the truth.
Harry’s anger started rising as he spat, “I have nothing to say to you.”
He could feel Draco’s fingers tugging on his own hair, and then sensed a thrill run through him as he felt a warm hand make its way under his t-shirt, onto his bare back.
Harry took a deep breath, staring at the table.  “I… Baby, I’m so sorry.”  He looked up at Draco.  “I know I haven’t been myself lately, and I’ve been ignoring you, and starting fights.  I never meant for you—”
Harry woke with a start.  He blearily reached over to the night stand for his glasses and his watch.  After putting on the glasses, he looked to see what time it was.  It was 7:20.  AM or PM, he didn’t know.  Glancing out the window didn’t help him much, either.  As he became aware of his surroundings, memories of the night before started coming back.
“Ah, Mr Potter!  Thank you for coming!  I wanted to show you how well it was coming along.  What do you think?”
Harry paused just long enough that Hermione suddenly said, “We can discuss Harry’s plans later.  For now, let’s eat this delicious food before it gets cold!  Thank you, Kreacher, for this wonderful food,” Hermione said quickly.
Harry just shook his head as he stood and walked around the table to kiss him, before saying, “Nothing, don’t worry about it.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the door move.  He immediately turned to stare back towards the door, and his heart leapt to his throat when the most gorgeous person on the planet walked in the door… followed by someone he hoped to never, ever see again.  His heart plummeted to the floor.
“Oh, it’s comfortable?  Let me try.”
The four of them pulled on their coats (Draco transfiguring his cloak into a muggle coat) and walked down to the restaurant.
“We think too much alike, sometimes,” Harry chuckled.  “This time, though, it just shows how much we mean to each other.”
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Harry said as he placed both dishes on the table and poured himself a cup of hot water for tea.  He sat Teddy in his lap, alternating between feeding himself and Teddy, until both had had their fill.
Harry laughed, bending down to pick up his wand.  “Well, even though that was a wonderful distraction, and the fact that now all I want to do is go take a nap, how about we get some work done before Ron and Hermione get here?”  He turned and lightly slapped Draco on the bum.
“Draco, sweetheart, no.  Please, hear me.  You did nothing wrong.  This…my brain…oh, love, come here.”
“Perfect.  Gives us enough time to get in one more incredible shag before you have to go,” Draco said as he pushed the thin sheet down the bed and moved to straddle Harry’s naked lap, taking Harry’s flaccid cock and guiding it into his still-loosened hole.
Draco couldn’t see who exactly Harry was speaking to, but didn’t think too much about it.  He finished eating, and stood to leave the Great Hall.  Harry caught up to him as he got to the top of the staircase.
“Thank you, Kreacher.  Shall we?”  Narcissa led the way over to the long table and took a seat.  Harry sat across from her, and Draco sat next to Harry.  Harry flicked his wand and tea was poured into the three glasses.
“Good.  I love you more.”  He gripped Draco’s hand again, fingering his ring.  He lifted his hand, giving it a kiss.
“Where are your parents?  I thought they were coming?”
Harry smiled at his best friend.  Ron smiled back, continuing to speak.
With a confused look on his face, Draco asked, “You can do that?”
“Can’t come soon enough, in my opinion.  I enjoyed the few days off when we got back.  I’m already tired of the daily grind.”
Harry started out of the room toward the stairs, but was tugged back.  “What?”
“Is it
“Pack? Where are you going?”
Draco laughed, pecking Harry on the lips once more before stepping away from the man.  “That is about the only spell I can cast non-verbally and wandless.  Slytherins learn that one quite early,” he said with a wink.
Glancing at Draco, Harry said, “Sure.  Let’s go before the good ones are taken.”
“Master Harry, Kreacher is sorry to wake—” The elf paused in his speech, quickly looking between the two men.  “Kreacher is sorry, sir, but Mistress Narcissa is calling.”
“So, Harry.  What time do you want us to come by on Thursday?” George asked from across the table.
“Well, they just need to get over it, because you
If he wasn’t so upset about being reminded about Draco and everything that had happened in the last few days, Harry would have burst out laughing at the twin gobsmacked looks on Ron and Hermione’s faces.
“I have gone through everything, and have already put back the pieces that I wish to keep, majority of which had belonged to my Godfather.  Everything that is up here, I would like to get rid of, and hope that you will want some of them, or at least know of a place to which I can take them.”
He released him with a pop, and crawled up his body.  “Good morning,” he said as he kissed Draco.
The long, lean fingers.  The pale nails.  The boney wrist.
As Harry stepped out, he realized the majority of the Weasley family were sitting in the living room, and were staring at him.
, he thought.
Harry just grinned at Ron.  “So, what do you need me for?  It sounds like you have everything covered!”
That was all of the warning Harry was given before Draco came, spurting into Harry’s mouth.  Harry wasn’t ready for it, so, choking, Harry released Draco from his mouth, getting hit with spurts of come on his face, hair, and chest.
They followed her to her office, but not before they said goodbye to everyone, telling the Weasley’s they would see them in the morning.
“Have the two of you experienced the intense heat since then?”  McGonagall looked intrigued by their story.
“Draco—”
McGonagall nodded, continuing her tale.  “He apparently said that you spoke out-loud, just as one of the other men…”  She trailed off and cleared her throat, causing Draco to look at her questioningly.  “I’m sorry,” she said, looking between Draco and Narcissa.  “This might be hard to hear.”
“No, I want you beside me, holding my hand.  If you aren’t holding my hand, I won’t be able to walk in the room.”  Draco sounded so sure, but Harry could feel the nerves radiating off of his body.
“Yes, of course, that is how you became the Master of the Elder Wand, correct?”
Of course Lucius would have something to say about his and Draco’s relationship.
prefer to just watch you, but I suppose I could help.  What do you want me to do, oh slave driver?”
“Yeah, I sent floo’d her, letting her know.  She said she was about to floo here and ask if he could stay, as her friend is still at Mungo’s.”
“It’s no problem at all!  We’re glad to do it, and taking him is giving us a much needed break from wedding drama.”
“I think we all know what he’s implying, darling,” Pansy said as she and Hermione passed around drinks.
Draco cast a warming charm over their table, and sighed as warmth infused his body.
“It was after he sat there with his hand patting me in the back for quite awhile, that I broke down and told him everything. A part of me was afraid he would tell everyone else, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that he would never do that to me. He actually tried to help me come up with other things.
With eyes still filled with sleep, Draco nodded.  “Yes, I did.  But, the waking up thing was much better,” he added with a sleepy wink.
“I’ll give you a present you can
Harry’s alarm woke him at 7:00am on Christmas morning.  He groaned as he reached over to turn it off.  He curled back under the blanket, not too keen to get out of his warm bed.  He turned over, rubbing his eyes, staring up at his white ceiling.  He blinked a couple more times before reaching over and grabbing for his glasses.
“Wait.  I have to ask.  You have tea with Hagrid every week?”
Draco was still wearing his robe, so Harry assumed his fingers were hidden from view of anyone who was looking their way.  Feeling his Gryffindor courage rise up in him, Harry carefully slipped his hand under Draco’s robe.  Quickly glancing around to make sure everyone’s eyes were still on Neville, Harry slipped his fingers under the hem of the black pants he knew Draco was wearing, and wrapped his fingers around the blond’s sock covered ankle, rubbing his thumb against the bone.
Harry decided the he desperately needed answers, but as it was still quite early, he decided to wait awhile longer to wake up Draco.  He crawled back onto the bed, settling himself directly behind Draco again.  Draco seemed to move instinctively backwards towards Harry’s warm body.  Harry wrapped his arm around Draco once more, and fell into a fitful sleep.
“Indeed, it is good to be home, but we’re not quite done with Christmas, yet,” Harry said.
By the time Draco walked through the floo, it was working towards 11:00pm.  He’d had a wonderful time at The Burrow, joking with George, chatting with Charlie and Bill, eating WAY too much delicious food, and spoiling the kids with their gifts.
“Yeah! What's with that? I thought that could only happen with—”
“Or, maybe not,” Harry hummed.
Teddy leaned into Harry’s side as they finished up their meal, and started talking about Hogwarts again, asking a dozen questions in quick succession.
Draco’s blush covered not just his cheek, but it seemed to flow down under the collar of his shirt.
“What?”
“I can see that.”
“Yeah, it is.  I’ve missed this.”
Teddy sighed, but crawled under the blanket and laid down in between them.  Draco reached over and threw an arm across him, too.  All three soon fell into a deep slumber.
“And you’ll be Mr Potter-Malfoy.  I like that.  We’re geniuses for coming up with that.”
“You awake?”
“What are you doing?  I’ve been waiting on you downstairs for ages.”
Draco wrapped his fingers around Harry’s shirt tightly, and Harry could tell he was reliving that afternoon in his head. Harry did the same, remembering the way Katie’s body had contorted in the air. He drew in a shaky breath, and began rubbing Draco’s neck.
“Complicated magic that insisted I still call Privet Drive ‘home’ so that I could one day kill Voldemort.  As soon as I turned 17, though, I left and have never looked back.”
“I’d better get back before Kreacher burns my dinner,” Harry laughed, walking back out into the garden.  “I’ll see you in a few days.”
“Good morning.  Sleep well?”  Draco smiled at Harry as he finished with his tie.
come back to you.”
Draco scoffed as he looked down at the picture, which was of the Gryffindor vs Slytherin quidditch match in second year. He could see Harry keeping his broken arm carefully tucked into his side, baring down on an unmoving Malfoy, hanging in the air.
“What?  No, I was on the bus, and then I was here.  The last thing I can recall is the foot being kicked into my stomach.  Nothing else.”
He smiled down at Teddy, who had wobbled his way over to him.
They sat there in silence for a moment before Draco reached over and took Harry’s hand in his, rubbing Harry’s palm with his thumb.  Harry smiled up at him.
“I’m here,” Draco huffed, walking around the corner into the room.
Smiling, Harry informed the group that he needed to go to Gringott’s before they got started.
The kiss was intense, but unhurried.  When they finally broke in order to breathe, they were both gripping each other tightly.
“Sounds perfect.  What about a bath?  We can write and text and soak at the same time?”
“I don’t know.  It almost felt like… No, never mind.  Let’s go.”
“Isn’t it beautiful?  Oh, Ronald, I love it!”  Molly, Fleur, Angelina, and Ginny had all gathered around her, admiring her gift.
He smiled as he looked across the water.  Draco, his eyes closed and head leaning back against the head rest, had a small smile on his face.  Harry reached his hand out and tweaked the big toe of Draco’s left foot.  Draco tugged his foot back and scrunched his nose.
“So, what sounds good?  There are a few places around here that have really great food, or I can have something called up from the Canteen.  It’s Monday, so there will likely be some kind of Italian sub sandwich.”
He stripped out of his clothes, slipping into his chilled bed in only his pants.  Things were looking up again, and he was going to see his boyfriend again in just a few hours.  With thoughts of Draco, Harry fell asleep ready to welcome the new year in right.
“Yes, you are.  Do you know what that means?”
“I love you, too,” Harry replied, pulling Draco’s arms tighter around him.  “So damned much.”
Andromeda had come back to pick up Teddy just as Harry and Draco had finished putting in the new appliances, counters, and sinks.  Harry had convinced her to stay for dinner, and so she and Draco, who held Teddy throughout the meal, talked while Harry cooked.
Harry threw his hands into the air as Draco walked over to their friends, casting a silencing charm around them.  He could only stand there and stare at them make faces of rapt attention and then utter awe.  Draco’s back was to Harry, so he couldn’t even try to read his lips.
Teddy looked confused and asked what happened.
Harry turned and saw the look in Draco’s eyes.  “Well, yes.  I’m her grandson’s Godfather.  I see her every other weekend, so I can see Teddy.”
Harry continued crying, clutching onto Draco, hiding in his chest.  Draco just held him and rubbed his hand up and down Harry’s back.
“Please, it’s Minerva now.  Are you two ready?  We’re ready for you.”
Harry kissed his forehead as they made their way towards Grimmauld.
“It made it easy that not a single student stayed over the holiday.  However, just be happy, and it’ll be payment enough.”
Harry curled up into the corner of sofa, Draco cuddling into his side, and then Teddy crawled up and lay on them both, his head laying on the arm rest.  “Tell me a story.”
“NO.  We are getting married in two days.  I love you, and I am ready to be yours for all eternity.”  Toss.
Gripping onto the back of Harry’s shirt, and in-between sobs, Draco continued.  “Because of you.  Everything boils down to you.  You saved me in that fire.  And then you stood up in court and spoke for me and my mother.  When I saw you stand and start speaking, I couldn’t believe my eyes.  When I was sitting in the cell at the Ministry, I kept reliving the moment when I looked up and saw you barreling towards me on that broom.  After all the horrible things I have done to you, you didn’t leave me there.”
Draco looked at him like he was crazy, but then deflated and moved to straddle his lap.  “Of course I did.  I missed you every second, of every minute, of every hour you were gone.  I was terrified you wouldn’t come back.”
Draco smiled and quietly laughed.  “Sorry, didn’t mean to startle you.  Everyone left while I was in the shower.”
“Oh, Draco, the weather is unpredictable all year round.  In October, though, it will be cooler, the heat of the summer will have eased off.  It will be perfect.”
“They have changed the décor since the last time we were in here,” Draco noted.
“Oh. Well, in that case…” Seamus poured more of the amber liquid into Harry’s glass, and then handed the rest of the bottle to Ginny.  “Mind if I play?”
“Hmm, true.”
“Pansy didn’t tell you?”
At that moment, he heard a rustle behind him, and noticed as his owl flew in through the open window.
Harry had the sudden urge to push his fingers through the hair, admonishing himself just as quickly as the thought appeared.  He couldn’t help but staring, though.  The summer had done Malfoy well.  He had grown a couple more inches, but so had Harry; Malfoy now stood less than 2 inches taller than Harry.  The blond also seemed less pointy; his cheeks and chin were more rounded.  He still was a bit too thin, but Harry didn’t mind in the least.
“Er, yeah.  I need to talk to you, anyway.”
“Where did you go?”
“Did he say ‘pleased?’” Harry whispered to Draco.
“His brother has given me most of his photos, and when I went through them, I came across several good ones of Ron, Hermione, and me, as well as all of our friends and classmates. I gave framed ones to the Weasley’s at Christmas, and several to everyone that came last night. These, however,” he said, pointing to the ones beside Draco, “I thought you needed to have. Colin was definitely sneaky—and quite brave— for managing to not get caught taking these, if you ask me.
He stood, popping his back, and made his way up to their bedroom to get ready for work.  He could indeed hear Harry in their shower.  In the past, he would strip down and slip in behind Harry, both getting each other even dirtier.  Now, though…  He just decided to cast a light cleaning charm on his body and pulled on clean clothes.
years.  He then made his way through the professors and Hagrid.  Harry had even heard a rumor of Malfoy crying at the foot of Dumbledore’s portrait, but he didn't know if he believed it or not.
No, Harry was kneeling in front of him, holding a small box with a glistening ring set inside of it.  Draco gasped, hands covering his mouth, as he realised what was happening.
He lifted the foot up, settling down into the seat and tossing the blanket over his lap.  Harry held Teddy up so that he was standing on Harry’s thighs, gripping Harry’s fingers.
his drawing pad, and started sketching out plans.
Draco huffed a laugh.  “No.”
Draco threw he arms across his face and mumbled something that sounded like, “Damn you, Potter.”
Draco, Narcissa, Molly, and he were meeting this evening to go over some ideas for the wedding.  It had been a couple of weeks since they had announced their engagement to the families, and Narcissa and Molly had taken it upon themselves to start the planning almost immediately.
“The Malfoy’s have been arrested and are currently being held at the Ministry.  They willingly gave themselves up, but we will have to wait and see if that will mean much when they go to trial,” McGonagall said.
“Again I say, what’s your point?” he asked, barely above a whisper.
“I know, I know.  Shhh.”  Harry popped the cap off of the tube of lube again and spread it across his cock, stroking himself a few times to make sure he was fully coated.  His eyes swept up Draco’s wheezing frame, seeing how flushed and beautiful he was.  He caressed Draco’s calf, sliding his hand under his knee, and hiking his leg over his shoulder.  “Are you ready?”
“I think so.”
“Thank you,” he said as he kissed Harry’s left cheek.
“You just yelled for us not a minute ago, Ted.  Cool the dramatics.”
“Great! How would you all like to be the witnesses at our wedding?”
Harry continued thrusting until he was too sensitive to continue.  Draco carefully extracted himself off of Harry, but stayed straddling him, bending over so they were chest-to-chest.
That had been the start of their romance.  Of ‘officially’ meeting each other’s families as boyfriends, spending nearly every spare moment together, whether it be out to dinner, or just lying on the couch watching telly.
Draco smiled as he picked up his wand and levitated the gifts.  He made them follow them to sitting room, where he carefully set them down under the tree.
“First you tell me you prefer me in joggers, now you tell me you like me all poshed up.  So, which is it?”
“I see.”
Malfoy gripped the wand, his fingers grazing Harry’s.  “I claim the powers that be,” he said.  Harry knew when the magic was complete, but as he tried to let go of the wand, he felt like his hand was working on its own accord; he could not release the wand.  It suddenly felt as if his entire left arm was going to burn to a crisp.  With all of his might, he pulled his arm back.  Malfoy’s face scrunched up, telling Harry that he was feeling the same thing.  He gave a loud yelp, his eyes widening, just as Harry finally let go of the wand.
~*~*~*~*~
Harry glared at him, but wrapped his arms around his waist.  “So, are you all in?”
“And what is for dessert?”
They leapt apart at the sound of the bang.
Draco looked around the room, taking in his large, loud family, and smiled.  He felt Harry place his hand on his knee and squeeze and put his hand over his and squeezed back.  He loved his life and wouldn’t have it any other way.
Harry just smiled at her, walking over and giving her a hug.  “It’s no worry, at all.  We just wanted to tell you that we are going to be going out to muggle London to get the kitchen appliances.  I have a few diapers in Teddy’s room, but didn’t know if you had packed—”
Taking his cup and saucer and carefully taking a sip while still corralling Teddy, he responded, “Well, I am going back to Hogwarts on Friday, so I thought I’d best come over and take mental images of Teddy, because it will be months before I see him again.”
“You’re no—”  Draco stood and moved towards Harry, but Harry just lifted his hand to stop him.  Draco paused, but then stepped forward until he was in front of Harry.
Harry could see the man’s eyes roaming Harry’s face, trying to find something that wasn’t there.  After a couple of moments, he hesitantly took Harry’s hand.  “Truce.”
“Good morning, Harry!” Hermione stepped forward, giving Harry a peck on the cheek.
Harry slowly slid himself in, large smile on his face, as he bent down to kiss Draco.  “Hmmmm.  I’m glad.”
things to him, if you catch my drift,” Pansy said.
“Well?”
George stood next, sending packages to everyone.  Harry was pleased to see some of his favourite Wheezes in the package, but also saw some things he had never heard of.  He looked over at Ron, who seemed to have the same thing.
Draco glared up at him.  “What was it you said?  Now that you have my arse in your bed, you weren’t going to let me leave it?  Well, it works the other way around, too.  Now that I’m in your bed, you’re stuck with me; I'm not going anywhere.”
“Wait, what? Oh--no.  I just had an idea and wanted to let you know something.”
Harry stopped, sitting up as well, and tilted his head as he studied Draco.  “What’s wrong?”
A loud boom echoed around them, and they all turned to see muggle fireworks lighting up the sky in all directions.   Harry felt his stomach flip as Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist.  Looking over, he couldn't help the wide smile filling his face as his eyes met Draco’s.
True to his word, Harry didn’t get out of bed that Friday except to get food and use the loo.  He and Draco continued their celebration of their engagement and of Draco’s moving in for most of the day.
“What about me?”
“Apologies for making you wait, but we had a few more gifts to wrap before coming down.”  Narcissa pulled out several things from the pocket of her robes.  She waved her wand and they unshrunk before flying towards the tree.
“Thanks, Professor.  Draco and I have worked hard the past few months.”
This photo was taken when Fred and George tried to put their names in the Goblet of Fire, just as they were thrown out of the Age Line.  The loop began just as they began flying through the air.   They landed on their backs, before they both sprouted long beards.  You could see people in the background, bent over themselves laughing, and began laughing even harder when Fred and George stood and started pointing and laughing at each other.  The loop stopped and then started again.  George was looking at the photo with awe, his smile widening as he continued to watch it.  He finally turned it to show everyone else.
Draco let out a breath as he stood up to placed his hands on his mother’s thin shoulders. ‘how did his mother get so small, her shoulders use to hold so much weight.’ He spoke carefully, “look Mother, the Malfoy vaults are not empty, they are still ours, and royalties are still coming in from generations of investments. Any illegitimate businesses will be shut down and those royalties will cease, but we still own multiple properties; the Manor in Wiltshire, the Villa and Vineyard in the south of France, in addition to some Shopfronts in Diagon Ally. They are lucrative enough to self sustain, but not for long. I could talk to the goblins again, but the Ministry has holds on the vaults for now and the Goblins also say they will have to get ahold of the new owner of the vaults. The Dark Lord was killed in a Wizarding duel, so all his properties and Gringotts vaults belong to the victor.”
"We were offered a more secure place to stay, more protection than the villa. At the old Black Estate you could say. Though, it hadn't been occupied in many years, the new owner offered us sanctuary." Draco said, fondness softening his eyes.
The stranger was acting weirder all the more when Hari stumbled up behind them. His eyes focused solely on Hari's eyes, the stranger's own eyes flitting Hari's forehead. No doubt, looking for his famous lightning bolt shaped scar.
Draco was hidden beneath the invisibility cloak, seething with a jealous rage. He was currently busy trying to keep his alpha dragon from roasting the man enthusiastically pumping Hari’s hand. He felt aggravated and itchy under his skin; the crowed was growing, a mob appearing. He had to do something, he couldn’t get trapped. He had to get these people away from Hari.
"What was her name...I mean that your mother picked out for her?" Harry wiped his eyes and pointed to how it was spelled in his mothers journal.
"Yes" Draco said simply.
Next chapter, Hari accompanies Draco to get new wands.
"Well, if in fact this is a true story, the bank wishes to offer our condolences, but you understand the bank will need proof of death, a death certificate. What did you say you name was again, Mr..."
And C'iemone was right. Aryls couldn't sing particularly well. She did; however, look like she was having fun and as the words of the song said, having a good time.
Draco immediately tried to give back the nickers. "I won't be needed these."
"I'm staying away from the newspapers right now." Draco scuffed his toe on the concrete, looking up at his trusted friend. "Have they accused me of using the Unspeakable, Imperius?"
"I'M CALLING THE POLICE. YOU ARE BREAKING AND ENTERING. AND--AND JUST ASSUALTED MY SON!" Vernon bellowed, his face turning the color of a plum.
Hari was cursing as he was forced to take yet another detour in Diagon Alley to avoid the ever growing crowd of people that entered the shopping center in hopes of seeing The Hari Potter. This was exactly why he took sanctuary in Grimmauld Place, he received no privacy out in the public. Now, he was rushing to return to Draco’s side. It wasn’t just Narcissa and Draco that needed a new wand. Hari was currently using Draco’s Hawthorn wand. Hari’s own Holly wand was not performing as well despite repairing it with the Elder wand. Hari thought that perhaps the core was damaged and Hari had only repaired the wood. Maybe Ollivander could repair it, and he wouldn’t need to purchase a new one.
Draco began to see a theme coming on when this person whipped off the cloak and her/his hips gyrated.
"Right then, behind that curtain is a door to the storage room we all have been using as a dressing room for tonight. I will be here outside the curtain if you need help." He was given black sheer stockings, and lacy nickers.
Sirius laughed triumphantly, "Confessed what? That he is guilty? I knew it. I’ll get Phineas Black's portrait to reach Dumbledore's portrait. Have them go to the Ministry and have a conference with Kingsley."
October 31, 1981
"But there are some good ones, decent folks I feed and and offer assistance to. I can introduce you to one of my guys, he'll take you to a shelter. They always save a cot for parent and child. If you'll allow the ruse. You won't be required to go back to your relatives who abuse you, they'd help my guy get a job and a house of sometimes. You could say you're official documents were lost to the elements or something. It's rough living on the streets after all. You could start over, new town, new school. I'm making by, but I had to let go my employees to keep the place afloat. I'll always have enough to help a kid in need of work experience, a reference for better paying work. When you are old enough to work, I'd hire you part time, paying you what I can. What do you say, kid? Will you let me help you?"
Draco stood with his back to the door of the sixth floor boy’s bathroom, hands clenching the edge of the sink in a white knuckled grip, and white-blond hair bowed over the sink when Harry crept into the bathroom unnoticed. Moaning Myrtle the ghost that usually haunted the girl’s bathroom on the second floor, had been trying to get him to confide in her for months now.
Blushing pink to his ears, Draco forces his dragon to recede beneath the surface. "Not entirely, no. It's a battle between my dragons instincts versus my human intellect and because I am still juvenile, or recently presented as an alpha, they are hard to resist."
turned into something else entirely. He remembered hearing this song covered on the Telly from a popular Broadway Musical,

Draco Lucius Malfoy, never had what it took to be a good Death Eater. It was only his life circumstances that brought him to that pinnacle moment where he made the decision to take the Dark Mark and join the Death Eater ranks. From birth, his parents raised him on four fundamental beliefs; he is a wizard and therefore better than any muggle, he is pure-blood which means his magical family lines can be traced back centuries, he is rich and influential, and most of all he is a member of the Malfoy family. He was raised to be proud of his heritage, his wealth, and social standing. More importantly, he was raised in the inner circle of pure-blood elitists and bigots who eagerly awaited the return of Voldemort so that they could take their place in the highest status, under Voldemort's new regime, as second in command.
This was a frightening thought, especially to the ex-Auror, Alastor Moody, whose token phrase was, "Constant vigilance". Too many people knew the location of Headquarters and having too many loose tongues could get you and your loved ones killed.
“You killed him ssso why do you cry? A hissing voice echoed in Harry’s ear and for a moment he thought it was the voice of Voldemort. Harry shook his head in denial, it couldn’t be. All the sacrifices Harry made and that monster was still taunting him in his head. But then the voice spoke again.
“Name your heir to the House of Black.” Andromeda said on cue.
“So what were you thinking earlier, when you pulled away?” Hari laughed. “I was only talking about a baby store, I don’t see how…” He trailed off suddenly, blushing as he suddenly caught on.
Tilting his head to the side in thought, Kreacher pondered the question. Thinking out loud, before raising his voice in certainty, he said, “Awe, well Mistress Walburga liked…Sherry and Regulus’s liked… Port.  Hmmm, Sirius ran away so young, but I found alcohol in his rooms once or twice. That Sirius sir. Always the rebel, that one. Preferred Whiskey. American Bourbon to be exact.”
------
Stay Awesome!
“No, I’ve just been lost in thought. Hari how…how do you feel about me…ah..ah…I mean, are we friends?”
'Easy enough,' Harry thought as he tossed in a small handful of floo powder and stepped inside the green flames that gave off no heat. Harry's world twisted away as he was flipped horizontally on his heels. He gave one long slow blink as his stomach fought to catch up with the rest of his body. He opened his eyes to see, not rows of books, but familiar carved doors that made up the entrance of the drawing room.
Hari of course finished his entire meal and ate his meal for free. Draco didn’t even make a large dent in his food, and had the waitstaff box the leftovers. A deal's a deal. Hari went to pay for the meal, handing over his shiny black credit card. Sheryl took over the till, accepted the rectangular plastic to complete the purchase. It was not until she was handing it back that she noticed the spelling of his name. For a moment she stood there with arm raised across the counter to hand Hari his card back, stumped.
Hari didn’t say a word, he couldn’t. He somehow found the strength to keep moving, limbs feeling heavy like wading through waist high water. With one step in front of the other, focusing on his white scruffy trainers, and the intense fiery touch of Draco Malfoy for comfort at his back. When they made it passed the customers/admirers/mob, he let out a silent breath in relief. “Thank you, Draco.” He breathed out quietly, almost inaudible beneath the rushing sound of his blood in his ears like waves crashing against a rocky coast.
The way Hari wielded his magic was no accident. Even now he could faintly hear a low hissing chant that emerged from Hari's lips as he healed his mangled arm. Hari truly was a powerful wizard, perhaps the most powerful of their time. He could be as legendary as Merlin.
It was torture. It was pleasure.
Intrigued; nonetheless, Hari leaned in closer to share in the secret, “What?” He whispered.
27 May 1992
Now that he had the journal, did it really prove anything. Hari knew from experience that just because it was written down didn't mean that it was true. He had the wool pulled over his eyes on too many occasions. There was that first time, with Tom Riddle's diary back in second year. Then during sixth year with the Half-Blood Prince's potion book. And how many times had that horrid witch Rita Skeeter, wrote falsified newspaper articles about him?
Startled he glanced up to see none other than Cho Chang; a former quidditch rival and a one time crush and sorta girlfriend. He hadn't seen her since the Battle of Hogwarts. The encounter was so shocking, so unexpected, that he could only sit there a moment and gape.
Dear Journal,
Although it's a journal from Draco's point of view I tried to stay within cannon for events. For events that didn't have concrete dates, I made up. Do you guys know how much re-reading I had to do to try to stay on cannon with the timeline? My brain hurts! So many time jumps!!!!!
Draco heard a gasp from beside him and turned to face is mother. She was looking down at the slip of paper the Minister had given her. Looking down at his own slip of paper, he read and wondered what the words meant.
Harry was elated.
------
He thought as he swung the cloak around his shoulder. Hari gave a long slow blink at just seeing a blonde head, before it too disappeared when Draco pulled up the hood. Hari forced out an overly bright smile, ignoring the pang of jealousy and possessiveness over having Draco beneath his cloak.
“Yes, Master Harry?” Kreacher responded.
Hari smiled shyly. "Your right, your right. Alright. I am being a bit ridiculous, aren't I?"
Hari figitted and Draco stepped closer, trying to comfort him. He wasn’t too keen on the idea either. Unaware or just ignoring the two teens discomfort, Narcissa continued to talk.
The dews at his feet glistened as the sun shone down through gentle clouds. He could taste the saturation in the air, as before a downpour, water began to gurgle in the fountain, but he didn’t let that distract him. “Grant us the truth of our hearts and insight into our wildest dreams. Show us in your currents, the  lives we touch, touch others as you flow through our fingers glance in time. For the dawn of tomorrow.” Hari says, his chest unclenching as he realized he spoke too fast for breath.
Harry was free.
------
“She’s attracted to you. If you don’t believe it, then believe me. I have excellent taste.”
"pfft. Admire. Obsess. Love." Draco replied in a sleep muffled voice, his body heavy against Hari's.
And so Hari began to plan.
“Oh, um...I took a page out of your book. I used my name to get what I wanted. They couldn’t argue with the savior of the wizarding world now could they?”
------
"Yeah, hey Potter? How did you manage to summon your firebolt all the way to the quidditch pitch from the castle anyways?"
"Oh no, if I don't follow through, I can't see Hari dressed up either and I can stand the humifaction for one night."
Hari held in his hand what he knew to be a sock, but honestly bore much greater resemblance to a limp, threadbare, rank smelling rag. It might have been white at one point, but right then it was the pale yellow-brown of dry and crumbling parchment. It even had what appeared to be ink stains on it from a broken inkwell or two!
Hari ordered the barbeque chicken legs, tri-tip, baked beans, cornbread, collard greens, and a Coke. Sheryl deciding to take a break from the kitchen after serving up the boy’s order, she simply stood behind the counter bar, hand to cheek, watching the boy eat, and waving off would be meal orders. It was fascinating to watch the boy eat. He wasn’t messy, but ate in tidy, small, quick bites. The large meal that could have easily fed two to three people disappeared down the boy’s gullet. When the boy seamed to realize that he had a drink in front of him, he stopped to take small sips, careful not to inhale the beverage. That was when Sheryl asked his name.
"It's alright, Cho. They're alright." Hari reassured. "The war is over. Draco was acquitted and Blaise, well he's always been neutral. They're friends and we came all this way here to meet him."
------
She couldn't have known that as she sang her own precious son to sleep Halloween night, Lily was trying to sooth her own frightened son behind a locked nursery door and a broken
"Le problème
The second time was when Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, and I were captured by Snatchers and sent to Malfoy Manor to get questioned and turned over to Voldemort. Draco Malfoy was forced to remain in his family home instead of returning to school for his Seventh term at Hogwarts. There he was asked to reveal my identity so that Bellatrix Lestrange could summon Voldemort to the Manor. He chose not to do so, but Bellatrix did not believe him and summoned her master anyway. We fought to escape the Manor and I was able to disarm Malfoy and his mother, taking their wands and leaving the three Malfoy's defenseless against Voldemort's wrath. I watched through our connection as the three of them were tortured for not being able to keep me prisoner, the Cruciatus Curse was used on the three of them.
Hari felt faintly queasy. Maybe he shouldn’t be listening to their conversation if he had to listen to all the reasons why he wasn’t good enough for her son. He was about to step away when he heard, Draco loudly and angrily proclaim.
Andromeda watched as Harry carefully took her grandson in his arms, and sway a little more naturally with him, humming contently. He then sat down in a rocking chair she guided him to, as he took a warm bottle of formula milk and carefully urged Teddy to take the nipple, nose and eyes crinkled as a happy toothed grin appeared on the boy's face as Teddy eagerly latched onto his meal.  Her eyes turned sad and Harry glanced up just in time to see her expression change.
November 30, 2018
“That’s partially what mother wanted to talk to me about with you, earlier.” Draco didn’t volunteer any more information and Hari didn’t ask.
Blaise tensed. "I was worried about being tailed and it looks like you were the one that had to worry."
Draco felt so guilty for his involvement in the war. He didn’t know how to forgive himself, let alone know how to go about making amends. But here, frustrating enough was his Saint Potter, forgiving him. Draco was frustrated beyond belief. He didn’t deserve forgiveness. Draco did horrible things during the war for his own survival, wasn’t he accountable for any of it?
He didn't.
“I had to borrow an old Potions book sixth year, and it turned out to be Professor Snape’s. Hogwarts curriculum is very messed up, if most of the textbooks are the same after twenty years.” Hari said. “How did you recognize that spell? Did he teach it to all the Slytherin’s?”
------
The small man with giant mustache and even larger orange hat, bounced on his feet, pumping Hari’s hand up and down excitedly. Hari wasn’t listening; he stood like a deer in the headlights fighting his inner demons. He felt trapped, surrounded, with no way out. Hari did not like crowds. Forget the door behind him. He felt the walls and people close in on him, as he fought his breath, his vision was going black around the edges. And then he felt a warm hand at the base of his spine,
I looked this article up online called, "Some Muggle figured out what 'Harry Potter' money is worth in real life." They did the work for me.
“Dray!” Hari hissed startling him out of his darker memories from the Manor. “You can’t seriously want to eat…” Draco turned to Hari his own grey eyes steely.
, to make the teen and infant move faintly over and over again in a continuous loop on the parchment.
He thought. In a desperate attempt to escape before someone from the wixen side discovered him, Draco bit down on the exposed skin of the man’s rolled up sleeve. The man didn’t taste dirty or unwashed as his father told him. He was let go, and Draco stumbled back, quickly turned in any direction but there, and scrambled away.
"Mry Petunia...after my aunt Petunia...its Egyptian for beloved. Beloved Petunia!" Harry spat out bitterly. "Let me tell you something; my Aunt Petunia envied my mother and loathed me for it. She didn't take me in out of the kindness of her heart, no. She took me in and made sure to tell me every single day of my existence how grateful I was not to have been left in an orphanage; for them to have provided a roof over my head, the clothes on my back, and to beg for the scraps of food from their table...So yeah, 'Beloved' my arse."
“Thank you, too, Harry,” Draco whispered.  “For being mine, always.”
year, so I couldn’t very well ask a boy to the Yule Ball, and as she was crushing on someone that she couldn’t ask, so we went together as friends.”
“What time is it?  What day?”
“So bossy.”  Draco gripped his cock, though, coating it with lube that was on his fingers from Harry.
Teddy jumped up and climbed into Harry’s lap, wrapping him in a hug.  Harry gripped him back, before letting him go so he could do the same to Draco.  “I love you.”
“Come on, Rosie, let’s go get you into some dry clothes,” Ron said, holding out his hands for his daughter.  She leapt from Harry’s lap and skipped over to her father, but then turned back and ran to Draco, hugging his leg, and saying, “Hi, Unca Dwaco!”
“How long?
needs better reporting if they can’t even get the scoop of a lifetime: ‘Former Death Eater to Wed the Boy Who Lives.’”
“Get your knickers untwisted, darling.  That look isn’t your style anymore, not since you and Harry became an item all those years ago.”
“I thought this would be easier,” he hoarsely said.  “I don’t know what to do, now.”
Stepping into Harry’s room, Draco slipped his hand out of Harry’s, as he placed the snitches on the trunk in the corner.
Harry was sure his mouth was nearing the floor.  He quickly closed it as he imagined Narcissa and Draco sitting around the Weasley’s table, laughing and chatting and eating Molly’s delicious raspberry pudding.
With that, he used his wand to gently raise Dumbledore’s arm just enough to be able to place the Elder wand underneath it.  Taking a step back, he realized that this was not ever how he imagined this all would end.   He shook himself, and then turned to Ron and Hermione.
They walked around to the back of the lodge to find a wizard brushing down a handsome caribou.  Harry walked over to him, letting him know that they had scheduled a ride.  He shook the man’s hand, and then gestured for Draco.
Draco reached for his mother’s hand, squeezing it lightly.  “No, please continue.  I’d like to know what happened, since I can’t remember.”
They were making their way up to the shattered remains of white marble.
“I may or may not have sent Bill an owl as soon as I received yours the other night, letting him know I was taking off the rest of the week, to spend time with you.”
~*~*~
“Okay.  So, we’re really doing this?”
“No!  I thought you had!”
They spent the next couple of hours eating, drinking, chatting, and playing different games.  It had been a long time since Draco had seen his mother so happy.  Seeing her happy smile brought such happiness to him.  It didn’t hurt that he saw the same happiness in his aunt’s eyes, as well.
He glanced around at his friends, and saw that Draco was giving him a strange look.
Harry sat there, trying to wrap his mind around this information.  So, Draco wasn’t the master of the Elder Wand; this was good news.  However, he could use Draco’s wand and Draco could use his?  This was a conundrum.
“I hope he plans on feeding us, because I’m hungry,” Ron said, leaving back into the cushions.
Blushing lightly at the fact that his head of house knew him so well, he nodded at her.  “Anything you need of me, Professor, I’m willing.  However, there are a couple of things I need to do first.”
He stood and carefully picked up both figures, gently placing them on the mantle, on either side of the picture set in the middle of the two of them on their wedding day.  He turned back around and wrapped his arms around Harry’s middle.  “They’re amazing.  You’re amazing.”  He leant in for a kiss.  “Thank you, love.”
Draco mouthed ‘second bedroom’ as Harry continued.
Teddy was pleasantly surprised to see that he had received a new practice broom, as well as a piece of parchment that Draco had written and I Owe You for a trip to the south of France.  They would be leaving right before Harry’s birthday, and would be gone for 2 weeks.
Harry grinned, moving up to pull Draco into a kiss, tasting both of them on their tongues.  “Oh, just you wait babe,” Harry said against his lips.  “That was nothing.”
They found an empty bench and Harry set to work on putting his skates on, then helping Teddy.  Draco took a moment to admire them, once again cherishing having Harry somewhat back to normal, and willingly spending time outside of the house.
“Draco, I…I…” He didn’t know what to say.  They had talked about the incident briefly, but he had never officially apologized for the curse that he had thrown at Draco without even knowing what it did.
“Well, they were upset, understandably, but they—”
“You have my heart,” he said with a small shrug.  Harry grinned, reaching for the box and setting the three ornaments back inside of it, before reaching over and gripping Draco’s arm, hauling him towards him to give him a heavy kiss.
Mr. Jewell placed it into the box that he had brought out, securing it so that the pendant was the first thing that was seen, with the chain wrapped around the insert.  He pulled out some wrapping paper, quickly and expertly wrapping the package, complete with a festive bow.
“Please, what, Draco?”  Harry stopped pacing, turning to stand against the wall again.  He glanced in on Teddy quickly, then turned back to Draco.  “Please, what?”
“Ron, no.  You can’t just leave in the middle of your own kids’ birthday party.”
“You may leave as soon as your classes are finished on Friday’s, but I ask that you return for dinner on Sunday evenings.  Any misbehaving, during classes or out in public at the weekend, will result in your privileges to be revoked.  Understood?”
“Ugh, don’t remind me.  Some godfather I’ve been lately.  We’re going to have to spoil him rotten the next few months, so he remembers he loves us most.”
“This is absolutely beautiful.  Merlin,” Draco sighed.
“How have you…  We talked about your parents… And work… I
“I don’t see why I couldn’t.  Draco?”
“I’m sorry.  This is about you, and I’m making it all about me,” Draco said, pulling back and wiping his face.
"Yep, we are going to get married and live together, so you will be able to come to one house and see both of us!"
“Shut up,” Ron said, flipping his brother the V’s.
Harry woke with a start.  He laid there for a moment, trying to figure out what had woken him.  He hadn’t been having a nightmare; quite the opposite, actually.  He listened into the room, and then he heard it: a muffled sob.  Peeking out of the curtains of his four poster, he saw the curtains of Ron’s bed swing violently.
“Oh, well.  I’ll probably just leave a little early.  We have plans for tomorrow, so maybe I can make it up to them.  Anyway,” she said, changing the subject, “where is Draco?  I assumed he would be here!”
Harry grinned.  "Yes, dear."
Draco smiled as he turned back to his food, ankle carefully wrapped around Harry’s.  “Good.”
“Oh, shit! I just realized you have to pay in muggle money! We didn’t go to Gringott’s before we came!” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear.
He was just holstering his wand when he heard Hermione’s voice calling for him.  He made his way down the stairs towards the sitting room, where Hermione was standing waiting on him.
Draco sat back, watching the unruly gaggle of Gryffindors as they bantered back and forth, completely not recongnizing the fact that this was his life now.
As they walked in, Harry noticed that Kreacher had decorated in there, as well, including a mini Christmas tree.
“I’m glad to hear it.  What about the…?”
They both emitted a loud moan, and then proceeded to mash their mouths together, so that they were connected from mouth to bulge.
Holding up the small black bag that held the wrapped box, he asked Harry, “Could I leave this at your place, Harry? Since we’re having Christmas at yours, anyway, it would save me from not forgetting it on Friday.”
“Yes, he did.  He is a very considerate young man.”  She gave Draco a look, which he chose to ignore.
As she left the room, they both looked back at each other, laughed, and then picked up right where they left off.  They had been together from that moment on.
“Following you.”
He glanced over at Draco, who just shook his head.
Harry started speaking before he even knew what words were coming out of his mouth.  “You’re so beautiful, Draco.  I want to take you apart piece by piece, and then put you back together again.  Can I do that?”
“Are you—are you serious?”  Malfoy could not hold back the grin that was fixed to his face.
He kept thrusting through his orgasm, until Harry whimpered, too sensitive to handle anymore, and Draco carefully extricated himself, slumping beside Harry on the bed.
“Oh, wait!  We forgot!  We’re supposed to blind fold you, mate.”  Ron conjured a blind fold, tying it around Harry’s head.
After sitting on the sofa, socked feet propped up on the coffee table, Draco threw his arm around Harry’s shoulder and clinked their mugs together.  “To us.”
“How in the here did they get interviews that fast?”
Above the fireplace was an empty portrait frame. Within the frame sat a single lion claw armchair made of cherry wood with a green velvet cushion. Behind the armchair was a tall window with silver and dove gray curtains flapping in an invisible wind. In one corner of the frame sat a lonely baby grand piano with duet bench. Standing in a display beside the piano was a four foot high arrangement of red roses. Harry watched as each of the red roses went through a cycle of petals budding, blooming, and then falling to the floor, before budding again. Even as he watched this fascinating life cycle begin again, more flowers were being added; an array of colorful lilies, mixed with white calla lilies. Harry wondered who belonged in this portrait. Did they leave the house when it became under poor repair, or are they lurking somewhere in this house in another portrait or building, entirely?
Hari listened with only have an ear as he let Sirius run through his spiral, but he detached from his emotions. When Sirius was done talking, he tilted his head to the side and asked in a pseudo calm voice. "So which is it then?"
Hari’s whole face lit up. “Actually I wanted to check out that baby boutique over there!” He said excited pointing over Draco’s shoulder.
He almost couldn't believe that he was going to sacrifice his life for the
“How do you mean? Sirius told me about Angel Central. He gave me directions.” Hari asked a little confused. Yes, they could have taken the direct route, but then Draco would have missed the impression a sight like this made.
“Oui, we are." Taking a sip of his coke which has been watered down by melted ice. He winced at the flat sweet taste.
How does Harry fair on the street?
He had to laugh at himself now. He was laid out on the bed, clothes thrown about the room like a twisted twister from Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes product had run amuck. His cheeks were flushed red, pupils blown wide, and the smell of sex, and musk, and alpha pheromones heavy in the air. Draco threw back his head, iridescent white scales glittered on his throat, as fire built up, glowing like hot coals between white cracks in his scales at his throat. His release was like that of the fire that exploded out of him with a roar of screaming frustration, and unfulfilled desires. When he came down from his intense orgasim, the  pearlescent beads of his cum glistened in the flickering light of the flames that surrounded him.
, realistically living in a closet like he had for the first ten years of his life. A few days after that, Dumbledore came to collect him from Number 4 Privet Drive. The following year Hari, Ron, and Hermione went to hunt Horcruxes. The result, Hari hadn’t set foot inside Sheryl’s Place in almost two years. He hoped that Sheryl was still amiable to him.
Narcissa hummed in contemplation. “Hari Potter is one of the most eligible bachelors of your generation; he is young, wealthy, powerful, influential, good looking,” she said with a chuckle, “and famous. He is the Boy-Who-Lived, after all. For most, these are all one needs to be considered a good match.”
Draco sat stunned beside his mother. “But mother, you’re not a beast or an abomination…your existence isn’t wrong.” Draco cried.
"Severus! Severus!" Minerva shouted as she rushed through the Dungeons. His office was tucked back far from the classroom, but close to the Slytherin's common room. Even so, after decades of teaching, she rarely visited the maze that made up the Dungeons. There were few markers to guide her and countless students, save the scuff of the stones and rub warn corners from student's hands as they made their turns.
Hari was impressed with the overall invention. It opened up so many possibilities in communication.
"Ah, sorry Kingsley... I mean Minister Shacklebolt. I just wanted privacy. I'll let you in, just a minute." He said as he hastily opened the Floo network to temporarily allow guests in.
“Mary, Mary.” Oliver panted as he dashed across the street. “Don’t do that, sweetie. You could have gotten hurt.
One gasped out, “no” while the other turned on Draco, “Look what you’ve done. Hari Potter doesn’t want our services, because you’ve stunk up the place. Just how many respectable customers are we going to lose, because they believe you are associated to our shop?”
Well, whatcha think?
Hari took the offered hand and smiled genuinely. "If you ever need to catch a break from the yelling, you could tell them I'm gay. That would steer the conversation away from that landmine."
“I didn’t know.” He whispered.
Collapsed on his knees, head spinning, and stomach churning, Harry fought not to heave. Getting his feet under him, Harry stood and looked around.  “Kreacher?”
“Now you sound like those Aurors, always talking about reports” Obviously this was a routine mother and son had to deal with since there stay at the Ministry. First Draco would go in for questioning for hours on end, while Narcissa stayed behind, then he’d come back to this room with an Auror escort to sleep. When he got up they would talk about the investigation. They never talked about what happens in the future. Then the Aurors would come and take Narcissa in for questioning as well.
Rushing to the bathroom, Hari opened the door to see Draco whirl around from the mirror. Droplets of blood were spattered against white porcelain and smeared over the blade of a small silver knife—he recognized it as an athame used for Potions.
“Do you have regretsss? Do you want me to bring him back? It’sss not too late.” It couldn’t be; Voldemort was not one to show compassion. Where was the voice coming from, if not his head? Looking wildly around, Harry looked for the person responsible for the voice.
When he heard the old nickname tossed out into the open, he couldn’t help but let out a watery chuckle of his own. Who would have thought they would be bonding over scars, the war, and shitty childhoods?
His mother assured Draco that the place was a respectable place of lodging and business, even the Prime Minister staying here a time or two. But the Leaky is the doorway that separated the Muggle and wixen on this side of London.
Draco rushed to Hari to twirl him in dizzying circles, his smile wide and bright. His blonde hair glistened in the light. “Now what?” Hari asked breathly, his arms wrapped around the blonde's neck.
Hari wanted to see the old Draco Malfoy again.
"... or letting me read your fascinating journal written about me?" Hari said with a charming grin. Draco wanted to rip that smile right off the smug bastards face.
Draco wanted to hold onto this feeling forever; the exhilaration of flying through the streets of Muggle London, Hari wrapped in his arms, urging the motorbike to go faster, as if they were racing the sun home. Grimmauld Place was home for him now, not because that was his mother’s ancestral home, but because that was where Hari was. It was naïve, and foolish for him to believe that wherever Hari was that was where he belonged. He didn’t know if it was his alpha, or if it stemmed from his ever growing feelings, it just felt right. He scooted closer on the seat, so that his body was flush with Hari, from knee, thigh, hip, and sternum; they were meshed together. His arms tightened around the teen and if Hari noticed or cared he gave no indication as he drove the bike as naturally through the streets as he did flying through the air on a broom. For the time being they were one, and there were no hostility between them, old rivalry, nor past mistakes. When he let Hari go, would that be the last time?
If they do conceive another baby, I’d better work out restoring their memories before I have a sister named after myself. Wouldn’t that be confusing picnicking with the family?
The press has been hounding him for an interview, stalking his every move, taking pictures of him everywhere. It has only been two weeks and there is no end to the celebrations in the streets, and the constant owls asking him to attended. Harry had even more press and people fawning over him than he did before.
Draco shook his head, clapped and smiled indulgently.
Hari rested his burning face in his hands. "Dray-co!" He whined out. "Did you have to tell my cousin I use to date his current girlfriend?"
Fixing his pillows, Hari slid beneath the comforter.
Nik raised his hands in surrender at the kids anger. "Hey, hey. Your right. I can't make you do anything. And I won't, not if they abuse you. But its not safe for a boy of what? Seven, eight to be running around London on their own."
Draco trembled as the brief spike in adrenaline subsided. “Keep your venomous pet in check, Potter.” He rubbed his ear, unsettled by the closeness of those snapping jaws. “I’m not sure
Either way Harry couldn’t stay out here on the street, someone was bound to have followed him. Some investigative journalist was probably even now taking his picture. It was bad enough before the Battle of Hogwarts with his ‘misplaced’ fame for surviving the Killing Curse and now, after he actually killed the greatest Dark Lord of all times and survived the killing Curse, again; he is even more famous.
Look how close Hari and Draco are on the family tree is that just fate or what?
“Oh, Andra, I think that is a wonderful idea.” Narcissa says, warming to the idea herself.
Hari cut his hand through the air like a blade. “I testified because I didn’t believe that a seventeen year old boy should be forced to spend his life in prison for mistakes he made as a boy of sixteen. His crimes, what crimes are those, Bill? Having the Dark Mark, because I know he was forced to take that mark! I saw it from my connection with Voldemort’s soul.” Both Bill’s and Draco’s faces in kind, lost color at that revealing piece of information.
“Saint Potter, welcome to the planet Earth with the rest of the angsty teenagers.” Draco laughed and only realized he shouldn’t have when he was slammed into the shed staring down into angry green eyes.
“Wouldn’t I?” Was all Draco said as he pulled out his aspen wand from the retractable sheath on his wrist.
With that said, please enjoy chapter 12.
.” Hari mimicked the gesture a little more violently. “I haven’t had lunch at Sheryl’s in a while and it’s the only place where I can eat anonymously, away from the prying eyes of the press. You and I won’t get mobbed, the food won’t kill you, and despite what you may have been told, Muggle’s are no lepers. So, kindly change into more appropriate clothes, even for where I am taking you, wizarding robes are strange.”
"What do you...whose Trout?!" They were still running.
She shuffled some parchment around, with dainty metal rimmed glasses perched on her rather long, warty, and wrinkly nose, not looking up at the shellshocked Potter boy. "Awe! Here we are. Your trustee was...Sirius Black, your named godfather...why didn't he...oh, I see." She lifted what appeared to be an extended note attached to the original, and set aside her glasses and resumed the hands on her belly pose once more. "Sirius Black was put in that Wizard prison, Azkaban. Fortunately for you, Gringotts does not operate by wizard rule but goblin." Pausing in thought, milky eyes staring off into space, unseeing, yet seeing all.
Mrs. Tonks. You hear me, Kreacher? I'm not making in promises!" Harry's didn't need to be looking to know Kreacher wasn't paying any attention to him,  Kreacher spun away with a mischievous grin on his face and satisfied twinkle in his eyes.
"It wasn't me..." He mumbled. "anyway, if we are done here...KREACHER!" The house-elf appeared with a crack.
Hari paused for a long second; not wanting to give away his name, as if saying his name would bring misfortune. Shaking his head at his paranoia, he wiped his face from barbecue sauce and meat juices, before he responded. “Harry” He responded before he put his black mop of a head down to continue eating. It wasn’t a timed meal and as long as he didn’t leave the table unnecessarily, he could take his time.
As one they all stepped backwards out of the circle. Then relieved laughter erupted from all members involved. Narcissa helped Andromeda take off the sleeping spell on Teddy. The baby woke up with slow blinking eyes, then squinting as his poor eyes adjusted to the too bright light.
Legs unsteady, Harry stood up and took an assessment of the room. Light filtered into the room from the curtains, giving the room a light and airy feeling. The claustrophobic feeling this room had before was no longer there. The spells that Harry cast did a lot more than he intended, not just keeping dark magic out but also expelled all dark magic from the house itself. No wonder he felt as if all his magic was drained from his core. The gas lamps upon the walls and chandelier overhead were not lit, spelled to go on when natural light wasn’t present. The rug was still threadbare, and wooden floors beneath it would need to be polished, but there was no layer of dust to walk through.
“I don’t love him because he is famous! Gods mother, even you think I am that shallow.” Draco said, seriously offended.
When the bouncer arrived Draco and Hari made sure to stay behind Justin and out of his line of sight in the mirror. He was still a bit dazed and most likely wouldn't recognize his own mother at the moment, but precaution.
"You're a Doll, Arlys. I love you." Sheryl replied on the hand off, then, "Draco my darling, Aryls designs the most exquisite outfits on a very low budget. While I pinch penny's and save to spend lavishly." Sheryl gestured to her body. "Aryls finds true treasures from the most unexpected places. She has managed to come up with this outstanding costume for you last minute."
Across the street from Sheryl’s Place, a tiny bottle blonde middle-aged woman frantically got on the phone to ring her longtime friend of fifteen years. “Sheryl! He’s here. Mama, Hari came back!” She squealed into the phone. She was met with silence and then the sound of a dial tone as Sheryl hung up. Rushing to the window, she stood on tiptoes to see over the display, just in time to see the large dark silhouette emerge from the kitchen and stand at the entrance, with cleaver in hand, bulging muscled arms crossed over chest.
Mrs. Figg had been so excited in hearing the music that she rambles on for hours about the small failed rebellion in France a century past, the characters portrayed in song and dance. Mrs. Figg would even sing along horribly, the piano was her instrument of choice, not her voice.
"How have you not heard of the most famous Queen in the entire galaxy?" Arlys gushed.
And now that Dudley mentioned it, his bulking form wasn't as whale blubber like, more solid muscles that fit with his tall build, and his six chins were down to two. You could actually see his neck. His hair was a healthy shiny wheat gold, and his blue eyes appeared larger on his face, less squint-like. He had a dimple in his chin.
Draco always loved teasing him about his fanclub, ignoring the fact, he was a secret member of said fan club. “Don’t want owls swooping in on you when your trying to sleep, delivering fan mail, famous Hari Potter?” Draco mocked without any of his usual malice.
The blurry image shows a towering shadowy shape in the center of Diagon Alley with a tiny twig of a boy, if you can even call that tiny blob a boy, walking triple time to the giant’s one step. Obviously the pictures were taken from affair and then enhanced. No clear image was able to be obtained. If I squint and turn my head upside-down I think I can make out an owl in a cage. I wish I hadn’t taken so long in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, talking to that spec wearing messy black haired boy, I would have seen Harry Potter in person.
"None of the owls have returned." She implored. "the letter's... I checked the Book, his place of residence...he...he lived beneath the stairs, Severus. He didn't have a room in that house, the Headmaster...and I placed him with those Muggles. He didn't have a room and now the owls have disappeared."
Please note that this chapter and future chapters mirrors JK Rowling's original Philosopher's Stone, the Harry Potter novel series, and WB film franchise, et al.
Chest heaving and breath laboured, Draco leaned his head down to nuzzle his cheek and nose against Hari’s own--scenting. Draco was scarcely aware he was doing so.
He heard another yell, not his and not the man trying to kill him. The grip on his ankle let go, and Harry scrambled with all his wirely arm strength up onto the platform. Breaking heavily he backed up a few more feet while on his back.
Flipping through pages and pages of article clippings and pictures of Hari as a boy, he watched him age through the eyes of the film. First Year, Second Year, Third Year, Fourth Year. He paused, his breath was shallow and ragid. He thumbed back a couple of pages, this was the image that started his lustful thoughts. It wasn't even that great a picture, just one of the numerous shots he paid Colin Creevey to take. Later on he would pay Rita Skeeter, and oh boy was that a mistake for the lies she told, but her quality of pictures were much better. The picture he looked at now was a blurry picture of Hari after completing the second task, he was topless, skranny, and shivering from the cold, reaching for a towel that this film would never capture him grasping. What was it about this picture that turned him on, at fourteen, confused at his reaction for a boy he believed he hated. Looking back, was this obsessive journal he looked through now, the thoughts about a boy he loathed, or secretly loved?
Draco took a deep calming breath, "Okay, Potter, anything else you would like to scare me with before we finish the tour." Hari realized that Draco only used his last name when really mad or in jest, so he didn't take offense and replied in kind.
Draco snorted beside him. “Well, Potter if you’re done petting my clothes, would you like to try something on?” Draco asked, secretly pleased at Hari’s reaction.
“Oh great savior, enlighten me. What does ‘winging’ it entail?” Draco asked sarcastically.
Harry furrowed his brow, and closed his eyes to concentrate. He decided that the first thing he needed was to concentrate on what he wanted.
Today was the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match. Okay so the day didn't go without incident. Longbottom caught me snooping around the library when I was looking for Harry. So, I told him I've been looking for someone to practice
I tried, on the train. I offered my hand. I told him the Weasley's were the wrong sort and that Harry shouldn’t be associated with them. He’d be an outcast from pure-blood circles in no time.
“Actually I’ve owned all three.” Draco growled deep in his throat.
He didn't know where to begin. Should he start off with his initial reason for coming, Teddy? or should he start by apologizing? He looked at the women who reminded him so much of her sister, the one whose deranged laughter haunted his nightmares, "
Draco bit back a retort. Inside he fumed that Hari seemed to encourage the Muggle instead of turning her away. Trying to draw Hari’s attention back to him as civilly as possible with his dragon growling non stop in his head, he asked tightly. “If the Muggles don’t have tailors on hand, how can you get an accurate fit?”
Hari’s reaction was not what he expected. Hari actually laughed, so long and hard, that he nearly fell off the broomstick. It was only Draco’s secure grip around him that he didn’t fall as he tried and failed to get his gasps and peels of laughter under control.
"I don't want to go alone. Please, Draco. Dance with me?" Hari pleaded giving Draco a sharp tug upward.
The house-elf quickly handed the portrait of Sirius Black III over to Draco upside down. The Sirius in the portrait was saying, "silly house-elf" and cursing as he fought not to fall into an ungraceful heap back at the bottom of the portrait when Draco turned it back, right-side-up. He then turned it to Hari, who grasped it excitedly, with hands trembling as the Sirius in the portrait said happily, "Prongslet! Pup, how are you?"
He found himself patting his head self-cautiously. Hari combed his hair-some of the time. Mostly it just did what it liked, so why bother.  Something Draco said made Hari’s cheeks burn uncomfortably. Did Draco just use shagged and hair in the same sentence while talking about him?
"Hari." He replied in kind, shaking his hand. It was a start. Draco's heart was pounding out of his chest and he was barely breathing as he followed Hari through green flames into the parlor. He was fighting his Dragon who was shouting and clawing at the restraints of his mind,
"Chips, beef sliders all around, and ribs... remembering Hari's preference for well cooked meat, said "Well done for both beef classics. And...that should be all for now." Sheryl came in with the food order for the table.
"I have to use the toilet." He said modestly as he gets up.
"Um...no." Hari said with a quick eye flick in Narcissa's direction. Narcissa just quirked her eyebrow, identically to Draco's.
"Drrraay!" Hari's voice brought him out of his silent musing. He still hadn't answered Hari's question.
Draco managed to hear the rest of the semi-private conversation. “Third year I blew up one of my aunt’s like a balloon because she called my mother a bitch. The only reason I didn’t get expelled was because my godfather was believed to want me murdered. Then before fifth year, Dementors attacked and I was forced to use a Patronus Charm in front of my cousin who nearly had his soul sucked out. I actually had a trial for that. It made the front page and everything. Anything in the paper’s that year was used to slander my name.”
That was it, his last words as a free man. He thought he heard a few sniffles in the benches above him, but couldn’t be sure over his own ragged breath. The Wizengamot was buzzing with hushed chatter, or was that just the buzzing in his ears? Draco wanted to take his sentence with dignity, but he found that he was terrified of the verdict. His breath was constricted in his chest. His breath was coming in short quick breaths.
Draco’s Hawthorn wand worked for him but the magic felt off. Not to mention he didn’t feel right using the wand when it use to belong to Draco. When Hari tried to return the wand, Draco held it for a mere minute then returned it saying, “it no longer fits my magic as it is now.”
“It's clear, cousin, you never belonged in Slytherin House. Don’t try to play the blackmail game with me,   you’ll only embarrass yourself more than you I, ever could.”
The only two people that Draco considered close friends and confidants would be Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zambini. Blaise’s family is neutral, and while Pansy’s family was sympathetic to the cause, their self-preservation was high and would wait and see. They too, were attendees to Crabbe and Goyal’s funeral but they didn't even acknowledge Draco and his mother. They couldn't risk being associated with them at the moment, in fear of becoming social outcasts or worse death. With their friendship estranged as it is, would it even be possible to continue their friendship in secret?
Hari smiles as the garden slowly transformed with the magic of the night. Flowers whose fragile petals hid during the harsh glare of the sun, slowly opened to the soft glow of the moon. He sighed content, and then found himself laughing at a memory of the day. They had made a mess of the lawn. An overuse of
Harry James Potter is not her son. She would give him a place to stay until the blood magic that protected him wore off or the Dark Lord who murdered her sister was killed or locked up for good. She and her husband would be compensated for fostering the boy. She would feed, clothe, and provide a roof over his head as was requested of her, but she didn't have to like the situation, nor did she have to love her nephew.
At first glance the newly discovered room looked no different than other dusty and disarray rooms before Hari and Andromeda put their charm work to the test.
‘Bloody oversized chicken’ he thought one last time as he hauled the bound and muzzled white bird under his arm.
“Sheryl, you cannot expect him to eat so much food. If he doesn’t want the special, I’ll pay for his meal…”
“That Mark doesn’t make you a monster. Don’t let it define you. It doesn’t show you as weak; it shows your strength and perseverance. Good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. These define our character. Please, please don’t harm yourself anymore. I cannot heal these scars on your arm or within your conscience; but hopefully, I can ease your mind.  Dray… you are not a monster and you are not your father. Maybe you can’t see that right now, but trust me when I say, you are better than him. And better than this.” Hari said as he held up Draco’s forearm with the Dark Mark.
"Don't be absurd, your sister hates the boy."
They’d all gone inside, to rest, to relieve themselves. Of all the spells that were invented. That one was the most shocking. But he was already picturing the ways Hermione would use it during exams so she wouldn’t lose time studying.
hooted softly and butted its head against Hari’s still fingers. Hari obliged and continued to gently stroke the feathers next to its eyes. “I guess you’re mine now, girl.” Hari whispered.
Circe, Draco hoped not.
Narcissa Malfoy née Black grew up in a household of wizardkind who believed in magic over muggle; a pure-blood belief that was harshly enforced. The Black's believed that muggle-born wizardkind were inferior to pure-bloods and thus not allowed to fachinize with them at all.  In the family of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black, if you didn't believe the same prejudice, then you were disinherited and had your existence blasted from the family tree.
Before Draco could say anything, Hari had a look of confusion on his face. "The wife was the person who wrote the ad in the paper that he responded to. So she had plans to cheat first, right?"
"Dray...?" Draco got out on a strangled gasp.
Harry was brooding, something she noticed he liked to do a lot, but something else was wrong. "That's not all that bothers you."
with somebody who loves me.
"Oh man, oh no, Draco! Why... are...are you crying? Hari asked beginning to panic.
“NOOOOOOoooo!” Potter howled in pain, not hearing the satisfying pop of Draco’s cock clearing the tight ring of muscles of his asshole. Draco paused, not because he was waiting for Potter to adjust, but because Potter’s passage was almost too tight, squeezing too hard, making it painful for Draco to advance any further.
“Parfaite!” Narcissa exclaimed excitedly. “Wait there.” So saying, Narcissa grabbed a dusty candle from the mantelpiece and proceeded to scoop green flames from the fireplace onto the candle wick with one hand.
“I haven’t been here since I was a child, invited to family dinner parties. I was disowned for marrying my Ted after Hogwarts and never cared to return for Order meetings. That's 25 years, now time does fly." Draco heard his aunt laugh.
“Yes, out
I had to stick my fingers down its maw so that it could purge its stomach. Absolutely, no red meat.
"Oh, sorry Andromeda, here...give me a second..." Looking around for a scrap of parchment, ink and quill  before seeing an envelope and pen across the room. "Accio!" They zoomed into his hands and he hurriedly wrote down the address for the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.
"Muggles do not notice anything they don't want to see." Draco says, taking an experimental bite of a crisp from a blue bag. His eyebrow raised, "mmmhh" He said, noting the sour vinegar taste.
"You're the only one who can get away with calling me that." Alice turned to Draco. "I'm pansexual. Meaning, I can love anyone, no matter their sex or gender identity. Sometimes its sexual, because hay, a girl has needs too, but other times its romantic or emotional attachment too. I've been in many different types of relationships. But recently the zing for me, hits all three with Sheryl Bear here. We've been fooling around on and off since I was 19."
And how did you and Hari meet? Sheryl encouraged.
She threw her arms up and wiggled her fingers. She paced now, before his desk, fuming.
"You live together?!" Cho exclaimed loudly. "You too, who couldn't go one lesson together without sniping at each other or trying to ruin the others work, or getting into fist fights!"
, had no bottoms on. Draco looked down at his state of undress baffled and embarrassed.
"That's the price for beauty!" C'iemone or was it Arlys called over their shoulder.
"Fine." Hari relented. "Sheesh I'm not expecting an Unbreakable Vow."
"Shhh, Master sirs, you go get new Young Master in the morning, Kreacher will get rooms ready for Andromeda...," Either Kreacher was mumbling again or Harry was blacking out, but Harry could no longer focus on what Kreacher was saying as he hopped around the room, cleaning up dirty glasses, 'did he really drink that much?' and straightening the liquor cabinet behind the bar.
Hari heard the sound Draco made, and glanced up at him. He noticed that Draco was staring at him, still not finished applying some type of lotion to his arms. Annoyed that Draco was still not ready, and now had the nerve to laugh at him. He spat out his toothpaste from his mouth, rinsing it and the sink, giving the faucet and the mirror a quick scrub down. "Hurry up princess, I am making breakfast that will be done in twenty minutes, we have a guest arriving within the hour, and your mother said you have been without a wand since the battle of Hogwarts, so we are going to Ollivanders to get new wands today. Meet me in the kitchen. Unless you'd rather sulk in your room for another day, that is." Hari said a bit testidly as he swept away from the vanity, quickly getting clothes on with still damp skin, and left the bathroom, in less than fifteen minutes than he first came in.
Bill stepped back, but didn’t step down. You didn’t need to physically be stronger than the other alpha to win in dominance. He changed his strategy instead. “You’re in love with Hari, or at least attracted enough to him that
Bill laughed and the argument was over. “You win, Hari. I still have my options, but I will keep them to myself and be civil, while in
Chore done, he stepped out of the shower to towel roughly off. He was pleased when his erection did not return. Feeling refreshed and energetic, he decided to forgo trying to get back to sleep to go into the kitchens to put a kettle on.
Draco was startled at the blatant show of sexuality as the Queen on stage swept her hands down her body sensually, before planting her feet to belt out the next words to the song. To his astoundment, the whole club seemed to jump to their feet with one hand on their hips and the other out in front as if pushing someone away--even his table, even Hari.
Harry sighed, put the bowl back, turned out the lights, and went up the stairs towards his room.  Making his way into the en suite, Harry stripped his clothes off, tossing them into the corner.  He suddenly had the thought of creating a magical laundry chute, to which he could throw his laundry into it, and it would automatically send it down to the laundry room that he was going to put in just outside of the kitchen.  He made a mental note to talk to Draco about that.
“Wand lore is so confusing, and yet so fascinating.  Alright.  Let’s get this over with.”
“Back in October, Dennis Creevey stopped me after supper one night, asking if he could talk to me.”  He could see a shift in the room as he spoke.  “We went up to Gryffindor tower, where he told me that his parents were beginning to go through Colin’s things.  They found boxes upon boxes of pictures, and sent them to Dennis.
“Harry, we don’t want you to be angry with us, but I just know you need to talk about it.”
A warm, fluttering feeling entered Draco’s chest as he gazed at the gorgeous man sitting beside him.
“Is there anything we need to do before-hand?”
“Yeah.”
“Yeah.”  He stood up, giving Ron a hug.
“I know.”
The boys share some alone time in the tub.
She glanced around then, suddenly realising what Harry was talking about.  “I don’t know, but I suspect they’ll be down in the courtroom.”
“And how do you figure it’s all my fault?”
“As have we,” Blaise said, nodding towards Harry.
wandless spells.”
“Eagerly willing to play chess with my best mate, eh?”
“YES! Right there!”  His cock jumped as the pleasure rushed through his body, emitting precum onto his stomach.
“Thank you, Kreacher.”
“Yeah, sure.  What?”
No scenario Harry could have ever thought of how this conversation would go could have prepared him for the look on Malfoy’s face as he spoke that last sentence.
Harry sighed, taking a sip of his water.   “As you know, sir, I won Draco’s wand from him at the Manor back in April.”
“Thank you, Kreacher.  Food is ready, for anyone who is hungry!  There’s tons of it, so please help yourself!”
“I wasn't planning on it, but something came up and I really need to talk to Ron and Hermione,” he said, gesturing with his head to the couple that were sitting on the couch.
“You didn’t tell me that!”
He turned back to the pantry, trying to decide what to have for supper.
“What about you, now?  Do you want…?”
It was quiet for a second, before Draco said, “How did you know it was me?”
“And you couldn’t talk to me?”
“As to why I’m wearing it.  I know you love seeing me wear it, and love taking it off of me, even more.”
Draco started calming back down as Harry ran his fingers through his hair.  “Yeah, just another one, and then you weren’t here, and…” He trailed off.
“I’ll take that as a no,” Draco said after several moments of snogging.  “However, in order to get your surprise, you have to give me a couple of minutes to get it ready, okay?”
“That sounds fine with me.  I’ll let mother know when she gets done with her looking.  I’ll go back up there, if you want to continue with what you were working on,” he said, motioning to the forgotten carpet.
“What were you doing with Professor McGonagall at Ollivander’s?”
Harry slammed Draco against the door, pushing their mouths together forcefully.  He tugged on the back of his head, pulling a fistful of hair, as he rutted against him.
Draco gave him a surprised look, but nodded his head, and turned out into the corridor.  The men made their way out of the castle, and started towards the Black Lake.  As they passed a large stone in the ground, Draco turned his head and looked at Harry.
He waited for Narcissa and Draco to stand, gesturing to Narcissa to lead the way upstairs.
Draco started complaining, but Harry just shushed him with a kiss on the lips.  “Trust me.”
Today's Prompt:
“Er…”
Harry gripped him harder as Draco leant back into his chest.  “I’ll always come back, love.  Always.”
“Don’t open, yet.  Actually, this might be better if I blindfold you.”
Draco ignored him, though, and asked, “What time do you have to leave?”
“So, from what I’ve learned over the years, it could only then be—”
Draco took Harry’s hand, letting himself be pulled up, and checked his pockets one last time to make sure they had everything.  “Alright, let’s go.”
“You’re going to put them up?”
“It’s an endearing term, now, isn’t it?”  Ron looked at Draco, bumping his shoulder.  Draco nodded back.  “Besides, it would be far too weird to call him
Harry woke with a start.  At first, he didn't know what woke him.  Confused, he sat up.  Sunlight was pouring in through the windows.  Reaching for his glasses, he noted the time; he’d had a nice lie-in, as it was nearing 10:00am.
“You know what this means, right,” he asked, looking at her with a smile.
Blaise started talking, and Harry just let the sounds from around the table wash over him.  He sipped his drink, laughing at the right times, but overall, just enjoying having Draco beside him.
“I know, love, I’m sorry, but the lump was just so comfortable, I decided to leave it and just lay on it.”
“I love you more,” Draco said, playing with Harry’s hair, his eyes beginning to droop.  “I love you so much more.”
Harry nodded at her, and then looked back to everyone in the room.  “We should go down to dinner.”
As they were finishing their breakfast the next morning, Harry went over to the Gryffindor table and chatted with someone.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” Blaise said.
He had so far received several bottles of expensive wine and Fire Whiskey, several books, a pillow that said ‘Cuddle Weather’ (“Any weather is cuddle weather when you have the right partner,” Luna said) and a set of snitches that could be called back to their owner.
“We’ve no idea,” Hermione said.  “We all received owls from Draco saying to come here after work.”
He gripped the base, pulling the plug out a bit.  He twisted it slightly when he saw that it was ridged, causing them both to moan again.  Harry pushed it back in, and revelled at the squelching sound it made, due to the amount of lube that Draco had used.
“Because no one deserved that horrific of a death.  If there had been any way that we could have saved all three of you, I would have done it.  But besides that, Voldemort was the only one that
Draco deflated as he listened to what Harry was saying.  “Okay, you’re right.  But I still feel like we need to do
“Morning,” he said, placing a kiss on Draco’s cheek.
Draco nodded.  “I’ll see you this evening?”
After pacing in the sitting room for several moments, he left and walked back upstairs to their bedroom. They were supposed to meet Ron and Hermione at the Ministry gala in twelve minutes. Harry had been ready to go for eighteen minutes, now.
“I don’t think I will ever get over you calling her mum,” he said with a shake of his head.
Once dinner was done, and everyone had had their fill of pudding, Harry and Teddy took their leave with promises of seeing everyone soon.
“What do you think?” he asked quietly to Ron, Hermione, Draco, and George, who were the ones closest to him.
“’Night.”
“It was your grandfather’s,” Harry said.
He realized that Draco was laying half on top of him, with his head tucked neatly under Harry’s chin, and his arm lain across Harry’s chest, gripping the seam of his t-shirt.  Harry’s right arm was dangling off the couch, but his left was laying across Draco’s back.  Discovering his arm was losing feeling, he carefully brought it up, linking his hands together, wrapping Draco in a hug.  Harry quite liked the feeling of the taller man covering him and became as still as he could in the hopes of not waking him.
“Well, you see, you just can’t get keep your hands off me when I make you—”
Draco just smiled and shook his head again.  “Anyway, yes, I did.  She didn’t give an answer, so I figure we can just getTeddy to convince her, tomorrow.”
who did it, not
Blood flowing south brought Harry back to the present.  He discretely pinched his arm, forcing himself to focus.
“Shit, I didn’t even think about paparazzi being in the court room!”
“It’s a surprise for Harry, but I’ll tell you all of you want.”
“Doesn’t she?  I personally think she needs to dress like this more often.”
He was laying on his stomach, pressing his cock into the mattress.  There was no way he could get out of his bed with this bad of a boner, so he knew he was going to have to take care of it before he could get dressed.
Harry glanced over at the bedside table and looked at what time it was.  He then looked over at the orb and saw that Teddy was still sound asleep.  He looked up at Draco.
Draco could hear people walking and talking around them, cars zooming by.  “Where are we, Harry?”
“Yes.  Luckily, we only have to send a few.  We can text the rest of them.”
Mr Stotts walked up at that moment and said, “They decided that there was no way they would be able to get out of it, once Rooks started speaking  This is great news, great news.”
“I feel like I’m back at Hogwarts and getting expelled, or something,” Draco said as he got back on the phone.
He stared at himself in the mirror, turning side to side.  The trousers were a bit big, and the shirt didn’t fit right in the shoulders.  He was about to say something when the door was suddenly opened and an elf stepped in.
“Kreacher!  You’re back!”
“You said her birthday was in September, correct?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I…I…”
“Thanks, we picked it out this morning.  Where’s Ron?”
to talk to about it is Malfoy, and that is unlikely to happen, so there’s no need to get into it.  Please, Hermione.”
Harry stood and helped pick up the bag, dumping a few onto the table.  He turned back to look at Draco’s face, which was full of a mixture of awe and fear.  He pulled a few more out of the back, and indeed came across three howlers.  Not even dreaming of listening to the vitriol which he knew would spew from them, he pulled his wand and obliterated them.
“Well, since everyone decided to play, we decided that we aren’t going to play Truth or Dare.” A loud groan emitted through the group, with Blaise beginning to stand.  Neville spoke loudly over the crowd, “I just thought it would be fun to actually get to know each other! We’ve been living together for over 3 months, and while I can't speak for everyone, I still don't know a lot about a lot of you.”
Draco put his hands on Harry’s chest for leverage as he started to raise off of him.
They didn’t sit in silence for too long, though; because after a few moments, the sound of the floo flaring rang through the room, just as they heard the front door open and close.
“Shit! Oh, shit! Harry!”  Draco released Harry’s mouth, throwing his head back in ecstasy.  Harry attached his lips to the creamy skin of the pale neck laid out before him.
Hogwarts castle stood elegantly on the side of the mountain, surrounded by snow.  It was an absolutely breathtaking view.  Harry felt warmth seeping into his every cell.  Home, he thought.
She tugged on Ron’s arm, pulling him away from his conversation with George.  He was confused until he realised she was walking him back towards Draco, and then smiled.
“Oh, yeah? What’s that?”
, he scolded himself, getting out of bed.  It was done, and they were no longer together.
1.  I'm sorry that this is late!  Real life is catching up to me, and I haven't had time to write the past couple of weeks.  Then yesterday, when I was supposed to update, I worked an off-Broadway show at my local theater, and didn't get home until 1:00am this morning!
“Uncle Harry! Uncle Draco! It’s about time!  I’ve been waiting for
Draco stopped halfway up the staircase, turning slowly to face Harry, infamous Malfoy sneer on his face.  “What, Potter?  What do you want? I'm a very busy person.”
“Just as I suspected.  I have to say, I am very intrigued by all of this.”
“I know that now.  I’m sorry.  I just thought I could do it by myself.  I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.”
“Hey, D—Draco?” Harry called out.  He felt it was going to take a little bit of time to get used to that word on his tongue.
Draco took one look at the three—
Draco made his way up to Harry’s room.  As he opened the door and saw Harry sprawled on the bed, he found that he wished that his mother and the headmistress were not, indeed, downstairs, and that he could instead just crawl into bed with Harry.  Draco closed the door behind him with a sigh.
“Am I missing something, Potter?”
“Surprise! Happy Birthday!” they all screamed.
“This may be my favourite picture of myself that has ever been taken,” Harry said, looping his arm around Draco’s, slipping their fingers together.
“That, my dear, you will find out in a bit.”
“It means that since you two have been together, you’ve been happy.  I like seeing you happy.  I don’t like seeing that cold glare back in your eyes or on your face.”  She pulled him to a stop.  “What’s wrong?”
Draco saw Harry sweep his eyes over him.  “Sorry.  I just didn’t notice what you were wearing, earlier.  Damn.”
Making it into Draco's room, his den where he felt most safe, Draco shoved Hari onto the bed. For one moment, Hari's mind flashed back to his dream a few nights back. But Draco's dragon hadn't manifested in lust, it was all Draco--distraught, crying, angry mess of a person before him.
***End of Flashback’s***
There was a clambering commotion on stage, cursing and metal scraping over the stage, microphone amplifying the sound. This Queen came compared. Queen Daenerys' had an endogamous youthful face, that Draco couldn't tell came from an excellent makeup job or their actual youth. They had white blond hair tied up similarly to his but where his cut off around nape length, theirs went down to middle of the persons back. The long toga white dress with grey accents completed the look. This Queen Daenerys looked ferocious perched on a throne of spikes.
"Yes, honey, that's great." Turning to face Emmet, Sheryl stuck out her massive hand. "Congratulations!" Emmet took the much larger hand in his with no qualm.
Get some tissues.
There was silence and then...
Just then the floodgates opened, releasing all of Harry’s suppressed emotions, like a dam after a storm. It has only been two weeks since the Battle of Hogwarts and Harry have gone to five funerals of dear friends of his, and the Ministry of Magic wanted him to make an appearance at several others.
“Hari,” Draco said in a voice that quivered faintly in fear. “I want to talk to you about something.”
Hari easily caught up Teddy in his arms and rocked and soothed him to soft gurgles with gentle shushing sounds. Draco eagerly moved closer to coo at the near three month old. He didn’t laugh, he wouldn’t be able to yet, but he stared fixity up at Draco content to be cradled by Hari. Then miraculously Teddy smiled and his hair melted away. No, his tuft of hair lightened in colour, to a pale white. Blonde to match Draco’s own.
"I don’t know what you are talking about, Dray." Hari said clearly lying. "See Draco, yet another example of your bad decision making. Your sleeping alone. I doubt you’ll remember this conversation anyway."
? Hari then swung one leg over as if he were riding a broom, and put a helmet on his head, snapping the buckle beneath his chin, and held up another for Draco. Then Draco had another scary thought,
But Draco, even before the war, he never thought too deeply about his future, everything he owned he had handed to him on a silver platter. It wasn’t until he had it all taken away from him that he realized what that struggle meant. Until that moment, he had been too arrogant and selfish to realize that in trying to survive the moment, he never looked towards the future, or the consequences his actions did in the present would affect the lives of so many others.
"Hey, now. Is that any way to behave towards the person who is treating you to breakfast. Weren't you ever told to respect your elders?" Nik scolded.
"I've talked to Ollie, one of the co-owner. He says that the usual booth is being cleared of guests and we can claim it shortly." Sheryl cut into the lovers quarrel like a knife through butter.
He landed with a soft oomph on his back, cushioned by a soft duvet and a mountain of pillows. The impact had all the breath leave his body. Hari’s body dipped as Draco added his own weight to the bed.
“I don’t have any money on me ma’am, but thank you.” Hari tried to humbly decline the request. It was true he didn’t carry Muggle money on him or else the Dursley’s would demand where the money came from and try to steal it.
It was fear of the exact situation she now found her son in that had brought her to his door. They needed to discuss Draco’s intentions with Hari. Not that she disapproved or anything, she just needed to make him understand the position he was putting himself in by pursuing this relationship with Hari.
Most of what he owned was destined for the rubbish bin. The pile on the right contained his school uniforms and robes he’d outgrown. On the left were the Muggle clothes he wore during his summers with the Dursleys. This meant they were all Dudley’s oversized hand-me-downs, worn only to keep the Dursley's from finding out that he had even the slightest amount of money that they could steal or lay claim to. Now he didn't have to worry about such things.
“Well, for the most part it takes our libido out of commission. Like an Icey-shower, or so cold to the touch it burns. The area that touches the minor turns blue. You can even get frostbite.” Draco said.
Narcissa was the first to move. She held her yellow candle up to the sun. As she spoke, a breeze gently moved her long skirts and played with the ends of her blonde hair. The air felt light and heavy at the same time.
"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! I'll hold him off!"
Narcissa and Draco attend the funeral of Crabbe and Goyle and then are apprehended by the aurors to stand trial for war crimes.
Hari wiped his eyes with one sleeve. “And you’ve had this happen around me, because I am not yet eighteen? But I am considered an adult in the wizarding world! Why did they make it eighteen?”
Hari and Draco get plastered and Draco makes one high-risk drunken confession. How will Hari react.
"Tell me Draco, who do you more look like, your mother or father?" Sheryl asked as she began setting out equipment with wires and buttons. The like Draco has never seen before. It was like she could read Draco's expression perfectly.
Draco swallowed him down to his root, before ascending back up to the exposed head, where Hari erect penis weeped pre-cum openly. Draco sucked the translucent milky liquid into his mouth, humming in pleasure.
Arm tingling like an army of fire ants digging into his arm, Hari hissed through the sensation. Raising his deadweight arm up with the aid of the other, he squinted--thank fuck he had his glasses on still. "Just past 2 in the afternoon," Hari actually whimpered as he lowered his tingling arm back to the bed.
"I don't care. I cannot have that freak around my son. He's dangerous."
Coming up next- Chapter 6: Sanctuary
Hari stood up and guided Draco to yet another rose bush that evidently, Hari was going to cut at with his little scissors. “Come look at this. See these tiny roses here?” Draco rolled his eyes with arms across his chest.
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
I never did find them. I do not understand. I waited and waited. Did they decide to not give her to Charles Weasley? But then McGonagall caught me out of bed, pulled me by the ear. I tried to tell her about Harry and the dragon to try and save myself from getting expelled. But no, I cost Slytherin twenty points, sliding us into second place behind Hufflepuff, those goody-two shoes, always sucking it up to the professors. Now I have detention.
Draco’s brain stalled for a moment on that one word before turning back on in overdrive. His eyes tracked around the room once more, taking it all in with a new perspective. He looked at the clothes on the bed and floor before his eyes landed on Hari’s disheveled appearance. His heart melted and the smirk on his face softened into a goofy grin. His body wanted to melt with his heart, but he forced his body to sit up instead.
