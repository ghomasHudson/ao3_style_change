big things on the way!
"Then give me a bloody reason to, Malfoy! I don't understand why you're making this topic of conversation such a ball-ache!" Harry grumbled at Malfoy’s avoidant behaviour.
The aftermath
The dark-haired man’s smile broadened at Draco’s acceptance of Harry’s reassurance.

was with us… to help me sleep at night,” he spilled his guts to Harry, and at some point he had placed another hand on both of theirs, cradling their joined hands like a fragile, precious thing. Harry didn’t protest when he stroked his knuckles tenderly.
Harry obviously misunderstood the blush, and reassured Draco that the phone was fine, but needed to be plugged in. Draco remembered Hermione mentioning that, and frantically searched for the place he knew would work. He could feel Harry’s eyes on him, and when he turned around, he saw the man was smiling softly. Draco’s heart fluttered.

Pretending to transfigure various makeup products into items from his own pockets (wallet, keys, even his wand -  which Draco found particularly amusing). When Draco finished with the mascara, he used the applicator (wand) to cast a pretend

Harry has a distinct lack of impulse control. And also social skills.
Would he and Potter always be like this, even as grown men, with new lives and priorities? Was it simply their fate to always clash? To always fight?
Draco noticed Harry now staring at his lashes, and blushed under the scrutiny.

Friends… could they be… friends?
“What the hell is that supposed to mean, Potter,
Draco didn’t waste another second before tearing his eyes away from Harry’s expression (he looked like a starving man…) and speaking.

Hermione was fussing over the tailor from Madame Malkin's as the elderly man poked and prodded at Ron and Harry alternately.
fresh.
Draco could scarcely believe what he saw… guilt, and longing, and a reverence that made Draco’s head spin. His hand moved, millimetres from Draco’s skin, up his back and along his spine (which was decidedly ready to collapse into a loose pile of pebbles at that precise moment), between his shoulder blades and all the way to the nape of his neck. Draco had to shut his eyes against Harry’s reflected expression, before he did something rash.
This was one of my fave chapters to write 😭
Around Malfoy’s neck, Harry noticed a golden crescent moon pendant hanging from a delicate matching chain. There were ornaments in his long blond hair - golden, and shaped like stars - and a thin, matching circlet, decorated with the chronological phases of the moon.

They did look good, Harry thought. He had filled out loads since the war, and even the general public noticed that. He remembered spotting the odd Witch Weekly magazine in various appointments over the years praising him on how handsome he had become. To be honest he didn’t really see it. Harry looked at his own reflection. Still the same old green eyes with glasses, same dark brown complexion, same completely untamable hair. What was it Ginny called it? Rugged?
Their eyes finally met, and Harry’s expression abruptly changed, he looked surprised, almost awed, and he outright stared into Draco’s eyes, faces mere inches apart.

Harry walked closer to him again.
"Oh,” said Potter, finally getting it, “I suppose I never considered that you had a choice." he admitted.
The party aimed to showcase the beauty of the ocean and all aquatic life, and bring awareness to pollution from potions waste and endangered aquatic species.
But as he saw the way the light danced along the rubies, and how the red feathers brushed the man's slender clavicle, and how a long and shapely leg tipped with a violently scarlet heel slowly emerged from the slit in the dress' skirt…
He was absorbing their praise like a sponge.

“Isn’t making a spectacle the whole point?” he said.
“Yeah, actually. I saw you around the potions shop, at least. Didn’t know you brewed for them,” said Harry.
Just a smidgen 👌.
Then Draco did it. He pressed his mouth against hers.
It was true. Malfoy had a hand on Parkinson's waist and his mouth on hers. Her fingers twined in his hair as she tilted her head. Harry thought he saw Malfoy twitch, but he didn't give it much thought as the new angle meant Harry had a full view of Malfoy's lips.
I've been very good and I've written about three more chapters since I've been gone. It's getting good, everyone!
him. He loved the way his hair grew wild, like the manor’s neglected rose bushes before it was sold. Draco loved laughing with him and making fun of him and touching him, and looking at him like he’d hung the stars. And Draco adored the way Harry looked at him in that exact moment. Their eyes met, and for the first time up close, Draco saw that same admiration reflected back in Harry’s eyes.
“It’s no different than usual. They’re gonna love you, they always do--” said Harry. He was using that earnest tone that made Draco’s heart ache and flutter at the same time… but Draco couldn’t meet his eyes.
Be sure to drink plenty of water today, don't forget your meds, and if you're holding any tension in your jaw or shoulders, you can relax now.
“I can’t dance, you know,” he said, completely out of nowhere. Catching Draco completely off-guard. He was tempted to laugh at the man. He opted to tease instead.
Your comments and love really do keep me motivated! Don't be afraid to interact a little, even if it's just incoherent babbling, I really do appreciate it so much💛

“You’re too skinny,” said Harry, a lie, “try it, it’s good,” he said.
Harry flinched as if slapped, and yanked his hand back, of course Draco saw all of this in the mirror that Harry had clearly forgotten they were standing before. Draco almost audibly whined at the other man’s retreating hand, were his self-control on par with that of a lesser man, he may have outright swooned.
“Ow! What was that for?” Harry squawked.
, Harry?” he said, changing the subject.
Once he reached the center of the grand hall, however, he slipped one hand out of the muff and grabbed at his skirt, hiking it up his leg to reveal a black leather stiletto. Harry thought it was a nice, theatrical bit of contrast.
“Make sure they don’t look too similar, I want them both to feel confident in these robes. But can you not make them too restrictive, please? Oh, this fabric suits you really well, Harry! Oh, I’m so sorry sir but I think you’ve made my husband’s sleeves too short- oh! And Harry hates anything with a high collar, so you may want to pick a style that doesn’t have--” she was interrupted by Harry and Ron’s simultaneous and pointed uttering of “
Draco couldn't abide this ridiculous Ball. Pansy had needled him into attending with her.
the amount of dress jargon...the fabrics i had to look up....
The dress had three layers of different colour fabrics - red on the very top, then an orange layer under that which reached the hips, then a yellow layer that formed the skirt. The layers were sloped diagonally across Malfoy’s body, forming an asymmetrical tango dress.
His anger continued to simmer as he watched Potter linger by the buffet table, stuffing his face, pacing like a caged animal.
Ugh… Draco definitely preferred blokes. But even if Pansy were a bloke, it'd still be pushing it.
“Of course they are Hermione, you’re passionate about what you do. People pick up on that stuff,” said Harry. Hermione pulled him into a tight hug and kissed his cheek.
And most of all, Draco loved him. He loved hearing him speak and speaking

The dress looked exactly like a stylised version of the duelling stage the two of them had fought upon as children. In second year, when Harry realised he could speak parseltongue.
Harry felt flustered all over again.
“Thank you,” he said. And he sounded… vulnerable. Almost fragile, underneath all that confidence and defiance and snootiness. Just a man. Just a boy. At the top of a very tall tower. With an impossible task. Making an impossible decision. With no decision at all really.
He scoffed outwardly, but found his mind wandering to the other man’s attire. It was the same dress robes he wore to the last ball. It still looked immaculate, and was still tailored to a perfect fit. Damn him.
“We were, but you really
Suddenly Harry felt like a teenager again.
"God that's snobby,” said Harry, “Who's Greengrass marrying then?” he asked.
Luckily Ron and Hermione didn't hear him. Not that he'd care if they did hear, of course. He was in awe, perfectly respectable and reasonable awe. Completely normal straight man, comfortable with his sexuality, appreciating the craftsmanship of the dress and the bravery of the act.
“Do you agree with her?” he asked. Harry pulled a confused expression, “Do you think I’m sweet? That I’m… not so obviously… disdainful?” Draco really worried about coming off too… stiff. Too impersonal and unapproachable. He wanted Harry to be comfortable around him, to not feel like he had to meet expectations that Draco simply… didn’t have.
“I’ve had it before, you boorish churl,” said Draco, quietly, not quite mustering the feeling behind the insult. He accepted the offered food, and savoured it. A peace offering, it felt like. Like in that British muggle religion. An olive branch to mark the end of the flood, a new beginning.
The note read simply:
“You’re right,” he said, “I don’t know the whole picture. But from what I saw, you and I were both cogs in a machine so much older than ourselves. Our lives, our purposes, planned out before we could have even hoped to have a say in the matter. And if you ever want someone to talk to about that? You know which Black House I inherited,” he finished with a shrug, sipping at his flute of champagne. Malfoy blinked a few times, long lashes fluttering against glittery cheeks.

Chapter 10, Heartbeats Echo In The Silence Between Lovers, from Draco's POV
“Thanks. I, um, I’m not usually this… affected,” Draco tried to sound put-together, he really did. But he was terrified of the rapidly approaching ball that night and Harry was in his dressing room, and Draco’s treacherous heartbeat refused to cease its staccato rhythm.
, he thought. Hermione was right, the designs were outstanding.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry thought about it for a moment. Purebloods were into all that over-the-top fanciness at parties, right? Of course, Malfoy was kind of doing a pantomime of all that, but still. How many purebloods would show up to try and spot Malfoy?
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco heard a ragged gasp. But it wasn’t… something wasn’t right. He opened his eyes to see Harry staring wide-eyed back. He resembled a deer in headlights. Draco’s stomach swooped, but this time he didn’t feel giddy or excited, he felt sick.
"It's essentially a celebration to mark a 'pure-blood' young woman making her first appearance in high society. Its purpose was to show she was ready for marriage. Nowadays, however, they're mostly just to celebrate engagements, whenever the lady chooses a suitor,” he explained.
"Oh,” said Harry, “I suppose I never considered that you had a choice."
Once Harry was gone, Draco mused on his life a bit, and he found himself remembering one of his mother’s old proverbs:
“No…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is that why you keep following me?” he continued, “Again," he added, eyes narrowed with malice. Potter continued to blink at him dumbly as he swallowed his food. Draco scowled harder. Potter spoke.
Taking place just before the events of chapter 4 (a new kind of attention)
Then, Harry’s hand actually moved, and Draco thought he’d pull the zip up and call it a day, but…
“Oh, I’ve done it before. A lot, actually,” said Draco, applying “falsies”.
Quickly, Malfoy was engulfed in flame, the ball guests cried out and fretted while Harry stood stock still, mouth agape.
Title based on So Emotional by THE Whitney Houston. Bc I accidentally quoted the title in the chapter, lol.

by his fate to slay Voldemort? Draco remembered his cold nights in the manor, clutching a muggle radio he kept hidden under the floorboards at night. He listened to Potterwatch; and on nights where he felt so sick with fear that he hadn’t eaten in days, and each time his stomach growled he feared discovery… he prayed to whatever dead things that would listen, for Potter’s success, for him to truly be the Saviour everyone thought he was. To deliver Draco from his torment, to rescue him like the knights from his childhood storybooks.
"Potter. Just 'getting along' does not a marriage make,” he said.
As he moved on to the other eye, he had to pull Harry’s arm further across his body, therefore bringing their faces incredibly close together. And amidst Draco’s internal distress, the thought of Harry engineering this situation himself again crossed Draco’s mind. He could feel the warmth of Harry’s face on his own, hear his quiet breaths and smell the barest hint of his shampoo. He found himself blushing furiously under his makeup and fought to keep a straight face and draw a straight line.
"What? No, I mean Malfoy, mate. He's snogging old pug-face," said Ron. Harry's blood suddenly boiled in that familiar way it always did when
“Until we get there, that is,” said Ron, “you know all those bloody awful purebloods are all crawling out of the woodwork now. There’s bound to be loads at the Gala,” Ron warned the little group.
But, as it was, he feigned a look of great concern when Harry suddenly remembered the mirror and met his gaze through it. Harry instantly looked guilty, so easy to read. Did he know Draco had seen him? He seemed rather… preoccupied. Draco met his friend’s stare, and wondered. The eyeliner… following him to all those parties… even just the way he

, a thought that summoned a furious flush to Draco’s cheeks under his makeup.
“Glad to see you’re having fun, love,” said Ron, as he approached the two.
Mini chapter (sorry😊)
"Ha!" Said Pansy, "as if you didn't see Potter go all bug-eyed when he saw us," she teased the boy.
Was Harry… engineering this scenario? If so… why? Draco forced himself to press on before he came to any… odd conclusions. He gripped Harry’s hand and complained audibly about the whole situation. As he drew the lines - which he had to concentrate extra hard on, since he was maneuvering a hand that

“Well, at least we know that - considering their intentions for ‘coming out of the woodwork’ -  they'll try to be civil. Probably,” said Hermione, trying to reassure the group.
TW: Grief/mourning
Just then, Hermione drew the curtain of the fitting room in her new dress. If Harry were to describe it in two words, he would call it: straightforward and elegant. He saw it as fitting for his best friend. It was short and white, with a pencil skirt that ended just above the knee. From the bust area up to the high neckline, the fabric changed to a sheer fabric with simplified petals over it; because on the rest of the dress, were flowers in various shades of darker blue.
Red jewels that looked like rubies littered the whole dress in a scattered pattern that clustered around Malfoy’s waist, where the fabric hugged close to his body…

“You really
"The dress is--" and he couldn't help the way he stopped for a moment. Because he had meant to say 'lovely'. But just then Draco (when did Harry start calling him by his first name?) caught his eye and smiled. Smug and red with lipstick to match the rest of the ensemble. He winked at Harry, face sparkling with some makeup product or other ”--
Malfoy’s heels clicked loudly, as all he did next was walk into and across the hall, in the direction of the buffet table. The feathers shifting and no-doubt tickling his chest, and arms - and legs -  as he went, and the hanging sleeves fluttered lazily in his wake.
Fuck. Why on that day, of all days, did Draco’s hands have to
He reacted, alright. His eyes twitched before glossing over slightly, and Draco just about heard him audibly swallow. Heat flooded Draco’s skin, and it took everything in him not to

An impossibly warm touch. Harry’s hand on his. He stared at it. Harry held it more firmly, and they traded steps forward until they were… well, they were holding hands.
He knew Potter was watching. Such an extravagant display was as much for his eyes as it was the other guests’. He scanned the hall and, just as he suspected, Potter stared intently, mouth agape.

And it took Harry a moment to realise that Malfoy wasn't really wet (most likely from an Impervious). The only signs that he wasn't actually soaked were that; his make-up wasn't running; and as he walked across the hall, the floor remained perfectly dry. Harry caught himself longing to touch - just a bit, just for a second - to really tell for sure that it was all spellwork and clever styling.
Well, Harry understood. He'd never seen someone look so free. Such freedom would've exhilarated Harry beyond hope, but Draco remained the picture of poise, slowly and deliberately taking each step.

When they both returned to the Slytherin common room Pansy looked smug, and Draco seemed utterly

“Went on a quick ten laps around the hall, did you? You look knackered,” he replied politely.

The left side of the skirt would have sloped all the way to the floor, but where it tapered into a fine point was caught in a ring on Malfoy’s middle finger, and thus the skirt moved dynamically as he walked.
“Well I’m still skeptical,” declared Ron, taking a bite of a Jammie Dodger (his new favourite muggle biscuit, next to custard creams).
"I know
“Harry, are you alright?” Draco asked as gently as he could, barely keeping the worry out of his tone. He reached out with his hand, it was meant as a comforting gesture. Harry looked at it like it was the bone-thin claw of a dementor. He flinched. Draco felt his insides twist in shame and guilt and confusion and fear.
Harry wanted to say that wasn’t true. He wanted to tell Malfoy just how much of his journey, his struggles, had been witnessed by Harry. But he didn’t. Because they weren’t friends. They didn’t know one another that way.

“Flooed straight over,” Harry explained with a twinkle to his eyes.
“But what if--” he began.
From Malfoy’s ears hung two golden earrings, in the shape of serpents. And his face - now less pointy and more…

“Shame I was never there to laugh at you,” said Harry, in jest. Draco shoved him playfully. In the process his dress slid off of one shoulder, reminding Draco that it needed fastening at the back.

Harry gulped, even though his mouth felt dry, and cleared his throat.
“If you asked me ten years ago, I would’ve denied I ever did such fanciful things, let alone answer the question,” said Draco. Then he took a fortifying breath and looked Harry directly in the eyes, “but yes. Yes I was,” he said fiercely. If Harry was going to reject him, it was now or never.

It made Harry's breath catch, and the grip on his glass of champagne tightened.
Suddenly, something came bursting to the surface of the water, and the guests erupted into uproarious applause at Draco Malfoy. Elegant as ever, Malfoy stepped out of the pool. And Harry realised that his dress was styled and charmed to look, and behave, just like a real waterfall. The clear blue current cascaded down Malfoy’s lithe form and pooled on the ground like real water, it even glistened and glinted in the light in the same way. The whole garment was thin and lightweight; it clinged in all the right places and flowed in all the others. White fabric resembling seafoam adorned the asymmetrical neckline and bubbled realistically with the ‘tide’. Malfoy’s entire right leg was exposed and he wore the loveliest satin heels, with jewels placed in a way that looked like bubbles.
“I believe you,” he said.
“Thanks,” said Draco, shakily.
“Am I some sort of spectacle to you?” said a posh voice. Harry jumped and whirled around, only to choke on his biscotti when his face ended up inches from that of a rather pissed off (and gorgeously made up) Malfoy.

When he started scraping the surface of his tongue with his fingernails, Pansy spoke up.

“Mm, indeed,” said Pansy.
This was from Draco Malfoy. This was the gauntlet being dropped at his feet.

“Make sure you move the zip slowly so it doesn’t get stuck or break,” he explained to Harry, who hummed in acknowledgement.
“Twelve years of combined classical dance tutoring - emphasis on ballroom, line, and tap,” said Draco. It was true.

“That’s positively deranged,” said Draco.

Potter looked slightly taken aback, and then he smiled… he smiled so warmly it made Draco want to cry again.

Was that what he did? Did he not hold tightly enough to Potter? Was he too distant? Too cold?
I refuse to change the name of this chapter.
"You heard me," said Pansy, "Potter."
“What a load of bowtruckle piss,” he scoffed, dropping the Prophet on the glass table before the three of them. It was all tripe, the lot of it. The sentiment was probably true, someone like Potter did all his best lying with a truthful scaffolding, but still. He’d seen Potter at every one of those balls. Coincidence his arse.

He opened the envelope. Inside was an excerpt from the Prophet of the interview he did with that nervous bloke, and a note.
“Right, so sorry, this is your job, you know what you’re doing. I’ll just, um… do you mind if I use the fitting room to try on my dress?” she asked the tailor. He grunted his approval, and Hermione swept out of the room with her covered dress in her arms. The tailor muttered something along the lines of ‘anything for quiet’. Poor chap.
low neckline that only tapered off at about midway down Malfoy’s chest. The hemline was covered with soft, red, ostrich feathers that whispered against the exposed skin.
Harry was also not quite sure why he continued to attend these events.
My inspiration is ever so slowly returning to me!
And Malfoy was still kind of right - because how much of his struggles, his suffering, had Harry missed? How much of it was known only to the beautified man in front of him, and no other soul? How heavy was the burden of the knowledge, locked away like a shameful secret, never to be unearthed?
Harry hated this ridiculous Ball. His robes were too tight around his neck so he'd loosened his tie, Ron wouldn't stop complaining, and he didn't at

Ron smacked him squarely across the back of the head.
Draco had always known Potter to watch him with a certain intensity, but he’d always thought that was hatred, he’d never even considered it could be… focus. To be focused on so intently, to be scrutinised so heavily, tied Draco’s stomach up in knots. He swore he must’ve been flushing scarlet.

He found himself practically dancing about the kitchen, making dramatic proclamations of how hungry he was, the banter flowing easily between them. Harry suggested a “takeaway” (and then promptly explained to Draco what exactly that
Draco, for his part, reached for the gift, tightening the binding on Harry’s own wrist. Again, the gift was extravagant and jewel encrusted. Draco pulled the blade from the sheath and took a breath at the pattern the blade sported; spots and swirls of contrasting shades of grey, almost like the knife had been dipped in a stream and left to dry.
“He’s a baby. He wouldn’t understand so he wouldn’t gain anything.” Draco pursed his lips. “And I do talk to him.”
Harry struggled internally. "No."
It was Harry's turn to hum. In the two days since he'd done very much the same thing to Malfoy he'd gone into work to look up Malfoy's file and all his goings-on. There was scarcely anything there, just a few incidents of spotting the man in Diagon Alley that the prophet had found scandalous.
Draco swallowed.
Harry recognized him. Even after years of trying to forget, he recognized him.
Harry had felt shame before, or at least he thought he had. He'd made mistakes. He'd gotten people hurt. But therapy had made him realize how... normal his mistakes were, and had also made him realize he'd felt shame for things that were never his fault to begin with.

“…and with new vows, new history is born.”
feeling rude, and felt a bit competitive over the graciousness he’d been shown by a Malfoy) he noticed Teddy hugging the kitchen door, scrunching his face up as he “eavesdropped” on their conversation.
He'd been trapped for a while.
They lapsed into silence once more, though much more companionable than Harry had ever achieved with Malfoy. It was very strange.
Malfoy twitched. “We’ll start with supper.”
Draco swallowed down his bile and spared his mother a smile. It stretched his skin uncomfortably and Draco already felt exhausted, imagining the next few hours where he’d have to muster a smile for those much less deserving than his mother.
“I’m sorry, love,” Draco said helplessly, “but just give him a chance, okay? Please?”
"That was it." Malfoy took a sip, unencumbered by the heat.
Harry rubbed behind his neck. “I know this will be, uh, awkward, “ he gestured with his still bound hand, “but it’s just for tonight.”
Harry nodded. “Yes. Is that okay with you?”
it,” he said at last, finally forcing out some kind of defense.
A flash of red had Draco closing his eyes. A phoenix embroidered in Potter colours stretched the length of the cape, the bird beginning at Draco’s shoulders and the trail of wings flowing into flame the further down it went. It was the ancient symbol of the house of Potter, but it rang more potent with the current state of the lands than it ever had before. That a Malfoy should wear this creature spoke leagues. Draco hated it.
“I wasn’t.”
“I don’t know where you get off,” Malfoy fumed, working himself up, “but I shouldn’t have to explain to you why showing up out of the blue to someone’s home is rude, let alone
Immediately Harry backed off, picturing the scene Teddy must be witnessing and letting Malfoy off the door. Malfoy sneered at him, but the tension was back in his shoulders.
“Oh, dear,” Draco whispered, picking Thomas up upon insistence. “You are such a suck.” Thomas absolutely did not care, rubbing his face against Draco’s the whole trip to the bedroom.
The old man in charge of leading the ceremony took the cloth Draco had carried up the aisle and Draco settled in, knowing his part would be much later in the ceremony. Apparently Potter weddings meant one long droning speech about history and the meaning of life. Draco tuned it out.
Draco knelt, keeping his hand in Potter’s.
His magic hadn't been the same after Voldemort. It had felt like a rubber band that was stretched for too long, and now that the pressure was off, it was too big. There was too much to hold onto and it slipped out if he forgot about it for just one second. It was like his magic was angry, but it wasn't. It was just too big.
"He's your cousin," the woman spoke like she was reading from a form, "his grandmother is your mother's sister."
"How," Harry choked, "I'm his godfather. You know this."
After such an offer, given completely against Harry’s expectations, he’d determined to be completely open to any conclusions he could draw about the life of one Draco Malfoy and his ward. Maybe Malfoy was torturing bunnies out in the shed, or maybe he was actually father Christmas in disguise. Both extremes could be a very real possibility, as Harry had forced himself to believe. He was walking into unfamiliar territory and it was simply his duty to observe as rationally as he could. Unbiased. A truthful account with no lingering opinions on Draco Malfoy or this absurd situation. Like an auror.
Harry made his way towards the bed, blowing out candles on his way over. Draco, slow to react, felt the binding grow taught and his arm raise involuntarily. Harry paused at the tension and Draco’s shoulders climbed into his ears. Before he could take a step his hand jerked as the binding was pulled and Draco stuttered forward, head jerking up to see how Harry’s hand was grasped around the binding.
1. There is no magic in this universe *wink* in the regard that magic is a lost art that no one believes is real yadda yadda usual medieval au stuff
Draco shivered, and felt a hand on his arm. He turned to see Harry propped up on an elbow. “See?” he said, completely nonsensical.
Draco hummed, relaxing into his chair. For the first time Harry got the impression that it wasn’t just Teddy who was brimming with happiness at the new addition to the household. The cat in question was currently making chirping noises at their feet, rubbing up against their legs. Teddy made a sad comment about how he was used to begging for food which prompted Malfoy to say that under no circumstances was Teddy to feed his prime cut roast that he’d spent forever on to an animal. Teddy then said that, if the meal truly was in honour of Thomas, then of course he should have a piece. Draco put his foot down and said Teddy was absolutely not to give the cat his food. Teddy passionately argued against him. Harry ate.
Harry choked. “His hair-”
The bands stopped playing and a silence went over the crowd. Obviously everyone had been waiting for this moment. Draco wanted to disappear at the eyes flickering over to him, knowing looks and smirks being exchanged.
As they neared the great hall his two friends quietly left him to enter first and take their seats, the titters Harry heard from beyond the door dying when they entered and a respectful hush took its place. The servants fanned his cape out behind him then bowed and left, turning to the adjacent stairs where they would watch the ceremony from the balcony above with the other common folk. The nobility would be on the ground floor with his friends taking a place of honour near the front.
bringing tears to his eyes. He shouldn’t be here. Draco was bred and raised to become the monarch of his own kingdom, with his own wife to take his name. This, this
Harry had an answer, an answer he'd allowed himself to have without shame. He'd been sick. He'd been trapped. He'd been swamped with too many damn funerals to count and it had all been too much for a teenager fresh out of a war.
“Oh, wow.” Harry gaped at the floral china and neatly arranged table linens. The meat was already carved, picturesque slices lined up and covered in some kind of gravy. Accompanied was a lovely blue casserole dish full of mashed potatoes that appeared to have been double-baked, and a matching ornate platter with a deliberate arrangement of green beans. Fancy glasses full of water sat in the corner of each table setting (except Teddy’s, his cup was neon orange and very obviously unbreakable) and a low vase full of daisies sat right in the center of the table, completing the look.
“Okay.” Draco choked out, not believing his words even as he spoke them.
“You can’t be.” Teddy decided.
“I’m begging you here,” Harry scowled, “genuinely begging you to stop.”
The woman sighed. “We’ll try more relatives, but if no one takes him in then we’ll just have to care for him until a spot opens up at an orphanage.”
Harry nodded sagely. “Yes, that does make sense.”
“Thank you for telling me the truth,” Harry said finally. He cut off any room for a response by blowing out the light, pulling the covers over himself and turning his back to Draco.
Malfoy was panting, growling in his grip and making jerking movements to try and break free. He kicked behind which Harry dodged.
Harry grimaced, cooling slightly. The issue, the one he’d been dancing around in his head for the last hour of the film, is that confronting Malfoy with all of this seemed dangerously vulnerable. Inching much too closely to a heart-to-heart than Harry wanted with the man. He needed Draco’s permission to do so much that he wanted to do with Teddy, but being forced to consider Draco an authority in this matter still made him squirmy. Malfoy had been more than accommodating, and that was an absolute fact Harry forced himself to swallow. What Harry wouldn’t give to know what was running through his mind about this whole matter. What he wouldn’t give to know what he’d been thinking six years ago when he’d taken Teddy on.
Malfoy sighed, averting his eyes with a faint pink in his cheeks. “He saw the people on the telly do it. He’s going through a phase.”
Harry smiled painfully at the woman, taking her hand in a shake and sitting himself opposite the tiny, cluttered desk she sat behind. It seemed like too much work for such a small desk, let alone one woman.
that a recently married couple will have sex, but most definitely not in our case.”
“I just mean,” Teddy gurgled, his muggle toothbrush buzzing away in his mouth and distorting his words, “that’s a whole day! Gone!”
“All rise for his Royal Majesty the King; Harry James Potter!”
Breathing twice, he knocked gently then stood back. Stood tall. Good fucking Merlin what was happening-?
for what would happen next.
Malfoy walked off before Harry could reply, hurrying into the kitchen where the clatter of ceramic soon followed. Harry stared, but quickly shook off the entire scene as Teddy came sprinting back to him.
She stared at him, gauging his reaction. He had none to give.
Draco nodded, not able to find his voice. The room was a sea of children, all only babes, and all trapped in the same rudimentary bassinets. It looked like they'd been mass conjured.
There was blue in other areas as well; on the clasps, small panels in the sides (almost completely covered by the tunic) and other such things, but Draco could barely stomach to look at them. The colour clashed with the red of his soon-to-be husband’s house, turning his beloved blue into an almost grey colour, sucking the life out of it and making it seem like a dead husk next to the bright crimson. It felt like a perverse foreshadowing to the marriage Draco was about to enter into; Potter turning Draco into something other, taking all that was special about him and draining it.
Now it was Hermione’s turn to smile sadly, getting to her feet and abandoning the papers at the writing desk. “You’re a romantic, Harry,” she said, fiddling with his collar when she got close, “to have to commit to someone you don’t love? I just don’t think you’ve understood how much it will hurt you.”
“Being dramatic,” Draco deadpanned, “I don’t think she’s even capable of being anything but.”
Like Draco knew he would, Teddy’s anger quickly turned to tears. Great heaving childish sobs that choked his words filled his small bedroom and made Draco’s heart clench as it always does. Teddy was one for tantrums, even though he can be very polite, and like all his emotional outbursts Draco just leaned in and held him. Not saying anything, leaving the space open for Teddy to communicate, Draco rubbed his back and let his shirt get wet under Teddy’s cheek pressed to his shoulder.
“I’m not-” Harry exhaled, counting to ten in his head.
“Thank you, very much.”
“Come on,” Harry said, pulling at Draco’s hand and now he realized they’d been stopped because the entrance to the room was directly in front of them, Harry confidently taking hold of the handle and almost propelling Draco inward with how eager he seemed.
The voice was heavily accented french and belonging to the young woman with absurd spectacles and a massive piece of parchment floating next to her, quill poised.
“He really does.” Teddy interjected, making both Harry and Malfoy swivel their heads to him. “He takes classes for it.”
“Hi,” Harry said tentatively.
“And you’re not exactly mine.” Harry retorted, but his heart wasn’t in it. The inherent dislike regarding Malfoy was juxtaposed to their situation, leaving Harry grappling to form any kind of opinion.
“And that situation is..?”
Not understanding, Draco said nothing, and the silence stretched between them. Potter stared at him expectantly and Draco felt sweat break out across his brow. Was he supposed to…offer himself? His throat went dry and his hand twitched. That was not at all how this was supposed to go and  Draco felt frustration rise in him once again.
In all the millions of scenarios Draco had refused to let himself entertain, this was never one of them.
Her attempts didn’t quite work considering Harry had taken his hand, rising to his feet and gesturing expectantly. Draco rose to his feet and his mother’s hand fell off his knee.
"He was my family."
He'd been given the kiss.
“No,” Draco said finally, “I don’t think I would have.”
“I-” Harry choked, collecting himself. “I’m his godfather.”
His mother was unperturbed, casually flipping through the prophet. “Why don’t you consult one of the books you bought, Draco?”
Harry felt Hermione settle the metal on his head and step back. He rose.
“I’m coming!”
Harry rounded the corner of the bannister, only to be blindsided by the still unusual sight of Draco Malfoy in full muggle regalia, hands shoved in his Jean pockets looking distinctly chived off. "Oi Mate! There's a prat here to see you!" Ron cried from the bottom of the stars, jerking a thumb behind him at the visitor.
Horrifically, his mother let a few tears shed before swiping quickly and returning to composure.
All thoughts to this ended when the court marshal cried; “Announcing his Highness Prince Draco Lucius Malfoy!”
"Of fucking course there wasn't any paperwork! His parents died in the damn war that took over the ministry."
It was an important part of him that shouldn’t be scorned or even omitted. Fuck, how much had Draco told him about his parents to begin with? Had he even told him anything? Maybe Harry was biased and certain facts about their lives shouldn’t be told to someone this young, but Harry had grown up without any stories about his parents and he wouldn’t wish that on anyone. Did Malfoy even know any stories?
"I talked to you over floo, Mrs. Marge? About Teddy Lupin?"
Teddy’s lip twisted, but didn’t seem that offended. He turned to Harry. “You’re coming back again?”
His mother laughed. “Well? Introduce yourself properly, Draco.”
Draco though deliriously. Maybe Draco could cut out the middle-man and put himself out of his misery as soon as his mother was off. If things continued like this Draco would cause a new war by breakfast.
"You're not in trouble," Malfoy said quickly, "but you need to go to your room while I deal with our guest."
His solicitor had put together a case for him, as well as his mother. But while Lucius Malfoy was a big fish and had his trial almost immediately, Draco wasn't held to the same regard. He spent months in that cell, months to cry and bang his head against the wall and eat the repulsive toast they kept forcing through the door’s slot.
Malfoy had nodded to this, hashing out the details for the specific time while Harry put on his trainers. Before Harry could ask if he should bring anything (he
"Why now?" Malfoy asked, his tone much lower than his usual biting remarks. "It's been years."
Harry looked up from behind his hands. “A comfort?”
2. This is going to feature a Lot of lore, because a lot of the tension comes from the disparity in culture between the two
. That the nonsensical idea of Malfoy stealing Teddy away was surrounded by context that Harry had no knowledge of. The Draco Malfoy he knew was a prat, and might still be, but the person who lounges in front of the telly in muggle jeans could never, ever be mistaken for the boy who’d preached pureblood nonsense every week like sermon.
“Oh.” Draco said in a strange voice, wrapping arms around the creature. “Oh you are
The nerves he’d been doing such an excellent job at avoiding flared brightly up his spine before Harry shoved them back down again, folding imaginary creases down his robes.
The bed shifted as Harry sat up, creating a looming dark shadow right next to him. Draco unconsciously shuffled away.
Harry recognized the dismissal, but the new monster is Harry’s chest reeled. “I can’t leave without-” he didn’t know how to end the sentence.
Harry swallowed his bite. “Do you?”
That wanker.
"I-" what did he want? "I want to make sure Teddy's safe."
Harry raised his cloak and Draco ignored the pink that rose in his cheeks as he ducked underneath it, quickly coming out the other side and cursing uncouth barbarian traditions that, if only for a moment, had Draco pressed between the stifling heat of Harry’s back and his cape. Harry had hopped over the slack of the silk and before anyone knew the wiser they had righted themselves and started their trek outside of the great hall to the open garden, soon to be followed by everyone inside.
Harry nodded slowly, gesturing for a court servant to take the gift off his hands. With barely a pause Parkinson turned to Draco and dipped her hand into her own pocket. Harry tensed, but a small dagger was quickly extracted and presented to Draco by Parkinson herself, her servant cautiously waiting behind her.
“Out of the way, my lady,” the seamstress waved. Draco’s jaw clenched tighter at the disrespect. Mother rolled her eyes.
Teddy shrugged. “He’s coming back again?”
Hermione stared doubtfully.
“Yes, yes, I Know.” Draco replied noncommittal, herding Teddy to bed half-desperately.
him out of the house. "Get out!"
Harry exhaled. “I want to be in his life.”
"I, um-" Harry stuttered, "I'm very sorry for dropping in so suddenly, but I felt I had to explain myself in person."
Harry nodded, letting himself be examined with all the grace he could muster considering the circumstances.
“Draco?” Harry asked, “If I had gotten…demanding. If I had made you bleed-” Draco’s eyes snapped to Harry’s, the tension in his body returning as quickly as it had left “-would you have used the knife? To defend yourself?”
him was the right word, as Draco didn’t really speak. He simply hummed and dropped an “oh?” here or there to keep his mother talking, but never engaged. And he certainly didn’t talk to Harry.
Feeling an embarassed pinch in his chest Draco hunched his shoulders, but when he looked up at his mother she had returned to her prophet, unconcerned at Draco’s actions.
"So," Harry began, shuffling awkwardly.
The file ended up being an overzealous apothecary manager (not owner! The notes from the ministry agent who’d taken the initial case notes exclaimed) to a rural wizarding community who was absolutely certain supplies had been stolen, but seemed to have misplaced sale records for Harry to match to the original order records. The manager had instead sent ten months of backlogged records to prove how detail-oriented they were, and therefore the unprovable crime was true because they could be trusted to be kept fully aware of their stock. Basically Harry was being forced to investigate a crime that most likely hadn’t happened with an overzealous client for an essential business that cannot afford to be disrupted in a small community.
Teddy’s eyes narrowed further and he scoffed, reaching up to grab Malfoy around the neck and whisper something in his ear. Malfoy smiled at him, but it was subdued.
Instead he let himself search the crowd for his mother, finding her only two rows back from the front. A high honour, considering the amount of dignitaries in attendance. Pansy would be almost near the very back of the room and Draco regretted not looking for her on his way in. His mother caught his eye, and in that special way of hers she both scolded him to focus and commiserated with him. But Potter’s hand was just a bit too warm and the hall, despite the crowd, a bit too cold.
Draco’s face twisted up but before he could say anything a hand came down on his. Draco snatched it back.
“Ack!” Draco screamed, hefting Teddy up as he burped.
Draco scowled, angling himself and Teddy away from her. He took a breath. “My name is Draco. I think you knew that. Well,” he considered, “you probably don’t know that, but it’s been said before.” Draco frowned. “I guess I haven’t actually ever introduced myself. How inappropriate.”
Marge had nothing to say to that.
Harry straightened his back, the phantom pain of Hermione’s pinch twinging, and remembered how they’d rehearsed it. Do not frown, but do not smile either. Walk slowly and deliberately. There will be bowing, and he’s just going to have to suffer through it.
That was why he was here, standing on Andromeda's stoop for the first time in six years, flushed pink and hoping to see his godson for the first time since his parents' funeral.
"What do you want then?" Malfoy asked, putting his teacup in its saucer and sitting straighter.
It hadn't felt like six years.
Harry wondered, as he reached the raised podium and turned to face the room, if they would add this occasion to the stone. Then he remembered that he was the one who would have to make that decision.
Draco wasn't a person in their eyes. He didn't think for himself, he didn't have values or beliefs. He was a child who had followed his father blindly. He'd never been genuine. He'd never cared about the cause.
Both startling and frustrating, Draco finally understood why the guards barely heckled him or why the prisoners on either side of him barely gave him a second glance. Why his father was dead while his trial was still months away. Why his solicitor always gave him a pat on the arm and confidently assured him he would be okay. Because he would be. Because people didn't care.
“I- well I don’t,” Draco stuttered but then the baby squirmed, letting out a whine as he struggled awake.
Harry ignored him, fully aware at the abysmal state of his home. “Ron, er,” he said instead, “could you go get supper? I need to speak to Malfoy.”
Harry scowled, showing the first bit of anger Draco had seen from him yet. Draco rose up on his elbows, tensed for whatever would happen next.
“Your Majesty?” his court marshal asked, almost begged, from over his shoulder, “shall we continue with the gifts?”
Taken aback once more Harry barely had time to process the words before Malfoy cut in.
Harry yelped and pushed her away when a voice came from the doorway. “Well, don’t you look dashing.”
"Are you going to calm down or an I going to have to stun you." Harry grit out.
Draco locked his jaw, letting her words settle in the luxurious yet somehow cramped hotel room. Carefully, Draco re-arranged Teddy to be facing him, balancing his feet on Draco’s thighs.
Malfoy nodded. "Melinda is the only one who knows our address, barring you now of course. I never take Teddy with me to the wizarding world so no one even knows I have him. There aren't any proper wards around the house, being muggle, but I've put up enough rudimentary wards that have sufficed. The ministry wouldn't let me keep Teddy if he wasn't safe. Is that it?"
Malfoy made a noise. “They are, but I wanted Teddy to have muggle friends. And it’s an easy way to give me some rest from his antics.”
Risking a glance back Draco tried to search out his mother, only to scowl as he saw how Harry’s cape crossed over his own, symbolic of their union as the practice had obviously intended. Harry’s red cape was on top and, stoking the fires of Draco’s inferiority, it was noticeably longer.
But more than that, more than the title of godfather, along with Potter came the threat that Teddy could be taken away from him.
Teddy whipped around to give Malfoy a smug look. “I told you!”
may be a political miracle but it had stolen everything Draco had been promised from birth, and it left him with duties and expectations he didn’t know how to handle.
“Um,” Harry said, adjusting on the covers, “do you want to?”
Marge swallowed, and seemed to press her hands together in prayer. "So, what you need to understand is that there were many orphans after the war. A true tragedy, but the ministry was swamped with weeding out death eaters and the like from their ranks. We didn't have the resources to care for all those children, and the orphanages were equally as strained. So, uh, any family that were eligible to claim the children were contacted." Marge's voice suddenly lowered. "I hope to impress upon you how difficult that period of time was."
“Yes, well, you can’t make people like you.”
"I won't put peas in the stew if I can put broccoli in." Malfoy said as he closed the gate behind them.
Malfoy muttered under his breath about strange little boys who enjoyed broccoli but Harry didn't catch it, as his entire world had turned on it's axis and plunged into fiery rage. How dare he? Who the fuck does Malfoy think he is, letting Teddy call him that? His real father is buried under the earth after giving his life to fight the man that the Malfoy's had fucking hosted in their home. The man Malfoy had served. The man who'd killed his parents. And he taught Teddy to call him "daddy"? Does Teddy actually think Malfoy was his father? Did Malfoy feed Teddy some lark about getting a girl pregnant and then abandoning them? Did Teddy even know about Lupin? About Tonks? About the war that killed them and the medals they got after their deaths? Did he know that the man he thinks is his father helped the people that robbed him of an actual family?
a bloody child.
“So you are thick,” Draco spit.
That was all the prompting Teddy needed to launch into the story of a poor orange tabby he and Malfoy had found digging holes in a park they went to. He embellished the tale like it was a daring rescue instead of the cat being somehow enchanted with Malfoy and following them on their way home. Harry settled down on his knees and listened attentively, thrilled at the set of circumstances that had his godson giving him his undivided attention and his good mood.
“Okay,” Harry sighed. Draco’s heart flew to his throat, but Harry continued, “okay. We’re talking about this.”
Harry stared into the unrelenting child eyes. “Why not?”
“I’d damn say so myself,” the seamstress muttered, backing up to take in Draco’s full attire. Draco almost sneered at the woman but collected himself.
“Soften your voice, dear. You have a man’s voice now.”
The new rage at hearing that term of address made Harry tighten his grip for just a second, just enough to make Malfoy whimper, and just enough to have the boy who'd appeared at the top of the carpeted muggle stairs just beyond the doorway crying out in alarm.
Draco swallowed thickly, then reached up and took off his crown, getting his first good look at the thing he’d worn for the last few hours. It was as described to him. It had most likely belonged to the late Potter Queen. Had she been where Draco was now? Uncertain and distanced from the man who would soon bed her? Had James Potter been more of a romantic than Harry was? Or had he done the exact same, utilitarian swiftness to get their clothes off as quickly as possible.
Draco flushed. “He just seems to like you better and I don’t know why.”
Hermione huffed, organizing the parchment in front of her in order of importance. Despite her undying quest to keep Harry unwed she’d dressed for the occasion, a simple pink gown worn with red accents. Her hair was another matter, strewn about as she repeatedly scratched her head. Normally Harry would be in the same state, but through tenacity (or, Harry suspected, witchcraft) Madam Malkin had tamed his hair into something presentable.
“I-” He couldn’t breathe. “Yes.”
An adult laugh sounded next to him and Harry glanced at Malfoy out of the corner of his eye. Maybe the strangest thing about this whole thing is that he expected a fight. He remembered Narcissa, he remembered the first moments of his re-awakening and the tinge of jealousy at her devotion to her child, even if the feeling barely registered in the moment. Even Lucius, though Harry hated to consider him for any extended period of time, was a devoted father. When he’d found out Draco had taken Teddy he’d been out of his mind with what-ifs, but the forefront of his fear had been about Malfoy passing on horrible plureblood shite. He hadn’t been
Restraining himself from impersonating Ron on Christmas Harry swallowed, carefully putting his fork down and taking a sip of water. A new philosophical question posed itself to Harry; is it possible that having Malfoy serve him delicious food would create an incentive to for Harry to forget what an absolute tit he’d been in school? Was this all a contrived and delectable slytherin ploy?
“Hurry up before the cat tries to escape.” Sure enough a chirping yowl came from the living room and the quiet padding of paws followed.
"So." Malfoy concurred, nodding his head.
(Which doesn’t mean Harry didn’t immediately search for any kind of documented information of Draco Malfoy post-war using his auror clearance. With the exception of unsubstantiated suspicious sightings in Diagon Alley, Malfoy had completely disappeared from the wizarding world.)
“Well,” he said, “I expect you’ll fuck me.”
“You look very handsome, dear.”
Months of enforced introspection.
“I’m Teddy’s godfather.” Harry spat out quickly, with an almost guilty desire to explain himself.
An older woman with red hair was quietly sobbing, pressing a tissue to her eyes as Potter spoke. In fact, as his words rang out across the hall, Draco could spot a number of wet-eyes and swoons from the crowd.
Harry recoiled. “I don’t want to be rude, but that is absolutely barbaric.”
"You're not serious."
“So, you go to a Muggle school?”
"You don't need to tell me, I was there." Harry said mildly.
“But from where I’m sitting,” Harry suddenly said, eyeing him up and down, “I really don’t think you want to.”
The address was a piece of suburbia in the quieter part of London, an area with less pubs and more parks. A fairly modern building, it had an an iron gate protecting the stoop, and a narrow slice of lawn where a child's bike lay on it's side next to a decent sized tree, all it's leaves already shed. It looked fairly new, but incredibly muggle as the whole building felt standardized. Plastic light fixtures and stickers of flowers in the windows and barbie dolls left dirty and broken in the soil nearest the stoop.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I suppose so.”
Teddy raved for a few minutes further, recounting a number of anecdotes around the cat (which had made it’s way back over to sniff curiously at Harry’s ankles) and Harry listened attentively to every word. He had been right about Teddy’s passion it seemed, he was so energetic. Were all children as spirited as Teddy was? Well, objectively that was probably the case, but watching Teddy zoom around as he gestured like a madman made Harry feel like Teddy was special.
Harry hesitated, glancing between his husband and the woman. “You may.”
Pansy never addressed him by his title, but today was such an occasion for formalities.
A lifetime of silences and quietly suffering his company stared him down. Harry swallowed.
“In my kingdom,” Harry spoke gravely, making Draco feel two feet tall, “there is no tradition that requires sex. Well I mean, yes, there is the
"Ah." Draco replied, mind carefully repressing memories of the only Aunt he'd ever met.
So he was sheltered and waited upon; Harry already knew this, had already known this before they’d gotten married. It made sense that he wasn’t pleased about the arrangement, that he was tense and quiet beside him. Then why did Harry feel so personally about it? Harry himself had felt twisted up about the whole affair, so of course someone with less experience with…life would feel even more nervous.
Harry flinched, internally wondering if the truth would have stopped it. Then wondering why he cared about Malfoy's respect.
There was nothing Harry could say to that, so he said nothing. His trousers were ruined.
“Kneel.”
Malfoy tried to put the cat down but it held on, somehow keeping furry arms trapped around Malfoy’s neck without digging too deep in with his claws. The cat nuzzled into Draco’s face, forcing him to tilt his head up to avoid the furry assault. It was…unfairly adorable.
“He does?” Harry asked at the same time Malfoy said a quiet “Teddy.”
That wasn’t entirely fair, if Harry was being honest. By all accounts the ceremony had been a smashing success. No one had tripped or fallen in any undignified way, no one had stuttered or mumbled their vows, and there had been no grand interruptions in an attempt to protect Harry from the evils of a political marriage. Ron, who had the dubious honour of sitting beside him at the head table, was even making an effort to express just how moved the crowd was by Harry’s voice.
Pink rose in his cheeks. “You know.”
I hope there are no missing patches, as Ive notice quite a bit of that lately. Ive done my best to beta but if any of you guys notice anything dont be afraid to lemme know and ill fix it! Anyways enjoy this chapter that has been ready for months but because of the *gestures vaguely* is only coming out now.
A pinched look distorted Malfoy's features. "Are you going to offer me tea, Potter? I imagine this conversation will take a while."
Luckily Malfoy didn’t have anything to say to that. He sipped his tea.
Thoughts of orphanages evoked wispy images of angry little boys who steal things that don't belong to them, and Harry quickly skittered away from the thought. At least Teddy wasn't in one of those places.
Hermione pursed her lips, but couldn’t object. The war,
Malfoy narrowed his eyes suspiciously, but had obviously also made some sort of deal with himself as Harry had towards peace since he decided to reply. “I did.”
“Supper! Put the film away, Teddy.”
Ron also looked quite dashing in his dark blue robes (slightly out of style, but his mother had made him wear them) but Harry new he was…a sight.
By late afternoon Harry was steady, relatively, and physically walked to Malfoy's place in his muggle clothes this time, eliminating the option of disapparating. He needed to see Teddy, properly. He needed to know him.
“So I’ll have to make nice with people who had tried to have me killed. It’s not like I wouldn’t have had to do that anyways.” Harry shrugged then grinned, gesturing at his regal robes. “Perks of being king.”
Harry sighed next to him and Draco just about jumped out of his skin, his mother’s hand flying to his knee to stall him.
“Did you always have a cat?” Harry asked, feeling awkward about being the only one standing.
Worse than rage, magic leapt from underneath Harry's skin, straining at his core and desperate to destroy the landscape around him. While Harry was desperate to undo what had clearly already been done.
Harry was panting, tearing at the fabric of his trousers in an attempt to spare the upholstery he'd been seated at in Andromeda's tea room. It was cluttered (and dirty), but the chaise was still fine quality. He couldn't damage it.
when he had the perfectly respectable excuse of not honouring his family’s traditions in that they would be in conflict with his new husband’s. Now he would have to…
By the end of the week Harry was beyond knackered. He hadn’t had time to consider what to get Teddy and certainly hadn’t had time to ring Malfoy to ask. Balancing the ego of a big fish in a small town was an exercise in patience Harry hadn’t even felt when dealing with an angry and vengeful toddler. Harry loved his job, it stimulated him and made him feel fulfilled, but public relations wasn’t exactly his favourite part.
“From this day onward,” the old man spoke to the crowd from behind Draco, “this man will be known as his Royal Highness Draco Malfoy Potter, and be granted the title of Prince Consort, legitimate husband to his Royal Majesty the King Harry James Potter!”
The servant girl approached first, holding a massive broadsword in its sheath. Already Harry could tell that it was lovingly crafted and carried small jewels around the hilt, if a bit plain in design.
“I mean it.” Harry said, taking another bite for emphasis. “This is amazing. Did you prepare everything, Malfoy?”
me.” Teddy hiccuped, and Draco cringed at the confusion in his voice. A new person in his life was always a bit of an adjustment, where Teddy would get extra sensitive and over react over little things like children do. But when Teddy said something scared him Draco usually took it very seriously. He would figure out exactly why it scared him and establish boundaries and comfort levels and sometimes just banish the thing from Teddy’s life entirely. When a scary dog reduced Teddy to tears when he was four Draco had just picked up Teddy and brought him home. When Teddy had been frightened by a friend’s much-stricter parents Draco had sat down with him and heard him out, just letting Teddy feel like he was being fair, and then let him work out that he would keep going to the friend’s house anyways. He’d always given him a voice, even if he’d not always done what Teddy wanted and Teddy must feel, well, at worst betrayed.
He ruminated in the carriage, with no Blaise or Pansy to distract him from his thoughts today. In truth, Draco was angry. Did Potter really just see him as the Mark on his arm? As if he had a choice…
“Um…” said Draco, dreading having to ask this of Harry. On the one hand, he was elated to have Harry so close to him, but on the other, the last thing he wanted was to make Harry uncomfortable or take advantage of him, “Actually, you wouldn’t mind helping me with this zip as well, would you? These damn gloves make it impossible to grab something so small, no matter how well they fit me,” he tried to justify the request to Harry, silently imploring him to not get upset.
Draco explained his two immediate conundrums in a huff. The eyeliner and the zip. He let a dry, self-deprecating laugh escape him; he could be so pathetic sometimes… HIs eyes began to sting.
"There's always a choice, Harry Potter," said Draco, with a private smile, a glimpse behind his defenses. Draco’s own olive branch. And a clap to the shoulder as he departed, just to feel the warmth beneath the man’s robes.
“And what exactly makes you so qualified to teach me how to dance? Posh people powers?” said Harry.
, I just thought miserable was a bit of an exaggeration that's all,” Harry attempted to explain his position, which only served to further baffle the blond.
Potter passed him some biscotti with créme fresh and spring onions. Draco blinked dumbly at the food.
he thought
Finally, Draco could get some answers. He felt a kind of nervous under-skin itch as he donned his garments. First the tango dress, then the decoy. The theme was duality, contrast in every aspect possible.
“Why don’t you use my hands?” Harry explained, “I’ll hold the liner, and you can guide my hand in applying the makeup,” he finished.
Draco cringed,
Harry stalking him again? Merlin, he was a mess…
Which led him to the scene unfolding before him. Of a toddler having been flooed to school twenty minutes ago, and a one year old sitting next to him, chewing on a campaign poster.
“You don’t know what I went through," said Malfoy. Red lips downturned and eyebrows scrunched in displeasure.
This chapter took place prior to Chapter 4: A New Kind Of Attention
Pansy spotted the address.
A nice long chapter after a couple short ones 😁
“I helped save the wizarding world too…” he muttered.
. Harry pretended to have been rendered mute, closing his mouth and humming what sounded like “oh no!” or “I can’t speak!”. They both laughed, and Draco put the mascara away.
look how far you’ve come,” the compliments and reassurance poured from Harry’s mouth and this time, Draco looked up. He saw an expression of fondness and determination. And a rare gentle smile, that made the bright shine of his green eyes stand out more than ever. Draco smiled back, as best he could.
Hope you enjoyed, there's plenty more to come 😉
"Where!?" He said. When he glanced at his friend, he saw that Ron was staring at him like he'd gone batty.
Ron turned his head in Harry’s direction, “Doesn’t this remind you of all those bloody political parties we had to go to after the war?” he asked.
Harry was so totally fucked, wasn’t he?
How barbaric, to rid the world of all evil things through death. Did Draco deserve such a punishment? Potter clearly didn’t think so, not now. He sensed something… shift.
Draco folded up the parchment and the newspaper cutting, and put all three items in an envelope which he hastily sealed with string (he hoped forgoing the wax seal wouldn’t cause any issues). He scribbled the address onto it, and chose his fastest owl, tying the envelope to his leg.
“My own personal amusement. Humour helps abate the nerves, you know,” Draco explained, suppressing a smirk. He was feeling better already.
Draco looked away quickly, cheeks aflame.
“She was… kind. Wasn’t she?” said Draco, attempting to voice a concern of his.
Draco felt strength pour into him, and he continued speaking. “Since I started pulling stunts though… and working with Hummingbird, and--” he squeezed Harry’s hand, he wanted to say
- Harry’s lips brushing his own. Incredibly soft and warm…
“Well,” Harry admitted bashfully, “I have an invitation to the Ministry Of Magic Congenial Quadrennial Gala…” he said. Hermione lit up.
He mostly just sat and moped while everyone besides him, Ron, and the Patil twins danced.
... prepare yourselves.
“Really?” said Harry. Draco made a noise of affirmation. Draco saw Harry pick up a tube of lip gloss out of the corner of his eye and do a perfect Swish and Flick. Draco chuckled. Well, truth be told it was more of a giggle, but who’s going to judge him?
(See the end of the chapter for
It was then that Ron swooped back into the living room of their cottage, to the rescue, armed with Hermione’s cup of tea. She kissed him on the cheek in thanks, and took a long, slow sip. And a long, slow breath.
at Draco and
“I didn’t mean it like that!” he said, slightly panicked, “I just don’t believe that you would find it that difficult to get along with Astoria Greengrass, weren’t you friends at Hogwarts?” said Harry.
, it's the perfect opportunity! You promised you'd help me!” she pleaded with Draco.
, he thought he deserved
“Not like I’m going to give it to anyone anyway, is it Pans?” said Draco. With a few sharp gestures of his wand, he sliced out the interview from the Prophet.
“I’ll be waiting amongst the crowd,” said Harry, “your audience awaits.” Then he hugged Draco (he did that a lot) and the blond melted like so much goo into his embrace.
(What a stupid summary smh)
staring!" Said Harry.
“Uh,” he began, eloquently, “you were right, Hermione, the dresses are…” he trailed off -
to bear his emotions on his sleeve, and Draco would always have the uncomfortable urge to cut open his skull and rummage around in his brains.
Ordinarily Draco would melt, but he was still apprehensive. And disbelieving.
If the cliffhanger was the wound itself, this chapter is the equivalent of a whole bucket of salt. Prepare to hurt.
Draco was beet-red at this point, and looked pleadingly at Harry, who obligingly came to his rescue. Caron toned it down once she knew Harry could hear, and the rest of their chat was nice. She also chatted to them briefly when she delivered them their food. She gave Draco an open invitation to her shop, and was very kind. Also very
Chapter 13 from Draco's POV, poor baby🥺
to torment Potter about this, in the morning.
Literally
a fulfilling relationship at some point in my life, Potter. And a marriage to a woman - to whom I, a gay man, would be expected to be faithful to
The Potter boy pleaded with his eyes, but offered no explanation. “You'll see, when you get them. They are under the floor boards, where... where I...” He could not say it, and Severus understood.
Severus understood if involuntarily. For the time being it probably felt as if his return had only continued his suffering. “What have you seen then?” he distracted the boy.
Hearing him was a torture right now. The voice, though no longer near inaudible, was rough and scratchy, reminder of the recent past.
Potter gives a little moan, both the Slytherins find quite enticing. Then, as Draco works his neck, his head falls back, giving Theo perfect access to do the same to his shoulder. Their hands start exploring, a dance, practiced ever so often, until it works perfectly. Honestly, the two of them work better without Blaise. He can be so overeager, hogging everyone's attention. Draco can be a selfish bitch, Theo know that, but appreciates and rewards a good partner. And driving Potter insane is a worthy cause for their combined efforts.
Then Severus went on to speak with his godson who was clearly in need of some directions. The earful he wanted to give him withered away though when he entered the room and recognized how miserable Draco looked, sitting by his desk, hunched over the papers. He didn't even look up, when he breathed out: “I can't do it...”
When he entered, however, to everyone's utter disappointment there was nothing much to be seen. Neither Draco nor Potter had tried to kill the other, nor had there been any form of confrontation at all. Draco sat, writing intently on a piece of parchment, while Potter lay silent and unmoving, his heavy breathing the only evidence he knew of his company. Uneasily Severus studied them both and asked, with carefully measured indifference: “Did he speak?”
“I don't think this is a good idea, Severus,” he said. “I hate Potter. Potter hates me. What do you hope to achieve?”
For long moments silence washed over them, with Draco closing his eyes and sitting in silence to beat his unwilling tears into submission. With Severus watching him, feeling both relief and sorrow. With nothing else to do, to think, to plan.
“Trust is built in times of weakness, not of strength” Severus sighed. “If you fail to see, what Potter can be as a friend at least acknowledge, what he can be as a useful fool.”
Potter inhaled and relaxed visibly, his eyes closing, as he waved the wand, just once. Sparks fell from the tip, rose into the air and started dancing over every available surface, and were still less bright than Potter's eyes, when he opened them again, staring in awe at the spartan dark wand.
“Eventually...” Severus admitted.
Theo has the sudden feeling of urgency, feels, he cannot wait, until Draco gets there on his own. “What's up with Blaise? And where is Potter, Draco? Did you see him go?”
For best results he would need to provoke the exposure as soon as possible, so the best way to tackle the problem would be to relocate Potter and then allow his annoying soon-to-be-ex-friends to visit. Granger maybe would not drop of the radar. She had been surprisingly constant in her support, albeit just as blind as everyone else. The youngest Weasley son however was almost a safe bet. And the majority of the boys' dorm of Potter's year would follow down the same path as they had in the years past.
Severus heard Potter exhale, but by the lack of Draco's defiance, he figured it was not out of pity. “I'm sorry, you know? I am terribly sorry.”
Potter wouldn't know, but Severus could hear the lack of sincerity, when Draco feigned exasperation. “Fine. I have no classes. But I need to work.” He stopped shortly, adding then,in an afterthougt: “Potions essay.”
must kill you. Himself. And be aware he might torture you before that.” He forced himself to continue. “are you really sure you want to do that? The others are... gentler options.”
another chapter and the first without the help of my wonderful beta Raven. I hope, I still learned from their corrections and didn't mess it up to badly.
“I am thinking about it... in all actuality.” He stops, watching his hand, watching the room, watching the bed in near exasperation. “I really, shouldn't, should I?”
Potter falling asleep is no surprise after the ordeal Draco put him through. Neither is him crying. Theo practically bit off his nails the whole time, knowing, this was everything they agreed
That looked promising to Severus as it implied at least some improvement, while still being far from the mask the boy had put on for years. Severus was less enthusiastic at the sight of Draco sitting down next to Potter and putting a hand on his shoulder and again whispering softly into his ear. When the smaller boy even smiled, no, truly laughed out, the sound was scratching Severus' nerves in all the wrong ways. It was just too perfect, too relaxed, too familial. Something was going on and now he was sure he needed to confront Draco abut it, though clearly not instantly.
“Potter?” A pause. “Harry?”
“Now... what exactly happened to Mr. Weasley, well-deserved for continued irksomeness as it may be?”
The boy shrugged, oscillating between some kind of amusement, worry and relief. “Right into the topic, Professor? No. I haven't. The obvious aside.” He was by far more comfortable talking about this then the other part of the news yesterday brought.
“Room of requirement? Now?”
That makes sense, Theo thinks to himself, somehow at least. He still isn't sure, but some puzzle pieces fall into place now. Blaise's insistence on inviting Potter only to back out then. His disappearance for the evening. The fact that Draco is so completely of the rails... A potion can do that to you... Or an curse.
And still, in this particular setting, it would have come so handy, had Severus not already decided not to hurt the boy any further. Driving him away from Draco under the pretense of causing no more inconvenience. It wasn't an option anymore, and he felt the tiredness crashing down on him like a wave breaking.
This Potter used what little strength he had for study, the face always worried, the eyes dull and hollow, the demeanor meek.
And Potter noticed, damn his unsuspected attention. He dropped his eyes immediately, shivering involuntarily. He didn't dare ask but his shoulders sagged noticeably.
so... second part...
The Gryffindor gives an annoyed nod, the face scrunched up, the jaw just as firmly clenched as his fists just a moment ago. “No...”
Draco shrugged, this start of the conversation as welcome as any. “He took it easy enough.” Only Severus would ever have noticed the slightly off tone, the far to straight look in his eyes. Everyone thought liars were looking away... That was why they did not. And Draco's eyes on full display were an opportunity, if he ever saw one.
Even he feels more drawn to him than ever before. Feels a strange protectiveness that has nothing to do with the rules, they talked about. Potter actually, really, fully trusting them, Potter giving them all he had to give, that stuff doesn't leave even the most hardened Slytherin heart unaffected.
“Gentle...” Potter said dreamily. “Soothing. Calm.” Unmistakable longing soaked his words. Now at last he looked up to Severus. “There is no pain.”
No. That was exactly the mindset that had caused this situation. Albus' belief to do the right thing, his ultimate conviction that the ends justified the means.
When he awoke a few hours later, significantly recovered and glad the Dark Lord had at least chosen a Friday night for his antics, he summoned himself a meal from the kitchens, ignoring the official meal times for now. He then decided to tackle the problems one by one, starting with the obvious, Potter's burst of Dark Magic.
Instead, he decided, that beating Potter would result in nothing, and settled for something quite different, that most men found much harder to deal with. He let the cane fall, then mock-tenderly slipped one hand against Potter's jaw and into his hair, his other arm pinning the resisting body to his own. When he ran his tongue along the earlobe and dipped it in then, leaving wet traces in its wake, Potter's breath hitched.
That would be the wards then Severus hoped. Those could be easily discussed away.
Curious. No gloating, no bragging, no juicy details. Not at all Draco's usual way of telling things. Severus pondered questioning him further, calling him out on his lies and omissions. It was tempting and probably a good lesson for the boy. But tired and worn as he was and in this grave situation Severus lacked both time and patience, so he dove into his mind instead.
What? Theo frowns, looking at Draco in confused irritation. He had felt something building, after Potter's climax, but “magic hitting him” would not have been a fitting description, even when exaggerating matters.
In the meantime though, he was, again, alone with Potter, and again confronted with the undeniable signs of abuse, specifically the part, where the victim was forced into a mindset further establishing its helplessness to protect the perpetrator. It played so perfectly into Potter's hero complex, and would have desperately needed nipping the bud. Unfortunately, even now, Potter would not listen to him. And besides, what in Merlin's name could he really say?
It infuriated Severus, burned his insides with an anger incomparable to anything he felt before, deeper even than his grief for Lily. And no outlet but a dead body. And a boy.
Draco exhaled, the warm air caressing the same places, and whispered: “Everyone can take pain. Or likes to think so.” He changed his grip, running fingers along Potter's collarbone. “But this... and the humiliation, when you find out, I can make you like it...”
The boy watched him, first in anger, but as silence spread more thoughtful. “He would not go back like this... would he?” Severus nodded and let him think aloud further. “He would hate the stares, and there is no one there... for him. Right now.” Another nod reassured Draco further. “So... where would he go then?”
“Always my most devoted servant...” Voldemort praised his effort and nodded, already somewhat satisfied by the prospect of still killing Potter himself, after all. “You may go.” This was an order, Severus followed gladly.
Since the profits far outweighed the risk, he decided to give it a try. Due to his considerations he had lost quite some time and was now forced to hurry before classes. To save himself some trouble, he summoned a house-elf and ordered his breakfast brought to his room and pondered, if Potter was already capable of handling food as well. Sighing he decided against it for now. The massive injuries in his lower intestines needed some time to heal, to settle, even after the enormous amount of magic used on their repair. Potions would need to suffice for now.
Severus left the vision right there. He didn't need any more details of that. This was worse, so much worse than he could have thought. A relapse in everything that mattered. Only not in the one he had tried to avoid.
-oOo-
Draco on the other hand was overjoyed. He could contain it no better than his anger or grief before. He vibrated with nervous energy, suggesting to put Potter in one of the guest rooms for starters, so a healer could come and have a look at him.
I apologize ahead... please don't hate me for this chapter.
“I would” Severus scoffed. “If I saw any chance of your compliance.” It wasn't true though. If his initial surmise proved correct or even close to the real reason for Weasley's confrontation with his lack of sufficient defense and Potter's suspiciously slowly returning strength, he would need all the magic he could get hold of. And all the support. Oh, how he hoped to be in the wrong.
Just, when he was about to thoroughly prepare the potions for immediate use, Minerva spoke again, her tone clearly indicating, he would not like, what she had to say. “Potter can't stay here, in the Infirmary. Neither can he return to Gryffindor tower in this state.”
Poppy wasn't fooled. “How did you come to care for Potter's dignity so much, Severus?” she mocked gently. “ One would think you had a hidden agenda if you weren't such an honest, candid person...”
Almost tenderly Severus touched his jaw, forcing him to meet his eyes, letting him feel, hear, see, how he cast the spell. “Legilimens.”
It made Severus even more curious, but a simple raise of an eyebrow was enough to prompt further explanations. “He was hit by an simple burst of magic. It seemed to aim more for pain and intimidation than actual damage.”
“It's probably better then, that I didn't end up in Slytherin, after all... I am far too trusting still.”
He does notice the hands, slipping down, parting his cheeks though and freezes, stumbling over his own breath. “Hell, Malfoy...” He barely manages the words, so out of breath is he, the inhales and exhale coming in nervous little gasps.
The medi-witch froze in irritation. “What happened?”
Potter seemed to sigh to that, but did not comment on it. “Do you have time to stay for a bit?” Fabric rustled, intense breathing followed, confusing Severus to the point that he almost got up to go look for them, but then Potter continued: “You know... the potion. It was better with company. Hurts less with distraction.”
As Severus expected, his godson remained silent, while he summoned a house-elf and advised him to bring breakfast for two to his chambers. In an afterthought he added a request for something easily digestible for the Potter boy, knowing it was time to try to wane him of the sole supply by nutrient potions. He wasn't sure Potter's stomach was able to handle the food yet, but an attempt was in order.
“What is of such ultimate importance to justify the insolence you presently show, Ms. Granger?” he asked leaving no doubt whatsoever, he would accept no excuse for her disturbance short of immediate doom.
“You will go back directly to your room. You will not receive visitors. You will cast no spells, use no magic. You are allowed to read and do your homework, you shall summon a house-elf, if you are in need of something.” He congratulated himself on the decision to add a bathroom to Potter's room that had already come handy after he activated the wards.
Severus could not bear it any longer. Masking his flight with low-key annoyance he left Potter's room, deciding he was in just the right mood to face Albus now.
“Does it matter?” Draco asks in sudden heat, rubbing his face with both hands and jumping out of the bed, enabled by a surge of adrenaline. “He must have Potter!”
“We take care of each other, okay?” He sounds just as excited as Potter, his dream of years finally at arm's length.
If Severus had not sworn his soul to this cause already, to keep Draco safe, to help Potter through his task, to do whatever necessary, he would have now. They deserved that much, the convicted and the hopefully absolved. He didn't even find it in him to part them anymore. The damage was already done. Let them have what little comfort they could find in each other.
“Another.” That was clearly Draco. Then the clinking of cutlery. A sharp exhale and a little shuffle followed. “Sorry. I can't. No more.” Potter's voice, stronger than before, but still far from what it had once been, hoarser, a little forced.
Draco regretted, he had to untie Potter now, but a deal was a deal. And there was at least some chance, the other would not flee, what with being a courageous Gryffindor and all that crap.
Despite Potter's tendency to rush into things, he took his time to think. “Let's try it like this: Half an hour. More, if I don't step back, then.” The determination in his face was strangely alluring for reasons, Draco tried not to analyze to closely in fear, he might fight the same monster within himself as resided in his home, making it a living hell.
Severus decided to leave the matter for now. In this new light, the boy was truly better placed in his care, ironically. He did, however, intend to defy the rest of the headmaster's orders. It would take some more work, but if a storage room had to suffice, the one within his quarters was clearly better suited to provide room and care for a severely hurt child. In addition it might ensure both safety from and for Potter.
No better insult, than to simply let him stand him there, turn their backs, leaving him alone. And no better place to go than back to the room, where they can safely savor their price.
Whatever this was: it was both the darkest kind of magic and extremely powerful. The unforgiveables of lesser men paled to it. Few could cast at that level of power, fewer still had the knowledge matching it. In Potters case this left literally only one option. The Dark Lord had left the boy with a curse, either at their first encounter or later, at the graveyard or the mystery of magic. The earlier options seemed unlikely given the fast progression of the curse, but you never knew.
Nodding to himself he left the boys alone to set up a meeting between Albus, Poppy, Minerva and himself to try and discuss the conditions for Potter's return to classes and to the Gryffindors' common room and dormitory.
Draco grinned. “Perhaps.”
Though disappointing this was a valid point but it was one easily amended. “Kreacher?”Severus asked and clicked his fingers demandingly, summoning the grumpy house-elf instantly, if with a series of of quite impolite grumbles in tow. He gestured to Potter who rose from his seat and walked over, kneeling down strangely silent, otherworldly.
Neither of them needed to be reminded of the consequences. But as much as Albus tried to ignore the facts: there were far more pressing matters right now.
Severus held the gaze of Potter's eyes, one still green like spring leaves, the other ghastly white. It felt strangely appropriate to his now solemn, calm demeanor. “What have you seen then?” he tried to mock but it fell short, his voice drying out under the unforgiving stare causing him goosebumps. “Seer's eye. Is that it?”
For now, he returned to Hogwarts, sent his Patronus to Poppy to let her know, re resumed taking care of the boy, and retired to his rooms, sufficiently exhausted to all but ensure a decent rest.
Severus was almost impressed, he still managed to restrain himself and close his hand, waving the delicate piece of wood once. It remained cold and dead as he had clearly expected. In contrast, his fingers could not stay in place anymore, shook so distinctly, the wand fell from them and clattered to the floor.
Severus could not find peace on that. Each time he tried to sit down in his favorite armchair after only a few minutes nervousness got the better of him and forced him up again. He needed to study the contents of his own library once more. He knew it well enough, but maybe...
He had never been so disappointed to be completely right about something. All that held the boy together was hope, and it would take him a long time to heal properly, even with the help of magic. It would take days until he could sit up, weeks until he could leave this room for longer periods of time, and it might take forever to give him back the cocksure confidence that he could and would prevail in the end.
That was one way to put it, and so typical for his usual dismissal of anything unpleasant it made Severus even more furious than he already was. Funny that now Dumbledore benefited from the restraint, Severus had learned to face his opposing counterpart. “Clearly Potter is not ready for a normal school day again” he said bluntly, omitting: “And never again will be.”
Harry cries, actual tears welling up in his eyes, running over his face, not from pain or sorrow or fear, simply from too much of everything. Draco seems to understand, his face not worried, but proud, his hands finding his wand, vanishing the binds, reaching for Harry, running over his sensitized skin soothingly. Again, he ends up, pressed against Draco's side, as the blonde lies down next to him, pulls him closer, pulls him in, this time with a tenderness, Harry has never known.
Potter's sudden blush is answer enough, but he needs to be sure. Mistakes have consequences in this.
All three of them spent, he feels the tension of magic rising, running through Potter in small jolts of energy. He has never seen, never felt something like this, though he can only watch from afar. Then the Gryffindor collapses, gratefully accepting, when Draco turns him and pulls him against his chest, letting his head rest against the shoulder of the pale blonde in exhaustion.
This wasn't Potter surely, Potter was dead, but what else could it be? What abomination of magical use had Voldemort up his sleeve to use the body of his sworn enemy now?
This, another memory he would like to banish altogether, but could not afford to rid himself of just yet. It made him taste bile at the back of his throat and clenched his muscles painfully. That, too, he had seen before, if maybe, hopefully, not to this degree. It was certainly not something he had expected from Gryffindor's Golden Boy, though it was by far too common in Slytherin children.
Shrugging, he dismisses the thought, before it gets really creepy, this was supposed to be fun and not live-changing, decision questioning, family-shattering politics. The best way to handle something like this, is not to handle it at all and deal with the things at hand instead. So he goes for the kitchens, avoiding the usual paths of patrolling teachers, not that they will likely bother at this hour. But Theo never takes chances, always being in the background, never drawing attention, taking a more Slytherin path, than Draco ever could. He smirks, when he arrives at the kitchens, where dozens of house elves are working untiringly. Funny, how ethics and good intentions of the so called light side are thrown aside so easily, when their comfort is at stake...
But what had the younger Black hinted? Right then and in this very moment he cursed Molly Weasley once again for all but destroying the Black library. It robbed him of all the sources his once-friend had had. Hogwarts' forbidden section was by no means comparable. Sighing he decided on the only other place possibly able to provide. No matter how risky and unpleasant, he needed the Malfoy library.
cruel.” His would-be shrug looked more like an awkward attempt of his limbs to flee from him.
Draco's voice ripped through the concentration “Come on, Potter, even you should be able to find a wand. It's not like not even Longbottom managed that:” the sting in his godson's tone was reassuring, Potter's more amused than angered reaction was not.
First tentatively, but soon bolder he kisses, bites, tongues Theodore's mouth, as if the signs of insecurity before, were nothing but a foreplay. His hands find Theo's hair and stroke it in gentle passion, as he leans in, his chest against chest. It seems, Theodore misjudged his experience by far, or, what a joke, he relies only on recklessness and natural talent.
Severus decided to interfere before this went any further. In grim determination he neared, deducting points from Gryffindor for swearing, and sent Mr. Weasley back to where he came from. When he turned back to Draco, his godson helped Potter lean against the wall and calm down, talking softly to him. He seemed to have a good grip on the situation and so Severus decided to let him handle it, passing by and opening the storage room door instead. He stopped himself from a scathing remark at the last moment and waited, calming his temper.
Angrily he bit back scathing remarks, knowing they would serve no purpose here. If the spark of Potter's strength was alive, it might very well quench it, and if it wasn't, no taunt in the world could bring it back. Severus scowled, realizing that he hated to see it disappear even more than he hated its existence. But he was above giving in to impulses like this. He had to think, had to figure out a way to bring back the hated bane of his existence. Or at least its image. Sighing, he declared: “this might take more time than I anticipated.”
Still the boy didn't move, unwilling or unable to stand up immediately, and only nodded in silent approval.
Both of them found their gaze fall towards Potter's hands that started shaking slightly. The Potter looked up, met his eyes, just for a second and looked away, repeating: “I'm sorry, sir.”
believe me on this,” said Draco.
The music the band was playing began its crescendo as a hush fell over the hall, interspersed by excited whispers. A few of the ministry folk in the hall began to whisper harshly to one another, irritated.
nervous for the stilted conversations with people better educated and richer than he grew up; for the comments about his personal life, pretending like they knew him because they’d read a few Daily Prophet articles.
The return of Eden Inkwood.
“I might as well have…” said Hermione, “but I think I’m making a lot of good progress with the ministry workers here. I think they’re warming to me, Harry!” she chattered excitedly.
"Well forgive me if I don't take your word for it,” said Harry.
“No, no! Olen, don’t eat mummy’s campaign posters, please!” said Hermoine, plucking the poster from the child’s mouth and giving him a small toy to play with instead. Olen put it straight into his mouth, but at least it wasn’t a poster, or a choking hazard.
“Why did you quit the potions job in the first place then?” asked the other man. Draco steeled himself.
And then every other excuse he had cooked up in his mind melted away like so much soft margarine.

Harry sat anxiously on one of the fainting couches, back ramrod straight, frantically scanning the room. He had been in that position for a couple of hours at that point, drinking sparkling water that changed flavour with each sip. In the centre of the room was a pool filled with fish that led into the larger aquarium under the building. It was beautiful. Harry continued to tap his foot.
“What’s so wrong with keeping up with someone when their message is one you sympathise with?” said Harry, with all that bloody Gryffindor stubbornness.
“It really suits you, ‘Mione,” said Harry. She smiled bashfully at the combined attention.
Harry took this as an encouragement, and picked up a contour compact, pretending to cast a
“Oh, I know, but the Ministry hoped the increase in funding - especially coming from the Ministry itself - would put enough pressure on them to elicit positive change. And it did! Until now, that is…” she said, “I just don’t know how I can possibly get the Heads of Departments back on my side. How can I address this? How do I fix it?” Hermione finished.
" She hissed.
Eventually, blessedly, Pansy pulled away.
Rank, indeed.
Who's Finis?

Draco pushed his father’s curt voice from his mind.
Harry realised he had stopped breathing, so he started again. He also realised he had been staring… for a while. So he looked up at his two friends, sat together on the plush sofa opposite him.
, not
“I wasn’t invited though,” said Ron.
It was different. This moment
in this banquet hall?
All at once, the great white doors leading into the hall swung open, revealing a figure clothed in shimmering red. Malfoy hadn’t come in through any of the staircase entrances, but rather straight through the front door. This dress was similar in style to the white one Harry had seen, with the diamonds, they contrasted each other. It was also a bardot - so Malfoy’s pale shoulders and collarbones were totally exposed as the off-the-shoulder sleeves wrapped around his arms and seamlessly joined the front, plunging into a
He cursed under his breath. “Infirmary. Now.” For a moment he was inattentive, then his worst fears came to light as Potter, after throwing robes over his simple clothes, left the room without a fuzz, passing right through the wards as if they didn't exist. They could not hold him back when he didn't think of them, did not believe in their effect.
Severus wasn't in the mood. “Leave it for now. I have my reasons” he stated dryly and came back to the initial problem then. “I would like to be present for the scan if you could arrange it.”
Potter hesitates, the initial insecurity firmly back in place, then nods, looking away sheepishly. “Okay...” with a voice all hazy and breathless, catching in his throat, the face caught in tension, beautiful. Beautiful.
Soon enough Draco managed to help Potter through the door, heading back twice to get the satchels. The Potter boy was still pale as a chalked wall and breathed with difficulties but forced himself into self-control.
As Draco dresses, he theorizes. “He must have planned this... for what?”
Potter looked to down to the floor, breathing harshly. The untrained eye would surely assume his actions were driven by guilt, while in truth he could barely resist the urge to roll into a ball on the ground, falling victim to another panic attack.
Draco wouldn't hear it. Cupped his cheek in one desperately possessive gesture, leaning in to take the kiss Potter would not give him.
Seeing Draco, usually so controlled, loose his grip, fall for Potter's charm so easily, speaks volumes. Him arching into the touch, even if Potter does not yet know, what he is doing, him groaning, almost unfiltered by conscience, him, simply falling apart, is a feat, Theodore never fully mastered. Potter does it with ease. And suddenly the longing is overpowering. Theo wants him too. Badly. And there are ways to keep his agreement with Draco and still get his share.
Suddenly, strangely, Severus felt like an intruder. Draco's deliberate ignorance of his presence in this most intimate moment raised more unease than a full blown death eater meeting. It increased further when his godson leaned in, whispering something into Potter's ear, something that made him blush, then shake his head.
He had despised the boy and probably would be reminded of that as soon as the brat was back to his obnoxious self, sporting an onerous disregard for rules meant to ensure his own and everyone else's safety and well-being. But now was not the time for such considerations. Now he was just a child on the brink of death and in desperate need of help and care.
And it did react to calls directed at the Dark Marks as they found out accidentally when Severus was summoned while checking the inevitable progress of Potter's demise. While he brushed over the mark, frowning at the discomfort and calculating if he could leave the boy alone, Potter hit the floor suddenly, writhing in pain and begging, begging for it to stop. Severus tried to administer some pain relief, but the only thing that ultimately helped was putting distance between Voldemort's magic and that piece of him eager to regain it.
In the room then he made Potter sit down and recover. When Poppy turned to them he closed the distance to her and cast an annoyed muffliato. “We can't wait, for Merlin's sake. We need to know immediately.”
Potter mumbled something, he noticed and called him out on it. “What was that? I did not quite catch it...”
The road to Draco's betrayal was clearly paved now, and Severus' godson well prepared to walk it to its bitter end. The picture of Lily's dead body before his inner eye, Severus swore there and then he would not let it come to that. He would not force Draco into the same choices, he had made in his time and had made all wrong. The Dark Lord would need to end. And Potter needed to be ready. Ready enough to survive.
Draco nodded suspiciously compliant and guided him outside. Although Severus severely doubted his sincerity he went with it. Draco's report would give him an overview of the situation and then, with no bad conscience whatsoever on his part, Legilimency would give him the details. He was protecting something important here. It was necessary to put an early stop to anything inappropriate.
Whatever Draco did was beneficial to Potter's state of mind and would help remedy his relocation anxiety. So he simply asked his godson for a meeting later and left to arrange the visits, he still needed to set up, if only to cover his tracks and make all this less suspicious to either party.
Draco frowned and stuttered out: “Why, his ed... I mean he should...”
Over the years, it had withstood several blows, the dementors, the resurrection of the Dark Lord, the dreadful confrontation with that awful shrew Umbridge, the death of his godfather, due to one of his reckless actions. No matter what Severus thought of the man it was yet, another injury not yet fully healed. This last straw seemed to have broken him completely.
It was not necessarily a good thing. Feeling for Severus meant primarily guilt. Meant pain. Meant unspeakable burdens. But they were his. His decisions, his possibilities. His alone.
Theo catches him, before he can do something stupid, kissing again, whispering again. “Don't worry, it's alright. Just...” He pins Potter with a hand at his sternum. “For one moment I need you to be absolutely honest with me.” Giving him a warning look, he then asks him: “Are you a virgin?”
The questioning ended as suddenly as it had begun and with Voldemort's mood and no plans to be discussed, nobody wanted to linger any longer than necessary. He still did, fully aware, it would help him deflect any suspicions on his behalf, if he managed to play this right.
“Why wards?” Potter suddenly asks, looking between them. Draco shrugs, so it's Theo's part again, doing all the explaining. “Losing your virginity... nothing special for muggles, but wizards.... There is power in that. And in this room, with all its magic, strange things may happen. We just want to make sure, you will be alright. Safety comes first, in here.” Draco nods to everything, torn between nervousness and anticipation.
He would lie there unnaturally still, even his breath calming, as if he did not dare panting or whimpering. It took a special kind of person to do this to someone, even if you despised them generally. Severus took it upon himself to be there each single time. He would not let Poppy do that, knowing she already fought a silent battle with herself on applying procedures to not necessarily safe Potter's life but restore his abilities on expense of added pain. She needed no more of that struggle. And Draco... maybe his self-proclaimed hatred would shield him against the nagging guilt that came with such actions, but Severus did not want to see his humanity and compassion wither away like his own had, doing unspeakable things like he had in Voldemort's service.
It was this silent acceptance, not Draco's pleading now rising up, that made him stop. No beast, no demon, especially not Voldemort would simply submit to falling back into the darkness. “Potter...” he grumbled joylessly. “One day you will be my ruin.”
“Next door?” Draco as everyone else tended to overlook things he saw daily but deemed irrelevant. “The potion lab there is hardly appropriate for that, isn't it?”
Draco and Potter... Of course he knew of Draco's preferences. Who in Slytherin wouldn't after that Zabini-incident. But as per usual for their secretive House, things had been handled in all silence and both parties had been sworn to more subtlety. Potter was quite a different matter. He had only dated girls if at all as far as Severus was aware, which wasn't all that much frankly. In truth the boy had never been a particularly active participant of the school's rumor mill, which was remarkable given his popularity. Maybe this was the reason.
With a series of huffs Draco now helped Potter, who after only these few minutes of constant movement and standing upright already paled, but refused to show his indisposition. For the moment, Severus let him be. He was scared enough as it was. Calmly Severus waited, until the boys had collected all their things, Draco deciding he would not stay either. Then Severus opened the door and ushered them out.
Severus declined. “It would only complicate things.” He saw in Poppy's eyes that she understood him very well. The headmaster might throw rocks into their path where none were necessary, thinking he was helping. Or just messing in general. They could not afford that. Not any more. Not with the boy's life so directly at stake.
A monster of a boy, granted. A pig, a rat, a coward. But a boy still, and Severus refused to sink to that level yet again.
And thus time collapsed into a focal point when he was called again. This, this was the moment of truth. Ignoring tears and cold sweat, moans and whispers, he finished his preparations, then turned to leave. “When Draco is called, be ready.”
He gives a one-shouldered shrug, not losing the aim of his own wand on Blaise. “Beside the point, Zabini, even if I was in the inner circle.” He shakes his head disapprovingly. “Not that you would understand.” Ignorant foreigner. “We gave our word. We promised to keep him safe for the time of our agreement. If we loose our honor that easily, what makes the actual difference between us and them muggles?”
Afterwards, lying in his own bed, he let sleep take him. It drowned out all the worries, he held, all the problems of this day and the days to come, all the aches a thorough acquaintance with the cruciatus curse left behind. For once he needed to trust his ward and let down his guard. Sleeping with one eye open was not an option, if he wanted to keep his secrets, while awake. There wasn't enough rest most of the time anyways.
“You could take your chances. Try to escape the fate, take an easy way out and hope, your death sets it right.”
“Severus?”
His godson didn't look very convinced and only nodded because it seemed to be expected. “I'll be back after lunch if you like.”
After a moment he sat down next to Potter, their knees almost touching, and grinned, when the Potter boy turned his head and met his gaze. Something whispered passed between them and made Potter smile suddenly, not just slightly, but radiant, like the sun breaking through thunder clouds.
“You know something!” she almost snarled, sending a heated leer at him. “What happened to him? Where is he? What did you do to him?”
Bringing his revolting guts back into control, Severus relit the Lumos and determinedly moved into the room, squatting down to assess the situation thoroughly. In almost gentle motions, not to cause further damage, he loosened the boy's face from where dried blood had glued it to the floor and carefully placed Potter on his equally bloodied back.
He started to study the parchment the prim teacher handed him and found little need for corrections.
His wand not being among them, would cause serious a problem, Severus would need to solve soon, but at least the situation was not as forlorn as Potter assumed. New wands were not easy to come by: their resonance with the wizard commonly lacked the natural feeling of the first wand. But they would serve the wizard nevertheless and judging by the deep and profound change of the young Mr. Potter in comparison to the child he had been, another wand might truly serve him better these days.
Draco's hand closes around him, completely out of sync with his last, hard pushes, closing painfully as the blonde spills. Harry feels tears welling up, from the fear, the pure panic to be left behind. But there is no need to. Draco, with the last of his strength holds himself up, working Harry's cock, sweat and precome mixing on his hand, as he pushes and pulls, pushes and pulls, until Harry arches helplessly, coming a second time, his come spilling over Draco's hand and stomach.
Severus did not care if he felt loss or grief or only anger and wounded pride. He took his chance while he had it. Leaving Draco standing on his own he rushed over to Voldemort's side and grabbed the small cutting knife in his pocket. The Dark Lord turned towards the movement, but was too slow to react. Severus grabbed his shoulder harshly and ran the hellishly sharp edge of the blade over his pale skin, pressing with all his strength, cutting deep until greyish blood first seeped, then dripped, then gushed over his hands.
Her footsteps, hastily and uneven, followed for a while, but quieted, once he turned to the downward stairs. “You'll regret that” he heard her shouting and could not help but think: 'I already do.' Even in absence Potter was fully capable to ruin entire days.
For this, however, their ignorance is an advantage. Not that the Slytherins would have refrained from it, with more attentive adults around, but the lack thereof comes handy. Their personal little playground, their own rules, their place. And, thanks to Zabini's mediation Harry Potter in the midst of it. He would never have believed, that Potter swings that way, at least part time, but Blaise has been insistent, until they have allowed him an attempt to invite him.
“Potter is a danger to himself and others as you should be fully aware by now” he spit out without preface.
“Will it...” Potter hesitated, throwing a gaze towards Draco who was the only one not aware of the events in the chamber of secrets a few years back. “Will it come alive?”
I enjoyed my experiment greatly and will most certainly repeat it with different parameters, if inspiration strikes me again. Feel free to let me know if you find it a success. Or if you have ideas for another project. Or if you want to just discuss with me.
Voldemort watched in shock, his snakish face unable to express the feelings that were raging in his body. He would not feel how the pieces of his soul died off, one after the other, had long abandoned them. Yet the death of his valued pet monster did not leave him unfazed.
Soon, he slides down Draco's body just as easily as the other way around, seeking out the collarbone, the ribs, the arms. When he rubs his face against Draco's hips, the ice prince of Slytherin melts into pure want, moaning loudly. Yes... Draco wants this, and he wants to see. His eyes leave the two of them not even for a second. He regrets every blink.
Then again the whole matter was somewhat a relief. With all this at stake and clearly coming to a conclusion before Draco's own time ran out there was now a chance he could leave all of this mostly unscathed. Shaken perhaps. Bare of his “first love”, but alive and well.
“That won't work, Potter, and you know it. That's just pain and you can handle pain. That's not the fear, the helplessness, the shame, you would need to endure.” Draco licked his lips nervously , unsure, why he was even still part of this conversation. Then again, a sense of foreboding, of strange anticipation settled in his chest.
you’re missing!” Ginny’s knees gave out, her magic completely drained, sucked out of every pore of her body.
“Dragana,” Harry said, and their guests laughed at his testy tone. “I love you. Now trust me. Take the Cracker.”
“I look forward to listening to it every evening with you," Harry whispered. "Our song.”
In addition to a mutual spell that the Potter-Malfoy family would cast together, intermingling their familial magic together with the Earth, it was traditional for each participant to make their own private wish to manifest until the next year’s First Snow Fall. Sometimes this was the most meaningful part of the ritual for Draco, who had made some huge wishes over the years that had ended up changing his life. There was no doubt in his mind that the ancient magic at the core of this ritual was immensely powerful. But he knew it wasn’t dark. It was noticeably clear from his research and experience that this spell was grey as grey could be, completely dependent on the intent of the casters.
“This is a good one!” Draco defended himself. “I was going to say that—oh, shut up, Potter,” Draco glared at Harry again, less lovingly than before, but, of course, any of the malice that he had felt for the man as a teenager was also clearly absent.
“Do you know how much I love this dress?”
Harry was biting his lip, trying unsuccessfully to suppress his laughter as Draco stumbled over his words and rambled away, confessing much more than he’d expected.
Draco had always meant to keep up with him. Send an owl at Yule or something…but he never did. And then, eventually, it was too late. He’d missed his window, and Harry obviously hadn’t seemed interested in kindling any sort of friendship following the trial or
“Well…I have a confession, too,” Draco said.
Dragana giggled. “Especially with the Christmas crackers I’ve chosen for everyone…”
Dragana returned the smile and nodded, her silver eyes shining with love.
Draco’s smile stretched from ear to ear, his own cheeks shimmering with tears as he retrieved the engagement ring from the Nutcracker.
“It’s true!” Hermione said. “Why haven’t they tried to adapt instruction given the advancements in education in the past 1000 years? Especially considering there’s so much more technology now.”
“It’s not something one can help, you know. Falling for someone.” Draco’s pale cheeks turned slightly pink and he lowered his gaze.
Harry couldn’t help feeling a flush of pride. “Only some spells. I practiced a lot when Ron, Hermione, and I were on the run last year.
Finally, Draco reached for the garment he’d been most excited to try. A magical and sexy black corset that had a charm on the ribbons to ensure you’ll look “just like the picture.” Draco gulped and felt his heart hammer in his chest as took the corset and placed it on his torso, connecting the hooks and eyes at the back.
And then Harry found his eyes glancing down towards Draco’s lips and back again. When Draco did the same, Harry closed the distance between them and kissed him.
“Doesn’t seem that way, does it?” Harry said, taking a chocolate frog out of his robes and handing it to his friend.
“Professor Dumbledore always thought highly of you, Harry,” Professor McGonagall said, switching to his given name. “He trusted you implicitly and so do I. And Draco--” she met Draco’s eyes, “I thank you for your dedication to this school and the future of the magical world. I see what you’ve been through to be here today, and you are one of the most admirable wixen I have ever met.”
, he thought.
A couple guests let out a chuckle and then Harry continued. “You are the most determined and cunning person I have ever met. But you’re also incredibly brave and honest. You are inquisitive. Patient. Loyal. Trustworthy. And kind. You are more than that pompous Slytherin prat you were at Hogwarts. You are…soooooo complex—”
Dragana rolled her eyes, but placed her hands on Harry’s cheeks, leaning in to give him a deep, sloppy, contract-binding smooch.
“Do you want more?” Draco asked. Harry nodded and curled his head onto Draco’s chest.
When Harry stepped out of the front doors, Draco was ready for him—standing tall, his chest out and forward, the polar-opposite to his earlier state.
was suspicious, was you. You know.... sleuthing
How does tomorrow evening sound?”
“I wasn’t
She released her lips wetly and said, “I’m not finished.”
Harry whimpered. “No... but I... I do want to.”
But Draco didn’t listen anymore. He and Harry turned back to each other, and Draco found himself enraptured by those deep emerald eyes. He knew he’d inevitably have to blink again eventually and come back to reality, but for the moment, he focused on connecting with Harry, baring his heart, mind, soul, and magic for Harry to peruse in his silver-grey eyes. The other wix responded just as bravely, allowing his feelings to be reflected in his own eyes.
“Wow, you have such good eyes,
“Did you see that?!” Harry asked, pointing at the Slytherin Common Room.
Draco mumbled incoherently.
“Er… do you mind telling us what’s going on here?”
“No,” Harry said, straightening up in his chair. “Who else is missing?”
“Mm-hmm,” Harry hummed, “Take your time, sweetheart.”
Harry’s eyes widened, as it finally dawned on him. “You’ve been planning this. Ever since we got together. It’s true!  Don’t even try to hide it anymore!”
Summary: Draco and Harry have become close friends since the end of the War and Draco’s trial. They’re now neighbors in Diagon Alley, and Draco has a predicament...he’s falling for Harry. Hard. And the other man seems as straight as straight can be--Draco suspects he must flirt with every girl he’s ever met at the Silver Stag Society.
I didn’t have a chance to look at the journal!” Hermione looked so put out Harry couldn’t help feeling bad for her.
“—but is also entitled to one wish to be granted by the LOSER,” Malfoy’s lips rounded saucily around the letters of the word “loser” and Harry’s cock twitched again—he imagined her lips in a round “Ohhhhhhh!” around it.
From Part 1...
“I’m glad,” Draco said, and flicked his thumb over the head of Harry’s cock, wiping away some precum. Then, Draco put his thumb to his lips and licked it, eyes locked on Harry. The sight made Harry’s cock twitch.
Dragana’s face, which had been a light pink, turned scarlet.  “Thank you,” she mumbled, and stepped forward, welcoming Harry into her arms.
Step 2. Expect people to make a mess. And then finally:
“Want to... take this somewhere else?”
Harry laughed. “It’s good for you, Ron. Using your brain, I mean.” Under the table, he felt a light kick to his shin and when he looked at Ron he was grinning.
“Yes. It sure does, Professor,” Draco said.
Harry nodded. “From what we’ve read so far, Ravenclaw had a premonition, similar to the one that led her to building Hogwarts on this very spot, which convinced her to cast her enchantments despite having been overruled by the other founders.”
may also occasionally elect to vanish their own rubbish.’ I see.”
“Hey…” Harry said, and to his surprise, he saw himself reach out and place his hand on Draco’s forearm. It felt comfortable though, as their friendship had brought them closer, and they’d even started to be more free with their affection towards each other. They had shared some hugs, some shoulder claps, and squeezes. And though this felt more intimate, it did feel like a natural progression, and neither man seemed to feel the desire to pull away.
“I have to ask though,” Draco said, interlacing his fingers and resting them on the table. “Why is this information… relevant? Don’t get me wrong, I love learning about historical figures simply for the sake of learning—”
Harry looked Draco, watching goosebumps spread across his skin as his lover shook slightly from the cold, as well as his overpowering arousal.
“And those neighboring columns—” Draco pointed out the columns on either side of the portico. “Their sculptures display scenes from the life of Charles Borromeo in a spiral relief. Charles, as in,
Draco leaned in and brushed his lips to Harry’s. “Of course. I’m sorry I asked you to.”
Draco opened his mouth, but no words came out.
When Harry had licked all the precum away, he proceeded to continue decorating his Draco as a Christmas tree. Harry made sure to highlight one of his lover’s…most awe-inspiring features (that delicious cock) with delicate and precise twists and turns of the string of lights.
Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bobbed, and then he opened his mouth to continue. “I was embarrassed,” he confessed, and to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy’s pale cheeks went slightly pink. “But...that’s no excuse. I’m sorry. I should have thanked you. For everything you did for me. For my family. I know you fought to get their sentence down from life to fifty years, and for that I am eternally grateful.”
“Let’s take a look,” Harry said and as he did so the long oak table appeared in the middle of the room.
Harry immediately met Malfoy’s eyes, his own widening in shock at the word “dear.” Malfoy’s cheeks, which had only just returned to their normal color, skipped the pink all together and turned crimson red. But to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy held their eye contact, admitting to the verbal slip-up and allowing the awkwardness and confusion of the moment to permeate the air around them.
“I don’t believe it,” Draco said.
Harry did as he was told.
“Are you sure this is safe?!” Dragana held Harry tightly around the middle, face buried between his shoulder blades. The two wixen had just lifted off from Grimmauld Place for a romantic midnight ride on Harry’s
Ron was looking between his girlfriend, his best mate, and the ex-Death Eater, obviously still torn and frustrated at being put in this position. After a solid minute of silence, he held up his own hand for Malfoy. “I trust Harry with my life. So, if he trusts you, he must have a very good reason. Shall we call this...a clean slate? Draco?”
Harry tries to keep his cool around Draco. Spoiler: he fails.
“I can’t
“It was fucking brilliant,” Draco said, kissing Harry in the center of his chest, then meeting his eyes.
Harry finished wrapping the lights around Draco’s arms and torso in a gorgeous pattern. Harry rested his hands on Draco’s neck and relished in the realization that the former Slytherin was completely at his mercy. Except…
“Hmm…neither,” Harry said, and he grabbed his wand, murmuring a banishing spell. The pants had completely vanished and Harry was staring at the magnificently erect cock of Draco Malfoy.
“And that upgraded laser charm on my eyes from last time we were at St. Mungo’s has been doing absolute wonders for my nighttime flying. You had no idea we were going the wrong way for the first two minutes of our journey before I deftly maneuvered us back on track.”
Draco chuckled and pulled out of Harry slowly and carefully, his hand holding the condom firmly in place.
“She didn’t want to leave Hogwarts undefended, so she cast the enchantments in a way that they would remain dormant until Hogwarts deemed itself ready for change.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s cheeks flushed and he mumbled, “Sorry.”
Harry couldn’t help bursting out laughing. “You don’t have to drink it.”
“Don’t push yourselves,” Draco had warned them, when the boys had revealed their desire a couple weeks ago to cast the spell independently this year. A few more ground rules were discussed, but, in the end, Draco was honestly immensely proud of his children for taking a leap of faith and trusting their magic.
“Of course, I can.” Draco pressed deeper into Harry, millimeter by millimeter.
Harry let out a choking sound. “Excuse me?”
Draco had given up his efforts to conceal his laughter.
. Draco placed the map back in his pocket and returned to the entry hall to take the stairs leading him to the left corridor. A couple first year Ravenclaws were admiring the rubies, diamonds, sapphires, and emeralds in the House Point Hourglasses which were extra sparkly during Christmastime. Other than that, the place was deserted. Except—
“You brought the biography, right?” Draco asked. “I want to take a closer look.”
It was a Christmas Nutcracker. This had to be the cheesiest thing he had ever been gifted—which surprised him, given Dobby’s portrait.
Draco nodded. “You don’t have to be sorry. I’m just… wigged out by this whole thing, to be honest. Of course, I’ve always known there are true Seers out there, but I’ve always put it to the back of my mind. It just all seems...so unnatural. When someone knows something they’re not ‘supposed’ to know. Like they’re breaking the laws of the universe of something.”
“Tell me…” Ginny trailed off and started pacing the room, trying to get her thoughts in order and out of her mouth in a way that would make sense. “Tell me…I’m a screwed-up mess.”
Thank you so much to my Betas vukovich and crazybutgood who spent hours with me on Google Docs making these stories so magical and wonderful. And I hope all of you here on Ao3 had just as much fun reading as we did writing. :* xo
“How is that possible?” Ron asked.
It took Harry a minute or so to pull himself together and then he folded the handkerchief and placed it in his robes. He sensed Draco looking at him and turned towards him.
? Anyways. Harry,” Draco looked the other man in the eye and grinned. “You’re so beautiful. And this place is so beautiful. And I just can’t comprehend it.”
“Yes, for Merlin’s sake let’s go!” Harry placed his hand in the other man’s and gently turned on his heel, apparating himself and his lover to "Harrodz," a wizarding department store that closely resembled the muggle "Harrods."
“Not only difficult, but nigh on impossible, I’d say,” Harry said. “But we should probably wait until tomorrow to talk to McGonagall. Like I mentioned,
“Is this a serious question,” Draco asked, grinning, “or are you pulling my wand?”
“Ron! It’s fine. You’re fine,” Susan reassured him. “To answer your question, Luna and I have been seeing each other since the beginning of term. We’re in the Divination Club together.”
Harry remembered an old muggle saying: the eyes are the window to the soul. He wasn’t sure who’d said it, but in that moment, Harry knew they were right. In that moment, as he stood in the Room of Requirement with Malfoy, their eyes locked on one another, Harry felt he could read Malfoy like an open book. His apology was genuine, as was his gratitude. Harry took a deep breath and allowed a feeling of calm to wash over him. He was certain now that he’d done the right thing. Harry was sure he trusted Malfoy, and guilt began to gnaw at his stomach for how suspicious he’d been.
“Yes, Master?” He sounded exhausted and a little put out. Harry couldn’t help but smile at his curmudgeonly old house elf, who, despite everything, had really turned around and become a generous and loyal help around the house. Harry no longer viewed him as a “servant,” despite the fact that Kreacher still refused to accept a wage. He suspected that the elf deftly replaced any Galleons Harry left secretively in his room back into Harry’s own home vault.
“I want to fuck you, Harry.”
Before Harry had time to register that Draco’s thigh was leaving, he felt a warm hand press against the tent in his trousers.
“Yes,” Draco said. “You’re right. Let’s go to bed.”
“Or…or that I never listen,” Ginny continued as if Harry had said nothing.
Harry was wearing a green Christmas jumper, most likely knitted by the Weaselette’s mother. It had a fiery red phoenix on the chest, and Draco couldn’t help smiling. He sometimes wished his mother would make him stuff like that.
“How long?” Harry asked, genuinely intrigued by this new information.
about what’s impolite? After years of treating us all like second-class wixen because we aren’t pureblood like you? After years of you calling Hermione despicable slurs and making fun of me and my family for being poor? You’re a right bastard, you know that?”
Harry’s eyes widened and Draco smirked. “You’re serious?”
Harry looked sharply back at Malfoy. “Of course not. Do you know how hard I—” he cut himself off, his cheeks burning red. Harry willed them to not give himself away.
“I’m fucking terrified that’s what I am,” Dragana admitted.
As Harry lay in bed that night, his thoughts spun in his head like a hamster wheel. Every time he closed his eyes, he was bombarded with images of Malfoy—his smirk, his smile, his hand reaching out to Harry. But also Malfoy’s eyes, his cheeks burning pink then red, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down as he swallowed, his lips as they formed the words “my dear Potter.”
“There seems to be another Hogwarts mystery afoot. And perhaps if we help each other, we’ll be able to crack it. What do you say?”
“What else did she see?” Susan asked.
“Now. We’re partners. Aren’t we?”
“Tradition,” Draco said. “Especially amongst pureblood wixen. And especially due to all the witch hunts in history which forced us as all into hiding and made a Statute of Secrecy essential to our very survival.”
two would be involved then?” Hermione asked, her expression quizzical.
“Mmm..thank you sir…”
It happened instantaneously. The ribbons floated into the air and started lacing into the loops at the front of the corset. They were slightly longer and dangled delicately down the body of the corset, tickling his legs where the stockings stopped.
“I see,” Harry said, his brow furrowing as the three newcomers sat down at the table.
Malfoy,” Harry said.
“The Room has always taken good care of us,” Draco whispered and then nibbled Harry’s earlobe gently, making the former Gryffindor moan aloud.
“Well, fuck it, I’ve already mucked that up!” Draco said, and gave Harry’s hand the slightest of squeezes. “You look totally stunning. And, might I also add, even if it’s a little too much, you look a bit like an angel. There I said it! There’s no taking it back now,” he finished, slightly giddy.
“I mean… in a way?”
Draco is bolting across the Hogwarts Grounds with Harry Potter’s broomstick, invisibility cloak and Marauders’ Map. When Harry catches up with him in the entry hall, he chases him all the way to the 7th Floor corridor where Draco locks himself in the Room of Requirement. But what is Draco’s plan? ;)
(See the end of the chapter for
Then, Draco squeezed. A gentle, tender squeeze. Draco’s thumb caressed Harry’s thigh, and in that moment, Harry’s breath caught in his throat. He had to stop himself from looking down and exposing to the others what was transpiring right under their noses.
Thank you so much to my betas for pushing me to do more and describe more. I'm so tired hahaha, but so pleased with this chapter. I hope you enjoyed <3
actually,” Luna said, pointedly. “The author, Rowan Ashe, is non-binary.”
“I love it,” Harry managed to whisper back, and snuggled into Draco’s chest. Draco placed his arms around Harry and held him close.
“I know exactly what you mean,” Dragana said.
“Master…” Kreacher trailed off.
“What?”
Coming from a…traditional family, Draco knew quite a bit of ancient magic passed down through the generations. This particular ritual the Potter-Malfoy family was going to cast today was actually the first bit of magic Draco could remember—the first spell he ever learned how to cast and control on his own. It was the only spell his parents allowed him to cast…on purpose, of course…before he went to Hogwarts.
Harry flushed, but motioned towards the bed and the two of them clambered onto it. They lay down facing each other, their heads lying on the plump pillows. “Draco,” Harry said, licking his lips. “I have to tell you…” His heart was pounding in his chest. Was he really considering this?
Harry blinked and, as casually as possible, readjusted his position to turn towards Ron, forcing Draco to remove his hand.

Harry sighed loudly and pulled his school bag off before plopping himself down on the stone floor, back to the wall. “Sit down.”
Where are you?!”
It’s been a couple weeks since Draco proposed to Harry (See: Chapter 6 "An Unexpected Christmas Gift") and they’ve been keeping it secret for a big reveal at the first ever Malfoy-Potter Christmas Party. Little does Dragana know that Harry has something up his sleeve to stir up the friendly Christmas Cracker competition they’ve got going on...
Just then a clang rang out right next to his ear, causing Draco to jump. Harry frowned, picking up a candlestick and leaning over Draco (too close) to search out whatever made the sound. To Draco’s terror, the sound had been Pansy’s knife clattering to the ground, somehow having escaped the confines of his trousers.
“We might want to get under the covers.”
Mother hummed, saying nothing but Draco watched as she glided up behind him, resting a hand on his shoulder and meeting his eyes in the mirror. Ah, he hadn’t hid his reaction well enough. That mix of concern and scorn was something only Narcissa Malfoy could accomplish.
“Okay,” Harry said peaceably, carefully modulating his voice in a way that made Draco feel like a child, “okay. We’re not doing that. The only tradition we have to honour is sleeping through the night tied together. That’s it, and it’s all we’re doing.”
“Gently.” Malfoy warned, before lowering to his knees so Teddy could pet the cat properly.
Harry left, ruefully echoing his earlier thought. What he wouldn’t give to understand what Malfoy was thinking.
“Well,” Harry said slowly, casually returning to his side of the bed, “I’m pretty sure that answers that.”
The old man spoke again, this time only to him. “Do you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, agree to relinquish all titles associated with the Malfoy line? Do you, of sound mind and clear conscience, abandon your father’s name? Do you agree to bear the name Malfoy only as a blood-honour, and instead swear yourself to the Potter line?”
So. It had been six years since the war, three and half of which he'd spent locked in depression and another year and half after that fighting back. He'd done it, though
“Ya!” Teddy laughed, “But it worked out that way dinnit?”
"You don't know their names, do you?"
, he was afraid of sex.
And chat
Somehow, in all his anxiety over the day and subsequent night Draco had never considered the future beyond it. Maybe subconsciously he’d never thought he’d get this far, or that the person who became a Potter would no longer be Draco. The future had been disconnected from him, a would-be meant for someone else, but with Potter’s one comment somehow a worse horror came to him: a husband who didn’t touch him, didn’t talk to him, didn’t include him in his life. His husband would take other lovers to satisfy him, either out of some misplaced idea of Draco’s virtue or just because he simply wasn’t attractive enough. Draco would have no one on his side in these foreign lands and no purpose to occupy himself with.
no. “I do.”
Draco sighed. “He doesn’t like me.” As if to punctuate the thought Teddy aimed a kick at his gut.
Teddy nodded, laying his hands in his lap and settling.
"Well this is drab. Was your interior decorator some sort of cave-dwelling creature?"
“Uh,” Harry said intelligently, “you have a cat?”
The woman gave him a grateful smile, then led him aside to fill out the requisite forms.
Marge bit her lip, gently unfolding a scroll and staring down at the pages. "Edward Remus Lupin, aged five months, was surrendered to ministry services by Andromeda Black due to inability to provide care on September third. One week later Edward Lupin was claimed by distant family member-" she paused, raising her head to meet Harry's eyes, "Draco Malfoy."
Harry hadn’t removed his trousers so neither did Draco. What he did do, in one quick movement Draco doubted Harry noticed, was slide Pansy’s dagger into his waistband and hope the heavy metal would stay there without his belt. He didn’t- he wasn’t going to
The castle was ancient and massive; under renovations as it had suffered greatly under Voldemort’s occupation of his lands. The corridor he currently he walked down was mostly finished as the stone stood in neat patterns and tapestries hung proudly on the walls. All the corridors where guests would be staying as well as their chambers had been restored almost fully, but the signs of the recent rushed renovations could be seen if Harry looked hard enough. Scuff marks in corners, creases in the tapestries. Harry didn’t care for that sort of thing, which is why his nerves flared brightly once again. If he, who couldn’t care less about the fiddly details, could see such things then surely his guests would notice as well.
