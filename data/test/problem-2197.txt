Draco glared, steeling himself for the interrogation that was surely to come. Potter would notify all his Order friends and the Witch Hunt would begin. He shook his head, pulling together his usual sneer and prepared to tell Potter and his bloody Order of the Phoenix right where to go. The words never left his mouth, as his undivided attention was distracted by long strands of almost white blond hair falling over his shoulder. "What the-" his fingers wrapped around the long strands and he tugged, finding said strands attached to his own head. Fumbling with the locks, he kept pulling until he found the ends of the strands. What the bloody hell was going on? The thought was almost frantic as his eyes moved from the ends of his hair to the pair of legs stretched out in front of him. Those were not his, of that he was positive. He didn't have that sort of definition. He wasn't a bloody runner and Quidditch didn't give you this sort of definition. There was only one thing that had not changed.
Flushing, Harry narrowed his eyes. "Fine!" he snapped, closing his eyes and rearranging the image he had, altering it so his appearance was closer to Draco's. His hair was longer, hiding the scar on his forehead, and much neater. He'd added some height to his stature and filled out a little more. He was tempted to remove his glasses completely, but he figured it was best to keep them.
Once again Harry found himself blinking stupidly. He knew he was doing it and yet there was absolutely nothing he could do to stop it. Over the course of the past few days he had been given more information than any sane individual could possibly process. What was terrifying to note was the simple fact that there was still so much more for him to learn. "I don't understand," he admitted, not at all feeling ashamed to do so. "If they don't classify my parents as Elven relatives than why are they documented in this book?"

Sighing, he dug his textbook out of his bag and opened it to the page indicated on the board at the front of the classroom, while Snape went on about what they were expected to do. Harry's attention wasn't really on what he was saying, despite the fact that he could probably have used every bit of help offered to him. Potions were not his strong suit. The only reason he'd signed up for it last year was that he'd needed it to get into the Auror program. He was pretty sure he wasn't going to be going into that anymore.
It wasn't a bathing room. It was a bloody hot spring paradise. Maybe he wouldn't stick his nose up at the use of it ... so long as Potter was busy elsewhere. It seemed like less of a paradise if he had to share it with the git.
His fingers clenched into fists, even as his feet kept moving. After Rosalind had explained what had happened to him and had drawn the necessary blood to test for signs of lycanthropy, Draco had left the infirmary. He had no idea where he was or where he was going. His thoughts were too loud for considering either of those questions. Instead, his thoughts raced over what he was to do now, how he was going to survive, and what this new twist in his fate meant for him. He didn't notice the corridors he passed through. He didn't notice those who stared at him curiously as he passed. He didn't notice that he was still barefoot. His eyes saw nothing and he didn't notice the soft tug that seemed to be drawing him further and further into the Manor.
There was a pang of guilt that flared briefly in Draco's chest before he smothered it with his regularly quick irritation with the Gryffindor. "Of course, Potter says something and everyone jumps to heed him, right? Figures." It seemed that no matter where he went, Potter was still an insufferable git with far more than he deserved.
The woman in question shook her head. "I don't know, Soren. The wounds should have healed completely." She was completely baffled. There was no precedent for this and she had nothing to turn to. Draco's health seemed to be restored, but there were questions she couldn't help but ask. Something that gone awry during the ritual and she could not be certain how the boys or the bond would be affected by that. There was little she could do at the moment, however, as the ritual was not complete; the spark in the air an obvious reminder. The blood had been accepted, tying the two together, and now Draco would face the change that would come as a result. Disconnecting herself from the boys and motioning the others to do the same, the four Elves retreated, all of them showing signs of fatigue.
Standing, Harry turned and headed gloomily to the door, Gwynn's silent presence following him. He'd just reached for the door when a thought struck him and he glanced back. "Were there any other team changes? I mean, from the other teams?"
Silence fell heavily around them, the tension thick in the air around them for several long moments, before Gabriel finally shifted in his seat. "I'm glad to help," he offered, nodding his head first to Harry and then to who he assumed was Draco. Harry, for his part, was still holding Hendrik's glare. "Your mate will be in good hands, I swear."
Lothair was just about to retort when there was a rather fortuitous knock on the door. After a moment, Rosalind entered the room, "I apologize for interrupting, but I've finished analyzing Mr. Malfoy's wounds and I think you should be aware of my findings before a decision is made."
was the first thought. He'd seen them before. They'd been wide in surprise and fear. One memory led to another, as his body remembered the icy cold temperature of the river as he had been thrown into it and the searing pain of the wolf at his back. As his body remembered the pain, Draco sucked in a deep breath and bolted upright, only to have his head connected violently with Harry's, the crunching sound of broken bones and Harry's cry of pain echoed in the following silence of the room.
Gwynn had not expected to see Harry much in the coming weeks. It was disappointing, she could admit, having grown rather fond of the ridiculous Elf. She couldn't fault him for his absence, however, word had spread quickly through the castle about a possible Consort. It seemed that despite the High Lords intent to keep such information from circulating, it had managed to slip free. The entire manor was buzzing. So when Harry stormed into the training courtyard, a rolling black cloud of anger hovering over him, she was rightfully surprised. Nor was she surprised when those who had previously been using the area had quickly disappeared.
"Alright, fine," he muttered, feeling perhaps a little embarrassed that she'd been able to read him quite so easily. "But I still don't like it."
Soren didn't move closer when Harry took a step back. Harry's instincts were exerting themselves and it would be difficult to push the subject too quickly. With Rosalind maintaining the Wizard's current health, he had the time to make Harry understand. "Dragon's blood is too potent for a mere Wizard to dilute. It will eat away at his own magic and leave him weaker than he is right now, which will only allow the room needed for his wounds to kill him. The only blood that he will be able to ingest is yours, Harry. That's it."
Taking the initiative, Ilaria placed her hands on his back and ushered him forward. "Come now, you've got this. Start with just basic sword skills and if the opportunity arises, you'll instinctively respond to the magic around you."
The question bothered him, she could tell. He was very focused on defining himself and it was clear that he was having difficulty doing so. She was not surprised. He had defined himself as a Wizard of strong blood, only to wake and realize that everything he'd once held as important had been burned from him. He was no longer a Wizard. He no longer could rely on his connection with the world he'd been raised in. He was something much more than that and it would no longer be enough to contain him.
"So what are you going to do then?" Gwynn sighed, knowing that pressing the issue would be no more productive than beating a dead horse. "About going back to the Wizarding world?"
"Ah, Harry, my boy," he stated, "I'm glad to see that you're well. You gave us quite the scare when you went missing from your Aunt and Uncles"
"You were completely reckless! Do you not understand what you could have caused running off into a bloody Werewolf feast? You could have ruined everything, you useless little fool!" This wasn't the first time since they'd left the forest Harry had been called a fool. He was even starting to feel a little bit like one, but he highly doubted Lothair's anger would be soothed by the admittance. He doubted there was anything that could soothe his anger now. Harry didn't think he'd seen Lothair as worked up as he was right then. Had he not been so worried about Draco and whatever was going on in the other room, he might have found it a little bit intimidating. "Worst of all, you left Gwynn to deal with a Werewolf on her own so you could run off and save some half dead human."
He was intrigued, naturally. In the time that he had been within the Realm, Harry had encountered no other Elves his age outside of the training environment. Sure, he liked the High Lords – or most of them anyway – but there was something very different about talking to someone your own age. After all, he liked Professor McGonagall but that didn't mean he was going to invite her over for a game of chess. Harry knew what the problem was. It was simply, really. He missed Ron and Hermione. At the same time, however, he wasn't entirely sure he was ready to face his best friends. His sudden inheritance would surely be something Hermione would want to study and Harry really didn't want to end up as an essay topic. Ron, on the other hand, proved to be an even bigger worry than Hermione. Harry's sudden change was bound to draw unwanted attention and Ron hated being pushed off to the side. Harry was positive the red head wasn't going to be at all pleased with any increase in Harry's already elevated status. For Ron, it was often a very difficult thing to be the friend of '
If he was expecting some sort of voice, Harry was sorely disappointed. It was just a current of magic that wrapped around everything. For several long moments, he was lost in the sheer vastness of it. When he finally managed to focus again, he pictured what he wanted and the reasons he wanted it. He wasn't sure if anything was getting across to the other source of magic.
As three more creatures erupted from trees, the one standing in front of him quickly became the very least of his concerns. These three made his current attacker look like a lapdog. They were twice as large, the one in the middle towering over the others, their coats dirty and matted, their eyes pinning both Draco and the other Werewolf with a look that clearly stated they both now on the lunch menu. Draco couldn't even be grateful that his original attacker was now too occupied with the others to bother with him. If it didn't kill him, Draco was sure one of the others would.
It was one of Ilaria's favourite things to yell at him when he couldn't get past her defenses. When they fought, Ilaria tended to use the same weapon as he did. The only difference between them was their skill with the same blade. This was different. Harry's Gladius was different than Draco's long sword. He didn't handle it the same way that Draco did. It was an entirely new challenge and Draco's mind was already pulling pieces together in order to solve the problem. There wasn't much in way of surroundings, which left only himself to rely on.
Harry had never been a great student, scraping by in the subjects he didn't like and maintaining average marks in the classes he did enjoy. To make matters worse, he had never been very good with the obvious, but he thought he might be getting a glimpse of what Soren was trying to explain. "Magical creatures?"
“I wanted to make sure there were no stragglers on the platform. Especially the littler ones.  They aren’t fast enough or strong enough to catch up to the train if it starts moving before they are on it. I am, and I wanted to make sure everyone made it. That’s all.” It was a half-truth, really. But if he really thought about it, Harry Potter could be considered one of the “littler ones” with how small he had been throughout their school years. Hermione glared again, unable to find an adequate retort to his reasoning without coming off as a complete bitch.
Harry has breakfast in the Great Hall following the latest Prophet article and then he heads to Potions class.
. I post when I update any chapters for my fics, and I plan to use it in the future for more interaction if it gets any activity on it. I've considered going back to Tumblr, but it has been years and isn't worth my mental health - I left for a reason. But I still love all the comments you guys leave behind here, its honestly feels like heaven when I read them.
“Eat your breakfast and take those potions.” He commanded. “I will see you in class, Potter-Black.” Then he whisked away, robes billowing behind him.
“It’s not his fault, Severus.” Draco chided, as if he could read his mind. Severus paused to check his Occlumency shields. No holes. Draco just knew him, as annoying as it was.
“Master did not eat his dinner in the hall, so I brought it up for him.” The elderly house-elf said. “I also brought the dreamless sleep potion for tonight. Do you require anything else, Master Harry?” Harry shook his head.
“The war is over, Draco. No one is going to kill him now.” He tried to reassure the blonde, but he knew Draco wasn’t talking about other people trying to kill Potter-Black. He was talking about those hopeless pits of nothingness that were Harry’s eyes.
“Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur.” He sang the incantation, like Severus had done for him back in sixth year. His voice was low and melodic, drawing in his classmates as Harry’s blood flowed back into him and the gash started to knit back together. “Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur, Vulnera Sanentur.”
“It is what it is, Professor.” Harry finally said. “I don’t blame him, or anyone else for what they think of me. I’ve changed, and they can tell.” He then set his now empty tea cup back onto the tray. “I didn’t come back to Hogwarts for friendship or acceptance, or anything silly like that. So, it doesn’t really matter. Not anymore.”
“Professor, if I may?” he asked, and Snape nodded. Draco made his way from the back of the group to the front, standing next to the potions master. He rummaged around in his bag and pulled out a silver pin, a snake curved into the letter “S”. He showed it to the other students and started to explain. “Given the current political climate at Hogwarts, and what I have experienced in the last few years, I felt it prudent that we take some measures to protect ourselves. I’ve made pins like this for everyone here, an I ask that everyone wear them wherever they go outside of this common room. They act as both a beacon and a call for help. Tap it three times and say ‘Salazar’, and it will warn myself, the Prefects, and Professor Snape that you are in need of help and will lead us to your location.” Draco paused, grasping the pin and staring at it, trying to form his next words.
“Change back, Lord Potter-Black.” The Headmistress said coldly, her own disgust at the man’s Animagus form plain on her face. Harry shifted back, straightening out himself and his clothes before turning to look at the two witches proceeding over him.
That was all he had ever wanted, to just be Harry. He had been Freak for a long time. Then, The-Boy-Who-Lived. Then Slytherin’s heir. The Sirius Black’s godson. The Tri-Wizard Champion. Then he was The-Boy-Who-Lied. Then he was Undesirable Number One. Then, he was The Golden Boy. Now, he was The Next Dark Lord.
Snape lifted and eyebrow, curious. “Why me, Potter-Black?” Harry sneered at him, but allowed him to go without the honorific. The man had at least earned the right to do that with how much he did in the war.
, still hid away his sexuality out of fear of what his parents would say and do. Though Snape was confident Narcissa – and even Lucius – would accept this aspect of their son, Draco had a lifetime of prejudice and typical pureblood bigotry burned into him. Even if being gay wouldn’t necessarily stop him from siring an heir, the poor boy was terrified that he would lose his family over it. So, he hid it, and had made Severus swear to keep it secret. Severus would never betray Draco’s trust like that. He loved Draco like a son, and all he wanted now was to see him safe and happy. He just hoped Draco would be able to face his parents and tell them the truth someday.
Once all the curtains were drawn, he turned back to the bed. It was situated between the two large windows he'd just opened and in the very center of it there was a lump beneath the blankets. Draco stood for a moment glowering at it. There was no sign of Potter save for that lump. There was no hair sticking out from beneath the blanket, no arm, no foot. Potter had legitimately burrowed himself under the blankets. Rolling his eyes, Draco stepped forward and jerked the blanket off his favourite Gryffindor. Of course, with the likes of Weasley, Granger, and Longbottom inhabiting the house, being his favourite wasn't exactly a compliment.
"Now he's calling you a liar." The man responded, his face still serious even as his eyes returned to Ilaria. "I've always questioned the company you keep."
"First, you will assign someone from your pack to remain here in the Manor," he held up a hand when the Alpha immediately went to argue, "It doesn't have to be your second. Honestly, I don't care who it is so long as they are able to assist Draco incorporate any characteristics that might manifest. Consider them to be a liaison between us. They will have the full protection of the realm."
Draco hissed, not appreciating the comment. Unlike Harry, he wasn't an idiot. He knew damn well who Caligula was and he certainly didn't appreciate being compared to the craziest emperor of all time. Not even the fact that she'd put him in the same class as an emperor could sooth his already ruffled feathers. "I said I'd return to school. I didn't declare war on Poseidon."
With a final nod, he turned and headed back toward the group he'd arrived with. Most of them were eyeing him with curiosity, some with suspicion, but he supposed that was to be expected. Harry, on the other hand, wasn't looking at him at all and, in a rare show of control, wasn't giving anything away emotionally either. The only sign that anything was wrong was the nervous glances Gwynn kept shooting him.
"No." they chorused. He was pretty sure that was the only time they'd actually agreed on something since he'd arrived at the table. Them agreeing tended to be a rare occurrence ... but this just seemed off.
"The Lichen continue to patrol the Western border," only if one listened closely could they hear the brief shiver of fear that had lingered beneath the gruff tone of the Scout. "Their movements do not reflect an alliance with the Realm, but they have remained adamant about maintaining possession of the hunting grounds at the base of the mountains. Even the most persuasive of our measures has not been successful in flushing them out."
"Sorry, sir," Harry offered, fixing a slightly sheepish smile to his face. "Everything happened so quickly."
The voice was familiar, but Draco could barely register that much through the haze of pain. Even if he'd wanted to he could do nothing but scream out his agony. He could hear the other wolves growling and snarling as they clawed at each other, their teeth snapping as they fought. Among the noise, however, the sound of a taunt bowstring snapping forward echoed through his mind, followed by the sound of impact and a howl of pained fury from above him. The force of impact knocked the wolf off balance. Unfortunately, the wolf's claws were still embedded in his back. The sharp movement served only to toss the blond as easily as a child tossed a broken toy. Draco barely felt it as he hit the earth for a third time, his consciousness slipping in and out. The momentum of his body as it hit the earth sent him rolling several times before he hit the river, immediately slipping beneath the surface. Water filled his nose and mouth, trickling down his throat as the current picked up his rapidly weakening body. The rough water sending his body rapidly down stream, hitting anything that got in his way, Draco's consciousness finally slipping into darkness, his lungs filling with the heavy weight of the water.
Kreacher knew this, and it pained him because they all cursed and tormented his master – unknowing what his master was hiding. What his master was doing to try and keep them all safe.
"Potter!" The irritated snapping of the Gryffindor's name escaped him before he had a chance to keep it silent. There was a growing rage boiling under the surface of his skin. Not one word. The git hadn't said one damn word. He'd just walked off like he hadn't a care in the bloody world. Well, too damn bad for him. Draco, himself, had plenty to say about this entire mess and that self-righteous idiot was going to listen.
Harry glanced up from the table at the musical lilt of the Faelyn's voice as she spoke, cutting off Soren's attempt to ease into the topic at hand. She had finally taken her eyes from Draco to direct them at Harry instead. Even as she spoke to Soren, Harry could feel the words directed at him.
"No. He needs to come to the realization on his own," Soren agreed, running a tired hand over his face as he thought it through. "If we tell him before he's ready he'll pull back. The bond will suffer and his resolve to see his responsibilities through will break beneath the weight of his stress and fear. His perceived responsibilities to the Wizarding world already weight heavily on him. Another aspect we will have to tackle."
"He's calm for the moment," Lothair responded, eying her for a moment before letting his gaze sweep over the rest of them. "Where are their wands?" he asked. Gwynn moved and handed him the six wands in question. It took only a moment for him to scan them and verify that none of them had been used to place the curse on Harry. He wasn't surprised. A wizarding child would not have had the strength or the understanding to cast it.
With nothing else to say to Lothair, his eyes moved to take in the two other occupants of the room. "Gwynn, you did very well today. Thank you for going with him, despite the risks," Soren offered the young elf an acknowledging smile and bowed slightly, causing a flush to spread across Gwynn's pale skin as she scrambled to return the bow. The High Lords rarely bowed to anyone and the fact that Soren, himself, was currently bowing to her had her so far through a loop that she wasn't even sure if she'd bowed properly. Things like this didn't happen to her.
Having returned to floating on his back, Harry jerked at the comment and sent himself back under the water. Popping up a moment later, he glared at her once again. "No," he snapped, pushing the hair out of his face for a second time. "That's ridiculous. We don't even like each other." Attraction? What a stupid suggestion! Of course they weren't attracted to each other. Hell, from the rumours circulating Hogwarts, Draco wasn't even sitting on the same side of the fence as Harry and there was a trail of broken hearts to prove it.
Lifting a hand, Lothair held up two identical bracelets. "That's why you shall be wearing these," he commented, tossing them each one. The band was made out of braided leather and had a small opal secured in the center. "Each of us has one and it will suppress the full extent of your magic. Which means you will only have access to a limited amount of power. You are not to remove them unless it is a matter of life or death. Understood?"
Harry raised an eyebrow at that. "If you bypassed the wards in Dumbledore's office, shouldn't you be able to do it here?"
Before Hermione could admonish him for talking with his mouth full, loud laughter echoed from the end of the Slytherin table, drawing Harry's attention. Draco was sitting with his usual group, casually talking away while the others laughed. Given the somewhat annoyed look on Zabhini's face, he had a pretty good idea what the blond git was talking about.
If he was honest, he was somewhat annoyed with himself for getting caught daydreaming like an idiot. Alright, it wasn't about being caught or daydreaming. He was annoyed that he was jealous of Parkinson, of all people. He was really trying to keep a lid on this bond but it was proving to be extremely difficult. He could feel it, like ... like a snake had burrowed inside of him. His chest ached painfully on a regular basis, the longer they spent apart the more nauseous and cold he felt. More importantly, his thoughts tended to darken the longer he denied the contact the bond craved.
Everything hurt. His legs hurt. His arms hurt. His ribs hurt. His fingers hurt. Everything hurt. His head, however, hurt even more. When he'd first tried to blink his eyes open the pain had been so intense his stomach had churned and pushed up what little he'd eaten that day. It had felt as though every nerve ending he had was burning. Even now, two days later, Harry still felt it as she sat atop Erebus. He felt sluggish both his body and his senses. All in all, he wasn't in any sort of shape to face not only Dumbledore but the entire population of Hogwarts. Draco had plainly told him it was his own damn fault and to suck it up.
Harry nodded, seeing the dismissal in her posture. He didn't like being confused and lately that's all he'd been was confused. Even his own body had betrayed him. He didn't even like Draco and yet he was willing to do almost anything to keep him alive. For the love of Merlin, he was all but excited at the prospect of having Draco around. This time last year he would have laughed at the very idea. With a final glance at the blond, he turned and headed back through the door. He needed some air, at the very least. There was far too much going through his mind at the moment and he needed to clear it out.
Draco only shrugged. He supposed it didn't really matter so long as he knew what the hell he was talking about, which shouldn't be hard since he was a wolf himself. The least of Draco's concerns was pack hierarchy. "Don't tell Potter, he'll probably take some sort of weird offence to it and force your Alpha to bite his head off out of sheer irritation."
Ignoring the stares he was getting, he rushed down into the dungeons, following a path he was surprised he even remembered until he found himself standing in front of the tapestry they had emerged from behind earlier. Passing through, he headed down the long staircase into the main chamber. Someone had filled the empty space with furniture, but he barely spared it a glance. He didn't have any interest in furniture.
It was probably the first logical question that had been directed at him since the meeting began. "I can't say for sure," Harry admitted, his eyes turning to Ilaria, "I've witnessed turned werewolves, wizards, and dementors. There's also been murmuring throughout the order that he's swayed some of the Giants." Harry's thoughts briefly shifted to Hagrid and the forest behind the half-giants hut. "It's safe to say that the Centaurs will not be joining him."
Harry had never been quiet so glad to hear that smug tone of Draco's. It offered a distraction for Aranel, pulling his attention from what might have been wrong with Ehlark to pin it on Draco. Ehlark, however, was not so easily distracted. Even from where he sat, Harry could see the other Elf's mind working to figure it out. As this eyes lifted, feeling Harry's stare on him, the brunette fixed a slightly suspicious look onto his face before turning his attention to where Aranel was arguing with Draco. Hopefully, Ehlark bought it enough to think that Harry thought his actions suspicious. Even as the guilt churned within him, he insisted that it was for the best in the end. They only had one more vote to secure.
Draco hesitated for a moment, his eyes flickering to his friends. "We need allies," he commented instead. "They could be useful. They have a better idea of what's going on than we do."
Long before the Scout could possibly form a response, Roland's slim fingers stiffened around the Elf's vocal cords in an iron grip before ripping his dangerously sharp nails from the body before him, the Elf's vocal cords sill clutched tightly in his fingers. The unfortunate messenger had not had the chance to scream before blood began to flow from the gaping hole in his throat in thick, sluggish waves.
"I'm aware of who she belongs to," Harry responded, far more worried about the delay then he was about what Ilaria would do to him for taking her. Surely whatever punishment she was going to dish out wouldn't last forever … he hoped. "You may inform her that I've taken Nyx at your earliest convenience."
"Clearly," Blaise commented with amusement, golden-brown eyes staring at him from across the table, "It's not every day that you show up in the middle of dinner with Potter at your side."
Before he could become too tempted by the pools of glistening water, Draco turned around and headed back the way he'd come. With two doors down there was only one left, which had to be the one he'd been originally looking for. Not surprised to find this door also unlocked, he silently slipped inside and closed it behind him. The room was decorated in the same green and cream as the rest of the rooms had been, but it was much more open. Larger than the sitting room he'd just come from, Draco found himself finally standing in Potter's room. The curtains on the room had been drawn, plunging the room into darkness, but with his heightened eyesight, he could make out the layout of the room just fine. Striding forward, he tugged open the curtains, allowing the moonlight to filter in and brighten the room if only a little bit.
"Getting involved with the Wizarding world is pointless. They will die off, one way or another. Let them kill each other and be done with it."
Harry flushed slightly, but didn't comment. Instead, he made a mental note to have Gwynn take him back into the city later. In the meantime, however, he let Ilaria manhandle him through the streets, navigating them with ease. It was clear that she was as comfortable in the city as she was in the Manor, which left him very little to be concerned about.
Snape's breath caught in his throat at the name, a sharp stab of pain jolting through his chest. Hardening his eyes and mind against Albus' subtly attempts at Legitimacy, Snape forced himself to respond with as little emotion as he could. "Unknown."
Spinning around, he headed out of the room, letting the door slam behind him. From the other side the rest of them could quite clearly hear the angry shout echoing through the main chamber.
The two of them clashed again and with each clash, Draco could feel the tension in the air rise. It wasn't quite the controlled build that Lothair had demonstrated earlier. In fact, it was nothing like that. It was reckless. Even as he blocked Potter's blows, he was instinctively drawing back, preparing himself for whatever backlash was coming.
Rosalind sighed. Here she was thinking he'd gotten over his stubbornness. Taking a moment she thought about it for a long moment. "The werewolves have very strong personalities," she started, eyeing the deep bruise she was currently dealing with, "who have tempers that are just as strong. When it comes to your bond, depending on how much these characteristics manifest, we might see a change of dominance."
She wasn't the only one startled. Suddenly there were four different wands pointed at him. Before the lot of them could hex the idiot, Draco reached out and placed a hand on Harry's chest, keeping him from advancing on Pansy and motioned with his other hand for the rest of them to lower their wands and signalling their hidden guards to stand down as well. "Relax, Potter, before you get yourself into trouble."
"Well, look at it this way," Ron commented, taking a huge bite out of his sandwich before continuing, "it can- get -uch worse."
Hedwig snapped at his outstretched fingers affectionately and ruffled her feathers in a means of greeting. As odd as it sounded, the sight caused a rush of feelings to pass through Harry. No matter how much he had changed, Hedwig still recognized him. He was the same old Harry to her. It gave him a small bit of hope that those he had been close to in the Wizarding world wouldn't pull away from him, now that he was different.
Harry couldn't help the look of annoyance that flickered across his face at that comment. Since volunteering to partner with him in their training sessions, Harry and Gwynn's had spent the vast majority of their time together. Harry rather enjoyed having another individual in the realm he could just be himself with. He liked having someone he could relax with … even though Gwynn rarely relaxed and received a distinct pleasure in pointing out all of his weaknesses. He was secretly terrified of the day he would introduce Gwynn to Hermione. They were far too similar for their own good … or his, for that matter. He really didn't need to have Gwynn lecture him on his poor form while Hermione lectured him on the historical relevance of swordsmanship. The very thought made him shudder with fear.
At the question, Harry stiffened again, glancing to Ilaria to see how she was going to introduce him. Was he supposed to be introducing himself to the general public. How much did they currently know about what was going on? Those questions, however, were rendered irrelevant as Ilaria only shrugged and responded with "A sheepish Prince in need of a real weapon," earning herself a glare.
"Send out the Wolves!" He hissed, releasing the Elf with a hard shove. The Werewolves needed to be eliminated and he wanted it done the first time. The Alpha Male, while not the most intelligent of beings, was the perfect individual for the job. He knew how they fought. He knew how they'd defend themselves. He, most importantly, knew how to slaughter them. "I want the entrails of every Wolf not bearing my crest scattered across the forests."
"It's not," Lothair responded, dryly. "Your body may have a connection to the element but it can't withstand a continuous flood of elemental magic. You will only be able to draw a determined amount of magic within you. If you unleash it too quickly or haphazardly, it'll be gone long before you're ready for it to be and the pressure of it will overwhelm you."
Draco just shrugged and turned his attention back to his own sword. "His hair always looks like he just got spit out of a tornado."
Soren, urged his mare out of line to fall into step beside Draco, the two of them speaking quietly. The sharp punch to his arm that had him scrambling to stay upright in his saddle prevented him from trying to hear what was being said ahead of him.
After a tense moment, Rosalind's hands slipped from their firm position on her hips. "A discussion it is," he nodded, turning and immediately leading the way back toward her office. If they were going to be going through with whatever ridiculous plan her mate was scheming, she was at least going to be preparing while he tried to explain himself. A blood transfusion and the initiating of such a high level bond wasn't easy work. She was going to have her hands completely full and there was very little that would keep her from being completely prepared for the responsibility.
Letting out a frustrated huff, Harry dropped an arm over his eyes. For once in his life he could honestly say that he wasn't happy to have received an owl from his obviously worried best friend.
Much to Harry's surprise, the group training sessions helped both Harry's skill and his confidence. Not only was he trying harder in order to prevent looking like a fool; Harry was also able to see that perfection wasn't expected. It was expected that each individual learn from his or her mistakes. If you were caught with your guard down it could be guaranteed that it wouldn't happen a second time. Of course, as much as Harry was learning from these sessions, they did have their downfalls. He could only accomplish so much with independent study. It simply wasn't the same as working with a sparing partner and that was where the problem lay. Harry had gone through three different partners and he was still faced with the same problem. Even though they were quite competent, none of the fifteen seemed to be willing to be the one to throw the Dark Prince to the ground or get their weapon beneath his defenses.
That stupid green eyed git was the single most important target of not only Voldemort but Dumbledore as well. Worse yet, the hopeless fool actually fell into line whenever the old bastard called for him. If Dumbledore demanded that they use him as a bargaining chip, Draco had no doubt that Potter would gladly hand him over believing that it was an act of some sort of greater good like the little soldier that he was.
"I think we've finished for the day," Soren responded, cutting off any further attempts at an apology. For the moment he was not interested in listening to one. "You're dismissed."
"I can't be positive. There were several wizarding potions in Mr. Malfoy's system prior to the attack, but I can't verify whether or not this is a direct response to what he had ingested. Since Mr. Malfoy did not take these potions willingly, he can't verify which potions were in his system. Beyond that, there is also the transfusion and the shift from human to elf to take into account. With so many influences, it's all but impossible to narrow it down to a specific moment."
a student!" she shot back indignantly. "Elves mature more slowly than humans given the fact that our lives as longer lived. We're not even considered mature until one hundred twenty four."
Draco felt a deep ache erupt in his chest at the thought of Narcissa. When he'd woken in captivity, Draco had demanded answers regarding his Mother's location but had been rewarded with nothing but a sneer and the strong backhand of Lucius Malfoy. His father's response had not left him with much hope. If Lucius treated his only heir with such distaste, Draco could only imagine how he had treated the woman he'd simply married to produce an heir. Draco had a very distinct impression that he would never see her again. It was an impression that left him feeling horribly alone. He'd though he'd known what that felt like, but up until now he'd only ever guessed at it. Now he truly was alone.
"The Dark Lord has grown impatient. They're coming. You have to leave immediately," with a quick flick of her wand, Draco was warmly dressed. Even in the middle of August, the evening air could often be quite chilly. Her eyes softened at the level of shock and fear in Draco's eyes. It should never of gotten that far, she knew, but she would do what she could to prevent the nights events from transpiring. Setting the bag at their feet, Narcissa placed a warm hand on Draco's cheek and soft kiss to his forehead. "You were not made for the life they want you to lead, Draco. It will kill you."
"You must have read ahead on your studies, Potter if you're so confident in your skills that you can show up late to my class."
The female shot Aranel a chilling look for the comment. Whatever Aranel had read in that look, it at least kept him quiet. It did not, however, remove the look of distaste from his feature.
Even as the wolf closed in on him, Draco could see the movement in the trees ahead of him. He was almost to the river. He was so close. Just a little further. As Draco moved around a large tree blocking the river from view, his foot caught in the tangled mess of its roots. Given the momentum of his body and the firm ancient strength of the tree's root, Draco hit the forest floor with a sickening crush, his arm twisted painfully beneath him. His vision swam as he fought to get his breath back and keep the pathetically limited contents of his stomach from being forced up. The pain was blinding as it mixed with the sheer panic of having the werewolf closing in on him. With nothing but desperation driving him forward, Draco forced himself up, his arm cradled against his chest as he stumbled toward the water.
"Yeah, yeah," Draco muttered, glancing up and down the hallway they were in. So far, he could retrace his steps from the Royal wing to the kitchen, the library, and the infirmary. There were still plenty of places to locate, at least of the ones he was aware of. He wasn't familiar with the place in order to know all that it held within it's walls, but he had a good guess that there was far more than even he could imagine. "Where's the armory?"
The page that Soren had left open in front of him was made up entirely of a woman's portrait. Her dark hair hung freely over her left shoulder, cascading down the pale skin of her arm in smooth waves while, in striking shades of scarlet, her clothing spoke of a time long forgotten. Below the image was scrawled two small pieces of information. First was her name and birth:
Soren had made a move to deny that claim, but Rosalind's sharp eyes had already pounced on it. "Don't argue with me. It was manipulation at it's finest. You prayed on his emotions. Plain and simple."
"What the hell are you doing out here?" Draco asked, ignoring the slight embarrassment he felt about having been caught so easily.
He wouldn't call them a nightmare, exactly. He didn't know what they were. He'd be there, watching the entire thing through the eyes of whoever this was happening to. It couldn't be him. He'd never been locked away like that. He'd felt young. Or whoever he was supposed to be had felt young. He'd sounded young, too. The terror he'd felt at the end was not something he'd ever felt as a child. It was something most children had never felt.
Narrowing his eyes at the other male, Soren slowly turned back to face his angry mate. "Perhaps we can all sit down and have a proper discussion about what's going to take place?" His tone was hesitant and slightly strained, but he maintained his relaxed posture. There was a perfectly good reason why the blood exchange should take place. If he had the chance to explain in full, perhaps they would also see the benefits to the situation. He did, however, also agree that there were possible negative side affects to rushing the bond, but in this instance, he sincerely believed the good out weighted the bad.
“Lord Harry Potter-Black.” Harry corrected between breaths, tasting blood in his mouth. He heard Ron bellow again, but apparently whoever had him wasn’t letting him go. Harry sighed, closing his eyes as he heard the murmurs and rustling around him as they pulled Ron away. It seemed no one was concerned for him, until he felt someone standing over him. Their magic was…
. So yes, I don’t think my efforts and sacrifice quite come to par. Not to mention I only lost one person in this war – and that was at the very beginning. But otherwise, I didn’t loose any loved ones this time.”
“Now, as far as have a teacher-supervisor, we decided it would be best to allow you all options. You may choose from any of the heads of house, or myself, as your teacher supervisor. As such, we will be the ones in charge of your discipline and mentoring. Understood? Good. Now, we’ll go around and see who wants who, shall we?”
“What do you mean you have changed?” The professor prodded. “Beside coming out of the war alive and killing the Dark Lord?” He watched as Harry smiled bitterly, those emerald eyes dimming with pain and grief and
His magic was out of control, flashing around the room in a mixture of green, silver, and black lightning. It cracked against the walls and singed the door. And Harry was still screaming, feeling his magic ripping out of him, trying to tear him apart and put him back together.
“It is a hard habit to break – concealing everything. I had to – in order to survive as a spy. Now that it is safe to be… myself… I still struggle with allowing it.”
that Lily had always had. That Harry used to have. Looking into his eyes now was like looking into death.
“It does. Now, you and the Slytherins will come with me to the Slytherin common room for the start of term speech. Come along now.” With that, he turned to leave, and his robes billowed as always. Draco wanted to learn how he always did that, and was awed when Harry performed a similar move.
“Very well. Come up here then, everyone else move the desks back.” They all did as they were told, and now everyone was waiting with anticipation, staring at Harry. Some with more awe than others, but all equally suspicious.  “Any time now.” The Headmistress snapped at him.
A concerned reader recently reached out to me, saying that their child had reported to them that Harry Potter – now known as Lord Harry James Potter-Black – had returned to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his final and eighth year of schooling. Of course, I had to investigate this.
matter, whether you think so or not. You were still part of the war, and a lot of stress was placed on you before, during, and after it. Even now there are lasting effects. You cannot fool me into thinking you are not more damaged than you appear.”
“Master Harry…” he started and then stopped when Harry sighed. Kreacher had learned to stop pressing his master when he sighed like that.
to hurt the other person. Secondly, it is affected by your wand movement. You must be precise, or you will miss your target. I know this because my own brother George had his ear cut off by this curse by Professor Snape – on accident, mind you – while trying to cut the hand off a death eater who was attacking my brother.” Ron winced and looked down, even as Bill’s own eyes were filled with sadness.
“Very well, we can add it on. I doubt you will have any issues with the class or with him – he is one of the more level-headed Weasleys.” Snape made a few annotations to the parchment before addressing Harry.
They made it to the castle in one piece, and watched as the first years got sorted. Looks like Penelope Edgewater was Hufflepuff. Good, the house was warm and friendly and would help her become her own person outside of her nervousness in no time. Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was about to put the Sorting Hat away when he started speaking again.
He did indeed find his friends in one of the last compartments, Blaise, Greg, Theodore, Millicent, and Pansy were all sitting and having a quiet conversation, ignoring the sixth occupant of the carriage. Draco noticed the man immediately, and pointed to him, mouthing
. He reminded himself again. He did not let his inner turmoil show, nor did he deign to respond to the angry Gryffindor. He simply stepped by him, choosing to head towards the stairs without comment. Ron growled.
“That was Mr. Longbottom’s reason, not Professor Sprout’s.” Snape finished for him as he opened his office door. “Take a seat, Potter-Black. Would you like some tea?” Harry snorted but sat in a chair near the hearth.
Teak went on and on in a lengthy lecture about why it was important for Animagi to be registered. She even went so far as to use Sirius Black’s escape from Azkaban as an example of the danger and unregistered Animagus could be. The witch didn’t seem to notice how Harry’s usually unnervingly empty gaze flashed with rage, not how he grinded his teeth and his muscles. Draco was waiting for someone to point out that Black had been proven innocent, posthumously, and that his escape from hell-hole in the ocean gave the poor man a few years of freedom to live (and love Harry) before his untimely death.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” Ron spat, taking a step forward. Harry looked over his ex-best mate, taking in how the red-head had finally grown into his height. He was no longer lanky and awkward, but had filled out and looked like a man – no longer a boy. Harry also noted that Ron hadn’t acquired any new scars since the war. That was good. Meant he was staying out of trouble. He again felt that irritating pain in his chest, but he clamped down on it and threw it away.
“I will register your Animagus form, Lord Potter-Black. Confirmed as a thestral.” Teak said, and now those who had not been able to see Harry let out gasps of understanding.
“No, Mr. Malfoy.” Harry said, stumbling to his feet. “I agreed to this, I intend to see it though. The more people who gain practice learning how to heal this curse, the better.” Draco closed his mouth, unable to argue. Bill grinned viciously.
“Do you need to go to the infirmary, Potter-Black?” Severus asked, noting how Harry was now struggling to pull himself to his feet. He also recognized the three potions the house-elf had brought the boy. They still stood untouched, as did most of Harry’s breakfast.
“I’m afraid this isn’t up for debate. Now, please come to the front of the class, draw your wand, and cast your patronus.” Harry closed his eyes, as if containing something particularly painful. But he stood up and walked up to the front of the class, staring straight at Professor Lupin the whole time. Once there, he turned to face the class, but did not draw his wand.
the person.” His eyes glinted malevolently as they bored into Harry’s form, where the dark-haired wizard sat unmoving at the back of class.
“It’s…. L’rd H’rry P’tt’r-Bl’ck.” He slurred, barely recognizing the shock of blond hair in front of him. He slumped to the side, only to caught by another pair of hands.
“Fine then. Just don’t make it a habit to be late in the future.” She conceded before launching into the rest of the briefing. Once done, they were sent on their ways to make rounds, and Draco volunteered to go to the back of the train – the others didn’t want to take it as the more… surly and uncooperative students tended to take the back compartments. Draco didn’t mind – in fact he knew plenty of the older Slytherins would be holed up back there, as not all their reputations had been saved after the war like his was. He didn’t miss the irony that the only student who took the mark was the first one society accepted again.
His master had told him all of this the night he broke his wand. It was shortly after the incident with the Weasley girl, and Harry was trying to cast a simple Lumos spell. Harry was still only seventeen, hadn’t even come into his magical inheritance, but he already had too much magic.
and then stood by the fire, motioning to the eighth-years to join the rest of the students. Draco stood next to Harry, as the others were shying away from the ex-Gryffindor. Draco shivered, noting that the air around the other boy was down-right
Harry did hear Lupin’s words, and they carved holes into him. Holes he ignored as he filled them with ice. War did not excuse him, no. But what about death? Did death excuse him?
“No.” This time, it was Pansy. “You saw how Pomfrey treated him after Weasel attacked him. She won’t treat him at all.” The three Slytherins paused in the hall, trying to decide what to do when they heard the loud crack of apparition.
The class moved quickly for Draco – while he was brewing. The potion only took about two hours to complete, and Draco was the first one two bring his perfectly brewed Dreamless Sleep to the Professor. Snape opened the stopper and sniffed his navy-blue concoction and nodded.
“I doubt anyone would mourn me for anything, Professor.” Harry sighed and sat up, struggling with trembling arms and cold, sore muscles.
The Houses are all different, yet the same. All have a degree of loyalty, some kind of signature wit, skill or intelligence in their own right, bravery in the strangest of places. You have all of those, yet none of what they desire.
“What are you doing, Mister Malfoy?” Harry asked, keeping his eyes glued to step twenty-one of the instructions.
protective. Hermione stomped up to his table and slammed her hands down. Harry thought his morning coffee was more interesting.
Harry merely sighed before opening his eyes. “I assume everyone in Gryffindor hates me enough for this to work. And most of the Slytherins and the remaining Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs.” He said, standing and walking towards Bill. “Very well. I’ll be your dummy.” Bill grinned and positioned Harry front and center of the class.
. Part of being proficient in potions was being able to recognize ingredients, according to the potions master. Luckily for Draco, he knew
“I heard – the other professors are all buzzing about it.” Severus wanted to groan. It had only been
I am damaged, it does not matter. Not anymore. I don’t have to explain myself to either of you. I am here for an education, not therapy.” He opened his eyes at last, his emerald voids bearing down on Snape with an oppressive weight.
that night. Truly died. And then he had chosen to come back – at least that is what he told Kreacher. Said that he couldn’t leave the task undone, unsure if his fellow warriors of the light would be able to defeat Lord Voldemort without him. But his master said this with regret, and Kreacher knew that Harry James Potter-Black constantly wished he had chosen to
“I am your head of house, not your mother or your nanny.” He continued on. “But you are not alone here. Self-preservation is important, yes. But so is the preservation of your family, of your friends. In Slytherin, we watch each other’s backs, despite what everyone else thinks. We just use cunning and manipulation instead of grand gestures and speeches. Our house needs to show the world what we are made of, we need to rebuild our reputation after the war. We cannot do that if we act like buffoons or throw hexes at those who annoy us. No. We must act with the dignity and pride that Salazar Slytherin himself would expect of us.
“He looks fine to me.” Madam Pomfrey said, rushing by. “I have no need for brawling riff-raff in my hospital, anyways.” Severus scowled at her retreating frame. It was unlike Poppy to refuse patients like that. But he supposed there was nothing he could do about it. He turned back to Harry, who was now standing – and swaying – on his feet.
“I didn’t need to.” With that, he lifted his right hand – what had been his wand hand – and cupped the air, as if he was holding something up. “Lumos.” He whispered, and light filled his palm. Wandless magic. Ridiculously fast and effortless wandless magic. The class stood still, not able to move. Suddenly, without a sound, the light went out.
“With all due respect, Ma’am.” Draco interjected before she could start screaming again. “What he did was perfectly legal, and should have been expected by Mrs. Teak when she started insulting his godfather and then issued a formal apology. It is not his fault she did not take consideration for her actions. He simply acted as the head of his household, a lord, and a proper wizard. You cannot make him undo the bind.” Minerva shot a glare towards him, then looked at Mrs. Teak. The smaller woman nodded, confirming that what Draco said was indeed true.
– and he proclaims his efforts were nothing, his sacrifices were nothing? What the hell? Was Harry so… disconnected… from the world that he genuinely thought that everyone else sacrificed more than him, simply because they had
“What about Divination and Care of Magical Creatures?” Snape asked, a little confused. It was well known that lazy students took Divination for an easy class, and Care of Magical Creatures for the same reason or because they liked Hagrid.
“As such, I think we should start with learning the Patronus charm. Now, I know many of you have already mastered this, so I ask you to help teach the others. But first, a demonstration!” He once against gazed over the class before stopping on Harry.
“Tiring, but interesting. We’ve never done start-of-term meetings like this, but I believe it to be beneficial. Not only for the students, but for us professors as well.”
“Everyone here hates me. But its all fresh. You’ve always hated me, therefor it isn’t at the forefront of your mind. You hate me because you always have, not because of something new. So, you will treat me as you always have. Even if you have not always been kind or fair to me, it is better treatment than what I can expect from the others. Does that answer your question, Professor Snape?” Harry did not drop the honorific for Snape, though he had done so often before. The man had his respect now, and would probably always will – whether the potions master wanted it or not.
“I know, Blaise! I know! Just… Help me get him up.” Draco said, holding Harry on his other side. They eventually got Harry on his feet and helped him out of the classroom. “Should we take him to the infirmary?”
“How poetic.” Bill commented once Harry was healed and Draco’s incantation had stopped. Draco turned his head to look at the professor. “That you would be the one to heal the man who had cast the very same curse on you.” Again, there were gasps around the class. Draco stood, anger boiling through his veins.
a dark wizard now, and had indeed abandoned the ways of the Light. Draco thought it had more to do with his lifeless eyes.
“There is precedent, Headmistress. It is not common, for it is not often needed. But it is needed now. May I proceed?” The hat asked, his voice dripping with sassiness. Draco quite liked the Sorting Hat.
“Are you able to take Harry to the dorms?” Draco asked, knowing the elf could apparate within the walls of the castle, unlike themselves.
“Lord Potter-Black, Professor Lupin.” Harry corrected. “Secondly, I refuse to demonstrate.” Lupin’s eyes grew dark again, and his mouth formed a thin line.
But Harry woke and got ready for the day, finding that the hot shower did nothing to warm him up, and that he was indeed as pale as he thought he was when he looked in the mirror. Luckily, he was able to shower and get ready without anyone else coming into the bathroom this time. He would take that one small victory, knowing what the day would become due to the article that was printed yesterday.
of the potions he has taken since arriving at Hogwarts. Bring me the empty bottles and anything else noteworthy. I trust your judgement.” She nodded and with another pop, her and Kreacher disappeared.
“The potions that house-elf brought him this morning, and his condition over the last few days. He has been dependent on Dreamless Sleep for a long time. Even before that beating he took this morning, he didn’t look right.”
Harry sighed and then closed his eyes. Then he started to change. He fell to all fours, his limbs elongating and his skin turned black and he sprouted large, leathery wings. The class finally stood still, some in fear and disgust, others in confusion when his transformation was complete. Draco blinked, trying to understand what he was seeing.
Harry shrugged, but kept to his work. Draco did as he had promised, he simply watched Harry work. Watched as the man returned to the textbook for each step, laboring over each step for minutes as if he was reading paragraphs instead of one sentence. He saw as Harry traces the words slowly with his finger, guiding himself through the sentence under his breath.
The first day of class, was actually not filled with classes. Instead, the heads of each house were holding meetings with their students to ascertain their interests and goals, and to set up their time tables. The first years were split by their age groups, and the two groups would then meet with their head of house in their group. This was because the first years all took the same classes, but meeting with their head of house would help them understand the expectations they would be held to while in the school.
“Not even the nargles and wrackspurts want to mess with you, anymore.” She said in her ever-dreamy voice.
“Thank you for passing on the message, Mister Longbottom. I’ll take my leave.” With that, Harry turned to leave – not as efficiently as usual due to the beating he took on Friday – but he still managed to get his robes to billow behind himself. Neville watched, tense and uncertain as the man he once knew as
“I do.” Harry replied quietly as he went to reach for an ingredient. He hissed in pain as shot of pain ran through his shoulder. Draco rushed over to him.
As he completed that thought, Kreacher popped up next to him with a loud crack. “Does Master require anything of Kreacher, my Lord?” The elf asked.
. As mister is not my title, and Harry is reserved for close friends and family – and since I have none of those, you are not included.”
starting the brewing process, and Draco frowned. If Harry had recognized the potion right away, he should be almost done by now. Not just barely starting on it. He secretly watched Harry work for the next hour, ignoring the way Blaise was eyeing him.
A few people turned pale at that, but no one left. Bill grinned. “Good! Well then. To start, we are going to learn Sectumsempra and its counter curse.” Draco looked aghast at that statement, remembering
“Shortly after the war.” The class let out a collective gasp. The wizard standing in front of them, the very man who
“Do you not think you sacrificed things as well?” Snape asked, interrupting Draco’s thoughts. Harry blinked slowly and stared for a second at the professor before responding.
The class (minus Harry), warmly welcomed the witch, some even asking about her work at the Ministry as she passed by. Harry remained silent, but was clearly paying attention. “It is a pleasure to meet all of you.” She said, her eyes exuding nothing but warmth – until they passed over Harry. Those hazel eyes hardened, but she said nothing and her gaze moved on. “I will be going over the law regarding Animagi, the reason for registration, and the process on becoming a registered Animagus. Now, on the slight chance any of you are already Animagi – you will not be punished for registering late. The Ministry acknowledges why many would have secretly become Animagi during the war.” Harry shifted slightly in his seat, the only movement the boy had made since sitting down at his desk, but otherwise kept his attention on Mrs. Teak.
“What happened to Master Harry?” croaked the elderly house-elf, almost causing Blaise and Draco to drop Harry.
he was unstable. Kreacher knew it too. But Kreacher couldn’t kill his master. Even his master couldn’t kill himself. And his master had
“I cannot believe you,” the Headmistress turned back to Harry, bearing down on him with disappointed, angry eyes. “That the son of two of my favorite students would do such a thing so easily, so readily. I once thought you could have been one of the strongest, most pure wizards the world would have ever known. Clearly I was wrong.” She was turning away to stalk her way back to the front of the class when Harry spoke, his voice barely a whisper.
“Yes, six courses.” Harry confirmed, blandly. For whatever reason, Snape had a sinking feeling in his gut about Harry taking the Curses class. But there was nothing he could do about an unfounded hunch.
“Just… Don’t be cruel to him.” Draco whispered from the couch. Severus started and stared at his godson. “Don’t look at me like that. You know what I mean. You’ve never like him, and it showed. But… he doesn’t need that on top of everything else… on top of everyone else and the way they treat him. You know better now. You are also allowed to show compassion now that the war is over.” Draco turned his face away, his pale cheeks tinted pink with embarrassment.
They managed to get Harry onto a stretcher and down to the dungeons. Draco couldn’t help the way his heart pounded painfully in his chest every time his looked down at Harry. Harry who had clearly been stuck in a flashback while being repeatedly hit by Sectumsempra and subsequently healed over and over and over again. Harry who was pale and quiet with robes ripped to smithereens. Harry who willingly let himself be tortured, who said he didn’t deserve forgiveness.
“Thank you, Potter-Black.” Professor Snape finally said after Harry had settled into his chair. “But we did not win the war, in the end. You did.” Harry snorted indignantly.
“Dunno.” Greg said. “Bloke’s been sittin’ there since before we got on, and he’s been asleep the whole time. Doesn’t even have a trunk or nothin’.” Draco sighed. He did prefer knowing who he was sitting with, you know, because it was
Harry speaks with Snape and Draco, and attends his first class of the year – DADA with Professor Lupin.
work together. Today, you will identify and brew the correct potion based on the list of ingredients. You have the full four hours of class to brew the correct potion.” With that, he sat at his desk at the front of the room. Draco smirked. This was too easy.
He stepped into the room, and suddenly the buzz of conversation halted. He looked up to find people he once called friends – some closer to
So, it went to Harry, by right of conquest. Because Harry had fought Lord Voldemort, had won, and had killed Tom Riddle – the last heir of Slytherin.
to go see Madam Pomfrey, as I suspect I may have a concussion. I’m not pressing charges, nor am I going to seek revenge against him.” He paused and finally let out the sigh he had been holding in. “So, what do you want from me?” Bill continued to glare at him, while Lupin looked at him with a gaze mixed with anger, sadness, and regret.
“Formal wizarding apologies are binding magic at the basest of levels. Parseltongue provides the strongest binding – it will never break.” Harry informed her, and again Teak looked pale. Draco sniggered to himself.
“Stop, Mr. Malfoy.” Said a soft, yet commanding voice from the very wizard he had just healed. Draco turned to look at him, tears pooling in his eyes.
“I was saying that I don’t think Harry’s muggle relatives ever taught him how to read properly. We need to find a way to help him.” Draco said, biting his lip with anxiety and worry.
“I do not have a wand.” Harry said simply, as if it was no surprise or shock that he was a full-grown wizard walking around without a wand.
“I’m s’rry.” Harry said, turning his glassy, dazed eyes towards the blonde. “For casting… Sectu-Sectumsem-Sectumsempra… on you. I didn’t know.”
He looked around, noticing that most of the other students were murmuring in agreement with the Headmistress’ assessment. Except for his own Slytherin’s, who wore subdued faces – masks hiding their own anger at the blatant mistreatment of a wizard based on assumptions of his character, rather than his own merit. Blaise met his look, and they shared an understanding.
Harry reminded himself, taking a deep breath and shelving his anger away with the rest of his emotions.
Kreacher had watched, alone, when his master finally received the full brunt of his wizarding inheritance at nineteen. Some received it at seventeen, like they did in the old days. But now, it was more popular to let a witch or wizard become an adult with free reign over their magic for two years before burdening them with
“Here. Take the ingredients I’ve already gathered. No one will know.” He handed Harry all the ingredients for the potion and then ushered him out of the store room before anyone saw. Harry looked like he was about to say thank you when Hermione and Terry Boot entered. Draco turned away from the entrance and quickly re-gathered the required ingredients. The tricky part about Severus’ store room for his NEWT-Level class was that it
that this curse exists, and how to handle it.” When no one else argued, he nodded and wrote the spell down on the board, along with a short illustration of its wand movement.
, he repeated to himself. He wanted to laugh at this ridiculous situation, but found that he couldn’t. Instead he closed his eyes and held back a sigh.
If Severus had to make an educated guess, Harry had already tried. At least once, if not multiple times. And the only reason the man was still here, still living, was because his own magic would not let him die.
“Severus?” Draco asked, concerned at his godfather’s sudden paleness and silent, far-away look. Severus snapped back into himself.
“He is more like me than I realized.” Again, Draco gave him an incredulous look. Severus sighed and leaned back onto his desk. “I know you father told you about my childhood.” Draco grew serious and nodded.
Harry eyed them one by one. They all hated him, even Sprout and Flitwick. He let out a resigned sigh. “I suppose it will have to be Professor Snape, Headmistress.”
“I had hoped for an explanation.” Lupin said, resigned. “But it is clear that you will not give us one. I merely wish to understand why you’ve changed so much. The boy that I knew wouldn’t have done all those things. He would not have abandoned Ginny like that. I wanted to know what happened to you.” Harry gave Lupin a long, hard look – ignoring Bill completely.
As always, I love you guys for all of your support and everything. It truly helps to know that you guys are out there and waiting to read this thing. Thank you for sticking with me. <3
Snape wanted to hit the boy upside the head, but he knew that no matter what he said, Harry would not listen. Just as Draco did not listen in his sixth-year. He had thought he was done with young people having the eyes of dead men, but apparently not.
. Even a simple walk to the library was a marathon for his master, who no doubt was accosted by the constant memories the castle served him.
"Too bad," she sighed, leaning forward slightly, eyeing the image of his old hairstyle. "I would have liked to been the one to shave it all off."
"I can help him," he responded. Soren lowered himself into a kneeling position in order to look calmly into Harry's eyes, rapidly changing eyes. It took several long moments before the red started to fade from them, the rest of his eyes lightening as it did. It was only then that Soren pressed on, knowing that if he attempted anything sooner, Harry would attack him with intent to kill. His instincts were taking over and the only thing Soren could do was wait. "Allow me through and I can help him."
Harry wasn't entirely sure it was a good idea to give her anything of the sort. The Elves already had a long life span. They could be killed with a blade, but they were immune to age and disease. That did not, however, ease his mind. There was something about the woman that had Harry on edge. She was a snake in the grass and he wasn't so certain that she wouldn't bite if given the chance.
Despite the general conversation and the brief mention of himself, it seemed as though he was intruding on something that he was not meant to be a part of: a connection between the three High Lords that, in no way, included him. He had to fight the sensation to take a step back and give them their privacy. It was the same sensation that he felt at the Weasleys on occasion. He was both inside and outside of the current events. Before his instincts could take over completely, Harry found those brilliant blue eyes return to him, pinning him once again to the spot. There was something about the Lady of the Southern Lands that set her apart from the others. There was something that commanded his constant respect and attention.
Draco still hadn't turned around, instead choosing to scowl darkly at Gabriel's quickly retreating form. He was going to kill that idiot. Wolves or not. Stealing himself with a variety of ways to accomplish said feat, he finally turned to find Potter glaring at him, emerald fire flashing in his eyes. He supposed that was better than the cold wall he'd been getting. The brunette, however, was not alone. Standing to his left and a few steps behind was Gwynn who looked like she was trying to disappear into the shadows.
As he watched the other Elf , his anger spiked as did his magic, and he suddenly found the world shifting. The colour blurred for a moment before he could feel himself looking out through Ehlark's eyes, the glance focused on the shifting muscle in Aranel's jaw as the other Elf clamped it shut. Panicking, he instinctively jerked himself backwards. The action was both mentally and physically, causing his back to slam back abruptly into the back of his chair, interrupting whatever it was that Faelyn had been saying.
"Are you trying to say that one of us let the brat through?" Lothair snapped, looking as disgusted by the prospect as he sounded. "You really have lost your mind."
Alright, so perhaps he was more than slightly horrified. Merlin, if he didn't know better he was starting to think he was losing his mind. Draco was his rival. They hated each other and that was all there was too it. He was defending him because of Lothair's rather obvious dislike of all things human and Harry, himself, had been human. That was why he was bothered by it. It really had nothing to do with Draco. He would have helped anyone had they been attacked by a werewolf. The fact that he'd felt such a strong desire to be by the blonde's side was something he was going to simply forget about. A brief moment of insanity. That was all.
Glancing up, she found Neville just making it to the table. He had dirt on his face and if she wasn't mistaken, grass stains on his knees. "Neville, what happened to you?"
"It's fine," she said, shaking her head. Closing the book, she moved it off the table so Neville had a place to sit. "You're already here, you should eat."
If either of them had been expecting to end the night without a confrontation, Harry and Draco were sorely disappointed when they both received a memo near the end of dinner informing them that they had been summoned to the Dumbledore's office. Harry had internally sighed but had gone without complaint when Lothair had come to collect him. He felt distinctly like a child being led to face the consequences of his actions.
Draco chose that moment to tune out the loud conversation taking place beside him, his eyes flickering around the room as he ate. There were Elves scurrying about the place, going about their assigned jobs. Some were preparing dishes. Others were working the ovens. Some were filling large platters with food and disappearing from the room to where, Draco assumed, they would be serving breakfast to the majority of the Manor's inhabitants.
Perhaps it was the wording Soren used, but Harry suddenly found himself not so sure in his resolve. Some part of him warned against such a thing. He couldn't shake the feeling that he shouldn't be agreeing to this. That something terrible could happen to both of them if he were to allow this. "Feed off of me? Why does it have to be me?" he asked, taking a step away from both Soren and the bed where Draco's prone form lay. He couldn't pinpoint the exact reason but he had a feeling that by allowing Draco to drink his blood, he would be admitting something. Agreeing to something. He felt like he'd be crossing a line he could never come back from. "Why can't he just drink Dragon blood … like I did?"
On one hand, Soren did want the situation to spiral out of control. On the other, Harry's bond with Draco was demanding retribution. Harry was going to need to feel like he had some control over the blond's protection or things would spiral out of control in an entirely different direction. Then there was Soren's interest in seeing how Harry would handle the situation if left to his own devices. They couldn't keep making decisions for him. Perhaps a trial of sorts was necessary to determine which direction to take when it came to Harry's instruction.
Replacing the locking charm that had been on the door, Draco moved further into the classroom. Coming to a stop at the front row of desks, he casually leaned against it, legs crossed at the ankles and arms crossed over his chest. "Have you found my mother?"
Stepping into the room, his feet didn't meet the smooth polished stone he'd just left. Instead, they found soft grass, the earth indenting beneath his weight. The vaulted ceiling was roughly three stories above him if he had to take a guess, and ahead of him was what he could only assume was the royal bathing room. The grass stretched out until it reached smooth stone, polished by the constant flow of water. The stone climbed it's way up, leveling out into various platforms on different levels that contained at least one pool of varying size and depth, until finally it reached the top where the steady flow of a waterfall fell to ensure the constant presence of fresh water. Even greater still, Draco could tell from where he stood that the temperature of that water was not that of a regular waterfall, he could see the wafting steam as it filled each pool and he had a growing suspicion that should he touch it, he'd find it to be the perfect temperature.
The Elf, catching the flush on Harry's cheeks, just smiled and waved. "Akkar," he introduced, offering Harry a small bow of his head. "It's a pleasure to meet you."
The wolves muscles tenses as though he was going to spring forward, causing Harry to brace himself for the expected attack, but before anything could happen between the two of them, Soren interfered. "This is not the time or the place for politics," his voice, soothing and calm, washed over all of them. "We will return to the Manor to discuss the changes of the law. We are wasting time as we argue."
Draco faltered at that thought. Despite his relative freedom, he wasn't any closer to discovering whether or not he could afford to trust Severus Snape. He assumed that his sudden relocation might have something to do with the unfamiliar potion he'd ingested, but even with his level of knowledge on the subject, Draco simply couldn't recall a potion meant to transport an individual out of a heavily warded room, let alone a warded room and unplottable Manor. It certainly didn't help Draco disposition toward his head of House to know that the man had stood by and watched his Father torture him. Given his debatable allegiances, Draco was aware that doing so might have caused more problems for Severus then what he had done, but that information did little to sooth his own wounds.
His eyes skimmed over Draco briefly before they moved to take in the five new and unfamiliar Elves sitting in the room. He'd never met any of them before but Soren had given him a brief rundown of the basics.
Hermione continued to glare at Ron for a moment before she pulled her eyes away from him and focused on Harry. "Nothing," she shrugged. "Or at least as far as we know. When you went missing from your Aunt's the entire order was focused on finding you and then-" she hesitated for a moment, debating her words, "-when we found out you were settling into your inheritance, the order has gone silent. Not even the twins can get any information out of them."
Dressing in a pair of light tan trousers, dark brown boots, and a deep blue tunic, Draco quietly left his room. There was an undercurrent of energy rolling beneath his skin and sitting in his room till the rest of the castle had stirred was not something that he was interested in doing. Of course, this left him with a small dilemma. Where was it that he was going to go? He recalled where the library was, but that would do nothing for all the pent up tension the dream had created within him. He could go and have breakfast, of course, but he had yet to figure out where the kitchens were. Honestly, he hadn't figured out where a lot of things were. Since his arrival, most of his time had been spent between the infirmary, the library, and his own rooms.
The sound of hoof beats against the Earth drew him from his internal thoughts, his eyes easily spotting the scout they had sent ahead of them. "They arrived roughly twenty minutes ago. Five of them."
With a long-suffering look on his face, Harry summoned his bow and quiver of arrows. It was going to be a
Harry bristled at the insult. He felt guilty over the fact that Draco had not had a say in which course of action Harry had taken, but that didn't mean Gwen deserved to be targeted by his anger either. It had not been her fault. "If you have a problem, Malfoy, take it up with me. Gwen doesn't have anything to do with it!"
She laughed again. It had been a long while since she'd had to deal with a moody teenager. Sure, there were young recruits in the army but Ilaria rarely dealt with them. Those in her personal guard were seasoned warriors and not quite so prone to melodramatics. She supposed if she and Caedmon sired children in the future, she'd have something to reference. The thought amused her more than it probably should and she debated sharing it with the young man beside her. Given his rather pathetic state, however, she decided against it.
The larger of the Wolves let out a loud growl of anger, taking a step toward Harry before both Lothair and Ilaria's swords were restricting him from moving any closer. "You can not ban us without council, Dark Prince," he responded, his tone picking up a mocking tone when he addressed Harry's title. "The law decrees that we may not hunt Elves, but it has no other stipulations. We can and will hunt humans."
"Certainly," she commented, though the slight upturn at the corner of her mouth told Harry she might already know what he was going to say.
It wasn't exactly what Harry had wanted to hear, but it did what it could to sooth his worry and nervousness. He'd been surprised to see Ilaria and Lothair still within the Infirmary when he'd arrived and his nervousness had only increased when he'd been told that their combined effort with Soren and Rosalind was needed in order to stabilize and maintain the magic needed to adopt such a change in Draco. Even without knowing the full details of what was about to happen, Harry could tell that this was significant on more than one level.
Seeing the question in his eyes, she shrugged. "When he ingests your blood, he'll become an Elf. Anything else in his blood will be expelled, just as it was for you. There will be nothing to distinguishing him from the rest of us."
That only irritated him further. A public confrontation with Draco and his lackeys was most certainly not worth it ... and yet, he thought it was completely worth it. His entire body called for the confrontation. It'd bring them closer and then maybe the pressure would let off a bit and he could refocus on what he needed to do.
"That hum?" Harry muttered, focusing. It seemed to be coming from a variety of directions and he couldn't understand why no one else could hear it.
Draco finally turned to look at him, but Harry wished he hadn't. His look was so full of exasperation that he actually started to feel a little sheepish about having asked. He could already head the sarcastic comment before it even left Draco's lips. "I'm looking for a back scratcher, Potter, why the hell do you think I need the armory for?"
By the time he'd arrived back in the medical ward, dressed casually in deep-green trousers and a white tunic, Harry couldn't help but exude his nervousness. Soren had felt it the moment the boy had stepped into the room. Sharing a brief look with Rosalind, he excused himself and move to meet Harry. The green eyes had immediately searched out the one occupied bed in the ward and Soren had easily read the indecision within their depths. Moving to block the Harry's sight of the prone form, Soren stopped and greeted him formerly, drawing Harry's attention towards him. "Might I have a word, my Lord?"
singular. Contrary to popular belief, this situation is not about yourself. It is about the survival of an entire Kingdom. This series of events was put into place generations before you entered into this world and it will continue long after you have left it."
"That's not out of the ordinary," Harry commented, urging his horse up to where Soren and Ilaria were sitting. "The wouldn't have come without them."
"We will absolutely not be going to the hot spring," she spluttered, shooting him an irritated look. Harry always seemed to bring that up whenever he wanted to distract her. There had been rumours after that incident. The thought of those whispered speculations still made her heat up with embarrassment. "Besides, it's not like you can afford to miss practice anyway."
Severus didn't press further. It was clear to him that Draco had no intention of letting that hinder him and, frankly, he was just as interested in discovering whether or not the Malfoy matriarch was still among the living. If Draco and his new found connection with the Elves could assist in that matter, he was more willing to allow them the opportunity to do so.
His explanation was cut short by the sudden force of Draco's fist slamming into his face. Harry had barely seen him move. It had been nothing but a blur and an explosion of pain. The force of the punch had forced Harry to stumble back in surprise, vaguely aware of the surprised gasp from Gwen.
"Don't you "love" me!" She shot back, hands planted firmly on her hips and glaring up at her mate as though the eight inch height difference didn't exist. For being as small as she was, she had a distinct ability to look down on an individual no matter their height or position. "You had best have an extraordinary reason for manipulating the Dark Prince as you did."
Soren did not wait for further permission; enough time had already slipped by. The window of opportunity was almost gone. Kneeling beside Draco's body, Soren let his eyes slipped closed, a single hand hovering over Draco's chest. For several long seconds he remained this way, causing Harry already nervous posture to tense. He was just about to comment on Soren's lack of movement when his eyes opened again, only rather then the dark, alert pupils he was used to seeing, Soren's eyes where clouded. The milky substance that had covered his eyes barely allowed for their true colour to be seen. Soren's hand stilled just above Draco's heart and for the briefest moment, Harry could have sworn the tips of his long finger's had started to glow.
Glancing from Lothair, Ilaria, to Soren, Harry hoped that at least one of them would inform him of what was going on. Ilaria was an enigma that he had no certainty about, but he hoped that, even if she turned him down, Soren would offer some sort of explanation. He had not disappointed Harry in the past and Harry hoped that would hold true for a little while longer. "What's going on?"
"I understand that you mean well,"Soren continued, cutting off the conversation between the two and allowed Draco the chance to shift his eyes to the Potions master standing behind the Headmaster. The slight turn of the man's head told Draco that Dumbledore did not know the entirety and that barb had been the extent of the man's knowledge. It also made him realize that Snape knew more, which meant he needed to find an opportunity to speak with him. His attention shifted back to Soren as the Elf continued. "But your concern is no longer necessary. Harry has found his place in the world and revenge is not something that he needs in order to find himself at home."
There was silence around the room as Harry's eyes moved to each of them. Faelyn's thoughts were churning behind her eyes but he couldn't tell in which direction they would make her lead. There was no expression on Oriss face for Harry to judge if he had even been listening. Aranel looked like he wanted to argue the point further but was refraining himself from doing so and Ehlark kept shooting curious looks to Aranel, which had Harry fighting back a low growl of annoyance.
He supposed she had a point. He shouldn't have used her for his own revenge. "Sorry," he muttered, feeling a little guilty for it. It wasn't her fault that Draco was so bloody frustrating. Nor was it really her fault that he seemed to have such a dislike for her or the fact that he might show some form of happiness. Maybe scowling all he time really was the answer. At least then the prat wouldn't be so temperamental all the bloody time.
Several heads around the table nodded at that, falling into the ever-present logic of the Werewolf. It was true. There was no one who knew the Potter's better than Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. The two had been friends with the couple both inside and outside of Hogwarts. Surely, they would not have been able to hide something like that from two of their closest friends.
Harry shifted in his seat again. "You're permitted to leave the grounds to return to the pack as per your obligations to your family but speak with Draco and the guards prior to leaving. Your main priority is to ensure his ability to adapt to any of the traits he'll develop due to the lycanthropy. You'll also be given your own rooms in the manor. Use them or don't. It's your choice."
"He paid us a little visit," Lothair added, moving away from where he had been leaning against the wall. His tone was dark and the loathing could be heard in every syllable. "And he knew damn well that it was not you who rode with us."
Reaching the Potions classroom, he found the door still locked. Lifting a hand, he exercised some of his magic and lifted the spell holding it closed. With a brief knock, he glanced down the length of the hallway before moving inside. He wasn't at all surprised to find a wand pointed in his direction. He had just broken in, after all.
Within his chest Harry could feel his heart racing, his blood singing as it was pumped through his veins at an alarming rate. His mind was caught between the cool sensations created by the gentle touch and the confusion surrounding what was taking place. He couldn't remember how he had come to be within this particular circle of arms but he knew, with every part of his heart, that if he pulled away he'd be physically pained. He belonged there and the thought of leaving was no longer an option. What surprised him the most was that even with every thing he was feeling, Harry could still feel the pulse that beat beneath the pale skin of the arms that held him: each beat echoing his own. Every time his heart skipped a beat Harry could feel an identical pattern pulsing against his shoulder blade. Whoever it was, their heart beat with Harry's.
The witch balked at the hissing sounds, and Draco wanted to laugh. Of course, no one in the classroom could understand Harry, so the snake-words only increased the tension. Teak looked a little pale, as if she was worried that Harry had declined her apology – and what that would mean. Harry broke the tension shortly after, though.
“Very good, Ron.” Bill praised before turning to the Slytherins. “Draco, the counter incantation to heal – if you would.” Draco felt the world spinning around him, his focused narrowed down to the bleeding man in front of him. He didn’t remember kneeling down next to Harry, nor pulling out his wand.
No, the coward, he left and secluded himself in a house full of dark artifacts and knowledge. Never to be seen again, until now. At Hogwarts. And even she knows something is wrong. Even the Sorting Hat has rejected him.
– staring at him with open hatred and contempt. He chose to not react, keeping his face as blank and empty as his eyes. A quick scan of the room told him that none of the professors had stuck around for this little reunion, leaving him to the wolves. No surprise there. They all hated him now, too.
