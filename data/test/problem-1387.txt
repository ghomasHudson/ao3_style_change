Harry walked up to his room deep in thought. That was the first time he could remember having a civil conversation with the man that didn't leave him walking away wanting to hurt him in the end. If they could continue this civility then maybe having Malfoy stay until his affairs were sorted wouldn't be as difficult as Ron had insisted it would be. Harry found himself thinking over their brief interaction. Malfoy seemed to be lacking his trademark masks that Harry hated so much. The whole situation puzzled him and actually gave him a bit of a headache, so Harry decided to only take the incident at face value, opting to mull it over further in the morning after he'd had some sleep.
“What, love?”
“Yes, but not that one, remember the other part to it?”
"Is that all this is about?" Nott demanded exasperated, he knew that the girl was crazy, but following her was the only way to get himself closer to the inner circle, just where he wanted to be.
.” The light from his wand was so bright that Harry had to cover his eyes with one hand while he he made sure to hold his wand hand steady to direct the spell at the barrier. He used all of the dreams he’d had of his parents and what type of life he might have had, the love he would have felt, to give more power to the spell. The light seemed to last a lifetime and Harry only hoped that he might have felt enough love in his life that this would work.
"Aren't we doing the duel presentation next week?" Draco asked absentmindedly.
"Slow down, we're both okay." Harry reassured and Luna nodded slowly from her place still in Harry's arms.
"Who could have done this?" Katie asked. She had disentangled herself from Ginny, allowing Draco to take over, and was standing beside Harry, eyeing the message cautiously. She had watched Harry do the advanced charms necessary to detect residue magic and while she trusted his wand work, she was still weary to get too close to the gruesome mess.
"Don't you worry love." Draco grinned. He reached over to the drawer of the nightstand and took out a toy that Harry couldn't see. Carefully, Draco reached behind his back and slipped a cock ring on Harry, grinning when the other boy realized what was happening. He then made quick work of preparing himself, making sure not to stretch himself too much. He loved the feel of Harry filling him completely and he knew that the extra tightness would drive the green-eyed boy crazy especially since his cock was over sensitive with the ring on.
"I assure you, My Lord, that I would have let their attack slide had they not continuously caused a scene. If I am to try to work my way in with Potter then I have to at least remove them from the school."
“Indeed.” Harry paused, not satisfied with the answer, but seeing no other options. “But yes I am sure. Where will we leave from?” Harry knew that getting angry would be pointless and he took the ugly feeling and pushed it deep within himself, past his mental shields and out of his mind. He would have time to be angry later, but now he had a job to do.
"Later, children." Harry laughed before turning to face the silent group before him. "I know that you all have a lot of questions which is why I called this meeting. We are going to do our best to answer all of your questions, but you have to understand that not everything can be answered. I know that many of you want your questions answered now, but I am asking you all to wait your turn. I'm sure a lot of you have similar questions and I want to make sure that everyone can hear us."
"I would never expect that.
Ginny, Harry knew, had learned how to duel from years of fighting with and being trained by her six older brothers. Her spell casting abilities where much more advanced than Draco, something she would have learned from having to deal with her brothers, but Draco had a clear advantage. While Ginny dueled in what could only be described as a street method, Draco's refined footwork and perfect balance showed that he had been trained by a professional duelist, most likely hired by his father. True to his Slytherin nature, Draco was relying on his own strength, turning it against the girl by using her own momentum to trip her up. While she was casting spells faster than he could keep up, he continued to dance around her in a dizzying pattern until he was sure that he had her completely unbalanced.
"But if he's mad at me why would he let me-"
“I’m sorry, everything that’s been happening has gotten me paranoid.” Draco shook his head to clear his thoughts and the Gryffindor nodded her understanding. “I’m going to go try and talk to him.”
"She's asleep. I went to bring her extra blankets, but I guess she didn't need them." Draco walked into his and Harry's bedroom, closing the door behind him.
"I don't want to pressure you into anything." Harry said, breaking the silence. It had startled Draco, who was actually starting to fall asleep.

Draco smiled fondly of the memory from that morning and he knew exactly what he wanted to do to thank Harry for all of his kindness.
Draco took a deep breath at the sound and took up the first quaffle. He watched Ron carefully, beginning to dart quickly left and right in front of the goals before hurling the ball into the center hoop, a pass that Ron easily caught.
"As much as Salazar and Godric can grant us."

“We have a deal.”
Jaculus snapped forward before recoiling when Harry lifted his wand.
"You asked for it." Splitting into a grin, Harry began to pick up his pace, moving slightly faster trying to keep a rhythm without losing control. The noises Draco was making were driving him crazy and Harry soon forgot about going easy, instead pounding into him until his release was close.
"Watch it, Zabini." Ron jumped in front of his sister.
Draco thought, filing Harry's reaction to his smile away in the back of his mind for a rainy day.
"It's okay, it's okay to be scared. What happened, we can help." Harry drew circles on his back with one hand, doing his best to calm the blond.
Draco watched Ron carefully as Pansy took a seat at the table. He knew that Harry had purposely made it so that Ron was forced to interact with the girl. The sooner they got over any animosity, the faster they could move on with the important business at hand. Ginny and Hermione where sure to have their own questions, but they were at least smart enough to wait and keep their thoughts to themselves. Draco wondered if the other four who had yet to arrive would be a problem, but he doubted it. They generally took Harry's lead.
"I never thought of cooking like potion making before. I probably would have done better in Hogwarts, otherwise." Harry laughed at the thought, shaking his head more to himself than to his companion, but Draco chuckled as well.
"And I thought that that was on of my better qualities." Harry grinned back.
"Is that really a question?" Harry took a seat by the fire, setting it with a flick of his wand.
“I don’t know.” An uneasy quiet fell between the two. “We should meet up with the others.”
"I'm pretty sure we'll have a potions store to rival the Hospital Wing in a few weeks." Blaise added, joining the small group, pulling Ginny into a hug from behind and dropping a kiss on her cheek.
It was only the beginning of October and already Harry was more than a little fed up with his two best friends. They were currently tailing him as he made his way to the library in an attempt to find a quiet place to work on his homework, without disappearing entirely. He never could understand why he explained to them how the Map worked, if he ever wanted time alone he would have to take it and the cloak with him, making sure to place multiple anti-tracking jinxes on himself and anti-summoning jinxes on both the map and the cloak. He would have considered going through such lengths today, but he couldn't seem to shake them for even a minute.
“The magical historian retired, virtually becoming a hermit, on the outskirts of an old, Irish village called Adare. It was once a wizarding village, but in recent years is has become more overgrown with muggles. It is believed that Burch has heavily wardered his home and it can only be found by powerful wizards seeking knowledge of dark magic.” Hermione read to the group as they were all gathered around her, back at the large table in the library.
"No, not now Albus, we have to discuss something very important." While Albus seemed a little put out at her attitude, Severus couldn't help but snort at the easy relationship between the two. He never knew anyone who could brush the old wizard aside so easily as Minerva always did.
"Good morning gorgeous." Harry chuckled running his fingers through the silky blond hair.
"Is she going to be okay?"
“Not bad, it could have been worse.” Ginny grinned, jumping down and walking into Blaise’s open arms.
“Hermione, could you and Blaise work on that for us?” Harry looked between the two, the strongest charms casters as both nodded. “Alright while that is being done, Draco, Pansy, and I will talk over the plan. We are going to need to find a place to store the horcrux while we find something we can use to destroy it. I think we should create another small room in the basement and make it heavily fortified. I don’t think the storeroom is a good idea because we will need to stock is soon.”
"Good or bad, we need them." Hermione simply nodded, knowing that the conversation would have to wait. There were too many things that needed to be done that night and Severus and Pansy would just have to try and integrate into the group just as fast as Draco and Blaise did.
"There's always the morning." Harry laughed, spelling the candles out. "Night, Draco."
The room emptied quickly. Bellatrix made a little scene about not being allowed to stay, but the three men remaining paid her little mind and so she left completely ignored. Her wails did horribly upset Narcissa, however, who Severus could now clearly see. The shadow of a woman lay crying and clinging to herself. Voldemort shot a quick hex at her, effectively silencing her. Severus schooled his features to keep from flinching, Lucius, however, didn't even seem to notice. That alone made the potions master sick. "Now, tell me news of the traitor and the Potter brat. I heard that you had to haul the Greengrass girl and Nott off for attacking them."

It was the beginning of November and there was an infectious energy running around Hogwarts. The next day was the first Saturday of the month which meant that the first quidditch match of the season was just around the corner. The match was set between Slytherin and Gryffindor which meant that the rival houses were even more rowdy than usual. Harry had been working his team harder than ever and not matter how much they complained, there was no denying that they were in the best shape they could be in to win the match.
"Sorry, Master.
"Dumbledore no longer cares for our safety, when he was confronted on the matter he accused us of hiding something important from him. We are under the impression that he believes that we are planning something or that we have some inside information on Voldemort." Hermione picked up for Ginny. She knew that while many of the fellow Order members might be skeptical about believing Dumbledore's actions, many would believe if they heard it from her since she had always been an advocate of the old wizard.
"Does she really get that involved?" This time Blaise was genuinely interested. Snape had always been keen on his house beating Gryffindor solely because off house rivalry, but he had never been active in the appointment of Quidditch team members. The idea of McGonnagal being so attentive was both humorous and a bit disconcerting.
"Why would he do that though? Wouldn't you want to make an example of that student so others would learn not to follow in their lead?"
“True, but until we get all of the hard spells done with the actual framework, I think it’s safer for everyone to be there, just in case.”
"It's just
"Good morning? It's just past noon!" Hermione cried exasperated, spelling clothes out of the dresser and onto his bed. "Get up and get dressed. We have a busy day ahead of us!"
"He's expecting you Mr. Potter." Kingsley's secretary smiled genuinely at Harry as he walked through the empty waiting room. "He cleared his morning for you."
But that brought up another problem. There was no way that Harry was going to be secret keeper. Of course he would have to at first, he would be the one to erect the spells, but after he would move the power over to someone else. Unlike his parents and Sirius, however, he would make sure that the other person could be trusted implicitly. The thought of Sirius made his heart clench and Harry realized that it had been a very long time since he had thought about his Godfather. With his life being as crazy as it was, trying to protect Draco and Ginny while maintaining high grades, running not one, but two underground operations, and training with the quidditch team, Harry had been so busy in the last two and a half months that the man hardly crossed his mind. Instantly Harry felt guilt wash over him, he barely noticed that he had come to the door of his and Draco's dorm until Godric clearing his throat caught his attention.
“No,” Dumbledore paused long enough to make Harry worry before continuing. “I’m not sure what defenses might be in the cave. I will be filled with dark magic. I want you to understand this before you agree to go.”
"I don't know, I want to talk to him, I want to believe that there is something that can be done, but really Harry I think we both know that Ron has been pushing me a lot recently. All we ever do is fight. I can't raise a family with someone who is going to teach their children to blindly hate." Hermione's voice broke at this point and Draco could tell that she was crying. He’d never cared for the Gryffindor know-it-all in the past, but even he could hear how much Ron’s betrayal hurt her. He knew that Harry would never expect him to be friends with all of his own friends, but Draco couldn’t help but feel like this girl would become just as important to him as she was to Harry.
“I know.” Narcissa’s voice wavered and it was obvious that she was still in pain.
When Draco awoke, the sun was beginning to set. Cursing, he realized that the day had already come and gone and he still hadn't gotten his things. He was about to reprimand Harry for making good on his suggestion of spending all day in bed, though he did have to admit that he thoroughly enjoyed it, but he found the other side of the bed empty. Curious as to where his lover had managed to run off to, Draco dressed in a day robe and a plain set of pajama shorts before he went about the house looking for his elusive lover.
"Oh, sorry." Harry said watching the boy carefully, still seeming to be thinking something over. His tone was passive, but there was a small line of concern wrinkling his brow.
"Are you alright dear?" All traces of the fierce woman who had just been staring down the powerful old wizard disappeared. Blaise attempted to disentangle himself from the girl to allow her mother to get closer, but the woman just nudged him right back to where he was. "It's good to see Ginny being cared for, don't bother moving Dearie."

"And you didn't want to help." George beamed at his twin, nudging him for good measure.
"The wellbeing of all the students is my concern." McGonnagal clipped back and Snape unhanded the boy.
"Good, also I want to have a word with you in the kitchens when you're done." Draco nodded as a way of dismissing him. It was so easy to fall back into his old ways with someone so linked to his childhood before him.
"Okay," Luna nodded as she watched the incredible feat of magic that Harry was displaying. "Well then what are we going to be doing about not having a house? That seems like a pretty big problem." The frank way in which she asked her question made Harry laugh as he finished up the preparation spells.
"She's something else, huh?" Harry laughed when Blaise still seemed to be at a loss for words.
"Ron if you only came by my home to yell at me I would suggest you leave." Harry sighed as he did his best to will his headache away. Why did Hermione insist on freeing his house elves? He could really use a calming draught, for himself of course, Ron would just be receiving a swift hex.
"You are both very similar, I know." Blaise said, understanding that there were things about Draco that he would never relate to. As much as he didn’t like that Potter was the one who was there for him, he was at least happy that Draco had someone to talk to who could empathize with him.
“But how do you know that we can achieve that? I might be powerful enough and you might be too, but to combine our magic like that is dangerous, especially where we have never attempted something like this before.”
“We knew that we wouldn’t get any answers from our professors, so we thought we’d come to the expert.” Blaise spoke up, infusing his tone with equal parts disgust at their supposed professors and reverence for Artikus. As expected, the old wizard lapped up the attention like a kitten in front of a milk bowl.
“Why don’t you ask him?” The voice of Godric made all three of them jump. “He’s waiting for you in your room. Would you like me to tell him you’re on your way up?”
“Right, and we’re fairly certain that the Ravenclaw item is the lost diadem, thank’s to Luna’s research.” Dean added.
he didn’t bother to inspect it for too long. The old wizard had made the bed he was now forced to lie in and there wasn’t much that Harry could or should do to change his fate. It was what he had to believe because the alternative meant putting his own life and possibly those of his friend’s on the line to save a madman. It was bad enough they were all risking their lives to stop Voldemort, there was only so much that they could be expected to do.
“I know it’s not the time now, but how did the meeting go?” There was a certain anxiety in his eyes that made Harry pause and consider his next words carefully.
“Horcruxes, or more specifically how many one can make,” Harry spoke for the first time since they had entered the man’s home. Artikus’ milky gaze suddenly turned quite sharp and he looked at Harry as if it was the first time he noticed him.
"As cute as this is, shouldn't we be heading inside, we wouldn't want to bump into anyone
"Are you alright, love?" Draco asked, taking a seat next to his boyfriend, taking the glass from his hand.
When they made it fully into the common room it was obvious that everyone had scattered since Draco had left them earlier that morning. Hermione was reading by the fire, Ron asleep in her lap taking over the rest of the couch. He assumed that Blaise and Ginny where in the boy's room, Luna, Neville, Seamus, and Dean where nowhere in sight. Hermione looked up as soon as they entered the room completely, her eyes trained on the person behind Harry that she would not quite see.
"I'm sure we will finish it soon, I could always find magical creatures in the woods to help us too." The girl said with an indulgent smile and Harry had to hold back a snort. He didn't think she would understand a Snow White reference even if he was tactless enough to make one and he just nodded in return. "Come on, we're at the gate, we should find a quiet place to disapparate from."
"I forgive you, but that doesn't make me any less aggravated." Draco started slowly and Harry pulled back to watch him curiously. "I can't believe your relatives would do that you, I understand the not having someone to rely on your whole life, but that's really no excuse."
“Arrogance, most likely. If I am right, then there are only four more to find and destroy.”
A knock at the door eventually pulled them from their moment of solitude. Narcissa had managed to eat and drink all of her food without feeling sick and Draco had started to fill her in on some of the broader details of his life after aligning with the Light, including his relationship with Harry, though he avoided mentions of shared patronus’ and soulmates.
Across the Great Hall a lone female Slytherin watched the Gryffindor table, her eyes narrowing at every time Ginny leaned on or touched Draco.
"I'm not sure how Godric would feel about that, but it would be worth it to see his reaction." Harry smirked, leaning on the door frame.
“No.” Sirius was smiling and the warmth fully reached his eyes. It nearly made Harry cry to see his godfather so at peace.
"That's genius! But how do you know it's him?" Hermione asked, peering over his shoulder.
"I'm not saying that it is easy, but it's not impossible." Hermione protested and Ron simply rolled his eyes.

"Good. Be gone with you, I wish to speak to Severus alone." The room cleared out quickly and soon Snape found himself alone in the room with Voldemort and the shell of the woman he considered to be his closest friend. Voldemort moved to a set of armchairs, not even glancing at the cage as he motioned for Snape to join him. "Severus, despite what you might think, my trust in you has not wavered."
“You’re welcome, Professor,” he snarked back, his eyes meeting the man in a clear challenge. He hadn’t meant it, not truly, but the mounting stress of the past week was catching up to him and Harry found that he was quite happily looking for a fight. At least then he would have an excuse to burn off some of the restless energy that had been building in him.
Vipera agreed, seemingly more interested in him now.
“I had company, there was nothing to fear.” Harry smiled to show that he was alright.
“I think it might be time we learn how to be an animagus,” Pansy suggested as she followed the two, Draco and Blaise not far behind. “If we could have transformed and hid out between jumps, we might have been able to shake them and also get a better look at our attackers from a distance.

"I was going to, but then I stopped because the nargles were harassing a first year and I thought I should help him." The girl said in her usual dreamy manner and Harry couldn't help but laugh. With all of the events of the past year, Luna had become a regular fixture in Harry's life to the point where her odd comments seemed normal and even Hermione was able to indulge the girl without going mad. If you looked past most of the fantasy talk, Luna was actually very brilliant and her research on horcruxes had turned up invaluable information that even Hermione could not argue with.
!" Draco shot the spell just past Ginny, not intending to actually disarm her. Instead he watched with triumph when she tripped over her own feet to avoid the spell and landed flat on her back.
"I miss this when we go on holiday." Harry said to Hermione and the girl nodded in agreement.
The hall to the potions cavern had remained open and the wizard made quick work of navigating the dimly lit path until he found Dumbledore leaning against one of the open chests just as he'd left him.
“Honestly, making an old man stand by an open door while a storm rages on, do children have manners any longer?” The muttering might have meant to be quiet, but it was perfectly audible in the otherwise empty and silent sitting room.
Harry followed Draco up to his room, not quite sure what was in store for him, but he was more than willing to see it through. While he had used the washroom connected to Draco’s room before, he had always entered through the door in the hallway, never wanting to invade Draco’s privacy and snoop through his bedroom. He was surprised when he walked into the room, he had been expecting Draco's room to look like the Gryffindor dorms, but then again this was meant to be for the Head of House so it shouldn't have surprised him to see that they were actually quite homey and well decorated. A king sized four poster sat in the middle of the room and was covered in black silk sheets. The wall was the made of the same grey stone, but large tapestries hung over most of the room in the traditional Slytherin colors. Harry raised his brow at that, but Draco merely shrugged and smirked. There was a door to the right which stood open revealing a very large walk in closet. When Harry saw that he couldn't help but snort. The rest of the room was pretty standard and Harry found his eyes returning to the large four poster where Draco was lying back leisurely, shirt completely unbuttoned. Harry's mouth went dry at the sight.
“Yeah. That sounds cool. For now, do you want to read me a story?” Harry liked the thought that his two best friends in life and he and the love of his life might share something together, but for now he just wanted to keep Draco to himself.
“We’re all going to have to help out researching this to figure it out, do you think Dumbledore will give you any more information?” Hermione asked as she finished scanning the last page.
Harry quickly got ready, knowing that if he took too long Hermione would have more choice words with him. When he hurriedly opened the door expecting to see his persistent friend, however, Hermione was no where to be seen. Since Harry was staying in Sirius' old room and he knew that the only other room on the floor, Regulus' old room, was currently boarded up until he was ready to go through the room and fix it up however he saw fit, Harry knew that Hermione couldn't be on the top floor anymore. Before Harry had too long to ponder her whereabouts, however, his attention was drawn to the wafting smell of coffee and pancakes that was making its way up from the ground floor. Hermione forgotten, Harry made his way to the kitchen, wondering who could have possibly cooked, knowing that the house elves wouldn't have made food with Hermione coming over. The last time they had tried to cook for the brunette she tried to free them. That fiasco did not end well and when she proceeded to refuse to eat their cooking all of the elves became even more offended. All of the elves minus Dobby were scarce around the house when Hermione,
"I hid something from you agin. The dream I just had wasn't really a dream."
“Well that much does make sense,” Dumbledore responded after a healthy pause.
"Okay I'm going to set a timer for fifteen minutes. I want Katie and Draco to try and score as many goals as they can, leaving at least a few seconds in between for your keeper to reset. Seamus and Dean will keep score, one on either end. Is that clear?" Harry's voice rang clear through the pitch and six voices sounded the affirmative. "Alright. Begin!"
"Are you okay? You know they don't bite." Harry said smiling slightly, trying to hide his obvious concern.

“Alright, since you seem to be the expert on him, where can we find him?” Harry laughed at his friend’s exuberance. It wasn’t often that he knew more than everyone else in the room and he seemed to really be enjoying it.
"If they can't keep up then they don't deserve to be here." Harry replied through gritted teeth. He was on edge and everyone could tell that something was bothering him, though no one dared asked what.
“You are spending far too much time with Ron.” Harry’s disembodied voice laughed before he came into view again. “So I’m guessing this is not normal magical artifact.”
“Oh yes, my boy. You must be tired. I think it’s best if I tell Harry that I need to speak with him. I fear his trust in you could still use some work.” The look he received told him that Dumbledore very seriously doubted his own words, but Severus knew better than to push his luck.
"Well I'll see you both around seven." Draco’s eyes met Harry’s and a kind smile passed between the two before Draco left the room.
“Would that really be wise? It seems easy to stumble upon.” Harry asked, skeptical that someone so powerful would be so obvious.
"I've been better." Draco shrugged, his indifferent mask returning. Since he had allied himself with Harry the two had built a tentative friendship, though in public they acted civilly and left it at that.
"Finally, we're getting to the good stuff. I want your information, all your information on these
There was no time to consider the note. It was obvious that their mission had been pointless and the boy wished he had a moment to feel sorry for himself, but he knew better. With a sigh, Harry shoved the parchment into his pocket and he slipped the locket over his head and under his robes. There would be time later to wallow in self-pity.
"Maybe we're all growing up a little." Luna said in her signature dreamy voice and the others just nodded, all too wrapped up in their own thoughts to comment. Across the room, Harry and Draco were none the wiser.
Ginny waited for Draco to walk down the hall and out the front door before her scrutinizing gaze fell on Harry. Knowing that an interrogation was more than likely in his immediate future, he chose to ignore the pointed looks and went about making himself busy to avoid the start of a conversation he knew he couldn't escape.
"I do, I know that everyone else is skeptical and I understand why, but I've known her since we were children and know I can trust her." Draco reasoned, looking up at Harry as if to plead his case.
"I'll let you unpack your things." Harry said after the moment passed. He could tell that a lot was running through Draco's mind and he made to leave to give him space.
"I think that they should be proud of their house, I know we are of ours." Ginny laughed, sticking up for the two. "Anyways, there is something simply irresistible about a bad boy." This time she leaned on Draco's arm, pretending to flirt with him by over exaggerating her batting eyes.
“Sev’rus,” Narcissa whimpered by his side. She moved toward him, wrapping her arms around him before effectively burrowing herself into his embrace.
"Someone's a little eager." Harry joked, though he was glad that she had brought it up. While he obviously would have preferred to talk to Draco first, Ginny was an excellent listener. She always had the best advise, sort of how Harry always envisioned what his mum might have been like.
The room was dead silent as they watched the two circle each other. The duel had been going on for over a half hour and while it seemed that it was no where near ending, Harry could tell that both Draco and Ginny where getting tired. They were breathing heavily, though they trained themselves to not only quiet each intake of air, but also every step they took. They were closely watching the other to gauge how tired the other was. It was only a matter of time before the match came to a close.
Since that night the two seemed to be avoiding each other. Harry didn't know why, but he just knew that Draco needed space. Ginny assured him that everything would work out and that Harry being understanding enough to give the blond space was a good sign. According to her it meant he knew the man better. Harry couldn’t help, but doubt that. He felt like he hardly knew himself, much less knowing anything about how Draco's mind worked. He knew that he couldn't let things go on the way they had though. Having explosive wet dreams was one thing, Harry could handle that seeing as he had been a teenager not that many years ago, but the tension in his own home, no Harry would not stand for it.
The made their way into the bar with little issue. Not a single soul noticed when the door slipped open and there was seemingly no one there to have done it as they were all rather drunk and were apparently celebrating if the cheers and maniacal laughter was anything to go by. Harry only let himself worry what a bunch of death eaters might have to be happy over for a second before returning his focus to the task at hand.
“Things were different then.”
When Harry entered Draco and Blaise's common room he was instantly bombarded by questions. Along with Draco and Ginny, Blaise, Hermione and the rest of the sixth year Gryffindor boys sat waiting for him. It took a few minutes to get everyone to stop talking over each other and when Harry was able to get a seat on the armrest of Draco's chair, he told them what was going on. As he expected everyone was outraged at Dumbledore's response and many almost doubted what Harry told him. He had to reassure Hermione a few times that he had in fact been there and that yes, he was sure it was Dumbledore that he had spoken to. Harry had been convinced for a while now that the man was not of a fit state of mind to run the school, though he had kept those thoughts to himself. Not however, he wasn't the only one questioning the old man and his motives.
“I think those where extenuating circumstances.”
With a little scrambling and even more confusion, the two groups managed to split off and begin lessons at half past ten. Ginny and Luna were organizing the shield practice with Colin Creevey. They had split the other students into smaller groups, making sure to put at least one older student in with the rest. Even if they didn't know how to preform a proper shield spell they were still more apt to be able to control the more immature and eager kids. They did their best jumping between the groups and counted themselves lucky that the cushions were not needed as much as would have been assumed.
"I made a decision. I wont go tonight until you talk to them. It's not fair for them." Draco spoke firmly, letting Harry know that there was no room for argument. At first Harry was mad, though they hadn't been friends in the past, ever since he changed sides, Draco had pretty easily gone along with what Harry had to say. But Draco was right, he was being really unfair. "You can talk here, I told Blaise to go somewhere else for a bit and I can leave too if it helps. I know it will be more private than your common room."
“That’s the wizarding world!” Ron said cheerily as only someone who lived their whole life in the world could. “Well then I’m going to go track down my lovely girlfriend and see if we can’t find out where we’re going next.”
put them back on. He then took up the quill with a shaking hand and began to write. More tears formed at the corner of his eyes as he wrote and Draco silently cast a spell to insure that the falling tears would not smudge the letter. They sat together for almost and hour, Harry doing his best to write without breaking down again while Draco sat behind him, gently massaging the boy's back and shoulders, avoiding reading the obviously personal letter. When Harry was done he set down the quill and fell back into Draco's waiting arms. He sighed, the tears finally dried, allowing Draco to place gentle kisses on his temple and cheeks.
“So you’re not really here?” Harry sat fully and Sirius moved to pull him into a tight embrace. Tears that Harry hadn’t even realized were threatening to spill steadily made their escape and splashed over their intertwined limbs.
“Well done Harry,” Dumbledore said serenely. He sounded quite pleased.
“Harry I am old, there is no way I am putting your life at risk when mine is already near over. I have made many mistakes in my life and allowing you to die over my ego is not one that I can make. I have lived too long making sacrifices for the greater good, now it’s time I make a sacrifice for the right reasons.”
Harry chuckled softy before doing a quick cleaning charm on the both of them. They were both too warm to use the covers and so he felt content leaving laying on top of them. Draco rolled into his side and He wrapped him close.
Harry was thinking along the same lines as his Professor. While he did his best to scan the room for anyone paying a little too much attention to them, Blaise worked silently on their potion. Draco was sitting in front of them, working with Neville. They where hoping that if they switched up the normal partners, it would garner a reaction from their attacker. Nott was in the class, and his eyes kept darting toward them every so often, the sneer on his face was chilling, but Harry wasn't afraid of him. Like Snape, he was sure that there was someone else working with the boy, Nott had never struck him as smart enough to pull off a scheme like this and Harry was quickly coming to the conclusion that whom ever it was, they were not with them in the potions class. Abandoning the search, Harry returned his focus to helping Blaise with their potion.
"My Lord if I may." One of the death eaters from the ring standing around him started to speak, but Voldemort instantly hit him with a cruciatus curse. He ended it just as soon as it started however and he loomed over the man with a sneer set on his face.

It struck Harry as odd that this was the first time he could ever remember seeing the blond smile a genuine smile. He admitted to himself that he rather liked it and felt special that Draco seemed to really only feel comfortable enough to be himself around Harry. He would never say it out loud, but deep down Harry knew that he would have no issues with sharing his home with Draco, on the contrary he could see himself rather enjoying it. With a smile of his own in place, Harry left the kitchen in search of his two, most likely arguing, friends to start the tedious task of listening to Hermione bark orders at them. The day didn't seem as bad has he had thought it would be though and Harry was actually rather looking forward to it. Letting Malfoy into his home was obviously the start of something different, something interesting, and the forever curious side of Harry was just dying to find out what else was in store.
"And what makes you think that I'm going to believe you just because you say so?" Blaise countered, his eyes narrowed as he waited for Harry to slip up and say something that might be incriminating.
"Hogwarts let me apparate in earlier tonight, I hope that even with Dumbledore's death the wards will remain adjusted and I can move freely in and out of the castle. It is not ideal, but it will do."
Harry couldn't help but smile to himself as he started out of his room and down the stairs. The wafting smell of dinner hit him when he left his room and he was extremely curious as to what had inspired Draco to cook for him once again. When Harry pushed the door to the kitchen open it took all of his self-control not to gasp. The kitchen was completely spotless, much unlike the mess that Harry normally left it in when he actually cooked for himself. The normal long table and benches had been shrunk down into a much smaller, more intimately sized and the benches were transfigured into chairs. There were candles lit in the center of the table and two places set to perfection. A bottle of Ogden's finest was open in an ice bucket in the center.
"What not for?" The question left Draco's mouth before he even realized that he'd meant it.
Harry would rather be anywhere than on his way to see Dumbledore late Monday night. He would rather be in bed with Draco or around the fire with his friends, he would rather be standing over a cauldron while Snape barked orders than walking into the unfamiliar territory of his former Headmaster’s rooms. He had the papers from Professor Williams and the window of time he had left to speak to the man before he was taken from the castle was closing. He knew it was more then likely that Snape would need to kill Dumbledore before he actually left the castle and as much as he hated the man the thought that this could be one of the last times he saw him left him feeling numb.
"It might seem that way to you. Gryffindors are about rash action and standing up for what you think is right. While these can be good qualities, and don't look so surprised that I am willing to admit that, we are adults now, aren't we?" Draco rolled his eyes at Harry's playful shocked expression, "well as I was saying, good qualities at times, for instance in the heat of war you can just run with the moment, but we Slytherins feel really out of place, we are much more used to planning our actions and committing them in a way that we get what we need. But in a time of peace it is better to be calm and be able to keep yourself and your actions in line. Also in the case of politicians, it would be much better to have the ability to stop and carefully plan out a course of action first."
“I know you have more magic than you are letting on. If you stop pretending for once and use all of the magic I know you have at your disposal we will have enough strength between the two of us to break this barrier spell.”
The cave was silent except for his heavy breathing. Dumbledore moved from his side to stand in front of him, blocking his line of vision to the rest of his surroundings. “Harry, my boy.”
Ron is such a prick in this story, sorry to anyone who likes his character! I don't always write Ron bashing, but sometimes I can't help myself!

If Severus had been a lesser man he might have gasped or even protested; he would have opened his mouth in shock and maybe even gaped. He was not a lesser man however. He might have been a half-blood, but had grown up in the company of purebloods who had such high standards it put the children of the current generation to shame. No, Severus was not such a man and so he sat in silence. He was sure that if he waited out the old wizard then there would come an explication, or maybe he’d find that he’d heard him wrong. He stared at the old wizard and Dumbledore stared back. Minutes passed and it seemed that he was going to be getting no such explication.
"Well it's good to see you happy and out for a cause again." Kingsley laughed, knowing that whatever Harry wasn't telling him was because he himself hadn't figure it out for himself yet. "I'm sure you have plans for the rest of the day and I have a meeting soon, but come by again, don't be a stranger." Kingsley stood and pulled Harry into another warm hug.
“No promises there, mate,” Ron joked from his girlfriend’s side. Hermione rolled her eyes and gently shoved him, much to Harry and Draco’s delight.
"I thought that this was about me and some supposed secret you think I'm keeping." Harry's voice was low and challenging. His eyes where darker than anyone, but Draco had seen them before. Those closest to him flinched at the small shocks they where feeling from the raw magic rolling off of the volatile boy.
"Draco, son, do as Harry says." Hearing his godfather speak jolted the boy from his trance and he sprang toward the ladder without another complaint.
“I did.” Severus knew that Harry had been blocking out the visions since the battle at the Ministry in the spring. He was surprised and worried that they were returning.
"Honestly? We're going to have to wait for them to make their move. I will confirm with Sev in the morning that he spoke to Pans." Draco said looking more than a little upset, but they knew that he was right. There was nothing that they could do but wait for something more to happen.
Knowing better than to let Ron get to him, however, Harry put the letter out of his mind in favor of setting out for his day. He was hoping to get to the Ministry before the Minister was too busy to see him. He and Kingsley went back as far as Harry's first encounter with the Order and if anyone could call off the idiot aurors at Draco's, it would be Kingsley. A part of Harry really didn't want the blond to leave, but he knew that Draco must really miss home and the comforts of knowing that all of his things were
"And I share you with Ginny, it's only fair." Draco shot back and allowed Pansy to keep his arm around his waist, sticking his tongue out at his boyfriend.

Closing his eyes, Harry imagined the walls that he had built to keep his magic in and slowly let the first one crumble. The air in the room started to get chilly and the fire that Harry had started was instantly put out by a sudden and unnatural gust of wind. When Harry was sure it was safe, he began to break down the second wall. This time he heard both Blaise and Ginny gasp as he was sure the pale glow of his magic became apparent and danced around him like a protective bubble. That would have to do, this had been the amount that he'd show Draco a month ago and while he had a better handle on it, he wasn't going to push his luck. Harry quickly rebuilt his walls so that he was no longer glowing and reset the fire with a flick of his wand.
It didn’t take long for them to locate Hermione or for her to retrieve her copy of a History of Magic from her nightstand, something that Ron teased her for until she smacked him on the head with it, and for her to find the passage on Artikus Burch.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well doesn't someone look like Christmas came early." The playful voice of Ginny Weasley brought Harry out of his trance-like state as he stared straight into the eyes of one of his best friends. She was talking in the lobby of the ministry, most likely have just finished meeting with her dad or even Neville.
"No one should give you any problems, but if they do don't hesitate to reprimand them." Harry nodded to Severus as he watched the rest of the room come together with relative ease. "Just make sure not to take house points, as it would be hard to explain the reason."
“Ah, that is a shame.” The sparkle that was always there disappeared for just a moment before returning to his old eyes. “Well straight to business. I hope he did not give you any trouble,” Dumbledore spoke over his tea cup. He was making it very clear that this meeting would be happening at the pace that he set. Harry wasn’t looking forward to spending the rest of his night playing games, but he would relent if it meant getting information that was vital to them winning the war.
for us now? Can't even talk to us yourself?" Ron demanded, and Harry's jaw set as he prepared himself for the longest talk of his young life.
The rest of the night was spent completing the plans and creating shifts for when the house had come far enough that it was safe for them to go in smaller groups. It was late when they were through and it was agreed upon that another DA meeting would need to take place soon. With Dumbledore leaving soon the safety of Hogwarts was coming into question and Harry wanted to make sure that everyone he cared for was looked after.
"How is that possible?" Hermione asked fascinated, which again did not surprise Snape in the slightest.
"Of course Master Malfoy." With a loud pop Kreacher went to do Draco's bidding as the Slytherin retrieved the book he had been reading in the library and went to the kitchens to wait for him. Harry was surprised when Kreacher appeared in the master bedroom not long after he had sent Draco down to the kitchens. The grumpy house elf left him his food, a tray of grilled cheese and tomato soup with his favorite mug filled with butter beer.
"Anything to keep you guys safe." Harry shrugged off Draco's awe and set about making tea. Under any other circumstance Draco was more than sure that Harry’s ability to use so much magic would be a total turn on, but it was not the time or place.
"Did you find them?" If Harry was bothered that his friends had divulged his secrets he didn't show it.
"I think Professor Snape has it handled. Is Luna going to be okay?" Harry asked as the witch continued to fuss over the blonde.
There was a passageway before them that he was not entirely sure had been there before, but as it was the only direction they could go, Harry saw no reason not to pass through it. Dumbledore moved to his side and they walked through it together. Almost predictably the doorway shut as soon as they had found themselves fully in a second room. It looked much like the last room in that it was small, surrounded by jagged rocks and drafty. Unlike the last room it was not entirely empty and there stood a large wooden crate before them with no design or particularly distinct features. The box sat perfectly still and otherwise completely unobtrusive. Harry was instantly suspicious of it.
“We will have to go tonight. There is no time to waste.” The old wizard sat before him, not bothering to touch the food which was easily too much for just Harry. He might have been curious about this if he wasn’t confused by the old man’s statement.
“Hey!” Harry called out to get both men’s attention. He needed the bogart to turn back into his own fear to cast the spell to dispel it. He had been shocked at seeing Draco’s hurt face which had kept him from instantly ridding themselves of the annoying obstacle, but he was ready now.
"You never needed to." Draco sighed happily as he felt Harry's hands massage through his hair. "Do you think that you can just have my things brought here? I'm not sure I want to risk running into any of the aurors who raided my apartment."
"Of course it is, he's Malfoy!" Ron cried and while Hermione threw him a look it didn't stop her from looking back to Harry for an answer.
"You are correct, on both accounts, Severus. That is all for tonight, Severus please stay behind."
"Of course, that is no matter. They were hardly of any use anymore." Voldemort said while waving Severus off. Lucius began to seethe at the words, but the other two ignored him. "But what of Potter? How is it going trying to get in his favor?"
"So what your saying is that we have to find all of these things and kill them?" Ginny asked to recap and looked rather crestfallen when Snape simply nodded.
"Of course, My Lord." Snape stood first and bowed low.
"Impressive." Blaise smirked approvingly.
"That is understandable," Draco spoke for the first time since the tower. "Everyone quickly gather everything you can. Hermione will tuck it all into her bag and then we leave the castle."
"Changing the topic?" Harry responded with a question of his own, his hand going into his pocket to retrieve the note that Pansy slipped there. He kept his eyes on the girl, holding the parchment in front her vision. "Tell me about this, what was so important that you risked being seen in broad daylight?"
“It’ll be another two weeks at least, despite her best efforts even my dear wife can’t break through the location spells and you know determined she is to flay her sister alive. I think if she laid off the bottle she would have Narcissa’s precise whereabouts located faster, but I’m certainly not stupid enough to try and pry the bottleneck from her hands.”
"I love you so much." Draco sighed, wrapping his arms around Harry not letting him move.
Harry nodded and closed his eyes. He could feel the magic even though he couldn’t see anything worth mentioning. Of course the entire cave structure hummed with dark magic, but there was a higher concentration of it in this room, more so than in the first room and certainly more so than the weak amount of magic it had taken to house the bogart. It seemed that the strongest point of the magical signature was manifesting in the center of the room stretching from one unremarkable wall to the opposite one.
Harry awoke with a start. Sweat dripped down his face; his body shaking. He knew that if he moved he would feel the sticky mess in his sheets. Why is it that only Draco can make me feel like a randy teenager all over again? Sighing, Harry replayed the dream in his mind again. He had been having a lot of dreams like that since the almost kiss two days ago.
"Well they must vote him out, this has gotten out of hand." Ginny reasoned.
"There's firewhisky on the table if you want it, it sounds like you might." Draco Malfoy offered casually, looking over his shoulder to see who had walked in, turning back to the stove to flip another pancake.
"I think it was very brave, and dare I say Gryffindor, of you both to come here tonight. I just want you to know that I appreciate that and I am willing to start fresh." Blaise and Draco scoffed at her comparison of their actions to the house of lions, but they both shook her hand. The breath that everyone seemed to be holding was let out and the tension that existed between the two Slytherins and rest of the students began to subside.
"Move where?" Blaise had known that Draco had gone to Potter for help, the whole school knew that much, but he hadn't yet witnessed how the two acted in private. It struck him as odd how easily they seemed to talk as if they were more than just acquaintances and had not been rivals for the past five years.
"See? He's just trying to protect them!" Nott jumped in.
“You good?” Draco whispered with his face buried in Harry’s neck. He placed feather light kisses on the exposed skin and Harry sighed happily, closing his eyes to enjoy the sensation.
"That can be arraigned." Draco laughed, his hands moving further down to work his lower back, his fingers dipping into the pronounced devil's horns that Draco loved. "Tell me, what do you want me to do? I'm at your command."
But this was Malfoy, someone who knew and had seen the horrors that Harry had seen. He didn't like the public eye and as far as Harry could tell he had no desire to put himself back into the public eye again, for any reason good or bad. And this Malfoy, or Draco because this kinder person that was staying in his home was too good to be thought of as Malfoy, was so intriguing. Not that Harry was looking for a lover to make his life more complicated, but Harry did enjoy solving puzzles and that was exactly what Draco seemed to present himself as to Harry. But wait, Harry was jumping too far ahead of himself now.
"Let me finish. I understand that speaking to me about things is going to take time, I know you're not intentionally shutting me out, but you have to understand how I feel. Just next time slow down and remember that I want to hear what you have to say, I want to be a part of the planning process. I know you won't change over night, I expect you to mess up again, but I need to see an effort to change."
"Well that was until I told my parents that I was gay and
"Oh please, Draco and Harry are far worse." Ginny rolled her eyes in means of defense. Across the room, the pair in question were holding a hushed, private conversation and it didn't escape anyone's notice how Harry's hand was slowly running circles on Draco's lower back.
"I thought you'd never ask." Harry smiled, raising his arms to pull Draco down on him.
"Harry are you sure this is a good idea?" Hermione shouted over the low roar of the crowd of students waiting for the meeting to start. Her gaze shifted toward Severus and Pansy who stood off to the side with Luna, Blaise, and Ginny, the former two looking decidedly uncomfortable.
While Draco was beaming and taking in all the positive attention, he failed to notice that Harry was watching him carefully as if he had just been handed a particularly difficult puzzle that he just wasn't sure how to go about solving. When the noise level died down and everyone went back to their own practicing, the smile returned to Harry's face, though their was a sparkle to his eyes that hadn't been there minutes before.
“It’s not just that,
"I don’t think so, prat.” Draco laughed, quickly sobering up, “no I want to go get my things." Draco sighed, pulling away from Harry to stretch. "Once I get fully moved in I'll let you try to convince me to stay in bed all day again." Draco winked his good mood coming back as quickly as it had gone. He laughed as Harry gave him his best pout face. "You know that won't work. Now are you going to join me in the shower or are you going to let me go all by my lonesome?"
"Listen to him, it's like we haven't done a thing." Seamus complained in good nature and Dean shoved him gently rolling his eyes.
"You really do have low standards."
VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE READ FIRST! Okay now that I have your attention, if you have not reread the story to refresh yourself up until this point, I would suggest it. I went through and edited each chapter and in some cases I changed details, mostly minor, but it might be smart to reread anyway. I know that I have a terrible track record when it comes to updating this story, I want to do better but I'm not making promises because I clearly can't keep them, so I'm going to stop lying to you guys and to myself. As of right now, I have the just under half of chapter 31 written and I intend to finishing that by the end of this week. I will try my best not to be a terrible author to you guys again, I'm sorry if I fail you. That being said, thank you all for sticking with me for this long, I hope not to keep you waiting too much longer for the rest of this story.
"It was Pansy." Harry said confirming everyone's thoughts. "Doesn't this seem really suspicious? She just happens to be waiting for someone to go back to our rooms and warns us that something is about to happen? We made sure that only those in the locker room at the time find out about it, we hid it from even our own friends and now she just comes out of no where and warns us? It just seems too coincidental."
“Typical pureblood idiocy. She won’t want to appear weak, I’m surprised she even allowed you to see her like that.”
"Harry we just want you to tell us what's going on." Hermione tried to plead again, hoping that Ron wouldn’t suddenly jump in as he always did and ruin things.
There was no apology, no admittance of any wrongdoing; Harry wasn’t surprised, though how little it bothered him was a bit of a shock. “Is the barrier or whatever it is still up?”
"Well I'm not sure where to start, but I suppose I should start with Malfoy." Harry ignored the look that Ron gave him. He knew that skipping the occurrences of the summer, and how he came into his magic after Sirius' death, wasn’t smart. He knew they would be mad when they found out, but he was still weary to let anyone know. Again, Draco seemed to always be the exception.
"And that's fine, picking her isn't the problem. You just didn't include Draco in any of this. Can't you understand how he might feel about that?” Hermione tired to reason, when it was obvious that Pansy’s more blunt approach wasn’t working.
“Wow, Potter, I didn’t think you had that in you. That was some creative wording.” Pansy whistled, looking impressed and a bit scared.
"There is something up with that boy." Severus spoke slowly when he was sure that Harry had left.
"I think I'll stay too." Harry said, standing to see the rest of them out. Before Ron left, however, he pulled Harry aside.
Lord Voldemort was less than pleased. He had called a meeting of only his closest followers, though it did not escape his notice that Severus Snape was not among them.
The pair had apparated several times to conceal any possible magical trace before coming to stand across the way from a dingy looking pub. They were both invisible, more than just disillusioned as it was a spell of Severus’ own design and would make it so no one could see them unless very powerful, very dark magic had been cast to find them. It wasn’t fool proof, but they also had the advantage of no one thinking to look for them in the middle of a notoriously dark magic accepting village.
"I am already looking after the brat." Snape rolled his eyes, but secretly he was very relieved to have an inside man looking after the aging wizard. He might distrust the man and disagree with his current actions, but that didn’t erase their shared history and the fact that Snape was worried about him. "How much longer until Albus graces me with his presence?" It was a snide remark, but he figured he could get away with it.
"You're not fooling me, you know, I know you're planning something with that traitorous son of mine." The spittle flying from Lucius' mouth was enough to make Severus flinch back in utter distaste.
The potions master had very little warning before he was suddenly met with an armful of his godson, who clearly had no qualms with showing affection in front of his friends. It might have been his relief in seeing the boy safe for the first time in over a month, or it could have been the lack of sleep, put Severus found himself holding onto the blond just as tight.
"Well, yes, you can't be hot-headed and try to run a government, though you would make a good figurehead, Potter."
"How are we going to get out?" Dean asked and the others looked at each other with worried eyes.
"I didn't mean to wake you." Harry responded gently, moving to be closer to him again.
"That would put them in even more danger!" Ron protested, but Ginny and Draco only nodded gravely.
"I don't know. You might be on to something." Harry summoned a quill and an inkwell, dipping the tip and writing his name neatly at the top of the scrap. They all waited with bated breath, but when nothing happened the four sighed in frustration.
"What's the matter, my boy?" The kind wizard asked, concern etched on his face.
“Oh?” Draco smiled, his interest piqued. He knew that whatever Harry was talking about would have to do with the
"Are we interrupting something?" Blaise asked with a cheeky grin. Draco stood beside him by the entrance to their common room with a small smile on his own lips.
“Very true, how do you plan on doing that?”
"Theo has told me that Snape and the Headmaster have seemed at odds, but he did tell me something far more troubling. He told me that Snape here seems to be taking a great interest in the traitor Malfoy and Potter even." Nott sneered and Snape held back the urge to roll his eyes.
"You Gryffindors and your fairness." Blaise scoffed, though he smiled in spite of himself.
Harry sat alone, stunned. He had been so close to finally kissing those lips that seemed to be taunting him all night. His attraction to Draco might seem sudden to anyone who didn't know him well, but he had always known on some level that he didn't hate the boy. Was he moving too fast for how little time they'd been on civil terms? The sensible part of him screamed yes, but the part that knew himself, that knew Draco and how the two worked together was insisting that forging ahead was the best way to treat this situation. Ginny's words early had calmed him into thinking that it was possible that Draco was attracted to him, but the man's reaction to his attempted kiss made him think otherwise.
That was when Draco noticed the sound of water coming from the bathroom that was connected to Harry's room. While part of him really wasn't sure if going into Harry's private bathroom was a good idea, a stronger part (the part that really hopped that Harry was fine and that he would be able to catch a glimpse of him naked) overruled whatever sense he had left in him and opened the door. The sight that greeted Draco made his mouth go dry.
"You can do wandless and wordless magic?" Pansy asked and Harry realized that he had a lot to update her and Snape on.
“What is it that you want to know about?”
." Draco moaned at the sound, cuddling closer to Harry, burying his face in his shoulder.
“The cave requires those who enter to provide a sacrifice that might weaken them and make them more vulnerable. I paid with my blood to gain us entrance, but it took your blood to bring back our senses.” Dumbledore spoke as if he had just been praising Harry on answering a simple question. How he could act this way while putting Harry and himself in a very real, very dangerous situation was beyond the young wizard. The tight hold that he had on his anger was beginning to slide and Harry began to doubt if he would be able to survive the night without killing off the old man himself.
“Do you see any other options? We are stuck in this room with now way out. I can feel the anti-apparition charms in these walls and I know you can feel them too. Would you like to die trying to get out of this place or would you like to take the long way to death’s door?”
”I asked you all to stay because I wanted to address a few matters that I think are very important and are currently being overlooked. First I want to say that the regular rules of the DA still apply. You are absolutely banned from repeating anything that you learn from this meeting and that includes to other DA members. At the end of this meeting I will be asking you to sign another agreement, except this time it will keep you from talking about this meeting entirely, we as a whole cannot afford to be turned on again. I want to make this perfectly clear so if anyone here does not feel comfortable making that commitment then you should leave now. If you want I or Hermione can remove this memory from you so you don't accidentally tell anyone that there is a group within the DA." Harry waited to see if anyone would stand up and leave, but when no one did, he signed in relief.
Now that his hand was free, Harry moved even further down Draco's body, his hands ghosting over the spots where he left particularly dark marks on Draco's pale skin. When he made it to Draco's impressive erection, Harry made sure to hover right over it long enough to make Draco buck up to try to get Harry to touch him. When he was sure that Draco would die if he wasn't touched, Harry's hands moved to his hips to keep them still as his mouth descended on his cock. The strangled cry that left Draco's lips made Harry moan, the vibration only making Draco react more. Harry's talented tongue worked up and down the shaft as his hands roamed up and down his sides, allowing Draco's hips to move, fucking Harry's mouth in earnest. Harry could tell by the noises that he was making that Draco wasn't going to last long. He had half the mind to slow down, torture the boy more, but all such thoughts were pushed away when he felt Draco's hands run through his hair. Stunned, Harry looked up through hooded eyes to see Draco doing his best to smirk down at him, though the clouded look of lust across his face masked it. The thought of Draco being powerful enough to escape his confines made Harry quicken his pace. Draco clawed at his back, screaming Harry's name as he came hard into the boy's mouth. The overload of feeling Draco's magic and his sperm shooting down his throat made Harry cum without even being touched. Draco drowsily crawled down to Harry, kissing his back and face as the boy road out his orgasm. After, the two collapsed together in the middle of the bed, Harry pulling Draco close, getting the boy sticky with his own release.
"Are you paying me a compliment?" In retrospect, Harry could see why antagonizing the man in front of him might not be a smart idea, but in the moment he couldn't help but question him. This was not normal Snape behavior.
Draco, unsurprisingly to the group as a whole, had mastered the art first and found his animagus to also be a panther. Hermione had been a close second and she was able to shift in and out of the form of an eagle, much to Harry and Ron’s delight as they knew how much she feared flying. It would be useful for her to be able to fly out of most dangerous situations and the core had already promised not to use her form as a glorified owl. Pansy was next and she added Siamese cat to their little menagerie and Luna rounded out the group as an arctic fox.
The mood in the room lightened and the four continued with their meal. At one point Draco could have swore that Harry's hand brushed his leg under the table, but the touch had been light and had gone just as soon as he had noticed it. I'm thinking too much into this.
"Honestly Mate, it's like I don't know you anymore." Ron shook his head, while Hermione looked rather impressed.
“No she went back early after Hogsmeade.” Blaise supplied from across the table. “Where did you come from anyway? Isn’t it still a bit dangerous for you to be walking about alone?”
news about Potter and his foolish friends. Care to tell me what you know?”
"Just lovely, continue to have your nice little breakfast and continue to ignore me, fine I will be waiting in the sitting room when you come to your senses." Ron stormed out of the room and down the hall, stomping all the way until they heard the door to the sitting room open and slam.
"How was that?" Harry grinned as he pulled himself up the bed to lie next to Draco, his arms instantly encircling the still trembling blond.
“Okay, don’t strain yourself, it wouldn’t hurt anyone if we have to keep the locket out for a short period of time.” Draco reached out to squeeze her hand. “Just make sure the house is still standing when we get back.”
“I’m not exactly sure,” Harry said, sheepishly. “I saw a picture of this forest in a muggle mag.”
"I know, but I'm not sure you could understand like he can. I can't explain it-"
"I think it's best we call this meeting, Blaise could you go with them to the Tower for a bit? I think they're going to need some time."
"Sorry Gin." Harry smiled sheepishly. "Now, to deal with these two." All three pairs of eyes moved to focus on the bound Slytherins sitting in heaps on the floor. Nott was still bleeding, but it looked like the spell Harry has cast on him acted as a pressure because he wasn't bleeding quite as much. Before any of them were able to voice their opinion on what should be done with them, a very confused Professor Williams' arrived on the scene.
“That’s incredible Nev, and a lot to do on your own. I’d love to help, if you need any.” Draco offered.
Apologies came from throughout the common room and Harry smiled in spite of himself. “It’s alright. I’m not intentionally keeping information form you, I just don’t want to repeat myself is all.”
Pansy looked between the two, not quite understanding, but choosing to keep quiet. The group had filled her in on a lot since she had joined them, but she hadn’t actually been witness to any of the incidents with the old wizard and she found it hard to believe the once strong and commanding Headmaster had really fallen so far, but she knew better than to question their information. They had yet to give her a reason to doubt them and she watched the pair as they seemed to hold a silent conversation.
"Would he really though? He's never put his neck out for us before." Seamus asked, bitterness obvious in his voice.
"Why are you trusting me?" Pansy asked, her stance no longer relaxed, but guarded.
"I know, but I'm afraid-" Harry trailed off, but Hermione knew what he was trying to say. While Harry had never directly told her or Ron about the horrible treatment he received at the Dursley's, Ron had told her about the bars on his window and the small things that he noticed on the night he and the twins rescued him.
now is it?" Severus watched him with a calculating stare, but Draco wasn't about to break under his gaze.
"I'm fine, I took the shortcuts to get down here so I figured I wouldn't see anyone along the way. I came down to make sure that you are okay. You had Harry and I worried." Draco smiled at the man that he considered his father genuinely and Snape knew that he could no longer be annoyed with the boy.
At the front of the formal dining room, Voldemort swung his arms wide, blowing the doors open with a powerful burst of magic was that meant to show the range of his force and instill fear in his subjects. It worked, if Severus was to judge by the way the two Death Eaters who were still in full regalia fell to their knees. They were so consumed by the show that neither noticed as he finally made it to Narcissa’s side.
"Merlin, you were killing us over that?" Katie fell back to allow them some privacy, though she did relay the message to the others as to why they were currently pushing themselves to the max during their first practice of the season.
As Harry made his way to meet up with Draco he almost wished he was still talking to Snape. It was easier to get mad and act irrationally, so much easier than having to explain himself and his actions. He knew that he had been shutting everyone out, but especially after Sirius' death he didn't want anyone to get too close to him. He didn't want more blood on his hands. Draco seemed to understand, however, and whenever he tried to push the blond away, the boy just got closer to him. His strong, silent demeanor always seemed to fall apart when it came to the blond, something that Harry refused to over analyze.
“Let’s eat first, Draco, and then we’ll see how your mother feels.” Severus answered when it was obvious that Narcissa herself was struggling with her words. The two Slytherin men left and Neville crossed the room and sat on the bed facing the blonde.
“The former headmaster requests your presence tonight. I’m sure you’d consider that adequate detention,” Severus drawled, but the concern in his eyes told Harry that it was Severus before him and not Professor Snape.
"I suppose my opinion is a bit biased, this was my fifth time facing him if you count the first time when I was a baby, but it was. That's why we're training you all here. I hope that no one has to fight, I don't want more bloodshed because of this stupid war, but I want more than anything to make sure that you're all at least capable of protecting yourself."
The heat in the room was steadily climbing and Draco knew just the trick to drive Harry wild. It was near impossible to do magic around the boy without him picking up on it, but luckily Harry was so worked up that he didn't notice the small bucket of ice that Draco conjured sitting on the nightstand, nor did he notice when Draco took a piece and put it in his mouth.
"At least in private, you may call me Severus." Snape extended the formality with a thin pull in his lips, though the smile in his eye showed Harry that he didn't quite mean the pained expression painted on his face.
"Potter, I thought I warned you to be careful." Harry felt the girl start to pull away, but he was too fast. His hand closed around her thin wrist before she could move away. Swiftly, he turned on his heal so he was facing the girl and pushed her into the nearby alcove, making sure that no one saw them.
“You’re not upset about that?” Harry wouldn’t have let himself admit it, but had always been worried that had Sirius lived, he would have disproved of Draco and their relationship.
"We could always use that to our advantage." Snape said plainly and his admission to being on Harry's side surprised the boy.

"That all depends-" Harry trailed off, looking to his blond lover doing his best not to leer.
“Soon, I need to make sure that all of the things we want to look at are converted to one vault, that way we don’t have to move between the two. The least amount of time we spend out in the open the better. I trust the goblins not to gossip about the dealings of wizards, but any passing wizard who might see us might not be so kind.”
"Good." Draco smiled back, snuggling deeper into the hug, reaching out to pull Hermione into the hug as well. He was never one for touching, intimacy had never been part of his childhood, but being with Harry and seeing just how much Hermione was going through he found it easy to hug the girl that only a day ago he’d barely known.
“What does Dumbledore think they are again?”
“Filthy halfbreed, where have you taken Kreacher?”
Draco found Harry in his room hours later. The sun was setting and the light played on the man's skin making it seem even more golden than normal. How suiting. Draco thought to himself, smiling when Harry looked up from his book to meet his eyes.
"It's touching that you would think so, Harry, but it is true. There are many things I must tell you before this time comes, however, and many things, I'm afraid, that I cannot."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I think I would prefer to be with Harry and Draco if that is okay."
“That is a good question.”
"Don't go thanking me just yet, I still want to know why you are out of your room so late." Instantly the boy's facade dropped and his face hardened in a glare. "I see." McGonnagal watched the boy closely, starting to realize that maybe Snape hadn't been out of line to corner the boy, he was certainly up to something. She wasn't blind to the way Slytherins operated. "Severus, meet me up in the Headmaster's office, I will make sure Mr. Nott gets to his rooms."
"I know you have all been training hard for this and I have the utmost faith in all of you, but don't let that go to your head. We will only win if we earn it so I want to see all of you go out there and play your hardest!" The rest of the the team let out a cheer and they broke apart just in time for Harry to be called onto the field. He walked forward with confidence to meet the referee in the middle and shook Urquhart's hand. His team walked out behind him and they all took to their air, awaiting the signal.
The room vacated quickly. Ron, Seamus, and Dean left first, as they had no idea how to react to their most hated potions professor sobbing like a child. Luna and Hermione were not far behind, promising to help Harry clean up later, throwing worried looks back at the man on their way out. Blaise and Ginny hung back long enough to say goodbye, asking that Harry let them know when they could come back. Pansy lingered for just a moment longer, looking as if she wanted to stay, but thought better of it. By the time everyone was gone, Draco had moved with Severus to the couch. Even Sal and Godric went back to the hallway and Harry stood near the door, unsure if he should stay.
“It’s just me, love. I’ve gone and gotten Hermione, but Sev isn’t in the castle.” The door clicked and opened slowly, something Draco assumed Harry had done with just a pinch of the large amount of magic he had at his command.
Harry within himself, not in a sexual way, but in a way that was so much more intimate, so much more
"I hope it wasn't too presumptuous of me to open one of your wines. I thought a nice dinner would be well paired with an exquisite wine." Draco looked calm, but Harry thought he saw the anxiety in his ice-blue eyes.
“Yes, much too much time with Ron.” Harry commented in an attempted severe tone, but the smile on his face gave him away.
“That might not be such a bad idea. We’re going to need that in a few days too, I set up with the goblins to have Draco and I go to the vaults to pick out the furniture that we’re taking. I was going to just sort it and then go back when we were done with the house, but if we can manage it all in one run that seems much easier.”
The snake to the right hissed, bobbing its head toward Harry in mild interest.
"Shut it, Zabini." Ron grumbled. "At least I'm doing my work."
With a smirk trademark of any good Slytherin, Draco moved down ever so slowly, savoring the way Harry's eyes rolled back in his head in anticipation. He blew on the head teasingly and Harry let out a strangled sob. It was clear that it was taking all of his self control not to force the blond to take him in his mouth. If Draco hadn't been so turned on himself, he would have been impressed and even touched at the lengths in which Harry would respect him and trust him. Feeling bad for his lover, Draco opened his mouth, lowering his lips to the head of Harry's cock, sucking the drop of pre-cum off before moving down the rest of the shaft, experimentally swirling his tongue along the way. Harry's hand instantly found its way into Draco's hair and Draco began to pump up and down, moaning at the sinful noises that he and Harry where making. The vibration from Draco's moans only proved to drive Harry even crazier and he knew that he wouldn't last much longer. Even though he knew that Draco had never done this before, he found it very hard to believe. Whatever the blond lacked in skill, he made up for in enthusiasm and the absolutely dirty noises that his mouth was making was enough to drive Harry to the edge. Draco, knowing that Harry was close, redoubled his efforts, wrapping his hand around his shaft and pumping in time with is mouth, his free hand moving up to tweak Harry's nipple. The extra sensations where enough to push Harry to the edge and with a muffled cry, Harry came harder than he had in his whole life, screaming Draco's name. Draco did his best to drink up all of Harry's juices, but a little dribbled down his chin and when crawled up to his side, Harry kissed him firmly on the lips and licked his chin clean.
." The girl got right in his face this time. She might have been much shorter, but she made up for it in her attitude. "I told you to insure that he knew that he was in trouble with The Dark Lord, not to go and make him suspicious of you. If you're going to be useful then you're going to need to listen to me."
"Severus, my boy, you don't give him enough credit, he's not just James' son." The familiar twinkle was still in the man's eyes, but there was something in the way he looked at Snape that made it clear to the man that Dumbledore was far from joking.
“Alright! Alright! I nicked the thing. It’s a dark, evil thing. I don’t know what you boys want with it, but it’s gone. I sold it!”
"So it's your daughter. Astoria, am I correct? Yes she must be the brains behind the attacks." Snape sneered at Nott, his eyes glinting in a taunting way that left the other man seething.
"What aren't you telling me?" Dumbledore tried again and this time Harry pretended to wince, as if he was trying to fight off the potion, though his friends knew better. "What aren't you telling me!" The old man yelled this time and Harry flinched back for effect before whispering his response through gritted teeth.
"Master Malfoy, what a pleasure." Kreacher spoke in a voice that sent a chill down Draco's spine. He could tell that the house elf was much happier now than how he had been during the war. It seemed that Harry really did treat all of his elves well. Even still there was something very unsettling about the elf.
"Yeah, sorry. What do you need?" Draco asked, proud that at least this time he kept the blush from rising up his collar and onto his pale cheeks. Maybe his eyes were playing tricks on him, but Harry seemed disappointed.
“Well I was thinking that between the Potter vaults and the Black vaults there has to be a good amount of furniture and other artifacts there that could be of use.”
!" Pansy shot back and Hermione had to dive out of the way, the power of the spell just skimming past her. The smirk on the Slytherin's face was enough to fuel Hermione to jump up quickly into a defensive stance.
"And how did Mr. Nott come by this information?" The older wizard seemed to be unfazed by the news.
"Yes I once read that it was possible for a person's patronus to also emulate their parents."
"Wonderful, Miss Granger. Five points to Gryffindor. Now I don't expect all of you to be able to produce a full patronus right away, but I want to get you started on the theory behind it. I understand that this is a hard spell to master because it takes more than just your magical ability, you truly have to think of the most happy memory you have and channel that energy into the spell. This type of magic tends to be harder for younger witches and wizards because you must be in control of not just your magic, but also your emotions. Today we're going to go into more of the theory behind it as well as techniques you can use to help you. When we meet again next week, we will move onto the practical portion of the lesson. That will give you plenty of time to research and practice over the weekend."
“Well there must be a way to break it down without hurting ourselves. We could try to shield ourselves and then cast the spells,” Harry thought out loud, though he knew it wasn’t the best idea. It was better than standing around waiting for something to happen.
"That's really evil magic, Mr. Potter, but that's all I know. What were you doing reading something like that? You have no business looking into something that dark. What are they leaving around for the kids to read in this school-" The more he talked, the faster he spoke. He was getting rather red in the face and Harry was sure he was rivaling Uncle Vernon with the lovely shade of purple he was becoming.

"That is all for today, don't forget your essays are due by Friday." It was the last class of the day and Harry sat back, taking his time to pack his things. The rest of his friends gave him meaningful looks, before filing out as quickly as could be seen as natural. The room was empty in no time and Harry was left to scoop up the rest of his things and conveniently exchange them for the magazine he had stuffed at the bottom.
So Snape began to explain them what horcruxes were exactly and how to make them. He even told them all of Dumbledore's theories as well as the fact that in order for them to obtain more information Harry would have to go and talk to the man himself and convince the old wizard that he forgave him for his actions against Ginny. When he was done everyone in the room looked just as uneasy as he felt and for that he felt a little bad, he didn't want to scare his students. They where children and much too young to have to go through this, but they had each other and now they had him to help. He knew that he wouldn't be able to protect them all, but he would do his best.
"I know who the second person is. I came to warn you." Harry watched the girl carefully, coming to a decision quickly.
"Good." Voldemort hissed, petting Nagini's head in what most resembled affection, though Severus knew the evil man could never comprehend such an emotion. "Are the rumors true? Is old Albus being forced to step down as Headmaster?"
“Alright let’s tell the others and reach out to them.” Draco lead the way out of the room and back toward the main house.
"I don't know, but a part of me hopes so." Harry smiled finally admitting out loud that he did want something more out of this, even if he was being vague. It was the closest that Harry could come to admitting his feelings to himself and the older man knew better than to push it.
Harry was leaning against the back of his shower, eyes closed, hand wrapped firmly around his cock. He was moaning and panting and Draco could do nothing but stare. He was so wrapped up in watching that he almost didn't hear the words falling from Harry's mouth.
“You are here, with me, but you are also back in that cave with Dumbledore. Think of it as a bit of out of body experience.”
"What's wrong, love?" Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, pulling the boy's head down onto his shoulder. "And don't tell me nothing, because I simply won't believe you."
Severus thought it highly unlikely that Draco or Harry would believe that and if they didn’t believe then neither would their band of student fighters. “You will be cast from the school in less than a week.”

Before Draco could get his bearings, Harry and the rest of the group at the table had stood and gone down to talk with their friends. Blaise stood beside him, watching his best mate carefully. It wasn't until Harry had returned, looking rather concerned at Draco that the blond was pulled from his thoughts
"I'm so glad that they have each other." Godric said, a small, sad smile gracing his lips. He and Salazar had stayed with the two through the whole time. He turned to his lover, pulling the man into his arms. Harry's pain had hit both of them just as it had Draco and the somber mood remained in the room despite the two leaving.
"I can't show you here, I haven't practiced enough with it to feel safe letting all my walls down, but I can show you a small part. You're just going to have to use your imagination for the rest." Harry disentangled himself from Ginny and stood, making sure that there was a small bubble of space around him before he continued.
“I don’t like this.” Hermione spoke up again.
"We will be." Severus stood and came around the desk to pull his godson into a hug. He might not be a particularly affectionate man, but he loved the boy in his arms more than anything in the world and he would rather die than see him hurt.
"I know, and I owe you guys an explanation. This is just hard for me to talk about and rather than having to explain myself a million times over and have people skewing the story I'd rather tell everyone at once. It's purely selfish of me, I know." The self-defamation had the desired effect and Hermione's eyes instantly softened.
"I had always wondered how you communicated, it's rather ingenious." Snape said, holding the fake coin to the candlelight to further observe it.
category in his mind for later inspection and let his arms drop by his side. He didn't miss the disappointed look that fell on Draco's face before speaking again. "Well I'm headed off to bed, I have things to tend to at Diagon Alley early tomorrow so I shouldn't be around when you're up. I'll be back later on, though. Feel free to help yourself to anything in the house. You can also owl me if you need anything."

The room was silent for a long moment while Bill thought over his answer carefully. It was obvious that he wanted to ask Harry more questions, but he knew better, the boy would not budge. While he continued to mull over his options, Harry's face stayed blank, conveying nothing about his own feelings on the situation. Internally, the boy was more than a little worried that Bill would outright refuse them, but a bigger part of him was more concerned for the safety of his friends. It was that thought which made him hold it together.
"There will never be a more perfect time, Severus. I am weak and I fear nothing could heal me now. Stick to the plan, end my suffering and then call Riddle, he will send death eaters to confirm before they try to hunt down Harry and the others. You must not let them find you." The last comment was directed to the boy himself.
This chapter was edited and reposted on 3/24/2020. As always, all mistakes are mine. This story is not BETA'd.
"Thank you." Draco stood, trying to act nonchalant at first, but his gratitude overwhelmed him and he smiled, which only deepened the blush on Harry's face.
"Watch it, love, I can still get out of this bonds if I wanted to." Harry grinned and Draco kissed him in response.
"I will do everything I can, I'm so sorry." Harry began to plead again and Draco nodded.
“I want to prep you on what to say first,” Pansy nodded toward Harry. “It would be better if we are a united force when speaking to him.”
"Of course." Draco smiled, finishing with the last fold, making the tail bend down. He stood with the origami crane in hand, his other hand extended to help Harry up. He laced his fingers in Harry's gently pulling the boy with him and out of the dorm.
“That’s absurd.” Pansy laughed at how outrageous the whole thing sounded.
Water welled in Harry’s eyes as he squinted against the assault of mother nature. He did his best to turn his head to block out the wind just in time to see Dumbledore cut his own hand, smearing the blood over the rocks in what seemed to be a nondescript motion. The rocks began to part like the bricks at Diagon Alley and Harry gratefully ran into the opening to escape the vicious wind. He took little notice of the cavern around him as he turned to watch Dumbledore walk in at a much slower rate. There was very little light as the stones settled back into place and before long they were plunged into darkness.
"I agree, though I don't see why this is coming up now, I don't think that anyone who's been previously cleared should have to succumb to more background checks. You know this is out of Kingsley's hands, though. This is more about the Wizengamot. You know those old wizards and witches can't let go of their ways." Harry reasoned, looking over to Draco, noticing that he seemed uncomfortable with the subject topic. Oh right, he once was one of the wizards that I would have prosecuted without another thought.
home, but he would have to catalogue that conversation for another time. “That’s a very good point. So, what are you ideas?”
There wasn’t much more that he could learn from the man and it was actually getting late. He was already past curfew and he was tired. Also, Draco and the others would be waiting for him and he didn’t want to cause them to worry since he had been with Dumbledore for so long.
"Well I don't mean to keep you guys too long tonight, so I just want to go over a few quick things. First of all, most of you know this, but Severus and Pansy don't." And so Harry began to fill the two newest members on his animagus ability. As he predicted, he had to prove himself and so he turned into the black panther, prancing about the room with ease, much to everyone's amusement. When he turned back, he brought up the idea of helping other junior Order members to become illegal animagus as well.
"Let go of me, Potter, I'm not going to run." The girl bit back, her eyes boring into Harry's. When the boy let go of her, she relaxed against the wall, eyeing the boy carefully. "You really care about him, don't you?"
"Thank you Godric." Blaise spoke first, smiling at the man which surprised the two lions beside him.
“Well if the passage is to be believed it should only be the strongest of us who could trick detective magic into thinking that they desired the knowledge of dark magic enough to get through the barriers.” Dean reasoned.
“It’ll be any day now, the Dark Lord is just waiting for the spell to be perfect.” One of the Lestrange brother’s spoke and Harry stopped in his departure to listen in. He could tell from the slight shimmer of magic where he knew Severus to be that he was still doing the deadly dance of getting close enough to Bellatrix without getting caught.
(See the end of the chapter for
" Harry hissed again and Draco grinned. After enough time spent with Harry he was able to understand a few words in the serpent language. Bondage was not new to their foreplay, but Harry had never voiced wanting to be tied up himself.
Harry wanted to scream in the old man’s face, but he restrained himself. This was obviously a waste of his time, but losing his cool now would just prolong the amount of time he was forced to spend away from his love and his friends. “How do you suggest we find the rest of the horcruxes?”
“That much was obvious.”
“We have a potions lab, but haven’t had the chance to stock any ingredients, but I’m sure we can find a way to make that work.” Draco nodded. “I’m glad to hear she’s better, though.”
"Think of how Draco made you talk to Ron and I in the beginning of the year. You didn't mean to shut us out, but we still felt hurt by it. You just need to talk to him, explain your feelings. He might not forgive you right away, but maybe it's time you open up to him a bit. I know that you're a very private person and Ron and I respect that because we're your friends, but Draco is your boyfriend, you partner, that type of intimacy requires a little more candidness than friendship." Hermione tried to reason, hoping that her words would have a more positive affect on the boy since she knew him better. The word intimacy seemed to strike the thought in the boy, however because he looked as if he was about to argue back.
"Alright once Draco's group finishes their drills we can move on to three on three games. Until then I want everyone to repeat the drills if necessary." Harry's voice rang clear through the air and it made Draco's breath hitch. Had Harry's voice always been that powerful? How had it never had this affect on him before?
Harry and Luna departed from their carriage and moved off and away from the main village and toward the shrieking shack where they would have more privacy. The air was thick with magic and Harry could nearly taste it. It wouldn't be hard to disapparate from the outskirts without getting caught. It was less condensed with magic there and he would have no issue taking Luna side along. When they were far enough out that they were sure that no one was following them, Harry pulled Luna to his side with his arm securely around her before disapparating to their new headquarters.
"Well then since I'm sure you couldn't possibly have any ulterior motives-" Harry began to recount the last two days with Draco, about their first meeting in that very kitchen, the confrontation, the redecorating, the dare he call it romantic dinner, and then the meeting with Kingsley. By the end of the story and their meal Ginny's smile was nearly splitting her face and forcing Harry to smile in return.
"Is this how you handle your followers?" Blaise nearly sneered and Draco jabbed him in the side
Draco blushed at the words and Narcissa graced Harry with the first full smile he had ever seen from the woman, it was breathtaking. There didn’t seem like there was anything else to be said and he and Neville took their leave shortly after promising to send lunch up to them when it was ready. Harry hadn’t known that he had been seeking the approval of Draco’s mother, but he could not deny what it meant to him to have it.
"I think Pansy's right, you're going to need to do more private research first and maybe even find evidence that he has some experience working in his great-grandfather's field." Draco backed the girl up looking glum.
“Okay, well I had an idea this morning, but I figured I’d ask you first since I’ll need your help.”
“There is no gain in telling him. No he will have to learn to grow up and accept the loses of war.”
Harry stepped aside and Draco moved up, so Pansy was standing in between them, but still behind them enough for protection. Ron had woken up by this point and he was regarding the newest Slytherin oddly, though he seemed to still be half asleep and had yet to say anything. Blaise and Ginny where coming down the stairs just at that moment as well and they stopped midway, also staring at the girl, not sure what to make of her sudden appearance. Another few tense moments passed before Hermione cleared her throat, ending the silence.
Harry nodded his understanding, waiting until he saw the small opening to fire off his own mild stinging curse. They watched as the curse hit the wall and then bounced back at their shield. Instead of the shield absorbing the hit like it normally would it bounced back against the wall, this time looking brighter and stronger. This repeated a few times, the bright light of the spell ricocheting until it was soaring back at them so bright that Harry knew his simple stinging curse was going to shatter the shield. He braced himself for the impact and was not surprised when the shield in front of him shattered and he was hit with a full forced stinging curse. He was thrown back a foot due to the impact and he was lucky that he did not hit the rocks behind him at the same speed or he would have been cut up pretty terribly.
Harry stood, thanking the Headmaster for his time and nodded curtly to Snape before taking his leave. He made sure to shoot Snape a smirk in response to his glare out of Dumbledore's sight. When he left the room, he made his way out of the tower immediately, knowing that he would not be able to stick around to eavesdrop as Dumbledore would most likely know he was still there and force him to leave.
and then the name of the person you are looking for and they will receive the message like you would with a patronus, but you don’t have to cast the spell. It’s faster and less draining on your magic.
"I'm sorry?" Snape gaped. He was truly gobsmacked at the news.
"Harry, dear don't be ridiculous!" Molly chided, though she kept her eyes on the old man to gauge his reaction. "That would be against the law!"
"Yes, they all seem to be fine, but what's going on, Severus?"
"No, she said that she had more information, said that she knew who the second person is."
“Want to go for a walk?” Harry wasn’t sure where they would go, it was cold, being mid November, and the castle would be drafty, but Draco could tell that he needed space from the rest of the group, no matter how well-meaning they were.
"Then the Room won't be able to change it back until we fix it." George added gleefully.
Before another fight could break out, the other four entered the common room. All eyes landed on them and in turn the four stared at the stranger sitting at the table. Quickly surveying the situation, Neville and Luna moved right for the kitchen to help Ginny and Hermione, adopting their silent acceptance while Seamus and Dean went to stand awkwardly with Ron, trying to sort out the situation in their heads.
"Are we safe, Sev?" Draco asked and instantly Severus was brought back to when Draco was a child and he would go to him when Lucius was being particularly harsh.
"I will." Harry left the Ministry with a skip in his step, a contagious smile spread across his face.
"How did you know that you could trust us?" Blaise spoke up, which was very rare for the Slytherin.
"Lucius, I would think you wise enough not to speak. You are the reason we called this meeting."
"What did the Headmistress want?" Neville leveled Harry with a knowing gaze, though the smile never left his face as if he already knew the answer to his question.
“Harry then, thank you for taking such good care of my Dragon when I could not.”
Harry moved as silently as he could, doing his best not to be noticed by the bogart. He needed to put an end to this. He was beginning to empathize with the old wizard before him and he couldn’t allow himself to do that. Even if it was selfish, Harry knew that if he could relate to the man and understand him in any way he might find it in himself to forgive him and he just wasn’t ready to do that yet.
"I'm just worried about Sev." Draco sighed, moving into the hall and closing the door behind him. He locked the lab again and activated the normal level of wards. Taking Harry's hand, they began to make their way to their rooms, both boys taking the time to be hyper aware of their surroundings.
"I think that he realizes that many would make a monster of him for his new found power. Being in the public eye has forced him to grow up faster than most children his age and I believe that his sudden ability to act calm in the face of others is his acceptance that he must have a public face to contrast his private one. I'm just afraid that he's hiding from everyone."
“That’s not selfish at all. She’s your mother, of course you would feel that way.” The two had made it up the stairs to the guest room door. “Draco, another thing, It’s unavoidable that you’ll realize that I spent the night with your mother. Nothing untoward happened.” The last part came out hastily, and Severus suddenly felt like a teenager being caught out by his parents. Not that something like that had ever happened to him, there had never been anyone in his teenaged years to be caught out with, but he could assume that is what it felt like.
"Only if the attacks on the group are stopped."
“Yes, you will have to kill me before then. But I will have to kill this horcrux first. There lies the largest problem.”
Since the locker incident, nothing else had happened to Ginny and Snape, try as he might, couldn't kick up any dust on the matter. While they continued to keep close surveillance on both her and Draco, nothing had happened. The incident had almost all been forgotten.
They watched his panther take off at a run. If Dumbledore hadn’t known up to that point that his patronus had changed, he didn’t say. There wasn’t time for that conversation and Harry was thankful.
“Merlin Harry,” Draco whined when he felt the spell. He did his best to move and widen his legs further and Harry nearly dropped him for his struggles. The Gryffindor chuckled before placing the boy on the bed so he could have better access to his body without the fear of hurting him.
"We'll be back one day, Nev." Luna reassured. "This is home for many of us, after all, and we will not abandon our home."
“I was just thinking the same thing.” Draco mused. He moved to the couch and used what little magic he had in reserve to light the fire. The days were getting chilly and the castle always tended to be drafty. Ginny moved to sit with him, her slight body curled into his side. With Harry it might have felt intimate, but with Ginny he knew that the only love they held for each other was familial. “How are things going with the two of you?”
"What do you know?" Snape's voice was fierce and Nott nearly cracked from the pressure, but he kept his composure.
"Don't think you're in this alone, I give as much as I get." Draco whispered in Harry's ear as he stood up, making the motion look natural and unintended. A shiver went down Harry's spine at the loss of contact as Draco pulled away and gathered his things. He knew that flirting with a Slytherin could lead to something like this, but the thought thrilled him. He loved a good game of give and take or cat and mouse, though he wasn't sure who was cat in this situation. He openly watched as Draco walked to the front of the room to talk with Dean and Seamus, his hips swinging with every step.
"Lay on the bed love, let me take care of you." Draco purred in his ear, leading him to the bed. Along the way, he helped him out of his quidditch jersey. He had long since taken off his gear, but he was still dressed in his quidditch slacks. Harry let Draco guide him to lie on his stomach. The blond dug around in the bedside table drawer first before crawling up on the bed and straddling Harry's hips. He made sure to pour a generous amount of the massage oil on Harry's strong back and began to rub the tension out of it. "Everything will be alright, love." Draco whispered, making sure to kiss lines up and down his neck every time he leaned in to work on his shoulders.
"Hello Mr. Potter, on your way up to see the Minister?" The voice from the speaker asked. Harry was pretty sure that not everybody was acknowledged by name, but shrugged the evidence of his celebrity status off and merely nodded. "Well good then, I think he might have been expecting you." Harry laughed aloud then. Knowing Kingsley, he would have suspected that Harry would step in to stand up for Draco.
"Remember, lock and ward. I will come find you tonight my Dragon." With a flare of his cape, Snape was out the door before Draco could protest and the blond erected the wards and locked the room, staring at the cold wooden door scared out of his mind. He made quick work of finishing the potions, though he made sure to make them all properly. The brewing gave him enough time to calm down and when he was finished he stored them away and called for Harry via his patronus. Seeing the majestic panther prance off to get his lover also made Draco feel a bit better and while he waited for the Gryffindor, he penned a short letter to the Headmaster which he sent through the floo.

"Well that's his name, isn't it? I'm not sure what you have against him, but he really is a good person and he has been so nice to me and Blaise. He has done everything he can to made things easier for us and the Gryffindors are actually accepting us for all of his effort. You should be thankful he's protecting me."
“Yes Master Potter,” Kreacher sneered, obviously agreeing to his terms under duress.
"I am relieved to hear this My Lord, I was beginning to worry, you know that I wish to be by your side completely, but I understand why this charade must be kept up."
“Hufflepuff?” Dumbledore asked confused and Harry snorted in response, turning to face the miserable creature to give the man some privacy as he wiped the lingering tears from his eyes.
By the end of his impassioned speech Harry found tears that he hadn’t know were building up in him running freely down his face. Draco, who seemed more prepared for them was already there, wiping them away the best that he could while cradling Harry to his chest.
The rest of the match followed in the same fashion. Ginny scored next, after also allowing the other two in her group time with the quaffle, and Demelza tied it up once again. After, Ginny regained control of the quaffle, though she tossed it to one of the boys in her group. The crowd sat on the edge of their seats as the boy raced through the air, taking his moment to shine as he made a particularly daring shot, making the final goal to end the match.
Steeling his resolve and letting out a breath, Harry took the lead, as he naturally did, and he felt comforted by the weight of Draco’s hand at his back. He knew, from prolonged exposer to their magic, that Pansy and Blaise were right behind, wands hidden, but ready to be drawn.
It was a pregnant question and Draco realized that this boy whom he had been taught to despise all of their school lives seemed to know him better than he knew himself. Would he be able to forgive himself? Would he actually accept the forgiveness that he would have to earn from the Light? A silence fell between them again and this time Draco was left feeling completely lost. Harry Potter had just pulled the metaphorical rug out from underneath him and left him lying there without any way to stand again. It was obvious Draco was in a state of intense thought and he left him alone. He allowed his mind to wonder as he started out at the lake and thought about the next logical moves they would have to make. He wasn’t lying when he had said that it would be easy for him to forgive the boy. Of anyone he understood the most what it felt like to have to live up to the infamy of your parents and their actions. Draco just happen to still have living parents which mean that he would also feel the need to protect them and himself while also following the path that society had built for him. While they were from two completely different backgrounds, Harry felt a connection to the boy that he had never been able to feel with his friends and it was a welcome and unsettling feeling. Deciding that he had done enough deep thought for a lifetime, Harry suddenly stood, startling Draco from his own musings.
"Make lunch for myself and Potter, make his favorite meal and have it sent to the master bedroom and as for me-"
The fog surrounding Malfoy Manor sent a chill down Snape's spine. He resisted the urge to pull his robes closer to his body. It would be seen as a weakness and the last thing that he needed was to add more fuel to the fire. As he made his way from the ornate gates to the large front doors, he had little time to admire the gardens, though he did notice that they did not look as lush as usual.
"What do you mean?" Hermione asked and Harry noticed as all those within the core whom had a significant other in the room reached out to hold them close. Harry felt Draco's own hand slide into his, squeezing him as if to remind him that he was there to support Harry. It was much needed and Harry felt as some of the muscles in his body relaxed just slightly and suddenly it was easier to breath.
"What are you talking about?" He didn't turn around, but it was like he could feel the frown set on Harry's face.
"Took you two long enough, we were going to send a search party!" Ron joked when the two got close enough to hear him over all noise.
They walked in silence for the better part of a half hour until they were all soaked. Draco stuck by Harry’s side while Pansy and Blaise brought up the rear. Even if the roaring winds and rains hadn’t drowned out any possibility of conversation, Harry doubted that there would have been any. The tension between the group was as palpable as the storm. For all of their Slytherin tendencies, Harry recognized just how brave it was for the three people besides him to be trudging into the relative unknown with someone they only just recently became allies with. He was eternally grateful for their support and vowed to remind them of such gratitude as soon as they made it back to the safety of their home.
It was shortly after they rang in the new year that Hermione had discovered that Fiendfyre could destroy a horcrux. It had been decided upon that they would wait until they had a magically secure room that they could safely burn the objects in without burning the rest of the house down to try it out.
"I told you I was fine before, Harry." Luna smiled, the light finally returning to her eyes. "Just a bit shaken up, but I'm fine."
“So I heard, I’m sure we’ll have time to discuss details later.” Severus didn’t even bother to hide the awe in his voice or face as he watched the very clear, easy display of Harry’s magic. It was obvious that in their own home, Harry had no issue with showing the full extent of his power.
"Thank you." Draco smiled again and this time instead of blushing Harry smiled back. "Really, thank you."
Draco watched and his own pace quickened. When Harry finally found his release he wasn't far behind, before he could stop himself he came with Harry's name falling from his lips. Harry's eyes opened before Draco's and he simply stood while the water from his shower fell over his head. When Draco finally opened his eyes to catch Harry’'s he wasn't sure what to expect, he surely wasn't expecting to see Harry smiling.
"In good time, my boy. Don't you worry about things you cannot control. Now I'm sure you are all fine here for now, Poppy see to it that they return to their rooms when visiting hours are over, I will be sure to inform Miss Weasley's parents that she was involved in a flying accident. Oh and congratulations on your win Mr. Potter." Before anyone could respond the old man was out the door. Draco, knowing Harry well enough by this point, was by his lover's side in an instant to hold him back form running after him.
They fell into a happy silence, just enjoying that the other was there and safe. Harry never wanted to take moments like this for granted and he thanked whatever being was out that there that brought Draco to him. Just as he was about to fall sleep, Draco stirred and Harry opened his eyes to watch his lover.
"Luna's right, you know." It was a quiet whisper, but Pansy heard her just fine. Out of all of her new family, Hermione seemed to understand her immense dislike for unnecessary attention and she was glad that both girls beside her were not causing a scene. "I'm glad you reached out to us, we couldn't have done all of this without you either."
as they called her, was around.
“Honestly, I’m not sure, he said it was just a nightmare-”
There was a scream and black and green eyes looked to focus on Draco for a moment before locking on each other again. "You need to take care of them, Harry, I can only buy you so much time."
"Everyone just shut up!" Ginny screamed over the noise effectively silencing the room.
"I know I've just been following your lead all morning, Harry, but what is it you need from me?" Luna asked finally as Harry started to erect a fence around the land that now belonged to him.
It took them almost an hour to make it back to Draco's dorm. Every few minutes one of them would stop the other to push them up against the wall and steal another kiss, or three. When they finally made it to the portrait, Godric was smiling fondly through sleep heavy eyes.
"Of course, Sir." The retort was sarcastic and Harry left, Snape's eyes glaring into his back. He was flanked by the two Slytherins so it was Blaise who noticed Nott first.
the dark magic around that spot, can you not?” Harry looked at her incredulously.
"Fine. Let me change at least." Harry grumbled, rolling out of bed and putting on whatever clothing Hermione had thrown at him.
"Thank you." Harry whispered, reclaiming Draco's lips in a soft kiss. "Thank you."
"Well Ginny stands out, of course, but we knew that." Katie nodded also looking dismal.
"Of course, Professor, how did you know?" Harry smirked back. He knew that Snape was just picking a fight to save face. That and if he gave the man a reason to give him a detention then it would be easier to have a conversation with him without having any unwanted company.
" Draco wasted no time in firing off the first spell. Ginny was ready, however and cast a quick, strong shield spell in response. This caught the boy off guard and she took the advantage by advancing on the boy, pushing him to walk backwards. She sent a quick, strong bat-bogey hex while forcing him to retreat, but Draco deflected it with ease. They continued to dance around each other, sending spells and hexes at each other at such a whirlwind pace that even Harry had a hard time keeping up on occasion.
"I don't want to do this in the shower, not this time." Understanding passed over Harry face and he nearly lunged for the shower door. In a flurry of wandless magic the water was turned off and the boys were completely dry. Harry all, but dragged Draco back into the bedroom, instantly throwing himself on the bed with his legs spread wide.
?” Draco smiled in the small, private way that Harry cherished and it warmed him to know that it was just for him.
“When Voldemort has a particularly strong feeling, Harry can see it in his dreams. The thing is, Voldemort found out and used it against him. He had made him think Sirius was in danger, but it wasn’t real, it was a planted memory. When he came into his power this summer he would have used all of his energy to block out the connection. If it’s open again then that can only mean very bad things.” Ginny explained calmly, eyeing her brother to make sure he wasn’t about to say something else blunt and ruin whatever calm was holding Draco together.
Severus should have felt embarrassed by the tears threatening to spill from his eyes, but instead he was filled with nothing but gratitude and pride. “When did you grow up to be so kind and wise, my Dragon?”
"It's okay, but I hope you don't mind that I'm invading on your conversation." Ginny smiled choosing to ignore Blaise's flustered reaction. She moved down so Harry could sit between them, and leaned on his arm with her head on his shoulder.
"Obviously Draco is a good influence on him." Hermione smiled fondly at the two before turning back to help her hopeless boyfriend. Before anyone could reply, the common room door flew open and an aggravated Snape swooped in.
"Thank you." Draco whispered, his lips grazing over Harry's neck in the process. The Gryffindor sucked in a breath, his heartbeat running faster at the feel of the smooth lips on his skin. Draco, realizing what an effect he was having on the boy, decided to continue to talk with his lips just grazing his neck. "Are you alright Harry? I can feel your heart racing. Maybe you want to call the meeting early? I'm sure they would understand."
