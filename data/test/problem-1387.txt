He’s just a bit...big,” she shrugged, holding her new cat in her arms. Crookshanks was definitely big.
By the last day of Aunt Marge’s visit, Harry had only cursed at her twice under his breath (and way too many times in his head). All things considered, he thought he was doing well.
“We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d gone shopping,” Ron explained as he dug his fork into a waffle. “We knew you’d show up here at some point, so Hermione and I decided to wait for you. We wanted milkshakes before we went shopping anyway—Chloe says it’s a pain to get that monster book thing.”
Marge threw her suitcases at Harry after making a comment about how fast Dudley was growing up. “So, still here, are you?” she asked.
As confirmed by The Ministry of Magic earlier this day, Sirius Black, Azkaban escapee, is still at large.
work for The Ministry. “And they told us when we got there. Hey—is it true about your aunt? Did you really blow her up?”
“So, we’ve dealt with your aunt, you’ll be glad to know,” he said. “She’s back to her usual size, completely normal, and doesn’t remember a thing. But we can’t expend services like this regularly, Harry.” He was talking to Harry as if he was four.
Harry went still. Calmly, slowly, he put the plates back on the table. He took deep breaths, just like his school-appointed therapist from Year 6 had said.
Unemployed, wasn’t he?” she asked. “This is what I’ve been saying about these immigrants everywhere. Waste of space if you ask me—”
When he got upstairs, Harry laid out what he’d brought on the tabletop. He had a few coins in wizard money, a few clothes too short for him (granted, they were better than that fucking dress), a few books, and his birthday presents: The Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had bought him; The Monster Book of Monster’s from Chloe; and Ron’s Pocket Sneakoscope. He’d need a few things for school, but he could easily get them during his stay.
His first thought was, again, to contact one of his friends. The last time he’d been in contact with any of them was on his birthday, and thanks to Uncle Vernon that had been the only time since summer.
Harry picked up a newspaper and idly flicked through the pages. All he usually did with tabloids was find the crosswords, but he’d been out of contact with wizard gossip for so long that he started noticing headlines too.
When Harry neared the queue’s front and decided on a banana split, he noticed a waving duo tucked in the corner of the café.
The past two years at Hogwarts hadn’t been easy for Harry. The usual fame and contempt that followed “The Boy Who Lived” was bad enough, but what that meant for him was even scarier.
“Black is mad,” said The Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge. “And he’s a danger to all that cross him, Magical or no. Our employees are doing everything they can to track Black down, but until then, we advise our citizens to be calm and cautious. He will be recaptured soon.”
Marge was a loud, thunderous woman. Harry nearly felt bad when “How’s my little Dudders?” was squealed and his cousin was trapped in a bone-crushing hug. Being a disappointment had its perks sometimes.
Fudge laughed. “No, Harry, you’re not in trouble. We understand you were provoked, and really, we haven’t got time to worry about mishaps like this in the present climate.”
Asides from the promised library, a new headband and a feathery quill, Hermione had also bought a pet, a very large ginger cat which did a great job at scaring Ron (and his rat, Scabbers), during dinner with the Weasleys.
Harry had clashed with his destiny a time too many, so of course couldn’t help but be concerned when one of Voldemort’s followers had broken free.
After a few days of just walking around Diagon Alley, Harry set off for supplies. Asides from the mandatory ingredients and textbooks, Harry needed (1) A new uniform and (2) An ice-cream sundae (for motivation).
Ron’s letter had said he was in Egypt and wouldn’t be back until the last week, which wasn’t for another three days. Chloe would be in Scotland with her family, and Hermione had last been on holiday in France.
friends now, and Draco was already in tons of trouble with their dad for helping Harry with the Chamber of Secrets last year.
Failing on The Ministry’s part or just bad luck? That is the question circling the Magical Community. Though Black is the first to escape Azkaban, many are asking if it ever was safe. Julie, 27, shares her fears on page 89.
It was nothing Harry hadn’t heard before, but it was getting tiring at this point. Luckily, he was confined to his room for most of his Aunt’s visit, so he only heard some of her hourly rants about how the gay agenda would be the downfall of humanity, or something along those lines.
Fudge nodded. “Now, we’ve decided it’d be for the best if you stayed here for the rest of the holidays to help your family calm down, but you’ll be under close supervision.” he said. “I was just about to ask Tom if he had any space free.”
He stopped as he reached the curb, kicking it helplessly. Fuck it, it was dark, and he should at least be able to see.
This wasn't a new experience, but it will always piss him off to no end when white people just have the audacity to be so casually racist when he was literally brown and
Harry picked up a textbook, flopped on his mattress, and neglected to read it before boring himself to sleep.
“Blimey, do you live under a rock?” Stan shook his head. “He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who back in the day. Killed thirteen people, he did. In broad daylight, ‘n all.”
Harry stretched his lips into what he hoped was a convincing smile. The dress he had been forced into was just as uncomfortable as the way Marge glared at him.
Hermione pointed to herself and Ron with her straw. “Ron and I just got there this afternoon. Even if it’s only a few days, we can actually do stuff together before school! Speaking of, I have to buy a library for all the new classes I’m taking. I hope you don’t mind another round of shopping Harry.”
“You should be thankful. Wouldn’t’ve had Petunia’s kindness myself,” she huffed, staring down at Harry like he’s an accident her dog produced.
She looked at him, then turned back to her brother. “You know, you mustn't blame yourself for the way she’s turned out, Vernon,” she wriggled away from the boy’s plate-reaching hand. “If they’re born with a problem
“Why do you call me that exactly?  Horned serpent, I mean. It’s just… I got told why from someone else but it didn’t make sense so I was wondering if you’d explain it a bit better?”
“Why hello there! How many for the bus? Three? That’ll be one gallon and thirteen sickles then!” The owl man said to Snape in quick succession.
Sure enough, after Dudley trudged into the other room and closed the door he quickly spotted his cousins' fiery form curled up defensively in the small space between the tub and the toilet. Hissing rather valiantly at him, Dudley might add, as he sat down on the cold tile floor and waited for him to calm down.
Harry just nodded beside him since he wasn’t sure if he should say anything else. Was there a truce between them now that they were similar or was Dudley going to deny it and still torture him? Deciding it was better to not ask, he took off his glasses, frames really as they had no lenses, and readied himself to curl up on the floor, debating whether to sleep in his scales when Dudley spoke up once more.
Harry’s eyes widened as he peered at the box in the professor’s hand. It was small, whatever it was but it was also his mother’s so he knew that he would cherish it forever.
“But I don’t want to live the rest of my life as a snake! I mean don’t really enjoy being human but that’s because Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon are mean! They make me talk in English all the time even though they know I hate it!” Harry shouted.
“So I’m… magic? You’re magic? We’re both magic?” Harry asked to confirm the mass confusion in his head.
Harry huffed as he thought about searching for the mouse again until a new noise caught his attention. Chattering that he could only describe as one similar to a chipmunk was speaking animatedly near him. Harry gawked at the scene before him as Dudley seemed to be speaking to an eight inch gremlin with blue skin and a red stripe on its head who was standing on his shoulder and holding onto his neck for support. It had big floppy ears on the sides of its head and two small black horns protruding from the top of its forehead. Its eyes were a deep purple color and it had black sharp nails on each of its hands. Both its hands and feet seemed to have three digits with its feet looking similar to a bird’s. The strangest thing about all of it had to be that both Harry and Dudley seemed to be able to understand the tiny creature.
The old tattered books at his side called to him like an old familiar song when he imagined where they came from and why. He picked up the serpent book first, flicking through it haphazardly and only searching for torn pages. When he didn’t find any he set the book back down and picked up the flowery red one like he was trying to get close to an injured animal. He bit the inside of his cheek as he flicked the book open to quickly find hastily torn pages. He then matched the letters up to the ripped up interior and frowned when they all fit together. What would make her rip only a few of them out? Why didn’t she leave them with the others?
“Yes. We were best friends when we were growing up. She was a maledictus like you but her form was an owl instead of a snake. As far as your questions go Mr. Dursley, I teach Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts and the box is a present for Harry seeing as it is his birthday. I thought he would enjoy something with sentimental value so I decided to give him something of Lily's. As far as what you can call me I suppose you should get used to calling me Professor Snape for the upcoming school year.”
Instead of having normal colored eyes, his were yellow like an owl, with a ring of dark green around them. The Dursley’s told people he wore colored contacts to cover up the abnormality.
“I saved him from a snake in here. He’s trying to find a place to grow plants that doesn’t have a lot of predators but he also wants to stay with me so it’s a bit tricky.”
The goblin bowed slightly and turned to leave when Harry shouted at him to wait. He could hear Aunt Petunia in his head yelling at him to use his inside voice and Vernon yelling that he shouldn’t be talking at all.
A blush formed across Dudley’s cheeks when he realized what he had gotten himself into. He immediately realized Harry never knew about all of the research he had put in to understand snakes better. Even now he often asked for at least one snake book for his birthday or Christmas, not that he ever got them but he still tried. There were two things that they were never allowed to do in the Dursley household: mention anything about magic, and say that snakes of any kind were good.
He debated on what to tell Dudley that wouldn’t be overtly rude, as in: ‘No, we can’t both fit because you’re a giant pig’, since he’s pretty sure the other boy was trying to extend some semblance of peace before the oncoming storm that was Vernon Dursley. So instead he just nodded, shifted into his snake form and allowed Dudley to pick him up to set him on the bed gently. He honestly didn’t know the other boy could be gentle, especially not when it came to him.
He sighed in defeat and went to curl up on the floor as Petunia cleaned the dishes, all the while humming an annoying tune. He knew it was a nervous tick of hers from years of exposure to it and that it often meant bad things were about to happen to him. However, nothing did this time, and the other three residents of the creaky cabin lulled themselves to sleep.
“Honestly Harry, it’s like you’ve never spoken to another magical being before! Didn’t your Oma teach you anything?”
“What?” Hary asked through clenched teeth in English. The language sounded foul on his tongue, like week old moldy vegetables that he only ate because he didn’t have anything else available. He much preferred to speak like the snakes that came into Aunt Petunia’s garden, but he also knew the others frowned upon it. They said it was unnatural and horrid, but Harry thought the same thing about English, so he supposed fair was fair.
To this day Dudley had never been sure if he wasn’t supposed to mess with the new knob or if his father had meant he could no longer be friends with Harry. His childish mind had accepted quicker than he’d now like to admit that he reasoned it meant both, and took Vernon’s words to heart, especially when he had mentioned their special language. Regrettably, he began treating his former friend just like his father did while his mother just watched from the sidelines with small noises of encouragement when Vernon was around.
Dudley watched as Petunia’s face somehow got even redder than his father’s at that. She huffed and glared at him once more only to promptly turn around and went to sit on hers and his dad’s bed. Dudley thought she looked like a five year old child that just got told they wouldn’t be able to get the toy they wanted, or him during last Christmas now that he thought about it. He really should apologize to Harry for literally everything that’s happened in his life so far. It’s funny how one moment in your life could change your entire look on what you’ve done and how utterly wrong you’ve been. His father on the other hand decided that his wife had given up on kicking the strange man out too quickly and decided to make himself look bigger.
Harry poked his head out from under the pillow and glanced over at his cousin. He was certain that if snakes could look drowsy then he would look exhausted. The bruises on his ribs were burning from all the moving around he had to do in their hasty escape from the letters, and he was fairly certain one of them was broken. His stomach growled in contempt once more as he waited on Dudley to speak. Even his scales somehow ached from exhaustion, and he couldn’t for the life of him remember the last time he had drank something. He knew if he looked in the mirror in his skin form that his eyes would have dark circles under them and his ribs would be sticking out under Dudley’s hand-me-downs.
The man looked stunned once all of their questions had been asked and they were waiting anxiously for a reply. He went on to explain that a parselmouth is a person who can talk to snakes and that it was an extremely rare trait to have. While a maledictus was normally a witch cursed to turn into an animal and that they would eventually be forced to live their lives as their animal form instead of their human one. Dudley gulped at that and imagined Harry stuck in his other form, only able to change his scale colors for entertainment.
A wave of nausea overtook him, as it always did when he felt like he was talking for too long or when he felt like he was being too much of a person than was allowed; he forced his eyes shut to readjust himself. His hands clenched at his sides upon reflex and fought the urge to change back into a snake once more as he gathered the courage to ask the goblin what he wanted to know.
So with a deep breath he gathered up the torn pages once more, braced himself for more of her words and was prepared to only stop reading once he was done.
They left the small bathroom and were greeted with his parents yelling at some long haired man with a rather large nose. Dudley thought he looked like his old math teacher Mr. Wilder who wasn’t one of his favorites, then again he didn’t really like any of them. The man was glaring at his parents and his father seemed to be squirming under his gaze. If Dudley had seen this a couple days ago then he would have come to the defence of his parents, but now he only wished to encourage his father’s fear, especially since he knew what was going to happen to him after this strange man left. Upon closer inspection he saw that the man had a small box wrapped in dark green wrapping paper in his hands.
To this day neither he nor Dudley were sure how the other boy had survived the bite since upon further research Harry had found that the form was of a red spiny bush viper. He was certain that his Aunt knew this now as well since she was the one that implemented his vegetarian diet after his initial transformation.
“You know you could…. Um… I mean the bed is big enough for the both of us I think. Only if you want that is?”
‘How on earth is he still sleeping?’ Dudley thought as he got a hand out from under the snake and poked him in between his eyes.
He mumbled out against his pillow after a brief silence. The words came out thick with the general haze of sleep ringing in them.
“Well it seems that you have a decision to make Harry and if you’d like I’ll speak to the Wizarding Council to see about becoming your official guardian instead of your aunt and uncle.”
“Apparently. It doesn’t make sense though. I mean, I get you… but me? I haven’t done anything magical in my life. I’m perfectly, boringly ordinary just like him.”
Snape quickly explained that the inside actually had another world he had created by using magic and that he intended for this place to be a safe space for the boys to go to if they needed, whether in the muggle or wizarding world.
Dudley was actually surprised when he didn’t hear the little keypad smacking against his father’s hip in the cabin as it had become a constant presence throughout the years but then his mother was still yelling at a still sleeping Harry and overwhelming his ears of anything else going on.
Dudley let out a small laugh and shook his head in agreement as his father puffed up in front of the man and shouted at him to leave. He imagined his father with a pig’s tail coming out of his pants and bouncing in the air as he waved his arms around in frustration. The intruder seemed to completely ignore his father’s display and turned to them once more with shocked wide eyes as Harry spoke. The spontaneous rip that came from his father’s pants seconds later made both he and Harry practically jump out of their skins. Dudley watched in horror as the pig tail he had just imagined in his head made its way out of his father’s jeans just like he thought it would. He felt the absence of Harry’s hand soon after and didn’t need to turn around to know he had shifted and was probably hiding in a corner somewhere.
Harry reread the entries three times before he was even slightly ready to give them over to the professor despite the man’s insistence to read them once he realized Harry was done the first time. His fingers shook as he passed them over to the older man and tears ran silently down his face as he realized that his mother had endured the same torture he did, and from her own husband no less. He felt himself being enveloped in a hug and only let out a shaky breath in reply.
“Oh? You don’t normally give out presents. Who’s it for then? If you give me a good reason I’ll keep it off the books.”
The noise from the adults in the other room filtered through the closed door and he tried to tune into it even though it was nearly impossible to hear anything over his mother’s crowing.
Madame Elaine, or who Harry had assumed was her, looked a lot like Dudley’s Aunt Marge if she were as thin as a toothpick. Her attitude however, was the complete opposite of the woman as she smiled kindly at Harry and didn’t comment on his unruly hair. The shop itself looked like a big antique store with baubles and trinkets everywhere. Harry swore he saw a necklace move by itself even though he knew it was impossible. Maybe he really did need glasses?
“Not at all little one! You are much grander than that cheap muggle imitation. For you have the ability to hide yourself by using your surroundings when you allow your scales to change color and with proper training you could even learn how to become completely invisible! The shedded flakes from your horns are often used by wizardkind as wand cores. Isn't that exciting?”
Harry sent out a small hiss at them when either got close and would rub his head against Dudley’s chest right after. With each hiss he sent their way they would flinch more than the last so that it became an odd sort of dance with the three of them. Dudley ignored his parents and focused on Harry’s odd display of affection instead. All of the books he had read and internet searches he had done had given him three answers for the behavior.
Petunia had taken to cooking the others a meal of thick sausage and grits on the stove while Harry snuck in a few pieces of leftover broccoli he had stashed in his pant pockets before they left. His teeth tingle when Dudley suddenly wafted his extra sausage in his face. Both completely aware that Harry wasn’t allowed to eat it as they kept him on a strict vegetable scraps only diet. Which basically meant that whenever Petunia cooked vegetables with their meals, once every few weeks or so, Harry was allowed to eat a few handfuls of whatever they had after the plates had been sitting in the sink and doused in water for rinsing during which most of the scraps were washed down the drain.
“He takes care of flowers and other magical plants. He can do small elemental magic to help with their growth which is how he made the storm cloud. He was trying to find a nice field to grow some plants in but then he got chased into here by that other snake. I helped him out and now he calls me Keeper. Said he wants to stay with me if possible but that his search for a nice field with a low chance of predators comes first.”
Going from snake to human when he was trying to hear something was always strange. Sometimes he missed entire words that were spoken and other times he just had to take a few seconds to reply. He found that his hearing was relatively the same in both forms for some reason: vibrations were sent to his jaw and then he could somehow make sense of them. Sometimes he could translate rather loud vibrations and other times he could only translate normal ones depending on how hard he was focusing.
“Well, it’s just that when I were to eventually change into my snake form then the ring would probably fall off because it’s so small but if you could turn it into a bracelet then it would maybe fit in both of my forms. …I think.”
“No it's certainly not! I’m not some great big snake with horns that can turn invisible! I’m just Harry! Boring, ordinary Harry Potter who has dead parents!”
His pajamas, like all of his clothes, were Dudley’s from two years ago and made him look like a small doll trapped inside of a pillowcase. Harry didn’t seem to notice him watching, or didn’t care, as he turned around and took off his shirt only to put on an equally large t-shirt and sweater.
Harry could only nod his head in agreement as he took the ring out of the box. He had never gotten a real gift before much less anything that had to do with his mother. He wasn’t allowed to ask questions about her at the Dursleys unless he wanted to get hit with something. His aunt and Uncle viewed his mother’s name as the foulest curse word imaginable to the point that even the flower wasn’t allowed anywhere near the house. He started to place the ring on his right thumb only to realize the small metal probably would fall right off when he changed into a snake.
“Could you… maybe make it bigger? So that it’s a bracelet instead of a ring or would that be wrong?”
His mom shouted at the newcomer. He swore her face was getting redder than his dad’s at this point. Dudley felt something pull on his shirt behind him and took a second to realize it was Harry. He could feel the other boy shaking slightly through his shirt and thought that if clothing could talk then his would be screaming in pain with how tight Harry was holding onto him through it. He was probably worried mom would turn on him soon like she always did. The stranger seemed to take notice of Harry as well, glancing at them both momentarily before he turned his attention back to his mother.
Snape had only told them about the goblins a few minutes ago and Harry was getting quite annoyed. This was the man that the school had sent to explain how their new world worked and how they fit into it but so far he hadn’t explained anything that they didn’t already know! Sure they had learned the official words for his mother’s blood curse and snake-speak but they already knew about those things before. He wanted to yell at the man. He wanted real answers to questions like: did they always need wands to perform magic, why did no one else notice the strange creatures that were now walking around in broad daylight, and why on earth was everyone constantly whispering about him!
“Don’t call me that you disgusting sewer rat! Why on earth would they send you of all people to come get them anyway?!”
“Harry, this is Slurd. He’s the head goblin at Gringotts and well, I believe it’s best if he explains.”
Professor Snape seemed to not feel that Dudley needed a reply as he just walked out of the cabin and left the boys to follow. Harry shrugged when Dudley looked at him like the man was crazy but they decided to follow him outside anyway as they clutched their pajamas in their arms. They arrived outside only to find the odd professor holding his right hand out with a long stick in it, like he was trying to hail a taxi.
“Your mother instructed me to give you this, little horned serpent.” Slurd said while holding out the envelope for Harry to take.
“Ah! Well then… that is odd. No matter, I shall explain as much as I can to you little cerastes! I am what wizards call a Coco Rumsey Catcher. Although we prefer the term Oruwin. As for what you are little one; you are a horned serpent.”
It was strange how two words: like him, could be filled with love one second then so much hate and fear it consumed your very core the next. Harry was thankful for it though because for the first time in their lives since the accident he felt like they were finally on the same page on how awful the elder Dursleys' really were. Petunia was more passive, but Vernon was known to favor his fists more than words and knew where to strike to not raise suspicion.
Harry nodded eagerly, feeling too weak to speak again. Draco climbed into bed and sat close to Harry but made sure not to touch him, Harry looked at him like he was subconsciously doing a safety check before he curled into his roommate’s side and softly cried. He was embarrassed but he also couldn’t bring himself to pull away. Harry was always so shaken and cold - despite the excessive sweating - after a nightmare and he felt so safe and warm at that moment that he didn’t want it to end.
The first lash was followed by 4 more quickly, one after the other. Harry could hardly breathe he couldn’t remember any pain this intense.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand under the table and gave it an encouraging squeeze where no one could see it. Harry didn’t have time to analyze how Dracos’s simple touch made his heart flutter, at least not this moment, so he stored that information away to be dealt with later as he steadied himself in anticipation.
They were able to play and race each other around for nearly two hours before it was time to go back to the castle for dinner and Harry found himself feeling the best he had since returning to school, he was laughing and joking with his new housemates and they seemed to be enjoying his company as well.
“That’s exactly what I’m saying Pads.” Remus pulled Sirius into a tight hug and began to play with the shorter man’s hair. “We’d be able to get you out of Grimmulad place for a while too. I know how hard it is for you to be there.” Remus kissed the top of his head
“Harry it’s Draco, no one is going to hurt you. You’re at Hogwarts and you’re safe. Please breathe love, you’re going to make yourself sick. “ Draco thought maybe he was getting through because the begged stopped even if the hiding and crying hadn’t.
Harry needed for all of this to be a terrible dream, but that was unlikely so he’d have to settle for a distraction. Lucky he had lots of practice using distraction to avoid reality - he lived with the Dursleys for merlin’s sake.
“Hello, Mr. Potter, it’s a pleasure to meet you.” Amelia Bones spoke with a very kind voice from her seat at the front of the room,
Harry bit through the pain that was getting worse with every line he wrote, he tried to keep track of how many times he had carved the words into his hand but he lost count after 17 it was too hard to work through the pain and keep track. It felt like hours when the professor permitted Harry to stop, and it may have been there wasn’t a clock that he could see.
A thick silence filled the room once Madam Bones put the report papers neatly back down on her desk.
Harry snuck into the bathroom to change his robes and straighten up, which didn’t take long. When he was finished he reorganized the things he had used and cast a quiet spell to make his bed,  and then he checked the time, he still had 15 minutes before he had to meet Snape. Harry thought about waiting down in the common room, but the thought of running into someone else was enough to vanquish that idea. His professor told him the other students would be informed of his arrival, and Draco told him that he would be treated well but the idea was still too daunting for harry to face alone.
“Hey, I like gardening - as long as noting tries to kill me while I’m doing it.” Harry laughed with him as they slowly approached the greenhouse.
“And Harry, finish that glass of water before you leave. Keep hydrated. My meeting shouldn’t take long, I’ll come to find you all in the common room when I’m finished.”
“Harry, I’ve just had a meeting with Professor Dumbledore,” Snape spoke as soon as Harry was seated.
2. There is a spoiler for the aforementioned chapter 7 in the endnotes, so if you don't want to see that skip over that.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have unloaded all of that on you. You don’t have to worry about my drama.” Harry sighed and Draco quickly swooped back in.
“No, your truck is full and in my office along with your broom. I will have a house-elf move your truck while I show you to your room. I’ll send your broom down to the Slytherin quidditch locker. Come now Mr. Potter before you fall asleep on that sofa.” Snape stood with his words and motioned for Harry to follow.
Harry especially didn’t like this, he knew the Headmaster would have questions about why he got re-sorted but Harry didn’t want to talk about it. Everyone in Slytherin had told him there was no rush to talk about the things that had happened, he wanted to wait a while.
“Yeah, I can hardly feel it at all. Thank you for this, I’m sorry I disrupted your evening.” Harry could feel the anxiety rising inside of him, he didn’t want Draco to be upset with him, he wanted Draco to like him.
“Oh,” Harry was a little confused but mostly relieved that Draco’s best friend saw potential in them
“Oh, I’m not sure - doesn’t sound like something Aunt Petunia would have done, with Dudley maybe, but definitely not with me. So I guess I can’t actually remember but it sounds like something my mum or dad would have done before they died.” Harry sighed as that longing feeling he got when he imagined his parents washed over him.
“Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy please stay back a moment.” The professor called as students filtered out.
The fifth-years had double potions with Gryffindor first thing after breakfast, then single Herbology and Charms before lunch. It looked like on Tuesdays and Thursdays all of the Slytherin fourth and fifth years were free after lunch aside from the few students who were taking muggle studies. Unfortunately both double potions and double DADA we’re classes held with Gryffindor and Slytherin.
Draco just nodded and smiled, a smile made Harry’s insides flip, a smile that Harry was slowly falling for. So he scurried off to his new room and grabbed the 4 remaining vials of dreamless sleep from his trunk, Harry took a deep breath and made his way back to the common room to find Snape.
“My cousin Dudley was never very smart and it always made him mad when others got better marks than him but he didn’t want to put in any work to get the higher marks himself. So when my aunt and uncle realized if I was doing worse than him it would make him happy I started getting in trouble,” Harry had to stop for a moment remembering the type of trouble he used to get in and the punishments it would lead to, “- I got in trouble anytime I got a higher mark than Dudley. I thought it would be different at Hogwarts because he isn’t here, but then when I got higher grades than Hermione she would get upset just like Dudley used to so I just kept doing a little worse than I actually could because I didn’t want to lose my friend. I didn’t want anyone to be mad at me, so I just worked like Ron did and it kept everyone happy.” when he was finished talking Harry couldn’t bring himself to look at his professor, he was scared of seeing that look of disappointment or even worse pity. Under the table, Draco gave his hand a reassuring squeeze which gave Harry the courage to look up at his classmate.
Of course, he would also need to stop at Gringotts but he shouldn’t have a problem doing all that in one day. He just had to tell his uncle that he was leaving a day early this year so he’d need to be dropped off on the last of August and not the first of September. They’d probably be thrilled to have him out of the house a day sooner.
“The Weasley twins snagged this old map from Flich’s office, it has a bunch of tunnels and passages. It’s enchanted to show the moving stairs and rooms - although that room isn’t on it so I bet whoever made the map never found it. It has a tracker that shows you where everyone in the castle is with little labeled dots.”
“I’m ready for a few fucking words with the man myself.” Sirius snapped, now that Harry was gone he felt comfortable letting out all of his anger.
“Are you mad? Snape never lets anyone miss class, if we didn’t take advantage of it we would never hear the end of it. Besides, it would have been worse for us to show up after he told me to bring you back here.” Draco spoke lightly
“I’m glad you’re adjusting Potter, come and let me know if you need anything.” that was Milicent Bulstrode
The boys made it to Snape’s classroom as the professor pulled out a stack of finished essays that needed grading, he was confident enough in the students’ potions skills to allow himself time to grade as they worked.
“How-?” Harry was cut off as he felt the now familiar pain of the Cruciatus Curse fill his body, it felt like every single cell in his body was being struck by lightning and ripped in half at the same time. The pain continued and Harry shook to the sound of his uncle laughing and his enemy yelling out another dark spell,
“I’m going to talk to Dumbledore tomorrow after we hear from Harry about the trial,” Remus announced as soon as he was sure Harry was gone.
“Harry, when was the last time you had help getting through a nightmare?” Severus thought little of the question as he asked it
For the first time in weeks, Harry felt like he might survive. He just hoped this feeling could last.
As always thank y'all so much for reading and leaving comments and kudos it means the world to me. I hope everyone had a happy new year. I made a 2021 bingo card and added a "JKR lawsuit" and a "BBC Johnlock confirmed" square so that's how my day went.
He knew it was getting late and if the sun went down he had no chance of finding the last fake snitch so Harry started circling the field his eyes scanning furiously.
It was much easier to live at Grimmauld Place when Remus was around, but his boyfriend had been gone for the last 3 days, luckily he was scheduled to return this evening.
Remus had stopped by the hospital after the maze as well, he told Harry that he and Sirius would be there for him when they could but reminded him that Sirius was still in hiding and with his lycanthropy, there wasn’t much his godfathers would be able to do. He promised he’d be in touch when the next term had started, but the whole conversation made Harry feel like someone else was abandoning him now.
As planned Harry changed into Quidditch robes before dinner and rushed off to find Hedwig as soon as he had finished eating. The letter to Sirius was brief but Harry felt it would do the trick.
“Very well, I do hope you remember that we hold ourselves to high expectations in this house, and well I know that punishment cannot always be avoided I suggest you do not make a habit out of them, am I understood?”
“Have there been any problems? You can say so if there have been Harry, I know I’m not your legal guardian but I’m still looking out for you.”
“It’s alright Harry, I hadn’t expected you to. Tomorrow after you return from Hogsmeade you’ll have an hour to freshen up and change into some decent robes. Not the formal dress robes, but the nicest set you have. We will go to Professor Dumbledore’s office where we will be able to floo to the Ministry of Magic.”
“You are not in a position to make demands Severus, or did you forget how you came into this job.” Dumbledores tone still had all of Harry’s senses on high alert, like he was taking in a thousand things every second and processing them all at once.
“Dinky is bringing the items Sir requested, the items for Harry Potter Sir.” Dinky bowed and placed the items on the desk next to Severus.
“I know I miss him too, every day. I missed you too Pads, I know it was worse for you but it was hard for me too. Grieving you both and not knowing - not knowing what happened that night.” he paused to keep himself from completely breaking down, “I’m, God I’m so glad you’re back Sirius. I need you.”
“Draco calm down and let go of Harry’s arm.” Pansy’s voice was firm but soft and Draco finally noticed the horrified look on Harry’s face. The second Draco let go Harry flung his hand back and cradled it to his chest.
Harry already knew everything that Madam Bones had said, Snape was very thorough in explaining the court procedure before they came, but Harry was happy to have it clarified again, “yes ma’am, thank you, I understand.”
“it‘s weird being back here again, during the day, nowhere near the full moon…” Remus noted, trying to kill time while waiting for Harry.
“She hasn’t been removed from the castle yet?” Remus asked, absolutely appalled that she was still teaching after torturing a student in detention
“No, of course, there’s no misunderstanding. Please take a seat.” Albus gestured towards the two chairs on the other side of his desk looking deeply disgruntled at Snape’s statement.
Harry didn’t write to any of the Weasleys, Ron had told him while he was in the hospital wing that he needed to stay away. The twins sent him some awful pranks that they typically save the people they truly want revenge against, he had even received a howler from Ginny where she told him in no uncertain terms that Percy’s death was his fault and that she didn’t want to see him again if she could avoid it.
Slowly he pried the window open, got onto the edge, and jumped, aiming for the hedge under his window. When Harry climbed out of the bush and stood he found that he was very dizzy, he gathered himself as smoothly as possible and he was struck with a horrifying thought - he hadn’t figured out a way to get back into his room. Harry cursed himself, how had he forgotten to plan a way back.
“Yeah, of course.” Draco slowly added the ingredient and both boys watched the potion change colors once again, Draco thought this must be one of the prettiest things he’s ever made in Snape’s classroom.
Sirius pulled himself back so that he could grab Remus by the neck and pulled the taller man in for a deep, passionate kiss.
“N-no, no it’s alright Draco can stay.” Harry took another stabilizing breath and Draco reached for his hand under the table like he had when Ron approached them during the last potions lesson.
“I would like to ask you some questions Harry, just let me know if you need to stop or slow down,” Snape spoke, Harry only nodded
“Harry, I need to see them and make sure that they’re not infected. Would you like for me to look privately or do you want Professor Snape to stay?” Harry felt a panic rising inside of him. No one had cared about Harry’s personal life for the last four years, why did they care now?
Snape had an hour to prepare for his new student, he would have to write some memos of his own to all of the other Slytherins, he needed to speak with Mr. Rackharrow about keeping the common room empty, and he needed to speak with whoever Harry Potter would be rooming with. Snape glided out of his office and scanned the common room looking for his head boy.
“Three times if you count Quirrell...ooh and four if you count memory from Tom Riddle’s diary,” Harry interjected
Wishing everyone a Happy Holidays - if you celebrate Christmas Happy Christmas Eve - and if you don't celebrate Christmas I hope your holiday season has kept you Happy and Healthy.
“It’s more than just my pride it’s not all about some old rivalry. You have to know it’s more than that Rem. I don’t trust Snape, I know he holds a grudge and he hated James and me. The fact that he’s responsible for Harry scares me, what if he uses that against him? My whole family was in Slytherin, I know what it’s like and they can be awful...I just don’t want that for Harry.” Sirius let out a long sigh and Remus stood alongside him.
Sirius addressed the finished letter and handed it over, it didn’t say much. He told the man he wanted to speak with Harry to better understand the situation before encouraging him to do anything drastic, “You’ll take it first thing tomorrow?” he asked, Sirius would love nothing more than to escape the hollow halls of Grimmauld Place even if it was just to run errands. Alas, it was far too risky still.
Snape had gotten over 30 minutes into a lecture on ‘Confusing Concoction’ when the bell chimed, he reminded his student to finish the next two chapters and come prepared to brew the confusing draught, next class.
“You can’t honestly be that daft Crabbe.” Draco chuckled after Vincent finished his story about his summer adventures.
Somewhat ironically, It was during that exact thought that trouble made its way into the potions classroom.
“It’s what we’re here for Potter, we look out for each other, we’re a family and you can share whatever you need with us and we’ll listen. Tonight, however, it is late, and we have classes tomorrow, so I’m going to give you a quick rundown of some other house expectations, and then we can all get some sleep. In the morning we can get you fully adjusted.” The blonde paused but when there was nothing said he continued.
Draco held him as he had earlier that night, he was panicky he felt he had done a million things wrong and he had convinced himself that in the morning Harry would be back to hating him. That thought completely petrified Draco, making a mistake was one thing but losing Harry. For once in Draco’s life, he felt like he belonged, and he knew it was because of Harry - he couldn’t lose him before he even had a chance to know him at all.
“It’s alright Harry, it’s not your fault. Would you prefer Draco or Pansy to help you get it settled?” Snape remained seated but was ready to help Harry re-adjust if needed.
“I still don’t believe you, we’ve studied together for years and you’ve never even been close to as good as me. But figures, the Golden Boy would get congratulated for something the rest of us have already been doing since the first year. You do belong in Slytherin, a dirty snake like the rest of them.” Hermione spat and stomped from the room - abandoning the book.
“I haven’t - I’m not ready for all of it yet. Honestly, I don’t even understand it all yet. I just know things got really bad, after the tournament that is. The end of term and this past summer were...awful. When I came back I hoped things would be okay again, but everyone shut me out; I mean everyone, not a single Gryffindor had anything nice to say. We had fought before but I could just tell something was different.”
“I did Sir, but only after he had verbally attacked Potter,” Draco spoke with a smug honesty that used to make Harry’s blood boil but now he made him chuckle a little.
Harry looked around the room, there were four large four-poster beds, they looked nearly identical to the ones from his old dorm except for curtains and bed coverings these were an elegant silver and green, a harsh contrasts to the bright red and gold ones he was used to. It was colder in the dungeons than it had been up in the Gryffindor tower but Harry noticed an unlit fireplace that could be lit if it got any colder.
“I was stressed about exams last year and was just pacing about when the door showed up, I’ve come up here a few times since and it’s always a bit different. Like it knows exactly what I’ll need. It’s never been like this before, normally there are sofas and bookcases.” she gestured around the room that looked so vastly different then before.
“I’ve never hated you, I was jealous and hurt because my whole life I heard stories of you and I knew you were my age and I just wanted to know you and to be your friend and you weren’t interested. So I watched you all the time I couldn’t take my eyes off you, and it wasn’t because you’ve fought dementors or the Dark Lord or any of the “Chosen One” bullshit. I wanted to know you, Harry Potter. Now that you’re here and I know how poorly you’ve been treated I’m going to help you, and of course, I want to make up for all the awful things I did, but that’s not the only reason why. I care for you Harry, and not out of some new obligation, I’ve always cared and now I can show it.”
“Don’t be daft Harry, someone will walk with you to the great hall - it’s going to be a war zone out there where word gets out. You won’t be facing it alone.” he paused then added, “good night Pott- Harry” and with that Draco slid his curtains closed.
“I just need to know that he’s okay Moony. I promised Lily and James I would take care of him and I’ve failed. I’m not here to do anyone else bidding, not Dumbledores, not anyone’s. I just need to see that he’s okay Moons. I’ve been sick with worry since the moment I found out and there’s nothing I can tell myself to make it go away.” Sirius stood and began to pace, “And if he is okay. If he’s happy and safe...I guess I’ll have to be okay with the fact that he’s in Slytherin.” Sirius practically growled as he mentioned the house
“I’ve never heard of one before so I don’t know what it's called, but it looked like a regular quill and she told me it wouldn’t need ink so I started writing and it felt everything I wrote digging into my skin” Harry clarified,
“It’s okay Harry you can have any feelings you need to have. I’m not going to leave you alone, I promise. I want to help you but stop me if you need to, alright.” Harry could only manage a nod, but that was enough for Draco.
Unfortunately, even the best of weekends had to end and this Monday was bound to bring all sorts of trouble. The Slytherins had Defense again today and Dumbledore had not made any significant progress since his meeting with Snape and Harry, so Umbridge was still there to torture them all. The dread Harry felt imagining another class with the pink-clad women was momentarily relieved when an unfamiliar owl delivered him a letter.
“Niffler weed” Greengrass spoke when they reached the door to the Slytherin common room and the eight students made their way in.
“Maybe there’s some other dark magic in you,” Blaise spoke in a joking tone but Draco felt like there was some validity to what was said.
“I guess I’m used to always having to earn my keep and prove myself worthy, I don’t know how to handle when people do something nice or decent for me. I started doing chores with Aunt Petunia when I was four, and if they weren’t done well there were consequences.” Harry paused and took a deep breath, he wasn’t ready to share all the details yet.
“You don’t have to be brave all the time Harry, you’re allowed to be scared. I hate that so many people have taught you otherwise.” Draco sighed, Harry Potter was getting pretty great at shattering his heart, “Come on, let’s go to sleep.” Draco smiled and ran his hand through Harry’s hair. He rolled over so he was laying on his side and he pulled Harry into his chest, making him the little spoon, as he continued to play with the boy’s hair.
Draco had spoken with his mates before Harry arrived and he agreed to take care of introductions, but Blaise and Theo were awake as well. Harry felt bad that they had stayed up because of him, but his heart fluttered a little knowing that they had, maybe things could be different here.
“Course we can.” Pansy’s friendliest voice filled the room, “But seriously finish that water or Snape will have both our heads.” she let out a gentle laugh and Harry quickly finished the glass.
“No Petunia, I don’t want any more of the boys ruddy nonsense in the house. I’ll put the blasted thing in the garage. Not like he ever goes in there.” Vernon grumbled.
The rest of the shopping went by as quickly as he had imagined, he didn’t run into anyone, which made sense, they had all probably done their shopping weeks ago. This was clear at the potions shops, they were low on bat spleen, cowbane, and Russian Dragon Nails he was able to get some, but not in the quality or quantity he assumed he would need. Hopefully, he wouldn’t be using them until after his first trip to Hogsmeade where he could check in the local potions shop. Before leaving Harry took a stroll through the pre-made potions and grabbed a few vials of dreamless sleep and a container full of fast-acting bruise salve before checking out and heading back to his room.
It took about 30 minutes, but when Sirius left the library he was sure that he had thoroughly checked the book catalogs; he had every book the Black Family Library held on the subject. Sirius dropped the large stacks of books he had in both hands onto a sofa in the study as gently as he could. He made sure to close and lock the library door before sorting through the books looking for the best one to start with.
“Now Mr. Potter, along with the potions I will be instructing you to drink to help with your recovery you will also need to pay close attention to what you’re eating because your body is severely undernourished. I assume that your stomach is too small to handle large meals so you will need to eat a minimum of 3 meals a day. If Professor Snape and I don’t notice an appropriate amount of change in your nourishment you will need to start eating prepared meals that I will instruct the house-elves to make and bring to you each day.” Harry would eat whatever he needed to avoid that, he didn’t need another thing making him stand out.
“It true…” Harry spoke sheepishly he didn’t want all of this to come up but he figured it was better he tells his new housemates than just waiting for more secrets to come out. “I don’t eat enough over the holidays so when I get back I can’t eat too much all at once. Don’t worry about me though, I’m working with Madame Pomfrey and in a few weeks I’ll be back to normal”
“But come on, I want to have a chance to eat before we get our schedules.” Blaise prompted, quickening the groups walking speed.
“What happened at your detention Harry?” Pansy questioned softy as she led Harry to the couch she and Draco had been occupying.
“Moony,” Sirius had started to cry and Remus only noticed with the sound of his voice breaking, “I wanna get out of here.”
“Malfoy attacked me Professor!” was all that Ron was able to say that wouldn’t incriminate him further.
“Yeah” Harry spoke up, looking into Draco’s vast grey eyes “I would like that, to talk and calm down and get to know you.” The boys smiled at each other and walked side by side back to the Slytherin dorms to enjoy their free period.
“Anything you need me to do today Aunt Petunia.” Harry thought if he did something they wanted first he could soften the blow that changing the date of his departure would cause.
“My God.” he took a deep breath, “Sirius, do you think that Dumbledore could have been the one stopping Harry’s letters?” he asked calmly
He was lost in thought about Lily and James Potter when there was a rasp on his door, when he opened it Urquhart stood followed by three of his fifth-year boys - Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott, and Draco Malfoy.
Harry was almost embarrassed that he had just called his crush ‘adorable’ to his face after cuddling for god knows how long but was relieved when he looked over and saw how bright Draco’s eyes looked and how far his smile stretched.
“He was so angry, but he didn’t sound mad he was cold and distant and he reminded me so much of Aunt Petunia.” Harry gasped for breath and he began to shake, “and then he started to yell and I don’t know why but I thought I was going to be hurt. It wasn’t like a nightmare where I thought he was Aunt Petunia I knew I was in his office and I knew Snape was there but I just thought - I got so scared.” Harry cried as he spoke, he felt cold and exhausted but he could feel the anxiousness fading. Perhaps just talking about it had helped.
“That is odd, why would she think you would need her help again? Not like you’re going to encounter another Black Quill.” Pansy wondered aloud.
“Now is not the time for this conversation, Albus. You know that what’s done is done, pressing Mr. Potter for details that will not change anything will not do anyone any good.” Snape was practically spitting as rage boiled inside of him.
“Very good Harry, I’m going to stand up and walk around you. I’ll place the blanket over your shoulders and if you need - I’ll help you pull it around your torso and onto your lap. Is that alright?” Snape spoke clearly but kept his soft tone; he explained every action he was going to take so that nothing caught Harry by surprise.
“Yeah, just have to finish a conversation from earlier. I’ll come to find you when I’m done?” Harry spoke with uncertainty to his voice
“Mr. Potter,” Snape started when they were alone, “This is an important matter and I expect your honesty, you will not be in any trouble so long as you are honest with me.”
“Thank you, Albus. Now, Harry, this might be a bit uncomfortable but can you tell me what happened in class to warrant the detention?”
“Well, we’re friends now but we just skipped over all those parts where we get to know each other. I want to learn more about you and I want to tell you about myself, so as long as you’re honestly feeling up to chatting with me for a while I think now would be as good a time as any to start.”
Draco cast a shrinking charm and the jacket shrunk down to perfectly fit Harry’s slim figure. Draco, who had never worn any hand-me-downs in his life didn’t understand why Harry hadn’t gotten himself new things when he got to Hogwarts; he knew the boy had the finical means to do so. The Potters weren’t
After inheriting the ancestral home from his godfather Sirius Black, Harry considered it his duty to be a good custodian of the many historical treasures on the property.  Studying the Black family tree, Harry was bothered by the fact that it was so out of date.  Black family descendants born in the last three decades were not on the tapestry.  Harry was also troubled that disowned members of the family had been removed from the tapestry, burn marks appearing in place of their names. The thought occurred to him that a powerful symbol of dismantling the ideology of blood purity that had engendered the wizarding wars would be to update the tapestry, restoring and adding Black family members who were not pureblood or who had married non-pureblood spouses.
Draco had made himself quite comfortable in Harry’s home. He had chosen a bedroom on the third floor and decorated it to his satisfaction in his favorite colors of silver and green.  Not wanting to overstay his welcome, however, he decided to broach the subject of when he should be returning to Malfoy Manor.
Draco was touched by Harry’s concern.  He also wondered why Harry wanted him to view this particular memory. Of course Draco knew Cedric, but they had never been close.  As seekers on opposing Quidditch teams, they had been athletic rivals, but there was never the animosity between them that had characterized Draco’s and Harry’s rivalry. Nor was there the friendliness and camaraderie that Harry and Cedric seemed to enjoy.  Draco felt some remorse recalling how cliquish and standoffish he had been during his youth.  Spending all his time with Crabbe and Goyle when he could’ve been getting to know impressive wizards like Cedric.
