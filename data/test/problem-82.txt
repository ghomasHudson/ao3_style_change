Harry felt
February finally arrived, bringing with it warmer weather and the restart of the Quidditch season. The day of the third match, Harry walked down the grounds along with Ron and Hermione, both of them wearing their scarlet scarfs, which only drew more attention to Harry's green one.
Harry sighed and rubbed his neck. “Fine, alright, I’ll hear you. But after this I will go to my room and pretend this conversation didn’t take place.”
before disappearing.
But there’s no fit of anger, no yelling, no broken noses nor jinxes. There’s not even surprise in Malfoy’s face, as he squeezes his eyes shut and presses his face into Harry’s chest again. “I was hoping it was all just a nightmare,” comes Malfoy’s muffled voice, which Harry hadn’t heard all night and cements further the fact that this is
There was a moment of silence as Harry decided between dismissing the compliment because speaking parsel hadn’t been something he had worked for, or asking Draco to call him impressive again because he liked the way he said it. “Flattery,” he resolved, grinning when Draco rolled his eyes.
sends a letter anyway."
It turned out that Marcus Belby didn’t know much about his uncle, and Harry caught the exact moment Slughorn lost his interest in him, the friendly smile on his old face turning into a displeased grimace.
“You are not skiving off either,” said Draco severely. “Have you forgotten I’m a Prefect?"
Ron grinned. “Exactly, which is why you will agree with me when I say he looks like one of Lockhart’s pixies.” He threw Hermione an accusatory glance. “And not with
Ron gaped. “What, really?"
Harry rolled his eyes and placed a bottle of ink next to Malfoy's empty one.
“Don’t even joke with that.” Draco grimaced. “Terribly unsanitary. I’ve heard the owner has a goat there. A
“Right,” said Sirius, studying Harry carefully. “Your father was a stubborn git as well." The man looked pained. “Harry, I shouldn’t have said what I said. It wasn’t my place, and I’m sure James would have loved you, no matter what."

wants to talk to him," pointed Zabini. “He said so himself.”
“This is a very spacious room,” commented Draco, his voice pulling Harry out of his thoughts. Now that there were no other students and no cushions on the ground, it was very easy to admire the size of the Room. Especially through the quietness, when the only sounds echoing around it were the steps Draco was taking from the wall to the centre.
“It’s fine,” assured Harry, amused by his reaction. “I promise."
Moody examined Harry silently, a thoughtful expression on his face. “If they are not using this to get information, perhaps we can."
“They are
Then everyone started getting up from the table and Harry realized he was out of time.
“Dementors.”
had said Ron, and even if Harry hadn’t brought it up, he was starting to think that might be the case.
“Er, yes,” admitted Harry. “I do."
He couldn’t help but groan at the sudden loss, reluctantly opening his eyes again and finding a view that made him blink twice. Draco’s face was completely red, weakly frowning down at Harry as he covered his mouth with a hand. The other one was on Harry's chest, keeping a small distance between them, and Harry finally noticed Draco's back was pressed against the wall.
Harry gave him a sneer of his own. "Wouldn't you like to know, Malfoy?"
“Everything is fine, it’s just late.” Draco didn’t look at him, instead turning towards Hermione. He seemed to pause for a moment, then giving her a nod. “Thank you, Granger, you helped a lot."
Harry recognized her immediately; the same fiery red hair and kind smile he had seen in photos. His mother looked young, must have been around his age at the time, and was dressed in formal clothes just like the rest of the people in the photo, a younger Slughorn included.
"I wonder what they are talking about," mused Harry.
Draco frowned. “Surely you know there must be a reason you were given three months to prepare, Potter.”
The Hogwarts Champion seemed to be the most troubling matter.
Hermione and Ron looked at him weirdly when he told them to go ahead, explaining he wanted to ask something to Grubbly-Plank. Hermione said she doubted the professor would tell him anything else about Hagrid, and Harry happily took on the excuse and insisted he should try. Ron’s stomach growled at that moment too, helping his cause. They left.
Even as he didn’t let go of Nott, Crabbe seemed shaken by his words and exchanged a worried look with the others. Parkinson grimaced. “Draco,” she said, sounding nervous. “Maybe you should think it better.”
“Of course he does,” said Draco defensively, as if Harry had offended his father somehow. Then he glanced away. “But he usually just listened, and sometimes he..."
“Is Sirius alright?” was the first.
“No!” cried McGonagall. She quickly took out her wand, and with a loud snapping noise, the ferret disappeared, leaving a rumpled looking Draco Malfoy on its place.
Neville gave him a nervous smile, making Harry feel a bit less guilty about his plan. He passed by Parkinson on his way to the front, the girl throwing him a nasty glare before planting herself beside Neville, who looked terrified
“Ah, there’s a trick,” said Draco, an amused grin growing on his lips. “Do tell, Granger."
“We barely talked, his mum was here too, and...” Harry looked at his friends. “She knows. I’m sure she knows.”
Hermione frowned. “But why?"
Ron chuckled. “Hermione is making a list of traits of your secret girlfriend. So far we only have
“And now Greg,” said Draco, turning to look at him. “He’s been convinced, and Lovegood is
“I do, but I’ve got Quidditch today."
“When isn’t it?” said Draco, leaving the book on the table next to him and looking at Harry with a serious expression. “So, what do we know?"
“Good,” said Angelina, then flying off.
“Are you sure?” asked Harry, surprised by how weak he sounded. He cleared his throat and looked at Sirius again. “That he’s not in danger, can you be sure of that?”
Ron nodded. “Sure, mate, just go.” He then pulled Ginny aside and Harry sped up the stairs to grab his cloak.
“Skeeter?!” shrieked Mrs Weasley.
Many people around the table shared uncomfortable glances.
creature."
“Not really,” shrugged Harry, receiving a dark look in answer. “I like you better when you talk."
“Gryffindors, Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, but no Slytherins,” mused Harry as they walked. “Shouldn’t we have invited some of them?"
Draco nodded, his eyes going a bit softer. “I know you won’t need luck, but...” he said, sounding a bit hesitant. He reached for Harry’s shirt wordlessly and Harry looked up at him, coming to find that the scarf really did bring out his eyes. There was a click and Harry looked down at his shirt, finding a small round object firmly pinned just below his heart. The constellation sparkled as if greeting him.
doing here?" asked Dean.
“Why are you so fixated with learning it, anyway?"
Harry caught him by the hand and spun him around. He couldn’t help but laugh at the others surprised expression, receiving a shove for his efforts. Harry refused to let go, and after struggling a bit, Draco let out a theatrical sigh and stilled. His pretty grey eyes studied Harry for a moment.
“Obviously.” Draco wiped the chocolate dust from his fingers on the cushion without looking at Harry, a faint blush appearing on his cheeks. “It’s tradition, after all."
"No," said Draco, his other hand searching for Harry's forearm. Then he sighed. "At least not while Dumbledore remains here. And I personally prefer his classes now that there is no risk of death."
Harry could only look at him. Malfoy had put himself together again, hair and uniform neatly in place, but he looked uncharacteristically defeated, and that made Harry even more guilty about not doing anything.
Again that four-letter word that made Harry glance away and scramble his brain for something else to say. “I just wanted to make sure you were alright. You shouldn’t be going through this, it’s my fault-” He was interrupted by a groan and looked back to find Draco giving him a bored look.
“Figure it out yourself since you are
As the class scurried to get ingredients, Draco, Zabini and Goyle joined them, taking the remaining seats on the table. The blond took the one opposite to Harry’s and flashed him a smile as he started measuring his ingredients.
Harry smiled. “I think we make a good team.”
Harry looked at Ron, the only one to blame here. “Hopefully."
Harry opened his mouth to say there was no need, but Sirius beat him to the punch. "I'm sure we can prepare some here, Molly," said the man with a sharp smile.
Harry recognized the dark hair and haughty Black features instantly. Regulus resembled his brother a lot, but he seemed to be of a much more serious nature, judging by the way he looked straight at the camera without smiling from his spot in the middle of the front row.
“Ah, dear Snuffles.” Fred nodded in approval and exchanged a quick glance with George, who nodded back. With that, Fred grinned at Harry. “Well, lucky for you, we might be able to help with that. We can make sure Umbridge stays away.”
“There,” he said to himself. It was his room now, and he allowed himself a moment to just stare and smile. He was stopped by a chirp that made him look at the corner of the room where Hedwig’s cage stood over a table. “You are liking the new place?” he asked.
Besides, it was very thrilling. It felt like a competition, not with each other but also the rest, and Harry realised just then that that was it. They were a team. They shared complicit looks and secret words in front of the unassuming rest. It was the two of them against Umbridge.
“Don’t bring James into this!” barked Sirius, slamming his hand on the table. “Do you know what he would say if he knew what his
Harry felt his smile falter. “Yeah, he is-”
. His heart sank when he reached the next section and his eyes snapped to the Slytherin table. Draco was nowhere to be seen. “Where is he?”
Draco you said hated you?"
“Oh, come on,” he said, looking sadly at his stained jumper, and usually Harry would have at least given him a grimace of sympathy, if he couldn’t find a napkin, but at that moment he was too busy trying to discern if what he had heard was real or just his mind messing with him as it had during the summer.
,” said Draco, sounding relieved. Then he bit his lower lip, that had wobbled a bit. Harry had seen him do that before and wasn’t surprised when it didn’t hold a second longer. The blond first lost the fight with the smile tugging at his lips and then broke into a laugh. “Because it was hilarious.”
“You were really close sometimes."
Two pillows were simultaneously thrown at his face.
Ron chewing became slower.
sure the Aurors are not snooping around his house anymore?”
Neville sighed dejectedly. "Hannah gave him some too."
Malfoy looks perplexed, the surprise making his mask falter and Harry sees again the fear he had glimpsed on the wolf’s moon eyes. And just like that Harry knows what to say. “Let me help you.”
Ron pulled a face. “Everyone knows, mate. It’s the
Lupin rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I really need to have a serious talk with you,” he said in a significant way that made Harry flush and turn towards Ron.
and watched in wonder as the liquid turned paler and paler.
Once time ran out, Slughorn checked on their cauldrons. He wasn’t impressed by the Slytherins, only giving Zabini a friendly pat and Draco’s cauldron a second glance before moving on. The Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs didn’t fare better. When he reached them, Slughorn ignored Ron’s black bubbling potion, gave Hermione an approving nod, and then finally looked at Harry. His eyes lit up.
“Yeah, Harry. What’s up with
“I think it was sweet,” said Luna.
Harry shook his head and turned around, stopping on his tracks when he found Lupin and Sirius looking at him.
“You know what, I take back what I said,” whispered Ron as they made way to the Gryffindor table. “We shouldn’t have let this happen, Hermione. My best friend is completely gone."
“How did you do it?” asked Hermione. “I knew she had a way to get information, but I-”
"Like Umbridge," said Harry, disappointed when that didn't manage to crack a smile out of Draco. He spoke to him softly, "Hagrid isn't going to put us in danger."
Well, hoped you liked the chapter, I'll see you on Monday!
Draco seemed to take Harry’s silence as acceptance. “I’ll see you later,” he said, taking three steps back before turning around. Harry let him walk away, watching quietly as he paused next to the poster of his aunt for a brief moment. He couldn’t see his expression, but he saw how Draco’s steps grew quicker on his way to the castle afterwards.
“Stay away, Potter,” she warned, before going after her friends.
“Yes?" he asked.
"His family-"
thought Harry as his hand closed around the struggling ball. Catching his breath, he looked at Draco, not sure of what he would find. His boyfriend's pale face was flushed, his blond hair in disarray and his silver eyes fixed on Harry with annoyment. “No hard feelings, right?” said Harry, then grinning as he stretched his arm upwards, showing the snitch as the crowd cheered and the final whistle was blown.
“What?” asked Harry, sitting up straighter. There were several things bothering him at the moment, and many were not possible to share with the blond.
“What if I had?”
... God, Harry missed him.
Dumbledore’s hand on his shoulder left, and another grabbed Harry by the arm, its owner dragging him away from the chaos and limping towards his office.
But he also wanted to take him in his arms, to pull his face into the crook of his shoulder and keep it there until the sadness left his silver eyes. So he just clenched his teeth and waited.
“But it’s not just
“Ah, so concerned with my well-being,” mused Draco, grinning at Harry as well. “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to get on her bad side. At least not now."
Harry followed him to the Owlery, keeping him company as he wrote and sent a letter for his mother, its contents unknown to him. “She wrote me early this morning,” said Draco as his eagle owl flew away. “She didn’t want me to find out from the papers.”
“The Quibbler?” shrieked Skeeter, calling Harry’s attention back to the conversation. “No one would believe it.”
"Oh, no, don't worry," said Harry quickly. Not only was the hat ridiculous, but if he went with that to the Gryffindor stands he would be sent to the Hospital Wing in a heartbeat, either out of concern or outrage. "But thank you for the offer."
“I guess." Harry grinned back. “And you changed your mind”.
As he stood just in front of the Cup next to Cedric, Harry noticed the loss of the comforting weight on his shirt. He looked down, and to his horror, the pin was gone. Before he could try summoning it, a hand was extended towards him, the pin resting safely on it.
“You do realise that this is the first Potions class after the holidays, right?” said Draco slowly, now frowning at him. “Unless you were somehow notified earlier, I doubt you have any Remedial Lessons."
The image of Lucius Malfoy wearing a farm hat popped in Harry’s head, making him snort and then bite his lip to repress a laugh. “Did they pick out the eyes of a guest or something?"
"He is just being a moron, alright?" said Parkinson. "It will pass. And I'm not letting Potter near him so he can ruin everything.” She took out a book, and tapped it with a hand. “This conversation is over."
Crabbe's eyebrows went up to his hairline and Parkinson let out an audible gasp and grasped on Goyle’s arms tighter, while said boy’s jaw fell slack. Harry could have almost laughed at their reactions, at how shocked they were at a simple word, a word that the Weasleys joked around with all the time.
Just as Ron had predicted, Slughorn didn’t show up until ten minutes before class. “Harry!” he said as he waddled over to unlock the door. “It will be a
“Yes, okay,” agreed Harry. “But are you sure you are alright? If there’s anything I can do-"
she had explained during a D.A meeting to an interested Goyle, who had been convinced and now read The Quibbler as gospel. The same magazine where Harry would accuse his father along with Crabbe’s and Draco’s.
“Not you,” she said dryly, earning some laughs from the room.
Hermione pursed her lips. “Well, the idea was very popular." She clapped, drawing the attention to herself. “Hello, uhm, we are here because-” She paused and took a deep breath, sounding more serious when she spoke again, “You all know why we are here. We are here because we need to learn Defense."
forget to add the salamander blood, alright?"
Draco’s eyes went wide. “What? Merlin, who-” He narrowed his eyes. “It was the cursed twins, right? That's why you are telling me this.”
It took a big effort for Harry to keep quiet instead of jumping at Draco’s defence. Only Ron and Hermione knew the truth, so Ginny and the twins had been extremely pissed when the news of what Draco had done reached their ears.
do not exist, could you do it?"
The hall outside of Snape’s classroom was lined with students, a bit unusual since the doors were usually open before class. Draco was talking with Crabbe and Goyle, the three of them visibly satisfied. They stopped their conversation when Harry, Ron and Hermione approached.
“Fine,” sighed Draco. “I’ll tell you later, so stop frowning,” he raised a finger to poke the crease between Harry’s eyebrows. “You will get lines."
actually bet ten minutes on you, and I do not like losing."
Luna’s eyes were covered by her pink Spectrespects, but her mouth fell open when she looked up at him. “Oh,” she let out in surprise. “Draco-”
Among the cries, there was a sudden mirthless laugh. Nott had finally freed himself from a stunned Crabbe. “Now you have done it, Draco.”
“That’s true,” conceded Hermione, then taking her time to take a bite of a scone. “But still, it would be better if you made your little exchanges shorter. I mean, I think even Draco was a bit surprised. Maybe just leave it at a couple of insults, no need to gaze at each other- Why are you looking at me like that?”
?" continued Hermione. "Didn't you fight against a
The air felt a bit heavier, and Harry stepped closer. "We don't have to use it," he said carefully.
So, after quite a while, Harry found himself skipping up the slippery stairs after lunch, humming to himself. Good mood not spoiled even after he almost slipped and became the first student to die from a broken neck. Hermione and Ron had offered to come with him, but Harry told them that he would be fast, having already written his letter to Sirius. It was securely placed on his unusually heavy bag.
Harry stuffed his things in his bag. “I have to talk to her. I’ll be quick.” He ignored his friends' protests and went after Parkinson, crossing the library as fast as he could. He caught up with her at the hall outside. "Parkinson!" he called as he approached. "Please, wait!"
“Laugh all you want,” said Harry. “I’d like to see
“I don’t know- I mean, no, nothing.” Harry shrugged him off and walked past him towards the living room. “Everything is fine, I was just hoping to get his reply to my last letter.”
Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes had to be the only establishment in Diagon Alley to have people excited to be there. The crowd was considerably younger as well, the number of students Harry actually recognized being higher. He managed to spot Colin and Dennis Creevey beside a tower of boxes, Parvati and Lavender near a pink fountain display, and even two very familiar faces.
“Not even Cho?” asked Hermione. “I thought you liked her.”
disappearing with the rest of the castle.
"No. I can't just do nothing and keep my head down while she is putting everyone at risk!"
Harry sighed. His plot to get here had worked perfectly but now he had no idea what to do. Still, he wasn't about to give up now, so he tried another angle. "So, Yule. I heard you are going with Parkinson."
He should be crying- bawling even, like he had embarrassingly done in front of his friends after he had fought with Draco two years ago, but right now all he could think about was that
“What's your problem?” asked Harry harshly.
“I don’t even know him,” said Harry. The only thing he remembered about the new Minister was that he was attempting to correct Fudge’s mistakes, which was a good place to start in his opinion, but Sirius didn’t seem to agree. “Is he that bad?”
“What do you want, Zabini?” grumbled Ron.
Parkinson followed behind, and the group only paused to give Draco the chance to glare at Neville until the boy took a step back in fear. Then Zabini kept directing them to the castle.
"What we're studyin' today is pretty rare," called Hagrid from the front. "I reckon I'm the only person in Britain who has managed to train 'em."
Parkinson groaned. “You are
jealous of you." Harry only looked at him, wondering if he should tell him that it wasn’t that great. Snakes never have much to say. "But right now I just find it
And then there's the second thing, which makes him feel bad about his long-time enemy. Lupin had once told him that sometimes children get bitten to punish their parents. Werewolves are under Voldemort's control at the moment, that much Harry knows, which means that after failing at the Ministry, Lucius Malfoy had to be punished.
And Draco wrapped his arms around his neck and melted with a whimper, letting him explore his mouth. His permission made Harry's blood rush, pooling into his stomach almost uncomfortably, and then Draco was pulling him closer and one of Harry's legs came to rest between his, moving up when their tongues met.
McGonagall consulted the parchment on her hands. “Potter… Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts,
“I really like you," blurted Harry.
“You are surely not planning to go,” stated a cold voice behind him.
“I’m sure you didn’t, Harry,” said Hermione softly. “Just tell us what happened”.
“Help me?” repeats Malfoy as if the word was foreign to him, and then there’s a ripple in the surface of his eyes, sudden and angry. “I don’t want your help-!” The blond cuts himself off with a wince when Harry squeezes just above his wrist.
"Uh, oh," said Ron.
Draco blinked at him, the tips of his ears turning pink. “Merlin, Harry, you really mean that, don’t you? You are so embarrassing,” he said, before shaking his head and giving him an amused grin. “Did you eat a Hufflepuff?”
" said Hermione.
Harry shrugged. "You know- the Tournament. Been thinking about it."
They both turned to look at him, making him freeze mid chewing a piece of his turkey sandwich. He gulped it down, glancing between their expectant looks.
strong words when she is angry.”
“Oh, I almost forgot!” Slughorn sounded excited now, the gravity of his voice gone. “Is anyone able to recognize what this is? Miss Granger perhaps?”
Perhaps Harry should start with that right then. He licked his lips and glanced towards his friends; Hermione’s eyes widened, as if having read his thoughts, and she shook her head, but Harry’s mind was already made up.
“Fainting, tears, tantrums…” continued Fred. He then snapped his fingers and smiled. “Which is why you might be interested in our
Harry drummed his fingers on the short stone wall by the entrance to Hogsmeade as he waited. Steps on the snow reached his ears, making him look up again to see a familiar group of Slytherins passing-by, throwing him amused looks.
"Starting tomorrow, every evening," mumbled Harry against his shoulder.
“You seem to have a connection of sorts with the Dark Lord, forged by the Killing Curse” continued Snape, eyeing him curiously. “Whenever your mind is vulnerable, for example when you are asleep, you have been sharing his emotions and thoughts-"
“What happened to you?” asked Harry in alarm.
Draco didn't say anything for a long moment, and then returned the look. "Harry, are you aware that we shouldn't be together anymore?"
Harry couldn’t remember her face, but he knew she was pretty, so Draco must take after her too.
“Sent the entire cavalry, I see,” he heard Sirius say. His godfather was giving the sleek black car parked in front of the house an amused look, which he then turned towards the woman in red robes standing by the open door. Sirius grinned and the woman jolted and quickly busied herself with storing Harry’s trunk.
“Why the long face, little bro?” said Fred, sitting down next to him.
Harry grinned at that. “There will be plenty of that."
"-bother me, then I will do the same."
Sirius laughed against the rim of his cup of wine. "You won't once you hear this; Snivellus is taking over as the Defense teacher."
Zacharias, who had perked up when Parkinson first mentioned his name, puffed his chest and proclaimed, "No, that's me. I'm Zacharias Smith." At that, the Slytherins exchanged a quick look.
Everyone knew Slytherins were cunning, clever and self-serving; all menacing concepts that made one think their steps twice around them. But something that hadn’t been noticed as much, and Harry now thought was most unsettling about a Slytherin, was the solid presence of another one next to them.
Harry shrugged. “I just really hate Dementors."
- start to tear apart the stairway to go through. With his heart racing faster than him, Harry had turned around a corner once, then again and again until he heard the howl, too close, and decided to hide instead of fleeing.
Before Luna could answer, the faint sound of steps approaching made them turn around. The rest were making their way towards them; Draco, Ron and Parkinson walking in front, while Hermione and Ginny kept a few steps behind, whispering at each other.
"Malfoy has the snitch!” exclaimed Lee, voice raised to not be drowned by the cheers of the Slytherin crowd and one Gryffindor, as Draco raised his gloved fist, showing the struggling wings. “That's one hundred eighty - fifty for Slytherin! They have won! And I owe several people galleons now..."
, but I understand.” Draco pursed his lips and dropped his hand. “I’m, however, not very pleased with you about all,” he waved his hand at the cave. “
Harry frowned. “It wouldn’t be damaging for me at all, it’s him I’m worried about.”
“You can’t tell me,” repeated Draco, sounding a little too neutral. He seemed to ponder on the words, as if not understanding what they meant, before finally blinking in realisation. “Yes, of course, you can’t tell me."
It appeared that the harshness of his tone had startled not only Harry, because Draco flinched too, lips twisting in a grimace. “I’m sorry,” said Draco, and now that he spoke again Harry could see how off his voice had been before. “I’m alright. I apologize for not writing.”
Despite all that, when he started hearing noises downstairs, well after the Dursleys had left town for some dumb event, Harry pocketed it quickly.
Across the small table of their compartment, Ron groaned.
“Oh, it’s you,” said Dudley. He and his gang were sneering at Harry, but they didn’t wear it nearly as well as the Slytherins and that amused him. Dudley smirked, “What is that? A letter from your
One look at the first question was enough to tell that the exam would be as boring as the class itself. Already starting to feel sleepy, Harry rubbed his eyes and read the question again. Despite Hermione’s notes and the hours he had studied along with Draco, it was a bit hard to remember so many dates and names.
Harry scrunched his nose. “I have no idea."
It was as dull as Draco had said, and Harry couldn’t even get past the second page without his eyes dropping. He looked around the classroom after a while, finding Hermione’s hand firmly raised and many students looking at her in surprise.
“Those, yeah.” Dudley’s face scrunched up. “It was awful, really. Very cold, worse than winter, and as if it would never be warm again.” He fell quiet for a moment, looking thoughtful. "I dream about it sometimes."
to make you feel better."
After lunch, Harry walked into the library and towards a specific section, only pausing to fold and pocket the map. The library was usually empty at that time, most of the students hanging out in the grounds before classes started. He found Draco almost near the back of the library, where the books were dustier and the tables emptier, leaning against a shelf as he skimmed through a book with a focused expression.
Luckily just in time for him to avoid getting his robes soaked in the pumpkin juice that Ron, who was sitting behind him on a couch, ungracefully spat out of his mouth. Neville wasn’t as lucky.
“But why?"
And he had come to some conclusions. First of all, he was completely sure that Draco’s handwriting was slightly messier than usual - Harry had even compared it with previous letters. And second of all, he had no idea what the message meant.
tell them something, you know."
Harry grimaced. “Sorry. I figured I would show you something this time.” At Malfoy’s raised eyebrow, he added: “Since last time you showed me the badge.”
Hermione didn't look up from her book. “Arithmancy."
“Professor, what about this one?” said Ernie.
said nothing at all, instead trying to complete the idea, “And I’m guessing these are not good things.”
“You are good at Potions, right?”
Harry’s mouth opened and closed, knowing he had been caught. He couldn’t deny wanting to go with Sirius, even if just to watch his back, because Hermione and Ron were looking at him sternly too, definitely having caught on his line of thought.
It seemed as if the Room had gone several times colder, coming from the Slytherin side. Crabbe, Zabini and Parkinson glared daggers at Ernie until he took a step back, but Goyle only frowned. "What does that mean?" he asked, sounding genuinely lost.
Neville took pity on him and offered to help since he only needed a pocket to carry Trevor. Together, they carried everything out the train and towards the designated area. After that, carrying the cages became quite easier, especially since both owls were very serene. As they walked towards the carriages, Harry noticed the absence of a certain Groundskeeper.
“I know who he is,” cut in Draco. “What I don’t know is what a
"It's nothing."
proud,” grinned the blond.
A bark-like laugh was the only warning before there was an arm around his shoulders. “Talking like a captain already. Good!” Sirius grinned at him. “Godric, Harry, you are Team Captain, the Chosen One and have grown a foot over summer; my cousin is gonna
Her sudden arrival had made Ron jump a bit on his seat. “Yeah, but-"
“He did this to you, didn’t he? Voldemort,” says Harry, a spark of anger making him take a step forward when Malfoy winces at the name. “He did this to you to punish your father because of his failure-”
Despite being the same Potions classroom as always, it now looked brighter,
“I will,” promised Harry, smiling up at the blond. “I should have brought the badge you made too.”
meant to ask Harry, but at that moment he caught view of Draco standing just by the stone wall and talking with Parkinson and Luna.
by a dragon." Harry snorted. "It's kinda funny, isn't it?"
There was a loud laugh coming from the stands, and Harry didn’t have to look to know it was Parkinson. He still did and saw Draco trying not to laugh, while Parkinson was doubled over from laughter and Zabini snickered discreetly behind a hand. “Good catch, Harry!” called Luna and Parkinson laughed even louder.
was wrong.
"Well, if it isn’t the Champion of Hogwarts," said Malfoy in his posh and infuriating voice.
"You do know I'm playing your house, right?"
“Exactly, like a play.” Harry nodded. “The only difference is that there are no actors present, and they can repeat it again and again. And they turn off the lights.”
“But those are supposed to bring misfortune!” said Lavender. “That’s what professor Trelawney said!"
better be used to it, right?"
Harry grinned at that and tugged Draco along to follow the rest of the class. The forest was dark, even during the day, the distant sounds ambiguous enough to add to the unsettling atmosphere that ensured that Draco was not the only pale-looking student.
Ron turned towards Hermione. “I told you they were evil.”
Offering protection would make Malfoy snap at him because, even when he has been reduced to what he has always despised, Harry can see a sliver of pride in his stormy eyes, one that is different and only shows up for
“That’s what I expect, yes,” said Draco, accepting the hand Harry offered him with a pleased smile. “No less than plenty."
Slughorn left mumbling to himself, and Harry looked at the vial again, feeling more reluctant to use it now. Sure, he could take it and get back with Draco, but he wouldn’t be sure if it was
“I’m also here, mom” huffed Ron.
“Constant Vigilance!” yelled Tonks, hitting her tankard on the table and then breaking into a laugh. “Oh, I don’t know, Mad-Eye, I think it’s
"Why not? I was shit to you. I realized that then, that you had no reason to help me at all."
Ron frowned at that. “Know what?"
Harry exchanged a look with Hermione. “I have to go see him,” he said and she nodded in agreement. “Please tell Ron about Hagrid, I’ll be back soon.”
Harry shrugged. “I already did my homework. Plus, I didn’t understand a thing you two were saying."
Ron almost spilt his drink. “Hermione!” he said after gulping it down. “Isn’t it a tad too early to pillage the library?”
His cousin nodded dumbly before giving Harry another odd look. “You saved me from the demential things.”
Parvati looked away. "Well, if she's alright with it," she mumbled, while Lavender just nodded.
He quickly noticed a familiar name, connected to Narcissa Black by a pretty golden line.
The three of them moved along, pretending not to see the students staring at Harry with wide eyes as they walked past their compartments. They found an empty one near the middle of the train, and Harry had just sat down when the door opened again, interrupting Neville’s enthusiastic retelling of his summer.
“Something wrong?"
“You are staring."
Sirius, as expected, didn’t buy it as quickly. “Oh, really?” he said viciously. “So what is dear Draco doing to help?”
Parkinson shrugged and flashed her a grin. “I’ll just deduct them from Potter, then."
He must have been furious and wrote to Harry to say so, or perhaps even worse, he had written Harry to let him know it was over. Not wanting to confirm either, Harry kept staring at it from his bed without opening it.
"Goodnight, Scarhead," said Draco softly, and his lips parted in a grin. "I'm rather fond of you too," he said, not bothering to hear Harry's answer before walking down the stairs in his usual aristocratic way.
It was the sight of the door opening that made Harry snap out of it. His fingers dove in and closed around Draco’s wrist, but Draco jolted and wrenched his hand away immediately.
thought Harry, chasing the other's lips as they retreated and closing the distance again, catching them as they opened in surprise. Placing a hand on the shelf behind Draco, Harry leaned closer and parted his lips, feeling his head go light with the warm breath the other let out. The hands on his shoulders loosened their grip as the kiss deepened, a small pleased sound leaving the other. Harry brought him closer, marvelling at how his waist seemed to fit perfectly under his hand, losing himself to the heat of his mouth and only breaking apart when the lack of air was too much.
Crabbe nodded. “We are thinking about going to Honeydukes," he raised a stubby hand to scratch his chin in a thoughtful manner, "but there’s also that tea shop that sells pastries."
thought Harry very maturely, but he was worried about the blond's bad mood. The last time he had seen him brood was after Moody’s incident.
“She’s in Azkaban,” continued Sirius. “Went in with her husband and Barty Crouch."
Draco grinned back. "Strong as usual. And his aim is quite good too."
Not much later, the classroom door opened again, and Umbridge and Draco walked out, the latter wearing his most charming smile as he listened to the woman chatter on. He had promised Harry to buy him some time by making the woman arrive late for dinner, but also told him that he shouldn’t take too long to catch up.
“Good afternoon,” greeted the boy politely. He smiled at the Ravenclaw girl. “I was wondering if you would do me the honour of attending the Yule Ball with me."
the one that applied to everything around him.
“Of course you did, you saint,” sighed Draco, leaving his quill aside and rolling up his parchment. He looked at Harry and smiled. “Unless you are planning to search for inspiration for your dream-diary, I suggest we get going. It’s getting late."
He leaned against Harry and remained quiet, taking one of Harry’s hands between his.
Draco raised his eyebrows. "So is it, or is it not?"
,” said Sirius in a mimic of a grave voice that made Remus huff in amusement, only prompting him into going on, “
"Yes," answered Harry. "And the impediment jinx. Just reviewing everything before we leave."
“Yes.” Draco grinned at him, brightly even in the dim light of the cupboard, and Harry found himself grinning back as he had wanted to do all day. Which reminded him of the reason he couldn’t have taken a second longer.
“See you,” said Harry, watching him walk away gracefully. He then turned to his friends, snorting when he found them frowning. “You do know he is just messing with you, right?"
On the first meeting they had, the boy had commented quite loudly how
Harry didn’t comment on that. Instead, he sat down by the wall and took out his Potions essay, a quill, and the small bottle of ink. They fell back to their usual silence, Harry scribbling down what little he knew and Malfoy doing whatever he was doing.
g) other (please specify)
But Malfoy didn't look judgmental, just curious. Curious and a little tentative.
"You can always wait to sober up and Floo home. The place is muggle but the fire's not."
"Well that all depends on Draco," Harry answered. "Technically, I'm not an Auror anymore, so I couldn't arrest her even if I wanted to."
Malfoy huffed but he seemed almost pleased. The DNA analysis was done.
a) The Chudley Cannons
Two men noticed Harry staring at them and smiled. He nodded at them and pushed through the dancing people to get to the Bar. If he was looking for Malfoy, this was where he'd find him.
He kept examining them and then popped one into the player.
That was how they ended up getting samples of every ice cream flavour and letting Teddy test them with his eyes closed. Malfoy ended up admitting that the flavours were all different even if they were unnecessary and got a chocolate. Teddy settled on Banana and Harry spent a full minute debating between caramel drip and chocolate before Malfoy said, "if you're that torn up about it, get the caramel and then you can have some of mine."
"Oh. Stuff for Wheezes." He waved a hand vaguely, willing himself to focus on the present. It didn't work. He replayed the moment over in his head. "A plan for the reopening and a couple of potential products we've thought about introducing."
"Sure, the list?"
"You've talked to Malfoy?"
"All?"
Malfoy glared and Harry threw his hands up in surrender. It was a joke! Maybe he was being insensitive. The man was dead, after all.
"You're joking."
"I couldn't keeping looking at her like that," he said.
"What the fuck are you doing."
"Just thinking about all the work I'll have to do on the office to get to some of Fred and George's ideas is making me nauseous."
"Fuck, Harry-" Malfoy choked out, and that was it for him. Harry felt his orgasm rip through his body faster than it had since he was a teenager. He groaned against Malfoy who was coming too and pulled him into another kiss that started out hungry and ended slowly with them just breathing the same air. Harry pressed one more kiss to the side of his jaw before collapsing on top of him.
"Yeah.. maybe. Look, I'm knackered." He stood up and stumbled before Harry grabbed him so he wouldn't crash. "I'm just gonna apparate home."
As Lee ran through the pitch stark naked—Ginny laughing madly and Ron wolf-whistling—Harry and Malfoy sat in silence, the space between them feeling a lot bigger than it had the night before. There was something about him that always made Harry feel as if he were talking to a stranger. It took Malfoy a while to warm up every time they spoke, like they had to start over from scratch.
She didn't say or do anything else and he took that as his cue to leave.
They didn't speak for a long moment.
"Solid orange?" she had asked repeatedly.
"Stop, you'll make me blush," he deadpanned, taking another sip of his drink. Harry studied the way his throat bobbed, shaking himself out of his reverie when Malfoy raised a brow at him. Merlin, he was drunk.
Ginny pushed his feet off her coffee table and sat down in the chair across from him. He put his feet back up just to annoy her. It'd been a while since they'd last saw each other, but despite his worries, nothing had changed.
Harry thought of fire and Malfoy's long arms thrown around Goyle's unconscious body. He thought of smoke, the feeling of coughing it up, and Malfoy's face as he screamed Crabbe's name outside the Room of Requirement. It was hard to imagine the Slytherins living like Harry and his friends did, but being so distant from one another seemed wrong too. They were bonded in the same way the Gryffindors had been, right?
My wand core is made of
"Did any of them send photos?"
"You're sure they won't mind?"
"So you hire someone. Actually, let me rethink that, seeing as hiring professionals is against your delicate sensibilities."
"No need. You know what kind of place this is?"
Malfoy cut his eyes over to Harry, taking him in.
"Voldemort was an orphan, and so was I." No one looked pleased with this comparison. "I had an advantage he didn't, though. I was able to make my own family with the help of Hogwarts. There are more orphans in school now than there ever were before, and Adolescents are some of the most prone to depression." Here he started on the medical side of things and relaxed into his role. The audience applauded again when he finished and he was glad to get off the stage.
"There has to be some sort of questionnaire people fill out or something to determine who needs the most help, how much good each place is doing, what the facilities are like, and to weed out people who just want the money, that sort of thing," she continued.
He caught up to Malfoy just one street away from the apparating point, grabbing his arm.
Harry perked up at that, listening closely.
His chest actually clenched, begging him to do something. Ginny wouldn't meet his eyes, and he knew she was probably struggling to hold on.
Which just left Malfoy.
"I... apologise for my reaction last night."
He agreed to go to a function he'd been putting off RSVPing to for months now, the Auror's Annual March Ball, and invited Alicia to go with him. Now he had a date and he just had to learn to dance. In 10 days.
"Definitely not walking." He grabbed his arm. "Number 12, Grimmauld Place."
Harry pushed his hand further down Malfoy's body until he reached his trousers and then he stopped, waiting for him to say something.
e) Sex
a) Going to the Gym
That seemed to be the agreement they reached and Harry nodded to Alicia. "Us too."
Malfoy grabbed Harry's hands and began jumping. Harry started laughing and let himself be pulled along as people joined in. Malfoy's head bobbed to the beat and though his face was red from exertion, his smile seemed to glow.
Ten minutes later she lead him up to the stage and the crowd broke out into applause. He tried not to hide his face from them or let his smile falter because that would mean an excerpt in the paper the next day about the 'Blushing Boy Who Lived.'
"Harry's getting married," Ron answered.
"I promise you it will."
They stood in horribly polite silence for only a moment before Harry decided he couldn't stand it and asked Verity if she would show them to Fred and George's office.
He walked over to where Harry was sat and, after a long moment's hesitation, eased himself up onto the table beside him.
Without looking at their profiles? Ron was setting him up for failure.
As for the first part, Harry now knew he was gay. He'd said it out loud to himself for the first time the night before, just to see how it felt. It was terrifying, but terrifyingly right. He'd never felt like this about anyone before and he didn't figure he ever would again.
Harry laughed as Malfoy clicked off.
"Guess he won't miss out on the seventy-two virgins then, huh?"
"Don't be so hard on yourself. Patronuses are all about conjuring something from your happiness. They won't work if you aren't focused on that."
"You can go now, Kreacher," Harry said, and he disappeared again without a word.
It was purposeful, then. At least, a bit. The point hadn't been to turn an entire room into an unnavigable nightmare, but they had wanted orange stuff. In some form or fashion. Which was still very unclear.
Harry sighed and Ron let their arms drop.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "He has it out for me. Perhaps for you, too. Or maybe he just likes to see people suffer, there's really no way to be certain."
"Er..."
"Er," said Malfoy.
a) A packet or more per day
"We can talk while we watch the kids."
"If you really want to make good on that bet — " Lee sat back down — "I'm gonna need some basic assurance."
"Is miss Lovegood being needing something?"
"Ah. Mr. Potter, can I be quite clear with you?"
Malfoy shrugged, but Harry got the feeling that he actually had a lot to say on the topic.
"But she did it anyway?"
Harry nodded and started toward the kitchen, telling Malfoy to make himself comfortable. He was feeling more than a little bit out of his depth, but after defeating the worst wizard of their time, surely he could handle Draco Malfoy sitting in his house.
"Yeah, best to keep you on your toes." Ginny grinned at him, wiggling her eyebrows, and as much as he kind of wanted to strangle her, he was also glad to see a little bit of her old spark back. He hadn't seen her eyes shine like that for at least a year now.
"Oh." It sounded mocking coming out of his mouth.
"Are you attracted to me?"
Narcissa stood and he was lead out. Draco had been sitting outside the front door, smoking anxiously.
When he'd imagined Malfoy working at a bar, he'd thought it'd be some sort of posh bar that only served cocktails and had velvet seating in every corner. He couldn't spot him anywhere. The entire place was crowded with guys, only guys, actually and he could barely tell left from right.
When he finished work later that day, he wasn't any more enthused about giving a speech, but at least he no longer had to face the trials of getting up.
"Okay."
The creak of her voice carried across the room effortlessly, though he hadn't seen her use a sonorus. "This is a hearing to determine if Harry J. Potter—financier of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and henceforth referred to as the debtor—will be allowed an attempt at salvaging the reputation of said business after and as soon as the appropriate sum of 150 Galleons has been paid to the order of Gringotts Wizarding Bank. Mr Potter, your statement, if you will."
"Hey, wait. Come on, Malfoy! I'm talking to you!"
"We could help if you want," said Neville.
"I heard about Thalia. Please, you know I care for her."
Harry jabbed him with his elbow. "Prat. Learn to take a fucking compliment."
As Malfoy was speaking to the guys, a man in a chef's hat came out and talked briefly with him and Blazer guy. They were allowed to leave without any problems as long as Harry would release the men. He did and got up, walking away as quickly as possible to avoid the crowds and putting up his Glamour again.
"What was wrong with her?"
"I'm having fun. I'm enjoying hanging out with Malfoy."
Neville was sitting on the floor, letting Luna braid scraps of parchment into his hair. She'd spelled it long so it flowed all the way past his shoulders.
Harry swallowed heavily and nodded. "Thank you."
"Potter, any woman, or man for that matter, who would apply to date you is out of their bloody mind and doesn't see themselves as anything more than a future Mrs. Potter. I'm frankly insulted you think I'd lower myself to that kind of thing."
"Do you ever clean?"
• • •
"Right. There's always that."
The street was mostly empty this time of day, but one young child and his mother stared as they walked past, making Harry feel exposed.
"What are you lot doing here?"
"What?"
"There's got to be something else we could come up with." Harry's patience was wearing thin, and he had started to feel hopeless.
"Could we at least try?" the little boy from before asked.
The woman stopped him with a hand on his shoulder and he looked down. In his palm was a candy wrapper.
"Christ, Malfoy, no need to act too happy to see me."
"Fuck," Harry breathed.
"Ah well, what do you know? Maybe you could take a look at my tap in the basement? I think somethings wrong with the washer."
"Did you study there?" Harry asked.
As much as Harry wanted to protest, he didn't. It was easier to just quit while he was ahead. Or while he wasn't as far behind as he might've been. He had the feeling that he'd royally screwed things up that evening, even if he didn't know exactly how.
Malfoy walked into the kitchen just as the kettle started to whistle and interrupt his reading.
The rest of the night was enough to distract him. All of his friends came up to laugh with him about his dance with Malfoy and the press squeezed in at every opportunity to try to take pictures. At some point, Jerome left, though Harry didn't pay much attention. Ron had grabbed a new bottle of wine from the bar and they all took turns passing it around and taking swigs, even though Hermione considered it poor manners. He and Malfoy danced again and then every witch there pulled him in for some poorly executed but overall not-terrible dances.
"Oh. Thank you, Potter, but I don't drink coffee."
"Walk me to the apparition point?" he asked.
"Me neither. They're always too loud."
"That'll have to work."
"Yes?"
"I pay this month's mortgage."
"You could issue an appeal..."
"You were always rubbish at potions. Snape was five seconds from quitting every time you entered the classroom."
"We could always get married."
The next day, Ron cornered him in his office and wouldn't let him leave until they'd 'talked it all over.'
The look on Ron's face didn't change and Harry nearly screamed in frustration. "I'm not! Just because I can't find a wife doesn't mean I want to bugger Malfoy!"
Harry turned over in bed and fumbled for his glasses.
Malfoy took to the stairs, and Harry and Verity chased after him.
"Sounds like you've been seeing Malfoy. Hate to say I told you so but I was the one that set you up."
"You were supposed to be perfect. You're Harry Potter. I thought you'd be the one guy to-"
Harry hid a laugh behind his hand, clapping as Wadcock got the quaffle past the Bat's keeper.
Harry didn't know. Maybe he'd grown up. In any case, they didn't go back to the restaurant and the bill remained unpaid. Maybe he'd mail them a cheque. He probably wouldn't.
Harry walked back over to the couch and was pleased to see there was still Firewhiskey left in the bottle. He took a swig. Barkley ran in from the kitchen and jumped up on the couch.
"Sorry, Mr. Potter, we have a no Glamour policy."
Harry gagged exaggeratedly and then joined in with Ron's laughter.
Ginny just blinked at her, and then she called, "Ron, your people are here."
He continued going through the questionnaire and threw out a few things but eventually settled on 25 questions, all but two multiple choice.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and put one up as well and they made their way through the heart of muggle London without speaking.
In his opinion, Hermione had put it pretty well.
They were out to lunch but Ron wasn't buying his innocent act. He gestured for Harry to show him what he had. Harry grabbed the box he'd been keeping hidden in his pocket and unshrunk it, allowing the contents to nearly spill off the table.
"You have to understand, I'm more well known than I'd like at times. I'm likely to get mobbed if I take this off."
He looked at Harry for a moment with raised eyebrows. "Potter, I haven't the faintest idea what problem you're talking about."
c) Very little to no Harry Potter Paraphernalia
"No, never. I was always more of a customer than anything."
"I don't think it's any of those things for me," a boy said. Harry was pretty sure his name was Quentin.
Harry tried to pat her awkwardly on the shoulder but she shoved him away.
Malfoy's throat worked, his eyes flashing.
Harry couldn't. "What are you gonna do when you find out who did it?"
"You're never gonna get it to explode right like this," Seamus said, leaning in over Dean's shoulder.
"No, no. All this means is that they share some genes with you. Could be anywhere from an aunt to a third cousin by the looks of it."
b) Walking
When an hour had passed and they were both pleasantly tipsy as well as fully drunk on laughter, she leaned in to kiss him.
"Of course, Amber." She beamed at him and he noticed her dwindling glass. This could be a perfect opportunity. "Could I refresh your drink for you?"
"We were getting along. You didn't have to go and get all dopey-eyed over my cousin."
"You have any preference?" Harry hadn't let himself starting comparing yet.
The lab was clean and empty when they snuck in and Harry felt confident enough to turn on the lights. The fluorescents made Malfoy look paler than usual and he seemed nervous too. That part probably had more to do with the morally questionable activities and being in the presence of his Father's killer's DNA than the lighting, though.
Harry woke up at just past 7. He had decided not to tell Malfoy about the conversation with Finnley Shaw yet, or about the picture of a young Mr. Shaw waving right next to a stonefaced Lucius Malfoy and a grinning Protheus Longbottom that must have been taken before Harry and Malfoy were even first years.
"Which is?"
He got to the Burrow just in time for dinner that night and he set down Mr. and Mrs. Weasley to tell them what would be appearing in the papers the next day. Mrs. Weasley held his hand and cried, not because she was sad or regretted him not being able to marry Ginny, but because he'd told her just like she was his mum. Mr. Weasley hugged him and told him they could go to a muggle gay club together if he liked because he'd always wanted to go to one. Harry was torn between not wanting to and really really wanting to see what Mr. Weasley thought gay muggles dressed like. In the end, he decided to take a rain check. He told himself again and again how worthwhile this would all be, even if Draco still wouldn't forgive him. He wasn't sure how much he believed it.
Harry shook his head.
"So what, you would have wanted to be my boyfriend then?"
e) other (please specify)
Harry scrambled to his feet.
"Potter, we've talked about this before, it isn't nice to discriminate."
Malfoy spun around angrily. "No!" He jerked his arm away. "I refuse to put up with this. Either I mark your shop as failing and it closes, or you learn to be a goddamn adult!"
"Erm hi, it's Draco Malfoy and," he hesitated, "Doug Harper here to see you."
"It's a pigsty. I'm surprised Granger even lets you step foot in the place."
Harry sighed. "How long has it been there?"
"If you were me?"
"You..." Harry's throat caught and he cleared it again, forcefully. "Right, then."
Harry spent the rest of the night watching Malfoy smile at him and Teddy looked at Malfoy pityingly before glaring at Harry. What in the hell was going on? Was this some kind of hatred born from him being Teddy's guardian now instead of Andromeda? Fuck, he was not ready to raise a teenager. Would it be so bad if he ended up with Malfoy? Surely the Wizarding world would go insane, but Teddy's two main guardians being together couldn't be terrible. Unless the broke it off. Fuck, what if they broke it off?
Unfortunately, that was the moment when Malfoy arrived.
Harry was convinced he might. Another guy arrived and tried to pull him off but the man below him was growling like he'd kill Harry the second he could, so Harry had no choice but to knock the other one to the ground as well using a little creative wandless magic and a lot of upper arm strength.
Harry owled Ron the second he got home.
"Expecto Patronum," he whispered and the stag erupted from his wand, galloping once around the kids and then dissipating.
"You know just... your fascination with Malfoy could also be looked at as..." Ron gestured but that didn't help.
"Because your overwhelming sense of hope is stifling. I can feel it from here."
People in the audience (see: the press) had not been happy to hear him "Attempt to Humanise the Darkest Wizard of All Time," as they'd put it.
"Obviously."
Luna looked concerned. "Doesn't Harry get any people?" she asked. "I wouldn't want him to feel left out.
Daphne exhaled shakily and looked to the side, blinking away tears Harry hadn't seen develop.
"You're both ridiculous. The game starts at 8, so you'd better be ready to watch your hopes and dreams die before we leave at 7."
At the end of the night, the slow songs started up and he and Malfoy smiled at each other across the table but didn't move to the dance floor. Malfoy was a flawless dancer, of course, but there was no reason for them to dance to a song like this.
"Oh. Er... would you want to go for a pint with us after this? Now, I mean."
"Uh no, you were about to see me die to avoid a possible murderer knowing we did get a DNA sample."
"I'm swamped at work and Ron is too so we needed to find a time to meet about The Project."
"That's Potter, a real gentleman."
"So then we would be..."
"He said that on the night of the murder you were feeling ill and so you stayed home. He said that you still blame yourself for not being there to stop it, even though he'd rather have just one dead parent than two. He also said that the only way for you both to feel safe would be the killer being found and locked away."
He felt obligated to do his best.
He smiled grimly at a lady who gasped as he went by. It had been a long time since Harry had practiced any sort of climbing in his Auror training. The wall was more slippery than he would have liked and at one point his bootlace caught on the brick and he slipped, only just managing to grasp hold again. He heard shouts from below him and then felt the magic of a levitation charm warm his body.
"You know, Mr. Potter. We'd value someone with your teaching skills at Hogwarts."
"Work, I suppose. The ministry wants to close Wheezes. If I'm to save it, I need products, and this is," he gestured vaguely, "well it's what I've got so far."
"Oi! Is that you, Potter?"
"To who?"
It was almost noon before he saw anyone else. Verity marched up to him and dragged him into the hallway, and he didn't put up much protest. By that point, Harry had taken off his robes and was sweating through his shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows and glasses fogging from the exertion.
Malfoy frowned. "Excuse me?"
Harry and Malfoy made eye contact and he smirked. "Potter, you know everyone else but allow me to introduce Jerome." The man Malfoy was referring to was sitting next to him and smiling brightly. He seemed younger than the rest of them, probably in his early 20s and Harry immediately didn't like him. He wasn't one to take his hunches for granted, but he wasn't about to be rude either. He stuck out his hand for Jerome to shake.
"I can see how you got there but he's not really my type."
"I'm just saying. If I were you, I'd want to try it out."
"You know, I'd thought maybe Harry Potter of all people wouldn't care about a thing like this."
"Let the record show that I have done absolutely nothing deserving of your torture."
"We regret to inform you that Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes has missed its latest mortgage payment," Ron repeated blandly. "You have until October 1st, 1999, to complete the payment, or the property will be forfeited—"
When Harry called Hermione that evening, she was surprised to hear from him, but grateful for the distraction.
"And you as well. You've got yourself a nice young man here, Mr. Malfoy."
"Er, no. That's... okay. I get it. You were close with your parents, then?"
"It's been an hour."
"I haven't really noticed," he told the most beautiful man in the world.
"Stop."
"Headmistress," the fourth-year girl corrected him.
"Thunderstorms!"
f) Portkey
"Harry?"
"Disgusting," Malfoy said, and hugged him again, this time slapping him afterwards.
He met Malfoy outside a block from the restaurant and found he had already hailed a cab. He pulled Harry inside and told the driver to go towards the center of London. Harry knew they were headed to the ministry.
"I'm able to resist an imperius."
"I'm serious, Gin! I'm gonna be alone forever."
"Burban Shafiq did not kill your father."
"Yeah, Ginny loves them. I just didn't peg you for a fan is all."
"Well it was a misunderstanding at first and I thought it'd be funny to watch you put your foot in your mouth a bit. Then, Hermione kept saying how much fun you two were having. I thought maybe there was something you weren't telling us about why it was so hard for you to find a wife."
The bathroom was a mess when he went inside it and he wondered what the elf even did besides bring coffee. Not that Kreacher had done much cleaning before Harry'd sent him off to Hogwarts at his request. Maybe some elves were just like that. The floor was absolutely covered in used tissues and Harry stepped carefully around them.
Astoria stepped in front of them, her long legs demanding attention as she hooked one ankle through the railing behind her. "There's a better place just off Holborn that we could go to," she cut her eyes to Malfoy, "muggle. Not far from an apparition point."
It wasn't said like a question, but Harry answered anyway.
"Nothing. She's just... really nice."
Malfoy nodded and Teddy didn't say anything. His face was fixed in a scowl but his eyes showed how he really felt.
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes,"  they shouted together, unheard by anyone but themselves over the music.
"What's the project?" Rose asked.
Malfoy met his eyes again and Harry lost his train of thought for a second, stuck on the way he was finally close enough to see the pale blond of his eyelashes. Harry'd been this close before, hadn't he? Probably focused on other things, though, like how many punches he could throw before Filch came to break them up.
Draco laughed and flipped over so he was facing Harry then scooted down so he could lie with his head on his chest.
Yeah, just look in her eyes
"You're going to kill each other, aren't you?"
"Really?" This was news to Harry.
The Pygmy puff gave an annoyed little yawn and turned away from him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Alright, Harry. Just let me dry my hair, I'll be down in a moment."
And then Harry was kissing him. He wound his fingers in Malfoy's stupid hair and tugged it until he groaned. He slotted his legs between his thighs and pushed him back towards the couch.
Harry got to Cuppa Joe the next day at 2:10 and he was already waiting. Harry had intended to get the crime scene files from storage to retrieve the DNA himself, but Malfoy insisted there were in this together. With only sixteen minutes to discuss the problem (leaving him four minutes to sprint to the Ministry for a meeting), he didn't have much time to argue. They agreed that the simplest solution was for Harry to get the files out of the Ministry vaults of cold cases and then to work together from there. Malfoy would wait in his office for him to get back.
Harry sighed. That would be a lot harder than Malfoy was making it sound.
"I'll go see what's taking so long."
Ron laughed and flipped through a few more.
"We haven't kept up with the payments," Ginny murmured, sitting at the other end of the kitchen table and staring determinedly at her tea. "Most of the money they made went to their... funerals. And some of it went to the War Orphans Trust Fund. Anyway, there's not much left now, and I don't think we even remembered."
"They don't hate you," Harry said.
"Fuck you! You know I do! I can't help you do something immoral."
They headed to a less crowded street and apparated back to the hotel. Malfoy told him on the way about how Patricia had thought he was working undercover with a death eater operation to recruit her and failing that, steal her DNA to use for a crime scene setup. She also thought he had imperiused Harry.
They walked for a few minutes more before Malfoy said, "I'm famished, we should find some food."
"And you've no idea what caused it?" Malfoy asked.
"You look so much like your father," Mr. Shaw said to Malfoy. "He was so ambitious when he was your age. Your mother always knew how to keep him in line, though."
Harry was about to retort when Malfoy spoke again, apparently not needing an answer. "Is this camomile?"
"Oh, I'm a uh... handyman. For magical appliances."
"I take it you didn't tell him about the shop. Or about talking to me, apparently."
"Ooh," said Luna. "What's the Nipple Twister idea?"
He turned without saying anything else and Harry stared blankly after him before Zabini patted his shoulder and pushed him forward.
"I'm a pureblood, Potter. Practically the entire wizarding world is my third cousin. Hell, you're probably my third cousin."
"It was just a suggestion."
They were treading uncomfortable territory now. In all their time since the war, they'd never talked about it in more than passing. "You mean like your house arrest or not being able to get a job? I allocated for you, I tried."
"Sure you are."
"Oh, shut it," Harry said. "All of you."
The room was large, bigger than he'd been expecting. It was lined with magic-proof wood panelling and fibreglass, and it had about a dozen machines that did Merlin-knows-what spread out in two long lines.
"Oh, there's a good boy." He collapsed on Harry's legs and closed his eyes. Harry reached for his cell before accioing it when it was too far. He called Ron. Hermione answered instead and she sounded groggy.
Malfoy said no. He wanted to gather the other sample first so they could compare them at the same time. It didn't make logical sense, but Harry could understand where he was coming from.
The pub Astoria had chosen was loud when they arrived. Not just normal levels of loud, either, but the kind that made you want to find a secluded corner somewhere way off so that you could finally breathe a little bit.
She rolled her eyes. "No, Harry, you're not that bad. But Ron has nothing to worry about."
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "What's the incantation?"
"Gin," said Ron, his voice lacking any feeling. "It's really not worth it."
Hermione held up a hand. "I'm not bothered. At least one of us has to be mature about this whole thing, and it won't be Ron. If it was me there with him, I'd probably do whatever it took to get him to shut up too."
Malfoy sighed. "I should probably go. I can't really remain impartial if we talk about your shop while I'm off-duty."
"Just test the paperweight, I'm sure."
"The rest I'll have to triple-check, but I'm nearly certain that's all the half-bloods or less crossed off."
"Don't. Even think about it. You're a liar and you embarrassed me in front of hundreds of people." She stormed off and Harry let his head fall to the table. He'd blown it.
"I..."
I enjoy traveling to
Harry recognised that they must be near Wiltshire, which he supposed made some amount of sense, though he didn't like the idea of being so nearby to the manor.
Harry spent the next day reading it over and wondering when he'd started letting Malfoy control his life. He did what any rational person would do when faced with a problem he wasn't sure how to even define, he called Hermione.
The next morning, there was a knock on his office door. Malfoy.
His mind immediately went to the questionnaires and he almost fell out of his seat. There was obviously another explanation. Or maybe Ron was joking. That had to be it. He had never grown out of playing practical jokes on Harry and had even taken to partnering up with George when he ran out of original ideas. Clearly, this idea had fallen right into his lap. It didn't make complete sense, though. There was no way Malfoy had completed the questionnaire, he was obviously straight. Even if he wasn't unattractive for a bloke by any means, neither of them would be interested.
They were sitting in an Italian restaurant that was equal distance from the Auror headquarters and St. Mungo's.
• • •
"He didn't." The results had come up. The magical signatures were incompatible.
Which was a great point. In fact, Harry had been so distracted with all of the business with the shop that he couldn't recall if he'd seen much of Ron the past couple of days. It was morning anyway, so he'd best wake him.
"Ron. You look well." Hermione's cheeks pinked as she said this, and she wouldn't meet either of their eyes.
There was scarcely a difference in their answers, but Patricia raised an eyebrow. She scribbled something on a piece of paper and when an elf came in with the tea, she passed the note to it.
"Distantly related."
"Understood, sir." He might have lost his job, but Robards didn't hate him. The press would have a field day with this and say he was going crazy, but it didn't matter.
"are the rejects," Malfoy finished. And he was right.
She pointed to the house elf who led him to a door in the back marked private and then left. There wasn't an exit besides going right back through her office.
"Stop moving, it's distracting." Malfoy's eyes trained on the tea in his hand, fingers thrumming on the handle.
Malfoy appeared from the other side of the bar, dressed in a skin-tight white shirt that was translucent and white skinny jeans. He practically glowed under the black lights. The men ordered three beers and then Malfoy saw him.
"Well, the other employees are all typical Potter Fanatics, the really obnoxious kind who worship the ground you walk on. I'm pretty sure my cubicle-mate has a poster of you hung over his bed."
Malfoy had looked as frail as the woman next to him. His face had been washed with an emotion Harry had never seen on him, even at his lowest, absolute anguish.
"I read those," Malfoy whispered.
"No. We're here with Teddy for the next couple of days and I want it to be fun for him. So not only do you have to not be an arse about anything as unimportant as baseball, you have to stop being so hard to relate to before I kill you."
"In polite society, you can't simply excuse yourself from conversation for the duration of a visit. At most, you can potentially manage a trip to the loo."
Malfoy laughed breathily. "I'm fine, Potter, are you okay? You're the one who just had your first gay experience here." He was still panting but he grinned when Harry shoved him.
It was like they all realised it at once, when George died, how close to the end they'd been themselves. How much they'd stopped really caring about life.
"That's not helping," Malfoy said, voice coming out dangerously low.
He was a collection of angles—short words, smooth jaw, well-cut suit. With his hair all ruffled like it was, though, it was easier to imagine him at a younger age when the lines weren't so defined, the edges not quite so sharp.
"Your impressive drink mixing skills."
"That's debatable."
He accepted the food she offered him and stepped out into the hallway to sit and eat. Verity plopped down across from him, sipping on a fizzy drink and leaning back against the balcony railing.
Alicia came back to the table but only to grab her bag.
"Why'd you lie to me about the Malfoy thing? He didn't know about the problem."
With a slow twirl of his wand, Harry cleared a spot on the floor about the size of a galleon. Malfoy followed suit, and for a while, they worked in silence.
"Yes it will."
"Hey, mate." Ron had approached their table without him noticing, looking more like himself than Harry had seen in a while, but dead tired all the same. "Ginny and I are gonna head back to Grimmauld. Lee's got somewhere to be early in the morning and Astoria decided to follow her friends off to a dance club." Ron shuddered exaggeratedly, quirking his lips. "You coming?
Teddy looked at him like he was stupid. "I don't give a hippogriff's arse if you're gay or if you 'like Malfoy'." He raised his hands and made air quotes around that part. "I just don't want you thinking you can pretend for a while and then go back to being happy with whatever witch your questionnaire brings."
"I've been doing muggle studies at school. Maybe we could go to a baseball game or something."
"No really, it's fine. Now that everything's cleared up, we can keep working to find your dad's killer."
Malfoy snorted. "Bollocks. Who is it? Did you get a sample for Protheus Longbottom?"
"I wasn't sure if I should leave you alone outside by yourselves or not. Wouldn't want you to get carried away."
"What is all this?" Neville asked, leaning down to pick up some parchment.
"I'll call Hermione and see what she has to say."
"Brilliant. Everyone else, what is it to you?"
"Okay, when are you thinking?"
And here Harry stopped listening because he didn't care anymore. That was the I'm Harry Potter Problem. They all thought he'd be perfect and when he made a tit of himself they were offended. Even if he hadn't meant to make her self conscious about her teeth, he was kind of glad he did, because it showed him the truth. She never would have seen him as just Harry. To her, he was Harry Potter, possible Prince Charming. That was the You're Harry Potter Problem.
With that in mind he drifted off, and after maybe an hour or two of unfulfilling sleep, he rolled out of bed and went to the sitting room to call her.
"You're sure?" She poured and grabbed his arm, not willing to let him sit it out.
"Well, I'll pay it," Harry said. He didn't mind. How could he? He'd helped start the shop, after all, so there was no reason he couldn't keep it going.
"They're okay, Mione. I promise."
If Harry had thought about the moment Andromeda would die, it wouldn't have been Malfoy there, and it wouldn't have been him either. It wouldn't have been Teddy having to take solace in the arms of a cousin he knew before as only distant and slightly cold even though he was trying. It would have been with her daughter and son-in-law at her side, her sisters, her husband, and her grandson all crowded around as her breaths grew more labored and tears spilled down their faces, but Andromeda had already lost so much. And for that reason, only her grandson, her nephew, and her grandson's godfather were by her side when she left the world, and they all looked at her in stony-faced silence.
"You did!"
"What? Don't be ridiculous."
The man who opened the door looked almost as old as Dumbledore had. His beard went nearly to his waist and his face sagged like it'd been smushed against glass. He led them into the living room and made them tea at Malfoy's request which was critical for their plan to work. It was how they planned to get the DNA.
"When you were talking to Malfoy," Ron continued.
"What's wrong with nice?"
His Floo lit up as he was practicing and Ron came through.
Malfoy's face was as shuttered as it had been back at Hogwarts and Harry startled at how easily he'd gotten used to it looking open and confident.
"Of course."
"If you're so frustrated, why don't you just quit and do us both a favour?"
Harry got up slowly, brushing off his hands on his jeans and sighing. It looked like it would take forever to get the office clean, but he started up with his casting again.
"He used to come to the Manor for Parties with his family. He gave me lots of sweets, but mother and father didn't like him much. His brother died, you know, but it was all very hush hush."
Harry let out a startled laugh. "What are all those supposed to do, exactly?"
Harry's only job was to walk around and mingle but he hated mingling and spent most of the evening hiding in the corner.
Malfoy let out a choked sob and Harry looked at Daphne in question. Was Malfoy crying?
"Uh.."
c) Chocolate Liqueur
"Oh, like what, you great tosser?"
"Have they let you in yet?"
Harry told her again how Ron had been the one to set them up under the pretence of solving The Problem and that he wouldn't ever live it down if Ron heard they'd 'hit it off' so-to-speak. He tried reinforcing the idea that there was nothing going on romantically between them but Hermione didn't seem to buy it.
A Personal Letter From Harry Potter:
"Why?"
"Because if you were me you'd miss him."
"Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Harry."
He snuck into the labs at work and pulled out the three samples.
"Er.. hi, Jane Cannolen. You're efficient, aren't you?"
"What do you mean?"
"Potter, if you don't do the test, I'm never speaking to you again. Ever."
"What do you mean?"
And so much more.
"That's the one."
After a quick peek inside the room, he located it about halfway across the floor, covered in a solid coating of orange and fallen on its side.
"You can hear me in there?"
Malfoy took a shaky breath and Harry grabbed his hand to steady him. He squeezed back and Harry felt his heart jump out of his chest. Teddy gave him the side eye and Harry kicked him under the table in response. So what if he was holding Malfoy's hand? It didn't mean anything.
c) once or twice a year
"I fucking know that. Do you see them here?"
Ron nodded and shrugged, rushing over to steady Ginny as he saw her stumble out of her seat drunkenly, laughing with her as he supported her out the door. It closed behind them and Malfoy still hadn't spoken, but he turned back slowly to Harry.
He laughed. "Yeah, good luck with. I've made breakfast."
"Christ, Malfoy. How are we supposed to get through this all?"
"Just be yourself, Harry. No witch worth marrying is going to decline a second date with you because of who you are."
"Wh-" Malfoy cut off as Harry thrust his hips.
"What are you wearing?"
Harry didn't read the papers the next morning, but Hermione told him that the quotes had been printed exactly as they'd sent them with minimal commentary. That meant they'd look something like this.
Harry was torn between telling Teddy to watch his language and asking why he was so sure he even liked Malfoy but instead he asked, "How do you even know about the questionnaire."
"She's married."
"Hey! You're not permitted to be back here!"
He almost pulled the candy wrapper out of his pocket when the door flew open.
"We should check the DNA samples first to find out which is my father and which is the killer."
"So?"
Afterwards, Hermione told him he should have been less concerned with what was between her teeth and Ron laughed and said it sounded like he'd lucked out. They were both right, in a way.
"Gods no."
Harry choked on his tongue, and Zabini looked vaguely amused by this.
She sounded perfect, Harry didn't have a problem with nice. Hermione could have been describing his dream girl.
"You're the one who came through the floo. If you didn't want to chat, what do you want?"
"I liked it. It showed he wanted you for your personality, not your body like some men."
Fred grinned. “I reckon he doesn’t know, George."
“Because I’m not going to see him all summer?” answered Harry with amusement. He turned to Draco, “Which one, then? The knight?”
"Quite the story," said Lupin. He looked at Harry, "And you like him."
The changing rooms were quiet, most of the team having already walked out to enjoy the rest of the day, with the exception of Fred, George and Harry, who sat in awkward silence trying to come up with a good way to cheer up Ron.
While the crowd and his friends seemed to dread the new arrival, Harry felt giddy as he turned around. It had been Parkinson the one to speak up, her arms crossed and a glint on her eyes that made it clear she was enjoying her new role, but Harry’s eyes went directly for the one standing next to her.
From across the table, Ron made a non-committal hum.
badge, probably for the first time in the year, and frowned at him. Sitting next to her, Draco sent him a grin, and Harry grinned back.
The day of the Hearing, Harry received a short letter wishing him good luck.
“Really? Because with those lovely bites you have there, one just wonders if you and my dear cousin have dragged each other to some dark space, like a cave maybe, and-”
If the man had any regrets about what he said, he wasn’t showing them now. “You are relating to the people he stood against,” spat Sirius. “To the people that
“Ah,” said Harry. This wasn’t the way he thought he would let the others now, but in all honesty, he hadn’t thought of a way either. “Saves me the trouble, then."
Ginny frowned. “Grubbly-Plank was there again, but he can’t have left, right?"
The wolf backs away and Harry stays still, waiting until it returns, letting Harry's palm rest between its eyes. It's soft, and warm, and Harry feels amazed as the wolf closes its eyes and leans into the touch.
“My mother doesn’t either, mate.” Ron shoved in another piece of cake. “She keeps inviting Tonks over, I think she’s hoping Bill will notice her. Which is bonkers, what man in his right mind would look at Tonks when Fleur is right there?”
“I get it, Harry,” she said, “He’s really handsome.”
Ron shuddered. "Because Harry is always there and I can't stand them- I mean, I like them apart, but together, ugh." He stuck out his tongue and made a face. "Sickening. With you I don't have to worry about that."
Harry was already settling under his covers when Ron finally spoke.
“Is everything alright, dear?” asked Mrs Weasley.
“Maybe Snape told him?” tried Ron.
“Thanks."
Harry nodded. “Alright. Er, goodbye, Malfoy,” he said.
Harry couldn't help himself. “That’s all?”
“A clear winner!” Slughorn beamed at Harry as if he had invented the potion. “One drop of this would be enough to kill us, I’m quite sure! Congratulations, my boy, here you go.” He pressed the vial into Harry’s hand and wagged a finger. “Use it well.”
When he looked back at his friends, Hermione wasn't angry anymore. She looked as amused as Ron, and grinned as she said, “So now you are trying to
Draco pursed his lips. “Could have been someone from
Harry blinked. “You are giving me the entire box?"
“Since when are they friends?” asked Hermione, following Harry’s line of sight.
“How did he get you?” asked Harry. It was clear that everyone invited apart from her was somehow related to an influential person, which left the question of why Slughorn snatched her as well.
“I have to admit, it’s quite clever,” was saying Draco. “Pansy showed me the one you gave her, and it’s almost indistinguishable from a real galleon."
Harry laughed. "Is that a yes?"
“Shut up,” said Draco, but his voice lacked the fire it had a few moments ago. Despite Kreacher having obeyed, the blond didn’t look victorious at all.
“Beats me.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You think betrayal is a good invention?”
“That’s good.” Draco scrunched his nose. “That makes it clear, doesn’t it?"
A hand squeezed his shoulder firmly and he looked up to meet Hermione’s brown eyes. “Harry," she said sternly. "Draco made a decision that day."
“Obviously."
Sirius beamed. “Of course it is! They are always welcome here. If they want they can stay over too, we definitely have the room.” His godfather yawned openly before continuing, this time giving Harry a sly smirk, “By the way, is my dear cousin coming by? Do let me know so I take out the silverware.”
“You are ridiculous,” huffed Ginny at his struggle, exiting the compartment with Crookshanks on her arms.
was left unsaid because the man hadn’t actually been their teacher, and because it brought bad memories to both of them.
Harry had no idea why Zabini was talking to him now, nor why he was looking at him in refined amusement. Then he noticed Fay Dunbar on a table nearby, happily talking to her friends.
“Mr Malfoy!” came Madame Pomfrey’s shrill voice. “You can’t just barge in like that!”
“-or if they deem them dangerous,” continued Draco without a hitch. “And,” he pointed at a pale looking first-year whose nose was bleeding, “These look dangerous to me, so I’m confiscating them."
Draco smiled. “I hope you can stand being away from me for a few hours. Perhaps I’ll catch up with you later." He paused for a moment, seemingly in deep thought. “Can I ask you something else?"
“As you should!” barked Sirius, throwing an arm around his shoulders. “Listen to me, Harry,” he said in a quieter voice. “You shouldn’t trust that slimy son of a motherfu- For Godric’s sake, Moony, he is sixteen!” Remus kept his glare and Sirius sighed. “Fine, won’t use bad words around the baby, but the point is this; Don’t let him even think you like him.”
thought Harry. Had Fay been talking about him all night? He didn’t think the girl would, but Zabini was here now, and she was his date, of course Zabini would be annoyed by that, Harry would have felt a bit jealous.
Harry hummed. “There
"Quaffle is back on Slytherin hands!"
That night, Harry first dreamed of an empty ballroom, with white walls and floors and soft music, white smiles and graceful steps.
They walked into the Common Room, empty as the younger students didn’t get free periods. Harry let himself plop down in a chair and rubbed his temple. He hadn’t slept well last night.
“You,” said Harry, then reaching to touch the freckles. “I like these."
“I’m not going anywhere.”
The smile on the ginger’s face dropped, as he looked down at the board. Harry asked Ron if he was glad to finally have someone to play against and a pawn flew towards his face.
The room wasn’t even half of the size of the Room of Requirement, which didn’t mean it was small, just that it was a normal-sized room. However, it still had two chandeliers, a fireplace and a piano, so
” replied Draco coldly, his hand still on Harry’s shoulder. “Granger,” he added stiffly.
Harry stared at him for a moment before shaking it. “Goodbye, Big D, and good luck,” he said, receiving a grin from his cousin before he stepped back to join his startled parents. Petunia pursed her lips as if wanting to say something, but in the end, she said nothing and Harry turned around to exit the house for the very last time.
Dumbledore’s eyes crinkled before he turned towards Slughorn. “It’s regrettable you don’t want the job, Horace, but do know you are always welcome at Hogwarts, if you choose to visit, no matter the security measures we might place. So long”
handsome.”
a disaster waiting to happen."
“Wait!” he said, perhaps a bit too loud. He grimaced at their startled expressions, “I’m sorry, there’s just something I need to tell you."
At least until Dumbledore showed up, with an entrance Draco called extremely dramatic under his breath. The great oak doors to the Entrance Hall had opened, making everyone fall silent as the Headmaster walked in the circle. Umbridge looked a second away from snapping her own wand when Dumbledore brought up the authority that remained with the Headmaster and asked McGonagall to escort Trelawney to her rooms again.
“Then what reminds me of it? Probably just the size, and that fireplace over there.” Draco glanced up and the chandelier. “We have two of these, but I have to admit I like this one better."
That made Harry snap back to it. To Sirius. He grabbed Draco by the shoulders, not sure if he did it to reassure him or himself. “I have to go to the Ministry.”
Mrs Weasley had been ecstatic. She had kissed Ron a million times and agreed to buy him a broom as a reward. The ginger had been over the moon when she returned from Diagon Alley with a long package.
Draco looked away, “It’s fine,” he said. “I already knew you were a bit of a troll anyway.”
Draco gave him a side look as he dried himself with a towel. “Serves you right for coming after me uninvited. I clearly excused myself because I needed some time alone.”
With a sigh, Harry broke apart from the mirror and walked up the stairs towards his room. Hedwig was still in her open cage, and blinked slowly at him in greeting before letting out a soft hoot.
Draco licked his lips and smiled back. "I don't
close enough for the fall too be only slightly painful. Above him, he could see Draco staring at a sheepish Crabbe, both of them landing a few meters away while the crowd jeered at them, Lee calling it a nasty foul and Hooch zooming towards them while angrily blowing her whistle.
“A boa?” Draco looked confused. “You mean you conjured a boa constrictor?”
“I mean, Voldemort will break him out sooner or later because he is going to need every foot-soldier.” Sirius yawned again, hugging his robe snuggly around him. “But, it will probably be later,

flirting,” hissed Hermione under her breath, making sure no one heard. “In a very odd way that made us lose
"Draco," called Harry to no avail. The blond kept walking towards the same path the rest of the students had taken a while ago. Harry was just about to go after him when the blond stopped out of the blue with a startled yelp, then taking a quick step back while giving the air in front of him an accusing look.
“How?” asked Hagrid, looking lost again. Then he blinked too. “Oh, right, you can’t see them, can you?" When Draco shook his head, Hagrid advanced towards him, the way he did it not unlike the way Harry had seen him approach other creatures. The Groundskeeper rested a hand in the air gently, probably holding the thestral. “Go on then,” he grunted.
Harry shrugged. “I did it on Friday.”
The warning whistle of the train went off, making the rest of the students in the platform hurry onto the train.
Ron waved his fork. “That’s what I’ve been saying! But these two and my mom are insane.”
“We have an hour left.” Draco stood up, primly brushed off the grass from his trousers and offered a hand to Harry. “If you don’t stare at me too much, it’ll be enough."
Draco stopped his examination to blink at Harry. “You know it?”
Zacharias crossed his arms over his chest, muttering, “I was just asking."
"I was thinking she could use a vacation from work."
of yourself with your
"Yeah, why?"
Harry felt his eyes burning, "I- I understand."
Only three days later, Harry found himself stomping up the stairs, not caring about how slippery they were.
The final match of Quidditch season found a Gryffindor team that had suffered great losses. Fred and George's final prank had earned them admiration and raised the spirits of the entire castle, but their leave now meant that Gryffindor had lost their beaters, in addition to the Seeker. With Dumbledore gone, there was no one to stop Umbridge from banning Harry from playing.
Harry crossed his arms and leaned against the door. “Can you do that later? We won’t see each other for a while and I’d rather spend as much time as I can with you.”
“Sorry, I can’t,” sighed Harry, mentally cursing himself.
“Lucius Malfoy’s
going to happen."
Harry frowned. “I know, but-"
“What did you say?" asked Ron, bringing a hand to his wet chin to clean the drops rolling down from it as he looked at the person responsible for his outburst.
The stretched silence, though uncomfortable, became nothing more than background noise, as both of them kept to their business, Malfoy usually finishing and leaving first, always throwing the same glare at Harry. That brief second was the only moment they really acknowledged the other.
. Although, having seen how excited Sirius was, Harry suspected he might be there as extra supervision as well.
Draco looked up from the book he held on his lap. He was sitting on the floor just in front of Harry, cross-legged like a child but still making it look proper. Or maybe that was just Harry’s biased perception. “Yes, career advice. What about it?”
“So,” said a voice to his right, not long after he had started on a slice of treacle tart, which he hadn’t advanced on much. He looked up to see Ron, Hermione and Ginny seating near him. It was Ginny the one that had spoken as she took the seat next to him. “You have heard the
Harry was stunned for a moment, and looked at the tapestry again. Its extension on the wall, along with the many connections, made it feel like a spider-web, capturing and unforgiving. He stared at Draco’s name, on the very edge of it, and the tree turned into the maws of a beast, ready to close around it at any moment. And Harry felt like he wanted to take it out of there, but the golden lines were strong and solid. Family wasn’t a choice, but-
“I warned them that signing meant they weren’t going to tell,” said Hermione. “If they abide by their word, nothing will happen to them."
. Dark blue eyes met Harry’s, widening in recognition as a white smile grew on a pretty face.
The grey eyes were as pretty as ever, even from all the way across the hall, but they weren’t smiling at him. Their corners had fallen when they saw him, and Harry wanted to run across the hall and hold their owner close to him.
Harry nodded firmly. “Quite ready,” he said with a grin. “I’m going to win.”
“I am,” said Harry. “He-"
“I’m sure they just wanted to scare you,” said Harry reassuringly, although he wasn’t sure because the twins could be quite vindictive. They had shoved Monteague, another member of the Inquisitorial Squad, inside a weird cabinet when he had tried to remove points from them. “I might be at fault for that.”
Draco nodded, clearing his throat. “I believe we should go back. I’m sure Weasley is feeling quite lost without you."
“Before, er, Ron showed up. You were going to tell me something.”
Draco's silver eyes were on him again. "You didn’t?"
Harry looked back at her, raising an eyebrow in confusion. "Like eventually, right?" he said, not sure why she seemed so worked up by the idea.
reassuring,” said Draco, and then he brought Harry’s hand to his lips, gently kissing the skin just next to the scars, the gesture rendering Harry speechless. The blond looked up at him with a slight frown. “You must be tired, let’s get you back to your common room."
Harry sighed. “No, I think he’s already gone.”
“I’m dating someone,” confessed Harry.
“Damn
Draco blinked at him. "You what?"
But because peace never lasted for Hogwarts students, disaster struck just past midnight, when a girl who had been gushing to her friends about how attractive the Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students were threw an offhand comment on how
"Why not?" came a dreamy voice. Everyone turned towards Luna, that stood near the front of the group with her usual half-gone smile. "I thought this club was for anyone that wanted to learn."
to her face?"
The only positive aspect of winter for Harry, one he wouldn’t say aloud in fear of sounding terribly cheesy, was the lovely pink tinge on Draco’s face caused by the coldness. Even when he kept the lower half of his face covered by a scarf, Harry could still see it on his pale nose.
Draco hummed. “You have loyal minions, Scarhead”.
“I can hand you one as well if you wish. I just thought Harry was letting you know about the meetings."
“Means she was expecting a mess.” Ron walked past him, sitting on the bed and taking a look around. “Needs more posters, I will bring some next time.”
"Draco is a dragon, so you are one, and you were just
“Sorry, mate,” said Ron with a grimace. “But she always says that, right?"
“Are you coming, Neville?”
“Maybe you could use some help,” started Harry casually.
Harry only glared back until Draco scoffed and walked away with the rest of the Inquisitorial Squad, some of them patting him in the back. The crowd parted and dispersed, entering the Great Hall after glancing at Harry.
“You take Remedial Potions?” scoffed Zacharias disdainfully. “You must be
Harry just hummed into his cup. It’s not that he wasn’t used to having trouble sleeping but last night he had purposely stayed until late waiting for an owl, and once midnight struck he figured he could wait a bit longer and then the sun was rising.
Hermione raised an eyebrow at him, looking amused. "Were you with Malfoy?"
The fire flickered to life behind them once again with a crack and Sirius' confused voice filled the silence. “Harry? Why did Kreacher just cry all the way to my room? Did something happen?”
They had taken the truth of what happened with Marietta quite similarly to Harry; getting angry at the girl and then, even if they didn’t say it out loud, relieved by Draco not having turned on them. It made Harry happy, knowing that they were getting along better and that the circumstances hadn’t ruined that.
“Busy?” repeated Remus slowly. His eyes flickered to the sign over them and he opened his mouth, closing it again when he met Harry’s gaze. The man cleared his throat and looked away. “Well, in that case, let’s get going.”
"You would love that, wouldn't you?" Draco placed on hand on his hip and raised the other to his chin. “It’s easier to cast it once you have done it before, right?"
Sweet. The incredible sweetness of rich caramel broke through the awful bitterness of the outside, then mixing into a devastatingly good combination.
Harry wanted another godfather.
"You are going to freeze in there," said Draco, pointedly looking at the lake.
Draco blinked at her. “Yes?”
Hermione frowned, “It’s ridiculous to gather evidence to prove something
“Chess!” exclaimed Ron suddenly, making everyone look at him. “Malfoy, let’s play chess. I can bet House points now."
“I believe it was,
“Right.” Draco cleared his throat and walked by the spot, pressing himself close to a tree. Once he had passed the gap, he turned towards Hagrid with an uncertain expression, clearing his throat again before speaking, "Thank you."
Monday finally came and Harry found himself in a good mood. He felt well-rested after a long night of dreaming of constellations and soft words. Seamus left the room before Harry had even left the bed as usual, as he had been avoiding him after their discussion, but that didn’t sour his mood. Neither did the way other students seemed to open a way for him as he walked down the halls towards the Great Hall.
"Bossy, bossy."
"Of course you do, I created it," said Draco, going back to look at the list. "Patronus Potter," he said again thoughtfully. "I heard it was corporeal and everything." Harry looked at him and Draco continued, "And that's quite difficult to achieve, isn't it?" His silver eyes were on Harry now, looking at him in a way that made Harry want to puff his chest and said that
right there. Harry doesn’t know why the sight makes him feel so elated, but he dismisses it and presses on, “I can help you with that.”
“Yes, what?!” roared Angelina.
Draco gingerly opened it, taking out the scarf. It was blue, and Harry had bought it because he thought it would look good with his pretty eyes. But he couldn't say that now.
"You mean here? In the library?" asked Draco, glancing around the empty space. The grin he gave Harry was blinding. "Perhaps just one."
Ron chuckled. “Right, and your mom will kill you as well.”
The blond huffed. “You don’t have to sound so surprised."
There was a long silence as Harry locked the door and the group of Slytherins stopped before the rest of the students, meeting their stares with amused expressions. Harry came to stand between the two sides and sighed. “Right, as I was saying-"
His pulse spiked up when he noticed his own growing hardness, the embarrassment that made his head heat up overpowered by the desire to do it again, to feel Draco’s too, so he did and heard Draco moan. His grasp on Harry’s shirt tightened as his lips traced Harry’s jaw to the end, mouthing at it before biting down.
“I’d rather not,” said Draco, then glancing at Harry and sighing. “But I suppose I have no other option."
Snape’s office was dimly lit and had an oppressing atmosphere that felt especially suffocating now as Harry and the professor stared at each other. The latter looking livid with rage, the former completely speechless after what he had seen.
“Those two have my utmost respect.” Sirius was gawking at a building, its bright orange and purple impossible to not notice among the darkness that had taken over Diagon Alley. Over the entrance door was a huge plastic replica of one of the Weasley twin’s heads, an arm peeking out of a lower window raise its top hat, under which a rabbit kept appearing and disappearing.
“Fifty,” breathed out Harry. “You took fifty. Are you offering them back?”
Or at least tries to, because the cloak slides off him, tangling at his feet and making him stumble. He can only hear a low growl before he is being tackled, sending him rolling down the hall.
type of thing,” tried another girl.
“I heard you."
It made Harry’s anger waver, giving way to confusion and a deep pang of betrayal. "What?" He took a step back. Kreacher had disappeared during that time, but if he had gone to Draco's house, to his parents…
Harry fumbled to grab his quill, which he almost dropped. He shook his head and tried to read his textbook. Then realized he had already closed it. He opened it again on a random page and glued his eyes to it. He didn’t look up again until Ron started telling Hermione she was a girl.
“I was busy studying. Which you should be doing as well,” replied Hermione without taking her eyes off a sturdy-looking book. “Plus, there is nothing I could have done. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.”
“Harry, Hermione,” came a whisper that startled him out of his thoughts. They turned around to find Hagrid and Harry didn’t understand how they hadn’t seen him before. The Groundskeeper sported another bruise and looked nervous. “Can you come with me?”
They glared at each other darkly, neither looking away until Harry reached for Draco’s hands, pulling his attention back to him. “I understand it’s a risk, Draco,” said Harry, looking at him seriously. “But it’s important for us to be ready for what is coming next. You told me to find another way, right?”
what you want. For us to go back to being just
?" Draco didn’t answer and Harry grinned. “
Harry nodded, before setting his eyes on Hermione and putting on a serious expression. “Pointy troll. You are insane.”
“But it’s rather impressive, isn’t it?” said Harry, as they watched Fred and Lee collect gold from the crowd. “They really know their stuff."
Harry smiled. “Not bad at all, and you?"
“And then it will be the two of us.” Sirius beamed. “And Moony sometimes, because he thinks I’m not a responsible figure.”
Harry frowns. "Wait, you remember everything?” he asks, because if Malfoy did, he should be even angrier. Right?
thinks you placed your name in."
It wasn’t Sirius who he first saw in the living room once the connection opened, but Lupin. The man shot up from the couch and strode towards him. “Harry? Is everything alright?”
“Really? Because you
“I have no idea what you are talking about." Draco sniffed. “Now, what did Diggory say to you exactly?"
Draco blinked at him quietly and Harry noted triumphantly the pink tinge on his cheeks. “Well, of course I did," mumbled Draco, then clearing his throat and looking at Harry carefully. “I see you finally cut your hair.”
So he had sat down at the table expecting the worse.
Malfoy let out a snort, an undignified sound Harry was sure he had heard before but felt like something new. And Harry wanted to hear it again, so he frowned, trying to put on the same sour expression the Head of Slytherin wore.
told himself Harry, glancing at the clock as the last group departed. Just as he was about to check the map, the doors opened, effectively startling him into hiding the box of toffees behind him.
Harry grinned, and then barely registered Draco’s warning gesture before the Quaffle collided with the back of his head. “Ouch,” he muttered, managing to catch it before it plummeted to the ground. He rubbed his head, unsure if it hurt more than his pride.
“You will find that I
(See the end of the chapter for
"It did, Ron," said Harry as he folded his glasses and rested them on his nightstand.
Draco had frozen as well. “Hello, professor,” he offered politely, grey eyes stopping on the fresh cuts on his face and widening slightly.
“Surely you meant
“With whatever has you nervous, of course,” answered Luna simply. “I’ll see you later, Harry."
The wolf advances, head low and a growl-like sound coming from its throat. Despite knowing there was no way out, Harry can't help but scoot back until his back is flush against the wall, trying to put as much distance between him and the wolf. His gaze flickers to the hall on his left, figuring he could make a break for it, but as if reading his thoughts, the wolf growls again, and Harry stops and looks at it.
“Father saw it too, and he told me,” the blond paused for a second, as if uncertain. “
“What do you want, Dud?” asked Harry.
"I used this book on Defense a lot when I was training, Harry, I thought you might like one too"
thought Harry fondly, trying not to smile and keep a neutral expression.
“You know the saying,” started Draco, looking around before leaning in. “Keep your friends close, and...?"
made Harry jolt out of his staring. Snape was looming over him, hands at each side of his desk and a disdainful expression on his face that told Harry he was about to be insulted. “Mister Potter, our resident
"No, it's not
Now that there was no need to share the space with other pairs, Harry and Draco could take the entire centre, standing on opposite sides of the duelling mat the Room happily provided. Harry laughed, "This brings back memories."
"No, you can't," said Draco. He looked around the lake again. "If it's plants you are looking for, shouldn't you ask Longbottom? Isn't he kind of obsessed with them?"
“But I didn’t,” pointed Harry.
“Yep,” said Moody, still bouncing the terrified ferret.
. Harry felt Draco tense up and turned to tell him the article was probably a joke.
Harry grinned at him, leaning down to take out his finished essay from his bad. “I do,” he said, waving the rolled-up parchment.
"James wasn’t a blood purist,” growled Sirius. “Don’t bring him into this."
“Skeeter’s articles are rubbish. Every respectable wizard knows that,” said Malfoy after a moment of silence.
“You have been doing that lately. Not causing trouble,” he smiled at the blond. “Hermione and Ron were quite worried when you didn’t complain to Hagrid about walking the Skrewts.”
“I’m sorry-”
, Quaffle is back to Slytherin."
“Yet you kept going."
Ron stared at him in silence for a moment and then smacked him on the arm. “You
Ron nodded, skimming through the book until he reached a certain page. “Ah, alright, so hallways mean transition or change. Well, I guess that makes sense?"
"I just don't understand
Harry didn’t appreciate his tranquillity. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he demanded. “You knew about Draco’s father, and you didn’t say a thing, even when Sirius told you about what he did for us.”
Hermione shook her head. “If he was, he wouldn’t have written something this short. Or he would have, but been even more cutting. Right, Harry?”
” pointed out Ron, grinning when Harry frowned at him. “You know, he might
Draco nodded. “So? What do you have planned?”
Hermione wasn't convinced. "The Patronus was set for April, Harry, we are in March. Unless you skipped an entire month-" She paused on her words, pursing her lips and giving him a disapproving look. "He asked you, didn't he?"
“Here,” said Malfoy, extending something small towards him.
He was the first to notice the familiar shade of platinum hair when they doubled a corner but Mr Weasley quickly followed, his hand clenching over Harry’s shoulder.
“You shouldn’t just come to the library to sleep,” said Hermione sternly.
“Do not finish that question, Ronald Weasley.”
“It’s Hagrid's." Harry's voice came out muffled. "He and Buckbeak say hi. Apparently, he is planning to use him for lessons again.”
Harry turns then, and Malfoy is already dressed but Harry’s jacket is still in his hands. There’s a frown on his face as he looks at him. “Will you tell?” asks Malfoy, and now he sounds resigned in an entirely not-Malfoy way.
It works. Surprise makes Malfoy snap his gaze to him and Harry sees it, a spark of intense anger in his grey eyes, and that makes him grin because that is
“What is she doing here?” asked Draco coolly, eyes hard as steel and throwing daggers at the woman despite addressing Hermione. “Shouldn’t she be in a
The water was cold, and Harry was sure that if it weren’t for the resistance the Gillyweed gave him, it would be freezing. He wasn’t sure of how much time had passed since he got in, everything looking the same underwater, but he had finally reached what seemed to be ruins.
Ron stepped forwards, raising his hands in a placating motion. “Mate, you have to understand, it does look like a trap, we are not sure-”
Zabini raised an eyebrow. “Were you expecting the entire house here?"
Harry smiled. “Sure, whatever you want."
Harry sighed. Narcissa would surely ask questions if she found a letter, and Draco most likely didn't want to tell her what he had done...
“He’s too useful,” continued Remus, turning back to the street. “That’s good for him, if not for us. But Florean…” He sighed. “We can only hope.”
The stag came forth again, giving a throttle around the room before stopping near them, as if aware of their presence now. It was big, tall and imposing even in its misty appearance as its non-defined eyes looked at them.
?” came an angry voice, and they turned to look at Angelina as she walked into the room. “I chose you myself."
“If you are so keen on losing, Weasley” drawled Draco, grin back to usual. “Then I’ll do you the favour."
The other reason for Harry's tense week was Draco. The world hadn't stopped, so Hogwarts hadn't either. He saw the blond during meals and classes, but he seemed to have disappeared from everywhere else.
“Wait a second, you think he’s in danger?”
Harry looked at Draco, standing by the door looking surprised at the scene. Their eyes crossed, and Harry wondered if he had enough courage. As the blond gave him a small smile, Harry hoped he did.
The pain cleared Harry’s mind, making him curse and pull back. Draco’s skin was flushed pink and his breath was lacking, but he still had the nerve to grin and snicker at Harry’s glare. “Harry,” he said as he cupped his face with a hand. “You are
Taking that as the end of the discussion, and because they were running late, Harry clapped his hands to attract the attention of the Room. "Right," he said once all eyes were on him again. "Let's get started right away. We don't have much time."
hey hey hey! hope you liked the chapter! do let me know, i love reading your thoughts <3
The Weasleys gasped and Sirius scoffed again, but Lupin just kept looking at Hermione patiently.
“What?” Harry watched as Draco stood up, casually letting go of the portrait he was holding, which crashed on the floor. The Minister’s face stared up at them among the broken crystals, as confused as Harry was.
Draco paused, looking at him carefully, for long enough that they became the only two people standing in the hall. Then he smiled, a small curve of his lips that didn't really reach his eyes. “Yes, everything’s fine."
is breaking curfew too,” pointed out Ron. “Because of you."
"Ten points from Gryffindor for being so
That seemed to please Krum, because he stepped back, his frown giving way to his usual stoic expression. Hermione gaped between them and tried to ask Krum about it, but the older student only managed to point out there was a beetle on her hair before the judges started announcing the scores.
Harry couldn't tell him he was staying with The Order since it was supposed to be a secret, so he just said he was staying with the Weasleys. Draco hadn’t commented on that, instead asking Harry how he was preparing for the Hearing.
“I think my level is enough for the exams,” said Draco easily, smiling at him as he turned them around again. “Come on."
"I was afraid of how they would react. But I was being a coward," said Harry. "And I ended up hurting you and for that, I'm sorry." He gave Draco an earnest look. "I'm so sorry, Draco."
“There’s nothing to listen!” snapped Sirius. “We are in a
Goyle gave Harry the quill. "Can I try jinxing Weasley now?"
Right? But the wolf only blinks at him slowly, looking exhausted, and Harry thinks again of the dark circles under Malfoy's eyes. "You don't want to be alone?"
, you didn’t share with me."
Draco stood a bit further from the group along with Zabini, watching over it with an unreadable expression. He noticed Harry, but instead of the usual brief smile that made his chest warm, there was a small shake of his head.
Draco grinned. “I can arrange that.” His eyes were sparkling, and he shook his head in amusement before returning to his book.
” repeated a third voice, making both of them jump and turn around to notice Ron walking up the stairs, doing a bad attempt to hide his broom behind his back.
"As you should." Draco rolled his eyes humorously. "Stop being daft and go to sleep, alright?"
thought Harry as he swam closer.
Harry almost crashed into him when Draco spun around. “You are
“New Potions’ professor, and he wants to collect you, probably.” Harry shrugged when Neville sent him a startled look. “I have no idea, Neville, but he is a Slytherin so watch out.”
Draco looked at him as if in disbelief. “I’m not going to sit there, watching as you tell that wretched woman what she needs to know to taint my father’s name,” his voice grew angrier as he spoke, “You can’t just ask me to watch as you-”
Only he didn't stop, and Harry's left arm was almost pulled out of its socket when Draco merely grabbed his hand and kept running. "I'm going to kill them! I'm going to kill them!" swore the blond, letting out another whimper when the dragon roared again.
His trunk bounced on the steps as he ran down the stairs, Hedwig chirping in protest from the swinging cage on his other hand. The ruckus alerted Sirius and Remus, making them stop their hushed conversation at the bottom of the stairs.
There's a growl that makes him stop his retreat and look at the wolf. Its ears are raised in attention, lowering when Harry meets its eyes. "What?" asks Harry, approaching the bed carefully. And suddenly there's a mouth closing around his arm and pulling him down, and before he can even blink he is sprawled on the bed with a heavy wolf curled next to him.
The Headmaster gestured at Harry to sit down. “Can you tell me, Harry, why Voldemort attempted to trick you into going to the Ministry?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m skiving off a class to do homework for another, how is that being a bad influence?"
“Come on, mate,” pressed Ron, a wide grin on his face.
“Is this why you didn’t want us to study together?” asked Draco, as they walked up the set of stairs to the common room.
“My cousin,” went on Sirius. “Are you worried about him?”
"Exactly!" exclaimed Lavender and along with her quite a few heads around the room nodded gravely. Parvati let out a sigh and raised a hand to her chin, looking like the perfect picture of someone in deep thought. Everyone seemed to hold their breaths as her face scrunched up almost painfully.
"Alright," said Harry. He let out another sigh and pulled Draco into a hug, hiding his face on the crook of his neck and just breathing in. Soon Draco's fingers were gently threading through his hair, comforting like his words, and Harry felt himself feeling better. "Thank you."
“Perhaps I don’t feel like doing so anymore,” deadpanned Draco, and started walking away.
“He won’t,” stated Harry firmly, ignoring the looks from his friends.
Bagman signalled him and Cedric to take their places, and enter the maze. He threw one last look over his shoulder, but instead of another grin, he found Moody, giving him an intense look, and pointing to his right.
“Are you suggesting I made a mistake?"
seem to know what you are doing,” said the horrid woman, looking at her pink clipboard. “Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class."
There was a loud clearing of a throat. Blaise was looking at the others. “...Scatter?” he said, and soon enough Nott slipped past Harry, Goyle grabbed the remaining luggage, Ron mumbled something, and then the door was closing with a slam, leaving the two of them alone. The silence felt heavy, and Harry didn’t miss a second to break it.
There were still a few that remained put off by the idea. Seamus kept his startled gaze flickering back and forth from the speakers to Dean, who just laughed at every confession. Cormac McLaggen had a look of disgust on his face, openly staring at every speaker and shaking his head in disapproval. And Ron- Harry had to repress a snort because if Ron had pearls like his aunt did, he would certainly be clutching them. He seemed startled into silence, freckled face going pale, looking as if he were facing Voldemort and Aragog at the same time.
Draco hummed. “I don’t know, Granger. If I asked you to bring me evidence that these, uh..."
Draco narrowed his eyes. “Flying at this hour,
“It’s good he didn’t come,” mused Ron. “I doubt he would have liked it here, and I refuse to spend an hour listening to Mal-"
Harry immediately frowned at the disdainful tone. "Why?"
“Why?” said Harry.
Draco hummed again. “I’m not sure yet, but I have a vague idea." He laughed at Harry’s confused expression, then leaning a bit closer. “Remember what I asked you, Harry."
"Aren't they going to tell?" whispered Neville, definitely confused by their exit, but the remaining Slytherins didn't seem concerned about that at all.
“I don’t know, Harry” sighed Ron. “Perhaps I’m not cut for this."
"Draco's coming to watch our practice later," commented Harry as he served himself some toast from the uncrowded Gryffindor table. Breakfast was served early at 8 every day, but during the weekends it remained until 10, in case students chose to sleep in a bit more. And as it turned out, a lot of them did. “I mean, he always did, along with the Slytherins, so it’s not really different from usual."
Hermione stood next to Harry “But, sir, what are you doing here? Isn’t the Ministry after you?”
fine.” Sirius winked at him and ruffled his hair before his expression turned a bit more serious. “Listen, Harry,” he said, lowering his voice. “Don’t go too easy on my cousin, alright? He owes you an explanation.”
“But they are insane,” said Ron, voice muffled by toast. “Insane, and blind, and wrong.”
When the day of the Task finally arrived, Harry felt prepared enough. He had still wanted to practice more, alone, since Ron and Hermione would be busy with their exams, but she had said he would only tire himself.
Harry frowned. “There’s nothing to tell-" He paused, thinking.
“Sod off, Malfoy,” muttered Ron. “Why was Katie bleeding so much anyway? I didn’t hit her that hard, right?"
is doing?"
“Like, not the one about my dad,” said Ron quietly, then shaking his head and shrugging. “But I don’t know, maybe it helps? We don’t have anything better to do, anyway."
accept it.”
public meeting."
“You didn’t ask."
said a little voice in his head, grating and malicious.
a prat,” said Harry, approaching the group to stand next to Draco.
Dumbledore and Slughorn halted their discussion of old age and retirement at once to look at him, making Harry realise he had interrupted them. However, instead of getting mad, Dumbledore’s face twitched in amusement and he stood up.
Harry deposited the books on the table loudly, making the students from other tables give him nasty looks.
Hermione returned the look without saying anything, because she too knew that Lucius Malfoy would be one of the names in Harry’s testimony. As it had been before, when the remaining adrenaline from his encounter in the courtyard made him snap at Fudge. But now there was none of that, only a shiver up his spine and a dreaded dilemma.
“It’s leaving!” shrieked Mrs Weasley. “Quick, quick!" She gave all of them hugs while telling them to write and be good. Sirius jumped, placing its front paws on Harry’s shoulders and looking too serious for a dog for a brief moment before Mrs Weasley shoved Harry towards the train.
Draco and he parted ways just before the train’s door, where the blond gave Harry’s hand one last squeeze before holding his luggage firmly and stepping out. The crowd parted around him, the chatter increasing slightly, not that noticeable among the existing noise.
“Because it was ridiculous,” said Draco, passing a hand through his hair and sighing. “It
“There wasn’t much to worry about there, Moony,” said Sirius, resting a hand on Remus’ shoulder. “We purebloods get the talk very early, you know that. We don’t want any bastards running around.” He snickered and continued, “I’m sure dear Narcissa made sure to talk with Draco the moment he had his growth spurt.”
“You are here for an interview with Harry,” cut in Luna, voice as dreamy as usual but also regal and definitive. She took another sip of her drink and looked at Draco. “If you must go, I’ll see you later, Draco.”
“Let me make this easy for you to understand,” she said with a saccharine voice. “He doesn’t want to see you anymore. He has come to his senses and realised that you-” She tapped a finger on his chest “-are not worth it. So forget about him, okay?”
"Salazar, Draco, quit being a baby," groaned Parkinson, looking at Harry. "Your problem now."
By the end, the cauldrons of all of them presented the rising silver vapour that Snape had mentioned, except for Ron’s, that kept spitting green sparks.
when Snape raised his wand and the next he was reliving a memory that wasn’t his but would become one of his worst too.

the cave,” protested Harry at his retreating back, only receiving a dismissive wave in answer.
“Ron, we had to leave the match,” said Hermione carefully, gesturing wildly when the ginger looked betrayed. “We had to, it was an emergency. Hagrid-”
Dumbledore smiled. “Indeed, he was. Arrived at the very end, and due to him many of his allies managed to escape tonight.” The man raised a finger. “Fortunately for us, Kingsley had been alerted of a break-in at the Ministry and arrived just in time, bringing several Aurors and Cornelius himself with him.”
Draco hadn’t written. Harry hadn’t expected him to. Hoped, yes, but not expected, not after the abrupt meeting in Diagon Alley he couldn’t stop thinking about. And so the lack of in-coming owls wasn’t surprising anymore, but it still made Harry feel uneasy.
,” repeated Sirius, raising a finger. “Listen here, you-"
And of course,
Very nervous to post this because writing kisses is still a new thing for me! Hoped you liked the chapter! I love reading your comments so please leave some, even if it's just saying hi. I'll see you on Thursday!
George nodded. “Oh, yeah. Terrible things, the O.W.L’s." He shook his head gravely. “Half our year had minor breakdowns."
“And you?” asked Lupin at the twins.
“The Department of Mysteries,” said Harry, jumping back to his feet. “What is in the Department of Mysteries?"
Ron and Harry walked back to the Quidditch field after lunch. Even after practising all morning, and not doing it badly at all according to Harry, the ginger was still nervous about practising with the team.
Ernie's face went red, and he opened and closed his mouth many times before blurting, "Look who's talking."
Draco’s expression was nothing but indifferent at first glance, but the hint of wariness in his silver eyes and the slight tension on his jaw gave him away. He returned Harry’s gaze, eyebrows raised as if expecting him to answer a question, then falling when he didn’t. “I must say,” he started, voice carefully neutral as he turned to look at Hermione. “Perhaps you should have given Harry a bit more of a warning.”
“I hear you,” said Harry, tugging at Draco’s hand to start walking again. But even then it took Draco a few more moments to start talking.
“Hullo,” greeted Goyle, dropping his containers on the table carelessly.
The door to the shop opened as two students walked out, the chiming of the bells on it drawing Draco’s attention away from Harry and towards the shop. He was just beginning to turn his head, and then he would notice the poster and grow silent, and it would be awkward for both of them-
Sirius seemed taken aback for a moment, but then he frowned. “Harry, you are not going to attack anyone."
idea."
“Well, try it."
Harry felt oddly glad for the
"Alright," said Harry, too tired to think about formalities. He gave the director one last nod before turning towards the door, but just before he left he was called by Dumbledore's calm voice.
Harry frowned. “Why?"
"Cheeky," said Draco, then turning towards Parkinson and raising his chin. "And you?"
Harry shrugged, looking around the class. Everyone seemed as confused as them, even Parkinson was starting to look a little pale. The only exception were Neville, whose gaze was fixed on a spot in the air, and Theodore Nott, who stood behind Goyle, looking at the carcass with a disgusted expression.
is back."
But there were times and places, and that didn’t seem like a conversation for a supply cupboard. And they still had time. “I guess muggles have some nice inventions, right?” he said instead, figuring they could start with that.
“There goes our trip to Honeydukes,” had muttered Draco later that day, looking sourly at the brimming Befuddlement Draught in his cauldron. Harry would have to thank Snape for passing Umbridge’s examination because Potions was really the only class where he could sit with Draco. Hagrid was still under examination, Defense was an obvious negative, and Slytherin and Gryffindor didn’t share anything else.
Luck. Just one potion. Harry opened the tattered book he had been given to page ten and felt his confidence waver. The pages were full of scribbles, markings and scratched words. Harry frowned, took one last look at Draco, and went to gather the ingredients.
Ron grimaced. “Maybe he is
Ron whistled. “You mean a lot of people, some I didn’t even know."
“Nice one, Hermione!”
the last place you should go in right now? Why did you-”
“That makes no sense."
Harry chuckled. "I know, it's just that I like doing things for him, or making him laugh-" Was he being sappy now? He didn't care, it was true. "I like seeing him happy, Hermione. He has
Draco snorted, making Smith bristle. “You have something to say?” said Smith defiantly, crossing his arms and standing up taller in an effort to look intimidating. From Draco’s amused face, he was failing quite badly.
"Sulky?" Harry looked towards the Slytherin table. Ron was right. Malfoy was brooding, picking at his food and barely responding to his friends' attempts to engage him in conversation. Goyle kept looking at him in concern as he ate, Zabini looked disapprovingly at his plate and Parkinson-
Hermione gasped. “Harry! You didn’t! They were just worried about you.”
Malfoy shook his head. "We are just friends.”
completed Harry by himself, and even as he nodded and told the blond he would wait, he found himself wishing he could do something about it. Draco loved his father and the thought of never seeing him again had to be painful.
“This one definitely isn’t,” mumbled Ron.
They were taking a walk by it, Harry having managed to invite him under the excuse of preparing for the Task.
“He just asked Fleur Delacour to the ball,” said Ginny, helping his brother down on a chair.
Hermione frowned. “What’s in the Hospital Wing?”
“He is
“Funny
“You would be surprised. Horace is a fine wizard, and it would do you well to remember that,” said Dumbledore with a chastising look. “Severus hasn’t been fired, he will be covering the Defense position this year. Horace is his replacement.”
“And I know you are one to keep your promises,” Draco cut him off and placed one pale hand on the door. “So
Harry naively dismissed the wrong feeling the words gave him, that added to the dread that had been growing within him the past months.
"He bet you wouldn't last five minutes in the Tournament," said Malfoy, voice posh as usual but fairly neutral.
For a moment they just stand there looking at each other, Harry’s hands holding Malfoy’s wrist against his chest, and the silence it’s comforting, it’s
More than an idea, Harry had many questions, some of them not even formulated. Perhaps what he wanted was an explanation, even if what he had seen left no room for excuses. And there were only two people he could think of that could give that to him. “You think I should talk to them?”
And Harry knew how much Draco cared about his family. He saw it in every letter he wrote, in the smiles when he read through the replies, in the gifts he sent to his mother. He couldn't just ask him to leave it all behind.
“That cursed vermin,” muttered Sirius. Harry looked at him, finding him unsurprisingly disgusted by Kreacher’s acts. But then his head whipped up again. “They are at the Ministry right now.”
“Good,” huffed Angelina. She pointed her thumb at the door in clear dismissal. “Now, get out of my face."
“The toad,” said Draco, stepping closer to Harry. “Can you?"
Fred, who wore the exact same suit but in blue, grinned too. "Yeah, why not invite him for dinner?"
“Harry, what the hell?” exclaimed Dean. “I have to tell Seamus."
The wolf howls quietly, yawns and closes its eyes again, and Harry can feel him breathing on his neck, can feel the rise and fall of his chest, slow and tranquil.
“Not sure of what you mean, Harry.” Draco stepped back. His grin said he knew exactly what he had done, but Harry couldn’t find it in himself to be angry and just rolled his eyes.
“It was Umbridge’s fault."
“Merlin's pants,” Ron said what everyone in the room was thinking.
“He does, Hermione, but,” Ron shrugged. “I don’t know, he's still his dad, and Draco- Merlin, he doesn’t deserve all this shit.”
"Actually, he is going with Parkinson," said Hermione, still looking at Harry.
Sirius made to bark again and Lupin sent him a warning look. “Don’t attract more attention, I’m not sure dogs are allowed here in the first place."
There was a sudden scream, stopping Harry’s words and making them turn towards the crowd, finding Viktor Krum wrestling with Cedric, punching him repeatedly while Cedric’s father and Fleur tried to push him away. Soon there were many many people from the crowd making their way down, trying to drag the two champions away from each other. Karkaroff started yelling, a scuffle breaking between the crowd.
“And Arthur Weasley too. What are you doing here, Arthur?” said the man with a brief sneer.
Draco tapped his tankard with a finger. “Is there another one?” he drawled, the tips of his ears slightly pink.
“He does now, yes.” The Headmaster seemed amused in his own distant way. “As you probably know, we are short of staff this year as well. We are here to persuade him to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.”
