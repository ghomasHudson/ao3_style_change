“Right,” Neville said, and ushered Draco to an armchair, where he sat, perfectly still, afraid of spilling the crushed crackers.
Want to saturate yourself in the songs I listened to while writing and all the historically-accurate early 2000s music referenced and also look at a graphic/cover I made?
The Sorting passed quickly. Harry didn’t even notice who was sorted into his own house. That was Hagrid’s job, anyway; he was the Head of Gryffindor.
“Wait, wait,” Harry said, beckoning him closer. Now that they were closer to the ground he could attempt broom-surfing.
Sirius was about to respond when he realized that might be contradictory to the order. He downed the whiskey. Remus would have been able to explain it better. At least he had a calming voice. And he didn’t really ramble. He was efficient. Sirius bit at his pinky nail.
Andromeda poured the tea and set it on the table. The Black armor was too heavy, so she set it aside and said in her ordinary voice, “You couldn’t lurk in doorways at Grimmauld because darling Auntie Walburga had enchanted them all and you’d come out in boils unless you went through rather quickly.”
“Oh,” he said. “I’m not sure.” He blinked. He’d always done the Weasley’s for Christmas Eve and Andromeda and Teddy for Christmas morning. Why hadn’t he just said that?
He might be weird-looking and scarred and not really aware of wizard fashion, but Luna had said he looked amazing and it suited his aura, so, yeah. Fuck that. He was proud of being desi. Of being bi. Of having his dad’s unruly black hair and his mum’s luminous and short-sighted eyes.
Harry hadn’t seen Ron and Hermione for weeks—she was in the middle of a massive trial and sent him a regretful note on the back of what turned out to be an important piece of paperwork that he’d had to return, and Ron was in Dublin for a three-week international magical policing seminar—and their absence was starting to grate on him. There wasn’t anyone else who knew him as well as they did. He’d grown close to Padma in the last few weeks, but she and Addie had (finally!) kissed and were inseparable. Everyone else was too old or spent their weekends away from the castle.
He finally saw Draco at dinner in the Great Hall on New Year’s Eve. He seemed a bit paler than usual, but maybe it was just the voluminous ink-black robes he’d drawn tightly around himself.
It wasn’t all good. God, there were so many nightmares. Screaming and crying and they were all a bit fucked up. But they were all there, together, and they made it through.
P.S. "Splat the Rat" is a traditional fête game that tests the reaction speed of participants. It has historical precedents dating back to the 3rd century, when it was colloquially known as occīdōte mūrem. I can give you a citation, if necessary.
“Merlin, no!” he gasped. He grabbed a nearby cup of tea, chugged some, and shook his head. “God, no, he’s just super affectionate with us. He can’t express much emotion at work.”
He started swinging back and forth, then somehow lifted himself up onto his broom. Then he was throwing himself forwards, spinning around his broom (how was this even possible, fuck, his shirt had ridden up), and now he was doing fucking pull ups (he had arms, too? Large arms?), panting out, “Is that enough for you, Potter?” before hanging upside down with his shirt hanging in his face. Harry was clinging to his broom, trying to keep his breathing steady. Just a bit of collegial exercise. Nothing to get too excited about.
Romilda Vane began brewing love potions while at Hogwarts, in what she now says was an “extremely misguided at best, and potentially abusive, misunderstanding of the power of chemically-induced manipulation of desire.” In our interview last month at Vane’s laboratory, she shuddered after this sentence. “It could have gone so, so badly.”
“I thought this was close enough to a non-magical coat,” he protested, looking down at his long black woolen robes.
“Think the house—er, fuck, sorry, just elves—would do up some more scones for me?” Harry nodded, and gestured to the bellpull by the fire. Ten minutes later, Ron had another plateful of scones and a cup of tea, Harry had a piece of treacle tart with cream, and they had settled in for a plotting session.
Draco was looking towards the window. “I came across it as part of my research into immigration into wizarding Britain before the nineteenth century.”
I choose the homosexual plants project, even though you did not really explain what it would entail. It is far more interesting than the others. Also, I would like your old copies of the
“Blaise,” Neville said, and wrapped him in his arms, pressing his forehead against Blaise’s. “You are a wonderful human who happens to be super funny and bizarre and I love how you like salty licorice and want to save all the alley cats and the way you kiss my left shoulder when I’m driving and the way that when I’m in bed with you, I feel like everything in the world is going to be fine, whether it’s because we just had amazing sex or you farted in my face—”
“Well, we certainly didn’t want him.” Remus glared back at Harry. “We didn’t think we could handle trying to reintegrate him into society. But it’s necessary. We can’t just let him sit in Azkaban forever.”
Of course you’d be unable to look away from your teenage nemesis, especially if said nemesis had grown up to be six three and was currently wearing platform boots and a sequined jacket.
He turned to the CD player and gave it a thump. “I was just listening to this band you might like,” Harry said. And then he remembered what they were called. “Here, listen,” he said, and skipped tracks to get to ‘Stacked Crooked.’
Lavender was too drunk to be extra polite, so she raised her eyebrows and poured her way too much. It began to bubble over the top when Parvati made a kind of noise in the back of her throat and the champagne immediately stopped bubbling as intensely.
The new plan regarding Malfoy was to act normal. To treat him like any other colleague. Well, not like Mervyn, who Harry actively avoided because the older wizard was a bit like Trelawney in his insistence on Harry’s current endangerment and mutterings about Fate and Star-Crossed Lovers Intertwining, whatever that meant. But like Addie. Or Padma. Well, maybe Padma was a bit too close. He and Malfoy would never be that close. But they did get to the point where sitting next to each other at meals didn’t start any disasters or spur Harry to drink more heavily than usual—God, maybe he should give up drinking—but they weren’t close.
“Lord,” Astoria said with a sigh. She grabbed a napkin, went over to Draco, smiled in greeting, brushed the crumbs into the napkin. “They’re crackers.”
Harry narrowed his eyes and shook his head. “You have a crush on Addie, Padma, and that doesn’t excuse the rest of them. Well, Khan is fine. He’s older. He’s also not white or a pureblood, so he’s practically guaranteed to be at least half decent. But Malfoy—”
He flicked his wand at Draco and the enchantments ended. Draco immediately began massaging his wrist. He was such a drama queen, Harry thought irritatedly. He hadn’t bound him tight enough to hurt even a bit.
Sirius rubbed his forehead. “I’m not—I’m not fucking—on his side or whatever, but it’s a fucking legal nightmare. Andromeda’s got him under the highest form of wards at her cottage up near Newcastle and—”
She wasn’t sure she’d ever get used to the brass plaque screwed into the oak door. When the chair showed her around the department on her first day, Hermione hadn’t actually read the names on the plaques and had just assumed that it was a holdover from 1909—not that they were updated and engraved with the current faculty’s name. It made sense, once you thought about it, because what would be the point of labeling offices with the names of long dead men, but at the same time, the cryptic workings of the London Institute of Magical Studies wouldn’t have surprised her.
“That,” Audrey said, almost reassembling the piece so they could see its original form, “is a sacred amulet of Priapus.”
At this point, the only way to break the magical, physical, and legal bonds of this sanguine marriage contract (TSMC) as specified in said contract are as follows:
I apologize that I could not find the correct button to make the accent in your last name. I do not want to be rude.
Without any word of warning, Malfoy tilted to one side and fell off his broom, but before he could fall, he caught it with one hand. Harry, shocked into clutching his broom again, watched as Malfoy grabbed it with his other hand.
He thrust out the napkin with the sandwich inside. Malfoy took it and padded over to his desk to unwrap it.
“Ah,” Draco said and dropped the pestle into the mortar. Neville started at the thud. “I thought I was being subtle.”
“Draco said he had to go,” Andromeda said, a pinched look on her face. “He said he wasn’t feeling well.”
Hermione nodded. She really didn’t want to get into the prison reform debate which like, they were on the same side of, but she was more interested in Harry’s feelings than policy right now. She rubbed her temples and wished Ron was there. Ron always knew what to ask to get right to the crux of the issue. But Harry was here, not at their house or Wheeze’s, which she didn’t know if that meant something, but like, they were here. So she had to deal with it.
were filled with Marcus applying to thousands of jobs while Oliver trained as hard as ever for the Montrose Magpies. At least Marcus can cheer for the Magpies now! But we started seriously thinking about what we wanted to do with our lives. Obviously flying would be involved, but what else?!
They saw the Oliver-Winger home, dark and quiet among the snowdrifts. Creeping up on the left side, Draco stopped abruptly. Harry bumped his chin into the back of Draco’s head and cursed.
“I believe a DJ will invite certain styles of dancing that are definitely not appropriate, Headmaster.”
She came back to the conversation gradually to find them discussing Quidditch, so she zoned out again and returned to her own thoughts.
Luna had done the colorful murals: clouds and sunsets and rainbows and branches of magical plants, reaching and floating across the walls. Couches and chairs huddled together in little seating areas. Then there were the tables, stacked high with papers and files, and down the hall, the rooms that would one day be offices and a kitchen. The toilet was already there, and Florian smirked as he remembered the hot plumber whose mild flirty banter had so flustered Harry they’d suddenly remembered a pressing appointment and fled.
“Oh, no, it’s fine,” Blaise said in a bright voice. The goddamn steel ribbing he’d woven around his heart had failed once again. He stared down at his tea. Things had been so good? And now they were fucked? And it was definitely, kind of one hundred percent his fault because he was probably overreacting again, but maybe he wasn’t because it was Draco, so like, how could anyone compete with that kind of cut glass beauty?
“I’ll beat his tiny snake ass, too,” she said and glared at the letter. “I don’t know if it’s tiny, technically, and the snake was metaphorical, you know, because I don’t know what a snake ass would look like on a human, because a snake has a tail, but you know, Slytherin’s symbol—”
“Oh, no, I don’t want to come in, thanks, though, Andromeda,” he said as she opened the door, her eyebrows drawn together. She shouted back up the stairs and tried to hustle Neville inside the cottage, but Neville resisted because he’d not be put on the backfoot, not in this first meeting with Malfoy.
“It’s good to have examples. God, can you imagine Minerva demonstrating the general principle behind a dildo?”
He urged his broom higher and then went into a spinning nose dive he’d perfected during lazy summer Quidditch matches at the Burrow. Malfoy flew down beside him (quite a bit slower, obviously).
“If he even insinuates that my curriculum is unnecessary or if he steps one toe out of line, I’m not holding back, Minerva. Things have changed.” He slammed his hand down on the table again. The noise echoed throughout the Great Hall. A lone elf polishing the crest on the fireplace squeaked.
“They said I have to stay here with you,” he said, slipping the iPod back into his robes. “Every time I leave the room, you go back into a coma.”
“It’s proof that wizards are probably inferior,” Draco said. “Definitely not superior or more intelligent or creative or whatever the fuck Voldemort and my father and I thought for so fucking long.”
“I read a theory that Voldemort probably would have lived longer if he hadn’t tried to, you know. Live forever.”
Ednie, the elected representative of the Hogwarts Elf Union, raised a thin finger and said in a high voice. “Owain’s right. Cabbage Roll Thursday had to be scrapped!”
Ron just smirked and leaned back. He put one muscled arm around Hermione and whispered into her hair. She smacked him in the side and shot an apologetic glance at Harry.
“Anyway, since these students could clearly use someone who has more than half a brain to guide them through the complicated process of coming out in magical society—”
Draco tilted his head. “Yes. That was covered in module three of Respecting the Non-Magical World. I understand the concept. We also discussed homosexuality.”
it was actually nev’s choice, so u can blame him. we’re going dancing after obvs so practice your moves don’t want to let down the honor of slytherin lol bet salazar had some sickkkkk moves
“I hope it goes well,” they said. “I think I’ve explained everything that’s in there to Draco. No need to bring it back when you’re done. It’ll be better used at a school.”
Perry broke in. “Professor Malfoy also told us about how they wouldn’t let women go on stage so all the roles were played by men and some people think Christopher Marlowe actually wrote the plays, but he said that’s a load of rubbish.”
The next three weeks were absolute torture. Draco seemed to be actively avoiding him and would duck out of rooms whenever Harry entered them. It was like the beginning of the year. Harry felt like his skin was crawling off with the amount of longing that he was doing. Padma teased him endlessly. Even Addie had joined in, ribbing him that he was only avoiding Draco because he wasn’t sure if he could keep his hands off him.
Malfoy pursed his lips. “‘An’ is the correct article, Potter.” He raised his eyebrows and shrugged. “And I always thought it would be great fun to be a dandy, between the powdered wigs, silk waistcoats, and the rotten teeth and gout. Of course, you’d know all about this, given how the latter two weren’t understood by Muggles until well into the twentieth century.”
“You gonna be ok?” Neville’s voice was soft and full of concern. Blaise smiled and nodded. It was all fine, fine, fine.
Malfoy rose quickly and stormed out of the room the minute it was over. He had abandoned his quill, Harry noticed, picking it up and twirling it in his fingers. The minutes were unfinished. Harry pulled the book towards him and scratched in:
Astoria nodded but her eyes were so hard to hold open. Maybe it would be easier if she just shut them for a minute. And then—
Draco made a few wand movements and the exterior wards became visible, shimmering gently in the dark night.
Harry stopped, his hands tangled in his own hair. The perfect plan for revenge uncoiled in his mind.
The timer broke the comfortable Sunday morning silence reigning around the dining room table. Remus jerked and dropped his pen.
Percy leaned forward and rubbed his hands together. “Exactly, the book was all about forgiveness and the ability for people to change, which I think—"
“Oh my god,” Florian said and groaned. He’d never understand how you just like, forgot that you could do magic and fix whatever you wanted in your environment or move shit or anything. Well, it made more sense with Harry, but Ron?
“Honestly, she’s like an overeager Crup,” Draco continued. “Do you think she even knows what Unforgivables are?”
The dining room was filled with purple smoke. Harry stumbled out of the cloud, dragging Draco by the hand, and choked, “It just went off.”
Then it was Halloween. Since Harry’s schooldays, the Halloween feast had taken on a more mischievous quality as students attempted to prank their professors and the ghosts (a futile enterprise, since they were incorporeal and generally ignored the students) and neck in about every dark alcove. Nearly-Headless Nick floated into through Harry’s desk during his second-year class on the varieties of Muggle currency and invited Harry to his Death Day party in a drone that was barely audible over the chaos his sudden appearance caused.
it’s coconut shy, not shy coconuts, nerd. i don't know if u can act high and mighty about games u tried so hard to splat the rat. also i actually have a strong emotional attachment to that coconut, so i’d really prefer it to a bottle of mass-produced spirit. you could return it to me on the 28 when u come to me and nev’s birthday which starts at 7 at the spoons just around the corner from diagon alley.
Harry let himself drift away again before he lost his poker face. Blink. Addie was pushing for a scholarship fund for gold cauldrons, which were required for many N.E.W.T.s potions. Harry voted in favor. He’d wanted a gold cauldron once. Hagrid hadn’t let him. He couldn’t imagine Snape’s face if tiny eleven-year-old Potter had rolled up with a solid gold cauldron.
Draco assisted me in collecting botanical samples for herbological studies, for my own academic studies and for others who requested samples. This was largely manual labor (digging, hiking, walking, hauling, crawling, camping, pruning, etc.). This was difficult for Draco at first, who seemed to be suffering from a combination of malnutrition and PTSD, but I realized this and tried to adjust our activities. Gradually, he was able to work his way up to more intense hiking, hauling, and chopping. I prefer not to use magic while collecting, as human-related magical spikes can disturb botanical magical networks, so there wasn’t a great shift in our activities after Draco got his wand back. He seemed most interested in the magical effects or abilities of plants, rather than the processes of collecting, which is hardly surprising, given what I knew of him at Hogwarts (not a field work bloke, no slight on him personally, just … a different type of personality). Magical plants
Filius clapped his hands and cups of steaming coffee appeared. Malfoy fell upon his and downed it in two gulps. Harry could barely stomach the thought of a hot drink. His face was going to slide right off.
“For Draco? Make him a sandwich.” Before he could protest, she laughed and said, “He wants someone to come looking for him. Might as well be you, Potter, since you’re the one who put his nose out of joint.”
3, we floo’d to Australia to witness the birth of our goddaughter, Artemis Weasley, to proud parents Angelina and Frederick Weasley. 8 pounds and 2 ounces of pure joy! We’ve already been instructed to tell everyone
The questions kept coming and coming and Harry hoped Draco was timing the event, because he’d abandoned Sirius’s organizer in his room and then he zoned back in and realized the panel was talking about how they knew they were in love.
He was looking odd again, Andromeda thought. Maybe she shouldn’t have sprung this on him before he went off to do something important.
“You’re proving my theory about the physical strain of transforming,” he said when he’d pushed Sirius back down.
Twenty minutes later, he was tucked into bed, with Kreacher and Winky flurrying about him and a Malfoy draped across his armchair.
Neville’s heart was in his mouth, but Draco just pulled an envelope towards him, decanted the powder into it, and refilled the mortar.
September first dawned bright and cold. Harry pulled back the drapes from the window and stared out across the Black Lake, reflecting the crisp blue of the sky. It was the first time he’d woken up on September first already at Hogwarts. A tingle of anticipation ran down his spine. His first year as a professor.
Lavender pressed her back against the pilaster. The voice rose louder and louder. She should fucking step away from the stone. She was too good at talking to it, but she didn’t trust her legs to hold up on their own.
The deception you revealed to me via the means of this image manipulation program presents a serious threat to society, on par with the unregulated use and distribution of Polyjuice. Perhaps even worse, as this photographic deception process is far simpler than brewing Polyjuice. Are non-magical persons considering laws against this type of image tampering? The gorilla is one thing, but I can imagine far more nefarious uses.
“Just, uh, Andromeda,” Neville said, slowly moving his hands to his sides. “Just something like, he can hike in. I’ll go grab some boots from the shed.”
"Scientists are chill people,” he said, clearly still thinking about the floss, which he ran off and returned with (it’s three inches in diameter, folks, not something you can buy at your local Boots).
“Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Harry wasn’t about to admit that he didn’t know that about Ron nor did he know their Muggle address. He’d have to send a quick thank-you-and-please-help-me-get-one-over-Malfoy-before-he-realizes-I’m-an-idiot owl now. And they’d just gotten back. Christ, was Malfoy always going to be like this?
Probably because that murder reminded him too much of his own goddamn life, Harry almost shot back, but he bit his lip. “Ok, well, let’s try something different.” He levitated copies of the play towards them. “Everyone take a copy and we’ll do a read through—Perry, you’re Hamlet for the first and second act, and Shuo, you’re Hamlet from the third to fifth; Justin, Ophelia; Elspeth, Gertrude; Britney, Claudius; Isla, Polonius; Oscar, Laertes; I’ll hand out the rest of the parts as they come up. I’ll do the stage directions.”
“I’ve tried to atone but know it will never be enough. If you don’t think I’d be a positive influence on the students, I accept that.”
Harry attempted to stare straight forward and look to his left to watch Malfoy at the same time. It was giving him a headache. Malfoy didn’t seem to be doing anything too untoward yet, just seducing people with his fake personality and his shiny hair. And worse, Malfoy wasn’t wearing a hat. His hatlessness was breaking the rules already. He intended to mention this to Padma, but she was staunchly ignoring him in favor of Hagrid and Flobberworms. Dinner and Minerva’s speech passed in a blur. He stood and waved when introduced (did he really need an introduction?), as did Malfoy. There was applause for him and for Malfoy, which seemed a bit insane. Only one of them had saved the wizarding world.
Bastian Khan, seated in the row in front of them, broke his grip on the edge of the box to turn around and look at Malfoy. “Draco, for Merlin’s sake, we’ve discussed this.  That little Fortescue heir is wrapped around your finger. Don’t be coy and don’t make me miss something.” He turned back around, waving a hand so that a silencio charm separated them.
To get the job, she’d had to endure a twelve-hour interview that included a foxtrot with the assistant dean and a demonstration of her best porcupine-to-pincushion—which, despite all her protestations regarding the callous abuse of transfiguring sentient beings without their consent—had been a hiring requirement since 1643. And she’d checked with the special collections librarian about that on her first day as an actual faculty member because if it was hazing, that kind of nonsense had to stop, and yep, written into the magically-binding hiring language was a demonstration of said transfiguration.
“I’ve never even seen that one before.” Harry was trying the swallow the lump in his throat. “Where’d you find it?”
at buzzy new eatery Larunda. Over chicken salad, Potter divulged their latest plans for the latest paradigm shift in the wizarding world.
How did you insert an image into your message? Is that a real gorilla wearing a tutu? How do non-magical persons control animals like gorillas without suffering bodily harm? What are “interwebz” and why is there a z? Is it Czech?
again,” Britney said in a conciliatory tone, examining her split ends. “We didn’t really discuss the themes or literary content in depth, so, like, there’s a lot still to be said about such a rich play.” Elspeth looked disgruntled. Harry knew there was an essay about Shakespeare on the O.W.L., and he didn’t trust Malfoy’s interpretation of the Bard.
Audrey beamed and tucked a strand of her whitish-grey hair behind one ear. Here wand was sticking out of a messy bun.
Harry started feeling remorseful three hours later. What if Malfoy hadn’t figured it out fast enough to refuse? And Harry hadn’t touched him, but there was that frission. That tension. They hadn’t talked about the gay thing since those awkward conversations weeks ago. Maybe Malfoy thought Harry was making fun of him. Waiting to dangle it over his head somehow. Use it against him.
Sirius looked shocked. The girl with the big hair—who’d grown into a woman wearing a tweed blazer—was holding a large black tome. Hestia? Hernia? Irrelevant.
Harry’s head shot up. “No,” they said, “I assumed he would be but, well, I don’t know.” They leaned against the bar and slowly rotated the glass. “He, er, came to Conciliatio with Nev, and he’s still on parole, so he’s got to take this non-magical studies class but like, he discovered the internet, and, look, he brought me my coconut back.”
“Right,” Ron said, putting down his scone. This was serious. “So, she’s super proud of being a lesbian, right, and she doesn’t care if people ask stupid questions, and she knows a lot about tantric sex magic.”
Two and a half hours later, Lavender had collapsed onto a horsehair couch (slippery motherfucker) and threw her legs over the arm.
He was at the Ottery St. Catchpole fête for fucks’ sake. This was no place to be mentally undressing a stranger. Well, somewhat stranger. Vague acquaintance?
Padma rolled her eyes at Harry and handed him a pumpkin juice. “Drink up, sweetheart. The dungeons are going to be popping if it’s anything like last year. They think they can get into my Amortentia.” Addie giggled at the last word and Padma shrugged. “They’re all idiots who want to find true love. As if anyone knows who they’re meant to be with when they’re fourteen.”
Ron shook his head and licked the chocolate drips from his fingers. People from big families ate so quickly.
“It’s not a spiritual or moral thing. It’s proteins and shit. Some people have tiny bits of stuff that sticks out differently and then you have magic. That’s not a choice or a thing you can be proud about. We didn’t do anything to get it.”
Hermione kissed his shoulder. “We both do.” She straightened. “I’ll leave you two to discuss recipes. I need another tea.”
Just another thing to bring up at a faculty meeting, Hermione sighed, to which Magdala Pomfrey (a cousin of Poppy’s, as it turned out, which Magdala had revealed with a twinkle in her eye that said that there was no wizarding HIPAA) had offered her full archival support and research capabilities. Just earlier that day, Hermione had added the 107th item to that list (“frogs migrating up 3rd floor women’s bathroom sink???”) and slammed it back into her desk drawer.
Malfoy didn’t seem to expect an answer but rose and nodded to Harry and shut the door gently after himself.
Draco’s eyes lit up as he gestured to different items and Starr tried to gauge how to describe it in an age-appropriate terms. Thirty minutes later, Harry was taking a nap on the couch in the changing room. Draco and Starr had it under control.
“I’m just,” Harry started chewing on their lip, “He was racist to Remus at school, and I don’t want him to make Remus sad or anything, not at Christmas.”
Wait, wait, Harry could totally spin this. Sure, he wasn’t jacked by any means, but Hogwarts wasn’t exactly bursting with potential dating opportunities or men under fifty with at least one abdominal muscle, so he could work with this. And, as he’d reviewed before, he got laid. Whenever he wanted. Yeah. He could work this.

“We could, you know, go shopping together,” Harry found himself saying. “So we don’t get the same things. For Teddy. We could go down to London or something and do a magical and Muggle shop—I always try to get him some of each—and God, we could get you to a Muggle bookstore so you’d shut up and stop bothering me about the Tana whatever her name is …”

“And then for Christmas dinner, we were going to have Andromeda and Draco over, because he’s allowed to come to Grimmauld. Kreacher, of course. I think Ot—er, Nils, right—mentioned that he’s working on an extension of Narcissa’s probationary perimeter, but,” Sirius shrugged, "it wouldn’t be a great tragedy if it were just the five of us. Or six, if you wanted to come.”
“We must have misunderstood part of the counterspell, which meant that the contract was still active when you gave Susan the ring,” Hermione said. Her hand was so cool around Astoria’s. Astoria smiled at her.
She raised an eyebrow. “He’s coming to the middle of nowhere to see you. You. And do sexual things to and with you. I hardly think the decor is going to be high on his list of desires.
The day after the Ball, the students left for the Christmas holidays and a blessed silence settled over the castle. Christmas Eve itself dawned grey and snowy. Harry spent the day fiddling with wrapping paper and wishing he could at least enchant things to be neat. They loved him and it wouldn’t matter, he told himself.
He rubbed some of Andre’s grandmother’s pomade on his hands and ran them through his hair, pulling up a few chunks while wiggling a bit to the Gorillaz song stuck in his head.
Harry had guessed correctly that this would only infuriate Draco further, as the blond man drew himself up and then began hissing sibilant French words, rather like an angry little goose.
“Yes, Headmaster,” Draco said smoothly, sending out paper geminios around the table with a list of his proposed changes.
“I thought I could paint your nails,” Lavender said. Astoria smiled at her. “I brought you green, pale pink, and a nice ochre since it’s October.”
The roast was, of course, magnificent. Ron had spent the summer after eighth year at the Molly Weasley School of Cookery, and while he rarely had time during the week, his weekend dinners and brunches were the best British food Harry’d ever eaten, Hogwarts elves and Molly included. There were crispy potatoes (“Goose fat,” Ron insisted, serving Malfoy seconds), carrots and parsnips, buttery peas, fresh rolls, salty butter, good hearty ale (Harry had waited for Malfoy to wrinkle his nose and demand wine, but he complimented the beer twice. Twice.), and to round it off, treacle tart with fresh whipped cream.
He pulled a rack of toast towards himself and began eating steadily and voraciously, pouring copious amounts of ketchup over his scrambled eggs and fried tomato. None of the other young professors came to the Great Hall for breakfast, preferring tea sent to their rooms, but Harry loved a full English.
Draco sighed. “Potter, your father’s family is old wizarding blood. And rich, too, after Fleamont’s inventions.”
“One, Blaise said a necklace cursed with some kind of sexual spell was stolen from the Oliver-Winger residence last night. Two, he was alerted to this around six in the evening, but the family first noticed it had gone missing around five. Three, he and Ronald arrived on the scene at six-thirty, boring police questions were asked, etc., the full details to which I am not privy.”
Relative (Andromeda Tonks, aunt; father Lucius Abraxas Malfoy is serving the remainder of his fifty-three year sentence in Azkaban; mother Narcissa Black Malfoy last heard of in France, but the Société de police magique have reported nothing new to DMLE as OP reported during this meeting, the client made no reaction to this statement; remind OP that he should notify me of these things in advance of our three-way meetings)
Malfoy cleared his throat. He seemed to be looking away? Harry could guess that it was his profile. His expression was a blur. His entire body was a blur. God, he was going to have to put his glasses back on.
He seemed to have retreated to somewhere in his mind and curled up a bit more in his chair. “Thanks for the sandwich, Potter.”
Then the beat of Akon’s ‘Smack That’ filled the air and Malfoy turned beet red. He hustled away from Harry and fell upon on two unsuspecting Hufflepuffs who’d gotten a bit too grindy, hitting them with a quick bubble spell. Malfoy’s neck was bright red.
against the dark arts for a reason,” she said, glaring at the fireplace. “For far too long it was about learning the dark arts, under the guise that knowledge was power against them. But it’s not! All evil things work in fundamentally the same way! You don’t need years of education to know that!”
“Oh,” Padma said in a casual tone. “Was it that he proved his loyalty to the Death Eaters after failing to murder Dumbledore by killing Greg Goyle’s suicidal one-hundred-and-ninety-four-year-old Squib grandfather who’d been abandoned by the rest of the family after his witch wife died? Or was it how he used his inheritance to establish an anti-war charity named after the Creevey brothers?” Padma paused and narrowed her eyes at him. “Don’t tell anyone else that. I accidentally opened one of his owls. The man who runs the charity has atrocious handwriting.”
The dungeons were fairly quiet, just a few giggling couples shooed off towards their dorms by a fatigued Padma, who, thirty minutes into patrol, was rummaging through her classroom drawers for a sobering potion. Harry drank half and felt his senses sharpening.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Pansy is a very close friend who I would never, ever sleep with for a variety of reasons, including that her family has absolutely no money, she lives in London throughout the entire year, even summers, and she thinks hot yoga cures everything.” He paused and shuddered. “It’s disgusting. All that sweating.”
“Er, ok,” Ron said, glancing back at the judges. They each had a forkful of cake. It was approaching their mouths.
“You alright, mate?” Neville was starting to look a bit concerned. He bent and grabbed Draco’s shovel and hoisted the two of them over his shoulder. “We’ve got to get a move on. The floreated hawkbit’s only going to be effusing this morning, so, shift it.”
“Sticky notes,” Harry said with an air of resignation. Draco had traveled the wizarding world but was still like a fawn in the muggle one.
Harry’s mind was buzzing with a soft static. Words seemed impossible. This pain was nothing like the sharp Horcrux pain. This was more like suffocating. White feathers filled his mouth.
“Yeah, but you’re out there fighting against blood supremacy and racism and homophobia and I’m like, scared to tell my parents I like girls and I teach at my old college.”
Audrey summoned four cups of tea and settled in on the floor, leaning her cheek against her husband’s knee.
Malfoy shook hands with Filius and Pomona and looked down the table, nodding at each professor in turn—he knew them from the interview, the rat bastard—until he got to Harry. Malfoy’s smile went a bit stiff and then broadened. Harry gave him a quick two-fingered salute and then turned to his roasted sprouts.
Lavender pushed herself off the pilaster and held a hand out. It was gripped firmly by the man hovering by Parvati’s elbow. His dark hair was slicked back. He looked like a fucking weightlifter. In a classy way. It was probably the unbuttoned Oxford.
Draco waved his hand again. “A momentary shock of genius. You must have briefly channeled the spirit of Oscar Wilde.”
Harry laughed. Was he the heir? He should probably look into that. He’d gotten occasional letters from the company, but he could have sworn his grandfather had sold it when he retired.
“Really?” Talbott said. “You broke into our home without even adequately researching my wife?” Harry noticed that he didn’t even mention himself as a threat. Somehow this flower-bedecked, blue-lipstick-wearing, chubby middle-aged woman in a pink and lavender muumuu was more of a threat than the Head Auror?
Eventually, Harry said his goodbyes and flooed back to Hogwarts. He went to his quarters. He left his presents in a pile on his desk. He went down to Draco’s door. He knocked. There was no response. Harry could feel a muffliato pushing against the door.
For some reason, this irritated Harry. He wanted to say something cutting, but then he remembered the mission of Operation Sandwich, which was to see if Malfoy was alright (he was) and perhaps ask for forgiveness (which didn’t seem like such a pressing issue anymore).
And now Malfoy was coming to his room and he hadn’t decided upon a single move that would reveal Malfoy’s innermost thoughts—well, just the ones regarding his syllabus and lesson planning for the rest of term—without Harry having to go too far and actually having to kiss him or something even more odious.
“No one’s ever ready for this shit, mate,” Sirius said, doing his usual skate across the darker feelings with mateyness, but his voice had a warmth and gravity Harry seemed to appreciate.
Teddy gave him a suspicious look before whispering something to his new stuffed dragon and handing Harry his broom. They traipsed back down the hall towards the kitchen.
Turning around the corner, still humming the Gorillaz ‘Feeling Good Inc.,’ he smacked directly into someone who’d been lurking just around the corner.
Malfoy exhaled slowly. “It’s an abbreviation of Doctor Magicorum, or doctor of magic. The word magic is plural, but it doesn’t really translate well into English. Magics? Doctor of magics? See, it sounds awful.” He paused for a moment. “I’m not surprised you never learned Latin, but frankly, for anyone with a magical education, it should be mandatory.”
“Why not?” Harry shot back, confused. “Half those kids grew up Muggle! It’s their culture to have a DJ! Not a dumb singer like Celestia Warbeck or some washed-up fucks like the Weird Sisters! They played at our Yule Ball. In 1994. It’s 2006.”
was okay. Whoever said April was the cruelest month didn’t have to live through the coldest March on record with no good flying days. In
The rest of the evening passed unremarkably. Harry acted surprised when Ron pulled out his portable wizard chess set and tried to keep his mind on the game.
“I do not fucking—I was saying you suck ass at Quidditch—fuck you—you’re impossible. Get your mind out of the gutter.” Harry balled his fists up. He was trying to be an adult here, and then he just catapulted back to his irate schoolboy self. Ready to fight. Ready to hit harder, give worse. Malfoy was such a fucking idiot.
“Oh, right, so that’s Blaise, Nev’s boyfriend,” Blaise gave a wave, then retreated to Neville’s shoulder—
Talbott shot Harry an amused look. “Darling, not everyone has the affinity you do for dark magic tempered by a stubborn unwillingness to give into it.”
“Yeah,” Harry said and sucked his cheeks in. “Like, half the time he doesn’t know shit about anything, like, doesn’t know what a jam roly-poly is because Luna brought one last time, but instead of being a judgmental dick about it, he writes it down in this notebook.”
“What a good influence you are, Potter.” Draco smiled and turned his attention. “Happy birthday, Miss Alina. I’ve brought you a potions book.”
He and Ron stared at each other for a few beats longer than socially acceptable. Hermione cleared her throat.
But it wasn’t nevermind, really, Susan realized, because she was entwining her long fingers through Susan’s unruly hair and dropping her chin down onto Susan’s shoulder and reading the letter.
“You feel bad?” Hermione couldn’t keep the incredulity out of her voice. “You spoke on Malfoy’s behalf on his trial and made a huge deal out of the fact that he lied about recognizing you at the Manor, which, like, was it really a mistake because you looked fucked up, and he was an accomplice to torture, and like, Harry—”
Hermione shot Ron a Look and continued, “I think the war really changed him and if you’ve read his book—”
But Draco moved a bit too fast for Harry’s leg, and the hood of the invisibility cloak caught on his neck before the rest of his body could catch up, and then he was falling, pushing Draco to the ground accidentally as they were tangled up in a cursing, yelping heap.
Eight hours later, Harry was bumping Jeezy’s ‘Soul Survivor’ in an attempt to irritate Malfoy before he even arrived. Sure enough, when Draco opened the door, an expression of distaste crossed his face before it settled into a bland mask.
Andromeda curled her hand into a fist. She pressed the knuckle of her index finger against her lips.
Draco took a deep breath. “Your family has always been well-regarded and rather rich, and then they became famous after Fleamont's successes, so there’s usually a file on them in archives.”
“Well,” Susan said, holding her arms out until Astoria deviated from her journey towards the fireplace and hugged her, “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll fight Malfoy for your hand.”
“Oh, very single,” Potter says with a cheerful smile. “I’m really good at third-wheeling.” Magical readers take note: this is a reference to a bicycle, a non-magical two-wheeled human-powered vehicle—a third wheel isn’t necessary! Don’t worry, Harry, we think you’re totally necessary!
Neville raised an eyebrow at him and he bit his bottom lip, then said in a sudden rush, “I’ve always liked potions.”
He’d almost slipped and said, ‘just ask him,’ but he saved himself. He shouldn’t assume. But it was Justin. It was totally Justin.
He reached one small hand out, and one of the glowing animals bowed its head and sniffed his pudgy fingers.
Blaise tapped his microphone and said, “That goes for you too, gay kids. No condom, no dice. Many STIs can be cured, but some can’t. Wizards haven’t come up with anything better than a good muggle rubber, so use them.”
A hand crept into the air. Cho stared at the student for a minute, who looked a bit like Terry Boot, then inclined her head.
“I feel like I just got over my hangover from New Year’s,” Harry laughed. “You’re beating me, that’s for sure.”
Harry chortled and then was brought up short by a thought. “Wait, isn’t her husband the Head Auror?”
Jason glanced down at his cake and then back up at Ron. “I love anything with chocolate, but that’s kind of basic, so if you don’t—”
“Ah, yes, yes,” Sirius said. “Endlessly distracting, you are, Moony. I hold you entirely responsible for the Troll mark I received in the Divination O.W.L.”
“Let’s start with the panel, alright,” Harry said with a murderous glare at Malfoy. He’d reverted to Malfoy, the malicious bastard who liked to drag him into these awkward situations.
Andromeda raised an eyebrow at this statement, but didn’t say anything—it was going to be like the dogs, she’d decided, just ignore any statements of prejudice or hatred so as not to reward bad behavior, and hope that he’d get into those damn classes fast enough to realize that the world was very, very different and then whenever he said something decent or at the least politically correct, she’d give him the human equivalent of a treat—but then the eyebrow had been a reaction, so she let the Black armor drop back into place for a moment or two of awkward silence.
“Er,” Neville said, then conferred with Draco for a few moments in whispers. Astoria couldn’t quite hear, but there didn’t seem to be much of a back and forth, because Draco was just nodding along, his eyes drawn again and again to—oh, Harry.
Before Draco could respond, the student piped up again with, “What about you, Professor Malfoy? Have you ever been in love?”
Elspeth nodded thankfully while taking copious notes. Britney rolled her eyes and dragged her back to their seats.
“Where are Sirius and Remus?” Fleur asked Harry, once things had settled back down and they had curled up on the couch. Harry understood that it was all a bit much. “Are they coming later? Or tomorrow?”
Then it was mid-November and he was sliding a lemon cream biscuit onto Malfoy’s saucer at a faculty meeting.
“It’s just never been something I either felt, or was interested in. I tried sex a few times.” He shrugged. “It was fine, but it seems like something other people get more out of. People who are asexual have a wide variety of experiences, of course. Some people don’t like sex or the idea of it. Other people are more like me, where it’s kind of on par with flossing. It’s ok, but I’m not going to seek it out.”
Despite thousands of galleons of legal research, Sirius hadn’t been able to end any of the patriarchal blood supremacist nonsense that was his birthright. Or his birth millstone. Which, in Remus’ opinion, had led to Sirius embarking on a career that was a big two fingers up to the surviving members of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.
He and Draco spoke into the magical microphones at the same time. Titters broke out across the room.
Draco started when he heard his name. He tore his gaze away from Eric, their goth bartender, who had finally managed to transfigure his shoulder blades into bat wings, which was, as Val had attempted to explain, very cool magic but maybe not the most practical while at work, but, let the kids express themselves. Eric had a genius palate—and never resorted to magical shortcuts, which, Val had realized through experience, made hangovers a thousand times worse. They could afford a few shattered bottles if it kept Eric happy.
“Eh,” Harry said. “It was awkward the first few times and like, it would have been nice to have a fucking warning, Nev, but—” he sighed. “He’s actually kind of funny.”
He didn’t want to sit with that thought. And what that thought implied. And how Malfoy’s bottom lip was caught in his teeth, and the way his hair glowed in the soft purple light, and how his eyelashes were so clear and long. He was too fucking pretty, ok. It was enough to do anyone’s head in.
“Uh, not exactly,” Ron said, “There’s uh, someone who like, fixes shit. That’s all I can say. But anyway, it got stolen. Which is bad. Because it’s pretty cursed.”
Hermione shot a glance at Ron, willing him not to say anything about the whole Draco contract situation thing, because from what Sirius had said, Draco didn’t even know about it, so as she had tried to hammer into Ron’s head, this wasn’t something it was appropriate to tell Harry. Even if they told Harry almost everything.
“Oh, yeah, good, Malfoy, let’s just plan a huge event without even bringing it up at a faculty meeting. Great.”
“I worked for months to parse what ingredients, methods, and incantations in traditional love potions were coercive and which could be used or modified only to amplify feelings or emotions that already existed. Once I’d reached that stage, I added elements of veritaserum as a safeguard to ensure that only honest desire could be expressed.” The couple tried several variations, each of which had a slightly different effect. Only one, which turned the couple’s teeth, mouths, and digestive tracts purple, leading to a few days of unusually florid bowel movements, was scrapped entirely.
“This man has a gun in his drawers?” Draco said when Harry lowered the volume. “I didn’t know they called them drawers in America.”
Minerva began to laugh. Hagrid looked as though someone had stepped on his foot. Filius was nodding, moving his shoulders from side to side. Audrey swayed and clapped arrhythmically. Padma was wiping her tears with one long sleeve.
“Oh, yeah.” There wasn’t a reason to read hesitation into anything. The whole overanalyzing thing had severely backfired last time. “Guess we should take this,” she said and bent to pick up the champagne bottle.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Can’t we just send him the seeds? Do you even have the equipment to measure compressive strength?”
She touched the brim of her hat, which floated off her head. She snapped and it dropped on the nearest desk. Another wave of whispers. “No, not wingardium leviosa.
Pansy looked over at Harry and rolled her eyes. “Fine, Potter, you too. I apologize.” She turned to Draco and shrugged a little, as if to say, there, I did it.
As my client is not infertile or dead, and does not wish to die, there is little I can do for her from a strict reading of the contract itself. She desires to marry someone else in the next year.
“A lot of this stuff’s like, more recent,” Harry said, pushing the photostat of his parents’ wedding photograph towards him.
All Harry could do was nod, which Malfoy took as permission to espouse a long-winded narrative about his experiences and opinions.
Andy shrugged. “You do have to admit that it worked,” she said. “They’re probably making out in the library right now. Finally.”
“Yes,” she said, holding out one hand. “I’m a lesbian. Welcome to the Thursday Night Social Club for Currently Queer Former Hogwartians.”
Which, she thought as they fumbled for their wands, should really be one of the first spells they learned. She loved Filius, but charming a pineapple to dance? Levitating feathers? Tickling?
“Hey,” Neville said, walking around the table and dropping a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Don’t beat yourself up about it. It’s normal to be curious about, er, things we don’t know about.”
“It was going to be useful when I got out.” Draco lifted a ginger scone to his mouth, then set it back on his plate. “But it turns out things are very different.”
Astoria materialized in front of them, hovering several boxes alongside her. “Sparklers,” she said with a smile. “To light on the terrace as midnight strikes.”
He scratched his nose. “He was friends with Draco at Hogwarts, but I, uh, I haven’t mentioned that Draco’s assisting me up here because I haven’t wanted to get into the whole blood supremacy thing like, I don’t think Blaise has those views like he was talking about how he’s been really impressed with all the changes to magical society in Britain in the year he’s been back, but we’ve only spent four days together, and now it’s gotten to that point where I don’t want to fuck things up because even though it’s only four days, I really like him and I keep having these dreams—er, well. Yeah.”
“Oh, the robes aren’t gonna work?” Andromeda’s smile was too broad. Her voice was just a tad too innocent, and, of course, she’d been a Slytherin. And a Black.
Harry shook himself and went into the dining room. Andromeda had knocked out the maze of dark hallways that had dominated the Black home in Wales, and now the sitting room, complete with two-meter-tall fireplace, looked into an open-plan kitchen and dining room. She’d kept the dining table that seated fourteen (“You never know,” Andromeda had said once; Harry suspected she just liked having the space to cut fabric for her quilts) and it was set with a miniature white and gold forest, complete with miniature silver centaurs chasing nymphs through the trees, trees with sparkling gem leaves, and a miniature waterfall of Hollandaise sauce.
Draco rolled his eyes and put one arm through Harry’s. “I can’t get lost this way,” he said with a little self-satisfied smile.
Draco sighed, and said, “Yes, regarding point four in quadrant two, as Professor Potter has brought to our notice, I would like to do away with Bagshot’s archaic and mythologized text. I have instead proposed a curriculum that relies less on superstition and folklore and more on the historical interactions between the magical and muggle worlds.”
“I like the heat,” Florian said. “And I make a fuckload of money when it’s hot. So.” He shrugged and plopped down on a couch.
Draco continued slowly, “Eileen suggested that I try to be less critical. Of myself. And of others.”
According to our research, there are several possibilities to break the magical or sanguine bond, each of which requires an interaction between the two involved parties, and, unfortunately, the shedding of more blood. Each possibility is risky and not guaranteed to break the contract.
The invisibility cloak hardly fit two grown men, and Harry had to stoop over to ensure that their feet didn’t just appear where there shouldn’t be feet. It was impossible to walk in synchronization with Draco, who seemed to alternately be pushing closer to him and then trying to inch as far away from him as possible, and Harry was just about to lose his temper when they arrived at Audrey’s house.
He took an anti-nausea potion (not for emotional distress, Potter, really), and tucked himself into bed, resolutely thinking about lesson plans for next term.
She crossed her arms and squinted at him. He didn’t look ill. His hair looked atrocious, of course, and it seemed like he’d put on weight, but Lucius had become stockier in his mid-twenties so it was probably genetic.
“I used to do makeovers at school,” Andre said and chuckled. “I gave Audrey a makeover once a year, it seemed like. She was always getting into trouble and ruining something. Sweaters, shoes, hair … you know I had to make her outfit for the famous Puddifoot date?”
Dean laughed. “Oh, god, no. It wouldn’t have been the right time. I had to get my head out of my ass and notice him properly.”
Harry clutched his pumpkin juice. “But he’s married to Ben! They said they got together in London! I didn’t know they went here!”
“Alright,” Malfoy said and slung the broom over his shoulder. “See you on the pitch at six-thirty.” He was out of the room in a shot.
“Professor Malfoy—” Draco abruptly moved away, and Harry felt cold—“has proposed some changes for the History of Magic curriculum.”
“Uh,” Harry said, when Draco broke in and said, “We were making out in your closet and didn’t realize everyone had left.”
“Can you get the car seat?” He had Victoire firmly by one hand. “I think Dad might have bought a car and he’s sure to want to take the kids. Plus it’ll be a good booster seat for dinner for some people.”
The rest of him was, to put it mildly, a surprise. Draco’s hair was already receding (Blaise felt a vicious spike of elation), or maybe it was coming out in patches (and he felt guilty), and he was wearing jeans, trainers, and a t-shirt with some 5k logo.
“Worse than bubotuber pus,” Andromeda said, pouring tea into a cheerful yellow mug and passing it to him. “And they’d always sprout smack between your eyebrows.”
“May I?” Harry said and Malfoy nodded slowly. He pushed Malfoy’s hands up onto his own shoulders and grabbed what should be Malfoy’s waist (don’t think about the abs, don’t think about the abs) on both sides.
Tilting his head, Harry had the sensation that they weren’t talking about covert operations in the muggle world. But he didn’t want to press it, so he confined himself to: “Really?”
“We, are, not,” he said, poking Malfoy in the shoulder between each word, “going, on, a, sex, field-,” poke, “-trip, with, students.”
Malfoy slid the cufflink out of his left sleeve. He folded the crisp white fabric neatly and rotated his hand, laying his forearm bare. The Mark was blackish-blue.
Draco sat down at the table. This was not going according to plan. Sirius wanted to tackle Andy first. Alone.
“Don’t interrupt me, Malfoy.” Harry spat. “Just because you don’t think gay kids matter doesn’t mean that you can stop me or spread your blood purist homophobia at Hogwarts, because this is a safe place for all, and—”
He was hiding in a closet with Draco Malfoy, who was pressed against him. Harry was getting a crick in his neck, but he couldn’t tell how much time had passed in the darkness. His left leg started to prickle when Draco elbowed him again and began to ease open the closet door.
That Monday, he didn’t know what to say and avoided Malfoy’s eyes throughout each meal. Malfoy didn’t reach out. He’d would sit as far from Harry as possible at meals.
“Right, so we’ll pair off and patrol the halls—” there was a general shuffling and Harry, who had drifted away for a moment, found that he and Draco were the only ones still seated. Wait, did that mean he and Malfoy were going to be partners? He refused to meet Harry’s eyes and toyed with the handle of his coffee cup.
Harry nodded, and then realized that Malfoy couldn’t see through the door, and gulped out an affirmative noise.
Andy narrowed her eyes. “Artichokes, you pretentious asshole. But fine.” She picked up the phone, dialed from memory, then said, “Hey, Alf. Yeah, we want the usual. But then can you add a small veggie—”
He lifted his chin and looked straight at Harry. With his mouth set in a firm line and his nose upturned, Draco looked every inch the haughty Malfoy heir Harry had met in Madam Malkin’s. But he could see Draco’s glass trembling, knocking the bubbles off-kilter as they streamed upwards.
Not that she could see that right now. It was dark as fuck. Glowing orbs hovered along the drive, lighting the way towards the columned front entrance.
Audrey paused while prodding a sunflower into her messy bun with her wand and said in a dreamy voice, “Ben always had chocolate frogs, just in case we ran into a Dementor.” She shook her head (the sunflower didn’t budge) and continued, “They didn’t really find each other until after Hogwarts, but a lot of people do fall in love as teenagers. Don’t be too harsh with them tonight, Padma!”
Andre sat back down in the armchair, stared at Harry, and tilted his head to one side. He rotated one earring and said consideringly, “I think our dear Professor Malfoy will have a shock in the morning.”
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry said weakly. He’d completely spaced. He wasn’t even sure they’d learned Ebublio in school.
A tall, thin blond man appeared in the doorway. She almost wouldn’t have recognized him, but for the brief flash of judgment in his grey eyes. Pansy straightened.
“Love potions are fraught,” says Harry Potter, chairperson of Conciliato, a charity dedicated to fighting prejudice and injustice in the magical world, “Because they allow people to manipulate others. They should be treated with the same seriousness as spells of control and coercion such as Imperio.”
“Yes, thank you, Moony,” Sirius said. “When I die, you, Harry, will technically be responsible for Malfoy within the House of Black, but I don’t think that it creates some kind of familial relationship. Otherwise you’d be a god-cousin but second? A second-god cousin?”
It was the second week of December, and they were supposed to be taking names of students who wanted to stay at Hogwarts over Christmas. God knows why but Minerva had tasked the two of them to sit in the Great Hall (seniority, she would have responded) all Saturday and gather names. Harry had brought a stack of papers to mark, but Malfoy wouldn’t shut up about when the newest Tana French was going to come out.
“He’s not like thirteen anymore, so he’s probably not a git.” Fleur studied Harry’s face. “An asshole, maybe. What happened?”
Harry’s mind had gone blank again, but this time, it was from too many thoughts rushing through his head, crowding his mind with aggravated and buzzing black words in a catastrophic maelstrom.
The Heads of House—Filius, Audrey, Hagrid, and Bastian—led their first years from the Great Hall. The other students vanished in a stampede, and the teachers rose, nodding to each other as they headed to their quarters. Tired of waiting for Malfoy to finish his coffee (so he could follow him and make sure there wasn’t anything suspicious), Harry finally stood.
She had just taken another sip of the truly wretched cab when the door jingled open and in walked Neville, followed by Draco Fucking Malfoy.
“No,” Ron said, and felt something in his chest expand. “You seem like someone who can appreciate classic but complex flavor combinations. It’s not too much.”
Draco closed his eyes and said slowly, “It was all my idea. Blaise told me about the cursed necklace that went missing from your house, and because of my past, I convinced Harry that you’d use it against me, so I talked him into—”
“Oh, yes, so my older brother Jacob had disappeared before I got to Hogwarts. He’d somehow got entangled with the Cursed Vaults,” she paused, but neither Harry nor Draco gave any sign of recognition, “you know, secret chambers filled with big nasties to guard various Hogwarts treasures.” She took another look at them but nothing rang any bells.
“I, er,” he said. “Harry brought me this.” He reached inside the robe and brought out a little black square.
I apologize for the official overreaction that resulted in the removal of your library privileges after the complaint lodged by a party who shall remain nameless. This email is to notify you that all your privileges are reinstated as of this morning.
There were several loud bangs, one remarkably sharp and short incantation, and then acrid blue smoke seeped into the living room.
“It’s just not right to put children in these horrible situations!” Audrey hissed. “You two know better than anyone how awful it is to be small and to have people depending on you to do things that you shouldn’t know how to do for years, if ever at all!”
Harry laughed. “You can’t help it, can you?” He reached out and grabbed Draco’s head, ruffling his hair. Draco yelped and fought for a moment, and then submitted, drawing in a long breath. Harry felt how soft his hair was, watched the rise and fall of his chest and how his almost-clear eyelashes still made little shadows on his pale cheeks.
“And who else do we have tonight?” Val surveyed the group, recognizing almost everyone except the gorgeous young man Neville had his arm around and the—wait, was that Draco Malfoy?! Val felt a spike of ice run down their spine. They tilted their head.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Fine. But if it ends up here, you’re buying me a massive cake. German chocolate. Just so you know.”
Draco opened it, blinking slowly. He was wearing a green silk robe and his hair was sticking up on one side.
We sat down over beers and Ljutenica, an aubergine-tomato paste, spread on bread and topped with cheese, to discuss his sexuality.
And, to everyone’s surprise, Sirius’ most of all, he was a damn good one. He’d sold out the O2 last year. Remus felt a blush rise to his cheeks at that night’s memories.
Pansy broke in with a stern, “And if they tell you they’re not wearing a condom, go home. Don’t fuck them.”
As he stepped out of his clothes, laying them across his chair, Harry paused and looked out the window. Snow was falling softly across the grounds.
Vane has added other safeguards. “The very molecular structure of Curavi potions is destabilized by negative emotions, rendering their magical and chemical effects useless. These potions only work on what’s already there: emotional attunement and attachment are the necessary prerequisites to lead to any exploration of sexual desire.”
Harry groaned inwardly. He was sure that little moue was how he’d wheedled a teamful of Nimbus 2000s from his dad. It was just this side of pitiful.
“We found a suitable candidate in June, but due to his personal circumstances, he was not able to arrive until this evening with the students. The other members of the faculty and staff already know this, but I did not want to disturb you during your preparations for your first year of teaching.”
“Hm,” Harry said and tilted their head to the left. “I don’t think so, but I can look into that. New project?”
“So, er, when I was in Auckland, I was working in the Parata lab, which primarily focuses on the magical properties of the native plants of Aotearoa. And a lot of those are ferns.”
But then the rest of the group began nodding and shrugging and breaking into separate conversations, Ron leaned towards Harry and whispered, “So, are the two of you together?”
Wait, was he late? All the seats were filled. Well, except for the one between Hagrid, who had gone for some kind of serial killer clown (or perhaps just an ordinary and untidy clown, given the lipstick slash around his mouth), and Draco, who seemed to be glowing. But he couldn’t sit there. Certainly not next to a luminous Draco Malfoy. A quick glance at Minerva, whose lifelike cat nose twitched, and Mrs. Hardbroom, who giggled uncontrollably into her butterbeer, let him know that they’d all been there boozing it up for at least fifteen minutes and that this was a set-up. Hooch and Pomfrey were visiting, he noticed, dressed as bacon and an egg, which would be disgustingly adorable on anyone but two elderly women who had been secretly married for the past forty years and openly married for the past five. Good to have extra hands on deck, he thought, and bumbled his way over to the sole remaining seat.
Harry settled back into the couch, untangling their hand from Fleur’s and wrapping their arms around their knees. “He’s just out of Azkaban.”
Neville nodded. “That was actually a fascinating part, because if you ingest the leaves at certain periods in its life cycle, it can modulate your voice tone, which could have relevant properties for trans people.”
Harry had no idea how much time had passed. He was hot and his palms wouldn’t stop sweating. Wiping them once again on his faded black jeans, his fingers bumped against Malfoy’s leg. Malfoy shot up as though he’d been shocked.
“I’m the moon,” Malfoy said with a shrug. Harry blinked at the sudden burst of light. “My third-years just did the wizard Galileo and how he was sentenced to death by the Pope for his heliocentric views. So the Moon is relevant to my course.” He eyed Harry over his goblet, took a long swig, and then darted his tongue out to lick the rim.
He leaned back against one of the student desks. He didn’t seem like he was going to say anything regarding the whole Christmas Day Patronus Incident. Or really like he was going to say anything. Well, that was fine. Harry wasn’t going to bring it up then.
“I did a lot of bad things, Potter. I fucked up. I blamed him for a long time. But it was my choice. I could have chosen differently—I could have—but I wanted—"
“It’s called the Marauders’ Map,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “It’s actually quite a complicated piece of spellwork and my dad and his friends were really advanced for their age to be able to figure it out.”
He was cute like this, all rosy and contented, with Harry’s red beanie undermining the rather gothic effect of the rest of his outfit. Draco took his arm again, and Harry’s brain stopped working for a moment.
You can make an accent by holding down the “option” key (button) and the “e” at the same time, then typing the letter that you want the accent to appear over, in this case i, so it becomes í. I’ll demonstrate this in class (it’s a little complicated). Some computers have different codes or keys, so if it doesn’t work, I just probably gave you the wrong directions for the computer you’re using.
When he came to, Malfoy was kneeling next to his head, with one hand on his forehead. Harry still had the snitch in a death grip.
A tear fell down and obscured the last word. Harry watched it wrinkle the page (Hermione was definitely going to murder him) as though he were floating above his body.
The rhythm of ‘Walk It Out’ had Harry bouncing around on the side of the dancefloor. Justin exchanged a glance with Britney, and they were pulling him onto the dancefloor and cheering. Harry weakly attempted to protest.
Draco shrugged again. “Maybe a bit, but one, there’s nothing we can do, and two, I have it on good authority that it’s a …” he trailed off.
Draco piped up now and again but seemed content to let the two of them chatter away. Pomona couldn’t tell how much he understood. He’d been passable at Herbology, but it had never been his passion—smart, but hadn’t applied himself. At least not in her class.
Which of course would be exactly when the Senior Fellow in Kathartic Runes popped out of his office and raised an eyebrow at her before sweeping down the dark hallway in majestic purple robes. Another quality reminder that she wasn’t quite from this magic world, she thought and flushed in anger and irritation. Despite all the shit that they’d worked towards after the War, there was still so much superiority and snobbery and—Hermione squinted and pushed her office door open with magic, just to prove that she could while levitating her teacup.
Cho smiled at Cedric’s voice. He’d never left her, not really. He wasn’t a ghost. But at the same time, he wasn’t imaginary. He said things that would never have occurred to her, not with the way her mind worked.
Malfoy sat up straighter and stared out at the pitch. “Certainly not, Potter, which is why I cut off my editor at ten exactly. I still forget that it takes time to get places without apparition.”
Draco laughed. “Yes, if you want them to wake up immediately. It’s the magical equivalent of sending a herd of Erumpents trampling through the library. I can’t untangle these wards standing in the snow, Potter.” He sounded a bit like Hermione when she got irritated.
“I don’t know,” she said. “I think they’re a lot kinder than us. Which benefits us, as it turns out.”
At that, Malfoy burst into laughter. The high, bright peal pressed against Bastian’s charm and he shot them a dire look. Minerva shot another spell at the two of them without turning around.
Oh, that. Ginny had owled them immediately—lied that she needed some tampons and run down to the public owlery and sent them a scrawled missive and then sprinted back to the meeting—and Hermione had been waiting for Harry to bring it up.
Pansy was also efficient in her introduction, identifying as a bisexual cis woman who’d primarily dated men and who was active in the BDSM scene in London. Scrunching her nose, she said, “Yes, I’ve also done sex work. And no, I’m not going to tell you how much a blowie costs.”
Harry laughed. “You didn’t know? The whole ‘Bi-Who-Lived’ series of articles in the Prophet? I run a foundation to help orphaned LGTBQIA witches and wizards? I did a nude calendar? With pygmy puffs tastefully covering certain bits? I’m sure I have a copy of it somewhere, if you’d like …”
“Weasley delusion, hmm,” Bill half-growled, grabbing her waist. “Don’t know if I quite believe that.”
The client seemed quietly content with these plans. When asked how things were going, Draco said, “Well, it’s not what I imagined for my late twenties, but what I imagined doesn’t really appeal to me, anymore,” which I take as a positive sign of the extinguishing of blood supremacist views and a realignment of his internal worldview.
And then Elspeth opened her mouth to ask if they could maybe go on a field trip and Malfoy had freaking agreed.
Draco was finding the flagstone very intriguing suddenly. “I’m rubbish at a lot of things in the real world,” he said quietly, “but I’m quite good at research. And it’s just … anyway. Let me know if you need help with the organizer. And see you in the faculty meeting next week.”
His heart started pounding in his ears. He was going to be eternally barred from the Ottery St. Catchpole fête. Years of Weasley triumph ruined. He shouldn’t have expected anything else.
It was, of course, just a ruse. Remus attempted to concentrate on writing down some responses on the gilt-edged slips Kreacher ordered engraved with
They had no sooner ducked out from Andromeda’s mantel than they were attacked by a burst of turquoise.
“Alright, Bourne,” Malfoy said. “See you Monday for double period. Make sure you proofread your essay this time. Don’t distract from your good ideas with spelling errors.” Harry rolled his eyes but didn’t miss Bourne’s timid look of admiration.
Harry was still clutching Malfoy’s pale arm. He couldn’t breathe. This was so awful. His parents had died trying to protect him. Malfoy’s dad had tried to kill his own son, just because he liked men.
Her legs felt like they had forgotten how to make a knee work. Bending? Was that a thing? Fucking legs. Disaster knees.
Padma elbowed him. “I saw that, you prat.” She glanced around to make sure no one was paying attention to them and whispered, “You’re lucky Minnie’s too involved with her roast beef to notice.”
“Thanks for agreeing to come,” Draco said. “They wouldn’t let me go off with Blaise alone. Er, no offense, Blaise.”
It wasn’t fair that Tonks was gone. Tonks, of all people. The most stubbornly vivacious of them all. She was Fleur’s first English friend. Probably because she seemed entirely immune to any veela powers and had punched Fleur in the arm upon meeting her while submitting some treasure captured in a raid for appraisal at Gringotts. Tonks fell over her own feet, but not thanks to attraction. Merely thanks to super long shoelaces. Fleur had taught her the shoe-tying charm and they were friends, just like that.
Hermione started giggling and Ron held his fist out to Malfoy, who looked confused, until Ron coached him into a fist bump.
It turned out that Malfoy had spent five years traveling the world and spending time with wizarding enclaves, many of which were much more open to more sexualities than wizarding Britain acknowledged. The long independence of Japan from the bigotry of Christian and wizarding missionaries allowed a flourishing of same-sex relationships, while entire villages of Kenyan witches shunned men. Malfoy’s eyes shone as he explained the intricate courtship rituals of northern Europe, the yogic wizards of Mumbai, and the community of Animagi in rural Idaho who embraced wizarding children who’d been disowned for showing “abnormal” traits.
So Blaise decided to believe that and followed him to the front door. He swallowed. He balled his hands into fists in the long sleeves. He put his chin up.
“Oh, yes, of course,” she said with a shrug. “It wasn’t that hard because it’d tried to attach itself to someone who’s already got his eye on someone, and then I grabbed it before it managed to latch itself onto anything vital.”
If Death Eaters didn’t want to learn about non-magical pharmaceuticals, Florian wasn’t going to be the one to tell them.
“He’s just terrified her first word’s will be fuck which would be a a Sign that we are Bad Parents,” Ollie whispered back.
Padma shrugged and continued: “She got a job doing translations for British wizards in India. One of them took a shine to her and hired her for a translation job at the Wizengamot. I guess my dad ran up to her and grabbed her hand just as the international Portkey went off. And then he didn’t have any documents, so they got married as soon as they landed in London. Like, they were already engaged, but. You know.”
And now, armed with a fresh cup of tea, hovering just in front of her, she was about to re-enter her office and arrange her mind for the aftermath of a tutorial with a particularly trying second-year student who just didn’t seem to understand that you needed an argument in a paper, when a smudge on the brass plaque caught her eye.
“It’s just some Arithmancy,” he said. “Modified with a calculating charm and a nanoparticle cloud, based on one of Chang’s latest articles—”
“I just don’t know why they chose to do it this year,” Harry said, then swigged some eggnog. Vile stuff. Cloying.
Blaise was laconic and said only the following: “I am a polyamorous, nonbinary mage who works for the Unspeakables. You may not ask me questions about my profession.”
“Hnnrgh,” Harry said, and sped off towards the whips. Why didn’t they have a gum section or something? He was getting really hot. But he didn’t want to take his coat off, like Draco had. That would be admitting that they’d be here for a while. He closed his eyes for a moment, but the thumping bass of Eve’s ‘Let Me Blow Ya Mind’ wasn’t very calming.
It doesn’t seem like it’s going to provoke some kind of violent crisis or negative backsliding, as he seems more confused than anything else, but I would love to be able to provide Draco more resources about the topic. Or if you wanted to bring it up after class or reach out to him, but in a calm, low-key way—he’s still quite fragile in many ways. I know he didn’t get off to the greatest start in RNMWC, and I thoroughly appreciate you being willing to give him another chance.
“Potter, don’t you think you should ask them first? Before inviting—” he gestured to himself, “a former Death Eater to their home?”
Malfoy seemed to think that if he ignored the dancing and the following awkward conversation, he and Harry could settle into a friendship. And it was a friendship. For them, at least. They weren’t any less snarky, but Harry had managed to hex him only once, when Malfoy insisted that French strawberries were, always had been, and always would be superior. Malfoy looked disappointed as bogies shot out of his nose (“What are you, twelve?” he’d said after a singular
Pushing open the intricately carved wooden shutters, Fleur leaned out the window and yelled, “What?”
“You want some Goldfish?” Harry blurted, jutting his arm with the bag out towards Draco and Neville.
“I don’t think that means—” Harry broke off because he wasn’t really sure what it meant. Just better to not say anything, maybe.
His face flamed. Could have fried an egg on it, he mused, leaning against the stone wall outside Draco’s room.
A sob escaped her. “Yes, please. I tried giving Susan the ring and,” she pressed her hand against her mouth, “her eyes have gone all grey and she fell to the floor and—I don’t know what—”
“Shush, Potter, I’ll levitate you back to the tower. You’re not getting up until you’ve had tea and some toast.”
There was a bank holiday at Teddy’s Muggle elementary school, and Andromeda brought him up to Hogwarts. His hair and skin flickered between their usual curly teal locks and freckles and an approximation of Harry’s messy black hair and copper skin the entire time, and Harry could barely look at the rippling colors and textures. Malfoy, who seemed to know Teddy, had looked at him sternly while serving him a slice of quiche and told him to choose one unless he wanted the headmaster to lose her lunch. Teddy settled on miniature Potter, and Harry glowed. Teddy had screamed himself hoarse at the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff pre-season scrimmage and had to be taken to the Hospital Wing for a honey throat potion from Patrick Hardbroom, who, high off Hufflepuff’s win, ignored Harry’s dour expression and slipped Teddy a cheering potion rather than the sedating one Harry had requested in an undertone, and spent an hour teaching the young boy Hufflepuff cheers in his strong Irish accent until Patrick thought his voice was back to normal. Harry rolled his eyes and settled in for a quick kip on a bed. Teddy slipped his aspiration to be a “Puff, just like my mum” into each conversation they had the rest of the day. When Andromeda Flooed into Harry’s quarters that evening, Teddy was collapsed in Harry’s armchair, a smear of chocolate across his mouth, while Harry was snoring over a copy of Martin Miggs. She woke Harry up by kissing him on the head, and he covered the swell in his throat with a cough.
His sleeves rode up as he gestured, revealing tendrils of dark ink that blossomed across his pale wrists. A tattooed Malfoy, Harry mused. Dark Mark on the left, Harry suspected, but it had never been confirmed, and besides, what was on the right?
“Normal werewolves get heightened senses, but,” Remus said with a shrug. He just always forgot that other people liked … well, the taste of things. If it was hot, that was good enough for him.
Hermione took the proffered hand and shook it. “Your article about the inhumane working conditions of gillyweed harvesters was groundbreaking,” she said. Harry shot Draco a look. Draco caught his eye and shrugged a little.
“Oh, you all were,” Remus said. “I see.” He waved his wand and dispersed the purple smoke. “And what kind of a charm was it?”
Harry laughed, and then the two of them were laughing hysterically and wiping away tears—of joy, of sorrow, it was a bit unclear. Andre walked him to the door and batted his hands away from his hair.
So Hermione got up and, wrapping her arms around their shoulders, snuggled her head down into their neck. “You did what you could, kid.”
“Right, so I’ll just post up in this Costa and work on my grant,” Neville said, pointing to the cafe in front of them. Hot chocolate incoming. Blaise kissed him on the cheek, then dragged Draco—who still stared at their PDA—away.
Val didn’t want to be critical, but that boy had no dance moves. He was more of a flailer. But it was deeply precious that he was trying to keep up with Harry, whose sinuous grace turned heads.
Remus didn’t raise his eyes from the crossword. This was often how Harry began conversations they weren’t quite sure about and Sirius would do enough jumping in for both of them, so—
Remus kissed Sirius’ hand perfunctorily, then said, “I believe you need to dissect the child so we can indulge in a spot of light cannibalism.”
“Hector Yu,” he said. His teeth were so white. “It’s great to finally meet you, Lavender. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
“Fine,” Sirius said. Her bonds still tied, he jerked her to her feet, held out one hand to Hermione, who shrunk the blackboard and the tome and crammed them into her pockets. Narcissa felt the familiar jerk of Apparition.
Eighth year had been a dream—it was what school should have been all along. No one was trying to kill him. Only Seamus and Ron roasted him, and that was always with affection. Turns out he excelled at DADA, Muggle Studies, Charms, and Transfiguration when he wasn’t possessed. He tutored younger students and realized that this—teaching—was what he loved. Dumbledore’s Army should have been a clue, but now he knew, down in his bones, that he was an educator. But more than anything he loved waking up in his dorm and listening to his best friend snore Saturday mornings away. At least until Hermione stormed up the stairs and herded them to breakfast and the library. Harry was usually waiting for her, tucked up with some new Agatha Christie or Angela Thirkell (yeah, he had the reading taste of a grandma; it was all about comfort and coziness, deal with it), and would spring out of bed fully dressed to shake Ron awake before she barreled into the boys’ dorm.
“Following in the pointed shoes of my predecessor Albus Dumbledore, I shall save the speechmaking for after dinner. For now, enjoy.” She clapped her hands and the tables sagged with roasts, potatoes, sprouts, jugs of pumpkin juice, rolls, and a plethora of steaming dishes.
He was, in fact, sorted. Shockingly. Five days later Malfoy would find out exactly how shockingly sorted and appropriately attired Harry James Potter could be.
Malfoy shrugged and looked entirely unrepentant. “It’s so easy to wind you up. But I never really know what direction you’re going to shoot off in. Keeps me guessing.”
With gentle fingers, he prised Harry’s hand off his arm and returned it to Harry’s lap. He rolled his sleeve back down and slipped the cufflink in. He straightened in the armchair and cleared his throat.
“I wanted them to put the Slytherin crest,” Draco sad in a petulant tone. “But you can’t win them all.”
“So are we just irresponsible members of society?” She snapped her fingers to summon a bottle of Bollinger. Thank Hecate for rich friends. “Aren’t we supposed to care about retirement packages by now? Or at least think they’re interesting?”
“The Victoria sponge, by a Mr. Ronald—ah, of course, it’s a Weasley—” but Edna was grinning at that, and then in a voice he couldn’t have guessed was hiding in a four-foot eight woman, boomed, “CONGRATULATIONS RONALD!”
“I thought he’d forget,” Harry said. “I won it at the fête but somehow I took home his Smirnoff from the tombola so I emailed him about it because I didn’t want him to think I was the kind of asshole who’d like, steal someone’s more expensive prize, but he said he’d be happy with the coconut but I thought like, no, I liked that coconut and it’s not fair because vodka is way more expensive that a coconut, so it’s not really fair?”
And then it was Teddy’s birthday, and Harry walked in, saw Draco in jeans (jeans! Black jeans! Tight black jeans!), promptly blacked out, and had absolutely no memory of the party. He must have not been too odd, because he’d received a lovely thank you note from Teddy with a photograph of him and Teddy eating cake and they both looked normal enough, not as though one of them was a sex-deranged fiend lusting after a coworker. Andromeda sent him a letter than inquired when he and Draco (why? Why couldn’t she invite him separately?) would be free for dinner. He crumpled the letter and banged his head on his desk. Ulula, his owl, pecked consolingly at his hair and hooted softly.
“Azkaban is top of a rock, though, technically, as the lower cells are carved into the rock, I could claim that I have been under and inside of a rock.” The corner of his mouth twitched.
“Right, right. Yeah, Charlie’s said the two of them write a lot. About being ace, and other things. Dragons and plants, probably.”
I believe that legally, the contract could be voidable as both parties were underage (Draco Malfoy being age seven and my client age six) and therefore did not have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, but this would only account for the legal part of the contract, not the magico-physical effects and properties.
“You can be proud of your bakery. Or these scones. That’s something good. That you put into the world. Having some miniscule aberration in your cells that’s passed on because like, that’s how genes work?” Draco scoffed.
Narcisssa swallowed the urge to ask about this Susan, because, irritating though it was that Astoria had turned out to be a lesbian insofar as she couldn’t marry Draco, she was a sweet girl.
“Right,” Malfoy said finally. “If you’re sure you’re fine—” he paused, but Harry didn’t make a noise—“I do also have to use this bathroom and would like to go to bed sometime in the next twenty minutes, so …”
“Wait,” Ron said, “you think Draco Malfoy, Prince of Purebloods and High Warlock of Generally Being a Shit, is kind of funny. Explain, mate.”
Angelina and Hermione were tucked into a corner, whispering about something. Hermione seemed unusually gleeful and kept touching Angelina’s arm and looking at George. Fleur, Bill, and Victoire were off in “Antarctica, of all places! How do they have curses to break at the South Pole?” Molly cried, pausing in her quest to find another tasty nibblet for Oliver. “That poor child is probably freezing to death and Christmas without the whole family!” She continued to mutter while turning back to Ollie and Percy.
He’d had two lines of ice creams during the war. Ordinary flavors for ordinary customers. Something a little spicier, a little spikier, a little fucked up for the Death Eaters who tried to swan in and, after smacking him around, bully him into giving them free treats.
scratching the answers to the crossword in with a fountain pen—he point-blank refused to recognize a biro as a writing implement—and worrying his bottom lip with his other fingers.
“So,” Bill continued, stretched one arm around back behind Harry on the couch to touch Fleur’s hair, “Have you seen Malfoy lately?”
He was waiting to perform until she had indicated what emotion would be acceptable in this situation.
“It doesn’t make sense to use parchment!” Hermione interjected. “It’s skin! It’s really expensive! Why is it in scrolls?! The codex has been the predominant method for information storage in western Europe since like, the 1200s.”
“Uh, ok. Then there’s the glowing bog bean seeds.” Neville paused. “So Hendercronck’s working on the compressive strength of native seeds and wanted to know if we’d be able to provide some numbers on the seeds we have.”
She moved behind him. He didn’t want to breathe. He could smell the sweet waft of her perfume and a woody, spicy smell, and then she was ripping his shirt up and putting one hand down the back of his pants and—
“I’m ready whenever you are,” Harry said. He’d already changed out of his academic robes and was just in a peacoat, boots, jeans, and a hoodie. It was fucking freezing in Scotland in March. The beanie was necessary for keeping his eyebrow piercing warm against the cutting wind.
He couldn’t attend Nick’s party, as he told the ghost, because the professors paired up and had to patrol the halls. He didn’t mention in front of the pre-adolescents that this was to prevent any Hogwarts babies or too much exhibitionism—he didn’t want to inspire the twelve-year-olds to attempt some largely premature experimentation.
Suddenly, Harry realized that he stank, like, well and truly reeked. God, he should have taken a bath earlier. Malfoy was sure to turn his nose up at any Potter-related stench. He could try the new cologne Cho had sent him last Christmas. Come to think of it, he rather suspected that it was a re-gift from Theodore’s unwanted Christmas presents. He always sent them a nice box of Honeydukes. But the heavy cut glass chamber contained something that seemed to change scents every time he opened it. Hopefully it wouldn’t be too bad this time.
He didn’t invite Malfoy to the WAWFAN meetings. Malfoy would have to talk to him first. He’d have to show he’d changed. Harry couldn’t reach out. Malfoy had to be the one to cave.
“Wait, babe, it’s your birthday?” Val tapped the button. It had once said BIRTHDAY BOY. The boy was scratched out with a sharpie and there was a series of question marks and then the word FUCK.
or something hARDER and then get him addicted so fast that hes in a mom drugs anonymous meeting 4 months later like ???!!?
“Your glasses are on the bedside table,” Malfoy said before Harry could even open his mouth. “Which is where they should always be, if they’re not on your face.” He didn’t look up from his book but pursed his lips. “No wonder they’re always a bit crooked, since you thrash about in bed with them on.”
Harry stared at the juice and blinked. “I think we know who we want to be with at fourteen, but it’s usually not the same person you want to be with when you’re nineteen. Or twenty-six.”
His fifth-year Ravenclaws and Gryffindors kept pestering him as to why he hadn’t marked their papers, and he finally cracked and lost his temper and shouted a bit at Elspeth, who burst into tears. Britney took her hand and glared furiously at Harry.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I talked him down to just the sex ed panel. But now I’ve got to come up with two people for it.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Wish some people would stop asking,” she said under her breath. Ron mouthed “mum” and refilled her glass.

They rubbed one eye. “Astoria used to say some stuff and the rest of us were like, you’ve got to be joking, but Draco has like, backed her up on some weird shit.”
And then before he knew what he was saying, he was offering, “You could come to Andromeda and Teddy’s with me on Christmas morning? We’d come back here for dinner, but you’re related to them, and I’m sure Andromeda wouldn’t mind another mouth to feed.”
The other three underwent a rigorous process of testing and trials and eventually developed into Curavi. The name comes Latin word for “desire,” not as in the wanton lust of “libido,” but as a desire stemming from a sense of love and respect.
“Yeah, the icy silence and all the drinking isn’t because of Malfoy. Not at all. Completely unrelated.” She waved her wand emphatically. “You’re completely fine at faculty meetings, entirely chummy, work together on related curriculum, all that shit. You’re absolute mates.”
“Unconvincing, given the introduction to his book.” Talbott flicked his wand, and then Draco had shot out a jet of light, and Audrey was firing back, and all Harry could think to do was to shout “Expelliarmus!”
“Makes you easy to feed, love,” Sirius said with a lascivious wink. “Now that I’m a kept man and you lock me in the kitchen all day.”
Vane agrees. “Traditional ‘love’ potions are extremely dangerous because they remove the necessary element of consent from romantic and sexual relationships. Just as someone who is drunk cannot consent, someone under the effect of a love potion is equally—if not more—incapacitated.”
“Potter, don’t be ridiculous. It’s half-ten. I’m not going to run about like I’m a student wrapped up in your silly little invisibility cloak with you peering in Audrey’s windows.”
He pulled the shrunken presents out and told Teddy, “I’ll unshrink them once you’ve unwrapped them, otherwise you’ll know what they are immediately.”
“Harry, that’s so sweet of you,” Astoria said, since Draco was sitting there like a lump. “Why don’t you show Draco how it works?”
Jason nodded fervently, then dropped his glance to his plate, then back up at Ron. He suddenly seemed shy. “It’s not too, er, much?”
He straightened his neckwear, smoothed his hair back, and slid into the seat next to Harry. “Hello, Potter.” It was the only seat left, Harry reminded himself. Though the stand did seem a bit smaller than it had been before.
And then they were at Harry’s door. Which meant that Draco had missed his door. And then Harry had a moment of clarity and he’d reached out and grabbed Draco’s arm. His bicep was firm and warm in his hand, beneath Draco’s woolen robes.
According to Merriam-Webster, asexuality, as it relates to humans, is “not having sexual feelings toward others: not experiencing sexual desire or attraction.” Weasley says this captures his experiences.
would deter the more … frenzied students. If there are no further objections, I would support Professor Potter’s motion to have a wizarding dee-jay. All opposed?”
“Wait, what?” Harry whispered. He didn’t want to be rude, but this just didn’t make any sense. “Your entire family are …” he trailed off.
“Right, so, you can’t run Conciliato when you’re on empty. I’m ordering you to take a bubble bath. Today.”
Harry laughed, and shoved him a little bit. “You complete git! You think my curricular reform plan is good!”
It was the Oliver-Winger’s fault, Harry thought, that’s why he was so filled with these moist thoughts. Entirely their fault. Probably some residual enchantment from that Priapus necklace. Nothing to do with the blonde head bobbing at his side and needling him about his terrible puns and lies.
Val raised their eyebrow and waited. It was best to let Harry ramble into the realization that they’d wanted the coconut back as an excuse to see Draco again. That was pretty clear. But Harry never really bothered listening. That was a bit harsh. If they had an idea, it was difficult for others to dislodge it.
“Potter, if that’s like a waltz, I am a drunk Erumpent.” But this lacked the crisp retort of a Malfoy insult, and he seemed a bit dreamy as he let go of Harry’s shoulders.
Harry felt a bit like a broken record, but he was just really confused. He knew his dad’s family was rich, but like, they were also immigrants, and desi, and wizarding high class was like, posh white people who would have gone to Eton if they’d been Muggle.
“Yeah, and that one, which is totally stupid; they’re such idiots. Just like, ask her if she has some magical drug or something before you stab yourself, Romeo. Or just give it like five. Jesus.” Britney rolled her eyes and tapped her ballpoint on her desk.
“I know you’re a big girl, Vic,” Bill said, lifting her up and setting her on his hip. “But grandma thinks you’re little still, so sometimes we have to pretend you’re little to make Grandma Molly happy. Can you keep the secret with me?”
He fell silent as he watched Filius try to break it down to ‘Pon de Replay.’ Audrey was bouncing along and clapping, her bottle green hat askew. His eyes flicked to a nearby table, where Claude Oliver-Winger was banging his head directly onto the wood. Wait, Claude? He wasn’t a fourth-year. Whatever, his mum could deal with that.
“Not in the spirit of the request,” Remus said. Andromeda raised her eyebrows at it and it disintegrated into ash.
Malfoy didn’t appear on the walk to the grounds. He still wasn’t there when the captains shook hands or when Andre blew the first whistle.
Malfoy leaned back from Harry’s chest, one hand on his cheek, “What the fuck are you wearing, Potter, armor?!”
It was strange, he thought. Four months knowing this new Draco Malfoy. He’d been snarky, sure, cocksure, prickly, and defensive, but he was also good with kids, firm but encouraging, put thought into his Christmas presents, had written Harry a fucking novel and brought him information about his family he’d never known—
That seemed like the conclusion to a lot of their meetings lately—Draco gone, Harry sweating and confused and a bit disoriented.
Remus says I should write, “I had hoped to hear from you by now.” I’m giving you three more days before I use the Summoning.
“Giving up already, how tedious,” Malfoy said in a drawl. “Oh, how one’s ickle altruism can go awry, that even the bravest Gryffindor—”
The snow-capped peaks of the Peeshti Skali Dragon Sanctuary in Bulgaria tower over us, but they fade into mere hills when seen from the back of a dragon. Charlie Weasley, head of the British scientists stationed at the international research center, insists that it’s the only way to see the region—or to understand how dragons understand the world.
“You keep looking at that empty chair, which is clearly the one he’s going to sit in, since it’s not the Headmaster’s chair, so,” she shrugged and adjusted her pointed black hat. “Why aren’t you wearing a hat? Didn’t they tell you we’re supposed to wear hats on the first evening? Look all witchy and intimidating to the ickle firsties.” Harry snorted. For all of Padma’s guff, she seemed to be wildly popular among the students. Lots of them had waved to her.
Was he trolling him? Was he being serious? Harry made a little tetchy noise in his throat. “I can get more the next time I pop down to Edinburgh.”
Ron didn’t have time for this kind of defeatism. It was the morning of the fête. The morning of the fête.
encouragement, which was the closest thing to electricity he’d come up with—Harry finished drawing a diagram of a computer on the blackboard for his afternoon class and pulled down a map of Britain just seconds before a giggling mob of fifteen-year-olds streamed into his classroom.
Malfoy didn’t move, but said airily, “I’m sure you can demonstrate adequately on your own, Potter. I wouldn’t want to overshadow you.”
Neville saw his eyes get shinier, and he didn’t know what to do because the idea that he would cheat on someone—even the thought brought bile to his mouth—and the idea that Blaise might think that he’d do that. It was. It was a really shitty feeling.
Ron was the only one who was interested, properly interested, in food. Everyone else liked eating. But he and Ron could sit around for hours, pouring over magazines and cookbooks and dreaming up new wild things to purée, sauté, and flambé.
“Besides, Potter,” he said with a smug little smile, “I did get into Jean-Antoine’s pants, so cultural exchange works.”
“I assume so,” Narcissa said, running her finger over the alchemical runes. “Well, not entirely. I think it’s an elongated, inverted version of the original contract ceremony. They didn’t want to make it easy to break.”
“You know, you’re always welcome at WAWFAN meetings, if you want to talk about it with someone your own age. There’s no need to decide on a label immediately, or ever—it’s ok to not be sure. It’s also ok to change labels. It’s all ok, Perry.”
“Cho,” Marcus said in a gentle voice clearly reserved for idiots. “You can’t give babies forks. They’re pointy. She could stab herself in the eye. Or stab me in the eye.”
Perry almost jumped out of his seat. He pulled on one of his blonde curls and stuttered, “Uh, he, we, Shakespeare?”
The front had Draco’s monogram and the back had the Black family crest. It looked like there had been another coat of arms, Malfoy, Harry assumed, to balance out the design, but it had been effaced.
“A heart is the size of a fist, so it has to be bigger than a fist.” Susan wrinkled her forehead in concentration. “Maybe it was a dad phrase.”
Luckily, Luna came through the floo and it took all of Harry’s attention to attempt to untangle the strands of vaginal amulets from her hair. He was trying to politely explain to her that maybe it was best to just give the teenagers the highlights of tantric sex communication and maybe not to wear the aforementioned amulets when Hermione burst through in an explosion of papers.
“But it turns out a lot of the magical ferns don’t necessarily follow the sporophyte/gametophyte cycle,” Neville said. “Parata’s 2004 paper demonstrated that several species of these ferns seem to have multiple genders beyond what we term male/female and also have, er, strategies of reproduction beyond what one could, in human terms, call heterosexual.”
“Which is why you’re having Christmas morning with him. And why he’s sleeping over at our house. And why he’s been the subject of most of your recent letters.”
After a vigorous class, since Britney insisted that they all get up and act it out “properly, because Shakespeare is so physical” that included Justin refusing to sing Ophelia’s song and attempting to beat box it instead, a startlingly charged scene between Claudius and Gertrude, and actual wailing over Yorick’s skull, Harry collapsed into his desk chair.
A person wearing a pink t-shirt emblazoned with the same lipstick print appeared from the back of the shop and glided towards them. A big pin proclaimed “they/them,” and their name tag read “Starr.”
The days of Christmas shenanigans at the Burrow were enough to drive anyone mad. At least Molly didn’t hate her anymore, but there were just too many Weasleys for there to be even a moment of peace and quiet.
Rubbing his forehead, Harry groaned. “Why does anyone bother with Amortentia anyway? It’s Halloween, it’s not Valentine’s Day.”
“He has such a good parent voice already,” Hermione agreed. “I’m hoping mine will like, come with the pregnancy. Or the birth. As long as I get one eventually.”
“Sure, Malfoy, sure.” Harry balled his hands into fists and released his fingers in an effort to not smack the small smile off Malfoy’s face.
In the moment of silence between songs, Elspeth wriggled a bit and said, “Britney, what’s he bringing out? I don’t understand—”
Harry felt the silence stretch out between them. He didn’t quite feel up to bringing up Sirius’s cigarette case; it was a bit too fresh to speak about without his eyes burning. He’d sent Draco an effusive thank you note. That was enough for now.
Harry considered her bowed head. “You don’t know until you try it. I mean, I don’t know your parents, other than that they’re madly protective, but they probably just want what’s best for you two. They let you both come back for the battle.”
Harry suddenly felt they were intruding and got to his feet, apologizing and bidding Talbott a good night and thanking him for not just hexing them immediately, when he felt Draco’s hand on the small of his back, pushing him into the dark night.
“Well,” he said after an agonizing minute of silence, “I did not know that being not-heterosexual was an option until a few months ago.”
“Well, excuse me, Miss Politeness Patil.” He stabbed a chunk of potato. She rolled her eyes and turned to talk to Hagrid about harvesting Flobberworm slime.
Hermione sighed and twisted her wedding band. “One day, Ronald. When…” she trailed off and Harry raised his eyebrows.
She really was pleased. Neville knew he was hot. But inside he was still a bit shy. A bit bruised. But he was so careful and to hear that he’d been able to open up to someone and experience a sexual event and explore his sexuality and it sounded like a good time. She grinned.
Hermione hmphed. She didn’t know if being likened to Malfoy was flattering. But then again, if he was still a dick, she could always punch him in the face again. The warm glow of that memory spread through her.
“Sit, sit,” Andre herded him towards a stool, and then ran his fingers through Harry’s hair diagnostically. “Hm, yeah, I’ll just even it out a bit.”
“It’s an expression,” Harry said sharply. “I taught it to my sixth-years last week. Important Muggle slang.”
She got up, grabbed Harry’s elbow, and steered them out of the kitchen, babbling about how lovely the sun was in the morning and wasn’t it rare to have a sunny morning and so lucky on the day of the fête, too.
Harry looked, really looked, at him in the clear sunlight. Malfoy squinted up into the sky, wrinkling the skin around his eyes and across his forehead as he followed the match. The wind ruffled his white-blonde hair, and he pushed it back behind one ear without taking his eyes off the field. He reached into his robes, withdrew a glasses case, and put on a pair of black Ray Bans.
“It is indeed not,” Sirius said with a sigh. He let the front two legs of his chair thud to the earth, then rose and leaned on the counter next to Andy. “Draco is in a fucking mess.”
Hermione’s introduction was exactly five minutes long; she’d timed it on her wand and had just finished her final sentence about being happily married to a cis man when the jangly alarm went off.
There was a silence. Harry fought the urge to laugh again and leaned against his desk, wiping his hands on his pants. Malfoy didn’t know. What a self-involved ass, honestly. As if they didn’t have wizarding papers in—wherever he had been.
Narcissa pressed her nails into her palm. Her mother had said it wasn’t worth the struggle—the memories of Nils would fade—better to avoid subjecting the family to the humiliation of a counter ritual she would surely fail, anyway. She stared at the grass. Her toes were numb. Hermione noticed her glance and summoned her shoes. Narcissa slipped them back on, heedless of the dirt and grass.
Kreacher glared at Remus from over Sirius’ shoulder. “You should respect the paterfamilias. He knows what is best for the House.”
Jesus, Andre had made him hot. He’d shortened the hair on the sides of his head and cleaned up the top bit, so it looked slightly damp but in a cool and carefree way. Fuck, he wasn’t half-bad looking.
“I’d agree,” Harry heard a smooth voice say, and he realized that Draco had come up with a glassful of champagne.
Since Muggle Studies was now a required course from first year to fifth and an elective for the sixth and seventh years, Harry had his hands full. His summer had been devoted to developing seven years of curriculum for both Muggle-born and wizard-born students. Where Charity Burbage had favored bone-dry essay prompts (“Why do Muggles need electricity?”), Harry chose to introduce his kids to Velcro and ballpoint pens, assign debates on the flat earth theory (How did some wizards still believe this? If the earth wasn’t a globe, how would Astronomy even work?), and introduce the fifth-years and above to the wonders of rap, R&B, and indie music. Irritated that he still hadn’t figured out a way to make computers work at Hogwarts—the CD player he picked up in Edinburgh only worked when thumped three times and given a little
Malfoy shot Harry a confused look and Harry shrugged. He didn’t really know what they were on about, but if they wanted to do that weird couple speak, he wasn’t going to interfere. They’d tell him when—
Which, of course, Potter immediately objected to. With an irritated tear of the delicious French bread, Potter corrected me—magical world, readers! To keep smashing that patriarchy, check out the sidebar feature!—about the future of Conciliatio, the charity they established to break down prejudices: “We’ve been working largely with students at Hogwarts and with young people across the magical world from a variety of transitory locations, so our next step isn’t exactly a paradigm shift, it’s more of a, uh,” and here, dear readers, Potter blushed and held out their hands in a gesture of adorably flustered confusion, “Uh, anyway, we’re getting a building in Diagon Alley.”
“Of course not! I just fail to see why a local robbery means that you’ve assumed it’s going to end up at Hogwarts. They’ve probably already taken it down to Borgin and Burke’s or it’s on its way to Shanghai or Moscow.” Draco shrugged. “I don’t see why it’s our problem.”
Hermione spilled out of the car shouting Harry’s name. Malfoy gathered the bags and hung back, letting them hug each other. She studied Malfoy for a moment, then pulled him in for an embrace; he wasn’t expecting it and stood stock still, clutching their packages.
He’d been working on not doing that. Or at least on hiding it better. And now Neville might know or guess or intuit that he wasn’t all quite there or quite alright. All right in the head. And it was fucked once again.
“And what’s worse,” he continued, “is that sometimes you really like someone, and you don’t even know if you’d have the wrong bits that they wouldn’t like or something, because like people don’t go around wearing labels and some people are really only into one kind of bits and it’s stupid!”
He fiddled with the collar of his sherwani—it was a bit crooked somehow, maybe he’d wrinkled it—and rolled his eyes at the reflection in his bathroom mirror.
“Oh, yeah,” Andre said. “I forgot you knew him. Ollie’s cleaned him up a bit. But he keeps Ollie organized and like, doing something other than Quidditch, so they’re good together.”
“You’ve got to keep them in there,” Owain said plaintively. “They’re havoc on the cabbages.” Padma smothered a giggle by biting into a biscuit.
“My aunt also does not subscribe to any of the magical papers or periodicals, so I have no idea what the state of current affairs are beyond those I learn about in class or via friends.”
“There’s only a few olds left,” she continued. “Hagrid’s head of Gryffindor; they’ll probably be grooming you for that, but he’s got a few years left in him. Minnie retired last year but she keeps popping back in to pick up a book. Pomfrey and Pince moved to Brighton in 2000. Trelawney’s down in Wales somewhere. Filius keeps saying he’ll retire, but, you know. Men. Tricking themselves that they’re irreplaceable.”
Andre looked down at his half-full mug. “Percy’s not sure how his parents would react to him and Ollie.”
Harry poked through the blue tin. “I heard that Malfoy’s out today,” they blurted, then shoved the entire biscuit into their mouth.
Draco shut his eyes and exhaled through his nostrils. “Do you know how hard it is to not say something filled with innuendo right now,” he said flatly. “You’re inviting me to your room after dinner to talk.”
He didn’t speak as they made their way to the staff room. Malfoy threw a handful of Floo powder into the fireplace and held out his hand.
“Right,” Neville said and flipped his lab notebook open. “First, we could continue titrating the flebotomos lousewort.”
“You’re not, though,” Sirius said, holding up a finger to Kreacher, “I specifically freed you and gave you a very good pension because you’re not beholden to me at all, but you were the one who wanted to live at the bottom of the garden—”
Neville was kissing his neck. He was going to melt and keel over on this stupid formica table. “I’d much rather stay here. With you.”
As the opening beat of Akon’s ‘Smack That’ began to thrum through the air, he smiled down at Malfoy’s platinum blond head.
He was having a heart attack. Like, actively dying. And his fiancée was bouncing on her toes and his mother was patting his arm. Couldn’t they tell he was seconds from seeing the Grim?
“I know you’re still here, Potter,” Hermione said some thirty seconds later. She’d never reveal it, but she could tell when Harry was around. The air changed. Like all the magical particles just tilted slightly. Ron could feel it too, and Luna had agreed, but most people didn’t seem to be that attuned to the low-level magical particulates thrumming through the atmosphere, and Herminone had never wanted to make Harry feel weird by mentioning it (because, God, what if it was a long term Horcrux effect?). Plus it felt kind of cool to be able to mystify Harry, who held the invisibility cloak in the highest esteem, and yes, it was a highly magical and rare item, but Hermione was quite sure that there was more than a little sublimation of the respect and adoration and love Harry hadn’t gotten from his parents into and towards a garment that his father had worn regularly.
At least they’d been able to skip the eve of Christmas Eve this year, since, as Fleur had pointed out to her husband—she loved saying that, thinking it, running her hand across Bill’s arm at a restaurant or as an introduction, thinking that he was hers, all hers, the father of her children, the sudden sunlight dream explosion of a million romantic thoughts she’d always denied or subsumed into charmwork because falling in love was stupid and then, there he was, and now he was her husband—no one else even thought that was a holiday.
According to our firm’s research into sanguine marriage contracts and the wording of this specific contract, the lives of both of the parties will be threatened if one of them enters into a marriage with another. My client desires to marry another party.
“My father is a terrible person,” Draco agreed. “I don’t know if your parents are as much to blame as they were victims of You-Know-Who and my father, the supreme asshole.”
The following weeks compressed into a repetitive pattern: wake up, eat, teach, spar with Draco at lunch, teach, WAWFAN  meetings where he and Draco would argue more, maybe a nightcap with Draco (he needed to buy more scotch), bathe, sleep, repeat.
Lavender leaned forwards to crash her glass into their champagne flutes, just to stop thinking and overanalyzing everything, all the time, shut the fuck up, because it’s all sparkling and it’s all dust.
The librarian might be able to help you with their particular machines. I’m glad to hear you’re spending time in a non-magical space. Maybe we can discuss your experiences during our next class?
“No one’s gotten into the Amortentia yet.” Padma grinned. “Probably because I labeled it ‘Bubotuber Pus Poison.’”
“Potter,” Draco said in a reverent tone. “I hardly think the students will be put at ease by a footlong dildo.”
He was starting to understand how love could be a dangerous thing, untrammeled, unchecked—so he’d started doing some meditation and yoga and was working on his breathing and going to therapy, but then he’d catch sight of Draco and have to count to seven and grit his jaw.
“I, er, don’t really have the energy for charades,” Harry rambled, “I think the smoke went to my brain, maybe I’ll just go sit in the library for a minute.” Draco nodded several times, and then Harry dragged him down the hallway.
Draco’s eyes widened and he stood up so fast his chair fell over. “I, er, emails,” he blurted and fled.
Malfoy swung one leg over the broom and turned around to brush snow from the bristles. He bent over the broom and his ass—
Blaise pocketed his wand and held out his hand for Draco, who shuffled across the front step. The minute he touched Blaise’s arm, Neville apparated them to the back parking lot of the shopping center. There were dumpsters.
“Right, fuck you, Malfoy, I have marking to do,” Harry said, flushed and irritated, standing and grabbing another half-sandwich for the road.
The thoughts were wriggling in his stomach. The Malfoy-related thoughts. Though there were no such thoughts. Those thoughts were completely out-of-bounds and therefore needed to be locked firmly away. In a box. Throw the key out the bloody window. Think about Hippogriffs. Or killing doxies.
She paused here and steepled her fingers together. Harry busied himself with pouring some more tea. She declined with a gentle shake of the head. He dropped a sugar cube in and reached for the creamer.
It had been lovely listening to his grandfather’s wild tales of the wizarding past—magical past, he reminded himself, while handing Harry a raspberry ripple caramel cone—but as the years went by and he got closer and closer to eleven without having so much as a blip of magic, things became less sunny.
“So, who is it?” She turned her attention back towards the banana chips. Best to not act too interested. That piqued him a little, and he leaned forward.
Harry stepped forwards and touched Draco’s cheek. Draco turned and rested his head in Harry’s palm, his face finally peaceful.
“Potter, don’t be absurd. Cufflinks should be heirloom.” The cold tone was back. Dammit, not how the plan was supposed to be working. He put his glasses back on to see Malfoy’s face—which was absolutely expressionless.
“You—what—nude—” Malfoy was sputtering now. His pale skin was flushed from his cheeks all the way down to the tight black collar encircling his neck.
“Oh,” Andromeda said, shooting for warm and encouraging. “That means everything’s going along as it was planned. That’s good. How are you feeling about getting your wand back?”
Harry nodded. But that didn’t mean that Draco had to like, request that file. Or make copies. Or save those copies. “Why?”
“Well, no,” Andromeda said with her mouth full of toast. “But if Neville wants it, it probably does something.”
“Darling, firstly, Pride was last month, and secondly, you should use a clarifying shampoo. At least occasionally. Oh, thanks, love,” she said and blew Ron a kiss as he handed her a cup of tea.
“Commandeered by the grandmama,” Fleur said. “She gathers all the babies to her like an extremely powerful magnet.”
“He was planning to kill Dumbledore! I was watching him! For evil behavior! He was a wizard fascist!”
“Good morning,” she said and strode to the end of the classroom, where Filius used to stand on his pile of books. She looked at them, then turned to face her students. “As many of you know, Professor Flitwick had a heart attack after last night’s welcome feast.” There were hushed murmurs. They already knew this, but fourth years
Harry’s stomach flipped. Disgusting, that someone could be wrapped around one of Malfoy’s fingers. That was the only way he got that book deal probably. Sheer lust-induced nepotism or something. Who would want to kiss his pointy, beardy face? Or mess up his stupidly blond hair? Malfoy probably whined about wrinkling his clothes when someone was taking them off and bossed his partners around in that haughty accent—Harry felt a bit lightheaded.
Harry shoved his chair away from the table and stood. “He tried to kill Dumbledore! He took the Mark! He hasn’t changed, and he’s probably still a snarky little arse who can’t wait to—” he was spluttering and his vision swam as he smacked a hand on the table—“inculcate the youth with his racist, sexist, homophobic, blood purist ideas, and I can’t believe—”
Astoria pressed her lips together so hard and held her breath otherwise she was definitely going to burst out in hysterics. Lavender had let her face drop into her hands and her shoulders were heaving. She sat back up, blinked and shook her head until the smirk dropped off her face.
The evening of the Winter Ball was crisp and clear. A soft white snow covered the Hogwarts grounds. The students had been given Friday off after lunch, and the hallways were oddly silent in the hours leading up to the Ball. Harry’d done a bit of grading and then realized it was almost half-seven and sprinted to his room to get dressed.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t watch him. That’s bonkers.” Padma snorted. “Ok, no, you know what, fine, I watch everyone. It’s not just him. My past fuels paranoia. C’mon, Padma.”
Draco picked up the pestle and returned to his work. Neville was about to give up on the conversation when he said slowly, “I thought it was only a non-magical thing, from class. But then you kissed Blaise in front of me, and Sirius married Remus Lupin, who, my father said, had attacked and forcibly bonded to Sirius, which I now see is a horrible, prejudiced way of distorting what seems to be a partnership of equals. So it’s clearly a human, or, as you attempted to begin this discussion with, a plant, thing.”
Their lesson plans didn’t overlap anymore. Britney and Elspeth reported to Harry that Professor Malfoy had apologized to the fifth-years for causing them to repeat material in Professor Potter’s class (git, he stole it!) and vowed to include less culture in his upcoming lectures. Elspeth rolled her eyes, but all Britney said was, “I don’t see why you two won’t just coordinate the cultural stuff,” to which Harry grunted.
No syllabus was worth denying the truth, Harry reminded himself, digging his nails into his palms. The flirting plan was definitely off the table now. If Malfoy couldn’t even come to terms with his own blood purist, terrorist past, he didn’t deserve a place around kids. Especially not kids who needed support and love. And role models.
“There is blood, of course, but it was a pinprick,” Narcissa said. “Just enough to dampen the salt. That’s why there’s a two—blood
“You know what I was reading,” Luna said dreamily, “couches used to be a place of female sexuality, deviant, of course, but there was this theory that women who had male visitors would entertain them on the couch in more than one way, which of course led to the development of this trope of women masturbating on couches—”
“Ah, Harry,” Minerva McGonagall smiled up at him and gestured to an empty seat on her left. As he sat, Prof—no, Filius—poured him a cup of tea and passed him the sugar bowl and creamer.
“Hands in the air!” Britney shrieked suddenly, throwing her arms up. Elspeth followed a beat behind, looking supremely unsure about the entire thing.
Harry knew a dismissal when he heard it. Something had gone wrong and he wasn’t really sure how or what or why.
Just like him, honestly, to make Harry’s family revelations all about him, such a fucking white man move—
Why had Draco completely lied about everything? But he’d called him Harry. He’d said Harry. Not Potter. Harry.
Neville and Draco appeared to reach some kind of conclusion, or at least Neville did, because he put one hand on Draco’s arm and propelled him further into the room.
“He’s got you there, ‘Arry, he knows his stuff.” Hagrid passed a plate of Cornish pasties to Harry and nodded with a grin. Harry poked the pasty on his plate and discovered that it seemed to be steak … and pumpkin? How thematic.
“The Ministry of Magic said they were more worried about someone killing him than him, uh, perpetrating more crimes,” Sirius said. “I mean, he still sounds like a shit, but—”
Wiping the tears from her eyes, she pinched his cheek. “So lucky to have you,” she said, then blinked away more tears. “Well, I should go make sure your father hasn’t scared off the coconut shy man.”
Harry wanted the floor to swallow him up. This was completely out of hand and now he was flashing his bare arse at a colleague and he still didn’t have one more iota of information regarding Malfoy’s syllabus, so this was really all quite a waste. This was not according to the Plan. As he bent down to the towel, he realized it was already wrapping itself back around his waist.
A jet of blue light shot out of Addie’s wand, lassoed the papery canaries, and flattened them into a stack of reddish paper.
Padma rolled her eyes at him. “That’s literally exactly what I was saying. The person you’re into at fourteen isn’t destined to be your soulmate.”
“Yeah,” she said. “He does the pasties and sandwiches. And the wedding cakes. My hands aren’t quite that steady.”
“We can pick up a few things when we’re in Edinburgh next,” Malfoy said, completely ignoring Harry, throwing his legs up over the chair’s arm. “When we go for the stickies. And my books.”
“I used to struggle with a lot of anger,” Potter reveals, “Especially when I realized I had to kill Voldemort and when I found out I was a Horcrux. But I’ve been in therapy for years. Which kinda helps. But I think getting older helped a lot, too. And being able to change the shitty parts of the world—or to try, anyway—definitely also helps.”
The silence was deafening. Harry pulled a bit too hard on the bottom drawer and it crashed onto his foot.
“He’ll be helping me set up the greenhouses before term, but then he’s going to start a potions internship.”
And if that wasn’t just fucking poetic, Florian thought, and rolled off the couch onto the floor. “Gotta head back to the shop.”
Remus Lupin glanced at his husband. “Ah, the perils of age,” he said with mild amusement and turned back to the crossword.
“Unlike you, it doesn’t take me ages to mark things.” Malfoy shrugged. “Natural intelligence, I suppose.”
Ridiculous Black theatricality, Andromeda thought, while considering throwing the entire box of chocolates right back into the fireplace to incinerate them. She wasn’t exempt.
Malfoy looked as though he’d forgotten he had a sandwich. He picked it up, then put it down again. “When you say cupboard, you mean a small room, right?”
The tension ebbed out of the room. Sirius poured more coffee, and despite his best efforts and a serious amount of effort, Remus couldn’t taste the difference.
Ron laughed. “If it’s Malfoy, he’ll want to outdo you in the coolness factor, so he’ll bring, let me see … Blaise and … what’s the girl? Parkinson?”
Hermione scrutinized Harry’s face. They were looking … not quite happier, really, but more at ease and less frazzled than they had in some time. Even with glitter dandruff.
“It’s true, not all of us are blessed with your lanky physique. Some of us have lifted weights occasionally in the past eight years.”
Harry turned to Ron. “Oh, low-level shit, huh? That’s why they’ve called out the Deputy Head Auror and the Unspeakables’ evil jewelry expert? For a routine B&E?”
“See you tomorrow morning, Harry,” Andromeda whispered, levitating her somnolent grandson towards the Floo. “It’s lovely that you’ve asked Draco, too.”
Sirius scratched his head. “Well, Malfoy is my maternal first cousin once removed or my paternal third cousin once removed. You’re my heir, so if I died—”
Harry flapped one hand at her, then gathered the invisibility cloak around themselves, stood, and disappeared.
Ron swallowed. They’d talked about this, the possibility of introducing someone else and this sounded like maybe it was an overture. He blinked away a vision of being sandwiched between them on a couch, in their bed, two sets of hands holding him and two mouths kissing him.
to call her Artie. August also brought the Quidditch World Cup, where Oliver kept a clean sheet for Scotland, who still went out in the semifinals. Even Artie couldn’t cheer up Uncle Ollie.
“So I wanted to discuss a few of the projects I’d like to complete before then, and see if there was a particular one you were interested in.”
“I was an idiot. Nothing was ever enough. Nothing would ever be enough to erase who I was—who I am.” Malfoy cleared his throat.
“The papacy is an outdated institution and has been since the seventh century.” Malfoy calmly broke a piece of bread and buttered half before popping it into his mouth.
Harry’s throat felt a bit tight. “Yep, that’s how it works. I’ve got green eyes like my mum, but I’ve my dad’s hair.”
After the Hat declared Zinnias, Zebbediah to be a Slytherin, the Great Hall resounded with applause. Minerva took her place in front of the high table. Malfoy slipped into the empty seat at the far end. Harry still couldn’t really see him clearly, but his black robes dragged across the floor. This was a school, not a fashion show. His white-blond hair was no longer slicked back but cropped closely and marginally less shellacked than his teen years, and the shadowy glow of a beard softened his pointed chin.
“Babe, can you just transfigure it?” Neville asked. He had samples to classify. This fashion trip wasn’t his idea of a fun Saturday morning, but the aurors weren’t expanding the list of people who could apparate Draco. Which was fucking dumb, because it was almost nine months after he’d been released and he hadn’t done anything evil, so either he was really good at the long con, or maybe he wasn’t as dangerous as the Ministry thought.
Malfoy shifted towards him. Harry didn’t know what that was about, but he was done with this sympathy nonsense, so he leapt out of the chair and pretended to be interested in the plaque on Malfoy’s mantle.
“Yeah, well, I am a whole bisexual wizard. That’s why I started the club in eighth year. It didn’t exist before, even though there’s been quiet meetings of gay witches and wizards for, God, centuries, probably. These kids need to know they’re not alone. Minnie used to sponsor it, but I’ve taken over now that I’m back.”
The Greengrass mansion was, of fucking course, massive and gorgeous. It was all yellow buttery Bath stone and columns.
Three hours later, Harry woke up from a sweaty nap to an insistent paper crane tapping his forehead. He grabbed it, rolled over to reach for his glasses on the nightstand, and heard a crunch.
But he came back with a pointed hat—as if anyone wore those anymore, but he could do him, and besides, the hair thing was clearly still a point of self-consciousness—and lurked in the doorway, shifting from one foot to another.
“Hear me out! So she cornered me at a family dinner one time and was telling me it’s all about aligning your auras and shit, not like, positions or whatever, so like, there’s probably a couple of kids who are super into that, and then you balance her out with like, Hermione. Who’s all in there with the facts and teaching them about condoms and Plan B. Perfect. Panel sorted.” Ron leaned back in his chair with his scone, satisfied.
Hermione’s eyes were a clear, dark brown. She blinked slowly, then glanced at the cottage. “I’m not sure if he knows.”
“It’s faster for two if you’re physically connected,” Malfoy said with a little huff. “It’s basic transportation magic, Potter.”
“Well,” Minerva said slowly. “I think you might rather want to know who it is before making such assumptions.”
“As many of you know, we’ve decided to hold her back from Hogwarts a year because she’s still getting outbursts of temperamental magic, but she’s rather glum about another year at primary even though she’s halfway through already and it would be just lovely if you all could come and get her excited about next year!”
He’d rolled his sleeves up, and Harry was able to see the tattoo on his other arm. It was a bouquet of flowers—narcissus, lily of the valley, poppies, roses, lilacs, carnations, all tangled together and weaving their way up his arm. It must be a magical tattoo, Harry mused, as two tattooed bees drifted in and around the flowers.
He swayed slowly from side to side, widening his eyes at Malfoy and nodding to encourage him. Malfoy seemed a bit like a statue, but he mechanically began moving his feet. He had his eyes fixed on a point over Harry’s shoulder, but, like, Harry wasn’t complaining.
Sirius had promised to make French toast, but, thanks to his persistence upstairs, they were severely behind schedule. Harry popped in through the Floo as Sirius was whisking the eggs.
“Raspberries?” Ron was already sketching the cake in his mind. A ganache, fresh berries on top, at least two layers of cake with espresso to deepen the flavor, yes, it was all coming together.
“Professor Malfoy didn’t explain like, why Hamlet feels so bad about killing Polonius. Shuo asked him twice and he like, didn’t respond. He went all pale and then got really red and started talking about how Puck is a queer-coded character.”
“Got it in one, Potter.” Malfoy could somehow blink sarcastically. His arms were folded across his chest, which seemed to stretch his robes even tighter across his shoulders. Was he wearing some kind of stretch velvet? Had elastic finally made it to pureblood couture?
“Right,” Harry said and put it back down on the table. Then they sprang up, cracker in hand, and said, “I’ll come sit next to you and it won’t explode.”
“What he’s not saying is that he’s quite good at potions,” Neville said. “Especially the ones that require botanical tinctures or essences.”
Ron pressed his lips together and then said, “Yeah, technically, you’re not an Auror, or in the Ministry, so you’re a civilian.”
He was being odd, she thought, and turned her attention back to the bowl of banana chips on the table between them. He’d offered to help her in the garden, which she really didn’t want to work on, and thank goodness Ginny had suggested working up a little rain cloud to coincide with his arrival.
Cho moved her a finger, and the lion’s tail wrapped around her wrist. Posie gurgled in confusion. “It’s inevitable.”
One Sunday, pacing his room like a caged tiger (he didn’t dare to go out flying, for fear of running into Draco in Quidditch leathers), Harry remembered Hermione’s words—
He had to distance himself from this weird train of thought. He shouldn’t be feeling any kind of way one, about a colleague, and two, about Malfoy. Maybe if he stepped on Malfoy’s foot? Malfoy would be sure to be pissed off, and then it would be back to normal. So just as the final beats of the song played, Harry stepped down quite deliberately on Malfoy’s foot. Malfoy didn’t even curse, just winced a little. He seemed a bit far away.
Harry hummed, feeling the subtle shift in the air. Malfoy’s magic was much softer than it’d been as a teenager, which was to be expected, but Harry hadn’t realized how much his magical signature had mellowed. If Harry’s magic was a lightning blaze, crackling and fierce, Malfoy’s magic was like gentle waves or a slowly coursing river, slowly causing shifts in the fabric of space and time.
A general grumble of approval broken by Addie’s cheers. Harry flopped into his chair and sipped his tea.
“Music is a very expressive and emotional medium,” Lavender said with a bright smile. “Can I see some of your playlists?”
Malfoy cleared his throat and fixed his cuffs. He wasn’t wearing his black robes, just a white Oxford without a tie and charcoal grey trousers.
“It’s a sensor,” Harry said, and then realized he didn’t know how those sensors worked at all and he could just tell that Draco was going to open his mouth and ask, so he pointed at a huge blue dildo and said, “What about that one?”
Luna poked Harry in the side and said dreamily, “She wrote a lovely article for the Quibbler, even though nargles are very real.” Harry blinked a few more times. What was happening? How had Parkinson charmed her way into his friends’ circles, and she’d just threatened him?
Malfoy’s grin vanished. Stabbing one very pointy finger into Harry’s shoulder, he hissed, “You don’t understand anything, do you, Potter?”

, we’d gotten sick of begging Fred and Angie to let us visit more often and decided to lure them back by deciding we’d have a baby of our own. Checkmate, Weasleys. Marcus is craving ginger ice cream and boiled peanuts, which are a weird American food we first tried during the 2001 QWC and are just about impossible to buy pre-made in the UK. Dear baby, stop making your dad want boiled peanuts, love, your other father who’s losing his fingerprints shelling raw peanuts. Please send us any and all pregnancy and childcare tips!

“More like having visions of beating your ass at Quidditch,” Harry shot out. Well, that was random. Anything to keep his mind off where it had been.
Rubbish, he thought, and urged his broom upwards. But he felt better as he got into bed. Christmas was tomorrow. That made everything feel better. That and the flying. Nothing else.
“You just have to find uh, a better spell. Then Ginny won’t mind. It’s the, uh,” Neville gestured with one hand and dropped a banana chip on the ground. “Wounds.”
Malfoy was yelling at him on the other side. Happy Christmas to me, Harry thought, and reached for his glasses.
Harry fiddled with a bit of wrapping paper that had fallen into his lap. They’d gotten more couple-y in the last six months and he knew it was because he was at Hogwarts and they were busy and they just hadn’t spent that much time together, but Harry wanted someone to whisper things to and put his arm around on the sofa and he suddenly felt a bit cross and pouty. It wasn’t anyone’s fault he was alone. Or that his ex was happily feeding her girlfriend bits of popcorn off the Christmas tree decorations (was that hygienic?). He just felt rather cross. And that wasn’t anybody’s fault.
“That was delicious,” Andy said, leaning back in her chair with a small moan. “I don’t think I can move.”
“I saw your face in a crowded place,” he stretched out the last word as he reached for his towel, hummed the words he forgot, “there must be an angel with a smile on her face—” he wrapped the towel around his hips, put his glasses back on, and opened the door—“when she thought up that I should be with—”
