“No, Ravi was before the scars.” Draco said. “That was just some random bloke who saw me with my shirt off at a pickup Quidditch match Blaise organized last year.”
Harry had always assumed that Malfoy had been shackled to some equally rich pureblood and gotten married young, but a cursory glance at Draco’s ringless white hand quickly disproved that theory. Anyway, what did Harry have to lose by being forward?
, and for a moment Draco sincerely thought he might faint. He tried desperately to find some words, but nothing remotely coherent came to mind.
"I'm good with bombshells," Harry replied with a grin. "But you can tell me anything you want. Doesn't have to be a bombshell, just something you never tell anyone."
“I think Ron will assume it’s a weird joke that he isn’t getting,” Harry snickered. “Hermione will doubt it at first, then try and caution me against it, but eventually she’ll try to understand.”
“Because apart from how absurdly stupid that would be, it’s terribly unfair that you should already have several names for me, when all I can call you is Potter.”
“But...” Draco began cautiously. “Obviously this is all in fun; I mean, you don’t really want to, of course.”
Luckily his sarcasm still didn’t seem to offend her, and she laughed again, shifting the fidgeting Rose on her lap. “Everything about Ron made me happy, even as a child. That’s never changed. We’ve always been perfectly well matched.”
“Ah, Harry,” Draco moaned. He was just a breath away from finishing; he could feel it closing in on him. “Give me your cum, feed it to your whore…”
Draco froze and gaped at him, standing in the door looking like a fucking Greek god, his perfectly sculpted torso covered with scars and hair and oh, so much
Draco seriously considered the offer for a moment. If he was honest, he really did want to stay, even though he knew it was a terrible idea. The lines between professionalism and friendship had already blurred in a way that couldn’t be undone, and while Draco knew that Harry shouldn’t be anything to him but the subject of an article, he also knew, without a doubt, that he was falling for him. And that couldn’t be undone either.
“I’ll miss your peppermint tea,” Draco muttered. He looked up at Harry and allowed him the tiniest of smirks. Harry’s warm eyes made any embarrassment well worth it.
One look in the mirror after Draco had used the toilet and he felt grateful that Harry hadn’t opened his eyes: he was an utter mess. Dark red and purple splotches marked up his neck, courtesy of one Mr. Harry Potter. His hair was a total disaster, sticking out in every which way like… well, rather like Harry’s, though with a decidedly less attractive effect.
“Is there something wrong with my beer, Potter?” Draco said, on edge and clearly prepared to read hostility in any and all of Potter’s words.
But still he couldn’t resist replaying every moment from the night before in his mind: the first moment that he saw Harry’s unglamored face in the pub, Harry’s knee touching his own, the way Harry had made him tea. He turned and stared at the countertop where Harry had muttered obscene sounds into his ear as they stroked each other to completion.
They laid like that for what might have been hours, or years, or mere moments. Draco didn’t care about anything that might be happening outside of this warm cocoon that contained just he and Harry and their very promising future together. He was in love, and that was all there was to it.
Draco found that it felt it strange to hug his mother after nearly a month away from her. He’d gotten used to only hugging Harry for the past three weeks, and hugging Harry was a different experience in every possible way. When Harry hugged Draco, it was without pause, without decorum, and without grace, rather like Harry himself. Harry hugged him like he was offering himself to Draco, no questions asked.
On this June morning in particular, Draco woke smiling, thinking those abstract thoughts that only appear in the other-worldy space between wake and sleep. This time, Draco’s mind was full of vague sensations: something green, something warm, something like a laugh. Despite feeling oddly content, he also felt inexplicably groggy, almost as if he hadn’t gotten enough sleep the night before…
“Five, we don’t have to do any of that, if you don’t want to,” he said, and he looked nervous even with his eyes closed. “I was merely saying it shouldn’t be an option just yet.”
“I just wanted to say sorry,” Harry sighed. He perched himself atop the desk and watched as Draco once again blatantly studied his arms.
“Bells on what, exactly?” he asked, enjoying the sound of Harry calling him cute, even if it was only conditionally.
“I would, and I do,” Draco agreed, sitting beside Harry on the edge of the bed. “Are you sure you want to tell them already?”
“Mother,” he began cautiously, “did you hear that Harry Potter and Ginevra Weasley were no longer a couple?”
Draco laughed, grateful, as ever, for Harry’s ability to channel his cheerful disposition even in the midst of his sadness. “Shall we venture into that territory now, or is that too emotionally heavy as well?”
Before Draco’s head could catch up to reality, Harry reached into his pocket and pulled out a delicate silver wedding band, clutching it between two fingers as casually as if he had been handing Draco a sickle. Draco stared at him, too shocked to move, to think, to draw breath. He didn’t think Harry had been serious about this… but Draco had never in his life been so happy to be wrong.
There was a ferocity in Harry’s eyes that stirred something in him. Harry touched the sides of Draco’s face.
“Very well,” he began. “What do you do with your free time these days, when you’re not busy being a top Auror?”
“Never agree with me when I’m being self-deprecating, Potter!” Draco spouted. “You should really fucking know that by now!”
Rosalind sighed. “I’ll get right to it. You’ll remember from the monthly meeting a few days back that the Prophet has been attempting to set up an extensive personal profile with Mr Harry Potter for the ten-year special edition next month?”
Draco knew the sound he made then was indecently loud, animalistic, raw. He could barely stand the onslaught of sensation as Harry slowly moved his head up and down Draco’s erection, and he laced his fingers through Harry’s thick hair. He was entirely unconscious of anything coming out of his mouth as he threw his head back in complete ecstasy, Harry’s tongue running over the length of his prick with tantalizing slowness.
“No,” Draco said bluntly as he straightened his tie. “As I said, I would prefer not to delve into my personal life, as it doesn’t pertain to this particular incident.”
Harry grinned. “Then why did you pull away, you prat? Because I really, really want to do it again, too.”
He sat up with a jolt, despite having no reason to feel stressed about having slept so late, and he shook his head, feeling disoriented. He didn’t think he had slept later than half past eight in his entire life.
“Yes, well, it’s how I am,” Draco repeated Harry’s phrase back to him petulantly, wisely choosing to ignore the ‘sexy’ comment.
Harry Potter shouldn’t hold sway over him. Harry Potter shouldn’t make him hard with just a look. And Harry Potter was going to suffer for it. Even if it was only in his fantasies.
“Whatever you’re about to say, don’t, because it was perfect,” Harry told him. “I just wanted to say thank you, and to tell you that I… well, I loved it.”
“Does ‘don’t move your head’ mean nothing to you, you wanker?” Harry asked, sighing again as he made himself comfortable.
Something about Harry’s calm demeanor made Draco feel even more ruffled, as if to make up the difference. They had always gotten to each other; why were they suddenly acting so very...normal? It made Draco feel vaguely anxious. Stupid Potter and his stupid grubby clothing that made him look like a bad boy, stupid Potter who somehow carried the look off better than Draco wanted to admit. Draco realized he was staring at Harry’s body and pulled his eyes away.
“I considered doing that, actually,” Harry said, resting his hand on the other side of Draco’s legs so that he was leaning comfortably over him. (Well, if this mug hadn’t broken his composure, nothing would.) “And let me guess, alternative career paths was one of your remaining questions?”
A moment passed and then Draco felt Harry nudge him. Draco looked over to see one of Harry’s beguiling half-smiles, and his heart started beating faster.
“I already miss talking to you,” Draco whispered. He couldn’t help himself. Harry just made him say stupid things. “Wake up so I can hear what you have to say.”
“That first time, at Madam Malkin’s,” Draco pushed. “You seemed inclined to hate me from the very first moment.”
“I kind of wish I was the one on this case,” Harry said after a moment, thinking out loud. “I'd love to catch this fucker. Because I really hate him, you know.”
But yeah, I really hope you enjoy this extremely questionable plot-free chapter, and I'll see you soon... :S
As hard as he tried, he couldn’t stop himself from stealing glances at Draco as they walked back into the house in awkward silence. The prat was avoiding his eye, but bloody hell, even the back of his blonde head was appealing. Not to mention his arse.
“Don’t you dare try and joke right now!” Draco shouted suddenly, surprised at the overwhelming emotion in his voice. He felt a deep, vitriolic hatred for these strangers. “How can they have gotten away with any of this? How did no one stop them? You’re Harry bloody Potter!”
Harry and Draco were practically panting in sync as Harry slid his finger all the way into Draco’s hole. Draco was moaning loud, too loud, indecently loud, as Harry moved his finger inside, pushing in, pulling out, so gently that Draco thought he might explode with want. Draco was writhing, out of control, alight with the devastating pleasure of it.
Draco sighed and filled his kettle from the sink. “I’m fine, Potter. Everything intact. But for my ego, perhaps.”
They stared at each other for a moment, until eventually Draco realized that he had very much lost the plot somewhere along the line, for this had certainly become far more than mere teasing. This wasn’t flirting; this was
you to pick up their quaffle,” Draco concluded for him. “You need to be needed. You need someone who needs you.”
“Their house,” Harry informed him. “Just a casual hangout, nothing fussy. And they don’t care if you record them either, by the way, I already asked. So, yeah, Ron’s gonna cook an early dinner for us first, if you’re okay with that.”
Draco rubbed his cock as he listened to Harry’s grunts and moans, and he let himself be as vocal as he wanted to as well. His cock felt incredible.
Draco let loose a peeved little scoff, and before he could stop himself, he swung the back door open and marched down the pathway and into his garden.
“I’ll be sure to cure you of that foolishness this evening, you adorable man,” Draco said, smiling indulgently as he touched his hand briefly to Harry’s back. His heart was pounding.
I don’t know, Malfoy, I just want to return your wand to you, alright? Don’t make it weird. Will you meet me at the Leaky Cauldron for a drink? Tomorrow night? Eight ish?
“Good evening,” Draco responded in his professional tone. “Thank you for having me into your home. I appreciate your willingness to be interviewed.”
Eventually, Harry decided that he needed to think of other things instead. Predictably, the first 'other thing' his mind supplied him with was a certain handsome blonde with impossibly soft hands. Well, anyway, at least the Draco issue was something he had a bit of control over. After ruminating on each and every emotion he’d felt the previous night (and numbly consuming four of the warm scones out of nervousness), Harry decided he couldn’t stand it any longer. He had to know exactly how monumentally he had fucked things up with Draco the night before, and to see if anything could be done about it.
“Not like that, Potter,” he said quickly, though he wasn’t sure he hadn’t, in fact, meant it like that. The alcohol was taking him to places he didn’t recognize. “I mean I worked all day and these aren’t exactly walking shoes, so I can probably handle another half hour before falling over from a crippling blister. Plus I don’t live too far from here. Close enough to walk. If you want. Up to you.”
Draco decided that he was done talking about his childhood now… and also that Harry’s little half-smile was truly going to drive him off the deep end sooner than later.
Harry shivered, and promptly shifted in his seat to disguise it. Draco pulled back and looked at Harry as if he knew exactly what he was doing. Brazen fucker.
As usual, Draco was trying to think of something suitable to say, and as usual, Harry beat him to the punch.
“Well, as much as I’d love to sit here and debate the merits of proper skincare with you, I do believe you’re cutting it rather close for time.”
Leaning over the bowl just in time, and before he could even think, he vomited violently into the toilet, mentally (and physically) groaning with humiliation.
“Well, sure, but you cheated at least three times,” Harry said, happy to see another glimpse of the old Malfoy in Draco’s face. “If you’re counting that, then yeah, it was pretty even.”
“But I think I’ve become rather good at reading you, Potter,” Draco said, as confidently as he could. “And I don’t think you like it when I leave you alone.”
“Oh, have I pissed off the great Harry Potter?” Draco asked, delighted, adding a spoonful of sugar to his teacup. “In that case, yes, I believe we are in for a glorious summer…”
“Well, that’s easy for you to say, Saint Potter,” he spat. “Undoubtedly your precious muggle family worshipped the ground you walked on.”
Draco lost himself for a moment in the brand new feel of Harry’s mouth. He tasted tea and biscuits in their kiss, and it made tears spring to his eyes, because even though this was a first, Harry tasted like home.
“Before I go, are you still on track with the Potter feature?” she asked, switching gears once more. “I imagine you’re getting to the end of the interview portion by now? Story itself is coming together?”
Draco relished the feeling that Harry knew him so well as to know that teasing was the exact right thing to do at this moment. He was starting to really believe that Harry knew him better than most people, and he suddenly wanted to spend hours testing that theory.
Draco shrugged it off, but suddenly he wanted to tell Harry all of his thoughts, every single one of them, as soon as they popped into his head. Thoughts like…
“The more I think about it, the more I realize that I’ve actually always found it fairly easy to trust you,” he stated. “I mean, for the most part, anyway.”
Harry grinned back at him and planted a quick peck on Rose’s forehead (Draco caught a whiff of his masculine scent; oh god, he couldn’t be trusted to have Harry so close to his face), then he kicked off and joined Ron in the air. Draco sighed; Harry was dashing on a broomstick, and that was the only word for it. Fucking dashing.
Draco gawked at him as he turned and walked back to the bed, flinging his glasses carelessly onto the nightstand before flopping face-first onto the mattress.
He hadn’t even realized he was saying it until it was already out, but he couldn’t take it back now. He didn’t even
“Yes, I’m single,” Harry confessed quietly. “And something tells me you have more experience flirting with men in coffee shops than I do.”
Draco truly did feel like coming as he watched Harry slowly place his soaked finger against Draco’s entrance. Their eyes met and Draco barely held it together as Harry pushed his finger slowly, so slowly, inside Draco.
Harry rolled his eyes and yawned again. “I’m not keeping track anymore. I’ll just compliment you freely, all the time.”
“Yep,” Harry told him, smiling. “Sorry to disappoint you and your penchant for peppermint, but in this household, they favor a good strong Earl Grey. I know you’d rather have coffee anyway...”
They both took a synchronized bite of bacon and grinned at each other. Draco thought to himself how altogether lovely it was to simply have someone with him at his breakfast table, eating together companionably. It made such a nice change that he thought he would be happy if anyone sat across from him, but the fact that it was Harry made it all so much
“To anyone with the slightest bit of compassion,” Harry muttered, still clearly incensed, but trying hard to keep himself in check. (Forced self-control was a new look for Harry Potter, one that Draco definitely didn't hate). “How can anyone force someone into a marriage where there’s no love?”
“The very same,” Harry nodded. “Ron’s actually got a good mind for business. George is more in charge of the creative aspect--inventing, marketing, that sort of thing--but Ron’s a genius with bookkeeping and finances and all the technical, upkeepy stuff that George is pants at.”
Draco tried to settle his heartbeat and get his bearings. He was in his bedroom… but he hadn’t fallen asleep in his bedroom. He distinctly remembered, as a matter of fact, falling asleep on Harry’s muscular, Weird Sisters t-shirt-clad chest, the fireplace still crackling and the radio playing something Draco hadn’t been conscious enough to make a mental note of. Why, then, was he waking up here in his bed, when he should be in his sitting room, lying on top of Harry Potter?
“It’s really nice hearing you laugh,” Harry murmured, staring at his pink lips. His eyes were starting to get heavy.
“So you’re absolutely sure you don’t want to come with me tonight?” Harry asked the next afternoon, absently fiddling with the buttons on Draco’s crisp white shirt.
“I really couldn’t say… years of practice, I suppose--” Draco murmured, licking his lips. His whole body was vibrating. “Only wanking. No touching each other. Agreed?”
Draco knew it was illogical; it made no sense that wanking was allowed and touching each other was not. But nothing made sense at the moment. Only Harry and his wildly green eyes, Harry and his shallow breathing, Harry and his hard cock.
“I dunno, I don’t think your complexion has suffered at all,” Harry said, squeezing his hands. “I think your complexion looks rather coddled, as a matter of fact.”
Draco snorted at him; served him right for tormenting him with Patrick sodding Hunter. Draco sent another bean flying his way and Harry caught it effortlessly.
Slowly, he licked his lips, wrapped his hands around his own cup and leaned forward. Like a magnet, Draco did the same. They locked eyes once more.
“I’ve not dated much, to be honest. Ginny was my first real relationship. My only real relationship, I reckon.”
“You’ve managed to avoid talking about the war for four interview sessions now,” Draco said softly. “Do you think it’s time?”
“My wand,” Draco answered pragmatically. Harry was just glad that he’d answered the question at all, after being informed that questions were off limits.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, still grinning. Now that he and Draco were in the same room again, he really couldn’t help his grin. “What of it?”
Draco tried and failed to avoid sneering at him. “I was hoping we could keep this civil, at the very least, Weasley.”
Draco simply couldn’t wait a moment longer, even though Harry only had a couple bites of sandwich left. He wanted to show Harry exactly how much his words had meant to him, exactly how he felt about him. And he wanted to show him right this very minute.
that cologne? He smelled like a fucking woodland nymph in a fucking fairytale. Harry had to lean away from him to keep his bloody hormones under control, and, consequently, he kept tilting awkwardly towards Ron at the snug table.
Draco decided that two firewhiskeys were just enough to make him plunge forward with honesty. In for a knut, in for a galleon, he supposed.
"It’s a risk I’m not sure I’m ready to take," Draco added, "as both of those outcomes are equally terrifying."
Harry took the magazine from him without comment (though he did bestow an indulgent wink) and set it on the nightstand. He handed Draco a fresh mug of steaming peppermint tea (‘Official Wand Inspector,’ this one read, with a picture of a particularly handsome, shirtless wizard leering suggestively at them) before perching carefully on the edge of the bed.
Draco heard and felt Harry’s heavy breathing against his neck, felt his own leaving his mouth, and he could honestly say that he could die at this moment and regret absolutely nothing. Harry was all over him, every inch of him, consuming his thoughts, and it was exactly as it should be.
“Sure we can,” Harry argued. “Especially if that would mean I wouldn’t have to wait forty minutes for you to come out of the sodding bathroom.”
“And my face is, like… right in your face,” Harry continued, almost nervously, moving his head backward a few inches and propping his body up on his elbow.
“And any updates or changes I should be aware of, since our quick debriefing at St Mungo’s last night?”
Draco was moaning loudly, lost in Harry’s ministrations, until the tip of Harry’s tongue entered his hole. He nearly screamed, and he tensed immediately, peering down at Harry, who looked back at him with wide eyes.
She held her hand up and took a long swig of whiskey. “The less I know, the better. I make it a point to stay far, far away from office relationships. And anything involving the male anatomy. No offense, of course, mate.”
“Yeah, turns out Malfoy’s not nearly as bad as we thought,” Harry stated, grinning at Draco as he said it.
“It’s nice to see you, too,” Harry said, grinning, and Draco smiled back at him. “The interview rooms are on the opposite end of the building, and it’s kind of easy to get lost, so I’m only here as your escort.”
Birds were singing in the garden as they held each other beside the fragrant rose bush, which Harry had christened, only that morning, the Farewell Point. He was due at the Auror office in a little while, and Draco had once again willingly agreed to see him off.
“You better love my arse, Malfoy, you’re stuck with it now,” Harry mumbled, leaning forward and planting his mouth against Draco’s throat. His stubble tickled in a delightful way. “You taste like an orchard.”
“Alright, fine,” Draco sighed. “If you really want me to be there when you tell them, I will come with you tonight.”
“I imagine they’ll need to prepare in advance for such a noteworthy issue,” Hermione explained with a sigh. “Particularly for an interview of that magnitude.”
“Well I suppose it beats foolishly standing outside in the freezing cold weather,” Draco said stiffly.
“That’s not going to happen,” Harry said adamantly. “If it was going to happen, it would’ve already.”
Draco remembered, alright. He remembered the many grand events that were thrown in this house, dinner parties held for the very best of society. He had always adored creeping back downstairs after he had been sent to bed, watching sneakily from the hallway as the guests floated all around the ballroom in their elegant finery. The decorum and prestige had always delighted him as a boy, like it was all a delectable dream world that he would someday be invited into.
. Before he could even register his own reaction, Harry’s hand slipped further across his body, sliding down onto his arse. (Not so innocuous, then.)
“Bollocks,” Draco said, taking another sip of his tea regardless. “Although, this certainly isn’t half bad.”
Draco could tell this was also an unfavorable topic for Potter. His dislike was written plainly on his face. “Not especially.”
“Incredibly,” Draco said, smiling wide before they kissed each other again. This kiss was softer, less desperate, more intimate. Harry’s hand was on his neck, the other clutching his arm. Draco couldn’t wait any longer; he reached down once again and pulled Harry’s jeans down another few inches at the front, freeing his hard cock. Draco kept kissing Harry even as he stroked his erection, delighted when he felt Harry shudder against him.
“Hi,” Harry greeted, barely resisting the impulse to wrap Draco up in a tight hug. A broad grin, on the other hand, simply couldn’t be helped. Sweet Merlin, he’d missed the man.
“Little bit,” he said, a gross understatement, before finishing the last of his first butterbeer and picking up the new one. He didn’t remember anyone ever asking him that question before.
Potter only glared at him as he walked away. Draco tried to wipe the smile off his face but he couldn’t help himself.
“I am bloody telling you, Draco!” Harry pulled at his hair in frustration. “You’re just not listening to me!”
“As you know,” she continued, “we were given the opportunity to take seventh year later on, which all three of us did, so I don’t feel as if I missed out on anything, academically speaking. And what we were doing during that year off was obviously necessary. But most importantly, I could never imagine
Harry rolled his eyes as he watched Draco set everything up, still grudgingly fascinated by his stature and his mannerisms. He’d never seen anyone else move the way Draco did, like he was in slow motion, almost like a dream. Honestly, he was practically a unicorn. Or a ghost, with that pale skin and white-blonde hair. And those diamond eyes…
“Yes, I have it, thank you,” Draco said with the tiniest of smiles at the mug. “Perhaps you missed your calling; you would’ve made a good mediwizard.”
Draco snorted out a laugh and just looked at him. Merlin’s beard, an aroused Harry Potter was the most beautiful specimen he’d ever laid eyes on.
He realized too late that this was a bit of an insensitive thing to say, and he bit the inside of his cheek to avoid spouting off again. Draco sighed and looked up at him.
Part of him thought Draco would dismiss the apology and tell Harry to stop being so ridiculous. But another part, a much bigger and more optimistic part, hoped that Draco might tell him that he didn’t mind Harry’s forwardness. That he might’ve even liked it. That maybe he wanted Harry to be even more forward. That he wanted Harry to tell him how handsome he looked in that white shirt and tie, and to lean his head on him, and to nuzzle up in his neck, and to stay that close for so long that they would smell like each other all day.
Draco actually laughed at that, and Harry looked up at him, his face confused and slightly self-conscious.
“Well, I asked… I mean I asked if we were friends… and I asked if we could leave the pub… Kind of because of what we were talking about earlier. And honestly it’s why I felt maybe a little too comfortable talking about those stereotypes… I mean it’s all for the same reason...”
Harry grinned at him, mercifully with his mouth closed, and picked up his tea cup and another biscuit.
“I want you to know that I’m not who I used to be,” Draco finally said, and he felt the profound truth of it in his bones. Perhaps he wasn’t Malfoy anymore. Perhaps he was just Draco.
He laughed, and oh, it was such a lovely sound. “If I hated you as much as you say, then surely I owe you many such compliments.”
“I know you won’t fail,” Harry said, knowing that it was true. “But if you’re that concerned, then I’ll just be a cooperative saint, and we’ll tackle this together, and you’ll write a damn good, super-flattering feature. What do you think?”
Harry just smiled at him as if he held the sun, moon, and stars in his hand. Suddenly Harry gripped his arm tightly and spun on the spot, apparating them both into Draco’s bedroom.
Draco lifted his head and stared at Harry. His eyes were uncharacteristically shifty, and he was sucking his lower lip between his teeth.
But Draco couldn’t help the warm thought that trickled over him now: that maybe, after all that they’d been through, Potter knew him better than most. And for once in his life, he felt hopeful that maybe someday he wouldn’t have to feel ashamed of that.
Draco hummed in response and Harry pulled him by both hands into the sitting room, not letting his eyes leave Draco’s face the whole way there. Draco laughed when they bumped up against the door frame, and Harry smiled before he kissed him again.
It sounded to Draco like she was mocking him more than she was asking him. Before he could answer, she continued.
“He’s a funny little kid,” Harry said, smiling fondly into his tea. “He always has a different hair color when I see him.”
“Incredibly, no,” Draco said, chuckling a little as well. Harry smiled over at him; well, at least the ice was somewhat broken now.
Harry grinned at his familiar disdainfulness. Sometimes Malfoy was just so very… Malfoy. When on earth had that become a good thing?
“Good to know,” Draco murmured. “Let me collect my things. Alex has been known to make surprise reappearances.”
Draco could easily imagine exactly what he was seeing. Every time he had his shirt off he saw them too, though the sight almost never affected him anymore. Draco sometimes even found that he rather liked how they looked, and he certainly didn’t care that Harry had been the one to leave them there. What bothered him now was that looking at Draco had made Harry’s eyes lose their spark; something about Draco had extinguished Harry’s fire. That hurt a thousand times worse than he thought it could.
“Harry,” Draco whispered, and then he laughed, because the casual discussion of their future was making him feel slightly lightheaded and he had forgotten what he was going to say.
Of course Harry would be thinking about other people's feelings at a moment like this; selflessness was another one of his best qualities. But if Draco was honest, he hadn't even thought about Hermione's news in light of his own personal life; his first and only concern had been for Harry, and that was new and terrifying for him.
Draco pursed his lips, though truth be told he was quite flattered that Harry had once again remembered such miniscule details that he’d only mentioned in passing.
“I’m guessing I wouldn’t have been allowed even without the Prophet piece, though, given our history… Mine and yours, that is.” Harry paused, nervously running a hand through his hair once he realized how that sounded. “I mean, not our romantic history, but just in general… not that we have a romantic history or anything, of course. I mean. Well. A couple weeks is not really a history, is it? Not that we’ve been doing anything romantic for the last couple weeks. Maybe like a day or two--”
“I know,” Harry agreed, nodding. “But I’m not ashamed of you, Draco, and I hate that you think I am.”
“Erm,” she finally stuttered, “Right. Well, would you like something to drink, Malfoy... Draco? I’ll heat the kettle.”
“There will never be anyone else for me, either,” Draco whispered in his ear. “I’m yours, for always. Willingly, blissfully, devotedly yours.”
“Don’t you dare fucking start calling yourself that again!” Harry was shifting back and forth on his feet like a bull ready to charge. “And you know that’s not how I feel!”
“Merlin’s beard, you are incredibly irritating, you know that, Potter?” But Harry didn’t think he sounded all that irritated.
His mother, on the other hand, had always innately understood this about Draco. But Harry Potter? For her to accept that her only child was in a relationship with Harry Potter, the archenemy of the family’s former Master, was a tall ask. Draco knew his mother would struggle to grasp it. He himself could still barely grasp it, and he’d had three weeks to process it all.
Draco gave his head a quick shake, frustrated with himself. Reacting so strongly to an innocent caressing of hands was simply not normal. To be fair, he was so incredibly starved for touch at this point in his life that practically anything could set him off. He hadn’t exactly been given an abundance of snuggles as a child, and he’d had so few romantic encounters in his lifetime that even weaving two fingers between Potter’s was enough to give him a bloody stiffy.
Draco felt the world stop for a moment, then two, then three... and then just as suddenly, it whirred back to life, shimmering with light and energy and possibility. Everything in him shifted, clicked into place, became quiet and blaringly loud at the same time. He was in love with Harry. He was always going to be in love with Harry.
“Definitely,” Harry replied, emphasizing his point with an enthusiastic nod. “But you can put your quill back down; we’re still on you.”
Harry’s head whipped to the side, ready to attack whichever arsehole had interrupted them; his overwrought nerves were making him extra jumpy.
Draco just looked at him, and Harry didn’t know what to say, because as ashamed as he was to admit it, he truly didn’t know the answer.
Before Harry could get a good look at his face, Draco stood abruptly, using his wand to take over stirring the spoon as he wandered swiftly across the kitchen and over to the stove. Fuck, the way he walked… His arse in those trousers… Harry rubbed his forehead and tried to find his way back down to earth. He plum forgot what bloody day of the week it was.
“You’re a fool if you say you’d take anything but emergency supplies,” Draco insisted. “And perhaps some money, and valuables.”
“Perhaps now,” Draco agreed, though it wasn’t quite the truth. “But you got under my skin every time I saw you, back at Hogwarts.”
“I’m fairly certain you don’t, Potter,” Draco said in a barely audible voice. He could feel himself being pulled in closer, leaning towards Harry as if they were magnets of opposite poles.
He had never in a million years expected Potter to return his old wand to him, however. He had assumed that the wand had been destroyed, or perhaps kept safe in some kind of war archive. Now faced with the possibility of possessing it again, he found that he did miss it.
“Yes, for the moment, at least,” Hermione said, rolling her eyes and dropping down onto the couch. “Ron’s just going to sit with her for another minute.”
“And I’m also sorry for surprising you like this, I suppose,” Harry continued, patting the desk to beckon Draco to sit beside him. “You hate being surprised.”
Harry closed the short distance between them and kissed Draco slowly. They took their time with the kiss, exploring and savoring each other.
“That was your worst compliment yet,” Harry said once his laughter had subsided. “In fact, I think it was just a straight insult.”
“Actually, I think I was one of the few who knew you weren’t nearly as bad as you thought you were,” Harry told him.
“Former Death Eater.” Harry smiled when Draco rolled his eyes at him. Harry leaned against the counter as Draco put the kettle on the stovetop. “And technically I didn’t actually see you sicking up. Just… running for the bathroom.”
“Yeah. He’s a really good kid. Your aunt looks after him, for the most part,” Harry said slowly. “But I try to have him over every second weekend, or more, whenever I can.”
“Because you’re bloody perfect! You’re the perfect human, and you’ve always been too good for me, and that’s a fact!” Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest. He wasn’t about to back down now. “You can lie to yourself all you want and pretend that I’m this lovely new version of Draco, redeemed and reformed, but my past isn’t simply going to float away just because we both want it to, Harry. The things I’ve done will never be erased.”
“Yes, Snape,” Draco mumbled, feeling a little self-conscious. “And I thought his nose was regal and distinctive, if you must know. Anyways, I thought I told you no follow-up questions?”
“I leave everything to my boyfriend,” Harry said. “Especially my Gryffindor jumper that he secretly adores, which he’ll never admit to.”
Draco was genuinely proud of himself for abstaining from rolling his eyes at that. A rumble of defensiveness filtered through his body to join the nerves already vibrating there, and he placed both hands flat on the table to keep from clenching his fists.
Draco snuggled up against Harry’s arm and sighed blissfully. “Alright, shall we discuss how our evenings went, now that we’re both feeling sexually gratified? At least, for the time being?”
“I don’t read that tripe, Potter.” It was the only thing Draco could reasonably manage to say. Potter was bisexual. Potter was interested in women… and men. Potter was no longer with the Weasel’s sister. Draco was speechless at the sudden onslaught of revelations. He felt his head spinning and wished he was sober. And sitting down. He took a deep breath.
Harry sighed. “Next time? For all the ground we’ve covered today, I feel like I’ve been emotionally hit by the knight bus. Is that okay? If I put it off again, I mean?”
“I think I always wanted to snog you,” Draco finally admitted. “I always thought you were fit. But the first time I remember having real, undeniable feelings--outside of my constant internal debate about whether I wanted to kiss you or hit you, that is--was when they brought you to Malfoy Manor, when your face was all messed up.”
Harry smiled gently at him, but it was less teasing and more… something. “I really am sorry for laughing.”
“Yes, we never asked you, did we?” Hermione chimed in. “As we said, it was Harry’s request, but we figured it was a fairly safe bet; most people like it.”
“It is not a normal question for anyone on this earth but you, you overly heroic, interfering, ridiculous man!”
To his disappointment, Malfoy’s face had suddenly hardened into the mask he had worn so often at Hogwarts. Harry definitely preferred a smiling Malfoy, but when he was glaring like this, he almost looked like he was made of marble. A work of art. He made Harry’s pulse quicken...
“It’s a good wand.” Harry shrugged. He leaned back in the chair and flung an ankle up to rest on his knee. Draco liked how at home he looked there, on his chair, drinking his beer. It felt nice.
A couple of hours into the interview, after an extensive and frankly brutal discussion about Sirius, Draco sat back in his chair and looked at him with a gentleness Harry wasn’t used to seeing in those patrician features.
As he and Harry raced merrily around the pitch in the crisp afternoon breeze, Draco couldn’t for the life of him remember why he didn’t do this more often. There was truly nothing like it.
All the blood in his body seemed to simultaneously drop to his feet. He clutched his hair between his fingers like a lunatic and groaned, all of the pieces finally clicking into place, and yet making no sense whatsoever.
“I just want to say thank you for being so patient. And understanding. And… just really great, on the whole.” Harry graced him with a shy little side-mouthed smile, and fuck, Draco loved everything about it.
Harry rolled his eyes at Ron’s usual joke and blew wet kisses all over Rose’s face and belly. She giggled in her sweet way, and when Harry pulled away from her, he knew was smiling as happily as she was.
The revelation finally hit Draco squarely between the eyeballs like a well-aimed bludger. Potter was The Stranger from the other night?
falling for each other, hard and fast. Why did Draco ever bother to resist? There was absolutely nothing he could do to stop this. He decided from that moment on, as he watched Harry’s chest rise and fall, that perhaps just letting it happen was the best option anyway.
“Very productive,” Draco told him, crossing his legs and leaning back. “As it happens, I can accomplish a great deal when you’re not around to distract me.”
He didn’t venture anything else, and Draco was familiar enough with Harry’s tone of voice to know not to press him further. Draco had been wrong about so many things, but now he knew that he’d been right about at least one: Harry Potter wasn’t always happy.
“Hmm?” Draco whispered back, completely losing his train of thought as he ogled Harry’s handsome face.
Harry had always been inordinately fascinated with Malfoy in school, and now that they were older, he found it ever-so-slightly easier to admit that to himself. He’d always been particularly captivated by the way Malfoy moved, almost as if he was a wild animal, graceful and commanding and dangerous all at once. His actions were deliberate, always so very aware, shrewd, calculating. The opposite of Harry, and thus vastly interesting to him.
“Thanks,” he muttered. “I mean… I still don’t really know if I want to come out yet. I’m not sure… Can I think it over?”
The feeling was very much mutual, but Draco couldn’t find his own voice again. As always, Harry completely overwhelmed him.
Harry peered at the notes while Draco busied himself in the kitchen, spelling his cup full of tea. Under the first question, regarding his name, he had written, ‘
a human being,” Harry agreed kindly. “There’s a hell of a lot more to you than your worst parts, Draco. I know you’re not all good, but you don’t seem to realize that you’re not all bad, either. Not even close.”
Draco consequently took a final step back so that he was up against the wall, and he folded his arms across his chest defensively.
“Yeah, cheers,” Ron replied, and he grinned at Draco. “I think Uncle Malfoy here needs one as well. He’s looking a bit thirsty.”
Draco’s eyes lit up with mirth. “A fellow Hogwarts alumnus, then, albeit a cheeky one. Probably a Slytherin as well. And you are a man, I presume, underneath that glamor charm?”
“Ah, I see how it is,” Harry said playfully, brushing his fingers lazily against Draco’s arm while Draco mindlessly fingered the hair on Harry’s chest. “You only said you were a virgin to appease my jealous arse, is that it?”
“No! I don’t want any of you to die!” Harry screamed, spinning around helplessly as they formed a circle around him, reaching for them in anguish. But he couldn’t grasp any of their vaporous flesh. They were dead. It was his fault they were dead. He couldn’t save them.
Draco suddenly stood up and moved close to him, closer than Harry was prepared for, close enough to be able to feel the warmth of his chest, for the smell of him to become more of a taste.
“Is this funny to you, Potter?” Draco indignantly sat up and pushed himself away from the toilet, wiping his mouth unsteadily with a piece of loo roll.
But Harry Potter wasn’t just any man. Harry Potter was good, and he was kind, and he cared enough to ask. And that was enough for Draco.
“It wasn’t a dig,” he answered truthfully. “Haven’t I ever told you how much I like your pale skin?”
He sighed. “But anyways, long story short is that they treated me...poorly. They starved me, and verbally abused me, and hit me fairly often, or at least Uncle Vernon did. And my cousin was quite the terror as well, although that’s a different sort of abuse, I reckon. They made me do most of the housework--all the cooking, most of the cleaning, yard work. And I slept in a cupboard under the stairs until I was nearly twelve.”
“I hate that,” Draco muttered with a sulk, and Harry tried his best to ignore the fact that it was utterly adorable. Dammit all, adorable was even worse than handsome.
“Oh yeah, I’m painfully aware of it,” Harry replied. When two people approached them in the narrow hallway, Harry made way for them by moving as close to Draco as he could. Their bodies clumsily bumped up together for too brief a moment, and Harry couldn’t resist squeezing Draco’s hand. He was too close again. Marvellously close.
“I’m constantly surprised when it comes to you, Harry,” Draco replied, unsure exactly what he meant.
Harry reached up and ran his fingers through Draco’s soft blonde hair, and they didn’t speak for a moment.
Harry was already back in the room, standing in front of the bookcase, perusing Draco’s library. He looked over when Draco entered the room.
Draco found himself smirking as he read the letter, and then promptly considering the hard truth that it was the first time he had smirked in far too long. Potter, as always, seemed to draw the whole spectrum of emotions out of him. He fought off the unexpected urge to write back again, despite having several things he was suddenly dying to say, because he really needed to leave now. Best to wait until tomorrow, then.
“All done,” Draco murmured, standing up so quickly he nearly knocked his chair to the floor. Harry was on his feet just as fast.
“Careful, Hermione,” Harry intervened casually, levitating two bottles of butterbeer over to the table before sitting down again. “Draco’s the only one allowed to ask questions. He gets real persnickety about it, actually.”
Draco rolled his eyes at his adorable teasing. At least, he assumed Harry was teasing. It was difficult to get a handle on anything when he was trying and failing to dispel the new mental image of Harry spread out naked in bed, wanking for him, slowly, leisurely, like a torture…
Harry tapped his foot against Draco’s under the table and glared at him even as he grinned. “You’re up to something, Malfoy.”
“No, Harry, that’s not it,” Draco said. But before he could say anything else, Harry saw Ramesh poking his head out the door.
“Everything alright?” he asked, his brow furrowed. “Oh god, you didn’t walk in on anyone naked, did you?”
“Yes, Harry Potter, I’ll go on a date with you,” he answered happily. “Where are you going to take me?”
“Can we please rule out David, at least?” Draco asked, and he seemed so depressed about it that Harry conceded immediately.
“It was a marriage of convenience, I assure you, and nothing more,” Draco continued, desperate to comfort him, yet hoping he didn’t sound like he was. “Meaning that the point of the marriage was to produce an heir, of course.”
“I am lucky,” Draco agreed. “But your mother died to save you. That seems like unwavering love to me.”
“There’s a case my partner and I have been working on for a couple weeks that we’re finally wrapping up,” Harry told him, through a yawn.
Harry woke with a jolt and immediately sat up in bed, furiously heaving oxygen into his lungs as he wiped the sweat from his forehead. He reached for his glasses with a shaky hand and flung his legs over the side of the bed, bending his head between his knees as he took several deep breaths. It wasn’t enough to quell the nausea, however, and he thought he might vomit.
Draco let go of every inhibition as he imagined everything he wanted to do with Harry, every line they could cross together. He wanted to do it all, to have every piece of Harry for his own. His hand twisted vigorously up and down his cock. He could almost feel the magic crackling in the air between them.
After a quick afternoon meeting with Rosalind (and, unfortunately, another depressing run-in with Alex Morris), Draco finally left the Prophet offices as early as he could in order to get a jump on preparations for the evening. Selecting an outfit was embarrassingly high on that list. Oh, fuck it, it was priority number one. He wanted to look nice, even though it was a ‘casual hangout.’ As if that needed to be said; every day was a casual hangout for Potter. Well, if it was casual, he supposed he wasn’t required to bring a hostess gift. Not that he would’ve had any clue what to get Granger or Weasley.
Draco didn’t want to. He wanted to leave the entire incident deep down inside of him, amongst every other rotten experience he'd gone through, and let it fester there. He didn’t want to give Harry any more of his bad parts.
“I still talk to her every so often,” Harry continued. “She’s married now, with a kid on the way. Her husband’s cool too; I had lunch with him a couple months ago. Works in another department at the Ministry.”
Well, Draco could ignore that, he thought. He would have to. He couldn’t allow himself to think about Harry’s unsinkable optimism, his easy temperament, his sharp wit, or his impressive physique. And he certainly couldn’t think of Harry’s hurt puppy dog eyes when Draco had cruelly told him that he never would’ve asked him to dinner. He realized now that the statement had been a lie. Merlin’s pants, Draco was supremely tired of lying.
Draco sighed. “My father, by contrast, never had the upper hand. He only thought he did. I suppose, in a sense, he taught me how easy it is to lose control. He made me realize that I never want to lose it again.”
As he reentered the sitting room, Draco arranged the biscuits neatly on the plate with his wand. He saw that Harry was seated comfortably on the couch, one arm flung over the backrest and his ankle resting casually on his knee, as it was before.
As calmly as he could, Draco shed his black blazer and took a deep breath. Composure. That was key. Don’t think about anything, just remain calm.
He lifted Harry’s hands to his face and kissed them both, and Harry tried not to let it distract him.
Draco was glad to hear that Harry had apparently changed his tune about dying alone, but he still felt strangely cautious. He’d experienced such a multitude of emotions today that anything Harry said right now might hit his last nerve and destroy him.
Harry took a bite of the pink confection and chewed thoughtfully, once more tilting his head to the side. Draco waited for his verdict.
Draco looked up at Harry, who was already looking back at him, and something passed between the two of them, something bright and potent. Draco had known his crush on Harry was growing into something beyond his control, but this felt like more… this was so much
All of a sudden, his breath was coming in shallow huffs, and before Draco could command himself to stop shaking and maintain some semblance of his dignity, Harry was in front of him. He gently took the cup of tea from his hands and set it carelessly on the counter, grasping Draco tightly by the arms. Draco didn’t have it in him to object. He was shaking, and he was numb, and he was cold…
“I thought you didn’t care about looks?” he managed to whisper, placing a gentle hand on Draco’s neck.
Harry moaned, and the tortured bliss on his face drove Draco to insanity. He couldn’t stand it for one second longer.
Draco ran his thumb over the tip of Harry’s cock and used the precum to lubricate himself and Harry. He wanted more, wanted to make Harry even harder for him, wanted to see if it was even possible. He grabbed his wand from his back pocket and hastily shot a lubricating spell at his own hand, slicking up Harry’s cock first and then his own, before dropping his wand to the floor.
“Paris is beautiful in the summer,” Draco said wistfully. “The gardens there are completely lovely.”
“Oh, obviously,” Draco said sarcastically. “Any fourteen year old deserves to be attacked five against one.”
“I hope you’re not married to those clothes, because Rose is going to spill something on you,” Harry warned him, moving into the sitting room as his pulse still raced. He needed to focus on other things before he pounced on Draco like a bloody feral cat.
He tried to think of a way to say all that without sounding insulting, but it was impossible to form any coherent thoughts at all when he could taste Harry’s breath on his tongue, feel Harry in his pores.
Draco laid his head back down on Harry’s chest. “That bloke may have even gotten somewhere with me, had he not gone off on a tangent about how I owed him a blow job, as some kind of reparation for the damages I’d caused in the war, or something like that.”
“It’s a side effect of having a toddler,” Hermione explained, to no one in particular. “Very hard to focus on anything else.”
“Just close your eyes and envision a list in your head,” Harry explained. “Then… I guess, read it out loud?”
“Hormones, I think,” Harry grinned, but he still looked a bit shy. “Plus I’m a lot more comfortable around you now. You always put me at ease.”
But it was more than that. It was the dreadful awareness of Potter--the way he had always taken up constant residence in his mind--that was now brought to the forefront. Potter was someone that Draco could never really forget completely, given their history, and he’d always accepted that. But over the last four years, he had become just an abstract idea, a large but distant part of Draco’s past. To see him in the flesh again, glamor or not, was jarring.
Harry’s face at least displayed a little bit of emotion at that, even if it was only surprise. He rested a hand gently on Draco’s arm, right over his Dark Mark.
Harry met his eyes then, and the gaze lingered for a moment or two too long. Draco refused to be the first to break it.
I'm not gonna lie, this chapter was a CHALLENGE :S But anyways... she's done lol. Thanks for being here! You're amazing. :)
“Yes, Harry,” he said, grinding his arse against Harry’s fingers. He needed more, needed all of Harry. He had never been more ready for anything. “I need your cock inside me. I need you to fuck me.”
A long while later, after Harry had fallen asleep curled up in his embrace, Draco lay awake, wondering what had set Harry off when they had ended their evening together so cheerfully. He knew better than anyone that the horrific nightmares could creep up without warning at times, but the incident still left him deep in thought. He couldn’t stand to see Harry in pain, and he felt compelled to do something, anything, to ease the burdens that Harry had had to carry for his entire life. By the time Draco finally fell asleep as the sun was peeking over the horizon, he had only one idea.
I would greatly appreciate the return of my wand and so shall meet you at the suggested place and time. Please note that I have fed your owl. (There’s a lesson in brevity for you, Potter, not that you will ever learn.)
Also, I know I said I was going to be posting less often (which still stands), but I finished this chapter in good time, so hey, might as well post it now, right? haha. I really hope you like it. Just so you know, I appreciate and LOVE your comments and kudos more than you can possibly realize… but what I appreciate and love even more is YOU! The fact that anyone reads my work (much less actually enjoys it) truthfully still astounds me, and if you’ve stuck with this story over the past few weeks, please know that I am humbled and grateful. Thank you, my friend. You are very, very appreciated. :)
His mother had immediately seen to it that Draco received only safe mail from then on, implementing a complex piece of magic that filtered through his mail for him: friendly mail could come through, and antagonizing mail was returned to the sender. He did not regret the system, though it made him a little sad to discover how few correspondents remained.
There was a short pause. “Well, tell me what you think about that.” Draco was nervous to hear the answer.
“Yeah, I suppose you’re right,” Harry smiled. “So you’re a relationship bloke too. And obviously a faithful one.”
For a moment he just stared; there were moments when Harry quite simply couldn’t get over how damn pretty Draco's face was, and Merlin, this was one of them.
“I’m a fucking idiot,” he muttered to himself as he made his way to the bathroom, hastily pulling off his clothing as he went.
Draco began rocking his hips, riding Harry as eagerly as he possibly could, his own hard cock bobbing every which way. Their eyes locked and Draco knew he wasn’t going to last long. He gripped his cock in his hand and stroked it furiously, holding Harry’s gaze. He couldn’t stop moaning.
“Just keeping you on your toes, Potter,” Draco smiled back at him. Harry, solving him. How delicious a thought.
Ron stared at him as if he had sprouted a third arm in the middle of his chest. Finally he shook his head and sat back down in his chair. “Harry was right. You really have changed, Malfoy.”
“Yes, I know,” Draco murmured, moving his hands down to tug impatiently at Harry’s jeans before kissing him again.
Their eyes met, and Draco could see genuine remorse in Potter’s face; he really looked on the verge of tears. Draco almost smiled.
“I should go,” Draco said awkwardly, rather than face the fact that he wanted to stay and bask in the glow of Harry and all his precious sunlight. “You’ve bared enough of your soul for one day.”
He remembered, alright, mainly because the announcement had activated an embarrassing flutter of nerves in the pit of his gut. His intense loathing of Potter had faded to nothing years ago, but he couldn’t help but worry about how awkward it might be to run into him now that they were older. However, when Potter had failed to respond to three of the Prophet’s petitions for an interview, Draco assumed the story would have to be scrapped, and he hadn’t given it much thought since.
His body was peppered with scars here and there, and there was a smattering of dark hair across his chest to match the strip of hair below his belly button. His muscles were well-defined but not overly bulky: precisely Draco’s type. The slight V of Harry’s pelvic bone was visible over the top of his low-slung jeans and Draco felt himself blush as he thought about what the metaphorical arrow was pointing at. Harry was truly a sight to behold, and Draco didn’t bother to hide the fact that he was gawking.
He felt the all-too-familiar waves of panic shooting up his legs and arms, and he tossed his book onto the coffee table. He desperately wanted to call out for Harry, to hold him so tightly that he could never escape, but Draco refrained. He hated himself, hated that he was always the weak one, even when the man he loved needed him to show strength.
“So says you.” Harry kissed his cheek. “And it was the weird word combined with the French accent, to be honest. You sound hot when you speak French.”
Draco stared intently into the remaining liquid after he set the glass down, not sure what to say now and feeling more than a little on edge.
“Do you think I’m damaged goods?” Draco was shocked that it had come out of his mouth, in the quietest of whispers. He hadn’t even been aware that he was thinking it. He could feel a lump forming in his throat, and he looked into Harry’s eyes, needing his reassurance more desperately than he wanted to admit.
Again, hope that wasn't too cheesy. I just need me some Drarry romance. There will be some plot advancement in the next chapter(s) so please bear with me. :) In the mean time, feel free to let me know what you think! :)
Draco leaned forward, following the perverse impulse to lick his own mess off of Harry’s chest. He ran his tongue along Harry’s body, cleaning him up, feeling wonderfully vulgar as he swallowed his own cum.
Harry looked down at the page and ignored the daunting list of questions, reading only the line Draco had just scrawled on the top:
“That’s a very long story that I’m certainly not willing to get into,” he stated, much sharper than he had intended.
“You actually understood me? A breakthrough!” Harry exclaimed facetiously, and he and Draco tapped their teacups together, something they’d done several times now. It always made Harry happy.
“Sorry to hear,” Draco said, turning sideways on the bench to face Harry, his legs still folded up under him like a pretzel. The blanket slipped down off of Draco’s shoulder, but he didn’t care. He pulled their joined hands into his lap, giving Harry his full attention.
“Draco time, how adorable are you?” Draco chuckled, ignoring his ever-present self-loathing as well as he could.
He turned back around and faced straight ahead, placing a hand over his chest in a fruitless attempt to calm his suddenly racing heartbeat. What on earth? Surely Potter could not still have this effect on him. Surely it must be the drink.
Harry didn’t know what the hell to do anymore. It was becoming rapidly obvious that something was developing between him and Draco, and it was equally obvious that, for whatever reason, Draco was resisting it. Harry might’ve been able to do the same, if he’d really wanted to. Draco’s rakish new hairstyle, his fairytale scent, the way he had rolled up his sleeves and helped them do the washing up after dinner, watching him with Rose… Harry might’ve found a way to resist all of that, had he not touched Draco’s impossibly soft fingers under the table. All of it together was simply too much for him. As far as he was concerned, his feelings for Draco were a done deal.
Harry smiled. Draco looked absolutely ethereal, his cheeks the most lovely shade of pink, his exquisite blonde hair falling over the pillow like a halo. He was perfect. Gone was Harry’s fear; all he felt now was peace.
“Is that what you want?” Draco knew the answer already, but he was still a little bit nervous to hear Harry’s response.
“Obviously,” Draco replied, his heart full. “You do realize you proposed marriage not fifteen minutes ago?”
was immaculate) and closed the door without further comment, leaving Draco’s jaw on the floor and his cock once again stiff in his pants.
Harry slowly pushed himself back off of Draco and ran a hand through his own hair while he reached into his back pocket. Draco watched, still dazed, while Harry cast a wordless cleaning spell over them.
Harry released a long sigh. The fact was, he was used to nightmares by now. He was used to fear. And somehow, until this very moment, he hadn’t realized just how fucked up that was.
“No, it makes me think of things I’d rather not think of,” Draco admitted without considering it. “I only have Newcastle because it was left over from my birthday party last week.”
“Not a problem, I’m very good at resisting the antics of Slytherins,” Harry told him, though it was complete bollocks.
“Your good sense is one of my favorite things about you, Draco,” Harry said. “But you’re listing off all the things that could go wrong in just about any relationship, not just ours specifically. And I don’t see any reason why we need to let those doubts into this, because despite what
“Don’t think about him. Please. And you know not everyone despises you. I certainly don’t.” He touched those delicate pink lips. “Far, far from it.”
“That I am,” Harry replied. “And speaking of which, I want you to think of me when you touch yourself today.”
“Now, if you’ve quite finished provoking me, may I proceed with my questions?” Draco asked, neatly folding the address and tucking it into a flat pocket inside of his portfolio.
“Be my fucking whore, Draco,” Harry groaned. “Take my cock so deep in your mouth that you choke on it, beg for my cum.”
“Look, I won’t try and make you feel better,” Harry said, holding his hands up in surrender as if he was trying to talk a crazy person off a ledge. “The past is past, my situation sucked, and...I really appreciate both your very flirtatious comment about my face, and the sentiment of your overly dramatic Slytherin ire.”
“Is that what you want, Draco?” Harry breathed out, licking his lips. “You want me to explore your cock with my mouth? You want to shoot your load down my throat?”
Finally Draco’s glance landed on Harry's face, mortified when he felt his lip quivering. “In a minute…”
All through school, he had pictured Harry growing up in a loving household with family who would praise his every accomplishment, no matter how insignificant, praise him simply because he was Harry Potter. The truth of the matter was as different as it could have been. How had he never known, never guessed? For all his observation of Potter, somehow this had entirely escaped Draco’s notice.
Draco practically purred, and he picked up his wand. He shot a lubricating spell at Harry’s cock and then at his own. They uttered simultaneous moans as they massaged the lube all over their erections. Harry was as hard as Draco now, and Draco had to resist the temptation to lean down and suck on his perfect prick.
“Shut up and walk me out, you prat,” Harry grumbled, standing up, taking both of Draco’s hands in his, and pulling him to his feet.
He stripped off his dress shirt and trousers before realizing that he hadn’t brought any fresh clothing with him into the bathroom. He couldn’t simply strut naked into his bedroom and dress freely after showering; he had a
Looking in his eyes, lying near enough that he could feel the heat coming off of Draco’s skin, Harry felt something close to reverence. Draco reached over and took Harry’s hand again, beneath the sheets. (Who knew Draco was such a hand-holder? What a lovely thing to discover.)
Malfoy Manor was undoubtedly a beautiful piece of Gothic architecture; Draco would never presume to deny that fact. But looking upon it now made him feel nothing but a nearly crushing sense of something close to panic. He forced himself to take slow and deliberate steps up the long pathway to the front door, doing his best to ignore the overpowering instinct to turn and run in the opposite direction. He reminded himself that this was no longer the torture chamber that it had been a few years ago. This was his parents’ home, and no one was going to hurt him now, as Draco well knew. He hated how his emotions still managed to overrule that voice of reason.
Harry mulled it over as he absentmindedly sifted his fingers through the bowl of floo powder. On the one hand, it certainly would be nice to be left alone. But then, as much as he valued his privacy, it was still a little depressing to imagine no one caring about him anymore. He immediately cursed himself in disgust for being so hubristic.
Draco chuckled, but his mind had gone down an entirely different road, and he was thinking that yes, Harry, too, was very sweet. And fit. And had a great arse. Probably great in bed, too…
Draco strolled into the Daily Prophet offices, coffee in hand, on Friday morning, a little more than twenty-four hours after what he now referred to as The Unexpected Development. He labeled it thus not because it would lead to anything further, of course, but because it was odd that it had happened at all. More ‘unexpected’ than ‘development,’ he thought.
“What about real feelings, then?” Draco pressed. “You told me those didn’t happen until three weeks ago.”
“Downright bizarre,” Draco agreed, but then he gave Weasley a reluctant smile. “Actually, this is oddly reminiscent of the first night Harry and I spent time together.”
“Oh fuck, sorry,” he said anxiously, pulling his hand swiftly away. “I swear that was not intentional.”
Draco glared at him but finally he gave a reluctant smile. “My apologies. But I’d say you’re just as competitive as I am, anyway.”
“Yes, I couldn’t agree more,” he muttered, before casting a mindful eye at Hermione. She smiled back at him, and his nerves subsided slightly.
Once they had exited the pub, Potter immediately scooted forward beside Draco and wordlessly led them down the crowded street of Diagon Alley. Draco chose not to ask where he was being led, because what did it matter, really? They remained close together underneath the cloak, their arms bumping up against each other as they walked.
“And now you’re referring to yourself in the third person,” Harry laughed. “Could you be any more annoying?”
They both finally looked over at Ron and Hermione… who were staring back at them as if they had both lost their minds.
“Anyway, you have a severe lack of skincare potions here, Potter,” Draco continued. “It’s rather worrying.”
. Well, Draco supposed he was just getting tired; Potter’s voice tended to get low and raspy after talking for too long. It was bloody sexy. “I like being kept on my toes, you know.”
“Right,” he agreed again. “And, like… proper. You enunciate every word. Almost like everything you say is poetry. It’s nice to listen to, really.”
Again Hermione remained silent, and Draco thought that was a much worse form of torture than any other potential reaction. And why shouldn’t she make him suffer? He deserved it. He deserved a hundred times worse.
Draco stepped out of Harry’s master bathroom just as Harry was spreading an extra blanket across the bed. In any other circumstances, seeing Draco emerge sheepishly in one of his old Gryffindor t-shirts, adorable as it was, would have made Harry laugh heartily at him. But he was also wearing a pair of Harry’s grey trackies (sexy), and his hair was still wet from the shower (distracting), and he still looked so forlorn (heart-wrenching), and… he was still hurt.
Draco chuckled, but it wasn’t his usual smug one, and Harry couldn’t decide if he wanted to laugh along or hurl his tea cup directly into Malfoy’s stupid face. Never mind being a full-grown adult; he felt thirteen again.
Draco shrugged back in response, and he tapped his quill against his lips, thoughtful. “I suppose not. Who did you think you were in love with?”
him instead, like they were old friends. He smiled a little bashfully as he peered back down at Rose.
Much to his chagrin, Harry’s did also, when he replied, “Oh I don’t know.” Harry cleared his throat. “Er… the weather. Quidditch. The state of the union.”
Harry moaned against his hole and Draco tried to relax his muscles as he felt the course wetness of Harry’s tongue enter him again. Draco cried out once more, the sensation almost too much for him already. He could feel Harry’s face pressed up close inside his arse, his lips kissing and sucking, and his tongue… fuck, his tongue. Harry’s tongue was inside of him, and he had never felt anything so completely intoxicating before. Draco couldn’t help it; he was being as loud as he had ever been. His hips lifted as if begging for more of Harry, needing him closer, deeper.
“Sooo,” Ron said slowly, as if there was a long string pulling the word from his throat. “Banshee, eh?”
Draco and Harry laid together in silence for a few more minutes. Draco felt warm and sleepy and perfectly happy.
“And if you fuck it up, I’m scrapping it anyway, and if that happens, if we lose this story, I swear to Merlin I will drag your name even further through the mud than it already is and make sure you never write so much as a thank you note from now until the day you die.”
He slowly stood up and leaned weakly over the sink, washing his hands, rinsing his mouth and swallowing a few sips of water while he waited for Potter’s laughter to finally die down. He cast a cleaning charm on his mouth and groaned in quiet shame.
“Of course not.” Draco couldn’t resist the opportunity to brag a little. “Only French and Latin, and a little German. And even less Greek. Italian and Spanish are in the same vein as French, of course, being Romance languages, so I’m conversational, at best, in those. But I’m only really fluent in French and Latin. Though my German is certainly more than passable.”
Draco breathed in deeply through his nose, looking into Harry’s eyes as he did the same. They held their breath for a beat.
“Spaghetti bolognese,” Ron stated in his best Italian accent, placing a gentle hand on Hermione’s back as she led the way into the kitchen. “Doesn’t exactly showcase my amazing culinary skills, but it was Harry’s request.”
“We’ve quarreled half our lives anyway,” Harry said, a little softer this time. “I reckon we’re both used to it by now.”
“Well my concerns are hardly relevant now that we’re lying naked in bed together the day after I’ve voiced them, are they?”
Draco had to admit that there were times when he felt wholly buried by his own self-loathing, and in those dark moments, he couldn’t imagine a single soul on earth not hating him just as much as he hated himself. It was nice, now, to hear that Potter, of all people--Potter, who had seen him at his very worst, time and time again--was capable of defending him. It made him feel... lighter somehow. Not quite fixed, but maybe not quite so broken either.
“I’ll see you tomorrow afternoon, then,” Draco said in his stateliest voice, taking another step backward and turning around, walking towards the door on shaky legs.
“Maybe.” Harry shrugged. “But I don’t think anyone could talk me out of being with you, so I also don’t think that I would be afraid of that.”
“You’re just Draco,” Harry sighed, finally tightening his hold around Draco’s shoulder and pulling him closer again. “I didn’t mean to get frustrated with you. I see what you’re saying now. But I can promise you now that if anyone comes at you, they’ll have me to deal with.”
Harry laughed at him, which was all Draco wanted right then. He didn’t want Harry to feel anything less than wonderful. He wanted to be the one to fix Harry, to heal him, to save him. The very idea that he could feel that way about Harry Potter was terrifying and humiliating and maddening, but he wouldn’t lie to himself anymore: he truly felt that way. He wanted to smile at Harry and laugh with Harry and talk to Harry until neither of them had any words left, and then he wanted to kiss him.
Draco yelled out, louder than he meant to, but he couldn’t stop it. Without consciously thinking about it, Draco took hold of Harry’s cock as well, stroking and rubbing clumsily and eagerly. The sounds Harry was making in his ear were enough to drive Draco to insanity, and he knew he was being equally barbaric, and he loved it, and he couldn’t stop. He couldn’t fucking stop.
“Honestly, you two are like children,” Hermione said fondly. The comment reminded him of something he had been wanting to ask her all evening. Four butterbeers deep seemed as good a time as any, really.
His words were gentle, teasing, but they cut Draco to the quick. Harry was right. Draco owed him some lovely words, because Harry had given him more than a few this evening. More than that, he wanted Harry to hear them. He wanted to speak when it really mattered, for once in his damn life.
Harry breathed out a laugh in sheer relief and closed his eyes. “I think... I’m really hoping I’m interpreting that rhetorical question the right way.”
“For the love of all that is holy, don’t you dare bring it up again,” Draco warned, glaring at him suspiciously.
“I kind of like it, as well,” he admitted, leaning back against the couch and lifting an arm over his head, fiddling with his hair absentmindedly. Draco tried not to stare at the muscles in his arms again, but it was impossible. He tried to shift his gaze to Harry’s ridiculous hair instead, but that was scarcely less distracting.
“I am gay,” he replied, trying his best to remain calm despite his nerves. “I believe the layman's term is ‘beard’?”
“Isn’t it strange?” she asked pensively. “Not so long ago, you and I were fighting for different sides in a war. And now, a decade later, you’re teasing my husband, making tea with my best friend, eating a meal at my kitchen table, playing with my child…”
“Good afternoon, Mr Malfoy,” Ramesh said, stepping out of the room and greeting him with a friendly smile. “Nice to finally meet you. I hope I’m not interrupting anything.”
Unfortunately, any other thoughts evaporated immediately as he set foot inside his cubicle. The realization that he had been cursed here the previous evening hadn’t truly sunk in until this very moment; evidently, Harry had, as usual, been a sufficient distraction. Draco shuffled unsteadily backward, his body trembling as he stared into the tiny workspace. All he could see were hateful eyes, a raised wand, a flash of red light…
“You keep a journal?” he asked, latching onto the part that surprised him the most. “Is that what you were writing in the other night? At the cafe?”
Once again Harry’s eyes turned sad, and once again Draco felt furious with himself. He knew he’d made a wise choice telling Harry that they needed to establish some boundaries; it was no secret to him that they were becoming far too fond of each other. But establishing boundaries suddenly seemed unconscionable if it meant extinguishing any of Harry’s optimism. And no matter what qualms Draco may have about their connection, he needed to rectify that error immediately.
He reached a hand out from underneath his blanket and mindlessly traced the black lettering on Harry’s shirt, just staring at his striking face, watching the way the sunrise painted the features into something new.
“I feel the same way,” Draco finally said. “And I wasn’t ready to like you either, but I do. I do like you. Very much.”
“Have you given any more thought as to whether or not you want to discuss your sexual orientation in this article?” Draco asked him after a moment, suddenly eager to change the subject. “No pressure, of course; this just seemed like an appropriate time to ask.”
Harry nodded and smiled, lifting one arm above his head, and Draco once again let himself appreciate every one of those muscles for a moment. No one had ever carried off a white t-shirt as well as Harry Potter. No one in history.
“Maybe for now,” Draco said. “Perhaps someday when I’m old and crotchety every word out of my mouth will be rude, mean or downright vile.”
“Yes, as a matter of fact, I do,” Draco answered. He pulled his other hand out from under his face and laced it up in Harry’s, the one that was still resting on the pillow between them. “And you have nothing to be embarrassed about. People don’t stay over at mine either.”
Draco shoved him playfully out the back door of his little cottage and closed the door behind him. They grabbed each other’s hands again immediately and strolled the few steps into his cheerful little garden, towards the rose bush.
Draco was only partially surprised that he’d spoken the crude thought from his mind; being honest with Harry was almost second nature to him by now.
Harry really couldn’t say for sure what emotions was feeling (he wasn't nearly sober enough for that), but regardless, the news had hit him like a bludger to the stomach. It wasn’t shocking that they were expecting, and Harry knew that; they’d been trying for a while, and of course he was thrilled for them. He honestly couldn’t fathom why it was hitting him so strongly. Was it that they hadn’t told him? That they’d thought he couldn’t handle it? That their friendship would be shifting yet again?
Now that Draco thought about it, Harry hadn’t really given any indication that he would take off running the morning after, or anything close to that. Draco had just assumed the worst, because… well, because…
“Okay!” Harry stared at him with wide eyes and ran his hands through his hair again. “God, okay, I’m sorry, alright?”
Draco felt his own face growing warm again. He admitted to himself that he quite liked saying Harry’s name, as well. It dripped off his tongue like honey. It was delicious.
But the way he felt… it was nothing short of perfection. He felt his hand drift down as if of its own mind, instinctually gripping Harry’s cock in his hand. Harry was slippery with precum and as hard as a rock, and Draco’s other roaming hand quickly discovered that Harry had kicked off his jeans and was now completely naked as well. Draco’s eyes flew open; he needed to see.
“It means you’re the most famous wizard in the world!” Draco said, exasperated. “Every witch and wizard in the country wants to sleep with you; you could have literally anyone you want. Why on earth would you ever stick around once you’ve bedded the Death Eater?”
“I do,” he sighed. “It’s all I’ve ever wanted, really. Well, that, and to leap onto the back of some handsome bloke’s broomstick and ride off into the sunset to make love until we can no longer keep our eyes open.”
“Think so,” Harry said, rubbing his stubbly face and sitting on the edge of the bed in front of Draco. “Just let me take a quick mental picture of you standing naked in front of me, and then I’ll be ready to go.”
Draco pulled his knees up a bit, so that they were touching Harry’s under the blankets. Harry’s foot was still tucked in between Draco’s legs, and they were breathing in each other’s air. He felt Draco trace a finger over his eyelids, so gently that it was like his hands were singing Harry a lullaby.
“Potter, I can barely hold myself up right now, let alone you,” Draco said, his voice coming out soft and warm.
“What’s wrong is I’ve completely wasted your evening,” Draco muttered, staring at their hands. All he could think about was how horrible he must look. How horrible he must look, next to Harry Potter. “I’m very sorry.”
“I’m surprised you don’t take sugar,” Draco said, deciding that small talk may, in fact, be the best way to go now. “Weren’t you always quite the animal come dessert time back at school?”
“Don’t feel like you have to head out, it’s still quite early yet,” Hermione countered, though he could tell she would be crawling into bed the second they left the house.
On top of all that, not only had he consumed more alcohol last night than he had in years (and it showed), but he had also gone to sleep without adhering to his evening skin care regimen. He thought he looked rather grey this morning. One of the unfortunate consequences of having skin this pale: it was far less forgiving than someone with, for example, Harry’s rich golden brown skin tone. Potter hadn’t looked any worse for wear this morning. Potter had looked absolutely perfect.
Draco supposed that was the truth. Harry had been a big part of his world for half his life. The idea felt warm in his head.
Harry glanced up from his journal and cringed when he saw that Malfoy was holding out Harry’s wand in his pale hand. Harry usually wasn’t remiss enough to drop it, but it was the middle of the night, after all. He had every right to be a little careless. He was just glad (and a bit surprised) that Malfoy hadn’t recognized his fairly distinctive wand.
“Other way around.” Draco shrugged as if it was obvious. “You’ve been harassed and attacked all your life, have you not? Perhaps fate named you aptly.”
Draco grinned to himself and watched Harry with affection, watched the muscles in his arm, watched the easy confidence he exuded in his relaxed pose.
When Harry flopped down on top of his chest, he whispered, “I’m going to be in love with you forever.”
Draco tapped his chin thoughtfully, weighing his options. He remembered thinking to himself yesterday how very often his fear dictated his actions and wondered if fear was at play here as well. He supposed he could take a shower, towel off and just saunter back into his bedroom stark naked; after all, it was
The sky had cleared considerably over the course of the afternoon, and it felt odd seeing the imposing stone mansion in the golden light of the early evening; somehow the house looked out of place in anything but darkness. Draco counted to five as he approached the gate, which opened for him immediately. He clenched one fist tightly around his wand and the other around the bouquet of roses.
Harry lifted his eyebrows in surprise and smiled down at him, taking the cup. “Hey, reckon that puts me at five now. Thanks, banshee.”
“There, I smell fresh as a daisy now,” Harry said. Draco turned from the counter to look at him and stopped dead.
“Yeah, you’re lucky I can take it.” Harry squeezed his shoulder and kissed his forehead affectionately.
For some reason Harry punched him in the arm in response to this remark. Draco decided it was better if he didn’t ask questions; it was probably just a Gryffindor thing.
“Sit down,” Harry commanded, and Draco willingly let himself be led to his usual seat at the kitchen table. Harry knelt down on the floor in front of him.
Again Harry pulled his hand away, feeling vulnerable and embarrassed now… and maybe a tad insulted. How the hell was he supposed to keep up with Draco’s ever-moving boundaries?
“Yes, obviously that does happen to you sometimes,” Draco said, and regretting it immediately. “My apologies, I shouldn’t have brought it up again.”
“That doesn’t matter and you know it,” he muttered, shoving his hands inside the pockets of his jeans. “That was an extremely personal thing to tell someone, and you should’ve known it was me you were telling it to. I’m sorry. Truly.”
“You have far more energy than I do, Potter,” Draco said. “You’re basically three years old yourself.”
“I suppose it was you, more than the wand,” Draco said hesitantly, crossing his legs demurely. “Though I will never admit to that in civilized society."
“Are you sure the Auror department has no ulterior motives for questioning me?” Draco asked, a little suspicious. “After all, there were no actual witnesses to the assault itself, no one to vouch for the fact that it wasn’t provoked, or even deserved. For all they know, I could’ve fired a curse they didn’t see, before they heard me yelling. Or before we were even in the office...”
Draco moaned into Harry’s neck and then pulled away just enough to kiss him again. Draco drowned in the kiss, lost himself in the intoxicating taste of Harry. Their tongues hungrily thrashed against one another, their hips finding a rhythm as they rocked together, and Draco was hardly even conscious of the embarrassing sounds he knew he was making. He could feel a spot of precum blooming on the outside of his trousers.
Harry let out a bewildered puff of air and turned, aghast, towards the kitchen. Before he could take another step, Draco impetuously picked up a pillow from the couch and threw it at Harry’s back.
Draco wanted to pull out several pieces of parchment and compose a bloody opus about how much he’d missed Harry, how he couldn’t wait to see him again, how horrific his penmanship was, how he’d heard one of Harry’s beloved train whistles on his way to work that morning, how glad he was that he had made it home safely. Never mind sending a letter; he wanted to apparate over to Harry’s house immediately and give him a ten-minute hug. Oh god, who was he anymore?
Draco was pouring himself his second cup of morning tea as the tawny owl landed gracefully on the open windowsill of his tiny cottage.
“No?” Draco pressed ahead rather than wait for an answer. “Well, if it makes you feel any better, you always rile me up as well.”
“I did,” Harry nodded, hoisting himself up onto the counter across from Draco. He anxiously began to nibble on his thumbnail. “I mean, I told them a reporter was coming, and they were fine with it.”
“Oh, he’s sacked, alright,” she snorted. “If he ever happens to turn up again, that is. I’ve been in contact with the Auror department about this, and they tell me he’s still at large.”
With a shake of his head and one sharp intake of breath, he squared his shoulders and darted headlong into his cubicle, shrugged hastily out of his jacket, and gathered up his supplies for the meeting, leaving the space as quickly as he could.
Draco pulled the whole portfolio protectively onto his lap and leaned forward, resting his forearms on the table. “‘Mr Potter has an issue with boundaries, but on the other hand, he also makes a mean cup of peppermint tea.’”
He handed Harry the cup of tea and took his other hand as they strolled up the pathway towards the cottage.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t up-front with them, or with you, for that matter,” Harry said sincerely. “I know how much you hate surprises. And I suppose I didn’t tell them because I was scared they would object to it, and then you wouldn’t get your interview.”
Draco glared down at him, but his stomach fluttered pleasantly again. He ignored Harry and smiled at Rose. “What is your owl’s name, sweetheart?”
He must have pushed Draco’s blue plaid blanket off of his chest some time during the night, so Draco could see that he was still wearing the same tatty green t-shirt from the night before. It was riding up his stomach a few inches, and Draco felt a flutter in his chest as he glanced at the exposed trail of dark hair leading from Harry’s belly button down into the top of his jeans. His left arm had been flung up over his head, the other draped languidly over his ribs, a slight grin playing on his lips. His hair lay wild and free on the thick white pillow that they were sharing. His face was peaceful in sleep, and Draco could hardly let himself believe that Harry was really here beside him. Draco couldn’t stop smiling.
Gingerly, Harry lifted his shaking pinky finger and traced it, feather-light, over Draco’s, letting it aimlessly wander, until Draco finally reciprocated by curling his finger around Harry’s. They both let their pinkies do a slow-motion wrestle for a moment. It was odd and innocent and so unexpected, but Harry couldn’t say that he’d ever felt so aroused before.
Among Draco’s favorite discoveries: Harry always stopped what he was doing when a thunderstorm rolled in, so that he could observe it through his open window (he was curious). He had dreamed of becoming a firefighter as a child, before his Hogwarts days (he was heroic, even back then, and consequently very patient while he explained to Draco exactly what a ‘firefighter’ was). Cockroach Clusters freaked him out (he was reasonable; those fuckers were disgusting). He’d once accidentally let a snake out of its enclosure at the zoo because his insufferable cousin had pissed him off (he was feisty, and hilarious when he was telling stories). He spent every second Tuesday with his godson Teddy (he was responsible). He supported the horrendous Chudley Cannons, of all things, because Weasley did (he was loyal). He liked being around happy couples (he was romantic). And the whistle of a distant train was probably his favorite sound in the world (he was... well, surprising).
Harry winked at him. “Andrea and I are leaving in a bit for patrol duty, but I wanted to come say hello to you first.”
Harry stood up suddenly and started walking towards the house. Draco watched him take a few steps, and then Harry held his hand out and called out over his shoulder, “Stop staring at my arse and come inside, I started a fire.”
“I… Well, I made it sound as if the Healers told me all of that… which is technically true.” He was staring at Harry’s neck. “But the whole truth is that… I already knew. I know all about the cephalia curse. I’m very familiar with it.”
“Yeah, mate,” Harry agreed, settling himself casually on the arm of Draco’s chair, despite there being a free one right beside him. “You did good.”
Harry immediately turned back around and held his hands up. “I know. Draco, honestly, I don’t know what came over me…”
“Anyways,” Hermione murmured hastily, placing her hand on Ron’s stomach. “I need to get this one into bed.”
Draco huffed, and then he laughed, and when Harry smiled back at him, he didn’t think he’d ever felt quite so fond of anyone before.
“Well, I’m not gay,” Harry heard himself say, and he instantly wanted to kick himself for his lack of tact.
“Yes,” Draco nodded, and Harry’s blood was boiling. “It was always more of a hypothetical threat, really: you’ll get what’s coming to you, watch your back, that sort of thing. It used to make me nervous, but since all his threats eventually proved empty, I presumed he would slowly lose interest in harassing me.”
It felt odd waking up alone on a Sunday morning, particularly when he needed Harry’s overheated body so badly, and he thought the weather was rather fitting, given his dismal mood.
“Well, if it makes you feel any better, he was also a bit of an idiot. Great arse, though,” Harry said, unable to keep a laugh out of the end of the sentence.
Draco was secretly very pleased to hear that, and he burned with curiosity about what Harry might’ve said. He took a sip of tea to cover his smile and his blush.
But he ignored Draco (he was proud of himself for being able to do so) and meandered a little unsteadily down the hallway towards Rose’s bedroom.
Draco continued to try to slow his breathing, and when it didn’t work, he stood up and paced the tiny room, shaking his hands to and fro in an attempt to dispel some of his anxious energy.
Draco tried hard not to feel nervous as he took a deep breath. He wouldn’t be sacked… he couldn’t. He didn’t know how he would ever survive yet another failure. How many bloody times could a person be kicked while he was down?
Now don’t send another letter because, 1. Our rule of three, 2. I’ll probably start worrying that it’s bad news, too, and 3. I need to be a responsible adult and take care of my godson. Your letters have always been very distracting.
All Draco could do was stare. That was easily and without contest the kindest thing anyone had ever said to him.
Draco felt himself melt, staring at Harry’s body, Harry’s hair, Harry’s small, contented smile. He was right, and Draco knew it. They
“There.” Harry couldn’t help his grin. “Impertinent, rude, and now a liar. What other insults have you got for me in that dictionary brain of yours?”
“You told me it only scarred a little,” Harry said. Draco was relieved to hear some emotion in it, even if it was anger. He had seen Harry angry plenty of times before; it didn’t scare him. When they were children, he had always either been the reason for that anger, or had gleefully poked it until it got worse. Now all he wanted to do was ease it, make everything better. Harry should only feel good things, forever and always.
Bugger, that was another wrong thing to say, and he’d cocked it up again. He could feel his face burning, and he looked at Harry. But Harry’s face shone bright with something that Draco was afraid to name.
With that extremely discomfiting pep talk, and a few deep breaths, Draco reentered the sitting room.
“Ridiculous and inelegant,” Draco amended, letting their fingers remain laced together for a blissful second or two.
Draco was more than happy to obey. He and Harry kissed for a moment, this time blissfully sweet and unhurried. When Draco pulled away, he looked down at Harry, but Harry kept his eyes closed, a smile still on his lips. Draco’s gaze was frozen on that face, so overcome by his feelings that he almost couldn’t breathe.
He rolled his eyes at his own ridiculousness as he desperately tried to push it all out of his head, but it was a challenge. No one had ever been able to obliterate his self-control like Harry bloody Potter.
“You haven’t fucking asked me anything yet, Potter,” Draco whispered, stunned tears pooling in his eyes.
“I was not obsessed!” he insisted, his face flaming. “And nothing’s happened anyway. And nor will it!”
Harry giggled and took a swig of his drink; truth be told, he was feeling rather tipsy himself. Really, Ron was hopelessly funny sometimes.
Draco looked up to see that Harry was once again standing and pulling his wand from the back pocket of his jeans.
Harry’s moan was almost pleading, but he obliged, slowly stretching Draco’s hole with a second finger. Draco well and truly screamed, biting down on his lip as he rocked his hips up and down, back and forth, fucking himself on Harry’s fingers. Draco was just conscious enough to look down and see that Harry was stroking his own cock as he fucked Draco’s arse with his hand. Draco wanted to come, wanted Harry to come. He couldn’t last like this, but he needed to…
“Because it’s about you,” he mumbled. “And because the last thing I wrote was a very detailed, half-page description of wand core materials.”
“I’ve summarized everything for you, yes,” Draco stated, trying (but not very hard) to keep the pride out of his voice.
Draco stopped for a moment and closed his eyes and forced himself to take a few deep breaths. He needed to regain a little self-control, a little equilibrium. He counted to five.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, the things you find attractive… And now do you see what I mean? We can’t even have a conversation without it turning sexual.”
“Well, for future reference,” Draco muttered, “straight boys should certainly not talk about the ‘signs’ of being gay, particularly when they’re so very stereotypical. It’s very offensive, Potter, even though I know you didn’t mean it that way.”
“Merlin, Potter, no need to state the obvious once you’ve implied it several times,” Draco spat, before he could think better of it.
“Just because I always use a glamor charm in public doesn’t mean I don’t go out,” Harry grumbled petulantly. “Only that no one
Draco pulled two bottles of muggle beer from his fridge and mentally shook off his nerves, telling himself that this was just Potter, a boy he had known nearly half his life. If Potter didn’t like him as he was, stormed out of the house and never spoke to him again, what did it matter? He had seen the idiot twice in four years, for pity’s sake. He could certainly survive if they never saw each other again after tonight. He may be dreaming of green eyes and stubble for a little while, but that was hardly a terrible price to pay.
“Maybe I’ll get an ice cream instead of a hot chocolate,” Harry said distractedly, twisting in his chair to glance at the flavor board. “Have you had their strawberry and peanut butter? It’s my favorite.”
Harry graced him with one of those adorable--yes, Draco allowed himself to use the word in his head because it was undeniably true--half smiles. Draco felt himself smiling back.
Potter burst out laughing, and Draco smiled broadly without telling himself to. He hated how much he liked making Potter laugh.
“He’s right,” Draco confirmed, still gawking at Harry as he said it. He couldn’t quite drag his eyes away, now that they’d settled on such a gratifying view.
Harry stopped in front of the couch and flopped down, yanking off his glasses and flinging them onto the coffee table. He pulled Draco on top of him and in for another kiss. Draco adjusted his weight so that he was kneeling, straddling Harry’s hips, and then he leaned back slightly so he was sitting comfortably against the tops of Harry’s thighs. They laced their hands together, letting them hover somewhere around Harry’s ears.
Harry chuckled and kissed Draco’s shoulder three times before he answered, “And you smell like someone who recently fell from heaven.”
Harry sighed and stared into space. His mind was wandering off into sadness again, but feeling sad was more bearable when Draco was sitting across from him.
The thought struck him forcefully just then: Merlin, Harry Potter was in his bed. He felt himself giggle and thanked his lucky stars that Harry was not awake to hear it.
“I thought maybe I scared you away,” Harry admitted, unfiltered again. “When you were gone for so long.”
Potter shrugged, shifting slightly under Draco’s undisguised scrutiny. “We’re in a bubble now, just you and I. No one can see us, if you want to take yours off too.”
“I see,” Draco said, grinning in spite of himself. Only Harry could be friends with his ex’s husband. “And after Ms Halstadt?”
“You’re looking remarkably well, dear,” she said, studying him carefully. “Your skin is positively glowing.”
Draco chuckled. He knew it made no difference whatsoever, but the fact that Harry also wanted a family comforted him immensely. “Relentless, aren’t you?”
Harry groaned again, letting Rose hammer his palm with the toy wand. “I like spending time with him, and we’re getting along, but there’s absolutely nothing on his end, and that’s completely fine.”
“Do I?” Harry asked quietly. Draco could hear the smile in his voice even though he couldn’t see it.
“It’s very telling that you can’t speak highly of yourself, Potter,” Draco said. “But yes, I’ll allow the topic change.”
Draco sat down at the kitchen table and leaned back in his chair, allowing himself the luxury of enjoying the perfect view with his morning tea. Harry was facing away from him, and the back of him was just about as pleasing as the front.
“Better catch up then,” Draco said, boldly chugging the remaining half of his beer. To neither one’s surprise, Harry accepted his challenge and chugged right along with him.
Draco just stared, astonished. He had not been expecting that, either, but it seemed to make a little more sense as he rolled it around in his shocked mind. He felt himself nodding almost unconsciously, just looking into Potter’s slightly wary green eyes.
“Remember, the Aurors expect you at noon,” she said, shrugging into her jacket. Draco resisted his deeply ingrained manners and didn’t assist her (she’d barked at him about archaic, sexist customs the first time he’d done so, and he’d wisely never tried again). “We can meet again tomorrow to debrief about the questioning, but only if you deem it necessary. Alright?”
Draco broke away first, and when he opened his eyes, Harry’s stayed closed. Draco loved it when he did that.
Harry growled playfully and flipped him onto his back before Draco knew what was happening. Harry dove at him and held him down, kissing his face like a lunatic until they were both laughing uncontrollably.
"So?” Harry whispered nervously, unable to sit in his fear this time. “Anti-climactic or life-changing?”
Harry certainly hadn’t expected him to relent so readily. He moved his foot under the covers and wedged it in between both of Draco’s. “You sound extra sexy when you tell me I’m right.”
Harry bent down and knelt between Draco’s legs, keeping his hands on either side of Draco. “So what did you two talk about?”
“And it went well with Granger,” Draco informed him a moment later, once he had taken a very necessary deep breath. “But the stories Weasley told me were likely the most engaging part of the interview.”
Ease of flirting aside, Harry had no words in response to that blatantly suggestive line, so he merely took a shaky sip of his coffee. He was certain Draco could hear his heart pounding from across the table.
Harry leaned in slowly, but Draco instinctively pulled his head away even as Harry was leaning towards him.
Draco pondered it for a moment, tapping his fingers on his ridiculous Gryffindor teacup, the one Potter had given him in an attempt to get a rise out of him. Sometimes Harry was still Potter, and Draco felt strangely glad to know that.
“Of course they are,” Harry admitted, shuddering when he imagined what Ron might be telling Hermione about his ‘minor fancy.’ “But I reckon it might be better for everyone if we let them have a quick recon before we start.”
“Yes,” Draco replied, tightening his grip on the tea cup. “I regained consciousness about two hours later, at St Mungo’s.”
On impulse, Draco went outside and carefully snipped a dozen roses from his rosebush for his mother; roses were her favorite, and they smelled especially aromatic after the day’s rainfall. He then grabbed his wand, pocketed Artemis’ treat, and took a fortifying deep breath before apparating to the front gate of his childhood home.
Almost numbly, Draco took the three steps to the kitchen table and mindlessly fiddled with the clean grey place mat in front of him as Harry worked his way around the tiny kitchen like he owned the place. Draco couldn’t stop watching him as he cast spells in that slightly blundering but confident way that he always had.
them to. He wanted to pay recompense for every single injustice he’d ever committed, and he wanted them to accept him as wholeheartedly as Harry had. Perhaps it wasn’t impossible. (And perhaps Draco was a little naive, after all.)
He knew Harry was getting close by the tone of his moans, the speed at which he fucked his cock into Draco’s mouth, the shortness of his breathing.
alright?” Harry asked, stroking a single finger over the back of Draco’s hand. “You’re not hurting at all? Tired? Is your head still okay?”
Harry’s answering gasp was sharp and positively sublime in his ear. He exhaled heavily into Draco’s neck, his fingers digging almost painfully into the skin of Draco’s lower back.
Harry stopped, turned around, and gave him his adorable ‘go on’ head tilt as he leaned against the doorframe.
“My apologies, but I would rather try this again tomorrow, if it’s alright with you,” he muttered, avoiding Harry’s eyes. He spelled his writing supplies swiftly into his slim briefcase as he stood up. “I’ll send you an owl later this evening to arrange a time.”
She smiled and lifted her hand in surrender. “Alright. It was merely a suggestion. Think it over in the morning?”
Every single inch of Draco reacted to that word, and he moaned aloud, stroking his erection madly as he closed his eyes. But he didn’t keep them closed for long; he didn’t like it when he couldn’t stare at Harry.
Draco wanted to nudge him back, more than he cared to admit, so he settled for rolling his eyes instead.
“Well I’m sorry to hear that, then,” Draco said, unsure what else to say. He couldn’t imagine growing up feeling uneasy around both of his guardians. Despite his rocky relationship with his father, Draco had at least always had his mother to lean on and confide in.
After Harry had placed his order, and the barkeep had turned to retrieve the drinks, Draco watched, alarmed, as Harry abruptly turned around and met his eyes across the bar. He’d been caught staring and oh bugger, Harry was grinning at him with that unusual face, his head tilting to the side again.
“Thank you for informing me,” Draco murmured, peering over his list of questions. “Oh, before we begin, is it alright with you if I use a self-writing quill? Not just this evening, but for the next few weeks, throughout this process?”
“Don’t forget, it’s Saturday,” Draco reminded him. “Very few reporters make a habit of coming in at the weekends, which is why it was a particularly unpleasant surprise seeing Alex here this morning. And believe me, if I’d known he was here, I wouldn’t’ve bothered coming in either; being forced to endure him during the week is punishment enough.”
“Ah, that’s right,” Draco said, giving him a searching look. “That ex-girlfriend of yours was yet another ginger Weasley.”
Draco simply laughed at Harry’s remark and picked up his espresso, throwing back the remaining contents in one. “You are a challenge, I’ll give you that.”
“I…” Draco peered at him carefully. He trusted Harry, but he was not sure how much he wanted to divulge. “I recently moved back in with Astoria.”
Harry’s eyes glazed over, his body rigid, as Hermione levitated Rose’s empty cup in a creative way so that Rose was utterly entranced. Both she and Ron were suddenly completely focused on their little girl, and the three of them were prattling on. All of it bled into the background, because Draco was now pressing his thigh up against Harry’s, even closer than it already was. Harry pushed back against it without consciously telling himself to do so.
Draco had certainly never been ashamed of his looks, but after seeing how utterly striking Harry had become in the last few years, he felt a little self-conscious of what he’d always considered his rather feminine appearance.
Draco smiled. “Guilty again, I’m afraid. I’m a reporter there. Well, an auxiliary reporter, as you see.”
“This is great, Draco,” Harry muttered through a full mouth a few minutes later, once his plate had nearly been cleared.
Draco was mortified when his voice broke on the last word and he placed his hand over his eyes in a fruitless attempt to stop the tears from coming again.
“Anyway, it’s like I said, we both knew it wasn’t working. She wanted to see what else was out there, see the world, find her independence. All the usual reasons people break up at our age, I imagine. And I was happy to let her go. Truly, it was for the best.
“I suppose I never expected Harry Potter to take advantage of anyone, even me,” he muttered, feeling a hurt that he hadn’t allowed himself to feel yet. “It was my mistake, nothing more.”
“Yes, I can tell,” Draco said, gesturing with an amused smirk at Harry’s extremely relaxed position on his couch.
“They want to interview me,” Harry explained with an involuntary cringe. “Something really long and in-depth, apparently, sort of like some kind of character piece, for the tenth anniversary of… well, you know.”
“You aren’t allowed to ask any follow-up questions, make any snide remarks, or even comment in any way.”
Draco’s heart stuttered violently at the word, but he ignored it to the best of his ability. He stood up from the chair and bent over, wrapping his hands sturdily around Harry’s forearms (Merlin fuck but he was muscular) and helping him carefully to his feet.
Draco giggled. It made his inner Slytherin sick to his stomach how bloody happy he was. But as he tucked the letter carefully into the small floral box on the top corner of his bookshelf, the same box that housed every single one of Harry’s letters, he knew he was the luckiest man in the world.
“Okay, okay,” Harry held his arms up over his head in a gesture of surrender, which lost its effect, given the angle he was lying at. “You’re the one who brought it up.”
“What do you think happened?” Draco asked, pushing Harry’s hair back from his face. “He shoved his belongings off his desk in a fit of uncontrollable lust and we made raucous love to each other all afternoon?”
“Oh nothing at all,” Draco muttered, unable to resist bringing up the hippogriff in the room. “Fondled anyone’s hand under any tables lately?”
“I wasn’t in the mood for butterbeer, that’s all,” Hermione told him quietly, still blushing. “And don’t forget tomorrow is only Thursday; some of us have to be responsible adults.”
There was something about flying alongside him that made Harry feel younger than he’d felt in a long time. Perhaps Draco was starting to bring out the best in him, after years of bringing out his worst. Was that ironic too?
“I’m just me,” Harry said quietly, feeling shy again. “My story is the same as anyone else’s in a lot of ways. I’m just some bloke with really rotten luck.”
“Well, yeah!” Potter scoffed. “You were so arrogant, even then. I would have been terrified that everyone in the wizarding world was like that, if I hadn’t met Hagrid first. Hagrid, who you so rudely called a savage, by the way.”
“You’re a prick,” Harry finally mumbled, deflating and folding his arms across his chest like a child.
Draco busied himself once more by lifting the teapot and filling Harry’s empty cup. “Meaning, we’ve covered some fairly intense topics this evening, Potter. Discussing the weather is the next logical step, I imagine.”
When Harry finally opened his eyes completely, Draco thought he might have to kiss him. No one’s eyes should be that green… no one should be this handsome. It simply wasn’t fair.
“No, Draco, I’m just...” Harry began, but Draco pushed at his chest childishly. He wanted to be away from Harry. He wanted to walk out of the room and not have to sit in this hurt.
It took Draco several seconds to draw breath, and when he did, a broad smile took over his face. Harry Potter’s hand was on his arse. Life never stopped being funny.
“It’s still a lot of things,” Draco began, so softly it was almost a whisper. “Like… How your hair can’t change, even with a glamor. And how you dress like an adolescent, so casual... but not only do you somehow make it look incredibly sexy, it also makes me feel so secure around you, like you’re not judging me. Your eyes… well, it’s a given, obviously, how beautiful they are. But they make me feel… damn, they make me feel things.”
“There were one or two others between then and now, but nothing close to significant,” Harry said, wrinkling his nose. “Damn.”
It was true. Draco always wanted Harry; it was impossible not to want him. He was so attracted to Harry that he had difficulty focusing on anything else sometimes.
Harry’s hands came up to rest on Draco’s waist, and Draco instinctively wrapped his around Harry’s shoulders. Their foreheads touched automatically, and Draco felt a sense of peace seeping into him for the first time all day.
Potter chuckled suddenly from beside him as they walked further down the quiet street. “You know, now that I know you’re gay, I really don’t know how I missed it.”
But before he could even reach for his own wand, he felt the sharp shock of a curse hitting him in the forehead. He crumpled to the ground in a heap before everything faded away to nothing.
Potter was running late, of course. Draco supposed that years of positive reinforcement at school had taught Harry that the world would bend to his personal schedule, a fact that had bothered Draco endlessly back then. But, when Potter finally entered the parlor with the hood of his thin red jumper pulled over his head, his face to the ground, and his arms tensed as if bracing for an ambush, Draco tried his hardest to let it go. No glamor charm today, he observed. But he looked incredibly uneasy, walking in an unusually stiff way that Draco wasn’t used to seeing from the ever-laid-back Potter.
Draco kept his eyes closed as the sunlight slowly crept through the sheer white curtains in his bedroom. He had always loved the spring and summer months, when the morning would arrive early and then take its time greeting him through the east-facing window of his cottage. Somehow the days always felt easier to tackle knowing he had woken up along with the sun instead of being rudely roused by his alarm.
Harry shook his head and gestured for Draco to follow him to the interview room where Draco’s actual questioners were already set up. “I did volunteer for your case, but Robards said no. He knows you’re the one writing about me for the anniversary thing, so he wouldn’t let me. Conflict of interest, or something; I’m sure you, of all people, can understand that.”
Oh hell, had Harry really said that? He was absolutely shocked at how easy it was to flirt with Malfoy. Shocked that he was having so much fun. Shocked that Malfoy looked to be having just as much fun as Harry.
“You wouldn’t lie about me in my obituary,” Harry said, looking scandalized. “That’s far too awful, even for a Slytherin.”
Harry was silent, evidently engrossed. Draco sighed and took a long sip of his tea (out of a ‘Boss Witch’ mug; Harry was a cheeky little fucker at times) before he pressed on. Draco wasn’t sure why he was telling Harry all of this, but for some reason, he desperately wanted to.
Ron predictably let the comment roll off of him, and he aimed a cheerful punch at Draco’s arm. “And you’re still
After a short pause, he sighed. “Weasley, please don’t overreact, but it’s Draco. Malfoy. I’ve implemented a glamor charm, as you can see.”
Bloody hell, his hand was still tingling. Being that close to Harry was far too intoxicating to be wise. So much for Draco’s resolution not to touch him (or smile at him, or flirt with him…). But oh, Merlin, he smelled divine, spicy and clean and incredibly masculine; three of Draco’s favorite things, blended together into one unmistakably mouthwatering aroma.
Never mind the way he’d acted with Draco, Harry also had Hermione’s pregnancy to deal with. Now that he was thinking more clearly, he knew that his strong reaction to the news was borne from jealousy more than anything else, and it made him feel ashamed. Obviously he was beyond excited for them, but fucking hell, he wanted to be a father more than anything.
Draco threw himself at Harry before he could say anything or even think, and their lips met. Harry let out a small noise of shock before he was responding to Draco enthusiastically, wrapping his arms firmly around Draco’s middle as Draco’s hands crept up into Harry’s curls, of their own volition.
Draco placed a hand briefly on Potter’s shoulder to stop him, but when Harry looked over at him he quickly pulled it back again.
It was a brief reprieve, however, and once another two hours had passed, Harry had worked himself back up into a proper tizzy, feeling both angry and hurt in equal measure. He paced the sitting room in frustration, his thoughts racing, until he could no longer stand it. He summoned his journal from his bedroom upstairs and angrily flipped it open, dropping cross-legged onto the floor directly in front of the fireplace.
Draco allowed himself the luxury of lying there and staring at the man for a few blissful minutes. He had somehow forgotten in the night just how incredibly beautiful Harry was.
“Perhaps…,” he began, his voice shaking nervously. “Perhaps I can try to tell you what draws you to me now. If you promise not to laugh at me too hard.”
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco said firmly, trying to calm him with his voice. “People are knobs sometimes. At any rate, I seldom go out in the magical world at all, much less without a glamor.”
“Okay. Sorry if I overstepped. Only it’s been a while since you two told me you were going to start trying for another baby,” Harry explained. “And I can’t wait for Rose to have a sibling.”
Draco immediately scanned his anxious brain for a reason why he, a lowly auxiliary, might be summoned to the office of the bloody editor-in-chief. He couldn’t be getting the sack, could he? Certainly he had been exhausted for months, and maybe he wasn’t firing on all cylinders these days, but he didn’t think it had caused his work to suffer. In fact, the piece he had contributed last week about wand core materials, though dull as tombs, had earned him an effusive letter of praise from one Hezekiah Beatnick, a collector of antique wands from Leicester. Perhaps he could bring the letter with him as evidence for why he shouldn’t be sacked; it was currently tucked proudly into the top drawer of his desk.
The chill and quiet of the night helped to still his mind some, and he knew he had to face the truth that he could see so clearly now. Potter was right: things had changed immeasurably for them in just a few wonderful, beautiful, surprising hours. Draco knew, without any doubt, that this would never just be a one-night thing. It would never be a one-week thing, either, or even a one-year thing. There was too much between them now, and perhaps there always had been. It was always going to be an earth-shattering, painful, glorious tornado with Potter. It could never be anything less. And Draco didn’t think he wanted it any other way.
“How on earth would I even bring this up with a straight face?” Ron asked him, still shaking with mirth. “Oi, Malfoy, welcome, what have you been doing these last ten years? You know, besides a year of house arrest, and knocking boots with my best mate?”
Draco couldn’t help but laugh. “Your mystery? You have a lot of attributes, Potter, but mystery is certainly not one of them. Nor, apparently, is humility.”
Harry snorted. “Yeah, you’re probably right. But I reckon I’m okay with that, to be honest. Fighting with you is still really fun. Even though you grossly underestimate werewolves.”
“You were dead,” Harry said a minute later, and Draco could hear that he was crying. “He killed you. It wasn’t just Avada Kedavra, it was gruesome. I watched it all. He made me watch.”
“Thanks for saying all that.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck again, staring at his knees. “Earlier.”
“I want you to force me to watch as you wank. And you would come all over yourself and command me to lick it up,” Draco said, hardly aware of what he was saying, but knowing that he meant it as sincerely as he had ever meant anything. “I would get on my hands and knees and crawl over to you. I’d lick up every drop of it, Harry, and you would just watch, watch me licking up your spunk like a fucking animal.”
“He’ll buy me whatever I want, of course,” Draco continued. “Shower me with endless compliments. And when he asks me about that silly hairy-chested boy I fell for when I was young and foolish, we’ll both laugh and laugh. And then shag some more.”
Harry lifted his middle finger up to Draco’s mouth and pushed it inside. Draco moaned as he sucked the drop of liquid from Harry’s finger. Harry’s eyes were hungry, lewd, wicked.
Draco counted to five. Then he counted to five again. Thinking of Harry’s silly rule of three, he did it one last time. Finally, he began to feel slightly soothed, though he suspected it had less to do with counting and more to do with the fact that he’d thought of Harry.
Harry’s answering look was beatific. Draco wasn’t sure how he resisted kissing him, but he managed it, simply because they had agreed.
“It’s fine,” Draco said. “I get those kinds of comments fairly often, if I venture into the wizarding world undisguised. Maybe they’re not always of a sexual nature, but still.”
“I usually understand you quite well, as a matter of fact,” Draco replied quietly, before sipping his tea.
“Fuck off, Potter,” Draco mumbled, but with very little heat behind it. In a small way, Potter’s silly giggle was helping to distract him from the slowly ebbing nausea in his stomach. And perhaps exacerbating it, in a different way…
When he exited the shower, he felt wonderfully awake and oddly jolly. The grey pallor in his face had vanished, and he looked marginally better. Draco may have even gone so far as to say he looked pretty good. Perhaps glowing skin was a happy side effect of being in love.
But Harry just shrugged and glanced around the room. Draco took a sip of his beer and tried to ignore the growing fluttering in his gut. Yes, must be the drinks. He had always been a lightweight.
“I don’t know,” Hermione sighed. “All I know is those feelings definitely seem like enough for him to be dealing with at the moment. I think we should wait a little while longer to tell him about the baby.”
“Well… shall we continue with our interview then?” he asked, pulling his hands out of Harry’s and summoning his portfolio from the coffee table, where he’d left it several hours ago.
“On the contrary, I would encourage you to be literal, as total transparency is the whole point of this interview,” Draco reminded him. “Think you’re up for it?”
He had arrived home far later than he’d anticipated, armed with a thick stack of exhaustively answered questions, a clear mental outline of exactly how this feature would look, and a grossly inconvenient and fairly sizable crush on Harry sodding Potter.
The Weasleys hadn’t reacted poorly to the news that they were together, after all. The Weasleys hadn’t had a chance to hear the news at all. This was… this was somehow worse. Draco could feel his blood freezing into ice.
Harry looked up at him with tears in his eyes and Draco’s heart broke a little when Harry shook his head, crestfallen.
“You’re talking more than I am,” he teased with a shy grin, and Draco laughed with him. “But I fucking love it.”
He knew it was silly, but he truly couldn’t remember the last time he felt so happy. Everything simply looked brighter. He’d even slept better in the past two weeks than he had in years. He’d been right the other day: Draco Malfoy improved him.
