The three made their way to the Quidditch Pitch and Harry did some warm-up. He then did some push-ups and sit-ups before starting for his run. All through his warm-ups, both Seamus and Draco were silent, staring at him exercise. Only when he left them at the stands for his run did they relax in their seats.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Maybe we had been insensitive. I did notice that people had the tendency to pair up recently. Must be the water." Draco gave Day a soft kiss on her forehead.
"Me five." Neville answered.
Day thought to herself. She steered the surprised Draco to one of the seats and dropped herself to the seat beside him.
Note: There is an assault and rape scene at the end of the chapter, not involving the main 2 characters.
"I… no… just that I thought… Dean is straight." He frowned and quickly walked towards their room. "I'm going to unpack." He said as he went through the door.
Draco smiled at the black-haired man. "For fun. Harry constructed a similar wall at the infirmary a week ago. So I was thinking that if the texture could be converted to other types of texture, then it would be interesting. It would be good if we actually change the inner texture to such that it protects us but does not stop our own spells from going out. That way it would be effective against people attacking us."
At the stands, with the dog guarding his wand, he started warming up. However, he thought that since Sirius was there, and even though he couldn't communicate as a dog, then Harry could just talk and ramble.
Day's eyes went wide, as her smile broaden. She leant down till her head was on Draco's shoulder and asked softly, "Really? You two?" Harry and Draco both nodded, and Day had to use her hand to cover her mouth to prevent herself from giving in to the temptation of going 'awww….'
Day nodded. "I don't really remember that much… Parkinson cut me so many times that all I felt was the pain. Then I think she said that Crabbe won a bet and could be the first to… you know. And all I remembered before fainting from the pain was that he… started to…" Day could not really go on. One thing good about her fainting then was that she couldn't remember the process of the rape, and mentally could just push it aside for a while, as she had to deal with the memory of the pain first. She then patted the spaces beside her. "Want to sit down? You can't possible stand the entire time you are here."
"Harry, I need to tell you something."
"Protection" Professor Lupin replied.
Draco grinned, slinging his arm over Harry. "It is because I've got friends surrounding me for first time in my life. And that includes you, Neville." Everyone smiled at him.
"Quidditch Pitch? I'll sit in the stands while you run. Pass me your wand. I'll hold it for you." Seamus stretched out his hand and took the wand from Harry. He then took off his robe, showing him in a t-shirt and jeans. "It's too hot outside to wear a robe."
Draco frowned.
"Hey, Seamus. I need to tell you something. Come here, will you?" Dean finally said to Seamus. There was a collective breath of relief from the three boys that Dean finally decided to do SOMETHING. Seamus got up from Draco's bed, walked to his own bed and sat down. Dean also got on Seamus' bed and closed the curtains, casting a silencing spell.
Both Draco and Harry had their hands clenched. Both were trying to control their tempers upon hearing this. So it was true that it was their fault, isn't it?
"It's no use shouting. This place is soundproof. No one can hear you, even if that stupid dog patrols by outside later, it can't hear you. So you might as well save your breath, bitch." Pansy Parkinson sneered at her as she stood at her feet. Crabbe and Goyle grunted their laughter behind her.
Draco packed up his things slowly, as he handed his parchment to Harry to help him place it on Snape's desk. Looking around when he picked up his bag, he noticed that all the Slytherins had exited the class in a very fast manner as well. Harry was making his way back to him as Draco was holding on to his bag.
"Okay. Advanced Transfiguration for you two is under me for this year. Professor Dumbledore is just here so that people don't think that you are being taught by a dog. You two should be ready for Animagus transfiguration. I think it will help you when you need to escape from Voldemort. So, you guys okay with it?" Both Draco and Harry nodded. "Okay. First and foremost, because we are not informing the Ministry, not a word about this to anyone. Not Ron, not Hermione, not anyone in your dorm. The less people know, the better. And we are going to let you drink a potion that would allow you to see your animagus form for half a minute. Professor?" Sirius turned to face Dumbledore who was now holding two goblets. Sirius passed them to the boys, who looked into the goblet they were each holding, into a potion which is transparent. They stood facing each other, looked at each other, clinked their goblets and drank it together. Sirius was grinning, being excited about seeing the forms, while Dumbledore merely looked curious.
"Because those idiots are not gay."
"Draco, what's happening?" Harry whispered.
“It was just too much. The N.E.W.T.s and the classes and all the people. I thought I had it under control, but then I spilt my fucking quill and the tears came rushing in and you walked in and it was too late to stop them.” He took a deep breath to calm himself.
The shadow was still present in his dreams but somehow he found himself growing fond of the creature that hunted him. His mindscape also looked a lot better, when he learned how to change the black night to a beautiful sunset the whole place became a welcoming image. Sometimes he wanted Harry to see the place, but the idea of having someone in his head was still making his skin itch, too many bad memories.
Draco sat rotten in his spot still holding Harry’s hand, he forgot about the dorm arrangement. He will have to room with someone who probably hates him and will make him feel as if he was still with his parents. He looked up and locked his eyes with Headmistress McGonagall and he could swear that she smiled at him, quickly Draco averted his eyes and looked at the table.
Back in the castle, he could feel the change in the atmosphere even more. They sat in their usual seats when Draco noticed that Harry was fidgeting and playing with his hands. Still, Draco waited, he begun to read the essay that Harry gave him and discovered that it was not horrible, but it also wasn’t good, passable at best. This made him a little proud because the first essay that Harry gave him was so bad that he needed to lay down after reading it. He started to make suggestions on parchment when he noticed that Harry stopped fidgeting and was looking at him.
Draco just looked at him with tears in his eyes. “ I never knew that you could be so sappy Harry. I – Thank you.” Harry smiled and thought that Draco deliberately left out the last sentence that escaped his bloody mouth that never knew when to shut up but the boy continued with a small smile on his face. “And I wanna live with you too. You make me happy, I thought that I always will be sad, but you make me smile and laugh. I can think when I’m with you.”
He looked at the blond and his shirt open and suddenly Harry’s whole world began to crumble. Thin white lines run down Draco’s chest, instantly Harry knew what they were the Sectumsempra incident in 6yh year. He moved his hand to touch the biggest scar that started at the collar bone and disappeared under the blond’s trousers.
The four of them slowly makes their way out of the castle wards where they apparate to muggle London. Draco hated the noise that the city makes. He didn’t care for the muggles, he never really did, but the noise made his head hurt. Another thing that bothered him about Muggle places was the smell of the cities. The air in the muggle cities always smells different, he got used to the clear air that he grown up with and now the slights change made him uneasy.
She didn’t know what to think, in a way she wanted to hate him for all the things he did, but he did apologise. She asked for a reason and he gave her one, she hated that she felt bad for the boy. In a way she also hated that she understood why he behaves like this, she understood why his brain made a connection between the pain inflicted on him and her.
“Hermione I don’t think – “ He didn’t get to finish.
The silence in the room didn’t help Harry’s wandering mind. This time he knew better, he won’t be the first to speak, he can tell that Andromeda also waits for Malfoy to speak.
Harry smiled at the blond. “Of course, I made dinner just in case.”
After Potter shut the door Draco made his way back to the sitting room. He just wanted to go to sleep and wake up after his face looked normal again. But he knew that sooner or later one of the people in this room will notice. His only wish was that it wasn’t Teddy.
“Harry, mate you’ve never in your entire life cared about your outfit. What’s going on?” Ron sounded curious and Harry knew that there’s no way out of this conversation.
Even though McGonagall was doing everything in her power to help them, the number of detentions was extreme, and Harry was beginning to worry that soon Draco will realise that the whole relationship was one big mistake. Before they became a couple everything was going well for the Slytherin then Harry happened and everything Draco worked for, gone to shit, even his work with Neville was forgotten because of their relationship. Harry knew that he was overthinking, but even the possibility of breaking up the still-new relationship scared him.
Please keep fighting and don't give up. Never give up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The tea laid abandoned on the table. Andromeda was still looking at the stairs as if Malfoy would walk down them any second.
Harry slowly shifted so that he was facing the blonde. With his free hand, he started to play with Draco’s hair, which caused the Slytherin to shift a little in his arms. “Draco it’s dinner.” The boy in his arms slowly opened his eyes and Harry’s heart stilled for a moment.
Draco could just look and nod his head as Harry spoke. He knew that the boy in front of him is caring, but he never could have guessed that he would be so understanding. Draco was a Death Eater, a scam and here was the saviour of the wizarding world telling him that he will wait for him to be comfortable.
Trans and non-binary people are valid and amazing. Ace/Aro people exist and I love every single one of y'all!
“Too late I’ve already promised.” Harry said smiling and all he annoyance was gone.
He smiled and looked at his chosen one. “Don’t worry you are enough.” Before Harry could answer he kissed him again.
This intrusted him. “How come?”
“Yeah, okay I will give you that.” He knew that she was disanointed that her potion still didn't work, but Draco wasn’t sure whether to encourage her more or thank Merlin.
The door clicked open, and he felt all his energy drain.
“Harry, mate, thanks, Merlin. I the four of them are pure chaos. I can’t imagine how bad they will be when they get to Hogwarts.” Harry just shook his head and smiled at his exhausted friend.
“I will have you know that I use them very frequently.”
He was glad that Hermione and Ron agreed to accompany them, he knew that for them it was less about helping Draco and more about spending time together and introducing Ron to muggle society, but he was happy that he will have someone with him that will not be afraid to smack him when he will be staring at Draco for too long.
One of the better things that came from Draco’s friendship with Neville was the fact that more and more students started to see him as their peer and not as a Death Eater scum. Sure Draco still had to deal with some justice-seeking students, but more and more people made the effort to see him as he is and not as he was made to behave.  A lot of students also saw the fact that Draco changed his last name as proof that he no longer believes the pureblood ideas.
“Okay, I did a lot of bad things and most of them I did because I wanted to protect my parents even though they don’t deserve it. I hate that even though they were horrible to me I still did everything I could for this shitty family that hated me now. I’m sorry that I used you and I wish I’ve never done it but I cannot change it no matter how much I want to.” Noticing that Draco began to scratch at his hand harry quickly took Draco’s hand in his once again.
“Thank you. You’re quite good too.” The Gryffindor lift his head and shoot Draco an annoyed look, which made him laugh.
Then they took him to Diagon Alley and everything changed. His parents made sure that he grew up pretty secluded, the only other people he saw at the Manor were his parents business partners. His father made a deal with Crabe and Goyle parents and so they were made to stick together. He never saw so many people and so many families. He saw children laughing and running around. This was the first time he realized his parents aren’t that great, but he still believed that they do it all for him.
“Mine not.” The words were barely audible and for a moment Harry thought that he was the only one that heard it.
I'm going to give you some details on the Sirius raised Draco fic. Basically, I started to write it, and I like it very much, but I'm gonna start posting it when the plot will get to around the 3rd year because of my work and uni. The chapters will be also longer around 5k per chapter, so I also need time to edit them, so I hope that you will be patient.
Harry smiled at Hermione’s words. “Yeah. Is it dinner time?”
Shopping time
For a moment everyone was silent, he tried not to look at Harry, but the raven-haired boy sought his eyes out and finally Draco obliged. As soon as it happened Harry started to shout. “Draco Black!” He almost flinched at the noise, but after noticing that Harry’s face didn’t hold any real hate, he slightly relaxed. When the boy was right in front of Draco he spoke again. “You win.”
“You have nothing to apologize for. It was my fault I’m sorry, I didn’t want to –“ Draco was interrupted before he could finish.
I hope y'all have a great day and that you punched some nazi. Be yourself and keep fighting. I love you and I stand with you. Don't give up and don't let the assholes win.
I once again post two chapters in a row because of work.
He stood up. “Right, sorry Hermione, Ron we couldn’t leave them at Andy’s cause she was with us. I’m sure that next year they won’t be as exhausting.” He smiled as his friend glared at him. He turned towards Pandora and noticed that Harper joined her next to the box. “You two put back everything that you took and step away from the box.” He watched as the duo put several small objects back to the box, when they straighten up he looked at them his eyes set hard. The children stood unmoving for a moment then Pandora placed a small ball back in the box, he smiled. “Okay, let’s go.”
“Oh, Draco you are really talented.” Ron moved towards Hermione and looked at the picture nodding his head.
The gallery was small. Draco didn’t know that muggles had such small galleries. When they went inside Hermione produced tickets and gave them to a short Asian woman that checked them. After a moment she smiled at the four of them and let them pass giving them all pamphlets and whishing them to have a good show. Draco smiled politely and thanked her.

Stay safe everyone and wear a mask!
He couldn’t stop himself Draco was talking about healing and potions and he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the blond. He didn’t know how but suddenly he found himself right in front of Draco, the boy didn’t seem to notice their closeness still absorbed in his explanation. Harry couldn’t stop looking at the blond, at the way he moved his arms when he was exited, at the smile that brightened up his whole face. He needed to do something about the feelings that threaten to rip him apart, so he kissed him.
“Don't worry. Your secret safe with me.” Shit, he was too careless.
“Draco, it’s okay. I forgive you, you didn’t know any better.” Harry smiled at him. “I think it’s time for the film we have shopping to do tomorrow.” He could only nod at the boy.
Today I want to tell you that history is fake and don't trust media.
She heard the door click open. She looked behind her and could see that Harry was standing there with his wand drawn. She knew that Draco couldn’t see this, but she still moved to cover the wand. The door opened and Andromeda couldn’t believe her eyes. Draco collapsed on the floor, there was a bleeding cut on his cheek and for the first time she noticed how thin he was.
“What kind of healer will come to aid him, Andromeda.” She glared at him. ”I know that he’s your nephew and I don’t want him to die, but if I say his name at St. Mungus no one will come. You and I both know it” The boy had a point
Today Harry and he were left to their own devices, while Hermione dragged Ron to another museum. Draco suspected that the red-head secretly enjoyed the museum trips and his reluctance was a ploy to annoy Hermione, but he decided not to share his observation with the witch. Since the weather wasn’t as hot as the day before the two of them decided to go sightseeing. Draco was surprised at how easily Harry was able to navigate the place. All the narrow lanes made Draco confused, but he was sure that the Gryffindor could safely take them back to the hotel from any place in the city.
"You all had been busy huh? This place looked lived in after one day. The carpet wasn't here yesterday." Sirius commented.
"Ten minutes what?" Draco asked.
"Argh… where the hell is it? I hope I didn't leave that at home. Knowing my luck, the first lesson will be double potions with the Slytherins. Now that stupid work assignment is… here! Yes!"
Harry liked the fact that someone seemed to think that he looked good, but as he was used to Seamus flirting with everyone, even Hermione, he didn't agree to anything, as he did happen to like that shirt. Something told him that if Seamus ever borrowed that shirt he would never get it back. He did grin down at Seamus who seemed to be stuck to his left arm, "Thanks Seam, but… then why is Malfoy still alive?"
Ten minutes later, Draco finally gave visible signs that he was awake, even though Harry sensed it five minutes ago. Harry playfully pushed Draco onto his back, as he was still unwilling to face the outside world yet. The fact that his wand had not buzzed yet meant that it was still early. He placed himself on top of Draco as he slightly nuzzled his neck. Draco blinked his eyes open as his hand came up behind Harry's back.
Silence reigned again at the stands where the two boys were sitting as both sat back to watch the team practice, with a pair of brown eyes staring at a particular chaser with a tinge of admiration in his eyes.
"Why am I not surprised? Strange things seemed to follow you two around. I should have suspected." He said. All a sudden, four chairs flew towards them, stopping behind each of them. "Please sit down while I explain." Everyone sat down. Harry and Draco were frowning in confusion. "Sirius, want to help explain the situation?" Dumbledore seemed to have regained his good humor and no longer seemed as serious as the previous moment.
Harry shook his head, "Too lazy." Draco just smiled at his answer.
"All this shows that Hermione has you whipped at seventeen. Imagine how your life is going to be if you married her." A voice drawled from the bed beside Harry's.
"You, can help me train. Ron, how about it? Someone who can help you think Quidditch strategies? He won't leak it to the Slytherins now. And he was a good player." Harry looked at Ron. Draco looked at Ron too.
"His parents passed away. ALL his relatives passed away. Word's out that his parents said something wrong to You-Know-Who and he was so angry that he killed them all. He's the ONLY Malfoy left." Seamus collapsed beside Harry and cuddled up to him. Harry just let him be as always while all the people in the compartment frowned at Seamus' behavior. He had the tendency to think that just because both Harry and he were gay so they could cuddle when both were unattached. Harry did notice that Dean was trying to avoid looking at the two of them. Seamus continued, not caring about the others, but staring at Harry, "Oh Harry, you have grown so much! Hmm… promise me you will lend me this shirt one of these days? I think I'm drooling…"
Draco then caught sight of Day, who was practicing with Ron, by shooting all sorts of funny goals at him. She had refused to miss any more practices, after lying in the infirmary for three days under Madam Promfrey's naggings. She did agree to going for a few appointments with a mind healer to talk over her trauma, so that she could sleep better at night. When she was finally released from the infirmary, Draco and Harry were waiting for her to bring her to her new room. It was lunchtime and thus the common room was empty, and she didn't have to face anyone whom she was not ready to face yet. She went upstairs with the two boys, and they introduced her to Marcus, and told her the password. They then entered the Study area, where there was an additional table with Day's things on it, which Ginny and Hermione had made the trip to Day's previous room to move them up. They also moved her clothes and personal stuff into the closet beside the new bed in the girls' room. Day was fascinated with the place, as well as with the Marauder's Map. Later in the evening, when Draco and Harry had gone up to the dorm to pick her up for dinner, they found her sitting at a corner of the common room talking to Headless Nick, who was telling Day about the adventures he had while he was alive. Both of them were amused by the fact that when Day was bored, she would even attempt talking to the castle ghosts. However, no matter how Day said that she wanted to be strong after the ordeal, Draco noticed in the next few days that whenever she was in a place with too many people, she would be more tense than normal and that when her friends from her year greeted her, she would shy away from contact if possible and only allow the group that she shared her room with to touch and be close to her. Even within the eight of them, people like Neville and Ron were trying to give her space and Dean and Seamus were always clinging on to each other. Ginny and Hermione were not the type who went around touching people, and thus the only people who really touched Day were actually just Harry and Draco. Draco was glad that Day trusted the two of them, but it was actually unhealthy for her. He sighed, as he presumed that he had to give Day time for her to get used to everything. After all, it had only been a week since the attack had happened, and hopefully the appointments with the mind healer would start to help her soon.
"Yeah. We didn't even need to teach you." Godric answered. The two boys blushed and Harry wondered how they were going to leave. As if Godric could read his mind, he answered. "If you want to leave, you just have to imagine yourself back in your body. Feel free to visit us by imagining yourself down here. It won't happen when you make love again." He grinned. The two boys smiled and waved goodbye to the two guardians and imagined themselves back in their bodies in their room.
Harry sighed.
"Why are some of them taking notes?" Harry whispered to Day who had come to sit down beside him, in Draco's vacated seat.
Harry laughed. "Why should I mind? I'm happy for you both. So Professor, does that make you my godmother?" Harry grinned, and Remus blushed at his comment. Everyone laughed.
After they finished lunch, Hermione dragged Ron off to the library to check out a book that Snape mentioned as a reference book and the rest of the group slowly made their way to the Transfiguration classroom, discussing Quidditch along the way.
Draco's eyes went misty, as he smiled at Harry. Harry felt Draco's happiness flood his whole body, as Draco bent down to drop a soft kiss on Harry's lips. "I love you too, Harry Potter." He then kissed Harry again. Harry used his tongue to lick Draco's lips, as he opened them, granting Harry entrance. Harry then touched his tongue to Draco's tongue as contentment washed over the two of them. Harry withdrew his tongue as they parted with their eyes wide.
The boy in the portrait realized that they are in front of his portrait and said, "Hi, I'm Marcus. Password?"
Harry laughed. "But we need to discuss stuff. It's very tiring to discuss in a whisper." He said in his normal voice. "You know, I think we need to be kept informed of things that happen. Do you know about the Order?" He asked. The Order that he was referring to was the Order of the Phoenix, a group of people who were fighting against Vorldemort. He had been told about their existence since fifth year but wasn't asked to join yet, as he was still a student of the school.
"But you are his boyfriend. He's a Gryffindor. Gryffindors tell their boyfriends everything."
Draco lifted his head to stare at Harry's emerald eyes. He then shifted till he was above Harry, supporting his own body with his elbows. "I like you too. But it is happening too fast. Want to slow it down? Because I don't play around. I don't want to just have sex. I rather there are feelings between us before we do anything. Is that okay?"
"Hmm… Good that you two are no longer quarrelling. During the summer when I was tagging around him, he was quite nice to me, totally different from Lucius. He told me a bit about his childhood, and I have to admit, it was ugly. He said that his father kicked him out of his house, telling him to go find Snape because besides Snape, Draco had no one left. Lucius was going to disown him but Voldie struck. If he had that kind of family background, he still managed to differentiate right and wrong, then he can't be that bad huh?" Sirius smiled encouragingly at Harry, before popping back into his animagus form. Harry nodded and started his run, leaving Sirius who laid his head down on his front paws.  He was glad that Harry had chosen him to be the first person to tell.
In the bathroom, he brushed his teeth and washed his face with cold water so as to wake himself up. He wouldn't want to trip over his own feet when running just because he was too sleepy. Suddenly a pair of arms encircled his waist from behind and a hoarse 'Good morning' was spoken to the back of his neck. Harry grinned, recognizing who it was and said a 'Good morning' to Draco who he saw from the mirror was snuggling into his back like a cat.
"Sorry Dean, you look so cute just now. Well take it slowly then. You don't have to tell him now. Just wait a while. You know what Seamus is like. Ask yourself if you can actually accept all his good points as well as all his flaws. If you can accept him as he is, and that he does like you, then… I don't see how come this is not going to work. It is just the next step after so many years of you guys being such good friends. Everyone, even Seamus and I know that we don't belong together. That's why he feel safe being near me as both of us won't mistake him as interested in me or vice versa. Look at Ron and Herm. They look stable. If any wagers are placed on which couple are the likeliest to settle down I would bet on them. And Ron liked Herm after at least three years of knowing her so well. And I think that Seam is interested in you, just that you always seem to promote yourself as a straight guy so he didn't try anything. I did see him check you out before." Harry grinned to put his friend's mind at ease.
Harry smiled at Dean. "Then we can safely say that you are at least bisexual. And… maybe you should tell Seam about it." Harry had never seen Dean's eyes grow that big before as he burst into laughter.
As Harry listened to it, he realized that this was the last sorting of the first years he was going to see. Memories flowed in his mind as he recalled what happened the last six years. Before he was eleven, he never knew that there was a world out there that actually wanted him alive. Then he found out the truth about his parents' death and in the process of trying to live till his twelfth birthday, he faced Voldemort for the second time in his life. In the year after that he faced Voldemort's sixteen-year-old self in the Chamber of Secrets. The year after that he found out that his godfather Sirius Black was alive and had been wrongly accused of the crime of betraying Harry's parents. Then came the year in which he took part in the Triwizard Tournament, nearly dying in the end when dueling with Voldemort. They say that a cat had nine lives. He himself wondered how many lives he has. For the past two years, Voldemort did not really try to come after him. But he did send his death eaters to harm different wizards and witches as well as some muggles. He seemed to be trying to gather as much power as possible before the day Harry graduate, in ready to kill Harry. Harry then briefly wondered if Pansy already received the Death Mark.
"Sirius, I normally go for morning jogs. Seamus says that I shouldn't go alone. And I don't want to wake them up early. Do you think you could be my bodyguard every morning?" Harry asked Sirius.
"… And Harry Potter catches the snitch, finishing this atrocious game at 450-20 with the Gryffindors winning! I'm not putting you down, Harry, but it seems that the team didn't really need the snitch to win! This three-hour game is rather brutal, not because the Slytherins are cheating, but it seemed that the Lions are determined to place all the Slytherin players in the infirmary. The Lions are all hugging their seeker, even their junior team, who were let out to the pitch to play for half an hour just now when Captain Weasley realized that there is no way their team could lose. And they are finally separated from their seeker, who had been on a winning streak since he came to Hogwarts and… do I see their chaser Finnegan heading out to the Gryffindor audience? And he stopped in front of Thomas, his boyfriend of a few months. His team members seemed to realize that something is happening and surrounded him… does anyone have a pair of omniculars? Thank you Professor Dumbledore… and Finnegan is taking something out from his pocket… it looks like… he opened the black thing and … Potter is waving his wand at Finnegan, as he dismounted from his broom in mid-air, it looks like a levitating spell… Finnegan looked like his kneeling down in the air and… good Merlin! He's proposing to Thomas in front of the whole school on the Quidditch pitch! And Thomas is grinning and nodding and pulled Finnegan towards him and they kissed! And… ouch… Professor McGonagall… that hurt! Oh… well, that's the match between Slytherins and Gryffindors and a successful marriage proposal! All the best wishes to the couple and… ouch… yes Professor, I'll shut up now. Quietus."
"Um, no. At least, I don't think so. The questions haven't really been set yet. What we are doing this year in Intermediate DADA is to train you to think critically so that you are able to differentiate between right and wrong after you graduate, instead of just blind following."
Professor Lupin looked at Harry and nodded. "The rest of us will be involved in the defense of the attack. Voldemort will have to get through the entire first sixth years of the Gryffindor boys to get to Marcus. Then he had to get through Marcus. Marcus was told that should his portrait be destroyed, he is to trigger the system such that all of you inside will hear an alarm to know that outside is being attacked and to lock the panel against opening at all cost. Hopefully that will allow you all enough time to escape through this panel before the death-eaters destroy the panel that Marcus locked."
Draco quickly took off his robe as well, pulled a t-shirt from his closet and combed his hair. "I'll join you." All Seamus did was to wait at the door for him. All three left their room, and went down to the Gryffindor common room.
Day grinned. "DADA."
"Harry, are you trying to get me worked up here?" Draco smirked at Harry.
Draco smiled. "Precisely." He could feel Harry's heartbeat under where he placed his palms. He stared up at Harry, examining the features of Harry's face. The peace and contentment he felt just touching Harry, just looking at him and having Harry look back was overwhelming. He had the sudden inclination to find a hole anywhere on Earth just to hide Harry away so as to protect him against danger.
Harry's shirt was unbuttoned as a half-naked Draco was in his lap, sucking at a particular part of his neck. Harry's head was thrown back against the couch of their study area as he moaned to the sensation of Draco's hand in his unzipped jeans stroking him. The others had gone to bed and they had placed a silencing and repelling spell on the circular room, when one thing led to another. Draco shifted to lick Harry's nipple as Harry started to unbutton Draco's pants. He somehow managed to strip Draco of his pants and boxers, while Draco shifted himself to allow Harry to pull his garments down further. A look at each other's eyes and Draco used his wandless magic to prepare himself for Harry's entrance. As Harry joined himself to Draco, all the two boys could feel was the feeling of their chest brushing against each other and the love and contentment of the feeling of being 'together'. As Draco rocked both of them gently towards a climax, he could not believe that in the months since he had nothing, he seemed to have gained everything, and that he would never be alone again. When both cuddled for a moment after their climax, tears spilled from Draco's eyes.
Anyone looking into the kitchen of this house would think that this was a normal house, with a normal household consisting of parents with two children. Except that this was not the case. Three of them were normal, and they were a family. However, the seventeen-year-old boy who was currently serving the other severely overweight boy was not normal or part of the family. He never deemed himself to be anyway. He was the cousin of the other boy, and nothing about him was normal, due to that lightning bolt scar that marked his forehead above his right eyebrow. He was not just leaving for school, but he was leaving for a wizard school, where the curriculum was pertaining to teaching the students how to use magic. And this year was his last year in the school, and after that, it meant that he would be able to use magic whenever he felt like it. Harry was now hurrying through breakfast so that he could get out of this house for the rest of his life as fast as possible, as he knew that after he graduated, he no longer had to live with his uncle, aunt and his dreadful cousin, whose whole family treated him as a maid.
Harry knew that Draco never really believed them, but still it was nice that everyone made an effort to end the injustice and favouritism that plagued Hogwarts. Thanks to this Harry could spend time with Draco outside their room which allowed them to find what according to Draco was the best tree near the lake in all the Hogwarts. At first, Harry wanted to argue, but now sitting under the tree he couldn’t agree more, not only could they see the whole lake, but also somehow the tree was always in the shadow.
He watched as a small pond appeared, looking closer he discovered that it was the small pond that he was so fond of when he was a child. He knew exactly where it was on the manor grounds and even now he could find it with his eyes closed. He could feel himself smile. “Oh, you got to teach me how to do that.”
The dark expression on Hermione’s face cleared and she smiled a little. “I will.”
“What’s going on Mr Black?”
Have fun reading.
When the train finally arrived, the compartment that he and his friends were occupying once again was the last to exit the train. Harry was the last to actually step on the platform when he finally pocked his head out of the train the crowd of students once again looked straight at him. He wanted to run, but suddenly a hand appeared in front of his head. Draco wanted to hold Harry’s hand despite the poisonous looks that the rest of the students were sending him. He took his hand without hesitation and let Draco guide him to the carriage.
Have a lovely weekend!
When they arrived near the pub Harry noticed that Draco started to fidget. He played with his hands, Harry watched as Draco started to scratch at his left forearm.
“Your speech at Diagon Alley. It really helped me. I never thought that I have friends or be in a friends group. This is new to me.” Draco seemed a little dazed, but there was still a smile on his face.
Talk about Belarus and support then in their time of crisis.
“They’re also your friends, love.” With that, he kissed Draco and held his hand to help the blond stand up.
Draco stood and hurried to the door when he opened then he came face to face with the boy who lived. He smiled wickedly and addressed the boy in front of him. “Hello, roommate.”
He could feel like the weight of the present left his hand and with all his strength he willed himself not to fidget while he waited for Harry’s reaction.
“Andromeda, can you please tell me what the fuck just happened?” She noticed that his voice trembled a little.
He slowly felt himself drift when suddenly the fireplace flashed green, quickly he sat up and watched as Draco appeared in the fireplace. As his boyfriend dusted himself off, Harry stood up and enveloped him in tight a hug.
“I promise not to hold everything inside. I learned my lesson” He felt as if the smile was permanently painted on his face, even if only for one day.
Harry quickly pulled Hagrid towards his jacket, when the Half-Giant finally put it on, he coaxed him out of the hut. The five of them started to talk about the holidays and Harry stepped closer to his boyfriend. “I love you.”
The moment broke when Harry heard Teddy’s crying. Quickly he took a step back and turned around.
“Do you wanna talk about it?” At his words, the blond stirred, but still didn’t look at him, so he decided to continue. “I don’t really know what happened, but I won’t judge. You can tell me anything you want.”
“I don’t know what to say. I… Thank you, really. I have no problem with sharing a room with Harry.” He could feel tears making their way down his face, but this time these were not tears born form sadness.
“Well, first of all, I don’t think you need fixing, you may be damaged but you are not broken. Second of all, I will always try to help the ones that need it, and it’s not my saving people thing so before you get to that conclusion I want to stop you right there. I believe that you need saving about as much as I do. So I have a proposition, we help each other. The past month was one of the most relaxing months I had in forever and you had a lot to do with it, I don’t want our friendship to end when we are back at Hogwarts” Harry could see a small smile slowly making its way onto Draco’s face. “And I’m sure that you also want to stay friends. So we help each other heal okay?”
Harry waited patiently for Draco to start the explanation wondering whether he will have to step in. To his surprise, the blond didn’t hesitate this time. “Could we come in?”
He looked down at Draco one again, he had his hoodie. “What did you take?”
“I must say, I didn’t expect this. I’m not sure what prompted this but I kinda like it.” It was Ron who broke the silence and seemed to bring Draco back from his thought.
It took Draco 10 minutes to finish his ice cream and clean himself. Harry led him towards a big building from which a lot of people was coming out. Draco couldn’t suppress the urge to ask questions.
“Yeah, we kinda gathered.” Ron gave him a meaningful smile and Harry felt the blush returning to his face.
“I – yeah. But please don’t call me Malfoy.” Harry just stares at the boy. “It just sounds too much as my father. I just need a break from it all.” Harry understands.
“Oh, god. I’m sorry, but look they wrote about our potion and how the first dosages of it are being given to the patients. I’m so happy I could kiss you Draco.” Draco smiled and wanted to answer the boy when he felt a protective arm around his waist.
“Yes, I want you to fuck me.” He watched as the Gryffindor turned to the nightstand with lightning speed and took out the lube.
“What would you need my help with?”
They be drinking, they be snacking.
“I don’t know what are you talking about.”
This time it was Ron, who answered him. “That’s why we came for the two of you. I figured that since no one saw the two of you since we got off the Hogwarts express you will be here.”
Harry quickly cast the warming charm and they started to chat about the essay for Potions.
“Yeah, this one is too long. Can you remind me who is it this week Shakespeare or Byron?” Draco laughed.
“I quit” he almost didn’t hear his voice over the ringing in his ears.
When the day finally arrived Draco couldn’t stop shaking and he had no idea what to wear. His nervousness had to be more visible because after breakfast Andromeda waltzed into his room took one look at him, walked over to his wardrobe and picked out an outfit for him.
“Remember how yesterday you told me not to stay up too late when I was going out with Ron.” Draco furrowed his eyebrows as he recollected that, but he also clearly remembered that Harry did get home at a reasonable time.
“I believe that this is all, you will be given your timetables tomorrow during breakfast so I recommend attending it. Oh and Mr Malfoy please stay for a moment.” Although her tone didn’t indicate anything bad he couldn’t help but clench Harry’s hand stronger.
He could help the hopefulness that came over him Potter was going to back to Hogwarts, maybe they weren’t the best of friends or even the worse of friends but this could mean that he won’t be so alone.
Through his haze, Draco suddenly heard a child’s laughter. What was a child doing with Bellatrix? And then it all clicked.
“What if she changed her mind? And its past curfew, what if she won’t help us after curfew?” Harry knew that he shouldn’t laugh but the panicked voice of the ice prince of Slytherin made the corners of his lips involuntary turn-up.
At the mention of the afternoon Draco’s interest spiked once again. “Are we going to the library or do you have something else in mind?”
Be strong and remember that you are valid and beautiful/handsome.
Slowly they made their way toward the greenhouse, they were silent for a long time when Harry finally asked the question that Draco could guess was killing him. “So, what did she want?”
After putting on the film, Harry sat next to Draco. A moment later he felt Draco shift, and he watched as the blond lied down on the couch.
He used all his will power to answer Draco, but even for him, his voice sounded a little shaky. “Why wouldn’t I have everything?”
Soon the first Wesley’s will start to attend Hogwarts alongside their children, and Harry knows that the combination of George and Angelina’s children, Fleur and Bill’s children and theirs will make for some extremely hard years. Then just as Teddy will finish the school Ron and Hermione’s first child will start the school and Sam the youngest of Draco and his adopted children will join him. It will be an exhausting period during which their oldest and middle child as well as the oldest Wesley’s will still be in school and will have the chance to corrupt the youngest generation.
-year table stood just below the staff table. When Harry got closer he noticed that there was a place left in the middle of the table, just below the headmistress chair. He saw people beckoning him to this place, but he knew that this will never be his place. Still holding Draco’s hand, he caught up with Ron and Hermione and led them as far away as he could get from the waving people.
HI, stay safe and wear a mask!
I know that you probably are sick of all the bad happenings in the world but please if you have time let any member of the LGBTQIA+ community that lives in Poland know that they matter and that they are seen.

“Check your robes.” Confused the Gryffindor started to pat on his robes, after a moment he looked up and took his wand out from the front pocket.
“I see, so Draco it is. Okay, I’m Dr Bright and I’m going to ask you some question. Is that okay with you?” Draco wondered if he really has a choice, surely if he could just skip this he would be told.
Hello,
For a moment Draco looked nervous. “I always wanted to do something with potions, but I don’t think that being a potion master is for me, so I want to become a healer specialised in potions and potion damages. This way I can not only help people but also make up for the wrong in my past.”
Harry feel asleep, he didn’t know when he vaguely remembers Draco wishing him goodnight, he remembers saying it back and then he was out. Somehow his dream wasn’t that bad or he just didn’t get to the bad part yet. He dreamed about camping, but it wasn’t the dream about running away from Voldemort, it was quite pleasant, sitting in the forest in front of a big campfire. He was about to tell Ron that he actually never saw a campfire this big when he heard erratic breathing coming from something in the forest. Harry woke up a second later wondering what woke him when he heard the breathing from his dream. Turning left he thought that he will come face to face with some kind of beast, not with trashing Draco.
Harry watched as the students slowly left the Great Hall, he didn’t know what this year had in store for them all but he couldn’t wait to find out.
Curious Harry asked. “What’s so special about the book?”
year students appeared in front of them. Draco looked as Harry stepped in front of him successfully making him feel less uncomfortable.
“He’s gotten so big.” Draco smiled at him
“And - ” He paused Andromeda couldn’t get him, she had to take care of Teddy. The only other person that could get him was. “Harry can get me, Harry Potter.”
Harry wasn’t sure what it was with today. First, he lost his favourite pair of trousers, then some lady spilt her coffee on him, on his way to Andromeda someone almost run him over, Draco Malfoy of all people open Andromeda’s door and now Malfoy had some sort of attack in her bathroom. For him, this day couldn’t get any weirder or, so he thought.
Let me know what you think about this. I crave validation.
The trio looked at him and began to laugh. Draco felt his cheeks redden. “Harry, you explain.” With that, Ron and Hermione entered the classroom.
A car drove past them and he couldn't stop the grimace that appeared on his face, in the corner of his eyes he could see that Ron did the same. He wasn’t sure if this is because of the flying car incident from the second year or if Ron has the same problem with the air quality that he has, but the gesture immediately made him relax.
“Who I date is none of your business and if I were you I would stop with the hate full comments because my patience is wearing thin. Now let us pass and fuck off.” Harry started to walk through the group and Draco followed him, a small smile on his face. Harry actually stood up for him, he knew that Harry liked him to the point of defending him, but knowing and actually seeing him do that made his heart hammer in his chest.
After half an hour Harry felt that he looked somewhat presentable. The clothes weren’t too lose and he didn’t feel like he was drowning in them.
“If this isn’t a problem for you”
He knew that Draco tried to be strong, but he also knew that he will only know how this affected him tomorrow. He didn’t want to leave Draco.
“I know that it’s not the time for presents yet, but I have something for you Draco.” He knew that Andromeda could see that he was surprised by the way she smiled. “It’s nothing bad, come on.”
“That depends am I going to get in trouble?” The carefree tone in which Harry asked the question told Draco that the idea of getting in trouble wouldn’t scare the raven-haired boy off.
Back in her office, she saw as Harry was pacing from one corner to her other nervously glancing from her to Draco. When he noticed that she looked at him he stopped and walk over to Draco, who looked as if he was going to fall.
Draco came closer to him and Harry didn’t know what to expect. Draco look at him with expectation and Harry realised that he was still holding Teddy.
The four of them arrived in front of Hagrid’s chat just as the door of it opened. “I was waiting for the four of you. How it went?” Harry smiled at Hagrid’s concerned tone.
“I’m sorry. It’s not that I don’t want to, I just, I can’t face him. I can’t see Granger knowing that my aunt tortured her. I can’t see Weasley without hearing his screams. I can’t see them without wishing I was dead. Not now, not yet.” He hoped that Harry could understand. The expression on the boy’s face was unreadable and Draco hated not knowing what will come next.
“I’m sorry, I know that you have Teddy to take care of. I won’t stay long. Honestly, I just need a couple of days to get money and find my own flat.” He knew that was rumbling again.
“Do you want to” Before he could finish asking the question Draco’s lips were back on his.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t do anything, yet. I just need to borrow some clothes.” At this admission, Ron sat up and glared at him
And my last idea!
Draco got on his broom and started to hover over the building waiting for the boy to exit. After 20 minutes the raven-haired boy appeared, with one swift motion Draco dumped the bag full of feathers on Harry and hid on the roof of the building. He watched as Harry tried to unstick the feathers from himself, after 5 minutes the boy went back probably to shower. Draco smirked knowing that his problem won’t be solved by a simple shower. After making sure that no one was looking, he flew towards the Great Lake, landed and went back to the dorm where he left his broom and made his way to dinner.
Polish people, please don't lose hope, we can still fix the disaster that is happening in this country. Also polish LBGTQIA+ community, you are not an ideology, you are a person and I see you and I support you and I will always be on your side. Please keep going because you are important and you cannot let them win!
“Come on, let's help Harry and Sam with the table and hope that your sister won’t set anything on fire this time.” Harper laughed as they made their day to the cottage. Harry couldn’t believe that Teddy already ended Hogwarts, he remembers sending him off at King’s Cross as if it was yesterday. Now the boy stood taller than him with a smile on his face and the whole world opened to him.
He could see that he was shaking and Harry was sure that this was this end of their little trip outside. When he finally caught up with Draco. The boy’s face was red and the tears still fell from his face.
Draco leaned to his ear and whispered. “Our daughter just created an advanced invisibility potion.” Harry searched for Pandora, who was staring at George with a smile on her face.
TW!!!
“Well, I feel exposed and besides I eat the normal amount of food thank you. I just like snacks.” He looked at Ron who was looking through the menu. “Ron agrees with me we should order something, also Andromeda would kill me if I didn’t take care of you.” The last comment was directed at Draco, who now looked at Harry with pure annoyance on his hand.
“Yeah, the air is weird and I don’t really like the busy cities much. I prefer being somewhere nice and quiet where muggle can't drive their cars.” He looked at Hermione and for a moment worried that she once again will take his comment as an attack on muggle inventions, but to his surprise, she smiled.
After what felt as forever but was, in fact, a very long five minutes he couldn’t stand it anymore and went for the door once again. Before he could try for the handle, the door swung open revealing surprised Draco.  The surprise quickly melted into one of the smiles that now rarely appeared on Draco’s face. “Hello, roommate.” His voice was sweet and for a moment Harry didn’t understand the implication behind the words, but then he felt as his eyes widened.
Everything was different for him even something so simple as meal times. While at the Manor they eat in silence and he was never allowed to eat much, at Andromeda’s mealtime was never silent and Andromeda encouraged him to eat whatever he wanted. Although because of anxiety he didn’t eat much, he ate what he liked and that was enough of a victory for Draco.
“I think that everything depends on the number of 8th years that return, but I’m also pretty sure that McGonagall won’t make us share a dorm with other years.”
“I think I could get used to this.” As the words left his mouth he smiled right back at him.
“I guess we will see in a moment. We’re almost there.”
It had taken Harry another week to persuade Draco to talk with McGonagall and by the time he finally agreed it was already past curfew. Sometimes Harry wanted to shake Draco until he finally understands that asking for help was not a sign of weakness, but he knew that Lucius’ lessons left a lot of wounds and scars that still had to heal. The fact that most of the scars, that Draco beard, were well hidden was only a reminder of the things that Harry had no idea about.
here is the last chapter of this fic!! I'm very excited to post it and I cannot wait to hear what y'all think about it. Honestly, when I started to write this fic I never would have guessed that it will become so long, but I wouldn't change a think about it.
Now to the Polish problem, I really hope that if you are 18 you will vote in this election, I also hope that if you will vote you will choose someone who does not degrade a whole group of people. That being said if you are a PERSON that identifies as a member of LBGTQIA+ community I hope you know that people care, I care and that you are valid and visible. This fight will never be over and you cannot give up, there still a lot to change and I hope that you know that change can start with you!
“I’m fine. I just need a moment. There’s no need to worry. I — I just need a moment” the boy sounded weird. Something was definitely wrong, very, very wrong. “I will be down in a second. You don’t have to wait up.” He was frantic, she could tell that something bad was about to happen.
When Teddy began Hogwarts, Harry gifted him his invisibility cloak after Harper joined him the two of them started to share the cloak. Now as more and more of their family were attending the school, the cloak was in constant use, to solve the problem their brilliant daughter decided to develop a potion that would work similarly to the cloak, but with a set timer. Draco was proud that she showed such an interest in Potions, but he was also worried about the use that this particular potion when she succeeded because Draco did not doubt that she would.
Harry was awoken by the loud knocking, not looking up he unlocked the door.
Draco landed on the bed with a small gasp he felt as his breath leaves him. He recovered and managed to take a deep breath just as Harry sat on his thighs, successfully pinning him in place. The raven-haired man started to kiss his way down Draco’s torso, making sure that he kissed every part of his scars. Draco knew that he was a mess, but he couldn’t stop the moans from escaping him with every kiss Harry planted on him. When the Gryffindor started to draw near his bellbottom, Draco felt as Harry's hands started to unbutton his pants. Draco shivered at the sensation, and lifted his head watching as a smirk appeared on Harry's face.
“I’m fine Harry. I think it’s time Hermione and I leave before we lose our reservation. See you guys later!” With the last statement, Ron took Hermione’s hand and quickly led her out of the corridor and disappeared down the stairs.
“Love you too, Man Wonder.” Harry smiled, and this time Draco leaned down and kissed him.
Draco looked at Harper, then at Sam, who looked about ready to cry. “Well, it didn’t work the last 20 times so no, but be more careful.” He noticed a smiled on Harper’s face.
After a month Draco was done. He couldn’t do this anymore. His mother and the constant jabs and commentary she provided. His father’s cane that was more frequent the longer he was home. And most importantly his mind, he couldn’t shut his mind.
Harry laugh and Draco could feel a smile slowly making its way back onto his face “We could buy the candy bar after you eat the ice cream. Now stop complaining and enjoy this overly sweet creation.”
Harry was silent for a moment then looked at him and smiled. “I was thinking about taking you on a date to Hogsmeade.”
He wanted to hug him and never let go. He wanted to stay by Harry’s side
“Yes, Mr Potter, I’m afraid that you must.” Her tone didn’t betray anything and he started to worry.
When they arrived in their room, Draco pulled Harry towards him. The kiss they exchanged was passionate and left him breathless and wishing for more. Thankfully he didn’t have to wait long, Harry kissed him and Draco quickly pressed against the shorter boy losing himself in the kiss.
“You stupid, insolent bastard you meant to tell me that you still didn’t compensate for your stupidity in 6th year” Draco could feel the shivers take over him “I still can’t believe how you manage to convict that bastard Potter to testify for you.” The coldness in Lucius' voice made him feel even worse.
This year is horrible, but please don't stop fighting. I believe in you and I support you. If you are form Poland, I guess we will see each other during one of the protests. Keep fighting!!
“Thank you Rosmerta, do you think it will be safe for us to sit out there?” Even though he was relieved that Rosmerta was letting them stay he was still worried about the other patrons.
Warning! description of violence
Harry noticed that Harper was talking with George clearly distracting him as Pandora and Fred Jr carefully put a few drops of some greenish potion into his Butterbeer. To the left Sam was talking with Rose and Hugo about his new hyper-fixation, Harry wasn’t sure if this time it was Shakespeare or Byron and he noted to remember to ask him tomorrow. Teddy was sitting next to Victoria and Dominique trying, and from what Harry could gather failing to change his features to look like Peeves, both of the girls were laughing, and Harry felt himself a smile as well. Louis and Roxanne were discussing something very vividly, and Harry wouldn’t be surprised if it had something to do with Quidditch. He looked around and searched for the familiar head of platinum blond hair. After what seemed like forever, Harry finally located his husband near the pond. Affection filled him, and he felt as a warm smiled appeared on his face.
“Yes, I think it would be good for me. Besides, when Teddy gets to Hogwarts I will make sure that he won’t be getting in any trouble.” Draco laughed at his comment and soon Harry joined him.
“Yeah. I will aparate us to Leaky” Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from the smile.
When they finally broke the kiss both of them were breathless, Draco couldn’t stop looking at Harry’s swollen lisp. “Thank you Draco, this is amazing, but I don’t have anything for you.”
“Thank you for once again making my boyfriend ran away.” He was aware of the bitterness on his voice, but after all, he did deserve one moment alone with Draco.
Andromeda just laughed at him got up and left Harry alone at the table. Slowly he got up and tried to make his way towards Draco when out of nowhere Ginny appeared in front of him.
Polish LGBTQIA+ Community I know it's bad but don't lose hope. I see you and one day it will be better. If not we can always start a revolution!!!
To his surprise, Draco squeezed his hand harder and when Harry looked at him his cheeks had a lovely shade of pink. “I… Can you please hold my hand it makes me calm. You make me calm.” Draco was looking everywhere but at him and for a moment he wasn’t sure what was supposed to be his next move in this situation. Draco started to pull his hand away. “Of course you don’t have to. Just forget it, this was stupid.” But before Draco could finish he already trapped Draco’s hand back in his.
If you an American remember to vote!!
“You need to relax and your hold needs to be more firm.” Draco’s voice was more like a purr and this time Harry suppressed his shiver. The blond initiated the moves of Harry's hand, with the additional grasp Harry did feel more confident in his movements. “Remember to protect your thumb. Here, let me.” Harry watches as Draco slid his fingers unto the knives handle in place of Harry’s. His left hand still firmly held Harry in place, the blond’s movements were calculated and he couldn’t stop looking at the way that the moved, he swallowed loudly just when Draco whispered. “Your turn.”
During his first year at Hogwarts, he didn’t know how to behave, he never had this much freedom and besides, he still believed in the things his father basically beat into him. Then winter break came and he saw happy reunions, this made him realize that his family isn’t so great, his parents shouldn’t punish him, shouldn’t leave bruises on him. Still, he didn’t know what to do with this knowledge, he could just go through the notions and survive. When the first year ended and he was below Granger, his father wasn’t pleased. Lucius almost killed him this summer, so in the second year, he decided to take all his frustrations on other people. He hated Granger because in his head she was the source of his pain, he hated Weasley because he had the family life and love that Draco never had and never would have, and he hated Potter because he had real friends that would die for him, not future business partners like he had.
Hello, I'm late with the chapter I know but TBH I'm still not okay after my exam session and I will try to write more during the weekend so next chapter should be up on Saturday, hopefully!
He closed his eyes when the time for his punishment came. He knew what he deserved and what he didn’t. He definitely didn’t deserve Potter’s testimony, he also didn’t deserve for his aunt to show up and testify in his favour. He wanted to shout, scream that he wasn’t worth it. How could they do this, didn’t they knew that no one could save him. No matter what they said Draco knew he deserved punishment for his crimes, but he was set free. Draco couldn’t believe what he heard. He will need to return to Hogwarts and his punishment required him to undergo a psychological evaluation. At this Draco couldn’t breathe.
The painting presented a man with a short brow beard kissing another man, both of them looked extremely happy. They were wrapped in a rainbow flag and Draco could feel himself reaching out to touch the painting, but before he could do it a hand stopped him. He looked to his left and saw Harry, he wasn’t surprised per se but for a moment he forgot that the Boy Who Lived was next to him, for a moment the only thing that mattered was the panting. Harry looked and Draco could read his face very clearly. Harry was asking a silent question ‘Do you wanna talk about it’. He smiled at the boy next to him and squeezed his hand. “Later.” He answered quietly.
The headmistress briefly looked at their joined hands and smiled a little, but soon her expression returned to normal. “That’s very peculiar indeed. The fact that all your life you had the same dream is very weird, but considering that your family is known for being good at occlumency it may be connected with this, maybe some kind of safe space for your thoughts.  I imagine that you were under a lot of stress at the time, or you had to make a lot of difficult decisions which can be connected with the change, but I would have to look into your mind to understand it better.”
The redhead pulls back and addressed his girlfriend. “Mione this is a brilliant idea. Just imagine the view and all the snacks we could eat.” He noticed the dopey smile on Ron’s face and he had to admit that it was contiguous because soon the four of them were laughing.
“Well, I… I mean he…we?” He didn’t know what to say.
When the train finally stopped a McGonagall’s voice sounded in all the compartments. “Hello, students. All first-year students will go with Hagrid, all students from year 2nd to 7th will travel by carriages and the returning 8th-year students are to wait for me. Thank you and I will see you all soon.”
I hope you have a nice day.
“I know that you said that you’re gonna stay just till you find your own place, but I want you to know that you don’t have to go.” This left him speechless, Draco could feel tears making their way down his face.
After what seemed like forever to Harry, Malfoy’s voice finally made an appearance. “I think that this time my father will refrain from any kind of threats.” He spoke slowly as if the word pained him. “If you allow me to stay, I could use a spear bed. I think I’m not welcome back home.”
They studied for the past hour and right now on their break Draco decided to sketch their tree. He watched the precise movements of Draco’s hand and couldn’t stop himself. He leaned down and pressed his lips to Draco’s, the blond kiss him back and when he pulled back he found the blond smiling.

I know that pride is over but do you really expect me to stop. Every day is pride when you have the courage to fight for your rights, for your life and when you have the courage to keep going even when everything feels like you shouldn't.
“I am aware that the youngest of your little trouble makers still didn’t grace the school with his unique way of chaos. I am also the person that creates the time tables, and I can organise your schedule in a way that won’t leave little Sam unattended. I will leave you to think about the proposition, take as long as you want, but do consider it.” She smiled at Draco once again.
As Harry was about to retort, Slughorn entered the classroom and the Gryffindor feel silent. The lesson was peaceful and Draco almost relaxed, but when at the end Harry started to fidget he knew that the raven-haired boy did something.
Taking Harry’s hand into his he tugged the boy towards the paintings. Looking around he saw that every single one of them shown a situation that he guessed can be seen as controversial or weird for the muggles. The paintings showed people from all the ethnics, some showed the contrast between what is real and what is fiction. Draco loves every single one of the painting, he knew what was the goal of the exhibition and he was grateful because the author showed that they are equal, that they are all humans. He hoped that thanks to this person's work the muggles won’t start a pointless war, that in their world ended just a few months ago.
“I didn’t really leave Andromeda’s house and besides they don’t care about the relationship I have with my parents. I’m going to talk with some person that probably hates me because of the family name that still exists in my papers. They will probably threaten me and that’s that nothing new if you think about this.” Harry, hated how dejected Draco sounded.
“Oh.” The boy in front of him smiled and moved closer towards Draco. “So, you are saying that I can kiss you again?”

“Hermione and Harry are going to be here in a moment.” Ron looked nice, the red-head was dressed in a muggle suit and Draco noticed that his hair was styled in a way that exposed his blue eyes.
Slowly Draco lifted his shivering hands and quickly pulled the zipper of Harry's pants down. The Gryffindor sat on his knees, making his erection visible. Draco lifted his hips and with one movement Harry pulled his pants down leaving him only in his underwear. Quickly Draco reached for Harry pants, the Gryffindor let him pull them down to his knees. When both of them were only in their underwear, Harry took Draco’s hands in his and pinned them on both sides of his hips.
At this Harry chuckled. “Agreed. How about The Three Broomsticks?”
“Hey! I wasn’t the only one that took his time.” Even though he knew that it really took both Draco and him forever to finally figure out their feelings and gather enough courage to confess, he still felt the need to somehow defend his pride.
“Okay, let’s go.”
“Please, Harry doesn’t let Draco drink too much, he promised to take care of Teddy tomorrow. I’m having me day.” Although her tone was teasing Draco knew that she was worried about his nightmares that became more frequent.
The image of stuffy ministry officials in their perfect suits trying to gift him a tree made Harry smile. The blond looked very pleased with Harry’s reaction and began to laugh himself.
Harry and he were slowly walking back to the castle when a snowflake landed on his face. He looked up and noticed that in fact, the first snow started to fall on Hogwarts ground.
“Okay, say your peace.” Rosmerta was looking at Draco, her arms were crossed but looking at her face, she didn’t look mad.

“Where else would I be?” He smiled at the expression that the Slytherin made at him.
“Draco you know that you don’t have to do it. I know that Harry and you became friends, but you don’t have to put yourself into an uncomfortable situation just for him” He knew that she was worried, but he needed to do it.
The first trip on their schedule was going to happen on Saturday when all the other students will go to Hogsmeade they got permission to apparate to Muggle London. Last week when they left McGonagall’s office Ron and Hermione immediately cornered them and asked what is going on, after they explained Hermione started to look for events that sounded interesting. On the third day of her research, she got an owl from her parents that informed her about a gallery show in London. He didn’t know if this will be something that would interest Draco, but after the three of them told him, his face immediately lighten up and a big smile appeared on the blond's face.
“I like it and you lied it’s not too sweet.” Harry smiled at him again.
For the remaining time of the dinner, Harry couldn’t keep his eyes away from Draco. His eyes followed the blond everywhere and every time he was able to find him alone he couldn’t keep his hands to himself. Of course, Harry knew that they still needed to talk about their new developing relationship, but right now talking was the last thing he wanted to do.
Another awkward silence fell on them and this time he decided to break it. “Okay. Standing is fun but you know what is even funnier Draco?” The boy looked at him with question painting on his face. “Sitting down my legs are killing me.”
Invading someone’s mind was tricky, one mistake and the damage could be irreversible. The feeling that something like this could happen to such a young mind was devastating. She knew that the boy one again had no choice but to agree, so she had to be gentle. Immediately after she entered the boy's mind she collided with a wall. The boy was tensed. After a minute of waiting she could feel him relaxing, she noticed that the wall started to come down, slowly brick by brick, level by level so she waited. When the wall came down she expected that it would show her some unguarded memories or flashes of them, but instead, she was met with a vast forest. Minerva saw the boy standing in the middle of the crossroad just like he described it. Slowly she made her way towards him.
