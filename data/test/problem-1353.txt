“See you in Potions,” he replied as Crabbe and Goyle looked between them, trying to find out how they could possibly fill a quote for stupid (or, more likely, what quota meant).
Potter had grabbed the front of his shirt, and Draco was prepared to be punched or thrown or anything, really.
“No wonder you never get in trouble, you never get caught!”
Draco stared at the entrance. Kids shuffled in tiredly, and a bushy mane of hair caught his eye. He scowled. If Granger was here, it wouldn’t take long for Potter and Weasley to follow. What a pain. Sure enough, the three were together, Potter between them. Him and his stupid messy hair, which barely hid his stupid scar and beautiful eyes.
“No, go to Hogsmeade, have fun, bring me back something if you really want,” Harry replied, hoping his forced smile at least looked genuine. “I’m fine, guys.”
Black had done this to him. Quite literally, his very presence had brought the dementors to Hogwarts (Fudge had pushed hard to let them back into the school after Black was found in Gryffindor, but Dumbledore was resolute in his decision).But it was Sirius’s betrayal of Harry’s parents, of his best friends, that left him here, only able to hear his mother’s words when his soul was being sucked out.
“We’ll help you,” Harry said. “Anything we can.”
“No, actually. See, in wizarding households, we don’t stoop to do Muggle work. We consider it quite beneath us.”
It wasn’t so much that Draco liked boys. It was that the boy he liked was Harry freaking Potter. The only way he could do worse was by falling for a Weasley.
“I’m just asking what’s wrong!”
“Is Gryffindor done partying yet?” he asked.
He wondered, idly, what Ron did when he was off with Draco, and one day asked. “No offense, mate, but I’ve seen how Fred and George act with you, and I don’t think they’d hang out with you that much.”
Harry swallowed. “Are you?” he asked again, more calm this time.
“Yeah, bye.”
“I’d rather not get in more trouble because you broke a bone.”
“Could’ve fooled me.”
“We’re worried about you, mate,” Ron said.
“Are you okay?” Hermione asked when he fell into the open chair next to them. They were playing chess. He wasn’t great at the game by any means, or even good, but from what he could tell Ron was winning.
“That’s not what I meant,” Draco hissed, doing his best to not yell. “We’re two underage wizards and he’s literally blown people up!”
“Don’t talk about my father like that,” Draco said.
“You don’t have to.”
“It’s just… It’s not really normal, is it?”
The Gryffindor crowd was going crazy. Ravenclaw came back by 30 points. Harry was circling the pitch in tandem with Cho.
Harry walked back to his room feeling much less proud. He was tired. Sore. His head was throbbing in pain. And his mother’s voice was ringing in his ears, though he wasn’t sure he was as upset about that one.
For a few seconds Pansy didn’t reply, and Draco worried he had been too quiet. Then she asked, “Does it matter?”
“Prats,” Ron said. “I’ve been checking up on Ginny or hanging out with Seamus and Dean.”
“Blaise?” Draco snorted.
Draco nearly leapt from Harry’s lap. “Oh. I thought-”
“Well that’s awful. Light sleeper or small house?”
“How do you feel about me?”
“Maybe you were right to turn it in,” Ron admitted. “But I still think it’s a reach to murder someone with an expensive Christmas gift.”
“Fine,” Draco said in the least respectful tone he could. He nodded at Crabbe and Goyle and they turned back to their table.
He watched Potter walk away and felt a sudden conviction. He rushed to the common room and penned a quick letter, which he sent to Pansy. He could no longer keep this to himself.
“He told me he already did. He made a killing off the Hufflepuff match.”
For the love of Merlin.
“Shut the hell up.” Draco snickered.
“What do you mean?”
Lupin looked between them. “Are you two… Getting along better?”
In the dark and quiet the dungeon always provided, it was easier for intrusive thoughts to worm their way into his head. Was Potter stupid? Yes. That much was objective. Was the hero worship of him ridiculous and annoying. Yes. It was, once again, objective. Was he ugly. Yes. No. Yes. His eyes were beautiful, and his thin face had an almost innocent type of beauty to it.
Then he saw a gold glitter, and he was off.
“Well done Harry!” Lupin exclaimed, and the boggart was gone. Harry finished his chocolate bar, his head clearing but his energy gone. Lupin handed him another.
Hey all. Being fully employed takes a lot more time than I expected. I hope I didn't keep you guys too long. Thanks for sticking around and reading. Excitingly, I have finished writing this draft :) So this fic will be finished in due time. Until next time~
“Why haven’t you told any of your girl friends. Uh, your friends that are girls, I mean.”
They finished and went by the lake, enjoying the sun as Hermione reviewed her notes. “Next Hogsmeade trip is coming up soon,” Ron said.
Draco did his best to not stare back at him, mouth agape. “I’ll keep that in mind.” Blaise nodded and pulled back, and Draco watched as he made his way to arithmancy. He mulled over just how outlandish that was. There was a reason Slytherins were characterized by snakes, and it wasn’t just for their founder’s Parselmouth status. They were a group that desired success no matter the cost, and knew that exposing themselves could lead to their downfall. For Blaise to trust Draco with a history of abuse, if that was what he was implying…
“I saw a black dog, and that's it.”
“Don’t think so. She’s probably getting extra work from the other classes. Like an independent study.”
“I think I already know the answer to this, but have you ever cleaned anything in your life?” Potter was scrubbing at a large splotch inside one of his tanks.
“Should we stay here with you?” Ron asked.
“No, let’s bring him back to the common room. I think he’d rather be alone.”
He was given detention for the rest of the year. All of Gryffindor slept uneasily that night, and the rest of Hogwarts was near riotous in the morning, and Ron had turned his story into how he single handedly fought off Black, and the commotion woke everyone up. Harry and Hermione shared tired looks.
“Boys,” Lupin interjected in a warning tone. “It might help to talk instead of trying to insult each other.” Then he gave Potter a pointed look that was probably supposed to be discreet.
“Four. I couldn’t sleep. I’m too upset.”
“Could’ve fulled me.”
Potter didn’t immediately reply, and Draco rubbed his neck in a rare show of self-consciousness. “See you, then.”
“You’ve been snogging who?” Hermione asked.
“I think he could use a friend, is all, and I think you’re kind.”
“It’s fine, Ron,” Harry said.
“I don’t know,” Harry replied honestly. “I just want you all to get along better. He is my boyfriend.” Harry dropped his voice low, making sure nobody was near enough to overhear.
“Thank Merlin.”
“I’ll come with you,” Ron said, and they left without looking at Hermione.
“My dad’s not abusive,” Draco said, pushing himself away from them. “I’m not having a flashback or something. It was stupid, just like the siren or whatever the hell you saw.”
“Yeah.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco read the article she pointed out. “Another Sirius Black sighting.”
When they first arrived at Hogwarts, Draco and Pansy held each other at an arm’s distance, only interested in what they could gain from each other. Somewhere down the line Pansy had transcended all else to be something he sorely needed: a friend. Now he was scaring her off. “He thinks he’s Dumbledore’s golden boy,” Pansy said, sounding rather bored.
Harry nodded, thinking of his first broom. Something he was good at. Something people appreciated him for. “Okay.”
Draco didn’t keep him waiting long. In his hands were two bottles of butterbeer and a large cloak. At Harry’s questioning look, he admitted, “I bought it. I got cold.” He tossed a bottle to Harry, who caught it appreciatively. Draco vanished some snow from the ground, leaving a slightly damp patch of grass. Harry sat and looked to Draco, still standing over him, who blurted, “Wecouldshareifyouwant.”
The next time Ron joined, he brought his chess set and challenged Harry, who obliged to lose. “Merlin, Harry, have you ever played chess before?” Draco asked as Ron took his queen in record time.
Oberon winks.
“Uh huh,” Harry responds, blinking owlishly.
“How do I fight this ‘Mione?”
“She’s an amazing witch, Harry.
The Beta’s stop in front of their Alphas, who have turned their back to the fire to face their Betas face to face.
And Harry feels so miserable.
His body answered for him as his vision grayed at the edges and he slumped slightly, making Hermione let out a small sound of alarm before wrapping her arm around his torso and guiding him out of the classroom.
Hermione is sitting cross-leged outside where she’s set a small bonfire.
The most important thing we can do is figure out how to manipulate those impulses.”
But I’ve been acting as an emissary for the Order for the last year, so this tent has become a bit of a home to me.”
Specifically, the arm seems to be highly emotive, acting out on Ron’s otherwise well-controlled impulses.
George shifted from foot to foot for a second before nodding decisively.  “Come on Potter,” he said, grabbing Harry’s arm and pulling him closer to the exit.  The portrait had just opened up and Harry was just about to climb out when Fred’s voice sounded behind him, freezing him in his tracks.
not in active control of himself.
“Yes, no matter what, at this point I’ve doubled my time between cycles.
Harry knew he had several more, but he suspected Travers might be intentionally spreading out the introductions, to get him slowly at ease with the rest of his Coven.
“It is my wish for you that you’ll understand one day.
His expression softens.
She averts her gaze a little, staring at the pond instead of Harry.
“Oh don’t look at me like that.  I know you’re mad.  Come on, let’s have a talk before we have to meet the rest of them.”
The blonde gives him one last smile before turning on his heel and whirling away, leaving Harry feeling a little dumbstruck in his wake.
Harry nodded absently.
“Gift is a strong word for it, but it has its uses, that's certainly true.”
“Betas, you may approach,” Fred said after the last loaf has turned to ash.  The vast majority of the crowd surges forward to approach their individual Alpha - while some Alphas may be without a Coven, like Nott, there are no such Betas.
Motions her to sit.
Harry looks around.
The Healers kept him the night for observation but he sent word this morning that he’s been discharged and he’s decided to head home and spend the rest of the holidays with some of the rest of the Coven.
“I think you’re going to need to be a little more clear about what you’re asking me, Hermione.”
“And enough is enough.”
Harry nodded.  “Alright.”
But they had all survived the rest of the holiday and to all appearances it looked as though the twins’ relationship was back on the right track.
To be so young and yet old enough to fully understand what you had lost.
“I think I love you,” Harry tells his friend seriously, already ripping the first one open and discarding the card for ‘Albus Dumbledore’ with disinterest - like he doesn’t already have a million of those.  Ron’s already left to saunter down the table and whisper in his brother’s ear.  George has turned to appraise Harry and gives the younger boy a reassuring wink when their eyes meet.
Harry shivers at the tone, not fighting himself when he feels the urge to tilt his head to the side, revealing more of his neck to the Alpha.
“Belle is an extremely strong empath,” Oberon tells them, very quietly, and with more than one fervent glance around.
Arthur is at the head of the table, looking wan and tired, although Molly is no where to be seen, and as soon as Harry is awake enough to put two words together, he turns to him, “How’s Bill?”
Ron closes the magazine, places its beside him and leans forward to rest his elbows on his knees, looking at them both somberly.
McGonagall, who had been summoned to give the group approval to depart, eyes the group speculatively.
Your mum has a point.
Having grown up an orphan, he’s always yearned for close family of his own.
Wouldn’t want one’s robe to fall apart in the middle of an important ball.”
“Nott,” Malfoy purrs, voice low and dangerous.  “I think we should perhaps return this Omega to his Alpha, wouldn’t you agree?”
“An Omega?” Harry asked, somewhat dazed and also feeling suddenly exhausted, eyes drooping as he struggled to maintain eye contact with his friend.
Or were you too busy being mad at me for making you look bad that you didn’t catch that part?”
Harry shoots a look back to his friends, but they seem completely engaged in conversation with Leo, Ron laughing brightly at something the Alpha had just said.
About ten minutes in, he turns away from the action to see Oberon gazing at him studiously.
Hermione leans towards him  - he hadn’t managed to back up very far and for a second Harry is afraid, afraid in a way he never could have conceived of being afraid of Hermione.  Then her hand comes up and passes his face to settle on the back of his neck.  Harry’s mind goes blank.  He can still take in his surroundings - he can see Hermione in front of him, feel her hand heavy on his neck, but he can barely move his limbs - it’s like moving through molasses and he doubts he could speak if he tried.  He’s glad he’s already sitting, because he doubts his legs could hold him.
“Yea, I thought that whole scene in the Common Room was particularly weird.  What does George think about all this?”
In spite of her light tone, there’s an edge of bitterness to her words.
“You heard me,” Hermione responds, unperturbed.  “You’re an Omega, everyone is interested in you.  Alphas are going to want to court you, Betas are going to want to recruit you to their own Coven.  The stronger our Coven is perceived by the rest in the school, the more respectful will be the advances, and the more leverage we will have in considering them.”
Ron shakes his head, slumping to lean against the wall, arms crossed and eyes closed.
“Always over much too quickly!”
“I understand your sentiment, Omega Weasley,” Nott says smoothly, “but surely you could at least see what we’ve come to offer first-“
Harry nods, curiosity and an urge to ask so many more questions pressing on him, but he suppresses his desire for both the sake of propriety and compassion for Arthur who looks like he could use a little of that right now.
“And what? You just go around business as normal?”
When Harry receives a letter would with a bright red bow over Breakfast, he is initially just perplexed.  When Ron nearly chokes on his potatoes next to him after catching sight of the letter though, he quickly becomes mortified after the redhead recovers and explains that Harry has just received a courting proposal.
When…when they died, I knew I had to save the last one for you.
“And if they are able to get their hands on our necks, we sink like a stone.
Either way, George keeps sneaking little glances at it and grimacing so Harry thinks there’s more than enough guilt to go around.
“You’re a lifesaver, Bones,” George tells her appreciatively.  Harry’s not really following the interaction, currently eyeing the candy just out of reach of where he’s sat and clearly debating ignoring George’s advice.
Harry didn’t know what to say.
He knows it was just a suggestion, but Fred’s words seem to carry weight with Harry’s frazzled mind and he is wandering around the castle before he realizes that he’s actually looking for Hermione.  Like an idiot.  She told him she had an errand.
To their collective surprise, the Headmaster is not occupying his office.
I didn’t know that the emotion had manifested nor that it had chosen a target.
They all chuckled lightly, Harry smirked a little in response, rolling his eyes a little when he caught Ron’s gaze.
“Yea, about that George…” Harry started. “I was hoping you could help me out here a little, I hear male Omegas are somewhat rare.”
I know - that got intense in parts there!  There are parts of this that are world-building and parts of this that are incredibly important to the plot.  This story seems to have gotten away from me a bit and has branched how far beyond what I had originally expected.   I appreciate everybody's comments and I hope you enjoyed the chapter!
“Harry,” Hermione said, looking him straight in the eyes.  “I have something that must be done.  It cannot wait.  Usually Alphas introduce their Omegas to their Covens right away and also explain a little more about what you can expect as a newly presented Omega, but I have no choice but to postpone that until I return from my task.  Can you be patient with me?”
The night of the Ball finally approached.  The Halloween Ball, which they would attend beforehand, was a casual affair, but the Coven Ball required more careful attire.  Harry met with the other Omegas to primp and preen - Merlin, he felt like a girl - and to dress in his deep emerald dress robes.  In pride of place on all of the Omegas robes - each sported a shining omega pendant.  Harry always wore his of course, but sometimes he opted to keep it inside his outer robes, hanging on a chain or just affixed to his shirt instead of his robes.  Today though, it was made clear to him that it was important that he wore it openly and proudly.
If we have any hope of defeating them, we must form an international coalition to fight them and everything they stand for.
“Thanks, Harry.  She doesn’t talk about them a lot, but I know they meant a lot to her.  I think its why she’s a little er…obsessive about her children.”
(See the end of the chapter for
She’s pale herself now, eyes blown wide in fear, and there’s a tremble in her hand where it rests on George’s arm.
“Sideways is fine,” he tells her calmly.  “We’ll get there in the end, and if we don’t we’ll try again some other time.”
Harry, who had been assiduously avoiding meeting George’s eyes during this conversation that had turned from friendly to unexpectedly completely awkward, couldn’t help but to let his startled gaze fly up at that.  George scratched his head and looked off to the side.
“What is it, Harry?” the Alpha asks, voice smooth as silk.
Harry steps closer to Terry and then guides the three of them away from the entrance to the Tower, to a place not quite so obvious to anyone walking by.
There’s a net on either end and both teams try to kick a ball into each other’s nets.
“Oh, that’s terrible business!” Harry remarked, appalled.
When he rises he has a gift in his hand, gold packaging wrapped in a red bow.
He loved his time at the Burrow (for the most part, at least), but he had missed the calming effect being around so many Omegas provided.
Oberon shakes his head sadly.
“Anyway,” Hermione interjects, “you said that’s not the point of this conversation.
“This is
In addition to Leo, Travers had also brought along two of his Betas.
Hermione and Ron step forward and Harry steps back to let them get through their greetings.
“Merlin Ron, does he actually think I would do something so inane?”
Mum scanned Fred and George, sent me up here with George and Flooed Angelina…”
“I guess you better tell me the rest of it,” Harry finally says.
Mum was trying to talk him down, I think, standing between Fred and him.
“Part of me.
“Alphas are the head of our way of life,” Fred continues.  “They are the protectors of our traditions.  In days of old, as now, we offer this bread to our ancestors to nourish them in the way they nourish us with their example and legacy.”
“Mating!” Harry squeaked. “Mating?”
Susan looks dazed, and she’s letting out low, pleading whimpers.  Omega sounds, Harry thinks absently, though he’s not really sure that’s a thing.  Smith pulls on her hair so she’s forced up higher on her knees and leans down just slightly to whisper menacingly in her ear, “Mine now, bitch.”
“No,” he snaps curtly.
He’s not alone in the class - but he is the oldest.  The other three students are all 6th years - two Hufflepuff Betas, a Slytherin Beta, and a Hufflepuff Alpha that Harry instantly takes a disliking to.  The Alphas name is Joel Stebbins and he leers at Harry like the cat who found the cream when they both sit down in the classroom where they were asked to gather for their first lesson.
It won’t last forever, but … well, it should be enough.”
Harry shrugged.  “Seems like I just have to wait it out.  I’ve been talking to the other Omegas and they all told me they had their first cycles within six weeks of presenting.  Of course, we’ll have to wait for the second season to figure out what my cycle is.  Really hoping I don’t have to experience what Susan goes through.”
“Of course,” the blonde replies, “but I’ve a question for you, as well.”
“Full house,” Susan muses.  “You’ll both need the help and Emma and Polly have that Herbology test coming up.  I only have classes until mid-afternoon, so I’ll come back and we’ll assess.  If I have to miss Potions tomorrow morning, I don’t think that’ll be too much of a problem.”
“Look, I’m not saying you’re necessarily more likely than any other Alpha to go into Fight, but we’d be stupid to not prepare for the possibility or to try to figure out a way to avoid the possibility.
“Look, Harry, I know I owe you an explanation but what I had to do couldn’t wait, okay?”
Fred had been much more circumspect in displaying and acting on his Alpha impulses in the days since and George had looked more relaxed and open than Harry had seen in some time.
“Shhh, shhh, it’s okay Har,” Ron smooths running a hand up and down his back.  “It’s over now.  Here’s Hermione.”
His pleasure seems to diminish somewhat but he takes it in stride.
“‘Course,” Harry agrees, readily, happy to have some way he can help out.
Fred had asked Angelina to return home to her family as the danger had passed, and the pair had spent much of their time since in each other’s company.
Aside from the World Cup, Harry’s never attended a professional Quidditch match before.
She tugs her hand away from him, turns her head away shyly, not willing to meet his gaze any longer.  “I didn’t know he could be like that.  He’s been cold sometimes, but I thought he was just, I don’t know, shy?  I don’t think I loved him, but I liked him well enough and I’m just….Harry I’m just so tired of these seasons.  I’m exhausted.  The promise of it calming down, well, I was willing to put up with a lot.  But not…a day before your season started, Zacharias formally asked me to Bond.  Ernie was ecstatic.  So happy for both of us, but he told Zacharias that we should wait the whole length of the Formal Consideration before making it official. When I saw the premonition, my grandmother’s warnings came back to me.  I knew immediately what it was. Today I told Ernie I wouldn’t go through with it.  He was so confused, he didn’t understand.  But Ernie’s been my friend for forever.  He would never push me to do something I don’t want to do.  He said he’d tell Zacharias the answer was no.  Coming from Ernie, that should be enough.”
What are we waiting for?”
I…sometimes I just hate being Omega.”
But he’s been a Second in a Coven without an Omega and he’s only been around Fleur for a few months.
Harry quirks an eyebrow at him, but Travers doesn’t notice, merely resuming their slow walk, this time towards the Great Hall.
Hermione’s gaze softened as she locked eyes with him, reaching out the grasp his hand gently.  “Ron is my Second, Harry.  And my Sponsor is Mrs. Weasley.  I am an Alpha and as your closest Alpha friend, you are expected to join my Coven, which is why Madame Pomfrey is letting me stay with you right now.  The COA is the Council of Omega Affairs, and if they are sending a representative to talk to you, I would prefer if Mrs. Weasley is present to provide me guidance.  I’ve never registered an Omega before. ”
sorry.”
But not in the way that so many of them seem to want.
“Potter’s fine where he is,” Nott responds gruffly.
I don’t want to talk about
Ron frowned, “PDA?”
“It’s an unfortunate circumstance.
Harry holds up a hand.
I would like to call upon you again soon.”
Paired with the fact that it’s effects are fleeting, well…it’s not in common distribution.
Rather expecting it, Harry prepares himself for the owl to land in front of Hermione, but to everyone’s consternation, the owl instead lands directly in front of Fred, holding out the courting proposal imperiously.
“Maybe she can find a Healer to be on standby and we only will reach out if it gets bad?”
“It’s not…he’s not…I mean,” Harry says, eloquently.
Shrugging, the other Alpha rises and skirts around the trio in the small space, before exiting the same way Fleur and Harry came in. Distantly, Harry feels gratitude because while he may trust Bill, Fred has made too many decisions recently that have worried him.
The smarter play would probably have been to think on it a little.
Harry sighs into the touch, comforted by the warmth.
“What happened?” he demands of Ron, hand gripping George’s, instinctively wishing for contact with the other Omega.
When he’s done, he frowns at Hermione.
There’s parts of our world that you’re still learning, that your brothers have a better handle on.
He brushed against Malfoy at the ingredients table, who reached out to steady him when Harry stumbled.  Malfoy had been on much better behavior since they had begun their seventh year; although by no means friendly, he had stopped taunting Harry and his friends at every available opportunity and seemed to be working off a goal of just ignoring them as much as possible instead.
“No,” Hermione shook her head.  “There are others of course, two in America, two in China, one in Africa; a few more spread out across the world.  But the Wizarding population has been in a slow decline a long time.  Its part of why Voldemort has been able to arouse so much pureblood support.  His followers aren’t just disgusted by muggles, they’re afraid of them.  Muggle have 2, 3, more children whereas most pureblood families max out at 1 or 2.”
“I won’t let you bully him anymore.
“Huh,” Harry hums.
“Olive can speak for herself,” the girl snaps, tossing the book she had clearly not been focusing on onto the table irritably.
We're in this together, always have been."
Harry, I’m going to catch Hermione up - they probably slept through the whole thing out in the tents.
In some ways, he thinks the pain must have been worse.
“I guess you better tell me if there is any decorum I need to follow,” Harry says eventually.
But Bill’s not looking at him anymore anyway, completely caught up in Fleur again, and the older man waves him off.
The redhead opened his mouth clearly curious as to why his normally calm friend looked so fiercely irate, but wisely held his tongue when Harry shook his head and charged down the hall ahead of him, leading the way to the Great Hall.
“In the meantime,” Susan continues, glancing up at George and Harry, “let’s have everybody start speaking with their Professors.
“Let’s talk to Madam Pomfrey?” Susan suggests, voice tentative.
It’s good that the un-Presented are so rare.”
Harry smiles a little, but manages to duck his eyes in an attempt to gain a little composure.
“It’s only Padma and George this month,” Susan says.
We need to all be on the same side.
Which …. oh gosh, this whole situation should be incredibly awkward shouldn’t it?
“It went well though?
Dean nods passively, not showing much interest either way.  It’s a smart move on Hermione’s part.  Dean is significantly calmer than Seamus, and he and Zabini have always been friendly, much to the consternation of Seamus.  Seamus and Luna will make an odd pair, but Luna’s oddness paired with her loyalty to Hermione can probably serve to disrupt any shenanigans Seamus may wish to start.   Luna can be strange, but she’s always had a good head on her shoulders and he and his friends have always trusted her.
“Speaking of which,” Ron interjected.  “We let the word spread a bit about your refusal of Boot’s proposal, Harry.  I think you’ll get a break until after your first heat, at least.”
“You and Hermione have different strategies.
Harry hadn’t even considered that.
“Thank you,” Harry said faintly, struck a little dumb by this barrage of information he didn’t fully understand.
Bill was coming around but Dad says there’s no messing with head wounds, so they’d better get it cleared with the Healers.
I was mortified, but fortunately no one made me feel bad about it; Most people, at least on this side of the Pond, know about and understand the nature of my family’s inheritance.
“Thank you, mate.”
“Er, look mate, I’m a bit busy right now, yea?  Be seeing you.”
“Yes, Alpha,” George sighed, gathering himself back up.  He shot a wink at Harry and shuffled over to where Angelina was glaring at him.  Fred turned to Harry, “Please tell your Alpha that while we respect her pace, it does pose some…inconveniences.”
Harry grimaces, he’s not used to that kind of attention, it’s uncomfortable after the kind of upbringing he’d had with the Dursleys.
“Sleeping draught?”
They all tiptoe around the elephant in the room.
Harry laughs even as he turns to catch Ron’s celebratory embrace, the Beta having been so invested in the game that he hadn’t participated in the conversation.
I’ve been speaking to many of the different kingdoms of magical beings but also to other Covens - some who agree with us, others who wonder if the Dark Lord might have a point. I try to convince them otherwise.”
“Why is George passed out?” Harry questions.
I thank you for your compassion.
Harry hadn’t heard much about the Arrows but he’d been privy to Ron’s obsessive patronage of the Cannon’s for years and had never seen them play live.
“For most of my life, my grandmother refused to tell me what happened.  It was only after I presented that she told me the whole story.   She was worried, you see.  My great-Oma, he had a very rare gift.  A permutation of the Sight,” she pauses, eyes Harry askance.  “I assume you’re familiar?”
Harry nods, and gets to his feet, reaching a hand down to help Fleur to hers.
“I would never seriously hurt you!
George is an Omega in Fred's Coven, and he was standing right there…”
His face morphs into a slow, deliberate smile.
“It’s amazing Mrs. Weasley. Really. I love it.”
“Weren’t we just talking about Fleur and Bill this morning?
They’re barely
are you sorry
Harry nods his head vigorously, in complete agreement.
I’ve been with him ever since.”
But when you’re an Omega, sometimes you have to take what you can get.
Harry crinkles his brow, moved by the sincerity of Oberon’s words but still not sure what he was forgiving them both for.
I think there’s an innocent explanation,” he says.
She looks down and her voice is quiet, but gruff when she replies, in a light Scottish burr.
“Potter,” Nott said, eyes gazing intensely into Harry’s.
Nott looks at Hermione and Fred but neither of them do anything to either validate or deny the decisions of the Omegas of their Covens.
Grasping for his wand as he fights for awareness, he notes George is absent from their shared space but Fleur is rousing just like he is, hurriedly wrapping a sweater around her lean form and brandishing a wand of her own.
Harry forgets about Fleur entirely, instantly fretting over George’s still figure as Ron lowers him onto his bed, eyes sweeping over his form looking for injury.
“Look,” she says, pacing in front of the fireplace, “I’ve talked about this with Mrs. Weasley some.  Every Coven has their own initiation for each of the ranks - whether we’re inviting in a Beta, an Alpha Sub, or an Omega.  Everyone brings their individual strengths to the Coven and thus we grow stronger as a collective.  When we brought in Luna - she was our last Beta to join, Harry - what we swore to each other was that as long as we’re a Coven, we treat each other as family.
Ron nods.
“Yeah mate, go on, I’ll see you in a bit.”
Thankfully, there are so few Omegas at Hogwarts that they all have a bit of a break until Susan’s next Season in early November, so they’re all able to catch up on some schoolwork.  The Professors were very accommodating to the Omegas but they didn’t relax their scholastic expectations, so they all had more than enough work to complete.
“I…erm…yeah, I feel a lot better actually,” Harry admits, face flushed red and not really able to meet Bill’s eyes.
Harry reaches out, rests his own hand atop hers.
Travers claps his hands.
“And to you?”
Burbage looked somber.  “A tragedy,” she said, “Rare thank Merlin, but a tragedy to any to whom such a fate befalls.  Many choose to leave the Wizarding World altogether.  Others languish in obscurity, unable to bond to Covens as Wizards must.  All of the un-Presented have also proven completely infertile.”
“Don’t need a babysitter,” Harry grumbles but it’s half-hearted protest.  Ron isn’t listening anyway, groping around in his book bag until he finds what he’s looking for and hands it to Harry with a triumphant, “Ah ha!”  It’s a set of a half-dozen chocolate frogs.
“It was very thoughtful of you to arrange this.”
“Yes,” Harry nodded, looking her in the eye.  He wonders if he’s misjudged her, he can tell she means every word of that. The others all nod at her and gave quiet affirmations, even Stebbins though his expression had turned a little sour.
Flour shuffles closer, pressing the heat of her body against Harry’s side and letting go of his hand to swing an arm around him instead.
Hermione doesn’t come to see Harry that night, and it’s a weekend, so Harry lounges around the Tower, not really wanting to go out in the castle when he's so short on information.  Ron seems to support this decision and aside from a quick trip to the kitchens to pick up some food, he’s stayed with Harry in the boy’s dorm.  But now its almost dinner time, and Ron lets him know that he wants to take a quick trip the the library (the library, really Ron! Harry thinks, wondering how much under Hermione’s heel the Beta is).  So Harry wanders down to the Common Room alone, bored of being in the boy’s dorm.
Harry has the occasion to compare the next day, when Susan has recovered and has fled back to Hufflepuff to try to catch herself back up.  By this time George has moved from Pre-Season to full, but his is slated to last a full 3 days.  Padma is taking the first six hour shift of his season with him, and when Harry goes in for the second shift, he finds George feverish and disgruntled, but still able to carry on a conversation with Harry, a marked difference from Susan six hours in.  George crankily tells him, that his season builds slowly and that by the following afternoon he’ll likely be as out of his mind with it as Susan was until he peaks the following day.
“I got your em…proposal,” Harry said.  “To be honest, Boot, I didn’t really think you were interested in me like that, or y’know, at all really?”
“Isn’t it?” Fleur questions lightly. “We have our logical, rational minds and then we have our biological impulses, that we can’t control no matter how much we try.”
“Tell me about yourself,” Travers says.
It seems like there the response might be tied to protective instincts for an Omega that the Alpha feels responsible for.
“Can’t tell you too much without your Alpha’s permission mate,” George’s voice was light but he didn’t look Harry in the eyes, instead skimming the book in his hands.
He has every appearance of a man exhausted by circumstances beyond his understanding.
“Uh,” Harry coughs.  “Actually, I really would like to track down Hermione, so if the two of you would just excuse me….”
Dumbledore smiled at him, clearly pleased that he didn’t sound angry.  “Yes, of course.  Covens are at the very heart of how the adult Wizarding World operates.  All presented Wizards join Covens which are formulated around a Coven leader — someone who has presented Alpha, such as your friend Miss Granger.  Coven leaders are almost always Alphas, though there have been rare cases of Betas taking the lead when something has happened to the Alpha founder.  An Alpha, like Miss Granger, will then seek out Betas to fill the ranks of her Coven, and will select a Second, usually her most trusted Beta, like your Mr. Weasley.  The sizes of Covens vary wildly and largely depend on the strength of the Alpha as a leader but also have something to do with whether or not they are able to attract an Omega.
The holiday progresses as well as it can given the circumstances.
He spares a moment to cheer before turning his attention back to his suitor.
Harry can’t even imagine cycling that long.
“Something for next time then, Harry,” Hermione says lightly.
There’s a pit that plants itself firmly in his stomach.
And your Hermione - she’s very strict with herself, works hard to keep her emotions under control, exceptions not withstanding.
Whether we like it or not, I’m going to be involved.
“Alright,” Bill says, quirking his finger at Harry imperiously who finds himself drifting over to stand in front of him without making a conscious decision to move.
"I get it ok?
Instantly, Fred’s scent turns sour and George groans.
Harry blushes at the care but Oberon takes no notice, caught in thought as he is.
And I want a strong, loving partner to do that with.
“Have you been to Hogwarts before?” he inquires.
Her voice is steadier when she speaks again, if tentative.
Padma is no help in the matter, when Harry corners her during George’s season.
“No,” the Omega says, voice sharp.
Of Harry’s newly acquired interest in Alphas, Malfoy did seem to attract the most attention.  But that didn’t make Harry immune from other Alphas.  While none, including Malfoy, had directly approached him, Harry noticed increased attention from Macmillian, Nott, and Boot, and Hermione told him curtly that his scent had sharpened after his first Season, and all of the Alphas knew exactly what that meant.  That was simultaneously thrilling and terrifying to Harry, who fought down any reaction at all at the news and just gave his friend a shrug.
Padma by far has the longest season, followed by George, whose season lasts three full days and then Harry at 60 hours.
Floo’s open.
“Officially, we’re allied with Fred’s Coven,” she said when they had all gathered out on the Quidditch Pitch during a calm Saturday morning.  She was pacing in front of where they all sat sprawled on bleachers, in the more open space before the bleachers dropped off to leave visibility to the Pitch.  Ron was looking uncommonly serious, though Harry suspected that was more to impress his girlfriend than because of anything she was about to say.  Luna is manipulating some sort of shimmering ball of light that she’s miraculously kept from Hermione’s sight.  Every time the Gryffindor Alpha turns away, the light reappears in one of the Ravenclaw Beta’s hands and jumps around her in excited circles until Hermione turns back in her direction.  Harry’s not quite sure how she’s doing it, but the spectacle has caught his, Dean and Seamus’ attention, and they all keep sending each other incredulous looks every time it happens.  Luna, for her part, appears completely innocent, and pays no attention to the light when it appears.
She sets the vial down, pushes it over to Harry.
He’s fighting opposing emotions of ire at his potential courting partner’s protracted silence, relief that one way or another, at least now it seems he’ll be getting some answers, and anxiety as to what those answers may be.
Harry’s frustration cools in the face of this explanation, and out of respect for Ron’s level-headed strategic thinking.
“Cooling off,” the redhead says quietly.
“You’re a more forgiving man, than I,” Harry tells him.
“Have you noticed that Wizards don’t have that many children?” Hermione asked, leaning back on her elbows and gazing out over the lake.
These trials are not without risks, but I’m afraid the alternative is not compelling.
“Dumbledore and I have been meeting for the last few months to discuss what would happen when you presented,” she said, gazing calmly over the lake, not turning her head to look at Harry.  “I know that probably is not something you wanted to hear, but Stricture wouldn’t have let us talk about this with you and its something that needed to be discussed.  The laws in the Wizarding World can be … archaic.  If you had presented an Alpha, there wouldn’t have been much of an issue.” She pauses and this time does turn her head to smile at him.
“Fine.”
“Ten galleons on you. I had a feeling you’d win.”
He couldn’t stomach much at breakfast. Pansy sat beside him and didn’t bring up anything from their conversation, which was good considering he was sitting with Crabbe and Goyle. He looked over a Potions essay as he twirled his fork in his fingers. “Check out the paper,” Pansy said, handing him the copy of the Daily Prophet she had been reading.
Pansy couldn’t look at Hermione as she replied, “You’re right. But why not go after Potter first?”
They sat there for a few minutes. Pansy and Blaise were likely looking in Hogwarts to tell them they had failed. The sun set began to set, and, finally, Harry stood up. “Let’s get back, then,” he said, his voice hollow.
“Yeah. Then we never have to hang out again.”
“Thank Merlin he doesn’t speak up in class as much as Granger.”
“Would you, like date him?”
He was working on a Charms essay when Blaise sat across from him. “Are you going to talk to Pansy?” he whispered, conscious of Madam Pince lurking a few shelves down.
*looks around, left to right, like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction* So.... Been a while. Listen, I'm the fool for thinking I could be productive in my writing projects in a global pandemic in my senior year of college. Thanks for sticking around, y'all. Hopefully I'll be back sooner this time around, though that feels like a jinx. Until next time~
But he blanked when Harry kissed him.
Alone, Lupin seemed more relaxed. “I’m glad that you reached out and became his friend. That can be the most important part of someone’s life. Thank you, Harry. I’m proud.”
All this because Harry Potter chose to go to another school... What a shame for Albus Dumbledore's plans.
“Malfoy has a good chance to become the Beauxbâtons champion, but the one witht he most chances is his friend Lilianne Lacoursière. She is the most skilled and the valedictorian of her year for the last four years. As for Malfoy's best subject, it would be languages and potions. Beauxbâtons doesn't have a Head Boy or Head Girl; they have Year Councils.”
Harry passed all his OWLS. He had nothing but O's and EE's on his tests; he obtained perfect and special mentions in Duelling. He even defeated Grindelwald's record and had a trophy to his name (Grindelwald's was finally removed and put aside). However, it was Runes where Harry truly shined. He received an offer to start his mastery at the start of the summer. To celebrate his nephew's accomplishment, Rose payed for her nephew to spend at least three weeks in South America to learn about the Mayan Runes. Seeing all theses new runes and ways of life, Harry decided to travel the world and learn as much about the runes and the cultures who created them.
Thankfully, an old friend from school had offered her a job for a very good company. Imagine her surprise when that company turned out to be MI-7. As it turned out, MI-5 was the known secret service that everyone and their grandma’s knew about, MI-6 and their James Bonds were for global supervillains, and MI-7 dealt with the ICW and the Unmentionables of the Ministry of Magic. Their job was to offer a muggle perspective, aid and technology in order to help maintain and protect the Statute of Secrecy. Due to the fact that Rose was the sister of a muggleborn, had military experience and was a formidable soldier, MI-7 had invited her to work with them.
of November of 1981, when Petunia opened the door of her house to find her fifteen months old nephew on her porch like a bottle of milk. She honestly couldn't understand who would leave a child like this in the middle of the night without so much as thicker blanket or even ringing the door bell to explain what was going on. Who in the world announced that one sister, along with her husband, was now dead at the hand of a terrorist and that their nephew was the only protection they had against the madman and it's follower?
Distraught at their son's pain and sorrow, Lucius and Narcissa, despite not caring much for their son's friends (and that's putting it midly), had called them forth and asked for their help in getting their Dragon out of his depression. It took all summer to cheer him up and it was only the thought of facing the entire school once September arrived that forced Draco to put on his Pureblood mask. The Malfoy family was strong and cowered under no pressure; he would not allow himself to be seen as a poor, weak and broken soul over some stupid cad who sucked in bed.
``Yeah... wha... Who's this?'' asked a sleepy and tired voice on the other side of the line.
Once more, the cup burst into blue flames and spew out another piece of parchment. This time it was Madame Maxime who deftly caught the name, much to Dumbledore’s ire at being upstaged.
“There!” shouted a small third year Hufflepuff, pointing to the sky as a powder blue carriage made it's way towards them.
Surprisingly, the man did not focus solely on Harry. He gave the same amount of attention to all three champions and showed no animosity towards anyone aside from Dumbledore. He did not fawn over Harry as Bagman did nor tried to get Harry alone with him like Dumbledore. In fact, he and Leeman were the only two British officials who showed any professionalism. They treated all champions with respect and equally.
This year was the OWLs year for Draco, Marco and Lilianne. Which meant that they had to work their butt off studying. They couldn't afford any distraction as the next year was their NEWTs. The french school had their OWLS during the sixth year as oppose to the other school who did it a year earlier. Draco wasn't worried, he had worked hard since the beginning and was no fool or slouch. He knew he would get good grades so long as he had discipline and worked hard. If only the same could be said for half of his year. For some reason, the purebloods never really put much efforts into their educations; they didn't see the point since their parents were either rich or could get them into any department of their choice in the government. However, during the summer, a new President of the Magical French Republic, who believed that one should get in on their own merits and skills, rather than their families or wealth, was voted in and all the purebloods who had passed by the skin of their necks the past five years were now frantic in their bid to get good grades. The other half of the year worked even harder to make sure that these lazy, bigoted and spoiled moronic incompetents never made it to power; the country was already doing poorly, no need to make it worse with theses fools at the helm. So everyone studied and worked hard.
''I think I made my choice. I'll go to Durmstrang! I'll learn what I need to know and do my best. Thanks for being there for me!'' said the little boy as he hugged his uncle almost to death.
plaque for his bravery and his leadership; which gave him entry to a higher position into the Ministry than he could have ever hoped for. Which reflected well on Arthur to have three brave and heroic sons who were far more clever than they appeared; he even managed to have a special internship in the Departement of Mysteries for the twins. Ronald and Molly were the only ones that didn't profit from this whole situation. Ronald never had a single friend aside from Hermione Granger (she was the type of girl who needed to feel superior and better than others at all time and chosed a stupid and lazy boy as her friend and later on her boyfriend to feel better about herself), his grades were abysmal at best, he constantly got into fights and was generally a bully. Molly never got any money to take in and seduce Harry, she never got to trick the boy into liking her and her precious daughter, Ginny.
Harry knew exactly who the Minister was the second he saw him. His aunt and uncles had researched everywhere to find as much information about Voldemort as they could. Knowledge was power and the more you knew about your enemies, the better you could prepare, fight and win your battles. He knew the man shaking his hand was the man who had murdered his parents. However, as said previously, knowledge is power. The less Voldemort knew about Harry’s own knowledge, the easier it would be for him to fight the man.
The second, would be the Weasleys. Since Draco wasn't going to Hogwarts, Lucius would never have to go to Diagon Alley in the Summer of 1992, thus never giving the diary of Tom Riddle to Ginny and having it destroyed (which saved him from the Dark Lord's wrath later on). Also, without Harry Potter, the twins would keep the Marauders map in 1993 and discover Peter Pettigrew posing as Scabbers, thus clearing Sirius Black's name and earning three thousand galleons each from the man for their help in his release. Even Percival got something out of it, when, on Halloween night 1991, his youngest brother insulted the muggle-born Granger, he was the one who noticed she was missing and rushed to get the kids into the common room, sent a warning to the teachers and got to the bathroom on time before the troll killed the poor little girl. He received a
Dressed in his finest and best parade red robes of Durmstrang, footed with his shiniest and best dragonhide boots, perfectly coiffed hair that had his bangs brought back by a thin black elastique headband, Heir Hadrian James Potter-Black-Vaux-de-Villers looked imposing and the perfect image of a young lord who was ready to grab onto the opportunities that life offered and own the world. His composed demeanor and his easy smile made him instantly well-liked and approachable. The young wizard was polite, charming and warm to all those who wished to conversed with him, especially when he never discriminated against race, gender, financial or social or blood status. He was easily becoming one of the most popular guest of the party.
The preparations were made quickly and efficiently to arrive as soon as possible. And while each of them were excited for various reasons, they all knew that the battles coming ahead would be daunting and very difficult. They would face the challenges ahead and the ugliness of the British with their heads held high and show the English just what they were made of.
So now, all that was left was Ilvermony, Durmstrang and Beauxbaton. Despite the fact that the french school had steadily improved under Madam Maxime and his uncle Alexander's supervision, it was still not up to Harry's standards. In the last decade, his uncle had invested in the school like never a Vaux De Villiers had ever done before. Gone were the classes filled with nothing but boring and useless subjects like Reception planning, gone were the incompetent teachers like the ones in Defense and Transfigurations, gone were the useless expenses like the chandelier maid (have a damn house-elf do it or give it as a detention to a student, for France's sake! Had said uncle Alexander). The students had more sports, better rounded classes, strict guidelines and expectations from and for students, there were new rules and precautions put in place to prevent any sorts of teacher-student intimite relationships (which was a good thing considering that more than one teacher were found to have illigitemite children with past or current students). However, there was still some progress to be made in the duelling department.
During that time, Rose had travelled throughout Europe and had gotten many contacts as part of her job, one of which was Alexander Vaux-De-Villiers. They had met in the French town of Lyon, when an imbecile had had the
With this Rose left 4 Privet Drive in Little Whining in Surrey to never return.
Harry made his way down to his aunt's personal armerie; he was sure that she would love to screw with the Ministry and Dumbledore. She never was a fan of either of them. The little boy wished he could see the Minister's and the Headmaster's faces when they found out he wasn't going to Hogwarts...
“Of course, the first years are shadowed by the seventh years to show them how it's done and help them understand the responsibilities and duties that come with being a student of Beauxbâtons Academy. The French believe deeply in a sense of community and doing one's civil service. Everyone has to pitch in when it comes to raising funds, keeping the dormrooms clean, keeping up the various projects and activities that they participate in.”
''Yes.''
has been the main vessel of the Headmaster of the school and it's lieutenant is the leader of the Elite. It's a huge honor for them and they take it very seriously! My cousin, Ricardo, messed with the leader of the Elite and lost half of our fortune because of it. Thankfully, the bloke had just wanted his friend's father's company and not the rest.” explained Blaise to the gathered crowd that made it's way to the Great Hall.
Thank you for your time and enjoy!
Once seated, she noticed that the Beauxbâtons delegation was sitting with the Ravenclaws, while the Durmstrang delegation with the Slytherins. Looking down the table, she spotted Zabini with his best-friend Theodore Nott and one Durmstrang student. She couldn't believe her eyes as she paled. There sitting next to Zabini and greeting everyone of the snakes warmly and with a million watt smile was the one, the only... Harry James Potter.
Petunia believed that Rose should found herself a husband a quit this silly business of a job; the bitter older sister thought that women should be satisfied with a house, a husband and kids. She honestly could not understand her sister's ambitions to be more than housewives and mothers. Rose could not understand why, with all the brain that Petunia had, she would settle with less than what she could be.
of trying to create an army of inferies and kidnapping muggle children. One of the worst missions Rose had ever done in her life to this day. The few good thing coming out of this whole ordeal had been the arrest of the fool, the eradication of what could possibly have been the start of a zombie apocalypse and the friendship between Rose and Alexander. Inferie’s bites were not contagious; however, the idiot had managed to make his corpse’s bites infectious and had botched up the control matrix that allowed him to control his creations. It was stuff of nightmares.
“Harry, I know that pureblood etiquette says we shouldn’t be hiding like this, but this is really serious and Hogwarts has too many ears. I pulled you in here to warn you to be careful. Albus Dumbledore is after you and your money! He’s been colluding with my mother, brother Ron and his girlfriend, Hermione, for years now. It’s bad, Harry!”
The authorities tracked Rose and Marjorie to see which one could take in Dudley. Rose couldn't as she was living with magicals and Dudley was a muggle who knew nothing of magic. Marjorie could and wanted to take in Dudley; she was rather adamant about it and proclaimed that only a Dursley woman could raise Dudley properly. The two women agreed on Dudley's placement, however, they argued tooth and nails on who was going to pay the funeral. Marjorie believed that since Rose was so rich and that she had to raise Dudley that the new Madame Vaux De Villiers should pay for the ceremony and the price wasn't cheap!
Rose Evans was quite peculiar. At the tender age of 7 years old, Rose entered the Royal Military Academy. There she learned how to be a soldier for ten years; then, she enrolled in the Royal Navy of her Majesty for 2 years before being discharged for being wounded during battle. Since then, Rose has been working as a private consultant for a protection company. It was all hush hush and Rose made lots of money. She rolled in a Ferrari, wore top designer suits and lived in a luxurious and expensive three bedroom apartment in downtown London. Rose and Petunia barely spoke to each other; neither were quite impressed by the others life style.
''I will take Harry now and you will leave as soon as possible. This is the last time we will see each other. Something we can both agree that it is in our best interests. Let's face it. We never even liked each other. Even as children. Lily was the only one who could make us civil towards one another. Goodbye. And good luck!''
Harry glared mockingly at his friend once the little old lady who had asked him for a small dance left. Making himself a plate, the young man looked out onto the dancefloor. Everyone was enjoying themselves at this beautiful and amazing party the Malfoy had thrown for the three schools. Well... Two school. Hogwarts had “
Alexander was not against the move. Far from it. His aunt Aggripine was seriously starting to get on his nerves. She kept on insisting that Harry should marry his sister’s daughter Isabelle, because she had the blood of the main line of the family in her veins. Despite repeatedly telling her that Alexander had blood-adopted Harry to make him his heir, the old nagging hag would not relent. Going so far as to say that it would keep the line pure and in the family. At this point, the poor man had simply lost it and told her clearly that if they EVER tried to trick Harry into marrying Isabelle, or tried to pursue this conversation ever again, she would be kicked out of the family. Besides, neither Isabelle nor Josephine (Alexander’s sister) had agreed to this; both perfectly content with having nothing to do with their dark relatives.
''Rose? It's me. Petunia. We... we need... we need to speak face to face! It's Lily! She... Her... Lily's dead, Rose... She was killed by some madman from her freak world and... and... her son is here and... I don't know what to do. There's this letter and it's... Please! Please, come and help me! I'm scared! Please Rose!'' cried Petunia as she finally allowed herself to feel her emotions.
Harry woke up later that evening to his Uncle's terrified face. After berating his foolish, but heroic nephew, Alexander started telling him that Alcazar was safe and that he barely remembered what had happened. Karkaroff had been fired and arrested for his role in all of this when it was found that he had hid his employee's abuse of his students. Many other students, graduates and current alike, had come forward to tell their stories. They had send their gratitude to the young man for standing up and finally ridding the world of that miserable filth. Many teachers were shocked and appalled that they had helped the problem rather than helped their students. The news made the headlines of all the European continent; everyone knew what had happened and how Harry had saved his friend from a monster. So much for staying hidden!
''Not if it will cause a war between the two countries. It would be easy for the old man to make it sound as if the Americans were personnaly attacking Brittain by taking the Boy-Who-Lived from him. Which they would be doing.'' countered Alexander with a small smile.
''Harry? How are you doing?'' asked uncle Alexander as he entered his nephew's bedroom.
Armand was a gentle, caring and patient lover; he had made sure to ask Draco what he liked and what he wanted. However, his skills and mastery of the art of sex were... Humm.... Lacking... The older boy tired after twenty second and had obtain his orgasm before Draco had started to feel any real pleasure (he didn't feel pain; it was a strange in-between). It left the younger boy unsatisfied. However, it was during the summer that Armand had decided to break their relationship, because, according to the french cad, Draco was simply not that great in bed... Instead of crying his eyes out, Draco had taken one of his ancestor's old wand, flooed to the nearest Malfoy villa, took a Magical Taxi (like the Knight Bus, but less crazy) to his ex-lover's house and proceeded to hex him blue, black and purple into the next week. Making sure, on his way out, to mention their little affair to his new, pretty and very much female fiancé and his parents, who turned out not that accepting of homosexual relationships. Less just say that the news of Draco Malfoy,
His luscious red lips from biting them, his beautiful molten silver eyes dilated from desire and pleasure, his slightly pink cheeks from his blushing and his elegant eau-de-toillette made the young man absolutely ravishing. His tight fitting royal-blue uniform that hugged his frame in all the right places made Draco even more alluring than had he been stark naked. It gave a small thrill of challenge and curiosity to Harry to see what the fabric was hiding.
“Lastly, in two weeks, the 13
, Ragnok! Welcome to the Vaux De Villiers town house. Rose has told me that you are little Harry's magical guardian and that you wanted to speak to us about the living arrangement.'' greeted the man as he sat down with three glass; one of blood and two of beer.
However, not all was happy moments and smiles that year. For the first time in their friendship's history, there was true fear that it would broken for ever. It all started because of a scandal on the Hungarian-Romanian magical border. A caravan of Gypsies was making their bi-annual cross between Hungary and Romania; all was well until the caravan was stopped by a squadron of Hungarian Aurors who had to make a routine check. Unfortunately, one of the younger men of the caravan had something to hide and was subsequently arrested; again nothing out of the ordinary there.
“OI!! Shut the hell up or it's a detention for you!” snapped Weasley to the second year viciously, completely ignorant of the meaning of the muggleborn second year middle finger raised gesture (thankfully for him, Granger wasn't paying attention or that kid would be in serious trouble).
1996, Charles Lionel Weasley officially married Valeria Anastasia Montracue in Bucharest, surrounded by their loved ones and by Lady Magic herself. It was a day of love, beauty and happiness as two loving families joined in the celebration of one of their own leaving the nest and creating their own family.
First year was horrid for poor Draco Malfoy, all his belief of blood superiority was disproven and mocked by the other students. He was showed, rather viciously and violently, the error of his way. He saw just how powerful, intelligent and resourceful could muggleborns be when it came to magic. If only they were educated in the ways of the Wizarding World; which they were only too eager to learn. He made it into the top five of his year with his best class being Potion; his worst being Herbology (he hated being dirty). He met new people and new cultures; he learned much about the world and calmed his temper and arrogance significantly. He didn't lose his pride, but learned to see the difference between blindly being prejudice and the truth. Before the end of the year, Draco made friends in the form of half-veela Marco Gomez from brazil and a muggleborn Lilianne Lacoursère.
“Why is it a matter of survival, George?”
“What is going on, Travers?” Hermione demands, voice crackling in Alpha command.
“Yea,” Hermione sighed.  “I told you some of the Wizarding World’s laws are archaic.  Omegas….cannot directly inherit.”
“Oh yes, they take their football as seriously as we Wizards take Quidditch.”
of course, what can I do?”
Unlike a Squib, I can still see magically enchanted items for what they are and I can even sense the magic imbued in objects.
“My magical immunity,” Travers nods, stone-faced.
Harry just nods.
George sucks in a surprised breath, clearly not expecting the apology.
But Fred didn’t make a conscious choice to reach out and pull on the magic available to him, he just did it.
“Yea, it’s not real fun.  Basically during your season your body is going to start signaling to all the unattached Alpha’s that you’re single and fertile.  And because that’s not bad enough, your body is going to send you a reminder too - in the form of some very uncomfortable hard ons and an itch that feels impossible to scratch.”
She knows that if he truly thought they were in danger, he wouldn’t appease her.
Harry tries to process that.
They get along really well, even with both being Alphas.
But in an instant, the scene is something else entirely.  Harry is fully in his own mind, aware and conscious, but he’s no longer on the bed, in the suite in the Omega Quarters.  Instead he’s somewhere he's not been before - a room in a pureblooded estate, perhaps?  It has that feel.  It’s a bedroom and Harry is shocked to see Zacharias Smith standing in the center of it, his hand fisted around Susan’s hair.  Susan herself is kneeling, naked, beneath him, her head forced back by Smith’s cruel grip.  There are bite marks everywhere - her throat, her nipples, her thighs, her ass, but the crown jewel of them is the fresh bonding bite mark on her throat.
I’m not just some unthinking chess piece that they get to maneuver to their will.
“It is fairly standard procedure Harry,” Dumbledore told him.  “The COA is a guardian to all Omegas; they only have your best interest at heart.”
He’s distracted though, by the door banging open in front of him and George’s levitated body drifting in followed by an even paler-than-usual Ron Weasley.
It’s like a gut punch. It’s painful.”
Molly, looking furious turns on her heel, marching out of the room.
We should have made sure we were on the same page before going in.
I’ve heard already you’ve accepted one from the Malfoy heir.”
But after a while, it’s common in courting pairs.
“What do you want, Nott?” Hermione snaps, clapping her book shut and turning a level gaze on the other Alpha.
“I can’t believe you didn’t even demand a refund,” Harry shakes his head, a tad disbelieving.
He turns his attention to the ‘proposal’.  It’s formally worded, and requests that Harry ask his Alpha to give her permission for Boot to approach Harry with the intent of courting him.  Harry snorts incredulously as he gets to the brief request after flipping it over multiple times to see if there was any more context as to why a guy he’d never had much of a connection with was suddenly expecting Harry to fall all over himself to date him.  But there was nothing.  Ron makes grabby hands at the letter and Harry thrusts it at him, turning his attention back to his plate and shoveling down his breakfast irately.
“You speak of ‘my omega’ as though it’s some other been living inside of me,” Harry says, crinkling his brow.
Haven’t you already given enough?”
Angelina rolled her eyes; “Oh, I’ll tell your brother alright.  Don’t move, Omega.” She turned quickly up the stairs to the boy’s dorms.
Fleur squeezes his hand reassuringly.
“Eh, we all have ‘em, Harry.  Lasts a few days to a week.  Starts pretty similar to what girls describe as PMS - get more irritable than usual, craving for sweets, body gets a little sore.  Then, ehm, well, might as well just break it to you … you’re gonna get bloody horny mate.”
But he doesn’t move.  These instincts are new, but strong, and he can tell challenging Nott by physically moving will not make this confrontation go his way.  He glances at Malfoy imploringly, understanding that the Slytherin is somehow, shockingly on his side in this, and even though Malfoy doesn’t forfeit his eye contact with Nott, he can tell by the way the blonde’s lips twitch upwards in amusement that he caught the plea.
I can’t begin to….how did you even come by this?”
Harry, a sweaty, seething ball of flame under the thin blanket feels like the season will never end.  He has only flashes of cognition, and goes in and out of consciousness for what feels like hours.  Every time he is aware enough to take anything in, George is there, or Susan,  petting him gently, speaking to him soothingly, offering small sips of water that he refuses half of the time.  There’s one point, where they’re both there, George pinning a struggling Harry down by his wrists on the floor while Susan is using magic to rapidly change the sheets.  Absently, Harry notes the high pitched whining sound reverberating throughout the room and belatedly realizes it is he that is making it.   He’s desperate for something, his body clenching and sore, tears coming freely and unabated, but he doesn’t know what it is he needs.
I added an extra embellishment to yours this year, since I know you appreciate my hard work.”
“Fine,” Olive snaps.  Then pauses.  “Thanks,” she says after a moment, voice sulky.
Really.
Harry pouted.  “Fine, then can you at least tell me who’s what and what the main Covens are?  I’ve never hated having such a late birthday as much as I do right now.”
“This is a war of ideology as much as it is of might, Harry.
And then he fell asleep.
How does it get triggered? Why haven’t we seen it before? I would have expected Smith to have dropped into Fight - if not with MacMillan, then at least when Fred attacked him.”
“I mean thats the point obviously.  Not a lot of omegas getting laid around here though, what with the over-protective professors and Covens.  Mostly we’re just restricted to the Omega Quarters until the heat passes.  Other Omegas can visit, but the quarters reject all other dynamics.  I’ll show you later, they're nice.  We all get our own room but there’s a common area as well.  It’s not all bad Harry.”
Harry nods.
“Professor,” Travers interrupts, voice polite.
“It might be cruel,” Oberon said.
It’s polite.
“Are you sure you didn’t just change your mind?” the words come tumbling out of his mouth, words handstanding over each other while his face blushes immediately scarlet.
“Why not compromise and carve out our own terms?
“Got it,” he responds, shooting Harry a quick smile before turning on his heel to follow Hermione’s direction.  Harry stares at his back, completely lost as to when Ron just started following Hermione’s orders without an ounce of protest. Shrugging internally he turns back to Hermione, narrowing his eyes in continued anger.
Olive told me she has Tuesday free and I can cover Monday so we just need someone who can help on Wednesday.”
She had non-magical plants too and I think she enjoyed them just as much.
They're master manipulators with a single-mindedness that scares me Harry."
“I’m almost in full season,” she sighs in an aggravated tone.  “Shouldn’t be more than a few hours now.”
She framed it that way, too, which did little to endear her to him, but he was too tired to be drawn into unnecessary conflict this early in the morning.
He’s never seen anything good come from an Alpha near an Omega’s neck and his heart beats faster immediately.
“It’s going to be okay, Fleur.
Additionally, this is a smaller match, but security at these things is always impressive, and of course, no one knows that we are coming.”
He’s staring at George.
He shoots a look at Fred who frowns in response but doesn’t say anything.
“Stebbins, right?”
I saw the whole thing from the other direction - a chance to get the Order to see that we were playing along, generate a little trust.
I won’t again.
Bill can’t seem to help himself from shooting one last glare at his younger brother before he seems to come back to himself, smiling gently at Fleur and pulling her hand up to his lips to press a gentle kiss to it.
“What’s this?”
“Alpha Malfoy,” Hermione nods in return and reaches a hand for Padma, “Omega Patel.”
“I know, Mrs Weasley.”
But I recommend waiting for your pre-Season.
“I have a friend who is feared by people who don’t understand him, just like you are apparently feared by people who don’t understand you.
“Getting married? Really?” Harry’s aghast. “But we’re still so young.”
Fleur's Patronus - a slender swan - rushes off with her message and Harry decides to march to the tune of her drum for now.
I’m sorry.”
“Yea, that doesn’t sound very sure.  I don’t know Boot, what can I say, I’m a romantic.  I appreciate your interest, but I think I’ll wait for a courting proposal from someone who is actually invested in me as a person instead of just my gender.”
“Of course you can, dear,” Padma says distractedly, not looking at all put out by the outburst.  She’s pulling her book bag over her shoulder and heading back out to the portrait entrance.  “I’ll be back after my morning classes.  Can’t afford to miss Transfiguration.”
“From what I’ve heard, the Alphas that are closest to you will have more power over you.  You’ll be more sensitive to my voice than you would to Nott’s or Malfoy’s, for example.  But anyone who can get close enough to gentle you can control you.  It’s horrible manners, of course, for a non-Coven Alpha to approach you in that way, but it doesn’t make the potential for it any less real.”
Harry sucks in a low breath, exchanging a look with Ron.
“We weren’t very close,” Harry responds, voice flat.
The resume their walk and Harry doesn’t say anything to Belle, figuring she’ll talk to him if she wants.
“Merlin,” Harry breathes, appalled.  “That sounds almost debilitating.”
I assure you, I did not make you wait out of some kind of indecision on my part about you.
The two are speaking in hushed but fervent voices, alone in the living room when Fleur and Harry enter.
They all look annoyed at that response, Harry for the obvious reason, but Seamus and Dean look less than excited about the prospect of having to deal with Harry’s courting.  Hermione clearly senses the mood and presses her lips into a frown, but Ron steps in with a prompt, “Tell them the rest ‘Mione.”
It can be dangerous if the Empath is directing angry or depressive feelings for example.
If you find the right Alpha, the Bond you can form with them…It can be truly beautiful.
He attacked - the
I think specifically for George, but I picked up a few things.
Our Coven was small but extremely close and Lily cared for all of us deeply.
And it’s a memory that will never fade.
Once the other boy has turned the corner in the path leading back to the house, Harry releases a shaky exhale and allows the tears that have been threatening to fall, raising a weary hand up to his face to cover his eyes in a gesture of self-comfort.
“It’s standard procedure, Miss Granger. The Headmaster will be coming over to speak to you both as well, I expect.”
Either that, or he was being an incredibly polite friend, and had been engaged in on again off again conversation with Leo, who had watched the contest with a keenly professional eye.
I think she just assumed you would see things her way, and that was her mistake.”
That’s a step too far and he knows it as soon as he says it.
I made a decision and that decision backfired on me, pretty severely if you’ll recall.
“These pendants are more than just decoration - they’re deeply imbued with magic. Each pendant carries the Coven’s joined intent.  In appreciation for the strength Harry brings to our Coven, and in gratitude to him for joining our family officially, I’d like to imbue this pendant with our protection.  All each of you need to do is cast this spell and direct all of your focus into the drive to ‘protect’.  If Harry is ever in need, this pendant may serve as a final line of defense.  Do you all accept?”
It’s your life.
Relaxing somewhat, Harry accepts her welcome, sliding in beneath the blanket next to her and leaning back against the cushion.  He wonders absently if Olive’s season has also passed, hopes it has and that it was less painful than his own.  He shoots a look at the closed door of the other private heat room, and Susan catches his glance.  “She finished up yesterday.  She has a fairly enviable cycle - two and a half months, about 10 weeks apart, about a day in pre-season, and two in full.  Padma sat with her through the height, but they both went back to Ravenclaw last night.”
Indeed, the arm is awkwardly long, perhaps three inches longer than the others, and slender at the wrist with long fingers, delicate looking.
“I mean it makes sense with Bill.
“He really should have known better than to approach you like that. And to be so rude about it," Hermione frowned.  “Hopefully your future suitors will be more thoughtful with their proposals.”
He plucks at some grass distractedly before wiping his hand on his trousers and pulling a knee up, throwing an arm around it to pull it close.
She’d scour the
“Does it satisfy?”
Harry relaxes even as he realises he’s beginning to emit a light scent of desire.
He breathes a low sigh out.
But he’s stymied in his effort by Ron, who interrupts the attempt by grabbing the letter himself and pulling it away, out of George’s reach.
Nott’s … growl, for lack of a better word has cut off with Harry’s lack of movement and Harry’s new senses are picking up … contentedness? from the other wizard now.  Thoroughly freaked out by all the new inputs, Harry keeps holding himself still even as Nott takes another step closer to him and he’s not exactly sure what would have happened next if there wasn’t the sound of a polite clearing of the throat suddenly reaching both of them from somewhere behind Nott.
He’s emmitting
“Bonding is a lifelong commitment, Harry.
Which was beautifully adorned.  Fairy lights shimmered over the Pitch and there were high tables set about for groups to congregate.  There was live music here too - but it was classical rather than the screaming rock from the Halloween Ball, a cellist, pianist, and violinist had set themselves up on a slightly elevated stage to the far right of the half pitch that was being used.  Warming charms encompassed the area.  The teachers had told them that there was another charm too - one that would prevent the un-Presented from party crashing.  Speaking of teachers, there were chaperones - McGonagall and Flitwick, but they were keeping to the edges, merely watching the crowd with keen eyes.
She’s a good person and she absolutely didn’t mean to make you feel that way.”
Ron pauses.
When Harry and Hermione enter the Room of Requirement, its not laid out the way he would have expected.  Well, to be honest, he isn’t sure what he expected, but this isn’t it.  The room is lit in soft candlelight and there are comfortable chairs and sofas strewn about the room where Dean, Seamus, Luna, and Ron are lounging.  Dean is laughing at something when they walk in and in spite of the heaviness of everything he and Hermione had just talked about, Harry feels himself start to relax.
“Suzie,” George exclaims, ushering her back to her seat where she had been chatting with Padma, who scoots over to make room for both George and Harry.
Harry moves to skirt around the Slytherin but he finds himself stopping cold at the low sound Nott emits in response to his movement.  It’s a guttural sound and in spite of himself, Harry feels a shiver run down his back and he instinctively holds himself still, hoping not to set Nott off any further.  The last thing he needs on top of everything else right now is to get into a scuffle with a Slytherin he’s never previously had a problem with.
Ron pauses, looks thoughtful.
Luna, Seamus and Dean have all taken a step back from the others of Oberon’s Coven and drawn wands, though, to their credit have them all clearly pointed down to the ground, an obvious defense but not an intention to escalate the situation.
Unfortunately, when the two Omegas manage to track down Bill, he is engaged in what appears to be a somewhat furious conversation with Fred.
“If only we knew what,” Fred mutters.
Harry isn’t quite sure where the other boy stands but he pushes on regardless, confident enough in his own actions.
But yeah, when one of them is using their Voice, or they’re angry, or they’re channeling some sort of intense emotion, yeah, there’s a part of me that wants to appease them, calm them, give in to what they want.”
“I can scent it,” she explains, voice soft.
And without an answer I’m not sure this contract has a chance, signed or not.”
Harry shivers a little, feels a hand creep up against his will to clasp his other arm’s elbow.
That piques Harry’s interest.
They were quiet for a minute.  “I reckon that’s real wise of your dad, George.”
He tries to consciously pump
As he comes back to himself, he feels himself growing tense, emitting a sour scent of fear, and Ron and Hermione both edge their way beside him, not so subtly digging elbows into ribs to move obstacles out of their way, and Hermione’s scent is growing bitter with rage.
Harry can’t help but wonder what it’s like behind closed doors - two Alphas in one Coven and neither much liking the other.
We can’t afford for this to happen when we’re facing off against Death Eaters.”
The Trio have just wrapped up in Herbology and are maneuvering out of the Greenhouses with the rest of their class, shared with the Hufflepuff 7th years, when Malfoy finally decides to make an appearance.
isn’t it?” Hermione says after a minute.
The Alpha scent tips through shock, swirling around Harry with a raging pulse, so powerful it makes Harry snap startled eyes up to match Malfoy’s vibrant gaze.
Clearly relieved that it hadn’t she gives him a quick but affection glare which he accepts with aplomb and leans in to answer the question in quiet tones.
“I thought you didn’t know anything more about what happened last night.”
I shouldn’t have been so mad at you.”
Startled, and a little dizzy from the amount of irritation emitting from the Alpha, Harry fights the urge to bare his throat in conciliation, instead planting his feet and crossing his arms defensively before meeting Hermione’s eyes head on.
I’m going to be courting anyway.
But Dumbledore? Shacklebolt?
Harry groans low when he catches sight of him.  He hears a suspicious sound to his side and turns to glare at his friend who is very clearly fighting back his chuckle.  “You have all the luck, mate,” the redhead says under his breath.
Time, for one, although it’s not a comfortable wait. Another Alpha could Settle you, if you didn’t think it would anger Hermione further.”
She leads him out of the castle and down to the lake, where they sit staring at the water for a moment before Hermione finally seems to gather her resolve.
“We’ll speak again soon.  Harry.”
Ron looks uncomfortable.
He wonders if it will
I’m getting tired of repeating myself.”
Both are casually, though fashionably dressed, with everyday black robes.
to Hermione who looks equally surprised.
How you would feel if I was trying to make you date someone you had no interest in?
“Timing is everything.”
“My grandmother is an Alpha, and my parents were both Alphas as well.  My mother was my father’s second.  As I’m sure you know, it’s unusual for women to present Alpha, almost as rare as it is for males to present Omega,” Susan begins, and Harry raises an eyebrow but keeps his silence, his look encouraging her to go on.  “My parents were part of a large Coven, almost all of whom died in the last war.  There were two omegas, and one of them gave birth to me.  By all accounts, the three of them shared deep affection, and although the omega wasn’t exclusive with them, she was happy to help them have a child.  It is unusual for Alphas to mate for life in the way that my parents did, but the Bones have always been unusual.  There hasn’t been a Beta born in our direct line for generations, but Omegas are fairly rare, so we aren’t as prolific as a lot of other lines.”
“Er…how often does it come Susan? I mean if it’s not rude to ask that,” Harry stammers, oddly fascinated.  Susan shrugs.
“I’m sure you’d be ferocious in your anger, darling.”
I’ll explain where you were coming from.
“Presentation?” Harry asked, confused.
Until I presented at least.”
He just whipped Bill back, wandless, no spell or anything and Bill hit his head so hard.
“Happy Christmas, dear.
Who's to say that this Alpha the Minister is proposing won’t make me as happy as Bill obviously makes Fleur?
“—grateful for the extra help!” Fred finishes for him, waggling his eyebrows suggestively.
He immediately pulls it on over his shirt.
“The man has survived 25 years married to my mum, he knows a thing or two about survival.”
Ron pointedly ignores them both, flipping through the latest edition of
Susan is crying as her head is forced back to reveal her neck as she faithfully replies, “You, Alpha.”
Harry feels the hairs on his neck stand to attention.
“I really hope not,” Padma groans.
The room is ominously silent while Fred reads through the proposal.
They’re quiet for a few minutes before Ron speaks again.  “Mum’s worried about George.”
“That’s exactly why I need to go, Fleur,” Harry snaps, shaking off her hand.
Thankfully Harry is saved from any need to further interact by the appearance of the rather young Ministry official who leads the introductory class. The woman has a genial demeanor and a fairly bubbly personality, and reminds Harry somewhat of Tonks, albeit without the Metamorphmagus’ inherent clumsiness.  She introduces herself as Alice Burbage and Harry wonders vaguely if she’s related to the Muggle Studies professor before she affirms it herself, claiming the professor as her (“Much older!”) sister.  Harry’s newfound senses tell him that Miss Burbage is a Beta.
An acceptance of your Omega’s submission, an appreciation of your contrition.
The class takes place in a room Harry hasn’t been in before.  Instead of desks, were are armchairs arranged in a circle. The walls of the room are filled with Wizarding art - modern looking with dark lines but furious pastel swirls, clearly by the same artist.  When you would look away and then return your gaze you could see that the swirls had morphed, changed color and depth in your absence.  The room was warm with gentle lighting and a rug covering the floor.  The overall effect was that the room was alluring and rather soothing, Harry thought, as he sunk into one of the armchairs.
George smiles, a little sadly.
I’m not opposed to getting to know you, to see if we fit.
Raphe is downstairs, packing.
Malfoy smirks at him when he sees Harry’s blush, but his eyes are laughing, not cruel, so Harry can’t find it in himself to be perturbed.  Besides, the Alpha’s scent is intoxicating him somewhat, in such close proximity, and he finds himself swaying closer to the Slytherin.  Hermione frowns and reaches a hand out to grip around his arm, squeezing gently in warning.  Harry finds himself grateful for the grounding and shakes his head slightly to clear it.  It helps, but only a little.
